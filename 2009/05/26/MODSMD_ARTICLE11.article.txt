# Crime and Punishment
## My love letter to my co-op 
### 
Dear My Co-op. I love you. Really. You
are a great community, you're just
quirky and far enough away from
everything to he the best house on campus,
and you're committed to trying to do well by
the earth. You use the most environmentally
responsible products you can find, like recy
cled toilet paper and nontoxic cleaning solu
tions. You have recycling bins all over the
kitchen, and you have three compost bins.
People actually use them (most of the time)!
You make sure vegetarians can eat well at
every dinner, and you'd do vegan if there
were any vegans in the house. You support
political discourse and do house hiking trips
and fireside gatherings. I love you. I'll miss
you.
Now. take this in the context of the fact
that you are absolutely great: it's just that
there are a few mistakes that get made fairly
consistently, though I think these are more of
"human being" problems than problems spe
cific to our co-op.
I'm talking about those mistakes that are
unquestionably waste.
There's a piece of paper prominently
posted on our refrigerator that points out the
amount of water that various daily choices
are responsible for consuming (for the
record. I claim credit for being neither the
first to see this nor the one to post it — which
is another reason my co-op is great).
Even in the face of a big sign that says a
pound of beef is responsible for 1,500 gallons
of water, it's not uncommon that 10 pounds
of meat get thrown out because they didn't
get cooked after a defrost or because the
house forgot they were there for a few weeks.
When defrosting, it's not that unusual that
a bunch of meat is left in a sink with the water
running over it for several hours. In emergen -
cies. sweet. There aren't many other options
when you have two hours to get dinner to
gether for 60 people and nothing's defrosted.

Hut it's started happening almost every day
when it's not that hard to put meat in the
refrigerator the night before or in the morn
ing to defrost.
More on the energy side — ovens and
stovetop burners get left on with surprising
frequency (they're electric, which makes it
easier to not notice they're on). This is not
only a waste of energy: it's pretty dangerous
for the next person who comes along. Or, in
terms of lighting, when a space that is well-lit
by ambient light coming in through windows
has all its lights on. even when flipping them
on and off produces no discernible change in
light availability ... it's not really doing any
thing for anyone.
Walking around campus, I've noticed that
it's not uncommon to see hoses left on. drain
ing directly into the street or into a storm
drain. Walking around America, you see the
doors of air-conditioned stores left open all
the time — similar in concept to leaving the
refrigerator door open for five minutes while
you make a sandwich. Most of the time, this
waste is unconscious or accidental, and it
doesn't take too niueh effort to get rid of it
onee you're aware of it. That's the beauty of
eliminating waste — it doesn't have to affect
lifestyles, since the waste wasn't doing any
thing for anyone in the first place. We just
have to be a little smarter about how we ap
proach certain systems, like defrosting. Or
like paying attention to what's in the refriger
ator. and then closing the fridge door while
we contemplate the goodness within.
Again. I'm definitely talking about the
kinds of waste that have no benefit. Like pay
ing for meat and then throwing it out. It's this
kind of waste that is easiest to get rid of,since
causing it has no benefit for people. A lot of
the time, it's actually hurting people, through
cost or through incidences such as stovetops
being unexpectedly on and burning people.
Because really.at the end of the day, if you

Most of the time, [...] waste is
unconscious or accidental, and
it doesn't take much
effort to get rid of it once
you're aware of it.

want a steak, and you're going to love that
steak, and it's super tasty.go ahead and eat it.
Or if you come home after an awful day and
the only thing that is going to make you
happy is a hot. 15-minute shower, go for it. If
you're enjoying something that isn't substi
tutable, that's not waste. It might not be the
most efficient use of resources all the time,
but it's not waste.
On the other hand, tossing out difficult -
to-produce meat, hard-to-transport-and-re
ally-damn-scarce freshwater, or last-time
we-didn't-have-enough-of-th is-so-we
threw-out-the-governor electricity is just
silly. So if we as a culture are looking for ways
to improve our resource utilization, let's start
by eradicating waste. The marginal benefit is
huge, and you can still turn on your heater in
the winter.

Emily sometimes buys a few gallons of gaso
line and lights them on fire for fun. It's only
waste if she can't watch, right'.' If you want to
help her get into the carpool lane when she does
this, email her at gruberte@stanford.edu to join.
