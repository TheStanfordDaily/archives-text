# The 						Dude Abides
## If you will it Dude, it is no Dream 
### 
The latest spat of protests over the re
duced hours of the Community Center
staff once again highlights the volatile
climate around racial issues on this campus.
Not unlike a whole host of issues, discussions
around "diversity" versus "entitlement" hap
pen wholly within the context of the Stanford
Bubble, wholly disconnected from larger
struggles happening beyond El Camino
Real.There is however.an issue that for once
seems to have powerful implications both in
side the Farm and out in that great, terrifying
wilderness known as the real world.
Hie Development. Relief and Education
for Alien Minors Act of 2009. or "DREAM
ACT." is a measure introduced this past
March to Congress that would provide un
documented students a path to citizenship
contingent upon enrollment in higher educa
tion or the United States military. Unlike a
wide swath of national and international de
velopments whose impact upon the Stan is
non-existent, the possible passage of the
DREAM ACT would make a splash here be
cause. unbeknownst to a great many of us. we
have undocumented students among our
Cardinal ranks.
Until literally a week ago. I had never ac
tually considered the notion that Stanford
could have any students here that were not
legally allowed to be in the U.S.-of-A. Well,
you can add that to the list of things 1 have
been wrong about.There ;ire ;i handful of un
documented students enrolled at Stanford,
with a friend of mine from freshman year
who for the sake of anonymity will be called
Clara — among them.
In a rather candid and moving email ex
change. I discussed with Clara the circum
stances surrounding her status, particularly

in regards to her time at the Farm. Brought
into the U.S. on a now-expired temporary
tourist visa at the age of four. Clara was edu
cated here. Applying to Stanford as a Mexi
can citizen, Clara was totally honest with the
University about her standing, which in turn
provided her with a full scholarship given her
inability to legally earn wages. Though I will
draw criticisms for this comment, I applaud
the school for the courage to honor educa
tional excellence, even in the face of narrow
minded legality.
An active, highly motivated and inctcdi
blv involved student.Clara's future prospects
are uncertain, to say the very least. "It is real-
Iv hard to plan for the future when you aren't
even sure whether you will be in the country
the next day." she remarked, noting the inac
cessibility of study abroad programs, paid in
ternships and other resources. Clara's only
real hope of staying in America, outside of
marriage, rests with the DRHAM ACT.
rhough I have a personal connection to
Clara. 1 have no doubt there are thousands
out there like her who have been blessed
with the opportunity to excel in the Ameri
can school systems but are faced with the
possibility of ultimately being denied the
chance to make good upon these tools. Edu
cation. above all. is the means by which to
better one's life — to become equipped with

the knowledge and tools necessary to lead a
fulfilling life. The last thing we should he
doing is discouraging students from actively
engaging in intellectual pursuits.
The intersection of immigration and edu
cation contributed largely to me being here
today. My maternal grandmother, a Roman
ian Holocaust refugee living in Israel, was
given a chance to come to America because
of a scholarship to NYU. The triumphs and
tribulations of my family over the past five
decades were made possible b\ the chance
NYU. and to a large extent the U.S.. gave to
my grandmother so many years ago.
Though America has a distinguished his
tory of really screwing minority groups over
(see Chinese Exclusionary Act. pre-1865
South, anything regarding Native Ameri
cans. 19th century New York anti-Irish senti
ments. etc.), the reason we have excelled to
such extraordinary heights is our ability to
provide a haven for the best and the brightest
that the rest of the world vsas too prejudiced
or stupid to welcome.This is a legae\ we must
continue.
I support the DRHAM ACT out of appre
ciation both for Clara's talent and lot the vast
potential these undocumented students can
bring to the I J.S. as citizens. Xenophobia and
over-played fears of "immigrant invasions" a
la l.ou l)obbs are not the solution for breath
ing life into our sagging national fortunes. I ,et
us bring people like Clara out of the shadows
and into the legal workings of this country.

/nek is beginning to get alarmed hy his recent
"serious"streak. Next week he will relentlessly
disparage some large group of people/Zonies.
Have any easy targets? Let him know at zwar
ma(p stanford.edu.
