# Looking back and looking forward

### 
At long last. I think we can fi
nally say that the great transi
tional seasons of 2008-2009
are past for the Cardinal.
And though I won't have front row
seats. I. for one.am still pretty excited to
see what's just around the corner for
Stanford in more sports than I can
count.
I have an odd sense of just how
strange it must've been to be a sports
fan in the Stanford Class of 2(K)9, be
cause I feel like I'm somewhat of an
honorary member as my co-term stud
ies wind down here. I "here was a much
greater sense of finality for the C 'lass of
2( HIS. which saw its era on campus come
to an end with the football team strug
gling. but winning some huge upsets
against I ISC and Cal: the basketball
team concluding the Lopez twins-era
in style in the Sweet 16: ( andice Wig
gins trying for a national title in her last
game with the Stanford women; and
Stanford baseball driving all the way to
the College World Series in ()maha.
The members of the C 'lass of 2009
will have memories of their own. but
they will be memories of a different
sort — not of endings in their last year
at Stanford, but beginnings. Because as
I leave Stanford with this year's class,
it's hard not to feel that there are good
things around the corner for a lot of
marquis programs here on the I arm.
When I first set foot on campus in
the spring of 2(H)4. Stanford football
was. essentially, on its last legs. ITien
quartcrback Trent I Edwards gave the
team some star-power, but not much
hope. And things got worse before they
got better.
Hut maybe they had to. Ilie end of
the Buddy Teevens-era gave rise to the
Walt I larris hire. When what seemed
like a safe move at the time, hiring an
established Division-I head coach to
rebuild a stagnating program, blew up
in the athletic department's laces with a
l-ll 200 ft season, a drastic step was
needed. Aikl so far. that drastic step
looks to be paying dividends, as head
coach Jim I larbaugh leads the team to
wards what could be a big 2()0 l J cam
paign. With a promising young OB per
haps ready to takeover.a solid running
game and tenacious defense. 2009
could be a banner year for a rejuvenat
ed ( ardinal football squad.
On the hardwood, the Stanford
women will return virtually every
major contributor and look to make
yet another run deep into the postsea
son. But somehow, now a full year re
moved from the departure of Wiggins,
there is the sense that now. more than
ever, this team is locked and loaded for
action.
With the powerful post presence of
junior Jayne Appel and sophomore
Kayla Pcderson as the team's back
bone. plus the development ol several
exciting youngsters, the cards may just
finally be stacked in the Cardinal's
favor. You got the feeling watching
Stanford against IJConn in the llnal
I our last season that the team just was
n't quite ready — perhaps iI Wiggins
had been a year younger and still on the
team, or Appel and the others a year
older.Stanford might have been able to
hang tough with the Huskies. Next
year, the latter will be a reality, and
there's certainly no reason to expect
any steps backwards for a team that has
been among the most consistently
dominant teams at Stanford over the
last decade.
As for men's hoops, it's hard to envi
sion a major turnaround coming quick
ly for a team losing nearly all of its
biggest contributors. But, for better or
worse,starting in 200M-2010. this will be
coach Johnny Dawkins' team, and he
will get a virtually clean slate to rebuild
the Stanford program. ()ne way or an
other. Stanford will.at the very least.be
able to get a very good sense for its
most recent major coaching hire over
the next couple of seasons.

And finally baseball, which had
maybe the most disappointing season
of all of the aforementioned Cardinal
teams. As the team dropped two out of
three to Oregon State, the bell official
ly tolled for the 2009 season — the
team would not be returning to
Omaha in 2(X)9,and, indeed, would not
even play for a chance to return in an
NCAA Regional.
Yet in that failure lies perhaps the
greatest evidence of a team in transi
tion. After losing many of the cogs that
kept the Cardinal's 2008 offensive ma
chine running (catcher Jason Castro,
centerfielder Sean Ratliff, second
baseman Cord Phelps, etc.) the team
simply took too long to find its footing
in 2(X)9. By the time Stanford started to
roll in May.it was already.perhaps, too
lale for its chances this year. But with
Friday and Saturday starters Brett
Mooncvham and Jordan Pries (both
freshmen) returning in 2010. along
with several sophomores who played
key offensive roles in 2009.perhaps it's
the Stanford baseball team, more than
any other, that bears all the marks of a
program to watch next year.
In short, looking back. 2008-2009
may have been a bear market for Stan
ford sports. But on closer inspection,
much of this market, at least, seems
poised for a turnaround.

Denis Griffin hopes Stan ford 's teams mm
around faster than the nation s economy.
