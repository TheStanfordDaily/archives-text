# BUDGET CUTS
## VPUE, Engineering announce cuts 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
Both the Office of Vice Provost for
I Jndergraduate Education (VPUE) and the
School of Engineering announced signifi
cant reductions to staff and programming
last week, because of the University's finan
cial situation.
Like virtually all campus units. VPUE
and the School of Engineering have been
forced to restructure administration and
make sacrifices in staff and programming in
order to stay afloat.
VPUE
In his address to the Faculty Senate last
Ihursday, Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman announced that
VPUE has eliminated 25 administrative and
professional positions in recent months,
which has reduced its non-lecturer staff by
IS percent. Sixteen employees were laid oft.
nine spots were lost by attrition and six new
positions were created in restructuring.
In an interview with The Daily. Bravman
explained how the cuts were made.
"Our goal was to share administrative
support wherever |X)ssible and to minimize
a reduction in directly serving staff,"
Bravman said. "We tried to take most of the
cuts in background staff.'
Bravman said that VP! JFV funds were
hardest hit by endowed funds that went
"underwater." meaning their current market
value is less than their historic dollar value.
Endowed funds make up 60 percent of
VPUE funds, and underwater funds are
forcing the office to cut budgets by $K-1 0 mil
lion.
"Our largest dollar loss is from the
endowed funds." Bravman said. "They pay
out almost nothing."
VPUE, which previously housed nine
administrative units under its umbrella, has
now reduced that number down to four.The
largest change is the creation of Stanford
Introductory Studies (SIS), which now
includes Freshman and Sophomore
Programs (I SP). Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) and Introduction to the
I lumanities (IHUM).
"Combining FSP. PWR and IHUM
made perfect sense because they're all cur
rieular-based programs with faculty teachers
principally aimed at first years." he said.
The other three units under the new
arrangement are the Center for Teaching
and learning, the Bing Overseas Studies
Program and Undergraduate Advising and
Research, which has subsumed the
Freshman Dean's ()ffiee.
"Those three units becoming one had
been in the works for a while." Bravman
said. "Undergraduate Advising and
Undergraduate Research were merged
because advising involved making students
aware of research opportunities."
VPUE's restructuring will affect students
mostly through reduced programs, specifi
cally a smaller number of courses offered for
sophomore seminars and Sophomore
College.
Bravman said that VPUE. has been plan
ning for these cuts since fall of 200 X. when
the office first learned about funding issues,
and that the office began organizing reduc
tions in mid-November. VPI IE still has
another $1.2-1.4 million to cut in its budget,
but Bravman explained that the office has
postponed that to fiscal year 2011.
"I ultimately am optimistic about the
future," Bravman added. "I'm particularly
excited about SIS. which will help students
think broadly about their first intellectual
experiences at Stanford."
IHUM Director Russell Berrnan agreed
that while the restructuring was a difficult
process, the new organization system shows
promise.
"A result of some painful staff reductions,
the new organization. SIS. provides an
opportunity to develop greater synergy
among these important pieces of the fresh
man and sophomore years." Berrnan wrote
in an email to The Daily.
The director also explained that IHUM
will be facing reduced programming. While
previous years offered 12 winter-spring
course options for freshmen, that number
has now been reduced to 10.
"Because more faculty want to teach in
the program than we can accommodate,"
