# LUCK OF THE DRAW
## Students learn fates under new system; 89 unassigned 
### CHRISTINE McFADDEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With housing assignments posted around 5
p.m. last Friday and released online later that
night,students this year became the first to expe
rience the new three-tiered Draw system and
also the first to feel the effects of housing "un
stuffmg."
According to Student Housing, the changes
this year went over relatively smcxithlv. Despite
the new process and procedural changes in
place, assignments were finished on time and the
new system is, so far. trouble-free, administrators
said.
"The feedback overall has been positive —
people seem to think the process is fair, and that
we are on the right track." said Executive
Director of Student I lousing Rodger Whitney.
Undergraduate Housing
Student I lousing this year saw major changes
in which living arrangements were considered to
be popular among students. Cut-off numbers for
Housing were not released during the ranking
period, which arguably affected which living
quarters were in high demand.
"One difficulty is that past popularity of
houses is based on many things, not just cut-off
numbers," said Sue Nunan. director of Housing
Assignments.
Nunan went on to explain how students are
often attracted to houses with higher cut-off
numbers than in previous years, ranking those
first with a supposed higher chance of getting in.
1 lowever. because this occurs with many stu
dents. the cut-off number the following year is
actually lowered.
Whitney said efforts to increase the number
of desirable options have alleviated concern over
this issue to some extent.
"One thing which has changed this year, and
was a goal of the Draw Task Force and I lousing
Master Plan, is that the draw of houses has
changed," Whitney said. "Not only are the Row
houses popular, but now a real array of residence
types including large residences and apartments."
According to Whitney, several houses with
out historically low cut-off numbers, such as
Mirrielees, filled with lier ()ne and low Tier Two
numbers.
Among the houses and dorms that filled lier
()ne this year were Row houses such as Xanadu,
Bob.bXO. Storey and Mars, although they did not
have as low of cut-off numbers as usual.
Eucalipto, Adelfa (focus) and Granada in
Lagunita Court drew Tier One, as did French
House and Casa Italiana. Branner (focus) and
Crothers singles, on the dtxket for students to
rank for the first time in recent memory, also
went to Tier One numbers, as did cooperative
houses FBF and Chi Theta Chi.
"Most of the co-ops filled in lier One. some
in Tier Two. with a good mix of staff, pre-assign
nients and Draw assignments." Whitney said.
I le noted one of the department's concerns
was the filling of the co-ops. as pre-assignments
got off to a late start this year. Next year. Student
Housing and Residential Education will work
together to ensure that the process is announced

earlier and is made clearer to students. In the
end. all hut Synergy filled with people who
requested respective houses.
"They [Synergy] have had those spaces left
open for them to recruit via the waiting list,"
Whitney said. "Normally we would have filled
the house with people who request to live any
where. hut since this house is a co-op. the spaces
were held for the wait list so that people who
want to live in a co-op and are willing to fulfill the
requirements will live there."
Like Mirrielees. Roble filled with Tier One
and low Tier Two numbers. Toyon filled quickly
in Tier Two, and the lower tiers went to some
houses in Florence Moore Hall, Okada and
Suites, specifically the six-person suites.
(iraduate Mousing
Whitney noted that for the first time in
Stanford history. Student \ lousing is easily meet
ing demand for graduate housing. This is due to
the added space from the Munger Graduate
Residence.
"Some grad students are currently unas
signed.but we're confident they'll be assigned by
the start of school." Whitney said. "Students
should sign up for the summer wait list if they are
unassigned."
The graduate housing lottery, which also ran
smoothly, saw an increase in interest in the gen
der-neutral program. Hie program was expand
ed to more housing options this year, and the
demands of students were met.
Slimmer I lousing
Anyone who applied for summer housing
and was willing to live anywhere received it.
according to Housing. In fact, additional spaces
are still available for both graduates and under

graduates.
The only students unassigned for summer
were those who had limited residence choices.
Unassigned students as well as any others seek
ing summer housing are advised bv Housing to
apply by May 31 for the waiting list, with results
being announced June 5.
Unassigned Students
Compared to last year, there were fewer
unassigned students with guaranteed housing.
"We always expect and plan for a certain
number of unassigned students so that vacancies
which occur over the summer can be filled."
Whitney said.
According to Whitney, there are about 89
unassigned-but-guaranteed students who will
receive housing assignments over the summer,
compared to last year's 125.
"Eighty-six more upperclassmen applied
than last year under guarantee." Nunan said.
"About 110 more applied than expected last
year, so between the two years, we're up about
2(H) people, but we've added spaces with
Crothers Hall, so we have 111 more undergrad
uate beds this fall than last year at this time."
As for unguaranteed students, which number
65 and are typically fifth-year seniors or students
who had guaranteed years but restricted housing
choices, many should receive housing after guar
anteed students are assigned, according to
Housing.
Post-Draw
Now that assignments have been released.
I lousing encourages students to make note of
their in-house draw meeting date.
If students aren't happy with their assign
ment. they are advised not to cancel their hous

ing— unless they are certain they will live off
campus — and to still attend their in-house draw,
hut additionally apply for the re-assignment
round in Axess by the autumn waitlist deadline
of July 5. However, students are encouraged to
reapply to houses where they really want to live,
because once reassignments are given, current
assignments are cancelled immediately
Student Housing distributed a survey earlier
last week in order to get feedback on the overall
Draw process and changes. According to
Whitney,student responses will be carefully eval
uated over the summer.
One frequent complaint Housing received
was from upperclassmen who had been through
the Draw before and wanted to obtain their
Draw numbers before ranking their preferences.
Nunan noted that since students were able to
rank all of their residence choices in order of
preference rather than a limited amount — a
major difference from past years — Draw num
bers were unnecessary.
"We will review the merits of having the
numbers available in advance again next year."
Whitney said. "Student feedback indicates we're
on the right track, but as always, we will work
hard to improve our processes for students."
With the implementation of the Housing
Master Plan and the creation of new. premier
spaces for upperclassmen. Whitney hoped that
more people would be happy with their assign
ments.
"We hope students will stay unbiased and
give us feedback." he said. "We'll have more time
to tweak and improve for next year, but this year
has been very successful."
