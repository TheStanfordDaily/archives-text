## Money pours in for goat donations 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
White Plaza featured some novel guests
last Thursday, as four goats and a 200-pound
yak were on site to lend their hooves to a
charity effort sponsored by graduate students.
Members of the Intervarsity Graduate
Christian Fellowship (IGCF) brought the ani
mals to Stanford as part of the "Stanford C ioat
Project," an effort to raise money to purchase
goats for impoverished families in developing
countries. The fundraising effort raised a total
of approximately $6,600, with 1 (K) percent of
the proceeds going to the purchase of B<X dairy
goats.
News of the effort also led to a late contri
bution from an outside donor who learned of
the project's results, which will allow addition
al purchases and could result in a grand total
of as many as 100 goats.
KiCI members explained the choice to
donate goats as an effort to provide a lasting

charitable contribution.
"We were looking for something to do that
had a component of outreach, but wasn't just
a free gift, and would empower people," said
Neth Walker, a second year Ph.D. student in
geological and earth sciences.
"We didn't want a one-off â€” we wanted
something that would last," Walker added.
Kassa Betre.a second-year Ph.D. student in
particle physics and an iCKT member, said
that goats provide a steady supply of milk, pro
duce calves that can be sold for money and
also produce fertilizer.
"You're not just giving them a temporary
solution." Metre said. "It's more long-term."
Metre, who spoke of his own experience
growing up in poverty in I Ethiopia, added that
he found the effort to be important symboli
cally. as well as tangibly.
"It's about creating opportunities for the
Stanford community to reach out to people
who may be lar away, but are still our broth
ers and sisters." Metre said

The IGCF, a student organization with
roughly 70 active members, came to White
Plaza on Thursday as the culmination of a
three-week fundraising effort. Passersby were
able to huv tickets at a price of five dollars to
pet a goat and 10 dollars to pet a goat and also
take a picture.
Nate Chambers, a third-year Ph.D. student
in computer science and a coordinator of the
project, said the event exceeded their expec
tations, with over halt of the fundraising
occurring on Thursday.
"A lot of people came up," ( hambers said.
" I here were a lot who got really invested per
sonally. and would just buy six tickets for no
reason."
Sadie Bartholomew, a member of the
ICiCF steering committee, echoed Chambers'
comments.
"I think it went tar better than we expect
ed. the response from students, faculty and
passerby." said Bartholomew, a second-year
biochemistrv Ph.D. student.

"It was very exciting to see the enthusiasm
from the campus community." she added.
Speculating about why the goats attracted
support. Chambers felt that the tangible qual
ity was the key component.
"I don't want to get too philosophical
about it." C hambers said, "but I think that
particularly now in this economy people are

safer about their money. Iliey want
to make sure to do good."
"When you have something you
can touch and feel." he added,
"there's a security and a self-assur
ance that their money is going to
something good."
Walker also noted the appeal of
novelty value.
"1 think just having the goats and
the yak out there just piqued every
one's interest," Walker said.
Bartholomew added that after
the positive response,she hopes for a
repeat performance in 2010.
"The goats will be coming again
next year, 1 hope," Bartholomew
said.
