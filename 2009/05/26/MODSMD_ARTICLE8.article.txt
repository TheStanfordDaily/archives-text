## EDITORIAL Stanford correct in standing up for gender-neutral housing 
### 
Tensions have recently flared up on
campus and nationwide over an arti
cle submitted to The National Review,
the famous conservative magazine founded
by the late William F. Buckley. The article
was written by an overprotective parent of a
Stanford student who became upset over the
fact that the student, a senior, was assigned
to a mixed-gender room.
Iliis year is the first year of a pilot program
for gender-neutral housing at Stanford, al
though it has long existed unofficially
through many of the co-ops. Perhaps the most
striking part of the article was that the author
expressly stated that had Stanford offered
this option four years ago. she never would
have allowed her daughter to matriculate
here. It is understandable that there may be
some pressure on Stanford to backpedal and
reverse its stance on gender-neutral housing
to preserve matriculation rates.particularly in
an economically trying time: but so far. there
is no sign that it will, and the editorial board
would like to continue to encourage Stanford
to support the option of gender-neutral hous
ing. Character is demonstrated through
strength in the face of adversity, and it is great
to live in a place that continues to be a model
for other universities.
The first observation inspired by this situ
ation — unrelated to the issue of gender
neutral housing — is the danger of "helicop
ter parenting." the idea that parents contin
ue to hover around their sons and daughters
after they go to college and proceed to mi
cromanage their lives.The author of the arti
cle expressed concern that her daughter did
not have a say in her housing situation, as she
had appointed a proxy for her housing meet
ing. but the daughter has expressed in no un
certain terms that she was comfortable and
happy with her housing arrangement. As

adults, students are, in general, better served
by being allowed to make iheir own choices;
it usually turns out for the best, or alternate
ly allows students the chance to learn from
their own mistakes. A counterpoint to this
argument is that many parents foot the hefty
Stanford bill and should thus have a say in
the lives of their offspring. While it is a sepa
rate argument whether parents should be
expected to pay for college, monetary lever
age should not be used as a tool of control to
keep college-age children in line.
Demonizing gender-neutral housing is
also entirely unfair to the LGBTQ commu
nity. Enshrining a bi-gendered system as im
mutable relegates the transgendered popu
lation to second-class status and borders on
hate. Implying that allowing people of oppo
site genders to room together will cause
them to sleep together is not only judgmen
tal and assuming of the social mores of Stan
ford students, but also assumes a hetero-nor
mative society. Stanford hosted the largest
"No On Proposition H" phone bank in the
state of California and has been a national
leader for LGBTQ rights. Preserving gen
der-neutral housing will entrench that status
and serve as an example to universities
around the world.
Every so often there comes a time when
our convictions are tested, and it appears
Stanfordjias passed this test this time. The
editorial board applauds and encourages
continued support for gender-neutral hous
ing. not only to allow students the freedom
to make their own choices, but also to stand
in solidarity with the LGBTQ community.
May Stanford's gender-neutral housing poli
cies serve as an example for other universi
ties. who may be wary of alienating parents
by adopting a similar policy, even when they
know it is the right thing to do.
