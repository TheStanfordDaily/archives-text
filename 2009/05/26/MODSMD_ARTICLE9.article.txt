## Native culture deserves respect 
### 
For generations. Native peoples in this
country have struggled with the appro
priation. commodil'ication and exotifi
cation of our cultures — processes deeply
rooted in histories of colonization and op
pression. Stanford University has not been
immune to these societal illnesses. ()n numer
ous occasions over the past four decades, the
Native community at Stanford — consisting
of Native American, Alaska Native and Na
tive Hawaiian students — has confronted,
and continues to confront, these issues here
on campus.
In 1972. a small group of Native students
petitioned the University for the removal of
its former "Indian" mascot and were success
ful in doing so. sparking movements toward
the removal of similar mascots throughout
the country. Vet. in spite of the students' suc
cess, the mascot issue did not die 111 the 19705.
Since then, year after year, when Big Game
comes around, groups of nostalgic alumni and
students feel the need to try to revive the mas
cot's disrespectful and denigrating imagery.
As recently ;is 2(M)6,The Stanford Review fea
tured an editorial entitled "Long Live Light
foot!" referring to Prince Lightfoot. who.
from 1951 to 1972, served as the University's
official "Indian" mascot at football games.
Ilns was in response to the controversy sur
rounding a number of T-shirts printed by a
group of alumni which featured the face of
Stanford's former mascot.
Similarly, despite the numerous voiced
concerns of the Native community. The Re
view has sporadically used a caricature
known as the "Chief" in association with its
"Smoke Signals" column.This caricature was
last seen in 2(X)5, though The Review still reg
ularly publishes "Smoke Signals'" in its week
ly paper. In whatever shape or form,there has
been a consistent history of those insistent on
"bringing back the Indian, and in each occur
rence our community has been steadfast in
our opposition.
Unfortunately, degrading depictions of
Native peoples as mascots are not the only is
sues of this sort that our community faces
here on campus. Each year when I lalloween
comes around,our community is brought face
to face with those who find it fun and cool to
dress up like "Pocahontas." "Tiger Lily" or
"Lilo and Stitch." thinking nothing of their
demeaning costumes and the history of cul
tural appropriation they represent. Also,
every spring, various houses and dorms have
become accustomed to throwing "lu au par
ties, featuring "tiki" bars and students dressed
up in coconut bras and grass skirts, with little
or no consideration of the history and the

people that these parties represent. These
people, more often than not.simplydonot un
derstand the roots of our community's con
cerns over these disrespectful misrepresenta
tions of our peoples, and have no intention of
offending anyone. They often have no idea
what it feels like to have a total stranger look
them in the eyes and tell them that they are
dressed as a member of their ethnic group,
while wearing mock regalia from other cul
tures and religions, with little or no under
standing of where or how their "costume"
came about. Ignorance, though, is no excuse
for intolerance. So. once again,our communi
ty stands steadfast in our opposition.and in so
doing we intend to educate.
fhe American media and I lolly wood have
long done Native peoples, as well as other
marginalized peoples, extreme injustice with
the derogatory stereotypes and misrepresen
tations they have created. Mascots, party
themes and costumes that depict similar por
trayals of marginalized peoples — whether
intentionally or not — serve to perpetuate
and reinforce these stereotypes and misrep
resentations. As this continues to occur, these
stereotypical misrepresentations continue to
be ingrained in the American consciousness
and the cycles of marginalization and oppres
sion. too. continue on. Native peoples since
1492 have been represented as "savages."
"heathens" and, more recently, mascots and
caricatures in literature and other forms of
mass media. These misrepresentations have
palpable implications for our peoples socially,
mentally and politically. We. Native students
here at Stanford, continue to fight the same
fight that our ancestors and elders have for
generations — a light for respect.equal rights
and treatment as human beings. Our cultures
are not party themes. Our traditional regalia
and clothing are not costumes. We are not
mascots or caricatures. We are human beings.
Today in White Plaza, a number of stu
dents will be holding a demonstration to
make a clear statement that these issues of
cultural sensitivity, stereotyping and misrep
resentation need to be taken seriously by
everyone at this University. Our demonstra
tion will be held in solidarity with the Ameri
can Indian Movement-West's demonstra
tions this week in San Francisco at the San
Francisco Giants and Atlanta Braves games,
which will protest against racist imagery in
sports, specifically Atlanta's continued use of
the "Braves" mascot and the "tomahawk
chop."
