# Too Big to Fail
## Happy campers 
### 
Consistent with my recent trend towards
bodily imperilment for the sake of
"journalism." I decided to spend a day
enrolled in Camp Stanford and see what hap
pened.
If you're unfamiliar with ( amp Stanford,
it refers to the lifestyle of those lucky bastards
among us who have finished all. or most, of
their required classes a quarter prior to grad
uating.
In many ways. Camp Stanford is exactly
what you'd think naps, beer and mayhem.
However, when high achieving people com
mit wholeheartedly to doing nothing, it
makes for a strange situation. Mere hours
after confirming the date of my planned in
vestigation. I received an email from the
Camp Stanford listserv announcing my itiner
ary for the day. which ran from noon to mid
night.
I was excited, but somewhat incredulous:
Were even Campers too wound up from
years of jam-packed schedules to know how
to actually relax? Also, was this really a viable
way to spend an entire quarter at one of the
best universities in the world?
'Die next day. I arrived at I'residder for
lunch a( exactly 11:59 a.m..out of breath from
an inspired sprint down the Row. James Bar
ton '09 (as is everyone quoted in this column),
one of Camp Stanford's three self-appointed
"I lead Counselors" and my guide for the day,
sauntered in at 12:09.
Clearly, "itinerary" was a much more rela
tive term than I'd thought.
Like many "full-time campers." those 14S
seniors who are enrolled in no academic
classes this quarter. James chose to do ('amp
Stanford because his job. with Teach for
America, begins almost immediately follow
ing graduation. lor him. Camp Stanford was
his equivalent of a summer vacation.
"Day campers." those students who are

taking a reduced course load (read: a final
PoliSci class and fencing), do so for a variety
of reasons. Some are finishing honors theses,
some are already working and some are just
plain burned-out.
In any event. Camp Stanfordians are
rarely completely inert: the main difference
between them and the rest of us. James noted,
is frame of mind, l.ike us. they still have things
to do: unlike us. they refuse to get frazzled.
After lunch, we played racquetball. which
James described as the perfect Camp Stan
ford activity because it requires just enough
effort to leave you with a sense of accomplish
ment. but not so much that you feel drained.
"It's not too run-v." he said, wrinkling his nose
in distaste.
James won all three of our games handily.
Jack Cackler. who was also present, held his
own despite being forced (by me) to play with
his off-hand. I talked a lot of trash and scored
a total of two points.
Were I a camper, maybe I would have less
rage and more hand-eye coordination.
After racquetball. we continued onto the
Claw, where we were met by a group of
campers bearing inflatable rafts, speakers and
beer.There's nothing quite so ('amp Stanford
as drinking in a fountain while your friends
scurry between classes.
A successful Claw experience requires si
multaneously drinking and floating between
pithy conversations, while looking complete
ly nonchalant.
I. however, kept spilling my beer (cardinal
sin), then collided with the Claw itself in at
tempts to recover it (ouch).
Only after I resigned myself to clutching
the edge of the fountain was I able to actually
socialize with the other campers in atten
dance. For a while, we talked about Camp
Stanford: the perils of the 3 a.m. to noon sleep
schedule and the spring-quarter hookup fren

zy â€” were you aware?
Somehow, our conversation shifted to the
topic of community centers and diversity.
"You see," James proclaimed sagely, cracking
open another beer as he glided by,"When you
have down time, you can actually have inter
esting conversations. When you're working
too hard, you just complain about work."
Point taken.
Alter a much-needed nap break, we re
convened at Rose & Crown Trivia Night,
where my confusing Dispatch for Phish de
nied my team a free round of beer. Then
James invited me to a party, hut it was all I
could do to drag myself home.
It's easy to dismiss Camp Stanford as a
waste of time.There are so many great classes
to be had here, and let's be honest,you can be
drunk anywhere.
Still. 1 value Stanford just as much for my
peers as for the formal education I've re
ceived. As graduation approaches, I'm in
creasingly aware that 1 will never be in such
uniformly brilliant and entertaining company
ever again.
I'm not up to round-the-clock socializing,
but I enjoyed my Camp Stanford day
nonetheless. Even more importantly, howev
er. I realized that the Camp Stanford mental
ity of cheerful capriciousness isn't limited to
campers alone.
I may be enrolled in 21 units, but there's
nothing wrong with a little carpe diem now
and then.

Jenna would like to tluink James anil the rest of
the C amp Stanford community for a lovely day.
She apologizes for almost killing James multiple
times during racquetball. You can email her at
