# The
						Voice of Experience
## You soon will be, too 
### 
Over the last 15 weeks or so, I've tried to
pass on some of the knowledge I've
gained working in the "real world" for
10 \ears before returning to grad school. I'll
repeat what I said in my very first column,
which is that I don't pretend to know every
thing. or even a lot
I kit I do know a lew things. And I do know
what it's like to leave college. So I wanted to
share a few last tidbits ol wisdom with all the
graduating seniors, as well as with many
graduate students who perhaps haven't spent
that much time outside academia.
Plus, it's unlikely I'll ever be important
enough to be asked to give a commencement
address, so tins is my moment.
I irst. in terms of career, there are three
types ol graduating college seniors: Those
who know exactly what they want and are
going to do after college, those who aren't
sure but have picked something and those
who are completely clueless and afraid they
will end up living in their parents' basement
at age 30. surrounded by pi/za boxes and old
copies ol "People" magazine.
lb those of you who know exactly what
you want, congratulations. It's a gift to have
that certainty and to be passionate about
being a doctor, teacher, investment banker or
whatever you've chosen. My main piece of
advice is just to have a constant awareness
that you've chosen your path for the right
reason, and not because of the money, or
youi parents' expectations, etc. II that little
voice starts to nag you. listen to it. It might be
painful to change directions, but its a lot bet
ter than spending the next 35 years working
as an actuary when your heart is in interpre
tive dance.
lo those of you who aren't certain but
ha\e chosen a contingent path, good for you.
You're certainly not married to what you
choose, and people change careers many
times these days. I here are some employers
who will look down on a resume with a lot of
short jobs on it. but others will recognize it as
a sitjn ol someone who has a lot of interests

and is exploring their options. I think as long
as you're always honestly moving toward
some goal, it's OK to change direction once
the reasons for doing so become clear.
F inally, to those who have no clue, my
sympathies. It's difficult to find a path if
there's no clear favorite in your head. But the
good news is it's possible to pick a job or ca
reer and still get meaning out of it.even if it's
not your life's passion. And remember, every
single job or career is going to have some
lousy, tedious aspects to it. so don't confuse
disliking part of your job with hating the job
itself. So pick something, do it and make the
best of it. It's easier said than done, and I
don't mean to be glib, but there's really no
other way.
Moving on from careers, the other thing
that can get difficult out of college is your so
cial life. I he painful truth is it will never be as
easy to make friends as it is in college. Once
you get iÂ»ut of school, people tend to develop
their own lives and patterns.
Your early twenties is still a pretty social
time, but once you start getting into the mid
late twenties, people have spouses, demand
ing jobs and maybe even kids. I have four col
lege suitemates all living in New York City
who literally almost never see each other.
So my advice is to make the effort to meet
new people w hen you get out of school, and
don't just rely on seeing your college friends,
even if you're lucky enough to be in the same
location. You'll be amazed at how quickly
you'll wake up and discover your six best
friends have left the Bay Area and are now
respectively located in New York. London.
I long Kong, the Peace Corps, the I iimalayas
and somewhere in 1..A. wearing a really loud
shirt and trying desperately to get into the
Viper Room.
I inally, remember that things rarely turn
out the way you plan them. Tins is a particu
larly difficult lesson for high academic
achievers who have always been able to suc
ceed by planning and managing their time
and efforts. But the world is not a bin univer-

You're not given any
guidelines. You have
to make up the
problem sets and
solve them yourself.

sity. for better or worse.
You're not given any guidelines. You have
to make up the problem sets and solve them
yourself. And sometimes the results don't
turn out as you had expected.
So I think the one single best piece of ad
vice I can give to do your best.and let go of
the results. ITiey're often beyond your con
trol. anyway. Again, this is easier said than
done, but keep n in mind and I think it will
help you. Do your best, give yourself credit
for your efforts, allow yourself to feel happy
when things turn out your way. and when
they don't, accept responsibility and learn
from the experience, but don't punish your
self or wallow in regret.
Ciood luck to everyone; I sincerely wish
vou the best I "hanks for reading!
