## Why try to hide biases in sports? 
### 
M y Memorial Day Weekend
began with a moral dilem
ma and ended with sad
ness. I wrote last week
about how critical this past weekend
was to the Stanford sports season, and
unfortunately the weekend didn't go
so well.
I don't want to write a column
about the Stanford losses this past
weekend — and that is part of my
moral dilemma.
W hen I took a Sports Journalism
class freshman year (Comm 177S with
Gary Pomerantz — great class. 1 high
ly recommend it), the first reading we
had for the course was titled There's
No Cheering in the Press Box.
It is a pretty easy concept to grasp;
sports writers should not have a root
ing interest in the games that they are
covering because if they doit will influ
ence their coverage.
Iliis is where I hit a snag this week
end. however. As a student — and a
sports writer — at a small school, per
sonal relationships often supersede
objective journalism.
Many of the athletes on the field are
friends and dorm-mates. In my own
case. I live with a lot of Stanford ath
letes and truly want to see the best for
them.
I have covered the Stanford Softball
team for two seasons and fostered
friendships — both from being a
writer and from outside interaction —
with many of the women on the team.
Yet when 1 went to cover the team's
Super Regional game against Arizona
on Thursday. I made sure to wear a yel
low shirt, as yellow is not a color of
Stanford or Arizona.
But to say I wasn't rooting for Stan
ford is ludicrous. Yes. I refrained from
clapping when Missy Penna struck out
a batter or when Maddv Coon hit a
homerun.but in my heart. I was happy
that all of that happened.
Although this idea of an inherent
bias is amplified at the collegiate level,
who's to say it does not exist through
out all sports coverage? I 'll bet if you
spoke candidly — and off the record
with the (iiants beat writer for the
San Francisco C 'hronicle. he would say
that he wants the Giants to win every
game.
It is only logical. It is easier to inter
view coaches and players after wins.
Furthermore, readers want to read
happy stories, not stories about losses.
So why not acknowledge the root
ing interest instead of trying to fool
readers into believing that the writer
does not care what happens?
The more I think about it. the more
1 believe that as an honest writer 1 need
to acknowledge that. Sure, I am root
ing for a good story more than I am
rooting for a certain team, but basic
human nature causes people to pick
sides.
I understand this is a slippery slope.
I am by no means advocating all sports
journalists to turn into Hawk Harrel
son. the Chicago White Sox play-by
play announcer that may as well be a
diehard drunk Sox fan sitting in the
bleachers by the way he calls the
game.
That is bad journalism. But isn't it
also bad journalism to mask inherent
biases? Any person who can say they
have no opinion whatsoever on mat
ters in which they are commissioned to
write on has to be lying.
This is an ethical issue that extends
beyond sports |ournalism. Writers who
cover important political decisions
that could impact thousands of voters
have their own political leanings —
shouldn't readers be entitled to know
what those leanings are? Doesn't that
simply further inform readers?
My point is one that likely will
never be put into practice, but will al
ways be an undercurrent.
I was sad when the Stanford soft
ball team did not advance to the
Women's ( ollege World Series. I was
also sad when the Stanford baseball
team lost two out of three to Oregon
State this weekend. I was sad when
Alex Clayton lost in the quarterfinals
of Men's Tennis Championships and
when Hilary Bartc and Lindsay Bur
dettelost in the Women's Doubles Na
tional Championship.
I want to see them all succeed, and
something tells me I'm not the only
sports writer that feels that wav.

Dan liohm is a fan anil not ashamed to
admit it. Let him bum if that's coo! (or
not) at hohnuK" stanford.edu.
