In their fourth appearance at the
NCAA Championships in the past five
years, the No. 5 Stanford men's golf team is
in a tie for 22nd place with No. 2 Southern
California with a 21-over 305 on the day.
Only the top eight teams to emerge from
the regular medal play rounds will advance
to the match-play quarter and semi-finals
portion of the tournament. Yesterday's per
formance put Stanford in serious jeopardy
of not making the top-eight cut.
"That's the way golf goes," said coach
Conrad Ray. "The guys were pretty disap
pointed. We played well in our first nine
holes, but then we got to the back nine and
let a few balls go which cost us. We definite
ly will be working hard in the next few days
to make the cut number."
After IS holes of play, the top of the
ranks include: No. 4 Oklahoma State and
No. 1 Georgia in a lie for first with a four
over par 288; No. 28 Chattanooga in third
with an eight over 292: and No. 6 Washing
ton and unranked San Diego in a tie for
fourth with a nine-over 293.
No. 11 sophomore Steve Ziegler came
out on top today for the Cardinal,posting a
two-over 73 for the first round. Ziegler
struggled a little on the front nine, but
grabbed three birdies in the back nine to
put him in a tie for 29th.
Iliree strokes behind Ziegler is senior
captain Dodge Kemmer. Kemmer is cur-

rently in a tie for 75th with a five-over 76 on
the day. Lately. Kemmer has been heating
up,coming in a tie for fourth in the NCAA
Southwest Regional. Since this is his third
and last NCAA C hampionship. he will rely
on experience in the next few days to bring
up both his individual and team score.
Next in line in the Cardinal five is soph
omore Sihwan Kim. Kim is in a tie for 93rd
with a six over 77. Kim did well most of the
day.and was on par for most holes. Unfor
tunately. double bogeys on both the third
and six holes cost him a higher individual
finish.
Senior Daniel Lim and freshman David
Chung Â«were plagued with double bogeys
with Lim finishing with an eight-over 7 l )
and Chung with a l()-over finished his first
day on the links with an eight-over 1 ( ). I im
got two and Chung got three double bo
geys, all in their final nine holes.
Overall, Stanford struggled on their last
nine holes of the day. which has set them
back quite a bit. The team started off well
with an overall three-over par team score
after the first nine holes, but they couldn't
quite keep the momentum going.
"More than anything, the guvs are real
ly just try ing to play the golf course." Ray
said. "This course demands mental tough
ness and high quality shots which we just
couldn't hit today. On top of that, we are
facing typical Midwestern weather with
windy conditions and storms blowing
through."
"We need to play great [today]," Ray
