# Sailing has wind at its back

### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford athletics are loaded with
the most talented student-athletes in
the country. The Cardinal's often
mentioned streak of Director's Cups
indicates the school's prominence in
the collegiate sports community. Due
to the wide-ranging success, however,
certain teams are overshadowed by
the larger, more popular spectator
sports.
One of these squads has been fly
ing— or sailing — under the radar
for years.but has achieved much of the
same success as Stanford's other ath
letic teams.
Cardinal sailing has dominated the
West Coast. Often considered a sport
reserved only for students in the East,
Stanford is making a tremendous push
to change the public perspective.
There are two different categories
of collegiate sailing. Fleet racing is the
easier form of competition in theory.
Boats follow a marked course to the
finish. The first across the finish line
wins the race. Fleet regattas — the
term used for a sailing competition
usually last for two days, with the tro
phy going to the team with lowest
combined score.
Team racing appears similar, but
requires equally as much strategy. The
regatta consists of three boats against
three boats, and the lowest total score
for each team wins. Thus, boats finish
in first through sixth place and the var

ious finishing combinations allow for
teams to sail away victorious without
putting the first boat across the finish
line.
"Team racing is really different be
cause you're not just sailing the course
fast, you're also covering other boats
and covering the course," said fresh
man Ariane Fisher.
Sailing is often undervalued for its
difficulty. Athletes must not only be
able to execute complicated maneu
vers — You Tube a video of "tacking"
for proof—they must also have an
acute knowledge of atmospheric con
ditions, as a sudden change in wind can
completely alter race dynamics.
"Sailing is a great sport because it
truly combines mental and physical
skills." Fisher said.
Stanford has been dominant this
year as it continues to make its run
into the collegiate sailing postseason.
"Our team is performing well,"
said senior captain Kelly McKenna.
"We were one ol only eight teams in
the country to qualify for all three na
tional championships [which began
Tuesday in San Francisco]."
"We won our conference champi
onships both in the fall and in the
spring, and have been the top-ranked
team on the West Coast all year." slu
added.
I.ike all Stanford athletes, mem
bers of the Sailing team commit end
less hours to the sport. Practices run
for three hours at a time, five after
noons a week. In addition, the team

has morning practice at least once
each week.The dedication in the form
of nearly 2() hours of practice per week
translates intosuccesson the water for
the Cardinal.
I lowever. these triumphs have not
come without other obstacles. Stan
ford sailing is extremely young this
year — the team only has three sen
iors and two juniors. Inexperience
would haunt most teams, but the vet
eran leadership demonstrated by the
few older members of the Cardinal
has the team poised for success.
"I think the team is doing very well
this year, considering how young the
team is with mainly freshmen and

sophomores." said senior captain Tay
lor (i rimes.
Grimes, McKenna and the other
leaders are helping to prepare a
youthful bunch for the future. For
now. the Stanford sailing team will
look to advance at nationals, which the
team is hosting this year in San Fran
cisco.'l "he young sailors will attempt to
gain valuable postseason experience,
while the Cardinal vets look to end
their careers on a positive note.
"Right now I just want to enjoy my
last bit of college sailing." McKenna
said. "I have already accomplished a
lot,and have worked very hard the last
four years, so for nationals this year I

just want to have fun. sail my best and
not put any pressure on myself, be
cause that's when I sail best."
Sailing provides more drama than
meets the eye. With capsi/ing boats,
ever-changing conditions and narrow
finishes, regattas can instantly sway
opinion from that of a country-club
privilege to an aquatic war/one. Stan
ford sailing continues to progress
through the deep waters of collegiate
athletics, making a claim that it. too.
belongs in the category of the (Ordi
nal elite.

The Stanford sailing team competes in the St. Francis Invitational in a home meet in April. The team is relatively young,
but has been dominant on the West Coast this year, winning the Pacific Coast Collegiate Sailing Conference title.
