# STUDENT GROUPS
## Students call for end to image 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday at noon, students gath
ered in White Plaza to express their
growing concern over the cultural
insensitivity toward Stanford's Native
community. Standing in silent protest,
the 20 or so demonstrators carried
signs reading, "I am not your party
costume" and"I am not your mas
cot."
Their aim was to bring attention to
the concern caused by recent party
themes, special dinners and costumes
that have inaccurately represented
Native cultures. The demonstration
was also held as an act of solidarity
with the American Indian Movement
West (AIM West), which began a
three-day protest against mascots and
racism in sports on Monday. AIM
West organized a rally and boycott at
the San Francisco Giants vs. Atlanta
Braves game, criticizing the latter
team's use of an Indian caricature as
its mascot.
"It's been an ongoing issue here at

Stanford and around the country,"
said Leon Peralto '10. Co-chair of Hui
o Ha wan.
A junior majoring in anthropology
and Native American studies. Peralto
noted that students unwittingly
encourage stereotypes of native peo
ples when they don Pocahontas or
Lilo and Stitch costumes, and when
they attend parties that erroneously
depict indigenous cultures.
"Native peoples and other kinds
of marginalized peoples have been
represented in very inaccurate and
very disrespectful ways in the media,
in literature," Peralto said. "These
stereotypes that are created in the
media are reinforced and perpetuated
by a lot of things that people do in
their everyday life."
Fellow demonstrator and Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO) co-Chair Erika Chase '10
echoed these sentiments.
"I think that the underlying
[effects] of those things aren't really
known." said Chase, who is majoring
in Comparative Studies of Race and

Ethnicity."(Students don't know] how
bothersome it actually is to attend a
party and then see someone dressed
up in a way that is supposed to mock
who you are."
But the demonstration also high
lighted the remedies that can happen
in the future.
"We're hoping for a multi-level
response,"said Hui o Hawai'i co-chair
Mililani Trask-Batti '10. "First and
foremost, we want the students to
understand what we're doing. We're
not just a radical group of people who
think [that] no one can have fun at a
party."
Trask-Batti hopes that yesterday's
demonstration is the first step towards
an official University policy that pro
motes cultural sensitivity when dorms
and other organizations throw parties
and special events. Speaking on behalf
of her peers, Trask-Batti stated that it
would be a reassurance to have this
policy "officially written down as part
of some kind of document or guide
line to follow."
Trask-Batti also cited the impor

tance of collaborating with the Office
of Student Affairs (OSA) and the
ASSU's diversity outreach branch.
For the native community, lapses in
cultural sensitivity have been a long
standing problem.
"It's just a really frustrating thing
to see how these cycles are continu
ing." Chase commented, alluding to
Stanford's old mascot. Prince
Lightfoot. For Chase, yesterday's
demonstration brought to mind her
own mother's protest against Indian
college mascots in the '70s.

"She was part of the protests to get
that out of the system ," Chase said of
her mother. "[Today] I'm still doing
things like that and having to make
the same argument to the same like
minded people."
"These things shape the mindset of
our future leaders here at Stanford,"
Trask-Batti agreed. "We're not just
caricatures. We are a real people, with
a real culture."
