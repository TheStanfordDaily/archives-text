Education John Bravman and Vice Provost for
Budget and Auxiliaries Management Tim Warner
will he on hand tonight to answer students' budg
ets questions at the ASSIJ Executives' town hall. 5
p.m. in Old Union Room 2(K).
Vice President .lav de la Torre '10 said at last
night's Undergraduate Senate meeting that
administrators are set to address budget issues
with students, following on recent controversial
cuts.
"It'd be really great it we get a good turnout,"
de la Torre said. "Alter all three have made pre
sentations, we'll open the floor for questions."
following the meeting, a student forum will go
live on the ASSl J Web site, de la Torre added.
The Senate also unanimously confirmed an
expanded. 20 member Executive cabinet, an
increase from the 15-member cabinet of a year
ago.
Senators questioned de la Torre on the rea
soning behind an expanded cabinet, to which
President David Ciobaud 'OS M.S. '10 said he
would transfer $2,000 of Ins salary at last week's
meeting.
You guys have assembled a really exceptional
team, but it's going to be a big. big brood," said
Senatoi Zacli Wanna 11. "There have been times
I've heard from past administrations, even with
moderate-sized cabinets, things get lost."
"We felt |for| issues that required a little bit
more work, we felt the need for there to be co
chairs." de la Torre said.
Ilie Executives have added two cabinet posi
tions to address disabilities and accessible educa
tion, while Andy Parker Ml and Bennett Mauser
'10 will serve as co-chiefs of staff.
Senators also asked how the Executives would
keep their salaried cabinet members on task.
"Just thinking how much money is being given
to cabinet members, how are you going to hold
them accountable?" asked Senator Brian
Wanyoike '12.
"We do attempt to keep them accountable
using our platform as a means of saying.'These are
the things we want to accomplish,'" de la Torre
said.
Senator Adam Creasman 'II reported on a
meeting "he attended with representatives from
the Native American Cultural Center and the
OSA.
"They brought up some concerns I wasn't real-
Iv aware of concerning party themes, particularly
fraternities, regarding cultural identity," Creasman
said.
I responded to their concerns from the point
of view of social chairman," he continued. "I said
it's kind of a matter of freedom of speech. One
thing I said is there might be some senators inter
ested in working on some sort of cultural sensitiv
ity aspect of the AlcoholEdu program."
Senator Zachary Johnson '10 agreed there
was an issue, but questioned the AlcoholEdu
connection.
"There are some things that are clearly messed
up." he said. But addressing the issue through
AlcoholEdu seemed "kind of random." he added.
In other business, outgoing Senator l.uukas
lives '09 announced that Tim Ford
'10 and Devin Baneijeei 1 would be
nominated as co-directors of the
Publications Board next week:
Banerjee currently serves as Deputy
Editor for The Daily.
Senator Michael Cruz '12
announced that STAMP won the
ASSU's Volunteer Student
Organization (VSO) of the Year
award and that Professor Dan Klein
of the Drama Department won the
ASSU Teacher of the Year award.
Next up for the ASSU is Sunday's
policy summit, where Senator Alex
Katz '12 said 100 students and
administrators are expected to gath
er to set an agenda on broad topics,
ranging from sustainability to mental
health. Hie summit will begin at 11
a.m. in the Niterv at Old Union.
