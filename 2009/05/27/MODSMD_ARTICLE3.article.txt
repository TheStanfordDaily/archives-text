# Prop. 8 upheld by Supreme Court
## Students disappointed; rally blocks intersection 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Waving rainbow Hags and "No on Prop. <X" signs,
over 1(H) students blocked the intersection of Campus
Drive and Palm Drive for roughly 20 minutes during
lunchtime yesterday. Rally-goers, some donning wed
ding veils, denounced the 6-1 verdict released by the
California Supreme Court this morning, which upheld
the ban on same-sex marriage as ratified in the
November elections.
Aided by a blow horn and shouting,"Out of the lec
tures. into the streets," protestors marched up Lasuen
Mall, past the Oval, to the intersection. Following the
brief sit-in. the group trekked back to White Plaza
through the Main Quad, finally ending more than an
hour later at the Claw.
I"he atmosphere was filled with both disappoint
ment and determination, as attendees expressed dis
pleasure with the ruling, but pledged to overcome the
setback.
Although many were personally outraged at the
decision, the rally and sit-in progressed peacefully.
Stanford police followed the protesters throughout
their march and made no attempts to break up the
demonstration.
Event organizers, however, viewed the rally as a
commitment to future action, rather than a one-time
event. Various LGBT groups will be hosting related
events in the coming days to plan the next steps of the
campaign.

Tuesday's decision, written by California Supreme
Court Chief Justice Ronald M. George. defended the
will of the electorate.
Last November, in one of the most expensive cam

paigns and closely contested battles of the election. 52
percent of voters approved Proposition 8. restricting
the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples.
Immediately afterwards, opponents challenged the
measure on the grounds that it was an illegal revision
to the California Constitution, rather than an amend
ment. Measures that are considered revisions — or
ones that change fundamental rights — require a more
tedious approval process involving the state legislature.
But the Court disagreed.
"Contrary to petitioners' assertion. Proposition 8
does not entirely repeal or abrogate the aspect of a
same-sex couple's state constitutional right of privacy
and due process," George wrote in the court's opinion.
Therefore, the Court concluded that the measure was
an amendment, only requiring the majority vote of the
electorate.
Law Prof. Jane Schacter told The Daily she was not
surprised at the Court's ruling.
"(The judges] telegraphed their intentions very
clearly at the oral argument in March," she said. "I
think the decision was largely expected."
Campus minister Geoff Browning, with the United
Campus Christian Ministry, thought the Court could do
little to change the ruling at this juncture.
"I think [the Court] backed themselves into a cor
ner because they refused to hear this argument initial
ly. before the November vote." Browning said.
Supporters of same-sex marriage, though, counted a
small victory from the second half of the decision. The
Court ruled to uphold the 18.0(H) same-sex marriages
between June and November, during the brief window
when gay marriage was recognized in California.
"I think it's going to create a very odd situation
