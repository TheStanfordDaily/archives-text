# Prop. 8 upheld by Supreme Court
## Students disappointed; rally blocks intersection 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Waving rainbow Hags and "No on Prop. <X" signs,
over 1(H) students blocked the intersection of Campus
Drive and Palm Drive for roughly 20 minutes during
lunchtime yesterday. Rally-goers, some donning wed
ding veils, denounced the 6-1 verdict released by the
California Supreme Court this morning, which upheld
the ban on same-sex marriage as ratified in the
November elections.
Aided by a blow horn and shouting,"Out of the lec
tures. into the streets," protestors marched up Lasuen
Mall, past the Oval, to the intersection. Following the
brief sit-in. the group trekked back to White Plaza
through the Main Quad, finally ending more than an
hour later at the Claw.
I"he atmosphere was filled with both disappoint
ment and determination, as attendees expressed dis
pleasure with the ruling, but pledged to overcome the
setback.
Although many were personally outraged at the
decision, the rally and sit-in progressed peacefully.
Stanford police followed the protesters throughout
their march and made no attempts to break up the
demonstration.
Event organizers, however, viewed the rally as a
commitment to future action, rather than a one-time
event. Various LGBT groups will be hosting related
events in the coming days to plan the next steps of the
campaign.
I lie Killing
Tuesday's decision, written by California Supreme
Court Chief Justice Ronald M. George. defended the
will of the electorate.
Last November, in one of the most expensive cam

paigns and closely contested battles of the election. 52
percent of voters approved Proposition 8. restricting
the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples.
Immediately afterwards, opponents challenged the
measure on the grounds that it was an illegal revision
to the California Constitution, rather than an amend
ment. Measures that are considered revisions — or
ones that change fundamental rights — require a more
tedious approval process involving the state legislature.
But the Court disagreed.
"Contrary to petitioners' assertion. Proposition 8
does not entirely repeal or abrogate the aspect of a
same-sex couple's state constitutional right of privacy
and due process," George wrote in the court's opinion.
Therefore, the Court concluded that the measure was
an amendment, only requiring the majority vote of the
electorate.
Law Prof. Jane Schacter told The Daily she was not
surprised at the Court's ruling.
"(The judges] telegraphed their intentions very
clearly at the oral argument in March," she said. "I
think the decision was largely expected."
Campus minister Geoff Browning, with the United
Campus Christian Ministry, thought the Court could do
little to change the ruling at this juncture.
"I think [the Court] backed themselves into a cor
ner because they refused to hear this argument initial
ly. before the November vote." Browning said.
Supporters of same-sex marriage, though, counted a
small victory from the second half of the decision. The
Court ruled to uphold the 18.0(H) same-sex marriages
between June and November, during the brief window
when gay marriage was recognized in California.
"I think it's going to create a very odd situation

Students hold a candlelight vigil in White Plaza after a day of demonstrations against the California Supreme
Court's decision to uphold Prop. 8, which passed in the November 2008 election, banning same-sex marriage.
where you have 18.000 gay couples,
where they are married, and others
are domestic couples." Schacter said.
"I think what it ultimately is going to
do is help smooth the way to change
this outcome over the next couple
years."
She predicted that Prop. 8 would
be undone at the ballot box within
the next six years, saying it was "only
a matter of time."
Reactions
Same-sex marriage supporters
met the decision with varying levels
of shock. Some, like sociology co
term Aubrey Munoz '08 and Nina
Calantone '12 expected the Court's
ruling.
"Part of me was expecting so
much more, but given the battle
before Prop. 8 was passed. I guess
that the ruling is not that surprising."
Munoz said. "1 had really hoped it
would be overturned."
Calantone had hoped the Court
would "go the other way." but recog
nized that it was an uphill battle.
Others hoped the Court would
make their decision based on person
al ethics. Retired History Prof. Joel
Roberts, who founded the Stanford
Gay People's Union and taught gay
history, said he believed the Court
would overturn Prop. 8.
"I know the corporate media kept

saying it would end this way. yet I
didn't think they would go with this
crazy ruling." he said.'Tm shocked."
Fourth-year chemistry graduate
student Eric Hall, though, was less
upset with the judge's ruling.
"I personally disagree with Prop.
8, but I respect the rule of law and
the jackass initiative process." he
said. "Judges can only do so much."
The Rally
Before the decision had been
released, the Emma Goldman
Society for Queer Liberation and the
National Marriage Boycott had
planned to have a rally at noon yes
terday, regardless of the ruling.
Depending on the Court's verdict,
the rally would have either been a
celebration or a nonviolent protest.
By 11 a.m., organizers knew it
would have to be the latter, planning
their route around the Quad accord
ingly. along with a sit-in to block traf
fic at the intersection of Campus and
Palm Drive.
Amanda Gelender '10, one of the
planners of the event, said they were
"anticipating not to win" and pointed
to the challenges of mobilizing peo
ple a second time around.
Students wearing purple anti-
Prop. 8 shirts began to congregate in
White Plaza at noon. At 12:30 p.m.,
the group set off towards the Oval,
followed by campus police. Some
spectators clapped as the group
passed, while a few students walked
out of class to join the rally.
When protesters blocked off the
intersection, the police made no

move to remove the students, though
one policeman, armed with a cam
corder. filmed the sit-in and subse
quent march back to the Quad. The
police stationed themselves up Palm
Drive to redirect traffic away from
the intersection.
In contrast, San Francisco police
arrested around 175 protesters who
blocked off the major intersection of
Grove Street and Van Ness Avenue
yesterday morning.
For 20 minutes, the group refused
to let cars pass in either direction,
prompting one driver to yell, "Go to
Hell," as he made a U-turn. A few
other cars honked in support.
What's Next
While they differed in their reac
tions to the Prop. 8 decision, most
attendees promised to see the fight
out until the end.
"I'm pretty sure the next step is to
get another ballot measure," said
Jordan Price, a second-year
immunology graduate student. "The
issue is whether or not it will be 2010
or 2012. I think there is great
momentum right now."
Roberts said the struggle needed
"to move forward and not go back
into the past."
Next time around, though, he said
there needed to be more education
and attempts to raise awareness.
Browning agreed with that strate
gy. saying that friendships with gay
people would make it easier for the
population to see that everyone
deserved the same rights. Browning,
as a minister, also combats the

stereotype that all religions are hos
tile to same-sex marriage.
To his opponents, he said, "I say
it's not about sex, it's about love."
Organizers themselves aren't sure
what the next step is, though they
promoted the National Marriage
Boycott during the rally. Already
having spread to seven other cam
puses, the boycott is supposed to be
adopted in solidarity with same-sex
couples denied the right to marry.
Other events planned included a
night candlelit vigil in White Plaza
last night and an open forum in the
Women's Community Center at 9
p.m. tonight.
ASSU Executives David Gobaud
"OS M.S. '10 and Jay de la Torre '10
also attended the rally and pledged
their support of future initiatives. De
la Torre said he would work with leg
islative bodies and VSOs to find the
best course of action.
"Prop. 8 is an issue that specifical
ly affects the rights of Stanford stu
dents on campus," de la Torre said.
"Our responsibility is to protect
those rights as elected officials."
De la Torre, who has an uncle that
married during the interim period
when same-sex marriages were legal,
said that advocacy and awareness
were necessary for Prop. 8 to be
overturned.
"1 feel that when people find out,
when they know someone that's
affected by this, it's something that's
very powerful," he said.
