## Kal Penn talks Hollywood stereotypes 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
lie's been to White Castle. He's made it to
(iuantanamo and back. But yesterday, he came
to Kresge Auditorium on a more academic mis
sion. Actor Kalpen Suresh Modi, commonly
known as Kal Penn, spoke on campus yesterday
about his experiences as an Asian-American
aetoi in the film industry, focusing on a sociology
perspective interspersed with humorous remi
nisces.
One of the best known Indian-American
actors today, Penn is also an adjunct lecturer at
the I Jniversity of Pennsylvania, where he teaches
media studies, and the incoming associate direc
tor of the White House Office of Public

Engagement (OPE) for the Obania administra
tion.
Penn opened up his lecture with an analytical
look at the way ethnicity shaped his time in
Hollywood. A few minutes into the talk, he
recalled once being referred to as "Kal Penn. the
Indian-American actor."
"I'm the Indian-American actor?" he asked
with a laugh. "Why do we feel the need to signify
that?"
As one of the few Indian American actors to
break into Hollywood. Penn offered a unique
perspective on the way media can both reinforce
and break stereotypes. He used his background
in sociology, the subject he majored in at IJt lA.
to explain the social forces at work behind
minority roles in Hollywood.

"People talk about race, ethnicity and gender
because the media focuses on it."he explained.
"The media play a role in socializing us into our
own culture."
Since the media so rarely portrays minorities
in leading roles. Penn pointed out that any media
portrayal of a minority is often seen as a repre
sentation of that ethnic group instead of purely
entertainment. That is. while most audiences will
view a white character as simply a character in a
film, audiences often see minority characters as
representative of their entire ethnic group.
This has led to some amusing exchanges
between Penn and community groups.
