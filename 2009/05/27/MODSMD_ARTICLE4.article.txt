## Kal Penn talks Hollywood stereotypes 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
lie's been to White Castle. He's made it to
(iuantanamo and back. But yesterday, he came
to Kresge Auditorium on a more academic mis
sion. Actor Kalpen Suresh Modi, commonly
known as Kal Penn, spoke on campus yesterday
about his experiences as an Asian-American
aetoi in the film industry, focusing on a sociology
perspective interspersed with humorous remi
nisces.
One of the best known Indian-American
actors today, Penn is also an adjunct lecturer at
the I Jniversity of Pennsylvania, where he teaches
media studies, and the incoming associate direc
tor of the White House Office of Public

Engagement (OPE) for the Obania administra
tion.
Penn opened up his lecture with an analytical
look at the way ethnicity shaped his time in
Hollywood. A few minutes into the talk, he
recalled once being referred to as "Kal Penn. the
Indian-American actor."
"I'm the Indian-American actor?" he asked
with a laugh. "Why do we feel the need to signify
that?"
As one of the few Indian American actors to
break into Hollywood. Penn offered a unique
perspective on the way media can both reinforce
and break stereotypes. He used his background
in sociology, the subject he majored in at IJt lA.
to explain the social forces at work behind
minority roles in Hollywood.

"People talk about race, ethnicity and gender
because the media focuses on it."he explained.
"The media play a role in socializing us into our
own culture."
Since the media so rarely portrays minorities
in leading roles. Penn pointed out that any media
portrayal of a minority is often seen as a repre
sentation of that ethnic group instead of purely
entertainment. That is. while most audiences will
view a white character as simply a character in a
film, audiences often see minority characters as
representative of their entire ethnic group.
This has led to some amusing exchanges
between Penn and community groups.
After the release of "Harold and Kumar Go

Go to White Castle," speaks about the growing problem of Asian-American
stereotypes in the media and film industry yesterday afternoon.
to White Castle," Penn received an
open letter by an Asian-American
group who was offended by the
film's portrayal of the two main
characters, Harold and Kumar, who
are Asian-American and Indian-
American, respectively.
The group complained that
Harold's and Kumar's characters
were misogynistic and negative
portrayals of Asian-Americans. Kal
Penn read aloud the letter at the
lecture, and then read his response
to it, which emphasized that minor
ity characters shouldn't be defined
by their ethnicity.
"[Kumar] smokes ganja because
he likes it. not because he's Indian."
he quipped.
Although Penn was ultimately
optimistic about the growing pres
ence of minorities in the media, he
noted that there were still stereo
types to overcome regarding ethnic
diversity and equality.
"The fact that we still add modi
fiers to the word 'American' to
make 'Asian-American' and
'Indian-American' means that
we're still defined ethnically and
not nationally." he said.
During the following question
and-answer session, Penn
addressed more casual questions
about his film work and his upcom
ing job with the Obama administra
tion.
When Penn was accepted for the
position within the White House
OPE, his character Lawrence
Kutner had to be written out of the
show "House." When asked if he
had a say in how his character died,
Penn explained with a laugh that he
had no input, and that the charac
ter's death was unfortunately per
manent.
"It's not like on 'Lost' where you
can still come back to the show." he
joked. "I can't say,' Hey! Write me
back in as a ghost!"'
In regards to his upcoming job
with the Obama administration.
Penn was very careful to avoid
speaking as a representative for the
President or his administration, but
explained that he was inspired by
Obama's campaign and. after work
ing on the campaign for two years,
applied for the position within the

OPE.
He'll he starting work later this
year.
"[OPE] is the proverbial 'front
door' to the White House, designed
to assure that every American has a
seat at the table, and the opportuni
ty to have ler or his voice heard."
Penn wrote in a later email to The
Daily. "I'm going to be the point
person for the Arts Community and
Asian Pacific Islander Americans."
Penn assured the audience that
he wasn't interested in running for
office and didn't have any higher
political aspirations, and even
expressed an interest in teaching
again in the future — though he
doesn't have any concrete plans
yet. something many undergradu
ates can appreciate.
"I really don't have a master plan
— I don't know if I'll be returning
[to acting] in one, two, five years,"
Penn said with a laugh. "It's really
ill-thought-out, and my parents just
hate that."
