## GSB appoints new dean Garth Soloner Ph.D. '82 replaces Dean Robert Joss, begins term Sept. 1 
### JOANNA XU MANAGING EDITOR 
Economist Garth Saloner Ph.D. '82 was named the ninth
dean of Stanford's Graduate School of Business (GSB) yes
terday. Saloner. who is currently a professor of Electronic
Commerce, Strategic Management and Economics at the
GSB. and a director of the University's Center for
Entrepreneurial Studies, will begin his term on Sept. 1.
Current GSB Dean Robert Joss announced in
September of last year that he would be stepping down after
10 years at his post. A search committee was then formed to
consider candidates that could replace Joss.
Search committee co-chair and GSB Prof. John Roberts
said that Saloner was chosen in part due to his understand
ing of the GSB. leadership in reviewing and overhauling the
MBA curriculum and strong business community ties, par
ticularly with the entrepreneurial community in Silicon
Valley.
"In the last couple of years, we've made a lot of big
changes, re-vamped our curriculum, making it distinct from
anyone else's, creating a new campus, and we're sort of
halfway through a lot of things, many of which Prof. Saloner
has been integral in." Roberts told The Daily. "We felt the
need not for external connections as much as for someone
who understood the school and what was happening."
Saloner earned a Ph.D. in Economics, Business and
Public Relations from Stanford in 1982. then went onto
become a tenured professor at MIT at both the Sloan
School of Management and the economics department. He
has been teaching at Stanford since 1990.
Despite his academic background. Saloner said his pro
gression towards managerial positions has been steady.
"I've taken a variety of administrative challenges at
Stanford, as associate dean and leader of the curriculum task
force." he said. "This feels like a natural progression in my
career."
The selection process for a new dean occurred mostly
over the course of December to March.
"We spent a long time talking to various constituents
from the school, alumni, staff, students, to get their input on
how they thought the school was doing." Roberts said. "We
sought nominations. At one point, we had around 1(H) nom
inations."
However, the search committee did not make the final
selection. After deliberation, the committee submitted a list
of candidates to President Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy, who made the final decision.
"Many of the nominees were business leaders, not aca
demics," Roberts said. "Other schools usually only consider
faculty as candidates for deans. But it's been a long tradition
in business schools to select business leaders as deans."
ITiis was true of Joss, who was a global banker prior to
becoming dean of the GSB.
One of the largest challenges that Saloner will face upon
becoming dean, himself, is the budget. The GSB endowment
has shrunk roughly 30 percent in the past year, and annual
giving from alumni is also decreasing.
"Dean Joss jumped on the problem very quickly, and
we've already taken significant reductions in our budget that
involved staff reductions." Saloner said. "Those will carry on
into next year. We have already brought our budget in line
with what we expect our funds to be. even taking into
account the endowment drop."
Saloner also hopes to advance research and curriculum
changes at the GSB.
"A big challenge for business schools right now is. how do
we create the kind of frameworks that are necessary for
leaders of managed organizations to
better perform their functions?
That's the research challenge,"
Saloner said. "On the teaching side,
the last few years have shown us that
future leaders will have to be really
principled, analytical thinkers on top
of being masters of disciplinary and
functional areas. That's what we're
trying to achieve in the new GSB
curriculum."
Saloner is also confident in a
smooth transition, as he considers
his family — which includes a
daughter in the Class of 2013 and
another daughter who is a current
GSB student — and himself to be
fully nested at Stanford already.
"The advantage of being some
body who's taking this job from the
inside is that I'm already here and
I'll be here through the summer,
when I'll have time to think about
what I want to accomplish in the first
few months," Saloner said.
