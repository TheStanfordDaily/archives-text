## Lofgren promotes immigration reform 
### ELLEN DANFORD 
Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren '70
of the 16th District of California paid
her alma mater a visit yesterday to
speak to the Stanford Immigrant
Rights Project (SIRP). a newly
formed student group which focuses
on raising awareness on immigrant
related issues.
Lofgren addressed her work as
the chair of the Immigration
Subcommittee in the House of
Representatives, as well as her hopes
for future immigration law reform.

"We did some things in the'% act
that were truly dysfunctional"
Lofgren said, citing the Illegal
Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act of 19%.
According to Lofgren. the act,
which precluded immigrants from
obtaining a visa for three years if
they had been in the country illegal
ly for six months, or for 10 years if
they had been in the country for 10
years, encouraged law-breaking and
the separation of families.
"President Bush lacked the polit
ical skills to do anything about it."

she said.
Lofgren. who said her grandfa
ther immigrated to the U.S. with only
$20, firmly believes that immigrants
played a key role in shaping the
nation.
"One of the things that occurred
to me as I grew up was how much
immigrants have really made this
country." Lofgren said. "The things
that people think are the best things
about America — hard work, deter
mination — came from immigrants."
Yet despite the immigrant foun
dation. Lofgren believed that about

30 percent of the population is wary
of immigration. She attributed this
concern to the belief that immigrants
take away jobs in the already shrink
ing job market.
Lofgren has dedicated her time to
changing these impressions, which,
according to her, were fostered by an
administration that failed to act.
"We started to see a situation
where the Democrats made further
concessions to the Republicans,"
Lofgren said of the Bush administra
tion, adding that as the reason for
why no significant immigration
reforms were passed during the
110 th Congress.
"It is a big enough issue that you
need to have bipartisan support,"
she continued. "But now, we also
have a new President who says he
wants to have immigration reform."
SIRP is currently promoting such
change. For example, the group
formed an Alternative Spring Break
(ASB) group that traveled to
Arizona to study immigration poli
cy.
"The first step is gathering minds
around the issue," said Andy
Cantero "12. "We created a group to
bring people together to learn about
it."
With an eye to the future,
Lofgren is angling for the passage of
the Development. Relief and
Education for Alien Minors

(DREAM) Act. This legislation
focuses on helping the children of
immigrants become citizens if they
enroll in two years of higher educa
tion or military service. She believes
that education is key in allowing
immigrants to add to the American
workforce and boost the current
economy.
"We will have a meeting on June
8 at the White House to see if we
can make progress and get the com
prehensive reform bill done,"
Lofgren added.
The Congresswoman also plans
to tell President Obama that his
plans for universal healthcare will
not work unless the 12 million ille
gal immigrants are allowed to work
to get their green cards and get
healthcare as well. Otherwise, the
health care would not be universal.
Lofgren was hopeful, then, that
immigration reform would pass
sooner rather than later.
"Is this the year to get it done?"
she asked."! definitely hope so!"
