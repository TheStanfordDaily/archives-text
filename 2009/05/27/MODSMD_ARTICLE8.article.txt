## EDITORIAL Honorary degrees devalue the work of real graduates 
### 
Arizona State I Jniversity's recent deci
sion to deny President Baraek
.Obama an honorary degree for
speaking a! commencement on the grounds
thai "his body of work is yet to come" was
widely ridiculed." Ihe Daily Show" took to
the hallowed halls of ASH. where several
inept students offered their opinion that
while President Obama was undeserving,
"Presidents Benjamin I ranklin and Alexan
der Hamilton" most certainly were. Lost in
the uproar was an important question —
what purpose does an honorary degree
serve?
I lie practice of awarding degrees honoris
cttusti dates back to medieval times. In 1470.
Lionel Wood\ille subsequently the Bish
op of Salisbury was supposedly the first to
receive such a degree when he received one
from ()xford. In modern times, honorary de
grees are typically awarded to visiting digni
taries on occasions such as the one President
()bama was in\ ited to speak at. namely com
mencement exercises. Unless a degree is
awarded to a particularly controversial fig
ure as vvas the case in 200N when Washing
ton University in St. Louis bestowed one
upon conservative activist and Lqual Rights
Amendment opponent Phyllis Sehlafly —
they typically cause hardly a ripple.
But David Starr Jordan. Stanford's first
president, offered another perspective. Jor
dan wrote in his memoirs."l still believe that
every academic degree should represent
work actually done in or under the direction
of the institution governing it... It seems to
me to give the university a certain dignity as
existing for purposes of instruction, not for
confer! ing honors on outside persons." 112 rom
the perspective of the editorial board.Jordan
is exactly i ight.
We at Stanford as well as students at
countless other institutions spend a great
deal ol time and effort immersed in our aca
demic studies. When we graduate.our degrees
are a testament to caffeine-fueled, late-night
papers, complex problem sets and group proj
ects. in addition to juggling extracurricular
and social commitments. lb hand a piece of
paper to a visiting speaker, however impres
sive, diminishes the significance of a Stanford
degree. It is not a matter of elitism, but one of
emphasizing the hard work and dedication
that a degree symbolizes.
Jordan's decision to adopt "the Cornell
rule that no honorary degree or degrees for
studies carried 011 in absentia should be

awarded" understands that universities are
places for learning, not degree factories. Es
tablished at Stanford's founding, this rule
continues to uphold the importance of an ac
tual university degree.
Moreover. Jordan, who noted that "this
regulation has saved us much pressure from
various quarters." would no doubt appreciate
being spared the public relations nightmare
ASIJ has had to face. Many uate ASU alum
ni are currently withholding donations and
mailing their own degrees to President
Obama: one alumnus is even writing ASU
out of her will. Likewise. Notre Dame's deci
sion to bestow an honorary degree on
Obama — whose pro-choice stance is anath
ema to many of the nation's Catholics — in
furiated many of their alumni as well. The
politics that accompany such degrees are
simply that — politics. The editorial board
believes that an academic degree should be
untainted by political considerations.
Stanford has developed another method
of honoring those "who have rendered
unique and outstanding service to the Uni
versity." Ihe Degree of Uncommon
Man/Woman, created in 1953. has been spo
radically bestowed on such Stanford pillars
as Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel, Herbert Hoover,
Frederick H. Terman. William R. Hewlett.
David Packard, Peter S. Bing and. most re
cently. John Arrillaga.
By creating an alternative means of recog
nizing Stanford luminaries, Stanford is able
to simultaneously honor achievement and
service to the University, without devaluing
an academic degree. Moreover, the Uncom
mon Man/Woman degree is given to alumni,
who naturally possess their own Stanford de
grees.
Hie University should be honored for re
specting the "dignity" of a Stanford degree
and eschewing the pettiness of honorary de
grees. When Supreme Court Justice Anthony
Kennedy "5S addresses our graduating sen
iors in a few weeks and leaves degree-less, let
us remember what President ()bama told
ASIJ. "that despite having achieved a re
markable milestone, one that you and your
families are rightfully proud of. you tot) can
not rest 011 your laurels. Your body of work is
vet to come."
Let the Class of 2009 depart Stanford,
hard-earned diplomas in hand, and do them
selves. their families and the University
proud. It is what we do with ourselves, not the
honors we rack up, that matters.
