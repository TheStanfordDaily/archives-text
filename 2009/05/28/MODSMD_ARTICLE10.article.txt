## Nicole Demby Stanford and the art of motorcycle maintenance 
### 
Atypical morning for me might consist
of waking up. checking my email,
drinking a cup of coffee, doing some
reading for class and grabbing a bowl of ce
real before heading off to an 11 a.m. lecture.
On my way out of the house. I'm likely tosee
Joey D in the Theta Chi courtyard working
lovingly on the motorcycle he is turning from
a beat up old I londa into a work of mechan
ical art.
Joev is not a Stanford student. 1 le's a tor
mer lighting designer for the likes of the
New York City Ballet and the Metropolitan
Opera who moved to Palo Alto to be with
his girlfriend, a law student here. Not only is
he a great guy (o sit and talk to. but he got
bored the other week and fixed our lawn
mower and a door that had been broken all
year.
While he builds his bike. I Hit in and out
of cyberworld, taking breaks to fill my head
with immaterial knowledge that I ultimate
ly use to produce a bunch of text printed on
paper. Joey D's presence outside my door in
the XOX courtyard in the morning alludes
to what my daily life largely lacks — knowl
edge or connection to many of the materials
1 encounter and use every day.
Matthew B. Crawford published an arti
cle in this past weekend's New York limes
Magazine entitled "The Case For Working
With your I lands." In it he discusses his own
life as a I Jniversity of Chicago alum and for
mer think tank executive who now owns a
vintage motorcycle shop, lie laments the
disappearance of shop classes and the cul
tural preference for "knowledge work re
inforced by the assumption that any manual
work is menial labor taken up as a last re
sort. lie makes the case that jobs like the
one he held formerly foster disingenuous
and compromising intellectual habits, while
his work with bikes continually challenges
him and forces him to think critically and be
decisive.
Crawford's characterization of all office
work as necessarily taking place in the cubi
cle seems a bit outdated. Ii recalls a time
when the dreaded cubicle was ripe in the
cultural imagination as the symbol of the
oppression of banality. Satirized in Dilbert,
portrayed as soul denying in The Matrix
and rebelled against in Office Space, the of

fice cubicle meant everything dull, isolating
and static — a prison cell masquerading as a
work environment.
Yet there's something to be said for his
argument that we place a primacy on knowl
edge production over material production
to the detriment of a relationship with, and
knowledge of. more material things. From
my own limited experience with woodcut
ting. welding and casting in the studio art
classes I've taken. I can intimate the satisfac
tion an expert like Crawford derives from
his work. Precisely because I spend so much
time using my brain for abstract things and
not doing so much with my hands except
bite my nails, it feels so good to get the op
portunity to actually make something with
them. Ignoring the politics of different kinds
of economic labor, there's something that
feels si) much more intimate and that comes
from a place much more instinctual about
making something come to be with ham
mers and nails than with my brain and a lap
top.
I envy the product designers and robot
builders, electrical engineers and sculptors
here who possess a real understanding of
how objects work. Most of us are so alienat
ed from so many of the things we rely on in
our daily lives. We can wax poetic about the
Homerian epics, recount the chronology of
World War Two or generate pages of virtual
coda, but we probably can't tell you the first
thing about how our car works.
Especially at Stanford, there is so much
we take for granted. University staff trims
our lawns, fixes our washing machines and
often cooks for us so we are free to work to
ward becoming the next generation of pres
tigious "knowledge workers." I'm not saying
we should all leave our respective fields and
become plumbers and auto mechanics. 1 do.
however, wish we were required to take
some sort of shop class here a Stanford. I
think we would all benefit from a required
class that forces us to work with our hands,
be it gardening, motorcycle mechanics,
sewing, woodworking.etc., to remind us that
we're not just floating brains but people
with hands capable of making useful things.
