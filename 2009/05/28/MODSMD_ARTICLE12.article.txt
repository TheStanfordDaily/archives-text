## The
						future of the news industry, and what it means to the It Generation 
### 
The future of news is in trouble. No, not
newspapers. I'm talking about the news.
All of it. Television, radio, news maga
zines— you name it. they're all in trouble.
And that could be the worst news our soci
ety's gotten in a long time.
Let me explain why.
Last Wednesday, Roberta Baskin, an in
vestigative television journalist who has
worked and reported for both national and
local news, gave a guest lecture in a course I
am taking entitled."The Modern 1 listory and
Future of Journalism," taught by Prof. Joel
Brinkley. Ms. Baskin has won numerous
prestigious awards for her reporting, includ
ing several Emmy awards.
During her lecture. Ms. Baskin told us a
story that shocked me. In January of this year,
working for WJLA-TV (an ABC affiliate in
Washington, D.C.). she was awarded the
prestigious duPont-Columbia University
award for her journalistic work. The very
next day, upon returning to her office, her
boss told her she was being laid off. along
with the entire investigative team for the sta
tion. The boss' reason? The station simply
couldn't afford the "luxury" of investigative
news anymore. Instead, the boss said, the
local news broadcast would now be relying
on the three-tiered plan of "personality, pop
culture and big grabs" — essentially code for
celebrity news.
The idea of investigative news being
somehow considered a "luxury" had me cap
tivated because of what it means to the future
of news, and the harm it may cause society.To
understand how this can happen to televi
sion, it might be helpful to first take a deeper
look at exactly why it is newspapers are fail
ing. since the two are inextricably inter
twined.
Recently there have been murmurings
across the Bay Area that the San Francisco
Chronicle, my local newspaper, may soon be
forced to close its doors, making the city of
San Francisco the first major city in the coun
try without at least one daily newspaper
(other newspapers to fold or file for bank
ruptcy, such as the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
and the Rocky Mountain Times, had compe
tition from at least one other daily newspa
per in their respective cities). Only newspa
per in a major city or otherwise, however, the
Chronicle would not be the first daily news
paper to fall.and it likely wouldn't be the last.
Any cursory study of the newspaper in
dustry's business model displays that it is not
just this recent downturn in the economy that
has brought the newspaper industry to its
knees. There have been faults in the hard
news business model going back well over a
decade. It was cable news and internet taking
slices out of the market; it was profit-ob
sessed conglomerates buying dozens of
newspapers at a time, cutting costs and slash
ing journalism jobs at the expense of main
taining a quality product that served as a
public good for a community; and perhaps
most lethal ofall.it was the dramatic, and for
some, fatal, loss of ad revenue to better,
newer,cheaper substitutes, such asCraigslist.
The newspaper industry's hardships we set
now were a long time coming.The business is
crumbling, and no one seems to know quite
how to buck the trend.
When confronted with the news that the
San Francisco Chronicle may be going under,
San Francisco mayor and California guber
natorial candidate Gavin Newsoni was quot
ed as saying that "no one under 30 would
even notice."
Well. I'm sorry. Mr. Mayor, but to this 22-
year-old. you're dead wrong, and here's why:
according to a recent syndicated column by
Prof. Brinkley. several studies have displayed
that "more than three-quarters of the news
you see, hear and read anywhere is at least
derivative of something that originally ap
peared in a newspaper."That's right —even
if you get your news from the Internet, that
news most likely was brought to light by
newspapers. As things stand now. it is not an
overstatement to say that the failure of the
newspaper industry likely spells the failure of

the news industry.
And so. when not only do these newspa
per corporations have to close their doors,
but even investigative television journalism
is considered too luxurious to he affordable,
you have a real problem on your hands. It
doesn't matter how old you are: the Internet
simply isn't ready to fill the void that laid off
investigative journalists in other formats will
leave.
In fact, right now. nothing can. To the
younger news formats, it's simply too costly,
and the infrastructure is not in place. And
that leaves us in a very scary place, because
WJLA. Roberta Baskin's former employer,
is but one example of the many stations that
used to give more weight to hard news, but
have now decided.or will soon decide, to give
more airtime to the cheap alternative of the
"personality, pop culture and big grabs" for
mula.
"TMZ." "Hollywood Extra." "E! News."
Will we soon be lumping news broadcasts
into the same category? Celebrity news is
cheap, but it generates ratings. Television
news managers and consultants know it.and
several news stations across the country have
already begun their foray into the world of
celebrity news.The impact that this renewed
celebrity infatuation will have in shaping our
society is far-reaching and worrisome.
We are already a culture of narcissists, to
borrow a term from Christopher Lasch. We
are the bearers of a new "Me Generation."'
No. perhaps we are worse — an "It Genera
tion." We narcissists can no longer see other
people for as their own ends, but only in
terms of what that person reflects about our
selves. ITiese celebrities we so admire are not
even people to us.They are merely a series of
"Its" — status symbols that we seek to attain
for ourselves.The search to achieve this "It"
status has pervaded the culture and extend
beyond mere celebrity infatuation. The peo
ple with whom we interact become other
forms of "It" — other symbols of status in
our own social hierarchy that either help or
hinder our quest to achieve whatever status
we desire. And now news is seeking to exploit
our "It" infatuation by giving us exactly what
we want: more of "It." More of this infatua
tion with status. Not with people: with status.
As this generation's bearers, we are a cul
ture unreasonably, disgustingly obsessed
with celebrity ("New Scientist"Magazine re
ported in 2003 that, according to studies per
formed bv a psychologist at the University of
Illinois School of Medicine, one out of everv

three Americans has what is termed
"Celebrity Worship Syndrome"). Why?
What does celebration of celebrity offer us,
other than thinly veiled jealousy? What is a
single defensible reason for caring what kind
of a neighbor Paris Hilton is or whose panties
Lindsay Lohan isn't wearing? (clue: her
own.) Are our own lives so damn boring, ster
ile and banal that we have to live through
someone else's? Whatever the reason, news
stations appear ready to pounce and feed on
our frenzy, deepening our societal illness.
Unfortunately, no one seems to either
care enough or have enough willpower to say
no. these celebrities are not worth our time;
no. we will not continue to care what the hell
any of them are doing: and no. TMZ and
Perez Hilton (not to mention Paris) do not
contribute a single thing to our lives, and we
will not permit our hard news to continue
going in the same direction. Let us accept the
obvious: that the entire industry of celebrity
news is based on nothing!
We are looking at this nothing as the po
tential future of news. When will we take the
blinders off? Because until we do. until view
ers begin to demand some real news in their
lives and vote with our remotes against "Hol
lywood Extra." "Keeping up with the Kar
dashians" and anything that has ever aired on
the E! Channel.this is what we will be fed.
In the process, it will further the material
ism and shallowness that allows us to care as
much about Jessica Simpson's weight as
North Korea's nukes. Indeed it is the very
same materialism and shallowness that made
Jessica Simpson's personal life relevant in
the first place. And as a society, what that will
mean is the expansion, and continued exalta
tion. of vacuous, obsessive thoughts of "It."
and whether we have the"It" status we so
desperately desire.
This is what the future of news may mean
for us if the current trend continues and the
newspaper industry fails. When it happens, it
won't be news to me. Indeed, there won't re
ally be news at all.
Well, not exactly; there will, of course, still
be real issues in our world. Corporations will
exploit, politicians will defraud and people
will lie. cheat and steal. The question is
whether there will still be anyone to report it.

Mark can happily report that an L.A. Times
hlog is reporting that Jessica Simpson is unin
teresting. In a related story, then why the f*&#
are yon writing about her? One last thought:
South Park Season Eight. Episode 12. Just
watch it. mrilonie@stanford.edu.
