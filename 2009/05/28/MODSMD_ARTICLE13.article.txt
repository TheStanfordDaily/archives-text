relaxed and fun

like a job I wasn't
getting paid for."

112 the many existing sports in Stanford's
JKT club athletic program, the baseball team
H is one of the school's newest and fastest
growing student-run teams.
Stanford club baseball was established during the fall
of 2006 by two groups, one comprised of freshmen living
in Larkin at the time, the other including then-sopho
more Mark Donig *09 and first-vear law student Andrew
HallM.S.m
The freshmen (now juniors — Jack Lazarus. Michael
Sylvan. Alex Ackerman-Greenberg, Daniel Bohm.Colin
Penrose and Sean Beausoleil — had played baseball and
high school and wanted to continue playing. Hall had
played club baseball as an undergraduate at the Univer
sity of Virginia, and was

surprised there wasn't a
team at Stanford.
The administration
suggested that these two
groups establish a new
team together. Hall and
Lazarus were president
and vice-president, re
spectively. and spent the
2006-2007 school year
gauging student interest,
collecting funds and se
curing playing space.
"Putting together the
team was a lot of work,
hut we all thought it was
important for Stanford
to offer students an op
portunity to play com
petitive baseball at a
non-varsity level," said
Hall, the current presi
dent and coach of the
team.
During fall 2007. the

newly established club
baseball team joined the National Club Baseball Associ
ation. an organization that schedules games between
university club baseball teams. Stanford's club team
competes in the Southern Pacific North Conference,
which consists of Berkeley. l/(-Santa Cruz. LJC-Davis.
UC-Merced and Humboldt State. Stanford also plays
games with teams in the Southern Pacific C onference. in
spring of 20()<S. Stanford club baseball played its first
game against I JCLA.
One of the main differences between Stanford's club
and varsity baseball teams is that the club team is stu-

dent-run.
"The club team receives minimal fund
ing from the University," Hall said. "The
majority of the funding comes from player
dues and fundraising."
Not only does the club team have to
find its own funding, but it is also in
charge of its own scheduling and prac- A
tice times. M

"We are completely self-governed
and do not recruit at all," said
Lazarus, who plays left field and first
base. "We coach ourselves and or
ganize everything else ourselves. We
alone are responsible for fundrais
ing.scheduling and ordering equip
mpnt " A

mem.
The other major difference
between the club and varsity
baseball teams is the level of i

compeuuveness.
"The players are less tal
ented and not recruited to
play." Hall said. "Thus, the
quality of play is below the
level of a Division-1 varsi
ty baseball team, though it
might be on par with Divi-

sion-II varsity baseball."
There are also tryouts for the team, but no one is cut.
"Everyone who wants to play is invited to join the
team." I lall said."Practices are open to new participants,
and players are given a chance to earn playing time."
The emphasis on having fun over competitiveness has
attracted many to the team. Freshman Alexander Menke

played
on foot-

ball before quitting and
joining the club baseball team.
"I left the team because I was a walk-on. and the time
and effort that was required was not worth the very lim
ited playing time I was going to get." Menke said. "At
least in the case of varsity football and club baseball, the
difference is that baseball is relaxed ;intl fun whereas
football was like a job I wasn't getting paid for."
That is not to say that the Stanford club baseball is not
fueled by the competition.
"We've played two seasons now." Lazarus said."Both
have gone well, but we really want to win the division and
get some postseason wins. We got a lot of guys coming
back and I really feel we can do damage next year."
The team is growing fast and becoming a strong pres
ence in the club baseball circuit.
"We began the season 0-K. but finished strong with a
10-10 final record." said I hill about the team's inaugural
2007-2008 season.
This season. Stanford finished with a 10-5 record, be
hind UC-Davis (12-2). The team's biggest rival is Santa
( ruz, with Stanford taking two of three games in each of
two years, but in true Cardinal fashion, the club also
takes its rivalry with ("aI very seriously.
"I'd say my favorite moment was beating Cal 24-4,"
Menke said.
