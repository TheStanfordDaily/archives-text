# HORSING AROUND

omprised entirely of students. Stanford's
■ polo club requires much more than simply
learning to ride a galloping horse while
swinging a mallet. Off the field, students
grapple with the basic medications for their
16 polo ponies, as well as feeding the animals, shoeing
them and performing other veterinary duties.
Polo dates back to the sixth century 8.C., and is
played over four seven-minute periods called
"Chukkers." with three players per team on the field at
any given time. Held polo incorporates four players,
while the collegiate game is a player short and is played
in an arena. While the game is ;i spectacle to witness, the
time put in behind the

enes can easily be
overlooked.
The polo

:lub. despite a
time com
mit -

ment that stretches around the clock and through the
summer, remains a club and therefore receives similar
funding to other sports at its level. But how does that
small amount of money, which is adequate for most club
sports.cover the food, board and health needs of 16 polo
ponies?
It doesn't.
"Club funding is not set up to deal with something as
large as what we have, so we work to fund raise on our
own and keep our budget down," explained junior team
manager Katy Peaslee. "We work really hard on that.
We're responsible for making sure our bills get paid."
The necessary dedication to fundraising and horse
care means Stanford polo often falls short on practice
time when compared to the varsity sports. But the time
spent mucking out stalls and vaccinating horses trans
lates to;i proud, dedicated and closely-knit bunch of two
do/en riders.
Just ask Peaslee.
"I gotoclassin muddy jeans and shoes coated in mud
on a regular basis — that's what stands out on our
team." she said.
The mud is a badge of honor, a symbol of dedication
to the animals as much as the sport. Polo gives students
an organic learning experience, where learning is hands
on and impact is immediate.
Peaslee elaborated on the real-world benefits of
Stanford's program.
"It's a different type of learning, hut an opportunity
I don't think I would have gotten at other places."
The fingerprints of Stanford University are evident
only in the club's title,as the team receives minimal I Jni
versity funding and,outstandingly, takes care of its polo
horses 1 (K) percent of the time.The responsibility for 16
living, breathing horses cannot be taken lightly. ITius.
through a self-screening process, the polo club

whittles itself down to only the most devoted
players.

great. Nobody is left with 16 horses and running the
club themselves," Rowe said.
Hie club does not discriminate by sex or beginning
ability, and many players enter the 112 arm with no prior
riding experience. I oi Rowe, the story of how she was
drawn to the polo team live years ago reflects a path that
is somewhat common among the team.
"On the club sports Web site. I saw the equestrian
team and polo, and looked at both of them," Rowe re
calls. "They had a demonstration ehukker out on Roble
Held, and I was actually scheduled to try out for the
equestrian team in half an hour, but I hiked by Roble
Meld and it was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.so I did

To the average bystander,polo is a game for the priv

upper crust of society. However, collegiate polo is any
thing but. (irit and determination, with healthy, self

Rowe touched on the rewards of developing an at

"We spend a lot of time mucking out stallsand fixing

plaguing
the game
The 2(X)9 NBA Playoffs have
been nothing short of epic.
ITie list of mouth-dropping
moments is longer than Den
nis Rodman's wedding dress and the
Association may finally be returning
to its glory days.
Hie squads left — the Los Ange
les Lakers. Denver Nuggets, Orlando
Magic and Cleveland Cavaliers
truly appear to be the four best teams
in the league, with each making a le
gitimate championship run with very
talented, yet very unique, groups.
From Kobe Bryant to Leßron James,
Dwight Howard Id Carmelo Antho
ny, the postseason has been filled with
epic comebacks, epic collapses and
epic last-second moments.
But all of this is being overshad
owed bv one more unbelievable as
pect: the epically horrific officiating.
I'm jumping oft the Conspiracy
Train, for now. and climbing aboard
the Incompetencemobile. I he calls in
the Playoffs have been nothing short
of flagrant. I know the league is vi
ciously praying to the basketball gods
in hopes of getting Kobe and Leßron
to the l inals and it comes as no sur
prise that both studs, especially " I"he
King." are inducing whistles like vou
wouldn't believe.
ITiere is no doubt in my mind that
a matchup between arguably the two
best players of all time would be his
toric on many levels. Quite frankly,
that match-up and lam knocking
on wood till kingdom come that it
doesn't happen - could possibK
generate the best ratings that the
NBA has seen in over a decade.
But for the love of America, all we
want is basketball! In (Jame Fhree of
the ()rlando ('lcveland I astern ("on
fere nee Semifinals, there were 5H
fouls. <S6 combined shots from the
charity stripe and one of the worst
whistles I have ever seen-a I loward
no-contact block on a Leßron James
three-point attempt in the late stages
of the game.
Unfortunately, this h;is become
the norm in the NBA in the post fim
Donaghy era. Because ol the in
evitable financial consequences Stern
and associates anticipated after the
"rogue official" admitted to gambling
on games, the league has needed a
way to entice fans back to the sport
that had so vicioush stabbed them in
the back. I he best formula for success
was to provide preferential treatment
to superstars and to keep games close
a strategy best accomplished by
gently nudging referees into a com
plete philosophical transformation.
Games just aren't officiated the was
they were used to. and to be honest. I
will take five Pistons-Spurs series
over one. 48-minute display ol a su
perstar shooting foul shots.
I'm not trying to make the case
that Orlando and Denver, the two re
maining teams arguably deprived ol
elite players, are being treated any
worse than the Lakers and Cavs
Howard has been on the fortunate
end of officiating errors on more than
one occasion, and the Nuggets often
get away with extraordinarily dirty
play. I aeh team has been subjected to
the incredible inconsistency and in
justice being served up by Stern's
most important employees, and each
fan will continue to suffer from the
choppy game play that has plagued
household television since late April.
The NBA is probably not rigged.
Although one of my columns may
have suggested otherwise, the fact ol
the matter is that a scandal this large
would be impossible to keep under
wraps. I hat said. I think ( ommission
er Stern has a job to perform. While
running a professional sports league,
one must act like a professional. I rom
the Dallas Mavericks' attempted foul
onCarmello.tothe multitude ol ques
tionable technical fouls called on the
Nuggets' Kenyon Martin, the count
less touch fouls to the unimaginable
amount of fines, ejections and suspen
sions. there is no excuse for the inepti
tude of NBA officiating crews. Stern
needs to address this. As an often
spotted spectator in this postseason.it
is impossible that he fails to observe
the insanity and intensity of the situa
lion through a different lens than you
and I. He has defended his league
long enough, but this time, the grave
has been dug.and the power of words
may not be enough tosway fans.
