# NBA refs plaguing the game
## 
### 
The 2(X)9 NBA Playoffs have
been nothing short of epic.
ITie list of mouth-dropping
moments is longer than Den
nis Rodman's wedding dress and the
Association may finally be returning
to its glory days.
Hie squads left — the Los Ange
les Lakers. Denver Nuggets, Orlando
Magic and Cleveland Cavaliers
truly appear to be the four best teams
in the league, with each making a le
gitimate championship run with very
talented, yet very unique, groups.
From Kobe Bryant to Leßron James,
Dwight Howard Id Carmelo Antho
ny, the postseason has been filled with
epic comebacks, epic collapses and
epic last-second moments.
But all of this is being overshad
owed bv one more unbelievable as
pect: the epically horrific officiating.
I'm jumping oft the Conspiracy
Train, for now. and climbing aboard
the Incompetencemobile. I he calls in
the Playoffs have been nothing short
of flagrant. I know the league is vi
ciously praying to the basketball gods
in hopes of getting Kobe and Leßron
to the l inals and it comes as no sur
prise that both studs, especially " I"he
King." are inducing whistles like vou
wouldn't believe.
ITiere is no doubt in my mind that
a matchup between arguably the two
best players of all time would be his
toric on many levels. Quite frankly,
that match-up and lam knocking
on wood till kingdom come that it
doesn't happen - could possibK
generate the best ratings that the
NBA has seen in over a decade.
But for the love of America, all we
want is basketball! In (Jame Fhree of
the ()rlando ('lcveland I astern ("on
fere nee Semifinals, there were 5H
fouls. <S6 combined shots from the
charity stripe and one of the worst
whistles I have ever seen-a I loward
no-contact block on a Leßron James
three-point attempt in the late stages
of the game.
Unfortunately, this h;is become
the norm in the NBA in the post fim
Donaghy era. Because ol the in
evitable financial consequences Stern
and associates anticipated after the
"rogue official" admitted to gambling
on games, the league has needed a
way to entice fans back to the sport
that had so vicioush stabbed them in
the back. I he best formula for success
was to provide preferential treatment
to superstars and to keep games close
a strategy best accomplished by
gently nudging referees into a com
plete philosophical transformation.
Games just aren't officiated the was
they were used to. and to be honest. I
will take five Pistons-Spurs series
over one. 48-minute display ol a su
perstar shooting foul shots.
I'm not trying to make the case
that Orlando and Denver, the two re
maining teams arguably deprived ol
elite players, are being treated any
worse than the Lakers and Cavs
Howard has been on the fortunate
end of officiating errors on more than
one occasion, and the Nuggets often
get away with extraordinarily dirty
play. I aeh team has been subjected to
the incredible inconsistency and in
justice being served up by Stern's
most important employees, and each
fan will continue to suffer from the
choppy game play that has plagued
household television since late April.
The NBA is probably not rigged.
Although one of my columns may
have suggested otherwise, the fact ol
the matter is that a scandal this large
would be impossible to keep under
wraps. I hat said. I think ( ommission
er Stern has a job to perform. While
running a professional sports league,
one must act like a professional. I rom
the Dallas Mavericks' attempted foul
onCarmello.tothe multitude ol ques
tionable technical fouls called on the
Nuggets' Kenyon Martin, the count
less touch fouls to the unimaginable
amount of fines, ejections and suspen
sions. there is no excuse for the inepti
tude of NBA officiating crews. Stern
needs to address this. As an often
spotted spectator in this postseason.it
is impossible that he fails to observe
the insanity and intensity of the situa
lion through a different lens than you
and I. He has defended his league
long enough, but this time, the grave
has been dug.and the power of words
may not be enough tosway fans.

For the last few weeks, I have been
desperately trying to rid my thoughts
ol any conspiracy theories. The team
I passionately follow is poised to
compete for a championship, and two
of the greatest players to ever lace-up

are performing right before my eyes.
For an avid basketball fan, this is
bliss.
And in order for basketball nation
to remain euphoric. Stern needs to
fully understand and control the situ
ation. Basketball is a game played be
tween two teams. ITie unpredictable
nature of a third party ruins the puri
ty of the sport. Now is the time for the
NBA to speak up and for referees to
swallow their whistles. ITie signifi

cance of this year's NBA Playoffs is
unbounded. With tough financial
times and the entertainment game
tighter than ever, the league needs to
be clutch.
Thus, the NBA is left with two
choices: step up, or foul out.
