## GSC encounters problems with 750 Pub replacement 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Graduate student customers of the 750 Pub &
Eatery' found out at last night's Graduate Student
Council (GSC) meeting that choosing a fitting
replacement for the little-frequented grad student
hangout will be very difficult.
A graduate student committee headed by Mary
Van der Hoven. a third-year earth sciences graduate
student, has been in contact with Residential & Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) as the voice for Stanford's grad
student population. R&DE also sent two representa
tives to Wednesday night's meeting. Executive
Director of Stanford Dining Eric Montell and
Executive Director of Hospitality & Auxiliaries
Michael Gratz.
With business at the pub. located in the Graduate
Community Center (GCC), struggling to attract
enough customer traffic to keep it afloat, its June 30
demise comes as no surprise to most students. While
the prices are affordable — four dollars for a pint —
the mundane, office-like atmosphere of the pub sees
few regulars, if at all.
"[We need] a right vendor there who knows how to
appeal to graduate students." Van der Hoven said.
"Finding the right vendor and making changes to the
space that make it feel like a community set-up —
those are the two main things students are concerned
about."
Comparisons were made with the CoHo at last
night's meeting, which many graduate students
believed exemplified the feel of a quintessential coffee
house. In fact, students have expressed great enthusi
asm for choosing Ray Klein, owner and manager of
The Treehouse and CoHo. to take over the 750 spot.
"He's the only person that's been mentioned so far
that students are really excited about." Van der Hoven
said. "But there are some feelings on the part of the
students and administrators, alike, who think it's going
to be hard for Ray Klein to get in here because of past
politics with R&DE."
Students have even proposed a student-run pub in
order to achieve the community environment.
However, in the end. the idea was defeated by uncer
tainties around how well such a venue can be man
aged.
Obtaining their desired ambiance — which seems

most important to grad students — also proves to be
one of the greatest challenges in the replacement
process, even discounting the Ray Klein issue.
"Arrillaga has very specific requirements for the
building that he's donated," Van der Hoven said. "We
really appreciate having it. but we need to make these
changes to have it work for us, and so far the adminis
tration has been very reluctant to even ask him."
There was a common sentiment of frustration
among GSC members regarding the lack of answers
from R&DE.
"We had a lot of meetings with them and today a
lot of the questions and issues that were raised has
been in previous meetings already," said Nanna
Notthoff, second-year psychology grad student and
GSC co-chair. "Just speaking to Michael Gratz, it
seems he's totally unaware of some — or he made it
seem like that — and it surprised me because those
are some issues that were brought to him before and
it's really unfortunate."
Van der Hoven agreed.
"We're not getting a lot of answers." she said. "They
can't answer any of our questions clearly so that
makes it seem like there is something there that we're
not seeing and that's very frustrating."
However, reaching this balance of the right mood
with the affordable prices is harder to come by. Some
students fear that expectations may be so high that
they become unrealistic.
"Those two objectives — student interest and ven
dor financial interest — are fundamentally diametri
cally opposed." said Eric Shed, second-year Ph.D. stu
dent in the School of Education. "So the fact that
we're talking about this situation, how we're going to
bring someone in to make money and at the same
time service our needs. I think it's impossible and inca
pable of happening, personally."
The selection process for a new pub continues to
meet delays — the initial deadline for identifying a
vendor was pushed back four months from June to
early September — as the debate between the gradu
ate community and R&DE escalates.
Details on last night's discussion about this issue
and minutes on other concerns, including changes to
the CalTrain and funding, will be posted on the GSC
Web site.
