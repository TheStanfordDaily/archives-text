Working through the "elephant in
the room" of community center cuts.
ASSU Executives David Gobaud '08
M.S. '10 and Jay De La Torre '10 held
their first town hall Wednesday,
addressing the issue of University
budgeting in the face of a decreasing
endowment. Around 100 students
attended the meeting in Old Union
Room 200, according to the
Executives.
ASSU officials hailed the meeting
as a success, while some community
center supporters indicated that they
were not as satisfied. Towards the end
of the town hall, a group of students
broke out in a chant of "Unity! Unity!

Save our community!" Last week.
Concerned Students for Community
Centers (CSCC) held a four-day fast,
rallying for greater transparency after
13 staff members among the six centers
were put on part-time status for the
summer months.
Wednesday's town hall, then, pro
vided an opportunity for direct
response as Vice Provost for Student
Affairs (VPSA) Greg Boardman
attended, along with Vice Provost for
Budget and Auxiliaries Management
(VPBAM) Tim Warner and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) John Bravman. Each of the
Vice Provosts gave a brief presentation
on the budget cuts being made in their
respective departments and fielded
questions from students.

In an email to The Daily. Andy
Parker '12. the Executives' co-chief of
staff, said that he thought the Vice
Provosts did a great job with their pre
sentations.
"Vice Provost Warner gave a great
overview of the University budget,"
Parker wrote. "Understanding the big
picture first, before Bravman and
Boardman presented, was extremely
valuable because I think it helped put
the VPUE and VPSA presentations in
context. Bravman presented on VPUE:
he discussed the restructuring that is
happening within VPUE. including
condensing nine separate divisions into
four."
Parker added that Bravman told

employees rather than reducing
them to part-time. This was in con
trast to Boardman, who presented
on VPSA.and said that the depart
ment opted to make some staff
positions part-time in order to lay
off as few people as possible.
Co-Chair of Undergraduate
Outreach in the ASSU Executive
Cabinet Adrienne Pon '12 also said
that she was impressed by the pre
sentations.
"The thing that really impressed
me the most with the administra
tors was how much time they put
into it. how much concern they had
for the student body when they
were organizing what to do for the
budget cuts," she said.
Pon added that she was happy to
hear that certain introductory sem
inars were being kept, including the
IntroSems for freshmen, as well as
Sophomore Seminars. She was also
surprised to hear that the overseas
seminars were expanding.

Undergraduate Senate
Appropriations Committee Chair
Anton Zietsman '12 said that many
students in the audience didn't
seem to care too much about the
presentation from VPUE.
"While [Vice | Provost
Bravman's presentation was
informative and detailed. I don't
think it had anv significant effect
on those present," Zietsman said.
"Students are not that worried
about the academic aspect of their
University. For most, whether they
have 10 Sophomore Colleges to
choose from instead of 13 bears lit
tle importance."
However, Zietsman noted that
there were a lot of audience mem
bers who felt very strongly about
the VPSA presentation.specifically
with regards to the cuts being made
to community centers.
"Bravman's presentation was
under-appreciated, especially
because the students were wailing
for Vice Provost Boardman," he
said. "The issues concerning the
community centers were like the
elephant in the room and most stu
dents were just waiting to jump at
Boardman's throat. He knew this,
as did everyone present. When he
realized that he was not going to be

able to side step the issue, I think
he did a good job of trying to justi
fy his rationale behind the euts he
made."
Parker agreed that the Viee
Provosts did a good job of answer
ing student questions.
"The Vice Provosts directly
answered questions on subjects
ranging from spending out of the
endowment to cutting athletic pro
grams." Parker noted. "And on
issues where they couldn't reveal
certain details, they were very clear
about the reasons for keeping
information private. For example,
there is a policy that prevents
releasing information about staff
cuts in different areas of the
University in order to avoid any
animosity within or between
departments."
However, other students
belonging to CSCC said that they
were dissatisfied with Boardman's
answers to some of their questions.
"In the end, I think we aren't
getting any concrete answers to the
things we are asking." said Mililani
Irask-Batti '10. "There was one
point when someone from the
audience was trying to understand
Boardman's reasons for not follow
ing what the directors of the com
munity centers had proposed for
the budget cuts, and I don't feel
like Boardman answered those
questions very well."
Irask-Batti also mentioned that
one particular remark made by
Boardman about making cuts and
then retroactively observing
whether or not the cuts would neg
atively affect the centers angered
CSCCC members, many of whom
started chanting "Unity! Unity!
Save our community!" towards the
end of the meeting.
Despite her concerns, Irask-
Batti said that she still appreciated
the ASSU Executives' decision to
hold the town hall.
Gobaud and De I.a Torre said
that this was only the first of many
town halls that they will host
throughout their tenure. In the
near future, they intend to hold
another town hall specifically for
graduate students.
The proposed University budget
will be discussed at today's meeting
of the Faculty Senate. The Daily
will report on the meeting in
tomorrow's issue, and will feature
continuing coverage of the pro
posed budget and reactions to it.
