Working through the "elephant in
the room" of community center cuts.
ASSU Executives David Gobaud '08
M.S. '10 and Jay De La Torre '10 held
their first town hall Wednesday,
addressing the issue of University
budgeting in the face of a decreasing
endowment. Around 100 students
attended the meeting in Old Union
Room 200, according to the
Executives.
ASSU officials hailed the meeting
as a success, while some community
center supporters indicated that they
were not as satisfied. Towards the end
of the town hall, a group of students
broke out in a chant of "Unity! Unity!

Save our community!" Last week.
Concerned Students for Community
Centers (CSCC) held a four-day fast,
rallying for greater transparency after
13 staff members among the six centers
were put on part-time status for the
summer months.

response as Vice Provost for Student
Affairs (VPSA) Greg Boardman
attended, along with Vice Provost for
Budget and Auxiliaries Management
(VPBAM) Tim Warner and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) John Bravman. Each of the
Vice Provosts gave a brief presentation
on the budget cuts being made in their
respective departments and fielded
questions from students.

In an email to The Daily. Andy
Parker '12. the Executives' co-chief of
staff, said that he thought the Vice
Provosts did a great job with their pre
sentations.
"Vice Provost Warner gave a great
overview of the University budget,"
Parker wrote. "Understanding the big
picture first, before Bravman and
Boardman presented, was extremely
valuable because I think it helped put
the VPUE and VPSA presentations in
context. Bravman presented on VPUE:
he discussed the restructuring that is
happening within VPUE. including
condensing nine separate divisions into
four."
Parker added that Bravman told
