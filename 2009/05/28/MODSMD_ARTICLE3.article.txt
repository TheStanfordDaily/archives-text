opt for alternative housing to bypass the Draw, exercise their independence
or simply room with people of their choosing.
Draw Aversion
"Not that enthusiastic about this year's Draw prospects??" was the sub
ject of an email Kyonne Isaac i() sent to several campus email lists last
month. Isaac and her friends were seeking roommates to join them in an
off-campus house for the summer and next year.
"We all wanted to live off-campus before we knew about the Draw
reform, but I have heard of people being unhappy about it." Isaac said.
"There was a buzz going on about the changes at that time, so I thought that
subject line would maybe get people to open it up."
One of Isaac's future housemates. ( iara Segura *10. chose the off-cam
pus option specifically to avoid dealing with the Draw.
"I got not-so-great housing my sophomore year." she recounted.
"Starting then I got a little frustrated with the housing system. If you don't
get a good Draw number, you get shitty housing; and where you live deter
mines how great your experience will be, at least at Stanford."
A Penny Saved
Although they are still looking for a house — most realtors, Segura said,
want them to move in within about a week rather than wait until the end ot
the school vear — Segura estimates that she will save $10,000 next year on
