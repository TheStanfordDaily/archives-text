Draw Aversion
"Not that enthusiastic about this year's Draw prospects??" was the sub
ject of an email Kyonne Isaac i() sent to several campus email lists last
month. Isaac and her friends were seeking roommates to join them in an
off-campus house for the summer and next year.
"We all wanted to live off-campus before we knew about the Draw
reform, but I have heard of people being unhappy about it." Isaac said.
"There was a buzz going on about the changes at that time, so I thought that
subject line would maybe get people to open it up."
One of Isaac's future housemates. ( iara Segura *10. chose the off-cam
pus option specifically to avoid dealing with the Draw.
"I got not-so-great housing my sophomore year." she recounted.
"Starting then I got a little frustrated with the housing system. If you don't
get a good Draw number, you get shitty housing; and where you live deter
mines how great your experience will be, at least at Stanford."
A Penny Saved
Although they are still looking for a house — most realtors, Segura said,
want them to move in within about a week rather than wait until the end ot
the school vear — Segura estimates that she will save $10,000 next year on
housing and food.
Isaac, however, was more conser
vative in evaluating her draw group's
financial savings.
"I think there are going to he a lot
of unexpected expenses." she said.
"We have to think about furniture,
groceries, cooking, forks, knives, pots
and pans — everything that goes into
a house."
Segura also plans to further cut
costs by hiking, not driving, to campus.
"People are intimidated by the
three-mile bike ride." she said. "But
you get used to it."
Independent I .mug
Off-campus housing also affords
an increased level of independence to
those looking for a less structured liv
ing situation. It was this facet of alter
native housing that appealed to Isaac,
who owns a house with her brothers
back home.
"[Segura] and I are pretty
autonomous from our parents." she
said, explaining her preference for liv
ing style. "Maybe that contributes to it
as well."
Many students harbor concerns
that living off campus isolates them
from the heart of the Stanford social
scene, but Segura dismissed the fear.

"People get freaked out about not
being on campus and never going to
parties or hanging out on campus,"
she said."But I think it gets a little dull
to stay on campus all the time."
This anxiety is more prevalent
among undergraduates than graduate
students, according to Isaac and
Segura.
"I think more undergraduates
should consider it." Isaac said. "It's a
good intermediary step toward having
to move away and have a job eventu
ally anyway."
For Isaac, the decision to live off
campus was an easy one. but she con
cedes that leaving the Farm bubble
poses difficulties for many students.
"The most common answer is.'My
parents aren't comfortable with me
living off campus.'" she related. "That,
and I think there's a huge culture on
campus as well that doesn't exist at
other universities."
A Mouse is a Home
Ben Lasley M 1 is also looking for a
place off campus. Lasley entered
Stanford as a freshman in 2(X)5 but
took two years off. during which he
got married and lived with his wife in
Boston. Next year, lasley will return
to Stanford but. after a taste of off

campus living back east, plans to avoid
campus housing.
"One of the big things in the off
campus living situation is that you
have a lot more space," Lasley said.
"We also got a cat, and you can't have
pets in any Stanford housing."
Isaac and Segura are also excited
about having more space.
"In a dorm, you have one room
that's usually very small and a dining
hall instead of a full kitchen," Isaac
said. "Sharing a fridge with 40 people
is a little rough."
"I want to live in a home instead of
a dorm room." Segura added. "With a
kitchen, a yard ... that's really impor
tant for me."
l,asley. his wife and some of their
friends intend to find a house in the
area big enough to form their own
"mini co-op."
"My wife and I like the idea of liv
ing with a decent number of our
friends because it's a lot more fun,"
Lasley said, adding that many of his
friends from the Class of 2009 will be
graduating but still working near
Stanford. "That's our philosophy. You
can't do that on campus."
Isaac also looked into off-campus
housing in part because she wanted to
live with friends who have graduated.

"It just wouldn't have boon feasi
ble otherwise," she said.
One of Lasley's prospective house
mates is Lauren Palumbi 10. who will
be abroad next fall.
"My main concern is living in
housing after I get back from
Australia that is inconvenient or not
as compatible with my social life for
the rest of my senior year," she said.
"Basically, the last thing I want is to
get stuck in graduate housing after
being abroad."
Isaac said living off campus will not
considerably affect her lifestyle.
"I'm still very much a student at
Stanford — I spend most of my day
here," she said. "Your friends won't go
away if you're living off campus!"
