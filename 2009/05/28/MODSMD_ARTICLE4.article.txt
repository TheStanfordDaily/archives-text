Roommate relationships are put to the ulti
mate test when one (or both) of the involved
parties falls prey to one of the most devastating
situations Stanford students may find them
selves in: the lost dorm key.
Normal key replacement charges "range
from $«S() to $2(X). depending on your residence,
number of keys replaced and union rates,"
according to the I lousing Web site. In order to
take the pain out of the pocketbook in key
replacement, the I lousing Front Desk staff is
offering, for the second year in a row. the Key
Amnest) Program.
"The Key Amnesty Program is an opportuni
ty for undergraduate residents to report a lost
key and have their rwm re-keyed for a flat fee
of $4 l ). specifically for keys reported as lost
between Monday. May 18 and Friday. May 29."
said Rodger Whitney, executive director of
Student Housing.
According to Whitney, several hundred stu
dents lose their keys throughout the year. These
students, lacking the little metal token of "open
sesame" that grants access not only to dorm
rooms, but also to most residence buildings, face
the challenge and the financial cost of re-keying

key.
"I went online and got the key blank for like
$1 —they sent it to me and 1 went to some
janky-ass hardware store and used my room
mate's key to get it copied." the anonymous stu

I le said that although he first went to a lock

the locksmith in town knew to not copy any of
the Stanford keys because they are a type of
high-security key.
"The woman [who engraved the key] actual

said. "She knew it was intense. Obviously.
Stanford doesn't want you to have these keys
because anyone could just come in and steal
stuff.
The student has passed his idea on to a few

"I told some people because they had the

Agreement.
