Roommate relationships are put to the ulti
mate test when one (or both) of the involved
parties falls prey to one of the most devastating
situations Stanford students may find them
selves in: the lost dorm key.
Normal key replacement charges "range
from $«S() to $2(X). depending on your residence,
number of keys replaced and union rates,"
according to the I lousing Web site. In order to
take the pain out of the pocketbook in key
replacement, the I lousing Front Desk staff is

Amnest) Program.
"The Key Amnesty Program is an opportuni
ty for undergraduate residents to report a lost
key and have their rwm re-keyed for a flat fee
of $4 l ). specifically for keys reported as lost
between Monday. May 18 and Friday. May 29."
said Rodger Whitney, executive director of
Student Housing.
According to Whitney, several hundred stu
dents lose their keys throughout the year. These
students, lacking the little metal token of "open
sesame" that grants access not only to dorm
rooms, but also to most residence buildings, face
the challenge and the financial cost of re-keying
their rooms.
"Students are charged the actual cost, includ
ing labor and materials, for changing the locks
for which the key was lost." wrote Phil Resch.

However, one creative
student found a way to avoid jumping through
the 1 lousing hcxips to get a replacement key.The
student, who wished to remain anonymous for
fear of retribution from the University, figured
out a way to copy and create his own residence
key.
"I went online and got the key blank for like
$1 —they sent it to me and 1 went to some
janky-ass hardware store and used my room
mate's key to get it copied." the anonymous stu
dent explained.
I le said that although he first went to a lock
smith to try to get his roommate's key copied,
the locksmith in town knew to not copy any of
the Stanford keys because they are a type of
high-security key.
"The woman [who engraved the key] actual
ly asked me.'f low did you get this?"' the student
said. "She knew it was intense. Obviously.
Stanford doesn't want you to have these keys
because anyone could just come in and steal
stuff.
The student has passed his idea on to a few
other people.
"I told some people because they had the
same problem — a couple people asked me how
they did it and then I told them," the student
explained. "I hope the University doesn't find
out about this so it would be difficult for other
people to do the same thing."
According to Whitney, any off-campus dupli
cation of keys is in violation of the Residence
Agreement.
"The duplication of keys off campus is strict-

ly prohibited." Whitney said. "We do
occasionally hear from outside lock
smiths that students have tried to have
our keys copied, hut they do not copy
the University keys."
Although very few students create
their own key duplicates, some resort
to extreme measures to avoid paying
the re-keying fee. Jay de la Torre '10
climhed into the fire escape and
through his window of Sigma Nu for
two months last year before getting a
new key.
"I just had my roommate leave the
window open and I crawled through
the window because I didn't want to
pay $IKO to get a new key." de la Torre
said. "It wasn't hard, but it was mad
inconvenient."
De la Torre was also one of the stu
dents who t<x)k advantage of the Key
Amnesty Program last year.
"For the first two to three months. I
didn't know what to do (about the key]
and I was too lazy to go to I lousing." he
said. "I heard about the Key Amnesty
Program and I waited for about anoth

er month."
In some very rare circumstances,
both roommates lose their keys simul
taneously. Justine DiPrete '11 and
Sarah Masimore '11 found themselves
in that situation during the middle of
last year.
"We both kind of put off getting it
re-keyed." DiPrete explained. "So, we
would leave the d<x)r unlocked and
bang on the d<xir outside when we
wanted to get in — people hated us.
After a month, we thought we were
annoying people too much because we
would bang on the d(x>r and no one
would come get us. So since we both
lost them, [Masimore] just went in and
said she lost hers and we split the cost."
Although there were definitely dis
advantages to not having a key.
Masimore noted that there was at least
one upside.
"It was kind of nice — we just left
our dtx»r unlocked all the time." she
explained. However, the freedom of
this situation came with a price.
"It was also kind of scarv because

you never knew if your stuff was going
to get stolen or not." Masimore said.
Although DiPrete and Masimore
found a collaborative solution to their
no-key problem, some students admit
that they would not be as forgiving if a
roommate lost their key.
"I think people who lose their keys
are really irresponsible," said Shane
Savitsky '12. "I wouldn't leave my door
unlocked because I don't want to —I
have many valuable things in my rtxmi.
like my computer."
In addition, Imogen Hinds, associ
ate director for Undergraduate
Housing Operations, strongly discour
aged students from delaying the
process of re-keying.
"Residents who opt to live without
a key after one is lost are not only
inconveniencing themselves, they are
also risking their own security and
their roommates [sic], as well as the
security of other students in the
house/residence," Hinds wrote in an
email to The Daily.
Whitney explained that one of the

main reasons (he University is intro
ducing the new card access system is to
reduce the need for physical keys, and
thus the need to replace lost physical
keys.
"As of the end of this academic
year, all of our residences which
house first-year students will be on
the card access system, which pro
vides ease of access for the students,
who use their Stanford II) cards to
access their residences, and fewer
keys which can he lost." Whitney said.
Although for some students the
Key Amnesty Program is an opportu
nity to replace keys at a discounted
price at the end of the year. Cole
Hat ton 11 had reservations about the
motives for implementing the
Amnesty Program.
"I think it's a stunt to make money
before the end of the year when you
don't need your key anymore," I latton
said.

out about this so it would be difficult for other
people to do the same thing."
According to Whitney, any off-campus dupli
cation of keys is in violation of the Residence
Agreement.
"The duplication of keys off campus is strict-

ly prohibited." Whitney said. "We do
occasionally hear from outside lock
smiths that students have tried to have
our keys copied, hut they do not copy
the University keys."
Although very few students create
their own key duplicates, some resort
to extreme measures to avoid paying
the re-keying fee. Jay de la Torre '10
climhed into the fire escape and
through his window of Sigma Nu for
two months last year before getting a
new key.
"I just had my roommate leave the
window open and I crawled through
the window because I didn't want to
pay $IKO to get a new key." de la Torre
said. "It wasn't hard, but it was mad
inconvenient."
De la Torre was also one of the stu
dents who t<x)k advantage of the Key
Amnesty Program last year.
"For the first two to three months. I
didn't know what to do (about the key]
and I was too lazy to go to I lousing." he
said. "I heard about the Key Amnesty
Program and I waited for about anoth

er month."
In some very rare circumstances,
both roommates lose their keys simul
taneously. Justine DiPrete '11 and
Sarah Masimore '11 found themselves
in that situation during the middle of
last year.
"We both kind of put off getting it
re-keyed." DiPrete explained. "So, we
would leave the d<x)r unlocked and
bang on the d<xir outside when we
wanted to get in — people hated us.
After a month, we thought we were
annoying people too much because we
would bang on the d(x>r and no one
would come get us. So since we both
lost them, [Masimore] just went in and
said she lost hers and we split the cost."
Although there were definitely dis
advantages to not having a key.
Masimore noted that there was at least
one upside.
"It was kind of nice — we just left
our dtx»r unlocked all the time." she
explained. However, the freedom of
this situation came with a price.
"It was also kind of scarv because

you never knew if your stuff was going
to get stolen or not." Masimore said.
Although DiPrete and Masimore
found a collaborative solution to their
no-key problem, some students admit
that they would not be as forgiving if a
roommate lost their key.
"I think people who lose their keys
are really irresponsible," said Shane
Savitsky '12. "I wouldn't leave my door
unlocked because I don't want to —I
have many valuable things in my rtxmi.
like my computer."
In addition, Imogen Hinds, associ
ate director for Undergraduate
Housing Operations, strongly discour
aged students from delaying the
process of re-keying.
"Residents who opt to live without
a key after one is lost are not only
inconveniencing themselves, they are
also risking their own security and
their roommates [sic], as well as the
security of other students in the
house/residence," Hinds wrote in an
email to The Daily.
Whitney explained that one of the

main reasons (he University is intro
ducing the new card access system is to
reduce the need for physical keys, and
thus the need to replace lost physical
keys.
"As of the end of this academic
year, all of our residences which
house first-year students will be on
the card access system, which pro
vides ease of access for the students,
who use their Stanford II) cards to
access their residences, and fewer
keys which can he lost." Whitney said.
Although for some students the
Key Amnesty Program is an opportu
nity to replace keys at a discounted
price at the end of the year. Cole
Hat ton 11 had reservations about the
motives for implementing the
Amnesty Program.
"I think it's a stunt to make money
before the end of the year when you
don't need your key anymore," I latton
said.
