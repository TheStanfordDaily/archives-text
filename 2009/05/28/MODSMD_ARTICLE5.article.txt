## Spinklers inundate Loro residents 
### LIZ STARK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the sun shone outside last Friday,
second floor Loro residents were hit by an
indoor deluge as a lire sprinkler unexpect
edly went off in one resident's room at
approximately 11:15 a.m.
"The sprinkler just went off in my room,
and I have no idea how." said Vineet Singal
*12.
Once the sprinkler went off. Singal alert
ed a janitorial staff member, who then con
tacted the Housing Desk, which ultimately
called the Fire Department.
According to Singal, the Fire
Department arrived and turned off the
sprinklers within fifteen minutes.
While Associate Director of Housing

Imogen Hinds wrote in an email to The
Daily on Monday that the cause of the
sprinkler's turning on was unknown, she
noted the responding I ire Department per
sonnel did report there was an object
attached to the sprinkler head in the room.
Singal and his roommate. Huy Dao '12,
were not aware of any such object and claim
to have not placed or hung anything on the
sprinkler.
"At this time, no fault has been found."
I finds said.
The damage was extensive, affecting the
common areas downstairs and half of the
second floor.
"Water had completely destroyed most
of the stuff in my room." Singal said. "Water
seeped through most of the rooms on the
second floor, and about eieht rooms had to

be cleaned and evacuated."
All residents from those rooms have
been relocated to other locations on cam
pus. including Loro's third floor. Fscondido
Village (F.V). Lagunita, Faisan and
Cardenal for the rest of the year.
Kevin 1 lardekoph' 12. Singal's next door
neighbor, moved into his FV reassignment
on Monday with another Loro student,
where they will stay for the remainder of the
quarter.
"It was just the carpets [that were wet]."
Hardekoph said. "I didn't have anything
that got soaked on the floor."
Hardekoph was assigned to EV as of h
p.m. Friday but could not move until
Monday, due in part to the fact that no
means of transportation for his belongings
was provided by Housing.


"They didn't offer any kind of transporta
tion," he said. "The email said, [paraphrase]
'You're assigned to EV. and we're sorry we
can't help you get your stuff here.'"
Hardekoph s only damaged property
was a guitar he left in Singal's room.
Housing began its clean-up efforts
on Friday afternoon.
"Student Housing brought in a
professional Restoration
Management group to help remove
carpeting and dry out student room
carpets." Hinds said. "This process
will take several days, as the drying
process takes that long, and from
there new carpet will need to be
installed."
Singal said the water has closed
down the first floor lounge and com
puter cluster.
"Water seeped down to the first
floor so that the ceiling in the lounge
was messed up and the computers
had to be taken out of the cluster," he

said. "We can't access the lounge or
computer cluster for the rest of the
year."
Hinds said Housing is in the
process of evaluating whether the
furniture and carpet in the lounge
will require replacement.
According to Singal, Housing
reported there is no solid timeline for
repairs, and that they may take place
after the school year ends.
The University has begun its reim
bursement process for damaged and
destroyed student property, accord
ing to both Singal and Hinds.
"All residents are being given the
same information regarding reim
bursement for any loss of personal
property that will be covered by the
University Risk Management,"
1 linds said.
"You fill out this form with all the
stuff that you lost and how much it's
worth," Singal said. "And then they
reimburse vou."

Hardekoph, however, said he
learned of the reimbursement from
Singal and not from I lousing.
"They haven't contacted me yet."
he said."[Singal] told me that you go
to the Housing Desk, which opened
today, and request a form."
According to Hinds, three previ
ous incidents occurred this year in
which "the sprinklers have gone off
and caused fairly expensive damage."
"There has not been a situation in
Student Housing where a fire sprin
kler discharged without [there] being
a cause, such as fire or tampering"
Hinds said. "Two of the three inci
dents were caused by small stove top
fires, and one had to do with a foot
ball being thrown at the sprinkler
head."
As of Monday Hinds reported no
cost estimate for the damage.
