### LIZ STARK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the sun shone outside last Friday,
second floor Loro residents were hit by an
indoor deluge as a lire sprinkler unexpect
edly went off in one resident's room at
approximately 11:15 a.m.
"The sprinkler just went off in my room,
and I have no idea how." said Vineet Singal
*12.
Once the sprinkler went off. Singal alert
ed a janitorial staff member, who then con
tacted the Housing Desk, which ultimately
called the Fire Department.
According to Singal, the Fire
Department arrived and turned off the
sprinklers within fifteen minutes.
While Associate Director of Housing

Imogen Hinds wrote in an email to The
Daily on Monday that the cause of the
sprinkler's turning on was unknown, she
noted the responding I ire Department per
sonnel did report there was an object
attached to the sprinkler head in the room.
Singal and his roommate. Huy Dao '12,
were not aware of any such object and claim
to have not placed or hung anything on the
sprinkler.
"At this time, no fault has been found."
I finds said.
The damage was extensive, affecting the
common areas downstairs and half of the
second floor.
"Water had completely destroyed most
of the stuff in my room." Singal said. "Water
seeped through most of the rooms on the
second floor, and about eieht rooms had to

be cleaned and evacuated."
All residents from those rooms have
been relocated to other locations on cam
pus. including Loro's third floor. Fscondido
Village (F.V). Lagunita, Faisan and
Cardenal for the rest of the year.
Kevin 1 lardekoph' 12. Singal's next door
neighbor, moved into his FV reassignment
on Monday with another Loro student,
where they will stay for the remainder of the
quarter.
"It was just the carpets [that were wet]."
Hardekoph said. "I didn't have anything
that got soaked on the floor."
Hardekoph was assigned to EV as of h
p.m. Friday but could not move until
Monday, due in part to the fact that no
means of transportation for his belongings
was provided by Housing.


"They didn't offer any kind of transporta
tion," he said. "The email said, [paraphrase]
'You're assigned to EV. and we're sorry we
can't help you get your stuff here.'"
