## Students rethink University Ave. New plan would turn portion of avenue into pedestrian mall 
### MIKE DING DESK EDITOR 
Three Stanford graduate students have pro
posed an idea to convert a stretch of University
Avenue between High and Cowper streets into a
pedestrian mall, and the idea is quickly gaining
traction amongst community members. Yesterday,
the group spoke in front of the City Council
Planning & Transportation Committee to pitch
their plan.
Management Science and Engineering gradu
ate student David Hughes. Product Design gradu
ate student James Thompson. Amrita Mahale M.S.
*09 and Svetla Alexandrov M.B.A. '(W came up
with the idea as part of an assignment for a class
offered by the Stanford Institute of Design called
"Creating Infectious Action."
The idea has taken off like wildfire, whieh inci
dentally. is also the name of the team that the stu
dents belonged to in their class.
Thomspon said that when they started out. they
only had a Facebook group.
"We started out just recruiting some friends" he
said. "And we got about 70 people on board. It real
ly took off from there. This group of 70 was telling
all their friends and in under a week, we reached
over 1.000 people on our Facebook group.
Currently, there are also about 3.500 outstanding
invitations on Facebook."
Thompson said that some of the earliest sup
porters of the project included merchants on
University Avenue and former Palo Alto Mayor
Yoriko Kishimoto.
Restaurants on University have been support
ive of the team's idea because the pedestrian mall
would enable them to expand their restaurants into
the streets to create a better ambiance and increase
their patrons, according to Thompson.
But some retail businesses have been concerned
that the decrease in car traffic would reduce the
number of customers in their stores.
In response to this.Thompson cited a case study
of a street in Copenhagen. Denmark, which under
went a similar change.
"In this example, there was the same kind of
push back as the retail store said 'No way. This
would kill my business. " Thompson noted. "But
once they actually built the pedestrian mall, they
found that their business increased from 25 to 40
percent. Once a pedestrian mall is well-created,
you're increasing foot traffic by about 1000 per
cent. and increasing foot traffic is better than
increasing car traffic."
Hughes said that the group began its project
with the goal of reducing gas consumption in the
surrounding community.
"And what better way to reduce that than to
encourage alternative transportation." he said.
