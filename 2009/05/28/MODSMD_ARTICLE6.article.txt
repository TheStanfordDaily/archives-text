## Students rethink University Ave. New plan would turn portion of avenue into pedestrian mall 
### MIKE DING DESK EDITOR 
Three Stanford graduate students have pro
posed an idea to convert a stretch of University
Avenue between High and Cowper streets into a
pedestrian mall, and the idea is quickly gaining
traction amongst community members. Yesterday,
the group spoke in front of the City Council
Planning & Transportation Committee to pitch
their plan.
Management Science and Engineering gradu
ate student David Hughes. Product Design gradu
ate student James Thompson. Amrita Mahale M.S.
*09 and Svetla Alexandrov M.B.A. '(W came up
with the idea as part of an assignment for a class
offered by the Stanford Institute of Design called
"Creating Infectious Action."
The idea has taken off like wildfire, whieh inci
dentally. is also the name of the team that the stu
dents belonged to in their class.
Thomspon said that when they started out. they
only had a Facebook group.
"We started out just recruiting some friends" he
said. "And we got about 70 people on board. It real
ly took off from there. This group of 70 was telling
all their friends and in under a week, we reached
over 1.000 people on our Facebook group.
Currently, there are also about 3.500 outstanding
invitations on Facebook."
Thompson said that some of the earliest sup
porters of the project included merchants on
University Avenue and former Palo Alto Mayor
Yoriko Kishimoto.
Restaurants on University have been support
ive of the team's idea because the pedestrian mall
would enable them to expand their restaurants into
the streets to create a better ambiance and increase
their patrons, according to Thompson.
But some retail businesses have been concerned
that the decrease in car traffic would reduce the
number of customers in their stores.
In response to this.Thompson cited a case study
of a street in Copenhagen. Denmark, which under
went a similar change.
"In this example, there was the same kind of
push back as the retail store said 'No way. This
would kill my business. " Thompson noted. "But
once they actually built the pedestrian mall, they
found that their business increased from 25 to 40
percent. Once a pedestrian mall is well-created,
you're increasing foot traffic by about 1000 per
cent. and increasing foot traffic is better than
increasing car traffic."
Hughes said that the group began its project
with the goal of reducing gas consumption in the
surrounding community.
"And what better way to reduce that than to
encourage alternative transportation." he said.
"More biking and walking, and less
sitting in traffic."
Thompson said that the team
began by finding and talking to mer
chants and other community mem
bers on I Jniversity Avenue.
"We basically found that the
street is not an efficient use of space
for pedestrians or motor vehicles." he
said. "Cars hate it because it's always
clogged, and pedestrians hate it for
the same reason."
Thompson said that the team
wanted to figure out how to use this
space in a more efficient way. Ibis led
them to develop a number of proto
types. ultimately leading them to the

idea of creating a pedestrian mall.
Mahale said that while reducing
gas consumption was a starting point
that pushed the team in a particular
direction, once they explored the
problems on University Avenue, they
found a lot of other needs for the use
of that space.
"There was a big parking problem
that people spoke about." she said.
"University Avenue has a two-hour
parking limit. Some bus owners
would leave customers behind to re
park their cars in order to avoid
parking tickets."
"It took 10 or 15 minutes to move
their car," Thompson added. "So
they're wasting gas just to move from
spot to spot."
The team members agreed that
the point of their project was to facil
itate a discussion about this idea and
engage experts and policy makers in

order to actually make a change in
the city.
"We're getting emails on a daily
basis from urban planners that have,
or are currently working for the city."
Thompson said. "We're getting
emails from them daily saying "How
can I help? How can I volunteer my
time to help your effort out?" Even
though we're not experts, we're also
in the business of organizing people
who are experts."
Thompson encouraged under
graduates and other members of the
Stanford community who are inter
ested in supporting the project to
join the Facebook group titled "Palo
Alto Pedestrian Mall" or sign the
petition at http://paloaltopedestrian
