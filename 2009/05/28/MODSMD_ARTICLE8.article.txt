I slid into Eric Saar's '09 car to begin the
"The Game" — an all-night puzzle-solving
extravaganza — and his initial query
asserted my place for the evening. I was a
reporter, tagging along with an experi
enced quartet of puzzle-solving extraordi
naires, in an attempt to gain an insider look
at one of Stanford's time-honored tradi
tions.
Students play The Game in teams, and
Saar. Daniel Aisen "09, Daniel Gibson '09
and Francis Chung '09 made up perhaps
the best group in a field of a couple dozen
squads. Their car was stocked with the
essentials for the night: computers, cheat
sheets for various ciphers, bite-size candies
and a power adapter.
Our specific contest was the Roble
Game, facilitated by dorm members and
staff, and one of many Games run during
the year. Gibson crafted last year's version
of this particular event, which Aisen's and
Chung's team won. For this group of sen
iors, the 2009 Roble Game had the feel of
a last hurrah. Our name, fittingly, was Team
God.
"We're the odds-on-favorites." Saar
said confidently as we drove to the Gilbert
Biological Sciences building, The Game's
starting point.
"Self-proclaimed odds-on-favorites."

Gibson corrected. He would be Saar's foil
for much of the night, a moderating voice
to contrast his teammate's lofty assertions.
The Game's layout is simple in theory
— solve a dozen logic puzzles that range
from deciphering reverse audio files to
relating noble gases to warships. It started
at around 7 p.m. on Friday, and ended at
noon on Saturday — the first team to com
plete all tasks wins. Each answer points to
a specific location, where another puzzle
awaits — this took us as far south as
Fremont and as far north as Oakland.
The Game is themed. so throughout the
night, our cross-Bay trek led us to the anti
dote to a squirrel-flu pandemic. We got our
marching orders and first problem at
Gilbert, and were sent on our way.The ini
tial puzzle was relatively easy — a few
Google searches of past Oscar winners
provided us the answers we needed, and
after a quick rearrangement of an ana
gram, we headed to the second location,
also on campus.
By that point, we were fairly sure that
we were trailing — a fact that was later
confirmed — but Aisen was unfazed.
"The first clue is pretty random." he
said. "It takes a while to see who is for
real."
Yet despite our initial position. Team
God took the lead after the third clue, and
we never looked back.
We started The Game at a slight disad
vantage. as Chung, who Aisen repeatedly
referred to as the "all-star," had yet to
return from a trip to Las Vegas — we
picked him up in San Jose during the mid
dle of the fourth clue.
"You know what Francis is doing in

Vegas?" Saar asked a member of one of
the other experienced teams in the field
during the meeting at Gilbert. "Putting a
bet on us to win."
Regardless of Chung's intentions in Sin

City, his absence meant that, for the time
being, I was more than just a scribe — I
actually had to contribute. This was a bit of
an issue. My natural talents — limited to
begin with — do not include an eye for
amino acid combinations or Morse code
ciphers. The most I could add to our effort
was on our third clue, when 1 was able to
solve a simple riddle, determine that a
Sudoku was impossible and trace my way
through a maze — basically, I was as
accomplished as your average high school
freshman.
My skills paled in comparison to those
of my teammates, but interestingly, half the
battle was over the phone, and not over the
clues. Back at Stanford, The Game organ
izers set up a control room in Gates, where
they manned their cells for the entire
night. Some squads called in to test their
answers; others dialed in for hints, which
came at the cost of a 15-. 30- or 45-minute
time penalty.
But in between the two was the back
and-forth between participants who want
help but didn't want formalized hints, and
organizers who didn't want to betray too
much information. A savvy team member
could extract just enough data to make
the clues a bit easier, without taking a
penalty.
On our team, this job was designated to
Aisen, who spent just about as much time
talking to the command center as he did to
us. By the end of the night, he wasn't even
introducing himself or his team when he
phoned in — a simple "It's me again" suf
ficed.
Aisen was diligent to the point of obses
sive. In the early morning, a clue gave us

the initial teams of a bracket — think
March Madness — and, based on the
words' suffixes and prefixes, we had to
determine the next round's squad, which
was entirely different from the original
teams. Aisen phoned in every single entry
— dozens in total — to see if we were on
the right track.Tacit confirmation — "That
sounds all right to me" seemed to be a
common theme — kept us moving.
And move we did. from a Safeway in
Fremont, where we had to locate different
products and combine them to generate a
word, to the Spanish-American War
Memorial in San Francisco's Union
Square, where the name of a noble gas was
hidden amongst the various ships that
fought in the conflict.
Eventually, we received our last order
— return to Stanford and go to Gates,
where we would have to solve one final
clue. We sauntered in before 8 a.m., sleep
deprived but leading the pack. Our final
problem involved shape combinations and
basic chemistry, the answer to which was
the antidote to the squirrel-flu pandemic. 1
was of no help, so 1 sat back and let the
masters take one last crack at the final puz
zle.
"We" solved it at exactly 8:21 a.m., and
walked out of Gates victorious. We passed
our rival team, with whom Saar had
exchanged jeers at Gilbert just 14 hours
before. But instead of trash talk, there was
a slight wave and a nod of the head — sur
viving The Game was reason enough to be
proud.

Aisen, who spent just about as much time
talking to the command center as he did to
us. By the end of the night, he wasn't even
introducing himself or his team when he
phoned in — a simple "It's me again" suf
ficed.
Aisen was diligent to the point of obses
sive. In the early morning, a clue gave us

the initial teams of a bracket — think
March Madness — and, based on the
words' suffixes and prefixes, we had to
determine the next round's squad, which
was entirely different from the original
teams. Aisen phoned in every single entry
— dozens in total — to see if we were on
the right track.Tacit confirmation — "That
sounds all right to me" seemed to be a
common theme — kept us moving.
And move we did. from a Safeway in
Fremont, where we had to locate different
products and combine them to generate a
word, to the Spanish-American War
Memorial in San Francisco's Union
Square, where the name of a noble gas was
hidden amongst the various ships that
fought in the conflict.
Eventually, we received our last order
— return to Stanford and go to Gates,
where we would have to solve one final
clue. We sauntered in before 8 a.m., sleep
deprived but leading the pack. Our final
problem involved shape combinations and
basic chemistry, the answer to which was
the antidote to the squirrel-flu pandemic. 1
was of no help, so 1 sat back and let the
masters take one last crack at the final puz
zle.
"We" solved it at exactly 8:21 a.m., and
walked out of Gates victorious. We passed
our rival team, with whom Saar had
exchanged jeers at Gilbert just 14 hours
before. But instead of trash talk, there was
a slight wave and a nod of the head — sur
viving The Game was reason enough to be
proud.
