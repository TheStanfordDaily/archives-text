## EDITORIAL Hennessy should urge Congress to pass DREAM Act 
### 
This month. Harvard President Drew
Faust publicly announced her support
for the 2009 Development, Relief and
Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act.
The DREAM Act proposes allowing undoc
umented immigrant students who graduate
from U.S. high schools to obtain "condition
al" legal permanent-resident status if they at
tend college or serve in the military for two
years during a six-year period of temporary
residency.
Several versions of the DREAM Act
have been introduced in Congress before.
First proposed in 2001. the immigration bill
has been considered by the 107 th. 108 th,
and 110 th Congresses. The 2009
DREAM Act was reintroduced in both the
House and the Senate this March with the
support of many Democratic and Republi
can leaders, including co-sponsors Senators
Richard Durbin (D-lII.) and Richard Eugar
(R-Idaho). It is high time that Congress
passed the DREAM Act in order to open
up social and educational opportunities to
those undocumented children who arrived
in the U.S. before their 16th birthday.These
young men and women should not be pe
nalized for their parents' decision to immi
grate to the U.S. illegally; instead, we should
allow them to develop to their full poten
tial.
'Hie editorial board urges Stanford Uni
versity President John Hennessy to follow
Harvard President Faust's admirable lead
and take a stand in support of the 2009
DREAM Act. Many at Stanford may be sur
prised to know that this immigration issue
directly affects our academic community. On
May 7, Mark Silverman, director of Immi
gration Policy at the Hay Area-based Immi
grant Legal Resource Center, conducted a
teach-in about the DREAM Act on campus.
A number of undocumented, currently en
rolled students attended and participated in
the program.

Clearly, this is an issue that Stanford has
an interest in pursuing. It is difficult enough
for immigrant high school graduates to
make it into the realm of higher education.
According to a College Board report, about
65.000 undocumented children who have
lived in the U.S. for at least five years — and
who therefore would be most directly affect
ed by the DREAM Act's passage — gradu
ate from American high schools each year.
Most of these undocumented graduates will
never make it to college, even though they
can legally attend, because their legal status
bars them from receiving most types of fi
nancial aid.
The College Board points out that the
DREAM Act would give 360,000 undocu
mented high school graduates a legal means
to work and attend college, while providing
increased incentive for another 715,000 stu
dents to complete high school and pursue a
college education. Making college more af
fordable and accessible for these undocu
mented students would have significant so
cial and economic benefits, since workers
with higher education levels are, on the
whole, more productive, pay higher taxes
and more likely to live healthy lifestyles.
The Stanford administration should take
a strong position in support of the DREAM
Act. We may not know who they are. but
Stanford's undocumented students deserve
a fair chance at success, as do their counter
parts who have not yet entered post-second
ary education. With the value of a high
school diploma on the decline, it is more im
portant than ever that undocumented immi
grant students — many of whom have been
raised in the U.S. and received their primary
and secondary education here — have the
opportunity to fulfill their potential through
higher education. As an institution dedicat
ed to preparing students to contribute mean
ingfully to society, Stanford has a duty to
help make this dream a reality.
