# The 						Way Out [was] Through: Nine Inch Nails

### 
Watching Trent Reznor preen and grin through his band's 1.5-hour set Sunday night at the Gorge, you'd
have no idea that Nine Inch Nails have made a whole career singing about madness and isolation over pun
ishing drums and eardrum-shattering guitars. Even before the band took the stage, yours truly knew we were
in for something different — at least fifteen additional lighting rigs were hoisted above the Gorge than had
been there tor Kings of Leon, and the pit crowd was decidedly, well, much more male and much more
humongous than had showed up for The Decembrists or Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Reznor didn't disappoint, deliv
ering a blistering set that only half of Intermission could endure for the full duration in the pit. The band
sounded crisp on its new material from "Year Zero" and"The Slip," but as was expected, it was the classic
stuff that really set the crowd on fire. It was nearly impossible to find a face in the crowd not singing every
word to " lerrible Lie or "Head Like a Hole, and Reznor and company took both signature pieces over the
edge, playing with the cohesiveness and passion that's come to define the band's live performances. At 20
songs, the set was ridiculously long by festival standards, and the band's tenacity throughout seemed a clear
indicator as to why they've outlived many of their grunge/metal counterparts that came of age in the early
to mid '90s. After 19 punishing tracks, though, the band's final song arrived — the addiction-minded mas
terpiece "Hurt." "You could have it all ..." Reznor sang as the last bit of light disappeared over the edge of
the Columbia River Gorge. He wasn't exaggerating — we did.
