# Ocean Size: Jane's Addiction
## 
### 
Keeping in tune with the main stage's late-night theme of early'9os alt-rock
the newly reunited Jane's Addiction delivered a much shorter set than the pre
ceding Nine Inch Nails, hut the crowd hardly seemed to care. While Jane's was
n't necessarily at the top of Intermission's list of hands to see 1 your corrcspon
dents were far more excited that they'd he pulling so many fans away from thi
weekend's most hard-hitting electronic act, Deadmaus), there was a huge con
tingent that couldn't be more excited to see Perry Ferrell and company takin;
the stage and rock-star preening like it was 1991 all over again. Ferrell, at 50
has certainly lost some of his front-man glamour, hut it still seems like lie's tin
only 50-year-old out there who could ask the audience for "drugs... don'

want booze, or even panties.
You guys been out here for a
few days, so no panties ...
but 1 will take marijuana,
and some smaller things," or
thank the crowd for "getting
my [you guessed it| hard."
Dave Navarro, at 41, is still
one of the fiercest guitarists
in music, and the main stage
camera operator seemed
obsessed with pulling close
up shots of his fingers
(which, yes, were moving
very, very fast). The band
sounded best at the begin
ning ("Three Days") and the
end (radio classics "Stop!"
and "Jane Says"), and only
mediocre in between, but it
didn't seem to matter — the
fans were there to see the
reunited lane's Addiction,
like many fans out to sec
their favorite band after
extensive hiatuses, and
Intermission was entertained

simply by any of Fcrrcll's edi
torializing. I he best of the night: "We came up here when Kurt Cobain was still
alive. We traded funky sunglasses. We had gre.it parties. This is iust another one
lor the books!" It absolutely was.
