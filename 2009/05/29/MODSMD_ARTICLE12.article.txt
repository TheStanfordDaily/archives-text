# Only By the Night: Kings of Leon
## 
### 
In 2007, Rolling Stone wondered, "How
good can the Kings of Leon get? They've
already gone further than anybody could have
guessed." As Intermission found out on
Saturday night, the answer is that they can get
much, much better. Kings were one of the big
disappointments of the festival, particularly
given their reputation for putting on great live
shows. Kings were simply off on this night,
missing some of their lyrics and struggling to
transition smoothly between songs. They
looked much more like the twangy, feedback
drenched rockers of their "Youth and Young
Manhood" days when they were accustomed
to playing clubs, as opposed to the more
sophisticated artists behind "Because of the
Times" and "Only By the Night" who are now
expected to headline festivals. The Kings
blitzed through the hits from the two recent
albums, eliciting thousands of voices to sing
along with recent hits "Sex on Fire" and "Use
Somebody," but the band seemed largely out
of place, particularly since they followed a
pitch-perfect set by Yeah Yeah Ycahs. On a
smaller stage, Kings of Leon may have been
far more successful, but as they struggled to
fill the epic Gorge main stage with their fuzzy
Southern sound, it quickly became clear that
in-studio brilliance doesn't always equate to
on-stage performance.
