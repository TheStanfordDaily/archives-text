# Shimmer and Shine: Ben Harper and the Relentless 7
## 
### 
After 35 bands, 45 bottles of water, over 20 peanut-but
ter-and-banana sandwiches and one near disaster from
heat exhaustion, Intermission settled down in the grass
with the dwindling festival crowd to take in a set from
Ben Harper and his newly formed outfit, the Relentless
7 (who, paradoxically, number only three), and even in
the waning hours of the festival, Harper and his band
did not disappoint. Long known for channeling both
Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix, Harper seemed all
Hendrix here, eschewing his better-known acoustic sta
ples like "Burn One Down" and "Steal My Kisses" for the
harder-sounding, more guitar-driven rock of his new
album with the Relentless 7, "White Lies for Dark

Times." While in the past Harper has played his entire
show seated with his trademark slide guitar, Harper
came out standing and blazing, ripping through tracks
from the new album before sitting down with the slide.
While this seemed to indicate a mellowing of the set, it
was nothing but, with the Relentless 7 launching into a
fuzzy, guitar-driven spectacle of a song called "Shimmer
and Shine," and following it up with a cover of
Zeppelin's "Good Times, Bad Times" that made your
correspondents forget they had been through three
straight days of sun and had gotten little to no sleep.
The set was fantastic, but alas, traffic reports predicted
an eight-hour trip back to Seattle for those that stayed
until the bitter end, and seeing as Intermission had a 6
a.m. Tuesday flight back to the bay, we had to cut
Harper's set short. Needless to say, though, that even
after 17 years of making music, Harper sounds as fresh
as ever, and with a new band and a new sound, it seems
certain that he'll be captivating festival audiences for
years more to come.
