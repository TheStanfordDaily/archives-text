# Sun Giants: Fleet Foxes
## 
### 
Fleet Foxes were the hometown heroes this week
end, and they had no qualms about playing to it, asking
the crowd "Are there any Kangs out there?" (Fleet Foxes'
mascot at Lake Washington High School in suburban
Seattle) before launching into their first song. Following
the manic energy of Gogol Bordello's main stage per
formance, the Foxes brought the crowd in an entirely dif
ferent direction, their mellow folk-rock sedating the
audience and seemingly reminding everyone that they
had indeed been at an outdoor festival for two and a half
days and were probably by now getting to be quite tired.
They are a remarkably new band (their complete discog
raphy clocks out at a little over an hour) and were per
haps the most humble act of the weekend, setting up
their own stage and sound-checking before launching
into the set. With four vocalists in a band of five, tht
Foxes produced the same lush harmonies that propelled

their 2008 releases, a self-titled album and the
five-song EP "Sun Giant" to prominence. And
as was the case with so many other acts this
weekend, the Gorges lush natural setting
played right into the Foxes harmony driven
brand of folk-rock. The band debuted some
material from their highly anticipated 2009
release, but it was material from the self-titled
album that held the crowd's rapt attention.
There was nary a mouth not singing along to
the show's most memorable songs: "White
Winter Hymnyl," "Blue Ridge Mountains"
and "Ragged Wood." Robin Pecknold's sim
ple, engaging lyrics and the great stage chem
istry of the band displayed a group that was
overjoyed to be playing such a massive venue
in its home state, and the entire performance
seemed indicative of a band only beginning
to hit its creative stride.
