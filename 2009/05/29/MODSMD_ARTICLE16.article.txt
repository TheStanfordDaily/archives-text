# The 						Hazards of Cliff Sex: The Decembrists
## 
### 
There probably hasn't been a more polarizing record on the
indie/alternative front this year than "The Hazards of Love," the new
concept album from Portland folk-rock outfit The Decembrists.
Lead singer Colin Meloy told Paste magazine that "Hazards" was
"initially conceived as a musical... but I decided about halfway
through my time in France that it wasn't going to work as a stage
piece. But it would still work as a rock record, so that's where it
ended up."
The theatrics of "Hazards" were on full display Saturday night at
the Gorge, where Meloy and company ran through the album in its
entirety before an absolutely packed main stage audience. The
Decembrists are a band defined by their absurdity and unpre
dictability— this is to be expected of a band whose first true con
cept album deals with a woman who falls for a shape-shifting forest
dweller and is pursued by a jealous forest queen — and the band's
offbeat style fit perfectly with Sasquatch's overall alternative-to-alter
native-music-festivals vibe. Meloy has never sounded better onstage,
his unique nasal voice perfectly suited for the forest shape-shifter
and played brilliantly against guest vocalist Becky Stark's Margaret.
If ever there were a perfect venue to spin their hyperbole, The
Decembrists found it in the Gorge — the albums main reprise, "The
Wanting Comes in Waves," could have been an anthem for the week
end, its backing hymnals echoing beautifully off the Gorge's canyon
walls at sunset. The melodies were so perfect, in fact, that one couple

saw fit to take in The Decembrists' set by
. how do we say it... taking in each

other atop an adjacent cliff face. As
the crowd of thousands turned

from the stage to cheer on the
lovebirds as they were pulled
apart by security, Meloy

smiled from the stage and
waved them goodbye as
Stark cried out (aptly,

from the song),
"Consider it your
debt repaid." The
wanting comes
in waves,
indeed.
