# No Bombs Are Fallin' on Me Fa Sho!: TV on the Radio
## 
### 
TV on the Radio was among the most highly anticipated bands of the
weekend, and their ravaging one-hour set preceding the early '90s
marathon of Nine Inch Nails and Jane's Addiction proved why they
were the indie rock darlings of 2008. Last year's "Dear Science" was a
watershed moment for the band — the convergence of dynamic,
socially conscious lyrics combined with a sound that was completely
unique to the industry — and this combination was on full display
Sunday night at the Gorge. Vocalist Tunde Adebimpe was at his fist
pumping best, whipping the crowd into a frenzy with his fast-paced
lyrics and non-stop energy. Guitarist Kyp Malone kept the pace frantic
with his unique and driving playing style, and bassist Gerard Smith and
drummer David Sitek played brilliantly, almost always obscured from
view by the sheer amount of musical equipment each was handling.
The band dipped in and out of its canon (the percussion-loaded "A

Method was a definite highlight, as were Adebimpe's punishing vocals on "Wolf Like Me"), but they were clearly
at their best with tracks from Science — "Red Dress" exploded over the Gorge with full-on rage and crescendo, and
the pop-funk vibe of "Crying 1 had the crowd dancing even after spending the better part of the day in 90-degree
heat.
Guitarist Kyp Malone quipped early on,"I wish 1 could tell my teenaged self I'd play on the same stage as lane's
Addiction." I V on the Radio did much more than play the same stage as Jane's Addiction — they completely out
shined them.
