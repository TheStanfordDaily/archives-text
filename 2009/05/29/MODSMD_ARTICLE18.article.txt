# Material Things: Animal Collective
## 
### 
Animal Collective played some of the weirdest, most eclectic,
most memorable music of the weekend, and it certainly wasn't
for everyone. The band has little stage presence — it's essen
tially a trio of timid-looking electro-geeks (Avey Tare, Panda
Bear and Geologist) behind keyboards and mixing tables —
but with this band, it was all about the music. Coming off
nearly universal acclaim for their album "Merriweather Post
Pavilion," AC has been playing small club shows in between
bringing their expansive sound to major outdoor festivals; and
their ambient mix of pop vocals, keyboards and feedback
played well in front of the Gorge's larger-than-life vista. Animal
Collective is a band that demands attention from the listener
— for someone not experienced with their music, seeing them
live would probably be somewhat of a difficult experience, but
your correspondents, all huge Merriweather fans, were in heav
en. The band drew heavily from the album, with its lead single
"My Girls" emerging as the clear highlight of a slow-building,
ambitious late afternoon set. For those not willing to be patient
with the band, the set was likely forgettable when compared
with more accessible sets that day by The Decembrists, Bon
Iver and Kings of Leon, but for those willing to listen and go
along with Animal Collective's strange and unique vibe, their
set proved to be one of the finest Sasquatch had to offer.
