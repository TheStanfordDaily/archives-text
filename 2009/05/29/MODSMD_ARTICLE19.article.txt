# Forego the Parable: Bon Iver
## 
### 
One of the clear highlights of the festival for acoustic
fans was Bon Iver, the much-lauded new project from
Wisconsin-based singer-songwriter Justin Vernon.
Taking the second stage as the sun had just finished set
ling, Vernon and his outfit treated fans to a lush, mellow
set that showed off his virtuosic songwriting ability and
incredible vocal range. Bon Iver's debut, "For Emma,
Forever Ago ..." was conceived and written by Vernon
during three months of self-imposed isolation in a
remote Wisconsin cabin, and the album's central themes
of love and loss amid a landscape of desolation were
constantly revisited during the one-hour set. Vernon's
backing band, half of them sporting truly gnarly retro
Chicago Bulls jerseys, were perfect, providing the per
fect mellow backdrop to Vernon's remarkably gifted
tenor, without ever outstripping or outshining the star
of the show. While the album's most popular track
"Skinny Love" drew the greatest crowd response,
onlookers seemed hinged on Vernon's every lyric, from
the heartbreaking dialogue of "For Emma, Forever Ago
..." to the absolutely stunning "Creature Fear," origi

nally released as a lonesome solo ballad by Vernon, but
now imbued with a renewed sense of optimism and
grandeur by backing vocals and instrumentals. Skipping
most of Kings of Leon for the less road-tested Hon Iver
could certainly have been a gamble, but your correspon
dents couldn't have been happier â€” Bon Iver played
one of the most emotionally wrought and dynamic sets
of the weekend, and we can only hope they will contin
ue to make the kind of music they treated us to Saturday
night.
