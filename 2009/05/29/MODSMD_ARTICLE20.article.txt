# Wow: Gogol Bordello
## 
### 
Gogol Bordello is a multi-ethic Gypsy punk band from the Lower East
Side of Manhattan. As you would imagine from that description, noth
ing your correspondents can say could ever do justice to them, but here
are our scattered thoughts: drunken pirate in neon pirate hat as lead
singer. Old shirtless man playing the fiddle. Two 6'-plus Asian women
who played only a marching band style bass drum and cymbals, respec
tively. Drunken pirate playing a bucket. Drunken pirate playing accor
dion. Drunken pirate playing everyone else's instruments. Entire crowd
dancing a kind of polka-hip-hop hybrid. A crowd-surfing, middle-aged
Ukrainian. A freaking accordion.
If you ever, ever get a chance to see this band, don't even think twice.
Absolutely the most fun, absurd, hilarious, energetic, wonderfully eccen
tric surprise of the weekend.
