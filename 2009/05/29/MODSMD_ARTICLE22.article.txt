Since micro-blogging is all the rage these days, Intermission set out to tweet the entire
Sasquatch festival for this article. Unfortunately, as the Gorge is in the middle of
nowhere and has the capacity to support only eight to nine cell phones at a time, this
HAD TO BE DONE BY HAND AFTER ABOUT 3 P.M. ON SATURDAY. ENJOY!

5/21 9:30 p.m.: Intermission just landed in Seattle! Looking forward to an incredible
weekend!
5/23 8:14 a.m.: Heading to the Gorge ... word on the street is a 17-mile backup going
in? We'll see how this goes ...
5/23 9:42 a.m.: On the road towards #Sasquatch — anybody else?
5/23 1:04 p.m.: Envelope order at press tent ... Rolling Stone... Spin .. .
@Stanford Daily ... can you say "legit music journalists?"
5/23 2:56 p.m.: Great early sets by @dovesmusicblog and @passionpit, both bands worth
checking out...
5/23 3:34 p.m.: #Sasquatch is half the size of Coachella and arguably the better lineup:
Intermission thought Indio was beautiful, but man . ..
5/23 5:14 p.m.: Mt. St. Helens Vietnam band has a 14-year old drummer. Their hit song
switches from 4/4 to 5/4 time effortlessly. Ridiculous.
5/23 5:37 p.m.: Waiting on Animal Collective, first band we're absolutely psyched to see.
5/23 6:40 p.m.: AC killed it onstage — Merriweather all sounds incredible in vivo.
5/23 6:43 p.m.: $9 beers and $10 mini pizzas — good thing @sdatsasquatch brought
plenty of banana sandwiches
5/23 6:57 p.m.: Waiting on The Decembrists ... wondering if it'll be full gig of Hazards
or a mix.
5/23 7:20 p.m.: Looks like it'll be Hazards straight through — band sounds amazing.
5/23 7:34 p.m.: Couple going to bonetown on the cliffs at the rear of the stage! Colin
Meloy salutes them from the stage ... still the wanting comes in waves!!
5/23 8:00 p.m.: Hazards of Love played perfectly here. What a beautiful set.
5/23 8:54 p.m.: Yeah Yeah Yeahs lived up to their reputation, an absolutely insane set
anchored by Karen O looking like Janis Joplin 2009. Over to Bon Iver.
5/23 9:47 p.m.: Bon Iver was a definite highlight, a huge vocal range, gorgeous songs,
gorgeous sunset. Today has been even better than advertised.
5/23 10:28 p.m.: @kingsofleonfans aren't living up to it — great on CD but letting us
down here. We can hear the ragefest in the dance tent, off to check Crystal Castles.
5/23 11:42 p.m.: Still wiping off our (and others') sweat from an insane time in the
dance tent with Crystal Castles. Glad to end the day with pure nonstop dance.
5/23 11:58 p.m.: Bedtime kids — up early to hike down to the Columbia River before
the shows get started.

5/24 9:42 a.m.: Up early to hike down to the river. Shampoo in tow, going to bathe there.
Very old world of us.

5/24 12:22 p.m.: Wow. Wow wow wow wow — this plate is absolutely magical. Jumping
in the river felt like a fairy tale. Saturday's all washed off, now ready for Day 2.
5/24 3:49 p.m.: Solid stuff from Calexico and St. Vincent.. . lots of smaller acts today
before the big show of TVOTR-NIN-JA on the main stage.
5/24 6:20 p.m.: Openly gay band we'd never heard called the Murder City Devils just
melted everyone's faces off!
5/24 6:21 p.m.: The next two or three of these arc MCD quotes — all will probably not
survive editing, but all were incredible
5/24 6:22 p.m.: "A lot now, we play these shows in front of a lot of people, and 1 see a lot
of gross, disgusting high-school jocks in the audience ....
5/24 6:22 p.m.: "... But what we do is for all the beautiful faggots, and the rest of you
can all eat a big bowl of wet dicks ..."
5/24 6:23 p.m.: "1 may be stepping out of bounds, but all the heterosexuals in the audi
ence, all the straights, can just turn around and face the other way."
5/24 6:24 p.m.: If you don't turn around, I'll accept that you're homos, just like all of us
up on the stage."
5/24 6:25 p.m.: TVOTR is one of the most anticipated acts of the show, but the crowd
still feels electric from Murder City Devils.
5/24 7:09 p.m.: TVOTR showing why they were one of the most talked-about bands in
rock last year.
5/24 8:02 p.m.: Few minutes from NIN — probably no tweets until we're well away
from here, not risking taking my phone out in this pit.
5/24 8:45 p.m.: Insanity. Half of Intermission just crowd surfed to escape the monsters
in there.
5/24 10:24 p.m.: Trying to end two nights in a row with some hard n heavy dance stuff
— heading over to see Deadmaus. Jane's who?
5/24 11:34 p.m.: Again, mission accomplished.

5/25 12:43 p.m.: Another great hike — psyched for Grizzly Bear, whose new album is
supposed to be the release of'o9.
5/25 1:10 p.m.: Intermission is nearly out of food — hopefully we can pull this off and
avoid all the gross $15 meal options inside the venue.
5/25 1:43 p.m.: Oh no! They've started cutting off media from leaving and re-entering.
We suspect Intermission leaving to stock up on libations has to do w/ this ...
5/25 2:40 p.m.: What a great, complicated set out of Grizz B. Lots of Yellow House and
new stuff as well, can't wait to hear the album.
