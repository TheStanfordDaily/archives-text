Since micro-blogging is all the rage these days, Intermission set out to tweet the entire
Sasquatch festival for this article. Unfortunately, as the Gorge is in the middle of
nowhere and has the capacity to support only eight to nine cell phones at a time, this
HAD TO BE DONE BY HAND AFTER ABOUT 3 P.M. ON SATURDAY. ENJOY!

5/21 9:30 p.m.: Intermission just landed in Seattle! Looking forward to an incredible
weekend!
5/23 8:14 a.m.: Heading to the Gorge ... word on the street is a 17-mile backup going
in? We'll see how this goes ...
5/23 9:42 a.m.: On the road towards #Sasquatch — anybody else?
5/23 1:04 p.m.: Envelope order at press tent ... Rolling Stone... Spin .. .
@Stanford Daily ... can you say "legit music journalists?"
5/23 2:56 p.m.: Great early sets by @dovesmusicblog and @passionpit, both bands worth
checking out...
5/23 3:34 p.m.: #Sasquatch is half the size of Coachella and arguably the better lineup:
Intermission thought Indio was beautiful, but man . ..
5/23 5:14 p.m.: Mt. St. Helens Vietnam band has a 14-year old drummer. Their hit song
switches from 4/4 to 5/4 time effortlessly. Ridiculous.
5/23 5:37 p.m.: Waiting on Animal Collective, first band we're absolutely psyched to see.
5/23 6:40 p.m.: AC killed it onstage — Merriweather all sounds incredible in vivo.
5/23 6:43 p.m.: $9 beers and $10 mini pizzas — good thing @sdatsasquatch brought
plenty of banana sandwiches
5/23 6:57 p.m.: Waiting on The Decembrists ... wondering if it'll be full gig of Hazards
or a mix.
5/23 7:20 p.m.: Looks like it'll be Hazards straight through — band sounds amazing.
5/23 7:34 p.m.: Couple going to bonetown on the cliffs at the rear of the stage! Colin
Meloy salutes them from the stage ... still the wanting comes in waves!!
5/23 8:00 p.m.: Hazards of Love played perfectly here. What a beautiful set.
5/23 8:54 p.m.: Yeah Yeah Yeahs lived up to their reputation, an absolutely insane set
anchored by Karen O looking like Janis Joplin 2009. Over to Bon Iver.
5/23 9:47 p.m.: Bon Iver was a definite highlight, a huge vocal range, gorgeous songs,
gorgeous sunset. Today has been even better than advertised.
5/23 10:28 p.m.: @kingsofleonfans aren't living up to it — great on CD but letting us
down here. We can hear the ragefest in the dance tent, off to check Crystal Castles.
5/23 11:42 p.m.: Still wiping off our (and others') sweat from an insane time in the
dance tent with Crystal Castles. Glad to end the day with pure nonstop dance.
5/23 11:58 p.m.: Bedtime kids — up early to hike down to the Columbia River before
the shows get started.

5/24 9:42 a.m.: Up early to hike down to the river. Shampoo in tow, going to bathe there.
Very old world of us.

5/24 12:22 p.m.: Wow. Wow wow wow wow — this plate is absolutely magical. Jumping
in the river felt like a fairy tale. Saturday's all washed off, now ready for Day 2.
5/24 3:49 p.m.: Solid stuff from Calexico and St. Vincent.. . lots of smaller acts today
before the big show of TVOTR-NIN-JA on the main stage.
5/24 6:20 p.m.: Openly gay band we'd never heard called the Murder City Devils just
melted everyone's faces off!
5/24 6:21 p.m.: The next two or three of these arc MCD quotes — all will probably not
survive editing, but all were incredible
5/24 6:22 p.m.: "A lot now, we play these shows in front of a lot of people, and 1 see a lot
of gross, disgusting high-school jocks in the audience ....
5/24 6:22 p.m.: "... But what we do is for all the beautiful faggots, and the rest of you
can all eat a big bowl of wet dicks ..."
5/24 6:23 p.m.: "1 may be stepping out of bounds, but all the heterosexuals in the audi
ence, all the straights, can just turn around and face the other way."
5/24 6:24 p.m.: If you don't turn around, I'll accept that you're homos, just like all of us
up on the stage."
5/24 6:25 p.m.: TVOTR is one of the most anticipated acts of the show, but the crowd
still feels electric from Murder City Devils.
5/24 7:09 p.m.: TVOTR showing why they were one of the most talked-about bands in
rock last year.
5/24 8:02 p.m.: Few minutes from NIN — probably no tweets until we're well away
from here, not risking taking my phone out in this pit.
5/24 8:45 p.m.: Insanity. Half of Intermission just crowd surfed to escape the monsters
in there.
5/24 10:24 p.m.: Trying to end two nights in a row with some hard n heavy dance stuff
— heading over to see Deadmaus. Jane's who?
5/24 11:34 p.m.: Again, mission accomplished.

5/25 12:43 p.m.: Another great hike — psyched for Grizzly Bear, whose new album is
supposed to be the release of'o9.
5/25 1:10 p.m.: Intermission is nearly out of food — hopefully we can pull this off and
avoid all the gross $15 meal options inside the venue.
5/25 1:43 p.m.: Oh no! They've started cutting off media from leaving and re-entering.
We suspect Intermission leaving to stock up on libations has to do w/ this ...
5/25 2:40 p.m.: What a great, complicated set out of Grizz B. Lots of Yellow House and
new stuff as well, can't wait to hear the album.

5/25 3:22 p.m.: Santigold dancc party.
5/25 3:50 p.m.: Whitest Kids U Know were hilarious! Finished set
by bringing crowd outside tent to launch water balloons at the
Wookie Stage. Perfect.
5/25 4:40 p.m.: GOGOL BORDELLO! We just saw a pirate, a fid
dler, a marching band and an accordionist get this whole hipster
crowd to do a polka.
5/25 5:10 p.m.: Really filling up for hometown heroes Fleet
Foxes. Hope to hear some new stuff.
5/25 5:18 p.m.: FF sound checking/tuning all their own instru
ments — so much about them still seems like a high school
band! Must be daunting to take this stage ...
5/25 5:43 p.m.: FF sound great, harmonies are awesome in this
setting.
5/25 5:54 p.m.: Just left FF early ... one of your correspondents
just passed out from heat exhaustion — this is why you drink
water in 90 degree heat, kids.
5/25 6:49 p.m.: INT is recovering at the picnic tables, getting
strength up for last push of the weekend — Girl Talk to
Explosions to BH&R7 to Chromeo.
5/25 7:28 p.m.: Absolutely PACKED for Girl Talk.
5/25 8:19 p.m.: GT absolutely stole the show — crowd was into
everything, felt like a huge party in the middle of a more laid
back third day.
5/25 8:36 p.m.: "You just saw Girl Talk, well let me introduce you
to me and mine — we're called Serious Talk, from Texas" —
Explosions frontman.
5/25 9:02 p.m.: Explosions music was absolutely made for the

Gorge — they sound incredible.
5/25 9:38 p.m.: What a set! Lead guitar broke his strap and
played the last song kneeling and holding the guitar just by the
neck.
5/25 10:01 p.m.: Apparently Ben Harper was late to the stage,
going to catch a few of him and then peace to beat traffic.
5/25 10:34 p.m.: Shimmer N Shine + Led Zep cover both sound
ed great, Relentless 7 is a great new sound for Harper.
5/25 10:54 p.m.: Walking past Chromeo — sounds amazing, but
alas, Intermission flies home in seven hours ...
5/25 11:31 p.m.: Campsite is packed! Heading home to Seattle.
5/26 2:28 a.m.: Bedtime! Up in 92 minutes to catch our flight.
5/26 4:04 a.m.: Wow, so that's what three days of nonstop fun
feels like.
5/26 4:07 a.m.: Your correspondents are way too tired to func
tion.
5/26 5:38 a.m.: Waiting to board ... we must look like the walk
ing dead.
5/26 8:14 a.m.: Wheels down! We made it... now, all we need to
do is make 11 a.m. class.
5/26 10:28 a.m.: Back at Stanford. Exhausted, sunburned, dehy
drated. We gave it our all for you, Stanford Daily! Intermission
over and out.

5/23 1:04 p.m.: Envelope order at press tent ... Rolling Stone... Spin .. .
@Stanford Daily ... can you say "legit music journalists?"
5/23 2:56 p.m.: Great early sets by @dovesmusicblog and @passionpit, both bands worth
checking out...
5/23 3:34 p.m.: #Sasquatch is half the size of Coachella and arguably the better lineup:
Intermission thought Indio was beautiful, but man . ..
5/23 5:14 p.m.: Mt. St. Helens Vietnam band has a 14-year old drummer. Their hit song
switches from 4/4 to 5/4 time effortlessly. Ridiculous.
5/23 5:37 p.m.: Waiting on Animal Collective, first band we're absolutely psyched to see.
5/23 6:40 p.m.: AC killed it onstage — Merriweather all sounds incredible in vivo.
5/23 6:43 p.m.: $9 beers and $10 mini pizzas — good thing @sdatsasquatch brought
plenty of banana sandwiches
5/23 6:57 p.m.: Waiting on The Decembrists ... wondering if it'll be full gig of Hazards
or a mix.
5/23 7:20 p.m.: Looks like it'll be Hazards straight through — band sounds amazing.
5/23 7:34 p.m.: Couple going to bonetown on the cliffs at the rear of the stage! Colin
Meloy salutes them from the stage ... still the wanting comes in waves!!
5/23 8:00 p.m.: Hazards of Love played perfectly here. What a beautiful set.
5/23 8:54 p.m.: Yeah Yeah Yeahs lived up to their reputation, an absolutely insane set
anchored by Karen O looking like Janis Joplin 2009. Over to Bon Iver.
5/23 9:47 p.m.: Bon Iver was a definite highlight, a huge vocal range, gorgeous songs,
gorgeous sunset. Today has been even better than advertised.
5/23 10:28 p.m.: @kingsofleonfans aren't living up to it — great on CD but letting us
down here. We can hear the ragefest in the dance tent, off to check Crystal Castles.
5/23 11:42 p.m.: Still wiping off our (and others') sweat from an insane time in the
dance tent with Crystal Castles. Glad to end the day with pure nonstop dance.
5/23 11:58 p.m.: Bedtime kids — up early to hike down to the Columbia River before
the shows get started.

5/24 9:42 a.m.: Up early to hike down to the river. Shampoo in tow, going to bathe there.
Very old world of us.

5/24 12:22 p.m.: Wow. Wow wow wow wow — this plate is absolutely magical. Jumping
in the river felt like a fairy tale. Saturday's all washed off, now ready for Day 2.
5/24 3:49 p.m.: Solid stuff from Calexico and St. Vincent.. . lots of smaller acts today
before the big show of TVOTR-NIN-JA on the main stage.
5/24 6:20 p.m.: Openly gay band we'd never heard called the Murder City Devils just
melted everyone's faces off!
5/24 6:21 p.m.: The next two or three of these arc MCD quotes — all will probably not
survive editing, but all were incredible
5/24 6:22 p.m.: "A lot now, we play these shows in front of a lot of people, and 1 see a lot
of gross, disgusting high-school jocks in the audience ....
5/24 6:22 p.m.: "... But what we do is for all the beautiful faggots, and the rest of you
can all eat a big bowl of wet dicks ..."
5/24 6:23 p.m.: "1 may be stepping out of bounds, but all the heterosexuals in the audi
ence, all the straights, can just turn around and face the other way."
5/24 6:24 p.m.: If you don't turn around, I'll accept that you're homos, just like all of us
up on the stage."
5/24 6:25 p.m.: TVOTR is one of the most anticipated acts of the show, but the crowd
still feels electric from Murder City Devils.
5/24 7:09 p.m.: TVOTR showing why they were one of the most talked-about bands in
rock last year.
5/24 8:02 p.m.: Few minutes from NIN — probably no tweets until we're well away
from here, not risking taking my phone out in this pit.
5/24 8:45 p.m.: Insanity. Half of Intermission just crowd surfed to escape the monsters
in there.
5/24 10:24 p.m.: Trying to end two nights in a row with some hard n heavy dance stuff
— heading over to see Deadmaus. Jane's who?
5/24 11:34 p.m.: Again, mission accomplished.

5/25 12:43 p.m.: Another great hike — psyched for Grizzly Bear, whose new album is
supposed to be the release of'o9.
5/25 1:10 p.m.: Intermission is nearly out of food — hopefully we can pull this off and
avoid all the gross $15 meal options inside the venue.
5/25 1:43 p.m.: Oh no! They've started cutting off media from leaving and re-entering.
We suspect Intermission leaving to stock up on libations has to do w/ this ...
5/25 2:40 p.m.: What a great, complicated set out of Grizz B. Lots of Yellow House and
new stuff as well, can't wait to hear the album.

5/25 3:22 p.m.: Santigold dancc party.
5/25 3:50 p.m.: Whitest Kids U Know were hilarious! Finished set
by bringing crowd outside tent to launch water balloons at the
Wookie Stage. Perfect.
5/25 4:40 p.m.: GOGOL BORDELLO! We just saw a pirate, a fid
dler, a marching band and an accordionist get this whole hipster
crowd to do a polka.
5/25 5:10 p.m.: Really filling up for hometown heroes Fleet
Foxes. Hope to hear some new stuff.
5/25 5:18 p.m.: FF sound checking/tuning all their own instru
ments — so much about them still seems like a high school
band! Must be daunting to take this stage ...
5/25 5:43 p.m.: FF sound great, harmonies are awesome in this
setting.
5/25 5:54 p.m.: Just left FF early ... one of your correspondents
just passed out from heat exhaustion — this is why you drink
water in 90 degree heat, kids.
5/25 6:49 p.m.: INT is recovering at the picnic tables, getting
strength up for last push of the weekend — Girl Talk to
Explosions to BH&R7 to Chromeo.
5/25 7:28 p.m.: Absolutely PACKED for Girl Talk.
5/25 8:19 p.m.: GT absolutely stole the show — crowd was into
everything, felt like a huge party in the middle of a more laid
back third day.
5/25 8:36 p.m.: "You just saw Girl Talk, well let me introduce you
to me and mine — we're called Serious Talk, from Texas" —
Explosions frontman.
5/25 9:02 p.m.: Explosions music was absolutely made for the

Gorge — they sound incredible.
5/25 9:38 p.m.: What a set! Lead guitar broke his strap and
played the last song kneeling and holding the guitar just by the
neck.
5/25 10:01 p.m.: Apparently Ben Harper was late to the stage,
going to catch a few of him and then peace to beat traffic.
5/25 10:34 p.m.: Shimmer N Shine + Led Zep cover both sound
ed great, Relentless 7 is a great new sound for Harper.
5/25 10:54 p.m.: Walking past Chromeo — sounds amazing, but
alas, Intermission flies home in seven hours ...
5/25 11:31 p.m.: Campsite is packed! Heading home to Seattle.
5/26 2:28 a.m.: Bedtime! Up in 92 minutes to catch our flight.
5/26 4:04 a.m.: Wow, so that's what three days of nonstop fun
feels like.
5/26 4:07 a.m.: Your correspondents are way too tired to func
tion.
5/26 5:38 a.m.: Waiting to board ... we must look like the walk
ing dead.
5/26 8:14 a.m.: Wheels down! We made it... now, all we need to
do is make 11 a.m. class.
5/26 10:28 a.m.: Back at Stanford. Exhausted, sunburned, dehy
drated. We gave it our all for you, Stanford Daily! Intermission
over and out.
Since micro-blogging is all the rage these days, Intermission set out to tweet the entire
Sasquatch festival for this article. Unfortunately, as the Gorge is in the middle of
nowhere and has the capacity to support only eight to nine cell phones at a time, this
HAD TO BE DONE BY HAND AFTER ABOUT 3 P.M. ON SATURDAY. ENJOY!

5/21 9:30 p.m.: Intermission just landed in Seattle! Looking forward to an incredible
weekend!
5/23 8:14 a.m.: Heading to the Gorge ... word on the street is a 17-mile backup going
in? We'll see how this goes ...
5/23 9:42 a.m.: On the road towards #Sasquatch — anybody else?
