# ROXY GETS SOME LADY LOVE!
## 
### 
Roxy is now going to talk about one of the hottest,
most scandalous kinds of college relationships
anyone can have. You've heard of the term J

"dormcest," right? Well, Roxy has just taken that
term to a whole new level. Now regardless of the
scandalous connotations associated with dorm-

cest, one cannot deny the sheer convenience of
it. I mean, why bother going out on the week
ends to hunt for that special hookup when you
can just get it anytime you want from that
person down the hall from you? But of course,
Roxy likes things as easy as possible, and what
could get easier than doing the dirty with the
person in closest proximity every day ... that is,
your roommate.

You heard Roxy. Lots of Stanford students sleep ™
with their roommates, but very few actually sleep with
their roommates. Dormcest and friends with benefits cannot
even compare to what Roxy's got. But enough bragging, let's get
down to what you all really want — the graphic details!
How did this explicit roommate relationship come about, you
ask? Well, it all began a couple of months ago — at the beginning of
spring quarter to be exact. Roxy has always been down with all walks
of life, and does not discriminate by gender — the more the merri
er, I say. Anyway, Roxy's only known her roommate — let's call her
Renee — for only this quarter alone (she came back from abroad),
and always thought she was just your chill, fun Stanford gal. She
clearly never minded my healthy sexual appetite, so that definitely
made her a keeper in my book.
However, with the lifestyle that Roxy lives, I honestly never got
a chance to talk and hang out with Renee that much. She was always
busy with rugby or her sorority, and I hardly ever sleep in my own
bed each night — Roxy doesn't bring boys home to her bed, you see.
Coincidentally though, last weekend I found myself actually hang
ing around the dorm, putting in some extra hours on a major
research paper. Unfortunately, I actually had to work on this paper
because the professor and TAs for this class are not attractive —
Roxy usually gets away with sweet-talking her professors for a B+,
sometimes an A- if she actually puts in the effort.

Anyways, while working on this paper,
Renee came stumbling in from a frat party.

She was pretty drunk and immediately
jumped into her bed. We chatted for a bit,

Roxy making sure that she was alright,
and soon after Roxy was focused back on
her work. Things became a tad bit more
interesting when Renee started asking
about what Roxy thought of all the news

concerning Prop. 8. Roxy quickly voiced
her pro-marriage equality opinions and

once finished, Renee was oddly quiet. Was
she asleep? The next thing that came out of
her mouth was, "Roxy, do you wanna lie in

bed with me?" Roxy's curiosity was instantly
piqued from this statement, and the next thing she
knew, she was laying in bed, staring at Renee.

What happened next... Roxy is sure you all can
guess. She could tell Renee was a bit nervous, but after her

soft first soft touch, Roxy was able to put her at ease. Roxy
knew what was on Renee's mind, and decided to just break the ice
and go for it. We locked lips, and Roxy let Renne do most of the
work. For the sake of ensuring that this story doesn't turn out to be
an erotic novel, Roxy will skip straight to the ending and say that we
both got to have a happy ending that night.
Since that night, we've been the best of roommates. We still
don't see each other too often, but when we are around each other
in the room, there is an unspoken rule between us that we should
play "catch-up" with each other and get some good girl-bonding
time in. Apparently Renee is just now starting to explore her sexual
ity, and Roxy is more than happy to oblige and help a sister out.
Renee gets to earn some valuable sexperience, and Roxy gets the
sheer benefits of a roommate with benefits. This is a win-win situa
tion all around. All you folks with roommates out there should give
this a try — you don't know what you're missing out on.
