## "The Brothers Bloom:" Far from a con 
### 
Right from the beginning of "The
Brothers Bloom", Ryan Johnson estab
lishes his new film as a departure from
the darker style he employed in his debut,
"Brick". In contrast to the murky lighting and
tone of that modern take on noir, "The
Brothers Bloom" opens with a once-upon a
time story full of bright color and whimsy. The
opening sequence, which lasts about six min
utes, is an accomplishment in characterization.
It plays like a fairy-tale, half magical, half real,
yet it establishes the brothers as clearly defined
characters — a feat that many movies fail to
achieve in 90-plus minutes.
From this point on the movie unravels at a
pace that is neither rushed nor slow, which suits
the material at hand perfectly. The story
revolves around the lives of the brothers Bloom
who have been con artists since they were chil
dren. After years of play-acting and following
Stephen's (Mark Ruffalo) manipulative cons,
the younger of the two (Adrien Brody)
announces his plan to leave his criminal life
behind. However, the reluctant scammer finds
that his brother has masterminded one last
scheme to claim the wealth of an eccentric mil
lionaire (Rachel Weisz). As expected, the movie
has its fair share of twists and turns, attempting
to deceive the audience, and while not all of
them work, the film is tightly plotted, thus
keeping the story fresh and unpredictable. The
effortlessness of the script should be attributed
to Ryan Johnson, who keeps the story from
feeling like a rehash of other similar movies.
With this film he has established himself as one
of the most exciting filmmakers of the decade.
The movie works as a globe-trotting con
story, yet it is first and foremost a story about
the importance of family. The characters in the
movie (both the deceptive Bloom and his tar
get, the elusive millionaire) are trying to escape
a common enemy — loneliness. The film is
most enjoyable during the quiet scenes when
the four titular characters are interacting with
each other. The revelations keep the suspense
building up until the climax of the film, yet
there is heart in the journey. In tact, it is the
affection that exists between these characters
that keeps the movie from becoming another
installment of the "Ocean" series.
Mark Ruffalo does the best work of

his carcer. Personally, I
have always felt

that Ruffalo did a decent job in most of his
movies, yet he never managed to impress me.
Here his performance pops off the screen.
There's a spark behind his eyes that tells you the
reasoning behind his actions even though he
never articulates such reasons.
Other stand-outs in this movie are
Academy Award nominated actresses Rachel
Weisz and Rinko Kikuchi. Weisz has the tough
est role of the two because she has to portray
the wackiness of her socially-awkward million
aires without having her quirky nature become
an annoyance rather than an endearing quality.
She excels at conveying the earnestness of her
character and most importantly she seems to be
having fun, which is welcome after her heavy
dramatic roles in "The Constant Gardener" and
"The Fountain". Equally enlightening is Rinko
Kikuchi as Bang-Bang, the brother's partner in
crime. Kikuchi steals every single scene in
which she appears, and she appears in many of
them. What is most impressive is that she only
speaks three words throughout the whole film.
"The Brothers Bloom" is both familiar and
entirely new. It reminded me of another era of
cinema when cynicism, irony, and parody were
not so abundant on screen. For those of you
who enjoy a well-told story with credible char
acters and good acting, go see "The Brothers
Bloom." This film is no cheat — just a joyous
experience.
