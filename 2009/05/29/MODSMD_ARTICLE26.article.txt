# "Drag Me to Hell" ...then forget me
## 
### 
New horror movies usually welcome a cursory shake of the head and cluck of the
tongue from me, as I, in a somewhat cynical fashion, would not be surprised if
about 50 percent of reviews were negative. I am not quite sure why some people
are either blas£ or utterly vitriolic toward horror. Very few horror films win Oscars or even
make critics' top 10 lists, and the few that have been critically acclaimed films, such as
"Silence of the Lambs" (some controversy over whether this would classify as horror) or
"28 Days Later," arc oddly rare. There is something to say about the genre's rampant use
of some cliche movie techniques — the creaking door, the pianissimo music which erupts
suddenly whenever we are supposed to be afraid, the screaming heroine; perhaps audi
ences are jaded and tired of entering theaters already accurately guessing at least half of the
film.
But Sam Raimi, director of "Drag Me to Hell," does not very much care about this, it
seems. Raimi, the creative visionary behind the Evil Dead and Spiderman movie series,
spends the majority of his 100-minute screen time shoving major horror movie cliches
down his viewers' throats. The film opens with a shot of a foliage-covered California man
sion in mid-day 1969. An old truck pulls up to the front and we see a Hispanic family con
sisting of a man, his wife and their young son who is sweating profusely and wrapped in
a blanket. From inside the house comes another Hispanic woman, to whom the wife
explains in anxious Spanish her son's terrifying ability to hear demonic voices. The woman

from the house ushers them inside quickly, seemingly knowing the nature of

his problem. Once inside, the boy begins to hear voices — only this time

they arc accompanied by deep rumblings in the floors, shaking

walls and an invisible entity that violently attacks the

woman and his parents. The boy, in an attempt to

escape, is suddenly hoisted and thrown over the
upstairs balcony, where the ground begins to split
and reveal a fiery pit beneath him. Before he can
be saved, a devilish looking hand shovels him into
Hell — much to the horror of his parents and the
woman.
Eventually, we learn that what plagued the
boy was an evil spirit called the Lamia, who later
torments Christine brown, played by Alison
Lohman, a loan officer. After denying an old

Gypsy woman a third extension on loan payments, (and participating in a hilarious park
ing lot fight afterward), the woman curses Christine, thereby ensuring her demise into
1 Jell within three days.
For anyone who has seen Raimi's "Evil Dead" series or Peter Jackson's "Dead Alive,"
they will immediately recognize the film's tongue-in-cheek tone. Although not as extreme
as the content of the first two, "Drag Me to Hell" certainly trades on gross humor and
Christine's growing desperation to find a cure for her curse, particularly as she is willing
to sacrifice her animal-loving, vegetarian lifestyle for a more bloodthirsty tango with her
adorable pet kitten. It is quietly funny moments like this that make the film's cliche-rid
den nature passable and even entertaining. One gets the sense that Kaimi is very well aware
of the Rules of Horror and self-consciously invites the viewer to have a good laugh at their
übiquity. Rather than attempt to re-write them, why not just poke fun?
Admittedly, the movie caused my heart to skip a beat on several occasions, particular
ly at Raimi's tendency to always have a semblance of the demon's creepy countenance hid
ing right around a corner, but in retrospect, even tongue-in-cheek approaches to horror
can get old, and not surprisingly, by the time the viewer reaches the climax, they are once
again fairly well-equipped to just guess the ending based on the hordes of horror (and
horror-comedy!) movies they have seen previously. I give the film a six for keeping me
entertained for the first 75 percent of it, but I am sad to say that we can once again add
another horror film to the vault of the Repetitive and Easily-Forgotten.
