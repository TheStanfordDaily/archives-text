## AA SUMMER MUST-HAVES 
### 
Sheer T-shirts and
tanks

American Apparel does an interest line of
burn-out see-thru tanks. They're a must for
replicating the '90s grunge look. However, don't
count on wearing them with nothing under
neath, unless you're dying to show off your
undergarments. Either wear a thin bodysuit
underneath or a cotton tank.

Circle scarf

There are supposedly a million ways
you can wear this. It's essentially a giant
piece of circular fabric that you can get
quite creative with. You can wear it as

a scarf (obviously), as a shawl, a
head-cover, a top, a one-shoul
der dress, a tube top, a tube

dress ... the list goes on.
For Intermission, this

is perfect for a day
that's breezy, but
way too hot for a
sweater that you
have to carry

around, just in case it
gets colder. It's also the
perfect piece for airplane
rides.

Afrika-printed
DRESS

A more jazzed-up version of
the scoop-neck dress that comes
in black/white or black/red.
Intermission loves this dress; it's
eye-catching, but also very easy
and not fussy (except for the
short length; unless you don't
care about flashing the Stanford
population, wear some shorts
underneath).

Mesh dress

One of the most versatile pieces at AA; there are just about a
million ways you can wear this. Wear it with an LBL) (little black
dress) underneath, or an LWI) (little white dress) over. I've seen
this worn with something else as part of a very formal outfit, and
I've also seen it dressed down with flats for a chill night.

American Apparel is often hit-or-miss. Their basics are nice — the
TRI-BLENDS HAVE BECOME EXTREMELY COMMON. BUT THE NEON, GLITTERY LEG
GINGS AND BODYSUITS ARE LIKE POISON: PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS, AS WEARING
THEM WILL BE LIKE FASHION SUICIDE. INSTEAD, CONSIDER THESE AA MERCHAN

DISE FOR YOUR SUMMER STAPLES:

WOOL FLOPPY HAT

Scoop-neck dress

A very easy and useful basic; comes in
every color of the rainbow and the scoop
neck makes this dress quite breezy.

A perfect hat for a hot day, this hat is at
once classy and unassuming, but also different
enough to draw admiring looks. Just a warn
ing, though — don't wear this while riding
your bike; it often covers up your direct vision
so you'll always have to use one hand to keep
the hat out of your face ...
