# "UP" RISES ABOVE

### 
When it comes to
When films, it is
very hard to pick a

favorite. Each movie is such a master-

piece that Pixar has placed itself a in a league of
its own — every feature-length Pixar film has won the

Oscar for Best Animated Film. As expected, its newest cre-

ation "Up" does not disappoint.
This movie focuses on 78-year-old Carl Frederickson as
he searches for adventure following the death of his wife, Ellie.
Although Carl may seem like a typical grouchy old man on the
surface, in reality he is endearing. By depicting how Carl and
Ellie had a relationship since childhood, the movie's directors
make Carl's heartbreak and humanity apparent.
One day however, Carl gets a knock on his door from
Russell, a seven-year-old Wilderness Explorer (more or less a
Cub Scout). Russell begs Carl to let him be of assistance in any
way in order to obtain his final Wilderness Explorer badge, but
Carl quickly sends him away. When, due to unfortunate cir
cumstances, Carl is required to move in to a retirement home,
he decides to take matters into his own hands and move his
house, via hundreds of balloons, to Paradise Falls in South
America — a locale his wife always dreamed of moving to.
Carl releases the balloons, which lifts his entire house into the
air, and is on the way for his adventure. Unbeknownst to him,
Russell is stuck on his porch.
It is at this point when the movie takes off — both literal
ly and metaphorically. "Up" is truly different from other Pixar
films, taking on a sort of art-house style script that focuses on
ludicrous characters and magnificent views as opposed to a
conventional plotline. It is also a far cry from the last Pixar
gem,"Wall-E." While "Wall-E" had a strong, politically relevant

message calling for environmental reform by depicting a
damaged Earth overrun by litter, "Up" has a subtler message
that is conveyed much more optimistically Throughout the
movie, Carl is taught that sometimes the best adven-

tures are the ones you don't go looking for. As the lit
tle Russell says, "It's funny. .. sometimes the most
boring things are the ones I remember the most."
However, the charming characters and insightful
message aren't what make the movie, though they cer
tainly make the film memorable. The people over at
Pixar have outdone themselves with the animation on
this one. The panoramic views of South America are
absolutely breathtaking, and the shot of the balloons I
unfurling from the chimney of the house is especially "
epic. The 3D is done subtlety to enhance the visuals and

does not seem like a silly gimmick.
This movie is a major achievement for Pixar. It is some
thing completely different from both "Finding Nemo" and
"The Incredibles" — but in the best way possible. It's apparent

that Pixar no longer relies on
appealing to children because

"Up" is filled with complexities

and heartbreak, with a storyline
that reflects on the reality of

aging in a fantastical setting.
While the trailers and the title
may seem simple, "Up" is any
thing but. Count on this film
to not only add another Oscar
Award to Pixar's shelf, but
leave a lasting impression on
audiences for years to come as
well.
