# A 						Classy Recession Special at Marche
## 
### 
When it comes to fine dining near Stanford, Marche is
usually near the top of the list. Located on Santa
Cruz Avenue in Menlo Park, Marche is just minutes
from campus, but possesses a sophistication that one might
expect in downtown San Francisco in terms of the decor, serv
ice and menu. Tables are comfortably spaced in the moderate
ly sized dining room with the white table cloths surrounded by
a decor of conservative earth-tones. Many of the lighting fix
tures are noteworthy in themselves and arc effective in creating
the perfect balance of visibility and serenity.
The menu is extremely appealing. Like so many restau
rants in its price bracket, Marche is best described as serving
French and New American cuisine. While there is certainly no
shortage of creativity in the offerings, the dishes are slightly
weighted on the conservative side — that is to say, there is a
unique touch to most items on the menu, but not to the point
that the result sounds completely bizarre. Appetizers are most
ly in the teens and include sweetbreads with pancetta, a steak
tartar "mimosa" and gnocchi with egg and pancetta. Mains,
which run mainly in the high 20s to low 30s, include seafood
such as Alaska King Salmon with onion, sweet peas in a pep
per sauce, as well as poultry and meats including duck, pork,
lamb and beef.
Marches food has been excellent historically, but it should
be noted that there has been a change of chefs relatively recent
ly. Despite its brilliant appearance, the steak tartar was simply
disappointing. In addition to shaved parmesan cheese, the
plate was topped with crumbled hardboiled egg. The flavor of
the steak itself was subtle causing the first bite to be dominat
ed by the egg flavor. After passing the egg, the texture of the
tartar was perfect, but the taste seemed more like salt than any
thing else. Though at $11, it is hard to complain about the
price for what was still an enjoyable steak tartar. A surprising
ly good appetizer was a current special: a carrot salad served

with fava bean hummus. Even for someone who generally
despises them, the carrots were amazingly pleasant, and the
dressing was a refreshing surprise. And the unique richness of
the fava bean hummus made it tempting to simply cancel the
entree orders and order a pile of pita bread to dip in the hum
mus all night. The gnocchi appetizer is also a good choice.
Moving into the entries, there was a duck breast served
with porcini mushrooms, risotto cakes and peaches.
Unfortunately, the product on the plate failed to meet the
expectations from the menu's description. The duck itself
appeared to have been properly cooked to medium rare, but
tasted more like it was well done, leaving one to wonder about

the quality of the meat. Not to say it was spoiled, but it
appeared to be of a grade inconsistent with its price. The saf
fron risotto cakes, which were pleasantly crispy, were overly
dry inside and not terribly flavorful. The porcini mushrooms
were a solid addition, but insufficient to rescue the dish over
all. The crusted lamb saddle provided a similar overall experi
ence. It was accompanied by Bloomsdale spinach, which was
superb with the very delicate addition of oil and seasoning.
The meat itself, however, was once again short of exemplary
with not much of its own tasting and a bit too much salt.
The desserts — a clover honey panna cotta and a straw
berry rhubarb vacherin — were a nice change of pace. They
were not overly rich and demonstrated what desserts can and
should be, but rarely are. They provided enough sweetness to
satisfy the inevitable craving, but were sufficiently light so as to
provide a distinct and refreshing conclusion to the meal rather
than leaving the customer stuffed with no desire ever to eat
again. (The latter part of which is, of course, the result of every
item on the menu at the Axe and Palm.)
Despite its shortcomings, the overall Marche experience is
unquestionably pampering with polite and competent service
from start to finish. And the current economic climate means
there are deals to be had. Specifically, where three courses a la
carte could easily run to $60, Marche now offers a weekly spe
cial prix fixe for less than $50 (and sometimes in the low 40s).
There is no choice within the weekly selections, but that can
have its benefits — how else would you learn how amazing
fava bean hummus is? Regardless of whether the chef was suf
fering from a bad shipment of meat or is still working out the
kinks, Marche is likely to remain one of the better-respected
restaurants in Stanford's immediate vicinity.
