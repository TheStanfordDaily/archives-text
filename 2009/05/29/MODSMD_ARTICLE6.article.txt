# Something is airing on channel 58: "THE DORM"
## 
### 
For years, Stanford has struggled
to maintain a cable channel
equivalent to that of even the
smallest colleges. Finally, a group has
come along that has dedicated itself

to giving the student body what it
wants most: light entertainment that helps one get through hump day. This past
Wednesday, Stanford students crowded around televisions tuned into SCBN
(channel 58) in anticipation of the series premiere of "The Dorm." And then they
waited. As Stanford Idol dominated the screen, many students instead turned their
attention back to basketball and their problem sets. Finally at 10 p.m., the show
aired and the audiences everywhere from Old Union to dorm lounges were able to
watch this "The Office" spin-off.
If you look back on the pilots of your favorite shows, you will notice that it
does not quite fit in with the rest of your favorite series. I imagine that may be the
case here, as the crew continues to work out technical problems and the cast
adjusts to the television style acting. The style and writing subtleties mirror the
ever-popular NBC predecessor, as the plot follows the dysfunctional staff of Soto.
The characters have their distinct personas, including the alcoholic RA, the bossy
RA and the creepy RCC. While some roles are a bit static at this point in the series,
the ensemble meshes together to capture the entertaining highs and lows of staff
life.
The first episode, entitled "The Party," takes an inside look at the staff wel
coming a new HPAC. Much like the conference room scenes with Michael stand
ing over the group, the episode begins with a weekly staff meeting. While the view
ers begin to learn about the tense interactions among the staff members, charac
ters stand outside the room to give their confessionals to the camera. The struc
ture interests the avid Office fans, but also creates difficulty for the viewer not to
get caught up in comparing every moment to the Emmy award-winning show.
There is a character that stands out as a grand slam. Xavier, the creepy RA, is mon
otone and sadistic, but creates the most humorous moments of the episode. He
creates napalm and gives it to a fellow staff member under the guise of glue. While
the humor is a bit advanced (as he truly is a mad scientist as advertised), it is per
fect for a Stanford crowd. The smaller roles cannot be overlooked, as the three
dorm boys add commentary and humor to hallway situations. Another classic
moment comes late in the episode when two RAs get lost and desperate, only to
find out through camera movement that they sit a stone's throw away from
Hoover Tower and their resident parking lot.
Despite sound difficulties, the episode stands as a promising start for a brave

project. As the actors continue to grow into their roles, the show will con
tinue to serve as an entertaining force to look forward to this fall.

With only one more episode this year, the series will

become regular this fall in biweekly segments
on Wednesday at 8 p.m. If you have a group
meeting or are watching basketball, you can
catch it on You Tube and iTunes just like all of your
other favorite series.
