# Get closer with Robber Barons!

Comedy groups are a much-needed resource
on campus. Even though Stanford students
are automatically dubbed as being "intel
lectual," there are definitely moments during our
busy student lives in which we just want to divert
our attention from reading the latest research arti
cles to watch something mindless — something
straight-forward. This could not be all the more
salient right now in the quarter, with everyone get
ting ready for long study excursions in the library,
prepping for end-of-year finals. Thankfully, the
Robber Barons, Stanford's sketch comedy group,
gives us a breath of much-needed laughter by way
of their spring show by delivering a flurry of
humor that comes and goes as fast as their sketch
es.
Titled "Let's be Close Friends," this show
marks the group's fifth original, end-of-quarter
show, which is quite impressive given that the
comedy group was formed only last school year.

This year's show offered a girth of 18 original
sketches jam-packed in approximately one
i hour — there was even a 10-minute inter-

mission in between, making this time
crunch all the more impressive.
Of course, being able to perform 18

sketches in less than an hour unfortunately means
that the sketches themselves are quite short, with
most of them coming in at about 3 minutes or less.
This rapid-fire comedic presentation does not
come without its flaws; although pretty much
every sketch had its humorous moments, we the
audience barely get any time to fully take in and
appreciate each actor's performance. Not surpris
ingly, the show's more stand-out performances
were found in the group's longer sketches. My per
sonal favorites were the sketches "Romans" and
"Babysitting." The former consisted of the per
formers (Peter Chapman, Julia Nleltzer and
Stephen Babson) dressed in togas and speaking
entirely in Latin, which is no easy task. The sketch
"Babysitting" was an excellent example of the
impressionability of longer sketches — the audi
ence was better able to feel the awkwardness brew
and develop between the main performers (Jesse
Krompier and Olivia Harewood). The slow, nerv
ous laughers and pauses between the players
helped to develop much-needed tension, some
thing that just could not have been done had the
sketch been only two minutes long.
Thankfully, regardless of the sketches' brevity,
this show was not a situation of quantity over qual-
