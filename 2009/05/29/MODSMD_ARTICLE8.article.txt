# Cowboy vs. Samurai
## A 						HUMOROUS TAKE ON STEREOTYPES 
### 
During my fresh
men year I was hanging out in the Larkin com
puter cluster with a couple of male friends when the
conversation turned to girls and become extremely bitter. It
was at this point that I noticed the race of the participants of
this discussion. As the white female in a room of Asian-
American males, I got an earful about how Asian girls won't
date Asian guys and how white girls wouldn't date them either.
I told them that their assertions were absurd. Hut it has
become a phenomenon that is so common or so prevalent to
Asian men that it has become a cultural force. This weekend
you can watch one of the more sophisticated discussions on

this issue by going to see the performance put on by
the AATP, "Samurai vs. Cowboy."
This is the AATP's second play this year, and
any performance would have been difficult to fol
low in the footsteps of "Forgetting Tiburon." This
play touches on many of the same themes as the
aforementioned play — but does so with a
humorous bent. There are a lot of parts of this
play that were funny enough to make me laugh

out loud, the outrageous performance by
Albert Chu as Chester did his job as the comic
relief admirably. However, funny as this play is,
it is strongest in its moments of sensitivity and
complexity portrayed by the lead Rich Liu, who
plays Travis — and who, unfortunately for the
AATP and theater community, is graduating.
His character is written to be a likable nice guy

who helps his white friend, the
lovable hick played equally well
by Ben Kessler Reynolds as Del,
get the lone Asian girl who "has
preferences" and just moved
into the very white backwoods
of Breakneck, Wyoming This
role is played very well by
Amanda Le as Veronica.

However, Rich Liu manages to
play his character well enough and with an
incredible amount of charisma so that he
becomes a personality beyond a stereotype.
This is a trend throughout the play. I had
feared going into it that this would be a play
of one-dimensional stereotypes, and there
are certainly moments when the script could
have been read as such. However, this play
has been done well enough — a credit both
to the actors and the director — that it man-

ages to overcome this issue. I will say Amanda Le and Albert
Chu both had a more difficult task in order to transcend their
roles (and Amanda for the first half of the play was a bit less
likable then her male lead) but they both ultimately performed
well.
This is a small production and the stage design reflects
that. I'm not one for elaborate sets, but given the importance
of dialogue in this play, 1 think that the set-up was pretty per
fectly designed for the intention of the production. It is sparse
in a way that an audience would expect rural Wyoming class
rooms to be. The sound crew also did a really good job when
they were needed. "Samurai vs. Cowboy" is definitely a play
worth seeing and discussing on this beautiful weekend.
"Samurai vs. Cowboy" runs May 29 and 30 at 8:00 p.m. in the
Nitery Theatre.
