# A 						WEEKEND OF "GORGE" OUS MUSIC AND FUM SASQUATCH 2009
## 
### 
As the oft-overlooked midpoint between mega-fes
tivals Coachella and Bonnaroo, Sasquatch has
been quietly growing in past years into one of the
country's preeminent summer music destinations.
Begun the same year as Bonnaroo and two years follow
ing Coachella, Sasquatch has brought an eclectic lineup of
rock, punk, indie, dance and hip-hop to the Gorge
Amphitheatre in Quincy, WA every Memorial Day week
end for the past eight years. With an estimated daily
attendance of just over 50,000, the festival is a bit more
than half the size of Coachella, and this year boasted a
lineup many music journalists felt was equivalent to its
California counterpart. Sold-out crowds on Saturday and
Sunday (and a very near sellout crowd Monday) weren't
disappointed, and were being treated to spectacular per
formances by headliners Kings of Leon, Nine Inch Nails
and lane's Addiction — as well as a host of memorable
efforts by smaller market up-and-comers.
The Gorge and Sasquatch are both a music lover's
dream. The venue itself is arguably the most beautiful in
the country — a wide-open amphitheater set in front of
an awe-inspiring view of the Columbia River Gorge. The
setting enhanced nearly every band that played the main
stage, imbuing already memorable sets by the likes of TV
on the Radio, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Animal Collective with
even more drama and profundity. Like other music festi
vals, Sasquatch's main draw is indeed its huge (and huge

ly diverse) selection of performers, but this festival is on a
much more intimate and manageable scale. Compared to
the massive five-stage setups of Coachella and Bonnaroo,
Sasquatch has only three (the Sasquatch, Wookie and Yeti
stages, plus a comedy tent), and Intermission had no
problem finding its way into the first ten rows for any
band. Sasquatch is admittedly lacking in the diversions of
larger festivals (no interactive artwork or sculptures), but
for fans who come to festivals purely for the music, it's
hard to imagine a better place to spend the long weekend.
Intermission set up camp just outside the Gorge and
readied themselves for a weekend of truly intense press
coverage. While Sasquatch drew the ire of at least one
other university press (Seattle U), Intermission loved it,
and suspects that the good people over at Seattle's "The
Spectator," whose review included the fairly obvious
bemoaning of Sasquatch's $9 beer price, clearly did not
know how to properly pack a knapsack to clear concert
security (your correspondents, you'll be proud to know,
went eight for nine in said endeavor).
From donning a Styrofoam helmet to surviving the
Nine Inch Nails pit to passing out from heat exhaustion
during perhaps the weekend's most mellow main stage
act (Fleet Foxes), your correspondents sought to cover the
action in a way that reflected The Daily's illustrious repu
tation for ruthless attention to detail and absolutely tena
cious, in-your-face music coverage. Each day brought

something wildly different to the Gorge, from Friday's indie rock
dream sequence of Animal Collective — Decembrists — Yeah Yeah
Yeahs — Bon Iver, to Saturday's back-to-back-to-back main stage
sonic assault of TV on the Radio — Nine Inch Nails — Jane's
Addiction, to Monday's Wookie Stage pairing of Girl Talk and
Explosions in the Sky (or, as they called themselves, Serious Talk),
quite possibly the most unique and diverse combination of the week
end. Intermission also very nearly scored an interview with Grizzly
Bear, but as their publicist lailed to email your correspondents back
with an interview slot (and also as your correspondents lost cell serv
ice roughly six minutes into the concert), this never panned out. So,
even though their set was lush and expansive and their new album
Veckatimest might be the best thing you listen to in 2009, your corre
spondents can assure you that the bands publicists, Press Here
Publicity, are nothing but a bunch of invalids and incompetents who
clearly arc not suited to be handling such indie rock darlings — par
ticularly when a certain student newspaper would probably have
given one of its pinkie lingers to interview them. But that's neither
here nor there; the sun was out, the venue was beautiful, the music
was endless and even the camping wasn't completely depraved.
Intermission saw it all this weekend; 37 bands, three stages, two cou
ples doing the unspeakable in the midst of concertgoers and more
American Apparel indie rock posers sipping $9 Original Coors than
your correspondents care to see for the rest of their music journalist
lives. Without adieu, here's the best of what we saw this weekend:


Sometimes the fans at
SASQUATCH OUTSTRIP THE
ARTISTS IN TERMS OF
ENTERTAINMENT VALUE.
Case in point.
