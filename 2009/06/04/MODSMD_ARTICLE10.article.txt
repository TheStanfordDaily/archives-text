## After collecting and counting nominations from the Stanford public, Intermission interviewed and photographed these top bachelors at Stanford. Hottest Roommate: Matt Farrell 
### 
VITAL Ciass Year: Senior
q Major: Film & Media Studies
Minor: Creative Writing
Hometown: Sacramento, Calif.
Roommate to fellow hottie Zach Johnson, Matt is proba
bly the most chill and laid-back bachelor on our list. In
fact, when asked about how he approaches dating, he
simply said, "I kinda just go along with it." When social
izing, he noted, "When I go out and drink, women just
come to me." He was joking, and then followed it up with
a shrug, "I dunno, I don't think about it too much."
Interestingly, Matt has actually spent about half of his
time at Stanford in some kind of relationship and the
other half being single.
In fact, just to set the record straight, Matt actually
has a current girlfriend. When asked about why he still
opted to be featured on our bachelors list, he responded
that "he cares about her [the girlfriend] deeply, but could
n't pass up getting attention." He was also joking there ..
. we think.

"I KINDA JUST GO ALONG
WITH IT."
For fun, besides for being a constant jokester, Matt
enjoys hanging out with friends, watching movies and
reading the book "The Mystery Method." His more exot
ic interests include traveling to foreign countries and
gambling in Vegas.
When asked about the qualities he looks for in the
people he dates, Matt quickly noted that they should care
about having a good time, going out, making him laugh
and of course be "smoking hot."
Looking toward graduation and life beyond
Stanford, not surprisingly, Matt is pretty relaxed about
everything. He's going to be working on campus during
the summer and is also interested in applying for MFA
Programs in either creative writing or screenwriting. So if
you're around this summer, make sure to hang out with
Matt and Zach — they are bound to be chilling and hav
ing a good time somewhere on campus.
