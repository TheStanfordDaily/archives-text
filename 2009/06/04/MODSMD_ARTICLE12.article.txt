small things are so important."
But what else is there to Mr. Cooper besides an
engineer with an eye for the simple? Two of Andy's
biggest passions include music and television. He
laughed when asked what some of his favorite shows
are. "I really shouldn't list them all for you ... they're
just too many." Regardless, some of Andy's top TV
choices include "Desperate Housewives," "Weeds,"
"Gossip Girl" and "Family Guy," just to name a few.
Andy has a general love and passion for music as
evident from his participation in Fleet Street. In fact,
one of his self-proclaimed skills is being able to find
new music. Case in point, Andy was one of the few
who professed love for Lady GaGa before she became
popular.
Finally, when asked about how things were look
ing in his love life for the future, Andy smiled and
looked optimistic — and with good reason. He's still
planning on just going with the flow and seeing what
new random guys he will meet in the years to come.
Armed with a disarming sense of humor and a killer
face and butt (his self-defined best features!) Andy is
always ready to find that Mr. Right. You'd be lucky to
randomly bump into this bachelor!
