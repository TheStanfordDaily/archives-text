Senior Zach Johnson is half of the "hottest roommates" catego
ry, which means that his room, with fellow hottie Matt Farrell, is
one of the best places to be on campus. It also doesn't hurt that
they live in 680. Zach hails from New York City and is leaving
Stanford with a degree in Film & Media Studies. Currently, he is
living the good life as he coasts to graduation.
"1 don't have too much work these days," Zach said as he
reflected on his final days at Stanford. With all the extra free
time, Zach noted that he likes to remain really active and fre
quently plays golf, swims, walks the Dish and goes to the gym.
But aside from working to stay fit, Zach also enjoys the simple
leisure activities like going to movies and just spending time with
his friends while he still can.
Reflecting on his past four years at Stanford, Zach has always
been pretty laid back when it comes to finding people to date.
"Meeting people is all random and all luck," he noted. His "go
with the flow" personality has resulted in a lot of dates and dat
ing, scattered throughout his time at Stanford.
"I've been on a let of first and second dates," Zach chuckled.
When prodded about this, besides things just not working out
with girls because they simply did not "click," he noted a com
mon problem throughout his dating history. "I get friend
tracked a lot," he readily stated.
Being friend-tracked is definitely something a lot of people
have experienced, and Zach seemed to be able to shrug it off eas
ily. "I'm fine with just waiting to see what happens," he cooly
said.
In terms of characteristics, Zach readily identified his
height, sense of humor and ability to make witty comments as
some of his best traits. He likes these same qualities in potential
dating partners â€” especially height. Looking to the future, Zach
wants to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, but, tak
ing one step at time, he will be working at Stanford for the sum
mer. Ladies, this could be your last chance with him, so step it
up!
