"I LIKE TO CALL MYSELF A JACK OF
ALL TRADES..."
We were eager to meet Diogenes Brito the second we saw his
name in all the email nominations. With a name like Diogenes,
how can you go wrong? Dressed in a trendy hat and head
phones around his neck, this half-Columbian, half-Dominican
charmer embodied a swanky style in a class all his own.
Hailing from New York City, Diogenes, or "Dio," is a soph
omore majoring in product design. We could tell by how he
carried himself that he is straight up cool. He readily noted,
"being laid back, easily excitable and a hard worker," as some
of his personal best qualities.
A key personal trait he went on to note is that he almost
never complains. This impressive feature helps to explain his
relaxed approach to dating during his past two years at
Stanford. Freshman year, Dio wasn't particularly interested in
dating whatsoever, and sophomore year he was pretty "indif
ferent."
When it comes down to it, though, Dio simply stated, "If
only I had more free time ..." We definitely do not blame the
guy because when he's not busy being an engineer, most of his
free time is spent toward his passion — music.
Inspired by his roots, Dio is a drummer for a jazz combo
band. Additionally, he sings (in fluent Spanish) for a Latin
ensemble. To top it all off, he also dances in Stanford's Los
Salseros group. Unfortunately, we weren't able to see Dio in
action, but we arc sure that he's astounding.
Even though he is one busy guy, Dio still remains open to
the idea of dating and is particularly attracted to people who
are open-minded and passionate about the things they do. We
think Stanford would be hard-pressed to find a Latin-infused
bombshell as good-looking and interesting as Diogenes.
