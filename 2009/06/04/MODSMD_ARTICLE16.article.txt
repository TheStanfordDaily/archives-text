# Hottest Poet: Rob Ryan

Dark and brooding. You know the type. Intense and
quiet, with something always on his mind. I wouldn't
necessarily say that hot bachelor Rob Ryan fits exactly in
that category, but that was the initial impression we got
from him during our interview ... and we liked it.
A sophomore hailing from Baltimore, Maryland,
Rob Ryan is a Symbolic Systems major. But don't let his
choice of major fool you — he's not your average
"techie." Gifted with a silver tongue, Rob is articulate and
lyrical. Of course, this is probably to be expected, given
that he is currently a member of the Spoken Word
Collective on campus. In fact, how he joined the
Collective is a testament to his talent. He auditioned for
Spoken Word his freshman year as part of an experiment
for a sociology class he was taking. Although done purely
for the class, Rob was more than good enough to get into
the group, previous poetry experience be damned. Rob
recounted this anecdote in a matter-of-fact way, humbly
downplaying his talent.

intelligent and charismatic. With an appreciation for lan
guages," he noted as being some of the top qualities he
looks out for.
In terms of his track record here, Rob noted that he's
pretty much been single his first two years here at
Stanford. He noted a little dating here and there, but
nothing serious. Rob admitted to having done the whole
"random hookup thing" — but is definitely over it at this
point. See his quote for his viewpoint on the practice.
Because of this, Rob was adamant that he is ready for
a relationship, and actively wants to meet the "right guy."
Of course he knows that at Stanford, dating someone is
often compared to taking a five unit class since it occupies
a lot of time and attention. Recognizing this, Rob is still
ready to take that next step.
Looking to the future, Rob noted his continued
interest in doing Spoken Word and even expressed inter
est in writing for The Stanford Daily — a man after our
own hearts! He certainly thoroughly charmed us in the
interview.
