# "I AM WHO 1 AM AND I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE FOR ANY ONE PERSON."

Dance Marathon and MELA — he joked about being the token
"white guy" in the group.
Regardless of his flurry of work and activities, Luke still finds
time for the important things in his life. "I didn't want to disappear,"
he reflected. "I also value my friendships a lot." For Luke, making sure
that he finds the time to be with friends takes high priority, especial
ly in his last weeks at Stanford. At the same time, he's also always
open to just meet new people — whether or not that leads to dating
is a different story.
When asked about what he looks for in a partner, Luke readily
answered, "They have to be high energy and be able to keep up. They
have to be able to hold their own." Luke emphasized he's very active
and loves the outdoors.
"I'm a live-in-the-moment kind of person," he said. Luke knows
this might not be for everyone, but remains steadfast to his beliefs. "I
am who 1 am, and I'm not gonna change for any one person."
Thankfully, he also mentioned that he's pretty "adaptable" and can be
serious, funny and sarcastic according to the situation.
Even though the clock is ticking to graduation, Luke is, of
course, still open to meeting new people, which means you still have
a chance to meet this hottie!??
