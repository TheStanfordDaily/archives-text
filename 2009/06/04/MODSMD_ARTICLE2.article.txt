## Sometimes you feel like a Nut

Throughout the quarter, Intermission has been intro
ducing you to the hidden food gems of Palo Alto which
students often overlook when thinking of restaurants in
the area. While University Avenue has some great places that
students frequent (think Sushi Tomo, CPK or Pizza Mv Heart),
the overall experience of the thoroughfare is split between rug
and carpet stores and more upscale eateries that cater to a
more mature crowd. Wouldn't it be great if there were a place
that served both of these audiences? Coconuts, a Caribbean
restaurant and bar, is such a place and is a truly great find, it's
also conveniently located off of University Avenue on Ramona
Street.
When you walk into Coconuts, you're struck by the
vibrant, pastel colors and Caribbean inspired artwork hanging
on the walls, which give the restaurant a cool, island vibe. In
fact, 1 spent the whole dinner sitting in front of "Booty, Booty,"
a vibrant painting featuring various depictions of the titular
objects.
Things at this Caribbean cafe are generally pretty chill.
Coconut's Chef Robert Simpson is a fairly well-known chef in
the area, and his fare is served at fairly reasonable prices, with

lunches hovering around $10 per person and dinners at $15.
This said, their servers are generally friendly and accommodat
ing, but the service isn't anything to write home about, as
tables mav have to flag waiters down to take orders or refill
drinks. While somewhat absentminded, the waitstaff certainlv
leaves the "ierk" to the food.
The menu starts out with some 'Small Tings," such as the
luscious Curried Crab Cake which tastes great with or without
the sweet papaya sauce. At a place called Coconuts, the
< "oconut Breaded Shrimp is a must trv, with large shrimp bat
lered and fried served with a tamarind ginger sauce. The melt-

n-vour-mouth codfish fritters are not only delicious, but they
send you on a cultural trip. Thev reminded me of

some ot the fried food in my home in the South while
my dining partner coniured up images of Chinese

Dim Sum fish cakes. Wherever this dish takes you,
it's definitely worth a try. Also, don't be alarmed at
the Beef Patties on the menu — they are not pat
ties but instead pockets of curried chicken and
beef. Lighter ones are chicken and darker ones
beet. They're good, but pale in comparison with
the richness of the abovementioned dishes. The jerk

wings were a little dry, but could satisfy your spice
craving if you just want a little taste of Caribbean fire.

Fhe Chef 's Sampler Platter, at $ lb, is a pretty good value
what you get, and can definitely suit a party of two or three for

a solid starter course.
As for the "Big Tings," or main entrees, Coconuts has a
wide variety of options, ranging from Oxtail to pasta to burg
ers to goat. Neither my dining partner nor I was terribly
impressed by the taste of the entrees, especially when com
pared to the delicious appetizers. The Adobo Steak, a Puerto
Rico-inspired rub and spice combo, was cooked well, but
lacked the rich taste that I was looking for after the Crab Cake
& Coconut Shrimp. The lerk Salmon was good and especially
good with the Papaya Sauce, which balanced some of the spice
of the [erk seasoning. However, this dish didn't live up to the

hype on the menu, which screamed "Jerk salmon, A
COCONUTS must! ! his Rocks!" Don t believe the advertising;
it's good, but not phenomenal. Also tasty was the rice risotto
like side-dish that came with the lerk Salmon. The restaurant
adds sweet potato to the mix that gives this side a distinctive
flair.
Overall, Coconuts is a great find — a restaurant that
waters to both the Silicon Vallev crowd and the student popu
lation with ease. Their hours can be a little hard to navigate,
but Coconuts is open for lunch Tuesdav to Fridav and open on
Friday and Saturday until 10:30 p.m. VVhile closed

ill of Mondav, the restaurant is open
from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Sundav.
