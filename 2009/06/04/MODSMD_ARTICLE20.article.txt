Wc were actually surprised that more athletes did not
get nominated for our bachelors list. Thankfully, soph
omore Jonathan McMasters takes the cake for hottest
athlete and would have won even with more jocks in
the competition pool.
Jon runs the 100 and 200 meters on the track team.
When asked about what he likes about himself, he
humbly noted his height, sense of humor, his smile
(which is adorable) and his body. We only wish we
could have seen more of the latter.
With regard to the ladies, Jon has only had one
official girlfriend during his two years here, though he
is completely single at the moment. With his second
year at Stanford down, Jon isn't particularly looking for
a relationship right now and is perfectly content with
the way things are. When it comes to the traits he likes
in a girl, he has it down to a set of basics: brains, beau-

RELATIONSHIP, I WANT TO BE 99
PERCENT SURE THAT THIS IS
WHAT I WANT."

ty and God (Christianity). Being able to have goo<
conversations is also important.
Of course when that special someone does com
along, Jon isn't going to just pass things up: "If some
one good comes along, 1 won't mess it up." But thi
doesn't mean that Jon will just jump into any relation
ship. "When I get into a relationship, I want to be 9
percent sure that this is what I want," he said. This per
sonal philosophy is just about as wise as Jon is hot.
On the topic of how hot he is, besides for being ai
athlete, Jon likes to stay well-rounded and is actuall
rather musically inclined — he sings for the Stanfon
Gospel Choir. He also plays the viola and is known t<
bust it out on occasion. During his free time, Jon als<
likes to juggle, dance and play Super Smash Brothers
Make sure to check him out tearing up the track o
dance floor.
