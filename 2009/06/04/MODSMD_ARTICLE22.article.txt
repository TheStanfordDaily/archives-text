# Harmonics CRANK UP THE AMP
## 
### 
Stop by a Harmonics concert, and you're guaranteed a
thrilling exploration of vocal rock. This past Saturday
evening, the Stanford Harmonics took over Manzanita
Dining for not one, but two smashing performances of their
show "Amped." High power and creativity were on full dis
play as the Harmonics rocked their way through a wide
variety of songs, covering artists ranging from Pink Floyd to
John Lennon to Lil' Wayne.
The concert kicked off with a fresh take on some classic
rock with Van Halen's "Right Now." Then Kali Lindsay T2
led the group with "Whisper" by Evanescence. The first act
was filled with hits from their latest (and award-winning)
album, "Escape Velocity" Tomoyasu Hotel's "Battle Without
Honor and Humanity" is a song that wonderfully showcas
es the Harmonics' knack for replicating the sound of rock
instruments, whether the wailing electric guitar or the
heavy, pounding bass. Other popular songs included
Aerosnnth/Eminem's "Sing for the Moment," complete with
autotune and a rap break, and a version of The Scissor
Sisters cover of "Comfortably Numb." Although the first few
pieces of the set were lacking in vocal balance and precision,
the Harmonics were captivating in both their stage presence
and infectious dynamism. Also contributing to the charged
atmosphere were more than a dozen Harmonics alumni,
loudly cheering and partying it up in the front rows.
After the intermission, The Harmonics debuted several
interesting new pieces, expanding their repertoire to include
a Korean song, Juarim's "Youth Admiration" and even a
piece from German rock band Rammstein. The songs were
well chosen, seamlessly fusing with the Harmonics' style.
The second act also featured a beat boxing jam between
Jenn Kim T2 and musical director Charlie Forkish '09,
which drew roars of excitement.
This year, Harmonics received funding for a sound
board, which, in addition to the individual microphones,
has allowed them to experiment with reverb and other elec
tronic effects. It was refreshing to see Harmonics reworking
several of their established hits, with a duet transition into

"Whisper" and a new, more dynamic intro for their finale
song, "Sound of Silence." The Harmonics' evolution
demonstrates a non-stop dedication to musical inventive
ness and innovation.
After all, there's a reason why the Stanford Harmonics
scored big at the 2009 CARA's (Contemporary A Cappella
Recording Awards) this past April. They won for Best Mixed
Collegiate Album and the Best Mixed Collegiate Song, two
of the highest music awards a co-ed, collegiate a cappella
group can get. Furthermore. Charlie Forkish's arrangements
for "The Sound Of Silence and "Imagine ' received winner
and runner-up, respectively, in the Best Mixed Collegiate
Arrangement category.
Of course, the incredible music was only part of the
"Amped" experience. Performance and ambience proved
equally as important. Harmonics members delivered on the
former, and lighting and sound technicians worked hard
behind the scenes on the latter.
The entire production was set up to resemble a rock
concert, with lasers and colorful decor. The show included
even more impressive technical elements than their previ
ous concert, ShamROCK, including dramatic spotlights and
audience lights bright enough to sear your retinas. It is
tough to match the intensity of such spectacle, and indeed,
in the small venue there were moments when the special
effects overshadowed the performances. However, most of
the time, the Flarmonics more than held their own with
their sheer vocal power.
Overall, the title "Amped" was a particularly fitting title
for the concert: louder, more in-your-face and bigger than
ever. With a distinctive rock sound and the willingness to
explore new musical territory, there is no doubt the
Stanford Harmonics are aiming to amp up their presence in
the a cappella world.
