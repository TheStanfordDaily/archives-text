# Stanford Theatre: movie-going in another decade
## 
### 
Stanford Theatre offers something modest, but increasing
ly something to treasure: it's a place where you can go and
see a film.
Bit by digital bit, the experience of movie going, crowding
together to see a film-reel projected on a monumental screen,
is fading into the past.
Whether it's video on-demand, digital distribution or
DVD, watching movies at home has become a larger and larg
er part of how we experience films. Even when people head to
a theater, increasingly they're not watching something shot (or
even presented) on film: digital cameras are crowding in on
both the low-cost and high-budget ends of the movie-making
spectrum and theaters themselves are increasingly moving to
digital projections. It's a different and more fundamental
change than the mere proliferation of CGI and digital effects,
but a subtler one as well; and it's hard to tell what we might be
losing in the process.
Whatever the case, it seems increasingly clear that films
from the era of old-fashioned movie-making aren't merely old
anymore; they're moving closer and closer to a different kind of
entertainment.
Stanford Theatre understands this trend and rather than
attempting to move with the times, the Palo Alto mainstay has
doubled down on offering a ticket back to a different age for
entertainment. Stanford Theatre doesn't show any new films,
and its "contemporary" offerings peter out around the 19605.
Some older theaters, even those catering to cinephiles, don't
stick to this kind of model; not all stewards of classic establish
ments can say no to the fun of staging "Alien" or "Rushmore"
on a big screen tor those who missed it the first time around.
But I think for Stanford Theatre it works; there'd be something
vulgar, independent of quality, in screening a new film in a
place striving to be a film temple.
Take, for example, "Without Reservations," the Theatre's
Sunday night offering, which arrived as part of the lohn Wayne
series. A lohn Wayne romantic comedy from 1948, it sees
female novelist Christopher Madden (Claudette Colbert) tak
ing a train across country, heading to Hollywood tor the adap
tation ot her best-seller. "Here is Tomorrow. She finds herself
looking for .1 new male lead after Carv Grant (Carv Grant)
drops out, but shes in luck when a pilot with the look of a
movie star named Rusty I nomas is on the same train as her.
Wayne plays Thomas, and that s about all you need to know
about the picture. Its simple entertainment, a lightweight
romantic arc with some interesting supporting turns and a
pleasing look at the Hollvwood milieu ol the '40s. Part ot the
fun is, admittedly, the dated aspects: Wayne's over-the-top con
servatism, the uncanny aw-shucks earnestness of his fellow
pilot Dink Watson (Don DeFore) or the conventions ot an
America waking up from World War 11. But it works on its own
merits, too; there's a reason people used to flood movie theaters
to see the big stars.

All assessment of the film itself aside, though, Stanford Theatre
has succeeded in selling an experience entirely independent of the
particular movie it's playing. The cheap, actually tasty concessions,
the enormous screen and wide-open theater, the opulent decora
tions and the glimmering marquee on University Avenue aren't ask
ing you to see this week's picture — they're inviting you back to
another time.
Whether there's much merit in that anymore, and what the
point of it all is when you can download the film in less time than

it takes to get the theater, is an open question. But for movie fans
who want to get a carefree, enjoyable look at what it was like to see
films, a trip to Stanford Theatre is the perfect choice. Enjoy it while
it lasts.
