# Roxy is calling YOU out!
## 
### 
reetings, Roxy fans! In case you didn't
I —realize it, this is actually my final

V_J story for the school year. So
before you all leave for the summer to

pursue new and exciting and sexual
experiences, there are few things
that Roxy needs to get off of her
well-endowed chest.
Since the class of 2009 is
now graduating, I feel that I
would be remiss if I did not call |
out all you seniors who have
done me wrong over the years —
or to put it differently, didn't do me

good enough ...
Brad, you're up first. Ever since we

hooked up at Full Moon on the Quad two
years ago, 1 was head over heels infatuated by

you. You were the dark and brooding type — kind,
sensitive and so much more. Roxy doesn't really get emotional,
especially over boys, but you got to me! You crushed me when you
said that you only saw me as a friend. I wish I got over you sooner.
Of course, I found out later that you're crazy, so I don't regret how
things turned out too much anymore.
Winston, you're next! You randomly came into my life spring
quarter, when I was just starting to get over Brad. We took things
nice and slow at first — just how I wanted it. Then out of nowhere
you threw the "not looking for a relationship" card in my face. I
would've been fine with that, but then we hooked up later in the
quarter and you got super awkward with me! I still would have been

fine just being friends with benefits, but you just had to go ignore
me. Still waiting for us to hook up again ...

Eric, don't think I haven't forgotten about you. Out of the
aforementioned guys, you were the biggest douche of
them all! All we were doing was hanging out and getting
to know each other better. We didn't even approach dat
ing status, yet you know that I was interested in you.
Then you go and hook up with another person on a
night where we were supposed to be hanging out. I
guess I would've been fine with it, but you didn't have
to strut your half-naked conquest in front me later that
night. You could have at least invited me in for a three
way. Your apology text the next day was lame.
I'm saving the best for last here. Jean, we had a great thing

going freshman year. It's both of our faults that we never said
how we felt about each other, but it's never too late. The relation
ship that you're in right now is horrible, bad for you, and it won't
work. You don't deserve to take her crap. Call me when you finally

want to give us a chance. It'll be great, and you know it.
If Roxy had to give shout outs to all the boys who did her wrong
over the years, this article would be a book. The guys she just men
tioned got special attention because they were actually able to break
through some of Roxy's impenetrable barriers to induce emotion.
Oh well, doesn't really matter anymore though, since you are all
graduating. Next year will bring a lot more fresh meat for Roxy to
enjoy — and hopefully there will be some actual men.
xoxo,
Roxy Sass
