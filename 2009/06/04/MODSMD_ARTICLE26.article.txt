# Shia LaBeouf talks "Transformers 2"
## 
### 
After watching Shia Laßeouf as a nerdy, mischievous
pre-teen on "Even Stevens," our generation has seen the
actor go from Disney Channel star to an A-list actor
making blockbuster films. In the past few years, Shia has
starred in movies like "Disturbia," "Indiana Jones and the
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" and, most notably,
"Transformers." With "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"
coming out next month, Intermission was lucky enough to sit
in on a conversation with Shia.
Cerritos College: Hi. I wanted to know since the first movie
got so many great reviews: how is the second movie going to
top it off?
Shia Laßeouf (SLB): It's fucking bigger, stronger, faster, better
— it has to be. You got to realize you know this movie is being
made by a lot of dudes who have a lot of pride. There's no way
that we're going to promise you something and then have it be
a piece of shit. It would just be a real problem for everybody's
psyche.
I think that definitely, like, the easiest way that I could
point at and say that it's going to be a better film is it's definite
ly the most explosive thing that you can possibly buy tickets to
this year. We broke like four or five Guinness World Records
making it.
This guy named John Frazier is like the oldest practical
effects guy in the business. He was the dude that used to hang
out underneath the wheel of fortune and bankrupt people
with a stick. He's been in it that long. And so he rigged an
explosion for seven months.
Which is basically a 1,000-gallon gasoline bomb. And for
seven months, which is longer than what we were filming for
— they were rigging the bomb for longer than we took to
make the entire film. And that bomb wound up being the
biggest bomb ever filmed with actors in it in the history of cin
ema. So ... that's one way. The stunts and everything are just
on a whole other level. But there's humor — there's a lot more
humor and there's great additions in terms of character and
cast and you see more robots. So it's a win for everyone, I
think.
Cal Poly: Hi. So, having worked on the first film, did you find
it was easier or harder to prepare for the second film?
SLB: Again, it's not Elephant Man. We're not making Citizen
Kane. It's not like some crazy Stanislavsky emotional prepara
tion stuff, you know? It's none of that. A lot of it is physical
exertion. So having to physically exert yourself when you have
a broken hand is rough. So that made it difficult.
We also got — you know, there were a lot of people that
got injured beyond just that injury. I got injured multiple
times beyond that injury. That wasn't even the scariest injury I
dealt with. I mean — but it's just a very physical, physical
movie, and Mike [Director Michael Bay] makes you do as

much as possible because he has seven or eight cameras going
at once, so it's not like you can just pull the actor out of this
shot and replace him with a stunt man because you've got
seven other cameras that arc at top angles that need to see that
actor in that position because you can only blow the building
one time.
And situations like that arise everyday and you wind up
putting your actor in the middle of it. So it's fun for me
because I feel like a badass. But you feel you're in a very safe sit
uation. They're not going to risk your life qn a stunt ever,
because there's so much money riding on the fact that you
need to be able to stay alive to be able to make the rest of the
movie.
I actually am safer on set than I am in life. So that was the
only thing. lust dealing with the physical aspect.

Stanford: Well, a lot of your ... recent blockbusters have been
action-related. Are you like looking into the future, like [do]
you have anything else lined up that's not action?
SLB: Yeah. Yeah, I don't plan on doing action for a while, actu
ally. I'm — yeah, I plan on making different movies. I can't talk
about the movie I'm going to be making next just because my
deal doesn't close until Wednesday. But it is very different than
anything I've done before, with a director that's dangerous and
a subject matter that has nothing to do with explosions. So I'm
pretty excited.
