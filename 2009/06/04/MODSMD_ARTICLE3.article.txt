# "The Demon's Lexicon" added to dictionary OF MAGIC FANTASY
## 
### 
Magic isn't evil — it's just misunderstood. Take
"Harry Potter," for example, or any of the other fan
tasy phenomena that have emerged these few years.
While the villains may be terrifyingly magical, the hero is
always some sort of sorcerer and saves the day with his special
powers. Sound familiar? Getting stale? This month, Sarah Kees
Brennan s iust-released debut novel, "The Demon's Lexicon,"
bucks the trend.
I'he guiding premise behind magic in "The Demon's
Lexicon is "power corrupts." Magicians are feared — hated,
ind even with good reason. They are born with magic, want
more and will sell innocent souls to demons to get it. Their
ictinis are possessed and eventually killed bv these demons,
who do all sorts of unsavorv and unnatural things with their
new human bodies, from crving live beetles to murdering peo
ple. Demons, and the magicians who bargain with them, are
cruel, dangerous and generally not people vou d want to cross.
Sinter Nick Rvves, whose little family has been hunted his
whole life by a Circle of magicians who are after his crazy
mother. He never stays in the same town for more than a few
months, wears a demon-repelling talisman and keeps his
swords — because guns don't always work — under the sink.
He is not your stereotypical altruistic hero at all; he isn't even
a particularly pleasant person. He has severe anger manage
ment issues, shamelessly uses his good looks to get his way and
doesn't mind — even sometimes enjoys — hurting or killing
people in the way of his goals. And vet, for all his flaws, this

protagonist is strangely
compelling precisely
because he unapologeti
cally acknowledges his
deficiencies and finds
the softer side of human
emotion far more fright
ening than anv magi
cian. He cares for only
one person in the world:
his brother Alan. As Alan
drags Nick into a des
perate gamble to save
the brother ot his latest
crush from demon pos
session, even as the
magicians catch up with
them, evervthing Nick
knows — or thinks he

knows — about himself,
his family and his past comes crashing down about him. The
story unwinds beautifully, as old and devastating secrets come
to light amid a hurtling train car of an adventure. A gripping
talc of horror and heartbreak.
"The Demon's Lexicon' arrives in stores on June 2.
