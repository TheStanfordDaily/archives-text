Intermission (i): What is your major?
Ellie Wen (EW): I am a drama major with a soci
ology minor.
(i): What are your plans after you graduate?
EW: Well, right after graduation I'm going home
to L.A. I'm going to be interning at a film produc
tion company called Cherry Sky Films, as well as
interning at the casting agency Betty Mae Casting.
(i): What would you consider to be your ultimate
goal in ycfur career?
EW: My dream is to be an actress/producer. When
1 get down to L.A., I'm going to start by audition
ing for everything. My hope is that I will establish
myself as an actress and then become a creative
producer. Interning at different places, 1 have
loved working with producers to develop their
scripts. I'd love to be involved in theatre, film and
television, but if I had to pick ... film.
(i): How did you know you want to work in the
entertainment industry?

EW: I've always loved performing. 1 have been
acting, dancing and singing since the age of seven.
I went to Harvard-Westlake in L.A., which has a
really good drama department. I grew up in the
entertainment capital of the world and I knew it
was my passion. When I got to Stanford, I tried
out a lot of departments, and I didn't choose my
major until junior year. I guess drama makes me
the happiest!
(i): How do you feel Stanford deals with the stu
dents in entertainment and the art community?
EW: It's getting to a place where the entertain
ment community is better at communicating
across campus, getting connections with alumni,
etc. However, the academics are really lacking —
there is no real practical training and going to
L.A., I feel really lost. They don't expect most of us
to go into acting as a professional career. It's all
classical training. There is nobody here to teach us
how to get an agent, or any acting on film class.
However, I'm very impressed with the work of the
students and I feel like there are always things
going on here.
