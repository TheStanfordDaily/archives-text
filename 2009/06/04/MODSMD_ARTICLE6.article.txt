intermission (i): What is your major?
Kyle Evaldez (KE): I am a film and psychology
major.
(i): What are your plans after you graduate?
KE: Right after graduation, 1 am moving down to
L.A. where I am interested in pursuing a career in
film production. I have an apartment and I'm work
ing out an internship with Marvel Studios, and see
ing where that takes me in the long term.
(i): What would you consider to be your ultimate
goal in your career?
KE: My dream job would be a film producer, where
I could visit sets a lot and see films get shot. I have
always been fascinated with that process, and it
would be very interactive. I definitely want to be
involved with all aspects of the film making process.
(i): How did you know you want to work in the
entertainment industry?
k

KE: I initially started off as a psych major, and soph
omore year 1 added on the film major, just as a fun
major. Toward the end of the year, 1 felt like my true
passion was definitely in film, and my junior year 1
became much more involved with the film commu
nity through Flicks, Stanford Students in
Entertainment, and the big revelation for me was
junior year when 1 went on the Stanford in
Hollywood trip. 1 realized that this was a tangible
dream.
(i): How do you feel Stanford deals with the stu
dents in entertainment and the art community?
KE: 1 think Stanford does what it can as far as the
entertainment industry is concerned. We do a good
job of encouraging the arts and different student
groups. The student groups here are beyond sup
portive and do a good job of fostering that sort of
community.
