# RESTAURANT REViEW
## Calafia Cafe ON CALIBER WITH NEIGHBOR MAYFIELD 
### 
This weekend my girlfriend and I went to brunch at Calafia Cafe, a
new restaurant in Town and Country next to the also-new Mayfield
Cafe. While Mayfield does a fantastic business, Calafia always seems
slower and less crowded, but I thought I'd see if it was any good.
Upon entering, we found the decor modern, but simple and very
comfy. We were greeted by a lovely woman who sat us immediately. When
the waiter came around to ask for drinks, 1 ordered a Coke.
"We don't have Coke," he said. They have their own homemade cola there;
1 thought the better of it and ordered water.
The menu had a wide, interesting range of options. Brunch offers lamb
sausage and eggs, a tofu scramble, dragon's breath noodles and "a simple
pizza." The prices arc reasonable, with all the items in the $8 to $12 range.
The lunch and dinner menus look equally good, with a diversity of clas
sic American dishes, a few Mexican options and several Asian noodles and
rice bowls. Also, with both meals, they offer a "You-l)on't-Have-to-be-a-
Kid" menu, in case you're craving just a little something.
I opted for smoked salmon on a crispy potato cake with two poached
eggs and a red pepper hollandaise. Not bad for the first meal of the day,
right? My girlfriend ordered the Chinese chicken salad. Both of our dishes
arrived at our table within minutes, though I'm not sure how normal that
is, as even the waiter looked surprised.
The food was fantastic — mine all worked together in a great way and
was beautifully presented, and the Chinese chicken salad was very light with
a great dressing. I will say, though, that the dishes were a bit small. A reason
able selection of sides, including two eggs and "Tobais' Kick Ass Coffee
Cake," are only $2.50, so consider supplementing your meal.
After we finished eating, the waiter filled up our water one last time
before handling the check quickly and efficiently. In addition to being a
restaurant, though, Calafia is also a deli and market. They've got a few great
little things there, including several pre-packaged, ready to cook meals.
There, the prices were on the high side — a fruit salad was priced at $5 and
a pre-packaged short ribs dinner for three at $34. I'd pay that to have it pre
pared for me and served in a restaurant, but not to take it home and put it
together myself. Still, if you're willing pay, everything looks good, and they
have some oils and other basic kitchen items.
We wandered through the deli and though I didn't order anything, it
looked as clean, fully stocked and professional as the rest of the restaurant.
Their Web site has a few fun features to it, including some great recipes for
"Black & Blue Yogurt Fru Fru" and a summer gazpacho borscht salad.
1 never did figure out why Calafia is never quite as full as Mayfield Cafe.
The prices are better, the food's just as good and the d£cor is a little more
interesting. Next time you're in Town and Country, give Calafia Cafe a try;
it's got something for everyone.
