# Students talk about food AND SERVICE AT TAP
## 
### 
Theo Polan, one of Intermission's most avid
food and restaurant reviewers, recently wrote
an incendiary and fiery letter criticizing The
Axe & Palm's quality of food offerings and staff serv
ices. Intermission, determined to gouge student reac
tions, went to The Axe & Palm to see what students
think of the letter and to get their own opinions of the
dining institution.
Serena Yeoung *10 said the wait staff at Axe &
Palm is courteous and usually says hello when people
enter. She thinks that "Theo's attack on the staff is
uncalled for" and recalls an instance last quarter when
the staff at Axe & Palm went out of their way to help
a group she was in get aprons for their costume from
a different building — a nice, kind act.

Xiaowei Zhang, graduate student in MS&E, said
he sticks to one option he likes at The Axe & Palm and
doesn't venture beyond that. "1 think the food is good,
but I only cat here once a week, and most of the time
I only order the chicken strips, which arc actually bet
ter than the ones they used to serve in Tresidder. The
last three times, including today, only once were the
fries fresh; all other times the fries were cold. But the
chicken strips are OK."
Laura Frankenfcld '12, who often eats her din
ners at The Axe & Palm due to the fact that she's on
the 10-meal plan and takes classes that interfere with
dining hall hours, thinks that Axe & Palm's sandwich
es are "really good" and doesn't find "issues with the
quality of those."
"I agree with the comments made about the cof
fee, though," Laura said. "Service overall is not as bad
as [Theo's letter) made it out to be, but could use
improvement. Most of my friends and I think the let
ter was a little too harsh."
Alex Willen '09, another one of Intermission's
main food critics, said that "the employees at The Axe
& Palm are nice. Unfortunately, that's more or less
where the positives end. The food comes out slowly, if
at all, and even when it's not wrong, it's not good.
Something needs to change."
Bharath Sitaraman 4 10 thought "the food is
decent for a campus eatery, but the service is subpar.

I have waited for 25 minutes for a simple order of
fries." The most frustrating bit is that "sometimes, the
food is ready and sitting on the kitchen window, wait
ing to be served, yet the staff fails to pay attention and
serve the food."
Amy Xue 1 10 thinks the food is "fine" and is a big
fan of the vanilla chai lattes. However, she, too, had
complaints about the service, which she described as
"frustratingly slow and not always friendly."
Tommy Tobin '10, another of Intermission's
major food critics, also threw in his two cents on The
Axe & Palm:
"While I agree with a few of Theo's assessments,
particularly regarding the wait times for orders, run
ning out of items and the fact that orders (including

my own on several occasions) are often "lost," I dis
agree with the way Theo articulated these and other
concerns. I've found the people, especially Barbara, to
be quite nice and accommodating when issues are
raised. With this said, the overall quality of food at
Axe & Palm isn't as good as similar off-campus venues
with similar pricings. It's doubtful that Axe & Palm
staff or management feel their tare, particularly their
burgers, tastes as good as those from Kirk's or In-N-
Out. I particularly like the crepes, but am unsure why
Axe & Palm limits the hours in which they are served.
Overall, Axe & Palm challenges students to balance
the tradeoffs between food quality and general con
venience, considering its location, acceptance of meal
plan points and suitability as a general meeting place.
I wouldn't necessarily frequent Axe & Palm if it
weren't in the middle of campus and weren't so con
venient for students on the University's dining plan,
but this assessment does not entail that Axe & Palm is
terrible — just that the convenience is its most salient
attribute."
Claire Collison '12 says that although she loves
the mint shakes, "whenever I bite into one of the taste
less hamburger patties, my taste buds explode in a
wave of disgust that my intestines erupt in a blast of
nausea. Axe & Palm burgers are an insult to the world
of meat."
