Even though we never got to meet Eric Mefford in per
son, his humor and laid-back personality showed
through even on paper. In a girl, he looks for someone
outgoing and energetic. "If she laughs at my jokes,
then she's a keeper," Eric said. "That's probably why
I'm single..."
Eric is involved in rowing and Intermission (+1
life point) at Stanford, and also likes to skateboard,

Unfortunately we only got to meet one of the
good-looking duo that is the Mefford twins —
Eric was away all last weekend and this week due
to a rowing competition. However, we encour
aged Eric to tell us about himself electronically,
which he did.
Tyler is, he claims, the more "chill" of the
Mefford twins. He looks for girls that are smart,
funny, and good-looking — but even if you can
check off these three boxes, don't raise your
hopes: Tyler has been dating his girlfriend for a
year and a half. Sorry ladies.
In terms of music, Tyler likes indie rock, includ
ing artists such as Davendra Banhart and The
Knife. He can play the guitar, the bass, and the
double-bass, and played bass for his high school
orchestra. When I inquired whether he'd ever
been in a band, Tyler responded, "Several." He's
also open to being in a band in the future — take
note,
In his free time he likes to skateboard — in fact,
he's been doing it for nine years. He says his worst
injury skateboarding was when he broke his arm
and foot, but he's "racked a rail on my nuts" a
couple of times as well. Ouch.
One thing you may not know about Tyler is
despite his young age he's very well-traveled.
Among the places he's been to are Australia, New
Zealand, China, Child, France, England, and
Italy. He told me that his favorite place to travel
to is China, but if he could live anywhere in the
world it'd be New Zealand.
Both Mefford brothers will be joining frater
nity Thcta Delta Chi.

"TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE A
LEPRECHAUN TO ME. ALL
YOU GOTTA DO IS LOOK UP
IN THE TREE. WHO ALL SEE
THE LEPRECHAUN? SAY
yeah!"

play music and cook in his free time. If he could
be anything, he'd want to be an astronaut. But
realistically, he'll probably be a physicist, perhaps
a professor.
When asked about his relationship with his
brother, Eric wrote, "It's pretty good. We're like
pinky and the brain; he's the crazy one. lust kid
ding ..."


If you can dream it, you
CAN DO IT."
