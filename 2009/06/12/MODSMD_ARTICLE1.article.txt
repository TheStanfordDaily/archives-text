## OBAMA IS ELECTED PRESIDENT 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
(jriginally published on Nov. <S', 2008
A makeshift bonfire broke out in the Main
Quad on I uesday night as Stanford students cel
ebrated the election of Sen. Barack ()bama (I)
111.) as the first African-American president of
the I Jnited States. Red plastic cups were thrust
high into the air as students celebrated the land
slide Electoral C ollege victory of the son of a
Kenyan father and Kansas mother who rose
from an unconventional upbringing to the na
tional spotlight after being elected to the Senate
just two years before.
()bama'scalls for change mobilized hundreds
of thousands of college students and generated
one of'the highest turnouts of young voters in the
nation's history.
Ihis heightened awareness was in no short
supply at Stanford, where early election returns
from the East Coast made it difficult for students
to concentrate during afternoon classes and
threatened to preempt some of the celebrations
planned for later in the evening.
But even as national polls pointed toward a
decisive victory for ()bama,students' enthusiasm
could not be dampened by the possibility of a
predetermined outcome. Cheers erupted at the
CoMo as several hundred students attending a
campus-wide Election Night party watched
swing state after swing state fall into Obama's
column.

"Tliis is a historical moment." said Tolu
Olorunnipa MAIW.
Reactions were markedly subdued at a small,
off-campus gathering of conservatives, many of
whom had been supporting the candidacy of
Obama's opponent. Sen. John McCain (R-
Ari/..).
"I've pretty much expected [the election] to
go for Obama," said Nathan Bamett 12 while
watching results come in at a restaurant on I Jni
versity Ave." I held onto a little hope,but the news
has kind of made me a little less optimistic."
'Never the Likeliest ( undulate"
()bama's victory marked the culmination of a
nearly two-year election cycle that witnessed a
long-fought primary battle, record-breaking
fundraising efforts and a series of historical mile
stones that shattered race and gender barriers in
the contest for the nation's highest office.
"If there is anyone out there who still doubts
that America is a place where all things are possi
hie. who still wonders if the dream of our
founders is alive in our time, who still questions
the power of our democracy, tonight is your an
swer." ( )bama told an estimated 125,(XX) people
in Chicago.
Hie election night extravaganza at the ("ol 10,
sponsored by many of the I Jniversity's major po
litical student groups, was the largest of a number
of election-watching gatherings taking place on
and off campus. At Branner Hall, close to 5(1
freshmen — many of whom voted in their first
presidential election—clustered around a pro

jection screen in the dorm's lounge to watch the
results filter in.
"I'm just excited to have a president that I can
believe in." said Ross Darwin 12 about an hour
before the polls closed in California.''l don't re
member being excited about a president. Now I
can be."
Acknowledging that he "was never the likeli
est candidate," Obama attributed his success to
the growth of a grassroots campaign that built on
small donations and a message of change that ap
pealed to a diverse cross-section of the American
electorate.
"It grew from the young people who rejected
the myth of their generation's apathy, who left
their homes and their families for jobs that of
fered little pay and less sleep." Obama said. "It
drew strength from the not-so-young people
who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to
knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the
millions of Americans who volunteered and or
ganized and proved that more than two centuries
later a government of the people, by the people
and for the people has not perished from the
Earth."
'A Journey of Self-Discovery'
One of these volunteers was Elizabeth
D'Aunno '(R political co-director and chief fi
nancial officer of the Stanford Democrats, who
stopped out of Stanford last fall to campaign for
()bama in lowa. She worked on a team responsi
ble for planning and executing the senator's ap
pearances in lowa in advance of the state's pri

mary caucuses, which ultimately gave Obama an
early lead on the path to his party's nomination.
Although her family had been living in lowa.
D'Aunno described her campaign work as "a
journey of self-discovery." By bringing her in con
tact with residents of other parts of the state,
D'Aunno said the campaign gave her an educa
tion in lowa's politics that paralleled the same
learning curve Obama met as he canvassed the
state.
"For me.it was the most formative experience
of my life," she said.
D'Aunno spent the early hours of Election
Night at the ('ol 10. where a standing-room-only
crowd was served free nachos and beer while
watching election returns on four screens. The
traditionally low-key atmosphere of the campus
coffee house was decked out with shimmering
red and blue streamers. Face masks of the candi
dates and election-themed coloring books were
on hand for those who sought a break from
watching election coverage.
"It's been outstanding so far." said Eric
Showen '(R chair of Stanford in Government
(SIC i), one of the co-sponsors of the event. "It's
exceeded my expectations. People seem to be
excited regardless ol their political affiliation."
The party, which was co-sponsored by the
ASSU.Stanford in Washington and the Stanford
Democrats, was billed as a non-partisan event.
But the crowd overwhelmingly supported
Obama's candidacy, often counting down the
seconds to network projections and cheering for
each state decided in Obama's favor. States that

went red were usually met by jeers from those
assembled.
"I'm more of an Obama guy. but I like both
candidates." said Will Young '09, w ho attended
the CoHo party."So when people here btx) Mc-
Cain whenever he wins a state, I don't join in. 1 le
doesn't deserve that."
Another Spectrum'
The increasingly rowdy atmosphere at the
Col lo contrasted with a smaller.quieter gather
ing of conservative students watching the elec
tion results on a small telev ision at Round Table
Pizza in Palo Alto.
Organizers said the event, co-hosted by The
Stanford Review and the Stanford College Re
publicans. was designed to provide attendees a
comfortable environment to view the results re
gardless of their political leanings.
"The gathering was supposed to be a sort of
place where people could come and meet to
gether. to feel they can express whatever their
views are." said Irina ()berman 'I) 1 ), president of
the Stanford College Republicans. "People
don't want to argue with their friends over polit
ical problems sometimes. It doesn't have to be in
your face."
Many conservatives suggested that Stanford
is an overwhelmingly liberal campus and that it
can often be difficult to present alternative view
points.They v iewed the off-campus gathering as
