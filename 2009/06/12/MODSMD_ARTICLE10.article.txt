(CAPS) and Residential lulu cation,

News A nalysis
Stanford is several years behind
peer institutions in publicly examin
ing and reporting on campus mental
health, with its first published analy
sis having come out last month.
The Student Mental Health and
Weil-Being Task Force, convened by
Provost John Etchemendy in fall
2006. released an 88-page report on
Oct. 1 detailing the campus mental
health climate and outlining recom
mendations for future courses of ac
tion. The report is the University's
first published, comprehensive ex
amination in response to recent
trends in student mental health.

But other institutions released
similar reports years ago.
MIT completed a mental health
report in 2(M)1. Harvard, Princeton
and Cornell all followed with their
own reports in 2004, and the Univer
sity of California system released a
report in 2006.
In Etchemendy's fall 2006 charge
letter to the task force, he cited na
tional and Stanford-specific trends
that point to a growing number of in
creasingly complex mental health is
sues.
"It is now well recognized that the
prevalence and complexity of stu
dent mental health issues has grown
in recent years both nationally and
here at Stanford," Etchemendy
wrote.
But if the deterioration of college
mental health is in fact a national
phenomenon, then Stanford's re
sponse to the problem is far behind -
the University did not commission a
task force until after Mi l. Harvard.
Princeton, Cornell and the UC sys
tem had all studied the issue and
published reports.
Etchemendy did not provide
comment on his charge letter and the
report's timing, despite requests by

The Daily.
Defending the Keport
At a meeting with The Daily three
weeks ago. University administrators
defended the report's comparatively
late release date.
"I don't consider this to be a race
to see who can come up with a report
first, hut for our community, for our
campus, it was time for us to address
this," said Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman.
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of
Vaden Health Center, agreed with
Boardman.
"Issues do emerge at different
universities at different rates, and
our desire was to address it when we
felt that we needed to." Friedman
said."Also. I don't think it's fair to say
that we weren't looking at these is
sues before. There was a lot of discus
sion on campus, among administra
tors and student affairs profession
als, on these issues."
According to Boardman. the Uni
versity's focus on mental health
began shortly after he was appointed
Vice Provost for Student Affairs in
January 2006. At that time. Board
man began discussing student men
tal health with Friedman, as the ad
ministrators noticed that mental
health situations were increasing in
complexity and frequency.
"TTiere was not anything magical
about the time," Boardman said.
"We were having issues, not unlike
many other institutions."
Administrators did not point to
particular events precipitating the
task force and its timing, rather cit
ing a general trend. Notably, howev
er. multiple suicides occurred in the
2006-2007 school vear.

"Issues do emerge at different universities
at different rates, and our desire was to
address it when we felt that we needed to."
IRA FRIEDMAN, Vaden Health Center director

According to Boardman, Stan
ford has actually been ahead of the
curve in campus mental health ef
forts.
"To be honest with you. we had a
very strong safety net, we were prob
ably further along [than other uni
versities)," Boardman said. "We may
not have had a report, but our prac
tices, our support system...many of
those were already in place, while I
think that many other universities
actually looked to us for some best
practices."
Some universities that released
reports at the beginning of the
decade were indeed behind the rest
of the nation.
In its 2001 mental health report,
MIT reported that it was the only
school in a group of nine peer institu
tions to not have evening mental
health office hours, and had a lower
mental health services utilization
rate (12 percent) than peer institu
tions (14-16 percent).
The Numbers: Counseling Services
A key indicator when gauging
how well a university is responding
to mental health concerns is the ratio
of students to mental health staff.
The International Association of
Counseling Services (IACS) recom
mends that one "full-time equiva
lent" professional staff member be
retained for every 1.000 to 1.500 stu
dents.
In the Stanford report, the task
force found that the University did
not meet this ratio, and recommend
ed the immediate hiring of addition
al counselors. Since the report's re
lease. the University has hired one
new. full-time psychiatry physician

also serving as director, three new
psychology Ph.D.s, two new half
time psychiatry physicians and one
masters-level case management so
cial worker. One psychologist posi
tion has yet to be filled, according to
Friedman.
Stanford, as of 2008, now meets
the I ACS recommended ratio, ac
cording to Boardman.
At the University of California,
administrators also found that they
were not meeting this critical ratio —
in 2006.
When it released its report in
2004, Princeton identified a "best
practices" level of staff increases at a
cost of $1.8 million, and then recom
mended an increase of 11 additional
"full-time equivalent" University
Health Services staff members at an
annual cost of $935,000.
In its 2001 report, MIT identified
that its mental health student-to
staffing ratio was behind peer institu
tions. and recommended that three
to four full-time positions be added.
The Numbers: Service Utilization
Looking at trends in mental
health data can be a reliable, relative
ly bias-free way to quantitatively as
sess the collegiate mental health cli
mate. But Stanford's report, unlike
that of several other institutions,
lacks basic data on the level of uti
lization of campus mental health re
sources.
The MIT report sets a benchmark
for an expected future level of uti
lization (20 percent of students).
The University of California pub
lished extensive data on past and
present psychiatric admissions,
across the UC svstern. The study

found, worryingly, that psychiatric
admissions were increasing at a rate
higher than enrollment growth.
Nowhere in the Stanford report is
data on student utilization of mental
health resources. Friedman told The
Daily that Stanford currently has a
similar utilization rate to MIT in
2(X)1 - with 10 to 12 percent of stu
dents visiting CAPS each year. He
added, however, that the University
does not have a specific target for uti
lization in mind, rather pursuing ef
forts at prevention of issues that
would lead a student to CAPS.
Putting the Report in Perspective
According to ASSU Senator
Patrick Cordova '09. who was a
member of the task force, the
group's effort was important be
cause it forced a variety of top ad
ministrators to look closely at men
tal health.
"It's interesting that there has
been for years some administrators
that really understand it." Cordova
said. "There have also been more
high-ranking individuals who really
have not had it at the top of their
mind. Because this was such a highly
charged and well-funded cause, it re
ally has reached high up."
University administrators agreed
that fact-finding was the task force's
main purpose, but insisted that, like
at some other universities, action
would follow quickly.
"We already have had some ac
tion with CAPS," Boardman said.
"We have had implementation of
QPR [Question. Persuade and
Refer], and that's going at full force.
Right now we are in the final stages
of adopting an oversight committee,
who will be assigned to monitoring
the progress."
The Daily will be covering
changes within CAPS later in this se
ries.
But with the slow economy, and
the recent announcement of $45 mil
lion in University budget cuts, the
mental health task force's recom
mendations may not be implement
ed right away.
"To be honest, the timing of some
this may be unfortunate with the
economy as it is, so we are vying for
resources that may or may not be
available." Boardman said.

how well a university is responding
to mental health concerns is the ratio
of students to mental health staff.
The International Association of
Counseling Services (IACS) recom
mends that one "full-time equiva
lent" professional staff member be
retained for every 1.000 to 1.500 stu
dents.
In the Stanford report, the task
force found that the University did
not meet this ratio, and recommend
ed the immediate hiring of addition
al counselors. Since the report's re
lease. the University has hired one
new. full-time psychiatry physician

also serving as director, three new
psychology Ph.D.s, two new half
time psychiatry physicians and one
masters-level case management so
cial worker. One psychologist posi
tion has yet to be filled, according to
Friedman.
Stanford, as of 2008, now meets
the I ACS recommended ratio, ac
cording to Boardman.
At the University of California,
administrators also found that they
were not meeting this critical ratio —
in 2006.
When it released its report in
2004, Princeton identified a "best
practices" level of staff increases at a
cost of $1.8 million, and then recom
mended an increase of 11 additional
"full-time equivalent" University
Health Services staff members at an
annual cost of $935,000.
In its 2001 report, MIT identified
that its mental health student-to
staffing ratio was behind peer institu
tions. and recommended that three
to four full-time positions be added.
The Numbers: Service Utilization
Looking at trends in mental
health data can be a reliable, relative
ly bias-free way to quantitatively as
sess the collegiate mental health cli
mate. But Stanford's report, unlike
that of several other institutions,
lacks basic data on the level of uti
lization of campus mental health re
sources.
The MIT report sets a benchmark
for an expected future level of uti
lization (20 percent of students).
The University of California pub
lished extensive data on past and
present psychiatric admissions,
across the UC svstern. The study

found, worryingly, that psychiatric
admissions were increasing at a rate
higher than enrollment growth.
Nowhere in the Stanford report is
data on student utilization of mental
health resources. Friedman told The
Daily that Stanford currently has a
similar utilization rate to MIT in
2(X)1 - with 10 to 12 percent of stu
dents visiting CAPS each year. He
added, however, that the University
does not have a specific target for uti
lization in mind, rather pursuing ef
forts at prevention of issues that
would lead a student to CAPS.
Putting the Report in Perspective
According to ASSU Senator
Patrick Cordova '09. who was a
member of the task force, the
group's effort was important be
cause it forced a variety of top ad
ministrators to look closely at men
tal health.
"It's interesting that there has
been for years some administrators
that really understand it." Cordova
said. "There have also been more
high-ranking individuals who really
have not had it at the top of their
mind. Because this was such a highly
charged and well-funded cause, it re
ally has reached high up."
University administrators agreed
that fact-finding was the task force's
main purpose, but insisted that, like
at some other universities, action
would follow quickly.
"We already have had some ac
tion with CAPS," Boardman said.
"We have had implementation of
QPR [Question. Persuade and
Refer], and that's going at full force.
Right now we are in the final stages
of adopting an oversight committee,
who will be assigned to monitoring
the progress."
The Daily will be covering
changes within CAPS later in this se
ries.
But with the slow economy, and
the recent announcement of $45 mil
lion in University budget cuts, the
mental health task force's recom
mendations may not be implement
ed right away.
"To be honest, the timing of some
this may be unfortunate with the
economy as it is, so we are vying for
resources that may or may not be
available." Boardman said.

News A nalysis
Stanford is several years behind
peer institutions in publicly examin
ing and reporting on campus mental
health, with its first published analy
sis having come out last month.
The Student Mental Health and
Weil-Being Task Force, convened by
Provost John Etchemendy in fall
2006. released an 88-page report on
Oct. 1 detailing the campus mental
health climate and outlining recom
mendations for future courses of ac
tion. The report is the University's
first published, comprehensive ex
amination in response to recent
trends in student mental health.

But other institutions released
similar reports years ago.
MIT completed a mental health
report in 2(M)1. Harvard, Princeton
and Cornell all followed with their
own reports in 2004, and the Univer
sity of California system released a
report in 2006.
In Etchemendy's fall 2006 charge
letter to the task force, he cited na
tional and Stanford-specific trends
that point to a growing number of in
creasingly complex mental health is
sues.
"It is now well recognized that the
prevalence and complexity of stu
dent mental health issues has grown
in recent years both nationally and
here at Stanford," Etchemendy
wrote.
But if the deterioration of college
mental health is in fact a national
phenomenon, then Stanford's re
sponse to the problem is far behind -
the University did not commission a
task force until after Mi l. Harvard.
Princeton, Cornell and the UC sys
tem had all studied the issue and
published reports.
Etchemendy did not provide
comment on his charge letter and the
report's timing, despite requests by

The Daily.
Defending the Keport
At a meeting with The Daily three
weeks ago. University administrators
defended the report's comparatively
late release date.
"I don't consider this to be a race
to see who can come up with a report
first, hut for our community, for our
campus, it was time for us to address
this," said Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman.
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of
Vaden Health Center, agreed with
Boardman.
"Issues do emerge at different
universities at different rates, and
our desire was to address it when we
felt that we needed to." Friedman
said."Also. I don't think it's fair to say
that we weren't looking at these is
sues before. There was a lot of discus
sion on campus, among administra
tors and student affairs profession
als, on these issues."
According to Boardman. the Uni
versity's focus on mental health
began shortly after he was appointed
Vice Provost for Student Affairs in
January 2006. At that time. Board
man began discussing student men
tal health with Friedman, as the ad
ministrators noticed that mental
health situations were increasing in
complexity and frequency.
"TTiere was not anything magical
about the time," Boardman said.
"We were having issues, not unlike
many other institutions."
Administrators did not point to
particular events precipitating the
task force and its timing, rather cit
ing a general trend. Notably, howev
er. multiple suicides occurred in the
2006-2007 school vear.

"Issues do emerge at different universities
at different rates, and our desire was to
address it when we felt that we needed to."
IRA FRIEDMAN, Vaden Health Center director

According to Boardman, Stan
ford has actually been ahead of the
curve in campus mental health ef
forts.
"To be honest with you. we had a
very strong safety net, we were prob
ably further along [than other uni
versities)," Boardman said. "We may
not have had a report, but our prac
tices, our support system...many of
those were already in place, while I
think that many other universities
actually looked to us for some best
practices."
Some universities that released
reports at the beginning of the
decade were indeed behind the rest
of the nation.
In its 2001 mental health report,
MIT reported that it was the only
school in a group of nine peer institu
tions to not have evening mental
health office hours, and had a lower
mental health services utilization
rate (12 percent) than peer institu
tions (14-16 percent).

of students to mental health staff.
