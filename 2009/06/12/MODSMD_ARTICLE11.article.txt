## FMOTQ: Through the eyes of a freshman

It's 10 p.m.. and preparations are
complete. Stanford police officers are
surrounding the perimeter of the Ouad.
Metal barriers are in place in an attempt
to block the entrance from wandering
Palo Alto natives, high school students
and other unwanted additions to Stan
ford's own l.ove l est. Countless Peer
Health Educators (PHI s) have assem
bled tables stocked with free goodies,
from condoms to breath strips to choco
late Hershev's kisses.
Usually prominent. Memorial
Church and Rodin's Bergers are mere
backdrops to the growing festivity on
the Quad. Hie air is a crisp 5 l ) degrees,
and the moon is aglow. Red and blue
lights radiate from the stage set up un
derneath one of the sandstone arches.
It's 10:30 p.m.. and the party is still
pretty dead. Giddy packs of freshmen
make their way from their dorms, anx
iously anticipating a night of free love
and promiscuity. Or at least that's how
their Residential Assistants (RAs) and
upperclassmen counterparts described
it.
While entering the Quad, two girls
giggle at the "No obvious drunkenness"
sign. They whisper loudly that they
aren't that drunk as they flash their stu
dent IDs and stumble past the compla
cent Stanford police officer.
A chick rock band predictably
croons Katy Perry's."l kissed a girl and
I liked it ..." At this point, several in
spired pairs of girls decide to make out.
to the pure delight of the boys sur
rounding them.
Half ail hour passes and the crowds
are steadily trickling in. Students gather
in small, awkward huddles, clinging to
the friends they came with. (iroups of
students chatter incessantly:
"Is this it?" proclaims a bored
sounding girl.checking her i Phone.
"We're so early." replies her friend,
looking around expectantly. "I told you
we shouldn't have come until mid

night."
Ihe much-hyped l ull Moon on the
Quad event is currently appearing to he
a major letdown.The Quad is still rela
tively open and everyone around seems
to be a member of the ('lass of 2012.
"But what if no one wants to kiss
me?" slurs another student, clinging to
her roommate's shoulder for support.
Ihe roommate turns to another
friend.
"I should have taken another shot."
she says. "I'm definitely not drunk
enough."
At the same time, two Pi Phis, easily
identified by their matching black tank
tops, chant. "Make-out! Make-out!" as
they skip through the crowds.
Ihe pressure is indeed mounting.
F.very freshman girl is expected to find
a senior boy to kiss come midnight. Yet.
with just under an hour to go. the upper
classmen prospects seem very limited.
So much for being truly initiated into
the Stanford community.
I he music blares.The countdown to
midnight continues.
It's 11:3(1 p.m.. and the Ouad has
taken on a new life. Dancers wearing
white button down shirts, ties and little
more are performing a hip-hop dance
routine on stage. Hie random sprin
klings of people have now united into
one swaying conglomerate.
It seems as if everyone is out tonight
the athletes, the Greeks, the studious
kid upstairs that never comes out. a slew
of graduate students wearing their
hoodless Stanford sweatshirts. Hven the
friendly man that works at the front
desk of the library has made an appear
ance.
A new student music group has
taken the stage, and they break into a
very sensual rendition of Marvin
(iave's "I.et's (Jet It ()n." Boys and girls
scope out the scene.scouting a potential
hook-up. It must be nearly midnight.
And then it happens. An unknown
blond boy meanders suavely in the di
rection of several freshman girls
"So." he begins, speaking slowly.
"Are you guys freshmen?"

The girls look at each other with eon
fusion and expectation, fear and exhila
ration.
The boldest of them speaks.
"Uh. yeah?" she replies hesitantly.
Rut there is no going hack. Long
gone are the courteous days when sen
ior hoys and freshman girls lined up on
opposite ends of the Quad, meeting in
the middle for a quick kiss.
And with that, it's now 12:01 a.m.,
and the Quad is an epicenter of utter
merrymaking madness.
But not everyone in the Ouad is
there for an anonymous kiss. Some
stand off to the side, simply watching
with amusement. Others are clustered
directly below the stage, dancing to the
vibrant beats of the bands.
And some are evading the random
smooch. There's the easy rejection, the
rapid look to the ground, the "Oh. I'm
not actually a freshman girl" excuse.
And when all else fails, the rapid walk
(or run) in the opposite direction is al
ways effective.
As the night wears on. the remaining
partiers may encounter the senior boys
wearing "tie-tac-toe" shirts that feature
a different freshman dorm in each
square. Or there's the much older man
with a ponytail and receding hairline
milling through the crowd. Or there are
the naked people in body paint. Or the
Stanford Tree, who arrives with the rest
of the Band just after midnight.
This carries on for approximately an
hour.
Finally, I a.m. rolls around, and the
Quad is emptying out. The music has
stopped. Once jubilant people are now
tired and hungry, and for many, the
night concludes with greasy food at the
Axe & Palm or Lag LateNite.
Come tomorrow, the accidental
hookup, or the developing case of mono
or the perpetual haunting question of
"Did I hook up with that guy last
night?" may be one one's mind. But
tonight, the cra/iness that is Full Moon
on the Ouad does not matter in the
least, tonight is about Stanford tradi
tion and a good, free-loving time.
