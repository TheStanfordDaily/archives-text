On Facebook these days. Stan
ford students can expect to find
many pictures of spirited groups of
red-clad fans at football games, the
occasional family vacation photo
and Barack Obama.
As Election Day draws closer. '
Stanford students are turning to
their personal Facebook pages
specifically, their profile pictures
— to publicly display their candi
date of choice come November.
Fric I ran' 10 is one such student.
Several weeks ago. he posted an
image showing all four candidates

equated with different trains. Sen
Obama (D III.) is paired with a sleek.

modern train, and Sen. Joe Biden
(D-Del.) with a typical freight train.
On the other hand. Sen. John Mc-

C'ain (R-Ariz.) is portrayed with a very old-fashioned
steam train, and finally. Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is
illustrated with a wooden toy train, careening off the
tracks.
Trail explained his motivation for publicly posting the
image.
"I was trying to share a metaphor that I found very
apt." he said."lt was meant to show the hilarious juxtapo
sition of Sarah Palin with Obama and Biden. I put it up
after the vice presidential debate to help me laugh off her
horrendous performance.
I lumorous images such as Iran's, as well as more in
spirational and poster-quality images have been freely
circulating the Internet and popping upon countless pro
files. Ihe pictures do not seem to have a common source,
but rather are taken from (ioogle Images.candidate Web
sites, emails from friends and other online sources.
On the Stanford I acebook network, the vast majority
of candidate-themed profile pictures are pro-Obama.
This could be explained by Obama's much larger net
work Of support Mil lacebook 2.2 million plus SUp
porters to McCain's half million — or by Stanford's po
litical climate.
Xavier Gaeta '09 felt that the campus' pro-Obama
leaning could contribute to this disparity.
"In terms of design. I think that Obama has catchier
posters." he said. "But I also think that because of the
general atmosphere on campus there's more tolerance
for pictures of Obama whereas with McCain I think
there's a fear that you may be judged.

Louis Schueller M 2 shared Gaeta's sentiment that
there may he a negative stigma attached to posting a Mc-
Cain photo on Facebook.

"To date, I don't think that
I've seen one profile pieture of John
McCain." he said."People don't want
to he associated with a man that's
old. fat and can't smile."
Downright against the Re
publican ticket, a few students have
posted images of vice presidential
| candidate Sarah Palin, but have re
' placed "HOPE" with "NOPE" in a
twist on the Obama poster.
Apparently students are fine
with being associated with Obama
and members of his campaign have
noticed this phenomenon.
Perry Rosenstein '07 now

works for Obama for Ameriea in Nevada as
► the state's New Media Director. A large part

of his work centers around social network
outreach on Web sites like lacebook and
MySpace. According to him. political pic-

tures on students' profiles extend the greater role of iden
tity on Facebook.
"Since the beginning of Facebook, you've h;id people
putting their favorite books and quotes in their profiles,
and demonstrate who their friends are by writing publicly
on their wall." he s;iid. "Putting up an Obama photo on
one's profile is just an extension of this sell identifica
tion."
Although the profile picture trend is noticeable.some
students said they don't give much thought to the politi
cally charged profile pictures of their peers.
Joseph Lester '11. a political science major, said he is
not persuaded by profile pictures that feature a political
figure or message.
"I don't think anything of it."he said. " You get an idea
for what they believe in and what they support, and that's
all It doesn't tell you anything substantial about their be
liefs. It's like an advertisement that tells you nothing
about the product."
Rosenstein agreed that the role ol the profile picture
is not a campaign tactic. Rat her. he returned to the notion
that Facebook allows people to publicly affiliate with
something and make "a lot more salient" where they
stand.
"I don't think when putting up a photo that someone
is trying to lobby for votes." Rosenstein said. "It's not po
litical in the same way that holding a fundraiser for a can
didate is political. It's political in the sense that you are
saying how important this election is and how important
this candidate is to you."
