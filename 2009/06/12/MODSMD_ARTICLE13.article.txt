li started right after midnight on the second night
ol Admit Weekend. Prospective freshmen (ProFros)
were told to grab bathing suits and flip flops, and ac
company their room hosts ( Rol los) to the lounge. I he
ensuing journey. Stanford's lb fountain marathon
around campus, affectionately known as fountain
hopping, is a rite of passage for many entering stu
dents.
112 ountain hopping originated sometime during the
early IMNOs. although its exact origins are unknown.
Hopping is most common in the springtime and dur
ing early tail quarter, when the weather is favorable.
I he tradition is an Admit Weekend and New Student
Orientation (NS()) cliche, but something most stu
dents experience at least once during their undergrad
uate careers.
"Fountain hopping has been a tradition at least as
long as I've been around, which dates back to 11M5,"l l M5,"
said Dean of Freshmen Julie l.ythcott Maims. "When
I was a frosh. I thought it meant hopping into and out
of. or up and down in. a fountain, but I soon came to
learn it meant hopping around campus from fountain
to fountain, much as you might go on a visit to many
different pubs at Stanford in ()xford (known as a 'pub
crawl ), as was done in my day."
Moth Ihe Claw in White Plaza and the Red Hoop
Fountain in front ol (irecn I ibrary are highlights of a
fountain hopping excursion. Many students learn the
secrets behind fountain hopping including those
pesky lights at the bottom of the Hoop and the ques
tionable water in Terman — from their RoMos or
Resident Assistants (R As).
"During an amazingly sunny day. I found myself
being dragged out in my workout gear to go fountain
hopping." said Natasha Mart ho I 'I I of her expeirence.

"I was a little regretful at first.hut after the first dip. it
was all worth it from there."

during his NSO week He is now an avid fountain re
laxer. and arranged for fountain floating with his
Rohle freshmen most I ridays during fall quarter.
"My first lime fountain hopping was during NSO
— my RA took me out and taught me how to make
the whirlpool in the Old Union fountain, and also
taught me to watch out for the underwater lights in the
I loop.' Barton said."Now I've collected a flotilla over
the past few years and I take them out whenever I can

Hmily Mitchell, a prospective freshman and at
tendee of this year's Admit Weekend, had heard be
forehand about Stanford students' aptitude for foun
tain hopping, and was ready to try it herself.
"I d heard about fountain hopping before, since it
seems to be somewhat of a Stanford cliche, probably
because there are four million fountains on campus."
Mitchell said. "Someone suggested that we go foun
tain hopping, and I figured why not. I can only be an
obnoxious Prol roonce in my life, right?"
Although many eager I'rol ros and freshmen will
ingly head into the Old Union fountain to make a
whirlpool 01 dash to the freezing water in the I lewlett
fountain, most upperclassmen transition from hop
ping to floating and relaxing.
"My favorite memory is probably over summer in
the MemAud (Memorial Auditorium) fountain: I |list
had a feeling of complete and utter relaxation while
chatting and laughing with friends." Barton said. "It
was perfect. It's not exciting, but fountain hopping is

Barton added that the fountain in front of
MemAud is the best for just floating in,"but the ( law
