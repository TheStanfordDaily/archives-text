li started right after midnight on the second night
ol Admit Weekend. Prospective freshmen (ProFros)
were told to grab bathing suits and flip flops, and ac
company their room hosts ( Rol los) to the lounge. I he
ensuing journey. Stanford's lb fountain marathon
around campus, affectionately known as fountain
hopping, is a rite of passage for many entering stu
dents.
112 ountain hopping originated sometime during the
early IMNOs. although its exact origins are unknown.
Hopping is most common in the springtime and dur
ing early tail quarter, when the weather is favorable.
I he tradition is an Admit Weekend and New Student
Orientation (NS()) cliche, but something most stu
dents experience at least once during their undergrad
uate careers.
"Fountain hopping has been a tradition at least as
long as I've been around, which dates back to 11M5,"l l M5,"
said Dean of Freshmen Julie l.ythcott Maims. "When
I was a frosh. I thought it meant hopping into and out
of. or up and down in. a fountain, but I soon came to
learn it meant hopping around campus from fountain
to fountain, much as you might go on a visit to many
different pubs at Stanford in ()xford (known as a 'pub
crawl ), as was done in my day."
Moth Ihe Claw in White Plaza and the Red Hoop
Fountain in front ol (irecn I ibrary are highlights of a
fountain hopping excursion. Many students learn the
secrets behind fountain hopping including those
pesky lights at the bottom of the Hoop and the ques
tionable water in Terman — from their RoMos or
Resident Assistants (R As).
"During an amazingly sunny day. I found myself
being dragged out in my workout gear to go fountain
hopping." said Natasha Mart ho I 'I I of her expeirence.

"I was a little regretful at first.hut after the first dip. it
was all worth it from there."
RA James Barton 'OM first jumped into a fountain
during his NSO week He is now an avid fountain re
laxer. and arranged for fountain floating with his
Rohle freshmen most I ridays during fall quarter.
"My first lime fountain hopping was during NSO
— my RA took me out and taught me how to make
the whirlpool in the Old Union fountain, and also
taught me to watch out for the underwater lights in the
I loop.' Barton said."Now I've collected a flotilla over
the past few years and I take them out whenever I can
I have a navigable boat, a few rafts and a lobster."
Hmily Mitchell, a prospective freshman and at
tendee of this year's Admit Weekend, had heard be
forehand about Stanford students' aptitude for foun
tain hopping, and was ready to try it herself.
"I d heard about fountain hopping before, since it
seems to be somewhat of a Stanford cliche, probably
because there are four million fountains on campus."
Mitchell said. "Someone suggested that we go foun
tain hopping, and I figured why not. I can only be an
obnoxious Prol roonce in my life, right?"
Although many eager I'rol ros and freshmen will
ingly head into the Old Union fountain to make a
whirlpool 01 dash to the freezing water in the I lewlett
fountain, most upperclassmen transition from hop
ping to floating and relaxing.
"My favorite memory is probably over summer in
the MemAud (Memorial Auditorium) fountain: I |list
had a feeling of complete and utter relaxation while
chatting and laughing with friends." Barton said. "It
was perfect. It's not exciting, but fountain hopping is
about relaxation."
Barton added that the fountain in front of
MemAud is the best for just floating in,"but the ( law


FRIC LEW/The Stanford Daily
WET AND WILD • Students frolic in the Claw in the much-beloved Stanford tradition of fountain hopping
is the best for effect."
In addition to hopping on spring
days, many events are held in and
around the fountains — including
the Band's barbeque during Admit
Weekend. Dollie Splash and several
fraternity and sorority affairs.
"1 have seen numerous events in
fountains, from climbing the C law
and making out to Big Chill with my
sorority girls." Barthel said. "We
went out and just played in the
water, studied, talked and tanned
for a whole afternoon. It was amaz
ing. It's a great way to meet people
around the fountain who also stop
by to take a dip with their feet or
even whole body."
And like many ProFros, Mitchell
learned more than just what Stan
ford has to offer academically on
her jaunt across campus.
"I learned that you definitely
should not jump into the fountains
because it will inevitably result in
you slipping, landing hard on your
butt and being soaked from head to
toe...none of which is attractive in
any way!" she joked. "But I'm glad I
did it, just because it is something
funny and kind of foolish to look
back on and laugh about in the
coming years. Plus, when I got home
and people asked me what I had
done ;it Stanford, it was great to be
able to casually say,' Oh. you know,
just went fountain hopping.'"
Lythcott-Haims emphasized the
activity's close connection with the
University's image.
"Fountain hopping is one of
those wacky Stanford traditions
that in the aggregate make us who
we are." she said. "Fun is to be had
here at Stanford — in the class
rooms and in the fountains."
Barton agreed.
"I really enjoy it when the tour
groups pass through White Plaza
they stop and take pictures." he
said. "I think it shows the prospec
tive students that we can be an out
standing academic institution, but
on any given afternoon we might
say. 'Screw work. I'm going for a
float.'"
And as a Rollo said while lead
ing a group of ProFros to the Claw
that night during Admit Weekend.
