Everyone does it. Some of us are silent and
secretive. Some of us like to bring a snack or a
good magazine, play a game or burn incense.
And some of us are just looking to make new
friends. Stanford is a diverse place, but one
thing unites us all — the bathroom.
TOILET TALK
"It's a captive audience,and I've got nothing
else to do," explained Alden Timme *11. who
professed great enthusiasm for making conver
sation on the john. "It's a great time, because
otherwise,you're doing work or something and
you have to concentrate. But usuallv. when

you're showering or dumping, there's no con
centration that goes into cleaning yourself —
you can have a good conversation."
For Timme, comfort room chats were just
another branch of dorm bonding.
Alex Scherer '11. who lived in Alondra with
Timme last year, is not so comfortable with the
idea of toilet talk.
"I don't like to talk while I'm naked," he
said."lf you think about it. while you're naked,
you could be looking at your junk; and if you're
looking at your junk. I don't want someone
looking at their junk while they're thinking of
me or vice versa. 1 don't want my face to be as
sociated with junk."
Scherer has. in fact, been known to curb any
attempts at restroom conversation, responding

to a question or commenting politely, albeit
curtly, before choosing to discontinue the bath
room banter.
"When I tried to talk with Alex last year, he
like almost yelled at me,"Timme noted."[Alex]
thought that bathroom time was a man's time
of solace to meditate on his thoughts."
Many Stanford students are not as
rightwing as Scherer, and fewer are leftists
when it comes to toilet tete-a-tetes. In fact, they
usually hover somewhere around the center of
the spectrum, preferring to limit discussions to
the showers and sinks.
"That's usually where we'd have our time to
catch up," said Michelle Dadourian 11. "Gen
erally when you're in the stalls though. 1 would
say that's a no-go."

Eric Molina "11
agreed.

"When you're I
on the toilet, it's like )

being on the \
throne," he said. "You

don't want to be both
ered. You want to comm
in peace."

Some even go so far as to schedule their
showers together in order to avail of
these sink-side chats.

Naturally, however, as these codes of eti
quette are. for the most part, unwritten, they
rarely help in regulating the use and misuse of
