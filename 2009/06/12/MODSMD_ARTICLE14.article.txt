Everyone does it. Some of us are silent and
secretive. Some of us like to bring a snack or a
good magazine, play a game or burn incense.
And some of us are just looking to make new
friends. Stanford is a diverse place, but one
thing unites us all — the bathroom.
TOILET TALK
"It's a captive audience,and I've got nothing
else to do," explained Alden Timme *11. who
professed great enthusiasm for making conver
sation on the john. "It's a great time, because
otherwise,you're doing work or something and
you have to concentrate. But usuallv. when

you're showering or dumping, there's no con
centration that goes into cleaning yourself —
you can have a good conversation."
For Timme, comfort room chats were just
another branch of dorm bonding.
Alex Scherer '11. who lived in Alondra with
Timme last year, is not so comfortable with the
idea of toilet talk.
"I don't like to talk while I'm naked," he
said."lf you think about it. while you're naked,
you could be looking at your junk; and if you're
looking at your junk. I don't want someone
looking at their junk while they're thinking of
me or vice versa. 1 don't want my face to be as
sociated with junk."
Scherer has. in fact, been known to curb any
attempts at restroom conversation, responding

to a question or commenting politely, albeit
curtly, before choosing to discontinue the bath
room banter.
"When I tried to talk with Alex last year, he
like almost yelled at me,"Timme noted."[Alex]
thought that bathroom time was a man's time
of solace to meditate on his thoughts."
Many Stanford students are not as
rightwing as Scherer, and fewer are leftists
when it comes to toilet tete-a-tetes. In fact, they
usually hover somewhere around the center of
the spectrum, preferring to limit discussions to
the showers and sinks.
"That's usually where we'd have our time to
catch up," said Michelle Dadourian 11. "Gen
erally when you're in the stalls though. 1 would
say that's a no-go."

Eric Molina "11
agreed.

"When you're I
on the toilet, it's like )

being on the \
throne," he said. "You

don't want to be both
ered. You want to comm
in peace."

Some even go so far as to schedule their
showers together in order to avail of
these sink-side chats.

Naturally, however, as these codes of eti
quette are. for the most part, unwritten, they
rarely help in regulating the use and misuse of

the dormitory bathrooms. Where the
Emily Post protocol will not suffice
or simply does not apply, Stanford
students have resorted to intriguing
solutions in loo' of etiquette.
YOUR BATHROOM IS A TEM
PEE
Over the years, the water closet
has progressed into a make-shift hid
ing place — a peaceful sanctuary
that, for many, is superior to the bed
room as a common go-to for some
quality "me" time. The white, or oth
erwise neutral-colored, tiles and the
promise of privacy have long been
conducive to puzzling out the tough
est questions on a problem set. for
mulating a thesis or maybe just doing
a little late-night soul searching.
The men's bathroom on the third
floor of Rinconada (Rinc) in Wilbur
has an unusual architecture that
hints at the regal. Light pours in from
a circular window, bathing trape
zoid-shaped urinals in glowing white
light. There are five or six gathered
together, as if the niche doubles as a
forum for the Roman Assembly. Stu
dents may as well wear togas instead
of towels as they make their way to
the showers in a separate wing.
It's difficult to determine whether
or not it was the bathroom's natural
character or sheer audacity that pro
pelled Cougar Oswald '12 to pimp
his potty.
"A man's toilet is his oasis," Os
wald wrote in an email to The Daily.
While this Rinc bathroom is not
exactly paradise, Oswald did try to
come close. Posters, smokeless in
cense and a literary menu including
Maxim were employed to furnish
this "home away from home." Os
wald also provided a poo diary for
the Rinc boys, perhaps to facilitate
their soul searching, though they
have yet to reach nirvana.
Oswald, unfortunately, declined
The Daily's offer for an in-bathroom
interview, in an effort to preserve the
sanctity of his private space.
"Some men. like those in the third
floor at Rinc, are lucky enough to
have toilet accessories." Oswald
wrote. "Whether it is a solo poo — a
great opportunity to get some time

to yourself — or a social poo —
some of my best conversations are
those with fellow poopers in adja
cent stalls — my time on the john is
often one of my favorite parts of the
day. Above all. however, men go to
the toilet to escape the stress and so
cial etiquette forced upon us by the
female sex. We can always rest as
sured that our poos are private en
deavors of which the details are
known exclusively by our fellow
males."
HIDE AND GO POOP
While most students do not have
the lavatory luxuries of the third
floor at Rinc. many still think of cre
ative ways to pass time in the 100. In
Alondra last spring, a small band of
boys on the third floor answered na
ture's call — of creativity.
Scherer introduced the game
Hide and Go Poop — known as
Poop and Go Seek outside of Eu
rope — to fellow AlondransTimme,
Zach Koehn '11 and Mark Frykman
'11. While Scherer is a firm believer
in private pooping, he proposed that
the game test one's ability to "se
crete" their time on the crapper.
"It's fun to do something that's
silly and wacky and a little revolting
to some people." he said, smiling
wryly. "You know, it gets a rise out of
people. It's a little taboo."
Hide and Go Poop contenders
gained points by either hitting their
opponents with a wet paper towel
while they were on the john or poop
ing without being hit. Five points
were awarded for each successful
poop and three points for a "catch."
Hie game grew to include a ma
jority of the boys living on the third
floor. TTiey all noted that timing was
key in getting ahead.
"Certain times of the day are no
toriously hot for dumping." Frykman
said. "A little bit after lunch was a
good one."
Some followed the "early and
often" plan or avoided contact alto
gether. choosing pockets of time
when no one was around, while oth
ers chose to go with the flow. One
Alondran even opted to squat on top
of the toilet in his eagerness to gain a
few points. Most tactics, however,
were ineffective due to the rather
small pool of players and limited fa
cilities.
"We didn't have a lot of people
playing, so it was always pretty obvi
ous that someone was pooping,"

Frykman said.
I fide and Go Poop, in spite of the
hype, was relatively short-lived, last
ing only two to three weeks. The
Alondrans lost interest for a variety
of reasons. Some, like Timme. were
frustrated, unable to climb the point
ladder.
"1 was losing pretty badly, and I
tried to sabotage the scoring sys
tem," he said. "But I can't aim very
well over the stall."
In the end, however, the Alon
drans were tired of the pressure.
"It was no longer exciting." Scher
er lamented. "I just wanted to take a
poop in peace again."
THE LOOKING GLASS
Innovation is unparalleled in
many ways at Stanford — avoiding
the awkwardness of a public bath
room included. But, sometimes, we
just have to embrace it.
For Stanford students living in Phi
Sig. the issue extends beyond having
privacy invaded by a common bath
room. Residents must contend with
glass shower doors, which definitely
leave little to the imagination.
"You can't see through them com
pletely, but it's pretty invasive at the
same time," said Ron Pomper il.
"Someone also took a picture of me
while I was in the bathroom, and that
was really awkward because you
could tell it was me."
A few students opted to strategi
cally drape their towels over the
shower doors or shower in the dark. It
became increasingly more uncom
fortable. for the boys especially, when
the cleaning schedule conflicted with
prime morning shower time.
1 lowever. many residents were not
as affected and became accustomed
more easily and quickly to the shower
doors.
"Since they're somewhat misty,
you can't see people or whatever, you
can just see shapes and colors,"
Dadourian said. "I want to say in the
beginning of the year it was definitely
more awkward, but now everyone's
pretty used to the idea."
The inherently chaotic lifestyle of
the quarter system requires a bit of
time to flush away pandemonium
from a Stanford student's head, and
toilet talk,games or a simple conver
sation can help to alleviate some of
the stress. Stanford houses some of
the most brilliant people in the
world, but hey, we all still have to
poop.
