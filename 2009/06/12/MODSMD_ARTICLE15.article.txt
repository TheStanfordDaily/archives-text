All across campus, screams inaugurate the
beginning of Dead Week. But within the thick
stone walls and Plexiglas windows that enclose
the first-floor lobby of Meyer Library, the only
sound heard is the quiet hum of the tluorescent
bulbs that permanently bathe the room in an un
naturally yellowish glow.
Wen ()i Chin "(W comes in through the en
trance that opens out toward l ast Campus, and
for a brief second, the muted screams from out
side are faint but audible.
A few people jerk their heads upward as the
door clatters to a close, but the rest do not both
er to look up from their textbooks or away from
iheir computers. Highlighters continue to scroll
rapidly across text. Fingers dart pointedly atop
keyboards. Pens scratch silently and unceasingly

at notepads.
Chin surveys the room,her eyes moving from
the scattered desks and half-couches on one side
to the mishmash of sofa chairs and Apple com
puters arranged on the other. She heads to her
left, pulls up a misplaced chair and rolls it toward
one of the many iMacs that line the wall.
"I don't usually come here," Chin insists.
"Only when I really need to get work done. But
I'm staying here today as long as it takes to fin
ish this History of Modern China paper."
She pauses.
"Well, an outline of it at least."
Time crawls forward, and barely anyone
moves from his or her seat. A few students enter
through one side of the library, shooting quiet
glances of curiosity or disgust at the museum ex
hibit of workers, walking past quickly and exit
ing through the other side.
Adrienne Gispen '11 finally breaks the si

lence, standing up and stretching before collect
ing the papers that she had spread so diligently
across the small desk where she had been work
ing.
"I still have some more work to do." she sighs.
"But it's really time for a change of scenery."
When it hits two in the morning, a sudden in
flux of people pushes their way in from the en
trance closest to Green Library.
Jae Jang *10 and Candice Kwark "12 come in
together, Jang grasping an AMP energy drink
and Kwark a stainless-steel coffee mug brim
ming with tea. Jang claims a small desk with the
AMP and signals to Kwark.
"We come here all the time." Jang admits.
"After a while, you start to notice the regulars.
And it does get lonely in here sometimes. So you
decide to sit together for support."
"I come here out of convenience, but this
place is pretty depressing." Kwark affirms. "Just

look at the walls!"
She gestures at the drab colors surrounding
her. the mottled brown and gray stone, a slightly
lighter shade of the same carpet pattern set
against the backdrop of windows blackened by
the dead of night.
First-year materials science grad student
John Colei recognizes his colleague Mark Jen
nings. a first-year grad student in civil engineer
ing. and they palm their hands together in greet
ing. Jennings laughs, cocking both of his index
fingers at his head and pulling his thumbs like
triggers as he sighs in exasperation and points at
his unfinished paper. Jennings inquires about
Colei. who is clearly not a regular.
"Oh. I never come here," Colei says. "I'm just
here to help someone work out a problem and to
print something out. and then I'm going to go.
