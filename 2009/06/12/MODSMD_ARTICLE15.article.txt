()riginally published on December J, 2008
All across campus, screams inaugurate the
beginning of Dead Week. But within the thick
stone walls and Plexiglas windows that enclose
the first-floor lobby of Meyer Library, the only
sound heard is the quiet hum of the tluorescent
bulbs that permanently bathe the room in an un
naturally yellowish glow.
Wen ()i Chin "(W comes in through the en
trance that opens out toward l ast Campus, and
for a brief second, the muted screams from out
side are faint but audible.
A few people jerk their heads upward as the
door clatters to a close, but the rest do not both
er to look up from their textbooks or away from
iheir computers. Highlighters continue to scroll
rapidly across text. Fingers dart pointedly atop
keyboards. Pens scratch silently and unceasingly

at notepads.
Chin surveys the room,her eyes moving from
the scattered desks and half-couches on one side
to the mishmash of sofa chairs and Apple com
puters arranged on the other. She heads to her
left, pulls up a misplaced chair and rolls it toward
one of the many iMacs that line the wall.
"I don't usually come here," Chin insists.
"Only when I really need to get work done. But
I'm staying here today as long as it takes to fin
ish this History of Modern China paper."
She pauses.
"Well, an outline of it at least."
Time crawls forward, and barely anyone
moves from his or her seat. A few students enter
through one side of the library, shooting quiet
glances of curiosity or disgust at the museum ex
hibit of workers, walking past quickly and exit
ing through the other side.
Adrienne Gispen '11 finally breaks the si

lence, standing up and stretching before collect
ing the papers that she had spread so diligently
across the small desk where she had been work
ing.
"I still have some more work to do." she sighs.
"But it's really time for a change of scenery."
When it hits two in the morning, a sudden in
flux of people pushes their way in from the en
trance closest to Green Library.
Jae Jang *10 and Candice Kwark "12 come in
together, Jang grasping an AMP energy drink
and Kwark a stainless-steel coffee mug brim
ming with tea. Jang claims a small desk with the
AMP and signals to Kwark.
"We come here all the time." Jang admits.
"After a while, you start to notice the regulars.
And it does get lonely in here sometimes. So you
decide to sit together for support."
"I come here out of convenience, but this
place is pretty depressing." Kwark affirms. "Just

look at the walls!"
She gestures at the drab colors surrounding
her. the mottled brown and gray stone, a slightly
lighter shade of the same carpet pattern set
against the backdrop of windows blackened by
the dead of night.
First-year materials science grad student
John Colei recognizes his colleague Mark Jen
nings. a first-year grad student in civil engineer
ing. and they palm their hands together in greet
ing. Jennings laughs, cocking both of his index
fingers at his head and pulling his thumbs like
triggers as he sighs in exasperation and points at
his unfinished paper. Jennings inquires about
Colei. who is clearly not a regular.
"Oh. I never come here," Colei says. "I'm just
here to help someone work out a problem and to
print something out. and then I'm going to go.
Why are all the great places like
Green closed so early? How about
some incandescent lighting in here,
huh?"
"1 live here." Jennings sighs. "1
come here whenever Green closes. I
know I won't be able to get any work
done back in my dorm. 1 just play gui
tar or eat food or something. Here,
you have to focus. There's not much
to look at."

Colei heads to one of the Web St
ations. Jennings swivels his chair back
to work and the lobby begins to settle
down again.
Some students trickle in. circling
around the room and clasping their
books, looking for the best seat in the
house before deciding to settle into
the far corner of couches. Others
begin to pack their bags, yawning and
blinking back the sleep weighing
down their eyes.
By 4 a.m.. only eight or nine peo
ple remain.
Sam Fankuchen. a co-term stu
dent in sociology, is one of them, his
bottle of Vitamin Water near empty

and a Ziploc bag of mixed snacks, a
package his girlfriend so lovingly pre
pared. reduced to a few crumbs. He
gets up and rubs his hands rapidly to
gether to generate warmth, pacing
around the middle of the room to
clear his head.
"I've got a 10-page research paper
due tomorrow, and I haven't done
much of the research yet,"
Fankuchen says with i\ laugh. "There
aren't that many alternatives in terms
of places to study, and you have to be
considerate about being up late in
your dorm."
He shrugs.
"I've come to realize that in col

lege, work piles up every once in a
while."
Lethargy and frustration build as
the sky outside grows incrementally
brighter. Students push the bases of
their palms against their eyelids. Oth
ers put their heads down on desks or
lean back in their cushioned seats,
their hands still gripping their notes.
Joshua Chang '09 jerks awake
from his couch at 5:50 a.m.,checks his
watch and curses.
"Of course I didn't plan on falling
asleep here," he mutters."Why would
1 come to Meyer to sleep? Oh well.
Tomorrow is another chance to get
more work done here."

It's the week before finals, and all throughout Meyer Library, students are
typing, writing and cramming. Even in the dead of night, there's a life's
