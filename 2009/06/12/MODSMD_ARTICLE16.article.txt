## Steal this Column Roger and out, good buddies 
### 
I still remember vividly that mid-September
evening last summer in Berlin, and I likely will
for the rest of my life. I had just returned from
twoweeksin ITiailand.a transformational Buddhist
excursion led by my good friend, Fah Sathi
rapongsasuti It was back to Berlin for the final
day of my six months abroad there before flying
home, and I knew just what I would do with it.
Out I went into the city with a German friend of
mine, Daniel, to visit the ghosts of my past: to the
Weissensee Cemetery in the east of Berlin where I
bade adieu to the gravestones of my great-grand
parents. my great-aunt and my uncle; to the apart
ment buildings once occupied by various family
members; then finally, to the one place that meant
more to me than just about any other in that city: the
apartment that stood at Nassauische St. No. 61 in
West Berlin. It was the building in which my father's
parents, whom I never met, had lived together be
fore they were forced to flee Na/i persecution and
move to San Francisco, where my father was born.
Daniel and I met with a second friend. Nicolas,at
that apartment building. For a moment, the three of
us stood together in the courtyard, meditating. I'll
never forget it.
I had been listening to Neil Young a lot during
my time abroad. After a few minutes of silence, 1 fi
nally turned to face the open air and whispered to
the ghosts of my family. "Roger and out,good bud
dies. I feel you in the air today." And with that. I
walked out the way I had come in. leaving their spir
its behind for the year to come.
Now. the song is playing in my head again.
A few weeks ago. I wrote that the moment when
our thousands of parallel roads would split would
soon be coming. Now. the moment is here. And the

difference between "soon" and "now" is immeasur
able. All of our college experiences will have hap
pened there, not here. All those people with whom
we shared those experiences will be cities,countries,
continents (or at least Facebook pokes) away, not
minutes. C ollege. for the graduating class, is soon to
become nothing more than a series of memories
past.
'ITie memories are to become distant in both
space and time. We will meet new people, and cre
ate new and lasting moments, but there will in
evitably be those twinkles of nostalgia in which the
tiniest sensory stimulation will bring an onrush of
memories we once held dear, memories we thought
we had forgotten, about something that happened
on this little Farm. Perhaps for some of us in the
coming years, there will be someone nearby with
whom we can share that moment, and say. "Re
member that?" and they will smile, and nod. But for
many of us. it might happen that no one nearby will
quite be able to understand just what it means to us.
the people who saw it, breathed it. lived it .Though I
am fortunate that my plans to go to Israel this com
ing year will reunite me with many old and dear
friends, reminiscing about Stanford will likely place
me in the latter group.
Iliis community of the brightest, finest people I
have ever met in this country is about to be dis
solved. It is inevitable, and the only thing left to do
is accept it. to find closure in it and to find the mo
ment inside of myself when the transformation
from "sad to see it go" to "happy and in awe that it
even happened at all"can he completed.
To Stanford University, 1 have been critical of
you in the past, both in this column and elsewhere.
But I say to you today, thank you. thank you. thank

you. Thank you for coming as close as I could ever
imagine to achieving the goal of a shining beacon of
educational inspiration, of a Californified paradise
on earth. Thank you for instilling in us that educa
tion in itself is a worthy end. that the only thing in
this world of greater value than to learn to make
one's self better is to teach others to do the same.
'ITtank you for stirring in us the drive to strive for
greatness. Above and beyond anything and every
thing you have given to me, thank you for this com
munity. Iliank you for these people.Thank you for
giving us each other, even if we were just on a four
year loan.
As the pangs of nostalgia begin to set in beneath
my chest, in the end I can take solace in one final
thought: Before I left my grandparents' apartment
that September evening. I made a promise to their
memories that I would come hack. This summer. I
am planning to do exactly that. When I step foot
back in Nassauische St. No. 61.1 will be returning to
family.
I'd like to think that the next time I see you
again.you will be, too.
Roger and out, good buddies. It's been a hell of a
ride. And after we've all gone our separate ways,
you can bet I ll still feel you in the air.

A heartfelt "thank you"goes to Smart liaimel for his
tolerance of my inanity and to Stephanie Werner for
giving me the incredible gift of this column. / owe you
much, mrdonigliistanford.edu.
