# Crime and Punishment
## Oh dear, my actions are showing 
### 
The good news is that the U.S. is moving dem
ocratically toward energy and climate policy
in a way that involves input by all stakehold
ers.
The less-good news is that I'm pretty sure most
of the decision makers have very little idea that they
are making these policies.
Perhaps including you.
Energy supply, which has a lot to do with climate
policy, is mercilessly dependent on time. Not only
that, but it's mercilessly dependent on the kind of
time that does not neatly coincide with political cy
cles. I"his means that the things we do as a country
and as individuals lock us into certain groups of fu
ture choice possibilities, essentially defining our po
tential energy and climate futures.
What, then,are the time constraints? Most obvi
ously, supply must match demand at a given time.
The one that gets overlooked a lot is that infrastruc
ture must be able to support demand at a given
time. Oil fields with producing wells. Transmission
lines with enough capacity and appropriate loca
tions. People with academic training and experi
ence in a field.
Looking at oil. which in the United States is used
almost exclusively for transportation, it's some
times easy to forget that the big oil companies
everyone loves to hate would not be in business if
there weren't a market for oil (and for perspective:
90 percent of global proved reserves are controlled
by government-owned oil companies,so companies
like Exxon are actually pretty small in the scheme
of things). C )ur demand drives their decision to sup
ply. which is true however you feel about the good
ness. badness, or feasibility of demanding less oil.
Here's a really interesting way that we're defin
ing our energy and climate policy — in the I J.S.. at
least, we keep demanding oil (and other energy) at

the same time as we vilify it. On the ground, this
translates to a strong national sentiment against
American offshore drilling, for example. As I've
said in this space before, continuing to demand
while refusing to supply means we're exporting en
vironmental devastation to places that are less
equipped to handle it than we are — but it also
means that if we do want or need to turn to Ameri
can sources in the future, we will be unable to do so
because the exploration and infrastructure will not
have taken place. Developing fields takes decades
what with permitting, background work, and ac
tually drilling, an oil field is definitely not the easy
access bathtub with a faucet on it that many people
picture.
Even more fundamentally, and closer to home
for many of us. let me ask you this: how many petro
leum engineers in-training do you know at Stan
ford?
Right. (onsidering that Stanford had a very
well-respected undergraduate Petroleum Engi
neering program not long ago. it's surprising how
few people will even whisper about an interest in
working as a petroleum engineer or petroleum ge
ologist around here.This trend away from such pro
fessions is not universal, but recent anti-oil senti
ment among students has contributed to a notice
able American shortage of people able to find and
extract the oil we might decide to go after at some
point.
With electricity, which basically can't be stored,
someone must be controlling the supply, the de
mand, or both to make sure that there's electricity
everywhere it needs to be and that there is very lit
tle excess generation that gets wasted. What we do
now is turn power plants on and off to make sure we
meet demand what is called load-following gen
eration but we could control loads, too. bv creat

ing bundles of generation-following load.
Because we don't do that, right now our policy is
to build enough generation to meet peak demands.
This means there's a lot of very expensive infra
structure that gets built to wait around — which is
fine, but it's a choice, not a system characteristic. Il
also means that the power plants we aren't build
now due to siting concerns, etc. won't be available to
run our peak loads in ten years. We're locking our
selves out of business-as usual.
linergy is a long-cycle problem. By choosing to
put off building new power plants, develop new oil
fields, and to specialize in fields other than tradi
tional energy extraction at the same time as energy
demand continues to grow, we are defining an ener
gy and climate policy for the future in a much more
definitive way than the political process ever could.
We seem to be defining a policy that requires high
er efficiency and new energy sources, which is great
but we had better make sure that we realize
that's what we're doing before we get caught with a
bunch of broken power plants, depleted fields, and
rotting transmission posts. What we choose now will
heavily influence how this country is forced to deal
with energy and climate in the future no matter
what our laws say.
