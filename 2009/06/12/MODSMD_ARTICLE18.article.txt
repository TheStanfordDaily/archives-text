# Pith and Pleonasm
## Fathers' Day 
### 
Willi no clue how I'd spend my
hist column, I went back and
looked at ideas I 'd provided
in my original columnist application
(we had to propose 10-15), and I im
mediately noticed that almost every
column I'd proposed to write was neg
ative — a criticism of this, an ironic or
sarcastic take on that. It's so easy in a
job like this ( hi ist. it's so easy in life
to fall into that insidious trap of
aloof intellectual detachment, of
being too good or too smart for every
thing, to focus only on the negatives of
what others are doing instead of being
interesting or cmpathetic and seeking
out the positives.
I realized that if this is the last col
umn I ever write, there's no way it
needed to be another asinine, sardon
ic diatribe — there have been enough
holier-than-thou quasi -humor
columns in here this year to drive a
campus paper into bankruptcy. If I
only got one more column, it should
be the most positive thing I've ever
written and about the most positive
man I've ever known, the man who
serves as the only reason I'm at this
school with the chance to write silly
columns in the first place.
Hie only person on the planet who
wanted me to get into Stanford more
than I did was my dad. I was eight
when he came to campus on a business
trip and called home beaming about
everything around him — the palm
trees, the Spanish buildings, the sin
dents actually discussing academic
topics. My dad had always dreamed of
going to a school like Stanford.and de
served to go to one. too. but as the
fourth of seven in a very working-class
('hicago family, he could only afford to
attend an in-state public school: even
that, though, required 50-hour work
weeks during the summer, factors
labor weekdays and anything lie c< >uld
find on the weekends.
I rom there he worked for a series
of computer companies that were
each in turn bought up and consumed
by still larger companies, until finally
lie ended up at Hewlett-Packard
(ironic, right? lie loved the Stanford
connection). Mv dad worked the kind
of bleak and mundane "Office
Space"-type job that could only be tol
erable if you loved your family way
more than yourself. I le spent 30 years
at a job lightyears below his intellect u
al capabilities just so he could save up
the money it would take to send me to
the college of his dreams, and lie
turned down promotion after promo
tion to keep me and my mom in ( liiea
go,surrounded by friends and family.
I can say with absolute certainty
that he would have exploded with
pride at graduation. In one single
morning I think I'll have vindicated
everything he ever did - all the sum
mers wishing he could go out with
friends but instead picking up night
shifts, all the pointless bureaucratic
meetings, nil the times he felt like
nothing more than a number at his
job: none ol it would have mattered
anymore because he'd see me gradu
ate from here. It would have made him
happy in a way I don't think I ever got
to see while he was around.
All this, though. I can still only

speculate, because my dad died of a
heart attack a month before I left for
college. I'm ;m only child, so leaving
for school meant leaving my mom
alone in a house that had been filled
with the constant sounds of family lor
the past IS years. After agonizing over
it for weeks, we decided I would still
go,since that was my dad's dream,and
nothing would have pissed the old
man off more than knowing I'd let his
death get in the way of the only thing
he'd ever really wanted lor me.
I our years later. I am still only be
ginning to understand what hap
pened. I've thought a lot lately about
what he'd say on June 14. what he'd
wear, how he'd look standing with all
my friends' fathers as they watched
their sons and daughters get degrees.
(iraduation can be terrifying, and in a
way it's like coming to terms with any
other great loss the loss of youth,
the uncertainty ol the future, the con
sideration and reconsideration of
whether we did every last thing we
could while we were together, if we
made the most of what we're always
told are the best years of our lives that
are now being left behind us.
Reflecting on losing Stanford, on
losing this part of my life. I keep com
ing back to the relationship I've built
with my dad in the four years since
lie's died. In college, I've still always
had two parents my mother the
vocal and my father the silent. It's not
that I necessarily believe lie's some
where watching out for me (although
that really would be great), it's that
I've learned so many things from his
absence, from his silence. My father
the silent taught me what it means to
be selfless and compassionate only
after experiencing the almost bound
less opportunities we take for granted
here have I realized how much he
truly gave up to make sure this all hap
pencil for me. My lather the silent
taught me what it means to be proud
ot who you are never, as long as I
knew him.did lie ever criticize his own
upbiinging 01 talk about how hard
things were for him, though I know
now that at times his teenage and col
lege years must have been a night
mare. My lather the silent taught me
what it means to be brave not
pulling a family from a burning build
ing or charging the enemy front line
brave, but everyday brave.
I"he pride associated with being an
"everyday American"gets wrapped in
so many layers ot Palin-esque bullshit
these days that we lorget how much
courage real life sometimes actually
takes: how much courage it takes togo

to give up your own time to do some
thing for your kills, to eare for a living

Gillespie
alized what a dynamic and coura
geous man my dad was. and similarly
1 think I'll be learning repeatedly
from Stanford — the ideas of collab
orative learning and discovery, the
emphasis on public service and giving
back, the basic push to just be a good
human being and always make the
compassionate decision — for years
and years after graduation.
You can learn a lot from memo
ries. It's not just a stagnant represen
tation of the people you've met or the
places you've been, but a living

even if it means that 50 years from
now I'm still remembering and tear
ing up over how my dad sounded on
the phone when I was eight, barely
able to contain his excitement and
telling me he'd just spent the day at
the best place on earth.
Of course. I could go on about this
forever, but. like college, it's all got to
end somewhere.

find on the weekends.
I rom there he worked for a series
of computer companies that were
each in turn bought up and consumed
by still larger companies, until finally
lie ended up at Hewlett-Packard
(ironic, right? lie loved the Stanford
connection). Mv dad worked the kind
of bleak and mundane "Office
Space"-type job that could only be tol
erable if you loved your family way
more than yourself. I le spent 30 years
at a job lightyears below his intellect u
al capabilities just so he could save up
the money it would take to send me to
the college of his dreams, and lie
turned down promotion after promo
tion to keep me and my mom in ( liiea
go,surrounded by friends and family.
I can say with absolute certainty
that he would have exploded with
pride at graduation. In one single
morning I think I'll have vindicated
everything he ever did - all the sum
mers wishing he could go out with
friends but instead picking up night
shifts, all the pointless bureaucratic
meetings, nil the times he felt like
nothing more than a number at his
job: none ol it would have mattered
anymore because he'd see me gradu
ate from here. It would have made him
happy in a way I don't think I ever got
to see while he was around.
All this, though. I can still only

speculate, because my dad died of a
heart attack a month before I left for
college. I'm ;m only child, so leaving
for school meant leaving my mom
alone in a house that had been filled
with the constant sounds of family lor
the past IS years. After agonizing over
it for weeks, we decided I would still
go,since that was my dad's dream,and
nothing would have pissed the old
man off more than knowing I'd let his
death get in the way of the only thing
he'd ever really wanted lor me.
I our years later. I am still only be
ginning to understand what hap
pened. I've thought a lot lately about
what he'd say on June 14. what he'd
wear, how he'd look standing with all
my friends' fathers as they watched
their sons and daughters get degrees.
(iraduation can be terrifying, and in a
way it's like coming to terms with any
other great loss the loss of youth,
the uncertainty ol the future, the con
sideration and reconsideration of
whether we did every last thing we
could while we were together, if we
made the most of what we're always
told are the best years of our lives that
are now being left behind us.
Reflecting on losing Stanford, on
losing this part of my life. I keep com
ing back to the relationship I've built
with my dad in the four years since
lie's died. In college, I've still always
had two parents my mother the
vocal and my father the silent. It's not
that I necessarily believe lie's some
where watching out for me (although
that really would be great), it's that
I've learned so many things from his
absence, from his silence. My father
the silent taught me what it means to
be selfless and compassionate only
after experiencing the almost bound
less opportunities we take for granted
here have I realized how much he
truly gave up to make sure this all hap
pencil for me. My lather the silent
taught me what it means to be proud
ot who you are never, as long as I
knew him.did lie ever criticize his own
upbiinging 01 talk about how hard
things were for him, though I know
now that at times his teenage and col
lege years must have been a night
mare. My lather the silent taught me
what it means to be brave not
pulling a family from a burning build
ing or charging the enemy front line
brave, but everyday brave.
I"he pride associated with being an
"everyday American"gets wrapped in
so many layers ot Palin-esque bullshit
these days that we lorget how much
courage real life sometimes actually
takes: how much courage it takes togo
to the dry cleaners after a 12-hour day,
to give up your own time to do some
thing for your kills, to eare for a living
relative. ()nly after his death have Ire

alized what a dynamic and coura
geous man my dad was. and similarly
1 think I'll be learning repeatedly
from Stanford — the ideas of collab
orative learning and discovery, the
emphasis on public service and giving
back, the basic push to just be a good
human being and always make the
compassionate decision — for years
and years after graduation.
You can learn a lot from memo
ries. It's not just a stagnant represen
tation of the people you've met or the
places you've been, but a living
breathing viable thing that can con
tinue to inform and shape the future,
even if it means that 50 years from
now I'm still remembering and tear
ing up over how my dad sounded on
the phone when I was eight, barely
able to contain his excitement and
telling me he'd just spent the day at
the best place on earth.
Of course. I could go on about this
forever, but. like college, it's all got to
end somewhere.
