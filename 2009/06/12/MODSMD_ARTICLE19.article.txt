The great ideal of the academy is
whereby diametrically opposed and
contrarian beliefs can cross swords
and do battle for the betterment of the stu
dent body and humanity at large. Stanford,
not unlike other premier educational insti
tutions. markets itself as a repository of di
verse and dynamic ideas of how to compre
hend the world in which we reside. Besides
exalted quality of life and dreams of im
mense wealth and luxury, the central draw
of the school is its supposed intellectual vi
tality. "To be ignorant of one's ignorance is
the malady of the ignorant." which I believe
speaks to the importance of a solid liberal
education, though this could be the official
slogan of the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
Stanford University, or at least how I
took down the Kool-aid. is meant to be wel
coming and receptive to AM. ideologies
and creeds. I lowever. this does not seem to
be the case here at the Stan. Last year's
presidential election exemplifies the issue
to a tee. In the name of full discretion. I am
a proud, lifelong l)em. I heard then-Sena
tor Obama speak two years, and left the
room truly in awe of the man who seemed
uniquely equipped to lead the nation.
Yet after arriving on campus last year, I
was somewhat appalled of the outright
toxic environment spewing forth from the
primaries. The energy I felt after hearing
the Senator had been perverted by a variety

of Obama-nistas into this smug self right
eousness that brutally attacked anyone
who stood against them. II it was not for the
fact that I couldn't stand Howard Wolfson
and some the crap coming out of the ( lin
ton campaign. I would have seriously sup
ported I lillarv.il for no other reason than to
go against what came across as a cult-like
atmosphere that pervaded the campus.
Hie general election was slightly less
worse, but not by much. I recall a frosh try
ing to argue in the I all Quarter, one-unit
CSRF, sponsored "Presidential Politics"
class that llU( supporters were more likely
to be racist, whereby I excoriated the chap
for a solid few minutes. And while I derisive
ly mocked (iovernor Sarah Palin because I
legitimately believe her to be an idiot. I still
held a degree of sympathy for actual Mc-
Cain voters, whose active support for their
candidate was akin to large-scale public sui
cide. With the Hoover Institute. Condi, an

rable marriage to the Silicon Vallev entre-

Such behavior, however, goes far

dential election. I have a variety of
incredibly intelligent, well-rea
soned and articulate friends who
happen to be more moderate, or
*gasp*. conservative than your av

speaking, only in small gatherings or
private discussions do such students
actually feel comfortable in ex
pressing their beliefs. The Stanford
Review seems to occasionally pick
absurdist and highly contentious
fights simply for the hell of it. but
the greater campus populace sum
marily dismisses their views, regard
less of their persuasiveness or merit.
Issues regarding the emphases

placed on sustainability and varying
conceptions of diversity seem to be
the third-rails of campus life; dare to
even foster a healthy discussion, and
the responses are often less than

even being thrown about in the pub
lic square, besides increasing the
tyranny of the majority, breeds in
tellectual stasis. I did not come to
Stanford to exalt in some plush
vaguely liberal echo chamber, to
wallow in holier-than-thou con
tempt for those whose top priorities
aren't in lock step with the residents
of Palo Alto.

right to choose, same-sex marriage
as a civil rights issue, and public ed

all Americans. However, this cam
pus needs to foster lively discus

focus is not on demonization, but
rather on civil discourse with a po
tential of establishing intellectual
common ground.
What are we afraid of. folks? That
the beliefs we steadfastly cling to
might not hold up in the face of rea
sonable opposition? That those who
might not agree fully with our beliefs
are racist, anti-environment, or just
lesser human beings? At an institu

tion like Stanford, if we cannot be
open to the ideas or beliefs of others,
if we cannot learn from the varied
experiences of those around us. then
we are damned to shape a world that
demands orthodoxy, devalues mi
nority opinions and rejects intellec
tual diversity. In short, civilization as
we know it will become one big USC.
