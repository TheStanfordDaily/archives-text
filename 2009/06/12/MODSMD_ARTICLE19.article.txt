The great ideal of the academy is
whereby diametrically opposed and
contrarian beliefs can cross swords
and do battle for the betterment of the stu
dent body and humanity at large. Stanford,
not unlike other premier educational insti
tutions. markets itself as a repository of di
verse and dynamic ideas of how to compre
hend the world in which we reside. Besides
exalted quality of life and dreams of im
mense wealth and luxury, the central draw
of the school is its supposed intellectual vi
tality. "To be ignorant of one's ignorance is
the malady of the ignorant." which I believe
speaks to the importance of a solid liberal
education, though this could be the official
slogan of the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
Stanford University, or at least how I
took down the Kool-aid. is meant to be wel
coming and receptive to AM. ideologies
and creeds. I lowever. this does not seem to
be the case here at the Stan. Last year's
presidential election exemplifies the issue
to a tee. In the name of full discretion. I am
a proud, lifelong l)em. I heard then-Sena
tor Obama speak two years, and left the
room truly in awe of the man who seemed
uniquely equipped to lead the nation.
Yet after arriving on campus last year, I
was somewhat appalled of the outright
toxic environment spewing forth from the
primaries. The energy I felt after hearing
the Senator had been perverted by a variety

of Obama-nistas into this smug self right
eousness that brutally attacked anyone
who stood against them. II it was not for the
fact that I couldn't stand Howard Wolfson
and some the crap coming out of the ( lin
ton campaign. I would have seriously sup
ported I lillarv.il for no other reason than to
go against what came across as a cult-like
atmosphere that pervaded the campus.
Hie general election was slightly less
worse, but not by much. I recall a frosh try
ing to argue in the I all Quarter, one-unit
CSRF, sponsored "Presidential Politics"
class that llU( supporters were more likely
to be racist, whereby I excoriated the chap
for a solid few minutes. And while I derisive
ly mocked (iovernor Sarah Palin because I
legitimately believe her to be an idiot. I still
held a degree of sympathy for actual Mc-
Cain voters, whose active support for their
candidate was akin to large-scale public sui
cide. With the Hoover Institute. Condi, an
incredible ccon department and an insepa
rable marriage to the Silicon Vallev entre-
