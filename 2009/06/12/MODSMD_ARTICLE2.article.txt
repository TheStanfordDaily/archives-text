ITie $7()-million campaign to overturn
California's Proposition 8 quickly lost trac
tion Tuesday night as poll results showed
California voters leaning toward overturn
ing same-sex marriage in the state. As of
press time, 52 percent of voters favored pas
sage of the proposition, with 89 percent of
precincts reporting.
During the weeks leading up to Tues
day's election, much of the Stanford com
munity lashed out against Prop. 8. If passed,
the proposition would amend the Golden
State's Constitution to "eliminate the right
of same-sex couples to marry in California."

"It's such an unjust, immoral proposition
that threatens to take away people's rights
and the love that people share," said Aman
da Gelender '10, founder of the Stanford
Theatre Activist Mobilization Project
(STAMP). "I'm disgusted by the propo
nents of this initiative, and I felt propelled to
do something."
Both gay and straight members of the
community gathered at the LGBT Commu
nity Resource Center on Tuesday night to
watch the election returns.
"It's great to get people together," said
fourth-year medical student Mitch I unn.
"especially when people share the same in
terests and beliefs on issues."
"Students are really focused on being here,"
Gelender added."We're kind of sharing this
really intimate moment together."

Many students were anxious throughout
the day, unsure of what to anticipate when
early results began rolling in during the
evening hours.
"1 have never been so afraid," said Greg,
an anti-Prop. 8 organizer who asked to keep
his last name confidential for privacy rea
sons. "This is too much."
"I've been nervous all day," added A-lan
I lolt '11 on Tuesday evening. "California is
split for Prop. 8, so I'm nervous but also
hopeful."
Several students cried while watching
the returns.Gelender noted.
On the other side of the fence stood
many supporters of Prop. 8. including Mike
Hailey.a Ph. D.candidate in economics. Hai-
Icy onl\ supports marriage between a man
and a woman, because he believes marriage

is an institution meant to nurture natural
children.
"Marriage is a societal institution that
teaches people what they need to do to raise
children in the world." he said. "I fear that
the consequences down the line are people
seeing marriage as a way to get personal
happiness — and they lose sight about the
kids. Marriage is fundamentally about the
children it creates."
Stanford faculty members also weighed
in on the issue, many of whom signed an on
line petition against Prop. 8 that began cir
culating on Oct. 28.
Larry Diamond, petition signatory and
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,
called it "particularly disturbing" that an ini
tiative — Prop. 8 — aimed to reverse a deci
sion by the California Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court approved same-sex
marriage in a ruling on May 15 of this year.
"Gays should have the right to marry, to
have their union fully recognized by the
state." Diamond told TTie Daily earlier this
week.
Bailey noted that his differences with op
ponents of Prop. 8 are not personal, but stem
simply from a different definition of mar
riage.
"All ol us on the 'yes* side have gay
friends and family whom we love." he said.
"Even if it does pass. I'm not going to be
happy because I know how much pain my
gay friends will suffer. It will be bitter
sweet."
