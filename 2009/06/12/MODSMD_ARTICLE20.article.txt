# Too Big to Fail
## Five, Seven, Five 
### 
Sometimes, less is more. I have no idea
when these times are. hut this is what I
hear.
As I prepared to write my very hist Daily
column ever. I realized that I could never sum
up my Stanford experience in less than N(M)
words — so. naturally, I decided to write some
haikus.
I lere goes nothing:
Sunday afternoon
Meant to read, then chanced upon
Disney-themcd bounce house.
Was at R.B.F.
A strange turn of events, then:
Delicious J.Bo.
Poor innocent child.
Big (iame is no excuse for
(iolden Bear onesie.
Whirring I ires, breaks screech.
Your S.A.T. score was what?
Yet you still can't bike.
November the fourth
Maison starts Main Ouad bonfire
Makes police blotter.

I .ach week,some stranger
Rates my column online:"poor."
I'm strangely turned on.
Why hello. Phi Psi —
Yes. tis I across the street.
"('lose the blinds?" MAKI\ MR.
Mark! Distant chaos
Throw on your glitter spandcx
The Band approaches!

Requires live walrus.
"Please no aerials"
Reads Viennese Ball invite.

Streetlights, people. A;ih.
My fu//y major:
"Schematize" is so a word.
As is "unemployed."

I .arge tomes, mixed with dance parties
And Mario Karl.
Okay, time for bed
Night. roomies! Wait, he said what'.'??

With knowledge, fond memories.
