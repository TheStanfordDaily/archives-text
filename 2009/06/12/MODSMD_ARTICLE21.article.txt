# The Voice of Experience
## Take heart, undergraduates 
### 
The scary thing about returning to grad
school at age 33 is that you wind up
hanging out with folks who were
being born while you were sitting in the hall
way of your middle school, listening to your
metal-head friends brag about going to the
Skid Row concert that night.
There are some advantages, though, in
the form of hard-won knowledge that can
only be gained through a long, sometimes
brutal, sometimes illuminating slog through
the real world.
In the 10 years between college and re
turning to grad school. I have worked in the
pits dI a trading floor, run a software startup,
slaved in a cubicle for the world's second
largest software company,taught math at an
urban high school and watched friends go
through similar journeys and transforma
tions.
I don't pretend to know everything, or
even a lot. But I know a few things, and I
thought I'd use my first column or two to
share some of these tidbits with the under
graduates and younger grad students here at
Stanford. After all. dear reader, you may
havethe world at your feet,but unless you're
careful, the world may bite sharply at your
ankles.
You will find a job
I his downturn is bad. I remember the
dot-com crash, and this is worse. I had just
moved out to the Bay Area in 2001 to work
;is ;i programmer at Oracle, and the whole
region was emptying out as fast as IJ-llaul
could provide trucks. My commute on the
101 dropped from 40 minutes to a half hour
as traffic thinned out from winter to summer
of that year. My rent dropped 40 percent six
months later.
But a funny thing happened — while

pets.com's promise of an online pet food
Utopia did not materialize, the quieter, more
fundamental efficiency gains promised by
the Internet did. The tech sector recovered
nicely.
This downtown is deeper and more wide
spread. But first, take some heart in that, ac
cording to a recent article published on
Bloomberg.com,the unemployment rate for
those with college degrees is 3.8 percent —
half the national average. And don't forget
that our society is still producing knowledge
at a dizzying rate. Biotechnology, nanotech,
energy technology, etc. will all lead to new
products and industries that will continue to
drive economic growth.
Asa smart Stanford graduate.you will be
able to find a job — some job at least, until
things get better. It may not be in your ideal
area, or pay as much as you like, but you will
not only survive but also prosper.
All young human beings possess a
"squalor" gene that allows you to exist, hap
pily, on Ramen noodles in an apartment you
share with six other friends and someone's
23-foot pet reticulated python. This gene is
fully active through your mid-2()s, after
which it slowly goes dormant and is sub
sumed by the "nesting" gene, which compels
you to buy stuff at Crate and Barrel.
It's OK that there are no more investment
hanking jobs, because you didn't want one
anyway
As an undergrad at a fancy East Coast
college, my friends and I used to make fun of
a certain type of student. This student was an
(almost always) male, hyper-aggressive and
socially awkward type who couldn't wait to
graduate, put on a suit and go work on Wall
Street.
Hie sense I not was that thev somehow

feel that working in a high-paying prestige
job would make them cool, and that they
would wind up hanging out at 2 a.m. in New
York's hottest clubs, surrounded by fashion
models.
The truth was they wound up at 2 a.m. in
their cubes, surrounded only by each other.
Investment banking, which I witnessed
through the eyes of several friends (not the
suit-types above, mind you, just misguided),
is the most soul-draining work I have ever
seen. Highty- to hundred-hour weeks, year
after year, literally rob you of your youth.
And yet so many recent college grads get
sucked in, because the recruiting process
channels you there. All of my friends left the
industry after their two-year analyst posi
tions ended. One is now pursuing her pas
sion in the movie business; another went to
cooking school.
Now. I'm not saying no one should ever
go into investment banking. And there are
certainly good, decent people in the field. If
you really love the work — finance, deal
making, etc. — it may be right for you. And
many bankers pay their dues, and then use
their substantial wealth to reinvent them
selves.
For example. New Jersey governor John
Corzine worked at Goldman for almost 30
years, took the company public, made $400
million and went on to a (presumably fulfill
ing) career in politics. My point is: Know
what you're getting into and choose your ca
reer for the right reasons — because you
love it and want to contribute to the field.
