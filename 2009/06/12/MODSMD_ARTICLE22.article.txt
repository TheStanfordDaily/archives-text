# Mark My Words
## The
						end of the beginning 
### 
As I sat down to write this column. 1
found myself honored and terrified. I
felt honored that I am allowed to write
this column and terrified that I've come far
enough in my college career to be able to write
it.
I'll save the jaded waxing of a graduating
senior and just try to pass along five pieces of
advice that I would give myself if I were start
ing this wonderful experience all over again.
1. Start something
Stanford is amazing and unique in the un
fathomable amount of resources it puts in
your hands.
Don't let those resources go to waste!
Whether it's an honors thesis, a volunteer
project to help your community, a start-up or
a publication, do something!
Run for ASSU Senate! Run for Tree! Start
an activism campaign!
So many people simply go through the ac
ademic motions during their Stanford careers
that when graduation day comes they find
themselves wondering where all the time
went and what special something will they
have to remember their time by.
Don't find yourself wishing you had tried
something when you had the opportunity —
do it now while you have the money and legit
imacy of a top tier university supporting you.
2. Study abroad
Enough Stanford students do this that it
seems like it should go without saying, but this
message is for those who think they will be
"too busy" to travel abroad.
Here's a free piece of advice: you have the
rest of your life to be "too busy." Powerful ca
reers, six digit mortgages (and grad school
debt) and 1.5 kids will be plenty to keep you
busy in the decades to come — take the op
portunity now to travel and study abroad.
Stanford is fortunate in that the generosity
of the Bings seems to know no bounds. Every
program is fantastic, and with new ones open
ing seemingly every year there is no shortage
of options for where to go.
Grab your friends, fill out an app and go
travel the world while you're still only moder
ately responsible.
3. Speak up in class!
The "IHUM kid" stereotype is probably
the single-most academically damaging fea
ture of undergraduate life at Stanford. The
thought that it's "cool" to look like you don't
know or didn't do the reading is far and away
one of the stupidest things I've ever heard.
For those of you who haven't had the
chance to interact with a professor or a TA.try
it sometime. Don't just pipe up to kiss ass in a
lecture and repeat what was just said — chal
lenge your teachers.
Most (though I caution you.not all) profes
sors andTAs enjoy being prodded on their ar
guments and are often happy to parlay back
and forth lor a little bit.
If you haven't looked at your hill recently,
crunch a few numbers. You'll find that your
classes cost you roughly $3,000 a pop. At that
price, I would hope that it's worth trying to get
a little more out of it than looking like you
don't give a damn.
4. Get to know a professor
On that note, you should go out of your
way to get to know a professor at your earliest

opportunity. Not only will they serve as good
advisors and letter writers down the road,
you'll actually find that most of them are pret
ty interesting people too.
One doesn't just accidently come to Stan
ford — any professor here has demonstrated
his or her ability to be one of the absolute best
in their field.lbis, coupled with their accessi
bility. creates a once-in-a-lifetime environ
ment to become personal friends with one of
the world's elite scholars.
There's a reason that one of the speeches
during NSO stresses the importance of getting
to know professors— most people never do
it!
Interacting with faculty and getting to hear
their stories, experiences and personal re
search is both fascinating and helpful — espe
cially for those looking for direction.
5. (live back
Despite the personal satisfaction of all of
your work paying off and landing you at one
of the best schools in the world, don't forget
where you came from.
Don't forget your community, your state,
your region or your country.
As a Stanford graduate and even as a Stan
ford student, people will look to you for lead
ership. direction and guidance. Take the op
portunity to give something positive back be
fore making a move to a Wall Street job or a
multi-million surgical practice.
Find some kids to tutor, jump start a ven
ture geared to help those less fortunate, travel
abroad and deliver medical and educational
services to third world countries, or find a
place in government.
I'm not suggesting you sign up for the niili
tary (though my greatest gratitude and re
spect goes out to those among us who have) or
that you commit a lifetime to public service.
While these would be nice ideals. 1 feel every
one should have the joy of pursuing that which
they enjov most.
All I ask is that before you do. you try to
give a little back to those who have helped you
along the way and to those who may not have
had the opportunities you were so fortunate
to grow up with. Your guiding hand, hard work
and honest compassion will be remembered
for years to come and you will have the satis
faction of knowing that you left the world just
that much better than you found it.
Freshman, sophomores this is geared
especially toward you. Come junior year, what
you do during the summer is going to start to
count big for your careers, especially those in
terested in the financial section. Your first two
summers aren't worth a damn — take the
chance to do some volunteer work while
you're still free to do so!
With that. I wanted to thank all of m\
