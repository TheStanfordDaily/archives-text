# Too Big To Fail
## Dear President Hennessy 
### 
Dear President Hennessy,
I" n these troubling economic times, I know
you are lacing many hard, unpopular de
cisions about which departments and
programs you can "give the axe." ((»et it? It's
like what we say during — eh. never mind.)
Well. I recently had to choose between buy
ing an external hard drive or some DVDs I
wanted, so I can relate to the tough choices
that lie ahead for you.
Now. I know what you're wondering:
Who is this ruggedly handsome kid spewing
such sage, helpful advice? Fair, though the
fact that you don't remember me is a little
hurtful, because we met on frosh move-in
day last year. I was dressed like a clown, and
you were dressed like a guy in a suit. We
shook hands, and it was one of the highlights
of my life.
But don't worry - I don't hold your for
get fulness against vou. In fact. I am so not

grudging that I am giving you a lot of solu
tions for solving the budget crisis, which 1 am
even prepared to let you take credit for.
Now. if I were you, the first thing I would
excise would be Stanford Dining. This is
nothing personal - Dining is made up of a
lot of dedicated, hard-working people who
try their best to give us the food we need to
be not hungry. However, Stanford Dining is
not In-N ()ut. and this is a fault I have yet to
forgive them for.

I would also ax the guys who direct bicy
cle traffic around the roundabouts. If fresh
men can't get into accidents at the former In
tersection of Death, how will they learn that
it's bad to get into bike accidents? These are
the kinds of questions that haunt me when I
am trying to sleep.
Additionally, I'd gel rid of any depart
ment that does things that I do not under
stand. on the basis that people in those de
partments are always using words that they
might be making up and, worse, that they
rarely discuss the television show "The Of
fice."
Examples of these departments include
astrophysics, regular physics, astrobiology,
astrology, gastronomy, metallurgy, witch
craft and any department that routinely uses
the phrase "postmodern" in a non-ironic
sense.

I'd also cut Otero. In addition to
harboring terrorists and transients.
Otero is an eyesore that I'm sure is
decreasing the property values of
the general Wilbur area. I advise
knocking it down immediately, and
when your crews are done, you can
direct them to Branner. I estimate
that this will save the school no less
than 73 million dollars.
Finally. I'd get rid of this cold
weather. "What are you talking
about?" you might ask. Come off it,
Hennessy. We both know that
weather that routinely dips below
40 has no place in California. Save
your horribly expensive weather
changing experiments for a lesser
state, like Nebraska, or lowa, or
Vermont, or Texas or any other
state in the Union, really. I'm tired
of wearing so many layers.
But. if I may be frank with you,
sir. we don't have to cut corners to
thrive in these tough times. Look at
the examples of I DR. Reagan and
future Obama — if we spend more
money than we have, it'll pour re
sources into the economy, thereby
creating jobs, products and free
money that we're only kind of tak
ing away from our children. Much
of this money could come back to
us via processes that my economist
friends assure me are real.
On a less technical note. I can
promise you that spending money
is much more fun than not spend
ing it. Do you really want to be the
president who oversaw cutting the
anthropology budget by five per

cent? Why not be the president
who oversaw building a giant ice
skating rink under Meyer?
And that's only the tip of the
iceberg (if English gets cut, we will
all have to use more cliches to save
money on original expressions).
You could turn Lake Lag into an
imitation savannah, complete with
elephants, giraffes and man-eating
lions. You could build a rollercoast
er around Hoover Tower, or you
could buy each dorm a fighter jet.
You could even construct a
giant laser to do science for us. If
we build one big enough. I estimate
that we'll be able to produce at
least 15 percent more science than
we currently do. That's a lot of sci
ence.
Better yet, you could invest in
investing itself. I offer a small con
sulting service, and while my fees
have been called blindingly high. I
can promise you that 1 will main
tain the high quality of advice you
have already seen in this letter/ar
ticle.
I sincerely hope you will consid
er these possibilities. Mr. Presi
dent. As a student and a highly ef
fective consultant, I consider my
self just as invested in the school's
success as you arc. That said, I'm
glad I'm not the one to tell the met
allurgists their department's being
cut. That sounds rough.
Professionally yours.
Kevin Webb
Oh. and if you're curious, I went
with the hard drive.
