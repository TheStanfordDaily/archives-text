# Too Big To Fail
## Dear President Hennessy

Dear President Hennessy,
I" n these troubling economic times, I know
you are lacing many hard, unpopular de
cisions about which departments and
programs you can "give the axe." ((»et it? It's
like what we say during — eh. never mind.)
Well. I recently had to choose between buy
ing an external hard drive or some DVDs I
wanted, so I can relate to the tough choices
that lie ahead for you.
Now. I know what you're wondering:
Who is this ruggedly handsome kid spewing
such sage, helpful advice? Fair, though the
fact that you don't remember me is a little
hurtful, because we met on frosh move-in
day last year. I was dressed like a clown, and
you were dressed like a guy in a suit. We
shook hands, and it was one of the highlights
of my life.
But don't worry - I don't hold your for
get fulness against vou. In fact. I am so not

grudging that I am giving you a lot of solu
tions for solving the budget crisis, which 1 am
even prepared to let you take credit for.
Now. if I were you, the first thing I would
excise would be Stanford Dining. This is
nothing personal - Dining is made up of a
lot of dedicated, hard-working people who
try their best to give us the food we need to
be not hungry. However, Stanford Dining is
not In-N ()ut. and this is a fault I have yet to
forgive them for.

I would also ax the guys who direct bicy
cle traffic around the roundabouts. If fresh
men can't get into accidents at the former In
tersection of Death, how will they learn that
it's bad to get into bike accidents? These are
the kinds of questions that haunt me when I
am trying to sleep.
Additionally, I'd gel rid of any depart
ment that does things that I do not under
stand. on the basis that people in those de
partments are always using words that they
might be making up and, worse, that they
rarely discuss the television show "The Of
fice."
Examples of these departments include
astrophysics, regular physics, astrobiology,
astrology, gastronomy, metallurgy, witch
craft and any department that routinely uses
the phrase "postmodern" in a non-ironic
sense.
