## The top 25 things I'll miss
### 
I along with !.(>()() other seniors — ;mi
quickly reaching the end of my days at
.Stanford. Ihe end is certainly rushing up
at me. ()ne more blink and it's gone.
Instead ol writing another column mus
ing about the political issue tin jour, or the
small things at Stanford that drive me insane
(stop signs! I am still angry!). I am going to
do something different. I am going to detail
the 25 things that I will miss most about
Stanford, good and bad Mere it goes, in no
particular order:
1. I raiche. the best fro/en yogurt there ever
was (with strawberries and wildflower
honey) and the supreme campus unifier.
2. kairos Wine & < heesc. the best way to
spend my be-sweatered Wednesday nights.
3. Pi Phi's w ho wear Pi Phi-cmbla/oned gear.
I very. Single. Day
4. Ihe thrill of student government cam
paigning. Ii has been said that I acuity politics
is the most intense because so little is at
stake.'["his is false. Student government dis
putes are far more acrimonious and far less
meaningful than inter-professor conflict.
5. I he simulation in Polisci lI4S. "Interna
tional Security in a C hanging World." which
is the most fun I have ever had in a class.
6. ( ale Night at fTench House, which was
consistently the best party on campus. I
never danced on the tables, though, which is
something I and I alone will always re
gret.
7. Ihe free catered lunches at I iceman
Spogli Institute talks. Sometimes I would
have a great Indian lunch and an interesting
talk for five days straight Ihe lunches have
unfortunately been abolished due to budget
cuts. ()ne day. I hope they'll return to benefit
future generations of hungry international
security nerds.
K. I he unfortunately stigmati/ed Structured
Liberal Education (SI.I ; .), which was so
formative for my academic development.
I ligh speed wireless across campus. I Ins is
an enormous luxury that is hard to appreci
ate fully (because there is always wireless
everywhere at Stanford!).
II). Ihe first days of freshman year the
tin ill. the independence, the putting every
one off by loudly debating Turkish entry into
the El J on mv fits! dav.

I have never danced
on the tables, though,
which is something
I-and I alone—will
always regret.

11. I"he celebrity speakers who rocked my
world ('hristopher Hitchens, lan Mcl -
wan.Samantha Power. I rands I-ukuyama.
12. Ihe trials and tribulations of taking the
Marguerite anywhere. Always an ordeal.
13. Fifty-cent coffee at the Bookstore, the
liquid luel of the undergraduate community.
14. I lie large desks near the window when
entering (ireen on the Meyer entrance,
which served as the space in which my hon
ors thesis \v;is made.
15. I lie people-watching at Moonbcan's. See
