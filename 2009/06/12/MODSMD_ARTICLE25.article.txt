## A problem of admission
### 
W ith Admit Weekend upon us. the
campus should by now be awash in
ProFros. red folders and lots of SA T
score comparisons. Welcome, "lowest admis
sion percentage of all time" class of 2013!
While helicopter parents plan their chil
dren's four-vear-plan unit-by-unit. ProFros
lucky enough to escape parents and pressure
can have all sorts of fun attending panels and
comparing Al' scores. Oh joy! Who cares that
it doesn't matter anymore because every
one's already in? It's never too late to see how
you measure up.
But among the discussions held by
ProFros year after year, one you can expect to
hear a lot this weekend is the Stanford duck
analogy- something perpetuated by its
mention in those Princeton Review college
ranking books.
Sometimes also referred to as a "syn
drome." the Stanford duck idea is that while
yes. this is California,and everyone is happily
prancing in the sun (never mind the four
straight months of wind, clouds and intermit
tent rain), the happy carefree-ness visible to
the outside world is actually only half of the
equation.
Our duck faces and bodies are calm above

the water, you see. but below it we are churn
ing our webbed feet madly to keep up the
overachieving in classes, activities and jobs.
Why do feet count as half of a duck? Don't
ask me, I study political science. Mangling
metaphors is a specialty of ours.
Going back to our Stanford duck, the real
question is whether the duality of calm and
happy versus frenetically busy is a bad thing.
It's really cool that the guy playing Frisbee
with his shirt off is also majoring in architec
tural chemistry with a minor in Nordic lan
guages. Did he mention he also sings a cappel
la? It can get nauseating for those of us less
accomplished, less talented or simply lazier,
especially when some of the over-perform
ance seems like a disingenuous attempt to get
into law school.
But when someone like this is genuine
and truly I believe this is more than half the
time — isn't it awesome? Aren't these the
kind of people you come to Stanford to meet?
For me. my four years at Stanford have been
an exercise in learning to squash insecurity
while making incredible, incredible friends.
For a while, it's kind of debilitating to real
ize you'll never come close to grasping parti
cle physics like the kid down the hall. Or that

you aren't going to write plays in your spare
time when not building electric cars with
household appliances. But what I've learned
is that you don't have to measure yourself up
against everyone, in every category, to he suc
cessful. Or to he happy.
This, perhaps more than anything else, is
something to keep in mind for Admit Week
end. even for those of us several years in or
about to graduate. Comparisons don't have to
be hierarchical. Admits, don't measure your
self against the next kid and wonder if you're
"better." I'm no career counselor, or even a
Daily advice columnist. But the point of col
lege for me has been trying to find the things
I actually like and then striving to get good at
them — rather than trying to dominate
everything for the sake of dominance.
Returning to the duck analogy, if it's possi
ble to learn to accept the crazy abilities of
your peers, is there a downside to this envi
ronment where it sometimes feels like every
one has dozens of hidden talents you can't
