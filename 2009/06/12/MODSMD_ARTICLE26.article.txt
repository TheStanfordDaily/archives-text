# Demby Downer
## Nicole Demby My sweaty first time 
### 
I felt my hands getting clammy as I waited for
the Marguerite on Campus Drive. I started
.to feel the performance anxiety welling up
within me. Was it glaringly obvious that this was
going to be my lirst time? Sorority girls who'd
definitely done it their first week of Stanford
hiked out of the ('owe 11 Cluster. ITiey looked
freshly-showered and radiant. I bet they did it
this morning. I thought. I looked down at my
own revealing attire. I was about to pop my
Stanford gym cherry.
As joggers walked by I became increasingly
aware of the irony of my waiting to take a two
minute bus ride to the gym. I could feel passer
by eyes moving from my athletic shorts to my
sneakers to the Marguerite stop sign, their
stares boring straight through my athletic fa
cade.

When I got off the shuttle by the Track
Mouse. I stood perplexed for a minute. Sur
rounded by different athletic facilities. I real
ized I didn't actually know where the gym was.
I wisely decided to follow the girl in the running
shorts and Stanford sweatshirt, who led me to
more gym-shorted folk gathering outside of
what I assumed was my destination. Walking
inside Arrillaga. I was unsure of how to proceed
next. I handed my ID to the boy behind the
desk He looked confused for a moment, then
smirked as the situation dawned on him.
"You're supposed to scan it over there." he said,
pointing to a little black box on the desk. I
looked down at my feet and muttered thanks,
knowing that he knew.
Much to the surprise of those at Stanford
who know me. I was once an athletic person.

Starting with gymnastics. I moved on to basket
hall. ultimate I risbee. soccer, volleyball and
even football during my pre-col lege life. Then
one day I stopped moving. I made the decision
to give up team sports because of other time
commitments. I was occupied with other things
that felt more important to me at the time. Be
cause the prospect of running on a treadmill in
a gym had always felt too much like being a
hamster on an exercise wheel, and because I
lacked the discipline for jogging, the end ot my
team sports career spelled the end of my career
as an active person. At first the change was sini
ply pragmatic, but soon I began to relish my
new role as a l.a/\ Person with a mildly un
healthy lifestyle. In the morning I drank coffee,
smoked and scorned the bright young healthy
people heading to the nearest ( runch. I et the
plebeians toil away. I thought. I was concerned
with loftier matters.
While the athlete in me may have
gone into submission then, it always
remained latent, waiting for those mo
ments when it could manifest itself
through marathon nights dancing at
clubs, or could show off during a casu
al Frisbee toss on the beach. After
years of denying any form of regular
expression, I decided, for a slew of
complicated reasons, to go to my local
YMCA while home in Brooklyn over
spring break. What I discovered sur
prised me. I actually enjoyed myself. It
felt great to move my body seriously
again, to pump some adrenalin
through my limbs. I exited back onto
the street an hour later with a laver of

dried sweat on myself and the spring of
endorphins in my step.
Walking into the Stanford gym, I
felt I had entered a new realm of the
healthfulness stratosphere. In Brook
lyn I would have been surrounded by
slightly tubby tatt(x>ed hipster guys
trying to make peace with their bodies
after their weekend hangovers, older
women who shopped at the Park
Slope Food Co-op and tweener kids
visiting from the public school nearby.
In Arrillaga I felt I'd walked into some
Grecian urn covered with young
sweaty nubile bodies running,
writhing, lifting and stretching.
Maybe I was infected by the
pheromones these kids were secreting
into the air. but I considered for the
first time that the Stanford exercise
culture I 'd always sneered at was actu
ally founded on the simple logic I had
been denying: that its not ideal to be a
brain that simply floats from class to

class, that moving feels good. that our
bodies are meant to exert themselves
and that bodily health has a profound
effect on one's mental health. I real
ized that part of my condescension, of
my trying to convince myself that all
gvm-goers were superficial exercise
bunnies, had come from a deep-seed
ed guilt I felt for not exercising. I took
a deep breath and inhaled this strange
new landscape. Exhaling. 1 entered the
throng and headed for the nearest
open Elliptical.
An hour and a Marguerite trip
later, I walked back into my co-op.
"Did you just exercise?!" my friend
asked me incredulously. I gave her a
sheepish smile and quietly admitted it
had been m\ first time.

and slathering herself with vegetable oil.
