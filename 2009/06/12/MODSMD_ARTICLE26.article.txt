## Nicole Demby My sweaty first time 
### 
I felt my hands getting clammy as I waited for
the Marguerite on Campus Drive. I started
.to feel the performance anxiety welling up
within me. Was it glaringly obvious that this was
going to be my lirst time? Sorority girls who'd
definitely done it their first week of Stanford
hiked out of the ('owe 11 Cluster. ITiey looked
freshly-showered and radiant. I bet they did it
this morning. I thought. I looked down at my
own revealing attire. I was about to pop my
Stanford gym cherry.
As joggers walked by I became increasingly
aware of the irony of my waiting to take a two
minute bus ride to the gym. I could feel passer
by eyes moving from my athletic shorts to my
sneakers to the Marguerite stop sign, their
stares boring straight through my athletic fa

When I got off the shuttle by the Track
Mouse. I stood perplexed for a minute. Sur
rounded by different athletic facilities. I real
ized I didn't actually know where the gym was.
I wisely decided to follow the girl in the running
shorts and Stanford sweatshirt, who led me to
more gym-shorted folk gathering outside of
what I assumed was my destination. Walking
inside Arrillaga. I was unsure of how to proceed

pointing to a little black box on the desk. I
looked down at my feet and muttered thanks,
knowing that he knew.
Much to the surprise of those at Stanford
who know me. I was once an athletic person.

Starting with gymnastics. I moved on to basket
hall. ultimate I risbee. soccer, volleyball and
even football during my pre-col lege life. Then
one day I stopped moving. I made the decision
to give up team sports because of other time
commitments. I was occupied with other things
that felt more important to me at the time. Be
cause the prospect of running on a treadmill in
a gym had always felt too much like being a
hamster on an exercise wheel, and because I
lacked the discipline for jogging, the end ot my
team sports career spelled the end of my career
as an active person. At first the change was sini
ply pragmatic, but soon I began to relish my
new role as a l.a/\ Person with a mildly un
healthy lifestyle. In the morning I drank coffee,
smoked and scorned the bright young healthy
people heading to the nearest ( runch. I et the
plebeians toil away. I thought. I was concerned
