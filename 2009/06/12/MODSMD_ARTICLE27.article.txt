## Do not end Stanford as we know it

Columbia Professor Mark C.
Taylor's recent op-ed in IT»e
New York Times suggesting
that we "End the University as We
Know It" is one of a long line of cri
tiques of higher education, along
with William Deresiewicz's "The
Disadvantages of an Elite Educa
tion" and Rick Perlstein's "What's
the Matter With College?" Because
these essays ostensibly evaluate our
educational experience right here at
Stanford, we wanted to take the op
portunity to respond to Taylor's in
dictment of universities as over-spe
cialized. impractical and non-collab
orative.
Stanford, we feel, is none of these
things. While there is some truth to
Taylor's assessment — perhaps
more so at some institutions than
others — one need only look at the
myriad of interdisciplinary and
hands-on departments, majors, pro
grams. fellowships and courses to see
that Stanford University appreciates
both the value of specialized knowl
edge and the importance of working
across traditional academic and
real-world divides.
Taylor, for example, proposes re
structuring curricula, abolishing per
manent departments and increasing
collaboration between institutions.
Here at Stanford, curricula are fre
quently reappraised and restruc
tured. The history department has
voted to remain in the humanities
rather than migrate to the social sci
ences. Cultural and Social Anthro
pology and Anthropological Sci
ences have engaged in a decade-long
process of merging, splitting and re
constitution. a mating ritual worthy
of anthropological study itself.
That being said, abolishing per
manent departments might be tak
ing things a bit far. Many Stanford
students enjoy being able to focus
their attentions on particular sub
jects. and Taylor's proposal to create
constantly-evolving "problem-fo
cused programs" — Mind. Body.
Water. Language. Money — is in
triguing. but does not necessarily ap
peal to all.
Stanford welcomes those who
prefer to concentrate on electrical
engineering, for example, rather

than ask everyone to reorient them
selves around a given problem. At
the same time, we offer countless op
portunities for that same student to
work within multiple departments,
design his or her own major, study at
other universities addressing our in-
