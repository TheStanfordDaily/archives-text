## Do not end Stanford as we know it

Columbia Professor Mark C.
Taylor's recent op-ed in IT»e
New York Times suggesting
that we "End the University as We
Know It" is one of a long line of cri
tiques of higher education, along
with William Deresiewicz's "The
Disadvantages of an Elite Educa
tion" and Rick Perlstein's "What's
the Matter With College?" Because
these essays ostensibly evaluate our
educational experience right here at
Stanford, we wanted to take the op
portunity to respond to Taylor's in
dictment of universities as over-spe
cialized. impractical and non-collab
orative.
Stanford, we feel, is none of these
things. While there is some truth to
Taylor's assessment — perhaps
more so at some institutions than
others — one need only look at the
myriad of interdisciplinary and
hands-on departments, majors, pro
grams. fellowships and courses to see
that Stanford University appreciates
both the value of specialized knowl
edge and the importance of working
across traditional academic and
real-world divides.
Taylor, for example, proposes re
structuring curricula, abolishing per
manent departments and increasing
collaboration between institutions.
Here at Stanford, curricula are fre
quently reappraised and restruc
tured. The history department has
voted to remain in the humanities
rather than migrate to the social sci
ences. Cultural and Social Anthro
pology and Anthropological Sci
ences have engaged in a decade-long
process of merging, splitting and re
constitution. a mating ritual worthy
of anthropological study itself.
That being said, abolishing per
manent departments might be tak
ing things a bit far. Many Stanford
students enjoy being able to focus
their attentions on particular sub
jects. and Taylor's proposal to create
constantly-evolving "problem-fo
cused programs" — Mind. Body.
Water. Language. Money — is in
triguing. but does not necessarily ap
peal to all.
Stanford welcomes those who
prefer to concentrate on electrical
engineering, for example, rather

than ask everyone to reorient them
selves around a given problem. At
the same time, we offer countless op
portunities for that same student to
work within multiple departments,
design his or her own major, study at
other universities addressing our in-

terests in different ways, collaborate

Symbolic Systems faculty are
drawn from computer science, lin
guistics. philosophy, psychology and
education. The Science. Technology

a similar range of faculty from de

gets a significant amount of interdis
ciplinary attention at the Bill Lane
Center for the American West,
where several recent conferences
brought together environmentalists,
farmers, legal experts, water regula
tors and other stakeholders. Same
goes for the Woods Institute lor the
Environment, which lists a series of
Strategic Collaborations within and
without the University — on food
security and the environment with
the Freeman Spogli Institute for In
ternational Studies, with the World
Wildlife Fund and the Nature Con
servancy, and with the Monterey
Bay Aquarium.
The interconnectedness of Stan
ford's majors, departments and pro
grams is impressive. The depth that
some students study in incredibly
specialized fields is similarly re
markable. Taylor may decry over
specialized theses and publishing
dissertations, but it was just such a
research project that led Larry Page
and Sergey Brin to develop Pageß
ank and later Google. Taylor's sug
gestion to transform traditional dis
sertations by using new media such
as film and the Web have been im
plemented in many PWR2 classes,
as well as in Stanford's collabora
tive Metamedia "Collaboratory,"
where students' final projects are

often online and wiki-based.
We are certainly a university
looking to the outside world and
oriented toward real-world applica
bility, as envisioned by our universi
ty's founders. At the same time, we
have our fair share of philosophy
students and liberal arts majors
happily ensconced in Green Library
and willing to debate Marx at the
drop of a hat. This intellectual diver
sity is a strength which the Universi
ty can draw on as a foundation for
the more interdisciplinary pro
grams it develops.
Stanford grad students, while
perhaps grumbling about being ex
ploited for cheap labor, are not the
hvper-specialized. hopelessly un
employable individuals who "will
never hold the kind of job for which
they are being trained" that Taylor
contends most graduate students
are. Many will have trouble, espe
cially in these economic circum
stances, finding a tenured position,
but others will succeed, and still oth
ers will go on to interesting careers
where their undergraduate and
graduate education will inform
their work and form the basis for
their skills.

Professor tenures is a complex
issue, and Taylor is correct that
tenure can lead to an atrophied de
partment, where no one has any in
centive to be productive and profes
sors merely stand in the way of their
graduate students getting jobs. Yet
tenure also allows professors to
speak their minds — to pen op-eds
in major newspapers, for instance
— without fear of retaliation. And
judging by the proliferation of arti
cles in "journals read by no one
other than a few like-minded col
leagues" (and all the students
they've ever taught) — most of
Stanford's professors have not fall
en down on the job once they re
ceive tenure.
Thus, we applaud Taylor for lev
eling his critique at the field of high
er learning in which he is an active
and clearly caring participant. Such
introspection is valuable if we are to
continue refining, improving and
even restructuring our universities.
We also applaud Stanford for strik
ing an ideal balance between spe
cialization and generalization, col
laboration and individuality, liberal
arts and applied sciences and the
practical and the theoretical.
