# Mental health report needs more specifics

Originally published on Oct. I.2(X)S
r 112 The editorial board is pleased to see the release
of the Student Mental I lealth and Well-Being
JL Task Force Report, which we hope will draw
attention to campus mental health. Though we are
glad that the University is giving much-deserved at
tention to this issue, much remains to be done. Near
ly two years have passed since the task force con
vened, but the report provides few specifics on the
next steps Stanford should take. We were expecting
more.
Hie task force devotes much of the report to ex
ploring the mental health issues that students face,
discussing issues like pressure to appear happy
("the duck syndrome") and addressing the impor
tance of friends, family and advisors. While we agree
that outlining such issues is a necessary first step for
this kind of report, we worry that the University de
voted more time to observations and less time to re
sults. The report notes." In arguably its most surpris
ing observation, the Task Force discovered that aca
demic success is not a reliable indicator of emotion
al well-being." We are concerned that it took the
University two years to realize what the average
Stanford student could explain in two minutes.
Our greatest concern is that there are few tangi
ble initiatives discussed in the report. The authors

make only a few direct proposals, such as incorpo
rating depression screening in primary care medi
cine and creating a Web site to address mental
health initiatives. We presumed that the task force
took all these months to come up with concrete
changes, but the report is vague in its recommenda
tions for how mental health resources can be im
proved.The study makes many suggestions without
discussing a means of implementation, li notes that
we should reduce the stigma of mental health on
campus, but offers few methods todo so. Simply say
ing that we need further educational initiatives isn't
enough.
Rather, the report focuses on the creation of
even more committees - an oversight committee to
oversee mental health initiatives, a working group
related to academic initiatives aimed at reducing
stress.a committee to evaluate information sharing
policies among offices.a committee to study mental
health leaves of absences, a review of New Student
Orientation, etc. We had hoped that this report
would outline the changes it expects these commit
tees to suggest. We are concerned how much more
time will pass, how many students will lack re
sources. before we start to see concrete results.
We were in particular hoping to see sweeping
changes regarding broad reform of CAPS and de
tailed plans for Residential Education resources.

perhaps the two most important resources for stu
dents with mental health concerns. Hut Residential
Education lias little mention in the study, and dis
cussions of CAPS reform did not meet our expecta
tions. We are glad that the University realized
CAPS is experiencing an unprecedented demand
for services, hut we expected real solutions for stu
dents hoping to receive long-term care through
("APS or find shorter waiting lines when trying to
make an appointment. The report suggests that
CAPS provide one professional staff member to
everv I.( KH) to 1.5(H) students.a goal recommended
by the International Association of Counseling Ser
vices. We are glad that the report notes additional
CAPS counselors will be hired soon to curb issues
related to staff availability, but we are concerned
that these efforts are not enough. Stanford should
not be working toward a baseline standard, but ex
ceeding it instead.
We are glad that the llniversity released this re
port. even if we are unsatisfied with current
progress. Any step relating to improving mental
health and acknowledging campus problems is an
important step. But we hope the University does
not simply revel in the positive press it's likely to re
ceive for forming the task force and giving this re
port. Admitting that work needs to be done is not
enough. We need solutions.
