V-Day is taking Stanford by storm with Five
Ensler - V-Day founder and director of the
award-winning "Vagina Monologues,"
coming to campus this Friday to speak about
women's sexual health - and Valentine's Day ro
mance still in the air. Yet the absence of dialogue
on campus about the rising cost of birth control is
alarming.
As this month's back-to-back, sold-out per
formances of the "Vagina Monologues" confirm,
women on this campus are more vocal and em
powered to demand sexual equality than ever be
fore. In addition to the success of the show, stu
dent groups came out in force to rally for safe sex
on Sexual Health Day last Thursday in White
Plaza, distributing contraception information.
Amid the commotion V-Day stirs, and the
"Monologues'" cry for women to take control of
their bodies, the editorial board wonders: Why
has the dialogue about rising costs of birth con
trol been lost in the shuffle?
In the past year, prices for birth control for stu
dents without Cardinal Care have more than
doubled. At the same time. Vaden Health Cen
ter's supply of affordable pill packs is dwindling.

Ilie rise reflects a national trend in costs lor basic
protective care for female college students
throughout the country.
We know the economy is suffering and that
budgets across the board ;ire stretched, but high
oral contraceptive costs for female students
should not be among the burdens forced on stu
dents. especially given the fact that over W per
cent of college women report using or;il contra
ception according to a 2006 survey by the Ameri
can College I lealth Association. No event under
lined the challenges of teen pregnancy in the
media more than the teenage pregnancy of Bris
tol Plain, daughter of Republican vice presiden
tial candidate (iov. Sarah Palin (R Alaska). In
these uncertain economic times, with graduating
seniors wondering how they will afford their own
healthcare, unplanned children are the last thing
female students can afford.
Recently, Stanford has been on the cutting
edge when it comes to safe sex. Last year, Trojan
Condoms awarded Stanford a No. I ranking in its
third annual sexual health report card, citing
broad contraception availability as one of the rea
sons Stanford rose from its 2007 ranking of #41. At
the time the ranking was published.Vaden offered
birth control at a significantly discounted rate to

nil Stanford students, regardless of their insurance
status. I veil without Cardinal Care, women could
purchase discounted hirth control from Vaden's
pharmacy for as little as $10. Currently, costs are
estimated at $19 for the cheapest hirth control for
students without ( ardinal Care.
The increase in cost is not the result of Vaden
policy, but rather a mandate forced by the U.S.
Congress. When the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act
was signed into law. it ended a practice by which
drug manufacturers provided prescription con
traceptives to university health centers at dis
counted rates. As a result of this new law.it is more
difficult for Vaden to sell contraceptives at the
previous discounted rate.
The current administration in Washington has
taken a friendlier stance on birth control than the
Hush administration, so there is hope that if
protests are loud enough, subsidized birth control
for all women may come back to campuses. Stan
ford should do its part. No matter where individu
als stand on this issue, there needs to be a more
public debate regarding the on-campus price of
contraceptives. We encourage the administration,
students and campus healthcare officials to sit
down and have a public dialogue regarding the
rising price of contraceptives.
