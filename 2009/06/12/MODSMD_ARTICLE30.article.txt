# Univ. mishandled sorority housing situation

This housing Draw cycle presented many
challenges to the University with the imple
mentation of the new Master I lousing Plan.
One of these challenges was dealing with the soror
ity housing situation, as sororities witnessed 2()per
cent increases in rush and subsequent increases in
the minimum number of new members. These in
creases meant the housed sororities on campus-
TriDelt.Theta and Pi Phi - would face tough chal
lenges when it came to housing its new members.
While the editorial board understands the difficul
ties involved in housing so many additional sorori
ty members, we believe the University's handling
of the situation was not helpful.
In the past, housed sororities have been able to
decide their own chapter's housing policy, but this
year. Residential Education (ResEd) sent a letter
to housed sorority members nine days before the
Draw deadline instructing them to give first prior
ity to seniors, second priority to juniors and third
priority to sophomores in accordance with the
University's new Master Housing Plan.This man
date was an especially difficult thing for housed
sororities to face.considering they typically tell po
tential new members during Rush Week they will
be given housing their sophomore year-a large
selling point for those looking to become part of a
new community quickly. No such mandate was

given to housed fraternities, which were left, as
usual, to decide their housing policies for them
selves.
ITiis was an inappropriate move on Res Ed's
part.The purpose of the University Master Hous
ing Plan was to create an easier and fairer housing
process - one very good way the new housing plan
went about this was by creating a system in which
upperclassmen get priority in the housing process.
But in dealing with the sorority situation. ResEd
failed to recognize that issuing external mandates
on sororities that would prefer to decide their own
housing processes is counteractive to the liberties
sororities have received in the past,and makes fig
uring out housing much more difficult for those
students involved. Instead of allowing sororities -
who have the closest understanding of the inter
ests of upperclass members, new members and the
sorority as a whole - to decide their housing poli
cies for themselves. ResEd suddenly decided that
it would decide what was best for the sororities.
Furthermore, notifying sororities of this new
rule little more than a week before the Draw dead
line forced individuals to scramble to change hous
ing plans and create Draw groups, an undue bur
den considering that the University knew of the in
creased pledge classes several weeks before the
deadline. It was also inappropriate for the Univer
sity to decide that sororities would be more strict
ly regulated in their housing processes, while leav

ing fraternities free to do as they please. II the Uni
versity decides to implement housing require
ments for housed Greek organizations, then these
policies should he mandated across all Greek
houses, without discrimination.
Although members of ResEd tried hard to
work with the sororities to find a solution, their ul
timate decision to mandate policy was poor. The
sorority housing situation has been only partially
resolved - TriDelt and I'i Phi have managed to
house all new members, but Theta's housing situa
tion remains unclear. And this result was achieved
at a cost, as some upper-class members - including
rising seniors - sacrificed their places and accepted
Tier Three housing next year for the sake of their
fellow sorority sisters.
It is important tt) keep in mind that the I 'niver
sity was involved in pushing sororities to increase
their pledge class sizes - a decision that helped cre
ate the sorority housing crunch in the first place -
and there is no reason why upperclass members
should have anticipated having to deal with this
housing problem as rising seniors. With over hJMH)
undergraduate students on campus, the rising sen
iors in sororities who were affected by these poli
cies were few. but the precedent of imposing hous
ing decisions on private student houses instead of
expressing concerns and allowing them to decide
for themselves does not bode well for future hous
ing decisions.
