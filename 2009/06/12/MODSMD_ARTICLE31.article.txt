This past Friday at Memorial Auditorium, the
ASSU Speaker's Bureau and Stanford in
Government — in conjunction with a host
of other campus organizations — presented Per
ve/ Musharraf, the former Pakistani head of state,
for their annual "Big Speaker" series. Following
his contested rise to presidency in 2(H) 1. Mushar
raf played a central role in global counter-terror
ism efforts and Indian-Pakistani relations, at the
same time drawing controversy in international
politics.
After delivering a nearly 55-minute speech that
highlighted the importance of combating terror
ism. resolving political strife in the Middle East
and South Asia and other issues. Musharraf faced
a question-and-answer session with the Stanford
community. No sooner had the microphones been
turned on did the cat-calls start Hying. Enraged In
dian nationalists and other emotionally charged
students questioned everything from the legitima
cy of Musharraf's rule to the inherent corruption
of the Pakistani government. The end result was
ultimately a back-and-forth between strong
willed. would-be inquisitors and an equally defi
ant. linger-wagging Musharraf.
Iliis event is but the most recent manifestation
of the problem with enlightened and civil dis

course on campus. As one of the leading educa
tional institutions worldwide. Stanford is a reposi
tory lor diverse opinions, ideologies and global
outlooks. Oftentimes, as evidenced by the Mushar
raf question-and-answer session, these beliefs con
flict in less-than-subtle ways.
As far removed as the Farm seems from events
in the real world, too often do issues of national
and global import trickle down into fiery dorm list
exchanges.The recent strife in Cia/a has highlight
ed the uneasy relationship between Israeli and
Palestinian-leaning student organizations on cam
pus. The 2(X)«S election cycle deeply shook the psy
che of student life, from the accusations of vicious
ness in the Democratic primaries to the outrage
over the passage of Prop. 8. Many hold particular
ly strong beliefs on these issues, vet the climate has
not always been conducive to certain parts of the
population effectively articulating positions not
shared bv a majority of the student body.
The editorial board in no way advocates the
curtailing of dissent or an environment that values
diluted, politically correct tripe as a means to ad
dress complex issues. Rather, in coordination with
the educational mission of this university, we en
dorse a campus culture that provides for the free
and civil exchange of varied beliefs in a non
threatening setting that encourages intellectual
stimulation and growth. Ibo often do we find tu

multuous subjects rcduced to shouting matches, in
which each side tries to drown out the other in a
sea of impassioned remarks/Phis does little to per
petuate an atmosphere in which disagreement is
celebrated.
Hie University is often held up as a central
place where personal beliefs are challenged and
redefined, where exposure to diverse ways of
thinking expands one's perspective. It is thus iron
ic that many students interested in civil discussion
may shy away from thorny topics for fear of insti
gating conflict in the dining hall, on the chat list or
in emails to'lTie Daily. Shouting matches.electron
ic or otherwise, not only contribute little to debate
but also create an intellectually stilling atmos
phere for those hoping to foster authentic debate.
Musharraf is no doubt an immensely contro
versial figure, and his presence should have right
fully spatked an intense and thoughtful discussion
on the state of South-Asian geo politics and the
current state of counter-terrorism. Just as the (iaza
conflict and the presidential election have brought
opposite ideologies to a head, we should not balk
at the prospect of lively debate. If we prize our rep
utation as a world-class institution, it is ineumbent
upon us a student body to argue for our beliefs, but
in a way that is more in line with the values of Stan
ford and less comparable to cable television news
stations.
