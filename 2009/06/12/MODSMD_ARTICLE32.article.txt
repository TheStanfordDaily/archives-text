Amid the sea of red and white
balloons that lined Palm
Drive and the influx of Stan
lord alumni for Reunion Homecom
ing. another Stanford anniversary
was celebrated earlier this month.
Alumni from across the world gath
ered to commemorate the 40th an
niversary of "Taking Back the Mic."
an historic event in which 70 mem
bers of the Black Student I Jnion - on
the night of Martin Luther KingJr.'s
assassination - gave the University a
list of 10 demands to improve the
quality of life for minority students.
The 40th anniversary of this im
portant event provides us a chance to
look back on the numerous efforts
the University has taken since that
pivotal moment in history.The edito
rial board would like to take this mo
ment to applaud the University for
the many strides it has made.The in
crease of undergraduate diversity
and the proportional representation
of minority groups, as well as the shift
in financial aid from loans to grant
based packages, are proof that much
from that list has been accomplished
in the past 40 years.
Today, we inhabit a very different
Stanford from the one of 1968. Stu
dents of color make up about half of
the student body. The resources pro
vided to ethnic and cultural commu
nities today are unparalleled by
those of the l%os.'lTie meaning of di
versity has also expanded to include
members of the LCiB I community,
students with disabilities and low-in
come students, and these and other
groups are now given administrative
support that was lacking half a centu
ry ago. At long last.quotas for female
applicants have been eliminated.
But before we mark the list of 10
demands ascomplete.it is imperative
that we look ;it the w;ivs in which the
University has fallen short. In 40
years, one of those 10 demands has
yet to be fully realized: the call for
faculty diversity.
Though our student body has
grown infinitely more diverse, facul
ty diversity has experienced a less
dramatic increase. In 2006, faculty of
color constituted 1K.4 percent of the

Stanford has
lost experts on
a number of di
versity-related
topics

faculty, based on ;i report issued to
the Faculty Senate. But some groups
are making bigger strides than oth
ers.even though they still have a long
way to go. Asian/Asian-American
faculty, reported as I2.fr percent of
faculty in 2006. have been increasing
steadily with the addition of 105 new
faculty members over the course of
10 years. Though the numbers for
women are still dismal, they too
made gains, comprising 24.3 percent
of 112 acu 11 y. 38 pe rce nt of dean s. 30 per
cent of associate deans and 57 per
cent of the advisory board in 200h.
Numbers of underrepresented
minority faculty (including African
Americans. Native Americans and
Latinos), however, have shown little
to no growth in the last few years. In
that same 10-year time span. Stan
lord saw the introduction of only
nine new African-American faculty
members and 15 Hispanic faculty
members. Native Americans saw no
increase, remaining at only three fac
ulty members.Together, these under
represented minority groups consti
tuted only live percent of Stanford's
faculty in 2006.
Our undergraduate population is
praised for being on the forefront of
diversity, with a student body that is
24 percent Asian-American, 11 per
cent Latino, nine percent
Black/African Americans and two
percent Native-American. But the
numbers for faculty shine light on a
great disparity. Native Americans
don't even make a whole percent,
resting at 0.2 percent while African-
American professors comprise two
and a half percent and Latinos three
percent, according to the 200b fig
ures.
With numbers as disproportion
ate as this, when an African Ameri
can. Hispanic or Native American
student walks across the stage at
graduation, he or she has more than
likely never taken a class from a pro
fessor from a similar minority in the
past four years at Stanford. For ex
ample, without the addition of Prof.
Gary Segura. a current political sci
ence major could not have taken a
class from any full professor who was
an underrepresented minority.
But the issue of faculty diversity
goes even deeper than skin tone. Fac
ulty from different backgrounds en
rich the spectrum of specializations
that students can use as sounding
boards for their own scholarly work.
With the recent loss of certain facul
ty, Stanford has lost experts on a
number of diversity-related topics.

Before we could fully celebrate the
arrival of the much-respected Soci
ology Prof. Lawrence Bobo and As
sociate Communication Prof. Mar
cyliena Morgan, we were already
protesting their departure. The cou
ple, who respectively study the soci
ology of race and hip-hop culture,
came to Stanford from Harvard in
2005 but returned in January 2(X)8. If
Stanford can manage to woo these
academic minority headliners here,
what more can the University do to
retain them? There is some irony in
the fact that the loss of Bobo meant
the loss of one of the nation's chief
experts on racial attitudes and the
progress of racial integration.
This does not go to say that the
University has done nothing to en
hance faculty diversity. Tackling the
pipeline problem head-on at the end
of 2007, the University generated the
DARE (Diversifying Academia, Re
cruiting Excellence) Fellowship pro
gram.'Hie initiative aims to aid doc
toral students in their development
in communication, leadership skills
and confidence to help successfully
launch their careers in academia.
The University must commit to
fixing the pipeline problem if it is se
rious about improving faculty diver
sity. We must continue to provide
and improve guidance, inspiration
and support for those who show po
tential in pursuing a career in acade
mia. In 2006, African-American and
Latino students made up only 3.2

percent and 4.9 percent, respectively,
of graduate students studying the
humanities. Those stats broke down
to 1.2 percent and 5.9 percent for the
natural sciences, and 3.4 percent and
5.9 percent for the social sciences,ac
cording to numbers provided by the
Office of the University Registrar.
The editorial board does not ask
that the University establish a quota
system or bring in sub-par professors
for the sake of adding minority facul
ty. We also believe that a commit
ment to faculty diversity does not
simply mean a commitment to hiring
faculty of color. Stanford should also
focus on recruiting more women in
departments where they arc under
represented. Hiring professors who
focus on LGBT and social class is
sues also contributes to the intellec
tual diversity at Stanford. These
groups, among others, are often ig
nored in discussions about faculty di
versity. but they are equally impor
tant to enhancing the diversity at
Stanford.
Rather, we ask the University to
commit not only to finding superior
professors but also to retaining
them. More diligent and concentrat
ed efforts should be made for our
faculty diversity to be more reflec
tive of the diversity in our student
body. The editorial board sincerely
hopes that, in less than another forty
years, we will be able to cross the last
of the 10 demands off of the "Taking
Back the Mic" list.

from that list has been accomplished
in the past 40 years.
Today, we inhabit a very different
Stanford from the one of 1968. Stu
dents of color make up about half of
the student body. The resources pro
vided to ethnic and cultural commu
nities today are unparalleled by
those of the l%os.'lTie meaning of di
versity has also expanded to include
members of the LCiB I community,
students with disabilities and low-in
come students, and these and other
groups are now given administrative
support that was lacking half a centu
ry ago. At long last.quotas for female
applicants have been eliminated.
But before we mark the list of 10
demands ascomplete.it is imperative
that we look ;it the w;ivs in which the
University has fallen short. In 40
years, one of those 10 demands has
yet to be fully realized: the call for
faculty diversity.
Though our student body has
grown infinitely more diverse, facul
ty diversity has experienced a less
dramatic increase. In 2006, faculty of
color constituted 1K.4 percent of the

versity-related
topics

faculty, based on ;i report issued to
the Faculty Senate. But some groups
are making bigger strides than oth
ers.even though they still have a long
way to go. Asian/Asian-American
faculty, reported as I2.fr percent of
faculty in 2006. have been increasing
steadily with the addition of 105 new
faculty members over the course of
10 years. Though the numbers for
women are still dismal, they too
made gains, comprising 24.3 percent
of 112 acu 11 y. 38 pe rce nt of dean s. 30 per
cent of associate deans and 57 per
cent of the advisory board in 200h.
Numbers of underrepresented
minority faculty (including African
Americans. Native Americans and
Latinos), however, have shown little
to no growth in the last few years. In
that same 10-year time span. Stan
lord saw the introduction of only
nine new African-American faculty
members and 15 Hispanic faculty
members. Native Americans saw no
increase, remaining at only three fac
ulty members.Together, these under
represented minority groups consti
tuted only live percent of Stanford's
faculty in 2006.
Our undergraduate population is
praised for being on the forefront of
diversity, with a student body that is
24 percent Asian-American, 11 per
cent Latino, nine percent
Black/African Americans and two
percent Native-American. But the
numbers for faculty shine light on a
great disparity. Native Americans
don't even make a whole percent,
resting at 0.2 percent while African-
American professors comprise two
and a half percent and Latinos three
percent, according to the 200b fig
ures.
With numbers as disproportion
ate as this, when an African Ameri
can. Hispanic or Native American
student walks across the stage at
graduation, he or she has more than
likely never taken a class from a pro
fessor from a similar minority in the
past four years at Stanford. For ex
ample, without the addition of Prof.
Gary Segura. a current political sci
ence major could not have taken a
class from any full professor who was
an underrepresented minority.
But the issue of faculty diversity
goes even deeper than skin tone. Fac
ulty from different backgrounds en
rich the spectrum of specializations
that students can use as sounding
boards for their own scholarly work.
With the recent loss of certain facul
ty, Stanford has lost experts on a
number of diversity-related topics.

Before we could fully celebrate the
arrival of the much-respected Soci
ology Prof. Lawrence Bobo and As
sociate Communication Prof. Mar
cyliena Morgan, we were already
protesting their departure. The cou
ple, who respectively study the soci
ology of race and hip-hop culture,
came to Stanford from Harvard in
2005 but returned in January 2(X)8. If
Stanford can manage to woo these
academic minority headliners here,
what more can the University do to
retain them? There is some irony in
the fact that the loss of Bobo meant
the loss of one of the nation's chief
experts on racial attitudes and the
progress of racial integration.
This does not go to say that the
University has done nothing to en
hance faculty diversity. Tackling the
pipeline problem head-on at the end
of 2007, the University generated the
DARE (Diversifying Academia, Re
cruiting Excellence) Fellowship pro
gram.'Hie initiative aims to aid doc
toral students in their development
in communication, leadership skills
and confidence to help successfully
launch their careers in academia.
The University must commit to
fixing the pipeline problem if it is se
rious about improving faculty diver
sity. We must continue to provide
and improve guidance, inspiration
and support for those who show po
tential in pursuing a career in acade
mia. In 2006, African-American and
Latino students made up only 3.2

percent and 4.9 percent, respectively,
of graduate students studying the
humanities. Those stats broke down
to 1.2 percent and 5.9 percent for the
natural sciences, and 3.4 percent and
5.9 percent for the social sciences,ac
cording to numbers provided by the
Office of the University Registrar.
The editorial board does not ask
that the University establish a quota
system or bring in sub-par professors
for the sake of adding minority facul
ty. We also believe that a commit
ment to faculty diversity does not
simply mean a commitment to hiring
faculty of color. Stanford should also
focus on recruiting more women in
departments where they arc under
represented. Hiring professors who
focus on LGBT and social class is
sues also contributes to the intellec
tual diversity at Stanford. These
groups, among others, are often ig
nored in discussions about faculty di
versity. but they are equally impor
tant to enhancing the diversity at
Stanford.
Rather, we ask the University to
commit not only to finding superior
professors but also to retaining
them. More diligent and concentrat
ed efforts should be made for our
faculty diversity to be more reflec
tive of the diversity in our student
body. The editorial board sincerely
hopes that, in less than another forty
years, we will be able to cross the last
of the 10 demands off of the "Taking
Back the Mic" list.
