Amid the sea of red and white
balloons that lined Palm
Drive and the influx of Stan
lord alumni for Reunion Homecom
ing. another Stanford anniversary
was celebrated earlier this month.
Alumni from across the world gath
ered to commemorate the 40th an
niversary of "Taking Back the Mic."
an historic event in which 70 mem
bers of the Black Student I Jnion - on
the night of Martin Luther KingJr.'s
assassination - gave the University a
list of 10 demands to improve the
quality of life for minority students.
The 40th anniversary of this im
portant event provides us a chance to
look back on the numerous efforts
the University has taken since that
pivotal moment in history.The edito
rial board would like to take this mo
ment to applaud the University for
the many strides it has made.The in
crease of undergraduate diversity
and the proportional representation
of minority groups, as well as the shift
in financial aid from loans to grant
based packages, are proof that much
from that list has been accomplished
in the past 40 years.
Today, we inhabit a very different
Stanford from the one of 1968. Stu
dents of color make up about half of
the student body. The resources pro
vided to ethnic and cultural commu
nities today are unparalleled by
those of the l%os.'lTie meaning of di
versity has also expanded to include
members of the LCiB I community,
students with disabilities and low-in
come students, and these and other
groups are now given administrative
support that was lacking half a centu
ry ago. At long last.quotas for female
applicants have been eliminated.
But before we mark the list of 10
demands ascomplete.it is imperative
that we look ;it the w;ivs in which the
University has fallen short. In 40
years, one of those 10 demands has
yet to be fully realized: the call for
faculty diversity.
Though our student body has
grown infinitely more diverse, facul
ty diversity has experienced a less
dramatic increase. In 2006, faculty of
color constituted 1K.4 percent of the

faculty, based on ;i report issued to
the Faculty Senate. But some groups
are making bigger strides than oth
ers.even though they still have a long
way to go. Asian/Asian-American
faculty, reported as I2.fr percent of
faculty in 2006. have been increasing
steadily with the addition of 105 new
faculty members over the course of
10 years. Though the numbers for
women are still dismal, they too
made gains, comprising 24.3 percent
of 112 acu 11 y. 38 pe rce nt of dean s. 30 per
cent of associate deans and 57 per
cent of the advisory board in 200h.
Numbers of underrepresented
minority faculty (including African
Americans. Native Americans and
Latinos), however, have shown little
to no growth in the last few years. In
that same 10-year time span. Stan
lord saw the introduction of only
nine new African-American faculty
members and 15 Hispanic faculty
members. Native Americans saw no
increase, remaining at only three fac
ulty members.Together, these under
represented minority groups consti
tuted only live percent of Stanford's
faculty in 2006.
Our undergraduate population is
praised for being on the forefront of
diversity, with a student body that is
24 percent Asian-American, 11 per
