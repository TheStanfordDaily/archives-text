# Congratulations to Stanford's Activist Seniors
## 
### 
On this day of proud accomplishment for all the graduating Seniors and their families, we wish to acknowledge the young people who,
in addition to studying hard, have used their time at Stanford as activists, striving towards the creation of a better world. They have done
the difficult work - the work which is often criticized and resisted by those in power. They work for economic and social rights, women's
rights, immigrants' rights. They defend the environment and the Constitution. They seek a world free of discrimination, where all
people will live in peace. We celebrate them. And we look forward to great things from them in the future.
