# A time for reconciliation for the ASSU

As Stanford's political commu
nity recovers from one of the
more divisive election sea
sons in recent memory, the editorial
board hopes to take this chance to re
mind incoming undergraduate sena
tors and the newly-elected Execu
tives of why they wanted to get in
volved in the ASSU in the first place,
and what the student body wants it to
otter.
While the past ASSU Undergrad
uate Senate session was marked by
bickering both within the body and
with outside groups (including The
Daily), ASSU Executives Jonny
Dorsey and Fagan Harris did much
to refurbish the ASSU's moribund
image. We hope the incoming group
of elected students looks past the re
cent dust-up over late-breaking en
dorsements and pointed personal
emails, and asks how best to emulate
the public-relations success of our
current ASSU Execs.
When interviewing Executive
candidates last week, the editorial
board heard three Executive slates
sing praises of Dorsey and Harris.
Each slate made its own argument as
to why it would be the successor best
able to carry on the Dorsey/Harris
legacy — Gobaud/de la Torre and
Hauser/Sprague emphasized their
commitment to public service and
desire to expand the outgoing team's
sustainability initiatives, while Just A
Couple Of Affable, Public Service-
Oriented Guys Trying To Help The
Student Body Exercise Its Voice

We hope the
incoming group of
elected students
looks past the
recent dust-up

tween Our Peers And The
Faculty/Administrative Complex
touted their ability to follow in
Dorsey/Harris' footsteps and touch
elbows in a show of undying unity.
Last year, no slate would have
bragged that it was most like its pred
ecessors.
While the editorial board did not
have the pleasure of interviewing all
47 Undergraduate Senate candi
dates, we imagine that few — except,
perhaps, the incumbents — would
have compared themselves to an Un
dergraduate Senate that most stu
dents consider a do-nothing group of
bloviates taking themselves far too
seriously. It may be asking a lot, but
we challenge the incoming batch of
senators to carry themselves in such
a way so that candidates next year —
rather than devising ever-more
questionable puns on their names

and slapping them on their campaign
flyers — will campaign on the basis
of their ability to continue the Sen
ate's excellent work.
The editorial board is also wary of
the conspicuous role that factions like
Students for a Better Stanford (SBS)
and the Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) played in the political
process this year, and their continuing
prominence will likely undermine the
Senate's ability to reinvent itself. Like
George Washington in his famous
farewell address, who decried parties
as engines "by which cunning, ambi
tious and unprincipled men will be
enabled to subvert the power of the
people," we are suspicious that these
coalitions have little to do with pro
moting students' well-being and all
too much to do with self-promotion.
We do not dispute the right of these
groups to exist, but would hope that
any such coalition would refrain from
the vapid sloganeering common in
the campaigns and focus instead on
the issues.
Unfortunately, there do not seem
to be many substantial differences in
the elected candidates' platforms, or
at least none that they highlighted in
their campaign flyers. In a letter to
the editor last Wednesday, Senate
candidate Anton Zietsman '12 asked
the Stanford community to think of
the two coalitions not as bitter rivals,
but partners that will work together
to address the Senate's business. We
hope, for the sake of the Senate and
that of the ASSU, that Zietsman's
conception of the two groups takes
shape, preventing the Senate from
devolving into a battleground.
