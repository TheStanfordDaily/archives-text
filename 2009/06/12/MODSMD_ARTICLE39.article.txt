Yuppie suburbia, quaint local gem or hop
ping college hangout? Palo Alto strives to <Jo
it all. Hut the city is in the midst of a town-and
gown schism, townies say.
"Palo Alto has distinct demographics to
target," said local bookstore owner Faith Bell.
"The city has definitely changed from when I
grew up here."
Currently caught in a three-way tug of war
as the playground of venture capitalists, the
sleepy city of affluent locals and the college
town of 6.0(H) restless undergrade our neigh
bor to the north attempts to be a Renaissance
town while maintaining its suburban charm.
But Palo Alto fails in the college town re
spect, students say.
"1 wouldn't say that Palo Alto is a college
town as much as it's a CEO town," said
William Vijverberg '10. "Palo Alto just does
n't have that homey feel of a college town."
Yet despite this absence of collegiate
charm, students still take the Marguerite or
make the eight-minute bike ride downtown
to eat. drink and browse in what a 2007 Cold
well Banker survey named America's most
expensive college town.
Cafe Crowd and Gastronomic Gang
Palo Alto boasts almost as many cafes and
restaurants as it does Oriental rug shops. But
choosing one among the bevy of cafe-studded
streets can be a daunting task.
According to Ayeesha Lalji '11. ambiance
is key.
"The Stanford Bubble can be claustropho
bic, so it's nice to get out and have a complete
change of scene," Lalji said. "1 enjoy restau

rants where you can feel completely detached
from campus. 1 really like Kan Zeman. for in
stance. because they have things like authen
tic Turkish coffee and belly dancing to create
a totally different scene."
Araceli Flores '11. however, has two more
specific criteria for cafe choice — coffee and
study environment. Coupa Cafe, an airy
Venezuelan-style coffee joint, has both, she
said.
"Coupa has amazing pastries and mochas,
and I love to munch while I study, so that's a
plus." Flores commented. Plus, she added,
cafes in Palo Alto are nice in that you can see
a mix of community members — soccer
moms, entrepreneurs and locals.
Vijverberg likes the Palo Alto cuisine
choices, but tries to limit his Palo Alto grub-in
take because prices are so exorbitant.
"Price targeting is way too high." he said.
"There's no way that a college student is
going to blow $35 to $40 a meal. Half of the
restaurants are that expensive."
Vijverberg does admit, however, that
when parents come to town. Palo Alto's culi
nary quality isn't one to be missed.
"When my parents come to Stanford, I hit
all the amazing Palo Alto restaurants," he
said."Normally I can't afford that."
TheTownies' Take
A staple of any university town is the old
fashioned local bookstore, but due to sky
rocketing rent prices. Bell's Books is the last
of the quintessentially collegiate independent
shops in Palo Alto.
Owner Faith Bell remembers a time when
the town had a community of mom-and-pop
bookstores, but notes that with the introduc
tion of bigger chains. Palo Alto's independent

integrity is becoming a casualty to multi
branch corporations.
Luckily, the bookstore has survived what
Bell calls the "travesty of corporate take
over."
Bell credits this survival solely to the
store's proximity to Stanford.
"The University is a huge part of our world
— Stanford shapes Palo Alto in more ways
than the townies are familiar with," she said.
"The kind of intellectual life, the research
that's being done, all have a huge impact on
our world. We wouldn't exist in this form in a
place that was not a university town."
Gordon Biersch Manager Andrew Arm
strong said that while his sports bar attracts
students for Stanford football and basketball
games, the campus' insular nature has kept its
students from having much of a presence.
"Due to the high level of academics. I think
you see a lot less student activity as far as
going out — it's so much an on-campus sort
of school." Armstrong explained. "And as a
whole. I'd say that Stanford students are more
high-maintenance and picky than most peo
ple in their age group. Palo Alto reflects that."
W hose College Town?
Vijverberg blames Palo Alto's marketing
demographic as the prime feature that bars it
from being a "typical" college town.
"It's true that Palo Alto is a byproduct of
Stanford, but it's not really directed toward
undergrads." he said. "The city is directed
more toward the business that comes out of
Stanford than to the current students them
selves. As a result. Palo Alto is way too expen
sive to be a college town."
Daniel Philpot "09 thinks that Palo Alto's

lack of appeal to undergrads is more a fact of
being in a time warp.
"The city is not incorporated into the cam
pus very well." he says. "It's not so much a
place where college kids are going to hang out
and have fun. It's much more a mid-2()sor-30s
town for richer business people."
Coupa Cafe manager Jean Paul Coupal
'07. however, feels that his cafe is a good fit
with the Stanford cafe crowd.
"Palo Alto and Stanford complement each
other very nicely." he said. "The Stanford
community intertwines itself with the town to
create a really special relationship."
The Future of Palo Alto
One way or another. Palo Alto is inextrica
bly linked to Stanford. But who will win the
town-and-gown tug of war?
Vijverberg believes the city is going to the
yuppies.
"Noah's Bagels was one of the few stu
dent-oriented places in Palo Alto." he remem
bered. "But it shut down last year and turned
into a Tibetan goods store. Now that's great
for the Tibetans at Stanford, but I feel like
most students would prefer cheap bagel sand
wiches."
Flores, nonetheless, is optimistic about the
future of Palo Alto as a Mecca for Stanford
students.
"It seems like Stanford students are invad
ing Palo Alto and sort of actively remaking it
into a college town."she says."lf the city spon
sored more bars, a mainstream theater or
more student-related activities, there would
be much more of a connection between the
University and the town, which I think would
be reallv nice."

"Palo Alto and Stanford complement each
other very nicely." he said. "The Stanford
community intertwines itself with the town to
create a really special relationship."
The Future of Palo Alto
One way or another. Palo Alto is inextrica
bly linked to Stanford. But who will win the
town-and-gown tug of war?
Vijverberg believes the city is going to the
yuppies.
"Noah's Bagels was one of the few stu
dent-oriented places in Palo Alto." he remem
bered. "But it shut down last year and turned
into a Tibetan goods store. Now that's great
for the Tibetans at Stanford, but I feel like
most students would prefer cheap bagel sand
wiches."
Flores, nonetheless, is optimistic about the
future of Palo Alto as a Mecca for Stanford
students.
"It seems like Stanford students are invad
ing Palo Alto and sort of actively remaking it
into a college town."she says."lf the city spon
sored more bars, a mainstream theater or
more student-related activities, there would
be much more of a connection between the
University and the town, which I think would
be reallv nice."
