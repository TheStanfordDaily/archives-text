Condoleezza Rice will formally return to Stan
ford on March 2. said her chief of staff, Colby Coop
er. Rice has been settling into her Hoover Institu
tion office in recent weeks, and her staff arrived on
campus Dec. 15 to prepare for her return.
The former Secretary of State will not immedi
ately return to teaching but has publicly stated she
expects to work on a book and eventually return to
the classroom. She will also participate in Hoover
task forces dealing with issues including national
security, according to Hoover Senior Associate Di
rector Richard Sousa.
Stanford administrators and some of Rice's old
est friends applaud her renewed relationship with
the University, though others who oppose Bush ad
ministration policies or clashed with her as provost
are less enthusiastic.
"Prof. Rices return to Stanford will provide our
students and the academic community with a great
opportunity to learn from her experience in public
service and international affairs," University Presi
dent John Hennessy told The Daily in a statement.
"We are proud and pleased that she has chosen to
return to her faculty appointment and to pursue her
future teaching and research interests here."
Future as a Political Science Professor
While Rice will not immediately return to the
classroom, a number of professors look forward to
her interactions with students.
Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at Hoover, be
lieves Rice has a lot to contribute in terms of foster
ing policy debate, providing analysis and engaging
students.
"Many people will want to find ways to discuss
and evaluate her role as Secretary of State and. pre
vious to that.as National Security Advisor, in an ex
tremely controversial period and one in which the
United States did things that were very troubling,
frankly," Diamond said.
When Rice will resume teaching, however, is
still unclear.
Coit Blacker, director of the Freeman Spogli In
stitute, is one of Rice's close personal friends and
has known her for close to 30 years through teach
ing and writing together. He suggested that the for
mer Secretary of State would need some time to
decompress.
"She is at a point in her career where she can de
fine her relationship with Stanford." Blacker said.
"She's been on a professional treadmill that most
people would find utterly exhausting for the last 15
years. So it's really up to her to define the nature of
her relationship with the University going forward.
She's just trying to catch her breath now. I don't
think she's thought very hard about it."
Chair of the Political Science Department
James Fearon said he had not spoken to Rice per
sonally about teaching, but added that Rice would
be able to return to teaching should she wish to. He
said that if she resumed her role as an active facul

ty member in the department, she will have teach
ing obligations, as all faculty do.
Blacker explained that it was difficult for him to
think of Rice on campus for any period of time
without going back to the classroom.
"She considers Stanford her home," he said. "I
don't think she would ever leave Stanford in that
sense. I don't think she would ever resign her pro
fessorship. She loves this institution."
Blacker added, however, that Rice has always
been a bit restless.
"If there is a really interesting challenge that
comes her way, I have no doubt that she would
seize that opportunity, as long as she can take an
other leave of absence from Stanford," he said.
Enthusiasm for Her Return
Though Rice has made enemies in the political
sphere, the professor has many friends and sup
porters on campus, particularly at Hoover.
George Shultz. former Secretary of State under
President Reagan and distinguished fellow at
Hoover, was pleased to hear of her return to cam
pus and is looking forward to interacting with an
other high-level policy-maker.
"She's a gifted person — intellectually, musical
ly and in terms of capacity of friendship and good
conversation," he said.
Political Science Prof. Stephen Krasner arrived
at Stanford the same year that Rice did (1981) and
is glad to see her return. He explained that over the
years, the two spent a lot of time together, sharing
similar interests in everything from political theory
to tennis.
"She's a good tennis player; she hits the ball
hard." Krasner joked.
Krasner went on to work for the National Secu
rity Council and then reported directly to Rice as
director of policy planning at the State Depart
ment. He believes Rice was successful in her time
as Secretary of State.
"She was very proactive about linking the U.S.
with the Europeans in terms of negotiating with
Iran." he said. "She was very committed to the Six
Points talks with North Korea."
Thinking back to their time together in Wash
ington. Krasner pointed out that Rice was an excel
lent athlete and musician. He noted that Rice
played the piano regularly with a small group of
musicians in Washington and was very talented.
"As Secretary of State, she decided to take up
golf." he said. "She actually got to be a decent golf
player, which is not something you expect given the
demands of the job."
He added that Rice had an active social calen
dar in Washington, making time for her friends de
spite her near around-the-clock schedule.
"She's kept her friends through all her stages of
her life," he said. "The people that she knew when
she came to Stanford, when just a research scholar
in 1981 — many of those people are people she's
still friendly with."
Opposition to Rice
But Rice's return will not be celebrated by all.

She made a number of enemies during her tenure
as provost, and some of those wounds have yet to
heal a decade later. Her role in the controversial
administration of President George W. Bush has
only exacerbated feelings of ill will among some
professors.
Few of her objectors deny Rice's right to return
as a tenured professor, but some are dismayed with
her choice to come back.
Political Science Prof. Emeritus Hubert Mar
shall said that, although he personally liked Rice,
he believes professors should not mix policy-mak
ing with teaching because it precludes objectivity.
Rice's case, he said, was exacerbated by her in
volvement in the controversial Iraq War and accu
sations that the Bush administration endorsed tor
ture and the denial of habeas corpus in Guan
tanamo Bay.
"People who've been working at Washington at
that level are going to be preoccupied with their
place in history," Marshall said. "Almost all of
them write books and almost all of their books are
defensive. I've never known the highest-level per
son to say, 'Well. I was wrong."'
"I know that nobody who teaches in the social
sciences is absolutely objective, but 1 do think
that the rank and file of those people who teach
in the social sciences really make an effort to be
objective," he added. "People who have really
been policy-makers just really can't meet that
test."
Political Science Prof. Emeritus Charles Drek
meier similarly believed Rice's image had been
compromised by her time in Washington, though
he admitted she has the right to be at Stanford.
"Why she didn't extricate herself [from the
Bush administration] I can't understand." Drek
meier said. "She compromised her integrity in
ways that will make it hard for her to be trusted ..
. ITiere is no question that she colluded in the de
nial of the use of instruments of torture."
Even though Rice has the right to return. Polit
ical Science Prof. Emeritus John Manley said stu
dents and faculty should not keep their objections
quiet.
"The fact that she's tenured and that the admin
istration would welcome her back is no reason for
people at Stanford who object to her return to sti
fle themselves," he said. "People have a right to
speak out whether she's tenured or not."
"I cannot think of Condi as my former colleague
without her hands stained by the blood of over
4,0(X) American soldiers and untold numbers of
Iraqis." Manley added.
Blacker, however, emphasized that he hoped
the Stanford community would give Rice time to
readjust. He said that regardless of what one thinks
of the policies and the conduct of the Bush admin
istration. the mental, emotional and physical de
mands that were placed on the former Secretary of
State were extreme.
"I hope people will suspend judgment about
what Condi's return means until Secretary Rice
has time to figure out what her return means." he
said.
