## B Doctor takes skills on the road Stanford alumnus serves as medical director for the San Francisco 49ers 
### JACOB JOHNSON 
At the end of Dr. Daniel
Garza's Sports Medi
cine class on Friday, he
and his two teaching
assistants, Brice Rol
ston and Tyler Johnston, will not be
headed back to the office: instead,
they will board a plane to New Or
leans with the San Francisco 49ers.
Garza, a Stanford undergradu
ate'9l and medical school '00 alum
nus. is a fabulous teacher and an en
tertaining lecturer in I luman Physi
ology, as well as an assistant profes
sor in surgery and orthopedic sur
gery. But more importantly, tor
sports fans that is. he also serves as
the medical director for the 49ers
— one of the NFL's most storied
franchises.
Garza began working with the
team in 2006 when 49ers co-owner
Dr. John York decided to transfer
the team's medical care to Stanford
Hospital. Dr. William Maloney,
chair of the Department of Ortho
pedic Surgery at Stanford, helped
develop a relationship with 49ers
management, and soon afterward
Stanford became the primary
provider for nil of the team's med
ical care. It was the first such part
nership between an Ni l. organiza
tion and a major research universi
ty.
"I happened into it almost by
chance." Garza said of his position
with the 49ers. "Dr. York wanted to
find a non-surgeon [from Stanford]
to work with the team, and I was
available."
After working with Stanford
student-athletes,Garza was initially
reluctant to expand beyond the
Farm.
"Stanford students are great
they're smart, helpful and funny,"
he said. "I wasn't sure what to ex
pect from an NFL population."
But what he found was a group
of hardworking men — profession
als in every sense of the word.
"The level of professionalism
within the organization was impres
sive." Garza said.
Although he enjoyed his role as
medical provider to the team,
Garza immediately began thinking
of ways to maximize the opportuni
ty to better serve some of the
world's most elite athletes.
"There are many benefits of the
relationship with [the 49ers],"
(iarza said, speaking from his office
at the Sports Medicine Center in
the Arrillaga Family Sports and
Recreation Center. "It allows us to
work with a unique population. It
also gives the University and hospi
tal great exposure."
Recognizing the opportunity to
do groundbreaking work in the

field of sports medicine with the
NFL, Garza turned to Stanford stu
dents to help develop and carry out
new research projects.
ITiere are currently two research
assistants (RAs) working with him
and the 49ers. Johnston graduated
from Stanford in 2006 with a bache
lor's degree in human biology and
stayed on the Farm to get his MS in
mechanical engineering in "08, and
he will enter Stanford's School of
Medicine next fall. As a master's
student. Johnston even designed a
custom pad for a 49ers player after
an injury interrupted his season.
Rolston, a 2007 Stanford grad
who also majored in human biolo
gy. has been working with Garza for
three years. Last year he was a full
time RA in the Sports Medicine
Center, and he began doing re
search with the 49ers last fall. Rol
ston was also a four-year member of
the Stanford men's gymnastics
team and a four-time Academic All-
American.
Johnston and Rolston have been
working on two main research proj
ects with the team.The first aims to
study heat dissipation in elite ath
letes via infrared (1R) thermogra
phy. Based on previous work done
by the Heller lab in collaboration
with the Stanford football team.
Garza and his assistants have been
using IR cameras to measure how
professional football players re
lease heat after intense physical ac
tivity.
"Heat-related illnesses result in
lost practice time and can even led
to more serious complications,"
Rolston said. "This is why we be
lieve that tracking and characteriz
ing heat dissipation and illness is
very important."
The death of Vikings offensive
tackle Korey Stringer in August of
2001 highlights the importance of
this research. Stringer weighed
about 335 pounds — a hefty, but
not unusual, size for an NFL line
man. On the first day of training
camp, he had trouble keeping his
body temperature down. Deter
mined to get back to work with his
teammates, he suited up for prac
tice the next day, where he col
lapsed. When Stringer reached the
hospital, his temperature was an as
tounding 108 degrees — the bud
ding star ;it left tackle died less than
24 hours later.
A number of other heat-related
illnesses have occurred among NFL
and collegiate players over the
years, including the hospitalization
of Philadelphia Eagles defensive
end Chris ("lemons this summer.
The tragic losses and dangerous
hospitalizations highlight the im-
portance ol the preventative power
of sports medicine.
"The most important thing is a
human life." said Jeff Ferguson, the
49ers' head athletic trainer. Current
ly in his third year with the team. Fer
guson joined the San Francisco fran
chise after spending almost a decade
as the director of sports medicine at
Kansas State.
" I"he players are very savvy." he
said. "They are able to read pretty
quickly if you're in it as a fan or if
you're trustworthy."
According to Ferguson, Garza
and his researchers have gained a
high level of trust by acting profes
sionally and making an effort to "get
to know the players." Stanford's rep
utation as an elite academic institu
tion has helped as well.
"The Stanford name gains a level
of trust [from the players] right
away." Ferguson added.
Garza further stressed the impor

tance of trust in the locker room. In
the NFL. players are often surround
ed by people trying to get something
from them — monetary benefits or
increases in social status, for example
— so it is of the utmost importance
for outsiders to quickly establish
their credibility.
"The lack of secondary gain on
the RAs' part gives them credit and
trust with the players — and [Rol
ston and Johnston] are good at what
they do," he said.
Rolston has been working on the
IR thermography project for the past
two seasons, and the research team
has presented the results at confer
ences in Las Vegas and Hawaii. They
will also be presenting at an upcom
ing academic meeting in Chicago.
Rolston takes measurements dur
ing practices and games, roaming the
sidelines with an IR camera that
looks like a flashlight with a rain
bow-tinted lens. The device is accu
rate from a considerable distance, so
he can give the players their person
al space and still get accurate data.
NFL players spend a lot of time in
the spotlight, and they don't want an
other camera shoved in their faces

— especially when they are trying to
catch a breather in the middle of a
game.
"Portability and a low profile are
key for collecting game-time data."
Rolston said just before kickoff of
the 49ers' 31-13 victory over the De
troit Lions last Sunday. "We wanted
something that was small and didn't
look like a camera, so the new [IR
camera] is awesome."
The other main project underway
involves impact sensors and is still in
the developmental stage. Garza and
his RAs are using technology devel
oped by Zephyr, a New Zealand
based company, to design an "impact
vest" that will measure the force of
impacts to the body during games.
The sensors are thin, soft pads
that are placed over important parts
of the torso, including the kidneys
and liver.To keep them in place.they
are sewn into pockets in the players'
compression garments. A wireless
transmitter is clipped into the shoul
der pads and instantly relays data to
a computer on the sidelines.
"The system provides immediate
feedback on the severity of impacts
and the potential for injuries," John

"The most impor
tant thing is a
human life."
JEFF FERGUSON,
49ers' head athletic trainer

stun said. "There is a need for this
technology because MRIs and other
imaging modalities are hard to do
quickly and can't be done on the
field"
The impact sensors and IR cam
era can also help protect players
from themselves. The NFL is a
"tough guy" league, and rarely will a
player take himself out of action
even when he is in pain. Therefore,
technologies that provide doctors
and trainers with accurate, quantita
tive information about a player's

health can he very useful.
A recent incident involving
Green Bay Packers defensive back
Al Harris highlights the need lor ob
jective technologies. This past Sun
day. Harris collided with teammate
A.J. Hawk in the first quarter. He
came out of the game on the next
play and told team trainers that he
felt pain in his stomach, but he re
fused to stay on the sidelines.
It wasn't until he later discovered
blood in his urine and went to the
hospital that doctors discovered that
his spleen had ruptured. Surgery will
likely be necessary, and Harris
should make a full recovery — but
one more hit could have resulted in
massive internal bleeding and a seri
ous threat to his life.
Right now. the "impact vest" is
merely a prototype. It only gives ap
proximate forces, and Johnston and
Rolston are working on ways to bet
ter process their data in order to give
real-time force measurements.
"This is clinical, real life-oriented
research," Johnston said. "Eventual
ly, [the impact vest'] will be able to
monitor more physiological parame
ters such as heart and breathing

rates, contributing to an overall un
derstanding of the stresses encoun
tered during intense exertion."
Both Johnston and Rolston can
barely contain their excitement
when talking about their work. Not
only are they doing original re
search. but they have worked with
everyone from NFL players and
equipment staff to medical person
nel and team owners. It is an oppor
tunity of a lifetime, one that is only
possible at a place like Stanford. But
it is an opportunity they have earned
through skill and hard work.
"I'm happy to provide this oppor
tunity to Brice and Tyler," Ferguson
said. "They are contributing to sport
science knowledge and are provid
ing a direct service to the team ...
Their research will one day allow
medical professionals at all levels to
make better informed decisions."
Students interested in learning
about sports injuries from the med
ical director of an NFL team should
take Garza's Hum Bio 139: Sports
Medicine. Lectures are Wednesday
and Friday, 11 a.m. to 12:15 p .m.
There are frequent guest lecturers,
all experts in their fields.

research," Johnston said. "Eventual
ly, [the impact vest'] will be able to
monitor more physiological parame
ters such as heart and breathing

rates, contributing to an overall un
derstanding of the stresses encoun
tered during intense exertion."
Both Johnston and Rolston can
barely contain their excitement
when talking about their work. Not
only are they doing original re
search. but they have worked with
everyone from NFL players and
equipment staff to medical person
nel and team owners. It is an oppor
tunity of a lifetime, one that is only
possible at a place like Stanford. But
it is an opportunity they have earned
through skill and hard work.
"I'm happy to provide this oppor
tunity to Brice and Tyler," Ferguson
said. "They are contributing to sport
science knowledge and are provid
ing a direct service to the team ...
Their research will one day allow
medical professionals at all levels to
make better informed decisions."
Students interested in learning
about sports injuries from the med
ical director of an NFL team should
take Garza's Hum Bio 139: Sports
Medicine. Lectures are Wednesday
and Friday, 11 a.m. to 12:15 p .m.
There are frequent guest lecturers,
all experts in their fields.
At the end of Dr. Daniel
Garza's Sports Medi
cine class on Friday, he
and his two teaching
assistants, Brice Rol
ston and Tyler Johnston, will not be
headed back to the office: instead,
they will board a plane to New Or
leans with the San Francisco 49ers.
Garza, a Stanford undergradu
ate'9l and medical school '00 alum
nus. is a fabulous teacher and an en
tertaining lecturer in I luman Physi
ology, as well as an assistant profes
sor in surgery and orthopedic sur
gery. But more importantly, tor
sports fans that is. he also serves as
the medical director for the 49ers
— one of the NFL's most storied
franchises.
Garza began working with the
team in 2006 when 49ers co-owner
Dr. John York decided to transfer
the team's medical care to Stanford
Hospital. Dr. William Maloney,
chair of the Department of Ortho
pedic Surgery at Stanford, helped
develop a relationship with 49ers
management, and soon afterward
Stanford became the primary
provider for nil of the team's med
ical care. It was the first such part
nership between an Ni l. organiza
tion and a major research universi
ty.
"I happened into it almost by
chance." Garza said of his position
with the 49ers. "Dr. York wanted to
find a non-surgeon [from Stanford]
to work with the team, and I was
available."
After working with Stanford
student-athletes,Garza was initially
reluctant to expand beyond the
Farm.
"Stanford students are great
they're smart, helpful and funny,"
he said. "I wasn't sure what to ex
pect from an NFL population."
But what he found was a group
of hardworking men — profession
als in every sense of the word.
"The level of professionalism
within the organization was impres
sive." Garza said.
Although he enjoyed his role as
medical provider to the team,
Garza immediately began thinking
of ways to maximize the opportuni
ty to better serve some of the
world's most elite athletes.
"There are many benefits of the
relationship with [the 49ers],"
(iarza said, speaking from his office
at the Sports Medicine Center in
the Arrillaga Family Sports and
Recreation Center. "It allows us to
work with a unique population. It
also gives the University and hospi
tal great exposure."
Recognizing the opportunity to
do groundbreaking work in the

field of sports medicine with the
NFL, Garza turned to Stanford stu
dents to help develop and carry out
new research projects.
ITiere are currently two research
assistants (RAs) working with him
and the 49ers. Johnston graduated
from Stanford in 2006 with a bache
lor's degree in human biology and
stayed on the Farm to get his MS in
mechanical engineering in "08, and
he will enter Stanford's School of
Medicine next fall. As a master's
student. Johnston even designed a
custom pad for a 49ers player after
an injury interrupted his season.
Rolston, a 2007 Stanford grad
who also majored in human biolo
gy. has been working with Garza for
three years. Last year he was a full
time RA in the Sports Medicine
Center, and he began doing re
search with the 49ers last fall. Rol
ston was also a four-year member of
the Stanford men's gymnastics
team and a four-time Academic All-
American.
Johnston and Rolston have been
working on two main research proj
ects with the team.The first aims to
study heat dissipation in elite ath
letes via infrared (1R) thermogra
phy. Based on previous work done
by the Heller lab in collaboration
with the Stanford football team.
Garza and his assistants have been
using IR cameras to measure how
professional football players re
lease heat after intense physical ac
tivity.
"Heat-related illnesses result in
lost practice time and can even led
to more serious complications,"
Rolston said. "This is why we be
lieve that tracking and characteriz
ing heat dissipation and illness is
very important."
The death of Vikings offensive
tackle Korey Stringer in August of
2001 highlights the importance of
this research. Stringer weighed
about 335 pounds — a hefty, but
not unusual, size for an NFL line
man. On the first day of training
camp, he had trouble keeping his
body temperature down. Deter
mined to get back to work with his
teammates, he suited up for prac
tice the next day, where he col
lapsed. When Stringer reached the
hospital, his temperature was an as
tounding 108 degrees — the bud
ding star ;it left tackle died less than
24 hours later.
A number of other heat-related
illnesses have occurred among NFL
and collegiate players over the
years, including the hospitalization
of Philadelphia Eagles defensive
end Chris ("lemons this summer.
The tragic losses and dangerous
hospitalizations highlight the im-
portance ol the preventative power
of sports medicine.
"The most important thing is a
human life." said Jeff Ferguson, the
49ers' head athletic trainer. Current
ly in his third year with the team. Fer
guson joined the San Francisco fran
chise after spending almost a decade
as the director of sports medicine at
Kansas State.
" I"he players are very savvy." he
said. "They are able to read pretty
quickly if you're in it as a fan or if
you're trustworthy."
According to Ferguson, Garza
and his researchers have gained a
high level of trust by acting profes
sionally and making an effort to "get
to know the players." Stanford's rep
utation as an elite academic institu
tion has helped as well.
"The Stanford name gains a level
of trust [from the players] right
away." Ferguson added.
Garza further stressed the impor

tance of trust in the locker room. In
the NFL. players are often surround
ed by people trying to get something
from them — monetary benefits or
increases in social status, for example
— so it is of the utmost importance
for outsiders to quickly establish
their credibility.
"The lack of secondary gain on
the RAs' part gives them credit and
trust with the players — and [Rol
ston and Johnston] are good at what
they do," he said.
Rolston has been working on the
IR thermography project for the past
two seasons, and the research team
has presented the results at confer
ences in Las Vegas and Hawaii. They
will also be presenting at an upcom
ing academic meeting in Chicago.
Rolston takes measurements dur
ing practices and games, roaming the
sidelines with an IR camera that
looks like a flashlight with a rain
bow-tinted lens. The device is accu
rate from a considerable distance, so
he can give the players their person
al space and still get accurate data.
NFL players spend a lot of time in
the spotlight, and they don't want an
other camera shoved in their faces

— especially when they are trying to
catch a breather in the middle of a
game.
"Portability and a low profile are
key for collecting game-time data."
Rolston said just before kickoff of
the 49ers' 31-13 victory over the De
troit Lions last Sunday. "We wanted
something that was small and didn't
look like a camera, so the new [IR
camera] is awesome."
The other main project underway
involves impact sensors and is still in
the developmental stage. Garza and
his RAs are using technology devel
oped by Zephyr, a New Zealand
based company, to design an "impact
vest" that will measure the force of
impacts to the body during games.
The sensors are thin, soft pads
that are placed over important parts
of the torso, including the kidneys
and liver.To keep them in place.they
are sewn into pockets in the players'
compression garments. A wireless
transmitter is clipped into the shoul
der pads and instantly relays data to
a computer on the sidelines.
"The system provides immediate
feedback on the severity of impacts
and the potential for injuries," John

"The most impor
tant thing is a
human life."
JEFF FERGUSON,
49ers' head athletic trainer

stun said. "There is a need for this
technology because MRIs and other
imaging modalities are hard to do
quickly and can't be done on the
field"
The impact sensors and IR cam
era can also help protect players
from themselves. The NFL is a
"tough guy" league, and rarely will a
player take himself out of action
even when he is in pain. Therefore,
technologies that provide doctors
and trainers with accurate, quantita
tive information about a player's

health can he very useful.
A recent incident involving
Green Bay Packers defensive back
Al Harris highlights the need lor ob
jective technologies. This past Sun
day. Harris collided with teammate
A.J. Hawk in the first quarter. He
came out of the game on the next
play and told team trainers that he
felt pain in his stomach, but he re
fused to stay on the sidelines.
It wasn't until he later discovered
blood in his urine and went to the
hospital that doctors discovered that
his spleen had ruptured. Surgery will
likely be necessary, and Harris
should make a full recovery — but
one more hit could have resulted in
massive internal bleeding and a seri
ous threat to his life.
Right now. the "impact vest" is
merely a prototype. It only gives ap
proximate forces, and Johnston and
Rolston are working on ways to bet
ter process their data in order to give
real-time force measurements.
"This is clinical, real life-oriented
research," Johnston said. "Eventual
ly, [the impact vest'] will be able to
monitor more physiological parame
ters such as heart and breathing

rates, contributing to an overall un
derstanding of the stresses encoun
