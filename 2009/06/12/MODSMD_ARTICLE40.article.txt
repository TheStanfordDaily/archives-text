## B Doctor takes skills on the road Stanford alumnus serves as medical director for the San Francisco 49ers 
### JACOB JOHNSON 
At the end of Dr. Daniel
Garza's Sports Medi
cine class on Friday, he
and his two teaching
assistants, Brice Rol
ston and Tyler Johnston, will not be
headed back to the office: instead,
they will board a plane to New Or
leans with the San Francisco 49ers.
Garza, a Stanford undergradu
ate'9l and medical school '00 alum
nus. is a fabulous teacher and an en
tertaining lecturer in I luman Physi
ology, as well as an assistant profes
sor in surgery and orthopedic sur
gery. But more importantly, tor
sports fans that is. he also serves as
the medical director for the 49ers
— one of the NFL's most storied
franchises.
Garza began working with the
team in 2006 when 49ers co-owner
Dr. John York decided to transfer
the team's medical care to Stanford
Hospital. Dr. William Maloney,
chair of the Department of Ortho
pedic Surgery at Stanford, helped
develop a relationship with 49ers
management, and soon afterward
Stanford became the primary
provider for nil of the team's med
ical care. It was the first such part
nership between an Ni l. organiza
tion and a major research universi
ty.
"I happened into it almost by
chance." Garza said of his position
with the 49ers. "Dr. York wanted to
find a non-surgeon [from Stanford]
to work with the team, and I was
available."
After working with Stanford
student-athletes,Garza was initially
reluctant to expand beyond the
Farm.
"Stanford students are great
they're smart, helpful and funny,"
he said. "I wasn't sure what to ex
pect from an NFL population."
But what he found was a group
of hardworking men — profession
als in every sense of the word.
"The level of professionalism
within the organization was impres
sive." Garza said.
Although he enjoyed his role as
medical provider to the team,
Garza immediately began thinking
of ways to maximize the opportuni
ty to better serve some of the
world's most elite athletes.
"There are many benefits of the
relationship with [the 49ers],"
(iarza said, speaking from his office
at the Sports Medicine Center in
the Arrillaga Family Sports and
Recreation Center. "It allows us to
work with a unique population. It
also gives the University and hospi
tal great exposure."
Recognizing the opportunity to
do groundbreaking work in the

field of sports medicine with the
NFL, Garza turned to Stanford stu
dents to help develop and carry out
new research projects.
ITiere are currently two research
assistants (RAs) working with him
and the 49ers. Johnston graduated
from Stanford in 2006 with a bache
lor's degree in human biology and
stayed on the Farm to get his MS in
mechanical engineering in "08, and
he will enter Stanford's School of
Medicine next fall. As a master's
student. Johnston even designed a
custom pad for a 49ers player after
an injury interrupted his season.
Rolston, a 2007 Stanford grad
who also majored in human biolo
gy. has been working with Garza for
three years. Last year he was a full
time RA in the Sports Medicine
Center, and he began doing re
search with the 49ers last fall. Rol
ston was also a four-year member of
the Stanford men's gymnastics
team and a four-time Academic All-
American.
Johnston and Rolston have been
working on two main research proj
ects with the team.The first aims to
study heat dissipation in elite ath
letes via infrared (1R) thermogra
phy. Based on previous work done
by the Heller lab in collaboration
with the Stanford football team.
Garza and his assistants have been
using IR cameras to measure how
professional football players re
lease heat after intense physical ac
tivity.
"Heat-related illnesses result in
lost practice time and can even led
to more serious complications,"
Rolston said. "This is why we be
lieve that tracking and characteriz
ing heat dissipation and illness is
very important."
The death of Vikings offensive
tackle Korey Stringer in August of
2001 highlights the importance of
this research. Stringer weighed
about 335 pounds — a hefty, but
not unusual, size for an NFL line
man. On the first day of training
camp, he had trouble keeping his
body temperature down. Deter
mined to get back to work with his
teammates, he suited up for prac
tice the next day, where he col
lapsed. When Stringer reached the
hospital, his temperature was an as
tounding 108 degrees — the bud
ding star ;it left tackle died less than
24 hours later.
A number of other heat-related
illnesses have occurred among NFL
and collegiate players over the
years, including the hospitalization
of Philadelphia Eagles defensive
end Chris ("lemons this summer.
The tragic losses and dangerous
hospitalizations highlight the im-
