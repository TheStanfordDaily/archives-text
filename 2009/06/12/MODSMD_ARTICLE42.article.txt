With a post-season berth on the
line, the Cardinal came up short
21 points short.
C'al defeated Stanford in the
111 th annual BigGame.37-16,dash
ing the Cardinal's hid for its first
howl appearance in seven years.
Stanford's performance was un
characteristic of its typically solid
play throughout the season: junior
Toby Gerhart had a fumble in the
red /one; senior Aaron Xagory
missed a short field goal and a PAT;
the defense was fooled on a number
of key plays; the offensive line,
which was often considered the best
m the Pacific-10 Conference, fal
tered more than a few times; and
Tavita Pritchard threw three inter
ceptions
"We shot ourselves in the foot,
coach Jim Harbauch said. "We had

way too many things to overcome
that were self-inflicted."
"We really heat ourselves today."
Pritchard added. "There were too
many missed opportunities."
Which isn't to take anything
away from the Golden Bears, who
Harbaugh acknowledged beat the
( ardinal in "all phases of the game."
Cal's Jahvid Best put together one of
the best performances of his young,
yet already superb career:The soph
omore rushed for 201 yards and two
touchdowns, averaging more than
10 yards per carry, and added an ad
ditional 35 yards and a score receiv
ing.
Best started quickly, rushing for
bO yards on a lateral on the Bears'
second offensive play of the after
noon. But, he was abetted by a Stan
ford miscue: senior safety Bo Mc-
Nally had Best wrapped up in the
hack field, but the shifty Cal runner
escaped, reversed field and made it
down to the Cardinal's 14-vard line.

Giorgio Tavecchio's field goal four
plays later gave ( al its first points of
the game.
Later in the first quarter, after
holding the Bears offense to a three
and-out. Stanford had a chance to
respond, as Pritchard. Gerhart and
Anthony Kimble drove the Cardi
nal down to Cal's eight-yard line to
set up a 25-yard field goal attempt
for Zagory.who had been near auto
matic all season. But the senior
pushed the ball wide, and the score
remained 3-0.
Still.the C ardinal was in good po
sition, especially after MeNally re
deemed himself for his earlier mis
cue by intercepting a Kevin Riley
pass in the end /one on the Bears'
ensuing drive. On its next posses
sion. Stanford once again found it
sell deep in Cal territory.The Cardi
nal came into Saturday s game as
one of the nation's leaders in red

Junior Stanford signal-caller Tavita Pritchard and his Cardinal teammates couldn't handle C al on Nov. 22 at Memor
ial Stadium. The Golden Bears looked beatable in the first half, which ended with Stanford trailing just 10-3, but roared
out with 27 points in the second half to cement a win.
