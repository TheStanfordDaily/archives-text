With a post-season berth on the
line, the Cardinal came up short
21 points short.
C'al defeated Stanford in the
111 th annual BigGame.37-16,dash
ing the Cardinal's hid for its first
howl appearance in seven years.
Stanford's performance was un
characteristic of its typically solid
play throughout the season: junior
Toby Gerhart had a fumble in the
red /one; senior Aaron Xagory
missed a short field goal and a PAT;
the defense was fooled on a number
of key plays; the offensive line,
which was often considered the best
m the Pacific-10 Conference, fal
tered more than a few times; and
Tavita Pritchard threw three inter
ceptions
"We shot ourselves in the foot,
coach Jim Harbauch said. "We had

way too many things to overcome
that were self-inflicted."
"We really heat ourselves today."
Pritchard added. "There were too
many missed opportunities."
Which isn't to take anything
away from the Golden Bears, who
Harbaugh acknowledged beat the
( ardinal in "all phases of the game."
Cal's Jahvid Best put together one of
the best performances of his young,
yet already superb career:The soph
omore rushed for 201 yards and two
touchdowns, averaging more than
10 yards per carry, and added an ad
ditional 35 yards and a score receiv
ing.
Best started quickly, rushing for
bO yards on a lateral on the Bears'
second offensive play of the after
noon. But, he was abetted by a Stan
ford miscue: senior safety Bo Mc-
Nally had Best wrapped up in the
hack field, but the shifty Cal runner
escaped, reversed field and made it
down to the Cardinal's 14-vard line.

Giorgio Tavecchio's field goal four
plays later gave ( al its first points of
the game.
Later in the first quarter, after
holding the Bears offense to a three
and-out. Stanford had a chance to
respond, as Pritchard. Gerhart and
Anthony Kimble drove the Cardi
nal down to Cal's eight-yard line to
set up a 25-yard field goal attempt
for Zagory.who had been near auto
matic all season. But the senior
pushed the ball wide, and the score
remained 3-0.
Still.the C ardinal was in good po
sition, especially after MeNally re
deemed himself for his earlier mis
cue by intercepting a Kevin Riley
pass in the end /one on the Bears'
ensuing drive. On its next posses
sion. Stanford once again found it
sell deep in Cal territory.The Cardi
nal came into Saturday s game as
one of the nation's leaders in red

Junior Stanford signal-caller Tavita Pritchard and his Cardinal teammates couldn't handle C al on Nov. 22 at Memor
ial Stadium. The Golden Bears looked beatable in the first half, which ended with Stanford trailing just 10-3, but roared
out with 27 points in the second half to cement a win.
zone efficiency, yet on its first two long drives, Stanford
could not convert.This time, Gerhart fumbled on the 10-
yard line: six plays later, Cal extended its lead to 10-0.
"It's unacceptable," said Gerhart of his fumble. "It was
aTD.it was wide open.That kills, that's going to hurt for a
long time."
"We couldn't put the ball in," senior center Alex
Fletcher said. "We didn't execute."
Stanford was able to tack on a field goal before the
half, so despite its self-inflicted wounds, the Cardinal was
only a touchdown away from tying the game.
Harbaugh. though, was unsatisfied.
"We could have had 10 more points at least," he said.
As soon as the teams returned from the locker room,
everything seemed to go downhill for the Cardinal.
Pritchard was intercepted in his own territory on the first
play of the second half, which led to a Cal touchdown.
"It sailed on me a little bit." said Pritchard of his inter
ception, which was badly overthrown. "That can't hap
pen."
The worst, though, was yet to come: Cal scored two
more touchdowns in just over four minutes to give the
Bears a commanding 30-3 advantage. Facing a massive
deficit, Stanford was largely forced to abandon its run
game, which had been the strength of its offense all season
long.
"When you get down, you have to get quick scores —
you can't grind it out," Gerhart said.
For a short time, the Cardinal looked as if it might vet
position itself for a miraculous comeback: After Cal
scored once more, Pritchard hooked up with Doug Bald
win for a 34-yard touchdown. Stanford recovered the en
suing on-side kick, and just a few plays later. Gerhart
found the end zone.The Bears were held to a three-and
out on their next drive, and Pritchard drove Stanford into
Cal territory. With another score, the Cardinal would cut
the Bears' lead to just two touchdowns with plenty of time
remaining.
Stanford's hopes ended, though, when Michael Mo
hamed intercepted Pritchard on the Cal IN-yard line.
"We left a lot of things on the table." Fletcher said.
The senior's words were not just reflective of Big
Game, but the season as a whole. Hie Cardinal lost a num
ber of hard-fought battles — the team held leads against
UCLA and Oregon in the final two minutes, but were

beaten in the closing seconds. For a squad that finished its
year just one win away from howl eligibility, it's a trou
bling fact to consider.
"We have to finish drives, finish games and finish sea
sons." Harbaugh said.
"We were a couple of minutes away from being 8-4 or
7-5." said Gerhart. who broke Tommy Vardell's 'Ml school
single-season rushing record in the contest, but refused to
even show even a hint of celebration in light of the loss.
Despite its disappointing end to the year, after the
game the Cardinal seemed to unanimously acknowledge
the progress that had been made throughout the past two
seasons.
"A lot of standards were met," Harbaugh said. "Some
things were a success, some things weren't."
Fletcher, an Ail-American candidate and a mainstay
on Stanford's offensive line throughout his tenure on the
Farm, was reflective of his time as a Cardinal, which saw
the program sink to the lowest depths of Division I. only
to rise back up again.
"Maybe we'll look back on these days as the building
blocks," he said.
To that end. Harbaugh and his players were optimistic
about the prospects of the program. Whereas this year's
aim was. in part.to be bowl-eligible, the stakes are raised
for next season.
"A bowl is not enough at this point." Pritchard said."As
things get better, expectations rise."
"The goal next year." Harbaugh said, "is to be BCS
bowl championship-eligible."
Notes: Clinton Snyder fractured his ankle against Cal.
and will be out until the second half of spring practices.
Sophomore ( hike Amajoyi replaced Snyder at middle
linebacker, and earned the praise of Pat Maynor, who
came back to the Stanford lineup after a one-game ab
sence ... Wopamo Osaisai. playing in his final game with
the Cardinal, hurt his knee late in the contest, but x-rays
came back negative ... Perhaps the biggest question now
for Stanford is whether or not Gerhart will be back for his
senior season. Last week, the junior, who also plays base
ball for Stanford, told the San Jose Mercury News that if
he is selected in the MLB amateur draft in June and of
fered a contract in excess of a million dollars, he would
leave the Farm.
