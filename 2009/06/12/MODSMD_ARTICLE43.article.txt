It came in overtime and nearly two full
weeks after any real chance at the NCAA
Tournament had faded away. The season fi
nally came to an end for the Stanford men's
basketball team in the third round of the Col
lege Basketball Invitational. Oregon State
topped the Cardinal, 65-62 in Corvallis last
Wednesday.
It was fitting that the Cardinal's final op
ponent on the season was the Beavers — it
was against Oregon State (16-17.7-11 Pac-10)
that Stanford (20-14.6-12 Pac-10) suffered its
greatest losses and rose to one of its greatest
victories of the season. On Jan. 24. the
Beavers trounced the Cardinal to drop its
conference record to below .500 and start a
three-game losing streak. On Feb. 19. Oregon
State beat Stanford again, in the midst of a
stretch in which the Cardinal lost eight of 10
games.
But on March 11. Stanford turned the ta
bles on the Beavers. The Cardinal toppled
Oregon State in Los Angeles in the play-in
game of the Pacific-10 Conference Tourna
ment. 62-54. The win capped off a stretch in
which the Cardinal went 3-1 against confer
ence foes, seeming to lend the team some mo
mentum and hope of rolling through the Pac
-10 field to an automatic berth in the NCAA
Tournament.
While that hope was dashed the next day
against Washington, the Cardinal still seemed

to maintain some of its momentum against
Boise State and Wichita State in the first two
rounds of the CHI. winning both contests hv
double-digit margins. But against a partisan
crowd in Corvallis. that run came to an end.
Nevertheless, Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins was proud of the effort his team dis
played in his first season at the helm of the
Cardinal program.
"They were amazing," Dawkins said fol
lowing the loss. "They gave everything they
had. They changed systems, changed styles,
defense and offense.Those kids have been re
markable, and I wanted to share that with the
younger guvs from the standpoint that they
have set an amazing example about what
Stanford is all about: the kind of effort, the
kind of enthusiasm, and to be good at every
thing they do. We shared those moments.They
were great.
"We cried together and we shared an
amazing moment, and that's what it should be
like." he continued. "You should end the sea
son laughing, or you should end the season
crying."
Stanford hung with the Beavers through
out the seesaw battle, which had the lead
change hands 10 times through regulation
and one overtime period. Senior forward
Lawrence Hill even hit a dramatic jumper
with just one second remaining in regulation
to tie the game at 54 and send the contest into
overtime.
But in that extra period. Oregon State ral-
