## Stanford Recruiting: The players 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
Originally published on Nov. 21, 2008, the
following examined Stanford football's re
cruiting procedure. The story was broken
into three parts: the process, the pitch and the
academics and the players. This is part three:
the players.
One was a valedictorian;one was recruit
ed as both a student and a football player;
and one was a walk-on.
Freshmen Andrew Luck and Chris
Owusu and sophomore Ryan Whalen rep
resent part of the wide spectrum of talent
that head coach Jim Harbaugh and his staff
have recruited to Stanford.
Since coming to the Farm two years ago,
Harbaugh has made a point of recruiting
nationally,and not confining the Cardinal to
only pursuing West Coast talent. Landing
Luck, a quarterback from Houston, was a
result of that effort.
Luck was the centerpiece of Stanford's
2008 recruiting class. At 6-foot-4, 227
pounds, he was ranked as the No. 4 quarter
back recruit in the country by Scouts.com,
and as the No. 1 most accurate passer by Ri
vals.com. Luck, who is currently redshirting,
is widely considered to be the Cardinal's
starting quarterback of the future. In fact,
earlier in the season. Luck was as high as
No. 2 on Stanford's depth chart before Har
baugh committed to the season-long red
shirt.
At the height of Luck's recruitment,
Stanford had barely begun its 2(X)7 season
— the memory of a terrible 2006 season,
when the team went 1-11. was omnipresent.
With a new coach at the helm, uncertainties
about the Cardinal football program
abounded.
Why. then.did Luck, who received offers
from prestigious football powerhouses like
Alabama, commit to Stanford?
For the Cardinal true freshman, the vale
dictorian of his high school class, academics
played a major role in the decision, making
the recruiting process a bit easier.
"This is one of the best universities in the
world." he said.'i didn't need much selling."
That didn't stop the Stanford staff from
actively pitching him on the University's
merits. Harbaugh. along with co-defensive
coordinator and linebackers coach Andv

Buh and running backs coach Willie Tag
gart, made visits to Houston to watch and
meet with Luck.
"They all came for dinner," Luck said.
"(Harbaugh) is a charismatic man and a fun
guy to talk to. It was a nice opportunity to be
recruited."
The chance to play BCS football, while
still receiving the high-level education that
he desired, was enough to lock down I .uck's
commitment.
"He could get the full package here,"
said defensive line coach and recruiting co
ordinator Lance Anderson.
The combination ot academics and foot
ball proved to be just right for Owusu as
well. The speedy, sure-handed freshman —
who has taken over the Cardinal's kick re
turning duties and is a top reserve on the re
ceiver depth chart — hails from California
powerhouse Oaks Christian and was one of
the first players from the class of 2008 to
commit to Stanford.
"It was a short process for me," he said.
Owusu. like Luck, was both a top recruit
and a fine student in high school and, ac
cording to Harbaugh, was being recruited
by the University before he was recruited
by its football program. I lis devotion to ac
ademics was so strong that, despite offers
from a number of Division 1 schools — in
cluding stellar academic institutions like
Vanderbilt and Virginia — his final choice
came down to Stanford or 1 iarvard.
But. the Crimson plays in the Football
Bowl Subdivision, a step below Division I.
"Academics played a role, but I wanted
to play Pac-10 football," Owusu said.
Still, I iarbaugh and his staff made sure to
cement Owusu's commitment. Buh
watched Owusu's practices, and Harbaugh
had dinner with the family.
"That was a good feeling," said Owusu
about Harbaugh's visit to his home. "That
secured my commitment. It made it very
personal."
"I really hit it off with them," I larbaugh
said about his visits with both Luck and
Owusu. "I liked them very much — they're
two quality young guys.There's love in both
those houses."
While Luck and Owusu have similar re
cruiting stories, Whalen's is far different.
The Cardinal's leading receiver in 2008
was a recruited walk-on in 2007, meaning

that while coaches urged him to commit to
Stanford, they could not offer him a scholar
ship. Every year, Harbaugh has about 18-25
scholarships that he can offer to recruits.
But. he is still interested in landing players
who just miss the cut — the 26th and 27th
prospects.
"No successful program can operate
without a strong walk-on program," said
Assistant Athletic Director and Director of
Football Administration Mike Eubanks.
Whalen was one of those walk-ons. but
despite scholarship offers from other Divi
sion I schools, he decided to commit to Stan
ford. where he would have to pay his own
way.
"I came to camp before my senior year,"
Whalen said. "It seemed right for me — I
enjoyed the guys and I liked the staff."
"When players come on visits, we treat
everyone as gold," Eubanks said. "Can you
imagine if we blew off Ryan Whalen? He
would have gone elsewhere."
Whalen took far longer to commit to
Stanford than Luck and Owusu did. as he
had to weigh the costs of walking on versus
taking a scholarship elsewhere.
"I sat down with coach Harbaugh and my
dad. and he was very upfront with me,"
Whalen said.
Eventually, Whalen decided to sign with
Stanford.
"I worked hard in my high school classes,
and that's something you can always count
on: football is not forever." he said. "But I
was confident in myself and my ability to
win a scholarship."
His self-assurance and work ethic paid
off: Two weeks into his first training camp
before his freshman year, Whalen was
awarded a scholarship. Now, the sophomore
is a sure-handed target who has won the
confidence of his quarterbacks — he leads
Cardinal receivers in both receptions and
yards.
Luck, Owusu and Whalen are a micro
cosm of the different roads players take to
the Farm. Whether they are among the na
tion's most highly touted recruits or walk
ons who will have to fight for a scholarship,
they will all draw the eye of Harbaugh and
his staff.
"We're always evaluating, and all our
coaches do it." I larbaugh said."We're trying
to get the best."
