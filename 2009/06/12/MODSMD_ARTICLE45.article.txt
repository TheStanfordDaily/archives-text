Stanford women's soccer's quest for its
first ever NCAA title fell just short on Fri
day, as the team lost 1 -0 to Notre Dame in
the College Cup semifinal in Cary. NC.
Despite the final score, it was a game that
the Cardinal dominated for large stretch
es, but in the end. luck was not on the Car
dinal's side as it failed to advance against
the Irish.
The first ten minutes of the match were
uneventful, with Stanford content to feel
out Irish keeper Kelsey Lysander with
long-range efforts and Notre Dame not
taking any shots. But the Irish got the
game's first big chance in the 13th minute.
2006 NCAA player of the year Kerri
Hanks put fellow forward Melissa Hen
derson clean through on goal, but sopho
more goalkeeper Kira Maker made a bril
liant point-blank save to keep the ball
out.
Maker could do nothing two minutes
later though, when she again found her
selt in a one v. one situation after Hender
son had played in Courtney Barg. Barg
slotted the ball past a diving Maker to
give the Irish an early lead.
Henderson almost doubled the advan
tage in the 21st minute. The forward
found herself unmarked in the box on a

Notre Dame free kick hut hit her volley
just over the net. From that point on.
though, the game was dominated by the
Stanford women.
One minute later, junior Kelley
O'Hara had the Card's first great chance
of the match. O't lara outran two defend
ers to get onto a long hall hv freshman
Lindsay Taylor, hut saw her attempt to
poke the hall between Lysander's legs
saved by the Notre Dame keeper.
O'Hara was once again at the center of
the action in the 27th minute, when she
nutmegged her defender on the left and
sent in a hard cross right to Christen
Press. Hut the sophomore's header was
right at Lysander.
Stanford would come close one more
time before hall'timc. with freshman mid
fielder Cami Levin hitting the crossbar on
a chip from outside the box in the 39th
minute. Although the Cardinal was down,
it certainly was not yet out.
The second half was almost complete
ly dominated by the Cardinal, as the team
went in search of the crucial equalizer.
Ten minutes into the half. Press made a
run down the right wing and swung in a
cross. Although the ball was deflected,
O'Hara rose high to meet it, but could not
get her header down on goal.
With 15 minutes remaining. Stanford
threw everything it had at the Irish goal.
First O'Hara once again got her head on a

cross, this time from junior fullback Alicia
Jenkins, but could not get enough power
on the header to get it past the keeper.
Then Stanford's other junior fullback, Ali
Riley, worked her way down the left flank
and sent a cross right to Taylor, who saw
her header saved. One minute later, sen
ior defender Allison Falk won a header
off of a Taylor free kick, but once again
the shot went right at Lysander. No mat
ter who was shooting for the Cardinal, the
results were the same, as the Stanford
women just couldn't quite get the hall
across the goal line.
As it turned out. Falk's header was
Stanford's last shot of the match — there
would be no late heroics as there were in
the previous two rounds. The Cardinal
players gave it their all until the final
whistle, but the Irish were determined to
keep the ball as far away from their goal
as possible and managed to hang on for
the victory.
It was a frustrating end to what was a
fantastic season for the Cardinal women,
one in which the team not only made it to
its first College Cup in 15 years, but did so
while playing some of the most exciting
soccer in the country. While their season
did not end with a trophy, they left Cary
with the nation's respect and sent a clear
message out to the college soccer world:
don't expect it to be another 15 years be
fore the (Cardinal is back.
