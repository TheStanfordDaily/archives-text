Stanford women's basketball's
2(X)8-2(X)9 season came to humbling
conclusion Sunday night as the Car
dinal fell to top-seeded Connecticut.
83-64 in semifinal play at St. Louis'
Scottrade Center.
Four Husky players finished with
double-digit points, while Stanford's
Jayne Appel tied UConn's Renee
Montgomery in scoring with 26. The
defeat marked the end of a 20-game
Cardinal winning streak and dashed
any hopes for this year's squad to
earn the school's third national title.
UConn, meanwhile, will proceed to
Tuesday's championship game
against Louisville, which defeated
Oklahoma in Sunday's first semifinal
game.
Stanford (33-5) was the last team
to defeat Connecticut, eliminating
them in last year's semifinals by a
score of 82-73. Sunday's rematch.

however, was all UConn. The
Huskies (38-0) won the opening tip,
and continued to control the ball for
most of the first half. After just six
minutes of play, the Cardinal had
turned the hall over six times and had
taken it away from UConn only
once.The Huskies took advantage of
Stanford's offensive missteps, scor
ing 13 points off turnovers in the first
half, while holding the Cardinal to
only two. UConn threw Stanford's
defense off its game as well, attack
ing from all angles and positions.
Four Husky players had at least one
field goal after only four minutes of
play.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer was impressed by the pre
paredness of the Huskies.
"They're an extremely aggressive,
athletic team "she said."Their whole
team came out and made plavs that
they had to make.'lTiey don't make a
lot of mistakes, and they don't take
bad shots."
Stanford certainly had its chances

to score, trailing the Huskies in at
tempted shots hy only five after the
first half (29 to 34) and one after 40
minutes (62 to 63). Most of the Car
dinal shots came from leading scorer
Jayne Appel. who tallied 10 of Stan
ford's first 14 points. She played with
toughness, leading the Cardinal to a
14-13 lead midway through the first
half with two consecutive baskets,
one coming after she took a hard fall.
Appel received relatively little
help as the game went on. however,
and that small lead proved to he the
only time Stanford wasn't playing
catch-up to UConn. No other Cardi
nal player had more than four points
until kayla Pederson scored at the
10:15 mark, hy which point Appel
had scored 17. Free throws and
three-pointers proved to he a strug
gle as well — Stanford didn't score in
either category until well into the
second half.
VanDerveer, while insisting her
team made a solid effort on rebounds
and other areas, acknowledged her

team's struggle to find the basket, es
pecially in the first half.
"We took some bad shots, I
thought, early." she said. "Some
quick shots. We missed some shots
that we needed to make. We really
have to help ourselves more by
knocking down shots and making
free throws.Those are things that as a
team we have to do to be able to stay
in it."
UConn didn't give Stanford a
chance to find its swagger after the
intermission, opening up the second
half with a 13-0 run led by Renee
Montgomery and Maya Moore, who
finished the game with a combined
50 points. Despite a series of substi
tutions by VanDerveer, Stanford
simply couldn't find an answer to
UConn's dynamic offense, and with
12:09 left, found itself buried in a 60-
29 hole — by far the biggest deficit
Stanford has faced all season. While
the Cardinal was able to open up its

with a strong tourney showing.
offense a bit after this point, outscor
ing UConn 25-23 over the final 12
minutes, it was simply too late to
climb back into competition.
Connecticut head coach Geno
Auriemma. giving credit to Stanford
for a great season, was proud of his
team's performance.
"I can't say enough about the ef
fort these kids put forth, especially
defensively." he said. "(Moore and
Montgomery] were unbelievable.
Everyone was just so determined to
play one more game."
The ( ardinal. meanwhile, is tak
ing the loss in stride. Despite the lop
sided defeat, the women seemed far
from discouraged. Many of them, in
cluding sophomore guard Jeanette
Pohlen, believe that Sunday's loss
will only help improve their team.
"We're young." Pohlen said. "We
have our All-American, [Jayne

A ppel],coming hack and we're just a
young team that's still growing. The
fact that we made it this far is amaz
ing. ()! course, making the finals was
our goal, but we've still accom
plished a lot. We know what we can
do. we know what we are capable of.
and I think we'll just keep getting
better and better."
VanDerveer showed confidence
that her team could indeed learn
such lessons from Sunday's loss, cit
ing the game as an example of the
strong character her team already
possesses.
"The best thing that happened
was the fact that when things were
not going our way. our kids stayed
with things really well." she said.
"They competed.They weren't snip
ing at each other. They didn't have
excuses when they came to the
bench. I was so proud of that. We've
really grown up a lot this season.
The Huskies may be the ones
moving on. But in a way. so too are
the Cardinal women, setting their
sights on the 2009-2010 season in
which all but two players will return.

The team's attitude, even after the
semifinals loss makes it obvious that
despite the score Sunday, the Pac-10
Champion Stanford women have
much to be proud of and plenty to
look forward to.

and I think we'll just keep getting
better and better."
VanDerveer showed confidence
that her team could indeed learn
such lessons from Sunday's loss, cit
ing the game as an example of the
strong character her team already
possesses.
"The best thing that happened
was the fact that when things were
not going our way. our kids stayed
with things really well." she said.
"They competed.They weren't snip
ing at each other. They didn't have
excuses when they came to the
bench. I was so proud of that. We've
really grown up a lot this season.
The Huskies may be the ones
moving on. But in a way. so too are
the Cardinal women, setting their
sights on the 2009-2010 season in
which all but two players will return.

The team's attitude, even after the
semifinals loss makes it obvious that
despite the score Sunday, the Pac-10
Champion Stanford women have
much to be proud of and plenty to
look forward to.
