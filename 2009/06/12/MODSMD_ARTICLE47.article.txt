Heading into the NCAA Cham
pionships, the Stanford women's
open-weight rowing team was called
a long shot. Now. it can only he called
one thing: the national champion.
The Cardinal rowed its way to
victory on Sunday, fending off Cali
fornia and Yale by three points to
take home an NC'Aa team champi
onship.
"The feeling of winning a nation
al title is surreal." said freshman and
All-Pacific-10 Conference coxswain
Jenna Levy.
In a tight battle at Cooper River
Park in Cherry Mill. N.J. Stanford's
trip toward the title was anything
but easy, and had to have all three
boats place well.
"Last year, only our varsity eight
boat was invited to the NCAA's and
this year, we wanted to show that our
entire team was capable of compet
ing at the highest level," Levy said.
"Stanford, one of the smallest row
ing programs in the country, was
able to qualify all three boats into
the Grand Finals â€” one of only four
schools to achieve this."
Sunday began with the Grand
Final of the varsity four boats. The
Cardinal started off in the third posi
tion and kept the spot well into the
race. I lowever. the boat began to slip
and eventually finished the race in
fifth place, jusl .29 seconds behind
Cal.
Stanford, though, continued to
battle with Cal in the next race, the
second varsity eight Grand Final.
The Cardinal paced itself just .26
seconds behind the Golden Bears in
the race and held its position for
quite some time. However, in the
final stretch, the Yale boat came out
of nowhere to surprise the Bay Area
rivals. Stanford still found itself in
decent position, finishing third in the
race to set up the most dramatic race
of the meet.
The varsity eight boat knew it had
to be at its best in the Grand Final in
order for Stanford to have a shot at
the title. However, with a clump of
elite teams at the top of the stand
ings. the team title was still up for
grabs. It was time for the Cardinal to
prove that its No. 1 national ranking
was not a fluke.
"Competing at the N( A As is un
like any other race or competition."
Levy said. "The races at the NCAAs
are unpredictable."
Stanford began the race with a
very tight lead over Virginia and Cal
in second and third, respectively. Cal
began to drop back, eventually fin
ishing sixth, but the Cavaliers hung
tight.The ( ardinal had slightly more
than a one-second lead heading into
the final S(H) meters and prepared it
self for a dramatic fight to the finish.
In the end. the Stanford women
prevailed, winning gold in the event
with a time of 6:11.95 .37 seconds
better than Virginia. The varsity
eight boat also propelled Stanford to

its first team title in the history of the
program.
"When the varsity eight boat
crossed the finish line, we couldn't
tell if we had sneaked out the win be
cause the margins were so close,"
Levy said. "When an official finally
came over to tell us that we had got
ten first, the boat broke down in
tears and smiles. It was then that our
entire team came storming onto the
dock as we pulled our boat in."
"As we landed, we found out that
because the varsity eight finished
first. Stanford won the overall team
trophy and we were national cham
pions." she continued. "That was the
best moment of the weekend, know
ing that without the effort of every
person on our team, the team trophy
would not have been attainable."
All-Pac-10 sophomore Grace
Luczak echoed her teammates
thoughts.
"Our varsity boat landed on the
dock after the race as our team stam
peded towards us screaming that our
boat had won and that we also won
the team championship." she said. "I
will always remember that moment:
it was so amazing hearing from our
teammates that we won the team
championship."
The open-weight rowers thus
joined the men's gymnastics team as
national champions for Stanford's
2008-2009 season. With the victory.
Stanford moves one step closer to its
15th consecutive Director's Cup.
"I can remember back to the be
ginning of the season in September
when coach [Yasmin] Farooq asked
our team if we believed we could win
a national championship and. of
course, we all answered yes." Levy
said. "Stanford had to fight its way
into the NCAA Grand Finals and we
wouldn't have had it any other way.
The team trophy at the NCAAs only
validates the hard work and dedica
tion of the people on this team."
All-Pac-10 sophomore File
Logan was optimistic for the future
of the team. too.
"We are a very young team. The
entire varsity K is returning next
year." she said. "Our finish this year
at NCAAs sets a standard for years
to come, but we have tons of im
provements to be made and speed to
be gained throughout the team,
which is a very exciting thing."
The Stanford lightweight women
will attempt to follow the path of the
open-weights as they head to Sacra
mento next weekend for the IRA
National Championships, flic varsi
ty eight will look to feed off of the
momentum created by its rowing
peers.
"We're all really excited and
proud to see the open-weights win
their first national championship."
said lightweight freshman Jenna
Wixon-Genack."Having trained be
side them all year, we know how
hard they've worked for it.and it's
definitely inspiring to see them win."
