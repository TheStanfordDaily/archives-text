Extraordinary. That's about the only word you can use to
sum up the careers of Foluke Akinradewo and Cynthia Bar
boza of the Stanford women's volleyball team.
For four years, Akinradewo and Barboza have been the
focal points of a team that has had some of the best results in
school history: three straight Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships and two appearances in the NCAA Finals. The two
have garnered numerous individual accolades, including a
Player of the Year and multiple All-American and Pac-10 hon
ors.
For Akinradewo, life couldn't have taken a better turn. A
three-sport varsity athlete in high school with an initial love
lor basketball, she never dreamed that she would one day be
donning the Stanford uniform.
"1 was surprised 1 even got recruited, period." she said.
"Just playing on a college team was one thing for me."
Stanford head coach John Dunning admitted that Akin
radewo did not have as much experience and repetitions as
other college volleyball recruits. She was certainly talented,
but did not play club volleyball and thus did not spend much
time on the court. But when she went out for a USA tryout and
scouts saw her abilities, she became a hot commodity.
"She's so physically gifted that at that point she was on
everyone's radar." Dunning said. "Anyone in that circum
stance becomes a high-potential player."
And her potential has been realized, as she will finish her
career at Stanford having left a lasting mark on the Cardinal
program and across the nation. Named the National Player of
the Year last season, Akinradewo is also destined to become
the NCAA's all-time leader in hitting percentage. She posted
the second-highest single-season hitting percentage last sea
son (.499) and going into the postseason,she is hitting .456 this
year. But for Akinradewo, the record isn't what really matters.
"I never thought about any of that," she said of the record
and her personal accolades. "For me it was just about playing
the game and enjoying it. All the stuff just came; just playing
was mv No. I goal."

And the humble senior takes little credit for her accom
plishments.
"That's another thing about volleyball that people tend to
forget," she continued. "Without the people on your team,
without a pass, without a set. none of | the awards, honors,
records] are possible."
For Barboza, the path was quite different. A multi-skilled,
all-everything player in high school, volleyball had consumed
her since she was 14 years old. A two-time National Player of
the Year in high school, she even took a year off of high school
volleyball because she was invited to train with the IJSA team
in preparation for the 2004 Athens Olympics.
But in the middle of her freshman season, Barboza tore her
A( 'I. during a match against Cal.She was sidelined for the rest
of the year and watched Stanford get upset in the second
round of the NCAA Tournament. While some players would
have let an injury like that derail their career, Barboza — with
a little support from her mom — used it as a chance to take a
step back from her hectic life.
"I remember my mom telling me "You got injured in the
best place in the world, you are getting a first-class education,
you have one of the best medical facilities in the country with
in biking distance.'" she said. "(The injury) made me appreci
ate [my college) experience as a whole. My high school career,
everything was volleyball-oriented. Getting injured put every
thing else into perspective, made me appreciate everything I
have here."
Perhaps that attitude was the reason Barboza came back
strong and has been one of the best players in college volley
ball since. She has reached the top of the record charts at Stan
ford in kills, digs and aces and is one of only seven players in
Stanford history to have 1.000 kills and 1.000 digs. Put simply,
she has been an absolute star.
"In this program.to be one of the top five in anything.espe
cially if it's multiple skills, is extraordinary," Dunning said.
Despite their differing paths, together Akinradewo and
Barboza have been the foundation of the Stanford team.Their
play has been outstanding.Their competitive spir its are unpar
alleled.
"Both their accomplishments
are incredible, a tribute to not only
their abilities but the skills they
have taught themselves or have
been taught." Dunning said."[They]
continue to compete the whole
time. It's just extraordinary."
But in the end of the day.the re

suits on the court and the individual
honors mean little to the duo com
pared to the people they have been
able to share the last four years
with. They are part of a senior class
of five that have become best
friends; the bond between them is
nearly inseparable.
"I think it's been kind of a roller
coaster." Barboza said of her Stan
ford career. "But what's been in
credible is being able to go through
it with your best friends.The experi
ence wouldn't have been the same
without them."
Akinradewo couldn't agree
more.
"Freshman year when I got here.
I was thinking. 'This is where I be
long,"' she said. "I couldn't imagine
being at any other school with any
other teammates. And that's held
true for the past four years.
"We are all very different peo
ple. but somehow, some way, when
we come together we just mesh —
especially off the court," Akinrade
wo continued. "It just works for us."
On the court, it's hard to find bet

ter players. Off the court, it's hard to
find others more passionate, caring
and balanced. Their attitudes are
optimistic and contagious: you can't
help but root for them in everything
they do.
"The thing I'm amazed about the
both of them is the time they have
for everything, that they care about
their life being balanced." Dunning
said. "They don't want to be just
known as one thing. They want to
have a lot of things that they are
about."
The volleyball team is about to
embark on yet another trip to the
NCAA Tournament. In four post
season appearances, Akinradewo
and Barboza have pretty much been
through it all. But one thing they
have not experienced is the feeling
of winning a national champi
onship. After coming so close the
past two years, they will do anything
to hoist that trophy in the air.
"That's our goal, we want to win
a national championship." Akin
radewo said. "We have the ability to
[win one]. I think we've done a great
job of improving each week. As we
come to the end. that's going to help
us."
"I'm so happy with this team and
with how we are playing [coming
into the NCAA Tournament]." Bar
boza added. "It's been a really in
credible vibe and atmosphere, and I
hope that feeling takes us to a na
tional championship."
Akinradewo and Barboza are
surely two of the greatest athletes
Stanford has ever seen. Perhaps
more importantly, they are two gen
uine. modest and upstanding
women. When asked what they
would tell the next group of players
coming into the volleyball program,
their answers only accentuated
their positive outlook on life and
volleyball.
"Sitting here now. I wish I could
go back in time, relive the whole
thing over again." Barboza said of
her last four years. "Even knowing
there would be downs, because the
highs were so high."
"It goes by way too fast." Akin
radewo echoed. "Value the friend
ships you have with your team
mates. Enjoy every moment."
The two senior superstars have
certainly enjoyed every moment on
the Farm. Here's to hoping their last
moment can be celebrated by win
ning their first NCAA title.

sum up the careers of Foluke Akinradewo and Cynthia Bar
boza of the Stanford women's volleyball team.
For four years, Akinradewo and Barboza have been the
focal points of a team that has had some of the best results in
school history: three straight Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships and two appearances in the NCAA Finals. The two
have garnered numerous individual accolades, including a
Player of the Year and multiple All-American and Pac-10 hon
ors.
For Akinradewo, life couldn't have taken a better turn. A
three-sport varsity athlete in high school with an initial love
lor basketball, she never dreamed that she would one day be
donning the Stanford uniform.
"1 was surprised 1 even got recruited, period." she said.
"Just playing on a college team was one thing for me."
Stanford head coach John Dunning admitted that Akin
radewo did not have as much experience and repetitions as
other college volleyball recruits. She was certainly talented,
but did not play club volleyball and thus did not spend much
time on the court. But when she went out for a USA tryout and
scouts saw her abilities, she became a hot commodity.
"She's so physically gifted that at that point she was on
everyone's radar." Dunning said. "Anyone in that circum
stance becomes a high-potential player."
And her potential has been realized, as she will finish her
career at Stanford having left a lasting mark on the Cardinal
program and across the nation. Named the National Player of
the Year last season, Akinradewo is also destined to become
the NCAA's all-time leader in hitting percentage. She posted
the second-highest single-season hitting percentage last sea
son (.499) and going into the postseason,she is hitting .456 this
year. But for Akinradewo, the record isn't what really matters.
"I never thought about any of that," she said of the record
and her personal accolades. "For me it was just about playing
the game and enjoying it. All the stuff just came; just playing
was mv No. I goal."

And the humble senior takes little credit for her accom
plishments.
"That's another thing about volleyball that people tend to
forget," she continued. "Without the people on your team,
without a pass, without a set. none of | the awards, honors,
records] are possible."
For Barboza, the path was quite different. A multi-skilled,
all-everything player in high school, volleyball had consumed
her since she was 14 years old. A two-time National Player of
the Year in high school, she even took a year off of high school
volleyball because she was invited to train with the IJSA team
in preparation for the 2004 Athens Olympics.
But in the middle of her freshman season, Barboza tore her
A( 'I. during a match against Cal.She was sidelined for the rest
of the year and watched Stanford get upset in the second
round of the NCAA Tournament. While some players would
have let an injury like that derail their career, Barboza — with
a little support from her mom — used it as a chance to take a
step back from her hectic life.
"I remember my mom telling me "You got injured in the
best place in the world, you are getting a first-class education,
you have one of the best medical facilities in the country with
in biking distance.'" she said. "(The injury) made me appreci
ate [my college) experience as a whole. My high school career,
everything was volleyball-oriented. Getting injured put every
thing else into perspective, made me appreciate everything I
have here."
Perhaps that attitude was the reason Barboza came back
strong and has been one of the best players in college volley
ball since. She has reached the top of the record charts at Stan
ford in kills, digs and aces and is one of only seven players in
Stanford history to have 1.000 kills and 1.000 digs. Put simply,
she has been an absolute star.
"In this program.to be one of the top five in anything.espe
cially if it's multiple skills, is extraordinary," Dunning said.
Despite their differing paths, together Akinradewo and
Barboza have been the foundation of the Stanford team.Their
play has been outstanding.Their competitive spir its are unpar
alleled.
"Both their accomplishments
are incredible, a tribute to not only
their abilities but the skills they
have taught themselves or have
been taught." Dunning said."[They]
continue to compete the whole
time. It's just extraordinary."
But in the end of the day.the re

suits on the court and the individual
honors mean little to the duo com
pared to the people they have been
able to share the last four years
with. They are part of a senior class
of five that have become best
friends; the bond between them is
nearly inseparable.
"I think it's been kind of a roller
coaster." Barboza said of her Stan
ford career. "But what's been in
credible is being able to go through
it with your best friends.The experi
ence wouldn't have been the same
without them."
Akinradewo couldn't agree
more.
"Freshman year when I got here.
I was thinking. 'This is where I be
long,"' she said. "I couldn't imagine
being at any other school with any
other teammates. And that's held
true for the past four years.
"We are all very different peo
ple. but somehow, some way, when
we come together we just mesh —
especially off the court," Akinrade
wo continued. "It just works for us."
On the court, it's hard to find bet

ter players. Off the court, it's hard to
find others more passionate, caring
and balanced. Their attitudes are
optimistic and contagious: you can't
help but root for them in everything
they do.
"The thing I'm amazed about the
both of them is the time they have
for everything, that they care about
their life being balanced." Dunning
said. "They don't want to be just
known as one thing. They want to
have a lot of things that they are
about."
The volleyball team is about to
embark on yet another trip to the
NCAA Tournament. In four post
season appearances, Akinradewo
and Barboza have pretty much been
through it all. But one thing they
have not experienced is the feeling
of winning a national champi
onship. After coming so close the
past two years, they will do anything
to hoist that trophy in the air.
"That's our goal, we want to win
a national championship." Akin
radewo said. "We have the ability to
[win one]. I think we've done a great
job of improving each week. As we
come to the end. that's going to help
us."
"I'm so happy with this team and
with how we are playing [coming
into the NCAA Tournament]." Bar
boza added. "It's been a really in
credible vibe and atmosphere, and I
hope that feeling takes us to a na
tional championship."
Akinradewo and Barboza are
surely two of the greatest athletes
Stanford has ever seen. Perhaps
more importantly, they are two gen
uine. modest and upstanding
women. When asked what they
would tell the next group of players
coming into the volleyball program,
their answers only accentuated
their positive outlook on life and
volleyball.
"Sitting here now. I wish I could
go back in time, relive the whole
thing over again." Barboza said of
her last four years. "Even knowing
there would be downs, because the
highs were so high."
"It goes by way too fast." Akin
radewo echoed. "Value the friend
ships you have with your team
mates. Enjoy every moment."
The two senior superstars have
certainly enjoyed every moment on
the Farm. Here's to hoping their last
moment can be celebrated by win
ning their first NCAA title.
