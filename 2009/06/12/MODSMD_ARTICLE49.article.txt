Stanford women's soccer's quest for its first
ever NCAA title fell just short on Friday, as the
team lost 1-0 to Notre Dame in the College Cup
semifinal in C'ary, NC. Despite the final score, it
was a game that the Cardinal dominated for large
stretches, but in the end. luck was not on the Car
dinal's side ;is it failed to advance against the
Irish.
The first ten minutes of the match were un
eventful. with Stanford content to feel out Irish
keeper Kelsey Lysander with long-range efforts
and Notre Dame not taking any shots. But the
Irish got the game's first big chance in the 13th
minute. 2006 NCAA player of the year kerri
Hanks put fellow forward Melissa Henderson
clean through on goal, but sophomore goalkeep
er Kira Maker made a brilliant point-blank save
to keep the ball out.
Maker could do nothing two minutes later
though, when she again found herself in a one v.

one situation after Henderson had played in
Courtney Barg. Barg slotted the ball past a diving
Maker to give the Irish an early lead.
Henderson almost doubled the advantage in
the 21st minute. The forward found herself un
marked in the box on a Notre Dame free kick but
hit her volley just over the net. From that point
on. though, the game was dominated by the Stan
ford women.
One minute later, junior Kelley O'Hara had
the Card's first great chance of the match.
O'l lara outran two defenders to get onto a long
ball by freshman Lindsay Taylor, but saw her at
tempt to poke the ball between Lysander's legs
saved by the Notre Dame keeper.
O'l lara was once again al the center of the ac
tion in the 27th minute, when she nutmegged her
defender on the left and sent in a hard cross right
to Christen Press. But the sophomore's header
was right at Lysander.
Stanford would come close one more time be
fore halftime, with freshman midfielder ( ami
Levin hitting the crossbar on a chip from outside
the box in the 39th minute. Although the Cardi

nal was down, it certainly was not yet out.
The second half was almost completely domi
nated by the ('ardinal.as the team went in search
of the crucial equalizer.Ten minutes into the half.
Press made a run down the right wing and swung
in a cross. Although the hall was deflected.
O'l lara rose high to meet it. hut could not get her
header down on goal.
With 15 minutes remaining, Stanford threw
everything it had at the Irish goal. First O'l lara
once again got her head on a cross, this time from
junior fullback Alicia Jenkins, but could not gel
enough power on the header to get it past the
keeper.Then Stanford's other junior fullback. Ali
Riley, worked her way down the left flank and
sent a cross right to Taylor, who saw her header
saved. One minute later, senior defender Allison
Falk won a header off of a Taylor free kick, but
once again the shot went right at Lysander. No
matter who was shooting for the C "ardinal, the re
sults were the same, as the Stanford women just
couldn't quite get the ball across the goal line.
As it turned out, Falk's header
was Stanford's last shot of the match
there would he no late heroics as
there were in the previous two
rounds.The Cardinal players gave it
their all until the final whistle, hut
the Irish were determined to keep
the ball as far away from their goal
as possible and managed to hang on
for the victory.
It was a frustrating end to what
was a fantastic season for the Cardi
nal women, one in which the team
not only made it to its first College
Cup in 15 years, but did so while
playing some of the most exciting
soccer in the country. While their
season did not end with a trophy,
they left Cary with the nation's re
spect and sent a clear message out to
the college soccer world: don't ex
pect it to be another 15 years before
the Cardinal is back.
