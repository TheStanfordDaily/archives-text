Rice on Monday faced ques
tions from students regarding
her role in the Bush administra
tion's approval of waterboard
ing terror suspects, denying
both her personal authoriza
tion of the interrogation tech
niques as well as the qualifica
tion of those techniques as tor
ture.
"I didn't authorize any
thing" Rice told a group of
Roble students in a conversa
tion that surfaced on You Tube
Monday night."l conveyed the
authorization of the adminis
tration to the [CIA] that they
had policy authorization sub
ject to the Justice Department's
clearance."
The Associated Press (AP)
reported last week that follow
ing Rice's nod of approval to
then-CIA Director George
Tenet, the Justice Department
approved the use of water
boarding in a top-secret Aug. 1,
2002 memo. That month, al
leged al-Oaida terrorist Abu
Zubaydah underwent water
boarding at least K3 times.
After 2005. the CIA volun
tarily crossed waterboarding
off of its list of interrogation
techniques, according to the
A P.
On Monday. Rice, who
served as National Security Ad
visor to the President before
being appointed Secretary of
State in 2005, defended the
Bush administration's actions
against the label of torture, cit

ing the United Nations Con
vention against Torture, which
entered into force in 1987 and
was signed by the U.S. in 1988.
"The President instructed us
that nothing we would do
would be outside of our obliga
tions — legal obligations —
under the Convention against
Torture," Rice said. "So. by def
inition. if it was authorized by
the President, it did not violate
our obligations under the Con
vention against Torture."
On Guantanamo Bay, Rice
denied the use of torture at the
terrorist detention camp.
"We did not torture any
one," she said. "The ICRC [In
ternational Committee of the
Red Cross] also had access to
Guantanamo, and they made
no allegations about interroga
tions at Guantanamo."
The ICRC did question the
indefinite detention of terror
suspects. Rice noted, hut the
former Secretary of State de
fended the detention by refer
encing the delays in military tri
als that resulted from the
Supreme Court's internal de
bate on whether the President
actually had the authority to try
suspects at Guantanamo Bay.
ITie Monday evening con
versation was captured by
Roble resident Reyna Garcia
Ml, who recorded a six-minute
segment on her digital camera
and then uploaded it to
You Tube. Rice visited the four
class dorm to dine with some 20
residents selected by lottery.
"We wholly recognize that
whenever we are in public,
given modern technology.there
is always the possibility that
[we] are being photographed,
filmed or recorded," said Colby
Cooper. Rice's chief of staff.
