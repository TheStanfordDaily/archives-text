waiting near the bullpen fence.
"Thank god." I thought."But a helmet prob
ably isn't enough. I should be putting on a full
suit of armor."
Wearing flip-flops, jeans, a wrinkled linen
shirt I hadn't bothered to iron and holding a 20-
dollar softball bat that had rattled around my
trunk since the summer, 1 was about to face
Stanford's closer.
A month later. Drew Storen would be suit
ing up for the season opener against Vander
bilt. I lc would jog down to the bullpen as Stan
ford rallied to tie the game in the sixth, and
start to throw as Jordan Pries made his colle
giate debut in the eighth inning.
Crouching on the bullpen mound after he
became warm, the brim of his cap pulled low
and casting his face in a shadow under the
bright lights, he would wait and stare, motion
less and focused, waiting for his moment to
strike. But on that night, the freshman would
shine.The closer wouldn't be needed.
But that was still in the future when he
climbed atop the mound to start his bullpen
session on this sunny. January afternoon.
"Just let me throw a few to get warm." he
said. "Then you can go ahead and step in."
It had seemed like a great idea when I ap
proached Drew as we left class and I asked if I
could stand in while he pitched. I thought the
chance to face a mid-90s fastball and watch the
sharp hook of his slider would be both fascinat
ing and beneficial to my broadcasting and
sports writing.
As I watched him warm up. I started to wish
I hadn't asked.
112 ifteen years ago. he was just like countless
other American boys: learning to throw and
catch from his father in the backyard of their
Indiana home. He played little league and,
even when Storen didn't understand, his father
guided him on a path that would lead him to
success.
"When I came back from my first practice I
was all upset," Storen recalled. "I had to hit
from both sides of the tee because my dad

made me — he wanted me to be a switch hitter.
None of the other kids did so 1 felt like a loner."
But when he first started pitching at eight
years old. he fell in love with the loneliness of
the mound. I le liked the intensity and the feel
ing of facing the hitter alone in a "showdown."
When Storen's attraction to pitching became
clear, his dad took him straight to a pitching
coach to teach him the proper mechanics.
Over the next dozen years, lie steadily im
proved. By his freshman year in high school, he
could throw 74 miles per hour and strike out
the seniors with either his curve-ball or cutter.
Hach year, he became bigger and stronger and
his fastball got just a little faster until he was
breaking 90 and his dream of pitching in the big
leagues was suddenly a real possibility.
The Yankees drafted Storen out of high
school, and colleges recruited him. He visited
Georgia Tech. Auburn and Clemson, but after
visiting Stanford he knew he belonged on the
Farm.
"The old-school uniforms matched their
style of play and I liked that." he said. "I liked
that they hustled everywhere and that they ran
out almost to the foul line to pick everyone up
as they came off each inning . . . when I was on
the flight home. I turned to my dad and told
him that this was where I needed to be."
A year later, he would be pitching for the
Cardinal in the College World Series on 1 SI'N
and in front of 20,000 fans. I was there too. but
perched in the press box and talking into a mi
crophone. I never thought I would actually be
facing him and seeing the pitches that I had
called both "blistering" and "devastating" com
ing right at me.
"Ok. I'm pretty close now." he said as he
fired a bullet over the corner of the plate. "Just
a couple more and you can step in."
I closed my eyes and tried to prepare for
what I had gotten myself into. Part of me jlist
wanted to mumble something about "leaving
my headlights on" and get out of there before
he could finish — his fast balls were so quick I
could actually hear them hum through the air
before they snapped into the catcher's mitt.
My eyes reopened just in time to see his next
pitch: a curveball that failed to break and
whipped past the catcher into the backstop.
Had I been standing in the batter's box. it
would have taken my head off.
" That's why you're going to wear a helmet,"
he said in a tone that made me wonder if he had

thrown it there on purpose. He got the ball
hack, tucked his glove under his arm. turned to
me while rubbing the ball with both hands and.
Clashing a mischievous grin. said,"You can step
in whenever you're ready."
My heart was pounding now. but I forced
mysell to walk towards the plate. I kept telling
myself not to flinch — at this point. I consid
ered being able to stand in for a do/en pitches
without passing out a realistic goal.
Without even asking if I was ready, he
lunged forward and launched a fastball to
wards me. ( oming in about chest high, it whis
tled as it cut through the air and banged into
the catcher's mitt behind me.
It was terrifying.
I straightened up and flicked my bat lightly
at him a few times to disguise my feet slipping
toward the back corner of the box. I could feel
my heart pound in every part of my body. A few
more lastbalis rocketed from his hand and I
could barely see them before they were past
me. If one had come straight for me. I doubt I
would have had time to duck.
By now. my fear was starting to move into
the background and I realized I might actually
survive without injury. But the next pitch lie
unleashed didn't look the same it was com
ing right for my knees.
Panic filled me again but I didn't have time
to react. Just a moment later the pitch was al
ready past, but several feet in front of me.
It was a si icier.
He threw a few more, and each time I was
certain they would either hit me or even pass
behind me. but they always rapidly cut down
and away. Both frightening and fascinating, it
left me baffled over how anyone ever got a hit
at this level in the first place.
Before I could think another thought,
though, another fastball came zipping in a few
inches from my chin. It came in so fast that I
didn't even have time to feel fear, but I was sure
I could actually smell the leather in the air. I
immediately turned around and walked away.
"Are you done?" he asked as he held out his
glove, waiting for the ball.
"Yeah. I've seen enough," I said in a slightly
quivering voice.
He grinned and went back to work. I rested
my softball bat on my shoulder and tried to pet
my heart rate back to normal. I watched a few
more pitches and then turned away, thankful
my job kept me safely inside the press box.

proved. By his freshman year in high school, he
could throw 74 miles per hour and strike out
the seniors with either his curve-ball or cutter.
Hach year, he became bigger and stronger and
his fastball got just a little faster until he was
breaking 90 and his dream of pitching in the big
leagues was suddenly a real possibility.
The Yankees drafted Storen out of high
school, and colleges recruited him. He visited
Georgia Tech. Auburn and Clemson, but after
visiting Stanford he knew he belonged on the
Farm.
"The old-school uniforms matched their
style of play and I liked that." he said. "I liked
that they hustled everywhere and that they ran
out almost to the foul line to pick everyone up
as they came off each inning . . . when I was on
the flight home. I turned to my dad and told
him that this was where I needed to be."
A year later, he would be pitching for the
Cardinal in the College World Series on 1 SI'N
and in front of 20,000 fans. I was there too. but
perched in the press box and talking into a mi
crophone. I never thought I would actually be
facing him and seeing the pitches that I had
called both "blistering" and "devastating" com
ing right at me.
"Ok. I'm pretty close now." he said as he
fired a bullet over the corner of the plate. "Just
a couple more and you can step in."
I closed my eyes and tried to prepare for
what I had gotten myself into. Part of me jlist
wanted to mumble something about "leaving
my headlights on" and get out of there before
he could finish — his fast balls were so quick I
could actually hear them hum through the air
before they snapped into the catcher's mitt.
My eyes reopened just in time to see his next
pitch: a curveball that failed to break and
whipped past the catcher into the backstop.
Had I been standing in the batter's box. it
would have taken my head off.
" That's why you're going to wear a helmet,"
he said in a tone that made me wonder if he had

thrown it there on purpose. He got the ball
hack, tucked his glove under his arm. turned to
me while rubbing the ball with both hands and.
Clashing a mischievous grin. said,"You can step
in whenever you're ready."
My heart was pounding now. but I forced
mysell to walk towards the plate. I kept telling
myself not to flinch — at this point. I consid
ered being able to stand in for a do/en pitches
without passing out a realistic goal.
Without even asking if I was ready, he
lunged forward and launched a fastball to
wards me. ( oming in about chest high, it whis
tled as it cut through the air and banged into
the catcher's mitt behind me.
It was terrifying.
I straightened up and flicked my bat lightly
at him a few times to disguise my feet slipping
toward the back corner of the box. I could feel
my heart pound in every part of my body. A few
more lastbalis rocketed from his hand and I
could barely see them before they were past
me. If one had come straight for me. I doubt I
would have had time to duck.
By now. my fear was starting to move into
the background and I realized I might actually
survive without injury. But the next pitch lie
unleashed didn't look the same it was com
ing right for my knees.
Panic filled me again but I didn't have time
to react. Just a moment later the pitch was al
ready past, but several feet in front of me.
It was a si icier.
He threw a few more, and each time I was
certain they would either hit me or even pass
behind me. but they always rapidly cut down
and away. Both frightening and fascinating, it
left me baffled over how anyone ever got a hit
at this level in the first place.
Before I could think another thought,
though, another fastball came zipping in a few
inches from my chin. It came in so fast that I
didn't even have time to feel fear, but I was sure
I could actually smell the leather in the air. I
immediately turned around and walked away.
"Are you done?" he asked as he held out his
glove, waiting for the ball.
"Yeah. I've seen enough," I said in a slightly
quivering voice.
He grinned and went back to work. I rested
my softball bat on my shoulder and tried to pet
my heart rate back to normal. I watched a few
more pitches and then turned away, thankful
my job kept me safely inside the press box.
