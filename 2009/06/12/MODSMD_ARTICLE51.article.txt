For one weekend a year, tens of thousands
of concertgoers brave the intense desert heat
and trek out to the unlikeliest of locations to
see the three-day wonder that is the Coachel
la Valley Music and Arts Festival. Held on the
Empire Polo Fields in Indio,Calif., the festival
hosts solid big-name lineups from noon to
midnight, Friday through Sunday, and floods
the Coachella Valley with people eager to
wait hours in the 100-degree weather to catch
a glimpse of the performances.
This past weekend was only Coachella's
10th year, but the festival and its organizer.
Goldenvoice. have already achieved national
renown for filling five outdoor stages with a
vibrant and diverse set of rock, hip-hop and
electronica artists.This year's headliners were
Paul McCartney, the Killers and the Cure,
and in the past, the festival has boasted acts
such as Radiohead. Rage Against the Ma
chine. Bjork and Oasis — as well as hundreds
of smaller acts that play throughout the day
and into the night.
Although the main draw is the festival's
consistently stellar lineups, many flock to
Indio to bask in the utterly unique ambiance
of Coachella. Nowhere else will you find neo
hippies. celebrities, body-painted college kids
and aged rockers all sweating together under
the scorching sun. The festival also features
large-scale, often interactive, art installations
scattered across the polo grounds. 1 lighlights
of this year's displays included "Hand of
Man." an enormous steel hand powered by
hydraulics that you can control with your own
hand, and The Do Laß. an oasis of colorful
tents and trance music that provides some
much-needed shelter.
For those unfamiliar with the festival.
Coachella's five-stage setup includes a mon
strous main stage for the biggest headliners
and rock shows, a secondary outdoor stage
for indie bands, and three large tents for
smaller bands and electronica groups. During
the heat of the day, only the intrepid and de
voted made it out to the main two stages,
while others wisely sought the shade of the
tents. By nightfall, though, huge crowds gath
ered to watch the headlining acts on the main
stage, the audience extending almost a quar
ter-mile from the stage itself. For those less
eager to muscle to the front of the crowd, the
main stage had extra speakers and huge
screens to broadcast the performance to the
outer rim of concertgoers.
Friday's main lineup channeled a more
classic feel with performances by Leonard
Cohen. Morrissey (the "charming man" for
merly ofThe Smiths) and Paul McCartney all
performing within hours of each other. Satur
day saw more of a laid-back early afternoon
on the main stage with performances by Joss
Stone, Paolo Nutini and the reggae-funk
group Michael Franti & Spearhead — and
the evening started drawing crowds with the
incomparable TV on the Radio. Sunday's mix
was more eclectic,featuring Perry Farrell (the
only artist to appear at every Coachella festi
val). Public Enemy — yes,complete with Fla
vor Flav stage-diving four times during the
set — and My Bloody Valentine, whose 15-
minute sound explosions were the reason be
hind the festival organizers handing out
earplugs earlier that day.
Coachella 2009 showed that, once again,
Goldenvoice manages to deliver a festival
that brings an incredibly diverse crowd to
gether on one stretch of grass for a weekend
of audio indulgence. Even though this year's

lineup was occasionally criticized for reach
ing out to more "mainstream" artists such as
Paul McCartney, the end result was a success.
Whether you go for one day or all three,
whether you camp out or retreat to a hotel
each night, whether you come for the lone
Beatle or Steve Aoki. Coachella can always
boast an experience unlike any other.
Here's a look at some of the weekend high
light performances:
1. Paul McCartney
Paul McCartney's presence was felt hours
before he even set foot on stage. The demo
graphic on Friday was noticeably skewed to
ward the older generation — especially older
women, starry-eyed at the prospect of seeing
one of the Beatles in the flesh. When Franz
Ferdinand had the main stage, frontman Alex
Kapranos was sporting a "George Harrison"
shirt.and halfway through the set.noticed the
many Beatles shirts in the audience and
quipped. "The Beatles? Oh, are they playing
later?" Later that evening. Silversun Pickups'
Brian Aubert joked to the audience. "This
one's for Paul McCartney — 1 really just
want him to succeed."
For a festival known for its more cutting
edge acts, Paul McCartney's opening night
headline spot must have felt like a bit of a
gamble. But Coachella's new attempts to
unite a wider audience were met with great
enthusiasm from young and old. As thou
sands of fans filled the grass around the main
stage. DJ Chris Holmes played remixes of old
Beatles songs — as if the audience needed a
reminder that a rock legend was about to
grace them with his presence.
And then Sir Paul himself stepped out to
thunderous applause, nattily dressed in a
sharp shirt and jacket that put the earlier
grunge-clad bands to shame. He pulled a
funny face, pretending he was surprised by
the enthusiastic greeting, and then launched
into a two-and-a-half hour set that went well
past midnight and covered the entire span of
his musical career.
Switching between guitar, bass and piano,
and putting to use his surprisingly strong
voice, the 66-year-old showed age defying en
ergy as he churned through hits for the more
ardent fan (from his later solo works such as
"Jet") and Beatles classics that electrified
even the youngest fans into singing along -
"I ley Jude,""Back in the U.S.S.R"and"Let It
Be." As he took off his jacket between songs,
the crowd whistled, and h-e seemed to be a
rock star basking in the spotlight. And yet.
just a few songs later, he confided in the mul
titudes of fans as if they were his closest
friends,explaining that the day was very emo
tional for him, since it was the anniversary of
the death of Linda McCartney.his wife for al
most 30 years. "She loved the desert, she
loved music, she loved rock 'n' roll." he told
the crowd quietly. "She loved it all."
McCartney squashed any doubts as to his
ability to put on a stunning show, even with
out the presence of Ringo Starr (rumors of a
surprise appearance had been flying around
the Internet in the preceding weeks). Some
came for the nostalgia, some out of curiosity,
but the Beatle cleverly gave every demo
graphic in the audience something to remem
ber at the end of the festival's first night.

2. The Cure
While The Cure was slated to take the
stage at 9:25 p.m. to finish within Coachella's
mandated midnight curfew, the band well sur
passed the time limit with a three-hour set
that literally had organizers pulling the plug.
Then again, what else could be expected of
Robert Smith and The Cure? With a ( V that

spans over three decades and 13 major studio
releases.The Cure showed the proper way to
close the l()th Coaehella Festival. Smith,
sporting his traditional mess of black hair,
provided the necessary energy to last the long
set. sometimes displaying a smile thai was
atypical of a man whose songs often defined a
more somber, melodic identity. Starting oil
with sobering songs from "Prayers for Rain"
and "Lovesong," the band slowly but surely
moved away from the dark beginnings and
began playing their more popular hits In Ik'
tween Days" and".lust like I leaven." By the
time the festival curfew rolled around, the
band continued to play, despite the $1,000
fine for every post-midnight minute of per
formance placed on concert organizers Gold
envoice by Indio police. Yet. with The Cure
oblivious to the restrictions, the remaining
crowd members were treated to quite the
spectacle. ITiose wishing that the festivities
would never end ma\ have begun to think
that the band could pla\ on forever, as I Tie
Cure turned their promised last song "Boys
Don't Crv" into an additional two numbers.
But with money going up in flames, organi/
ers decided that the dream had to end and
eventually turning off the display screens,
capping a memorable 2009 Coaehella Valley
Music and Art Festival.

3.The Killers
following a disappointing set by M.1.A..
The Killers delivered an electrifying night
time performance complete with stage
sparks, flames and fireworks — to wrap up
Saturday's lineup. ITie I as Vegas based head
liners last played ('oachclla live vears ago in
a side tent, one month before releasing their
first hit album."l lot I uss."T his year, flanked
both onstage by fauna- a theme of the
band's newest album. "Day & Age" as
well as offstage by the Fmpire Polo Club's
surrounding palm trees. The Killers opened
with hits "Human" and "Somebody Told
Me. ensuring that few festival-goers prema
turely headed for the parking lots. I )elivering
a continuous blend of soups from all four of

the group's albums — "Hot I uss" (2004),
"Sam's Town" (2006), "Sawdust" (2007) and
"Day & Age" (2008) frontman Brandon
I lowers decided to"pick it upa little bit "with
"Spaceman." a hit from"Day & Age." Mow
ers then jettisoned the guitar for "Sam's
lown." instead singing at the piano in front ot
a violinist and background singer, before re
lating to the audience the band's beginnings
in Las Vegas in 2002. "I liked the same bands
Dave liked." I lowers said, referring to gui
tarist I )ave Kenning. ()n a tape Keuninggave
I lowers during their first meeting was what
would become the band's ticket to the alter
native-rock arena — "Mr. Brightside." which
the band performed Saturday night in front
of sparks and fireworks. After leaving the
stage.The Killers granted the crowd's wish by
returning for an encore of "Bones." "Jenny
Was a Friend of Mine" and "When You Were
Young." The band was dwarfed by falling
sparks, rising flames and soaring fireworks,
which continued as the euphoric crowd stum
bled away from the main stage toward their
tents and ears.

4. M.I.A.
T his year's Coaehella found British train
wreck Amy Winehouse.who was originally in
the lineup, replaced with hip-hop superstar
M.I.A. on the Coaehella main stage. After
giving birth to her first child only a few
months ago. the late replacement was greeted
with a packed-to-the-brim audience.
The show opened with neon-clad backup
dancers getting their groove on in front of
massive tele-screens showing images ol dis
sent and war in other countries, with ironic
phrases like "M I.A. supports terrorism" and
"Media Genocide." Hie air was punctuated
with sirens and gunshots, a very common
sound in many of her songs, before M.I A.
herself came on stage, clad in acid wash skin
n\ jeans and neon accents. I ler protege. Rye
Rye, was practically glued to her side
throughout the performance, trying to pump
up the crowd and help with the vocals.
M I.A. seemed hell-bent on making sure
the audience didn't consider her a sellout,
noting, ".lust because I did the (irammys
doesn't mean I gone all sold out 'She also ac
knowledged how awkwardly large the main
stage was for her performance, voicing what
everybody in the audience was thinking "I
don't really know how to bring it up on the
main stage."
She tried to combat this obvious issue
using multiple ladies, most notably when she
invited her fans to the front of the pit onstage,
trying desperately to connect with the audi
cnee on a closer level. She then moved into
her most popular song, "Paper Planes," and
performed it with an air of boredom, seem
ingly rushing to gel it over with and get back
to her child.
Her signature neon and siren-infused
performance was not to be missed, but could
have been improved. M.I.A. herself said il
best at the end of her short set: "Next year,
I'm back in the tent. I like to feel the sweat!"

5. I ran/ Ferdinand
Playing their second Coaehella festival,
the Scottish rockers walked and erutchcd
onto the main stage for their 6:35 p.m. Fri
day timeslot. Despite lead guitarist Nick Mc
( arlhy's fool injury, which confined the axe
man to a walking boot, the band did not miss
a beat and played one of the most up-tempo
sets ol the day With the sun setting to their
right, the band opened with "Dark of the
Matinee" and current hit "No You Girls"
also featured in the latest iPod commercials
off their new album "Tonight." While

sound bytes in Apple ads may not always
translate into C'oldplay-esque success, the
members of I ran/ Ferdinand couldn't care
less and their crowd sang along to songs like
" lake Me Out" and "What She Came For."
I lie band's confidence and classic suave were
on lull display throughout the set lead
singer Alex Kapranos. clad in striped pants
and candy-apple red Oxfords, even used
some i)l the 50-mmute set to joke with the
crowd."l heard there's a band called the Bea-

lies playing," he teased the ranks of Me( ail
ney fans sporting their favorite Beatles mem
orahilia. And in response to a fan holding up
a sign asking for a peek show, he quipped he
fore breaking into song. "Someone in the
crowd wants to see my nipples. There's not a
lot going on up there. I'm afraid."

ft. Wall Yeah Yeahs
Wearing something akin to ceiling decora
lions from IKI A. Karen (). flanked by gui
tarist Nick /.inner and drummer Brian ( hase.
took the stage as the enigmatic trio thai is the
Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Adding to the visual oddity
was (lie massive inflatable eye that hung as
the stage's centerpiece. I qual to the optical
spectacle however, was the audio experience.
Karen (). sporting a gold sequined cape and
blue polka-dotted leggings, had little care for
the heat, much less the odd stares that have
come to define her stage attire, immediately
belting out songs "Runaway" and "(iold
I ion. "With a clean,powerful sound.the set it
sell was defined by iis emotional control, tak
ing the crowd through fluctuations of intima
cy. excitement and love. I lie always-smiling
Karen (). lithe and graceful.strutted the stage
with cat-like moves, stirring the crowd with
"Zero" and "Heads Will Roll" off then new
album "li s Blitz!" Yet with the sun setting on
Sunday, the set can perhaps be encapsulated
by the performance of "Maps." to which
Karen () stated. " This song is about love."
With the crowd singing along. "Wail! I hey
don't love you like I love you." the Yeah Yeah
Yeahs delivered one of the most personal ex
periences and perhaps memorable perform
ances of ( oachella 2(H) 1 ).
