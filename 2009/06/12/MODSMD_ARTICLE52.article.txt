The designers at Paris Fashion Week — the most
avant-garde and fashion forward week — can be catego
rized into two sets this season: those that offered more of
the same old, same old, and those that completely sur
prised us with collections seemingly out of the blue.
Not surprisingly, Balmain offered us more sequined
minidresses. buckled boots, and rock 11 roll attitude.
Trashy chic is awesome for a while, but Christophe De
carnin needs to t;ikc his aesthetic one step further and not
offer last season's dresses in different colors. Dior was
theatrical as usual, with models wearing dresses that lea
tured Oriental designs on the front and buttocks covered
by sheer gau/y fabric on the back. Stefano Pilati at Yves
Saint Laurent did what YSI. is known for— masculine
tuxedo suits lit for a woman's body. The tailoring was ex
quisite. and the styles are timeless, so we can't complain
about not seeing anything new. The clothes at Dries Van
Noten embodied effortless style and careless shapes
combined with fearless color, but they seem a bit redun
dant after the phenomenal, fan-favorite collection hist
season. Isabel Marant came out with yet another collec
tion meant for those seeking casual streetwear with a
cool French girl vibe. Sonia Rvkiel s collection w;is as
cheeky and rhinestone-covered as always.
Other designers took a completely ditferent direction
— and sometimes not for the better. Rumors of Martin
Margiela retiring and leaving his house to his apprentices
have been abu//, and this season s collection seems to
hint at that possibility. It was gimmicky rather than bril
liant and revolutionary. Nicolas (Ihesquierre stepped Ba
lenciaga away from the futuristic approach of the past
season and instead focused on tulip skirts, colorful
draped dresses,and satin wrap belts;it s definitely not the
edgy Baienciaga we expected. I lussein ( halayan was an
other big surprise: he stunned everyone with his aerody
namic, sculpted, wing tipped, art-inspired dresses — they
seemed like clothing from 3(MH)AD. Me has a tendency to

make his creations with rubber, paper, LED light, and
lasers rather than with cloth.This season, he turned to the
sleek and sexy instead: we saw bustiers, mini-dresses, and
thigh-high leather boots. I loved it all —Chalayan left a
bit of the old him in the synthetic fabrics and unusual col
ors. Still, it was an unusually wearable and less conceptu
al collection coming from him. Does this have something
to do with news that he is teaming up with denim label J
Brand for a capsule collection?
Olivier Threvskens came out with an amazing (and
supposedly final) collection for Nina Ricci. His un
sellable Victorian gowns turned into sexy dresses with
volume and some super cool jumpsuits. What a welcome
(and potentially profitable) change!
Trend: It's Still Shoulders
I'm personally sick of the pronounced shoulders
trend, but it's still übiquitous on the runways. Balmain.
who spurred the rage last fall, kept it going this season,
along with Margiela's interesting, transparent take on the
trend. Balenciaga dresses had particularly sharp shoul
ders that pointed upwards and looked out of place with
the paint splattered prints.The weirdest manifestation of
the shoulder trend was at Manish Arora. where one
model walked down with lion heads peeking out trom
each shoulder.
Model Profile: Natasha Pol\
Paris followed Milan in model casting trends — safe,
pretty and not very diverse. Model veteran Natasha Poly
has been everywhere this season. Poly is known for her
super bad-ass walk and her runway composure (her shoe
slipped out at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show once,
and she continued strutting down the runway on tiptoe
without a flinch). With ra/or sharp cheekbones that keep
her from being too generic looking and an ultra slim fig
ure. Pol\ can pretty much book any show she wants. It
