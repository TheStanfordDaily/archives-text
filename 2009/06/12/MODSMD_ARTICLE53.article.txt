# Senior Reflections 09

When I was in hinh school. I was a huge tool.
Really. I was one of those kids who did community service so I could put
it on my resume. (Junior Civitan, anyone?) I went on those nerdy Web sites
like College Confidential and fretted because my best friend scored ti() points
higher than I did on the SAT. If I met high school me now. I'd smack her.
I w as once asked in a job interview how 1 had changed since high school,
and this was the answer I gave. (Somehow, this company still decided to em
ploy me.) I'd never really thought about this question before that moment. I
realized, though, that the most important thing I learned at Stanford was not
how to write about marginally existent metaphors in literary texts. Instead. I
learned some values.
In part, this development occurred because 1 learned to "fail." I alsoattrib
ute it to wise advice of my advisor. Barton Bernstein. But I think the biggest
factor in my transformation was The Daily.
I distinctly remember asking the then-editor in chief during New Student
Orientation how much time l~he Daily would take up. I wanted to focus on
my grades.Three hours a week, she assured me.Three years later, I was com
posing 2 a.m. songs about the gummy bears on the Storke Publications ceil
ing in a sleep-deprived state, which was brought about by working something
like 60 hours a week as managing editor of news.
I often told people that The Daily was my Horcrux. I really did give a piece
of myself to that paper. Why? Because it mattered. I felt like I could make a
difference at Stanford through The Daily. Resume padding never made me
as happy or made me feel like a part of something in the way The Daily did.
(Cue violins.) Soon. I learned to question authority rather than throw myself
at the feet of people in power. 1 developed a more critical mind, and I began
to challenge and analyze the world around me. In a nutshell. I got values. (Vi
olins crescendo.)
I loved this paper. I loved the late-night deadlines. I loved the ratty, now
defunct building and I loved the stuffed animal whose editor in chief cam
paign I ran. If I had not learned to do something I actually loved, you'd prob
ably find me right now having a panic attack about my L.SAT score, or cram
ming in some boring class that would inflate my grade point average, rather
than writing this column. Instead. I happily go into the real world with a lot
less anxiety and a lot more sleep. I am actually excited about becoming a jour
nalist, or to use the term 1 prefer, "hippie/writer."
The best I advice I can leave any Stanford student at the risk of sounding
self-righteous is to calm down. Billy Joel was right about that Vienna waiting
for you thing. And lastly, if you find high school me, smack her. ■
