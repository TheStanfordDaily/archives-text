Stanford, like its students, has its quirks. Take, for example, the waterless
Lake Lag or the fact that one of our main recreational spots on cam
pus is a path up to a l%os satellite dish.
My favorite Stanford quirk is.by far, the caterpillars. Was anything so ter
rifying to do (or as hilarious to watch) as trying to duck the seemingly float
ing caterpillars while simultaneously navigating the 11 a.m. hike traffic?
And then. 10 minutes later in class, one of the fuzzy gray creatures would
appear on your shoulder, as if he were your Disney-style animal friend. Ex
cept, he was not your friend. You squashed him discreetly while attempting
to stay awake in PWR.
I. too. hated the caterpillars until they were power-washed away the
spring of sophomore year. After there were only a handful of the fuzzy
grays left, I realized how special they were. You see. the caterpillars were
dancers. They spun their silken cords down to eye-height so that we could
witness their wriggly dance. They mobbed entire shrubs in a sort of caterpil
lar frat-party.
After coming to this (surprisingly sober) conclusion, my roommate and
I decided to make a documentary about caterpillar dancing during the next
spring. Alas, the caterpillars did not return in full force the next year; this
year, I saw only one.Thus, the movie was never made, but I believe that the
importance of the caterpillar lives on. It was truly unique-even if it wasn't a
talented dancer. It seeped its way into Stanford's culture in a very short
timespan.The caterpillars even made an appearance in the pages of The
Daily from time to time. They were part of us.
All of Stanford's little quirks are a part of us now. Stanford will always
be a home to us, even without caterpillars or if Lake Lag were to be mirac
ulously filled with water.
I .uekily, I don't plan to leave Stanford for that long — I'll be back for my
co-term in the fall — but I hope I will always remember Stanford for all the
little quirks I've discovered during my undergraduate years.
I 'd like to thank all of my incredible friends for sharing these past years
with me. Likewise. I'd like to thank the Daily staff for encouraging me to
write and edit even when I would take forever to agree to do so. I'm so glad
for all of the great memories at Storke and now"li'Lokey."Thank you to the
many professors who mentored me and shaped my view of the world. And
most of all. thank you to my parents and the other family members who
have provided years of love and encouragement. It is all of you. family and
friends alike — not to mention the fuzzy gray caterpillars — that have
made my experience at Stanford so wonderful. Even if not all of you can
dance quite so well. ■
