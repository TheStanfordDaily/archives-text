Well, it's over. Sort of. It's not actually over now. as I write this, be
cause I'm taking a moment away from a mad dash to finish my
final papers as a coterm and a Stanford student in order to hid
farewell to The Daily. But by the time you're reading this? Yeah, its done.
We'll all be listening to Justice Kennedy soon, and before you know it.
we'll be filing out of Stanford Stadium, towards our respective department
ceremonies.Then there will be more parties and celebrations. And then a
strange thing will happen: people will start to leave.
Before you know it.the dorms of Stanford campus will once again be
reverting to their annual ghost-town status for the summer. And as is the
case every year, a lot of the students who leave won't be coming back.
This time. I'm one of them.
I've learned a lot here at Stanford. I've learned about people — built
friendships that. I hope, will last a lifetime. I've read authors who I may
never get the chance to read again. I've pushed my paper-writing ability to
the limit on more all-nighters than I'd ever want to remember.
A big part of what I've learned, though, has come through my experi
ences with The Daily. Some of that has come in responses to columns that
I've written — and a lot of those have been really surprising.
I would 've never guessed that there was a metal bat lobby staunehly op
posed to even the suggestion that wooden bats are safer or more aestheti
cally pleasing (no one goes to the yard to hear the "ping" of the bat). Or
that Kobe Bryant's publicist reads literally everything that is written about
him. even on college campuses. Or that there is a very vocal Finnish hock
ey fanbase in the Bay Area (seriously, don't mess with the Finns — trust
me).
But more than anything. I've gained a tremendous appreciation for the
student athletes of Stanford and those who give their utmost to ensure
they get the publicity they deserve. I was proud to be a member of the lat
ter group for four years, and would do it all again if I could.
I'd like to thank all the athletes and coaches who have made my job one
of the most enjoyable and rewarding on campus over that time.Thanks to
my colleagues at The Daily for making our building, wherever it was. a
home away from home, no matter how late I was up editing on Thursday
nights.Thanks to my family and friends for reading my stuff and encourag
ing me all the while.Thanks to editors, readers and friends alike.There are
too many of all of you to ever name here, but thank you. nonetheless.
I 'm off to a new place next year, and I don 't know what my next stop in
life will be like. But if it involves people like those I've met here, then I can't
wait to get started. ■
