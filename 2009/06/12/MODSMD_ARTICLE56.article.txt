A s strange as it might sound,college was a lot like high school for me.
Of course. 1 learned quite a bit more here, was pushed ever closer to the
extremes ol academics and social life, and didn't have to go home each day
to my parents, but Stanford has been so much like my time at Westview for
one simple reason: my life revolved around the newspaper.
Eight years ago, I was a high school freshman who learned the ropes of
journalism after a scheduling mistake left me in Journalism I. And four
years ago. I was a college freshman, who, willing to do anything just so he
could join The Daily, learned the ropes of men's golf and became a sports
writer.
And the parallels continued.
In high school. I went from beginning news writer to three years as ed
itor in chief ol I he Nexus. In college, I went from a beginning sports writer
to two-term editor in chief of The Daily.
In high school. I stayed in the journalism classroom until 11 p.m., sur
viving on It's A Grind coffee and the food donated by our "Newspaper
Mom." At Stanford, I've stayed up past 2 a.m. at the Daily office — some
times even until 6 a.m. — and survived on CoHo coffee and Treehouse
dinners.
And in high school. 1 garnered a "Nexus Family," while at Stanford.The
Daily has been more of a family than I can even comprehend.
But one thing has been missing in my experience at The Daily: a college
version of my high school journalism adviser. Mr. Wenger. As! often say.
getting into journalism was one big accident for me, a result of that fresh
man-year scheduling error. 1 have Wenger to thank, though, for making it
so much more than a "mistake."
Seven years ago. when I didn't turn in an application to join the news
paper staff after Journalism 1, Wenger called my house and left a voicemail
asking "where the hell" my application was. He convinced my mom that
journalism is something that I'm meant to do, and he soon also convinced
me.
I remember that voicemail well, and I remember the many other times
I heard Wenger's voice during high school, as I worked with him on The
Nexus. Years later. I've continued to hear him.even in his absence at The
Daily, encouraging me and pushing me further.
I hear the good: "Dude, that is an awesome front page" or "Nice inter
view — you got some good quotes." I hear the critical:" "Dude, what's up
with this lede?" "Let's try that again — with a little more tact, buddy."
"C'MON.active voicc.noi passive!" And more than a few times,"What the
hell are you thinking?"
While I miss Wenger's presence, I'm glad that his voice has still been
there tor me all these years, and I thank him for developing my passion for
journalism.
Even more, though. I have something else to thank Wenger for. II I
could pick out the one thing that Wenger told me the most, both then and
now. it's the importance of voice. I Ic always made a point to remind me
that anyone can write, but only some — only those who truly work at it
can find their voice through it.
Eight years down the line, hundreds of articles later, and thousands of
conversations later. I think I've found it. My voice is still a little shaky and
unsure, but it's getting louder, more articulate and much more personal
with each new day.
Soon enough. Wenger's voice, like the many I've encountered here at
Stanford, will grow quieter as it gives way to my own voice — the one this
university. The Daily and journalism itself have given me an opportunity
to cultivate.
Even as their voices grow quiet, though. I have to thank the many peo
ple who have given me my voice. Whether it was Wenger who told me to
find it. or those who challenged me here to develop it."thank you. ■
