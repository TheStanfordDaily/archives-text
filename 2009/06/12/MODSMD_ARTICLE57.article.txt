For a while now it's been time to go. I was supposed to graduate last
year. I've been here five years, just a year longer than usual and short
er than most toiling grad students but long enough to feel campus cul
ture. and my own perspective, change. 1 .ong enough to watch hipsterdom
begin to infiltrate our flip-flopped, sun-soaked enclave, what I once
thought to be safely situated hundreds of miles from the nearest Steve Aoki
show or out of range or interest for any handlebar-mustached fixie bike
guru who might come listing and drifting insouciantly down Fl Camino
Real. Give up now, kids.you're still in Silicon Valley.
But Ill miss the campus and the color of northern California. Spring
time here is particularly nice.The days are long and warm and everyone's
in good spirits. On the rainy February days there was always Green Li
brary, and I'll miss the access to almost everything and the sense when I'm
inside that if there were only unlimited time.no pressure of looming finals
or anything. I could probably keep myself happily occupied in there indef
initely. And my graduating classmates all understand: I'll miss Friday of
fice hours in the history department, where just sitting and listening to a
certain sharp-tongued Queens native talk —about anything and every
thing— reminds you of the wonderful appeal of intellectual rigor and
depth and the university itself, the only kind of place on Farth that values
those ideals as much as he does. I've learned a lot here after I grew up a bit
and put down the red cups and lighters after my sophomore year. If you
take lull advantage, it's an incredible place to learn.
I edited the opinions page briefly two years ago. I always felt I didn't
have the substance or (hopefully) the ego to want to write a column my
selt. So instead I contributed in the news pages, occasionally covering an
event or profiling someone important. I didn't have any big scoops like
some ol my graduatingcolleagues and was never around campus for what
ever reason when the really big news broke, but it was nice to observe and
learn from these student journalists, some of whom were very talented and
very dedicated.
i really enjoy journalism and hope to make a career out of it. I'll be
headed east, dangerously close to Williamsburg, to take a shot at it. But I
remember starting at the Daily in September of 2004, when my first arti
cle appeared on the first day of classes my freshman year.The Daily has al
ways given me a generous platform to publish, a chance to develop myself
and a good circle of friends. For that I'm indebted ■
