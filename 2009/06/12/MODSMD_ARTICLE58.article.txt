When I leave here. I will miss meetings over coffee at Moonbeans,
study sessions in the Bender Room and I a.m. trips to In-N-Out
Burger. I will reminisce over fountain hopping, steam tunneling
and Dish walking.
Mostly, though. I will remember The Daily.'
Two years ago. when my term as editor in chief ended. I wrote about The
Daily as a public trust.
Now it's truer than ever.
The San Jose Mercury News had a fulltime beat reporter covering Stan
lord lor many years, but the collapse of the business model for metropolitan
newspapers forced both The Mercury and The San Francisco Chronicle to
scale back. (Fortunately The Mercury's higher education reporter is one of
the industry's best, but she's spread thin.)
Frighteningly.The Daily could be the last left standing. The outside world
is more dependent than ever on us for news about the University. With
fewer outside reporters nosing around, vigorous. accurate and fair reporting
in these pages becomes increasingly important.
If Oxford was the greatest global university of the 19th century and I lar
vard of the 20th. senior administrators say they want Stanford to be the lead
ing school for the 21 st.
Stanford's Paper of Record must chronicle efforts to get there, keeping
an eye on the big picture, reporting successes and failures, big and small.
Some editors get distracted, forgetting (or never understanding) that this

public service mandate is ultimaielv the paper's most important function.
Tliey must resist boosterism and press-release spin.
To stay a premier school. Stanford needs a great student newspaper. Not
worrying about pesky reporters emboldens even altruistic officials to abuse
authority and mismanage resources. An independent student press exposes
and deters malfeasance.
Are there problems with The Daily? More than I'd like to admit. In spite
of its flaws, this institution remains a remarkable proving ground for aspir
ing journalists, and I hope new leaders can revive its investigative spirit.
The editorial pages must be home to lively debate and serious discus
sions about the future of the I Jniversity. Stories should express ideas at the
level Stanford's brightest minds are capable of understanding. More trust
worthy reporting will prompt people to come in with tips and leaks.
The S.(HX)-square-foot, state-of-the-art building the staff moved into ear
lier this year stands as a beacon of truth in this sea of higher learning. Posi
tioned at the heart of campus, it is a symbol of the organization's ccntrality
to campus life.
One of my goals is to endow the building that replaces the one just
opened — in about 50 years. Except I doubt that what the staff produces in
that edifice will be printed on paper.
Infused in Stanford's ethos is the limitless possibility of the Wild West.
Bottom-up trumps top-down in the Silicon Valley. Merit overcomes legacy,
(iood ideas prevail over outdated mores. That's why I think the future of
journalism just might be figured out here, on what essentially remains the
western frontier ■
