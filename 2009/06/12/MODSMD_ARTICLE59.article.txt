I entered Storke Publications Building (sadly enough, a huge improve
ment over my high school's newspaper office) during my second week at
Stanford with the hope of becoming a copy editor. (Yes, I was — and still am
— a grammar Nazi.) When the editor in chief at the time suggested I become
a reporter instead, I walked out of the building, dejected.
Three months later, I came to the realization that I should be more open
minded about potential involvement at The Daily. College was a time for
change. 1 reasoned, and although I had my mind set on working at the college
paper. I would embrace the opportunity to try a new department. So 1 walked

back into Storke. willing to ac
cept any assignment provided
by The Powers That Be. Fortu
nately. the editor in chief took
pity on my inability to write
and conveniently "found" an
extra position on the copy
desk. And thus began my four
year relationship with The
Daily.
I finally made friends out
side of FroSoC o and learned to
love Storke in all its rundown
glorv. I forced myself to try
new things, making my rounds
through the copy desk, fea
tures and opinions. After a
hellish stint on the opinions
desk (three co-editors in four
months is exhausting. I prom
ise). however. I felt it was time

"I've kept going for
the students"

for an even bigger change.
Restless but not wanting to leave The Daily altogether. I made the leap
from the editorial staff to the business stal l. I secured a daytime job, thinking.
"I'll just manage the office from 9 to 5. answer some emails, and finally put my
econ courses to good use." I couldn't have been more wrong.
ITiese past 12 months involved supervising the construction of a building,
signing a lease and planning a mega housewarming party — in addition to my
day-to-day responsibilities. On the plus side. I've met some pretty exemplary
individuals and picked up skills in construction management, lease negotia
tions and event planning. On the down side, though, these experiences were
marred by plummeting ad sales and organization-wide budget cuts.
I've charged through the stressful workdays and sleepless nights not for
the glory, not for fear of my supervisors, and certainly not for the money. In
stead. I've kept going for the students, many of whom have become my dear
est friends over the past four years.Through their camaraderie, office pranks
and steadfast passion for journalism. I constantly remember that The Daily is
an institution well worth preserving and protecting.
I learned a few tools of the journalism trade here at the Daily, but at the
end of the day, I will remember some simple life lessons: Don't be afraid to try
new things. Embrace the challenges, seize the opportunities and remain mo
tivated by the causes (and people!) you truly care about. ■
