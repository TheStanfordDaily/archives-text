# Mental health at Stanford
## Students face mental health stigma 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Originally published on Dec.2ooB, this is the final
part of a five-part series by The Daily focusing on
campus mental health, specifically in light of the
University's report released in October. Previous
segments reported on the relationship between alco
hol and mental health, as well as effects of the Uni
versity's report on various mental health services on
campus.
News Analysis
When Ariel James '11 was in high school, she tried
to commit suicide.
Many of her friends noticed she had become
moodier and more tired during her sophomore and
junior years. But she chalked it up to little more
than a phase she was going through.
"I thought that all teenage girls had low self-es
teem." James said. "I didn't realize what I was ex
periencing wasn't normal until I attempted sui
cide."
James sought treatment at the urging of her
friends, and was diagnosed with clinical depres
sion. a condition she said leaves its victims feeling
helpless and undervalued during low emotional
states. Although she credited her counselors for
setting her on the path to recovery, James said she
still felt reluctant to take advantage of Stanford's
mental health resources to treat her chronic condi
tion when she arrived on campus last fall.
"I figured I was in college now, I was an adult. I
should be dealing with this on my own." James said.
"I felt like my problems weren't serious enough,
and that I would be wasting time by burdening
people with things that I could deal with by my
self."
James is not alone, according to an October re
port by the Student Mental I lealth and Weil-Being
Task Force that examined Stanford's mental health
climate on campus. The report identified a well
known stigma pervasive among Stanford students
that discourages them from seeking any kind of
help — whether it be academic tutoring or psycho
logical counseling — for fear that it will betray a
sign of weakness or inadequacy.
"It isn't until you are in a desperate situation
that you ask for help, when you think you are going
to fail," said one student who was anonymously
quoted in the report. "It is not always too late, but
sometimes it is, and you don't really know when
that is."
This stigma is particularly acute when it comes

to mental health. According to a number of stu
dents interviewed by The Daily who have sought
treatment for mental health issues, the stigma tra
ditionally associated with mental illness often
makes them reluctant to be open about their men
tal health challenges and seek the counseling they
need to treat their conditions. As a result, these stu
dents said they often feel isolated from their
friends and, in some of the more extreme cases,
alienated by the treatment they receive through in
voluntary hospitalizations on campus.
"Sometimes, I feel like I am isolated from my
peers," James said. "It's not that they wouldn't un
derstand, but sometimes I feel like I'm in a differ
ent situation."
Reaching Out for Help
A growing number of Stanford students are ex
periencing mental health challenges in ways that
are consistent with larger trends on college cam
puses nationwide, according to Alejandro Mar
tinez, senior associate director of Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS).
A telephone survey of 2,1% Stanford students
conducted in 2007-2008 revealed that more than 23
percent of students had transiently experienced
depressed mood during the previous month, and
that more than three percent met the criteria for a
major depressive disorder. Almost a third of stu
dent respondents had experienced high levels of
stress, and about 12 percent of students had
thought of suicide, usually transiently, during their
lifetime.
In this environment, CAPS has experienced an
unprecedented demand for services, according to
Martinez. Eight years ago, clinicians saw around
1.100 to 1,200 students a year. Now, Martinez said,
approximately 750 to 800 utilize CAPS each quar
ter.
"There is a lot of good news, even t hough it puts
increased demand in our ability to respond to stu
dents," Martinez said. "More students are more
willing to reach out for help."
Upperclassmen tend to make up the largest
proportion of undergraduates seen at CAPS, ac
cording to Martinez. For the 2007-08 academic
year, about 20 percent of the students seen at
CAPS were seniors. Sophomores and juniors each
hovered around eight to 11 percent, and five per
cent of the students using C APS were freshmen.
Hie remaining 56 percent were graduate and
post-doctoral students, according to Martinez.
Ira Freidman, director of Vaden I lealth Center,
told The Daily in October that freshmen tend to be

the most at-risk for mental health conditions, given
their lack of experience with these kinds of issues
and the sometimes difficult transition from high
school to college.
"Freshmen don't use our services until much
later," Friedman said. "The use of CAPS goes up
stepwise over the undergraduate years. There's a
little hit of a mismatch."
The most common reason students seek treat
ment at CAPS is related to problems in personal
relationships, according to Martinez. About 18 per
cent will seek treatment for depression, while 11
percent will seek help for anxiety.
CAPS Director Ron Albucher said his office
has worked to meet the increasing demand by hir
ing the equivalent of four additional therapists and
a social worker who serves as a case manager for
the service. Albucher said the number of coun
selors the University maintains currently exceeds
national guidelines recommending that universi
ties maintain one full-time staff professional for
every 1,000 to 1,500 students.
Some students, nevertheless, remain resistant to
seeking treatment.
"There are still a core group of students ... who
are reluctant to come to our services," Martinez
said. "But that proportion is becoming smaller. I
see that as very good news."
"The stigma of getting help is not as high as it
used to be in the past," Martinez added.
"Always In Control"
Hie primary source of this stigma often comes
from fellow Stanford students themselves, said
Mirra Schwartz '09, president of Stanford Peace of
Mind, which promotes awareness of mental health
issues on campus.
"Stanford puts so much pressure on people to
act as if they are always in control, which isn't al
ways the case." Schwartz said.
She said many students struggle to understand
the nature of mental illnesses unless they or a close
friend or relative has experienced them.
"All of us are very self-sufficient and very moti
vated to accomplish what we think is best for our
selves," Schwartz said. "People just don't under
stand that this isn't something that you can con
trol."
To help demystify student experiences with
mental health, the Stanford Theatre Activist Mobi
lization Project (S TAMP) is in the process of col
lecting stories from students willing to write
