# Mental health at Stanford
## Students face mental health stigma 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Originally published on Dec.2ooB, this is the final
part of a five-part series by The Daily focusing on
campus mental health, specifically in light of the
University's report released in October. Previous
segments reported on the relationship between alco
hol and mental health, as well as effects of the Uni
versity's report on various mental health services on
campus.
News Analysis
When Ariel James '11 was in high school, she tried
to commit suicide.
Many of her friends noticed she had become
moodier and more tired during her sophomore and
junior years. But she chalked it up to little more
than a phase she was going through.
"I thought that all teenage girls had low self-es
teem." James said. "I didn't realize what I was ex
periencing wasn't normal until I attempted sui
cide."
James sought treatment at the urging of her
friends, and was diagnosed with clinical depres
sion. a condition she said leaves its victims feeling
helpless and undervalued during low emotional
states. Although she credited her counselors for
setting her on the path to recovery, James said she
still felt reluctant to take advantage of Stanford's
mental health resources to treat her chronic condi
tion when she arrived on campus last fall.
"I figured I was in college now, I was an adult. I
should be dealing with this on my own." James said.
"I felt like my problems weren't serious enough,
and that I would be wasting time by burdening
people with things that I could deal with by my
self."
James is not alone, according to an October re
port by the Student Mental I lealth and Weil-Being
Task Force that examined Stanford's mental health
climate on campus. The report identified a well
known stigma pervasive among Stanford students
that discourages them from seeking any kind of
help — whether it be academic tutoring or psycho
logical counseling — for fear that it will betray a
sign of weakness or inadequacy.
"It isn't until you are in a desperate situation
that you ask for help, when you think you are going
to fail," said one student who was anonymously
quoted in the report. "It is not always too late, but
sometimes it is, and you don't really know when
that is."
This stigma is particularly acute when it comes

to mental health. According to a number of stu
dents interviewed by The Daily who have sought
treatment for mental health issues, the stigma tra
ditionally associated with mental illness often
makes them reluctant to be open about their men
tal health challenges and seek the counseling they
need to treat their conditions. As a result, these stu
dents said they often feel isolated from their
friends and, in some of the more extreme cases,
alienated by the treatment they receive through in
voluntary hospitalizations on campus.
"Sometimes, I feel like I am isolated from my
peers," James said. "It's not that they wouldn't un
derstand, but sometimes I feel like I'm in a differ
ent situation."
Reaching Out for Help
A growing number of Stanford students are ex
periencing mental health challenges in ways that
are consistent with larger trends on college cam
puses nationwide, according to Alejandro Mar
tinez, senior associate director of Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS).
A telephone survey of 2,1% Stanford students
conducted in 2007-2008 revealed that more than 23
percent of students had transiently experienced
depressed mood during the previous month, and
that more than three percent met the criteria for a
major depressive disorder. Almost a third of stu
dent respondents had experienced high levels of
stress, and about 12 percent of students had
thought of suicide, usually transiently, during their
lifetime.
In this environment, CAPS has experienced an
unprecedented demand for services, according to
Martinez. Eight years ago, clinicians saw around
1.100 to 1,200 students a year. Now, Martinez said,
approximately 750 to 800 utilize CAPS each quar
ter.
"There is a lot of good news, even t hough it puts
increased demand in our ability to respond to stu
dents," Martinez said. "More students are more
willing to reach out for help."
Upperclassmen tend to make up the largest
proportion of undergraduates seen at CAPS, ac
cording to Martinez. For the 2007-08 academic
year, about 20 percent of the students seen at
CAPS were seniors. Sophomores and juniors each
hovered around eight to 11 percent, and five per
cent of the students using C APS were freshmen.
Hie remaining 56 percent were graduate and
post-doctoral students, according to Martinez.
Ira Freidman, director of Vaden I lealth Center,
told The Daily in October that freshmen tend to be

the most at-risk for mental health conditions, given
their lack of experience with these kinds of issues
and the sometimes difficult transition from high
school to college.
"Freshmen don't use our services until much
later," Friedman said. "The use of CAPS goes up
stepwise over the undergraduate years. There's a
little hit of a mismatch."
The most common reason students seek treat
ment at CAPS is related to problems in personal
relationships, according to Martinez. About 18 per
cent will seek treatment for depression, while 11
percent will seek help for anxiety.
CAPS Director Ron Albucher said his office
has worked to meet the increasing demand by hir
ing the equivalent of four additional therapists and
a social worker who serves as a case manager for
the service. Albucher said the number of coun
selors the University maintains currently exceeds
national guidelines recommending that universi
ties maintain one full-time staff professional for
every 1,000 to 1,500 students.
Some students, nevertheless, remain resistant to
seeking treatment.
"There are still a core group of students ... who
are reluctant to come to our services," Martinez
said. "But that proportion is becoming smaller. I
see that as very good news."
"The stigma of getting help is not as high as it
used to be in the past," Martinez added.
"Always In Control"
Hie primary source of this stigma often comes
from fellow Stanford students themselves, said
Mirra Schwartz '09, president of Stanford Peace of
Mind, which promotes awareness of mental health
issues on campus.
"Stanford puts so much pressure on people to
act as if they are always in control, which isn't al
ways the case." Schwartz said.
She said many students struggle to understand
the nature of mental illnesses unless they or a close
friend or relative has experienced them.
"All of us are very self-sufficient and very moti
vated to accomplish what we think is best for our
selves," Schwartz said. "People just don't under
stand that this isn't something that you can con
trol."
To help demystify student experiences with
mental health, the Stanford Theatre Activist Mobi
lization Project (S TAMP) is in the process of col
lecting stories from students willing to write
anonymously about their mental
health struggles. A team of play
wrights is planning on crafting this
material into monologues that will
be performed in late January at al
most every residence on campus.
"The stigma against mental ill
ness is so intense that the interven
tion of theater is such a natural way
to facilitate dialogue on this issue."
said Amanda Gelender '09, founder
and executive director of STAMP.
"Having actors perform the words
of real Stanford students is a way for
students to look into a mirror and
see their peers having the courage to
say the things they would never have
said with their names attached."
One submission told the story of
a varsity athlete who suffered from
bulimia as a freshman, but refused to
disclose the condition for fear of Ris
ing a spot on the team.
"I could not tell anyone on cam
pus ... because people think of bu
limia as a joke problem, gross and
unrespectable," the student wrote.
One account told the story of a
fraternity brother who suffers from
obsessive compulsive disorder. An
other described a resident assistant
who had always helped students
deal with their emotional challenges
but found it difficult to grapple with
her own episodic bouts of depres
sion. A third documented the strug
gles of a woman who began to cut
herself in high school because of a
post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) whose symptoms included
an obsessive fear of being raped.
"Stanford has been a healing
place for my PTSD." the woman
wrote. "I have escaped from the site
of my abuse and my abusers, yes. but
1 have also escaped from many of
the circumstances that allowed me
to abuse myself through cutting,
drug abuse, self put-downs and re
stricting friends."
"I Could Not Escape"
Although many students have
successfully sought treatment for
their mental illnesses, many others
continue to struggle with chronic
conditions that can both lead to sui
cidal thoughts and place students in
situations where they are at risk lor
harming themselves or others.
One student who submitted her
story to STAMP said she went to
CAPS after sinking into a deep de
pression during winter quarter ol
her freshman year.
"I had a growing fixation with
ending my own life." the student
wrote. "I knew I would not go
through with it. I told myself I knew.

But I had this feeling of being a thou
sand leagues under the sea — sta
tionary, drowned, crushed by the
stillness and pressure, trapped in the
dark."
"As a Stanford student, my mind
had always been my biggest asset,"
she added. "It turned into the most
fearful and ferocious opponent that
1 could not escape."
Martinez said CAPS takes very
seriously any student who calls and
appears to be suicidal. I le said an ini
tial staff person will try to ascertain
basic information about the stu
dent's condition and get that student
in immediate contact with an avail
able therapist.
"The principle for us is to make
sure we do everything we can to en
sure their safety." Martinez said.
In the most extreme cases, Mar
tinez said this may require hospital
ization of students against their will
if they determine that the student is
at immediate risk for suicide. Cali
fornia state law authorizes mental
health clinicians to involuntarily
confine those deemed to be of im
mediate risk to themselves or others.
Commonly referred to as a
"5150" hold, after the associated
code section number, these involun
tary hospitalizations at Stanford
usually require the police or an am
bulance to transport at-risk students
to an involuntary psychiatric ward of
Stanford Hospital, where they must
remain, by law. for a period of up to
72 hours or until a physician con
cludes the student is stable enough
to leave.
Roughly 20 to 30 students a year
require involuntary hospitalization.
Martinez said.
"There are a number of situations
where our concern for their safety is
such that they need to be confined
and placed in a protective environ
ment," Martinez said.
The anonymous student who
wrote to STAMP about her suicidal
thoughts said that, after weeks of lit
tle improvement, her doctor at
CAPS required her to undergo in
voluntary hospitalization.
The student described being
taken out of Vaden in handcuffs by
the police before being transported
to the hospital
"When I walked down the back
stairs at Vaden with my hands
chained, I thought it was funny that
they were doing this to me to make
[me] not want to die." the student
wrote. "I saw a friend, a chance hap
pening. and wanted to be swallowed
up instead of face the shame."
Stanford Police Chief I aura Wil

son wrote in an email to The Daily
that, even though it may create a
negative perception on the part of
students, handcuffing an individual
placed on a 5150 hold is one part of
the procedure that officers follow
for safety reasons. She cited one inci
dent when an individual who agreed
to go to the hospital in a calm state
became agitated and injured himself
and an officer en route.
"Officers must always remain
concerned about the worst-case sce
nario— the person causing harm to
himself, the officer or others," Wilson
said. "Officers do try to treat people
with respect and dignity, but their
primary goal is to make sure people
are safe, and then to get someone
who needs help to the person that
can provide that help."
"I Couldn't Be Alone"
Several students anonymously
described their time in Stanford I los
pital's psychiatric ward as intensely
11 egat i ve ex pe lie n ces.
"My three days of involuntary
confinement were the worst three
days of my admittedly turbulent
life," one student wrote. "1 couldn't
have my own underwear. I couldn't
[use the restroom| for fear I would
try and drown myself in the toilet. I
couldn't be alone. I couldn't be free."
Martinez said he is sensitive to the
frustrations of students who are hos
pitalized against their will.
"I don't know of any students who
have gone in on an involuntary basis
that are happy to be there." Martinez
said.
Martinez said involuntary hospi
talization may risk maintaining a
good relationship with students, but
that immediate safety concerns may
outweigh this worry since their
sound judgment might be impaired
while in an agitated or suicidal state.
I le said students who are in a better
place in managing their mental
health will often return to say that in
voluntary hospitalization was the
right thing to do at that time.
"We have to make their decision
and exercise their judgment that
their immediate safety is greater
than losing their relationship at that
point." Martinez said.
Still, several students suggested
that their experiences in the hospital
actually exacerbated their condi
tions and discouraged them from
seeking further treatment for fear of
a repeat hospitalization.
"Being in the psych ward was
what made me suicidal." said a Stan
ford senior going by Barbara, a pseu
donym used to protect her privacy.

Barabara said that when she was
IS years old. she had started to feel
withdrawn from friends and had be
come agitated and quick-tempered.
She spent hours each day crying
without much control before she was
diagnosed with major depression.
"I would just lie to myself that this
is something I can push through, that
I'm screwed up,but I can make it my
own way," Barbara said. "And it was
isolating. I didn't know my symptoms
collectively are a very common dis
ease. I thought I was the only one in
the world who acted this way."
Barbara said that, when she ar
rived at Stanford as a freshman, she
did not know what resources were
available to help treat her condition.
She did not know she could not get a
single until her sophomore year,
which she said would allow her to
avoid the embarrassment of break
ing down in tears in front of her
roommate. Barbara also discovered
in her junior year that she could
arrange to take her exams in private
rooms to help reduce her test-taking
anxiety.
But Barbara said things rapidly
spiraled downward by the end of her
junior year. One evening before fi
nals. Barbara told her sister over the
phone that she was having suicidal
thoughts. Later that night, she was
awoken by police officers at her door
aggressively trying to transport her
to the hospital. Barbara said she
talked her way out of an involuntary
hold but after a second 5150 hold au
thorization, she decided to voluntar
ily check herself into the psychiatric
ward.
"I don't know how anyone can
improve in that place." Barbara said.
Barbara was later diagnosed with
bipolar disorder during the summer
and entered a psychiatric treatment
facility where she and other Stanford
students with chronic mental health
conditions attend group therapy ses
sions and deal with the particular
challenges of being a college student
with a mental illness.
"If you say you broke your leg or
have cancer, people have patience
for that because it's physical." Bar
bara said. "When it's mental, they
just don't get it."
Barbara said she still struggles
daily to come to terms with her con
dition. Once a 4.0 student excited
about the possibilities after gradua
tion. Barbara said just the idea of get
ting a diploma and leading a normal
life has become her more immediate
goal.
"I've had a real identity crisis be
cause I define myself by my produc

tivity and achievement, as I think ;i
lot of Stanford students do," Barbara
said.
"Whether I can live with this per
son who is markedly less productive,
who always goes through depressive
swings, who doesn't have this drive,"
she added, "whether I can live with
her — the jury is still out on that."
"I thought I was just an under
achiever"
Jay-Marie Hill MO had grown up
in a fun-loving family and, like most
Stanford students, had been highly
motivated to excel through high
school. Athletics had always been a
big part of her identity, and her com
mitment landed herself a spot on
Stanford's varsity track team.
But at the beginning of her soph
omore year. Hill said she began to
miss some of her Human Biology
core lectures. At first, she missed one
or two at a time. Soon, she would
make it to only one class a week. I lill
said it became harder to focus on
reading, and she would rarely digest
the material from the lectures that
she did attend.
"I thought I was just an under
achiever," Hill said. "High school
was easy. Work was easy. I went to
college and it got harder, and I
thought that maybe I was just a fail
ure."
Having left the track team. Hill
said joining the rugby team could
not satisfy her athletic drive. In the
winter, she broke up with her girl
friend. By the spring, she decided
that, after two difficult academic
quarters, she would drop the
Hum Bio core.
It wasn't until she attended a lec
ture on depression during a psychol
ogy and gender course that Hill real
ized she may be grappling with a
condition beyond her control.
"I realized that, if I had to put a
name on it, that's what I had." Hill
said. "What they were talking about
was what I was feeling."
Hill said that, on the recommen
dation of a friend, she went to ( 'APS,
where, after a few sessions with a
counselor, she was prescribed med
ication to treat depression.
"I didn't feel happier right away,
but I definitely felt I could focus
more," Hill said.
By the end of the year. Hill had
done relatively well on her finals.
Later that summer, while still on her
medication, she made the women's
rugby national team.
"I'm enjoying myself so much now,"
I lill said."With the load I'm taking. I
never would have been able to do
that before."

Hill had always known about
CAPS as a resource,but said it was a
far different experience knowing
that she needed to use it.
"It's easy to see it as just another
place on campus." I lill said. "People
don't think of it as something that
applies to them."
"Waiting lor You to Call"
Ariel James said she has over
come the internal stigma that pre
vented her from seeking the help she
needed. She said Stanford offers her
resources that are accessible and
convenient.
"I feel like I'm in better hands
here than I was at home," James said.
Now a trained volunteer at The
Bridge Peer Counseling Center,
James said she encourages students
to reach out to their friends even il
they may not appear to be struggling
on the surface. She also said many of
Stanford's resources go underused
while on duty, she has never re
ceived a call.
"We're waiting for vou to call."
