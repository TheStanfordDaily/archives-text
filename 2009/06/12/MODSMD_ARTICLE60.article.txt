One of my friends was recently going through relationship turmoil. I le
a-fleeted on what had happened, on the other person involved, and
what he thought might happen next. I could tell this was someone
about whom he deeply cared, and their interactions had touched him at the
core. I think that most of all. lie was afraid that he had blown it with this per
son: he feared that, looking back, he had not taken full advantage of their time
together, and looking forward, the door was shut on their future.
I'd say in the past few weeks.a lot of the senior class has gone through that
same relationship trouble — perhaps not with their boyfriends or their girl
friends. hut with Stanford. We are all questioning those same things: about
never taking that last IntroSem or finding the time to see that great campus
drama production. And worst of all. as we move on Sunday in some symbol
ic way. we also worry that we will never get those chances again. It's as if the
relationship is coming lo an end. and Stanford is dumping us. (Or are we
breaking up with Stanford?)
Just like any other relationship, there are always things to turn around in
one's head. But I don't think we should regret a single thing. As I also see it.
where we stand on Sunday, both literally and metaphorically, is most substan
tively about the "decisions* we've made here — mixed in. perhaps, with just
a sprinkle ol luck. I Jltimately. our Stanford experiences are the product of a
real relationship between each of us and the University.
To me. that's a great thing: it means that in the end, *we* are the ones who
have shaped our experiences here. For example, there was a degree of luck (or
randomness) which assigned me to my freshman dorm, from which I've re
tained some of my closest friends. But there is also a drive and passion which
led me to attend Daily 101 X info sessions in ( all 2005 and eventually work my
way through the ranks of this paper's stall. In my four years. I have written for
each section (news, sports, editorial and Intermission) and taken on the re
sponsibility of desk editing for news.
Likewise, it was totally random which lIIIJM section I first attended, but
it was something else entirely which led me to have a standing I riday lunch
with two people from that classroom.a lunch date we've kept just about every
week since. And while junior year 1 wanted to study abroad in In rope. I can't
imagine how different my Stanford experience would have been if I hadn't in
stead gone to Beijing last spring. It was in part "luck" that Stanford in Paris
wanted nothing to do with me, but also a large part about making the most ol
a situation, one which in the end I wouldn't trade for a second.
So. if you're going through relationship turmoil in the way my friend is.
maybe I can't offer much advice here. But if. like me. you are reflecting on
your relationship with 1 Stanford 1 . remember that every day we've had here
is a day to celebrate, and something which, even if the door is ■ closing, has
touched you.Conversely.your being here has already cascaded into any num
ber of other students' lives. And if you're lucky (like me), your writing has
been bound in at least one of 235 thick volumes in the Daily office. ■
