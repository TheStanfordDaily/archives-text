# Senior Reflections 09

I love reading the print version of The Daily. From my first day
on campus, I've created a daily routine of reading it before
class, over lunch, during down time. I read it even if I've al
ready read all the articles the previous night, because there are
things you get in a print newspaper that can't be translated online.
But freshman year. I never really thought about how a collec
tion of Word documents transformed the next morning into
something physical,something aesthetically appealing. I thought
maybe they threw everything into a magic box that spit out a per
fectly laid-out paper, with everything just happening to fit per
fectly.
It's no coincidence, as I found out when I became an editor.
I'm going to let you in on a Daily secret: Duran.
Within Daily circles, Duran is, appropriately, a legend. I think
his official title is "typesetter." but I find "wizard" a more accu
rate appellation. He's worked at The Daily for decades, living
Stanford history through breaking news, late nights and careful
ly constructed headlines. He learned a whole new technology
when computers became the way to lay out pages. He watches as
students grow up. then leave, replaced by a fresh crop.
Duran is humble — for years he has declined features in the
paper about him.
Duran is patient — he consistently puts up with last-minute
changes, frazzled editors, seemingly endless requests. He stays
every night until the bitter end. even if that pushes dawn.
Duran is reliable like no one else I have ever known. Sunday
night through Thursday night,day in and day out. Duran is there.
1 le never takes a day off, never seems to get sick, never spends a
production night with his family.
I don't know what we would do without him. Every volume,
staffers elect him "Most Likely To Make The Daily Implode If
He Leaves" — in fact, the superlative is named for him.
I'm the first to admit that I didn't do all that much for The
Daily. But somehow, my name has appeared on the masthead of
more than half of the Dailies over the last four years. And 1 was
surprised to find that due to my stint as a student member of the
Board of Directors, my name is engraved on a plaque in our new
office.
Duran gets no such recognition. When the paper looks partic
ularly good, people praise the (certainly deserving) students who
write and edit it, overlooking the man whose behind-the scenes
labor and creativity make everything possible.
Commencement is an occasion to celebrate my and my class
mates ettorts. Our names will be on the diplomas, and we
worked hard to put them there. But a celebration of the Class of
2009 should also recognize the many individuals — family mem
bers. faculty members, stall members, friends and strangers
whose efforts enabled our names to be printed in the commence
ment program.To all of the Durans in my life: thank you. ■
