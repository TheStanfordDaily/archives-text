The poet Stanley Kunitz once said that
"poems are bom of the wisdom of the
body." A former journalist, teacher
and U.S. Poet Laureate, Kunitz unceasingly
inscribed the wisdom of his fruitful life onto
the written page before he died only three
years ago at the age of 100.

"Oh, I have made
myself a tribe out of
my true affections"

Having already shared many attempts at
insight with the readers of The Daily, I turn
instead at this culminating moment to the
verses of Kunitz in hopes that he can offer
me — and you — some fitting final words.
The poem "The Layers" speaks not simply
to graduation but to a lifetime of turning
points — those that have gotten us all to
this moment and those which await us in the
near and distant future.
Although Kunitz aptly expresses the
grief that surrounds these perpetual mo
ments of change, he ultimately offers a stir
ring proclamation that resonates as we
emerge from this layer of our lives and em
bark upon new ones: We must not only ac
cept change but live within its textured lay
ers. turning and exalting as we start the next
chapter in our books of transformation.

"The Layers" by Stanley Kunitz
I have walked through many lives,
some of them my own.
and I am not who I was,
though some principle of being
abides, from which I struggle
not to stray.
When I look behind.
as I am compelled to look
before I can gather strength
to proceed on my journey,
I see the milestones dwindling
toward the horizon
and the slow fires trailing
from the abandoned camp-sites,
over which scavenger angels
wheel on heavy wings.
Oh. I have made myself a tribe
out of my true affections,
and my tribe is scattered!
How shall the heart be reconciled
to its feast of losses?
In a rising wind
the manic dust of my friends,
those who fell along the way,
bitterly stings my face.
Yet I turn.l turn,
exulting somewhat,
with my will intact to go
wherever I need to go,
and every stone on the road
precious to me.
In my darkest night,
when the moon was covered
and I roamed through wreckage,
a nimbus-clouded voice
directed me:
"Live in the layers.
not on the litter."
Though I lack the art
to decipher it,
no doubt the next chapter
in my book of transformations
is already written.
I am not done with my changes.
