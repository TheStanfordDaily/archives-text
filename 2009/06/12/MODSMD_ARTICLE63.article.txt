Minutes ago. 1 completed my undergraduate career. I emailed
my last paper to my last professor. 1 was basking in the glory
of doneness when 1 realized that I have one last assignment:
to write this column.
1 will forewarn you. I am not a columnist. I spent my time at The
Daily as a news reporter, desk editor and finally and most notably, as
Queen Bee of Art, Culture and Entertainment (What did you say
about last week's Intermission?!).
All this is to say that when I'm writing as "myself," I'm not in my
comfort zone. In fact, I have been so concerned with writingsome
thinginterestingbutnottryingtobeprofoundandobviouslynot-
preachyeitherbecausethatwouldmakemesoundcondescendingand-
selfrighteous. I've decided that I all I can do is tell my story. Here it is.
My Stanford adventure began years ago when I was told I would
someday go off to "college." My parents had attended a place called
"Stanford University," and that seemed to impress people, so when
my brother went there, too. I thought it must be worth a second look.
I know what you're thinking: Legacy Brat. Way back then, I wasn't
so sure why they took me either.The next guy had more activities, bet
ter SAT scores and had started a foundation for the rights of maimed
kittens. I was just another ordinary girl, from an ordinary upper-mid
dle-class suburb, with an ordinary interest in getting into a "top uni
versity."
I knew then, as I know now. that the day I was accepted to Stanford
was one of the luckiest (and in hindsight, well-deserved) of my life.
As I navigated my new home. I kept in mind the college advice
from every newspaper op-ed writer and high school graduation
speaker: keep your ears open, be willing to change, study abroad, talk
to people, meet professors, ask hard questions.
I dutifully tried to fulfill these goals. Yet whether or not I have man
aged all of them. I can say with confidence (yet another quality I found
here, I suppose) that I have emerged a different and improved Kelsey.
A better writer (I'm sure I'll regret this column later). A better thinker
(let me ponder that and get back to you). A more understanding
friend (who will dearly miss the ones I've made here). A more in
formed citizen (now. how will I change the world?).
The past few weeks I have begun to see Stanford through new eyes
again. Only this time, I am not seeing the opportunities I will have, but
the things I will have to leave behind: living and learning with smart
and interesting people, access to academic experts on any topic, per
fect sunny days on the most beautiful college campus.
Heading into graduation weekend. I am sure of these things:
I am proud of myself.
I am forever changed.
And maybe "you told me so," but. I think you did a good job. Stan
