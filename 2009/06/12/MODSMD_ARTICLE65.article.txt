# Senior REFLECTIONS 09

At Stanford. I've spent a huge amount of
my time debating and advocating for the
causes and viewpoints I believe in. from
Hillary Clinton's doomed presidential bid. to in
creased arts funding to the sanity level of Ron
Paul.This interest in the clash of ideas has led to
a long-running column in The Daily, Stu's Views,
but also to student government and work with
other publications. I have enjoyed nothing more
at Stanford.
What is most distinctive about Stanford, I
think, is not the Band or the weather, but the
openness of the intellectual and political dis
course on campus. It is very possible to get a col
umn in The Daily, or a seat in the Undergradu
ate Senate, with no previous experience at ail. I
certainly did this. The openness of the political
discussion here means that thousands of stu
dents are engaged, and 1 am pleased I got to ex
perience so many different viewpoints, which
have shaped my own evolving views on political
economy and America's role in the world.
While I look forward to immersing myself in
political life in the "real world." so to speak. I
will miss the experience at Stanford.The close
ness and the diversity of the people at Stanford
will not be matched bv anything I experience
after, and I will likely find myself surrounded
mostly by people who agree with me.This is un
fortunate. and it has not been my experience at
Stanford, and I think I am a better student and
person for it.
I think it will be impossible to close my time
at Stanford to my satisfaction. So instead. I will
cite the closing statement of Prime Minister
Tony Blair in his final appearance in the House
of Commons, whose feelings match my own:
"Some may belittle politics but we who are en
gaged in it know that it is where people stand
tall. Although I know that it has many harsh con
tentions. it is still the arena that sets the heart
beating a little faster. If it is. on occasions, the
place of low skullduggery, it is more often the
place for the pursuit of noble causes. I wish
everyone, friend or foe, well. That is that. The
end."«
