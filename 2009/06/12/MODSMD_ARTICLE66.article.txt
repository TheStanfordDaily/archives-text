By the end of fall quarter of freshman year. I could no longer write. I
would stare endlessly at my computer screen, watching the blinking
cursor on the blank document in front of me tick away the hours that
would pass before 1 could commit a single sentence to the page. My friends
chalked it up to a severe case of writer's block.To me. though, these inhibi
tions stemmed from something much deeper.
When I first arrived on the Farm, everyone promised 1 was more than
ready to take Stanford by storm. In reality, I was scared beyond belief.
Walking late one night among the vaulting sandstone arches that fortress
the Main Quad. I could not help but feel the weight of accomplished alum
ni in whose footsteps I walked or the sacrifices my Greek-American immi
grant ancestors had made so that I could learn at one of the world's finest
universities. I could not screw this up.
After struggling through weeks of intense reading and what seemed like
endless revisions of early drafts, my first essay was torn to shreds. I thought
it had to be a fluke, but the second essay fell almost as flat as the first. When
my instructor told me my final paper was not only unconvincing hut proved
the other side, 1 decided 1 wanted out.
Fortunately I had a supportive network of academic advisers and fami
ly members who showed me that I could indeed flourish and that I simply
had to stick with it. What I soon realized, though, was that I had become
caught up in a paralyzing fear ol failure pervading today's college campus
es, which drives our obsession with grades and resumes and discourages us
from taking on challenging classes or sacrificing our reputation in the name
of some radical notion or fringe ideal.
It may seem easy to dismiss my experiences as the product of an over
stretched high school student justifiably floundering in his transition to col
lege. But my story — however banal it may seem — reflects a generation
of young people unconditioned to deal with failure. Perfectionism has be
come a prerequisite to get into our most elite universities; by the time we
leave our nearly immaculate high school records behind, many of us have
never experienced what it means to make a mistake, take a controversial
stand,or —asin my case and many of my classmates — get a low grade. Its
no wonder that we stifle our creative impulses to try something new or
challenging.
Many bemoan the presence of a "Stanford bubble" that insulates its stu
dents from the problems of the real world. It was this safe environment,
however, that allowed me to break out of my own comfort zone and take
classes as dilficult as multivariable calculus and as overwhelming as inter
mediate microeconomics. It was this path that led me to The Stanford
Daily, which transformed me from a freshman struggling over every para
graph into a senior churning out articles on deadline in a matter of minutes.
A few days ago. I returned to an inscription in Memorial Church that I
often read at different points in my undergraduate years:"We must not de
sire all to begin by perfection. It matters little how we being provided we be
resolved to go on well and end well."
Today, we have all lived up to that promise. ■
