lam a photographer; 1
take pictures. It is my job
to observe the world
around me, to distill the
scene into one representa
tive instant, and convey
mood, emotion, feelings
and life.They say a picture is
worth 1000 words, but it
would take me more than
1 (MK) pictures to distill my
past four years at Stanford
University. And yet I am
asked to reflect about my
time at Stanford in less than
500 words. I'm afraid that's
impossible.
I am not a writer, but
allow me to say a few
words. As I look back on
these years I ask myself:
What has been my impact
on this University? How
have I affected people's
lives? What legacy will I

leave behind? We all come to this university because it is said
we can bring something to it. In the end,did we in fact do that?
Personally I would hate to think that my presence had no im
portance. no impact, or made no difference to this university
and its students.
People may not know my name or know who I am. hut I
take solace in knowing that my presence has made a differ
ence. I can look back and see that Stanford would be a differ
ent place without me; even though that difference is very
slight, it would still be there.
As manager of photography I take many of the photos that
appear in this newspaper. You have seen the world through
my eyes. My photos have influenced how you perceive the
University.They shape news, sports and features. What I leave
behind is a record — a record of how I saw Stanford and how
I helped to change it and bring something to it.
1 leave you with my final photograph for The Stanford
Daily. It's worth more to me than I can ever sav. ■

"I take solace in
knowing that my
presence has made
a difference."
