## Wolverine: An action movie with X-Men moniker 
### KYLE EVALDEZ 
Originally published on May 1,200V
These Intermission reviewers are huge X-
Men fans, so it pains us to have to say this: If
you are looking for the greatness that was
"X-2." you'll have to look elsewhere.
"X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is action
porn and blood-pumping at some points, but
it's riot epic on any proportions.This doesn't
mean you shouldn't see the movie — it just
means that you shouldn't go in with any ex
pectations of character or story develop
ment.
The movie begins at a furious pace. From
the get-go we see Logan (11 ugh Jackman) as
a child and therefore get a brief glimpse of
his home life. Logan's father is killed by Vic
tor Creed's father; Logan gets revenge by
murdering the elder Creed — who in his
dying breath admits that Logan was his son
as well. 1 ogan and his newly discovered half
brother Victor Creed (Live Schreiber) go on
the run and participate in various wars
through the ages — the American Civil War,
World War I. World War II and the Vietnam
War. After surviving a firing squad during the
Vietnam War. I .ogan and Victor (later Saber
tooth) are recruited by William Strvker to
join a group of mutant fighters named Team
X. T his is the first 15 minutes of the film.
We are barely introduced to the members
of Team X before they engage in their first
mission and Logan discovers that the actions
of this squad do not align with his own morals
Team X is in Nigeria, about to kill a group
of innocents, when Logan stops and walks
away. Therefore none of the characters are
that well-developed; even cult fan-favorite
"Deadpool." played by funny-man Ryan
Reynolds, is given minimal screen time and
thus no chance to steal the show — which
definitely needed to be stolen at times.
Logan then chooses a life o! seclusion, liv
ing with love-interest Kayla Silverfox in the
Canadian Rockies while he works as a lum
berjack. However, when Victor returns for

revenge and kills Kayla, Logan is consumed
by revenge and agrees to Stryker's proposal
to undergo the transformation into Weapon
X — thereby embedding adamantium into
his skeleton. The rest of the movie is Wolver
ine hell-bent on revenge.
The transformation into Weapon X and
the adamantium skeleton are two of Logan's
defining characteristics in the later X-Men
films and comics. We remember him as the
indestructible and gruff, aloof man who heals
unbelievably fast and can destroy just about
anything. You would think that given all this,
the Weapon X transformation that made him
indestructible would be epic. Hut it wasn't,
and the scene was in fact so short and under
developed that it was a serious let-down.
To us. Logan has always been one of the
more tortured and psychologically interest
ing characters of the X-Men crew. His cold
demeanor yet empathetic nature, and above
all his mysterious past, make him a fan-fa
vorite. Therefore, we wanted to see a movie
that dealt with the core of Logan's character
and his origins. Considering the title, we
don't think this was an unreasonable expec
tation.
Yet this movie didn't tell me anything new
about Logan; in fact, despite being the main
character that is constantly present through
out all 107 minutes of this film, Logan man
ages to come off one-sided and Hat. This is
probably because he never undergoes any
sort of character transition or development
throughout the entire movie — it seems like
he was just born the Logan we know. Even
the man/animal identity crisis that he under
goes is underdeveloped and barely memo
rable. In "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," we
learn about the things that happened to
Logan, but not really how he became
Wolverine. We wanted to love this film.
We hoped that this new "Origins" fran
chise would help reboot the series. Much to
our disappointment, all this movie offers is a
ho-hum action outing that just happens to
feature Wolverine and some X-Men mutants
thrown in.
