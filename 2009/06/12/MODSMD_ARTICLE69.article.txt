You may have heard of the
You lube Symphony Orchestra, the
online phenomenon that created a
symphony out of musicians from
around the world, of all ages and lev
els of expertise. From the 15-year-old
Canadian cellist to the French horn
playing I I professional from the
I k..a1l 95 musicians gathered and li

to play at none other than Carnegie
Mali. '
limothy Fee. a student at the
(iraduatc School ol Business ((ISB).
was the mastermind behind this ini
tiative. Intermission sat down with

him iliis p;ist week to talk about the
origins of the project, how it devel
oped into larger-than-life propor
tions and the awesome people he met
along the way.
intermission (i): How did you come
up with the idea of creating a
You liibe Symphony < )rchestra?
Timothy l ee ( IT): Well, first. I no
ticed two things going on in You l übe
about a year and a hall ago.at the end
ol .'OO7 First, people were becoming
incredibly famous through You lube.
This is a trend we hadn't seen before
the time it takes to become well
known has shortened considerably,
lot example, six months to a year
after becoming famous online, peo
ple could land recording contracts or
majoi deals. Secondly. I noticed that a
lot of mixing and collaboration was
going on online on a small scale. I or
example, there is a great video on
You lube called "I very Car You
( hase." which isa great mixof"< bas
ing Cars" by Snow Patrol" and
"I very Move You Make" by Sting.
People were combining soundtracks,
creating mash-ups on You lube. Hut it
was on a small scale, just one or two
videos mixed together in creative
wavs.

l lus was all a new form of creativ
ity that we hadn't seen before — this
talent discovery and online collabo
ration. I wondered whether we could
take it to the next level, use platforms
like You Tube to encourage online
artistic collaboration. Out of that idea
grew the You'Fube Symphony Or
chestra.
I worked at Cioogle at the time I
had the idea for this. 1 knew the per
son w ho was head of You Tube mar
keting and I explained the idea to
him. Me eventually became the
spokesperson for this initiative,
which was great because he always
thought big. We agreed that this could
be something game-changing. From
there, it jlist took off: We presented
the idea to a few hundred people and
there was great reception — the idea

gained momentum internally. Slowly,
a team emerged with people from all
areas of (ioogle. We were able to get
people seriously interested in this ini
tiative, even when it wasn't their core
job.
(i): What did you do to publicize this
initiative?
IT: A huge amount of work has gone
in since the original idea. It's amazing
how a team came together around
the world to support this innovative
idea. We adopted a strategy where we
allowed each country to attack how
they wanted to approach this pro
grain. We contacted the local (ioogle
team and marketing managers
around the world, and they had their
own ideas of how to publicize this. For
example, in Korea, the Google team
decked to go and find pop stars, ac
tresses, actors, etc. who would support
this initiative. There, they got Song
I lye Kvo |a famous Korean aetess| to
be the ambassador for this project
there are videos of her speaking on
behalf of the events. In Hong Kong,
the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra
played the piece that Tan Dun wrote
for this symphony in all traditional
( hincse instruments. Within (ioogle.
we had people pushing the envelope.

sorting out every last detail.
(i): Tell us about some of the more in
teresting video submissions that you
received.
TL: Well, we had 10submissions from
Azerbaijan and 10 from Kazakhstan.
On the You Tube Web page, we got a
surprising number of hits from Azer
baijan. We got submissions from a
total of 70 countries. Of course, we
got submissions from beat-boxers.
One of the ladies who auditioned and
was chosen to be in the symphony
played the piano — but her specialty
was playing toy pianos.
(i): How did you pick the ones that
made it?
TL: Well, we partnered with over 41)
different organizations around the
world. A subset of those helped lis
with judging — the London Sympho
ny Orchestra, Sydney Symphony,
Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra,
just to name a few. I his was great be
cause this means that we got the best
professionals in each section and in
strument to choose from the audi
tions. They helped us whittle it down to
2(MI finalists, and the final 2(H) videos
were uploaded to You Tube for the
community voting.
(i): You got Michael lllson'lTiomasof
the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra to conduct the You l übe Sympho
ny Orchestra. Did he have any say in
the final 200 contestants? Why did you
choose him for this role?
TL: Michael Tilson Ihomas had some
artistic say in the formation of the or
chestra — he knew how to put togeth
er an orchestra. In many ways.Michael
was the perfect conductor for an ini
tiative like this. He was always trying
to push the forefront of technology —
how music would be perceived using
technology. Secondly, he was used to
working with musicians from a wide
range of backgrounds, from diverse
ages, skill levels and expertise.Thirdly,
he's not just the conductor of the San
Francisco Orchestra — he's also the
director of the New World Symphony.
Watching Michael in rehearsal is
amazing. He has this ability to pin
point what musicians need to work on
in pieces and to bring out the best in
every musician at every level — which
was great, because in the You Tube
Symphony.our musicians ranged from
aspiring amateurs to the very top.
(i): From the very beginning, how did
you get people and organizations
around the world to help you and be
come involved?
TL: Well, the very first set of phone
calls I made were cold calls to some of
the top organizations — Julliard s
school.Carnegie I lall I wasn't expect
ing a warm response: I didn't know
what they would make of this new
idea. What I found was that, responses
started becoming quite typical after a
while. I would call people and give
them a 10-minute summary of this mi
tiative. I lien they would ask a lot of the
same questions — for example, would
the sound quality on You lube be good
enough? What if the webcanis don't
pick up the frequencies of piccolo and
bass? How will people keep in time?
Also, different places around the
world have different pitch levels.
Once we got past those questions,
the response was almost unilaterally.
"Wow this is crazy, but it sounds very
exciting." Each of these institutes had
its own idea ol how this could shift the
w hole classical music industry, bring a
new spark to the industry.
The London Symphony Orchestra
approached this from their own angle:
education. They uploaded all these
master classes to encourage music ed

ucation. At the beginning I just want
ed input from these music profession
als. Eventually, once we had estab
lished a dialogue. I asked them to sup
port the initiative in different ways. I
think if you went around to these dit
ferent symphony halls around the
world at the time, you would have
found posters and advertisements for
auditions in their programs and on the
walls.
(i): Tell me about the logistics ol the
Carnegie performance. I low long did
the chosen musicians sta\ there? I low
did the performance go?
TL: Well, the concert was on Wednes
day. April 15. Hie level at which the
players performed was just incredi
ble. Some of the winners didn't even
speak a word of English, had never
been to New York. But as soon as the
conductor hit the first downbeat on
the first rehearsal on Monday morn
ing, all of them played in tune.togeth
er. in synch. This was incredible
these people had never met each
other before, didn't even speak the
same language and were complete!)
varied in age — yet they were able to
communicate through the common
language of music.
Most of the winners arrived ovei
Easter weekend and the) rehearsed
from Morula) morning until mid da\
on Wednesday. So the\ had. in total
two and a halt days to practice li was
very intense, straight-day reheaisals
Everyone worked incredibly hard in
all of those three days.
In terms of the pieces played,
they were very diverse. It wasn't a
typical classical music concert at all

we had a wide variety of pieees. rang
ing from Mozart to Brahms to
Tchaikovsky to newer pieces by a
DJ/composer. The program was de
signed specifically to show the diver
sity of classical music.
(i): Do you think this You 111 he Sym
phony will make any musicians fa
mous?
TL: I think it already has.There was
a violin teacher from Bermuda in
the bunch. He was a very accom
plished violinist, but winning a
place at the You l übe Symphony
Orchestra lias energized the entire
country — everyone there was very
proud of him. lie's become a bit of
a local hero in Bermuda.
()ne of our concert masters is actu
ally a jazz violinist from Mexico; and
another violinist from Romania, near
Transylvania.has been in the Roman
ian spotlight since lie managed to join
the You Tube Symphony Orchestra.
Hi is is just the beginning; what these
people do with their music careers
will be very interesting to watch.
(i): 11 <>v\ did you get Oscar-nomi
nated composei lan Dun to com
pose a five-minute piece specifical
ly foi the You lube Symphony Or
chestra?
II: It was all very lucky, actually. I
managed to find out through a clas
sical music agent that he would be
laid over in Amsterdam from morn
ing until this specific time in after
noon. So. I got someone from the
Google Amsterdam office to pick
him up and drive him to the C ioogle

office, where I had a one-hour video
conference with him. I told him
about the concept of the project and
from the very beginning he under
stood the possibilities of this idea. He
was very excited — his eyes were
lighting up the entire conversation.
Once we were done talking, he
was saying. I want to do this. Obvi
ously he had one major prior
arrangement — he was a special
consultant to and composer for the
Olympic Games but lie said he
would prioritize our project after
wards and try to meet the tight dead
line. After that, we met once again in
Germany. I sat down with him and
described the project in greater de
tail and gave him the context he
needed to create a piece to fit this
initiative.
(i): Do you have future plans lor the
You lube Symphony Orchestra?
What's the next step, il there is one
planned?
II Hie original intent of putting
this together was to set off a new
trend in online artistic creation. l"his
v\as 11 demonstration of the ways in
which technology could be used to
get people to work together and cre
ate new things. From here, it can take
any direction. There are no plans as
of yet from the organizers. We'd just
been working to make it to the con
cert But in terms of online collabo
ration there is no question that
tins will have a future.This will defi
nitely have a life of its own: the on
line platform is there — we've just
shown that technology can be used
artistically on a major scale.

You may have heard of the
You lube Symphony Orchestra, the
online phenomenon that created a
symphony out of musicians from
around the world, of all ages and lev
els of expertise. From the 15-year-old
Canadian cellist to the French horn
playing I I professional from the
I k..a1l 95 musicians gathered and li
nalk met in New York ( ity last week
to play at none other than Carnegie
Mali. '
limothy Fee. a student at the
(iraduatc School ol Business ((ISB).
was the mastermind behind this ini
tiative. Intermission sat down with

him iliis p;ist week to talk about the
origins of the project, how it devel
oped into larger-than-life propor
tions and the awesome people he met
along the way.
intermission (i): How did you come
up with the idea of creating a
You liibe Symphony < )rchestra?
Timothy l ee ( IT): Well, first. I no
ticed two things going on in You l übe
about a year and a hall ago.at the end
ol .'OO7 First, people were becoming
incredibly famous through You lube.
This is a trend we hadn't seen before
the time it takes to become well
known has shortened considerably,
lot example, six months to a year
after becoming famous online, peo
ple could land recording contracts or
majoi deals. Secondly. I noticed that a
lot of mixing and collaboration was
going on online on a small scale. I or
example, there is a great video on
You lube called "I very Car You
( hase." which isa great mixof"< bas
ing Cars" by Snow Patrol" and
"I very Move You Make" by Sting.
People were combining soundtracks,
creating mash-ups on You lube. Hut it
was on a small scale, just one or two
videos mixed together in creative
wavs.

l lus was all a new form of creativ
ity that we hadn't seen before — this
talent discovery and online collabo
ration. I wondered whether we could
take it to the next level, use platforms
like You Tube to encourage online
artistic collaboration. Out of that idea
grew the You'Fube Symphony Or
chestra.
I worked at Cioogle at the time I
had the idea for this. 1 knew the per
son w ho was head of You Tube mar
keting and I explained the idea to
him. Me eventually became the
spokesperson for this initiative,
which was great because he always
thought big. We agreed that this could
be something game-changing. From
there, it jlist took off: We presented
the idea to a few hundred people and
there was great reception — the idea

gained momentum internally. Slowly,
a team emerged with people from all
areas of (ioogle. We were able to get
people seriously interested in this ini
tiative, even when it wasn't their core
job.
(i): What did you do to publicize this
initiative?
IT: A huge amount of work has gone
in since the original idea. It's amazing
how a team came together around
the world to support this innovative
idea. We adopted a strategy where we
allowed each country to attack how
they wanted to approach this pro
grain. We contacted the local (ioogle
team and marketing managers
around the world, and they had their
own ideas of how to publicize this. For
example, in Korea, the Google team
decked to go and find pop stars, ac
tresses, actors, etc. who would support
this initiative. There, they got Song
I lye Kvo |a famous Korean aetess| to
be the ambassador for this project
there are videos of her speaking on
behalf of the events. In Hong Kong,
the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra
played the piece that Tan Dun wrote
for this symphony in all traditional
( hincse instruments. Within (ioogle.
we had people pushing the envelope.

sorting out every last detail.
(i): Tell us about some of the more in
teresting video submissions that you
received.
TL: Well, we had 10submissions from
Azerbaijan and 10 from Kazakhstan.
On the You Tube Web page, we got a
surprising number of hits from Azer
baijan. We got submissions from a
total of 70 countries. Of course, we
got submissions from beat-boxers.
One of the ladies who auditioned and
was chosen to be in the symphony
played the piano — but her specialty
was playing toy pianos.
(i): How did you pick the ones that
made it?
TL: Well, we partnered with over 41)
different organizations around the
world. A subset of those helped lis
with judging — the London Sympho
ny Orchestra, Sydney Symphony,
Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra,
just to name a few. I his was great be
cause this means that we got the best
professionals in each section and in
strument to choose from the audi
tions. They helped us whittle it down to
2(MI finalists, and the final 2(H) videos
were uploaded to You Tube for the
community voting.
(i): You got Michael lllson'lTiomasof
the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra to conduct the You l übe Sympho
ny Orchestra. Did he have any say in
the final 200 contestants? Why did you
choose him for this role?
TL: Michael Tilson Ihomas had some
artistic say in the formation of the or
chestra — he knew how to put togeth
er an orchestra. In many ways.Michael
was the perfect conductor for an ini
tiative like this. He was always trying
to push the forefront of technology —
how music would be perceived using
technology. Secondly, he was used to
working with musicians from a wide
range of backgrounds, from diverse
ages, skill levels and expertise.Thirdly,
he's not just the conductor of the San
Francisco Orchestra — he's also the
director of the New World Symphony.
Watching Michael in rehearsal is
amazing. He has this ability to pin
point what musicians need to work on
in pieces and to bring out the best in
every musician at every level — which
was great, because in the You Tube
Symphony.our musicians ranged from
aspiring amateurs to the very top.
(i): From the very beginning, how did
you get people and organizations
around the world to help you and be
come involved?
TL: Well, the very first set of phone
calls I made were cold calls to some of
the top organizations — Julliard s
school.Carnegie I lall I wasn't expect
ing a warm response: I didn't know
what they would make of this new
idea. What I found was that, responses
started becoming quite typical after a
while. I would call people and give
them a 10-minute summary of this mi
tiative. I lien they would ask a lot of the
same questions — for example, would
the sound quality on You lube be good
enough? What if the webcanis don't
pick up the frequencies of piccolo and
bass? How will people keep in time?
Also, different places around the
world have different pitch levels.
Once we got past those questions,
the response was almost unilaterally.
"Wow this is crazy, but it sounds very
exciting." Each of these institutes had
its own idea ol how this could shift the
w hole classical music industry, bring a
new spark to the industry.
The London Symphony Orchestra
approached this from their own angle:
education. They uploaded all these
