Financial realities once again dominated
Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting, where all
ears turned to Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman for an update on the
recovery of his office.
"I think we all understand that we're in a pe
riod of financial crisis." Bravman began.
But the tone of the vice provost's report was
clear: optimism.
Referencing the creation of hundreds of
small courses, the upcoming launch of the Stan
ford Arts Intensive and a small expansion of the
Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP). Brav
man cited the recent 30,400 applicants as an in
dication of "infinite demand" for the University.
"That's how we think about it." he said.
Still, after a cut of approximately 15 to 20

percent in the University's general funds budg
et and a reduction in endowment income be
tween approximately 20 and 30 percent, some
1.000 of Stanford's funds are "underwater" —
that is, their current market values remain
below their historic dollar values. These under
water funds now pose the largest threat to the
Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education (VPUE), according to Bravman.
"We have built up reserves for a rainy day,"
he said, "but we have not built up reserves for
universal Armageddon."
Along with $<S million of the VPUE's funds
that have already gone out the window, Brav
man has also implemented a major restructur
ing of his office, compacting nine units into four:
Undergraduate Advising and Research (UAR);
Stanford Introductory Studies (SIS), where
most layoffs have occurred; Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP); and Center for
Teaching and Learning (CTL). which has lost its
administrative support but will be propped up
by the VPUE office.
VPUE Cuts
Bravman noted that the major impingement
has been on his staff — 16 layoffs, five hires for

revised roles and the loss of nine positions due
to attrition have meant an 18 percent reduction
in the VPUE's non-lecturing staff. Further re
ductions have hit advising, which slashed the
$750-per-year honoraria for its advisors and re
sulted in the loss of its HPAC (Head Peer Aca
demic Coordinator) and peer advising pro
grams, as well as the Sophomore Seminars and
Sophomore College programs, which will face
"continued reductions on the order of 15 to 20
percent." The latter two programs, Bravman
said, are where students will feel the pain.
But Stephen Stedman, a senior fellow at the
Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies and a former Resident Fellow of Larkin
House, probed Bravman on the elimination of
the HPAC program. The vice provost respond
ed bluntly.
"We received evidence that HPACs were
giving poor advice." he said. "The life experi
ence of a 19-year-old is not optimized to offer
advice to an 18-year-old."
Bravman instead touted this year's new Aca
demic Director (AD) program, which places a
professional or faculty member in each residen-
tial cluster that houses freshmen.
"We've seen, anecdotally — I
can't prove this to you — that ADs
offer a great experience for stu
dents" he said. "Knowing that stu
dents will always seek advice, we
should he paying professionals."
The Future of VPUE
Looking to the future of VPUE
programs, Bravman assessed BOS P.
SIS and advising. On overseas stud
ies. he noted that a large portion of
funding still streams from the Presi
dent's funds, and the program is
"extremely vulnerable" to swings in
the strength of the dollar. At the
same time, presidential funds will
largely fund the new program in
Cape Town, South Africa. With SIS.
the vice provost admitted that al
though PWR and IHUM run at
very lean levels, they still cost $10
million per year.
"I think we have to look at the
costs of these programs," he admit
ted. "We need to move on this soon
er. rather than later."
The VPUE office will also
launch a new Stanford Arts Inten
sive for 2009. which will he gift fund
ed for three years.
And on advising, Bravman re
mains optimistic that the benefits of
the AD program will outweigh its
cost.
University Fundraising
Martin Shell, vice president of
the Office of Development, fol
lowed Bravman with a report on
University fundraising. Shell re
ported that $ION million of the Stan
lord Challenge goal of $200 million
has been raised for scholarships.
"For the past four years, we have
raised more money than any peer
institution in higher education." he
said.
Still, for fiscal year 2009. the Uni
versity continues to see a slowdown
in cash gifts and new commitments.
"I think most people felt like the
world stopped somewhere around
January 5." Shell said. "Conversa
tions have elongated: donors are
slower to make commitments, ask
ing for more time to pledge."
Bravman will address the Facul
ty Senate with a follow-up report in
November, and. if asked. Shell will
return in the fall for an update on
year-to-date fundraising.
