As the U.S. economy struggles to keep its head
above water, Stanford will ax some $45 million
from its general funds budget for each of the next
two fiscal years. President John Hennessy told The
Daily on Thursday.
The $800 million general funds budget pays
most faculty and staff salaries, core administrative
operations and other non-research expenses.
The decision comes as the University is facing
both a steep decline in investment income and a
drop in sponsored research revenue, according to
an email letter sent to faculty and staff early Thurs
day. Signed by Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy PhD '82. the letter described "the
tightest financial outlook we have seen in
decades."
Bolstered by years of growth, Stanford is slip
ping into this period from a relatively healthy fi
nancial position. But not one of Stanford's three
largest revenue sources can currently prop the

University up — investment income and spon
sored research revenue are in the red. and tuition
"cannot be raised significantly out of fairness to
our students and their families."
"In fact, our students' need for financial aid is
increasing, and our commitment to provide that
support remains unchanged," Hennessv and
Etchemendy wrote.
The solution? Permanent reductions in the
general funds budget.
Etchemendy has asked each unit of the Univer
sity to submit possible scenarios for three poten
tial moves: a three percent cut. a five percent cut
and a seven percent cut.These percentages will not
be uniform across the board. Hennessy told I"he
Daily.
"it will be unit-by-unit,depending on the impli
cations for various programs," the University pres
ident said.
The effects of taking an ax to the general funds
budget are wide reaching. Layoffs are expected,
and various campus construction projects will be
postponed.
"To protect as many jobs as possible, we intend
to have a quite modest salary program for the next

few years" the two administrators wrote in their
letter.
Still. Hennessy told The Daily that layoffs "will
probably be done individually by [departmental]
units."
Hennessy and Etchemendy — along with the
Board of Trustees, budget groups and various
school deans — will reexamine the need for con
struction projects that would require the Universi
ty to "incur significant amounts of debt." and like
ly put them on hold, while reconsidering the
schedule of those in progress. The duo noted that
they "will act decisively, but not foolishly."
At the same time, the letter urged the Stanford
community to be more purposeful, to prioritize re
sources and to do things in less costly ways.
"After a period of rapid growth, it can be
healthy for an institution to pause and examine its
strategic priorities." the president and provost
wrote. "Our goals will remain ambitious, and our
contributions to society will continue to be sub
stantial."
Hennessy told The Daily that budget cut rec
ommendations to the University Budget Group
will most likely be submitted after Jan. 1.
