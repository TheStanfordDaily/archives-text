Provost John Etchemendy presented the
University's proposed 2009-2010 budget to the
Faculty Senate yesterday, making the big picture
of budget cuts clear after several months of an
nounced cuts in individual University units.
The proposed budget, which must be ap
proved by the Board of Trustees at its June meet
ing. was drafted amidst a projected loss of 30 per
cent of the value of Stanford's endowment.The
lowest previous one-year drop for the institution
was a loss of eight percent in 1974.
Etchemendy repeatedly highlighted the cen
trality of the endowment to the issues at hand.
"There is not a single person at the Universi
ty who does not benefit from the endowment,"
Etchemendy said.
The budget presented the first aggregate look
at the effect of the economic downturn and the
resulting cuts upon the University.
Many of the most dramatic cuts at Stanford
have come on the administrative side, including
layoffs of approximately 350 staff members.
Faculty have also felt the effects of the budg
et cuts. A University-wide salary freeze was insti
tuted for 2009-2010. with only minor exceptions
in the case of promotions and other exceptional
circumstances. In addition.many schools and de
partments have suspended the hiring of new fac
ulty or allowed vacant positions to remain un
filled. In all. 49 searches for faculty members
have been frozen.
ITtese actions have all come as part of an ef
fort to achieve $150 million in cuts to the disper
sal of University general funds over the next
three years, in accordance with financial needs of
the University and the room for reductions iden
tified by administrators.
According to the budget plan, these general
funds are a "critical component" of Stanford's
overall consolidated budget, "because general
funds can be used for any University purpose,
and they provide the necessary administration
and infrastructure for all core activities at the
University." How these cuts were achieved, and
their effects on the University's numerous com
ponents. formed the focus of the Provost's pres
entation.
General Funds
The largest part of general fund reductions,
totaling $79.5 million, came from basic budget
cuts to schools and administrative units. These
are also expected to provide over $90 million in
savings by the 2011 fiscal year.
By unit, these include reductions in general
funding of 12.2 percent to the School of Earth
Sciences. 13.3 percent to Education, 15 percent

to Engineering. 13.8 percent to Humanities &
Sciences (H&S), 15 percent to Law, 12.1 percent
to the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. 12.2
percent to the Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education (VPUE). 14 percent to the Vice
Provost for Graduate Education (VPGE) and
13.5 percent to the Stanford University Li
braries.
Hie weighted average of these cuts, in total,
was a 13.7 percent across-the-board reduction.

While the specific nature of the cuts varied
significantly between schools, their aggregate
distribution is clear from the budget.
Vice Provost for Budget and Auxiliaries
Management Tim Warner and Etchemendy both
also emphasized that the effect of the budget cuts
varied between schools, often depending on the
extent to which a given school relied on endow
ment funding.
"This year it's been particularly tough on the
schools that are heavily dependent on endow
ment income," Warner said. "Earth Sciences and
Law kind of lead the pack in that respect."
Speaking to The Daily. Etchemendy echoed
the mention of Law and Earth Sciences, and also
pointed to the challenges facing the GSB.
Etchemendy noted that due to its status as a "for
mula" unit, which ties its funding to tuition,there
is less room for discretion in assisting its funding.
He also pointed to its reliance on annual gifts,
which dropped significantly.
Etchemendy also said that the Hoover Insti
tution is facing serious difficulties.
"Hoover is being hit quite hard," Etchemendy
said.
Capital Budget
Etchemendy also discussed the capital budg
et, which handles, notably, construction and ren
ovation of buildings and facilities. While the fi
nancial picture for the capital budget is very dif
ficult to predict due to the size of funding outlays
and the multi-year commitments for most proj
ects. the budget does make explicit reference as
to which building and renovation projects will
proceed in the upcoming year.
Among the projects that will be delayed or
suspended are the construction of new biology
and chemistrv buildings.j» Redwood ( itv admin

istrative campus and an Academic Computing
Building.
Etchemendy noted that some delayed proj
ects, such as work on the Stanford Auxiliary Li
braries, must be completed soon.
"If we don't build that soon. Mike's going to
have to start burning books," Etchemendy said,
referring to University Librarian Michael Keller.
As for Memorial Auditorium. Etchemendy
said,"not in my lifetime."

"I think we'll be back in growth mode
again in two years."
--JOHN ETCHEMENDY, University provost

Major capital projects where work will con
tinue include the GSB's Knight Management
Center, the Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research
Building, the Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering
Center and the Center for Nanoscale Science &
Technology and the School of Medicine's Li Ka
Shing Center for Learning and Knowledge.
Strategy
In his presentation to the Faculty Senate,
Etchemendy worked to defend the decision to
make substantial cuts.
The University has previously employed a
"smoothing formula," which acts as a guide to en
dowment spending through annual fluctuations.
The smoothing formula spreads out cuts or
growth in spending over multiple years. If the for
mula was followed, the substantial effects of the
economic downturn would be spread over a five
year period, with significant.if'not drastic.cuts oc
curring each year.The current plan aims to con
centrate cuts over approximately two years.
Etchemendy said the smoothing formula will
not be followed for the next two years, as a result
of the exceptional circumstances.
"The smoothing formula works very well
when we're seeing the natural ups and downs of
investments," Etchemendy said. "It does not
work very well when you see major ups and
downs."
• "For there to be cuts for five years would be
damaging for the morale of the University." he
added.
Warner elaborated in an interview with The
Daily.
"Following the normal smoothing formula, it
would take forever." Warner said. "You would
keep cutting and cutting and cutting."
"The idea is to absorb that sooner rather than

later," he added. "We hope to get through these
cuts, and after them, in a year or so. see modest
growth."
Etchemendy explained the decision as an op
portunity to get the hard work of budget reduc
tions out of the way quickly and in what he de
scribed as the most opportune fashion.
"If you know you have to get down by 30 per
cent, 25 to 30 percent, you have to focus on that
number and make strategic decisions,"
Etchemendy said.
Hie Provost pointed to restructuring efforts
by Vice Provost John Bravman in the VPUE of
fice as an exemplar of the kind of response he
hoped to see.
"We want to emphasize structural and strate
gic changes within units." he added. "That's code
for: never let a good crisis go to waste."
Context
Etchemendy also responded to the often
raised complaint that,due to the enormous size of
the University's endowment and its total re
sources, efforts could be made to prevent budget
cuts through new infusions of funding.
"People ask.'Why don't we just spend down
the endowment, instead of making budget cuts?"
Etchemendy said. "The answer is that we're
doing that."
Ilie Provost explained that due to the state of
University investments, spending from the en
dowment's base has had to be initiated in order to
make up for the reductions.
"We do spend down." Etchemendy said.
"We're spending down at a frightening rate."
He further elaborated in his interview with
Hie Daily.
"We pay out of the endowment whether or
not we make money," Etchemendy said.
"That money [paid out this year] is entirely
out of the corpus of the endowment, not invest
ment income, because we didn't have investment
income this year." he added.
In his presentation to the Faculty Senate.
Etchemendy also emphasized that as a result ol
this spending, Stanford would have to perma
nently adjust to the new, lowered endowment
baseline. He related an explanation from Presi
dent John I lennessey that projected that a lull re
placement of the University's endowment would
take 25 years.
Etchemendy also said that expectations had
to be adjusted.
"We do not need toget back to where we were
in 2009 to be back." he said. "With the budget re
ductions behind us. and continued revenue
streams, we can begin to look towards new, facul
ty-launched initiatives."
He also expressed optimism at the Universi
ty's medium-term financial situation.
"I think we'll be back in growth mode again in
two years," Etchemendy said.

mula" unit, which ties its funding to tuition,there
is less room for discretion in assisting its funding.
He also pointed to its reliance on annual gifts,
which dropped significantly.
Etchemendy also said that the Hoover Insti
tution is facing serious difficulties.
"Hoover is being hit quite hard," Etchemendy
said.
Capital Budget
Etchemendy also discussed the capital budg
et, which handles, notably, construction and ren
ovation of buildings and facilities. While the fi
nancial picture for the capital budget is very dif
ficult to predict due to the size of funding outlays
and the multi-year commitments for most proj
ects. the budget does make explicit reference as
to which building and renovation projects will
proceed in the upcoming year.
Among the projects that will be delayed or
suspended are the construction of new biology
and chemistrv buildings.j» Redwood ( itv admin

istrative campus and an Academic Computing
Building.
Etchemendy noted that some delayed proj
ects, such as work on the Stanford Auxiliary Li
braries, must be completed soon.
"If we don't build that soon. Mike's going to
have to start burning books," Etchemendy said,
referring to University Librarian Michael Keller.
As for Memorial Auditorium. Etchemendy
said,"not in my lifetime."

"I think we'll be back in growth mode
again in two years."
--JOHN ETCHEMENDY, University provost

Major capital projects where work will con
tinue include the GSB's Knight Management
Center, the Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research
Building, the Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering
Center and the Center for Nanoscale Science &
Technology and the School of Medicine's Li Ka
Shing Center for Learning and Knowledge.
Strategy
In his presentation to the Faculty Senate,
Etchemendy worked to defend the decision to
make substantial cuts.
The University has previously employed a
"smoothing formula," which acts as a guide to en
dowment spending through annual fluctuations.
The smoothing formula spreads out cuts or
growth in spending over multiple years. If the for
mula was followed, the substantial effects of the
economic downturn would be spread over a five
year period, with significant.if'not drastic.cuts oc
curring each year.The current plan aims to con
centrate cuts over approximately two years.
Etchemendy said the smoothing formula will
not be followed for the next two years, as a result
of the exceptional circumstances.
"The smoothing formula works very well
when we're seeing the natural ups and downs of
investments," Etchemendy said. "It does not
work very well when you see major ups and
downs."
• "For there to be cuts for five years would be
damaging for the morale of the University." he
added.
Warner elaborated in an interview with The
Daily.
"Following the normal smoothing formula, it
would take forever." Warner said. "You would
keep cutting and cutting and cutting."
"The idea is to absorb that sooner rather than

later," he added. "We hope to get through these
cuts, and after them, in a year or so. see modest
growth."
Etchemendy explained the decision as an op
portunity to get the hard work of budget reduc
tions out of the way quickly and in what he de
scribed as the most opportune fashion.
"If you know you have to get down by 30 per
cent, 25 to 30 percent, you have to focus on that
number and make strategic decisions,"
Etchemendy said.
Hie Provost pointed to restructuring efforts
by Vice Provost John Bravman in the VPUE of
fice as an exemplar of the kind of response he
hoped to see.
"We want to emphasize structural and strate
gic changes within units." he added. "That's code
for: never let a good crisis go to waste."
Context
Etchemendy also responded to the often
raised complaint that,due to the enormous size of
the University's endowment and its total re
sources, efforts could be made to prevent budget
cuts through new infusions of funding.
"People ask.'Why don't we just spend down
the endowment, instead of making budget cuts?"
Etchemendy said. "The answer is that we're
doing that."
Ilie Provost explained that due to the state of
University investments, spending from the en
dowment's base has had to be initiated in order to
make up for the reductions.
"We do spend down." Etchemendy said.
"We're spending down at a frightening rate."
He further elaborated in his interview with
Hie Daily.
"We pay out of the endowment whether or
not we make money," Etchemendy said.
"That money [paid out this year] is entirely
out of the corpus of the endowment, not invest
ment income, because we didn't have investment
income this year." he added.
In his presentation to the Faculty Senate.
Etchemendy also emphasized that as a result ol
this spending, Stanford would have to perma
nently adjust to the new, lowered endowment
baseline. He related an explanation from Presi
dent John I lennessey that projected that a lull re
placement of the University's endowment would
take 25 years.
Etchemendy also said that expectations had
to be adjusted.
"We do not need toget back to where we were
in 2009 to be back." he said. "With the budget re
ductions behind us. and continued revenue
streams, we can begin to look towards new, facul
ty-launched initiatives."
He also expressed optimism at the Universi
ty's medium-term financial situation.
"I think we'll be back in growth mode again in
two years," Etchemendy said.
Originally published on May 29,2009
Provost John Etchemendy presented the
University's proposed 2009-2010 budget to the
Faculty Senate yesterday, making the big picture
of budget cuts clear after several months of an
nounced cuts in individual University units.
The proposed budget, which must be ap
proved by the Board of Trustees at its June meet
ing. was drafted amidst a projected loss of 30 per
cent of the value of Stanford's endowment.The
lowest previous one-year drop for the institution
was a loss of eight percent in 1974.
Etchemendy repeatedly highlighted the cen
trality of the endowment to the issues at hand.
"There is not a single person at the Universi
ty who does not benefit from the endowment,"
Etchemendy said.
The budget presented the first aggregate look
at the effect of the economic downturn and the
resulting cuts upon the University.
Many of the most dramatic cuts at Stanford
have come on the administrative side, including
layoffs of approximately 350 staff members.
Faculty have also felt the effects of the budg
et cuts. A University-wide salary freeze was insti
tuted for 2009-2010. with only minor exceptions
in the case of promotions and other exceptional
circumstances. In addition.many schools and de
partments have suspended the hiring of new fac
ulty or allowed vacant positions to remain un
filled. In all. 49 searches for faculty members
have been frozen.
ITtese actions have all come as part of an ef
fort to achieve $150 million in cuts to the disper
sal of University general funds over the next
three years, in accordance with financial needs of
the University and the room for reductions iden
tified by administrators.
According to the budget plan, these general
funds are a "critical component" of Stanford's
overall consolidated budget, "because general
funds can be used for any University purpose,
and they provide the necessary administration
and infrastructure for all core activities at the
University." How these cuts were achieved, and
their effects on the University's numerous com
ponents. formed the focus of the Provost's pres
entation.
General Funds
The largest part of general fund reductions,
totaling $79.5 million, came from basic budget
cuts to schools and administrative units. These
are also expected to provide over $90 million in
savings by the 2011 fiscal year.
By unit, these include reductions in general
funding of 12.2 percent to the School of Earth
Sciences. 13.3 percent to Education, 15 percent

to Engineering. 13.8 percent to Humanities &
Sciences (H&S), 15 percent to Law, 12.1 percent
to the Vice Provost and Dean of Research. 12.2
percent to the Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education (VPUE). 14 percent to the Vice
Provost for Graduate Education (VPGE) and
13.5 percent to the Stanford University Li
braries.
Hie weighted average of these cuts, in total,
was a 13.7 percent across-the-board reduction.

While the specific nature of the cuts varied
significantly between schools, their aggregate
distribution is clear from the budget.
Vice Provost for Budget and Auxiliaries
Management Tim Warner and Etchemendy both
also emphasized that the effect of the budget cuts
varied between schools, often depending on the
extent to which a given school relied on endow
ment funding.
"This year it's been particularly tough on the
schools that are heavily dependent on endow
ment income," Warner said. "Earth Sciences and
Law kind of lead the pack in that respect."
Speaking to The Daily. Etchemendy echoed
the mention of Law and Earth Sciences, and also
pointed to the challenges facing the GSB.
Etchemendy noted that due to its status as a "for
mula" unit, which ties its funding to tuition,there
is less room for discretion in assisting its funding.
He also pointed to its reliance on annual gifts,
which dropped significantly.
Etchemendy also said that the Hoover Insti
