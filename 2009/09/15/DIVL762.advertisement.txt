There's no place like USA.gov.
Have you ever wondered how the Wizard of Oz seemed to know everything?
Well, the secret's out and it's USA.gov. You can find everything from student
loans to government auctions and government benefits to, well, almost
anything. So go to the official source of federal and state government
information, USA.gov. It can make you as all-knowing as the Wizard of Oz.
