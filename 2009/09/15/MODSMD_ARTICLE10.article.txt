# STUDENT GOV'T
## 111th Senate Chair shares early agenda 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Coming back from summer break, the newly
formed 111 th Undergraduate Senate is out to make
an impression. From taking on party-planning
guidelines and instituting an events sustainability
checklist, the initial steps of the Senate have been in
tended to garner attention directly from their base
the students themselves.
While the Senate will hold their first meeting of
the term on Sept. 29, Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll
gave a preview of upcoming action items in an inter
view with The Daily.
"One of the big issues obviously is the Vaden
health fee," he said, referencing the $167 per quar
ter fee that has sparked student controversy and
confusion since its announcement in April.
The Senate has all but officially approved the
appointment of three undergraduate representa
tives for the Vaden Advisory Committee: Daniel
Leifer 'lO, Losmeiya Huang 'lO and Zack
Wettstein 'll. The Committee, which will include
Vaden Director Ira Friedman, two other Vaden
staff members and three graduate students, has
been revived from past years due to the spotlight
on Vaden.
But Sivaram casts doubt on whether the health
fee can be undone by the student reps.
"[The health fee] does not seem to be going
anywhere, but the Board is going to be investigat
ing," he said.
Encouraging sustainability has proved more
promising for the Senate. Before the summer recess,
the Senate unanimously approved a bill establishing
a Green Checklist for ASSU-sponsored events.

While the legislation will only apply to ASSU
held events, Sivaram hopes the checklist "will serve
as a broader guideline" and that they may eventual
ly lead to "stricter regulation for the sustainability of
any event that sees ASSU funding."
Many students will also be paying attention to
the advocacy efforts on revising party regulations.
Senate members are currently lobbying for a mid

die "level" for parties.
"We want a level that realistically reflects the
things that happen at parties but is still in line with
what the administration expects," Sivaram said.
The Senate will also have to interact with a
changed administration. The Office of Student Ac
tives (OSA) is now known as Student Activities &
Life (SAL), and jurisdiction over party planning
has also shifted. The OSA had faced student criti
cism for the institution of 'level' classifications for
campus parties, which students have claimed are
unreasonable and too rigid.
The Senate agenda also shows the influence of
new ASSU Executive David Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO,
who has consistently pushed for the increased col
laboration with the graduate population.
Along with the Vaden health fee issue, which has
particularly incited graduate students, the Senate is
looking into graduate student mentoring as a plau
sible advising replacement in the wake of budget
cuts.
Sivaram hopes to see an online system imple
mented by December.
The technology advances of the Senate can also
be traced to Gobaud, who came to office with a
strong background in technology. With increased
Web content and even posted video minutes of
open sessions, the Senate is moving more toward in
creased transparency and accessibility.
Currently, the Undergraduate Senate Web site
features senator bios and old meeting minutes, with
updates planned as the term progresses.
