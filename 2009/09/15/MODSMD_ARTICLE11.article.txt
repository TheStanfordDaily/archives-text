# OPINIONS
## To the Freshmen: 
### EMILY HULME 
I come with advice. You probably recog
nize my name from my picture, lovingly
emblazoned on the CoHo's wall, right
between Dean Julie and the Lopez Twins.
Or maybe you saw me on Oprah she re
ally liked my best-selling novel, Vampire
Discovers Wizard Boy's Secret While
Browsing the Louvre's Classified Under
ground Gallery. A good love story always
sells, ya know?
Indeed, you might have asked yourself
what a charismatic soul like myself would
be doing here; shouldn't someone of my tal
ent be busy benevolently dictating a small
island nation? Been there, done that. As my
Wikipedia page says, just as I was about to
receive yet another accolade, that of Pater
Patriae in the fashion of Roman emperors
of the past, I halted the ceremony. I could
never accept such a revoltingly Eurocentric
vestige of male hegemony. I was in a fix
Antigone herself wouldn't have known
whether to follow the divine laws of third
wave feminism or politely submit to the sta
tus quo. I summarily banished the nobles
and boarded the first Boeing to Palo Alto.
So, that's what I'm doing at Stanford.
Also, that producer from Dancing with the
Stars didn't call me back.

Now, believe it or not, I've learned a
thing or two since arriving. First of all, buy
used books. Did you know textbooks actu
ally don't lose information after sitting on
someone else's bookshelf collecting dusk
for three months? Second, everyone and
I mean everyone knows their major al
ready except you. Thus, from Mount Sinai
(read: The Dish) I have brought down a
handy guide to assess your appropriate
major in under two minutes.
From this list, pick the adjective that best
describes you: sassy, practical, sexually-frus
trated, very sexually-frustrated, free think
ing, pessimistic.
If you cannot honestly describe your en
tire range of convictions, emotions, thoughts
and anxieties in just one of these words, you
are definitely an English major.
If you picked sassy, you'd probably do
best in political science. However, if you are
harboring some romantic vision of life after
college that involves saving the world
though microloans and fair-trade coffee,
you probably will pick International Rela
tions and sell out faster than Cash for
Clunkers. (Who knew Americans would

take free money?)
If you consider yourself practical, most
people will tell you that you should be an
engineer. False! Engineering is totally use
less you need to get with the "truth is rel
ative" program and transgress those al
legedly "eternal" physical "laws." As any
drunk person can tell you, the following
don't actually exist: gravity, burns, a bad
quesadilla. Learn to wield a set of scare
quotes rather than a drill bit, and become a
critical theorist.
Sexually frustrated? Econ. Very sexually
frustrated? Econ on crack. We call this
MS&E.
So, you're free-thinking? We have a lot of
free-thinking people here at Stanford. We
also have a lot of Humßio majors. Correla
tion always proves causation, so jump on
that bandwagon.
Finally, if you're pessimistic, pick a sci
ence major, especially one that requires or
ganic chemistry.There is nothing like spend
ing hours assessing the relative basicity of
carboxylic acids to make everything else
just taste a little sweeter.
Oh, and welcome to Stanford.
