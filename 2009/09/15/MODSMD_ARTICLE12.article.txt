# 6,000 miles away: NSO

### PATRICK KOZEY 
When I started this column, I was on
a roof in Barcelona, looking over a
pool at the mountains beyond the
city, at some castle the name of which I still
haven't figured out. Now, finishing this col
umn, I am inside my room, looking out the
window past TV antennas at storm clouds as
they roll off toward the sea.
Another beautiful September is falling
on Stanford too, I imagine. The sun-dappled
bike paths are host to the footloose strides
of new students, skipping fresh-faced be
neath hand-stitched dorm flags flapping in
the wind. Occasionally their squeals of glee
slip out during chants of newfound pride in
Donner or Serra, in Trancos or Twain. After
all, they're here they've made it!
I know that many of those who read this
will be students in the newly-orientated
Class of 2013.1 welcome you, warmly and
sincerely. Trouble is I'm not around to do so
in person, so these several hundred words
will have to do. I want to do you a favor by
pointing out the things that probably did
not find their way into any of the remarks
delivered by University officials during
NSO. After all, any time we tell ourselves
stories to define ourselves, we tend to leave
out the un-pleasantries.
Here goes:
Yes it's not a mistake, you really were
accepted, but there's a reason the diploma
isn't included in the envelope with the ac
ceptance letter. You will have to work hard
and continue to sacrifice present pleasures
for the promise of future rewards.
Yes you will make some of the best
friends of your life in your freshman dorm,
but there are more factors in determining
friends than proximity, and I'll bet you five
dollars (in non-tenderable currency) that
any plans you make regarding the draw dur
ing the first month won't hold until spring.
And yes Palo Alto is a land of palm
trees that never seem to lose their fronds,
and planters that, even in February, never
seem to be without flowers, but there are

I want you to know that I
love Stanford. I loved it
from the first day I saw it
when I was 16, without a
thought about my future...

times when you will be unhappy. Sometimes
you will be very sad indeed.
I want you to know, too, that I love Stan
ford. I loved it from the first day I saw it
when I was 16, without a thought about my
future, and I love it this afternoon as I sit
thousands of miles away, thinking about
how this column will look printed in The
Daily. Stanford truly is a special place, but it
takes time to really learn why. And so I will
say this: Anything worth learning is hard
it will take time, effort and introspection.
Pan-sifting through the bullshit to find the
few nuggets of value que se esconden por
alii no es nada facil. (That was Spanish, to
prove I'm really not on campus.)
But, if you're reading this column, maybe
sitting in a dining hall, choking down a cup
of coffee with a surface that oddly resem
bles an oil slick, you've unwittingly stum
bled into the epoch of your life where doing
that sifting is your job. It's called college,
and if all goes according to plan, you'll be
here for four years. Congrats. When I get
back in January, I'll buy you a beer.
