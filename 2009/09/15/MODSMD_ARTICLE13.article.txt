# It's a Class!

### KEVIN WEBB 
On Sept. 9, Representative Joe Wilson
shouted at President Obama, Beatles
Rockband dropped like a silver ham
mer and, infinitely more importantly, my sis
ter-in-law Kaley gave birth to Micah Geof
fery Webb. Like many babies, he is small, soft
and pretty much useless at everything (ex
cept being adorable). Unlike the vast major
ity of babies, however, he is my nephew.
This comes with certain consequences, the
first of which being that I have chosen to start
my first column of the school year with his
birth. Now, as you probably can imagine, I
can (and will!) justify this topic choice by ar
guing that birth is apropos for NSO, as new
Stanford students (the infants) leave their re
spective home towns (their wombs) for the
bright, shiny hospital room that is Stanford.
Really, though, I just wanted an excuse to talk
about how incredible Micah is. You may
think it hyperbole when I say that he is the
most adorable creature ever to grace the face
of this or any other planet, but I swear to you
upon my steadfast journalistic standards that
it is not.

See, one of the many cool things about
Micah (and the new frosh, I suppose) is that
his prospects are literally limitless. Fie could
be an astronaut, a basket weaver or perhaps
even a dinosaur tamer, as by the time he is an
adult, genetically restored dinosaurs will
probably be enforcing the laws that evil, self
aware robots have made. It will be a terrify
ing time, but I am positive it will shape Micah
into some sort of humanity-defending, post
apocalyptic hero.
As for the freshmen, I am less optimistic
and more frightened. Unlike Micah, there
are far more than one of them, and their
prospects for being awesomely successful are
much more immediate most likely. (I ac
tually had a dream where Micah turned out

to be an infant super-genius who successfully
conquered the world at three months. But I
digress.)

As I am sure these new frosh will hear
many times over the course of NSO, they are
the smartest, strongest, best connected class
at Stanford yet.This is intimidating for every
one. For us upperclassmen, it leaves us with
the question of whether we could have got
ten in had we applied when the frosh did; for
the frosh, it means that they have the added
burden of being of even greater expectations.
Were it not too late, I would propose not
even mentioning to the class of 'l3 how tal
ented they are. Speaking as someone going
into his fifth year at Stanford, the last thing I
want is a freshman class that gets all snooty
about how good it is. Well, OK, I'd choose a
snooty frosh class over a Cal win, a diet of ex
clusively Axe and Palm fries or an earth
quake, but a snooty frosh class is up there on
the list.
The best thing for them now, then, is to
make sure that they know how vast the Stan
ford world is, and how much more we upper
classmen know about it. Try saying the fol
lowing as fast as possible to a new freshman:
During NSO, before the O Show, you should
swing by the CoHo for some froyo as you
meet your former RoFIo, HoHo and VoCo
(still here for their SoCo-s); some grad stu

dents might hit on you but it'll be a no-go for
the mofo-s.

If the class of 'l3 can follow all of that, it
may indeed be Stanford's most precocious
generation yet.
The other strategy I more likely will em
ploy with the class is to fool them into think
ing I am a cool person, much as I intend to do
with Micah. Part of this will be by providing
helpful Stanford tips.
Example: Freshman! NSO is a super busy
time, and while the events are better coordi
nated this year than perhaps ever before, you
don't have to do everything. This should be a
time where you're getting acclimated to the
school, not overwhelmed. Relax and enjoy it.
Or: Freshman! Have fun with your
IHUM, don't kill yourself over it. It's IHUM.
Or: Freshman! Skip Stern Late Nite, make
the trek to Lag. It's worth it, I swear.
Or: Freshman! Go to the comedy show
Friday night it's going to be the coolest
NSO event ever.
Upperclassmen: You should only call a
freshman "freshman" in order to assert your
dominance. You will also be asserting your
status as a jerk, but it is a grim necessity to
help welcome the new class into the fold.
More honestly, this is an exciting time for
the frosh and the rest of the campus, because
with each new class come new possibilities
the rest of us gain from, and hopefully from
the older classes, experiences the new stu
dents can learn from. And I think that's about
how I hope things with Micah will be that
way, when the robots do take over, he'll be
able to use his finely honed survival skills to
protect me.

Freshman! Contact Kevin at ktwebb@stan
ford.edu if you have any comments or ques
tions for him. OHHHHHH NINE!
