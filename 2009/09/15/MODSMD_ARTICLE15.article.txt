## ADMISSION DEAN REFLECTS ON COLLEGE YEARS 
### AMY HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
C f "W" "▼"ou never really under
/ stand a person until you
V consider things from his
point of view . . . Until
M you climb inside of his
skin and walk around in it."
Jimmy Stewart said that as Atticus Finch
in "To Kill a Mockingbird," but the words of
his favorite actor could very well be
Richard Shaw's personal motto.
As Stanford's dean of Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid, Shaw is the
man with the power to make or break the
dreams of thousands of high school stu
dents vying for admission at the Farm. But
not so long ago, he was the one feverishly
applying to schools and going through ori
entation.
♦♦♦
In 1968, Shaw was a bright-eyed theater
buff fretting over his college admission
essay.
"I was so afraid of not getting in some
where," he told The Daily, repeating the
words he's heard from thousands of appli
cants. "I think it's pretty normal."
Shaw was grappling with his admission
topic: Who was one of the great people of
the 20th century who influenced you?
"Those are hard questions because you
weren't too sure of answering the way that
you thought the admission officers wanted
to hear or telling the truth about who was
important to you during that time of your
life," he said. "That's true today students
try to develop a strategy in which they try to
game the system and tell us what they think

we want to hear, rather than talking about
what's really important to them."
Shaw decided to bite the bullet. He
wrote about Jimmy Stewart.
"I wrote an essay that nobody would
ever write," he admitted. "I said the person
who was important to me at that time was
James Stewart. I wrote about his acting and
his characters and the impact he had on me,
and that was really odd. That was an odd
choice because at that time, people would
have said Winston Churchill or Martin
Luther King. I'm hoping that it helped, but
even if it didn't, I told the truth, and that was
important."
It worked. In 1968, Shaw entered his fa
ther's old stomping ground and began as a
freshman at Dartmouth.
"I was terrified," Shaw remembered. "I
wondered in some ways whether I was a
mistake I think we all feel that way when
you start to meet others in the class and say,
'Oh my gosh, you did that?'"
Shaw says that a dear-old Dartmouth
tradition didn't exactly ease his move into
college. Until the late '6os, Dartmouth re
quired its freshmen to don floppy bright
green beanies to identify them as tyros. The
19-year-old Shaw wasn't too keen on gam
boling about campus with Dartmouth's
equivalent of a freshman red-nametag.
"I was really offended when Dartmouth
made me wear a beanie," he chuckled. "I
was so offended by that that I sort of sat
around in my room I was angry at them.
I frankly think orientations are much better
today."
Dartmouth took the playful freshman
hazing avenue of welcoming students in
Shaw's day, but he said that now, the admin
istration takes a hats-off approach (literal

ly) to opening its doors warmly to fresh
men.
"My hope is that in these orientations
and transition, there is a high level of com
fort," Shaw said. "I think the experience will
be a little daunting, but tremendously awe
some."
♦♦♦
Shaw's world was upended when he got
into college a culture shock from the
Ozzie and Harriet homogeneity he knew
from his childhood in Colorado and Ver
mont. America was embroiled in civil rights
unrest at home and trying to disentangle it
self from the disaster of Vietnam abroad.
"Growing up, I was pretty sheltered and
probably I was pretty clueless about what
was going on around me," Shaw said.
He woke up when he got to college.
"I've never seen student activism like it
was then," he remembered. "I saw students
lying down prone on the highway. I saw ac
tions of the Spartacist League [a far-left stu
dent movement] defending the Weather
men in Washington, submachine gun nests
on the top of federal buildings pointed
down at the crowd. Pretty interesting
times."
♦♦♦
Just three days before the May 4 Mas
sacre at Ohio's Kent State, Shaw found him
self in Washington, D.C. for the May Day
protests, decrying America's invasion of
Cambodia. It was 1970.
"That had a tremendous impact on my
perceptions of the world in which we live
and the challenges and issues issues

ceremony. Shaw reflected on his own college years in an interview with The Daily.
around access and opportunity and
for populations to be enfranchised,"
he said.

"I came from a very conservative
family," he said ruefully, "so it result
ed in having some pretty interesting
conflicts within my own family."
Shaw's involvement didn't stretch to
the peripheries of radicalism, but his
activism irreparably damaged his re
lationship with his father, the then-
Republican state chairman of Col
orado, who disowned him.
"A lot of that period was not so
much being swept up in radicalism
as it was learning," he said. "So, from
my vantage point, it was all-night
conversations for weeks about is
sues that were of concern to us
not just war but concerns over the
nature of society and the opportuni
ties that people did or did not have.
There were political debates going
on all the time."
♦♦♦
Shaw didn't come to California
until 1983, after nabbing the post of
associate director of admissions and
records at the University of Califor
nia-Berkeley.
"I was really blown away by how in
credibly diverse and representative it
was," he remembered. "It had huge in
fluence on me in terms of my career."
Shaw went back to the East Coast
as Yale's dean of undergraduate ad
mission and financial aid officer for
12 years until he returned to Califor
nia and signed on with Stanford in
2005.
Fast-forward to now. Shaw is a bit
grayer than when he entered the hal
lowed ivy-covered halls as a fresh
man, but every bit as passionate.
"I'm with young people who have
dreams and hopes for what is possi
ble," he said. "To me, why not be at a
place like that, a place where your
dreams are always ahead? At col
lege, you don't get stuck in a view
point. That's what it's all about."
Forty-one years ago, he was sit
ting slumped on his new college bed
with a green beanie flopped on his
head, discussing politics. Now, as he
beams out over the 1,700 new fresh
men at Convocation, Dean Shaw
will be speaking as much to the Class
of 2013 as to himself at 19 years-old
college is going to be a great run.

"I was really offended when Dartmouth
made me wear a beanie," he chuckled. "I
was so offended by that that I sort of sat
around in my room I was angry at them.
I frankly think orientations are much better
today."
Dartmouth took the playful freshman
hazing avenue of welcoming students in
Shaw's day, but he said that now, the admin
istration takes a hats-off approach (literal

ly) to opening its doors warmly to fresh
men.
"My hope is that in these orientations
and transition, there is a high level of com
fort," Shaw said. "I think the experience will
be a little daunting, but tremendously awe
some."

Shaw's world was upended when he got
into college a culture shock from the
Ozzie and Harriet homogeneity he knew
from his childhood in Colorado and Ver
mont. America was embroiled in civil rights
unrest at home and trying to disentangle it
self from the disaster of Vietnam abroad.
"Growing up, I was pretty sheltered and
probably I was pretty clueless about what
was going on around me," Shaw said.
He woke up when he got to college.
"I've never seen student activism like it
was then," he remembered. "I saw students
lying down prone on the highway. I saw ac
tions of the Spartacist League [a far-left stu
dent movement] defending the Weather
men in Washington, submachine gun nests
on the top of federal buildings pointed
down at the crowd. Pretty interesting
times."

Just three days before the May 4 Mas
sacre at Ohio's Kent State, Shaw found him
self in Washington, D.C. for the May Day
protests, decrying America's invasion of
Cambodia. It was 1970.
"That had a tremendous impact on my
perceptions of the world in which we live
and the challenges and issues issues

around access and opportunity and
for populations to be enfranchised,"
he said.

"I came from a very conservative
family," he said ruefully, "so it result
ed in having some pretty interesting
conflicts within my own family."
Shaw's involvement didn't stretch to
the peripheries of radicalism, but his
activism irreparably damaged his re
lationship with his father, the then-
Republican state chairman of Col
orado, who disowned him.
"A lot of that period was not so
much being swept up in radicalism
as it was learning," he said. "So, from
my vantage point, it was all-night
conversations for weeks about is
sues that were of concern to us
not just war but concerns over the
nature of society and the opportuni
ties that people did or did not have.
There were political debates going
on all the time."

Shaw didn't come to California
until 1983, after nabbing the post of
associate director of admissions and
records at the University of Califor
nia-Berkeley.
"I was really blown away by how in
credibly diverse and representative it
was," he remembered. "It had huge in
fluence on me in terms of my career."
Shaw went back to the East Coast
as Yale's dean of undergraduate ad
mission and financial aid officer for
12 years until he returned to Califor
nia and signed on with Stanford in
2005.
Fast-forward to now. Shaw is a bit
grayer than when he entered the hal
lowed ivy-covered halls as a fresh
man, but every bit as passionate.
"I'm with young people who have
dreams and hopes for what is possi
ble," he said. "To me, why not be at a
place like that, a place where your
dreams are always ahead? At col
lege, you don't get stuck in a view
point. That's what it's all about."
Forty-one years ago, he was sit
ting slumped on his new college bed
with a green beanie flopped on his
head, discussing politics. Now, as he
beams out over the 1,700 new fresh
men at Convocation, Dean Shaw
will be speaking as much to the Class
of 2013 as to himself at 19 years-old
college is going to be a great run.
