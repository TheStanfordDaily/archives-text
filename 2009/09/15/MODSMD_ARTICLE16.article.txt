# Alumni on board for send-off
## 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
If there's anything that unites Stanford
freshmen before they get to campus, it's
the long, often boring wait for a school
year that starts later than most other col
leges.

In the midst of their wait, however, many get
a sneak preview in the form of send-off parties.
These parties bring parents, siblings, staff, cur
rent students and alumni together to wish a
group of incoming freshmen well before head
ing off to the Farm.
Primarily coordinated by the Stanford
Alumni Association, the number of send-off
parties was impressively high; at least 78 had
been held by the start of New Student Orienta
tion. Thirty-three states and the District of Co
lumbia played host to parties, as well as six in
ternational locations Taiwan, Turkey, Hong
Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Toronto,
Canada.

Wherever the location, at the center of the
parties were the alumni who held the events,
most of whom had been involved in the process
for many years. Lyzette Wallace '9O helped or
ganize a send-off from black alumni in the
Washington, D.C. area, and said that alumni in
particular look forward to the events.

"I think it allows alums to remember all the
great things about Stanford," Wallace said.
"Not just the things we did, but the things we
wish we would have done."

Andrea Constantinides '99, who hosted a
Charlotte, N.C. send-off, agreed.
"I think the alumni really like doing it,"
Constantinides said, "especially because being
3,000 miles away, you get to get together and
share memories from back on the Farm."
While alumni enthusiasm is almost manda-

Tory for the events, the feel of a send-off party
can be very different, depending on the loca
tion.

California played host to 24 parties on its
own before the start of the school year, and
most were larger affairs featuring a high num
ber of students. In addition to size, however,
there were also more local affairs, with more in
tersecting backgrounds and smaller, tighter
knit circles and communities.

Californian Ellen Le 'l3, speaking the night
before her own Bay Area send-off, said she as
sumed she would know some of the partici
pants already.
"I'm expecting to see people I haven't seen
in years," Le said.
Areas with fewer incoming freshmen, on the
other hand, had send-off parties that brought
together either a small number of students or
many from a broad region, with some driving
hours to reach the nearest event. James Hill
hosted one of New England's only send-offs in
Wellesley, Mass., with 26 students attending
from a number of states.
Hill also noted that East Coast parents were
often dealing with apprehension over the dis
tance, unlike their children.
"The students are enthusiastic because it's
California," Hill said.
Wallace also found thoughts of the distance
weighing on students' minds.
"Some are excited to be starting college and
moving out west, and some are anxious," Wal
lace said.
The parties also brought home the differ
ences between the outlooks of students and
parents, all the more strongly given the upcom
ing departure from home. Jim Montoya '94,
who hosted in Sacramento, said their respec
tive attitudes differed.
"I think there was more enthusiasm on the

part of students, and more anxiety on the part
of parents," Montoya said.
Matthew Armistead '9O, M.S. '9l hosted a
send-off in Phoenix, Ariz., and split students
from parents when it came time for questions,
hoping to make the event more comfortable.
"I think and I hope that the students get
more out of it than the parents do," Armistead
said.

Students also said that, beyond asking ques
tions and learning more about their school,
parties offered a chance to meet a small sam
pling of their new classmates.
"I'll have a group of people to hang out
with," Le said.
Christina Nguyen 'l3, who attended a send
off in Denver, Colo., said the experience also
differed from admit events. There, even gen
uine camaraderie can feel awkward or provi
sional. But at the send-offs, students felt that
they could make friends without worrying that
their newfound acquaintances would be head
ing somewhere else.

"It was far less awkward than the admitted
students' reception," Nguyen said in an email
to The Daily. "Even if we had barely talked to
one another before, knowing that we would
definitely be going to school together the next
year made for more relaxed conversation."
More than anything, alumni emphasized
that the parties highlight what stays recogniza
ble about Stanford over many years.
"Watching the students change through the
generations it's neat to see," Montoya said.
"It's good to feel connected to campus life and
energy."
"They're the same kids I encountered in my
freshman dorm," Constantinides added.
