### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
£ r Y | oday's been a hard day
because I realize it's our
last day," said Myrna
Bernadel-Huey on
M Monday. "It's been an
emotionally very tough day."
Her son, Jonathan Bernadel-Huey 'l3,
is one of approximately 1,700 freshmen
who will begin their Stanford careers
today.
For students, beginning college is a time
filled with a wide array of thoughts and
emotions a new setting, thousands of
unknown people, relief to be done with
high school, anxiety about being away
from home, hope for the next four years.
Myrna presents a different perspective
the perspective of the parent who after
18 years of support is now preparing to say
goodbye to her child as he embarks on a
new journey. The Daily interviewed Myrna
over the phone hoping to tap into the mind
of the soon-to-be college parent.
The Stanford Daily (SD) : I guess we'll
start with the time of admission. How did
you learn that Jonathan had been accept
ed? What was that process like?
Myrna Bernadel-Huey (MBH) : Well, he
got an email. That spring is such a flurry.
His very first acceptance came on Pi Day
from MIT. And then they started to come
in. That time is such an intense time.
I was shocked [she laughs] and I think
he was shocked too that he was accepted at
so many places. It was only at his high
school's award ceremony at the end of the
year that we saw where he was in his class.
But that's never been what's motivated
him. I think it's been more about doing
well in school and his classes, being with
other students. He's self-motivated, level
headed.
SD : Once all of the acceptances had come
in, what next? What was your role in the
decision making process?
MBH : Well, he never picked a first choice.
He applied to 10 schools, and we were like,

"What are you going to do if you get in?"
He said, "Well, I'll cross that bridge when I
get to it."
We didn't try to influence his decision.
We had committed to doing what we had
to do to be able to support him, including
financing college. It boiled down to three
Stanford, MIT and Yale. He went back
to MIT and then went to Yale and then
came back to Stanford. Even when he left
Stanford's Admit Weekend, he still wasn't
sure. The finances would have been signif
icantly different. But we just sort of said it's
your decision, so he had to make it.
I think he made his decision in away
that was wise. I think he trusts his decision.
He based it on what he thinks he wants to
study academically and who the people
were that he met and what his other op
tions were if he were to change his mind. It
was about, what would the experience be
like for me at this school? And then he sat
with that question given where he was and
what he'd experienced.
I really thought he was going to choose
MIT. I was quite surprised. But I was re
lieved. More financially relieved than the
other. But we really let him search his
heart. We were just waiting for him to de
cide.

SD: Have you given much thought to what
the communication will be like? You're
from the Bay Area; do you plan to be visit
ing a lot, calling, hands-on, hands-off?
MBH : Well, I don't have a Facebook page,
but I think I may have to if he'll let me be
his friend. It's not my intention to be very
hands-on. I think that he needs for my hus
band and me to not be very hands-on. He
has already received a lot of overtures
from folks at Stanford for support and con
nections and mentoring and that sort of
thing, and it's important for me that he dis
covers that. I have no plans to be going
down there every weekend. It may be that
I'll initiate the call. Unless he makes me a
Facebook friend. Then maybe I can just
look at what's up and see, "0.K., he's
good."
It will be interesting to see what he
wants in terms of contact. I just have a feel

ing that he's excited about the experience
and will be fine to not have us there. I think
he needs the space. It's time. This is his.
That's why I'm so sad because I realize I'm
really going to miss him. And not just his
presence, but that he needs his space.

SD : Have you noticed that this summer
has been any different than the others?
MBH : Yeah, I have felt the time ticking.
But I started being aware of it like seven
months ago because I work with people
around issues of grief and loss. I'm a pas
tor, so grief and loss is a big chunk of what
I do. So I know enough about preparing
for it. Talking about it early is a big thing.
It's been a year of talking. And he spent
much more time with friends trying to get
in those last minutes. And there's been
some conflict of, "Ugh, why are you not
packing?"
We hug each other. And kind of go,
"Oh, I'm going to miss you." We are open
about it and don't try to ignore it. I think it
has been tender. The emotions have been a
little raw at times, pretty intense.

SD : Do you have any fears that come
along with him leaving home and being on
his own?

MBH : Certainly a fear that I have is, "Oh
my gosh, is it going to be too intense aca
demically? How is he going to manage?"
And whatever school he picked, it would
have been a concern. But even with that I
think, he learned in high school if you need
help, go meet with the teacher. So I know
that he knows that it's O.K. to ask for help.
It's one of those things that's kind of like,
"What if?" But I think he'll be O.K.

I wouldn't say that fear is what I'm feel
ing. I'm not feeling anxious. I'm just feeling
sad. And that is what's so hard. I feel sad,
but I also feel excited, and I'm thrilled.This
is such an amazing thing that he is going to
have an opportunity to do. So I'm thrilled
one minute and then crying. It's such an ex
treme range of emotions.

SD : What are your hopes as a parent for


AVERY WEIDMAN/The Stanford Daily
Jonathan's first year of college?
MBH : I think about this a lot. What
are my hopes for him? Which for
me also means, what are my prayers
for him? And I think it's really clear
sometimes what my hopes are, and
other times it's a little less clear. In
general, it's that he'll have a won
derful first year. That he'll be able to
face whatever limits he comes upon
with grace, without a whole lot of
harsh judgment on himself. If he
doesn't come out of it with a
straight-A record, it's not going to
be a big failure. That he'll be able to
have a good balance between how
to take things lightly and how to
take things seriously.
I hope he has a year that con
firms for him that he made the right
choice to be at Stanford. That would
be my nutshell statement.

SD : Do you have any final advice
that you would give to your son as he
embarks on this year and the next
four years of his life at Stanford?
MBH: I've been thinking a lot about
that, too. What will my final words
be? I know I'm going to say, "I love
you, and I'll miss you." That much is
really clear. I guess it would just be:
Remember that we love you. Re
member who you are. I don't know if
he knows yet who he really is, but af
firm who I know him to be. I think
he's a good person, a good young
man, and I want him to remember
that about himself. If things come up
that make him want to doubt that,
that he won't. And that we believe in
him. I believe in him. I trust him in
this decision he's made. And have a
good time. Enjoy it. Make the most
of it. Don't hurt yourself. And get to
know the professors. That's like the
icing on the cake, right?

MBH : Certainly a fear that I have is, "Oh
my gosh, is it going to be too intense aca
demically? How is he going to manage?"
And whatever school he picked, it would
have been a concern. But even with that I
think, he learned in high school if you need
help, go meet with the teacher. So I know
that he knows that it's O.K. to ask for help.
It's one of those things that's kind of like,
"What if?" But I think he'll be O.K.

I wouldn't say that fear is what I'm feel
ing. I'm not feeling anxious. I'm just feeling
sad. And that is what's so hard. I feel sad,
but I also feel excited, and I'm thrilled.This
is such an amazing thing that he is going to
have an opportunity to do. So I'm thrilled
one minute and then crying. It's such an ex
treme range of emotions.

SD : What are your hopes as a parent for


AVERY WEIDMAN/The Stanford Daily
Jonathan's first year of college?
MBH : I think about this a lot. What
are my hopes for him? Which for
me also means, what are my prayers
for him? And I think it's really clear
sometimes what my hopes are, and
other times it's a little less clear. In
general, it's that he'll have a won
derful first year. That he'll be able to
face whatever limits he comes upon
with grace, without a whole lot of
harsh judgment on himself. If he
doesn't come out of it with a
straight-A record, it's not going to
be a big failure. That he'll be able to
have a good balance between how
to take things lightly and how to
take things seriously.
I hope he has a year that con
firms for him that he made the right
choice to be at Stanford. That would
be my nutshell statement.

SD : Do you have any final advice
that you would give to your son as he
embarks on this year and the next
four years of his life at Stanford?
MBH: I've been thinking a lot about
that, too. What will my final words
be? I know I'm going to say, "I love
you, and I'll miss you." That much is
really clear. I guess it would just be:
Remember that we love you. Re
member who you are. I don't know if
he knows yet who he really is, but af
firm who I know him to be. I think
he's a good person, a good young
man, and I want him to remember
that about himself. If things come up
that make him want to doubt that,
that he won't. And that we believe in
him. I believe in him. I trust him in
this decision he's made. And have a
good time. Enjoy it. Make the most
of it. Don't hurt yourself. And get to
know the professors. That's like the
icing on the cake, right?

£ r Y | oday's been a hard day
because I realize it's our
last day," said Myrna
Bernadel-Huey on
M Monday. "It's been an
emotionally very tough day."
Her son, Jonathan Bernadel-Huey 'l3,
is one of approximately 1,700 freshmen
who will begin their Stanford careers
today.
For students, beginning college is a time
filled with a wide array of thoughts and
emotions a new setting, thousands of
unknown people, relief to be done with
high school, anxiety about being away
from home, hope for the next four years.
Myrna presents a different perspective
the perspective of the parent who after
18 years of support is now preparing to say
goodbye to her child as he embarks on a
new journey. The Daily interviewed Myrna
over the phone hoping to tap into the mind
of the soon-to-be college parent.
The Stanford Daily (SD) : I guess we'll
start with the time of admission. How did
you learn that Jonathan had been accept
ed? What was that process like?
Myrna Bernadel-Huey (MBH) : Well, he
got an email. That spring is such a flurry.
His very first acceptance came on Pi Day
from MIT. And then they started to come
in. That time is such an intense time.
I was shocked [she laughs] and I think
he was shocked too that he was accepted at
so many places. It was only at his high
school's award ceremony at the end of the
year that we saw where he was in his class.
But that's never been what's motivated
him. I think it's been more about doing
well in school and his classes, being with
other students. He's self-motivated, level
headed.
SD : Once all of the acceptances had come
in, what next? What was your role in the
decision making process?
MBH : Well, he never picked a first choice.
He applied to 10 schools, and we were like,

"What are you going to do if you get in?"
He said, "Well, I'll cross that bridge when I
get to it."
We didn't try to influence his decision.
We had committed to doing what we had
to do to be able to support him, including
financing college. It boiled down to three
Stanford, MIT and Yale. He went back
to MIT and then went to Yale and then
came back to Stanford. Even when he left
Stanford's Admit Weekend, he still wasn't
sure. The finances would have been signif
icantly different. But we just sort of said it's
your decision, so he had to make it.
I think he made his decision in away
that was wise. I think he trusts his decision.
He based it on what he thinks he wants to
study academically and who the people
were that he met and what his other op
tions were if he were to change his mind. It
was about, what would the experience be
like for me at this school? And then he sat
with that question given where he was and
what he'd experienced.
I really thought he was going to choose
MIT. I was quite surprised. But I was re
lieved. More financially relieved than the
other. But we really let him search his
heart. We were just waiting for him to de
cide.

SD: Have you given much thought to what
the communication will be like? You're
from the Bay Area; do you plan to be visit
ing a lot, calling, hands-on, hands-off?
MBH : Well, I don't have a Facebook page,
but I think I may have to if he'll let me be
his friend. It's not my intention to be very
hands-on. I think that he needs for my hus
band and me to not be very hands-on. He
has already received a lot of overtures
from folks at Stanford for support and con
nections and mentoring and that sort of
thing, and it's important for me that he dis
covers that. I have no plans to be going
down there every weekend. It may be that
I'll initiate the call. Unless he makes me a
Facebook friend. Then maybe I can just
look at what's up and see, "0.K., he's
good."
It will be interesting to see what he
wants in terms of contact. I just have a feel

ing that he's excited about the experience
and will be fine to not have us there. I think
he needs the space. It's time. This is his.
That's why I'm so sad because I realize I'm
really going to miss him. And not just his
presence, but that he needs his space.

SD : Have you noticed that this summer
has been any different than the others?
MBH : Yeah, I have felt the time ticking.
But I started being aware of it like seven
months ago because I work with people
around issues of grief and loss. I'm a pas
tor, so grief and loss is a big chunk of what
I do. So I know enough about preparing
for it. Talking about it early is a big thing.
It's been a year of talking. And he spent
much more time with friends trying to get
in those last minutes. And there's been
some conflict of, "Ugh, why are you not
packing?"
We hug each other. And kind of go,
"Oh, I'm going to miss you." We are open
about it and don't try to ignore it. I think it
has been tender. The emotions have been a
little raw at times, pretty intense.

SD : Do you have any fears that come
along with him leaving home and being on
his own?

MBH : Certainly a fear that I have is, "Oh
my gosh, is it going to be too intense aca
demically? How is he going to manage?"
And whatever school he picked, it would
have been a concern. But even with that I
think, he learned in high school if you need
help, go meet with the teacher. So I know
that he knows that it's O.K. to ask for help.
It's one of those things that's kind of like,
"What if?" But I think he'll be O.K.

I wouldn't say that fear is what I'm feel
ing. I'm not feeling anxious. I'm just feeling
sad. And that is what's so hard. I feel sad,
but I also feel excited, and I'm thrilled.This
is such an amazing thing that he is going to
have an opportunity to do. So I'm thrilled
one minute and then crying. It's such an ex
