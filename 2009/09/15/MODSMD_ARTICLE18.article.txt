# We're all freshmen once: Finding home away from home

### EMMA TROTTER MANAGING EDITOR 
If New Student Orientation (NSO) seems
hectic today, just imagine paying tuition in
cash or waiting in long alphabetical lines
inside Maples Pavilion just to register for
classes or buy football tickets. Maybe
Axess isn't so slow after all.
"It was a long and cumbersome process,"
said Ben Webster, a 1980 graduate. "People had
to stand in multiple lines, and everything was
done manually in paper transactions. It was a
zoo there were lines out the door."
Webster can remember the days when In
troduction to the Humanities (IHUM) went by
the name Modern Europe, recently changed
from Western Civilization.
Freshmen received less guidance back then,
Webster said, as orientation lasted just a couple
of days.
"I don't remember ever sitting down and
talking with an academic advisor," he laughed.
"I always felt resources were available, though.
I never got the sense you hear about at other
universities, perhaps across the Bay, where
you're just lost in the shuffle."
"There was definitely a soft landing to try to
get rid of the jitters and get people accustomed
to size of campus and where classes were," he
added, though he didn't remember any specif
ic events or speakers.
Many other students had Advanced Place
ment (AP) credits, but Webster had never even
heard of them growing up in Red Bluff, Calif.
several hours north of Stanford.

from the East Coast, who have only been there
once before or never, I'm sure it's an entirely
different feeling."
His family occasionally made the trek to
campus to watch football games. To a young
boy, Webster said, the old stadium looked pos
itively enormous.
"You'd walk up about 30 steps, then go
through those tunnels," he said. "Because it
was sunken, it looked so giant."
It was raining the day he received his ac
ceptance letter, Webster recalled. His mother
telephoned him at school, then drove over
with the big envelope so he could open it as
soon as possible.
"I didn't let the family down!" Webster
joked. "I was so proud to be there because I'd
looked up to Stanford for so long."
Webster lived in Donner during his fresh
man year. In those days, the Resident Assis
tants (RAs) were mostly graduate students,
and the Resident Fellows (RFs) were known
to throw parties with alcohol for their
underage students.

Still, as a legacy student Webster's father
and three older siblings also attended Stanford
he wasn't exactly a newcomer.
"I wasn't lost," he said. "For people who fly in

"I was always one of the prudes shocked by
that," he said. "Something's wrong these
people are supposed to be our caretakers."
Webster was also caught off-guard by ram
pant drug use, usually discernible by the smell
of pot in the halls. Still, he said he looks fondly
back on his freshman days.
"I really enjoyed being in an all-frosh dorm;
I thought it was a lot of fun," he said. "I remem
ber being sort of blown away as I got to know
the people in the dorm. I think about half of us
had been student body presidents."
The printed Facebook, still distributed
today, helped Webster get to know the concert
pianist, opera singer, world-class tennis player
and many other talented individuals living in
his dorm.
As a sophomore, Webster got caught in
Housing limbo, a situation in which some
upper-class students still find themselves today.
He ended up crashing on the floor with some
friends in Manzanita Court trailer housing for
an entire quarter.
"I paid each guy $lO a month or something

for the privilege of sleeping on their floor," he
joked.The following quarter, he studied abroad
at the Cliveden estate in England, a location
that proceeded Oxford, he said.
During his time at Stanford, Webster played
intramural football and wrote for various cam
pus publications, including The Daily.
An English major, Webster recalled taking a
Shakespeare course that met at the professor's
house in the "Faculty Ghetto."
"We'd have refreshments and sit around on
his couch," he remembers.
"All the professors had office hours of which
I almost never availed myself," he added.
As an upperclassman, Webster worked at
registration in Maples. One year, a student paid
tuition in pennies as a protest against the latest
hike in fees.
"I'm pretty sure it was in rolls, not just buck
ets," he clarified.
Webster's main responsibility was taking
pictures for student meal plan tickets. The main
perk of this job was making someone's picture
something comical —just a head floating in
mid-air, for example, or a face turned upside
down.
Not everyone saw the humor in the process,
however.
"I remember some people complaining, but
we would say, 'You're stuck with it,"' he said.
Registration was also a time for returning
students to catch up with each other after being
apart all summer.
"It was fun to see people you'd missed,"
Webster said. "People were generally in a de
cent mood."
Webster is the reporter's uncle.
