# It's crunch time for Orientation Volunteers
## 
### MELANIE SCHEIBLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The chant of the Head Orientation
Volunteers (HOVs) can be heard
from the patios of the Treehouse and
CoHo around 4:25 p.m. on a Friday
afternoon. It becomes louder as 4:30
p.m. draws near, reaching its peak at around 4:40
p.m.

The HOVs and Orientation Volunteers
(OVs) along with Freshman Transition Co
ordinators, Community Center Volunteers and
Community Coordinators will be dressed in
red, lining Palm Drive and the front of freshmen
residences on Tuesday for frosh move-in day
and the beginning of New Student Orientation

(NSO). They bear signs and smiles before they
descend upon the cars of unsuspecting new stu
dents and parents. Behind the scenes, the OVs
are every bit as excited as they seem, and work
ing harder than they will ever let on.
The HOVs are chanting for each OV as 120
arrive for the first of many pre-NSO meetings in
Tresidder's Oak West.
"[HOVs] love the OVs and we're going to be
best friends," said excited HOV Chris Jhunke
'l2.
OVs arrive from every corner of the campus,
only hours or, in some cases, minutes after mov
ing in to meet their fellow OVs and a plethora of
other orientation staff members. The meeting
leads directly into a group dinner and a party.
"The party was very energetic," said Eric

Miller 'l2. "The best motivating factor was the
alluring dancers."
OVs can be caught doing some racy dance
moves behind a table, while others can be seen
moving between a dozen dance partners in less
than a minute. They are putting together nearly
2,000 academic packets, assembly-line style, for
all of the incoming freshmen.
On Saturday, the anticipation builds as OVs
anxiously await the arrival of the freshmen and
transfer students. OVs receive their first two
hours of training, which consists of a review of
rules, logistics and the Alma Mater ("Hail, Stan
ford, Hail"). The bulk of the training, however, is
focused on team building and energizing, and
takes place on Roble Field.
Veterans of the NSO volunteer corps will tell

you that the NSOlympics are an intense compe
tition that tests endurance, communication and
intellect.
"Extreme box-moving encapsulates it," said
Annamaria Prati 'l2.
After they wash off their war paint, the OVs
dine and return to work.They spend the remain
ing days leading up to move-in preparing for the
arrival of the Class of 2013 and transfers ar
ranging 4,000 chairs in the Quad for convoca
tion, installing pipes and drapes in Arrillaga for
a parent welcome dinner, and decorating the
dorms.
They're finally here.
