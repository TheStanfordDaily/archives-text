# Stanford finds its footing
## Budget cuts, layoffs largely over after difficult year; funding for financial aid a looming concern 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
After responding to a significant loss in the value of
its endowment with a wave of budget cuts, Stanford ap
pears to have reached a point of relative stability.
The University's endowment is projected to drop 30
percent in value for 2009, the largest one-year drop
since 1974. Budget cuts were made to units and schools
across the campus, with some undergoing significant
restructuring and hundreds of staff laid off.
Having navigated its way through these cuts, howev
er, the University appears to have found its footing. In

an interview with The Daily, Provost John Etchemendy,
the chief budgetary officer of the University, said a shift
in attitude has taken place.
"We're not in a further budget-cut mindset," the
provost said, "and I would not say we're in a growth
mindset. We're in a recovery mindset."
Etchemendy added that the general economic out
look holds promise. "The stock market has come up a
bit, and that's all to the good. Things are moving in the
right direction."
One of the most prominent features of the budget
cuts were layoffs in many schools and administrative
units, and the full number is finally clear. According to

data supplied to the Stanford Report, 412 employees
were let go, with their positions now eliminated, up
from estimates of approximately 350 employees at the
end of spring quarter.
With these changes made, Etchemendy called fur
ther layoffs "very unlikely."
"I think we're in good shape, assuming the economy
doesn't turn around in the bad sense," he said.
According to official information released to the
Stanford Report, roughly 60 laid-off employees remain
on campus, largely due to administrative reasons. These
employees will have left the campus by the start of
2010.

With many challenging cuts out of the way, Stan
ford's financial aid program remains a significant issue.
Large expansions in commitments to aid middle-class
families were made in early 2008, before the extent of
the international recession was clear. Since then, budg
etary pressure, combined with the rising needs of stu
dents many themselves affected by the economic
downturn has increased the financial aid program's
need for funding.
While the University has continued to back the pro-
