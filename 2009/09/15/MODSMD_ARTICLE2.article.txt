# Stanford finds its footing
## Budget cuts, layoffs largely over after difficult year; funding for financial aid a looming concern 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
After responding to a significant loss in the value of
its endowment with a wave of budget cuts, Stanford ap
pears to have reached a point of relative stability.
The University's endowment is projected to drop 30
percent in value for 2009, the largest one-year drop
since 1974. Budget cuts were made to units and schools
across the campus, with some undergoing significant
restructuring and hundreds of staff laid off.
Having navigated its way through these cuts, howev
er, the University appears to have found its footing. In

an interview with The Daily, Provost John Etchemendy,
the chief budgetary officer of the University, said a shift
in attitude has taken place.
"We're not in a further budget-cut mindset," the
provost said, "and I would not say we're in a growth
mindset. We're in a recovery mindset."
Etchemendy added that the general economic out
look holds promise. "The stock market has come up a
bit, and that's all to the good. Things are moving in the
right direction."
One of the most prominent features of the budget
cuts were layoffs in many schools and administrative
units, and the full number is finally clear. According to

data supplied to the Stanford Report, 412 employees
were let go, with their positions now eliminated, up
from estimates of approximately 350 employees at the
end of spring quarter.
With these changes made, Etchemendy called fur
ther layoffs "very unlikely."
"I think we're in good shape, assuming the economy
doesn't turn around in the bad sense," he said.
According to official information released to the
Stanford Report, roughly 60 laid-off employees remain
on campus, largely due to administrative reasons. These
employees will have left the campus by the start of
2010.

With many challenging cuts out of the way, Stan
ford's financial aid program remains a significant issue.
Large expansions in commitments to aid middle-class
families were made in early 2008, before the extent of
the international recession was clear. Since then, budg
etary pressure, combined with the rising needs of stu
dents many themselves affected by the economic
downturn has increased the financial aid program's
need for funding.
While the University has continued to back the pro-
gram and fund its commitments,
Etchemendy described the pro
gram as a pressing concern.
"By far, the biggest hole that we
have deficit that we have â€”is
the financial aid deficit," he said.
"It's far bigger than we expected."
"We need to raise a lot more fi
nancial aid endowment," he added.
Etchemendy also noted that
funding needs had doubled early
expectations. "We had originally
thought the new program cost us
$2O million, but it's [now] a $4O mil
lion deficit," he said. "We had
planned over the next couple years
to do the fundraising necessary, and
paid for it with one-time funds."
"Obviously, there's a big differ
ence between a $2O million and $4O
million deficit," the provost added.
The University will pursue addi
tional funding to make up for the
shortfall, but Etchemendy noted
that if funds fail to materialize, dif
ficult choices might be necessary.
"If we can't raise the funds, that
would be a huge hit on the general
funds budget," he said. "Then we'd
have to make a decision, because
something has to give. In some
sense, that's the other shoe that
we're hoping won't ever drop."
The University will also need to
seek additional funding to fill fac
ulty positions. Currently, it has 49
faculty billets that have been kept
open to save salary costs. Until the
necessary funding returns, outside
donors will play a crucial role in
faculty hiring.
"What is going to happen now is
the deans are going to look for
donors to provide endowed
chairs," Etchemendy said.
In the wake of the economic cri
sis that set in motion the endow
ment loss, Etchemendy empha
sized Stanford's investment strate
gy will remain adaptive yet contin
ue to assume risk in search of sig
nificant growth.
"There is a constant reassess
ment made all the time about
things like investment risk," the
provost said. "Part of the reason
that you get high returns is accept
ing risk."
