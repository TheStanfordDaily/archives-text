## ROAD UPS AND DOWNS 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After effortlessly dispensing Washington
State a week ago, the Cardinal saw a win
against Wake Forest evaporate in the closing
seconds of Saturday's contest, losing 17-24.
Stanford finished its early road slate 1-1 in a
season that carries the first serious bowl ex
pectations of coach Jim Harbaugh's three
year tenure on the Farm.
The Cardinal began the 2009 season in
Pullman, Wash, on Sept. 5, and wasted no time
making its presence known in a 39-13 victory.
After pummeling the Cougars 58-0 at home
last year, Stanford jumped out to a 22-3 half
time lead on the backs of stars both familiar
and new.

Senior running back Toby Gerhart, who
set the school single season rushing record
last year, picked up where he left off, punch
ing in the Cardinal's first points with a one
yard run on the game's opening drive.
Gerhart would finish with 121 yards on 23
carries, including two touchdowns. However,
the game served primarily as the coming out
party for wide receiver Chris Owusu. The
speedy sophomore scored twice, first on a
short screen pass that he took 63 yards for a
touchdown, and second on an 85-yard kick
return. Owusu was named Pac-10 Special
Teams Player of the Week for his effort.
Perhaps most importantly, the offense,
under the leadership of highly touted redshirt
freshman quarterback Andrew Luck, did not
turn the ball over a goal that Harbaugh
has continually set throughout his time at
Stanford.
"I thought they really kept their compo
sure well," Harbaugh said. "No penalties in
the first half and no turnovers the entire
game. There was some really good play by in
dividuals and some really good play collec
tively."
Luck, who took over the starting job from
senior Tavita Pritchard in spring ball, debuted
with 193 yards through the air and 54 on the
ground.
"He did very well, he ran the team and had
exceptional poise out there. He made some
big plays for us and threw some balls that
were right on the money," said Harbaugh.
Gerhart echoed his coach's comments.
"There were a bunch of young guys that
played today and did well, and it's good for
them to get the feel for the college game, and
they're only going to get better," he said.
That certainly appeared true in the first
half against Wake Forest, when Stanford
jumped out to a 17-3 lead early in the game.
Even though the game started at 9 a.m. Pacif
ic Time, Harbaugh and his staff went to great
lengths, such as waking the team up before
dawn for a week beforehand, to make sure
that the Cardinal would not be tired. It

showed: Stanford came flying out of the lock
er room, as Luck hit junior Ryan Whalen on
a beautiful toss reeled in with an even bet
ter catch for a 26-yard touchdown on the
opening drive of the game.
Luck and Whalen would hook up again
for a score in the second quarter, and transfer
Nate Whitaker's 54-yard field goal tied
for the longest in BB&T Field history as
time expired in the half seemed to give the
Cardinal a dominant advantage.
But the Demon Deacons would not go
quietly. Two consecutive touchdowns tied the
game in the fourth quarter, as a combination
of Stanford's poor tackling, Wake Forest's
nice offensive line work and a gutsy fourth
down call one touchdown was scored on a
4th and 4 play where Wake quarterback
Riley Skinner was nearly sacked, but man
aged to find receiver Jordan Williams in the
end zone helped even the score.
Still, the Cardinal found itself with the ball
with less than five minutes left, and behind
Luck and Gerhart, started driving. But then
controversy struck.
On 3rd and 1 from the Wake 34 yard line,
Gerhart broke a long run deep into Demon
Deacon territory that seemed to set Stanford

up for a field goal, at the least. But it was
called back because of a clipping penalty on
senior tackle Chris Marinelli. The problem?
Replays showed that Marinelli never clipped
his defender, nor came particularly close to
doing so.
"I got a good look at it," Harbaugh said.
"It was a good block from my perspective.
He made the block, ran about 10 yards and
then the flag came out. It looked like a clean
block to me. We did a good job converting on
third down, and they would find something
to throw the flag about."
The penalty moved the Cardinal back to
3rd and 13, where they were unable to con
vert. Still, despite the unfortunate flag, Stan
ford had its chances to keep Wake Forest off
the board, but on 3rd and 9 from the Cardinal
46, running back Lovell Jackson cut through
the secondary, where Skinner found him for
a 44-yard reception that set up Skinner's
eventual touchdown run with two seconds
left.

"We let somebody get behind our second
ary. You have to stay as deep as the deepest
(receiver), and we didn't do that," Harbaugh
said.

The Cardinal's loss was not without a sil
ver lining. Senior linebacker Clint Snyder
and sophomore defensive end Tom Keiser,
two of the main cogs of Stanford's defense,
had impressive games for the second straight
week. Whalen finished with 123 yards on
nine catches, and Luck's performance 23-
34 for 276 yards, two touchdowns and one in
terceptionâ€” was particularly noteworthy
for a freshman playing in only his second
game. But offensively, Stanford tallied only
104 yards in the second half after putting to
gether 284 yards over the first two quarters,
as they had a hard time solving a Wake For
est defense that, in the words of Deacons'
coach Jim Grobe, "turned it loose" in the sec
ond half.
Stanford will have a chance to rebound
this coming Saturday against San Jose State
in the Cardinal's home opener. The Spartans
lost at Stanford Stadium 23-10 last season. If
the Cardinal hopes to reach the magic six
wins it needs to be eligible for a bowl game, it
will need to put together successful games
against San Jose State and its succeeding op
ponents, Washington and UCLA. Stanford
finishes the year with a particularly brutal
stretch, with Oregon, No. 3 USC, No. 8 Cal
and Notre Dame all in November, and
learned a hard lesson last season, dropping its
last three to fall one game shy of qualifying
for a bowl. The early matchups, then, are crit
ical, and starting with the Spartans this week,
the Cardinal cannot settle for any more moral
victories.
