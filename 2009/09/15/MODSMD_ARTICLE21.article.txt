# Women look to return to Final Four
## 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
The 2008 season was a fantastic one
for the Stanford women's soccer team,
considered by many as the best in the
program's history. The Cardinal went 22-
2-1 on the year and made it to the Col
lege Cup for only the second time in
school history. The team lost a narrow 1-
0 match to Notre Dame in the semifi
nals, but it still made Stanford history.
Facing this lofty precedent, this year's
team has only one thing in mind: im
provement. And with all but two of last
year's starters returning, the team has a
great chance to do just that.
The Cardinal attack has lived up to its
billing so far this season, notching 21
goals in its first six games and leading the
team to a perfect 7-0-0 start. A 6-2 win at
Hawaii, a 5-2 win against San Diego
State and 5-0 trouncing over Virginia
Tech quickly showed that this year's
team has what it takes. However, the
Card has also squeaked through several
close calls, grinding out one-goal wins
over Cal Poly, UNC-Greensboro and
No. 7 Purdue.
The No. 3 Cardinal is blessed with the
return of its star goalkeeper, junior Kira
Maker. Going into the 2009 season,
Maker had already posted a remarkable
16 shutouts in 35 starts while posting a
goals-against-average of under .5. She
has also earned four wins for the Cardi
nal this year. While Maker has started
every game so far this season, she'll be
facing some stiff in-team competition
from freshmen Lindsay Dickerson and
Aly Gleason. Both freshmen have al
ready proved their skill at high levels
Dickerson was an All-American in high
school and played for three national
teams, while Gleason was recognized as
the 2009 Central California Conference
MVP.

The Cardinal's biggest losses to grad
uation were star center backs Marisa

Abegg and Allison Falk. Abegg and Falk
served as co-captains last season and
started every match throughout their
time on the Stanford roster. Falk also
earned her way onto the Pac-10 Second
Team last year. The Cardinal faces no
small task in filling in the gaps left by
their absence, but head coach Paul Rat
cliffe holds some impressive options.
Returning outside defenders Ali
Riley and Alicia Jenkins, who has been
playing in the center of defense this year,
should continue to frustrate opposing
offenses. Holding midfielder Allison
McCann can help out in the backline as
well.

Thankfully for Ratcliffe, several
freshmen look poised to help tighten his
team's defense. Alina Garciamendez
and Rachel Quon have staked claim to
spots at center back and right back, re
spectively, and Madeleine Thompson,

Nina Watkins and Annie Case along
with redshirt junior Katie Riley will
provide more depth for the Cardinal de
fense.

While organizing the defense re
mains a high priority, Ratcliffe will also
have to manage some powerful tools in
the midfield. Sophomore Teresa Noyola,
who brings her speed and sharp-shoot
ing abilities to the field, has already
racked up six points this season. Fellow
sophomore Camille Levin, who is al
ways a threat to score long-distance
goals, started every match last year, and
senior Kristin Stannard is comfortable
operating in either an attacking or de
fensive midfield role. McCann and
freshman Mariah Nogueira both started
matches at defensive midfield this year,
and will be key to breaking up oppo

nents' attacks. Redshirt senior Hillary
Heath will bring experience and
strength to the center of the pitch.
Stanford had an explosive offense
last year that helped power them
through their nearly perfect regular sea
son and looks to feed off of this return
ing strength. Christen Press 'll led the
Pac-10 in points with 43 and tied team
mate Lindsay Taylor 'l2 for the lead in
goals scored with 16, while Kelley
O'Hara 'O9 notched a Pac-10 best 12 as
sists. All of them return to the squad this
year, and Press and O'Hara both have
double-digit points already. Dangerous
junior Morgan Redman joins this win
ning lineup, as well as freshman Court
ney Verloo. Verloo's extensive high-
