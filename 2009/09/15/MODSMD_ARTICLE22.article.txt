## Cardinal ready to rebound from subpar season 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's soccer looks to have assembled all the pieces
necessary for a breakthrough performance this year. Coming off
an extremely frustrating 2008 season, the squad is primed to

make the NCAA
tournament for the
first time since 2002,
when it made a run
all the way to the
championship game.
If the Cardinal (2-
1-0) hopes to regain
its past form, it will
need to figure out a
way to turbo-charge
an offense that strug
gled to produce in its
last campaign. So far,
the team has man
aged to do just that,
scoring six goals in its
first three contests.
Last season, it took
nine games for the
team to net six goals.
"Last year was a
disappointing sea
son," said head coach

Brett Simon. "We felt that we were ready to move forward ...
but couldn't quite get over the hump."
Stanford was consistently competitive last year despite a 4-
11-3 record, with nine of those losses coming by only a single
goal a school record.
Simon's chief focus, however, is maintaining the quality of
play on the defensive side of the ball. Defense was a strength for
the Cardinal last season, never allowing more than two goals in
a game.
"Defending will make the difference," Simon emphasized.
"The best attacking chances come from defending."

GAME NOTES: Stanford looks to rebound from a
disappointing season last year. The Cardinal has
won two of its first three games this season. It will
face Santa Clara on the road in the first game of
the Bay Area Classic.

Showing commitment to this phi
losophy, Simon moved the team's
leading scorer from 2008, Bobby
Warshaw, into central defense a
brand new role for him this year.
Warshaw was recently named to the
38-athlete Herman Trophy Watch
List, considered to be college soccer's
highest individual honor.
The move is partially enabled by
the return of two important players
who were injured early last season.
Both Evan Morgan and T.J. Novak
were given medical redshirts last
season. Morgan, a sixth-year senior,
was the team's leading scorer in
2006, before missing the last two sea
sons with knee injuries. This will be
Novak's fifth season.
Both started last Friday's home
opener, a solid 3-2 win over Cal Poly
(0-3-0). Morgan already proved
what a benefit his return will pro
vide, tallying a goal and an assist in
that win.
"I am thrilled with the win,"
Simon told GoStanford.com follow
ing the game. "I think our offense is
starting to catch up."
The Cardinal rallied to win two in
a row after dropping its first regular
season game, a 2-1 loss at Lehigh. The
Stanford men completed their East

Coast swing with a 2-0 victory at Rut
gers. Sophomore Garrett Gunther
scored in both games, an encouraging
sign that some of the young players
are making an early impact.
"I felt good about the trip; I think
we made progress," Simon said. "It
was a big win over Rutgers. It's a
very difficult place to play."
Stanford is hoping not only to
make the tournament again, but also
to regain its perch at the top of the
Pac-10, something it hasn't been able
to do since 2001. But the Cardinal
still has a difficult road ahead, as it
will be competing against two very
strong teams in UCLA and Cal.
Stanford was ranked third in the
Pac-10 in the preseason coaches'
poll behind those two teams.

With so much to be excited about,
the chances of a strong rebound per
formance for the Cardinal appear to
be very good, and a return to the
NCAA tournament is very much
within reach. The men's team opens
Pac-10 play on Oct. 2 at Berkeley
and finishes conference play at
home on Nov. 14, also against arch
rival Cal. Other important home
games include matchups with Air
Force and New Mexico on Sept. 25
and Sept. 27 during the Stanford
Nike Classic, and back-to-back
games against San Diego State and
UCLA on Oct. 23 and Oct. 25.
