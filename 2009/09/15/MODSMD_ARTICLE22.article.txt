## Cardinal ready to rebound from subpar season 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's soccer looks to have assembled all the pieces
necessary for a breakthrough performance this year. Coming off
an extremely frustrating 2008 season, the squad is primed to

make the NCAA
tournament for the
first time since 2002,
when it made a run
all the way to the
championship game.
If the Cardinal (2-
1-0) hopes to regain
its past form, it will
need to figure out a
way to turbo-charge
an offense that strug
gled to produce in its
last campaign. So far,
the team has man
aged to do just that,
scoring six goals in its
first three contests.
Last season, it took
nine games for the
team to net six goals.
"Last year was a
disappointing sea
son," said head coach

Brett Simon. "We felt that we were ready to move forward ...
but couldn't quite get over the hump."
Stanford was consistently competitive last year despite a 4-
11-3 record, with nine of those losses coming by only a single
goal a school record.
Simon's chief focus, however, is maintaining the quality of
play on the defensive side of the ball. Defense was a strength for
the Cardinal last season, never allowing more than two goals in
a game.
"Defending will make the difference," Simon emphasized.
"The best attacking chances come from defending."
