This past summer, Stanford
claimed its 15th consecu
tive Director's Cup, award
ed annually to the top colle
giate athletics program. Take a look
around campus, though, and you
would never guess it. Stanford stu
dents are not known for their intense
love of sports, but there is no reason
they shouldn't take advantage of
everything this campus has to offer.
