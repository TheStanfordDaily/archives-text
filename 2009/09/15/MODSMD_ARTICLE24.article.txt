# Men's water polo out for revenge
## Cardinal looking for elusive national title 
### MIKE LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
Last year was supposed to be the year.
Everything was set up for the Stanford men's
water polo team to win the national title. All-
American goalkeeper in the cage, a pair of
twin scorers on the outside, and bruising bod
ies in the middle. Best of all, the Cardinal could
hoist the trophy in its home pool, as Stanford
played host for the National Collegiate Cham
pionship.
The storybook ending never happened,
though, as Stanford players had to watch the
USC Trojans celebrate their 7-5 victory.
The Cardinal is not ready to let this happen
again.

"We kind of all choked against USC," said
Janson Wigo 'lO. "This year will be a little dif
ferent. We're all ready."
The key pieces that led Stanford to a final
No. 2 national ranking in 2008 all return this
year to try to avenge the championship loss to
USC.

Senior Jimmie Sandman, the MPSF Co-
Player of the Year, will be the heart and soul of
this year's squad. Known as much for his
mountain-man beard as his electrifying saves,
Sandman simply rejects would-be scorers, av
eraging eight saves and less than five goals al
lowed per game last year.
"Sandman is the last line of defense," said
redshirt freshman driver Travis Noll. "We
know that he's going to knock down so many
shots."

In front of Sandman, three big bodies at the
two-meter defense position will wear down
opponents. Sophomores Peter Sefton and
Ryan Kent and redshirt freshman Andrew
LaForge, all 6-foot-2 or taller, create mis
matches with their sheer size and power.
On the other side of the pool, senior drivers
Janson and Drac Wigo have defenses seeing
double. The set of twins from Florida look to
improve on their team-leading 55 goals from
last season. Providing offensive help will be
Jacob Smith 'l2 and Jeffrey Schwimer 'll, who
had 23 and 18 goals in 2008, respectively.
As a whole, five of the top eight scorers
from last year return.The key exception is sen
ior driver Sage Wright, who netted 39 goals in
2008. Due to a torn ACL injury he suffered
over the summer, Wright will redshirt this sea
son and return in 2010, which will help offset
the loss of firepower when the Wigo twins
graduate.

Stanford, the preseason No. 2, is not think
ing about next year, though.
"We just got to have a strong season all the
way around," Wigo said. "We want to have a
perfect season."
At the Navy Tournament in Annapolis, Md.
in early September, the Cardinal started its
season by outscoring opponents 75-17. In the
season opener, Stanford dismantled Bucknell
22-7, and then battered Johns Hopkins 20-1
later that day. The next day, Stanford cruised to
a perfect 4-0 mark with a 17-2 victory over
George Washington and a 16-7 win against
Navy.

While the four teams the Cardinal faced in

Annapolis almost certainly will not be the
same teams they face in the postseason, Stan
ford still accomplished everything they set out
to do.

"We went there to work on defense and
work out our kinks," Noll said. "And we did
that."

In the season opening tournament, the Car
dinal showed no signs of rust and gelled as a
unit. This is largely due to the fact that it was
n't the players' first time in the pool together
since last season. The returning players went
on a two-week cruise of Croatia over the sum
mer, playing local water polo teams on the
coastal areas.

The one portion of this year's squad that
was not on the trip to Croatia was the incom
ing freshmen. Although 10 freshmen will join
the team, only driver Paul Rudolph and goalie
Scott Platshon seem poised to see action in the
pool. Platshon will spell Sandman in blowouts,
but more importantly, will get to shadow
under the most decorated goalkeeper in the
nation.

And when Platshon does take charge of the
cage next year, the Cardinal is hoping he will
already have a national title under his belt.

last year, losing at home to USC in the championship game. Stanford begins this season ranked No. 2 in the nation.
