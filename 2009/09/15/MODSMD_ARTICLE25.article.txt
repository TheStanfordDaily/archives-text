# CARD'S FRESH LEGS
## 
### CHRIS FITZGERALD 
As last year's stars in the defense de
parted from the Stanford men's
soccer team, it seemed as if head
coach Bret Simon and his Cardinal
would have their backs against the wall in
2009. Graduating seniors included Ryan Ima
mura and Tim Jones, both of whom were
mainstays in the defense. But the Card is
poised to regroup and turn some heads this
season.
After averaging just 0.78 goals per game
last season, the squad has already mustered
six goals in its first three regular season
matches. Now in his eighth season as Stan
ford's head coach, Bret Simon acknowledges
the challenge ahead.
"Sometimes it takes a while to turn a ship
around," Simon noted. "It's a year-long
process; we've been working hard. It's the
first time in 30 years that I've seen everyone
pass the fitness test."
Cue the comeback? Soccer America ranks
Stanford's recruiting class as the fourth best

in the nation. Adam Jahn highlights the
group. His attacking acumen is backed up by
a resume boasting Gatorade State Player of
the Year honors in California. Classmate
Dersu Abolfathi helps out in the attack. Top
drawersoccer.com signifies Abolfathi as the
top-ranked recruit in the nation in 2008. Im
proved attacking and endurance will aid the
Card, but Simon knows where the games will
be won or lost this season.
"It all comes down to team defense. We
spent a lot of time in winter practice to get
better," Simon said. "[Junior] Bobby War
shaw is a good anchor, and having [senior] T.J.
Novak back will really help."
A pair of freshmen backs up senior John
Moore in the net. Jason Dodson and Galen
Perkins add depth behind Moore, whom
Simon believes might contend for Player of
the Year honors in the Pac-10.
Perkins noted that Moore teaches by ex
ample. "John's work ethic is outstanding. He's
a powerful guy and he puts out amazing in
tensity."
Freshman Hunter Gorskie joins Jahn in
the defense as an everyday starter. Abolfathi
also notched a start early in the season, estab

lishing the depth of Stanford's new crew.
The signs of improvement are visible.
After going 4-11-1 in 2008, including a 1-5-2
road record, the Card knocked off Rutgers 2-
0 in New Jersey during the preseason. Stan
ford peppered Cal Poly with nine shots on the
frame in their first regular season contests,
with a 3-2 win that improves upon the Cardi
nal's 4.7 shots-on-goal per match from last
season.

All signs point to a renaissance for a Stan
ford squad that finished with a winning
record two years ago, and enjoyed a lengthy
stretch in which it contended for the national
title at the beginning of the decade.
The freshmen will need to adopt a large
role if Stanford wants to rebound this season,
but Simon recognizes the team's potential.
"The freshmen coming in are really talent
ed," he said.
As the newest group of Cardinal players
shore up their passing and on-field communi
cation, they smooth out other staples of col
lege life.
"When I got on campus, we jumped right
into it, but the veterans keep us in check and
have helped us transition," Perkins said.

The strengths of last year's squad remain
intact, while the team appears to have shorn
up any loose ends from the previous cam
paign through three matches this season. Un
questionably, the freshmen play a dynamic
role in Stanford's progression.
Simon acknowledged the impact that se
lective recruiting has on Stanford's ability to
become a well-rounded club.
"We're at a strong position now," he said.
"Having a big team, having a lot more offen
sive talent than we've had in a long time, our
recruiting is changing. We can recruit for for
mation and position."
The addition of Gorskie in defense with
Abolfathi and Jahn up top has propelled
Stanford to a 2-1-0 start. Combining young
talent with depth across the field, Simon has
redirected the Cardinal from the doldrums of
last year, putting forth a team that should
contend in the top half of the conference
standings.
