# Women's soccer filled with young talent

### CHRIS FITZGERALD 
In an effort to improve upon its second-place finish
last season, the Cardinal (7-0-0) welcomes 10
freshmen to the squad this fall. Within the talented
group, seven individuals have experience in inter
national competition, six have been rated by Top Draw
er Soccer and one is the reigning Gatorade National
Player of the Year.
And with the large bunch of decorated freshmen
comes a boost in offensive productivity, cementing No.
3 Stanford's spot in the national title hunt. The Cardinal
recorded six goals in its first preseason opener from
Honolulu, Hawaii the most the team has notched
since 2007. Stanford scored a combined 13 goals in the
four games following the opener.
Freshman Courtney Verloo established herself as a
mainstay on the under-19 United States National Team
while in high school. Verloo backed up the resume, scor
ing the first goal for the recruiting class in Stanford's

preseason opener. The Tualatin, Ore., native notched a
pair of assists as well against the University of Hawaii,
making a strong case for a consistent starting job.
Cardinal head coach Paul Ratcliffe is optimistic
about Verloo's presence in the starting lineup. "Court
ney has good pace, good skill, and gets better with every
game," he said.

Stanford pushes a frenetic pace of play that rarely
calms over the 90-minute span of a match.
Verloo recognizes how much the freshmen must
adapt to fit into Ratcliffe's established offensive
scheme.

"The coaches are great about telling us how best to
adapt to separate styles of play," Verloo said. "The soc
cer is different from anything I've experienced."
Stanford's up-tempo style has been revamped with
the addition of freshmen Rachel Quon and Alina Gar
ciamendez in the defense. The two young players must
now fill the big shoes of Marissa Abegg 'O9 and Alison
Falk 'O9. Abegg, however, stays on board this season as
a volunteer assistant coach, facilitating a smooth transi
tion in the back.

Quon, the National Gatorade High School Player of
the Year in 2009, highlights the recruiting class. Garcia
mendez has spent considerable time with the Mexican
national team, and scored two goals as a forward in
World Cup Qualifying. A native of Fairview, Texas, Gar
ciamendez earned 2009 Gatorade State Player of the
Year honors before graduating from high school.

Ratcliffe pointed out the team's potential. "It's a re
ally talented back four, and I think they're going to get
better and better as the season goes on," he said.
"Freshmen just have to adjust to the speed of play and
intensity of play. It takes a little bit of time,"
Opponents' scoring numbers continue to drop
against the Cardinal as the season progresses, yet the
offense's pace continues. The Cardinal notched a 2-1
win over Cal Poly in the preseason, and although they
scored only two goals, Stanford peppered its opponent
with a school-record 40 shots.
Junior Christen Press and senior Kelley O'Hara
headline the attack, but immediate help can be found in
a couple of freshmen. Verloo will push toward the 18-
yard box with regularity. The Oregonian boasts 11 shots
to date, while still holding firm at the midfield when the
Card needs it. Classmate Mariah Noguera also possess
es the capability to change gears from the midfield.
Noguera assisted three goals in the first four matches,
playing all over the field to stifle opponents.

Within the talented group, seven individ
uals have experience in international
competition, six have been rated by Top
Drawer Soccer and one is the reigning
Gatorade National Player of the Year.
Freshmen, including Noguera,
Verloo and Quon, will battle for the
few starter slots not taken up by the
nine returning, everyday players.
Whether the Cardinal establishes a
rigid starting lineup as the season
moves on, or continues to rotate
players into the few unsettled posi
tions, the team is undeniably one of
the deepest in the country.
And despite their resumes, the
freshmen are still 'the new kids.'
Verloo reflected with a smile on
her last month in camp. "The culmi
nation of preseason stuff is such an
eye-opener," she elaborated. "Being
here is like playing professional soc
cer because we're not in school yet.
It's an awesome experience, and it's
helped us gel as a team."
Currently sitting at 7-0, having
knocked off two teams ranked na
tionally in the top-10, Stanford is
poised for a run at the title. The Car
dinal topped 2009 national champi
ons Notre Dame in a rematch of last
year's final, manifesting that the sky
is the limit for this young yet savvy
squad.
