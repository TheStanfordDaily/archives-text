# Support Cardinal Football

New Student Orientation ... a
time quite unlike any other.
Fresh faces abound, tenuous
friendships (and even relationships)
are formed, and many Stanford
freshmen jump straight into activi
ties they will participate in for the
rest of their careers on the Farm.
In the midst of everything else
going on, though, this senior can't
help but exhort the freshmen to
make the most of something they
may take for granted. So, I say this:
appreciate your football team.
When I was a freshman, things
didn't go so well. We're talking one
win, 11 losses.

However, these days, things are
looking up for the Cardinal. Sure,
the team gave up 21 unanswered
points in a tough loss at Wake Forest
this past weekend, but coach Jim
Harbaugh still has an adequate shot
of getting Stanford to its first bowl
game in eight years. Redshirt fresh
man Andrew Luck has lived up to
the expectations so far after taking
over for Tavita Pritchard, with near
ly a 60 percent completion rate and
three touchdowns to one intercep
tion on the year so far.
He's looked poised in the pocket
and shown the ability to run for the
first when necessary. Overall, it's
pretty clear so far that Luck is the
kind of talent whose name might be
remembered for years after he has
left the Farm, and not just because it
sounds cool.

As for his backfield counterpart
Toby Gerhart? If you're not familiar
with the bruising senior tailback,
then you may want to take a crash
course before Saturday's home
game against the Spartans. Gerhart
set the Stanford rushing record for
yards last season and may be one of
the toughest men to bring down in
all of college football. He is nothing
short of a workhorse, and is fronted
by a more than capable offensive
line.

The defense still has its soft spots,
but all in all, Harbaugh is in posses
sion of probably the best Cardinal
team in years. In his third season, a
bowl game is essentially a must, es
pecially for a coach who was recent
ly granted a $50,000 private bath
room in the locker room by the
eponymous John Arrillaga. It's a
very reasonable possibility, and it
will probably be determined these
next three weekends.
NSO and the first two weeks of
school will be accompanied by a
Stanford home game each week; and
each one is winnable, Stanford beat
both San Jose State and Washington
last year, and was a goal-line stand
away from earning a victory against
the Bruins in Los Angeles last Octo
ber. Three wins in the next three
games would give the team a 4-1
record, only two wins shy of the six
needed to go bowling.

While this isn't the most crucial
stretch of the season, it's the most
crucial in determining whether or
not Stanford will be playing an extra
game in the month of December this
year. But it would be more than just
an extra game, as I put it getting
to a bowl game would mark a full
180-degree turn from a team that
was one of the worst in college foot
ball just a few years ago. With some

Don't forget your

thing actually on the line already
this season, it would be simply irre
sponsible (or whatever word you
prefer) to not cheer on the Cardinal
to the best of your abilities.
So, I guess this is what I have to
say to the incoming freshmen, who
will still be navigating their way
through NSO programming and
getting situated with their new lives
on campus: Don't forget your foot
ball team. Show up to the games,
have a good time, but most of all,
support your team. The Class of
2010 went through great pains so
that later classes would have oppor
tunities like the ones available to
you now.
Coach Flarbaugh and his staff
have been building toward a better
future and it just might be here
today.
