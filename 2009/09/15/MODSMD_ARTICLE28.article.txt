# Men's cross country ready for title run in '09
## 
### JULIA BROWNELL STAFF WRITER 
After a podium finish last year,
the Stanford cross-country men
begin their season as a young team
with high expectations.
Last year, Stanford finished
third at the NCAA championships,
thanks largely to runner Chris
Derrick's outstanding freshman
year. Though Derrick finished sev
enth in the nation at the meet,
coach Jason Dunn expects nothing
but improvement out of his best
runner.
"I absolutely see Chris getting
better," Dunn said. "He's got a
good head on his shoulders and
he's in really good shape now for
where we are at the season. He's
only going to get better."
While Stanford is fortunate to
have Derrick returning, the team
enters the season without a single
senior on the roster. Redshirt

sophomore Jacob Riley is confi
dent, however, that those returning
know their stuff and will lead the
team well this year.
Riley and junior Elliot Heath
will add postseason experience to
the young team, and each had
promising performances in track
last spring.
Despite the relative lack of ex
perienced runners, a strong re
cruiting class of true freshmen will
bolster Stanford this year. Though
still unsure of how they will con
tribute, Dunn said that after a
week at Mammoth Lakes training
camp the group shows promise.
"There's a lot of potential in
that group. I don't know yet if any
will contribute but I could see a po
tential for one or two to join the
traveling team," Dunn said.
Riley added praise of the new
recruits. "It seems like they're run
ning faster than previous classes ..
. Some will definitely be able to

contribute," he said.
So far, things are going well for
them indeed. This year's team
opened the season with a sweep at
the Twilight Invitational in Reno,
Nev., on Sept. 4, with standout per
formances from both new and re
turning runners.
In general, the runners and
coaching staff have high hopes for
the team. The field this year re
mains highly competitive. Riley
cited defending champions Ore
gon and a dangerous Oklahoma
State as likely challenges.
If all goes well, though, Cardinal
fans can expect a strong team and a
good year.
"We're going for the win," Riley
said. "If all goes well, we'll come
back with at least a trophy, and
hopefully it's the one with number
one on top."

Sophomore Chris Derrick should be a national contender and a leader for the Stanford cross country team. The
Cardinal men finished third in the nation last year, and this year they hope to win their first NCAA title since 2003.
