## Women hope youth serves 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Coming off an eighth-place fin
ish at nationals in 2008, the Stanford
women's cross country team had an
incredible finish despite an over
abundance of youth.
"We've got a young team and
we're definitely looking to improve
on our eighth-place finish at nation
als from last year," said senior Kate
Niehaus.
Once again hitting the season
with a young team, the Cardinal will
look for a stronger finish, as well as
several accomplishments on an indi
vidual level.
The women will be led by the tal
ent of sophomore Laurynne Chete
lat, who was First Team All-Region
with her ninth place finish at the
NCAA West Regional. Top veter
ans will be Niehaus, junior Alex
Gits, sophomores Emilie Amaro
and Georgia Griffin, and redshirt
sophomores Stephanie Marcy and
Maddie Duhon.
While Niehaus was a member of
the 2006 and 2007 national champi
onship teams, Gits was only able to
run in then 2007 national champi
onship, as she was injured the entire
next season.
"I battled injury all last year,"
Gits said. "I don't believe many peo
ple expect me to be a presence. I

hope to prove them terrible wrong."
Returning after two weeks of
training camp in Mammoth Lakes,
Calif., the women feel ready to face
the first and only home meet of the
year on Sept. 26.
"It's always great to have sup
port from our peers as we compete
on our home turf," Duhon said.
"Come with running gear and run
around the course to watch as we
compete."
A small contingent of Stanford
women competed at the first meet
of the season, the Nevada Jim Van
den Twilight Invitational in Sparks,
Nev. the weekend of Sept. 5. The
women placed second in the meet,
close behind UC-Riverside. The
Cardinal was led by Duhon, who
placed fourth in the 4,000 meters
with a time of 15:40. In fifth was red
shirt freshman Emma Miller-Be
dell, who was competing in her first
ever cross country meet for the Car
dinal.
Equipped with top runners from
last year, and the new talent of fresh
man who have won national high
school titles and competed in inter
national competition, the Stanford
women have deep talent and will
look to make a statement at the na
tional level.
