One of Stanford's own will soon be lead

Yukio Hatoyama M.5.'72, Ph. D.'76 is due
to be installed as Japan's prime minister on
Sept. 16.The 62-year-old president of the De
mocratic Party of Japan (DJP) won 308 of
the 480 seats in the powerful lower house of
parliament in the Aug. 30 elections, ending
decades of rule by the Liberal Democrat
Party (LDP).
"The nation is very angry with the ruling
party, and we are grateful for their deep sup

port," Hatoyama said to international media
after the polls closed. "We will not be arro
gant, and we will listen to the people."
Daniel Sneider, associate director for re
search at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center (APARC), viewed the elec
tion as monumental for Japanese politics, de
scribing it as a "quiet revolution."
"When you have one party essentially in
power, except for very brief periods of time,
for more than 50 years, losing power
that's not just a shift in power, it's much more
than that," Sneider said. "It really marks a
moment of political transformation for
Japan."
Daniel Okimoto, director-emeritus of
Shorenstein APARC, also felt that the Aug.
30 election was a landmark event in Japanese
politics. He explained that it was too early to
tell whether the old structure of power
based on the triad of the LDP, a large cluster

of vested interest groups, and the bureaucra
cy — will be radically transformed, but he
said the election was a step in the evolution
of Japan's democracy.
"The Democratic Party of Japan's land
slide victory opens a new era in Japanese
democracy, one in which there will be greater
political competition, more transparency,
clearer focus on policy and greater account
ability," he said. "The August earthquake has
certainly shaken the old structure,"
However, Phillip Lipscy, a fellow at the
Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies, cautioned that it is still too early to
be hailing a political revolution.
"In large measure, a vote for the DPJ was
a vote against the LDP and its longstanding
policies," Lipscy said. "There is still consider
able skepticism about the DPJ's ability to

govern. If Japan is to become a true
two-party system, the DPJ must estab
lish its credibility by demonstrating
that it is capable of effectively manag
ing the government."
The DJP Victory
According to Sneider, the seismic
shift of the August elections —the
transition from the LDP's prolonged
rule was a long time in the making.
In the 1980s, he watched the decay
of the LDP's support in Japan, but
there were no credible alternatives for
voters to turn to. The socialist party,
the main opposition group at the time,
was not seen as a promising governing
party, and the brief period of opposi
tion rule in 1993 was a fractious and
unstable coalition that collapsed
quickly.
"The Democratic Party was

formed in the mid-19905, and it's taken
a long time for Japanese voters to see
them as a credible alternative," he
said. "Japanese voters have been un
happy for a long time; it just took them
a while to get to a place where they
could express it in this form."
However, Okimoto felt that the
LDP's ouster was a direct result of the
Japanese voters' dissatisfaction with
the stagnation of Japan's once robust
economy, second in the world only to
that of the U.S.
"The global financial implosion of
2008 has had a devastating impact," he
said. "Japan's economy is on track to
contract by perhaps four or five per
cent in 2009. Unemployment has risen
to 5.7 percent, the highest level since
1953. Core prices have fallen by 2.2
percent, signaling that Japan has
slipped back into the powerful grip of
deflation."
While Japan's recent contraction
stems from a global financial crisis, its
specialization in high-value-added
products and exports have been hit
hard.
"The DPJ has sharply criticized the

LDP's spending initiatives as waste
ful," Lipscy said. "In the longer-term,
some of the DPJ's policies are de
signed to arrest or moderate Japan's
economic stagnation.

"The DPJ will also attempt to exert
greater control over the bureaucracy,
which some blame as the source for
government waste and mismanage
ment," Lipscy added.
Indeed, Hatoyama has publicly
emphasized limiting the influence of
Japan's deeply entrenched national
bureaucracy, which often dictates the
policies of the country to a great de
gree.

What is clear, however, is that the
election was a portent of a move to
ward greater political competition in a
multiparty system.
"Now voters know that they can
vote in, and vote out, the party in
power," Sneider said. "They aren't
forced to simply feel that they have no
other option than to vote for one
party."
He added that as a result of elec
tion, more than 150 new members of
parliament were elected, out of a 480-

seat parliament.
"[These are] people who have
never been in politics before," Sneider
said. "There was an influx of new gen
eration politicians. They're younger,
some of them come from outside the
traditional routes of political power in
Japan, and many are women."
U.S.-Japan Relationship
As for what the shift of power por
tends for U.S.-Japan relations, profes
sors were generally optimistic that the
traditional military alliance between
the two countries would be main
tained.
"That alliance has a raison d'etre
that is really quite enduring, both for
Japanese and Americans," Sneider
said.

He explained that for Americans,
the alliance has been a great success,
particularly from a military point of
view. Japan is the home base for the
western arm of the Navy's Pacific fleet
as well as a major U.S. air force base.
For the Japanese, the U.S. alliance has
provided their security umbrella,
under which they were able to rise as

an economic power.
"It's an anchor for our security
presence in East Asia," he said. "But
it's also more than that. We have a
deep and profound relationship with
Japan, economically and culturally. I
don't see that changing."
He did, however, note that the DPJ
is much more committed to improving
Japan's relationship with their Asian
neighbors than the LDP. Sneider ex
plained that this commitment may re
sult in a more balanced Japanese for
eign policy.
"There is a desire for Japan to be a
little more independent, [to an extent]
that has changed its foreign policy," he
said. "But frankly, I think the habits of
dependency aren't good for either the
U.S. or Japan."
Stanford Ties
Another Stanford alumnus will
also be at the center of the U.S.-Japan
ese relationship.The new U.S. Ambas
sador to Japan, John Roos '77, J.D. 'BO,
has already met Hatoyama. Among
other important matters, the two dis
cussed a Stanford football helmet Ha

toyama had as a memento.
Sneider also felt that Roos was a
good choice as a U.S. ambassador to
Japan. Roos hails from Silicon Valley
and is interested in working on issues
of the environment, climate change
and technology.
"These are areas where we have a
lot in common with Japan and we can
play a shared leadership role," he said.
"I think he has a real genuine interest
in broadening the way we think about
the relationship with Japan."
Even if the focus on Japanese for
eign policy moves away from the U.S.,
Hatoyama will always have a bond
with Stanford and California. After
all, Hatoyama met and married his
wife, Miyuki, during his doctoral stud
ies at Stanford. TTie two married at
Memorial Chapel.
"It's not surprising, therefore, that
Stanford holds a special place in their
hearts," Okimoto said.

sors were generally optimistic that the
traditional military alliance between
the two countries would be main
tained.
"That alliance has a raison d'etre
that is really quite enduring, both for
Japanese and Americans," Sneider
said.

He explained that for Americans,
the alliance has been a great success,
particularly from a military point of
view. Japan is the home base for the
western arm of the Navy's Pacific fleet
as well as a major U.S. air force base.
For the Japanese, the U.S. alliance has
provided their security umbrella,
under which they were able to rise as

an economic power.
"It's an anchor for our security
presence in East Asia," he said. "But
it's also more than that. We have a
deep and profound relationship with
Japan, economically and culturally. I
don't see that changing."
He did, however, note that the DPJ
is much more committed to improving
Japan's relationship with their Asian
neighbors than the LDP. Sneider ex
plained that this commitment may re
sult in a more balanced Japanese for
eign policy.
"There is a desire for Japan to be a
little more independent, [to an extent]
that has changed its foreign policy," he
said. "But frankly, I think the habits of
dependency aren't good for either the
U.S. or Japan."
Stanford Ties
Another Stanford alumnus will
also be at the center of the U.S.-Japan
ese relationship.The new U.S. Ambas
sador to Japan, John Roos '77, J.D. 'BO,
has already met Hatoyama. Among
other important matters, the two dis

Sneider also felt that Roos was a
good choice as a U.S. ambassador to
Japan. Roos hails from Silicon Valley
and is interested in working on issues
of the environment, climate change
and technology.
"These are areas where we have a
lot in common with Japan and we can
play a shared leadership role," he said.
"I think he has a real genuine interest
in broadening the way we think about
the relationship with Japan."
Even if the focus on Japanese for
eign policy moves away from the U.S.,
Hatoyama will always have a bond
with Stanford and California. After
all, Hatoyama met and married his
wife, Miyuki, during his doctoral stud

One of Stanford's own will soon be lead
ing Japan.
Yukio Hatoyama M.5.'72, Ph. D.'76 is due
to be installed as Japan's prime minister on
Sept. 16.The 62-year-old president of the De
mocratic Party of Japan (DJP) won 308 of
the 480 seats in the powerful lower house of
parliament in the Aug. 30 elections, ending
decades of rule by the Liberal Democrat
Party (LDP).
"The nation is very angry with the ruling
party, and we are grateful for their deep sup

port," Hatoyama said to international media
after the polls closed. "We will not be arro
gant, and we will listen to the people."
Daniel Sneider, associate director for re
search at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center (APARC), viewed the elec
tion as monumental for Japanese politics, de
scribing it as a "quiet revolution."
"When you have one party essentially in
power, except for very brief periods of time,
for more than 50 years, losing power
that's not just a shift in power, it's much more
than that," Sneider said. "It really marks a
moment of political transformation for
Japan."
Daniel Okimoto, director-emeritus of
Shorenstein APARC, also felt that the Aug.
30 election was a landmark event in Japanese
politics. He explained that it was too early to
tell whether the old structure of power
based on the triad of the LDP, a large cluster

of vested interest groups, and the bureaucra
cy — will be radically transformed, but he
said the election was a step in the evolution
of Japan's democracy.
"The Democratic Party of Japan's land
slide victory opens a new era in Japanese
democracy, one in which there will be greater
political competition, more transparency,
clearer focus on policy and greater account
ability," he said. "The August earthquake has
certainly shaken the old structure,"
However, Phillip Lipscy, a fellow at the
Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies, cautioned that it is still too early to
be hailing a political revolution.
"In large measure, a vote for the DPJ was
a vote against the LDP and its longstanding
policies," Lipscy said. "There is still consider
able skepticism about the DPJ's ability to

govern. If Japan is to become a true
two-party system, the DPJ must estab
lish its credibility by demonstrating
that it is capable of effectively manag
ing the government."
The DJP Victory
According to Sneider, the seismic
shift of the August elections —the
transition from the LDP's prolonged
rule was a long time in the making.
In the 1980s, he watched the decay
of the LDP's support in Japan, but
there were no credible alternatives for
voters to turn to. The socialist party,
the main opposition group at the time,
was not seen as a promising governing
party, and the brief period of opposi
tion rule in 1993 was a fractious and
unstable coalition that collapsed
quickly.
"The Democratic Party was

formed in the mid-19905, and it's taken
a long time for Japanese voters to see
them as a credible alternative," he
said. "Japanese voters have been un
happy for a long time; it just took them
a while to get to a place where they
could express it in this form."
However, Okimoto felt that the
LDP's ouster was a direct result of the
Japanese voters' dissatisfaction with
the stagnation of Japan's once robust
economy, second in the world only to
that of the U.S.
"The global financial implosion of
2008 has had a devastating impact," he
said. "Japan's economy is on track to
contract by perhaps four or five per
cent in 2009. Unemployment has risen
to 5.7 percent, the highest level since
1953. Core prices have fallen by 2.2
percent, signaling that Japan has
slipped back into the powerful grip of
deflation."
While Japan's recent contraction
stems from a global financial crisis, its
specialization in high-value-added
products and exports have been hit
hard.
"The DPJ has sharply criticized the

LDP's spending initiatives as waste
ful," Lipscy said. "In the longer-term,
some of the DPJ's policies are de
signed to arrest or moderate Japan's
economic stagnation.

"The DPJ will also attempt to exert
greater control over the bureaucracy,
which some blame as the source for
government waste and mismanage
ment," Lipscy added.
Indeed, Hatoyama has publicly
emphasized limiting the influence of
Japan's deeply entrenched national
bureaucracy, which often dictates the
policies of the country to a great de
gree.

What is clear, however, is that the
election was a portent of a move to
ward greater political competition in a
multiparty system.
"Now voters know that they can
vote in, and vote out, the party in
power," Sneider said. "They aren't
forced to simply feel that they have no
other option than to vote for one
party."
He added that as a result of elec
tion, more than 150 new members of
parliament were elected, out of a 480-

seat parliament.
"[These are] people who have
never been in politics before," Sneider
said. "There was an influx of new gen
eration politicians. They're younger,
some of them come from outside the
traditional routes of political power in
Japan, and many are women."

tends for U.S.-Japan relations, profes
sors were generally optimistic that the
traditional military alliance between
the two countries would be main
