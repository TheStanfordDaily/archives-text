One of Stanford's own will soon be lead
ing Japan.
Yukio Hatoyama M.5.'72, Ph. D.'76 is due
to be installed as Japan's prime minister on
Sept. 16.The 62-year-old president of the De
mocratic Party of Japan (DJP) won 308 of
the 480 seats in the powerful lower house of
parliament in the Aug. 30 elections, ending
decades of rule by the Liberal Democrat
Party (LDP).
"The nation is very angry with the ruling
party, and we are grateful for their deep sup

port," Hatoyama said to international media
after the polls closed. "We will not be arro
gant, and we will listen to the people."
Daniel Sneider, associate director for re
search at the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center (APARC), viewed the elec
tion as monumental for Japanese politics, de
scribing it as a "quiet revolution."
"When you have one party essentially in
power, except for very brief periods of time,
for more than 50 years, losing power
that's not just a shift in power, it's much more
than that," Sneider said. "It really marks a
moment of political transformation for
Japan."
Daniel Okimoto, director-emeritus of
Shorenstein APARC, also felt that the Aug.
30 election was a landmark event in Japanese
politics. He explained that it was too early to
tell whether the old structure of power
based on the triad of the LDP, a large cluster

of vested interest groups, and the bureaucra
cy â€” will be radically transformed, but he
said the election was a step in the evolution
of Japan's democracy.
"The Democratic Party of Japan's land
slide victory opens a new era in Japanese
democracy, one in which there will be greater
political competition, more transparency,
clearer focus on policy and greater account
ability," he said. "The August earthquake has
certainly shaken the old structure,"
However, Phillip Lipscy, a fellow at the
Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies, cautioned that it is still too early to
be hailing a political revolution.
"In large measure, a vote for the DPJ was
a vote against the LDP and its longstanding
policies," Lipscy said. "There is still consider
able skepticism about the DPJ's ability to
