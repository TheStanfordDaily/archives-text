# It's "All Right Now" for Stanford sports
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
Welcome back to Stanford
sports. For those of you
who haven't been glued
to ESPN or online sports Web sites
for the past few months, who
haven't already scoped out bowl
games or hysterically yelled "Clip
ping? ! Are you kidding me?!," who
haven't started designing shirts to
celebrate our 16th Director's Cup
or decided which Stanford teams
will continue our streak of nation
al championships, here's a little
preview of what 2009-10 will bring
to Cardinal athletics.
First off, let's start big picture.
Last year, Stanford won the Direc
tor's Cup, which is given annually
to the school with the best overall
athletics program in the nation. If
you don't know what the Direc
tor's Cup is, you can always look on
Wikipedia or the official Web site;
or you could always just look at
Stanford's trophy case, because the
Cardinal has won the Director's
Cup each of the last 15 years, which
is even more impressive because
the award has only been around
for 16 years (we were second to
North Carolina the first year). This
year, we beat the second-place
school in the country, North Car
olina again, by 270.75 points. To put
that in perspective, 270.75 points
was roughly the difference be
tween second and 16th.

Along with these Director's
Cups, Stanford won the national
championship in both men's gym
nastics and women's rowing last
year. These titles extended Stan
ford's streak of consecutive years
with a national championship to
33, which is easily a collegiate
record. In short, every year since
the Ford administration has fea
tured a Cardinal national champi
onship. Overall, Stanford has 97
NCAA team titles, so this year
could conceivably be the year
when we break 100 (only UCLA
has done so).
So, you ask, what teams could
help the streak continue?
We start, as discussions of ath
letic programs so often do, with
women's teams. 0.K., so maybe
lots of people start with football,
but here at Stanford, we have the
best women's sports teams in the
country (see: 38 NCAA team titles,
the most in the nation) and we're
proud of it. And unlike some
schools (cough, USC) we spread
our success across many sports
without scandals and bribery.
Last year, our women's rowing
team won the national champi
onship. Women's volleyball placed
second in the nation and is expect
ed to contend for another trip to
the Final Four this year. Speaking
of Final Fours, women's basket
ball, water polo and soccer all
reached the Final Four of their re

spective sports, and each team is
only expected to improve, with
many up-and-coming young play
ers on each team. The Cardinal
women also cracked the top 10 in
swimming (fourth), cross country
(eighth), gymnastics (eighth), soft
ball (ninth) and tennis (ninth), as
well as ninth-place in coed fencing,
for an astounding 11 top-10 finish
es.
Now, on the men's side of the
ball or gym, pool or track the
Cardinal was equally impressive.
Gymnastics won the national
championship, and water polo
placed second. Cross country and
swimming got third, followed by
track and field (seventh) and ten
nis (ninth).
Along with the various national
title contenders, 2008-09 brought
Stanford several improving teams
who look to be ready for breakout
seasons. The football team showed
signs of life in 2008, narrowly los
ing a few games in the final minute
that would have propelled the Car
dinal to a bowl game. Still, the core
of the team returns for this season,
and Stanford is in search of its first
bowl appearance since 2001. The
Cardinal came excruciatingly close
to starting the year off 2-0, blowing
a two-touchdown lead in the sec
ond half against Wake Forest and
losing after a potential winning
drive was cut short by what sports
writers are politely dubbing a
"phantom clipping call." However,
Stanford still seems ready to make
its name heard in the Pac-10, and
its first home game is this Saturday
against San Jose State,
Men's basketball had to re
group from major losses to the
NBA and played in the College
Basketball Invitational. Still, mak
ing the postseason at all is an ac
complishment for a team that lost
14 feet of big men to the NBA lot
tery. Baseball had a similar difficul
ty regrouping at the beginning of
last year, but the team showed life
in the second half of the year, and
returning most of its main contrib
utors from last year gives Stanford
a great shot at getting back to the
NCAA tournament.
Other teams, such as men's vol
leyball, men's soccer and men's
and women's tennis, just to name a
few, return many young starters
and seem ready to contend for na
tional titles this season.
All around, it's a great time to
be a Stanford fan. So, get ready to
jump, because I have a feeling
we're going to be hearing "All
Right Now" a lot this year.
Go Card.
