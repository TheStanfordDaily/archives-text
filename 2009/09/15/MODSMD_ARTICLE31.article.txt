FOX THEATRE
If you're looking for something sleek, hop
across the bay to the chic Fox Theatre in
downtown Oakland. Reopened in February
after a 43-year hiatus, the Fox has become the
flagship for Another Planet Entertainment,
the music company that puts on the annual
Outside Lands and Treasure Island Music
Festivals.

The decision to reopen the landmark
comes in a time of revitalization for the Oak
land downtown, and Another Planet had sig
naled its intent for the 2,800-person venue to
become the hub of East Bay music. Appar
ently, $75 million in renovations goes a long
way into turning a rundown movie theatre
into a premier concert venue.

The theatre itself is a throwback to an ex
travagant '2os movie theatre, complete with a
giant red curtain, gold trim facades and ceil
ings covered in Victorian murals. Of course,
there are the modern amenities found with
two massive hanging speakers providing the
audio firepower to please even the pickiest
music aficionado.

Since its opening, the Fox has hosted a
who's who of indie and rock bands, among
them Sonic Youth, The Shins, Bloc Party and
The Decemberists ... and that's within the
last six months. For the fall season, the Fox
has already booked the Arctic Monkeys, Ben
Harper and the Relentless7, as well as Regi
na Spektor. Of course, with such investment
comes great expectations, and the Fox has
done everything in its power to become a
music mainstay in the Bay Area.
GREEK THEATRE
Venturing into enemy territory has its
risks. But just bear (pun, not error) in mind

that you're doing it for the music.
Berkeley's Greek Theatre is really the
heart of the beast, home to Cal's graduation
ceremonies and a certain Big Game bonfire.
Inconsequential functions aside, the Greek
Theatre provides just about as intimate a set
ting as an outdoor venue can be.
Secluded from the surrounding campus,
the century-old amphitheatre is nestled in
the Berkeley foothills. Because of its deli
cious location, the stone sanctuary has had
little trouble attracting big name artists, with
the likes of Death Cab for Cutie and Andrew
Bird filling the cavernous venue over the
summer. It also helps when Another Planet is
pulling the strings, the music mogul further
proving its muscle in Bay Area entertain
ment.

The Greek Theatre has something for
everyone, with a spacious pit area for the pas
sionate music fan to the stone steps and grass
area where you can stretch your legs and
enjoy audio bliss. Those who arrive early
enough for a show can royally take in the ex
perience seated in the handful of thrones that
line the amphitheatre's pit.
While the music experience within an out
door venue is subject to the elements, the
Greek Theatre has done it's best to minimize
distractions and focus solely on the music.
Yet once in a while a distraction or two is wel
come, with a setting sun behind the theatre
providing a stunning golden backdrop fit for
any musical experience.
So, go ahead, wander over to the Greek
Theatre and enjoy. See what it's like on the
other side.

THE WARFIELD
One of San Francisco's oldest and longest

running concert venues, the Warfield fea
tures as good of a musical experience the city
has to offer. The theatre, with a capacity of
about 2,000 people, is the favorite venue for
bands that enjoy the Warfield's renowned
sound system and its airy floor space.
Getting there is simple enough, heading
north on the CalTrain to San Francisco and
then walking a few blocks to the city's shady
Tenderloin District. But as long as you don't
hang around after a show for too long, you
should be fine.

The venue opened in the '2os and was
originally designed as a vaudeville theatre,
slowly transitioning to a movie palace with
the rise of the silver screen. The Warfield has
stayed true to the era, maintaining scarlet
and gold walls to a massive balcony and or
nate chandeliers.

By the '7os, however, the venue was
turned into a premier music venue with
artists including The Clash and Bob Dylan
providing some memorable performances.
The Grateful Dead would come to call the

Warfield home in the 'Bos, playing night after
night to cement their place in the venue's his
tory.
Today, the Warfield stays true to its past,
and bands Phoenix and the Sounds, as well as
pop sensation Sean Kingston, have been
booked for the coming months. With new
renovations, the Warfield is tuned, ready and,
as always, waiting for the next big act to come
through its doors.

THE FILLMORE
The Fillmore is the quintessential San
Francisco music venue, steeped in tradition
and vital to the city's identity. You can see it
in the endless posters that line the auditori
um or taste it when you take a bite out of the
free apples they hand out before every show.
Since the '6os, the Fillmore has been sym
bolic of almost anything and everything that
is hip about the city. True to the vision of leg
endary rock promoter Bill Graham, the
venue not only promises the biggest names
in music, but also an experience. Graham

himself was known for handing out the fresh
apples as well as providing concertgoers
with free handbill posters customs that
are still continued today.
In its heyday, the venue was the home of
free love and counterculture, graced by the
likes of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and
Pink Floyd. While the Fillmore has been
moved twice in 1968 to a location named
Fillmore East, and back again in 1994 it
hasn't lost any of its original charm. The Fill
more remains the most intimate of promi
nent Bay Area venues with a capacity for
just over 1,000 guests. Concerts regularly
sell out, with artists usually booking for
more than one appearance to appease de
mand.
Promising shows already scheduled for
the fall include Mutemath and Matisyahu
in October, and Dinosaur Jr. in early No
vember.
