# Exercise and You: A Tragedy in Eight Parts

Sometime soon, you may come to a
very powerful realization: Stanford
students are fit. You'll decide to start
working out and good for you.
But let's say you really don't want to
go to the gym.
While Arrillaga works for some people,
others just don't have that sort of time in
their schedule or don't want to be outdoors
or one of a zillion other bogus reasons. Fair
enough. Stanford offers plenty of ways to get
in shape:

1. Set your alarm 10 minutes late. You'll have
to bike faster to reach your class on time,
thus burning more calories. Plus, sleep is

important. Simple as that.
2. Go to parties. While drinking might not be
the healthiest thing for you, dancing and
sex are both fantastic cardio workouts.
Also, don't think of the walk of shame as a
chore; think of it as a brisk morning stroll.
This way, exercise fits around your sched
ule, even if you don't always remember
doing it.
3. Visit friends on other floors. The constant
climbing up and down the stairs really does
add up. If you don't have friends, go to ran
dom doors and introduce yourself This actu
ally works more often than not. If that does-

Exercising while at school is absolutely essential. Follow our quick tips to keeping yourself
in shape, even when you can't find time or prefer not to go to the Arrillaga Fitness Center.
n't work, you might just be a lost
cause, in which case you probably
don't have to worry too much about
working out anyway. 50... hooray?
4. Run around Lake Lag. This is al
ways a popular activity. However,
go during the day because at
night, only half of it is lit and the
other half is just creepy.
5. Impromptu dance party. It hap
pens more often than you'd think.
I know I already mentioned danc
ing, but that was drunken and

sexy party dancing. This is "I've
been working on a problem
set/computer program for 10
hours and need to do something
to not die" dancing. They use to
tally different muscles, so it's legit.
6. Kegel exercises. (You too, fellas.)
Do them during boring lectures.
7. Get lost. Sure, you might end up
somewhere dark and scary (the
old chemistry building), but you'll
learn the campus and the sur
rounding area, and get a fantastic
run and/or bike ride out of it. I
wouldn't advise this in Palo Alto
proper because of houses, traffic
and all that jazz, but in the middle
of nowhere, go crazy.
8. Find time for the gym (you

lazy bum).
You see, there are plenty of ways
to work out at Stanford, and this
guide hardly even begins to cover all
the options. There's rock climbing,
hiking, racquetball, martial arts,
gymnastics, swimming and pretty
much anything else you can think of.
I personally lost about 15 pounds my
freshman year, and while I'd chal
lenge you to do better, I don't want
anyone blaming me for an eating dis
order. Have fun, stay safe and re
member: walk of shame = brisk
morning stroll.
