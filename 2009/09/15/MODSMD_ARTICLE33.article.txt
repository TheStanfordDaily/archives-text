While most people don't consider the Farm
to be Northern California's fashion
mecca, we do have our own certain sense
of style. Cardinal boys and girls definitely
focus more on academics than couture, but
Intermission wants all of our newest members to have the
411 when it comes to Stanford style. So, we will dish out the
details on three of the most popular looks on campus.
Class Casual
If Stanford were in L. A. or New York City, 'class casual'
would probably mean a lot more cashmere and silk, as op
posed to our denim and cotton. While we all pride our
selves on having nice things, on the whole, we don't flaunt
it like some of our counterparts at other campuses. Our
'class casual' is more like nice jeans and Ugg boots or cute
ballet flats. Often times, ladies can be seen biking to class
adorned with a chic scarf or other accessory that adds flair
to a basic outfit. While biking in skirts can be difficult
and Intermission completely understands that a good
option is a flirty linen that goes with trendy and classic
pieces. Guys will regularly be seen in shorts or jeans with a
screen tee, keeping things laid back and relaxed. Don't
stress out about ties or pullovers. Instead, grab a beach
y hoodie that keeps you warm and looking fine.
Awesomely Athletic
One of the most popular looks on campus is simple for
both men and women to pull off and look fun, spunky and,
best of all, filled with Cardinal pride. Ladies, if you are look
ing to throw something on 10 minutes before class that is
both comfortable and nice to look at, try a pair of jeans or
leggings with Stanford gear accenting the outfit. This style
is almost always appropriate, on top of being simple. Acces
sorize with cute flats or tennis shoes, and throw up a perky
ponytail. For all of the men, show your spirit with a Stan
ford sport-specific T-shirt, providing plenty of conversation
starters. This look is especially handy when heading to the
gym straight after or before class. Go ahead and emulate
Sporty Spice everyone else is doing it.
Late Night Laid Back
We're lucky that at Stanford, going out on weekends
doesn't mean that we have to dress up like we are going to
a debutante ball. On the rare occasion that parties don't
have a costume theme, we keep it casual, though a step
above our regular class garb. Girls look their best in nice
denim or printed dresses, while the guys kick it up a notch
by switching out their daily shorts for a pair of jeans. As ev
idenced by the three most popular looks at Stanford, we
like to keep it cool and casual, whether it's school time or
party time.

Here on the Farm, style is by no means overshadowed by students' academic
endeavors. Stay tuned to Intermission for fashion trends, tips, do-s and don't-s.
