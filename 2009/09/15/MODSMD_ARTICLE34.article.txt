# Extract...Any Hope

RATING: 2/5

Put simply, "Extract" fails to live up to the hype.
Beyond a few sight gags and assorted moments
of situational humor, the movie falls far below
its potential.
Packed with an all-star cast including Mila Kunis
("That '7os Show"), Jason Bateman ("Arrested De
velopment"), Ben Affleck and Gene Simmons, "Ex
tract" should have been a good movie. That Mike
Judge, the creator of "Office Space," wrote and di
rected the film only compounds the sorrow I felt after
watching it. Compared to Bateman's "Arrested De
velopment" or Judge's "Office Space," both of which
are considered classics for the current generation,
"Extract" is a thoroughly forgettable film with a few
memorable scenes and even fewer memorable lines.
While the film will undoubtedly do well in theatres,
Intermission urges you to wait until it is available as a
video rental.
Bateman plays Joel, an affable small business
owner who is waging war against sweatpants, sexual

frustration and maddening neighbors. In defeat, Joel
visits his friend Dean, an owner of a local sports bar,
who reminds him that "stress is a killer." Judge's in
terpretation of the working man's struggle against
the system is exposed here, unlike "Office Space,"
where the paradigm at play places individual con
cerns over the systemic problems of working life.

One of the real standouts of the film is David
Koechner, whose portrayal of nettling neighbor
Nathan is spot-on. We all know folks who ramble in
cessantly 'conversation divers' who seem to suck
the air right out of you as the conversation progresses.

The same cannot be said for Kunis' Cyndi. A nefar
ious actor throughout the film, her presence and con
stant scurrilous behavior hurts the film's believability.

Those seeking a revival of "Arrested Develop
ment" or "Office Space" will be sorely disappointed
by "Extract," which excessively uses bawdy, low-brow
humor and sight-gags in place of upbeat and witty
comedic spirit.

"Extract" features a slew of TV's comedy giants. But on the silver screen, the film fails to live up to the hype.
