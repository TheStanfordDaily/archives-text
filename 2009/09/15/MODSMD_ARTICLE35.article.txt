# Delicious Food Outside of Dining Halls

Class of 2013: Welcome. At this point, you
are probably preparing for the excitement
and chaos of moving in, adjusting to dorm
life and choosing your first classes.
One thing you shouldn't have to get used to, how
ever, is eating in the dining halls night after night.
Don't get me wrong; I have tasted food from other
colleges, and Stanford is quite good in comparison.
However, when you're ready for a break from your
routine, there are plenty of great places to eat that are
easily accessible, even if you don't have access to a
car.
Stanford's free shuttle system, the Marguerite, will
send you to a variety of restaurants in just a few min
utes. Take the Marguerite to the corner of El Camino
and California, and you will find The Counter, a
trendy 'build your own burger' joint. For a fun group
outing, I would also recommend P.F. Chang's, a popu
lar Chinese food chain restaurant, in the Stanford
Shopping Center. Don't forget to sample their deli
cious chicken lettuce wraps appetizer.
And if you're in the mood for something sweeter,
the Shopping Center is also home to Sprinkles Cup
cakes, where, for $3.25 each, you can sink your teeth

into the favorite cupcake of Courtney Cox, Tyra
Banks and Katie Holmes. (My guilty pleasure is the
banana with chocolate frosting.) Also, a less expensive
treat to satisfy your sweet tooth is Hobee's blueberry
coffee cake. Located in the Town & Country Village at
the edge of campus, Hobee's is easily within biking
distance.
If you follow the palm trees to University Avenue
on your bike, you'll find a bevy of interesting restau
rants. Sushi Tomo is a reasonably priced and well
liked place for Stanford students to escape campus
and get their sushi fix. If you're tired of pasta made en
masse, check out Bella Luna. With rich fettuccini al
fredo and nice ambiance, it's the perfect place to take
your parents when they're visiting. Bucca di Beppo is
another excellent Italian eatery with family-style din
ing and crazy decor.
So, whether you're celebrating a completed IHUM
essay or birthday, or just looking to escape the dining
hall with your friends or family, be sure to check out
these off-campus favorites. You can certainly expect
to run into another student doing the same.
