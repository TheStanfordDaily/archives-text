"Disclaimer: Dining hall food at Stanford is generally good.
Intermission provides this article for humor and creative

We all know that feeling: It's lunch hour, and
after a long, meandering journey to the
dining hall, we're greeted by the welcom
ing sight of vaguely overcooked pasta,
drooping by a tub of radioactive sauce.
The chicken slithers sadly over the pan, drowning in its
own grease, and even a knife plunged into its breast yields
a texture reminiscent of death. We fork a slice, chewing on
the dry, fibrous bits of the once-bird.
"This is the life of a college student. This is the life of a
college student," we repeat to ourselves like a mantra. Oc
casionally, we believe in optimism.
I've let this happen quite a bit during my years at Stan
ford, losing, at the same time, quite a bit of happiness, not
to mention my trim, sprightly figure of the past. It was fi
nally over this summer that I realized: Life was better
without the grilled patty that tasted more like grill than
patty. There was a fine line between being an annoying

food snob and valuing my own well-being, and I hadn't
quite crossed it yet. So, as I stared dismally at my millionth
plate of dining hall food, I decided to do something with
my stretch of empty summer: to put these sad dining hall
finds together and to make something a little more appe
tizing.
1. Pasta in olive oil sauce with chicken, mushrooms and
tomato
1 bowl cooked pasta
1/2 cup cooked chicken breast, skin removed and cut into
shreds
1/2 cup mushrooms (salad bar)
1 handful tomatoes (salad bar)
Enough olive oil to coat the pasta (condiments shelf)
Salt to taste
Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a saucepan, and heat on
medium until the oil is hot.
