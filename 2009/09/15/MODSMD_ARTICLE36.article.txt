"Disclaimer: Dining hall food at Stanford is generally good.
Intermission provides this article for humor and creative
recipes.
We all know that feeling: It's lunch hour, and
after a long, meandering journey to the
dining hall, we're greeted by the welcom
ing sight of vaguely overcooked pasta,
drooping by a tub of radioactive sauce.
The chicken slithers sadly over the pan, drowning in its
own grease, and even a knife plunged into its breast yields
a texture reminiscent of death. We fork a slice, chewing on
the dry, fibrous bits of the once-bird.
"This is the life of a college student. This is the life of a
college student," we repeat to ourselves like a mantra. Oc
casionally, we believe in optimism.
I've let this happen quite a bit during my years at Stan
ford, losing, at the same time, quite a bit of happiness, not
to mention my trim, sprightly figure of the past. It was fi
nally over this summer that I realized: Life was better
without the grilled patty that tasted more like grill than
patty. There was a fine line between being an annoying

food snob and valuing my own well-being, and I hadn't
quite crossed it yet. So, as I stared dismally at my millionth
plate of dining hall food, I decided to do something with
my stretch of empty summer: to put these sad dining hall
finds together and to make something a little more appe
tizing.
1. Pasta in olive oil sauce with chicken, mushrooms and
tomato
1 bowl cooked pasta
1/2 cup cooked chicken breast, skin removed and cut into
shreds
1/2 cup mushrooms (salad bar)
1 handful tomatoes (salad bar)
Enough olive oil to coat the pasta (condiments shelf)
Salt to taste
Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a saucepan, and heat on
medium until the oil is hot.
Add the mushrooms, and saute until
juices begin to release.
As the mushrooms cook, crush some
tomatoes between your fingers. Add
the crushed fruit and resultant juice to
the pan, stirring with a spatula.
Stir in the pasta, adding enough olive
oil to coat the noodles lightly.
Mix in the chicken breast, then add
salt to taste.

Toss to ensure an even distribution of
salt. Serve hot.
2. Simple stir fry
1 handful red onions (salad bar)
1 cup peppers (salad bar)
1 cup mushrooms (salad bar)
1 cup carrots (salad bar)
Soy sauce (condiments shelf)
Olive oil
Rice
Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pan.
Stir in onions, coating evenly in the oil,
frying until slightly fragrant.

Add the peppers and carrots, both cut
into bite-sized pieces.
Just before they turn tender, add in the
mushrooms, sauteing until slightly
golden.
Add soy sauce to taste. Serve hot with
rice,
3. Ice cream dessert mix
1 cup vanilla froyo (froyo machine)
1 handful walnuts/sunflower seeds
(salad bar)
1 spoonful chocolate chips (by the
froyo machine)
Honey (condiments shelf)
Layer the nuts, chips and froyo.
Cover with honey. The froyo often
hardens the honey into caramel-like
strips, which makes for quite a good
variety in texture.
4. Parfait
2 cups vanilla yogurt (salad bar)
1 cup granola (cereal dispenser)
Seasonal fruit (salad bar)
In a glass cup, layer 1 cup yogurt, 1/2
cup granola and fruit.
Repeat layers.
*Strawberries are particularly excel
lent to layer with, although they're
rare in dining halls. Sometimes I use
peeled orange slices and ripe bananas
too.
5. Balsamic strawberries
16 oz. fresh strawberries, hulled and
cut in half (salad bar)
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar (condiments
shelf)
1/4 cup white sugar (from sugar pack
ets)
Pepper to taste
Place strawberries in a bowl.
Drizzle vinegar over the berries and
sprinkle with sugar.
Stir gently, then cover and let set at
room temperature for about 90 min
utes.
Pepper just before serving.
