# Roxy's "firsts": A Guide
## 
### 
Dear Stanford Class of 2013,
The following piece is the product of studious
study and calculated calculations. These do-s and
don't-s are not solely from personal experiences, but
from many of my classmates and my classmates' class
mates. Take this advice with a handful of salt, a lime
wedge and a shot of tequila. Welcome to the Farm. I
hope you like to bike.
The First Week:
Don't worry about going to every single Welcome
Week activity. Attend the ones that sound interest
ing. If you think John Bravman's lecture on higher
learning will make you want to vomit, don't go. It's
that simple.
Don't have sex with the entire contents of your
dorm. We know it's tempting, but this first week is not
a Nike commercial. Don't "just do it." You'll be sore
the next day.
Keep your door open don't worry about the
draft. An open door is inviting, and that's what you
should be going for.
Don't overload on the buffet-style dining. Pace
yourself. It'll be there all year, I promise ... so does
the dining staff.
Change your profile picture. Give the kids from
home something to talk about.
Call your mother. Lie and reassure her that you're

wearing your helmet.
First Quarter:
If you want to be noticed at a frat, bring a friend who
is less visually pleasing than you. Take them every
where. Make sure they are unaware of their purpose.
Grades are important, but no matter what, you're
going to get a B+ in IHUM.
If you want to kiss the Tree at Full Moon on the
Quad, be the first.
First Year:
The walk of shame happens. Move quickly and
avoid highly populated areas.
Lock your (registered) bike to a stationary object.
Stay in touch with your good friends from high
school. You have to go home eventually.
Work out. To quote the ugly truth, "Nobody falls in
love with your personality at first sight."
Change your profile picture. The kids from home
won't care now, but your Facebook stalker will.
Buy into what everyone else has been telling you
since the day you got the big envelope: You're going to
be just fine.
Welcome!
xoxo,
Roxy
