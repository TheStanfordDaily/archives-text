# Green Day: Still American Idiots, After All These Years

It's 9:01 p.m. in Phoenix's U.S. Airway Arena, and
Green Day is about to come on but not before an
other "star" takes the stage. After some brief confu
sion, a drunken man in a giant pink bunny costume is
soon leading the anxious crowd in a sloppy rendition
of the YMCA after chugging a pair of beers. If there were
any concerns that Green Day had lost their raucous, ob
scene ways, this pre-show "entertainment" certainly puts
them to rest. Then, after the bunny hobbles offstage, the
lights extinguish, and a roar swells through the stadium.
The speakers blared the a cappella, minute-long prel
ude from Green Day's new CD, "21st Century Break
down," before the crashing chords of the title track an
nounced the band's arrival.They raced out and the crowd
exploded, the floor in a riot as everyone shoved to reach
the band. Billie Joe Armstrong seized the microphone
and jumped right into the song. Armstrong: the ultimate
frontman.

For three hours, he constantly interacted with the
crowd singing, playing guitar, going into the stands,
throwing toilet paper, shooting out T-shirts and generally
tapping into a seemingly endless supply of energy and
charisma. In the opening song alone, he had the crowd
echo back the vocals to him, clap to his beat and wave
their arms in unison, all while racing back and forth
across the stage, shouting for the fans in the outer seats to
"get on your f —king feet! This isn't a f —king computer
screen!"

A song later, he leaned heavily on audience participa
tion, calling up fans to do stage dives, spray the crowd
with enormous water guns and sing parts of "Longview."
In one memorable instance, Armstrong pulled a 7-year
old girl up to "be saved." He laid his hand on her head
during their new song "East Jesus Nowhere" and, on cue,
she collapsed, apparently "saved" by his magic touch.

The intention was to make the concert different than
listening to a distorted version of their albums, and, for
the most part, they succeeded. Green Day effectively
took their two-and-a-half-minute pop-punk songs and
transformed them into eight-minute epics, making the

performance an experience that simply couldn't be repli
cated at home. To them, that seemed to be the entire pur
pose of the concert. Every band can play songs live, but
only a few can put on a show. Green Day stands proudly
near the top, probably mooning the competition.
Speaking of mooning and general dissidence, while
old-school fans may complain about the grand ambitions
of their politically-charged new albums, this doesn't af
fect their stage presence in the slightest. They are clearly
the same smarmy punks who sang about poo and mastur
bation on their breakout album, "Dookie." This gave the
concert an incredible unifying factor, as they weaved be
tween songs from their new album and classics from 15
years ago.

Probably the best example of this blend came toward
the end of their set, when they played an outrageous song
called "King for a Day," about a transsexual that could
easily be seen as their ode to the "Rocky Horror Picture
Show." They played complete with costumes and feather
boas with the drummer, Tre Cool, wearing a hat that
wouldn't look out of place in "My Fair Lady." Halfway
through, they dropped into a show-stopping cover of the
Isley Brothers' "Shout." And following this medley, they
launched straight into their new single, "21 Guns," a dark,
somber anti-war anthem. Amazingly, inexplicably, it
flowed.

After returning for a full-band encore, Armstrong
alone remained onstage to play an acoustic encore of
"Last Night on Earth" and "Good Riddance."Then, with
a simple wave and the dimming of the lights, he walked
offstage almost three hours after the drunken bunny took
its bow.

All in all, it was an experience no other band can repli
cate. Even after selling over 50 million CDs, Green Day
still plays like they're in the dingy clubs of their youth,
clearly adoring every minute of their work. For the fans,
that makes all the difference in the world.
