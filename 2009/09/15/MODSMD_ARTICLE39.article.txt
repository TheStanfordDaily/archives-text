RATING: 3/10
There are two awesome things
about "Whiteout."
1: Kate Beckinsale.
2: Antarctica.
Unfortunately, Kate Beckinsale
spends most of the movie bundled up
in a none-too-flattering parka.There is
a fantastically titillating shower scene,
but it's in the first 15 minutes. This
leaves just the continent to hold down
the aesthetics for the remainder of the
film, and other than aesthetics, this
movie doesn't really have much to run
on.
It's a high-concept thriller that
doesn't move fast enough or far
enough to let giddy excitement over
ride disbelief. It's a movie that some
how manages to be boring, nonsensi
cal and stupid at the same time.
The plot starts with a predictable
prologue that takes place in 1957.
There's a Russian cargo plane and a
box that is very, very important. The
plane crashes and all of the Russians
die don't worry if you miss this
part, it shows up again later. In fact, I'd
say 15 to 20 percent of the movie is
made up of flashbacks to scenes that
literally just happened.
Anyway, we jump to 2009, where

Beckinsale is working as a U.S. deputy
marshal in an American research
camp. Somehow, all of the research
camps in this movie work like frat
houses there are streakers, a band
and people constantly getting wasted.
There's some science, too, but that's
boring, and Kate Beckinsale is about
to take a shower.
Don't worry if you're not an expert
on the world's coldest continent, since
there's some lovely exposition at this
point. We learn that Antarctica is real
ly, really cold, about to become com
pletely dark for six months and brew
ing one hell of a storm. To make mat
ters worse, when there's a storm in the
winter, you can get what's called a
"whitcout." Basically, it's nature's best
strategy for utterly destroying any
foolhardy creature who dares to set
foot near the South Pole.
Soon Beckinsale and her father
figure/friend are out investigating this
really cool-looking frozen corpse in
the middle of nowhere. They bring
him back to camp and determine he
was murdered. Moments later, some
one from the dead guy's camp calls.
For some inane reason, he refuses to
give Beckinsale any information over
the phone and insists that she fly over
to his camp. She grabs a pilot, gets
there and, surprise, he's dead. She's at
tacked by a killer with an ice axe and
barely escapes. Some chiseled U.N.

dude shows up. There are some flash
backs to when Beckinsale was a cop in
Miami. We learn a little bit more about
what the hell is going on. It goes on like
this until we come to a tremendously
unsatisfying twist followed by a brief
epilogue, and call it a day.
I will say that there are some pretty
sweet high-concept moments, and
they are all based on the fact that
Antarctica is straight-up badass. It's
got these winds that will throw you
wherever they want, snow that de
stroys visibility and huge plains of ab
solute nothing. Add the fact that
frozen corpses look awesome, and
you've got ample potential for some
delicious exploitation. However, be
warned: There are about eight blurry
penises in the first 10 minutes, so if for
some bizarre reason you go see it, re
member that you were, in fact,
warned.
It's too bad this particular Antarc
tica story was so poorly executed. Ul
timately it's a movie made by and for
people who never really cared for "in
telligence" in their entertainment. It's
sometimes interesting, sometimes irri
tating and consistently forgettable.
There are simply better movies that
deserve your time and money more
than this one.
