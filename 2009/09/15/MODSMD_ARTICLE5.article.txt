## Housing fills remaining vacancies

Draw last May, Housing has now fully as
signed all of its open spots in residences to
students with guaranteed status, with Syn

Until last week, Synergy had several
vacancies, even while students were still
waiting to be placed in residences from
the wait list.The co-op was finally filled on
the first round of housing walk-in meet

ings, held on Sept. 9, alleviating concerns

the Draw in May as well as past several
walk-in assignment rounds during the
summer.

walk-in meeting with students requesting
to be there," said Executive Director of
Student Housing Rodger Whitney in an
email to The Daily. "We normally try to fill

guaranteed housing in other on-campus locations.
