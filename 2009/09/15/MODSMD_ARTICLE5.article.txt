# STUDENT HOUSING
## Housing fills remaining vacancies 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
After overhauling many aspects of the
Draw last May, Housing has now fully as
signed all of its open spots in residences to
students with guaranteed status, with Syn
ergy the last residence filled.
Until last week, Synergy had several
vacancies, even while students were still
waiting to be placed in residences from
the wait list.The co-op was finally filled on
the first round of housing walk-in meet

ings, held on Sept. 9, alleviating concerns
that Synergy would remain under residen
tial capacity at the beginning of the quar
ter. Synergy had remained unfilled after
the Draw in May as well as past several
walk-in assignment rounds during the
summer.
Initially, 89 unassigned-but-guaran
teed students were left waiting for housing
assignments at the beginning of the sum
mer. Any who marked the "live in any co
op" choice on their housing applications
were potential residents for Synergy off

the waiting list, without necessarily having
applied for pre-assignment.
Students who entered the house had
either opted for pre-assignment or were
unassigned with guaranteed housing sta
tus.
"Synergy was filled at our first daily
walk-in meeting with students requesting
to be there," said Executive Director of
Student Housing Rodger Whitney in an
email to The Daily. "We normally try to fill

co-ops with students who request to
live in them rather than requiring stu
dents to move into these houses. This
is because of the time commitment
required to live in a co-op. We have
had this same situation with other co
ops in the past, but have always filled
them before the quarter began."
With Synergy now filled, all of Stu
dent Housing has been assigned, ac
cording to Whitney. He said he ex
pected any remaining guaranteed,
un-housed students would be placed
into a residence by the start of the
quarter.
Housing attributed Synergy's ini
tially open spots to potential confu
sion with the pre-assignment process
within the new three-tiered Draw sys
tem.
Now that students have been
placed in the co-op without its neces
sarily being a top choice, some worry
about the dynamic in the house.

Tommy Mina 'll was assigned
from the wait list during the summer
to live in Synergy, but opted to cancel
his assignment in hopes of living
somewhere else.

"I'm not a vegan or vegetarian,
and I just don't think it would be a
good environment for me," Mina
said. "My roommate last year had a
few friends that lived there and said
that they had a hard time doing their
work there."
Former resident Chris Skieller 'lO
said in an email to The Daily that stu
dents shouldn't worry about the rep
utation of Synergy as long as they're
willing to participate in co-op duties.
"You never have to be part of any
of the things Synergy is notorious
for," Skieller said. "The great thing
about most 'Synners' is that their
open-mindedness extends to people
choosing not to partake in something.
The thing about Synergy is that you
can really make what you want of it."
But fears of tension don't go un
founded, as this wasn't the first time
Synergy faced unfilled spots. Accord
ing to both Skieller and the history
section of Synergy's Web site, stu

dents placed in the house to fill vacan
cies in the past didn't necessarily want
to live there and were often disrup
tive in the Synergy community.
"In the overarching history of the
house, there's always crises," said
Anya Lamb 'lO, a third-year resident.
"These things kind of come and go,
and in recent years there's been a
moderate level of challenge with
some people getting in without it
being their first choice."
Lamb attributed this problem to
the size of draw groups, confusion
about pre-assignment and the ten
dency of most students to live in Syn
ergy for two but not three years
usually sophomore and junior years.
Lamb said losing a large group of res
idents every few years means the
house is filled with new students who
have different feelings toward Syner
gy-
"People don't realize that every
house each year is different," she said.
"And each year, they can set the tone
for the year."
