# FACULTY & STAFF
## Faculty use more water than students Staff and professor usage trumps county average

Pop quiz: Who uses more potable water,
per person, at home Stanford students in
dorms, faculty and staff living on campus, or
the average Santa Clara County resident?
New University data say it is faculty, who
use an estimated 25 percent more domestic
water per capita than the average local resi
dent, and more than four times as much as the
average student.
The data are tracked largely by staff in the
University's Department of Sustainability and
Energy Management, who have spent at least
$2 million since 2001 encouraging faculty and
students to conserve water and use high-effi
ciency appliances at home.
The department's 2008 numbers, their most
recent, illustrate the contrast: Of the 2.3 mil
lion gallons of potable water Stanford used
every day last year, about 22 percent was used
by an estimated 2,441 faculty and staff mem
bers and their families living on campus
about 215 gallons per person per day. An esti
mated 11,500 undergraduate and graduate
students accounted for about 25 percent of the
water used, or some 50 gallons per day per stu
dent.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey,
the average Santa Clara County resident used
about 172 gallons, both indoor and outdoor,
per day last year.
Margaret Laporte, the sustainability de
partment's associate director of utilities for
water resources, is quick to note that the facul
ty figure represents both indoor and outdoor
use, including water that goes to gardens and
swimming pools, for example. The student fig
ure mostly represents indoor use. Another
"quite substantial" amount of lake water,
which is not potable, goes to irrigate 150 acres
around Escondido Village as well as outdoor
areas around Toyon, Branner and Mirrielees,
she said.
Yet despite millions poured into campus
conservation efforts, an ongoing statewide
drought and pressure from the agency that
sells water to Stanford, resource and housing
officials here cannot say for sure why faculty
still use more domestic water than their local
counterparts.
"I don't have enough insights into all the
faculty and staff ins and outs," Laporte said. "1
do know in our lots, well, the gardens are beau
tiful ... people take pride in their landscapes
and keep them very lush."
"Some [faculty homes] have been here for
40 years," Laporte continued. "None of us
were thinking about water efficiency."
Pressure to Conserve
These days, however, the University is
under water pressure.
It began with the San Francisco Public Util
ities Commission (SFPUC), which sells drink
ing water to Stanford, Laporte said. Years ago,
Stanford contracted with SFPUC to receive
