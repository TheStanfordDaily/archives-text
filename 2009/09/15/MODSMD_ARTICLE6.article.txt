# FACULTY & STAFF
## Faculty use more water than students Staff and professor usage trumps county average 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
Pop quiz: Who uses more potable water,
per person, at home Stanford students in
dorms, faculty and staff living on campus, or
the average Santa Clara County resident?
New University data say it is faculty, who
use an estimated 25 percent more domestic
water per capita than the average local resi
dent, and more than four times as much as the
average student.
The data are tracked largely by staff in the
University's Department of Sustainability and
Energy Management, who have spent at least
$2 million since 2001 encouraging faculty and
students to conserve water and use high-effi
ciency appliances at home.
The department's 2008 numbers, their most
recent, illustrate the contrast: Of the 2.3 mil
lion gallons of potable water Stanford used
every day last year, about 22 percent was used
by an estimated 2,441 faculty and staff mem
bers and their families living on campus
about 215 gallons per person per day. An esti
mated 11,500 undergraduate and graduate
students accounted for about 25 percent of the
water used, or some 50 gallons per day per stu
dent.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey,
the average Santa Clara County resident used
about 172 gallons, both indoor and outdoor,
per day last year.
Margaret Laporte, the sustainability de
partment's associate director of utilities for
water resources, is quick to note that the facul
ty figure represents both indoor and outdoor
use, including water that goes to gardens and
swimming pools, for example. The student fig
ure mostly represents indoor use. Another
"quite substantial" amount of lake water,
which is not potable, goes to irrigate 150 acres
around Escondido Village as well as outdoor
areas around Toyon, Branner and Mirrielees,
she said.
Yet despite millions poured into campus
conservation efforts, an ongoing statewide
drought and pressure from the agency that
sells water to Stanford, resource and housing
officials here cannot say for sure why faculty
still use more domestic water than their local
counterparts.
"I don't have enough insights into all the
faculty and staff ins and outs," Laporte said. "1
do know in our lots, well, the gardens are beau
tiful ... people take pride in their landscapes
and keep them very lush."
"Some [faculty homes] have been here for
40 years," Laporte continued. "None of us
were thinking about water efficiency."
Pressure to Conserve
These days, however, the University is
under water pressure.
It began with the San Francisco Public Util
ities Commission (SFPUC), which sells drink
ing water to Stanford, Laporte said. Years ago,
Stanford contracted with SFPUC to receive
about three million gallons per day,
anticipating the school would even
tually need that much.
In 2000, the county-issued Gener
al Use Permit, which governs how
Stanford may develop its land, stipu
lated that the University not exceed
the original three million-gallon allo
cation. SFPUC has chimed in, too,
saying that none of its purchasing
agencies, including Stanford, could
have more water until at least 2018.

In response, Laporte said, the
University developed a water con
servation "master plan" in 2000 in
hopes of " [reducing] our water use as
much as possible so that we can
stretch our water supply," she said.
Shortly afterward, conservation
money was budgeted some $5
million total, of which the water util
ities staff has spent about $2 million
to date, Laporte said. Another
$500,000 has gone to water conserva

tion projects in Student Housing, ac
cording to Executive Director
Rodger Whitney.
Today, much of that faculty
money pays for free "water-wise"
house calls for faculty and staff living
on campus, as well as recycling old
toilets, giving away high-efficiency
showerheads and aerators, and help
ing homeowners replace their lawn
with less water-intensive landscap
ing.

Stanford's efforts come in the
wake of a state-wide water crisis,
with Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger officially declaring
a drought in June 2008 after more
than two years of below-average
rainfall. Nearby East Bay Municipal
Utility District had also imposed
mandatory water rationing the
month before the declaration.
The Community Reacts
Officials' opinions vary as to how
effective Stanford's water conserva
tion efforts have been among faculty
and staff.

"What I can say anecdotally, peo

ple very much welcome this, they
are very serious about saving

water," said Lowell Price, executive

director of Stanford Campus Res-

idential Leaseholders, which rep-

resents faculty and staff living

on campus.
According to Laporte, 73
old toilets have been re
placed with high-efficiency
appliances in the faculty

neighborhoods since October

last year, as well as 25

washing machines.

Twenty-nine
low-flow shower-

heads, operating

at two gallons per

minute, have been

given away, and 14
homeowners have
planned for a total
of 34,430 square

feet of lawn replacement, she said.
About 875 living units some sin
gle-family, some condos or single
rooms make up the faculty and
staff housing, according to Price.
Nancy Fischbein and her husband,
Michael Kaplan, both medical school

professors, are among those who re
placed their front- and backyard turf,

swapping it last winter with drought-

resistant plants native to California.

But their motivation, Fischbein

said, wasn't money.

"We thought it was sort of

interesting," Fischbein said.
"We have solar panels on the

house. We wanted to do the
right thing ... it wasn't a

money-saving thing."
She added that the project

didn't come without snags: Her

yard's new plants re-

quire intensive wa
i tering to get estab
lished, she said.
"In fact, it cost us

a lot of money to get

the whole thing put
in," she said. "It's
still getting estab-

lished ... we have lots of dead plants."
"We do eventually hope it will be
come independent as it is supposed to,
but, you know, we like it," Fischbein
continued. "Our kids don't like it be
cause they wanted lawn ... but we
live on campus. There are places to go

with lawns and fields and various
things."
Regarding University-sponsored
rebates, she said, "I don't know that
we're aware of any or eligible for any."
Other community groups, like Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford
(SSS), have been active in conserva
tion efforts targeting students, but sel
dom dive into their professors' at
home water habits.
"Most of our efforts have been Stu
dent Housing-based, and Student
Housing has been very supportive,"
said Noel Crisostomo 'lO, an SSS co
ordinator for student groups, faculty
and alumni outreach. "Our group has
n't really delved into the faculty side
yet."

In the Pipeline
The University's water conserva
tion efforts are, by all accounts, cer
tain to continue. Freshmen arriving
on campus this week will be greeted
almost exclusively by low-flow
showerheads, while Laporte said
conservation funding for faculty
housing is safe despite budget down

turns.
"I think the University recog
nizes that this is really important, so
I have not been requested to reduce
those funds," she said.

But as to why faculty and staff
still use more domestic water per
person than the average Santa Clara
County resident, Laporte and Price
could only speculate.
The two again cited a gardening
tradition in the faculty neighbor
hoods as a possible reason, along
with large lot sizes.
Still, Stanford has managed to re
duce its daily water use by 400,000 gal
lons since 2001, Laporte said, and more
water-saving measures are on tap.
And as for faculty homeowners, it
seems the water conservation ethos
may be slowly trickling down.
"Yes, I think it's a good thing to
do," Fischbein said. She added: "It
does take some getting used to."
