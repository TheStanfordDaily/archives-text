## Renovated Crothers reopens Residence will house 376 students after $22 million in improvements 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
East Campus is now home to a newly remodeled
Crothers Hall that will house 376 undergraduate
residents. The dorm's nine-month renovation, part
of the Student Housing Capital Improvement Pro
ject, carried a price tag of $22 million.
Fast Thursday, Crothers' first residents began to
settle into its numerous singles and doubles. Accord
ing to Rodger Whitney, executive director of Stu
dent Housing, a few minor improvements have yet
to be completed. The remaining residents will arrive
Sept. 17.
"Some of the final activities taking place over the
next few days are the installation of the final pieces
of furniture and artwork, some minor touch-up
painting and a thorough cleaning to get out the con
struction dust," Whitney said in an email to The
Daily.
Commenting on the hall's new look, project man
ager Matt Griffis said, "I'm so proud of the project.
My biggest regret is that the average student who is
moving in today has no idea what it was like eight
months ago."
"It was previously two bunker-style dorms divid
ed by a law school building," Griffis added. "One of
the items that Housing wanted to do early on [was]
to unify the two buildings."
Griffis and his team turned the law building into
the Mark Taper Student Center, which now houses a
front desk, academic offices and student spaces.
"Now that acts as a connective building between
two previously disjointed dorms," Griffis said.
"It's much more cohesive," he added. "It's much
more a community now."
Crothers Hall proved to be a favored residence
during last year's draw. The hall's singles will be oc
cupied by students who drew Tier One, and its dou
bles by students who drew Tier Two.
Whitney said Housing expects the location to in
crease in popularity. "We think Crothers Hall will
become even more popular once students experi
ence the newly renovated facility," he said.
One feature still lacking from the residence is a
dining commons. For the time being, Crothers resi

dents are required to purchase a Stanford Meal
Plan, which allows them to eat at another dining hall
of their choice.

Crothers residents will eventually eat at a two
story dining commons that will also serve Toyon, ac
cording to Executive Director of Stanford Dining
Eric Montell.This dining hall is slated to open in the
fall of 2011.

"The new dining commons is in the final design
stage, and will be located on the Toyon parking lot
adjacent to Crothers and Toyon," Montell said.
Among the dorm's other improvements are larg
er bathrooms and computer clusters, heating and
gutter repairs, a card access system, and a new Resi
dent Fellow (RF) apartment. The dorm also has new
kitchenettes, windows, furniture and finishes.
The most difficult undertaking of the renovation,
said Griffis, was the seismic upgrade, "We had to put
in very long load-bearing soil piers, and those go 50
feet or more into the ground," he elaborated.
While the seismic retrofitting was the biggest
challenge in terms of both cost and time —it
isn't the most apparent change to Crothers Hall.
"One of the most beautiful parts of the renovat
ed Crothers is the huge green lawn between the two
buildings," said Stephen Stedman, who, along with
wife Corinne Thomas, is Crothers' new RF. "It's a
great outdoor space, so we're eager to use that for
barbecues, for concerts, for plays, for whatever sort
of function that you can imagine."
Returning to an RF position after six years, Sted
man also expressed excitement about transforming
Crothers Hall into an academically themed dorm.
"The University plan is that, starting 2010 to
2011, Crothers will become an international studies
themed dorm," said Stedman, a senior fellow at the
Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.
"This year, we'll be coming up with the program
ming for that transition."

As he spoke about the promising future for
Crothers Hall, Stedman emphasized his and his
staffs desire to build education programming as
well as a sense of community within the dorm.
Resident Assistant Roxna Irani 'lO agreed. "As
the first undergraduate RAs of Crothers, we define
how Stanford will perceive this dorm for years. Set
ting that trend for the international theme house
and defining the experience of over 375 residents
makes me thrilled to live here."

Crothers Hall will reopen on East Campus after being closed for renovations. The residence's improvements include a re-thought
design unifying its buildings, new furniture and expanded common areas. But Crothers does not yet have a dining commons.
