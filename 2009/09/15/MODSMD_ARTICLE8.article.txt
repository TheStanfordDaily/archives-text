## Lofting ban put on hold for one year 
### AMY HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
Lofting is back.
Students will be able to raise their
beds for at least one more year, Ex
ecutive Director of Student Housing
Rodger Whitney confirmed in an
email to The Daily. After a partial
ban of bed bunking in nine resi
dences was announced last spring,
Housing has revoked its new lofting
policy until the ban can be applied
across the entire system.

"We've determined that it would
be better to have one consistent pol
icy, regardless of where students live,
so lofting is once again being offered
this year," Whitney said.
According to the Residence
Agreement and Student Housing
Web site last spring, the ban on
bunking was slated to begin this fall
in Branner, Crothers, Florence
Moore, Lagunita Court, Roble,
Stern, Toyon, Wilbur, Mirrielees and
possibly Governor's Corner Sterling
Quad.

These large residences, many of
which house mostly first-year stu
dents, were the targets of an "un
stuffing" strategy aimed at creating
more dorm floor space part of
Phase 1 of the Housing Master Plan.
Housing decided to phase in the un
stuffings with the lofting bans.
"As the space available to each
student becomes more consistent
through the Housing Master Plan,
which we began implementing this

summer, so will the furnishing op
tions," Whitney said. "This is why we
saw the un-crowding of our resi
dences through the Master Plan as
an optimal time to begin removing
lofting from the system as sufficient
space is available to students."
The ban would have prohibited
students from fixing their beds
above the highest rung of the bed
frame at the 'Captain's Height.' That
would mean students could choose
to position their beds at the Cap
tain's Height (about five feet off the
floor), the Ensign's Height (above
the floor at the first set of holes) or
the Stowaway's Height (on the floor,
removed from its posts).

There is no set timetable for
when the lofting ban will be reinstat
ed, but Whitney said that with the
move toward un-crowding many
residences, a loft-free campus makes
the most logistical sense,
"In past years, loft-able furniture
wasn't equally distributed to resi
dences, making lofting a 'first-come,
first-served' option in many places,"
Whitney said. "This is actually one of
the reasons we are moving away
from lofting.
"With the Housing Master Plan,
we are increasing the amount of
space per student available in many
areas and making it possible in each
of those locations to keep all the fur
niture on the floor," he added.
