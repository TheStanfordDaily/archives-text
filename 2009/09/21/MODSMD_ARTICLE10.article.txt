# GIRL, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## How to beat the budget crisis 
### Jordan Carr 
Times are tight, and we here at Stan
ford need to get our financial house in
order. Fortunately, I'm here to break
down how we should be spending our bil
lions of dollars and where we should be
making the tough cuts.
Sell: Wellness Room
Did you know that somewhere in Old
Union, presumably nestled between the air
hockey table and the Axe and Palm, is some
thing called the Wellness Room? I did some
research on the matter and, according its Web
site, the only event it has ever hosted was its
grand opening, where it was christened by
some spoken word poetry. The creation of a
Wellness Room is the kind of thing that gets
done when nobody has a good idea, but
everybody feels that something needs to be
done much like healthcare reform. I
haven't been this flabbergasted by an absurd
idea since a few of my friends adamantly ar
gued that there is a car that runs on water but
the oil companies stopped its production be
cause they're greedy and omnipotent. Be
yond that, the cultish language 20 to 30
Wellness Guides are working closely with
Wellness Coordinators, perhaps on what to
say during their daily meditation in the sanc
tuary is a touch unsettling. We can shut this
one down.

Buy: Senators
It appears that the public option (don't
worry if you don't know what that means;
nobody does) is dead in the great healthcare
debate of 'O9. Its opponents won the argu
ment easily on the merits: the public option
would encroach on private healthcare, kill
the insurance companies, and eventually we
would all be on some government program
getting healthcare at the post office. More
movingly, hard candy donations to grand
children would no longer be tax deductible,
thus robbing scores of elderly of their rea
son for living; although that will make things
simpler for the Death Panels.
Higher education faces the same dilem
ma as healthcare, and the public option is
making it much more difficult for private
universities to make ends meet. Rather than
let those Communists who began public ed
ucation 215 years ago steal our America, it is
essential we find a politician brave enough
to take up our cause. The budget crisis is our
chance to end public (i.e. socialist) educa
tion forever. If we can't trust government to

fix healthcare, something as equally impor
tant as education should also remain in pri
vate hands. Ad hominem arguments like
that are as logical as they come.
Sell: Department of Psychiatry
Who are you going to believe: thousands
of scientists or L. Ron Hubbard and Tom
Cruise? You don't know the history of psy
chiatry like I do!
Buy: Classy Toilets
John Arrillaga has come under some crit
icism for the recent installation of a private
bathroom for Stanford football coach Jim
Harbaugh worth between $50,000 and
$70,000, but that's just outrageous. If Arril
laga wants to make it rain on Stanford, we
shouldn't stop him, even if it's in the form of
golden showers. Yes, the athletic depart
ment is facing a multi-million dollar revenue
shortage over the next few years, and yes,
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby announced
the elimination of 21 staff positions. Yes, sev
eral sports including fencing, women's
lacrosse and men's crew have been subject
to rumors about being cut, but fancy bath
rooms are cool. Have you ever used one of
those self-cleaning toilets? Or used one of
those futuristic machines that dry your
hands using only air? This is the type of cut
ting-edge technology that we need to invest
in if we want to maintain our reputation as
engineering leaders.

Buy: Tibetan Language and Catalan Lan
guage Departments
Stanford could hardly qualify as a top
notch university without them, and if we're
being honest with ourselves, this is where
most of the money comes in. I'm sure we
have all known someone who was room
mates with the rich son or daughter of a Ti
betan monk. And we all know of people who
have leveraged their studies of Catalan into
obscenely lucrative careers as translators
and arbitrageurs in the Andorran sheep
herding trade. While some have (correctly)
argued that these departments are only for
soulless, money-grubbing capitalist pigs,
they are a sound investment for our Univer
sity and the best chance we have to remain
in the financially solvent for years to come.
