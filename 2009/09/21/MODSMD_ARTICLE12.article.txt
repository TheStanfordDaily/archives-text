# THE 						DUDE ABIDES
## Sometimes there's a man (Part Deux) 
### Zack Warma 
ometimes there's a man, who, well, he's
the man for his time'n place, he fits right
in there and that's the Dude. And thus,
duderinoes, begins the cinematic classic,
"The Big Lebowski," which you, if you
haven't already, will come to quickly learn is
the inspiration for these ongoing attempts at
columnizing. I have been back on campus for
only four days, and I am already bitterly nav
igating around all those godforsaken traffic
spots and crappy drivers. But hot damn, does
it feel both rejuvenating and bizarre return
ing to the mighty Stan.
After the total pandemonium (there are
some less kosher phrases I would rather use,
but we'll run with this) that was my spring
quarter, I did what any self-respecting indi
vidual would do I got the hell out of
Dodge and fled for home. For me, this con
sisted of three and a half months of lounging
at the beach in La Jolla, eating cheap Mexi
can food and watching tons of movies. All of
you should see "In the Loop." Bloody bril
liant. And yes, be jealous, I don't mind. Final
ly removing myself from the insanity of the
Farm, I put my life on cruise control. Taking
stock of my little niche of the Stan's universe,
I was able to reflect on the first half of my col
lege years candidly, to realize honest to God
what truly matters for me here, and what I
want the rest of my tour of duty to look like.
After two schizophrenic years, I feel that
for the first time, I do indeed fit right in here.
I have come to fully grasp the total awesome
ness of those SOBs who actually choose to
socialize with me. I am living in a swank Row
House (hell yeah, Haus Mitt!) with a view of
the mountains from my room. I sit 50 (count
em, 50!!!) days away from being able to buy
scotch for myself, and I love the remaining
activities/organizations I am tied to. And I
still get to babble at y'all on a weekly basis.
Huzzah!

So, in these regards I am more than stoked
to be back for the second half of my Stanford
experience, to finally have my turn at the bat

as a disaffected upperclassman, to saunter
over to Kairos' wine and cheese and laugh
with indignation at the naivete of those just
starting their own explorations of the Stan.
After being enwrapped in the shadows of
some truly extraordinary upperclassmen for
the extent of my college career, I am amped
like there is no tomorrow to really take in the
next two years.
However, only after a mere three hours
back, I could not escape the feeling of oddity
that dominates our wee humble university.
Be it the bikers (and the bikers and the bik
ers and goddamned bikers), the 8,000 joggers
at all hours of the day, the 20 friends or ac

quaintances also happening to be moseying
down University Ave. on Thursday night at
7:53 p.m., or the sense of removal from the
boundless enthusiasm of watching a frosh
dorm fountain hop like champs (I think it
was y'all, J-Ro. Nicely done on the Old Union
whirlpool. I was impressed), but the oddity of
Stanford University came rushing back with
a vengeance.
With the arrival of a brand new horde of
masses, the freshness of the paint on
Crothers so it no longer looks like a gulag
(it's actually nice. Holy crap!), Stanford foot
ball being 2-1 (WE'RE GOING A'BOWLIN
THIS YEAR, AND I CANNOT WAIT), and
this bloody heat, it's very easy to just stand in
awe of what appears to be a small slice of
heaven from the railroad-swindling gods.
However, this manicured realm of perfected
lunacy is actually so much more than most of
us ever realize. What I have come to realize is
that the Stan is a far more bizarre, unwieldy,
dynamic and generally twisted place than
what the Admit Weekend brochure will ever
claim. The palm trees and sandstone are cer
tainly a beautiful facade, but what actually
happens behind this rose-tinted imagery is
just so much more interesting.
So, for this coming year, hombres, your
humble duder's mission will be to try to shed
light on the Stanford I know and love and
sometimes want to beat senseless. Instead of
the cardinal-flavored kool-aid literally all of
us have been guilty of both consumption and
production, I'd like to suggest some Two
Buck Chuck from Kairos on a Wednesday
night. Catch ya later on down the road,
dudes. It's gonna be a damn good year. And
remember, USC is literally the devil. Literal
ly. Don't ever forget that.

Even with the disappearance of his cell phone
and keys Saturday night at Sigma Nu, Zack is
pretty damn certain junior year will be a de
light. Care to partake in the insanity? Drop him
a line at zwarma@stanford.edu.

After two schizophrenic
years, I feel that for the
first time, I do indeed fit
right in here ...So, in
these regards I am more
than stoked to be back...
