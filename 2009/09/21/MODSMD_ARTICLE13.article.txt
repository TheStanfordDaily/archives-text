## FIREPOWER AND FIGHT Stanford remains undefeated in tourney 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's soccer team
won its home tournament in dominant
fashion this past weekend, taking down
both Colorado and Wisconsin to win the
Stanford Invitational.This was the team's
last tournament before the NCAA tour
nament, and it certainly was an entertain
ing one, as the Cardinal scored 10 goals
over the two matches.

Stanford started out its weekend
against No. 23 Colorado on Friday
evening. Both teams started the match a
little edgy, and neither squad could get
into a flow early on. Fifteen minutes in,
though, the Card started putting on the
pressure, and surprisingly, it was a de
fender who broke through to score the
first goal.

Senior left back Ali Riley received the
ball in her own half and began a lung
bursting run all the way down the field,
beating multiple Buffalo players before
finally slotting past the opposing keeper,
making opponents and fans alike wonder
why the speedy New Zealander was
switched from forward to back last year.
Scoring continued for the Card just
after the break, when senior forward Kel
ley O'Hara made it 2-nil at 49:47. O'Hara
played a neat one-two with fellow for
ward Christen Press, then shrugged off
two defenders and sent an outside-of
foot shot into the corner of the net.

Stanford put the game firmly out of

reach in the 78th minute, as two of its
backup forwards linked up. Freshman
Courtney Verloo worked her way down
the right flank and sent in a perfect pass
to junior Morgan Redman, who tapped it
in.

Redman doubled her tally two min
utes later, with a considerably tougher
finish. Midfield senior Hillary Heath
floated in a ball from the right side, and
Redman got behind the defense to plant
a strong header past Colorado's keeper.
The goal made it 4-0, and that was how
the match would finish.

The team returned to Cagan Stadium
yesterday afternoon to take on the Wis
consin Badgers. This time, Stanford wast
ed no time in going on the offensive.
Within the first 12 minutes, O'Hara saw
her left-footed effort hit the crossbar,
sophomore Cami Levin had a long shot
tipped over the bar by the Badger goal
keeper, and Wisconsin cleared a danger
ous ball off the line.

It was only a matter of time before the
first goal came, and it finally arrived at the
feet of the dangerous O'Hara. The senior
glided past two defenders on the left be
fore slipping the ball into the box, where
Press tucked it away.

The floodgates were opened, and the
next two goals came courtesy of sopho
more midfielder Teresa Noyola. Twice,
Noyola found herself just outside the box
on the left, and twice her crosses found

teammates for goals first, fresh
man Mariah Nogueira finished in
the 23rd minute, and then Verloo
made it 3-0 in the 32nd.

"Our team has been really anx
ious to get in earlier and alleviate
the stress of being tied at halftime,"
Heath said. "So, it was nice to get the
firepower in early and to make it a
more fun and relaxing game,"
The advantage had essentially
sealed the match for the Card, but
Stanford did not let up. In the 51st
minute, forward Lindsay Taylor
proved nearly back to full form from
her recent virus, as she decked a de
fender in the box. Taylor was tripped
as she went to shoot, which led to a
penalty kick for the Cardinal. Taylor
took the kick herself and, despite
slipping, put it low and into the net
for her first goal of the season.
Two minutes later, O'Hara
slipped a pass through to Press, and
although Press saw her first shot
saved and follow-up blocked, the
ball went right back to O'Hara, who
finally finished to make it 5-nil.
Just a minute later, Stanford com
pleted its rout: Press took a corner
kick and Nogueria rose high to nod it
in for her second goal of the game
and third of the season.The Cardinal
created a number of other chances in
the game's final 35 minutes most
ly with its second-string but was
unable to add to the six-goal lead.
"I think that we really came out
and tried to make a point to the
whole country this weekend," Press
said. "We didn't just want to win 1-0
or 2-0; we wanted to come out and
show that we are a significantly bet
ter team. So, I think this weekend
was great for our team spirit, and
hopefully we'll improve in the rank
ings, but overall it was just a really
fun way to win."
With two wins and 10-goal differ
ential, the Card easily took the Stan
ford Invitational title, with Santa
Clara finishing in second with two
wins and a two-goal differential of its
own. Stanford now rides a large
wave of momentum into its final two
non-conference games, both away,
against Saint Mary's and Santa Clara
on Sept. 27 and Oct. 1, respectively.
