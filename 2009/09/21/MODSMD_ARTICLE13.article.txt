## FIREPOWER AND FIGHT Stanford remains undefeated in tourney 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's soccer team
won its home tournament in dominant
fashion this past weekend, taking down
both Colorado and Wisconsin to win the
Stanford Invitational.This was the team's
last tournament before the NCAA tour
nament, and it certainly was an entertain
ing one, as the Cardinal scored 10 goals
over the two matches.

Stanford started out its weekend
against No. 23 Colorado on Friday
evening. Both teams started the match a
little edgy, and neither squad could get
into a flow early on. Fifteen minutes in,
though, the Card started putting on the
pressure, and surprisingly, it was a de
fender who broke through to score the
first goal.

Senior left back Ali Riley received the
ball in her own half and began a lung
bursting run all the way down the field,
beating multiple Buffalo players before
finally slotting past the opposing keeper,
making opponents and fans alike wonder
why the speedy New Zealander was
switched from forward to back last year.
Scoring continued for the Card just
after the break, when senior forward Kel
ley O'Hara made it 2-nil at 49:47. O'Hara
played a neat one-two with fellow for
ward Christen Press, then shrugged off
two defenders and sent an outside-of
foot shot into the corner of the net.

Stanford put the game firmly out of

reach in the 78th minute, as two of its
backup forwards linked up. Freshman
Courtney Verloo worked her way down
the right flank and sent in a perfect pass
to junior Morgan Redman, who tapped it
in.

Redman doubled her tally two min
utes later, with a considerably tougher
finish. Midfield senior Hillary Heath
floated in a ball from the right side, and
Redman got behind the defense to plant
a strong header past Colorado's keeper.
The goal made it 4-0, and that was how
the match would finish.

The team returned to Cagan Stadium
yesterday afternoon to take on the Wis
consin Badgers. This time, Stanford wast
ed no time in going on the offensive.
Within the first 12 minutes, O'Hara saw
her left-footed effort hit the crossbar,
sophomore Cami Levin had a long shot
tipped over the bar by the Badger goal
keeper, and Wisconsin cleared a danger
ous ball off the line.

It was only a matter of time before the
first goal came, and it finally arrived at the
feet of the dangerous O'Hara. The senior
glided past two defenders on the left be
fore slipping the ball into the box, where
Press tucked it away.

The floodgates were opened, and the
next two goals came courtesy of sopho
more midfielder Teresa Noyola. Twice,
Noyola found herself just outside the box
on the left, and twice her crosses found
