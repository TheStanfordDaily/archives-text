# Stanford Sports 101: A Brief Intro
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Hello, hello, hello. Let me
take this opportunity to in
troduce myself to all you
new readers.

My name is Dan, and you all will
have the pleasure of reading my
rants every Monday all year long.
Since I am a senior, which means I'm
old, I basically know all there is to
know about Stanford sports.
But because I'm a nice guy and I'd
like to endear myself to all of you, I
am going to do everyone a favor and
use this column as a primer on things
you need to know about Stanford
and Stanford sports.
First, and clearly most pertinent:
Enjoy the football team's success.
Jim Harbaugh's boys are 2-1 right
now, which means they have already
won exactly twice as many games
this year as they did my entire fresh
man year.

Don't get jaded by the football
team's success because of us old
balls; we suffered through the days of
Walt Harris the former head
coach whose level of success can best
be summed up by that fact that he is
currently the quarterbacks' coach at
Akron.

Back in 2006, when Stanford was
just a flicker in the imagination of
you freshmen, we watched the team
flop its way to a 1-11 record.

Stanford scored one combined
touchdown in all of its home games
after school started. That isn't a typo.
To add insult to injury, it wasn't even
an offensive touchdown. I didn't
know about the train whistle being
blown when the team scored until I
was a sophomore.

That year, good 'ol Walt dialed up
about as many punts on third down
as he did touchdowns. He had Trent
Edwards the current starting
quarterback of the Buffalo Bills
punt on third down on the first pos
session of the first home game after
NSO started in a brand new stadium.
And then he wondered why people
stopped going to the games.
What I'm trying to say is that this
year's football team is good. Very
good. Maybe, just maybe, it will go to
a bowl game this year, which would
be Stanford's first since 2001. So,
take advantage of it, kiddies go to
the games, and root on the team be
cause they are fun to watch and be
cause Walt Harris is gone.
Second, and this is for those of
you who, like me, aren't from the Bay
Area: Don't try to watch your favorite
team's games. Stanford won't let you.
I really hate to be the one telling
you this. You are all in the NSO
phase when Stanford is perfect and
everything is peaches and cream.
You love your dorm, you love the op
portunities Stanford gives you, you
love that you can say you go to Stan
ford, blah, blah, blah.

Well, I'm going to be that guy who
tells you Santa Claus ain't real.
I root for a lot of professional
sports teams, and none of them is
from the Bay Area. I worked hard
this summer and made money, and I
would love to spend that money on
NFL Sunday Ticket so I can see my
Kansas City Chiefs play (maybe not
after their performance yesterday,
though), or MLB Extra Innings to
watch my New York Yankees.
Nope, Stanford won't let that hap
pen. You see, Stanford yes, I am
personifying the University loves
its power and control. You will find
the way the administration operates
to be convoluted in good times and
maddening in others, and there is no
more basic example than the monop
oly on cable that Stanford holds.
You can get Stanford cable or you
can get no cable. There will be no Di
recTV at Stanford, no watching of
out-of-market games. If you try, they
will shut you down and fast. And
shutting things down is one area in
which Stanford is efficient.

Heck, I haven't consulted any law
school friends, but Stanford's czar
like control of cable might even vio
late anti-trust laws. Even if it doesn't,
Teddy Roosevelt definitely wouldn't
be happy about it, and it sure doesn't
help me watch my Chiefs and Yan
kees play.
So, you better suck it up and
watch the Bay Area teams, which un
fortunately happen to be the sorriest
collection of sports teams in the
