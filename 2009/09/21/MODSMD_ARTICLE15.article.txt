# Wigo brothers and Card score big
## Stanford tops all in Invite 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
There are many reasons why the
Stanford men's water polo team
shouldn't be too excited about winning
the NorCal Invitational this weekend
at Avery Aquatic Center. First, it's still
only September. There are more than
15 games left until the national cham
pionship. And the Cardinal still has not
faced the Trojans from Southern Cali
fornia, the defending national champi
ons.

Yet, after beating three teams
ranked nationally in the top 10, it's
doubtful Stanford will be thinking that
way.

The No. 2 Cardinal, who should
jump to No. 1 when the new rankings
come out later this week, defeated No.
4 UCLA 6-5 on Sunday night to cap a
perfect 4-0 streak in the tournament.
"The great things about these types
of tournaments is that they just build
great competition," said senior goalie
Jimmie Sandman.

In the match, Stanford's scoring
came entirely from the dominant Wigo
twins. Early in the first period, senior
driver Drac Wigo found his twin broth
er Janson for the first goal of the game.
On Stanford's next possession, it was
Drac's turn to find the back of the cage,
giving Stanford an early 2-0 lead.
The Bruins got on the board with a
penalty midway through the first, and
then tied the game on their first posses
sion in the second period. Following a
defensive stop, UCLA claimed its first
and only lead, 3-2.

The advantage lasted all of 26 sec
onds, though, as Janson quickly knot
ted the game back at three. Sandman
preserved the tie with a full-extension
save as time expired in the first half

Sandman to begin the second half, the

The Stanford men's water polo team proved why it deserves to be ranked second, or maybe even first, in the country. The Card overcame Cal and UCLA
in the NorCal Invitational this weekend, but didn't get a re-match with the defending national champs from USC, as the Trojans were upset by the Bruins.
the corner. After an initial bobble,
Drac regained control, pump-faked
past a defender and scored. With four
seconds left in the third, Drac scored
once again to give Stanford a 5-3 lead.
The most important stretch of the
game came within the first minute of
the fourth period.
A Stanford five-meter foul gave
UCLA a penalty shot and a chance to
cut the deficit to one. With the crowd
shouting, Sandman, the senior goalie
who is considered by many the best in
the nation, delivered.
"I know [the shooter's] tenden
cies," Sandman said. "He hesitated,
and that was all I needed."
On the ensuing possession, junior
Jeffrey Schwimer drew a five-meter
foul, allowing the alarmingly hot
handed Drac to complete the two-goal
swing.
"Huge momentum swing," Sand
man said. "Schwimer came up big, and
Drac is just clutch."
UCLA scored twice more to close
to 6-5, but Sandman blocked the Bru
ins' final chance with 49 seconds to
play, cementing the victory.
Earlier on Sunday, Stanford de
feated No. 3 Cal 8-7 to advance to the
championship game against the Bru
ins.
The mere fact that UCLA was in
the championship game came as a sur
prise to nearly everyone, as UCLA
had upset No. 1 USC 5-4 in the other
semifinal match.
"Obviously, we were looking for
ward to playing USC and trying to

avenge the loss last year," Sandman
said. "But a win's a win."
On the first day of the tournament,
Stanford cruised to two easy victories
over No. 18 UC-Davis and No. 7 Pep
perdine, winning 16-3 and 15-9, respec
tively.
Against Pepperdine, Drac led all
Stanford scorers with eight goals. Jan
son and Schwimer each had four, and
Ryan Brown and Rudolph each
tacked on a hat trick.
In the UC-Davis match, goals from
Drac, Janson, Schwimer and redshirt
freshman Travis Noll gave Stanford a
comfortable 7-1 lead at halftime and
continued to pour it on in the second
half.
Up next for the Cardinal is a re
match with the Bruins after a two
week layoff. The break leaves plenty of
time for UCLA to prepare for anoth
er potential upset of a No. 1 team, and
plenty of time for Stanford to soak in
its accomplishments.
