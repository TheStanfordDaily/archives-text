# Wigo brothers and Card score big
## Stanford tops all in Invite 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
There are many reasons why the
Stanford men's water polo team
shouldn't be too excited about winning
the NorCal Invitational this weekend
at Avery Aquatic Center. First, it's still
only September. There are more than
15 games left until the national cham
pionship. And the Cardinal still has not
faced the Trojans from Southern Cali
fornia, the defending national champi
ons.

Yet, after beating three teams
ranked nationally in the top 10, it's
doubtful Stanford will be thinking that
way.

The No. 2 Cardinal, who should
jump to No. 1 when the new rankings
come out later this week, defeated No.
4 UCLA 6-5 on Sunday night to cap a
perfect 4-0 streak in the tournament.
"The great things about these types
of tournaments is that they just build
great competition," said senior goalie
Jimmie Sandman.

In the match, Stanford's scoring
came entirely from the dominant Wigo
twins. Early in the first period, senior
driver Drac Wigo found his twin broth
er Janson for the first goal of the game.
On Stanford's next possession, it was
Drac's turn to find the back of the cage,
giving Stanford an early 2-0 lead.
The Bruins got on the board with a
penalty midway through the first, and
then tied the game on their first posses
sion in the second period. Following a
defensive stop, UCLA claimed its first
and only lead, 3-2.

The advantage lasted all of 26 sec
onds, though, as Janson quickly knot
ted the game back at three. Sandman
preserved the tie with a full-extension
save as time expired in the first half
After two consecutive saves by
Sandman to begin the second half, the
Cardinal returned to the Wigos for of
fensive production. On the counter-at
tack after the second save, true fresh
man Paul Rudolph found Drac open in

The Stanford men's water polo team proved why it deserves to be ranked second, or maybe even first, in the country. The Card overcame Cal and UCLA
in the NorCal Invitational this weekend, but didn't get a re-match with the defending national champs from USC, as the Trojans were upset by the Bruins.
