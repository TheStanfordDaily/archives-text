## Housing expands use of keycard access 
### JANE LEPHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A simple swipe of an ID card will
allow all freshmen, as well as
a number of upperclassmen,
to access their dorms and houses
this year.

A major component of the

University's Building
Access Program (BAP),
the card access system
made significant strides

last year, when Housing incorpo
rated all first-year dorms and a

number of recently renovated
upperclass residences

into the system.
Residents of Governor's

Corner dorms Adams and Schiff, as
well as Branner, Crothers, Florence
Moore, Lagunita, Roble, and Stern
and Wilbur Halls now enter their
dorms under the new key card sys
tem.
According to Executive Director
of Student Housing Rodger Whitney,
the BAP is part of a University-wide
project intended to improve building
management and security.
"Several factors prompted the
University to implement this type of
a system," Whitney wrote in an email
to The Daily. "The events at Virginia
Tech several years ago, incidents with
a non-Stanford student living in on
campus locations, the desire to be
more efficient and secure in the man
agement of the exterior doors of all
residences, and the ability to combine
the use of the ID card for building

access, meal plans and
other applications onto
one medium."

Whitney said the first
phase of the program's implementa
tion in all-frosh residences has pro
duced marked improvements in
building security.
"One of the things we have
noticed is that with the audible
alarms, we see a 99 percent decrease
in doors held open and/or propped in
less than 24 hours from implementa
tion," Whitney said, referring to
alarms that sound when doors are
propped open for too long. "With the

BECCA del MONTE/
The Stanford Daily

20 minute alert to staff,
we have immediate
response rather than
waiting for someone to
report a door not closing properly."

The BAP also allows residents to
cancel access rights in the event of a
lost card.
Additional features include the
audible door alarms, alerts sent via
text message when doors are not
closed properly, the ability to post
alert messages to students and the
ability for remote management all
so the building can be made more
secure.

The project has been a collabora
tion between Housing, Dining,
Residential Education, IT Services,
Public Safety, Risk Management
and the ID card office, among
other University organizations.
While the BAP initiative has been a
fairly recent development, Housing
had been installing card access to res-

idences under renovation
since 2000.

With the first
phase of the BAP com-

pleted last year, Housing will
now focus on implementing the pro-

gram in the remaining large
residences, including
Manzanita, Toyon and the

rest of Governor's
Corner. While the card

access system will not be installed in
any more buildings this year, addi
tional phases will be developed as
budget, schedule and further
approvals permit.
The program will continue until
all residences and eventually all
campus facilities are covered by
card access, Whitney said.
Because the card readers operate
using a thin wire spread through the
card, Whitney also stressed the
importance of ID card maintenance,
including refraining from punching
holes in them. "One problem of
which we have learned is that dam
aged ID cards cannot be read cor
rectly by the door readers," he said.
