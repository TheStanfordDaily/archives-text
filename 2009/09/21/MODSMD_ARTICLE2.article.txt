# Three books for '13
## Authors Chang, Gladwell and Verghese greet freshmen at Memorial Auditorium 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A standing ovation greeted authors
Malcolm Gladwell, Samantha Chang and
Abraham Verghese Wednesday night as they
walked onto the stage of Memorial
Auditorium for the annual Three Books pres
entation.

As in past years, incoming Stanford fresh
men were sent three books to read during the
summer months in preparation for a forum
with the authors. This year, freshmen received
Gladwell's Outliers, Chang's Hunger and

Verghese's My Own Country.
The books were chosen by Michelle Elam,
English professor and director of the Program
in African and African American Studies, and
husband Harry Elam, drama professor and
senior associate vice provost for education.
The Elams said they selected the books
because of the way in which they address
issues of both past and present.
The books discuss "the question of how
past histories shape the present," Harry Elam
said. "It's relevant to [freshmen] as [they are]
moving from high school and home to
Stanford."

The Elams asked the packed auditorium
questions during the first portion of the pro
gram, before opening the floor to students for
a Q&A with the authors.

Michelle Elam opened the discussion with
the question of merit and talent in each of the
books, beginning with Gladwell's Outliers and
the way he frames successful people as a prod
uct of their circumstances.

"You can't rank people in an organized
way ... It's not a pure measure of their own
merit; it's a measure of a whole basket of

could do about the spiritual [side]."
Chang also addressed success in
her own life and in her book
Hunger, which grapples with issues
facing Asian immigrants in the U.S.
"I think all of us must find our
own measures of success internally,"
she said. "I think there's too much
emphasis in society on external
measures of success."
The authors also discussed the
role of multiculturalism in their
works, and how they chose the titles.
The Elams closed the discussion
with the question of how the
authors felt at the start of their
freshman years of college.
Gladwell described how just
before starting college he had an
accident in which he impaled him
self near to his eye. The doctor
thought he had suffered brain
damage and told Gladwell's father
that he would never actually go to
college. But Gladwell, with a
swollen, distorted head, insisted he
was fine.
"My experience as a freshman
was thinking, 'Wow, I'm the most

things," Gladwell said. "[Successful
people] got lucky, and we should be
honest about that."
"That applies to this class as
well," Michelle Elam added as the
crowd of incoming Stanford stu
dents cheered.
When Verghese spoke about suc
cess, he related it back to his parents
as well as to the freshman class.
"Middle class Indian parents are
a lot like middle class Jewish par
ents," he said. "It's either doctor,
lawyer, engineer or failure."
Verghese then outlined his per
sonal success: his work with AIDS in
Johnson City, Tenn., in the 1980s
detailed in his book My Own
Country.
"I learned the distinction
between healing and curing," he
said. Though he could not cure
AIDS, "there was so much someone

hideous thing on the planet,'" he
said.
Chang had a less violent, but still
challenging experience,
"It was the first time I had ever
been on an airplane," she said,
describing her move from Wisconsin
to the east coast. "It was a huge cul
ture shock for me."
Verghese, who went to college in
India, described the hazing he
endured as a freshman. Older peers
shaved his sideburns up the side of
his head to identify him as a fresh
man, and every time he saw a senior,
he had to salute.
The final question of the night
came from a freshman living in
Ujamaa, who wondered how he
could balance his cultural identity as
an African American with his desire
to move forward at Stanford. He
asked also how a person balances
the pulls of people who criticize him
for assimilating too much, versus
those who think he hasn't assimilat
ed enough.
"You're framing the fundamen
tal choice," Verghese said.

Chang addressed the question by
describing her own college experi
ence.
"What really helped me was find
ing good friends," she said. "You'll
find yourself over and over in your
friends."
Gladwell talked about his moth
er and how she combined aspects of
her Jamaican heritage with her
English and Canadian identities.
"Sometimes, you can pick and
choose the pieces of culture you

take with you," he said. "[My moth
er] was creating a kind of new self,
and that for me has always been the
ideal."
The authors received a standing
ovation from the crowd before
freshmen filed out to continue the
discussion in their dorms.
Reactions
Freshmen generally agreed that
the forum was a great orientation
experience, due in large part to the

questions of their peers.
"I was incredibly impressed by
the kind of questions people were
asking," said Sidd Jagadish 'l3.
''Also, by the cohesion between
authors when answering. I noticed
parallels between the books I didn't
notice when reading."
Katherine Lee 'l3 agreed.
"Listening to the questions of my
peers [was my favorite part.] It just
amazed me at the level of intellect."
Samir Junnarkar 'l3 also thought
the questions were an excellent part
of the program. "[The questions]
gave a deeper understanding of who
you're going to work with for the
next four years, and that's some
thing special," he said.
Sabrina Bedford 'l3 enjoyed the
event simply because the authors
surprised her. "I stereotyped them,
honestly. I guess you put them on a
pedestal, but they're just people ...
It just makes you feel like they're
not above and beyond," she said.
