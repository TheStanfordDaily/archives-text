# Three books for '13
## Authors Chang, Gladwell and Verghese greet freshmen at Memorial Auditorium 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A standing ovation greeted authors
Malcolm Gladwell, Samantha Chang and
Abraham Verghese Wednesday night as they
walked onto the stage of Memorial
Auditorium for the annual Three Books pres
entation.

As in past years, incoming Stanford fresh
men were sent three books to read during the
summer months in preparation for a forum
with the authors. This year, freshmen received
Gladwell's Outliers, Chang's Hunger and

Verghese's My Own Country.
The books were chosen by Michelle Elam,
English professor and director of the Program
in African and African American Studies, and
husband Harry Elam, drama professor and
senior associate vice provost for education.
The Elams said they selected the books
because of the way in which they address
issues of both past and present.
The books discuss "the question of how
past histories shape the present," Harry Elam
said. "It's relevant to [freshmen] as [they are]
moving from high school and home to
Stanford."

The Elams asked the packed auditorium
questions during the first portion of the pro
gram, before opening the floor to students for
a Q&A with the authors.

Michelle Elam opened the discussion with
the question of merit and talent in each of the
books, beginning with Gladwell's Outliers and
the way he frames successful people as a prod
uct of their circumstances.

"You can't rank people in an organized
way ... It's not a pure measure of their own
merit; it's a measure of a whole basket of
