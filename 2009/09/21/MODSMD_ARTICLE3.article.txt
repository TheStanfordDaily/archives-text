## Old Union bookings go online ASSU Executive Office implements pilot program 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
The Old Union room reservation
system is making its way online, under
the direction of the ASSU Executive
Office. The old paper system the
focus of many student complaints
will be completely phased out by
November, ASSU President David
Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO estimated.
Accessible on the ASSU Web site,
the pilot program allows Stanford stu
dents to reserve space right from their
computers. While the pilot was just
recently launched on Sept. 15 with only
one room available, 46 reservations
have already been made.
"You can see online that people are
using it," said Gobaud, who included
the project in his campaign platform
last spring. He initiated the project at
the beginning of summer with the assis
tance of his Technology Co-Chairs,
Riddhi Mittal 'll and Jeff Wear *ll, and
VPSA Associate Vice Provost Chris
Griffith.

Gobaud tentatively estimates an
expansion of the pilot in a month's time.
"We want to make sure that we get
rid of any bugs and that students like
it," he said of the trial run. Users are
encouraged to give feedback and report
problems to the ASSU by an email link,
and Mittal will maintain the system
throughout the year.
Eventually, all rooms with paper
sign-up sheets will be added to the
online system, while rooms like the ball
room will remain unavailable for reser
vations.

As of yet, the problems have come
from policy issues rather than the tech
nology itself. Over the summer, Mittal
and Gobaud worked extensively with
Griffith on how to make the Web site
functional while still observing VPSA
guidelines.

"There are definitely small issues,
especially with policy things like 'you
should only make one reservation' and
how to track that," Mittal said.
A main challenge, she added, is
ensuring individuals are reserving space
for group meetings rather than for per
sonal work space.
"It's technically not allowed for
someone to schedule time for individual
study, but then it's a question of how do
we monitor it," Mittal said.
Even with minor difficulties,
Gobaud bills the online program as a
vast improvement over the old paper
system. Before, students were required
to travel to Old Union and physical
ly mark off timeslots every time they
wanted to reserve a space.
Cancelling a reservation also neces
sitated a trip to Old Union.
"They just had spreadsheets on
the door each sheet represented
a week and you could write in
your group name," Gobaud said.
"But most just scribbled in their
name and blocked off time,"

Missing sheets and inadequate
supervision were the target of fre
quent complaints by student groups.
Following the expansion of the
pilot program, Gobaud hopes to
move on to a restructuring of the
Old Union administration.
"VPSA helped set the policies,
but in the future we are hopeful the
Old Union Advisory Board will set
the policies for the rooms because
we believe students should set the
policies for student space," Gobaud
said.
