# CONQUERING SPARTA
## Owusu and Gerhart lift Card in home opener 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One year ago, Stanford was forced to
battle San Jose State for four quarters in
a 23-10 victory that was a lot closer than
the 13-point margin would indicate.
This year? The Cardinal cruised.
Stanford showed the difference a year
makes, outclassing the Spartans from the
very first play on Saturday night, literally,
in a 42-17 win at Stanford Stadium.
Sophomore wideout Chris Owusu got
things started on the first play of the
game with a 94-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown, affirming coach Jim
Harbaugh's decision to receive after win
ning the coin toss.
"There was a big seam and I wanted to
make sure I hit it," Owusu said of the
return. "I just hit the hole as fast as I
could."

"It's awesome," said redshirt freshman
quarterback Andrew Luck. "When one
guy can take the ball to the house and
make the whole crowd just stop and
watch, it's amazing. It takes so much pres
sure off the offense. It's wonderful."

Big plays were the story of the game
for Stanford, and Owusu wasn't the only
one contributing on that front. Junior cor
nerback Corey Gatewood's 23-yard inter
ception return of an errant pass by
Spartan quarterback Jordan La Secla
pushed Stanford's lead to 28-7 at the
beginning of the second half, effectively
putting the game away. Senior corner
Richard Sherman tacked on more points
for the Cardinal with a 48-yard punt
return for a touchdown, and junior Doug
Baldwin had a 64-yard kick return of his
own that placed Stanford deep within

GAME NOTES: Stanford won its home opener in a
decisive win over the Spartans, but the Huskies are
coming off a huge home win of their own, upset
ting USC 16-13 with a field goal on the final
drive. The matchup will test whether Washington's
Pac-10 opener was a fluke, as well as the Card's
ability to be a real conference contender.
