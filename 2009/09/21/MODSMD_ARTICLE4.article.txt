# CONQUERING SPARTA
## Owusu and Gerhart lift Card in home opener 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One year ago, Stanford was forced to
battle San Jose State for four quarters in
a 23-10 victory that was a lot closer than
the 13-point margin would indicate.
This year? The Cardinal cruised.
Stanford showed the difference a year
makes, outclassing the Spartans from the
very first play on Saturday night, literally,
in a 42-17 win at Stanford Stadium.
Sophomore wideout Chris Owusu got
things started on the first play of the
game with a 94-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown, affirming coach Jim
Harbaugh's decision to receive after win
ning the coin toss.
"There was a big seam and I wanted to
make sure I hit it," Owusu said of the
return. "I just hit the hole as fast as I
could."

"It's awesome," said redshirt freshman
quarterback Andrew Luck. "When one
guy can take the ball to the house and
make the whole crowd just stop and
watch, it's amazing. It takes so much pres
sure off the offense. It's wonderful."

Big plays were the story of the game
for Stanford, and Owusu wasn't the only
one contributing on that front. Junior cor
nerback Corey Gatewood's 23-yard inter
ception return of an errant pass by
Spartan quarterback Jordan La Secla
pushed Stanford's lead to 28-7 at the
beginning of the second half, effectively
putting the game away. Senior corner
Richard Sherman tacked on more points
for the Cardinal with a 48-yard punt
return for a touchdown, and junior Doug
Baldwin had a 64-yard kick return of his
own that placed Stanford deep within

GAME NOTES: Stanford won its home opener in a
decisive win over the Spartans, but the Huskies are
coming off a huge home win of their own, upset
ting USC 16-13 with a field goal on the final
drive. The matchup will test whether Washington's
Pac-10 opener was a fluke, as well as the Card's
ability to be a real conference contender.

The Cardinal entered Stanford Stadium for the first home game against San Jose State. The Cardinal got an early lead, scoring on
the opening kick-off return, and never looked back. In the end, the Spartans proved no match for the red and white, falling 42-1 7.

Spartan territory.
"I was really pleased with the special
teams," Harbaugh said of the impressive re
turns. "It's very obvious the way they gave a
huge lift to our team."

Senior running back Toby Gerhart was his
usual workhorse self, dragging Spartan defend
ers across the field with 116 yards and two
touchdowns on 24 carries.

The Cardinal defense also turned in a
strong performance, as sophomore defensive
end Tom Keiser notched three sacks, one of
them coming for a 16-yard loss on a trick play
gone wrong. The Spartans had little success
moving the ball overall, with only 228 total
yards of total offense for the game.
"I was really pleased with the defense,"

Harbaugh said. "I really felt like they were run
ning to the ball. The identity of our defense
what we want to be about was there
tonight."

Still, Owusu was the uncontested star of the
game for Stanford, also adding to his night with
a 24-yard touchdown reception. Owusu fin
ished the game with three catches and 51 yards.
"I need three explosive plays out of you
tonight," Harbaugh told Owusu before the
game. "You choose how [you get them], but we
need three."
"And he got 'em," Harbaugh added.

Though it was an easy win for the Cardinal
overall, it didn't come without its blunders.
Three different Stanford running backs
Gerhart, senior Jeremy Stewart and freshman

Stepfan Taylor all fumbled the football;
each one was recovered by a Spartan defender.
Luck also had a turnover of his own, throwing
an interception in the second quarter when the
Cardinal was in the red zone and threatening
to score. Interception aside, the redshirt fresh
man still had a solid game, completing 9-of-12
passes for 170 yards and a touchdown.
"Andrew had some nice throws," Harbaugh
said. "He had one decision a lot of things are
learning experiences for him right now. But
when you can lead your team to a big win like
this, that's very encouraging as well."
Senior quarterback Tavita Pritchard also
got into the game for his first action of the sea
son. The former starter completed two of three

passes after taking over for Luck in the fourth

quarter.
Up next is a team coming off of a much big
ger win: the Washington Huskies. The Huskies
suffered one of the worst seasons in program
history last year much like the one Stanford
went through in 2006 but have already
made their mark this season after stunning
USC on Saturday in a 16-13 win.
"They're a different team," Gerhart said of
Washington. "They're confident, they're play
ing hard, they're playing well. They're going to
be a team to contend with."

Stanford faces the Huskies at Stanford Sta
dium this Saturday, Sept. 26. Kick-off is set for
