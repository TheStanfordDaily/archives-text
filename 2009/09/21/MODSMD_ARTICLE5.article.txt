## Sophomore class greeted by president Students begin second year at Farm with awards and counsel 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
All eyes are on the Class of 2012.
At least that was the message to sophomores
Sunday from top administrators, who welcomed
them to year two on the Farm in 95-degree
White Plaza.

"The Class of 2013 needs some inspiration,"
President John Hennessey told a near-capacity
audience in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. "And you
are their older Stanford siblings."
Elizabeth Fox, associate dean of
Undergraduate Advising and Research (UAR),
said she also has an eye on the new upperclass
men for another reason one that had some
sophomores sweating.

About 50 percent of the Class of 2012 have
yet to declare majors, said Fox, the de-facto dean
of sophomores.

That's a typical number for September, Fox
told The Daily, but she was clear with students:
the time to declare looms closer. "I encourage
you to reject the notion that a major is just a col
lection of courses," Fox told sophomores, saying
their academic passions matter now more than
ever.

Hennessey also said that for these students,
time is precious.

"You have three years left," Hennessey said,
"so I encourage you ... to get on with it."
As fall quarter begins, many sophomores are
now thinking about how they will get on with it.
Ben Yashar 'l2, who is undeclared, summed up
what many sophomores seemed to feel Sunday,
the day before classes were set to begin.
"What's on my mind?" Yashar asked himself.
"Class shopping. More broadly, defining my
interests."

Annie Kramer 'l2, another undeclared soph
omore, agreed.

"I'm just interested in a lot of things," she
said. "I don't want to tie myself down."
Kramer was one of 66 sophomores to receive
the President's Award for Academic Excellence
on Sunday, a merit Hennessey said reflects
"extraordinary academic energy."
Also speaking was Dean of Freshmen Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9, who sought to assure soph
omores regarding the merger this summer of the
Freshmen Dean's Office (FDO) and UAR.

"The FDO name is no more, but our ethos
lives on," Lythcott-Haims said. "I now have per
mission to care about each and every one of
you."

She thanked sophomore Orientation
Volunteers "the best Fve seen" and mem
bers of the newly victorious football team,
including redshirt freshman quarterback
Andrew Luck 'l2.

After the event, Fox spoke to The Daily
about changes to the academic advising she
helps oversee changes she believes will bene-
fit the Class of 2012.
"Last year, we could say we had
Academic Directors in every resi
dence with freshman," Fox said.
"Now, we can say that for sopho
mores."

That move, she said, included the
hire of three new advisors. Her
office did not anticipate sopho
mores living in Mirrielees and
Branner this year, she said, so
Crothers Director Leslie Walton
Monstavicius will cover those
dorms.
Meanwhile, sophomore class
presidents on Sunday also sought to
highlight their focus on their class.
"We started off last year with the

[presidential] election, which was
really special," said Isabelle
Wijangco 'l2, a class president along
with Adrian Castillo 'l2, Marie
Caligiuri 'l2 and Taylor Goodspeed
'l2.
"We don't want people to feel
that opportunities have run out,"
Caligiuri said.
