## New blood, sweat and cheers A 						look at the life of an Orientation Volunteer 
### MELANIE SCHEIBLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
We all remember it: arriving on
campus for the first time as
freshmen amid a sea of peppy,
red-clad students who eagerly
moved boxes from our cars to
our dorm rooms. They hung around for the rest
of the week, handing out lunches and hanging up
signs at New Student Orientation (NSO) events
like Three Books and academic panels. But who
were they? And what were they doing here?
"We woke up really early, moved boxes and
yelled at cars, which was really embarrassing,"
said Elena Carano 'l2, an Orientation
Volunteer (OV). She added: "We had a really
good time."
Carano was one of about 100 OVs who
spent this week helping to make NSO run
smoothly. The OVs are the unsung heroes of
orientation, working feverishly to man booths
and ensure the Farm welcomes its frosh with
open arms.
Along with helping freshmen and transfers
move in last Tuesday, OV duties included work
ing events throughout the week.
"Basically, you have to show new students
the best side of Stanford as an OV," explained
OV Colin Gray 'l2. "We spend our time doing
whatever they want us to do a plethora of
activities from moving tables to moving in
freshmen to handing out T-shirts."
But being an OV isn't just about a warm
smile and a sprightly attitude it requires a
lot of heavy lifting, too. The 4,000 chairs in the
Quad for Convocation are set up and removed
by OVs every year. The 50-pound drapes that
line the walls of Arrillaga gym for Parents'
Dinner are removed and stored by OVs. Plastic
signs with Stanford balloons, which identify

various NSO events, are set up and collected by
OVs.

Carano had to move gigantic umbrella
stands as part of her OV duties.
"I'm still sore, three days later," she laughed.
"Folding the drapes was actually quite miser
able."

Still, other projects lent themselves better to
fun.

"We raced to see how fast we could unfold
chairs setting up for Parents' Dinner," said OV
Sam Julian 'lO.
And don't underestimate the toll that 24-7
friendliness takes on you.

"Being constantly enthusiastic is hard,"
Gray said, "and dealing with people who have
way too much stuff."
Other OVs struggled more with the round
the-clock schedule of NSO activities.

"It was inconsistent," Julian said.
"Sometimes we got up at 6 a.m., and other
times we were not expected until 1 p.m."

That time schedule can be hard on the OVs,
with the rest of the campus abuzz and prepar
ing for the upcoming year. Student groups are
publishing marketing materials, the Haas
Center is training student group leaders and a
cappella groups are gearing up for audition
season.

"Being an OV is not that hard if you don't
have anything else to do," said Julian, a mem
ber of Fleet Street. "The problem was balanc
ing Fleet Street with all of the OV duties."

Their official duties aside, OVs also take on
the informal roles of guiding freshmen through
their first few days. If there was an awkward
silence in a circle of freshmen, OVs would
swoop in and strike up conversations. One OV
even explained how the General Education
Requirements work to a group of confused
freshmen during lunch.

And the freshmen surely appreciated it.
"I think the freshmen liked us," Gray said.
"They appreciated the warmth when they were
coming to a strange new place and living for
the first time."
At one of their final NSO events Friday
morning, freshmen received Class of 'l3 shirts.
Even though they might not have known who
the OVs were when they arrived, Carano noted
that by Friday morning, when the freshmen
thanked OVs for their shirts, they genuinely
meant it.
OVs also get some additional perks, like
spending quality time with campus veterans
and each other.
"You meet cool people," Julian said, refer
ring to other volunteers. For days before the
arrival of the new students, OVs dined togeth
er and relaxed together between shifts.
"I dislike Wilbur food, but I actually liked
eating there because I ate with people I know
but never see," laughed Carano.
Numerous OVs spent the evenings spending
time together, watching Surf Ninjas, cheering
on Stanford athletics or gathering at the Claw.
"I made the best friends I've ever had in OV
training," Gray half-joked. "Without a lot of
people around, we had a lot of time to bond."
Hands down, though, the best part of being
an OV seems to be moving the freshmen in on
Tuesday morning.
"I was a little skeptical of the over-enthusi
asm and my staff knowing my name when I
arrived as a freshman," Julian recalled. "But
now that I've been a part of it, I see it's fun to
help the freshmen. Hopefully, they see us for
that and they think that maybe next year they'll
help somebody else move in."
