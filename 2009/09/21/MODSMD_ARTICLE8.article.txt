## Researchers set out to revolutionize cameras Prototype allows adding new programming

Inside the Gates Computer
Science Building, graduate students
are hard at work tending to the pro
totypes of the "Frankencamera."
Developed by computer science and
electrical engineering Prof. Marc
Levoy, the camera has the potential
to revolutionize the photographic
industry.
Unlike current camera models,
the Frankencamera allows users to
modify the software of the camera
and control aspects of their own pho
tos. Users, then, can create applica
tions and add them to their cameras
a feature that may, in the future,
lead to an entirely separate market
for camera applications.
"The idea was, 'Let's build a pro
grammable camera that researchers
could use,'" Levoy said. "We'll dis
tribute a few of them to researchers
and students, and then we'll see who
steps forward to want to make more
of them."
The Frankencamera project bene
fitted from an unexpected partner:
Nokia. While most known for cell
phones, Nokia is actually the world's
largest manufacturer of cameras,
according to Nokia research fellow
Kari Pulli.
Pulli hopes the programmable
camera can lead to more features for
Nokia cell phone products.
Doctoral candidate in electrical

engineering Eddy Talvala, a student
of Levoy's, explained that conven
tional camera companies were less
interested in open-source research.
"[Camera companies] are very afraid
of letting their secrets about how to
take good pictures get out," he said.
Andrew Adams, doctoral candi-

date in computer science and a
researcher for Levoy, added: "The
industry is very much against hacking
your camera and looking under the
hood."
Levoy explained that cell phones
"were already a programmable plat
form that could take pretty decent
pictures." Thus, cell phones were a
plausible transition platform for a
programmable camera.
The special prototype camera
contains much of the same equip
ment inside a cell phone, but it has a
