## EDITOR'S WELCOME Stanford, Daily and You 
### DEVIN BANERJEE Editor in Chief, Vol. CCXXXVI 
This isn't your typical welcome from
the editor. First, it's more about you
than it is me.
Of course, it's not my place to pretend I
know more about you than you do. But I
can tell you one thing: As a member of the
Stanford community a community
more vibrant and diverse than most others
on this planet it is a responsibility of
each of us to be aware at all times of this
place in which we live and work.
A lot happens at Stanford, and sure, it's
near-impossible to remain on top of it all.
But just by reading this column and
hopefully the entirety of this paper
you've taken the first step, choosing to in
form yourself about Stanford, its people
and its happenings. For almost 120 years,
The Stanford Daily has prided itself on
doing just that providing readers with
the most crucial updates, in-depth cover
age, heart-warming stories and entertain
ing reviews they need to truly feel a deep
connection to the Stanford community.
As editor in chief, I know The Daily's
mission carries with it a weighty responsi
bility. For the past three months and the
next six, I have ensured and will continue
to ensure this organization publishes the
most relevant content pursuant to the ut
most standards of accuracy and ethics.
But, I'll admit, The Daily's staff and I can
not do it alone. A news organization such as
ours is built upon discussion, upon concern
and, most of all, upon your thoughts and ac
tions. If you care about your community
enough to be aware of its issues and even
spread that awareness by your own means,
we at The Daily will be able to capture the
true essence of Stanford more fully.
Being informed takes effort, but it
comes with payoffs. And for anyone
faculty or staff, parent or student, alumnus
or nearby resident The Daily is your
most easily accessible lifeline. Pick up a
print edition at one of 150 campus loca
tions or one of 400 locations in Palo Alto,
Menlo Park, Atherton and Mountain
View. Read us online at stanforddaily.com.

While The Daily, like many publica
tions, is contending with an outdated busi
ness model that's rapidly losing traction in
today's increasingly technological world,
it's clear our accessibility is only expand
ing. We've operated and will continue to
operate with the full force of our 150+
staff, unwavering in our commitment to
the mission I've addressed above.

In line with that commitment, for the en
tirety of my term as editor I will be com
pletely open to your concerns, input and
general communication at all times. Any
thing you send to eic@stanforddaily.com
arrives instantly on the phone in my pocket,
and I do my best to reply as soon as possi
ble, I'm also in my office on the second floor
of the Lorry I. Lokey Building after 6:30
p.m. Sunday through Thursday, where you
can reach me either by stopping by and
pressing the red button downstairs or by
calling me at (650) 721-5815.
The Daily has entered its 236 th volume
and shows no signs of slowing down. We
depend on you, the reader, not only to get
your daily news from our knowledgeable
and experienced staff, but to become a
truly aware community member who, for
all of our benefit, spreads that awareness
through further discussion and debate.
Quality journalism will never die, and with
an educated, informed readership who
truly care about this community, neither
will The Stanford Daily.
Sincerely,
