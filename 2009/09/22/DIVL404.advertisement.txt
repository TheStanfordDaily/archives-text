TO MAKE SURE
IT DOESN'T
Multiple sclerosis interrupts the
flow of information between
the brain and the body and
stops people from moving.
With the help of people like
you, the National MS Society
addresses the challenges of
each person whose life is
affected by MS and helps
them stay connected to the
great big moving world.
