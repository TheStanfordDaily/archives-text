# Researchers find way to transform fat cells into stem cells
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Scientists at Stanford Medical
School have discovered a procedure
that can transform fat cells into
pluripotent stem cells. Induced
pluripotent stem cells (IPS) are
believed to be similar to embryonic

stem cells in their ability to differen
tiate into almost any type of cell in
the body.

This is the first time IPS have
been created from fat cells, said
Stanford cardiologist Dr. Joseph
Wu. While IPS have been previous
ly created from skin cells, fat cells
allow IPS colonies to be grown
more quickly and with greater effi
ciency.

"If you get biopsy from patient's
skin, it takes four to five weeks to
grow the biopsy cells up to start the
reprogramming process," Wu said.
"When you start the process using
skin cells, it takes another four
weeks to start getting the IPS
colony, and the number of these
colonies tends to be quite low.
"Conversely, from the fat cells, if
we get the fat from patient, we start
the reprogramming process by the
second day," Wu added. "By about
two to three weeks that's roughly
day 16 —we start seeing the IPS
colonies. The number of colonies we
start seeing is about 20 times higher
than the skin cells."
The team used fat left over from
liposuction procedures conducted
by Stanford plastic surgeon Michael
Longaker, who co-authored the
research.

The new discovery could have a
significant impact on stem cell
research and the clinical application
of stem cells. Wu said that currently,
there are two main problems with
the use of embryonic stem cells:
"The first problem is an ethical and
political debate," he said. "You have
to deal with the religious right. But
with IPS, we are not destroying any
thing."

The second problem with
embryonic stem cells, Wu said, is
that they could cause immunologi
cal reactions in individuals who
are receiving stem cell therapy
through embryonic stem cells not
derived from their own bodies.
However, with the IPS approach,
fat cells could be taken from an
individual's body, transformed into
IPS and then re-injected into the
patient.

The research team has already
successfully differentiated the IPS
generated from fat cells into neu
rons, muscle and the lining of the
gut, although it may take years
before this research will be ready for
clinical application.
