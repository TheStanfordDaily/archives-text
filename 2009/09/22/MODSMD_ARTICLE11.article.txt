## A 						BROAD ABROAD Summer in Nordak: A Reflection 
### Molly Spaeth 
Unlike many of my outstanding Stan
ford friends, some of whom were
landing jaw-dropping summer intern
ships in New York, L.A. and D.C., or fighting
for basic human rights on the Internet (vote
National Marriage Boycott), I went home
this summer to good ol" Fargo, N.D. I went
home to free room and board and 14-hour
workdays, all of which went toward saving
money for the time I am spending in Madrid
this fall.
Although it was good to see familiar faces,
the "How come you're not still out in Califor
nia? If I were there I'd NEVER leave" and
the helpful-but-hurtful words of encourage
ment, "Yeah my cousin interned for Kent
Conrad when she was your age!" became
wearing after awhile. I found myself more
than I'd like to admit spouting back at them
almost before the accusatory words had left
their mouths, "YEAH, WELL I'M GOING
TO SPAIN IN THE FALL SO I HAD TO
COME HOME AND SAVE MONEY. BUT
I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING
COOL AND IMPORTANT TOO!"
I was blinded by my own self-pity. My jobs
this summer were by no means star-studded
resume builders, and thus my ability to have
any sort of meaningful, visceral impact on the
world had been put miserably on hold. I was
in North Dakota once again, working two
jobs, one at a new restaurant and the other at
a law firm in town.

Somewhere in the lazy span of summer,
during the middle of one of the 14-hour days,
I grabbed some old TIME magazines that my
supervisor at the law firm had wanted me to
throw away (not recycle. The green move
ment has yet to hit North Dakota with the
same fervor that has encompassed our
beloved California). Instead, I took the stack
and brought them over to the restaurant, re
membering that the only literature we had
for customers to entertain themselves while
waiting for a table was a three-month-old
copy of a Fargo real estate magazine.
At the end of the night, as I was leafing
through TIME'S 100 Most Influential People
issue, the busing supervisor came up to me.
Her name is Nedzada; she's a 24-year-old sin
gle mother with a son in kindergarten and the
last and only living survivor of her mother's
six daughters. Nedzada is a Roma, and her

parents emigrated from Bosnia when she was
14. Nedzada works 40 hours a week polishing
silver, cleaning glasses and clearing and set
ting tables for a wage not much higher than
minimum. However, she does it extremely
well.
Nedzada walked up to me that night and
pointed to the cartoon caricature TIME was
using to feature Nicolas Sarkozy. She pointed
to it and said, "Who is that funny-looking
man?" After I explained, she looked at me
for a moment and remarked in her heavily
accented English, "Read me something.
About him. What it say about him?"
I scanned the paragraph and found a
quote from Sarkozy himself. I hadn't realized
before I started reading, but as I did, it hit me
how pertinent the quote was to everything
Nedzada had endured during her still young
but very difficult life. "Every time a woman is
martyred in the world, that woman should be
recognized as a French citizen, and France
will stand at her side."
Nedzada just looked at me with her big
brown eyes and, after a couple of moments,
quietly said, "I want to be French. Can you
write his name down for me? I look him up
when I go to my home." I wrote his name on
a yellow post-it note, and as she walked back
to her tables I could hear her whispering to
herself, "Hey, I like this guy."
Before leaving work that night, I ripped
out the cartoon picture that had first caught
her attention and placed it next to the yellow
post-it on top of her purse. I left the restau
rant around 11 p.m. with a new outlook on
my summer. Powerful internships and high
flying campaigns may indeed change the
world, but this summer, one of the most
meaningful things I could do was to help one
surviving Roma daughter believe in the idea
that men in power will no longer tolerate the
abuse of women. And that belief will yield
something so much stronger and undeniable
than any line on a resume. Moments like that
made the 14-hour days of summer in North
Dakota definitely worth it.

After those long summer days in Dakota,
Molly is now having too much fun as she
shenaniganizes through Europe. Email her at
mspaeth@stanford.edu to be regaled with tales
ofol' Fargo.
