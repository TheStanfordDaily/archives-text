# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## The 						Year of Renewal 
### Danny Crichton 
It has not been a pleasant year for the coun
try, and higher education has not been
spared. Stanford has weathered the down
turn in the global economy better than most,
but it is not immune to the major challenges in
academia that have been percolating beneath
the surface. This is the year the old rulebook is
thrown out.
Ranking after ranking indicates that the
American higher education system remains
second to none. Yet during no time in recent
memory has the mission of the University
been put under so much strain.
Money is one problem. While states have
dramatically increased funding for higher edu
cation over the last few decades, their budgets
have not matched the growth of institutions.
Private universities like Stanford rely on
money from their endowments and income
from government-sponsored research projects
money that has become scarcer even before
the current recession (stimulus funding ex
cepted).
Money, though, is only the first issue. Entire
disciplines are facing somewhat of a cathartic
moment, most notably economics. After years
of developing that social science with precise
mathematical laws of the market, economists
are faced with a world that few believed was
even possible but three years ago. How much
of the literature needs to be reworked or,
worse, thrown out entirely?

These two failures come at a time when the
fundamental unit of the academy, tenure, is
under fire from administrators and state legis
latures. At a basic level, tenure provides the se
curity underpinning academic freedom. Yet,
fewer faculty members are making it to the
tenure-track, damaging innovation and risking
future advances in all fields.

These are merely a few of the front-burner
issues that are currently plaguing higher edu
cation in the United States. It is not a comfort
able time to be a college student. Yet, for all of
these problems, there has never been a better
time to be studying at a university.
Edison claimed necessity breeds innova
tion. What we are witnessing right now is a pe
riod of renewal in higher education a time
that will cement paradigm-shifting changes for
decades to come. Students today have more
power to alter the course of higher education
than at any time in recent memory.
There are several major changes that I see
forthcoming. On a fundamental level,multidis
ciplinary approaches to questions will be stan
dard for more and more academic research.
Fields across the university are merging in a
consilience of the traditional disciplines. Sys
tems biology uses complex systems theories
with biological sciences to better understand

the inner workings of organisms. Many other
fields such as public health, environmental
studies, area studies and sub-fields like neuroe
conomics are constructing the same types of
bridges.
While the tools in many of these new multi
disciplinary areas are crude, their refinement
will lead to a vibrant era of original research.
Complex issues like global warming, energy in
dependence, refugees and stem cells will all see
large strides as existing knowledge is connect
ed.
At the same time, we are seeing more work
devoted to constructing the societal context of
different fields. Engineering does not happen
in a vacuum (metaphorically, some research
literally does). Rather, it is affected by policies
created in Washington, from birthing a new
grant system at the Department of Energy to
expanding opportunities at the National Insti
tutes of Health. A Nobel laureate, Ste ven Chu,
even heads a federal department.
New technologies will further research in
the humanities as well. Historical research is
using more sophisticated techniques such as
GIS mapping to follow the movement of peo
ple and goods. Tools like Facebook and Wiggio
will be studied by digital humanities readers to
analyze how humans adapt to new modes of
interaction. There is fertile ground for growth
in this area.
The stormy clouds of today will lead to the
brilliant dawn of a new age of enlightenment.
That may be an over-the-top exaggeration; of
course, there will be pitfalls, failures and fric
tion in the process. That is where we students
come in.
There are traditional ways of teaching
classes. Do not be afraid to question the con
ventional wisdom. Ask questions that cross
disciplines. We are not beholden to the para
digms of yesterday. From graduate seminars
all the way to that first section of IHUM, ask
questions that cut across the walls placed in ac
ademia. Demand and propel the current
changes.
Eric Hoffer, a social psychologist awarded
the Presidential Medal of Freedom, wrote a
book called The Ordeal of Change. Hoffer
states, "In a time of drastic change, it is the
learners who inherit the future. The learned
usually find themselves equipped to live in a
world that no longer exists." Now, more than
ever, we need to open ourselves to new ideas.
A renewal is underway in academia. Be part of
the adventure.

Danny's adventuring tools include a
Broadsword +1 and a pencil of magical extra
