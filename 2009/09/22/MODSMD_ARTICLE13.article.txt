Re. "Lofting ban put on hold for one year"
Sept. 15,2009

It'll be a shame to see lofting disappear
from campus dorms next year. Housing's de
cision on it is quite reasonable in light of the
increased risk involved with both rule-abid
ing and less orthodox versions of lofting.
However, lofting allows students the choice
to make room for an extra article of furni
ture: the futon. In my experience, students

tend to gather in rooms with futons (or other
added comfortable seating) for activities
from study sessions to Bible study to Halo
tournaments or poker games. Their tendency
to attract group gatherings is probably why
many RAs, who often have room, own fu
tons. For those who want the seating but
don't have the space, there's lofting, until
next year.

Certainly, Housing doesn't need to facili
tate such casual meetings, and the stiff-but

sturdy furniture in the lounges is up to the
task of hosting larger groups. Generations of
students have survived without in-room
guest furniture, and Stanford's dorms are
great. It's just worth noting that a ban on loft
ing will limit the ways students can arrange
their rooms, and impede the sociable futon
culture that past students have enjoyed.
