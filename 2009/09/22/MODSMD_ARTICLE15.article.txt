Klineman posting a triple-double and a double
double, respectively, against the USF Dons. The

25-18,22-25,25-23,25-22 triumph saw season-high

13 kills of her own for the night.
Stanford dominated the first set, pulling out an
early lead with four kills from Okogbaa and red

team's quick run, Klineman shut down the Dons
with three kills and a block assist. The Cardinal
took the set 25-18 over USF.

San Francisco held the lead in a close second
set, before two Klineman kills put Stanford ahead
9-7. A back and forth battle between the Card and

Walker and freshman Hayley Spellman working
for each point as the Card laid down kills and
blocks left and right. The Dons came back to tie it
at 16 and edged Stanford out in a 22-25 set.

Reflecting on the game, head coach John Dun
ning knows that his team, while impressive, has
some areas to work on.

"I think [the team] works really well together
in terms of interpersonally," Dunning said. "I
think they're a pretty close group. I think that one
of our challenges is that we're pretty young, not
just age- but [also] experience-wise.
"In that respect of being together, they're not
executing well enough," he added. "You have to
play together a little bit to be good playing togeth
er. So that's going to come with each week."
Not letting up for a second, Stanford came out
in the third with a 6-1 lead, forcing the Dons to
commit multiple errors.The Dons shook it off and
came back to tie it at nine. Once more, Lichtman
and Klineman came out strong for the Card and

We're one of those teams that has to get
better each day, and we've had a great
attitude about working hard and im
proving. They're taking that real seri
ously and trying to get better each day."

Stanford, now finished with non

puts the Card in a good position prior to
conference play.
"I think there's motivation," Dun

weekends, we lost a match, played
some good teams. We were hoping to
go into the Pac-10 with some momen
tum, and we had some good wins."
