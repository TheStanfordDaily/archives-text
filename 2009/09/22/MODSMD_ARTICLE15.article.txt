### CLAUDIA PRECIADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's volleyball (7-3) closed out
non-conference play with victories over Universi
ty of San Francisco (5-6) and Saint Mary's College
(7-3) to put an emphatic ending to the long-await
ed home opening weekend last Friday and Satur
day.
No. 11 Stanford punched out its first win, 3-1,
on Friday with juniors Cassidy Lichtman and Alix
Klineman posting a triple-double and a double
double, respectively, against the USF Dons. The

25-18,22-25,25-23,25-22 triumph saw season-high
marks for Klineman, who came out with 17 kills
and 17 digs. Lichtman contributed with 10 kills, 20
assists and 14 digs. Senior Janet Okogbaa added in
13 kills of her own for the night.
Stanford dominated the first set, pulling out an
early lead with four kills from Okogbaa and red
shirt freshman Jessica Walker. With a solid overall
performance, Stanford quickly increased the lead
to 13-6. Still rolling on the momentum of her
team's quick run, Klineman shut down the Dons
with three kills and a block assist. The Cardinal
took the set 25-18 over USF.

San Francisco held the lead in a close second
set, before two Klineman kills put Stanford ahead
9-7. A back and forth battle between the Card and
the Dons left Stanford's Okogbaa, Lichtman,
Walker and freshman Hayley Spellman working
for each point as the Card laid down kills and
blocks left and right. The Dons came back to tie it
at 16 and edged Stanford out in a 22-25 set.

Reflecting on the game, head coach John Dun
ning knows that his team, while impressive, has
some areas to work on.

"I think [the team] works really well together
in terms of interpersonally," Dunning said. "I
think they're a pretty close group. I think that one
of our challenges is that we're pretty young, not
just age- but [also] experience-wise.
"In that respect of being together, they're not
executing well enough," he added. "You have to
play together a little bit to be good playing togeth
er. So that's going to come with each week."
Not letting up for a second, Stanford came out
in the third with a 6-1 lead, forcing the Dons to
commit multiple errors.The Dons shook it off and
came back to tie it at nine. Once more, Lichtman
and Klineman came out strong for the Card and
knocked down a couple of crucial kills to give
Stanford the 16-13 lead. The Cardinal finished it
