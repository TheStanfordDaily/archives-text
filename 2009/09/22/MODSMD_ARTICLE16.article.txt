## Card relies on running game gerhart ignites offense 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Since taking over the reins of Stanford football three
years ago, coach Jim Harbaugh has tried to cultivate a
hard-nosed aura around the program. Few players embody
the Cardinal's smash-mouth image more than senior Toby
Gerhart, the team's bruising running back, who often
leaves would-be tacklers tasting dirt.
It was puzzling, then, that Gerhart appeared to have a
lesser role two games ago against Wake Forest. He had his
fewest carries over an entire game since early October of
last year, including only five in the second half. The Cardi
nal instead tried to go through the air, and while redshirt
freshman quarterback Andrew Luck played very well over
the first two quarters, the offense stalled late in the game.
Gerhart never appeared to get into a groove after the
half, and Stanford's reliance on the pass, as well as untime
ly penalties, set up numerous 2nd and 3rd and long situa
tions that called more for an aerial attack than a ground of
fensive. Gerhart finished with less than 100 yards for the
first time in a game he played fully that is, without miss
ing time for injuries since facing TCU in hurricane con
ditions over a year ago.
"We were running the ball," Harbaugh said after the
Wake Forest game, "We didn't get as many yards as we
would have liked. We couldn't generate scoring drives in
the second half."
While Harbaugh was able to brush off questions about
utilizing the rushing game, they persisted throughout the
week. But they were quieted in short order against San
Jose State, as the Cardinal went to Gerhart early and often
and returned to a basic tenant of the program's resurgence:
Run the ball down the opponent's throat, and then do it
again.
"We got away from it last week in the second half. We
wanted to come back out and reestablish that," Gerhart
said.
