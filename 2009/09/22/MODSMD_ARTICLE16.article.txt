## Card relies on running game gerhart ignites offense 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Since taking over the reins of Stanford football three
years ago, coach Jim Harbaugh has tried to cultivate a
hard-nosed aura around the program. Few players embody
the Cardinal's smash-mouth image more than senior Toby
Gerhart, the team's bruising running back, who often
leaves would-be tacklers tasting dirt.
It was puzzling, then, that Gerhart appeared to have a
lesser role two games ago against Wake Forest. He had his
fewest carries over an entire game since early October of
last year, including only five in the second half. The Cardi
nal instead tried to go through the air, and while redshirt
freshman quarterback Andrew Luck played very well over
the first two quarters, the offense stalled late in the game.
Gerhart never appeared to get into a groove after the
half, and Stanford's reliance on the pass, as well as untime
ly penalties, set up numerous 2nd and 3rd and long situa
tions that called more for an aerial attack than a ground of
fensive. Gerhart finished with less than 100 yards for the
first time in a game he played fully that is, without miss
ing time for injuries since facing TCU in hurricane con
ditions over a year ago.
"We were running the ball," Harbaugh said after the
Wake Forest game, "We didn't get as many yards as we
would have liked. We couldn't generate scoring drives in
the second half."
While Harbaugh was able to brush off questions about
utilizing the rushing game, they persisted throughout the
week. But they were quieted in short order against San
Jose State, as the Cardinal went to Gerhart early and often
and returned to a basic tenant of the program's resurgence:
Run the ball down the opponent's throat, and then do it
again.
"We got away from it last week in the second half. We
wanted to come back out and reestablish that," Gerhart
said.
Stanford wasted no time: Nine of
the Cardinal's 11 plays on its opening
drive were runs, including seven by
Gerhart, who topped it off with a
three-yard touchdown scamper. Ju
nior Jeremy Stewart, another physi
cal back, picked up the rest, and the
crisp and relatively easy drive
seemed to bring the swagger back to
the Cardinal sideline.

With his backs running wild, Luck
had a quiet performance, attempting
only 12 passes before both he and
Gerhart were pulled from the game
in fourth quarter with a win well in
hand.

It was an admirable performance
by all involved. Junior fullback
Owen Marecic, as usual, welcomed
contact, and the offensive line, which
lost two starters to graduation last
season and left tackle Matt Kopa to
injury early in the year, had practical
ly no problem moving Spartan de
fenders. Senior Allen Smith, who saw
game action for the first time in two

years, got into it too, as he pancaked
his man on his first play
the sequence was emblematic of the
night.

For their part, the backs refused
to go down easily, as both Gerhart
and Stewart were able to brush off
arm tackles and rumble until multi
ple defenders converged on them.
Freshmen Stepfan Taylor and Tyler

Gaffney played most of the snaps in
the fourth quarter, and both runners,
strong in their own rights, averaged
about seven yards a carry apiece.
"This week in practice was about
pounding the rock, getting mean,
getting nasty," said Gerhart.
That isn't to say that all questions
regarding the run game were allevi
ated the Stanford backs com

bined to lose three fumbles, which
didn't exactly please the coach or the
players themselves. But the team set
out to, in Harbaugh's words, "estab
lish the run," and they did to the tune
of 214 yards on the ground.
Stanford will now have to face a
tough Washington squad. While the
No. 24 Huskies demonstrated good
pass coverage in their upset of No. 12

USC, their run defense left a lot to be
desired, as they gave up 250 yards
rushing to the Trojans.
With that in mind, when Washing
ton comes rolling into town this
weekend, it may once again be back
to basics for the Cardinal offense.

The Cardinal improved to 2-1 on the season with a whopping 42-17 rout of San Jose State last Saturday. Stanford, led by Toby Gerhart, returned to the
ground and showcased its powerful running game. Gerhart racked up 113 of the Cardinal's 211 total rushing yards. Up next for Stanford is No. 24
Washington. The Huskies, who share the Pac-10 lead with the Cardinal, are coming off a tremendous upset of the always-formidable Trojans of USC.
