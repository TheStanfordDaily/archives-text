That's just one of many words that
could currently describe the Stanford
women's field hockey team. With a 7-0
record, the Cardinal women stand
proudly at No. 14 in the nation, the
highest national ranking in school his
tory.

After winning seven consecutive
games to open the season, the team is

now tied for Stanford's best-ever start
to a season, with a similar 7-0 run oc
curring back in 1976. The Cardinal's
previous high mark in the rankings
was a No. 19 position two years ago.
Receiving national recognition
means a lot to this team, especially to
players who've been pulling their
weight for a long time, like senior de
fender Rachel Bush.

GAME NOTES: No. 14 Stanford has won its first seven

MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
The No. 14 Stanford field hockey team has stormed out of the gates, winning its first seven games and making a legitimate rise to
national championship contention. The Card faces Pacific on Friday forthe second time this season in a battle of ranked opponents.

the East Coast, so it's nice to get
some national recognition and send
a message to everyone that we're
good and we're ready to take on
anyone," Bush said. "Of course, it's
not going to be easy, but the team is
working really hard and we're very
close and connected, so we could
get through anything."

Now with some of the nation's
and the world's best players on
board, Stanford is starting to cata
pult itself into contention for the
national title. With nine returning
starters from the 2008 season, some
of whom have played on an interna
tional level, the Stanford women
are looking to once again win the
NorPac Tournament and perhaps
even a national title.

"This is only the beginning,"
Bush said.

Some top returners for the Car
dinal include seniors Nora Soza and
Midori Uehara, juniors Camille
Gandhi and Xanthe Travlos, and
sophomores Stephanie Byrne and
Alessandra Moss. At the beginning
of the summer, Gandhi was selected
to both the USA Field Hockey
Women's Developmental Team and
the USA Women's Junior World
Cup Team. Byrne was named 2008
NorPac Rookie of the Year after a
highly successful season that includ
ed being ranked second on the team
with six goals and 12 points.

Uehara was named the Offen
sive Player of the Week late last
September after scoring four goals
in a 7-0 win over Pacific. She was a
threat on the field in terms of scor
ing last season, leading team with 11
goals, 22 points and 26 shots. Soza,
the 2008 NorPac Tournament MVP,
will be back as one of the strongest

defenders in the conference. Moss, a
Second Team All-NorPac selectee,
will return as the strongest goalie
for the Cardinal, after having to
taled 111 saves last season.

So far this fall, several freshmen
have also had a chance to make
their mark on this highly experi
enced team. Freshmen Becky Dru
and Katie Mitchell both scored
their first collegiate goals in the
match against Kent State, while
freshman Kelsey Lloyd had her first
goal against VCU.
The latest victory for the women
was a 5-1 win against UC-Davis on
Sunday. Stanford was led by senior
Rachel Mozenter's hat trick.

Next up for the Cardinal is a
home match on Friday, Sept. 25 at 7
p.m. against Pacific. This will be the
second meeting between the teams
this season.
