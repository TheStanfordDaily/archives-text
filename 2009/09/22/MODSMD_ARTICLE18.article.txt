# Problems with the Polls
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
After a weekend of exciting
college football, of crazy
upsets and wild finishes,
the weekly polls some
times seem like a Browns-Lions
Monday Night Football game just
get it over with so we can move on to
more interesting things.
This year, the pollsters have not
followed suit, instead trying to create
their own drama, a la Steve Spurrier
"forgetting" about his former team
come polling time. Usually the two
main polls, the Associated Press poll
(the media) and the USA Today
Coaches poll (the coaches), mirror
each other almost identically, so see
ing both polls becomes redundant.
This year, though, the two groups
have more discrepancies than a Chi
nese gymnast's birth certificates.
After the top eight teams, which
are ranked nearly the same in both
polls, the first difference appears in
the form of the Miami Flurricanes.
Miami has played only two games so
far, and has won both over ranked
conference opponents, vaulting the
Hurricanes from an unranked and
unhyped preseason into the top tier
of college football. The coaches have
Miami ranked 13th, which is a con
siderable step up from being un
ranked before the start of the season.
The media, though, has rewarded
Miami even more for its two quality
wins, moving the Hurricanes all the
way to ninth and leapfrogging pre
season favorites Oklahoma, USC,
Virginia Tech and Ohio State all
of whom are sitting at 2-1 after losing
a close game to a ranked team in
the process.

Next, we have the Houston
Cougars. Yes, the very same Houston
Cougars who received exactly one
vote in each poll at the beginning of
the season. These same Houston
Cougars, who have played one team
in the Football Bowl Subdivision
(does anyone actually prefer this to
Division I-A?) this entire year, have
jumped to 23rd in the coaches' poll
and 17th in the media poll. 17th!
Granted, that game was an impres
sive road win over then-No. 5 Okla
homa State. But no matter how you
look at it, one game bumped Hous
ton from national obscurity to a
higher ranking than unbeaten Michi
gan.

It doesn't stop there. Florida State
is seven places higher (18th) in the
media poll than in the coaches' poll
(25th), which is nearly unheard of for
these kinds of rankings. You may be
saying to yourself, "Well, it's early in
the season, the pollsters just don't
have a big enough sample to come to
a unanimous conclusion." Besides
being impressed with how articulate
your discussions with yourself are, I
would have to reply with this: In the
preseason polls, before ANY games
had been played, no team's ranking
differed by more than two spots be
tween the two polls. So, clearly some
thing is going on here.

It seems to me that the coaches,
who probably spend ten seconds
finding out how teams did over the
weekend, stick to their original rank
ings much more closely and simply
move teams up a few spots for a good
win and down a few spots for a loss.
This makes sense to some extent, be
cause coaches place all possible
focus on their own teams and pay
about as much attention to the rank
ings as Pacman Jones does to the law.
The members of the media, how
ever, make a living by overhyping
teams and falling completely in love
with whoever becomes the number
one highlight on Sports Center. No
team proves this more than the
Washington Huskies. Let's go back a
week and a half in time. Seattle was
buzzing because the Huskies showed
small signs of life while they lost at
home to LSU, and Washington fans
were excited that their team could fi
nally win a game. Not a marquee
game, just a game. And the Huskies
did, ending their FBS-long 15-game
losing streak by beating lowly Idaho
at home, 42-23. All of sports fandom
felt warm fuzzies for Washington
after they finally won a game, even
though it was against an Idaho Van
dals team that has a dazzling record
of 3-21 over the past two seasons.
And it wasn't even a decisive victory,

as the Vandals outgained the
Huskies 412-374 and passed for a re
markable 349 against Washington's
defense.

Yet, the mood remained positive
before Washington's home game last
weekend against No. 3 USC, mostly
because the Huskies had finally won
a game and because Washington

head coach Steve Sarkisian would
get his first crack at his mentor, Tro
jans' head coach Pete Carroll. And
somehow, the combination of a
home crowd, several injuries to key
USC players, three crucial turnovers
and USC failing to convert on all 10
of its third downs led Washington to
the kingdom of Monumental Upset
land. No one will deny that it was a
huge win for a rebuilding program.

What is harder to come to terms
with, however, is how a team with
one quality win in three home games,
who was outgained in both its wins

and who went 0-12 last year, is
ranked 24th in the AP poll. This is
even more unbelievable considering
the coaches have Washington receiv
ing the 31st most votes.
Now, to be clear, I'm all for re
warding teams for big wins. But I find
it very hard to believe that Washing
ton is the 24th best team in the coun
try. I am certainly not the only one, as
the oddsmakers have Washington as
a nine-point underdog against Stan
ford (who, I might add, has not re
ceived a single vote in either poll at
any point this season). A ranked

team should never be a nine-point
underdog against a team like Stan
ford, and I do not think it is a stretch
for Stanford to beat Washington by
nine or more at home.

Something is wrong with these
polls, and I hope it gets fixed soon,
particularly because these rankings
affect not only Heisman voting, but
the very bowl games every team
shoots for.
