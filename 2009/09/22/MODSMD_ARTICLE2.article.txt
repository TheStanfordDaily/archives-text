## HOOVER SLASHES BUDGET Institution cuts $8 million, lets go of staff 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
At the same time that Hoover
Institution scholars are analyzing the
economic crisis and its policy respons
es, Hoover administrators are reacting
to their research center's own financial
pressures.
Budget cuts in the wake of an enor
mous drop-off in Stanford's endow
ment have spread across campus, and
Hoover in particular has faced a grave
budgetary situation. The research cen
ter relies for its funding upon two
budget sources, both heavily affected
by the recession: the Stanford endow
ment, which comprises 51 percent of
Hoover's funding, and expendable
donor gifts, which comprise 45 percent.
In response, the Institution has
made $8 million in reductions with the
intention of bringing its budget fully
into balance for fiscal year 2009-2010.
This reduction represents an almost 20
percent cut to the center's consolidat
ed revenues of $44.1 million.

Director John Raisian said
Hoover's reduced funding has forced
the administration to respond. He also
said a one-year adjustment was pre
ferred over a more gradual approach.
"If this outlook is right, to stretch
out the cuts will promote a long period
of deficits and stagnation," Raisian
said in an email to The Daily. "I believe
Hoover is better off becoming as good
as it can be at its new lower operating
budget, and position itself to compete
and grow as we recover."

Given the Institution's emphasis on
research, Raisian framed the aggres
sive budget cuts as a means to put the
center in the best possible position for
seeking out new scholars.
"By quickly reducing the operating
budget, one can now allocate the
expected modest growth in revenue as
we come out of the recession to imme
diately resuming the normal enhance
ment of scholarly talent," he said.

Cuts at Hoover have not been with
out layoffs. According to Hoover
Director of Finance Stephen Langlois,
roughly 15 to 20 staff positions were
eliminated, representing a reduction of
15 percent of employees. A smaller
number of positions have also been left

The Hoover Institution, facing decreased funding, axed its budget by $8 million this fiscal year
through cuts in staff, programming and archival expenses, among other sacrifices.
