## HOOVER SLASHES BUDGET Institution cuts $8 million, lets go of staff 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
At the same time that Hoover
Institution scholars are analyzing the
economic crisis and its policy respons
es, Hoover administrators are reacting
to their research center's own financial
pressures.
Budget cuts in the wake of an enor
mous drop-off in Stanford's endow
ment have spread across campus, and
Hoover in particular has faced a grave
budgetary situation. The research cen
ter relies for its funding upon two
budget sources, both heavily affected
by the recession: the Stanford endow
ment, which comprises 51 percent of
Hoover's funding, and expendable
donor gifts, which comprise 45 percent.
In response, the Institution has
made $8 million in reductions with the
intention of bringing its budget fully
into balance for fiscal year 2009-2010.
This reduction represents an almost 20
percent cut to the center's consolidat
ed revenues of $44.1 million.

Director John Raisian said
Hoover's reduced funding has forced
the administration to respond. He also
said a one-year adjustment was pre
ferred over a more gradual approach.
"If this outlook is right, to stretch
out the cuts will promote a long period
of deficits and stagnation," Raisian
said in an email to The Daily. "I believe
Hoover is better off becoming as good
as it can be at its new lower operating
budget, and position itself to compete
and grow as we recover."

Given the Institution's emphasis on
research, Raisian framed the aggres
sive budget cuts as a means to put the
center in the best possible position for
seeking out new scholars.
"By quickly reducing the operating
budget, one can now allocate the
expected modest growth in revenue as
we come out of the recession to imme
diately resuming the normal enhance
ment of scholarly talent," he said.

Cuts at Hoover have not been with
out layoffs. According to Hoover
Director of Finance Stephen Langlois,
roughly 15 to 20 staff positions were
eliminated, representing a reduction of
15 percent of employees. A smaller
number of positions have also been left

open. Raisian noted that the reduc
tions were made more difficult due
to a relative lack of growth in staff
positions over the past two decades.
"Hoover has not grown substan
tially in staff over the past two
decades, so we had to look at reduc
tions in both scholarly and staff per
sonnel," Raisian said.
Because personnel costs repre
sent 70 percent of Hoover's spend
ing, Langlois said the reductions
were necessary to conform to the
adjusted budget. "When you're

talking about the size of the cuts,
you have to cut the staff," he said.
In terms of managing the schol
ars and research fellows it funds,
Hoover does not face the restric
tions of other schools in that none
of the scholars hold tenure. Still,
Langlois said, multi-year contracts
and commitments pose a significant
hurdle in adjusting the Institution's
headcount and personnel expenses,
offering "less immediate flexibility."
Langlois noted, however, that
the Institution did enjoy relative
flexibility in areas like recruitment
compared to other parts of campus.
"Unlike other places that may have
a certain numbers of classes to
teach, we don't have a set number
of things we have to do," he said.

However, Raisian said Hoover
shared the challenges that now face
many other schools at Stanford in
looking ahead toward expanding a
personnel-centric institution.
"The key for all of us is more
revenue," Raisian said, "whether it
be new endowments or increased
support in the form of expendable
gifts, which will allow growth in
scholarly assets."
Langlois added that recruitment
would have to be "less aggressive."
For non-personnel expenses, cuts
at Hoover were focused on scaling
back programming, library and
archives acquisitions, working task
forces and the pace of archival
work. Hoover's archival staff will
draw upon a reserve for the time

being in the cases of high-profile
acquisitions.
Despite the cutbacks, no pro
grams or activities were eliminated
entirely.
"What we did was examine
every program and activity we were
doing here," Langlois said. "At the
end of the process, we ended up not
eliminating any programs. We
found out that we could pare
down."
Langlois said he found the over
all management of the crisis on a
University level effective. "There's
something to be said for calm heads
in a storm."
