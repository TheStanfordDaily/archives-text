# STUDENT HOUSING
## Housing assigns all 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
Student Housing has now placed all
remaining unassigned undergraduate
students with guaranteed housing into a
residence. The waiting list was cleared of
these students by the end of the first day
of classes, but still holds 18 additional
students with unguaranteed status.
Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney expressed
confidence that these remaining stu

"The bottom line is that I am opti

housing accommodation to any under

Housing is still waiting to confirm the
number of cancellations on campus, and
these cancellations could open up addi

in rounds can be assigned anywhere,
depending on where cancellations
occur," Whitney said. "We have placed
students in almost every residence and
many on the Row during the walk-in
rounds which have occurred so far this
year."

All co-ops were filled as a result of a
walk-in meeting held last week, but no
students who did not want to live in a
co-op were placed into a co-op.
Similarly, no undergraduates who did
not initially choose to live in Oak Creek
will have to live there, except for RA
staff assigned to support students
returning from studying abroad fall
quarter. According to Whitney, if Oak
Creek is offered as a walk-in option,
only students who request to live there
will be placed there.
