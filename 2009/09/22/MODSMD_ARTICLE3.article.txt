# STUDENT HOUSING
## Housing assigns all 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
Student Housing has now placed all
remaining unassigned undergraduate
students with guaranteed housing into a
residence. The waiting list was cleared of
these students by the end of the first day
of classes, but still holds 18 additional
students with unguaranteed status.
Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney expressed
confidence that these remaining stu
dents would be housed.
"The bottom line is that I am opti
mistic we will be able to offer some
housing accommodation to any under
graduate who requested it guaran
teed or unguaranteed by the middle
to end of this week," Whitney said in an
email to The Daily. "These will be pri
marily on campus, but there could also
be a few spaces offered at Oak Creek
[Apartments]."
According to Whitney, all undergrad
uate students who received housing
accommodations through the regular
Draw process or through the walk-in
meetings over the summer have been
placed in residences on campus. Several
of the 18 undergraduates without hous

ing were offered various spaces around
campus, but did not accept the assign
ments.
Housing is still waiting to confirm the
number of cancellations on campus, and
these cancellations could open up addi
tional spots for students.
"Students assigned during the walk
in rounds can be assigned anywhere,
depending on where cancellations
occur," Whitney said. "We have placed
students in almost every residence and
many on the Row during the walk-in
rounds which have occurred so far this
year."

All co-ops were filled as a result of a
walk-in meeting held last week, but no
students who did not want to live in a
co-op were placed into a co-op.
Similarly, no undergraduates who did
not initially choose to live in Oak Creek
will have to live there, except for RA
staff assigned to support students
returning from studying abroad fall
quarter. According to Whitney, if Oak
Creek is offered as a walk-in option,
only students who request to live there
will be placed there.
"Once we have verified all of the can-
cellations or no-shows, we may con
sider offering Oak Creek to any
remaining unguaranteed students
who still need housing, but this may
not be necessary," Whitney said.
Students received housing off of
the waiting list based on cancella
tions and no-shows. The final offi
cial day to move into an on-campus
residence was Saturday, Sept. 19.
The Big Picture
After the un-stuffing process
implemented by Housing last year,
there were a total of 6,215 spaces
available this fall quarter for under
graduate students. The Housing
Plan added an additional 50 spaces
to campus through the opening of
Crothers and other changes, while
there are 75 more students living on
campus this year compared to last.
"We have also seen fewer can
cellations this year than in the past,
so we believe students are generally
more pleased with their housing
assignments as a result of the
uncrowding in the system, the num
ber of desirable premier spaces
offered and the diversity of choices
and living options," Whitney said.
Since the results of the Draw
were announced in May, only 66
students requested residence reas
signment, showing a 55 percent
decrease in reassignment requests.
Student Housing has also come
closer to being able to fully house
all graduate students who applied
for housing, thanks to the new
Munger Graduate Residence,
which will house 400 graduate stu
dents this year.
