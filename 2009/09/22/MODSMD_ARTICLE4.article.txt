## Univ. gifted program on Arab studies CDDRL receives grant to open program focusing on Middle East 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
With the recent establishment of a
Program of Good Governance and
Political Reform in the Arab World,
Stanford has been placed on the map for
contemporary Middle East studies.
The Freeman Spogli Institute's Center
on Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law (CDDRL) recently
announced the establishment of the pro

gram, which comes as a gift from the
Foundation for Reform and Development
in the Middle East (FDRDME).
"The pledge of it came a few months
ago, and we received the gift a few
weeks ago," said CDDRL Director
Larry Diamond, who will supervise the
program. "It emerged as a result of a
conversation that we had with the foun
dation out of mutual interest that they
had and we had regarding a new gener
ation of work being done in democratic
reform in the Arab world."
Having the funding in place now
allows the program to move forward
with specific activities.
"We're working to hire a full-time
scholar-manager," Diamond said.
"After we do, then we can move
onto more concrete program devel
opment."

Diamond expects the program
will sponsor visiting scholars at
CDDRL, coordinate seminars and
events promoting education of the
Arab world, and conduct research.
Diamond also stressed the aim of
bringing together scholars and
experts from Arab countries and
Western scholars.
"We want to advise understand
ing of conditions in specific coun
tries undergoing democratic
change," Diamond said. "We want
to build a network of scholars and
thinkers and practitioners from the
region, who are working in region,
who are thinking about those issues,
and link them up with scholars at
Stanford and elsewhere in the U.S.
Our goal is to foster better under
standing of economic, social, politi
cal and strategic conditions in the
region that are either obstructing

political reform or instead helping
to catalyze it.
"We'll want to be collaborating
with institutions in the U.S. and
institutions in the Arab world," he
added.

Stanford joins a group of
American universities and institu
tions who, in the wake of the Middle
East's increased relevance to
American affairs, are focusing more
on Middle East studies and forming
relationships with universities in the
region. Numerous American univer
sities are putting an increased focus
upon such studies, and others are
actually setting up shop in the
Middle East Carnegie Mellon
opened a campus in Doha, Qatar in
2004, and New York University is set
to open a campus in the United
Arab Emirates in 2010.

Along with Diamond, CDDRL
Deputy Director Kathryn Stoner-
Weiss, FDRDME Director Olivier
Roy, CDDRL visiting scholar from
Morocco Hicham Ben Abdallah
and soon-to-be CDDRL postdoc
toral fellow Sean Yom will also par
ticipate in the new program.
