## Suicides prompt awareness alliance Local professionals respond to the recent deaths 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
In the aftermath of three teenage
suicide deaths in Palo Alto in the past
five months, health care professionals
in Silicon Valley have formed an
alliance to raise awareness of mental
health disorders and make treatment
more accessible.
Parents, peers, doctors and teachers
were all shocked by the events of recent
months, when three teenagers took their
own lives by stepping in front of oncom-

ing trains.
"I think the death by suicide that
we've had recently in this community

have caused us to look at ourselves as a
community not just the schools, but
how we view mental health issues and
how prepared we are to deal with mental
health issues for our kids," said Wesley
Cedros, the school psychologist at Palo
Alto High School. "It has provided a call
to action for this community."
A group of child psychiatrists, non
profit agencies and school psychologists
responded to this call by forming the
Health Care Alliance for Response to
Adolescent Depression (HEARD).
Their main goal, Cedros said, is to pre
vent crisis situations and intervene early
enough to ensure the crisis stage is never
reached.
Shashank Joshi, an assistant professor
of psychiatry and a psychiatrist in the
Division of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry at Lucile Packard who is
involved in the alliance, said the group
will take a variety of steps. According to

Joshi, the alliance will try to increase
awareness of mental health disorders,
decrease the stigmas surrounding them
and increase the portals of access for
treatment.
Though HEARD began with a plan
ning meeting after the second suicide
death, it took off with the help of a grant
from the Stanford Medical Center.
"It's a sort of voluntary coming
together of health care organizations ...
and educational professionals who are
moved by recent events and want to
think together about what we can do to
enhance the community response to
depressed adolescents," said Frances
Wren, director of the Child and
Adolescent Depression Clinic at Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital.
By the first working meeting on Sept.
9, approximately 40 professionals repre-

senting over 20 health care and edu
cational agencies were involved.
"We're there, as caretakers of
kids during the day, to gather ideas
and input from all the other commu
nity resources that we have, to see
what we can do collectively for kids
in the area," Cedros said.
The various professionals are
divided into working groups with dif
ferent goals for identifying and treat
ing depressed teenagers. The mental
health system group was charged
with reducing barriers to care so stu
dents can be seen and evaluated
more quickly. Many community clin
ics have opened availability regard
less of insurance, while some private
practitioners offer therapy slots at
reduced fees, Joshi said.
Aside from educating adults,
HEARD will also target youth
awareness.

"The reality is, for adolescents,
the majority of their support comes
from their peers," Joshi said. "We
have to find away to access that sup

port network to be able to really
help build the safety net that
includes peers, while not burdening
the peers with feeling overly respon
sible,"

The alliance is also looking at
models such as anonymous tip lines
or Web sites at each school, or even
screening the Internet for words like
suicide, Joshi said. By educating stu
dents about warning signs and pro
viding safe ways to come forward, he
hopes students are empowered to
engage in what he called "support
ive snitching."
For students, teachers and admin
istrators, life on local high school
campuses has changed during the
grieving process, Cedros said. But he
hopes the concern of teachers,
administration and the school dis
trict can have a positive effect.
"I think it's caused everyone to
really take stock of what kids are
seeing and feeling and thinking, and
to take action like we're taking with
HEARD," Cedros said. "If we're
able to get kids identified and to the
services they need, I think we will
have fewer tragedies."
