## Fluteu Maximu The
						Flute Choir lands a spot at the largest flute convention in history 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
For the Stanford Flute Ensemble (SFE), summer
2009 is one for the books literally.
Eight members of the 12-member flute choir ven
tured to the Big Apple to participate in the 37th annu
al flute convention, hosted by the National Flute
Association (NFA). In addition to national recognition,
the group also helped to break a world record.
"We've done quarterly concerts in Campbell Hall,
we've participated in some other functions on campus
and we've performed in schools and other local things,"
said Karen Van Dyke, SFE's director. "But we've never
done anything this high-profile. It put us on the map,
nationally and even internationally, [and] will get the
group and the Stanford music department a lot of
recognition."
The four-day convention, held Aug. 13-16, was a red
carpet affair of sorts for the creme de la creme of the
global flute community. Considered the foremost flute
networking and educational event, it gave those invited
a chance to attend classes, workshops, clinics and con
certs, as well as become part of the successful attempt to
break the Guinness World Record, of course.
A total of 1,989 flutists, crowded into a ballroom in
the Marriott Marquis Hotel, played the "Galway
Fantasie," a medley of folk tunes arranged specifically
for the Guinness tour de flute, under the direction of
influential flutist Sir James Galway. The assembled
group achieved a narrow overthrow of the previous
record for largest flute ensemble, held by China at
1,975.
Playing for the Guinness event, which was held at 9
a.m. Eastern Time, was an optional addendum to the

program for the convention attendees. Those who vol
unteered were assigned parts according to their last
name prior to their arrival in New York City to allow
them to practice, and a brief rehearsal was also held just
before the Aug. 14 feat.

"I think the most incredible part was just seeing that
many flutists in one room," said Alissa Bell M.S. 'O9 in
an email to The Daily. "Honestly, I was expecting it to
run much less smoothly than it did. The music seemed
fast and intricate enough that I was not expecting
roughly 2,000 flutists to be able to play it together."
As smoothly as the world-record event went, getting
into the invite-only convention didn't prove as easy.

"It's very competitive," Van Dyke said of the event.
"Individual flutists come from all over the world, [but]
flute choirs coming from even across the country is very
unusual."
In fact, the SFE, none of whom is a music major, sent
their audition tape nearly a year in advance before they
were chosen along with 10 other choirs among over 40
applicants.
Afterward, the eight SFE flutists, consisting of recent
alumni, undergraduate and graduate students and a
professional flutist, spent five weeks in rehearsal
preparing for the convention.
But it was not to break a world record or to play in
the opening ceremony of a gala to honor Sir Galway,
NFA's lifetime award recipient. Or even for the Fox and
NPR coverage during the event.
"The main reason we went to New York was to give
our performance," Van Dyke said. "That was what all
those weeks of preparation were for.
"I was nervous," she added. "There were just thou
sands of fantastic flutists, who hold very high standards
for themselves and for each other. The worst audience
you can play for, we say as flutists, is a room full of other
flute players."
Indeed, Bell appeared to have felt the same way as
her conductor, but became too overwhelmed with
excitement to let the nerves fully sink in.
"We had prepared well, so by the time we got to the
convention, I was in the mood to just relax and enjoy
it," she said.
While this was the first time the SFE applied to
attend the NFA convention, the inspiration that Van
Dyke and her students have drawn from the event has
in no way left them hard-pressed to stop there. There is
unanimous motivation to continue the trend, and talk
of imminent plans to vie for the next golden ticket to
the 2010 convention in Anaheim, Calif.

Stanford's Flute Ensemble struck all the right notes at the National Flute Association's four-day convention in New York City. A record-setting number of flutists from across
the country performed flutist Sir James Galway's "Galway Fantasie" together at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, dethroning the Chinese, who held the previous record.
