## Study finds that literacy is here to stay 
### AMY HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
The Internet: where literacy goes to
die, right? Wrong, found Andrea
Lunsford, director of the Program
in Writing and Rhetoric. That
question kicked off the Stanford
Study of Writing, a five-year longitudinal
study which began in the fall of 2001 and
chronicled the writing of 189 students
roughly 12 percent of the freshman class
as they made their way through college and
one year beyond.
Lunsford spearheaded the project, which
piggybacked off of an earlier Harvard study
done in the late 19905, but broadened the
scope to create an expansive road map of
where and what Stanford students write. It's
the largest study of its kind to date.
Selected students submitted all of their
academic writing plus any of their extracur
ricular writing from poetry slams to email
messages to problem sets to Lunsford and
her team, who then scoured the samples. By
2006, the researchers had collected a cache of
15,000 pieces of writing. To writing scholars,
the mere scope of the data was hitting the
jackpot. But what Lunsford unearthed broke
new ground.
Contrary to what many opining cultural
critics say, our generation is in a writing
explosion. Technology is giving us the oppor
tunity to write more than ever before,
Lunsford found, and we're using it.
Of the 15,000 pieces of writing accumulat
ed, Lunsford found that 38 percent of it was
out-of-the-classroom writing what she
calls "life writing." The age of the letter may
be dead, but the online era is upon us. We've
got bloviating bloggers, fanatic Facebookers
and tenacious Twitter-ers. But what is it
exactly that we write?

What We Write
Gertrude Stein said she writes for herself
and strangers. Stanford students, it turns out,
do too but they're most often trying to get
their audiences to do something. Students
across the board of the study defined good
prose as something that has an effect on the
world.

"It's now possible to not just state an opin
ion, but actually get something done in the
real world," said Mark Otuteye 'O5, the
study's most frequent participant, who sub
mitted 700 pieces of writing. "A generation
ago, you would write in your diary and no
one would ever see it. Now, you can write on
your blog and thousands see it. If you post
sometime on Yelp, that actually has an
impact."
Otuteye has always been fascinated by the
English language. As a freshman, he co
founded the Stanford Spoken Word
Collective, trying to break down the barriers
between performance and writing with his
unique brand of poetry slam. But that inter
section, many critics say, is perverting the lan
guage and could herald the end of writing as
we know it.

The GrB DbB
So, just because we're writing more, is our
generation actually writing better?
Yes, the study found.
Marvin Diogenes, associate director of
PWR, said our generation grasps the Greek
concept of kairos, where we tailor our writing
technique and tone to our particular audi
ence. The study found that students now are
much more aware of their audience, whether
it be their professor or their Facebook
friends, which is rhetorically valuable.
"When you're writing for a class, you're
writing in response to an assignment,"
Diogenes said. "Students grasp academic
writing, but out-of-class writing comes out of
the students need for expression. Forms of
lyrics, spoken word poetry, work that's done
for a cause are where students really write
and target their audience. The study con
firmed that writing is not limited to the class
room it's everywhere,"
"During my grandparents' era, writing
was the ability to sign documents and make
things official," explained Lunsford. "There
was some expressive writing, but it was more
functional than anything else. That's different
now. People are aware of their audience and
writing to make things happen."
This development is a counterpunch to
the many critics who say the generation that
coined the term 'bootylicious' is ruining the
English language and destroying the art of
writing. Turns out, though, that tweeting and
