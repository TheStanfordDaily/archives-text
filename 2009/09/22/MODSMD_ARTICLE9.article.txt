## Prof. Hecker wins Enrico Fermi Award 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Management Science and
Engineering Prof. Siegfried Hecker
has received the presidential Enrico
Fermi Award, the Department of
Energy announced last week.
Hecker will share the award with
John Bannister Goodenough, an
engineering professor at the
University of Texas-Austin.
The award, one of the nation's
most prestigious, is awarded by the
DOE on behalf of the White House
to scholars in science and technolo
gy. In a statement, Energy Secretary
Steven Chu called Hecker and
Goodenough "pioneers in innova
tive research."

"[They] have selflessly devoted
themselves to our nation's energy
and national security challenges,"
Chu said.

Hecker, 65, is a senior fellow at
Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute
and co-director of the Center for
International Security and
Cooperation.
His noted career includes having
resolved a long-standing controver
sy between researchers in the U.S.
and the then-USSR involving the
stability of certain structures in plu
tonium alloys.

Hecker was also one of the lead
architects of the science-based
stockpile stewardship approach, still
used to certify the safety of
America's nuclear deterrent.
He directed the nation's Los
Alamos National Laboratory from
1986 to 1997.

The award includes a $375,000
honorarium, which the two will
share equally, and a gold medal.
