# GET IT RIGHT

£ £ bama is Hitler!" said the signs of
I la few Palo Alto Safeway shop-
Vy pers. Yes, last week the local
community of radical conservatives congre
gated outside our neighborhood Safeway to
denounce our President, and especially his
push for a national healthcare plan.
My companions were enraged by the ac
cusations and alarmist protestations. "How,"
asked these Stanford students, "can a specta
cle like this occur in our community? It's
hateful! It's disgusting ... It's racist!"
Hold it! I listened passively to the tirade
until that last remark was uttered. I concede
that pronouncing Obama to be Hitler rein
carnated may be a bit hysterical, but I don't
see a racial connection. I told them as much:
"But surely race is irrelevant here. The com
parison is intended to point out the similari
ties between nationalized healthcare and the
national socialism of Nazi Germany? Per
haps to Obama's ability to stimulate the
youth of the nation?"
Shaking their heads at my naivete, my
companions informed me that conservatives
are launching a desperate attempt to prevent
any political discussion —in other words,
they do not care about the content of the
healthcare plan at all; they are merely at
tempting to roadblock a liberal movement.
Apparently, this hearkens back to the "anti
desegregation movement" and is thus racist.
I remain skeptical. It is, of course, easy to
disregard political turmoil as the lunatic ram
blings of a political party unwilling to change.
Unfortunately, it is not so simple, my friends.
It is merely a strategy to draw attention away

from the debate at hand. Conservatives have
legitimate concerns of the proposed health
care plan, and while labeling Obama's
healthcare as socialism may be exaggeration,
it serves a symbolic purpose to outline their
complaints. The Nazi Party was gung-ho for
nationalized healthcare (for far more insidi
ous purposes, mind you), and verbalizing the
fact, though politically charged, falls well
within the bounds of free speech. Free
speech, in fact, is only limited by the "harm

principle," I personally can't see how the
comparison causes direct harm to any party.
A bit of violence, though, has erupted
around the German socialist comparison: A
young Jewish girl recently assaulted a health
care protester holding one of these contro
versial signs. The girl claimed that such para
phernalia is a disgusting insult to members of
the Jewish community who suffered from
Hitler's actions.

This argument loses me as well. I have the
utmost sympathy and respect for these com
munities, but the healthcare protesters are in
no way condoning or underscoring the suf
fering and terror inflicted by the Third Reich.
They are expressing concern (perhaps legiti
mate, perhaps not) that a similar socialism
could be inflicted in America. Whether you
agree or not, the right to free speech allows
this comparison. Assault, to my knowledge,
however, remains illegal.
Consider the fact that Presidents Reagan,
H.W. Bush, Clinton and W. Bush have ALL
been likened to Hitler at some point during
their respective presidencies. The compari
son in each case has served to express dismay
and mistrust of a presidential policy. The stig
ma of Nazism has been used by liberals and
conservatives alike to express fear and con
cern for the actions taken by the most power
ful figure in our government. This is not a
new phenomenon, and has never been con
sidered racist or slanderous in past history.
For instance: A post to Democratic Unde
rground.com in 2004 let loose the following:
"[Hitler] did not ignite the horrors of the
Holocaust until he had corruptly obtained

the political power to do so. It was the man
ner in which he attained this power that is
analogous to the political machinations of
the Bush dictatorship." Did the public cry out
to denounce this comparison? I think not.
Consider, too, the official White House
Web site asking for informants on anti
healthcare advocates: "There is a lot of disin
formation about health insurance reform out
there, spanning from control of personal fi
nances to end of life care. These rumors often
travel just below the surface via chain emails
or through casual conversation. Since we
can't keep track of all of them here at the
White House, we're asking for your help. If
you get an email or see something on the

[Web] about health insurance reform that
seems fishy, send it to flag@whitehouse.gov."
This sounds suspiciously like an attempt to si
lence healthcare dissent to me.
Whether you advocate Obama's health
care plan or not, I maintain that healthy de
bate should be allowed to stimulate thought
and discussion, and must be allowed, as guar
anteed by the laws of free speech.
Think it over the next time you feel the
urge to silence your neighbor. Save cries of
"racism" and "slander" for more applicable
situations.
