## National Marriage Boycott nabs $10K prize 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Sophomore Kenzie Seal woke up
to the sound of a text message one
late summer morning. It was his
friend, offering congratulations for
his win of $lO,OOO for his organiza
tion, National Marriage Boycott.
"I was like, 'Congratulations for
what?'" said Seal, the group's chief
financial officer.
The news came after a month
long drive for votes on the idea-shar
ing Web site Ideablob.com, where
members submit ideas and vote on a
$lO,OOO winner each month.
After receiving more than 1,000
votes in a nine-day final push. Seal
won the August prize for best idea,
beating out seven other finalists for
the top spot. Members praised the
concept of the boycott, which asks
pledges to wear an equality band
and forego marriage until same-sex
marriage is legalized on a federal
level.

Now, Seal said, National
Marriage Boycott (NMB) can move
beyond fundraising to help other
schools start chapters. "This seemed
like too good of an opportunity to
pass up," he said. "For almost 24
hours a day we had people working
on this."

A group of Stanford students, led
by Laura Wadden *O9 and Amanda

Gelender 'lO, originally began NMB
in response to the passage of
Proposition 8 last November.
Rather than limiting their scope to
Stanford or California, the original
founders set their targets on repeal
ing the federal Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA).
Over the summer, NMB mem
bers continued to reach out to other
schools and raise awareness for their
cause.
"What we're doing right now is
really focusing on building our
team," said Wadden, NMB's execu
tive director. "With this type of
work, it's important to be building a
foundation."
They say their work, though still
unfinished, seems to have paid off.
While less than a year old, NMB
has added branches in more than 20
colleges and high schools spanning
the nation, according to Chief
Operations and National
Recruitment Officer Sarah
Masimore 'll.

"Since school just started, most
of the branches are in the planning
stages," she said. "The majority have
had their first organizational meet
ings, have recruited leadership and
are now fundraising for their first
bulk order of equality rings."
Chapters buy the black equality
rings from the Stanford headquar
ters and then recruit pledges within

their own localities. Rings are also
sold via the NMB Web site.
"The really exciting thing about
this is that though we are financially
sustainable based on ring sales, we
have the $lO,OOO and we can help
other branches start up," Wadden
said.
In order to better assist the vari
ous branches, Wadden and others
have also written "The Boycotter's
Cookbook," a set-up and operation
manual available online for interest
ed partner schools.
Masimore counts such branches

as Columbia University and Utah's
Dixie Fligh School as some of their
most promising affiliates.
Students at Dixie plan to stage a
walk-out later this year to petition
their administration a conserva
tive one, they say â€”to recognize
their group. Columbia Queer
Alliance has already formed a
strong executive team to head up
their New York chapter.
NMB executives hope to take
advantage of this enthusiasm and
growing network of affiliates in the
coming year. Along with staffing the
Stanford NMB group, Wadden will
focus on spreading the word at other
marriage equality events, particular
ly the upcoming National Equality
March in Washington, D.C.
So far, the group has also
received support from the social
entrepreneurship site Change.org
and the networking site Ning.com.
But for the present, Seal is just
waiting for his $lO,OOO prize to
arrive in the mail. Ideablob's verifi
cation process included a back
ground check of Seal and an
enforced two-week silence on the
results of the competition.
"[The prize] is being delivered by
check," he said. "Hopefully, it's huge
and hokey."
