## Traffic project gets green light from city 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The Palo Alto City Council on
Sept. 14 unanimously green-lit plans
to install a traffic signal where
Embarcadero Road meets the Town
and Country Shopping Center.
The area is a major traffic thor
oughfare during Stanford sporting
events, including home football
games, six of which remain this year.

The traffic signal is a mandatory
condition of the city's approval of the
Trader Joe's development in progress
at Town and Country.
The developer will foot the bill for
up to $225,000 of the $248,269
required for the project, which was
contracted to W. Bradley Electric,
Inc., according to city planning docu
ments.

The pedestrian signal for the
crosswalk to Palo Alto High School,
which is located across the shopping
center, is also to be modified under
the plan's mandate.
City staff could not immediately
say when the traffic signal project is
expected to begin nor how long it will
take.
