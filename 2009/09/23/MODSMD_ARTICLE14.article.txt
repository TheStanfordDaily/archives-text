## LATE SHOW Stanford improves to 4-1-0 on OT goal 
### CHRIS FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's soccer is officially back in
top form. The team, which finished the 2008
season with only four wins, equaled that
number with a 1-0 victory over San Francis
co on Sunday evening.

USF (2-3-0) dueled the Card (4-1-0)
evenly through regulation, until Stanford
junior Cameron Lamming took matters
into his own hands. Lamming tucked a laser
beam shot underneath the crossbar after
beating half a dozen defenders for the unas
sisted score 92 minutes into the match.

"I wasn't sure I was going to shoot it,"
Lamming explained. "I just looked through
the hole and took it."

For his timely first goal of the season.
Lamming earned Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Week honors. The goal capped
a perfect 2-0 weekend for Stanford in which
the team outscored opponents 3-0, includ
ing a 2-0 shutout of Santa Clara at Buck
Shaw Stadium on Friday.

Stanford's win Friday was its second
road victory this season, as junior Do
minique Yahyavi and senior Evan Morgan
combined for the scores in Santa Clara. The
tandem victories catapulted the Cardinal to
new heights.

Stanford Plead Coach Bret Simon is
pleased with the direction in which his team
is headed. "Winning two games against your
rivals is a great way to kick off the first week
of school," he said.

Stanford posted a dozen shots in regula
tion on Sunday just one more than their
opponents but the only shot of overtime
found a home in the net. At the time, the

Dons were ranked No. 18 in the nation.
Since suffering a 0-2 week, they have fallen
out of the national picture.
Could the Cardinal replace USF? Stan
ford remains unranked, but should be
knocking on the door at 4-1-0 and a win over
a ranked opponent.
Simon said the Sunday match was no or
dinary contest. "USF is not only a good
team, but also a rival," he said. "Because of
that, it's always going to be a tough game."
Stanford held the Dons' ace-in-the-hole
at bay. Senior Conor Chinn, the reigning
