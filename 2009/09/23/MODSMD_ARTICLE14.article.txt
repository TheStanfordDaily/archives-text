## LATE SHOW Stanford improves to 4-1-0 on OT goal 
### CHRIS FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's soccer is officially back in
top form. The team, which finished the 2008
season with only four wins, equaled that
number with a 1-0 victory over San Francis
co on Sunday evening.

USF (2-3-0) dueled the Card (4-1-0)
evenly through regulation, until Stanford
junior Cameron Lamming took matters
into his own hands. Lamming tucked a laser
beam shot underneath the crossbar after
beating half a dozen defenders for the unas
sisted score 92 minutes into the match.

"I wasn't sure I was going to shoot it,"
Lamming explained. "I just looked through
the hole and took it."

For his timely first goal of the season.
Lamming earned Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Week honors. The goal capped
a perfect 2-0 weekend for Stanford in which
the team outscored opponents 3-0, includ
ing a 2-0 shutout of Santa Clara at Buck
Shaw Stadium on Friday.

Stanford's win Friday was its second
road victory this season, as junior Do
minique Yahyavi and senior Evan Morgan
combined for the scores in Santa Clara. The
tandem victories catapulted the Cardinal to
new heights.

Stanford Plead Coach Bret Simon is
pleased with the direction in which his team
is headed. "Winning two games against your
rivals is a great way to kick off the first week
of school," he said.

Stanford posted a dozen shots in regula
tion on Sunday just one more than their
opponents but the only shot of overtime
found a home in the net. At the time, the

Dons were ranked No. 18 in the nation.
Since suffering a 0-2 week, they have fallen
out of the national picture.
Could the Cardinal replace USF? Stan
ford remains unranked, but should be
knocking on the door at 4-1-0 and a win over
a ranked opponent.
Simon said the Sunday match was no or
dinary contest. "USF is not only a good
team, but also a rival," he said. "Because of
that, it's always going to be a tough game."
Stanford held the Dons' ace-in-the-hole
at bay. Senior Conor Chinn, the reigning

GAME NOTES ! The men's soccer team will round out its
non-conference schedule for the season this week
end, as it prepares to host Air Force and New Mexico
at Cagan Stadium on Friday and Sunday, respective
ly. The Cardinal has gone 4-1 -0 to start the year, al
ready equaling its total number of victories from the
entire 2008 season. Stanford hopes to continue its
fine defensive form this weekend, as goalkeeper John
Moore has recorded three shutouts in the opening
five matches.

Freshman midfielder Dersu Abolfathi beats a San Francisco defender during Stanford's 1 - 0
victory over the Dons on Sunday. The Cardinal has started the season with a 4- 1 -0 record.
West Coast Conference Player of
the Year, scored 14 goals and had 35
points for USF last year, but strug
gled to pull the trigger at an oppor
tune time on Sunday. None of his
four shots was on the frame.
Senior John Moore notched his
third shutout of the season in net.
Simon noted the value of his keeper.
"[Moore] was absolutely a rock
in net," Simon elaborated. "I
thought overall, we played a good
match, but made a few mistakes in
the back and John had to come up
big."

The Card has come to expect
such performances from Moore, In
five matches, Stanford has allowed
less than a goal per contest on aver
age, Much of the credit goes to the
Cardinal's back line. Freshman
Hunter Gorskie hooked up with
junior Bobby Warshaw and senior
T.J. Novak to aid the shutout effort.

Winners of four games straight,
Stanford's last loss came on Sept. 1.
Conversely, the Dons dropped their

third consecutive match USF last
won on Sept. 5.
Still, Simon anticipates a repeat
encounter. "At the end of the sea
son, I expect [the Dons] will be a
tournament team again," he said.

The Cardinal's first overtime vic
tory is also its first against a ranked
opponent. The differences between
this year's team and last year's are
stark.

The 2008 Stanford squad had
managed just four goals by their
sixth game and finished the season
with a 0.78 goals-per-game mark.
The current crew posted goal num
ber nine with Lamming's game-win
ner, lowering their average goals per
game to 1.80.
Lamming expressed his team's
success with satisfaction. "We've
gone after each team and given 110
percent," he said. "Everything
seems to be clicking."

Stanford looks to build on a four
match win streak against Air Force
(3-1-1) from Laird Q. Cagan Stadi
um at 7 p.m. this Friday. The match
will be part of the Stanford Nike
Classic, hosted by Stanford.
