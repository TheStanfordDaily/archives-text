# FRESH PERSPECTIVE
## Benjamin adjusting to Division One volleyball

Stanford women's volleyball is deeply entwined with these
three words as the team has continued to make a name for itself
in NCAA playoffs. The equation for its successful seasons is
simple: hardworking players and skilled coaches who put in the
effort.
Though a rookie to D-I volleyball, freshman libero and de
fensive specialist Hannah Benjamin is no newcomer to volley
ball. With USA Junior National Team training under her belt,
Benjamin comes to Stanford with much experience. She also
appeared in the Junior Olympics in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Her
Encinitas Wave Volleyball and Coast Volleyball club teams
gave her a taste of the fast-paced D-I world.
To top off her high school days, a state championship with
current teammate Cassidy Litchman in 2005 remains one of
her fondest memories of volleyball. However, D-I tops club
and high school pace any day.

"Not only are the girls hitting the ball harder," Benjamin

said, "but you also have to learn to react to things more quick
ly because every point counts when the competition is always
strong."

While adjusting to a more intense level of volleyball may be
a challenge, Benjamin counts on her close-knit team and sup
portive coaches to teach her the ins and outs of college ball.
"One of the most helpful ways that my coaches have facili
tated the transition is by exposing me to the game," Benjamin
said. "In our first tournament, all three healthy freshmen
played. It forced us to step up to the challenge of a faster
paced game and helped build our confidence."
Benjamin's coaches have instilled confidence in her by
throwing her into the deep end and she seems to have taken a
piece of her teammates' attitudes as well: boldness.
"I have learned from our other liberos and defensive spe
cialists to play with no fear," she said. "I look up to all three of
these girls and really respect their fearlessness and gumption."
Benjamin looks to carry this "No Fear" attitude through
her volleyball career at Stanford. Each minute of playing time
is a piece of the large impact she hopes to make here.
"My goal for this season is to make a difference every time
I step on the court," she said. "As a defensive specialist, who
only has limited time on the court, making sure to play as hard
as I can all the time is very important."
And though Benjamin makes an impact on the court, she
also makes an impression on her teammates. Literally. This

freshman is especially famous
among teammates for her gestures
during a game of Catch Phrase.
"Several girls on the team love
the show 'The Office' and they are
constantly reciting lines. One of
these lines is 'Boom . . . ROAST

ED!' so we all know the line even if
we don't follow 'The Office,' When
Alix [Klineman] said the word
'Boom' as a hint, the whole team
proceeded to yell 'Roasted!'" Ben
jamin said of her favorite Catch
Phrase moment.

Among the many adjustments
Benjamin has had to make this
year, moving away from her
biggest fans definitely ranks as the
hardest.

"I am very close to my mom, dad

and sister, so it is hard not seeing
them every night. I also really miss
my dad's gourmet home cooking,"
said the freshman. "They have driv
en me to be my best, lifted me
through tough times and given me
the best pep talks. It is hard to put
my thanks into words because I
would not be where I am today
without them."
