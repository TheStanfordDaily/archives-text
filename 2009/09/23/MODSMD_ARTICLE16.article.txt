# Football frosh are ready to play

Jim Harbaugh likes to play
freshmen, and doesn't feel a
need to justify doing so.
"The burn shirt thing I don't
know what that's about. Freshmen
are eligible to play," the third-year
coach said quizzically after Satur
day's rout of San Jose State.
The "shirt" Harbaugh refers to is
the valued redshirt, which allows a
player to gain an extra year of eligi

but as other coaches hesitate to
throw their youngsters into the
gauntlet, if Harbaugh deems you
ready to play, you're getting on the

"Football players get better by
playing football," he said.
And football teams benefit from
better football players, and be it
through using people two-ways or
switching their positions entirely,
Harbaugh has a knack for tweaking
his roster to optimize it to his liking.
Playing freshman fits this trend.
But while Marecic and Amajoyi
were starters in their first season, and
Owusu and Howell tallied serious
playing time in theirs, the 2009 fresh
men have mainly been seen on spe
cial teams and mop-up duties. There
is something to be said for taking a
redshirt year Harbaugh certainly
knows this, as evidenced by his han
dling of Luck last season. But, if their
