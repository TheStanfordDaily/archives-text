# Football frosh are ready to play
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the Lines 
Jim Harbaugh likes to play
freshmen, and doesn't feel a
need to justify doing so.
"The burn shirt thing I don't
know what that's about. Freshmen
are eligible to play," the third-year
coach said quizzically after Satur
day's rout of San Jose State.
The "shirt" Harbaugh refers to is
the valued redshirt, which allows a
player to gain an extra year of eligi
bility as long as he doesn't play for an
entire season. Most frequently, the
redshirt is used for freshmen so that
they can adjust to the college game
and learn the system while still main
taining a full four-year slate of poten
tial playing time "burning it"
means you play your rookies instead
of benching them for the season.
Harbaugh has shown a penchant
for using his frosh, from Owen Mare
cic and Chike Amajoyi in their first
year to Chris Owusu and Delano

Howell last season. That isn't to say
that every first-year gets to play
Andrew Luck and David DeCastro
are notable redshirts from 2008
but as other coaches hesitate to
throw their youngsters into the
gauntlet, if Harbaugh deems you
ready to play, you're getting on the
field.
"Football players get better by
playing football," he said.
And football teams benefit from
better football players, and be it
through using people two-ways or
switching their positions entirely,
Harbaugh has a knack for tweaking
his roster to optimize it to his liking.
Playing freshman fits this trend.
But while Marecic and Amajoyi
were starters in their first season, and
Owusu and Howell tallied serious
playing time in theirs, the 2009 fresh
men have mainly been seen on spe
cial teams and mop-up duties. There
is something to be said for taking a
redshirt year Harbaugh certainly
knows this, as evidenced by his han
dling of Luck last season. But, if their

redshirts are going to be burned, it
should be made all the more worth
while: These players need more sig
nificant offensive and defensive
reps. It's not solely for their own ben
efit â€” more than a couple are in a
position to help the Cardinal right
now.

The most obvious example is line
backer Shayne Skov, Stanford's top
overall 2009 recruit and the only one
to land the coveted five-star label.
Skov has already made an impact,
particularly last week against San
Jose State he had a monster hit on
a kickoff return early in the game
that sent Stanford Stadium into a
frenzy, and as a middle linebacker in
the fourth quarter, he was all over
the field. He crashed the line to stop
the run and raced sideline-to-side
line to drag down ball carriers he
recorded three straight tackles on
the Spartans' last drive, even though
one was negated by a penalty.
Up until last weekend, the Cardi
nal linebacking corps was seen as
one of the team's weak links, so
much so that Harbaugh essentially
issued an ultimatum before the San
Jose State game. The starters Will
Powers, in particular responded
with their best performance of the
season. But as Stanford heads into
the heart of its Pacific-10 Confer
ence schedule with two straight
games against tough opponents
ones that they practically must win
to preserve their hopes at a bowl
game they need all the help they
can get on the front seven. This isn't
a plea to start Skov yet but he
can contribute before the game is al
ready out of reach.
So, too, can receivers like Jamal-
Rashad Patterson and Drew Terrell,
who recorded their first receptions
of the season last week. Patterson
was among the top offensive re

cruits, and Harbaugh raved about
Terrell's playmaking ability after
signing day. Their game time was
more limited than Skov's in fact,
Patterson was ready to check in early
in the fourth quarter against the
Spartans, but a fumble on the pre
ceding play negated that opportuni
ty. Patterson's was clearly disap
pointed over not getting an extra
rep.

But those opportunities should
be there. While Chris Owusu and
Ryan Whalen are locked in as
starters, and Doug Baldwin appears
to be penciled in as the No. 3, the rest
of the receiving corps is wide open,
although Patterson hasn't been par
ticularly productive yet. After those
three, though, there doesn't seem to
be many fixed positions. Warren
Reuland and Griff Whalen are op
tions in addition to Patterson and
Terrell. The Cardinal rarely goes to
four- and five-receiver sets, but it has
happened more as the offense has
developed to suit Luck's dynamic
passing abilities. And the freshmen,
supposed playmakers-to-be, should
be a part of that.
With apologies to Tyler Gaffney
and Stepfan Taylor, who are stuck
firmly behind star running back
Toby Gerhart and the surprisingly
upstart Jeremy Stewart, there is one

final Cardinal frosh who should see
more playing time: defensive tackle
Terrence Stephens. With Matt Masi
filo out at least another month with
a knee injury, Stephens sits as a
prime candidate to take over a spot
in the tackle rotation. When Masifi
lo was healthy, there were four dif
ferent DTs who each saw consider
able reps against the Spartans,
the first game in his absence, it was
just the remaining three regulars
who saw the brunt of the work.
Even though linemen are tradition
ally redshirted in order to let them
bulk up, Stephens has already seen
game action with that in mind, he
now has a chance to see more time
as the possible fourth man in the ro
tation, at least until Masifilo re
turns.

Skov, Patterson, Terrell and
Stephens are all past the point of no
return, and maximizing their fresh
man year while simultaneously aid
ing the team is a desirable path.
"The-burn-the-shirt talk what
is that?" questioned Harbaugh. "You
get an opportunity to play, you play."
Indeed.
