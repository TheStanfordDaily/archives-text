# Golf starts strong
## Team takes fourth at first event of the fall season 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The N0.5 Stanford men's golf team
opened its fall season this week with a
fourth-place finish at the Fighting lllini Golf
Tournament in Chicago. This tournament
was chock-full of NCAA Championship
contenders from the spring, yet the Cardi
nal gave them a run for their money, falling
just a few strokes away from the win.
"It's great to get the juices flowing
again," said Coach Conrad Ray. "To me, the
first event is more about evaluation. The
course had the same hole locations set up as
in the U.S. Open, which was difficult.
"The event gave us an opportunity to
evaluate what we need to improve because
the course demands it," he continued. "Lots
of positives came from the event. Even
though we didn't play our best at the start,
we came within a few strokes and had a
chance to win, which is all you can ask for in
golf."

No. 17 Texas sneaked its way to a podium
position by one stroke to take third, fol
lowed by N0.3 Oklahoma State in second

and N0.2 Arizona State with the win. After
the second round, the Cardinal was only six
strokes away from Arizona State, but the
Sun Devils managed to maintain that six
stroke gap to take the tournament crown.
Stanford is coming at men's golf a little
bit differently this year, with a new roster

GAME NOTES ! Stanford men's golf will resume its sea
son next month, when the team heads to Southern
California in mid-October for The Prestige at PGA
West. The Card is coming off of a fourth place finish
in Olympia Fields, 111. last weekend and will be hop
ing to do even better in its home state. Expectations
are high for Stanford this year, as the team was
ranked first in the nation in Golfweek Magazine's
pre-season poll released earlier this month.

and a new character. Stanford's usual
senior-heavy roster was switched up a
bit this weekend with the Stanford
five boasting a strong junior contin
gent. Three juniors played, including
Graham Brockington, Sihwan Kim
and Steve Ziegler. Other starters in
cluded sophomore David Chung
and freshman Andrew Yun.

"Every year is a different team
dynamic," Ray said. "[Seniors] Jor
dan Cox and Joseph Bramlett can
play all year for us. Joseph is current
ly dealing with an injury and Jordan
has continued to work hard and has
had some good rounds this summer.
"Brockington was knocking on
the door all last year and had a
strong summer. It was great to see
him help us out in the final round.
Plus, when you put Steve, Andrew,

David and Sihwan together, they
make up a solid four no matter who
you're playing against.
"Each year you don't know what
you're going to get," he added, "but
I'm getting positive vibes for this up
coming season."
In addition to the new roster, the
Cardinal also comes into this year
with a new shot at NCAA glory. The
Cardinal began its season opener as
the No. 1 ranked team in the country
according to a Golfweek preseason
poll which turned up the heat on this
year's young team.
"It is one of those things that is
nice to have but we would much
rather have it in June than now," Ray
said. "A lot of that rank is based on
our guys' individual summers. The
big reason we are at number one is
probably because Chung, Yun and
Ziegler had really strong summers."
Despite the added pressure of the
hype leading up to their season
opener, the Cardinal golfers proved
that they can "walk the walk" this

past weekend.
No. 16 Ziegler led the way for
Stanford finishing in a tie for 6th
with a four-over 214. Ziegler came
within three strokes of tying for the
individual win.

Next up was Chung with an eight
over-par 218 in a tie for 14th. He
went into the final round in con
tention for the individual win with
two straight 71 stroke rounds, but a
final round of 76 threw him out of
the ring.
Kim and Brockington finished in
a tie for 28th and 56th, respectively,
with freshman Yun holding his own
in a tie for 33rd.

With such a hopeful mindset, it
looks like the Cardinal has some
tricks up its sleeve for this season.
The next test for Stanford is on Oct.
11 when the team heads to La Quin
ta, Calif, for The Prestige at the PGA
West tournament.
