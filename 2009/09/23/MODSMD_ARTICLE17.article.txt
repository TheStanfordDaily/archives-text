# Golf starts strong
## Team takes fourth at first event of the fall season 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The N0.5 Stanford men's golf team
opened its fall season this week with a
fourth-place finish at the Fighting lllini Golf
Tournament in Chicago. This tournament
was chock-full of NCAA Championship
contenders from the spring, yet the Cardi
nal gave them a run for their money, falling
just a few strokes away from the win.
"It's great to get the juices flowing
again," said Coach Conrad Ray. "To me, the
first event is more about evaluation. The
course had the same hole locations set up as
in the U.S. Open, which was difficult.
"The event gave us an opportunity to
evaluate what we need to improve because
the course demands it," he continued. "Lots
of positives came from the event. Even
though we didn't play our best at the start,
we came within a few strokes and had a
chance to win, which is all you can ask for in
golf."

No. 17 Texas sneaked its way to a podium
position by one stroke to take third, fol
lowed by N0.3 Oklahoma State in second

and N0.2 Arizona State with the win. After
the second round, the Cardinal was only six
strokes away from Arizona State, but the
Sun Devils managed to maintain that six
stroke gap to take the tournament crown.
Stanford is coming at men's golf a little
bit differently this year, with a new roster
