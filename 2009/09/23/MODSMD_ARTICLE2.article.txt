## Frosh put advising to the test Incoming students enter system cut by $400,000 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
When Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman discussed his office's decision
last spring to ax peer academic advising
programs —to the tune of some
$400,000 in savings, say administrators
—he doubted those programs were
actually working.

That belief is now being put to the
test, as students, and especially fresh
men, begin navigating the changed
advising system. Some freshmen say
having a formal peer advising system
like the peer mentor (PM) and residen
tial Head Peer Academic Counselor
(HPAC) programs that were cut amid
budget strains would have been nice.
Others say they are satisfied with the
advising they received last week and in
the weeks before arriving. Advising
staff, for their part, insist they're provid
ing equal, if not better service than
before the cuts.

"We're feeling really good about it,"
said Dean of Freshmen and
Undergraduate Advising Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'B9, whose office helps connect
each freshman with two older advisers: a
pre-major advisor usually a faculty
member and a residential Academic
Director (AD). ADs remain from the
system that formerly included student
advisors.

"Each AD has approximately 450
students that they're responsible for,"
Lythcott-Haims said. "That's consistent
with what our peers offer around the
country. We think we have the right
numbers in place."
Allison Stafford 'll, a resident assis
tant (RA) in Cedro, said freshmen have
sought her out for academic advice since
arriving, but that that may have been the
case even with peer mentors. "I am one
of the few upperclassmen that my resi
dents know and have sitting next to
them at dinner," Stafford said. But, she
added, "I don't think this year's fresh
men are relying on peer advice more
than we did as freshmen.

"I think the pre-major academic
advising seems to be moving in the right
direction," Stafford continued. "There
are more opportunities than ever to get
professional advice."
Some students have expressed con
cerns about the transition.

Yuliya Mykhaylovska 'l3 said she
would have liked an upperclassman
advisor because she, like many fresh
men, does not know an older student.
Jess Peterson 'l3, who lives in Twain,
agreed. "I would have liked to ask hon
est questions about faculty members,"
he said.

Mykhaylovska and Peterson added,
however, that freshman advising has
been basically adequate. "They can only
do so much," Peterson said.

Mykhaylovska added: "You just have
to know where to look."
Peterson also noted that he likes his
faculty advisor "not as much for spe
cific class advice," he said, "but more like
encouragement" and both students
lauded the help they got from their AD,
Larry Lagerstrom.
Lagerstrom and the other directors,
including three new staff from else
where in Undergraduate Research and
Advising, first contacted incoming fresh
men by email in mid-August, far earlier
than current upperclassmen had an
advisor's introduction.
"[Lagerstrom] knew what he was
talking about," Mykhaylovska said. "He
was much more useful."
Lythcott-Haims said budgeting for
ADs was money well spent. "We know
students will always take advice from
