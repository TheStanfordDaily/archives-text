# Kiss FULL MOON GOODBYE
## Deemed 'recipe for disaster,' Full Moon cancelled 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
Swine flu has claimed its first Stanford
casualty: Full Moon on the Quad.
Concerned about the spread of HINI
influenza, University administrators have can
celled this year's event a Stanford tradition
established in the late 19th century during
which seniors kiss freshmen under the aca
demic year's first full moon.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman released a statement to The Daily
late Tuesday announcing the cancellation,
after a health committee decided it would be
"irresponsible" for the University to promote
the event in light of current health concerns.
"Given that young people are considered
at high risk for HINI, it would be uncon
scionable for us to hold Full Moon on the
Quad," Boardman stated. "It is a popular
event and a great tradition, but it is too risky
given the prevalence and virulence of FI1N1."
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Flealth
Center, echoed the vice provost's sentiment.
"Given the circumstances and the likelihood
that Stanford will be affected by HINI, Full
Moon is a recipe for disaster," Friedman said.
"Obviously, the health and safety of our
students comes before everything else, even a
decades-old tradition," added Dean of
Freshmen and Undergraduate Advising Julie
Lythcott-Flaims 'B9 in a separate statement to
The Daily.
The first full moon of the quarter will take
place Sunday, Oct. 4.
While Tuesday's statement contradicted
comments made earlier this week by other
administrators, the ultimate decision to cancel

the event signals the intent behind flu season
preparations. The first week of classes has
come with a doctor's order: If you have any
hint of a fever, cough or sore throat, make
next week your first week.
At the crux of the University's concerns is
the HINI virus, originally referred to as swine
flu. Since its first appearance at Stanford in
the spring, campus officials have moved
quickly to develop a quarantine plan, even
ready to cancel the remainder of spring quar
ter if the virus spread.

Now, as health officials have downgraded
the severity of HINI in comparison to season
al flu, school administrators have adjusted
their plans accordingly. "Earlier plans to halt
classes and close our undergraduate resi
dences, tools to combat a severe 'avian' flu,
have been shelved in favor of asking students
to self-isolate in their rooms or go home, if
local, or to a local relative to recuperate,"

'UNCONSCIONABLE': Students kiss on the Quad in 2008. Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman said late
Tuesday that holding Full Moon on the Quad would be "irresponsible" in light of flu concerns. Earlier this week, administrators had
said they did not expect Full Moon, a 19th century tradition and modern-day campus party, to be shut down this year. Vaden Health
Center Director Ira Friedman said that, given the risk of H1N1 and seasonal flu, the event would be "a recipe for disaster."
Friedman said in an email to The
Daily. "So far, the novel HINI
'swine' flu has been about as severe
as annual 'seasonal' flu."

Larry Gibbs, associate vice
provost for environmental health
and safety, did note one unique
aspect of swine flu relevant to col
lege campuses: It appears a higher
proportion of people under 24 are
susceptible to the disease, Gibbs
also said he expects a greater preva
lence of flu than during a normal flu
season.

Recently, doctors at Vaden have
told patients with flu-like symptoms
that they likely have the HINI
virus. They have also stopped swab
bing for the disease because of its
widespread occurrence.
"Community testing for swine
flu stopped in May because it's cir
culating widely through the commu
nity and there is no advantage of
community testing at this point,"
said Joy Alexiou, a spokesperson for
Santa Clara County Public Health.
Still, Friedman emphasized,

Vaden continues to monitor the flu
situation despite the halt on testing.
"We monitor the cases of flu-like ill
ness in the patients that we see at
Vaden. The campus incidence of flu
like illness has reflected the pattern
in the surrounding community. Flu
like illness was high in the spring
and ... continues to be affecting
students as they have returned to
campus," Friedman said.
While officials have stressed pre
ventative measures for containing
the flu's spread, they are also wait
ing for HINI vaccine shipments.
County health officials said the
campus can expect the vaccine to be
available by mid to late October,
but Friedman said Vaden is still
waiting for the government's
approval to distribute it.

In the meantime, students are
being encouraged to receive season
al flu shots, which will be available
free of charge in early October. The
shot for seasonal flu will not provide
immunity to the HINI strain of the
virus.
