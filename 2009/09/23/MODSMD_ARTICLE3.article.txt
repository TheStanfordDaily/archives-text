# Kiss FULL MOON GOODBYE
## Deemed 'recipe for disaster,' Full Moon cancelled 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
Swine flu has claimed its first Stanford
casualty: Full Moon on the Quad.
Concerned about the spread of HINI
influenza, University administrators have can
celled this year's event a Stanford tradition
established in the late 19th century during
which seniors kiss freshmen under the aca
demic year's first full moon.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman released a statement to The Daily
late Tuesday announcing the cancellation,
after a health committee decided it would be
"irresponsible" for the University to promote
the event in light of current health concerns.
"Given that young people are considered
at high risk for HINI, it would be uncon
scionable for us to hold Full Moon on the
Quad," Boardman stated. "It is a popular
event and a great tradition, but it is too risky
given the prevalence and virulence of FI1N1."
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Flealth
Center, echoed the vice provost's sentiment.
"Given the circumstances and the likelihood
that Stanford will be affected by HINI, Full
Moon is a recipe for disaster," Friedman said.
"Obviously, the health and safety of our
students comes before everything else, even a
decades-old tradition," added Dean of
Freshmen and Undergraduate Advising Julie
Lythcott-Flaims 'B9 in a separate statement to
The Daily.
The first full moon of the quarter will take
place Sunday, Oct. 4.
While Tuesday's statement contradicted
comments made earlier this week by other
administrators, the ultimate decision to cancel

the event signals the intent behind flu season
preparations. The first week of classes has
come with a doctor's order: If you have any
hint of a fever, cough or sore throat, make
next week your first week.
At the crux of the University's concerns is
the HINI virus, originally referred to as swine
flu. Since its first appearance at Stanford in
the spring, campus officials have moved
quickly to develop a quarantine plan, even
ready to cancel the remainder of spring quar
ter if the virus spread.

Now, as health officials have downgraded
the severity of HINI in comparison to season
al flu, school administrators have adjusted
their plans accordingly. "Earlier plans to halt
classes and close our undergraduate resi
dences, tools to combat a severe 'avian' flu,
have been shelved in favor of asking students
to self-isolate in their rooms or go home, if
local, or to a local relative to recuperate,"

'UNCONSCIONABLE': Students kiss on the Quad in 2008. Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman said late
Tuesday that holding Full Moon on the Quad would be "irresponsible" in light of flu concerns. Earlier this week, administrators had
said they did not expect Full Moon, a 19th century tradition and modern-day campus party, to be shut down this year. Vaden Health
Center Director Ira Friedman said that, given the risk of H1N1 and seasonal flu, the event would be "a recipe for disaster."
