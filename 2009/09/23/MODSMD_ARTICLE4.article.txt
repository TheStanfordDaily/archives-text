## New Coupa must wait for January 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
If you were hoping to grab a cup of coffee
before class at the new Coupa Cafe between
Meyer and Green libraries, you're going to have
to wait a little longer.
January 2010, to be exact.
The boarded-up kiosk that formerly housed
Moonbean's was slated to be up and running by
this fall, but Coupa is still working with Santa
Clara County to obtain the necessary building
and health permits before construction can offi
cially commence.
"We knew that permitting would have to
happen; we just didn't expect the number and
difficulty of issues," said Andrew Herkovic,
director of communication and development
for libraries.
Coupa Cafe owner Jean Paul Coupal said his
team was originally operating under the

assumption that the permitting and construc
tion would comprise a three-month time span.
"The construction itself will be really fast," he
said, "but it's basically impossible to build a
restaurant in two months. That's essentially how
long just the permitting phase takes."

The 11-year-old kiosk was outfitted to meet
building codes from the late 1990s and couldn't
accommodate some of Coupa's new features,

like the grease trap and panini press that
Coupal plans to install. Health and building offi
cials didn't begin to inspect the premises until
early August, which delayed Coupa's scheduled
opening.

Marshall agencies must all green-light Coupa's

The second campus Coupa location, set to open here between Meyer and Green libraries, faces
permitting delays and will not open until January, owners say. Moonbean's left the space in spring.
renovation plans "a super slow
process," said Coupal before con
struction gets underway. Then, the
DevCon builders, the same company
that worked on Crothers and the
Graduate School of Business last
year, can begin retrofitting the
kiosk's interior and getting a brand
new kitchen up and running.
Coupal hopes construction will
begin in the next few weeks. But for
many, a quarter without a fully-oper
ational coffee shop between the
libraries is too long a coffee break.
"I'm really unhappy about this
delay," Herkovic said. A self-pro
fessed coffee lover, Herkovic has
resorted to trekking to the
Cubberley basement from his office
in Green Library to grab his cup of
joe. But he said that in terms of qual
ity and convenience, it just doesn't
compare.
Victoria Pennings 'l2 used to fre

quent Moonbean's on a regular
basis. Now she, too, is seeking alter
native coffee options until Coupa
sets up shop. "I've gone to the
Alumni Cafe to get coffee," she said,
"but I really miss the accessibility of
Moonbean's."

To accommodate those like
Herkovic and Pennings, Coupal and
the University are working on a tem
porary caffeine solution in the form
of a coffee cart inside of Meyer
Library. The push-cart service would
offer basic coffee and tea services
until Coupa officially launches. The
cart, they say, should be available to
students within two weeks.

Coupal said he's working as fast
as he can to expedite the construc
tion schedule, but assures students
that Coupa's unveiling will be well
worth the wait.

Herkovic agrees. "We really have
great hopes of new start," he said.
"Everyone gets rich, famous and caf
feinated. But until Coupa opens,
we'll live."
