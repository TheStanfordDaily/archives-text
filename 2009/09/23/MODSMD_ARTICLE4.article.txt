## New Coupa must wait for January 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
If you were hoping to grab a cup of coffee
before class at the new Coupa Cafe between
Meyer and Green libraries, you're going to have
to wait a little longer.
January 2010, to be exact.
The boarded-up kiosk that formerly housed
Moonbean's was slated to be up and running by
this fall, but Coupa is still working with Santa
Clara County to obtain the necessary building
and health permits before construction can offi
cially commence.
"We knew that permitting would have to
happen; we just didn't expect the number and
difficulty of issues," said Andrew Herkovic,
director of communication and development
for libraries.
Coupa Cafe owner Jean Paul Coupal said his
team was originally operating under the

assumption that the permitting and construc
tion would comprise a three-month time span.
"The construction itself will be really fast," he
said, "but it's basically impossible to build a
restaurant in two months. That's essentially how
long just the permitting phase takes."

The 11-year-old kiosk was outfitted to meet
building codes from the late 1990s and couldn't
accommodate some of Coupa's new features,

like the grease trap and panini press that
Coupal plans to install. Health and building offi
cials didn't begin to inspect the premises until
early August, which delayed Coupa's scheduled
opening.

Marshall agencies must all green-light Coupa's

The second campus Coupa location, set to open here between Meyer and Green libraries, faces
permitting delays and will not open until January, owners say. Moonbean's left the space in spring.
