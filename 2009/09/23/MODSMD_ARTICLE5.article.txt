## Less trays, less waste, says Dining 
### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
Walk into Stern Dining this year and
you will surely see a lot of Class of 2013
T-shirts. But there's one thing you won't
see: dining hall trays.
Starting this quarter, Stern has
removed trays from the dining halls in a
student-initiated effort to reduce water
and food waste. Wilbur Dining, which
had made fewer trays available and dis
couraged their use, is now following suit.
Junior Siddhartha Oza led the initia
tive. An earth systems major, Oza read
an article last spring in The New York
Times about colleges around the coun
try going trayless, saving money, food
and water in the process. Oza won
dered: Would Stanford students be as
receptive?
He then pitched a similar policy in
Stanford dining halls last spring. A
student survey he coordinated with
Stanford Dining and Students for a
Sustainable Stanford confirmed his
hunch: More than 75 percent of the
400 or so respondents said they sup
ported trayless dining.
So far, student responses to the
new program have remained consis
tent with the survey.
"We've experienced some early
bumps in the road and have received
mixed, though generally very positive
student feedback," said Dining's
Sustainable Foods Program
Coordinator Matt Rothe in an email
to The Daily. Rothe has closely moni
tored the move to trayless.
Oza pointed out in an email to The
Daily that students can still obtain
trays upon request if they so desire,

and use of trays, while reduced, is not
banished.

"Having to request a tray requires
students to think about whether they
need it," Oza said. "My hope is that
this program will encourage a greater
sense of environmental conscious
ness in the student body."
Indeed, at Stern, trays are not
readily available and, consequently,
seldom used.

"I haven't seen that many trays at
all," said Stern Dining frequenter
Kevin Tong 'l2.
By contrast, Trancos RA Angelina
Cardona 'll said she still sees a signif
icant number of trays in Wilbur
Dining, where trays have been side
lined in the dining hall but not com
pletely phased out.
"There is still a heavy abundance
of trays being used," Cardona wrote
in an email to The Daily. "Students
see other people with trays and think,
'Oh, I need a tray, too,' even if they
might not."
Because Wilbur trays are visible
by the swipe-in post where students
enter to eat, students are able to take

them without request, she said. "If
there were no presence of trays, then
students probably wouldn't think
twice about carrying their plate."
She added that some students,
however, prefer to take food to their
room or cannot carry everything they
want on a single plate, making com
plete elimination of trays unrealistic.

Meanwhile, the metrics of waste
reduction are still unclear.

Dining turned to a 2008 study
done by Aramark Higher Education
to help design the trayless program.
The study examined 25 colleges, find
ing that one day of trayless dining
results in a 25 to 30 percent reduction
in food waste per student. Many
involved in the initiative said
Stanford hopes to see a similar
decline in food waste.

But some students' early experi
ences indicate otherwise.

Cardona feels that upperclassmen
already know how much they will eat
at a dining hall, so going trayless
doesn't change their habits.
"After eating in the dining halls
for the past three years, I know

more or less the amount and type
of food I want and need," Cardona
said.

She added that a focus on edu
cating students about the

impacts of going trayless could
help. "In order for trayless to

function successfully, we need
more education and aware-

ness in order to get more
people on board while also

being aware and consider
ate of the needs of those
who actually need the
larger surface area for
their meals."
According to Rothe,
the transition has been
smooth. "Operationally,
the transition has been
fairly straightforward,

although it has required some addi
tional staff training and repositioning
of trays in the dining halls," he said.
Some students, like Stern resident
Doug Issichopoulos 'l2, feel their
eating habits have changed since the
implementation of trayless dining. "I
like it because I used to pile on as

much as I could onto a tray,"
Issichopoulos said. "This is an envi
ronmentally friendly way to eat a
better amount of food."

Students might even be benefiting
from the challenge of carrying food,
drinks and silverware with all but two

hands.
"Of course, there's always that
balancing act," Tong said. "But I think
it's a good skill to have."
