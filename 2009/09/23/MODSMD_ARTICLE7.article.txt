We all know the "Stanford bubble"
cheerful students engrossed in classes
and textbooks, immune to the real
world. But when the financial bubble
burst on Wall Street, Stanford, too, was
affected. Last week, new students arrived to a Stanford
that has experienced cross-campus cuts to nearly every
department and program.
Despite the school's financial troubles, the typical
festivities of New Student Orientation (NSO) survived
dorm cheers. Band Run, Real World Stanford, a party
just for the incoming class and program open houses.
Resident Assistants (RAs) in every dorm worked tire
lessly to ensure that new freshmen enjoyed an NSO
untarnished by the budget cuts that have moved
through every aspect of campus life.
Stanford has lost an estimated 30 percent of its budg
etary bite this fiscal year. This reduction totaling
about $5 billion comes just a few years after the
University unleashed a renewed commitment to finan
cial aid for undergraduates.
"Combine this with the steady decline in federal
research funding, a decline in gift dollars and an increase
in financial need on the part of our students, and the
result is an unprecedented decline in the University's
expected revenue," Provost John Etchemendy told a
local paper.
Regardless, Stanford has been relentless in its pledge
to maintain its academic commitments and financial aid
programs. Yet, the largest drop in endowment since the
1970s could not be ignored as freshmen and transfers
arrived on Sept. 15 to kick off NSO.
Some older students who were already on campus
felt that this year's NSO seemed as good, if not better
than their own.

"I thought the freshmen and RAs seemed a lot more
enthusiastic than they did when I arrived on campus"
said Francine Biscocho 'l2.

Dorm staff members used creativity in their decorat
ing to overcome the widening budget gap. Red Ransil
'lO, an RA in Roble, eschewed expensive, store-bought

decorations, designing and building a chocolate water
fall to fit the dorm's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
theme. Ingenuity and hours of hard work from dedicat
ed volunteers, not deep pockets, preserved the vibrancy
of NSO.

"I think we made up for any monetary shortfalls,"
said Brett Ostrander 'll, a Roble RA. "We definitely
put a lot of effort into keeping up NSO."
Careful spending was visible in small ways. At New
Student Party a traditional dance party for the new
freshmen, known in recent years as NSGlow most
freshmen found themselves without glow sticks.
Despite this, most members of the Class of 2013 did
n't feel that anything was missing from their first week
at Stanford.

"NSO was a really fun way to break into Stanford,"
said Elena Higuchi 'l3. "I don't think we noticed any
thing absent. We just enjoyed the cheering."
Budget cuts and layoffs aside, the NSO experience
has done anything but head south. On the contrary,
Stanford staff and students seem unwilling to compro
mise the joy and excitement of NSO, even as financial
constraints tighten. In the end, NSO is about the com
munity of Stanford, something that, no matter how
much financial peril the University may be in, doesn't
seem to be going anywhere.

Roble staff spent hours crafting a chocolate waterfall to
decorate the dorm's main entrance just one example of the creativity being tapped to save money.
