## NO BOOKS, NO PENCILS

-- a a confused girl turns to her
J friend. "Is that SAE or Kappa
YY sis?
Packs of freshmen make their way up Campus Drive
to the fraternity houses on the hill. Stanford Police cars
drive up and down the Row. A discarded can of
Keystone Light lies forlornly on the street.
Never mind that it's a Monday night NSO is over,
and a new year of frat parties has begun.
"Stanford ID?" a blonde boy asks a girl outside of
SAE. A large security guard stands menacingly behind
as she flashes her card and enters the party.
The front room is packed. A girl shrieks excitedly as
she spots a friend among the sea of unfamiliar faces. She
runs to hug him, leaving the two friends she walked in
with behind.
"Ew," another girl makes a disgusted face upon walk
ing through the front door. She is greeted by a putrid
aroma of body odor, sweat and beer. "It stinks in here."
Jeremih's "Birthday Sex" blares from the back room.
Flashing strobe lights interrupt the darkness, illuminat
ing boys lining the walls, their eyes raking the bodies of
girls showing off their moves on the dance floor.
Outside, a cheerful-looking SAE member stands
behind the bar, offering an assortment of sodas to who
ever approaches.

"You have no alcohol?" an already-drunk girl slumps
disappointed along the bar.
A nearby group of three girls has a different reaction
to the noticeable absence of alcohol. "Perfect," one of
them says, pulling a half-filled water bottle of vodka out
of her tote bag. "Chasers!"
A photo booth stands oddly in the corner of the
lawn. Some students group together in the yard while
others wander in and out of the various rooms.
Upperclassmen with friends in SAE disappear into their
bedrooms for a more intimate party experience.
The festivities rage on for several hours. The rooms
get sweatier and hotter, and the partygoers grow more
inebriated.

"Just hang on to my hand," a girl shouts over the
music. She drags her friend through the densely packed
room and the swaying conglomeration of dancers in an
effort to get some fresh air.
A boy in a red T-shirt grasps the waist of the girl
dancing in front of him. She bends over, her body form
ing a 45 degree angle, and gyrates against her dance
partner. Some nearby dancers look on in disgust; others
laugh.
"What time does Axe & Palm close?" a girl asks her
friend outside of the bathroom. "Chicken tenders would
be so good right now."
Around 12:15 a.m., the party is dying down. Tired
partygoers meander down the hill and back to their res
idences, many dreading their 9 a.m. classes the next
morning.
