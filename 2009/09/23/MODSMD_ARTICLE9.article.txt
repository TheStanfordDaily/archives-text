## THE 						PENSIEVE Harry Potter and the Pensive Professor 
### Melanie Horn Brian Wanyoike 
"I sometimes find... that I simply have too
many thoughts and memories crammed into
my mind."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, p. 597
Unsurprisingly, Stanford students' usual
methods of dealing with stress, which
include sleep, exercise and the con
sumption of large quantities of chocolate, all
seem beneath Harry Potter's Professor Albus
Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Maybe
his title as Supreme Mugwump of the Inter
national Confederation of Wizards and
Order of Merlin, First Class accounts for his
drift from typical methods of dealing with an
overloaded brain, because somehow dump
ing his thoughts into a stone basin known as a
Pensieve and chilling with them is the way he
rolls. Considering Dumbledore's genius and
his mild beard-growing success, we could
probably learn a thing or two from the man.
By examining the process and resulting con
structiveness of his odd coping methods, we
might, in fact, be inspired to dabble in a little
Dumbledore-esque magic and to whip out
our own pseudo-Pensieves.
Sure, we may not be trying to keep evil at
bay, oversee an entire magical institution or
escape the awkwardness of almost "partner
ing" with one of the darkest wizards of all
time, but in many ways, we Stanford students
can still relate to Dumbledore. We struggle to
balance school life with other organizations
and commitments, grapple with possibly less
than-ideal family relationships and often get
caught up in our pasts and where we come
from while trying to focus on the future and
move forward. Unlike Dumbledore, however,
when these obligations and issues occupy our
minds, all we seek is escape and release.
On a campus where wasting time is the
worst felony possible, it makes perfect sense
for us to shove thoughts that are not expedi
ent to daily survival into the recesses of our
minds. The aforementioned challenges we
face may gnaw away at our consciences, but
none of them has the pressing urgency that
problem sets, research papers and weekly
meetings do. These issues can trip our minds
at times and rear their ugly, thestral-like
heads in late-night dorm conversations or
moments of introspection while biking; but
for day-to-day personal sanity's sake, it's
much easier to silence such voices. Who real
ly wants to dwell on the possibility that they
might not be such a pure-intentioned person
after all? Who would willingly remember the
irreparable mistakes they've made, years
after the fact? Who can afford to bask in the
series of epic relationships fails for which they
are probably responsible?
Despite the indisputable, potion-gone-bad
grossness of it all, Dumbledore somehow
forces himself to run right toward, and literal
ly immerse himself in, all of these thoughts
but not without the help of a nifty magical de
vice known as a Pensieve. A Pensieve, as
Harry discovers not-so-safely by plunging his
head into its contents actions totally con
doned in all chemistry labs, we're sure is
nothing more than a device used to collect

thoughts from one's own mind. Dumbledore
uses the Pensieve to engage with his memo
ries in a more tangible and organized fashion,
allowing for better understanding of complex
sequences and events.

Important to note, however, is that the
Pensieve neither reveals secrets nor miracu
lously organizes Dumbledore's many ideas
for him; it simply provides a vessel within
which he can place his mind extractions. So, it
might be possible that this magical device
isn't so magical at all. Perhaps the magic of
Dumbledore's methods is in his finding the

strength to pull out his thoughts at all and rec
ognize that nagging thoughts rankle us be
cause they have something important to say
to us about our own lives. Forget waving a
magic wand to make our problems go away
it appears that the release and escape that
Stanford students so desperately seek might
be found in the simple act of extracting the is
sues from our minds and making frightening
hypotheticals less intimidating tangibles. At
least, that's what we are going to try to do.
In these upcoming weeks, this column will
serve as our merry little Pensieve, containing
our awkward and slightly embarrassing
thoughts floating around in wordy strands.
Like Dumbledore, this little space hallowed
out for us here isn't going to give us any an
swers on its own we're just as clueless as
everyone. Still, we're convinced that we Mug
gles have as much of a place in J.K. Rowling's
magical world as wizards do. So, why not grab
a broomstick (or a hippogriff, if you're a little
more risque) and join us for the ride? Laugh
at our thoughts, think about them and maybe
take some time to get your thoughts out of
your mind, too.

Then again, if the whole introspection/self
examination thing sounds too painful, maybe
just stick with the chocolate. Last time we
checked, it's pretty good for curing issues
caused by dementor attacks and all
nighter midterm studying.

Melanie and Brian are currently looking for pos
sible portkey locations on campus. For leads,

Nagging thoughts
rankle us
because they
have something
important to say.
