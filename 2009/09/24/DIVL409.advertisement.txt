NEW Autumn 2009-2010 Offerings:
Humßio 113- Tire Biologies of Human and Plants (Katherine Preston)
Dynamics of culturally inherited human behavior and its relationship to social and physical environments. Topics include a his
tory of ecological approaches in anthropology, subsistence ecology, sharing, risk management, territoriality, warfare, and
resource conservation and management. Case studies from Australia, Melanesia, Africa, and S. America.
Humßio 129P - International Health Policy: Comparative Health Care Systems
(Donald Light)
Identify key dimensions and issues involved in affluent health care systems in countries such as the UK-England, Canada,
Germany, Sweden, Japan, and France, including pharmaceutical policy and lessons for U.S. Learn what the key problems are
that health care systems face, principal characteristics of several systems, forces of change, and structural differences. How a
given country approaches health care takes us to its values, its sense of justice, its views on rationing, its interest groups, and its
political power structure.
Humßio 145 L - Biology and Evolution of Language (James Fox)
Language as an evolutionary adaptation of humans. Comparison of communicative behavior in humans and animals, and the
inference of evolutionary stages. Structure, linguistic functions, and the evolution of the vocal tract, ear, and brain, with associ
ated disorders (stuttering, dyslexia, autism, schizophrenia) and therapies. Controversies over language centers in the brain and
the innateness of language acquisition. Vision, color terminology, and biological explanation in linguistic theory.
Humßio 151 - Introduction to Epidemiology (Daniel Salkeld)
This lecture course will examine basic principles of epidemiology: the distribution and determinants of disease, the control of
health problems, and the medical detective work required to understand disease outbreaks. We will use case studies from devel
oped and developing countries to explore the use of epidemiological techniques in describing disease dynamics of human, emerg
ing and zoonotic (animal to human) diseases (e.g. SARS, plague, HIV, influenza); the impacts of changes in policy, law and behav
ior on disease control and eradication (e.g. hepatitis vaccination); and examine modern challenges in epidemiology such as glob
al disease transmission, environmental change and bioterrorism threats.
NEW Winter 2009-2010 Offerings:
