## Scientists transfer'insomnia gene' to mice 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
Sleep-deprived Stanford students
may someday find themselves able to
get by with late nights, thanks to a
breakthrough at Stanford Medical
School.

A recently discovered genetic
variation in humans that allows for
less sleep without consequences in
energy loss has been successfully
passed on to mice with the help of
Stanford's Sleep and Circadian
Neurobiology Laboratory.
When a 68-year-old woman
approached Dr. Christopher Jones of
the University of Utah School of
Medicine reporting that she and her
daughter consistently required less
sleep than normal, researchers at
Stanford began testing mice to see if
the variation could be transferred.

Officially called the DEC 2 varia
tion, it was nicknamed the "insom
nia" gene,
"They [the women] only sleep six
hours per day, but their energy levels
and activity levels are quite normal,"
said Seiji Nishino, director of the lab
oratory, in an email to The Daily.
Both women sleep between 10:00
and 10:30 p.m. and are wide awake
between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m.
After the UC-San Francisco
group, which collaborated in the
research, identified the DEC 2 varia
tion, it was not clear as to whether the
variation had anything to do with
sleep or was simply a coincidence.
"The most straight-forward and
doable approach to prove this is to
transfer the gene to animals and eval
uate the phenotype," Nishino said.
The study's researchers, led by
Stanford researcher Nobuhiro Fujiki,
then transferred the gene to create a
colony of so-called "insomniac"
rodents. The mice's sleep was moni

tored and interrupted to see if less
sleep affected their activity.

"We found that the mice with the
human DEC 2 variation are more
active," Nishino said. "In addition,
when the animal was sleep-deprived,
they did not need [as] much recovery
sleep as normal animals need, sug
gesting sleep homeostatic changes."
Their activity was tested by
recording how long the mice could
run on wheels. On average, mice with
the variant gene outran the control
group by one and a half hours.
Published in the Aug. 13 issue of

Science, the study
brings up the

interesting ques
tion of whether (
or not this gene
could be trans
ferred to humans.

"When you get to
humans, it's a whole different

ballgame if you want to tinker with
the genome," said William Dement,
sleep expert and professor of psychia
try and behavioral sciences.
While this is the first study to both
identify a gene that regulates sleep
necessity and demonstrate that a vari
ant of it causes sleep changes,
Dement said there are too many bar
riers preventing human testing.
"The protections for human sub
jects are highly prohibitive," he said,
adding that funding is also difficult to
obtain for current sleep research.
Dement additionally protested
against calling it the "insomnia gene."
"You don't say insomnia unless
there is a negative consequence," he

said, referring to the

term as "the most
misused word in the

human language." Fie

would instead opt to
call it the "sleep require
ment gene."

Still, the possibility of eventually
transferring the gene to humans is
exciting to Dement, who said it has "a
lot of potential."

"Would this mean this could even
tually get to the point where we don't
need sleep? Do we not need sleep
anymore? It's a very interesting ques
tion, but we're certainly a long way
from answering it," he said.
Following his "Sleep and Dreams"
class mantra, "Drowsiness is Red
Alert," Dement mentioned that there
would be fewer accidents due to a
decrease in drowsiness.

"If I had such a gene, I could not

only stay awake during
_ every class, but also
at night when I need
to get work done," said
Christianne Gonzalez

'l2. "I would have much

more time to socialize and

hang out with friends at night. Also,
I feel like this gene would be great for
those in the trucker business."

"In the lifetime of students, I
would say this problem is most likely
to be solved, or elucidated," Dement
said.

But sleep research in this field still
has a long way to go. While Nishino
predicted that they "may be able to
pharmacologically target the gene
and develop drugs that make people
wake up or sleep," Dement compared
the findings to Watson's and Crick's
discovery of the DNA double helix.
"This is a tremendous discovery,"
he said, "but not the final answer by
any stretch of the imagination."
