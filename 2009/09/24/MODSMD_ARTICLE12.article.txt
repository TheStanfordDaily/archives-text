## UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE Emily figures it all out 
### Emily Hulme 
Well, folks, it's time we had a serious
talk. You might want to sit down for
this. I'm coming to you woman to
man/woman or, as the adverts for "Dog
Whisperer" in Italy say, "cane a cane."
You may not know it, but a grave threat to
the welfare of this country has evolved under
our collective noses and no, I'm not talk
ing about Glenn Beck. The peril I write of is
all the more vile for operating under the
guise of a so-called "fundamental" freedom.
So, we all know free speech was a good
thing. Remember the McCarthy days? 800.
Not that I'm a pinko, man, but really, protests
at Berkeley and Columbia were exclusively
responsible not only for the abolition of the
House Committee on Un-American Activi
ties, but also for the successes of the civil
rights movement, the ending of war in 'Nam
and (my personal favorite) the invention of
IHUM. Much like an eclair, this is sweet all
around and yet surprisingly filling.
Now, I'm all about freedom of speech for
promoting diversity, supporting our govern
ment post-2008 and occasionally telling peo
ple to neuter their pets. But, shockingly, some
people have interpreted the First Amend
ment as a license to express unpopular and
even offensive ideas.

What I'm trying to say is that freedom of
speech was nice, but, like Mariah Carey, has
outlasted its use. You know, when Mariah
comes on the radio and all you can think is
that some patronizing record producer has
kept her cryogenically frozen for the last
decade or so, constantly feeding her a diet of
TMZ, Furbies and cotton candy and is cur
rently using her strictly for vilely insulting the
ears of the American people. And that's how
it is with freedom of speech, now used large
ly for nefarious purposes.

Witness the case list from FIRE, an organ
ization that keeps fighting universities over
their "speech codes," including our own.
Now, in case you didn't get the memo, speech
codes don't affect you, noble reader, but
merely abridge the rights of people (of insid
ious intent, certainly) wanting to speak about
controversial issues. Now, controversy is a
distasteful thing. Polite company requires
quiet complacency, and arguments are tres
awkward. I personally didn't come to college
to have my views questioned; with the school
acting in loco parentis, I need to be coddled
continuously, and have my feelings affirmed
constantly. I want to live in a world without
bigots or people who question my belief that
unicorns are the most suitable pet for fami
lies with young children. I expect the Univer
sity to provide this climate. Being against the
stimulus/in favor of the Iraq War/opposed to
abortion rights is not a legitimate viewpoint

worthy of such scholars as ourselves, but a
symptom of either psychotic derangement or
incurable stupidity.

FIRE has stepped in at Bucknell U.,
where conservative students (read: evil igno
ramuses ... or is it ignoramusi?) were illicit
ly peddling fake cash that said "Obama's
Stimulus Plan Makes Your Money as Worth
less as Monopoly Money." The nerve! As
West Coast National Monopoly Champion
2006-2007,1 find their implication that mo
nopoly money is "worthless" particularly in
sulting; not only can it be used to build such
valuable innovations as plastic hotels on
Broadway, but it has also given me access to
what the Romans had to conquer countless
would-be rivals for: fama gloriaque. Worth
less? Really? More like priceless. Suck it,
Bucknell conservatives.

Moreover, imagine if a stimulus supporter
chanced to run into a member of the conser
vative group. He might have to explain his
disagreement. Worse, he could question his
beliefs. Whatever the outcome of this, he will
have just practiced thinking. Yuck. That cer
tainly doesn't belong on campus.
Now, you might be a little concerned,
given the history of, say, totalitarian regimes
not tolerating any sort of freedom of speech,
subscribing to crackpot theories and eventu
ally deciding to slaughter millions of citizens
who complained about being paid in vodka
and toilet paper. Good thing we have finally
solved all of the world's problems, definitive
ly, within the confines of the University
there's nothing left to debate. After all, most
universities have achieved a level of unanim
ity of opinion Puritan villages would envy
(some of my friends voted for Barack; the
others voted for Obama), and I don't think
there's anything left to question.
We've made it, and it's due time to ditch
the free speech fig leaf used to justify dissent
against progress. It's just a waste of time, as
Thomas Friedman noted in The New York
Times, when we have business to do. Dispel
your disbelief and misplaced sense of irony at
a writer for an American newspaper who has
previously relied on the First Amendment
more than once to argue that autocracy is
needed to lead us to the new age of ultimate
environmentally-friendly nirvana. Ignore,
you know, the history of fascism in the West
it doesn't apply here. We've made it. I do
really think so. After all, we're the new, en
lightened age that brought the world reality
TV.
