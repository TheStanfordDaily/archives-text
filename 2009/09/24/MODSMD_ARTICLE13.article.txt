The "big" talks in life? They're mostly pret
ty lame. I don't mean parents explaining
death to toddlers or sex to fifth graders
those are pretty lame, too, but at least they're
informative. What I mean are the kind of con
versations that inspire you to stay up stupidly
late because the "insight" being gained is so
rich, so deep, that you just can't turn away from
it. Problem? Those insights, like the "connec
tions" you make with people while on ecstasy,
tend to slip out the next morning while you're
making breakfast.
This past weekend I was as close to France
as I've ever been a few kilometers south
on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees. We spent
the weekend visiting 900-year-old churches
in Vail de Boi. Majestic, awesome, spectacu
lar those are all words I could use to de
scribe those mountains, but they'd all serve
pretty poorly. You'll just have to take my
word for it.
At night, the air was crisp. Two thousand
meters up, we could see fog on top of the
mountain that looked to be close by it was
the bottom of the cloud cover. I walked out of
the hotel with two friends and a glass of
whisky in hopes of looking at the stars. We
headed up in search of a place to sit, then
took the stairs that headed off to the right.
Further up was a picnic table in front of a bas
ketball court. We walked further up the path
around a hill, straining to see through the fog
in the grayscale vision the little light allowed.
Then there was a fence and a ravine beyond,
the sky stretching above, flecked with stars
and planets and the sort of astronomical cob
web that I suppose must be the Milky Way.
The glass of scotch was in my hand and I took
a drink, but the night shadows that my eyes
could not quite force into shape worried me.
We retreated to the picnic table, just out of
the halos of light emitted by the street lamps,
and the whisky in the glass lowered away to
nothing, sip by sip, as we talked.
We talked about God, death, life, sex
you know, the basics. It wasn't long until I
knew that what we were saying had been
said, and said better by countless others. I was
reading from my script about the "big ideas"
and while my interlocutors were helpful, I
knew we would only end up with half-truths
and frustration.

At around 3 a.m., we wandered back
down to the hotel, making sure we weren't
locked out, before scaling a rock next to the
hotel that overlooked the church and its
cemetery. We were perched next to the iron
silhouettes of sheep and their shepherd,
which someone had seen fit to erect.
Poor me, sitting in the pirineos without
even real sheep to keep me company, airing
existential angst against an alpine backdrop,
the wind drawing the warmth from my bones
as fast as I could rub my hands together to
bring it back. What was I to do?
Shut up, stop worrying and try to live a life.
I have little respect for those whose blind
faith sustains them. No scorn, but little re
spect. Those who look into shadows, into
nothing, the probability that man and the
iron sheep riveted onto a rock are more alike
than we'd like to think who can see that
and come back? Who can go forward, but still
not forget that?
I think the world of them.
So, my advice, dear reader? Have your
conversations. Stay up 'til five in the morning.
Just try to get to class on time the next day.
