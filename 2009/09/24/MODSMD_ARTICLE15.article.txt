## HUNTING FOR HISTORY Field hockey on verge of school-record win streak 
### ALISSA HABER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's field hockey team
enters this weekend looking to make history.
The No. 13 Cardinal (7-0,1-0 NorPac) will
attempt to surpass the best start in program his
tory. As of now, the impressive 7-0 debut match
es the 1976 squad's start. This weekend, Stan
ford hopes to stand alone as it takes on confer
ence opponents Pacific (2-5, 1-0 NorPac) on
Friday and California (2-5,0-1 NorPac) on Sun
day.
A sweep of these two games would also tie
the school record for longest winning streak at
any point in a season, which is held by the 1985
team.
This weekend's games will be the second
and third games of league play for the Cardinal,
who easily handled UC-Davis in a 5-1 victory
last week.
Pacific, whom the Cardinal will host Friday
at 7 p.m., joins Stanford with a 1-0 record in
league play after pulling off an impressive upset
over Cal two weeks ago. As the two meet this
Friday, the Cardinal seems to have the advan
tage of history on its side, as the last Tiger win
was on Sept. 30,2006.
The Golden Bears, normally the biggest
league rival for the Cardinal, have been strug
gling considerably this season. With a 2-5
record on the year, they have dropped five con
secutive games, including the loss to Pacific in
their only league game to date. Cal will host
Stanford this Sunday at 1 p.m.
While Stanford seems to have the upper
hand in both contests, senior forward Rachel
Mozenter, who is the reigning NorPac Offen
sive Player of the Week for her hat trick against
UC-Davis, knows that these teams can always
pose a threat.
"We're trying to focus a lot on our own
game," Mozenter said. "Regardless of rankings,
there's always a huge conference rivalry for us
with these teams so they're definitely not to be
overlooked."
This sense of deep rivalry especially holds
true for the Golden Bears. From 2001 to 2007,
the Cardinal dropped 18 straight games to the
Bears. That streak ended when Stanford pulled
a thrilling upset victory in the 2007 NorPac
championship game. Since then, the Cardinal
has taken three of the last four meetings, and
two of those wins have resulted in NorPac titles.

However, as confident as the Cardinal is
against their rivals, the one thing they have not
been able to do in some time is take out the

Bears on their home turf. Stanford has not won
in Berkeley since 1998.
Mozenter knows that this road win may be
one of the biggest of the season not just for
the team's record, but also for its pride,
"Beating Cal on their own field is not only
important to keep up our momentum, but also
for our own peace of mind," she said.
And for the Cardinal, winning on the road
has been one major key to the team's success
this season. Road wins have always been hard
to come by the last time the Cardinal posted
a winning record in away matches was in 2002
(4-3).
Although the Cardinal boasts a solid de
fense, the key to victories this weekend lies in
the continued efforts of what has become a pro
lific offense. Stanford has dominated its oppo
nents in goals (25-6), shots (116-52) and penal
ty corners (58-26). Ten different Cardinal play
ers have at least one goal on the season, and the
offense has scored at least three goals in all but
one game.

According to Mozenter, this recent surge in
offense is something the team has been work
ing on.
"We've definitely been working hard to im
prove our offensive output this year," she said.
"It's something we've struggled with in the
past, so we've focused a lot on valuing our of
fensive opportunities, and finishing and aggres
sion around the cage."
The Cardinal will look to the upperclassman
leadership of Mozenter, who leads the team
with six goals on the season, and junior Jaimee
Erickson, who has four on the year and was
named NorPac Offensive Player of the Week
on Sept. 14 for her game-winning goal in an
overtime upset of lowa.
Stanford is one of only seven teams in Divi
sion I to have an undefeated record.They share
this accomplishment with Connecticut, Cor
nell, Maryland, North Carolina, Rider and Vir
ginia.
