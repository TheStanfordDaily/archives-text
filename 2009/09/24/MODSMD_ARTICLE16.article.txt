# The 						devil plays fantasy football
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
As an avid American
sports fan, I have a
moral obligation to ap
preciate the NFL as
much as, if not more
than Friends, the Victoria's Secret
Fashion Show and Entourage. For
me, Sundays aren't part of the week
end they are the week. See, profes
sional football, although played only
twice a week, is a difficult obsession
to tend to. There comes a point where
a line needs to be drawn, where mem
orizing injury reports, defensive
alignments and Chad Ochocinco's
tweeting schedule should no longer
be acceptable.
However, this shouldn't be an
issue for me. I have no favorite team. I
grew up fairly near the project that is
the Jacksonville Jaguars, and yeah, I'll
give the Jags my support if and when
they decide to make another playoff
run. But to be honest, I am not affect
ed by the outcomes of any NFL
games. I guess aside from being a
Cowboy-hater, I can say emphatically
that I have no true affiliation. I have
never lost sleep over the results of the
Super Bowl and I have never paid for
a ticket to a live game. Yet I am still in
fatuated with the NFL and have taken
the aforementioned line and beaten it
with a shovel, potentially harming my
future in the process. Why?
Fantasy football is ruining my life.

For those who are new to the In
ternet phenomenon that is fantasy
football, I'm sorry. Wikipedia will as
sist me in defining the game I live and
die by: "Fantasy football is a fantasy
sports game in which participants
(called "owners" ) are arranged into a
league. Each team drafts or acquires
via auction a team of real-life Amer
ican football players, and then scores
points based on those players' statis
tical on-the-field performances."
It seems simple enough, but in
order to be successful at the nerd's
version of professional sports, you
need to be insanely dedicated. All
emotional investments in your fa
vorite team must be cast aside. You're

a Giants fan with Tom Brady on your
team? Suck it up, you now have to
cheer for the Patriots' offense. You
fell in love with the Cincinnati Ben
gals while watching Hard Knocks on
HBO? Sick life, but DeDe Dorsey is
as beneficial to your chances of suc
cess as a crystal meth addiction.

But these issues are old news for
me. I've been around the block and
won and lost my fair share of fantasy
leagues. My problem with fantasy
football is more complex than the av
erage bear's. My problem is threefold.
First, fantasy football has con
demned me to hell.There really aren't
any ifs, ands or buts about it. I under
stand that the Ten Commandments
say nothing about the world of cyber
competition, and that Adam wasn't
punished for drafting a kicker in the
fifth round. My issue lies in the fact
that every week, I am possessed by
football Satan and wish nothing but
malice upon my opponent's team. I
won't go into specifics with phrases
that I have muttered under my breath
regarding an opposing team's star
player, but I will tell you that they
often involve the words "foot," "dis
traction" and "lawnmower." I have
never been a religious guy, but yard
work-related injury wishes will prob
ably ensure me a trip south of the bor
der when my time is up.
Second, fantasy football has de
stroyed any intimacy I once had with
my girlfriend. When we first started
dating three years ago, she probably
thought I was cute. I masked my fasci
nation with sports long enough to lure
her in. Then bang, she was smacked
with a dose of reality harder than
Sarah Palin at a Katie Couric inter
view. I'm lucky enough when she
agrees to make a compromise and we
can cuddle while watching football.
But do you want to know what girls
find incredibly un-sexy? Screaming at
the TV that you wished Philip Rivers
would get rabies. She has learned to
deal with me, God bless her soul, but
she still is unable to fully comprehend
the level of immaturity and anger that
accompanies fantasy football owners
(such as me). I can't blame her, but I

can always hope that one day she will
understand.
And third, fantasy football is de
structive to my emotional well
being. I am not programmed to en
dure an outrageous amount of stress.
The actions of 250-pound men who
don't know me from a 1984 Buick
should not affect my happiness on a
regular basis. But they do. For exam
ple, I am one of the lucky few that de
cided to draft Bears' quarterback Jay
Cutler to anchor the passing game of
my team. I even named my squad
"Faith in the Bears" in hopes of su
perstitiously bringing good karma
upon myself and my players. Howev
er, on the opening game of Chicago's
season, Cutler threw four intercep
tions. Four. To add insult to injury,

four of my wisdom teeth were
plucked out two days before, leaving
me with holes in my mouth and holes
in my soul. That night, I took a
painkiller and it wasn't for my
teeth.
Faith in the Bears is in second
place right now, and has a chance to
move into the top spot with a solid
performance this week. Although
my life outside of the live-updating
scoring Web site is progressively de
teriorating, my spirits are up and I'm
eagerly anticipating Sunday. Com
pared to many sports fans, my prob
lems are miniscule, barely scratching
the surface of the thousands of dol
lars of gambling debt accumulated
by drafting Brady with the first pick
last season. In general, the game
won't drive you to the level of lunacy
where my friends and I are currently
residing.
But it is definitely not for the faint
of heart, because sometimes in the
world of fantasy football, life is any

thing but a fantasy.
