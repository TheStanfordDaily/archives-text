# A 						must-win for Stanford football
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
Something strange will hap
pen Saturday night on cam
pus. No, it's not another frat
party, an important speaker
on campus or a student
fundraising event. It's football.
For the first time in an embarrass
ingly long time, Stanford football will
play a truly important home game.
Yes, I know Stanford beat Oregon
State in the season opener last year
and took back the Axe in the Big
Game the year before that.
What separates this game from
the others is the level of expectation
for this season's team. The Cardinal
was not supposed to be good in 2007
or 2008. Beating Cal is always impor
tant, but Stanford failed to make a
bowl game that season.
This year, several college football
analysts predicted Stanford will go
bowling in the winter. Due to its
tough loss at Wake Forest, Stanford
must defeat Washington this Satur
day to have a realistic shot at that
magic sixth win.

Let's do some math. The Cardinal
is currently 2-1. After the UW game,
Stanford plays eight more games, all
against teams with winning records.

As much as I would love to beat
USC and Cal, Stanford cannot realis
tically rely on winning either game to
reach a bowl game. Stanford plays
USC at The Coliseum. Cal's Jahvid
Best, simply put, refuses to be
stopped. Nothing is certain, but I've
never called myself an optimist.
Oregon looked solid in its 31-24
victory over No. 18 Utah, and the
Ducks always have freak athletes
that can make any defense look over
matched, even without the trigger
happy LeGarrette Blount.
Oregon State and the speedy
Jacquizz Rodgers will be a battle for
the Cardinal.The game is in Corvallis,
which doesn't help Stanford. The
only thing that separated OSU from a
Pac-10 championship last year was
the loss to Stanford. The Beavers
have had this game circled since sum
mer camp.

So, that leaves four games against
UCLA, Arizona State and Notre
Dame at home, and against Arizona
on the road.

If Stanford beats UW, it will only
need to win three out of those four
games to become bowl eligible, as
suming no upsets in the tougher four
games. If it loses, it will have to win all
of them.

Now back to the clash at Stanford
Stadium this Saturday at 6 p.m.
Washington is 2-1 on the season.
The Huskies opened the season with
a 31-23 loss against LSU, but looked
impressive in defeat to the power
house Tigers. They then beat Idaho
42-23.

Everyone knows what happened
last week. USC, fresh off its huge vic
tory over Ohio State in the Horse
shoe, walked into Husky Stadium ex
pecting an easy victory and left with
its championship dreams dashed.
Obviously, the Huskies will be
playing with confidence, but that
could be a blessing for the Cardinal.
Think about last week. The Trojans
must have been feeling a tad bit
cocky after knocking off a top-10
Buckeye team. The last thing they
were thinking about was their game
against UW.

The same could be true this week
for Washington. After going 0-12 last
season, Washington is now ranked
and riding high. Up next for the
Huskies after this week? A big
match-up with Notre Dame in South
Bend. I'm willing to bet Washington
is looking past Stanford and getting
ready for the Fighting Irish.
The other big advantage for Stan
ford is that this game will be UW's
first road game of the season. Husky
Stadium is one of the toughest places
to play in all of college football. Any
one watching the USC game last
week could see the cameras literally
shaking as the crowd got into it.
I know enough about Stanford stu
dents and alumni interest in Cardinal
football to know that Stanford Stadi
um will be a far from intimidating
place to play. Washington head coach
Steve Sarkisian expects the same, as
he turned down the music at practice
to prepare for the quiet atmosphere
at Stanford Stadium. The fans who do
show up, though, will be treated to a
rarity: an important home game.
Ibe stakes are high and the conse
quences could be enormous. It's only
Week Four, but the season could
hinge on Saturday night's outcome.
Stanford could always pull off a cou
ple upsets and turn in a seven-, eight
or nine-win season.
That said, I would still feel a lot
more comfortable with a victory
against Washington.

Mike Lazarus will make sure Stan
ford Stadium isn't quiet Saturday
night. Help him get rowdy at mlazarus
