## Guidelines for parties revamped New system of categories; clearer rules for Facebook 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
Beginning this quarter, campus parties
will operate under new guidelines that
aim to clarify planning and regulations.
Devised in collaboration between stu
dent leaders, the Alcohol Advisory Board
(AAB) and Student Activities &
Leadership (SAL), the revised guidelines
received formal approval from Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman in late August. Students were
the main impetus for the reform effort,
reaching out to SAL last academic year in
its prior incarnation as the Office of
Student Affairs (OSA).

Boardman commented in a memo
randum giving final acceptance to the
changes that he was "especially pleased
that students initiated this process and
prompted this change which should ben
efit all student organizations interested in
hosting social events."
The most significant shift is organiza
tional, with the separation of oversight of
Greek and non-Greek parties. All Greek
party consultation and notification will
now take place with Residential
Education (ResEd), through the Row
ResEd Office. SAL, which in its previous
form as OSA had worked with a broader
range of parties, will now handle only
non-Greek parties. SAL has had a reduc
tion in its available staffing, and according
to Director Nanci Howe, the change in
responsibilities was appropriate.
Also shifting are the types of parties
recognized. The new party planning sys
tem has five categories: "Members,"
"Invite Only," "All-Campus," "Off-
Campus" and "Stanford Students &
Other Colleges."
Four of the categories are analogous
to previous "levels" in the old system of
guidelines. The new entry is "Invite Only,"
while prior Level 1, "private event by
individual host," is now no longer listed
among the guidelines.
Central to the remade party-planning
guidelines, "Invite Only" sits between a
smaller "Members Only" party and an
"All-campus" party, intended to fit the
character of many common campus par
ties. With a requirement that notice of the
party must be given seven days in
advance, the category allows any invited
member to bring up to three guests, and
the party to include adjoining outdoor
