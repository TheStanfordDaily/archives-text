# STUDENT LIFE
## Guidelines for parties revamped New system of categories; clearer rules for Facebook 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
Beginning this quarter, campus parties
will operate under new guidelines that
aim to clarify planning and regulations.
Devised in collaboration between stu
dent leaders, the Alcohol Advisory Board
(AAB) and Student Activities &
Leadership (SAL), the revised guidelines
received formal approval from Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman in late August. Students were
the main impetus for the reform effort,
reaching out to SAL last academic year in
its prior incarnation as the Office of
Student Affairs (OSA).

Boardman commented in a memo
randum giving final acceptance to the
changes that he was "especially pleased
that students initiated this process and
prompted this change which should ben
efit all student organizations interested in
hosting social events."
The most significant shift is organiza
tional, with the separation of oversight of
Greek and non-Greek parties. All Greek
party consultation and notification will
now take place with Residential
Education (ResEd), through the Row
ResEd Office. SAL, which in its previous
form as OSA had worked with a broader
range of parties, will now handle only
non-Greek parties. SAL has had a reduc
tion in its available staffing, and according
to Director Nanci Howe, the change in
responsibilities was appropriate.
Also shifting are the types of parties
recognized. The new party planning sys
tem has five categories: "Members,"
"Invite Only," "All-Campus," "Off-
Campus" and "Stanford Students &
Other Colleges."
Four of the categories are analogous
to previous "levels" in the old system of
guidelines. The new entry is "Invite Only,"
while prior Level 1, "private event by
individual host," is now no longer listed
among the guidelines.
Central to the remade party-planning
guidelines, "Invite Only" sits between a
smaller "Members Only" party and an
"All-campus" party, intended to fit the
character of many common campus par
ties. With a requirement that notice of the
party must be given seven days in
advance, the category allows any invited
member to bring up to three guests, and
the party to include adjoining outdoor
spaces. Mixed drinks are not allowed at
these events.

In addition to the new category,
specific rules and regulations for all
categories have now been made more
clear and straightforward. Planning
requirements that apply in all cases
have been expanded, and the specific
differences between party levels have
been emphasized and presented in a
more accessible fashion.

Also integral to the planning
changes is the implementation of
strict guidelines for Internet adver
tisement on social networking sites
like Facebook, accompanying tradi
tional restrictions on fliers and ban
ners. "Members" and "Invite Only"
parties must only be advertised on a
"secret Stanford network" that is,
a closed invite not visible to all
Stanford network members; they also
must not advertise in print. "All

Campus" and "Off-Campus" parties
are allowed to advertise in print on
campus, but must restrict their
Internet advertisements to the
Stanford network.

AAB Co-Chair and Manager of
Substance Abuse Prevention Ralph
Castro said the prior regulations were
inadequate for treating the online
component of party planning.
According to Castro, the core of the
guidelines had not changed since the
early 19905.

"The advent of the Internet, the
use of computers now being wide
spread, cell phones electronic com
munication in general has changed,"
Castro said. "Now, a lot of it is word of
mouth, but it is done electronically.

"It was kind of a mess," he added,
referring to the old Facebook policy.
Administrators highlighted the
crucial role students and their
expressed needs played in the
process. "We knew that the initiative
had come from students wanting bet
ter flexibility, and we wanted to better
serve students and so we wanted to be
able to offer them what they were ask

ing for," Castro said. "I think that was a
positive side. I think everybody was on
board with modifying and expanding
the level system, just to better accom
modate where we're at in 2009."
Student leaders and senators were
involved in the push for the change.
Senator Zachary Johnson 'lO credited
Greek leaders and concerned individ
uals with assisting in the effort.
"Pressure has been mounting for a
long time," he said.
Johnson said the changes were for
the better, and he was optimistic that
more campus parties would be able to
be held due to the streamlined process.
"Over the last couple of years, it
became increasingly from an adminis
trative and student groups standpoint
that there needed to be changes," he
said.

"The new party levels are a huge
improvement in campus life," he con
tinued. "Even with the Web site and
documentation before, it wasn't really
clear [what the guidelines were]."
