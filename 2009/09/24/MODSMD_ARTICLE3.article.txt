defend the U.S. and its European allies against
nuclear threats emanating from Iran.
President Barack Obama's decision to scrap
the Bush administration's missile defense pro
gram was based on the recommendation of his
national security team, senior military leaders
and various academics. Senior research scientist
Dean Wilkening, political science Prof David
Holloway and management science and engi
neering Prof. Siegfried Hecker of Stanford

University's Freeman Spogli Institute were
among notable scholars who influenced the
Obama administration's enhanced strategy,
which is forecasted to begin stage one in 2011
and finish with fourth stage in 2020.
The Bush administration originally aimed to
install a missile shield system in the Czech
Republic and in Poland to answer the threat of
Iranian intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs). But recent findings in academia and

A significant foreign policy move by the
Obama administration has strong roots in the
work of Stanford scholars.
During last week's press briefing, Secretary
of Defense Robert Gates and General James
Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, presented a four-stage plan that will better

military intelligence have argued that interme
diate- and short-range missiles present a greater
threat to American security.
Spurred by his interest in ballistic missile
defense, Wilkening performed an analysis on
alterative options to the Bush administration's
strategy. Wilkening conducted his study with
funding from the Mac Arthur Foundation and
presented his results to officials in Washington,
including some former Stanford faculty who
now serve in government.

"It was only a part of the administration's
decision," Wilkening said of his research. "But I
think, for some people, it really caused them to
rethink the efficacy of the Polish-Czech system.
"My analysis was probably one of the more
visible ones because it was unclassified," he
added. "It started at Stanford it's all open
source information."

Likewise, a recent report by Holloway and
Hecker reached the ears of government offi
cials.

"They were interested in this study, which is
a joint Russian-American study," Holloway
explained. "We gave briefings [for] senior offi
cials in Washington and in Moscow early in the
year on the results of our work."
Holloway's and Hecker's report was spon
sored by the East West Institute in New York
and was published this past May. Their
research indicated that the threat from Iranian
long-range missiles was not the most pressing
concern, as the Bush administration previous
ly believed.
"The most important threat was from short
and medium-range systems that could reach
targets in the Middle East and in southern parts
of Europe and in some parts of Russia,"
Holloway said.
Wilkening similarly stated that the Bush
administration's "Polish-Czech system was
designed originally to defend the United States
from [a] hypothetical ICBM threat."

He further noted that current officials have
made a prudent choice in redirecting their
attention to intermediate- and short-range mis
siles from Iran.

"They've emphasized essentially systems
that can be deployed closer to the Middle East,
which was one of the things I was recommend
ing," Wilkening said. "You get more effective
defense of Europe if you deploy these assets
closer to the Middle East. Whether it's on land

"My analysis was probably one of the more visible."

or on naval platforms doesn't particu
larly matter."
Equally important, Obama's
restructured missile defense plan is
more readily deployable.
Commenting on the first phase of
the President's restructured strategy,
Wilkening said: "If you want to deploy
an interceptor soon, then you want it
to be the most effective one we have
in our inventory and it'd be the
Standard Missile 3 Block IA."

Wilkening also commended the
Obama administration for looking
into technologically advanced air
borne sensors and considering larger
raid sizes in the event of a nuclear
attack.

He pointed out that countries with
nuclear capabilities, like Iran, are not
likely to launch their missiles.
"But in any case, if they ever
choose to do that, they wouldn't
launch one or two," Wilkening cau
tioned. "They would launch 10 if they
had them... And so the architecture
that was proposed by Obama is being
designed specifically to handle larger
raid sizes."

Holloway similarly believes
Obama's plan is "a very good deci
sion." He further added that Obama's
changes to the country's missile
defense system will open doors for
cooperation with Russia, a topic the
administration has tried to evade.

Holloway acknowledged that
there are always challenges and
imperfections in missile defense poli
cy. "I think missile defense is still an
extremely difficult undertaking," he

said. "The new system will have to
deal with some of the main issues in
missile defense, the most important
being target discrimination, which is to
pick out the right target from decoys
and other materials when they travel
in the near-vacuum of space."
Both Holloway and Wilkening
hope their research will continue to
receive wide circulation in the aca
demic and political arenas.
"I hope to continue working on
missile defense," Wilkening said.
"Whether the Obama administration
cares to listen to me or not is another
matter. I'm thankful that they did in
the past, but we'll see in the future."
