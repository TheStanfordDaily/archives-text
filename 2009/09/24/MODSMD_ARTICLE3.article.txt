nuclear threats emanating from Iran.
President Barack Obama's decision to scrap
the Bush administration's missile defense pro
gram was based on the recommendation of his
national security team, senior military leaders
and various academics. Senior research scientist
Dean Wilkening, political science Prof David
Holloway and management science and engi
neering Prof. Siegfried Hecker of Stanford

University's Freeman Spogli Institute were
among notable scholars who influenced the
Obama administration's enhanced strategy,
which is forecasted to begin stage one in 2011
and finish with fourth stage in 2020.
The Bush administration originally aimed to
install a missile shield system in the Czech
Republic and in Poland to answer the threat of
Iranian intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs). But recent findings in academia and

A significant foreign policy move by the
Obama administration has strong roots in the
work of Stanford scholars.
During last week's press briefing, Secretary
of Defense Robert Gates and General James
Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, presented a four-stage plan that will better

military intelligence have argued that interme
diate- and short-range missiles present a greater
threat to American security.
Spurred by his interest in ballistic missile
defense, Wilkening performed an analysis on
alterative options to the Bush administration's
strategy. Wilkening conducted his study with
funding from the Mac Arthur Foundation and
presented his results to officials in Washington,
including some former Stanford faculty who
now serve in government.

"It was only a part of the administration's
decision," Wilkening said of his research. "But I
think, for some people, it really caused them to
rethink the efficacy of the Polish-Czech system.
"My analysis was probably one of the more
visible ones because it was unclassified," he
added. "It started at Stanford it's all open
source information."

Likewise, a recent report by Holloway and
Hecker reached the ears of government offi
cials.

"They were interested in this study, which is
a joint Russian-American study," Holloway
explained. "We gave briefings [for] senior offi
cials in Washington and in Moscow early in the
year on the results of our work."
Holloway's and Hecker's report was spon
sored by the East West Institute in New York
and was published this past May. Their
research indicated that the threat from Iranian
long-range missiles was not the most pressing
concern, as the Bush administration previous
ly believed.
"The most important threat was from short
and medium-range systems that could reach
targets in the Middle East and in southern parts
of Europe and in some parts of Russia,"
Holloway said.
Wilkening similarly stated that the Bush
administration's "Polish-Czech system was
designed originally to defend the United States
from [a] hypothetical ICBM threat."

He further noted that current officials have
made a prudent choice in redirecting their
attention to intermediate- and short-range mis
siles from Iran.

"They've emphasized essentially systems
that can be deployed closer to the Middle East,
which was one of the things I was recommend
ing," Wilkening said. "You get more effective
defense of Europe if you deploy these assets
closer to the Middle East. Whether it's on land

"My analysis was probably one of the more visible."
