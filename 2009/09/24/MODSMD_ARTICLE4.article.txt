## Stanford, U. Chicago seek better bulimia treatments

While the binge-purge rhythm of adolescent
bulimia nervosa (BN) often begins slowly, doc
tors could never identify how to best treat the
disease before the destructive behavior spun out
of control a challenge that a new study hopes
to overcome.
Researchers at the Stanford School of
Medicine and the University of Chicago are
conducting the largest-ever randomized con

ment models cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-based therapy and individual psychother
apy â€” to determine which is most effective in
treating adolescents. They hope the study will
yield clear guidelines about the treatment of
choice for the adolescent patient population.
Where prior bulimia-treatment trials focused
mainly on adults, Dr. Daniel le Grange, director
of the Eating Disorders Program at the
University of Chicago and the study's principal

investigator at Chicago, emphasized this study
sets a precedent with its focus and scope.
"Only one randomized controlled treatment
study for adolescents with BN has been con
ducted in the U.S. that's it," le Grange said in
an email to The Daily. "So this collaborative
study is only the second treatment trial for this
patient population. It's also the largest, and com
pares the two treatments, family-based and cog
nitive-behavioral, for which there are some indi

The treatments in this current study will take

different approaches to the patients' behaviors
and thinking patterns, which include binge-eat

Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on
changing the patient's behavior and thoughts
toward food and body image, dispelling his or
