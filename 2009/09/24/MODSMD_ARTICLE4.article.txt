## Stanford, U. Chicago seek better bulimia treatments 
### JANE LEPHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the binge-purge rhythm of adolescent
bulimia nervosa (BN) often begins slowly, doc
tors could never identify how to best treat the
disease before the destructive behavior spun out
of control a challenge that a new study hopes
to overcome.
Researchers at the Stanford School of
Medicine and the University of Chicago are
conducting the largest-ever randomized con

trolled trial of bulimia treatments for adoles
cents, comparing three current outpatient treat
ment models cognitive behavioral therapy,
family-based therapy and individual psychother
apy â€” to determine which is most effective in
treating adolescents. They hope the study will
yield clear guidelines about the treatment of
choice for the adolescent patient population.
Where prior bulimia-treatment trials focused
mainly on adults, Dr. Daniel le Grange, director
of the Eating Disorders Program at the
University of Chicago and the study's principal

investigator at Chicago, emphasized this study
sets a precedent with its focus and scope.
"Only one randomized controlled treatment
study for adolescents with BN has been con
ducted in the U.S. that's it," le Grange said in
an email to The Daily. "So this collaborative
study is only the second treatment trial for this
patient population. It's also the largest, and com
pares the two treatments, family-based and cog
nitive-behavioral, for which there are some indi
cations of efficacy."
The treatments in this current study will take

different approaches to the patients' behaviors
and thinking patterns, which include binge-eat
ing, vomiting and subsequent guilt over loss of
control.

Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on
changing the patient's behavior and thoughts
toward food and body image, dispelling his or
her overemphasis on weight in order to put an
end to destructive dieting. Family therapy relies
heavily on parental involvement, with the goal
of changing the home environment to
emphasize healthy eating rather than
dieting. And individual psychotherapy
seeks to help the patient examine
underlying life problems, such as
depression or abuse, which might have
contributed to this negative self-image.
While cognitive behavioral therapy
is widely recognized as the preferred
bulimia treatment for adults, family
therapy is often used for adolescents
with anorexia nervosa. Individual psy
chotherapy has also been effective as
an alternate treatment for bulimic
adults and teens.

Although the study has been tout
ed as the first of its kind to compare the
three treatment models to determine
efficacy, Dr. James Lock, professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences at
the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
and Stanford's principal investigator,
explained that how groundbreaking
the study will be depends on what the
research team finds.

"If we are able to provide clear
clinical guidance on an evidence-based
treatment for adolescent BN, it will be
groundbreaking as there is almost no
specific guidance at this point," he said
in an email to The Daily.

Lock also elaborated that the two
existing studies of adolescent bulimia
had contradictory findings. "One

found family therapy more useful than
individual therapy; the other found no
outcome differences between family
therapy and individual therapy," he
said.
The study has a five-year timeline.
"We plan to recruit for a little over
three years and provide treatments to
158 adolescents with BN between 12
and 18 years of age," he said. "We
began recruitment in January of this
year, so results are several years off"
"Participants will be recruited from
the clinical programs at Chicago and
Stanford and their communities," le
Grange added.
Lock also mentioned that Stanford
and University of Chicago students are
eligible if they are under 19 years old
and have family nearby who can par
ticipate if assigned randomly to family
therapy.
The research team hopes to enroll
158 participants overall, with 79 at each
site, where each participant will be ran
domly assigned to one of the three
treatments. According to Brittany
Alvey, research assistant and the
study's secondary contact at Stanford,
participants will then be assigned to a
therapist who conducts the treatment
to which they are assigned, which
includes 18 sessions over six months,
free of charge.
"What's interesting," Alvey said, "is
that aside from the psychological
issues with bulimia, there is also a
strong medical component to it,"
stressing the importance that all partic
ipants be medically covered.

"This is also about training them
about the need to see a doctor regular
ly," she added.
While Alvey mentioned that bulim
ia can be identified by an electrolyte
imbalance, which is caused by constant
purging, she said it is often very diffi
cult to find people with bulimia.
"It's not easy to spot, and it's very
hard for teachers or even parents to
pick up, because people with bulimia
usually have normal weight or they
may even be a little heavier," Alvey
said. "It's definitely harder to spot
than anorexia and very hard to
recruit. Parents might not even know
about it."
