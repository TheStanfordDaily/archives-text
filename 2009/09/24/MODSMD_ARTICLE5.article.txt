# Baidu founder talks business
## 
### ALAN GUO STAFF WRITER 
A packed Hewlett Auditorium hosted Robin Li,
co-founder of the Chinese search engine Baidu, on
Wednesday night.
A household name to hundreds of millions of
Chinese Internet users, Baidu is outperforming
global giants like Google and Yahoo in China.
In front of an audience of 500 students, faculty
and outside visitors, Li retold the story of Baidu,
talked about his vision for the company and
encouraged students to seek opportunities both at
his firm and in the world of Chinese business.
Li also gave no pretense about the purpose of
his visit, which was to recruit talents from Stanford
and the Silicon Valley. He cited the experience of
Baidu as an example of the opportunities that exist
in the Chinese marketplace.
"There are many opportunities for top talents in
China, because there is a growing and booming tech
industry," Li said. "It is great for people who want to
use technology to change the world."
He talked about the history and success of
Baidu as an example of opportunities and success

ful entrepreneurship in China.
Li, who worked in Silicon Valley for a few years
at an early search engine called Info Seek, made the
decision to return to China in 2000 to build a search
engine for the blossoming cyberspace industry.
By 2001, Baidu.com was officially launched.
"We found what was right for the company
there and then," Li said.
The rapid growth and success of the company
led to the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of the com
pany on NASDAQ in 2005. Since its creation,
Baidu has increased its share of the Chinese search
market to 76 percent.
Li cited these changes as evidence that big
opportunities existed and still exist in China.
He also introduced his vision for Baidu called
"Box Computing" to the audience. Citing the inspi
ration of this concept as coming from the types of
queries Baidu received, such as "a great song,"
"where can I find a girlfriend in Beijing" and "what
kind of college fits for a shy, introverted guy like
myself" Li said they reflect the expectations of
users that a search engine will expand in functional
ity.
"Everything is about search Amazon,

Twitter, Facebook but [we] want to integrate
them into one box: an intelligent search that con
nects what the user's input to the function or appli
cation they desire," Li said.
For entrepreneurs aspiring to their own success,

Robin Li, co-founder of Baidu, the Chinese search
engine, was on hand at Hewlett Auditorium last
night in front of a capacity audience. Li spoke
mainly of his life and principles of entrepreneurship.
Li's advice was simple: Find what you
like and what you are good at. Then
do it and stick with it.

The lecture was well-received by a
variety of students.
"Although I am not a computer
person, his entrepreneurial spirit still
makes me feel inspired," said Lin
Wang, a post-doctoral student in biol
ogy from China.
"I learned that there are opportu
nities in China," added Rowan
Chakoumakos 'l3. "The concept of
learning entrepreneurship from suc
cessful entrepreneurs is great."
