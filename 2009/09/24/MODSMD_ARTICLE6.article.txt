## Senior Nights proceed with waivers in hand 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Mourning the loss of Full Moon on
the Quad, seniors are guaranteed that
at least one tradition is safe... for
now.
Senior Nights, discontinued briefly
last year due to hospitalizations and
vomiting on buses, are making their
2009-2010 debut tonight at Illusions
Supper Club in Palo Alto.
But with difficult budget cuts and
the stench of vomit still fresh in organ
izers' minds, these Senior Nights will
feature some notable changes. Seniors
this week learned that they all must
sign a waiver and receive a sticker in
order to board the buses.
"The last year Senior Nights were

stopped because people were puking
on the buses, and that's 500 dollars
each time," said senior class Co-presi
dent Ansaf Kareem 'lO. "The adminis
tration was unhappy, and they had to
make different plans to deal with
that."

Their solution was to create a
"Senior Night Participation
Agreement," which, among other
things, spelled out the $5OO fine for
individuals who, according to the waiv
er, "cause any damage to the bus (such
as vomiting or vandalism)."
"One thing we do want to stress is
the seniors to practice safe consump
tion of alcohol," Kareem said. "The
waiver is an insurance policy that we
accept responsibility."
Seniors have been asked to sign
the waiver in White Plaza from 7 to 9
p.m. Wednesday night or 11 a.m. until
1 p.m. Thursday. Over 250 students
had signed the waiver as of
Wednesday night, said Senior Cabinet
member Christopher Khavarian 'lO.
Sumil Thapa 'lO thought the
process was straightforward. "I found
out through all the emails and it was
clear," he said.
While there was a crowd at 7 p.m.,
for the remainder of the night seniors
approached the empty table in groups
of two or three.

Some asked a couple of questions,
but most just signed the waiver with
barely a glance.

David Kim 'lO was one of the few
who took a copy of the agreement
with him "just so they don't charge
me for something I didn't do."
The fine, he said, was reasonable.
"I think it'll make people think twice
before they drink more than they can
handle,"

The senior class presidents were
hopeful that this year's senior nights
will go as planned. The biggest chal
lenge, they said, was not the waivers,
but rather the reduced budget.
"What we're doing is getting dif
ferent groups to fund senior nights,"
said senior class Co-president Walter
Foxworth 'lO. "We're looking for
more creative solutions."
Foxworth and Kareem stress that
Senior Nights are not in jeopardy,
although they are still in the process
of finding alternative funding sources.
"It's important to note that we have
senior nights planned through the
quarter," Foxworth said, although the
organizers are "taking it one week at
a time."

Even with the changes, the class
presidents expect a large turnout.
They switched the venue from
Rudy's, with a capacity of 140, to
Illusions, which can house 700.

"This may be one of the first pub
nights on the first week of school" in
recent history, Foxworth said.
To those worried about funding
issues, Kareem assured there's noth
ing to fear: "We'll make it happen," he
said.
