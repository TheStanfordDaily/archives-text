## One of the Freshman 15 Ashley Lyle '13 selected as college ambassador for Seventeen magazine 
### CHELSEA MA DESK EDITOR 
Ashley Lyle 'l3 will become a familiar
face to teenage girls this year.
Lyle was chosen as one of Seventeen maga
zine's "Freshman 15." Every week, 15 girls from 15
colleges across the U.S. document their first year
via blogs, videos and photos. Topics range from
college admission tips to profiles on "campus
cuties" spotted by the girls themselves.
"[Seventeen] sent me a video camera where I
can do videos and photos," Lyle explained. "I pret
ty much just walk around and go up to somebody
and say, 'Hey, I'm with Seventeen would you be
interested in doing an interview?' I haven't really
gotten anybody that's said, 'No I don't want to do
it.'"

The girls also post longer monthly videos that
address more serious college issues and have
Q&A sessions with readers through Skype.
"The purpose of [the] program is to show our
readers what college life is really like," said
Meghan Foye, Seventeen's deputy editor. "We
take them behind the scenes to all the parties,
roommate drama, even the hookup scene, so
they're better prepared when entering their first
year of school."

So far, Lyle has shared college shopping tips
stemming from her hectic move from Memphis,
Tenn. to California as well as ways to coordi
nate for chic bedding. And, of course, she had to
mention the Stanford Band.

"My latest blog was about the football game,
and I was just talking about how unconventional
the Band is," Lyle said. "They're not your normal
college marching band. And it shows how even
though Stanford's a top school, it's very liberal
not a stuffy, eastern Ivy."

Lyle and the 14 other girls were introduced in
Seventeen's October issue, where they were quoted.

"[My quote] was on rejecting the notion about
going to a dream college, because a lot of the time
you can adapt to any atmosphere go to any
community and feel comfortable," she said. "I
had to think like that because I was applying to a
lot of schools other people didn't get into. Ed
rather be surprised, happy and appreciative like I
was then."

The October issue also featured a Halloween
photo and quotes from students Olivia Lange 'l2,
Max Markham 'l2, Salina Truong 'l2, Alyssa
Baldocchi 'll, John McCallen 'O9 and Raymond
Braun 'l2 due to the efforts of Braun, who was an
editorial intern at Seventeen this summer. Braun
was also heavily involved in the Freshman 15
application process, serving as casting director.
"Along with a few other interns, I watched all of
the video submissions Seventeen received and was
ultimately responsible for putting together a 'slate'
of approximately 40 girls to pitch to my boss,"
Braun explained.

Braun added that the program was looking for
girls who were not only "natural, upbeat, articu
late, creative, funny, passionate and talented," but
also, well, real.

"Since the Freshman 15 serve as Seventeen's
college ambassadors, it was so important that they
be extremely diverse and relatable," he said. "We
want every girl who picks up a copy of the maga
zine to feel like she can relate to at least one girl in
the Freshman 15 class. For that reason, I also con
sidered how each girl would fit into the bigger pic
ture and add something new and fresh to the mix."
Applicants who made it to the second round
created videos responding to the prompt: "In one
minute, introduce yourself and show us why you'd
be a great member of the Freshman 15."
"I danced at the beginning, talked really fast in
the middle, and I sang at the end," said Lyle, who
applied on a whim April of her senior year of high
school.
According to Foye, Lyle shined from the begin
ning.
"We loved her video immediately because she's

super high energy think Oreos and Red Bull,"
Foye said. "She's busting a move to Soulja Boy at
the beginning and bursts in to song at the end!
"I think we were hooked from the very begin
ning and excited to see what would happen to her
at Stanford so we knew readers would be, too,"
she added.

Contestants who reached the final round
answered personal questions ranging from their
most embarrassing high school moments to what
they expect out of college. They were also required
to send in a few photos and tips for college admis
sions. Lyle sent more than a few.
"I sent about 25 pictures for them," she said.
"And I sent 20 tips for college. I actually read mul
tiple books on college admissions, so I had a lot to
talk about."

Lyle's personality certainly serves her well in
the realm of communications, which she plans to
major in. And although she just moved her things
into Ujamaa a little over a week ago, she's already
feeling what Stanford's all about.
"I just really feel like Stanford's one of those
all-around schools," she said. "It gives you the
opportunity to pursue your passions and pursue
what interests you.

"You also learn to be happy and not to be rich,
but in the process you can get rich," she joked.
She seems to have the next four years laid out
a job at the Career Development Center,
involvement in marketing and business clubs and a
potential senior thesis relating to African
American studies. But, in the meantime, she'll con
tinue posting updates on Seventeen's Web site
until the academic year ends a hefty commit
ment.

"I take Sunday and Monday off, otherwise I
carry my camera everyday," she said.
But with a $250 paycheck every three months,
mentor status for teens nationwide and a valid
excuse to chat up those "campus cuties," for Lyle
it's well worth it.
