% V begins one of a
number of blog
posts on the Testimonies at Stanford
Web site, designed by Stanford
Christians Osagie Igbeare 'll and
Clare Kasemset 'O9.
Igbeare and Kasemset, both
members of the Chi Alpha Christian
fellowship at Stanford, launched the
Web site in March to provide
Stanford students with a faith-based
forum for sharing specific experi
ences of God in their lives.
Igbeare himself grew up in a
church, but had always relegated
God to services on Sundays. Soon,
however, Igbeare's relationship and
perception of God took on a more
encompassing nature.
"When I was relatively young, I
just saw God in a real way," Igbeare
said. "He helped me out with a prob
lem I was having. Of course, that rev
elation didn't make me all of a sud
den 'Mr. Godly,' but after it I started
to study the Bible and learn
Scriptures."
Experiences like Igbeare's are
similar to the testimonies found on
the Web site. The changes to his life
weren't excessively drastic, but
helped to strengthen his belief in
Christianity.
"Essentially I felt that people
should be able to see God working
in other people's lives," he said. "It
gives people the opportunity to see
God for who He is."

Igbeare teamed up with
Kasemset, a computer science major,
to work on the testimonies Web site.
They settled on creating a site with a
blog-post format where members
could share and comment on other
members' experiences.
A compelling facet of the site,
beyond posting and perusing testi
monies, is that visitors can contact
previous contributors to the site to
talk and ask questions about their
testimonies. All members leave their
contact information after posting a
testimony on the site to encourage
such discussions.

Initially the Web site was only
made available to Stanford students,
a measure taken to ensure site visi
tors of the sincerity behind each tes
timony.

"It's great to have a site like this,
where it's all Stanford people,
because there's more truth, it's hon
est and there's real conversation,"
Kasemset said.
Recently, Igbeare and Kasemset
have opened up the Web site to the
general public to allow more people
to see it. The conversation-orientat
ed approach and validity of the testi
monies, however, are still maintained
through the contact information that
contributors leave on the site,
"I posted the first testimony on
the site," said John Silcox 'O9. "Since
then I've been able to go back and
read the other testimonies, which
have been very useful."
More recently, Igbeare and fellow
members from Chi Alpha volun
teered for mission work in San
Francisco. While providing assis
tance to disadvantaged residents in
tenements, Igbeare was able to
inspire them to greater faith.
"We met this one guy there and
were able to really encourage him
and give feedback," Igbeare said.
"And that's the heart. He had a rela
tionship with Christ that we were
able to encourage."
The same concept of conversa
tion about the relationship with God
in one's life applies to the Web site,
according to Igbeare.
People interested in sharing their
experiences with God and hearing
others' testimonies need not stop at
the Web site alone, however.
Kasemset encourages truly curious
people to try participating in small

Bible reading and faith
discussion groups.
"I was part of a small
Bible readings group of
five people in my last two
quarters at Stanford,"
Kasemset said. "Since it
was so small and close,
we were able to have
really profound conver
sations and ask ques-

tions. That's really one of the most
important things a Christian can do."
In addition, people can search
the Internet for answers to their
faith questions from many of the
insightful contributors to religious
Web sites, said Kasemset. And to
that end, the Stanford Testimonies
Web site recreates the more inti
mate nature of a small faith discus
sion group.
"It's really interesting to see a
Web site like this on campus,"
Kasemset said. "Stanford is such a
secular, skeptical environment. And
then you have this Web site that's the
opposite of that; it's like 'boom!'
honest faith-based discussion."
Despite the faith-fueled nature of
the site, Igbeare still wants to ensure
people don't get carried away or
take back the wrong message.
"We don't want to misrepresent
Christ," Igbeare said. "We just want
to show Him for who He actually is
and see if people think He's what
Christians claim He is."
