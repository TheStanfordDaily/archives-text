## WAXWORKS AND ROUSTABOUTS "How it is written" 
### P.G. Mann 
My summer bath had just gone from
tepid to fart-warm, when I heard a
rustling at the door.
I assumed it was the village hoodlums, no
doubt angling for a peek at my unrobed flesh
beneath the crack. "Fie, horse thieves!" I
shouted, sheltering my nether regions be
hind my well-worn copy of "Eat, Pray,
Love," "Away with your wretched tom
peepery!" To my chagrin, it was the mail
man. Said he had an important delivery for
me, marked urgent from the Oval Office. It
read: "Get out of that sordid tub and do
something for your country! War is still rag
ing, health care still failing, and there you are
shriveled as a washerwoman, searching for
enlightenment, aroma therapy and a fab
recipe for pesto. Your nation needs you.
Take up that pen and write on a weekly basis,
until your stomach bleeds! Sincerely, Barack
Obama, the President."
Right away, I had a sneaking suspicion
that the letter was not actually from Barack
Obama, but my grandpa. He's always talking
about doing things until your stomach
bleeds. Seemed like a dead give-away. Only
after I stuffed the letter down the drain did it
occur to me that my grandpa was no longer
living. An ulcer took him from us five years
ago. Which meant the letter really was from
the President!
In a panic I fished it out, but all the ink
had been washed away. All that remained
was a sequence of letters that formed the
nonsensical words "Stanford Daily." I took
this as an auspicious sign, searched the Inter
net for direction and was guided to the very
publication you now hold in your hands. I
swore on the American flag and the pickled
remains of my grandfather's anomalous
organ that I would write for this "Stanford
Daily" until the blood gushed from my
innards.

At the time, I was mystified by this
strange series of events. Only later did I
piece it all together. There is a chance that
one Zed Shwarma, alleged student and opin
ions editor at the "Stanford Daily," wrote the
note on the back of a sheet of Stanford Daily
stationary as a sick joke, hoping to swindle
me into submitting a weekly column to his
section of the newspaper. But the more like
ly scenario is that my grandfather's ghost
blackmailed President Barack Obama into
writing the letter, and Obama, to avoid ru
mors that he was being haunted by my
grandpa, set Shwarma up as the patsy.
Either way, I've been roped into this writ
ing business if you can call it that. I always
thought writers were scandalously rich and
famous, dated movie stars, and drew tens of

thousands of adoring bare-chested fans to
watch them kick a ball around a field for 90
minutes in matching shorts and socks. It
turns out none of this is true. Well, at least as
a writer you get to eat donuts all day, ride
around in a car with loud sirens and shoot
bad guys, right? Nope, The lies we teach our
children...
So, what is it really like practicing the
world's oldest profession? Well, for starters,
you have to wake up at 5 a.m. because that's
when the creditors in Delaware start calling.
This is not so bad, since I can use the steady
rhythm of the phone rings to structure my
work day. For example, rings 1-100, scream
into pillow. Rings 100-200, eat breakfast.
Rings 200-1,000, prepare to write. Rings
1,000-1,500, cry into pillow. And at ring
1,500,1 dry my eyes and wet my throat with
gin.
And that's when the real writing starts. I
often do my best writing completely uncon
scious. Sure, sometimes I wake up in a black
linen sack full of tarantulas in a cemetery
outside Juarez. Occasionally, I receive mail
from the Navy demanding recompense for a
battleship I have no recollection of sinking.
And there is the infrequent coming-to in the
white light of the airport detention cell after
having removed my pants mid-flight. But
every time, I emerge with a column of limpid
prose written in gravy stains on my under
shirt. If only my cleaning lady would stop
washing my undershirts, I'd have some truly
great writing to offer you.
Meanwhile, I'll keep spending hours star
ing into the abyss of my soul reflected in the
computer screen, listening to my wife nag
me about how she doesn't like to be called
my cleaning lady and wondering what in the
world this job has to do with getting paid to
have sex with strangers. I'll add word after
excruciating word, and pray to a hybrid deity
of President Obama and my deceased
grandpa that it see fit sooner rather than
later to fill my stomach with blood.
Until then, I hope you enjoy this column!
