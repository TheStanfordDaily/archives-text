# THE GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## The Farm, global responsibility and your education
### Shelley Gao 
In his 2009 Commencement speech,
Supreme Court Justice Anthony
Kennedy '5B focused on the responsibil
ities of a Stanford education. He called
upon graduates to spread the rule of law
around the world. In his address, Kennedy
urged students to devote their careers to
promoting justice, that "with our own free
dom comes the duty to make the case for
others."

Some thought the speech was rather
lackluster. They argued that Justice
Kennedy attempted to convey an idea that
has already been more persuasively ad
vanced. However, it was a refreshing change
from the traditional "feel good" graduation
addresses on overcoming failure and find
ing happiness. It was a speech about duty. At
Stanford, we are accustomed to speaking
about rights. It is time to expand the dis
course. A Stanford education is a great priv
ilege, and this privilege comes with the im
perative to contribute toward social better
ment through public service.
Earning a degree at Stanford is a signifi
cant investment. It involves not only our
parents, who made sacrifices to make our at
tendance possible, but also generations of
Stanford alumni and donors who have sup
ported our education by increasing the en
dowment, constructing new buildings or
funding specific initiatives. In 2007-08, over
72,000 donors raised $785 million to Stan
ford, making the University's development
the most successful in the U.S. Almost 40
percent of Stanford undergraduate alumni
contributed to the University's fundraising
efforts. Programs such as Bing Stanford in
Washington, study abroad and Chappell
Lougee fellowships simply would not exist
without the generosity of individuals.
Hie thousands of people did not invest in
our education merely to watch us lead re
warding, albeit private lives. It is just not

good enough to go about our daily routines,
seeking personal fulfillment. They invested
to produce global citizens of the highest
moral and intellectual caliber who will
make valuable contributions to the broader
society, whether it is in the arts, sciences, ac
ademia, politics or other arenas. It is their
expectation that we take responsibility for
forces greater than ourselves. The chal
lenges confronting us today are just as diffi
cult as those confronting great challenges of
bygone days. We still need to answer

Alexander Hamilton's call in "The Federal
ist" to ensure that the future of humanity is
shaped through "reflection and choice," and
not through "accident and force."
The topic of a noble life rarely features in
conversations among Stanford students. You
do not often hear Aristotle's view in the
Nicomachean Ethics regarding statesman
ship as one of the highest forms of life
evoked in job search sessions. Pragmatism
appears to be the dominating attitude on
campus. Despite the recent economic crisis,
the cult of a career in finance has not dimin
ished. Less than a week into fall quarter, I
have received at least a dozen emails pro
moting "information sessions," "coffee

chats" and "resume drops." From McKinsey
to Morgan Stanley, from Deloitte to D.E.
Shaw, consulting and I-banking firms have
flooded the campus with full-time position
recruiting. There is nothing wrong with Stan
ford students wanting to venture into the
business arena. The opportunities offered
are certainly stimulating and financially re
warding. Indeed, the private sector offers a
chance to gain valuable skills and experi
ences that should be later applied toward
furthering the public good. Furthermore, it is
expected that we will change jobs and pro
fessions numerous times during our lifetime.
However, it becomes disconcerting when se
curity replaces vision, and when complacen

cy stifles our sense of responsibility.
In their founding grant, Leland and Jane
Stanford expressed Stanford students' re
sponsibility to contribute to "the public wel
fare by exercising an influence on behalf of
humanity and civilization." A Stanford edu
cation does not merely equip us with the
ability to embark on successful careers. It
prepares us to lead lives of service. It is im
perative that we keep in mind the sense of
duty to our predecessors and our legacy.

How will you rise to meet the responsibility of
serving as leaders in your community, the na
tion and the world? Email Shelley at
