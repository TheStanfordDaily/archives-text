## Pursuit of Perfection Women look to remain undefeated against Gaels 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
With a flawless record and few injury
problems, the Cardinal women's soccer
team is riding a huge wave of momentum
into the tail end of its non-conference sea
son. After dominating Colorado and Wis
consin last weekend by a combined score of
10-0, No. 2 Stanford (9-0-0) now looks ahead
to Sunday's road game against the Gaels of
St. Mary's College (5-4-0), the penultimate
match before its foray into Pac-10 play.

The Gaels are a familiar foe to most of
the Cardinal players, as the two schools have
met each other in each of the last two sea
sons. Last year, the Cardinal soundly defeat
ed St. Mary's in a 3-0 shutout behind goal
keeper Kira Maker. Despite their recent his
tory, however, Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe knows that no team should be un
derestimated, especially on the road.
"I think whenever you're playing away
from home, it's a more difficult game," Rat
cliffe said. "St. Mary's has done really well
this year, and their track record is strong.
Every game is difficult, so we have to be
ready for it. We have to prove we can win."
Spearheading the effort to continue the
Cardinal's undefeated season will be senior
forward Kelley O'Hara. Dexterous and ex
perienced, O'Hara has racked up a team
leading 24 points and 10 goals in just nine
games, while keeping her shot accuracy at an
impressive .222 in 45 tries. What's more, she
has already scored well over half of her ca
reer high in points this season 38 in 2008.
Indeed, O'Hara has put in extra effort to
make her senior year special.
"I played with a team over the summer,
and it's the first time I've played all through
the offseason like that," O'Hara said. "I
think that helped to keep my game fitness
up. But also, it's my senior year and I love
Stanford, so I really want to make the most
of the couple months I have left with this
team."

Her coach couldn't be more grateful for
her contributions, and Ratcliffe knows
O'Hara will be a useful asset both on Sun
day and for the remainder of the season.
"Kelley's been fantastic this year and in
the past," Ratcliffe said of his senior for
ward. "She's an inspiration to the team and

very mature. She's a great leader .. . she's
just exceptional."

Stanford's 2009 squad, currently ranked
No. 1 in four of five national polls, has a lot
of depth backing up key players like
O'Hara. Among its talented core is sopho
more forward Lindsay Taylor. As a fresh
man,Taylor tied Christen Press for the team
lead in goals with 16, and was named the
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. She's had to
battle through some adversity this season,
and has netted only two goals throughout
the Cardinal's nine games. She's starting to
look like her old self again recently, though,
and could be a big factor against St. Mary's
last year, she scored the game-winning
goal against the Gaels.

"I started the year off sick, so it was a lit
tle hard to get into things, but I've managed
to come back and get increased playing
time," Taylor said. "I've had time to get used
to everyone's playing styles again, and I
think they're getting used to me as well. I'm
starting to get back into shape and getting
set to play hard, so it's been a good come
back."

The rest of the team, despite the perfect
record, is looking to improve as well. With
conference play just around the corner, the
contest with St. Mary's could be a good op
portunity for the Cardinal to work out any
kinks in its game.

"The team needs to continue improving,"
Ratcliffe acknowledged. "We've been doing
better and better with each game. We've
been trying to increase our speed of play in
particular. We need to keep working,
though. My hope is that we're peaking dur
ing the Pac-10 season and then leading
heading into the playoffs."

While Ratcliffe and his players generally
prefer to take things one game at a time, it's
hard not to look past matches like St. Mary's
on Sunday, especially while facing a team
that has a good chance of going deep into
the postseason.

Taylor expressed her excitement at the
not-too-far-off Pac-10 schedule. "It's great to
be going back to the conference games, and
we're always looking to be tough and hope
fully make it back to the Pac-10 tournament,
and maybe win it all this year," she said.
On the injury front, the Cardinal had a bit
of a scare when sophomore midfielder Tere

sa Noyola (currently third on the team in
points) took a nasty spill in front of the stu
dent section against Wisconsin. Though she
took several minutes to stand up and was fa
voring one leg heavily, her coach is not too
concerned about the incident.
"It was just a little knock, the kind of

thing that happens all the time," Ratcliffe
said. "She should be fine."
The Cardinal faces off against the St.
Mary's College Gaels this Sunday at 1 p.m.
in Moraga, Calif.
