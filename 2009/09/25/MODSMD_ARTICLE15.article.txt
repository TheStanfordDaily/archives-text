# Witnessing women's soccer
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
The Stanford football frenzy
currently overtaking the
school should not obscure
notable performances by
other teams across campus.
In fact, the women's soccer team is one
of many fall teams with undefeated
records so far.
With a 9-0-0 record and a No. 1 or
No. 2 national ranking (depending on
the poll), women's soccer has had an
impressive start to the season and is
looking to maintain its strong perform
ance.
Stanford is off to its best start since
1994, when the Cardinal team went 10-
0 to start the season. With the next two
games against Saint Mary's and Santa
Clara, there is a good chance that the
Cardinal women will best the 1994
mark to have the best opening record
in Stanford women's soccer history.
But as the old adage goes, it's not
how you start; it's how you finish. And
I'm sure that the players will tell you
the same thing. Last year's excellent
season ended with a tough 1-0 loss to
Notre Dame in the College Cup semi
finals. This year, almost every player re
turns from that squad, and you can be
sure they have at least one thing on
their mind.
And watch out, women's soccer
teams across the country: This team
may be better than they were a year
ago.
The Cardinal has returned their of
fensive firepower from a year ago
69 of Stanford's 71 goals last season.
Stanford has outscored their oppo
nents 33-6 so far this year, and six play
ers have multi-goal games.
An example of just how good the
Cardinal is can be seen in this season's
third game. Down 2-0 to San Diego
State with 27 minutes to go, the Cardi
nal rebounded for three goals in six
minutes, and added two more before
the game was over. The Aztecs suf
fered a bombardment of five goals in
26 minutes, and this game showed how
the Card is ready to strike given even
the slightest opportunity.
An explosive offense and stout de
fense carried last year's team to the
College Cup. But it was the first Col
lege Cup appearance for every single
player on that team. Say what you will
about experience, but something tells
me that this year, with nine of 11 re
turning starters and almost the entire
bench returning, the Cardinal will be
even more ready for the champi
onships this year.
And honestly, it does not seem like
there is much in their way. They have
five or six players ready to bring them
a quick goal at any moment, and an en
tire team of playmakers. They have
speed at the back and in the front, and
size in the middle. Head coach Paul
Ratcliffe has been starting freshman
Mariah Nogueira in a defensive mid
field spot, while giving her the freedom
to move forward on set pieces. Rat
cliffe has called her one of the best
headers of the ball he's seen in college
soccer. That physical presence and
ability to win the ball is key for the Car
dinal, which has in recent years had the
luxury of physical central defenders in
cluding Allison Falk, Marissa Abegg
and Rachel Buehler.

But games aren't won with defense
alone. Senior Kelley O'Hara anchors
an offense that includes junior Chris
ten Press and sophomores Lindsay
Taylor and Teresa Noyola. The four
have combined for 22 of the team's 33
goals. Perhaps even more impressive is
the late offensive prowess â€”25 of
Stanford's 33 goals have come in the
second half.

Probably the defining win of the
season so far was the win a few weeks
ago over then-No. 5 Notre Dame. In a
rematch of last year's National Semifi
nal game, the Cardinal took charge in a
2-0 win over the Irish down at Santa
