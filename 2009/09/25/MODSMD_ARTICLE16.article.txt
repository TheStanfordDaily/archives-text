## Men's soccer prepares for pair of nonconference home games 
### â€“ By Jacob Jaffe 
The Stanford men's soccer team
welcomes Air Force tonight and New
Mexico on Sunday night in the Stan
ford Nike Classic this weekend.

So far this season, the Cardinal (4-
1) has rebounded from a subpar
2008. After its opening loss at
Lehigh, Stanford has won four
straight games, which already equals
the team's win total from last year,
and hopes to continue its success
against two Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation teams.

Thus far, Stanford has scored nine
goals in five games, which is a vast im
provement over last year's total of 14
goals in 18 games.This coincides with
strong defensive play for the Cardi
nal. Senior goalkeeper John Moore
had three shutouts in the team's first
five contests. This is nothing new for
Stanford, though, because the Cardi
nal defense was the lone bright spot
for the team last year. Stanford did

not allow more than two goals in any
game last year, and the defense has
continued that run this year, giving
up four goals in five games.
The Cardinal's first opponent, Air
Force, has won its last two games and
is 3-1-1 on the year. The Falcons are
led by Kevin Rosser, who has four as
sists in five games. Stanford is 4-1-2
overall against Air Force.
New Mexico comes in 4-2, but
has to play at No. 5 California this
afternoon before taking on Stan
ford. Justin Davis has scored four of
the Lobos' 12 goals this season, and
New Mexico has only allowed six
goals.

Stanford was picked in the pre
season to finish third in the six-team
soccer variation of the Pac-10, be
hind Cal and UCLA, who are both in
the current top 10.
The Air Force game will begin at 7
p.m. tonight and the New Mexico
game will kick off at 12:30 p.m. on
Sunday.
