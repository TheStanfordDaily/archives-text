## Cardinal plays host to Huskies in a must-win game 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It may only be September, but
Stanford plays a game that will be
critical in defining the rest of its
season when No. 24 Washington
comes to town Saturday night.
The Cardinal (2-1,1-0 Pac-10)
is looking to reach its first bowl
game since 2001, and a win this
weekend would go a long way in
taking the team there. Winning
home games is always crucial, es
pecially against conference teams
of comparable caliber, like the
Huskies.

"The importance of the stretch
we're going into right now is
huge," said head coach Jim Har
baugh. "It's going to be a tough
game like it will be the following
week, the week after that and pret
ty much every game the rest of the
schedule. It's important for us to
take one game at a time and just
prepare to put our players and our
football team in the best possible
position."

The game is just as important
for the Huskies (2-1,1-0 Pac-10),
who are looking to carry the mo-

mentum from their shocking 16-13
win over then-No. 3 USC into the
rest of their conference schedule.

The stakes may be even higher
than they originally were, after com
ments by Washington coach Steve
Sarkisian this week. Sarkisian ex
plained to the Seattle media that he
would be turning down the music
during practice this week in order to
prepare for the "somewhat more
quiet atmosphere" at Stanford Stadi
um. While Sarkisian's comments
riled some from the Stanford com
munity this week (although not the
football program itself), the first
year coach's remarks were certainly
valid.

The Huskies are led by junior
quarterback Jake Locker, consid
ered to be one of the best talents at
quarterback in all of the country.
Though Harbaugh has been the

coach known to stir the media, he
had nothing but praise this week for
Locker and the rest of the Huskies.

"They've done a remarkable job
with that football program, both the
players and the coaches there," Har
baugh said. "Offensively, they give
you a lot of problems. You got a
quarterback that can drop back in
the pocket and throw it. He can get
out of the pocket. He can escape
pressure when you have pressure on
him, and when you have guys cov
ered he can make a play."
Harbaugh's words seem to line up
with his actions: He voted Washing
ton 15th in the latest coaches' poll,
nine spots ahead of its actual posi
tion in the poll.

Though Washington is the ranked
opponent in the match-up, the Car
dinal is the favorite, and a significant
one at that the standard Vegas
betting lines currently have Stanford
as an eight-point favorite. After all,
Washington is still fresh off a 0-12
season, the worst in school history.
The Huskies have already clearly
been rejuvenated after hiring Sark
isian, but any program coming off
such a horrific season is likely to ex
perience growing pains in its first re
building year.
Washington was also aided by a
combination of injuries and numer
ous mistakes on the part of the Tro-

Jans: USC was forced to start inexpe
rienced backup Aaron Corp at quar
terback, and they ended up turning
the ball over three times.

Stanford will attack Washington
with the same weapon it wields on
the rest of its opponents: senior tail
back Toby Gerhart. The Huskies run
defense may be a point of weakness,
too, as they gave up 250 yards to Tro
jan running backs last Saturday. With
Gerhart in good health and running
over defenders of all kinds, the Car
dinal may have a field day when it
comes to running the football.
That said, the Huskies are going
to be a formidable opponent, some
thing Stanford is perfectly aware of.
"They're a different team [than
last year's team]," Gerhart said after
Stanford's 42-17 win over San Jose
State last Saturday. "They're confi
dent, they're playing hard, they're
playing well. Just watching that very
first game [against LSU], they're
going to be a team to contend with.
We were at that same point two
years ago."
Saturday's kick-off is set for 6
p.m. at Stanford Stadium. The game
will be televised by Fox Sports Col
lege Pacific and broadcast by KZSU
90.1 FM.
