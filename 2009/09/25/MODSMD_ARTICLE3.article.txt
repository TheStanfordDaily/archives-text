# Full Moon blacked out
## Students react to the decision to cancel annual tradition 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
The administration's decision to cancel this year's Full
Moon on the Quad was met with mixed reactions by students
this week.
The tradition involving seniors kissing freshmen under the
first full moon of the quarter was officially cancelled Tuesday
evening after campus health officials weighed in on the event
and deemed it too great a risk to students' health, especially as
the spread of swine flu continues.
According to Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman, the decision to cancel one of Stanford's best
known traditions came about earlier in the week.
"The spread of HINI has been a concern for several
months now," Boardman said in an email to The Daily. "How
ever, only this week did I ask for a recommendation."
Boardman was not certain if the event had ever been
called off in previous years. He also said there are plans for the
sophomore class, as well as other dorms, to host substitute
events and residential-based programming sometime during
fall quarter. The sophomore class traditionally hosts Full
Moon and is now trying to plan an alternative campus-wide
event.
"We were very disheartened and very sad, since we've
been planning since last spring," said sophomore Class Presi
dent Isabelle Wijangco 'l2.
Wijangco explained that if the event were to occur, extra
precautions involving Peer Health Educators (PHEs) and
Vaden would have been taken, "but swine flu is a very real
issue, and the risk is just too big considering what the event en
tails."
"I am primarily concerned with the health and well-being
of our students," Boardman said. "This was not a decision I
made lightly."
While some students expressed disappointment at the de
cision, many also seemed to understand the administration's
rationale.
"[Full Moon] made Stanford seem less uptight," said
Tiffany Li'l3. "We're bright-eyed Stanford freshmen, we look

forward to all Stanford traditions, but I
don't think we're too devastated,
because we haven't seen it before."

For Ed Schmerling 'lO, a senior, the
news was "reasonably disappointing."
"I was definitely planning on show
ing up and not kissing a lot of fresh
man, because I'm a staff member obvi
ously, but definitely ogling and leering
at freshman girls," he joked.
While Boardman said he had heard
mostly positive reactions, emails were
sent to several lists joking about the
threat of germs being spread more eas
ily through a handshake than through
a kiss. Others fear this is the first step in

removing Full Moon from Stanford's
calendar for good.
"This is a decades-long tradition,
and it's one that I've certainly taken
part in the last three years," said Chris
Hadley 'lO. "And it also sucks that
they're taking away something that is a
major draw of Stanford, the college of
crazy traditions. These frosh have been
reading about Full Moon for potential
ly months now, only for it to be stolen
away from them."
Boardman said there are currently
no plans to cancel Full Moon in future
years.
"I think it is very reasonable; swine
flu is some big epidemic that is hitting
our age group hardest," said
Schmerling. "I'm not sure if it's too dif
ferent from the mono scare that hap
pens every year and the administration
is always looking for a good excuse to

shut the whole thing down. But I sup
port them in their decision to shut it
down this year, even though it's my
senior year."
In an email to the sophomore class
announcing the cancellation, sopho
more class presidents asked for recom
mendations for other possible events
to be held in place of Full Moon. The
class will hold office hours Friday from
3 to 5 p.m. in Old Union to gather stu
dent input about other events.
"People have been very supportive
they totally understand where the
University is coming from," Wijangco
said. "While we're really disappointed
that this has happened, it's a great
opportunity to take what's happened
and make a new event."
