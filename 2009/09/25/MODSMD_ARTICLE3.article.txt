# Full Moon blacked out
## Students react to the decision to cancel annual tradition 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
The administration's decision to cancel this year's Full
Moon on the Quad was met with mixed reactions by students
this week.
The tradition involving seniors kissing freshmen under the
first full moon of the quarter was officially cancelled Tuesday
evening after campus health officials weighed in on the event
and deemed it too great a risk to students' health, especially as
the spread of swine flu continues.
According to Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman, the decision to cancel one of Stanford's best
known traditions came about earlier in the week.
"The spread of HINI has been a concern for several
months now," Boardman said in an email to The Daily. "How
ever, only this week did I ask for a recommendation."
Boardman was not certain if the event had ever been
called off in previous years. He also said there are plans for the
sophomore class, as well as other dorms, to host substitute
events and residential-based programming sometime during
fall quarter. The sophomore class traditionally hosts Full
Moon and is now trying to plan an alternative campus-wide
event.
"We were very disheartened and very sad, since we've
been planning since last spring," said sophomore Class Presi
dent Isabelle Wijangco 'l2.
Wijangco explained that if the event were to occur, extra
precautions involving Peer Health Educators (PHEs) and
Vaden would have been taken, "but swine flu is a very real
issue, and the risk is just too big considering what the event en
tails."
"I am primarily concerned with the health and well-being
of our students," Boardman said. "This was not a decision I
made lightly."
While some students expressed disappointment at the de
cision, many also seemed to understand the administration's
rationale.
"[Full Moon] made Stanford seem less uptight," said
Tiffany Li'l3. "We're bright-eyed Stanford freshmen, we look
