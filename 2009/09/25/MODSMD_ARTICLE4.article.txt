# BATTLE AT THE BIG SPIKE
## Women's volleyball heads to Berkeley 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team,
following a solid performance in the presea
son, now enters Pac-10 play with its sights set
on another trip to the national champi
onships.

No. 10 Stanford jumps out of the presea
son with a 7-3 record to face rival No. 12 Cali
fornia in the Big Spike. Cal comes out of pre
season with a similar 7-3 record, providing an
even face-off for the Pac-10 season's crucial
first match.

"The Pac-10 is starting and every match
matters," said head coach John Dunning.
"And usually that's true, but this year, every
one can beat everyone in the Pac-10."
The Cardinal enters the match with losses
against Notre Dame (3-0), Florida (3-2) and
Hawai'i (3-0), while California comes in with
losses against UC-Irvine (3-2), Texas (3-1)
and Saint Louis (3-0).

While both teams match up in losses, the
two have four past matches in common: San
Jose State, San Francisco, Saint Mary's and
Hawai'i.

Though Cal seemingly has an edge over
Stanford in terms of shared opponents, the
Card's defeats all come from top-ranked
teams, while middle-ranked teams have top
pled the Bears. Because each volleyball pro
gram has the ability to beat the top teams this
year, the Pac-10 will again be a tight race to
the finish.

"Everyone is good now there are lots of
teams that can be the best team and that can
beat the best teams on a daily basis. That just
means that every match is going to be excit
ing," Dunning said. "I hope a lot of people
come to watch this team and say, 'Yeah
they're pretty good. Or no, they're not good
enough yet, but we're going to see a great
match and next week they'll be even better.'"
Among the Pac-10, it seems that Stanford
has fallen behind in the rankings. With Ari-

zona, Washington State, Oregon and Wash
ington boasting undefeated seasons thus far,
the Card needs to make a serious run in order
to match last season's success. UCLA, Ore
gon State, Cal and Stanford are all sitting at
the bottom of the Pac-10 with three losses
apiece.
Experienced players senior Janet Okog
baa and juniors Cassidy Lichtman, Alix
Klineman and Gabi Ailes lead the otherwise
young Cardinal team. Coming off of a week
