# BATTLE AT THE BIG SPIKE
## Women's volleyball heads to Berkeley 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team,
following a solid performance in the presea
son, now enters Pac-10 play with its sights set
on another trip to the national champi
onships.

No. 10 Stanford jumps out of the presea
son with a 7-3 record to face rival No. 12 Cali
fornia in the Big Spike. Cal comes out of pre
season with a similar 7-3 record, providing an
even face-off for the Pac-10 season's crucial
first match.

"The Pac-10 is starting and every match
matters," said head coach John Dunning.
"And usually that's true, but this year, every
one can beat everyone in the Pac-10."
The Cardinal enters the match with losses
against Notre Dame (3-0), Florida (3-2) and
Hawai'i (3-0), while California comes in with
losses against UC-Irvine (3-2), Texas (3-1)
and Saint Louis (3-0).

While both teams match up in losses, the
two have four past matches in common: San
Jose State, San Francisco, Saint Mary's and
Hawai'i.

Though Cal seemingly has an edge over
Stanford in terms of shared opponents, the
Card's defeats all come from top-ranked
teams, while middle-ranked teams have top
pled the Bears. Because each volleyball pro
gram has the ability to beat the top teams this
year, the Pac-10 will again be a tight race to
the finish.

"Everyone is good now there are lots of
teams that can be the best team and that can
beat the best teams on a daily basis. That just
means that every match is going to be excit
ing," Dunning said. "I hope a lot of people
come to watch this team and say, 'Yeah
they're pretty good. Or no, they're not good
enough yet, but we're going to see a great
match and next week they'll be even better.'"
Among the Pac-10, it seems that Stanford
has fallen behind in the rankings. With Ari-

zona, Washington State, Oregon and Wash
ington boasting undefeated seasons thus far,
the Card needs to make a serious run in order
to match last season's success. UCLA, Ore
gon State, Cal and Stanford are all sitting at
the bottom of the Pac-10 with three losses
apiece.

UCLA


baa tallied 22 kills in two games and
Ailes rallied 37 digs, these players are
fired up and prepared to take on the
Pac-10. The team now looks to im
prove with each game and help its
younger players harness their skills.
"With our team, we're trying not to
get ahead of ourselves," Dunning said.
"We had four people graduate who
played a lot last year. The one thing
you can't hurry is experience. It comes
when it comes."
Cal boasts one of the nation's best
outside hitters,Hana Cutura. Dunning
and his team will look to keep her con
tained by controlling the net tonight.
"When you're looking at who's out
on the court, we better be a good
blocking team. We can play by the net
athletically or size-wise or both," Dun
ning said. "Most of the good Pac-10
teams are driven by their outside hit
ters; so our block, if it's really good, can
change the matches."
Changing matches is what it's all
about in the Pac-10 this year. Whether

the team is No. 1 or No. 10, the Card
knows that each game will pose a dif
ficult test. Playing Cal on the road will
be challenging, although very reward
ing if the Cardinal can bring home a
victory.
"Cal is Cal is Cal. We're motivated
to play Cal, and they're really good,"
Dunning said. "[Cutura] has been
tearing all of her opponents apart.This
is a big match for us to start confer
ence. It's on their court; they're going
to be comfortable. We have to go over
there and defend ourselves,but it's just

a great way to start the conference."
Riding momentum from the past
weekend's triumphs, the Cardinal sets
out to keep the ball rolling in its favor
against the Bears. With great serving,
tough defense and execution of of
fense, Stanford should be able to take
its first conference win.
The first ball will be served tonight
at 7 p.m. at the Haas Pavilion in Berke
ley.
