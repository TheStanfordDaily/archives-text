## Stanford joins Consortium of Universities on Global Health PARTNERS IN HEALTH 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford will be joining forces with other
top universities in an effort to solve pressing
problems of global health.
The universities include Boston University,
Duke, Emory, Johns Hopkins, McGill, the
University of California and the University of
Washington. In the agreement, published
Sept. 14, Stanford and the other universities
agreed to work together in an effort to "bring
the unique resources of the university to bear
on problems that require sustained, integrat
ed, interdisciplinary and collaborative
approaches." The statement is associated with
the Consortium of Universities on Global
Health.

Dr. Michele Barry, new senior associate dean at
the School of Medicine, who helped draft the
statement, said the impetus came from a con
cern with practical engagement. "We want the
University to become part of the community of
global health, and not an ivory tower," she said.
Barry, who was recruited four months ago
after 25 years at Yale, was hired by the School
of Medicine to fill an entirely new position
designed to address just how Stanford can be a
part of the global health movement. Her work
will have a particular emphasis on the compo
nents of education, research and service.
The University's unique involvement in the
consortium is complemented by its past initia
tives in the area of global health innovation.
Stanford-India Biodesign, an educational pro
gram developed at Stanford, was selected by
the consortium as one of the best examples of
collaborative and innovative partnership in
global health.

By partnering to build medical schools in
developing nations and re-opening clinics, the

consortium hopes to open the channels for
cross-cultural global health dialogue, curb

"brain-drain" and inspire innovations in
the global health sector.

Stanford's future involvement
with the group will be "cross-discipli
nary," if all goes as planned. After set
tling into her new post, Barry hopes to
engage with other departments in
innovative ways from financing
health across the world to helping min
istries of health in other countries. She
has already met with political scientists

at the Freeman Spogli Institute to
discuss health policy and

prepare for the

Global Health
Consortium in
\Fvlay.

The University's promise to answer to the
challenges of global health through the consor
tium was met with approval by many health
concerned student groups across campus.
Patricia Arty 'lO, public relations executive for
Dance Marathon, was enthusiastic about the
University's fresh commitment to the issue.
"This move shows that the Stanford com
munity sees past a country's border as it sup
ports the development of global health curricu
la and research," Arty said.

Sabrina Tom MED 'll, former president of
the Organization of International Health, was
also pleased with the decision. "Breakthroughs
in medicine aren't just about discovering new
biochemical therapies," she said. "[Stanford
School of Medicine's] commitment toward a
broader definition of being a leader in medical
discovery and innovation is both very encour
aging and long overdue."
