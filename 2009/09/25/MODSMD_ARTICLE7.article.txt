## Break-in forces security review Suspect now considered a fugitive by the FBI 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
Two months after a disgruntled
ex-employee destroyed an estimat
ed $500,000 in protein samples at
SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory, staff there say security
measures are under review but hir
ing practices will remain the same.
Silvya Oommachen, 32, a former
research associate at the Joint
Center for Structural Genomics at
SLAC, was arrested and charged in
July with willful injury and depre
dation of U.S. government property
after she allegedly snuck into a
SLAC laboratory and destroyed
more than 4,000 protein samples.
She had been fired earlier that
month after failing to show up to
work.

Oommachen told the FBI she
destroyed the samples to rid herself
of "bad karma" and left obscene
notes signed by her "alter ego" in
the lab where the protein was
stored.

SLAC spokesman Rob Brown
called the July 18 vandalism an
issue of physical security rather
than a personnel issue.
"Probably from the start, our
biggest concern has been a security
one rather than processes related to
human resources," Brown said
Thursday. "Look ... we generally
don't have these kinds of issues.
We've never had them before."
Brown said SLAC hiring
processes remain essentially the

same as before the vandalism: "to
check people's references and do
the normal best practices."

He would not discuss, however,
what measures have been taken to
improve physical security on SLAC
grounds.
Before she was fired,
Oommachen had been screening
proteins as part of the center's
Structure Determination Core
project. On the evening of July 18,
she allegedly slipped, unnoticed,
into the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Lightsource facilities at
SLAC and removed the research
samples from their cold storage
facilities, allowing them to thaw and
ultimately be destroyed.

FBI officials later noted in a
report that the building housing the
genomic center was never locked.
Brown stated that after after the

vandalism, security procedures
would be reviewed.
"The nature of science at SLAC
and at Stanford is really collabora
tion," Brown said. "So, [tight securi
ty] gets a little discouraging in that
aspect. It's against the spirit of what
we're trying to do here as a
research institution."
Meanwhile, Oommachen's
whereabouts have been unclear
since July 28, when she was
released on a $50,000 unsecured
bond and told to report to the U.S.
District Court in San Francisco
daily. A clerk said she has not
appeared since then, and
Oomachen is now considered a
fugitive.
Calls to the FBl's San Francisco
office went unreturned.

This summer, a former employee managed to sneak into a SLAC laboratory
and cause $500,000 worth of damage. SLAC spokesman Rob Brown
said that, because of the break-in, the facility will be reviewing its "physical
security" issues. Hiring practices will remain the same.
Public defender Rita Bosworth
said Thursday she couldn't say
whether her client has been heard
from since disappearing July 28.
Oommachen's alleged crimes
carry a maximum penalty of 10
years in prison and a $250,000 fine,
Ryan Mac contributed to this
report.
