## School unveils new education minor Students laud the move as a step forward 
### TROY YANG 
A total of no more than 30 units
with at least six courses in the School
of Education now allows a student to
obtain a minor in education, a school
that does not offer an undergraduate
major.

Education Prof. Jennifer Wolf
said those who hope to become
teachers should major in the areas in
which they plan to teach. However,
she added, having an education
minor would go a long way in
preparing students for postgraduate
studies and, eventually, the teaching
profession.

"We want undergraduates to be
learning completely and deeply in
the content area that they will even
tually teach," Wolf said, "and educa
tional research has shown that bring
ing strong content knowledge to a
graduate study of education is bene
ficial for teaching and learning."
Despite a year of weighty budget
cuts, school officials said the new
minor was the most effective and
inexpensive way to prepare under
graduates for the field. To fund the
program, the University is only pay
ing for one additional person, who
serves as a part-time director.

Wolf said the additional cost was
well worth it. "We get a lot of return
on that. We're one of the strongest
education schools in the world, and it
seems unfortunate that undergradu
ates don't have access to that," she

said. "We want to encourage under
graduate students to think about
education."

Prospects for the new minor pro
gram appear promising. Already,
there are at least 10 students among
the senior class who are pursuing the
minor, which was initiated just this
fall. Fourteen students are already
enrolled in Education 101, the one
required course for the minor.
Students say the minor program
is a step forward. "The path into the
field of education is interdisciplinary
in nature, but at Stanford there has
n't been any track for that," said
Lauren Ponti 'lO. "So, the availability
of this minor is a nice thing for peo
ple interested in the field of educa
tion to hold on to.

"Some of my friends . . . com
plained a lot about how there's not a
major in education," she added. "So,
for a lot of us, it's exciting that there's
now something to show for all the
work we have put into learning
about education."
Some of the interest in this bur
geoning program stems from the fact
that there are lucrative opportunities
associated with pursuing a graduate
degree in education. Ponti, for exam
ple, is interested in education profit
management and education policy.
However, Wolf explained, there
are many career options for students
with an education degree, such as
teaching, administration and com
munication. "[An education degree]
prepares you for life in a community
and life as a citizen," she said.
