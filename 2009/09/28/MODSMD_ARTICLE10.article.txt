## EDITORIAL To the Stanford community: 
### ANDREW VALENCIA Editorial Board Chair 
Greetings from The Stanford Daily Volume
236 Editorial Board.
With the fall quarter now a week un
derway, the Editorial Board is gear
ing up to resume our traditional role
as the editorial voice of The Daily. Following
in the steps of the two previous Edit Boards,
who oversaw the presidential election, Propo
sition 8, budget cuts, community center lay
offs and the return of Condoleezza Rice, the
Volume 236 Edit Board will be under pres
sure from the very onset to keep up the pace
and address the major concerns of the com
munity. But given the plethora of issues facing
Stanford and its voices at the start of the quar
ter, it does not seem there will be any shortage
of topics for us to tackle.
One needs only to skim the pages of The
Daily from the last week to see that we are in
changing times here at Stanford. Reaction to
swine flu has led the administration to cancel
Full Moon on the Quad in spite of decades of
tradition. The University's endowment has
dropped 30 percent in the last fiscal year, the
largest single-year decrease in 35 years. In
turn, the financial aid program at Stanford is
running at a deficit which may lead to cuts in
students' scholarship funding in years ahead.
Meanwhile, off-campus, Congress and the
president continue to work toward reform
ing health care, the results of which could im
pact an untold number of students and their
families. And as the senior class prepares to
leave the Farm in June, they will be faced
with a job market in which only one position
is available for every six unemployed work
ers in America.

With these issues looming over the cam
pus at the start of the new year, the Edit
Board is committed to addressing them in
force. As in past volumes, the Edit Board re
mains officially independent of The Daily, al
lowing us to dissect and criticize the news of
the day with deliberate bias, without con
flicting with the objective tone of the news
department. With the exception of myself,
the Edit Board for this volume is composed
entirely of newcomers, whose experiences
and expertise at Stanford range from debate
and student government to athletics and a
cappella. We are a diverse group from differ
ent backgrounds, different academic areas
and different sub-communities of campus.
But one thing we share is a commitment to
defending the rights and privileges of Stan
ford community members, even in difficult
times. I am confident that together, we will
prove committed to the task of standing up
for the Stanford population amid severe so
cial and financial challenges.
With this in mind, the Edit Board wants to
hear from you, the members of this vibrant
community. We have a brand new email ad
dress at editorial@stanforddaily.com, and we
are interested in hearing your opinions. Re
member: Even though we are only a handful
of members of the Editorial Board, our ears
are open to the voices of the larger commu
nity, from residence to classroom, student
group to community center, academic de
partment to administration, campus to Palo
Alto.
