## Not Keen on IKEA 
### Kevin Webb 
Despite the title of this column, I own
IKEA furniture. As of mere days ago,
I own a lot of it, and consequently my
room smells of sawdust, cardboard and Swe
den. True, I don't know what Sweden smells
like, but I do know that vacuuming doesn't
get it out.
See, I recently returned to campus as
what can only be called a "super-senior." If
Stanford were a bad vampire novel, I would
be a daywalker not quite a grad student,
but not really a regular person anymore, ei
ther.
This means that I no longer live on cam
pus, instead residing mere blocks from the
University in an apartment that was so un
furnished my roommate Peng and I actually
thought a trip to IKEA would be worth
while, The fact that I am typing this column
up on top of my new MIKAEL black/brown
desk with matching MIKAEL black/brown
backboard suggests that maybe it was. It just
wasn't enjoyable.

For those of you who have never been,
going to IKEA is kind of like going to Dis
neyworld. (I also just went to Disneyworld,
which is conveniently my-newborn-nephew
adjacent.) There are people in ridiculous
outfits, food stands everywhere and literally
millions of parking spots. But where Disney
world has the Magic Kingdom, IKEA has a
lamp department. Where Disneyworld has
Space Mountain, IKEA has machines that
push chairs up and down. Where Disney
world has Mickey Mouse, IKEA has a
creepy mutant heart with arms and no face.
Above all, the thing I hate most about
IKEA is that until I figured out how to sneak
into the bottom floor, I would have to weave
through the entire country-sized store. I
would go in looking for one thing say, a
dresser and before too long, I would find
myself thinking, "Yes, I could use a multicol
ored banana fiber stool in my solarium." I
don't know what a solarium is, but I would
decorate mine sharply.

By the time I staggered through to the
end of the showroom, I would have bought
almost anything to keep from ever, ever,
ever having to buy furniture again.
Then, of course, there's the linguistic
thing. Unlike most companies, IKEA insists
on using words most of its customers find ut
terly unpronounceable. Foreign car compa
nies make model names from English words
why should furniture or food names be
any different?

A relevant note to the good people at
IKEA: No matter how good a drink might
be, if you call it "Glogg," I will not buy it. I am
an American, and that word is disgusting.
To IKEA's credit, though, I do enjoy as
sembling the furniture. I find that the unclear
directions and lack of spare parts make for a
fun challenge. It's kind of like playing with
high-stakes Legos, because if you mess up,
you have probably just wrecked hundreds of
dollars' worth of furniture.

Despite my convictions, I am not going to
encourage a nationwide boycott of IKEA,
because it seems like a lot of work, I'm de
cently happy with my furniture so far, and,
most importantly, I don't have nearly
enough clout. (Note to Glenn Beck: If you
want to scare people off Obama, convince
them that IKEA is what socialism will look

like. It's a total lie, but I doubt that matters
much). Instead, I have some helpful sugges
tions for two disparate groups:
Enterprising Stanford students: Create a
furniture store that has the breadth of prod
ucts of IKEA, but which, you know, respects
the shopper. Admittedly it's hard, but every
time you drive past an IKEA, it's a giant blue
reminder that Sweden thinks it's better than
us. And I, for one, find that unacceptable,
Swedes: Take some pride in your heritage.
Americans' entire perception of your coun
try is pretty much based on the blurbs they
see by the food stand as they try to find their
way out of IKEA. There was something
about mountains and proud people and
OHMYGOD PLASTIC ORANGE CUPS
FOR ONLY NINETY-NINE CENTS.
So, you see my point.

You're descended from Vikings
Vikings! and now you hawk vaguely
painted particleboard tables held together
with woodscrews. Your people led my peo
ple (the Irish) to invent hiding in caves, and
arguably your Europe-wide raids prolonged
the Dark Ages for centuries. All I'm saying is
you could be doing so much more with your
selves. I don't know what specifically, but,
you know, think about it.

In the end, I think I've made my peace
with the store. I wish there were a place that
treated its customers better (I've gone entire
trips without seeing an employee aside from
the cashier) while still maintaining IKEA's
selection and prices, but that's a lot to ask.
Without IKEA, I wouldn't have my
MIKAEL brown/black desk, banana fibers
would still just be for supporting banana
plants, and Stanford students would lose
their source of hanging paper lamps.
For all its faults, IKEA furniture does
what I need it to do. Well, at least until I can
afford something better.
