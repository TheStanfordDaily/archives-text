I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll
allow, as there are some nice folks there ...

Ahh, California. The Golden State.
The land of fruits, nuts, flakes, the
Gubernator and too many other
weird entities to list in one column. De
scribed numerous times over as both the
Garden of Eden and the Ninth Circle of
Hell (Bakersfield, anyone?), the most popu
lous state in the nation lords over the far end
of the continent, igniting admiration, ire and
boat loads of curious onlookers from all cor
ners of the globe. Be it the last great hope
for humanity or a giant, flashing neon sign
advertising the End Times (6 p.m. on the 405
in L.A., anyone?), California is never one
about doing things quietly.
Like so many (i.e. 44 percent) students at
this fair establishment, I am a Californian. I
have known no other home than my upper
white middle class bourgeois neighborhood
just south of UC-San Diego. It is not diffi
cult to quickly key into the centrality of Cal
ifornia as a defining trait of my existence.
The loathing of closed-toed shoes; summers
spent on the beach with a forearm-sized El
Campeon Burrito from Rigoberto's in tow
(if you've visited me in SD, you know exact
ly what I'm talking about); a sound level of
partially-serious derisiveness directed to
ward Wyoming, North Dakota, Nebraska,
Alaska, etc.; the impact of California on my
life is undeniable.

In these two years I have spent saunter
ing along our palm-lined boulevards, it has
become evident to me there is much of what
I believe California is that Stanford exem
plifies, and vice versa. The strikes and the
gutters, ups and downs of both seem to re
flect highly in one another.

Both California and the Farm are rela
tively newcomers on the scene, entering ex
istence in 1850 and 1891, respectively.
Founded in large part by the infusion of ill

gotten gains stemming from the Gold Rush
and 19th century hothouse capitalism
(hooray Chinese exploitation in gold mines
AND railways), California and Stanford
have espoused from their respective begin
nings a sense of newness and a break from
the past, an emphasis on progress and devel
opment. Free of the cobwebs and mustiness
of the East, they said. In the words of Stan
ford's first president, David Starr Jordan, in
California, "if anywhere, life is worth living,
full and rich and free." It is fitting, then, that
the University motto should be "the wind of
freedom blows." The West, and thus its
crowning educational gem (sorry, Kal),
should be something profoundly different
than what has been.

CA and the Stan have also been at the
forefront of world affairs. Flush with re
sources (that both are now lesioning to
varying degrees), masses of talent and
overstretched ambitions, both the state
and the institution have helped introduce
paradigm-shifting technologies, ground
breaking arts and cultural norms . . . and
Herbert Hoover. California and Stanford
have long attracted the top talent in the
world compelled here by the climate, po
tential for riches and the overall quality of
life. As the aspiring actress moves to Hol
lywood to hone her table-waiting skills
while hoping for the big great, so, too, do
the aspiring hedge fund schemers come to
Palo Alto for training in economics and
case days.

However, with a focus on progress and a

void of celebrated history or traditions (or
at least particular histories and traditions
that fit with the traditional white ruling
powers), California and Stanford have ulti
mately embraced the exaggerated, the ma
terial and the flat-out absurd. Combating
deeply entrenched regional biases leveled
upon the head of California (SEC/Ivy
League brown-nosing, ahem), we have
chosen to do it bigger, flashier and louder.
Thomas Jefferson may have singularly
helped birth modern Virginia (and a few
children with Sally Hemmings, but hey)
and Harvard might have more badass
alumni than Mississippi has illiterate chil
dren, but that isn't really important. We
have Rodeo Drive, Halloween in Isla Vista,
the Castro District, S2OK palm trees and
Exotic Erotic (well, let's see if they try and
kill this one, too). We're Californians, damn
it, and we sure as hell don't plan on you for
getting it.

So, what does this all mean, exactly?
Well, lemme tell ya. There is a particular
energy to both places, an aversion to stasis
that makes experiencing life one utterly
crazed adventure. At times questionable,
myopic and wrongheaded, it undeniably
exists, and being able to recognize and un
derstand this force is hugely important in
making sense of both places. And for the
particular images that are exported out to
the world of the Stan and California, there
are kernels of truth underlining each, but
both are so much more interesting and var
ied than what you see on the postcards. Peel
back some of the layers, experience both
Stanford and California on a personal level,
and who knows what you'll find? If you're
lucky, a burrito the size of your forearm.

Do you need directions to Rigobertos/want to
have your state needlessly insulted in a col
umn? Send a flaming ball of envy to Zack at
