## CARD FALLS SHORT IN FIVE Cal upsets Stanford in Pac-10 opener 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
No. 10 Stanford women's volleyball experi
enced its first Pac-10 defeat against No. 12 Cali
fornia in a five-set match on Friday, 25-19,20-25,
25-20,19-25,12-15. The loss left an egg in the
Card's win column to start conference play, and
gave the Bears a 1-0 Pac-10 record.
Despite losing the conference opener, Stan
ford battled it out and junior Cassidy Lichtman
boasted her third triple-double of the season
with 14 kills, 16 assists and 11 digs. Junior Alix
Klineman hit a season-high 23 kills, while senior
Janet Okogbaa mixed in 14 kills of her own.

"I think the five-set match indicates that both
teams did a good job of competing," said Okog
baa. "Though our team is still trying to get into a
rhythm, we're improving with each practice and
match, making this season an exciting one to
watch!"

Although a few Cardinal women experi
enced season highs, the young team collectively
hit a season offensive low with a .204 attack per
centage, while Cal recorded an average of .250.
Cal's main offensive weapon, Hana Cutura, led
the Bears with 21 kills against the Card.
"We have to get people on the court used to
this level of play. And we're finding out what our
priorities are. We just have to go week by week
by week," said head coach John Dunning. "We
have injuries and we have young people. We're
playing through them though, and we're being
tough."
Out of the gates, Cal took the early lead in the
match. Klineman and redshirt senior Alex Fish
er responded quickly on the offensive and tied it
up at sixes. The Card soon took advantage of
Cal's errors and took its first lead of the night at
8-7.
Lichtman and Klineman then teamed up to
give the Card a cushion as their combined kills
gave Stanford the 16-13 edge over the Bears.
Freshman Flayley Spelman stepped up and con
tributed two straight kills, taking it to 21-16. A
strong offensive took the set 25-19 in favor of
Stanford.
Stanford kept the ball rolling into the second
match, coming out with a 5-2 lead as Okogbaa
and Lichtman dominated the defensive with a
block and returned the fire on the offensive.
Answering back, Cal rallied and took the
lead with a kill, 9-8. Freshman setter Karissa
Cook put in time on the court and immediately

picked up an assist, setting up Klineman for a
kill. Lichtman narrowed Cal's lead, but the
Bears pulled away once again. Klineman and
Okogbaa led the Card once more, pressuring
Cal and forcing them to commit errors. Stanford
took the lead at 19-18, but the Bears fired back
and took the second set, 25-20.
"One thing that we will continue to work on
throughout the season is getting better at siding
out quickly, rather than allowing the other team
to get strings of points at a time," Okogbaa said.
The Card struck back in the third, as Kline
man and Lichtman played off of more Califor
nia errors for the early 4-1 lead. Klineman con
tinued to hammer away and added in three
straight kills to cushion the lead 12-6. Stanford's
defense continued to change the tempo of the
game and put the set at 17-10. A slight setback
for the Card allowed Cal to go on a 5-0 run; how
ever, Stanford pounded in a few more kills for
the 25-20 win.

"I felt we worked hard on our blocking and it
had an effect on the game. We also have worked
hard on our serving game, and after we settled
down a bit, we served very effectively," said
Dunning. "We will continue working on those
two areas and work on making attacking deci
sions and executing our offense."
The fourth left the teams all tied up for most
of the set. At 8-8, Cal went on a 4-1 run, giving
the Bears a slight advantage at 12-9. A double
block by Lichtman and Okogbaa, a Lichtman
ace and an Okogbaa kill closed the gap at 20-18.
But, once again, the Bears rallied to the finish for
the 25-19 set victory, taking the match to five.
Cal, revved up from the previous victory,
took the early 5-2 lead. While Stanford battled it
out at 13-11, led by Okogbaa with two straight
kills, Cal was able to put in the bag at 15-12.
"I think we are proud of many things we did
at Cal and the ways we improved from last
week," Dunning said. "I know we all realize we
have to stand up, in the big moments, just a bit
taller and fight off our opponent."
A tight conference leads to much unpre
dictability in the outcome of a season, and Fri
day was proof of just how tight the Pac-10 is.
Stanford looks to bounce back in Los Ange
les this upcoming weekend as they take on No.
14 UCLA on Friday, Oct. 3 and No. 13 USC on
Saturday, Oct. 4.
