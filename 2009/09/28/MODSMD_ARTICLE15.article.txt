## Card advances to 8-0 before falling to Bears 
### ALISSA HABER STAFF WRITER 
For the No. 13 Stanford women's field hock
ey team, the weekend proved bittersweet.
With a pair of crucial games against confer
ence opponents Pacific and California, the
Cardinal was looking to separate itself in the
NorPac West Division. But, Stanford was also
attempting to uphold an undefeated record
that would match the 1985 squad's school
record-holding winning streak.
After a convincing 5-1 blowout of Pacific on
Friday night, the Card looked poised and ready
to do accomplish all of those things. Unfortu
nately, things didn't finish as planned, and
Stanford suffered a 4-3 loss to the Golden

Bears Sunday afternoon in Berkeley. The loss
snapped Stanford's impressive eight-game
streak to start the season, and pushed the Card
to 8-1 on the year and 2-1 in league play.
Stanford began its weekend full of energy
under the lights of the Varsity Turf Friday. The
game proved to be another showcase of the
Cardinal's prolific offense, as the team record
ed 21 shots on goal for the contest.
The offense took some time to gain mo
mentum in the first half, and the first goal was
recorded at the 16:55 mark by junior Camille
Ghandi. While a failed penalty attempt in the
23rd minute seemed to inject the Tigers with
some momentum, Stanford quickly reestab
lished control, scoring three goals in the span of
eight minutes before the close of the first half.

Things began to swing in Stanford's favor at
the 27:53 mark, when junior Jaimee Erickson
scored on a penalty corner. Two minutes later,
fellow junior XantheTravlos found the back of
the net, scoring on a breakaway to make the
score 3-0. After another two-minute interval,
senior Rachel Mozenter hit an unassisted goal
to lift the Cardinal to a commanding 4-0 lead at
the half.

Freshman Becky Dru capped the scoring
with a goal in the second half at 49:55.
Also impressive on the offensive side was
senior Nora Soza, whose three assists gave her
a team-leading five on the year.
Perhaps more impressive than Stanford's
offense was its stifling defense ranked No. 7
in the nation, the Cardinal defense did not

allow a single shot on goal for the Tigers in the
entire first half. It wasn't until the 62nd minute
that the Tigers recorded a shot on goal. In the
end. Pacific was held to a measly total of three
attempts during the second half.
But the momentum gained in Friday night's
contest was not enough to stifle the Golden
Bears on Sunday.
Although Stanford scored three goals, the
eighth time in nine games, the Card defense
could not stop Cal's Erin Magill, who had a hat
trick performance of her own.
Stanford, trailing early in the first half,
pulled ahead on goals from Travlos and fresh
man Kelsey Lloyd. The Bears tied the game
just before the half, but Becky Dru
scored early in the second half to give
the Cardinal the lead.
However, Magill scored twice in
the second half, both on penalty cor
ners, to give Cal a 4-3 advantage,
snapping the Bears' five-game losing
streak.

The loss marks the first time this
season that Stanford's defense has al
lowed more than two goals.
The upset also continues Cal's un
beaten streak against Stanford at
home. The Cardinal has not beaten
the Bears in Berkeley since 1998.
Stanford will look to rebound this
week, as its travels to Pennsylvania to
play three games over a four-day
stretch.
