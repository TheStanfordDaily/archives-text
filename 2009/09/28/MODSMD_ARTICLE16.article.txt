# Curbing Some Enthusiasm

### Daniel Bohm 
I know I promised part two of a
series this week, but since Stan
ford football won what my col
league Mike Lazarus called
Stanford's first truly important home
game "in an embarrassingly long
time," I think I'm going to have to put
the sequel on hold.
As you all probably know by now,
rumbling behind a dominant offen
sive line, running back Toby Gerhart
bruised and battered his way to 200
yards rushing to lead the Cardinal's
34-14 rout of visiting Washington
Saturday.
After the game there were whis
pers around campus that Stanford
might be ranked this week, while
other students pointed out that the
Cardinal is alone in first place in the
Pacific-10 Conference. One student
even questioned if Stanford won out,
might it make it to the BCS title
game?
As impressed as I was with Stan
ford's performance Saturday, I have
to say one thing to all of these people:
Slow down let's not get ahead of
ourselves.
Because all the talk around here
is positive and everything seems
flowery at the moment, I'm going to
play the devil's advocate for a minute
and try to keep things grounded.
Yes, Stanford is 2-0 in the Pac-10,
but who have they beaten? Washing
ton and Washington State combined
to win one Pac-10 game all of last
year (which is guaranteed, as they
play each other every year). Yes, both
teams have improved and Jake Lock
er is healthy, but if Stanford expects
to go to a bowl game, then it has to
expect to win both of those games.
I can hear it now: "But Washing
ton was ranked No. 24 in the country
and beat Southern Cal last week."
All this argument does is show
how inept and inadequate rankings
are. Washington cannot stop the run,
period. They have one stud on of
fense, Locker, who is inconsistent in
his own right. And, quite frankly, the
Huskies had no business being any
where near the Top 25.
Sure, Washington beat USC last
week, but this is the weakest USC
team in a long time and Washington
caught the Trojans without their
starting quarterback Matt Barkley,
and without their best defensive
player Taylor Mays. Plus, Pete Car
roll and company tried to be cute in
stead of just running the ball down
Washington's throat and doing what
Stanford did this weekend: expose
the Huskies' overmatched run de
fense.
To those who believe Stanford
should be ranked, remember that
loss at Wake Forest. Sure, the Cardi
nal is one atrocious clipping call
away from being undefeated (in
which case being ranked might be in
the conversation), but Stanford did
squander a two-touchdown halftime
