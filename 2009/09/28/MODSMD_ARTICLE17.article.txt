# Press-ing on Offense
## 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
On a scorching afternoon in Mora
ga, Calif., the No. 2 Cardinal women nar
rowly sweated out a 1-0 win against the
St. Mary's College Gaels. The victory
lifts Stanford into double-digits in the
win column (at 10-0-0), gives Head
Coach Paul Ratcliffe his 150 th win with
Stanford and puts the Cardinal just one
win away from their best start in school
history.
Stanford's lone goal came from jun
ior forward Christen Press, while her
classmate, goalkeeper Kira Maker,
posted her sixth shutout of the season.
The game started out slowly for Stan
ford, who was perhaps a bit stifled by
the 100-degree heat.The Card had trou
ble with timing on passing, shots and
footwork, and was often unable to
maintain a long possession in the offen
sive zone.
No player had a better view of the
Cardinal in action than Maker, and she
noticed that both herself and her team
while known for scoring most of
their goals in the second half were

looking a little slower than usual on
Sunday.
"[We need to just work] on the men
tality going into a game at the start," she
later reflected. "We need to make sure
we're completely in it and have that
mentality to want to win."
Ratcliffe agreed with her, and was
disappointed with the way his team
came out of the gate.
"I thought we were really flat out for
the first half," he said. "That kind of set
the tone for the game. The second half
was a lot better and we showed better
character. We have to have the right
mentality. I thought Saint Mary's had
the right mentality and played very
hard. We have to realize going into
games that we have to put 100 percent
into it."

Deserving of Ratcliffe's accolades,
the Gaels (5-5-0) controlled possession
for much of the first half and managed
to tie the 2009 high among Stanford's
opponents for shots attempted at nine.
Maker made three saves to tie for her
season best. As a goalkeeper, typically
the most physically inactive player in a
match, keeping focus can be particular

ly tough especially in triple-digit
heat.

"It's just a matter of staying engaged,
being connected with the defense and
making sure you're in the game, even
when you're not being pressured," she
said. "The mistakes our defense makes
are few, so it's not often I have to deal
with that. But it's a matter of staying en
gaged and making sure that you're
ready for a shot whenever."
On the offensive side of things, Stan
ford mustered only six shots in the first
half. The Cardinal's best early chance
came from sophomore Lindsay Taylor
on a quick shot, but Gaels keeper Tara
Larson was able to haul it in.

Seeing his team tire throughout the
first half, Ratcliffe put it in some substi
tutions that he usually reserves for later
in a match: junior Morgan Redman,
freshman Courtney Verloo and senior
Kristin Stannard. Despite their fresh
legs, Stanford headed into the half with
the score stuck at zero-all.

midfielder in the chase for a loose ball. One man down in the last 16 minutes, Stanford still held on to a 1-0 lead.
ing in the second half like junior
Christen Press, who Ratcliffe had
playing alongside senior Kelley
O'Hara in the front. Press, whose six
points rank second on the Cardinal to
O'Hara's eight, managed to ricochet a
scorcher off the crossbar thanks to a
perfect pass from O'Hara, and chal
lenged Larsen on a couple of other
shots as the Cardinal offense picked
up the pace.
Press finally put the Cardinal on
the board in the 59th minute with a 40-
foot low shot that snuck behind
Larsen just inside the right post. After
scoring her eighth goal of the season,
Press gave credit to her partner
O'Hara for the support she provides
on offense.

"I've played with her for three
years now. We really do know each
other. We know our runs in the box
and where we'll be," Press said.

While Maker managed to hold on
for the win, the rest of the game wasn't
completely clean for the Cardinal.
Sophomore Camille Levin was red
carded in the 74th minute after collid
ing with Gael junior Caroline Shevlin
while going for a loose ball. Ratcliffe
disagreed with the ruling, believing
that Levin reached the ball before
Shevlin and had her feet firmly planted
before the players made contact. Ei
ther way, for what it's worth, it was clear
Shevlin got the worst of the impact.
The penalty left Stanford down a
player for the final 16 minutes of the
game, during which Ratcliffe had jun
ior Allison McCann move into
Levin's spot in the right backfield.
Levin's redcard also forbids her from
playing in Thursday's match against
Santa Clara, the final game of Stan
ford's non-conference season. As of
Sunday night, Ratcliffe was uncertain
who will play in Levin's spot against
the Broncos.
