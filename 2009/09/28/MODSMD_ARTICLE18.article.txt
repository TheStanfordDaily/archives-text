## Prof, shows charter school efficacy Educational model helps boost student achievement 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Supporters of charter schools
schools that are privately managed
but supported by public funds
have gained scientific credibility
from a report released by Stanford
economics Prof. Caroline Hoxby.
The report analyzed the New
York State Exam results for over
41,000 charter and public school
students, ranging from grades three
through 12, in the New York City
school system.
"On average," the study conclud
ed, "a student who attended a char
ter school for all of grades kinder
garten to eight would close about 86
percent of the achievement gap in
math and 66 percent of the
'Scarsdale-Harlem' achievement
gap in English."
Hoxby's research, however, goes
beyond just measuring test results
of disadvantaged Harlem students
against those of higher-performing,
suburban Scarsdale students.
While previous studies have

shown a similar increase in test
scores, critics have argued that char
ter schools secure these higher
scores by selecting only the students
most likely to succeed. Professor
Hoxby's work has gained national
attention for finding a method to
overcome this objection, with men
tions in the Washington Post and
The New York Times.

Instead of comparing charter
school students with the entire pub
lic school population, Hoxby only
examined those students who had
applied to the charter system and
were either accepted ('lotteried in')
or denied ('lotteried out') based on
a lottery system.
"If the charter schools are doing
better, then it can't be because they
are choosing better students," she
said. "That's why we like to do these
studies â€”it clarifies what we're
talking about and removes one of
the potential problems."

'Lotteried in' and 'lotteried out'
students in the study are statistical
ly equivalent in the categories of
race, ethnicity, gender, prior test
scores, percentage on free and
reduced lunch and English Learner
status.

"The parents go through the
same application process, they are
just as likely to send their kids to

charter schools, and the only differ
ence is a random lottery number,"
Hoxby said.
With controls in place, the 'lot
teried in' students ended up scoring
higher than the 'lotteried out'
group, testing an average of three
points higher on Regents Exams for
every year spent in the charter sys
tem.

Further study is needed to iden
tify what aspects of charter schools
contribute to better achievement,
Hoxby said.
"I think that one of the big things
to do is to follow these students
when they get out of high school
and go on to college," she said.
"We'd be disappointed if they did
better in eighth grade then find they
no longer improve."
But Hoxby stressed that the
results are not a mandate for char
ter schools.

"It's about learning what makes
schools work," she said. "The point
is to say, 'O.K., look, here are a set of
schools that are successful with dis
advantaged students, what can we
learn about these schools, and can
we apply these lessons to public
schools.'"
