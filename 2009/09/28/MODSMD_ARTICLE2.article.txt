## Senate will review new nominees NomCom replaces two over diversity concerns 
### TOM CORRIGAN 
Issues and events surrounding the
ASSU Nominations Commission
(NomCom) are set to take center
stage Tuesday at the first meeting of
the 11th Undergraduate Senate.

Two of six total nominations to
the Board of Judicial Affairs (BJA)
made by NomCom were rescinded
because the initial nominations did
not reflect an adequate level of gen
der diversity, according to NomCom
Chairperson and graduate student in
chemical engineering Jonathan
Bakke. NomCom has sole responsi
bility for student nominations to the
BJA as well as many other
University boards.
Jarrod Marks 'l2 and graduate
student Andrew Lee were replaced
with two female nominees, Allison
Rhines 'lO and Jazmin Holmes 'lO, in
a process beginning last June. The
new nominations will be presented
for approval at the Senate meeting
on Tuesday.
"What happened is the Office of
Judicial Affairs was specifically con
cerned about the gender balance,"
Bakke said. "They have some issues
that they want to deal with this year
that are gender sensitive, and that's
essentially why they came back to us
and said we can't accept these nomi
nees."

Morris Graves, the Judicial
Affairs officer who initially contact
ed Bakke, wrote in an email to The
Daily, "The Board on Judicial Affairs
needs to be reflective of the Stanford
community. The original slate
offered by NomCom did not reflect
the diversity of the Stanford commu
nity. Specifically, there was a gender
imbalance."
Students who serve on the BJA
are tasked with oversight, clarifica
tion and regular review of the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997.
They serve in conjunction with facul
ty and staff and meet regularly
throughout the year.
According to Bakke, the main
requirement for the initial BJA nom
inees was three undergraduate mem
bers and three graduate members.
All of the graduate applicants were
male, automatically adding three
men to the initial nominees.
Considering the undergrads sepa
rately, the commission originally
nominated two males and one
female.

The current standing of the BJA
nominees is two graduates and four
undergraduates: three men and
three women.

Bakke said he did not think qual
ity was sacrificed with the replace
ment of two of the original nomina
tions. "The Board of Judicial Affairs
is a very competitive committee and
there are a lot of great candidates.
The replacement candidates are
very qualified for the position," he
said.

Bakke was also eager to point out
that he thinks this issue should not
undermine all of the work that the
members of NomCom put into the
nomination process. According to
Bakke, NomCom processes over 200
applications and conducts over 150
interviews to fill the various
University committees it oversees.

The issue of NomCom nomina
tions will likely emerge at Tuesday
night's Senate meeting, the first of
the quarter. Two ASSU Senators
have publicly expressed serious
apprehensions about confirming the
new Judicial Affairs nominees.
Senator Zachary Warma 'll, also
columns editor for The Daily, refer
ring to the Non-Discrimination
Statement of the Joint Bylaws of the
ASSU, stated, "In my mind, the
Senate cannot constitutionally
approve the Judicial Affairs Board.
A spot was given to Jarrod Marks
based on his qualifications and track
record with Judicial Affairs, and he
was removed from the board in what
rings of discriminatory behavior."
Warma expressed his ardent
opposition to approving the new
nominations to the BJA. "Not only is
it the right thing to do and the con
stitutional thing to do; it's the smart
thing to do," he said. "I think my col
leagues in the Senate will be able to
see the rationale about the nature of
this issue."

One such colleague is Senator
Shelley Gao 'll, the only female
member of the Senate, who ques
tioned the legitimacy of the argu
ment that only women are capable

of bringing certain perspectives to
the BJA. Gao is a columnist for The
Daily.

"I really don't think that we
should be now launching into a huge
debate about whether we need to
increase female participation in stu
dent politics or start an affirmative
action program to ensure that the
female's point of view is included,"
she said. "We simply should not be
subverting a perfectly legitimate and
democratic process."

While Marks himself is hesitant
to say he was personally discriminat
ed against, saying that "this issue is
not about me, nor do I want this to
be about me," he said he feels that
the current nominations to the BJA
are not the most qualified for the
position.

"The Nominations Commission
was charged with the task of inter
viewing everybody and picking, out
of those people, the most qualified
individuals," he said. "Then, the
nomination slates were rejected. So,
by definition, they are now picking
people that they didn't originally
think were the best."
