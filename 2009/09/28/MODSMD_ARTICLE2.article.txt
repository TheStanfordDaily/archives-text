Issues and events surrounding the
ASSU Nominations Commission
(NomCom) are set to take center
stage Tuesday at the first meeting of
the 11th Undergraduate Senate.

Two of six total nominations to
the Board of Judicial Affairs (BJA)
made by NomCom were rescinded
because the initial nominations did
not reflect an adequate level of gen

Affairs officer who initially contact

Daily, "The Board on Judicial Affairs
needs to be reflective of the Stanford
community. The original slate
offered by NomCom did not reflect
the diversity of the Stanford commu

imbalance."
Students who serve on the BJA
are tasked with oversight, clarifica
tion and regular review of the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997.
They serve in conjunction with facul
ty and staff and meet regularly
throughout the year.
According to Bakke, the main
requirement for the initial BJA nom

bers and three graduate members.
All of the graduate applicants were
male, automatically adding three
