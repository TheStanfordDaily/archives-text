# Google honors late professor
## Prof. Rajeev Motwani remembered at Memorial Church, through endowed chair 
### AMY HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
Three months after the untimely death of com
puter science Prof. Rajeev Motwani, Google
announced Friday it will write Stanford a $2.5 mil
lion check for an endowed chair position in the
computer science department in Motwani's name.

The chair will honor the late professor who
helped Sergey Brin and Larry Page get their search
engine on its feet.

A renowned researcher and mentor to start-ups
and venture capitalists, Motwani died in June
when he drowned in his swimming pool in
Atherton, just after a party celebrating the end of
the school year with graduate students. His wife
and two daughters were already asleep when
Motwani, intoxicated and unable to swim, stum
bled home and fell into his backyard pool. He was
47 years old.

The Motwani Professorship
Jennifer Widom, department chair of computer sci
ence, announced Google's generous endowment at
Motwani's memorial service on Friday. Over 800 stu
dents, venture capitalists, faculty members and family
gathered in Memorial Chapel to remember the unas
suming man who helped define the Internet as we
know it.
"We'll find someone to teach Rajeev's classes,
although finding a theorist as inspiring to undergradu-


Motwani
ates and relevant to graduate students
as Rajeev is a tall challenge," Widom
told the audience. "He forged a unique
connection between the department
and the entrepreneurial world a
connection that was broad, deeply
technical and full of integrity. That's
something we simply can't replicate
with any other human being known to
us."

No stipulations were put on the
money for the chair, and the Motwani
professorship will go to a senior facul
ty member someone whose work
touches on Motwani's passion for fun
damental theory applied to practical
problems.

"We'd love to see someone that
possesses some of the primary traits
that Rajeev offered to students
someone who always thinks big and
always aspires to positively impact the
world," said Google spokesman David
Krane in an email to The Daily.
Jim Plummer, dean of the School of
Engineering, said a current member of
the computer science department will
be named to the chair in the upcoming
months.

"The new billet that is provided by
the new chair is used for a broad area
junior search in which we would
expect to hire the most exciting young
faculty member we can, independent
of the area in which he/she works,"
Plummer wrote in an email to The
Daily.

Google provided the $2.5 million
backing to get the chair up and run
ning (the endowment pays for a pro
fessor's salary and benefits), and the
School of Engineering committed the
remaining $1.5 million.
An endowed professorship typical
ly costs $4 million to establish and is
the highest honor Stanford can impart
to a faculty member.
The Motwani Professorship in
Computer Science is the first of 10 new
endowed chairs the University has
approved to expand the department.
There has been a boom in comput
er science (CS) enrollments at
Stanford over the years a 12 per
cent increase in the last academic year
alone. While Stanford's program is top
ranked, it is significantly smaller than
that of peer institutions UC-Berkeley
and MIT, whose faculties hover
between 45 and 50. Stanford's CS pro
gram retains about 35 or 36 fulltime
equivalent faculty.
"We ought to expand," Widom told
The Daily. "In these economic times,

though, that's difficult. Our hope is
that, with our connections to Silicon
Valley, the department can get more
donors."

The 10 new professorships are both
a response to a spike in student
demand and an increasing intersection
of CS with fields like biology, linguis
tics, education and engineering.
Widom predicts the University will
add one or two professorships a year.
Life
Rajeev Motwani was born in
Jammu, India to a Sindhi family and
grew up in New Delhi. His fascination
with numbers began when he was a
child, poring over the work of German
mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.
He decided to commit himself to math
and completed his B. Tech in
Computer Science from the Indian
Institute of Technology in Kanpur in
1983. He then came to the U.S., earning
his Ph.D. from UC-Berkeley in 1988.

Motwani came to the Farm soon
after his time at Berkeley in 1989, serv
ing as the director of graduate studies
for the computer science department.
He also founded the Mining Data at
Stanford project (MIDAS).

His research has stretched into a
range of computer science topics
including data mining, Web search and
information retrieval, robotics and the
oretical computer science,
Motwani is most recognized, how
ever, for his work on "randomized
algorithms," a sort of super-shortcut to
solve problems that involves so much
data that computing an answer would
be impossible. Motwani recognized
that you can't deal with that volume of
data, so he made life easier and only
searched a random subset of the data.

That approach was groundbreak
ing, and Google incorporated
Motwani's thinking into its search
engine software.
The Angel Investor
Motwani was the Obi-Wan of the
start-up world, most famously mentor
ing graduate students Brin and Page in
the mid-19905, when Google was just a
funny word and a new idea.
But the guys who started Google
were just two of hundreds of students
and future tech big-wigs whom
Motwani mentored.

Fifth-year graduate student in com
puter science Aleksandra Korolova
worked with Motwani for the last
three years on real-world algorithmic
problems facing tech companies and
social networking sites. She said
Motwani's philosophy on computer
science touched all of their academic
interactions; but what stood out most
in her mind was the character of the

man behind the math.

"He was an amazing mentor and
advisor," Korolova said, hard-pressed
to find the right words. "He was so gen
erous and humble with his time.
Whenever I talked to him, it was as if
there was nothing else on his calendar."
Legacy
"The breadth and depth of
Rajeev's contributions in academia
and industry are unparalleled in com
puter science," Brin, Google's co
founder and president for technology,
said on Friday. "Yet, they pale in com
parison to the impact he had through
the many researchers and entrepre
neurs whom he taught and mentored.
While I am sad to lose a good friend, I
know his spirit will live on through
generations of technologies and tech
nologists to come."
Brin wasn't alone in this thinking.

Just last week, a panel of luminaries
from Pan ITT â€”an umbrella alumni
association of the seven Indian
Institutes of Technology posthu
mously awarded Motwani its Lifetime
Achievement Award for his work in
spurring American business growth.
Pradeep Khosla, a longtime friend
of Motwani and fellow recipient of a
PAN lIT award, said Motwani man
aged to bridge the great divide
between the theoretical and practical
applications of CS, which made waves
in the computing world.
"Rajeev's research was in theoreti
cal computer science, but he always
had a very practical bent of mind,"
Khosla said. "Just look at his page
ranking algorithm. That was highly
theoretical but had a huge practical
impact and was the feed for a compa
ny like Google,"
Korolova, too, appreciated
Motwani's philosophical approach to
concrete problems. She said meetings
would start with him telling his gradu
ate students, "Here's a problem that
Google, Facebook or Loopt is having.
Let's help them figure it out.

"He would strike a balance
between the theoretical and the practi
cal and help us strike a balance," she
continued. "He would always encour
age us to find a problem that actually
matters."

Motwani will be remembered for
his research contributions to the field of
computer science, but perhaps his most
enduring legacy was his mentorship to
scores of students and companies.
"He was an entrepreneur that
never quite went out on his own,"
Khosla recalled fondly. "He just helped
everyone else get there."

applications of CS, which made waves
in the computing world.
"Rajeev's research was in theoreti

had a very practical bent of mind,"
Khosla said. "Just look at his page

theoretical but had a huge practical

Motwani's philosophical approach to

"He would strike a balance
between the theoretical and the practi
cal and help us strike a balance," she
continued. "He would always encour

matters."

Motwani will be remembered for
his research contributions to the field of
computer science, but perhaps his most
enduring legacy was his mentorship to

"He was an entrepreneur that
never quite went out on his own,"
Khosla recalled fondly. "He just helped
everyone else get there."

Three months after the untimely death of com
puter science Prof. Rajeev Motwani, Google
announced Friday it will write Stanford a $2.5 mil
lion check for an endowed chair position in the
computer science department in Motwani's name.

The chair will honor the late professor who
helped Sergey Brin and Larry Page get their search
engine on its feet.

A renowned researcher and mentor to start-ups
and venture capitalists, Motwani died in June
when he drowned in his swimming pool in
Atherton, just after a party celebrating the end of
the school year with graduate students. His wife
and two daughters were already asleep when
Motwani, intoxicated and unable to swim, stum
bled home and fell into his backyard pool. He was
47 years old.

The Motwani Professorship
Jennifer Widom, department chair of computer sci
ence, announced Google's generous endowment at
Motwani's memorial service on Friday. Over 800 stu
dents, venture capitalists, faculty members and family
gathered in Memorial Chapel to remember the unas
suming man who helped define the Internet as we
know it.
"We'll find someone to teach Rajeev's classes,
although finding a theorist as inspiring to undergradu-


Motwani
ates and relevant to graduate students
as Rajeev is a tall challenge," Widom
told the audience. "He forged a unique
connection between the department
and the entrepreneurial world a
connection that was broad, deeply
technical and full of integrity. That's
something we simply can't replicate
with any other human being known to
us."

No stipulations were put on the
money for the chair, and the Motwani
professorship will go to a senior facul
ty member someone whose work
touches on Motwani's passion for fun
damental theory applied to practical
problems.

"We'd love to see someone that
possesses some of the primary traits
that Rajeev offered to students
someone who always thinks big and
always aspires to positively impact the
world," said Google spokesman David
Krane in an email to The Daily.
Jim Plummer, dean of the School of
Engineering, said a current member of
the computer science department will
be named to the chair in the upcoming
months.

"The new billet that is provided by
the new chair is used for a broad area
junior search in which we would
expect to hire the most exciting young
faculty member we can, independent
of the area in which he/she works,"
Plummer wrote in an email to The
Daily.

Google provided the $2.5 million
backing to get the chair up and run
ning (the endowment pays for a pro
fessor's salary and benefits), and the
School of Engineering committed the
remaining $1.5 million.
An endowed professorship typical
ly costs $4 million to establish and is
the highest honor Stanford can impart
to a faculty member.
The Motwani Professorship in
Computer Science is the first of 10 new
endowed chairs the University has
approved to expand the department.
There has been a boom in comput
er science (CS) enrollments at
Stanford over the years a 12 per
cent increase in the last academic year
alone. While Stanford's program is top
ranked, it is significantly smaller than
that of peer institutions UC-Berkeley
and MIT, whose faculties hover
between 45 and 50. Stanford's CS pro
gram retains about 35 or 36 fulltime
equivalent faculty.
"We ought to expand," Widom told
The Daily. "In these economic times,

though, that's difficult. Our hope is
that, with our connections to Silicon
Valley, the department can get more
donors."

The 10 new professorships are both
a response to a spike in student
demand and an increasing intersection
of CS with fields like biology, linguis
tics, education and engineering.
Widom predicts the University will
add one or two professorships a year.
Life
Rajeev Motwani was born in
Jammu, India to a Sindhi family and
grew up in New Delhi. His fascination
with numbers began when he was a
child, poring over the work of German
mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.
He decided to commit himself to math
and completed his B. Tech in
Computer Science from the Indian
Institute of Technology in Kanpur in
1983. He then came to the U.S., earning
his Ph.D. from UC-Berkeley in 1988.

Motwani came to the Farm soon
after his time at Berkeley in 1989, serv
ing as the director of graduate studies
for the computer science department.
He also founded the Mining Data at
Stanford project (MIDAS).

His research has stretched into a
range of computer science topics
including data mining, Web search and
information retrieval, robotics and the
oretical computer science,
Motwani is most recognized, how
ever, for his work on "randomized
algorithms," a sort of super-shortcut to
solve problems that involves so much
data that computing an answer would
be impossible. Motwani recognized
that you can't deal with that volume of
data, so he made life easier and only
searched a random subset of the data.

That approach was groundbreak
ing, and Google incorporated
Motwani's thinking into its search
engine software.
The Angel Investor
Motwani was the Obi-Wan of the
start-up world, most famously mentor
ing graduate students Brin and Page in
the mid-19905, when Google was just a
funny word and a new idea.
But the guys who started Google
were just two of hundreds of students
and future tech big-wigs whom
Motwani mentored.

Fifth-year graduate student in com
puter science Aleksandra Korolova
worked with Motwani for the last
three years on real-world algorithmic
problems facing tech companies and
social networking sites. She said
Motwani's philosophy on computer
science touched all of their academic
interactions; but what stood out most
in her mind was the character of the

man behind the math.

"He was an amazing mentor and
advisor," Korolova said, hard-pressed
to find the right words. "He was so gen
erous and humble with his time.
Whenever I talked to him, it was as if
there was nothing else on his calendar."
Legacy
"The breadth and depth of
Rajeev's contributions in academia
and industry are unparalleled in com
puter science," Brin, Google's co
founder and president for technology,
said on Friday. "Yet, they pale in com
parison to the impact he had through
the many researchers and entrepre
neurs whom he taught and mentored.
While I am sad to lose a good friend, I
know his spirit will live on through
generations of technologies and tech
nologists to come."
Brin wasn't alone in this thinking.

Just last week, a panel of luminaries
from Pan ITT â€”an umbrella alumni
association of the seven Indian
Institutes of Technology posthu
mously awarded Motwani its Lifetime
Achievement Award for his work in
spurring American business growth.
Pradeep Khosla, a longtime friend
of Motwani and fellow recipient of a
PAN lIT award, said Motwani man
aged to bridge the great divide
between the theoretical and practical
applications of CS, which made waves
in the computing world.
"Rajeev's research was in theoreti
