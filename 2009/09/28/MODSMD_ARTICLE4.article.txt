# DOWNING U-DUB
## Card sits alone atop Pac-10 after 34-14 win 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Chris Owusu got the ball rolling, Toby
Gerhart pushed it down the hill and the
Cardinal (3-1, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
rolled right over the hapless No. 24
Washington Huskies (2-2, 1-1 Pac-10) at
Stanford Stadium on Saturday night. The
34-14 final was a testament to an epically
dominant rushing attack, dangerous spe
cial teams and a defense that's starting to
gel for a Stanford team that, at 2-0 in con
ference, sits alone atop the Pac-10.
For the second straight week, Owusu

returned the opening kickoff to notch his
third return touchdown of the season in
just four games, he has already tied the
Pac-10 season record. The sophomore
leads the nation in both return TDs and
kickoff return average.
While that would be his only touch on
special teams, as the Huskies elected to
kick away from him for the rest of the
evening, his effect was felt throughout the
contest â€”by forcing Washington to
pooch kick, Stanford was effectively gifted
the ball between the 30 and 40 yard lines

Redshirt freshman quarterback Andrew Luck and his teammates had reason to celebrate after making the Huskies' win over USC
look like little more than a fluke. Despite Luck's own fluke, a pass gone wrong in the first quarter, the Card found victory over UW.

whenever the Huskies kicked off. By
contrast, due to the Cardinal's cover
age teams, Washington was routinely
starting drives from inside the 20.
"You want to set a tone early.
That's the first opportunity to do that.
It really does set a tone," said Coach
Jim Harbaugh. "It helps for field posi
tion the rest of the game,"
Owusu gave Stanford an early lead
and destroyed any momentum that
Washington may have had after their
upset of USC just a week ago, but it
was Gerhart who was the relentless
punisher. His career-high of 200 yards
rushing keyed a Cardinal ground at
tack that went for 321 yards in total.
"It's exciting. That's what we al
ways talk about shoot for 200,"
Gerhart said. "We were just going to
go at them. They're a good defense.
We were just going to go downhill. We
ran with a ton of power it's just a
mindset."

For the second straight week, red
shirt freshman quarterback Andrew
Luck was asked to do little else except
to hand the ball off to Gerhart and the
rest of the backs. While Washington's
run defense was far from brilliant en
tering the game, they certainly did not
seem as porous as they did on Satur
day, when they could do literally noth
ing to stop the Cardinal from moving
the ball whenever it wanted.
Much of that had to do with the of
fensive line play, which relentlessly
created holes for the Stanford backs
and seemed to get at least three yards
of push almost immediately after the

snap of the ball.
"It was another sensational per
formance by our line," Harbaugh said.
Luck, who ran for 59 yards of his
own, echoed his coach's thoughts.
"With our offensive line, we can't be
stopped," he said.
Gerhart had 156 yards in the first
half alone, almost double what the
Huskies accumulated as a team. Sixty
of those yards came at a time when
Stanford needed them most.

Despite dominating Washington
early in the game, Stanford was un
able to put much distance between it
self and the Huskies on the score
board. Gerhart fumbled in the red
zone on the Cardinal's first drive, and
a bizarre, if not undisciplined play led
to a tie game late in the first quarter.
Luck, pressured in the pocket, de
cided to scramble, only to toss the ball
to senior tight end Jim Dray at the last
moment. But the pass was backward
and Dray couldn't corral it Wash
ington's Justin Glenn picked up the
ball and stood around, assuming an
incomplete pass, as did the other 21
players on the field. But the officials
never blew the play dead, and after a
few seconds of indecision, Glenn
sprinted into the end zone to tie the
game.

"I was honestly going to give it
back to the ref and I looked at him
and he looked back at me and I was
like, 'Oh, the play's not dead,' so I just
took off running," Glenn said.
Luck didn't shy away from respon
sibility. "It was boneheaded, imma

ture," he said.
But his senior tailback was there to
make sure that the game didn't spiral
out of hand on the first play of the
ensuing drive, Gerhart rumbled and
stumbled 60 yards to pay dirt, shaking
off would-be tacklers and staying on
his feet long enough for Delano How
ell and Ryan Whalen to establish and
maintain their downfield blocks.

11l ere was plenty of credit to go
around.

"Jim Dray just moves people, and
[junior fullback] Owen [Marecic]

you can never give enough compli
ments to Owen," Gerhart said. "And
receivers downfield ... it was just a
team effort."

"That one was tough," Glenn said.
"There's no excuses for missed tack
les. All the guys they came out and
we missed some key tackles, and
when you do that, it leads to big
plays."

But Gerhart wasn't the only one to
get into the action. After junior Jere
my Stewart, the top reserve tailback,
went down with an injury in the first
half, freshmen Stepfan Taylor and
Tyler Gaffney saw considerable play
ing time. On the same possession in
the second quarter, Gaffney hauled in
his first career reception on third and
10 to keep the Cardinal drive alive,
and Taylor capped it off with his first
career touchdown run. That pushed
the score to 24-14, and Stanford never
looked back.

While the offense was certainly
clicking, the defense came through

with a fine performance on nearly all
fronts. Washington's Jake Locker, the
best passer in the conference and one
of the top quarterbacks nationally,
turned in his worst performance of
the season, as he threw two terrible in
terceptions right into Howell's gut
and showed little of the playmaking
ability that has made him a household
name.

"We weren't expecting them to be
letting up at all. They came out and
played hard but we just wanted it
more," said senior linebacker Clinton
Snyder, who was a force throughout
the night. He led the Cardinal with
nine tackles and seemed to be con
stantly around the ball no matter
where it was on the field.
The defensive line was also no
table, especially in the second half.
Washington began the third quarter
with the ball and a chance to cut the
Stanford lead to a single score. But
Ekom Udofia and all of his friends
would have none of that, as tackles
and ends alike combined to sack and
hurry Locker and prevent tailback
Chris Polk from getting much of any
thing on the ground.
"I thought our defensive line did a
heck of a job," Harbaugh said. "The
coverage was tighter and we forced
[Locker] into some bad decisions. Got
some hits, some sacks and some
turnovers, which was big."
The end result was the dismantling
of an upstart Washington team that
appeared deflated from the opening
kick onward. Chants of "overrated"
rained down from arguably the most
audible crowd of Harbaugh's tenure.
The fans, newfound and old, seem
to be realizing the same thing: that
something special is brewing for Car

dinal football. But the tests will not let
up: UCLA, the lone unbeaten team in
the conference, comes north next
weekend in a battle of two squads that
are progressing upward at nearly the
same rate. And with a brutal stretch to
finish the season, these midyear
games matter tremendously for Stan
ford's bowl aspirations.

"Every week is going to be like
this. There's going to be a tough oppo
nent, a worthy opponent, a Pac-10 op
ponent," Harbaugh said.
"Today is step one, but next week
is going be the same situation."
