# DOWNING U-DUB
## Card sits alone atop Pac-10 after 34-14 win 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Chris Owusu got the ball rolling, Toby
Gerhart pushed it down the hill and the
Cardinal (3-1, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
rolled right over the hapless No. 24
Washington Huskies (2-2, 1-1 Pac-10) at
Stanford Stadium on Saturday night. The
34-14 final was a testament to an epically
dominant rushing attack, dangerous spe
cial teams and a defense that's starting to
gel for a Stanford team that, at 2-0 in con
ference, sits alone atop the Pac-10.
For the second straight week, Owusu

returned the opening kickoff to notch his
third return touchdown of the season in
just four games, he has already tied the
Pac-10 season record. The sophomore
leads the nation in both return TDs and
kickoff return average.
While that would be his only touch on
special teams, as the Huskies elected to
kick away from him for the rest of the
evening, his effect was felt throughout the
contest â€”by forcing Washington to
pooch kick, Stanford was effectively gifted
the ball between the 30 and 40 yard lines

Redshirt freshman quarterback Andrew Luck and his teammates had reason to celebrate after making the Huskies' win over USC
look like little more than a fluke. Despite Luck's own fluke, a pass gone wrong in the first quarter, the Card found victory over UW.
