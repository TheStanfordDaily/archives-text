## Fundraising effort passes key milestone $4.3 billion target for Stanford Challenge met two years early 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Challenge, an ambitious University
fundraising effort, has passed its $4.3 billion goal two
years early. But despite the milestone, broad fundrais
ing needs associated with The Challenge still remain.
Launched in fall 2006, the five-year effort sought
$1.4 billion for multidisciplinary initiatives, $1,175 bil
lion for initiatives to improve education and $1,725
billion for core support of Stanford teaching and
research.
Despite reaching the goal before the 2011 deadline,
Stanford administrators say several objectives have
not yet been reached, and some departments are still
lacking.
"We passed the $4.3 billion milestone in April,
which is a wonderful testament to the vision of our
academic leadership, the confidence of our extraordi
nary volunteers and the remarkable generosity of
alumni, parents, students and friends," said Vice
President for Development Martin Shell in an email
to The Daily.
"That said, the work of The Stanford Challenge is
by no means complete," he continued. "We have a
number of very important needs that have not been
met. Chief needs among these are additional support
for the students and faculty who make Stanford what
it is."
Graduate fellowships, endowed undergraduate
need-based scholarships and professorships are main
focuses for the remainder of the campaign.
Increased giving to The Stanford Fund (TSF) is
"absolutely necessary" for the University to meet
financial aid obligations, said Shell, along with contin
uation of the Senior Class Gift Campaign.
"The Senior Class Gift Campaign is an extremely
important effort through which grad
uating seniors make a gift of any size
to TSF in commemoration of their
time at Stanford," Shell said. "That
campaign will kick off later this year."
Richard Sailer, dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, added
that further fundraising is necessary
for a new biology building and a new
art building.
"The success in previous years was
such that we passed the dollar goal,
but what you have to understand is
that that total comprised a number of
categories of need," Sailer said.
Despite what Shell referred to as a
"dip last year in overall giving," due

to the current economic recession, he
says fundraising strategies have
remained the same.
"Our approaches to engaging our
prospects have remained constant, no
matter the economic circumstances,"
he said. He described the approaches
as getting to know donors and pairing
their interests with specific areas of
need at Stanford.
One major success he noted was
the $lOO million given to the new
Precourt Institute for Energy and the
TomKat Center for Sustainable
Energy last January.
But Sailer marks fundraising as
having declined about 20 percent in
the past year.
"We understood that donors
would be, in some cases, reluctant to
make new commitments right now,"
he said, "and so we have made an
effort to be sure that we thank the

donors that we've had and let them
know how much we appreciate their
generosity."
Regardless of the current eco
nomic state, Stanford continues to be
one of the leading fundraisers among
national universities, including 32
other schools involved in similar chal
lenges, according to The Chronicle of
Higher Education.
"This is not a competition, and we
are not trying to beat other schools,"
Shell said. "To have secured this level
of support during one of the toughest
economies since the Great
Depression is a testament to the
power of the ideas that are embed
ded within this campaign and the
generosity of the University's
donors."
