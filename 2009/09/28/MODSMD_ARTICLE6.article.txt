# So Much More Room for Activities
## BUSINESS SCHOOL Q&A with GSB Dean Garth Saloner 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Garth Saloner became dean of
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business on Sept. 1.
Stanford Daily (SD): With the upcom
ing completion of the Knight
Building, the new curriculum and
budget cuts, the GSB is undergoing a
period of change. As dean, what long
term goals do you have for the GSB?
Garth Saloner (GS): The three things
that we've been working on the last
few years that remain on our agenda
are completing a successful campus,
continuing to refine and optimize the
curriculum, and thirdly, to increase the
extent of collaboration between the
GSB and the rest of the University ...

The campus still is just going up, and
it's not so much about the physical

space but about how we use that
space. So, that is something that we as
a community will have to work hard
on in the next few months, to make
sure it's the kind of physical space that
we really want.
The new curriculum we're very
pleased with the basic structure, but
we have an audit underway now that's
looking at what's working well, where
are some areas for improvement,
what kind of changes might we make
... I think we're at a leading position
in curriculum change and we want to
make sure that we get it really right.
One of the incredible things about
being here is that we have a medical
school hundreds of yards away, an
engineering school hundreds of yards
away, sciences, law, education, HMS,
all within easy reach of the GSB, so
really enabling the free flow of ideas,
people and students across those
boundaries is a very important goal

and initiative for us.
So, it's really more about continu
ity than change.

SD: Going off what you said about
inter-school collaborations, what are
you hoping to achieve through these
collaborations? Have there been suc
cessful collaborations in the past?

GS: We have a number of huge suc
cesses, for example in the D-school,
one of our faculty members, Jim Patel,
teaches a course which is called
"Design for Extreme Affordability,"
so that's a setting where you bring
together business and engineering
students and other students from
across the campus. They actually got.
.. into countries in the developing
world, and they looked at what are the
real problems that people on the

ground are facing, and then they bring
those problems back, and they say,
'How do we design products that
address those needs that can be man
ufactured at extremely low cost?' The
idea is you start with a real problem,
you use the technological knowledge
that we have on this campus to figure
out how to address the problem from
a manufacturing point of view, and
then the business students ask, 'Well
how do you build a start-up enterprise
around that can take these products,
manufacturing them at low cost, and
deliver them into those countries?'
Time Magazine just had a list of 25
leading responsible entities, and three
of those entities are GSB entities, and
two of them came out of the D-course.
So, that's a huge success. We talk about
the GSB mantra, 'Change Lives,
Change Organizations, Change the
World.' Well, those are students that
are really doing that. That's not really
possible in any school on a stand
alone basis you can do the engi
neering component in an engineering
school, but that has to be matched
with the business expertise around
manufacturing and distribution, target
markets, all that. So that's what we
have in mind. When we say collabora
tion, it's bringing students, faculty,
ideas, research from across disciplines
and across schools, because we believe
that's how you solve the really big
problems in the world.

SD: A lot of graduates, including
MBA graduates, are not finding jobs
in this economy, and going to business
school is a big investment of both time
and money. What advice would you
give to students who are undergrads
choosing whether to go to business
school or recent graduates searching
for a job?

GS: Well, I think that despite the cur
rent situation that we're in now, this is
not permanent. We're already seeing
signs that the economy is recovering,
and it will come back. So the right
question to ask if you're an under
graduate thinking about business
school is, 'ls business school going to
propel me into the kind of life and
career that I want to have?' The way
we think about the Stanford MBA is
that it is two years where we take stu
dents with very high potential and we

launch them into a life of meaning
and impact. So, that's what it's really
about, and if that's you want, you have
high aspirations and you want to go
out and really do something great,
then this is an education and a plat
form that can help you do that.
For our graduates, my advice to
them is still to follow their passions and
stay true to what they want to do. It
does mean you have to in some cases
do a more tailored job search. I think
being passive and waiting for on-cam
pus recruiting and pick from one of
those options... is going to be more
challenging this year. So, you have to
ask, where do I want to go, where do I
want to take my career and my life,
what is the next step toward that, and
then be proactive about searching. We
have a new director of the [Career
Management Center] who also very
much has this philosophy. He will real
ly help and guide students toward the
next step on the journey.
SD: Since you've been dean for
almost a month now, have you discov
ered any unexpected responsibilities
or tasks that come with the position?
GS: Well, I was here for almost 20
years as a faculty member, so I've had
a pretty good sense of the school and
where we're going... Even so, part of
the excitement is how many opportu
nities you have to do things, and the
biggest challenge is how many hours
there are in the day to do all the things
you want to do. So, yes, I've been most
surprised by the time challenge,
SD: Despite the budget cuts, what are
you not willing to compromise?
GS: This school is built on a world
class, outstanding faculty from which
everything else flows. That's how we
educate our students. So, we have to
continue to attract and retain the best
faculty in the world. The second is
we're in the very fortunate position of

attracting the highest-potential stu
dents that go to business school, and
then having the privilege of helping
launch their careers. And we have to
maintain that position and continue to
attract the best students, and the way
we do that is by giving the best educa
tion and experience. We won't com
promise on those two things which are
the core legs of the GSB stool.
The third is more related to where
we are the Knight Management
Center. This is a colossal investment
for us. I have no doubt the physical
facility will go up it's going up
but the question is how do you make
that facility really live? How do you
imbue it with a dynamism and energy
that is an attractor for people, not just
for our faculty and students, but for
students in other departments as
well? You know Kresge has been torn
down, but we are building a 600-per
son lecture hall which is designed to
pick up the slack from Kresge. That's
wonderful for us because it puts those
big-audience facilities at the heart of
the GSB. So that should draw under
graduates, graduate students, faculty
from other schools to the GSB.
SD: Is classroom time a big priority?

GS: Classroom time is an output.
Given what we're trying to accom
plish educationally, how much class
room time â€”we have no plans to
change our classroom time at all. I do
think that as times move forward
I'm just speculating as technology
changes around, we do have to be
thoughtful about what's the best way
to engage students in various parts of
learning. Some of that is still best
found in the classroom, but I think
universities will have to be open and
flexible about using technology and
other means of educating in addition
to classroom.
