# So Much More Room for Activities
## BUSINESS SCHOOL Q&A with GSB Dean Garth Saloner 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Garth Saloner became dean of
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business on Sept. 1.
Stanford Daily (SD): With the upcom
ing completion of the Knight
Building, the new curriculum and
budget cuts, the GSB is undergoing a
period of change. As dean, what long
term goals do you have for the GSB?
Garth Saloner (GS): The three things
that we've been working on the last
few years that remain on our agenda
are completing a successful campus,
continuing to refine and optimize the
curriculum, and thirdly, to increase the
extent of collaboration between the
GSB and the rest of the University ...

The campus still is just going up, and
it's not so much about the physical

space but about how we use that
space. So, that is something that we as
a community will have to work hard
on in the next few months, to make
sure it's the kind of physical space that
we really want.
The new curriculum we're very
pleased with the basic structure, but
we have an audit underway now that's
looking at what's working well, where
are some areas for improvement,
what kind of changes might we make
... I think we're at a leading position
in curriculum change and we want to
make sure that we get it really right.
One of the incredible things about
being here is that we have a medical
school hundreds of yards away, an
engineering school hundreds of yards
away, sciences, law, education, HMS,
all within easy reach of the GSB, so
really enabling the free flow of ideas,
people and students across those
boundaries is a very important goal

and initiative for us.
So, it's really more about continu
ity than change.

SD: Going off what you said about
inter-school collaborations, what are
you hoping to achieve through these
collaborations? Have there been suc
cessful collaborations in the past?

GS: We have a number of huge suc
cesses, for example in the D-school,
one of our faculty members, Jim Patel,
teaches a course which is called
"Design for Extreme Affordability,"
so that's a setting where you bring
together business and engineering
students and other students from
across the campus. They actually got.
.. into countries in the developing
world, and they looked at what are the
real problems that people on the
