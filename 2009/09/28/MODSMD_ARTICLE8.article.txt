## HARD TO CONCENTRATE New study at Stanford demonstrates poorer cognitive performance in multitaskers, even when switching to single tasks 
### STACIECHAN STAFF WRITER 
If you're reading this article while checking your
email, listening to music and waiting for your
morning coffee to be ready, you might as well just
stop reading.
Stanford researchers Eyal Ophir B.A. 'OB, M.S. 'O9,
Communication Prof. Cliff Nass and Psychology Prof.
Anthony Wagner have found that, in a series of cogni
tive tasks, heavy multi-taskers performed significantly
worse than light multi-taskers across the board.
"Turns out these people who run around gloating
that they're so good at multi-tasking really suck at it!"
Nass exclaimed.
After an article on the study was published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS),
media from around the world CNN, the BBC, NPR and
The New York Times, to name a few have been report
ing similar findings on the subject. Conan O'Brien even
included the study in one of his jokes, Ophir said.
Two and a half years ago, what started out as a casu
al analysis of then-Communication Prof. Don Roberts'
research for Kaiser eventually evolved into a full
fledged series of studies that revealed startling implica
tions for all tech-savvy, plugged-in individuals.
"We wanted to know: 'How do these multitaskers con
trol all the information bombarding them?'" Ophir said.

To answer this question, the researchers surveyed 160
Stanford students, each classified as either a "heavy" multi
tasker or a "light" multitasker. The first task concentrated
on multitaskers' ability to control their attention and filter
irrelevant information. .

The results? "[Heavy

multitaskers] are lousy at

ignoring irrelevant
information!" Nass
said.

This poorer per-

formance also

translated to,
heavy multi
taskers' inability
to organize infor-

mation in their
heads, as the sec
ond study demon
strated.

"They have real-

ly messy filing cabinets in their

heads," Nass explained.

During the study, researchers
discovered that decision multitask- '
ing really consisted of task-switching

shifting from Task A to Task B at

incredible speeds. So, researchers surmised, perhaps heavy
multitaskers were better at task-switching. Nope, light

multitaskers still outper-

formed their counterparts.
But before you
destroy all your fancy tech-

nology that allows you to per
form five tasks at once, Ophir
provides some words of caution:
" [Multitasking]'s just a differ-

ence in orientation, rather than a

good or bad thing," he said. "Heavy
multitaskers just might be more respon-

sive to the environment while light multi
taskers might be more focused on their

tasks.

"Certain
situations call
for multitask
ing, like if you
were talking
' on your cell
phone while
driving. You'd

have to be able to hold a conversation while still looking
out for sudden distractions," he continued.
But, Ophir explained, "the bottom line is that distrac
tions are distracting. People think they can work while
having things in the background, but the science seems to
say otherwise. My friends have told me that they've decid
ed to block out all media for certain periods of time, and

their productivity just skyrocketed."
Future studies seek to answer exactly in which situa
tions multitasking is beneficial rather than detrimental.
They also attempt to pinpoint the appeal of multitask
ing and what the cause and effect cycle is do people
who multitask become worse at multitasking? Or are
people who like to multitask just bad at multitasking?
Another relevant topic regarding multitasking is its
effect on students' grades.
"I'm getting a lot of calls from PTAs asking: 'Are we
destroying our kids?"' Nass said. "Multitasking might be
creating people who may not be able to pay attention."
Though the researchers have made groundbreaking
discoveries, these have also produced more questions.
The relative newness of the field, says Nass, provides
endless opportunities for students to break major
ground in the field.
"Students can do some amazing research hot off the
press and have enough societal consequence and make
a big difference," Nass said. "And the opportunity to
make major discoveries is extremely large you don't
have to be a super expert to do it."
But if you do decide to pursue studies in the multi
tasking field, just make sure you aren't running more
than one study at once,
Wagner was unable for comment.
