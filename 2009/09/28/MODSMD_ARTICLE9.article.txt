A. list of amusing quotes overheard from this weekend's parties:
Freshman Boy, standing outside Sigma Chi's backyard:
"I wish I were Mario so I could wall jump."
Upperclassman Boy, sprawled on the ground:
"Is this real life???" [laughs hysterically] "No ... if this were real life it would be
weird, because there would be four of you."
Freshman Girl, in line at The Axe and Palm:
"I heard SAE is the substance-free dorm on campus."
On the way to the row, Group of Freshman Boys, next to recycling bins:
Boy 1: "Hey, look, [4th friend] is coming."
Boy 2: "O-M-G, let's scare him what should we do?"
Boy 3: "Look, there's three trash cans. We should hide behind the three of them
like the grouch."
Freshman Boy 1, trying to climb a fence.
Friend of Freshman Boy 1: "Hey, [Freshman Boy I], I can see your tampon string."
Upperclassman Girl 1: "I have to leave. I have staff meeting early tomorrow morning."
Upperclassman Girl 2: "Oh, what a coincidence! Your mom also has staff meeting
early tomorrow morning."
