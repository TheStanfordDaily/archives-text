£ £ "j~ mm mm. we have a problem."
Those are EXACTLY the words you
want to hear at 5:15 a.m. at some random
airport in Rome.
Approximately 20 seconds earlier, I had
handed over my passport to the blonde
check-in attendant at the counter of my fa
vorite European budget airline. After the
scarce hour and a half of sleep I had gotten
the night before, I was too exhausted to
blink, much less remember what the word
problem meant.
"What do you mean? What's a prob
lem?"

"See this abbreviation? You're at the
wrong airport."
Silence, A little trickle of sleep drool
rolled out of the left corner of my mouth as
I continued to gape, dumbfounded, at the at
tendant, unable to muster the energy to
wipe away the drool, much less comprehend
the message she had just delivered.
"SHIT!"

I turned around just in time to see my two
travel companions, who had evidently un
derstood the message a little faster than I
had, yell the very obscenity amid the crowd
of sleeping babies, Blackberry-clad busi
nessmen and tired-looking twenty-some
things in line at the Easy Jet check in.
I turned back to the attendant.
"You're kidding," I said.
Unfortunately, she was not. Apparently
employees at airports aren't really allowed
to 'kid' much anymore.
As I continued to stare, and my neurons
vaguely started to grasp the concept that I
probably going to have to fork over a ton of
Euros to get another ticket to Venice and
would probably NOT be sleeping (uncom
fortably on a plane in the next hour like I
had hoped, all of a sudden I heard hysterical
laughter behind me.
It was my two companions whom I had
been traveling with for the past five days,
doubled over their suitcases, laughing so
hard that tears were rolling down their faces.
"I CAN'T-gasp-BELIEVE-gasp-HA
HAHAHAHA WE GOT-gasp-HAHA
THE WRONG AIRPORT!!!"

At first I was completely taken aback.
Then, I started to laugh. The blonde behind
the counter wore an incredulous look on her
face; either she was flabbergasted that I was

capable of any facial expression (other than
the open-jawed drool) or she had just men
tally added us to her list of deranged Amer
icans.

We ended up having to pay 40 euro each
to buy a train ticket that would deliver us to
our destination 12 hours later than antici
pated. While waiting for the train, my male
companion got berated by a homeless
woman in incomprehensible Italian for
charging his iPhone in the only outlet in Mc-
Donald's. My girlfriend and I got practically
thrown out of the bookstore for casually at
tempting to sleep on the back of the new
Dan Brown display (I guess drool on the
merchandise isn't really an 'in' thing right
now). And, to top it all off, we each con
sumed about 14,000 calories in McDonald's
comfort food (Crispy Mcßacons for the
win!). Every single thing that could have
gone wrong that day did. By all traditional
accounts, it should have been the worst days
of my life.

With that said, it was one of the most hi
larious days of the trip and arguably one of
the best days of my life. At the risk of sound
ing cheesy, it made me realize that it isn't re
ally about what you do, but whom you're
with. We were tired, miserable, sick and hun
gry, in a dirty bus station in the middle of
Rome, but we could not stop laughing. We
were stuck in the face of a horrible travel
mix-up in the middle of a country where
none of us knew the language. But somehow
we made it work.

We arrived three days later in Spain for
Stanford in Madrid orientation. Once again,
we were two hours late, tired, sweaty and
hungry. But as far as I was concerned, walk
ing into the orientation dinner and being able
to hug friends I hadn't seen in three months
was one of the best parts of my summer.
I guess everything really is what you
make of it. Sometimes you miss a flight,
sometimes you go to the wrong airport, and
some days you just can't stop drooling. But
in any case, although they may be just as
smelly, dirty, hungry and tired as you, always
love the ones you're with.

You'll be happy to know that Molly is current
ly freshly showered and fed, but she has to
wake up in four hours, obviously with subse
quent open-mouthed sleep-drooling. Care to
join in the vapid staring into space? Contact
