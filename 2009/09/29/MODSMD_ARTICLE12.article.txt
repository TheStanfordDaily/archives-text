# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## On open access, Stanford's leadership falters 
### Danny Crichton 
There is nothing quite like the ecstasy
that follows the eleventh-hour discov
ery of the perfect source for one's re
search paper. Reading the abstract, every
thing starts to fit, and this capstone citation
will end the drafting process after days of
weaving different sources. Then, that ecstasy
is suddenly replaced with virulent anger as
the screen announces that access can be
bought for a measly $35.
Stanford University is gifted to have the
resources to purchase thousands of journal
subscriptions. Nonetheless, no budget, how
ever large, can provide access to the immense
number of published journals. Invariably, a
critical article is not accessible by researchers
at this school. As library budgets are cut na
tionwide due to the economic recession, it is
time for universities to rethink the academic
publishing model. The answer lies in open-ac
cess journal articles.
This need was answered last week by a
consortium of schools calling itself the Com
pact for Open-Access Publishing Equity. A
mouthful of a title, but one with a very simple
goal: to place open-access publishers on an
equal footing with their more common sub
scription-based competitors.
The five schools that joined the compact
are Harvard, Dartmouth, Cornell, MIT and
our rivals across the Bay, Berkeley. Stanford's
name is quite conspicuously absent from this
list. Our school has been one of the leaders of
this movement for many years, and thus, it is
discouraging to see that other schools are car
rying the torch for this necessary push.
To understand the systemic problems of
journal publishing, we need to look at some of
the policies and economics that prevent re
search articles from being freely distributed.
First, professors generally lose the copyright
on their articles when they submit it to a journal
for publication. This means that a professor
must pay the publisher to make copies of his or

her own original work.This is part of the reason
why course readers are expensive, and why
freely distributing articles can be difficult to ac
complish it's illegal in many cases.
If that were not outrageous enough, most
journals are run by professors who provide
editorial and peer review services, generally
without compensation (such "service" can
count for tenure). The profits of the journal
do not go back to those who write the articles,
nor to those who edit or peer review them.
They only go back to those who run the jour
nal's subscriptions.
Another major roadblock is that many
journals are published by non-profit academ
ic societies, who rely on the revenues from
journals to sustain their operation. The Mass
achusetts Medical Society is not widely
known except for publishing the New Eng
land Journal of Medicine one of the med
ical field's top journals. While these groups'
goals are often compatible with open access,
their actions tell a very different story.
The alternative to subscription models
open access are hardly cesspools of aca
demic thought. The Public Library of Science
runs several open-access journals, such as
PLoS Biology and PLoS One, which are high
ly regarded. These journals have the same
high standards and peer review policies, but
alter the economics to increase access to the
public and universities.
Stanford has forcefully taken on this issue
in the past. Last year, Stanford's School of Ed
ucation became the first institution of its kind

to require that all faculty articles be openly
available. While this came after an announce
ment by Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sci
ences in a similar initiative, it was an example
of Stanford leadership at its finest.

With the announcement of this new con
sortium, Stanford appears to be trending be
hind its peer institutions in this battle over
publishing. As one of the best schools in the
country, Stanford has a disproportionate in
fluence on the outcome of this competition.
Like McDonald's or Wal-Mart, a policy
change by Stanford can have broad repercus
sions throughout the industry. Few journals
can afford to have researchers from Harvard,
Stanford and MIT blacklisted. We are the
ones in power.
It is ironic that the educational institution
at the forefront of the Internet revolution
would seem to be so slow to realize the bene
fits of open publishing. Stanford's record in
cludes creating one of the best digital reposi
tories of academic articles with High Wire
Press (itself possessing a strong record re
garding openness their Web site states that
they have made nearly two million articles
free). Stanford is also part of Google's Books
Project, which aims to digitize all books for
online access.

I sincerely hope that Stanford was simply
not notified that this new consortium was
being formed. Yet, I remain skeptical. Stan
ford is one of the most obvious candidates to
join such a consortium, especially since our
peer institutions constitute the founding
members. Our motto at Stanford is "The Wind
of Freedom Blows." Let us take that motto to
heart and open up the best research on Earth.
Join the coalition and fight for open access.
