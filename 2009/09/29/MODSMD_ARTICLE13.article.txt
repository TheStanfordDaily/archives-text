Re. "Prof, shows charter school efficacy,"
Sept. 28,2009

Dear Editor,
I extend my congratulations to Prof.
Caroline Hoxby for her important study on
the efficacy of charter schools. I would only
like to correct a common verbal slip in one of
her quotations: She refers to traditional dis

trict-managed schools as "public schools,"
which carries the implication that charter
schools are not themselves public. But char
ter schools are every bit as public as district
schools: They are funded with public re
sources and are accountable to public over
sight.
Many educators (myself included)
have trouble breaking this linguistic bad

habit, but it is important that we do so. Until
we replace "public schools" with "district
schools" in our lexicon, charter advocates
will continue to be painted as opponents of
public education.

Sincerely,
H.WELLS WULSIN
