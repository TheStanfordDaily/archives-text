## CARD TAKES CLASSIC, IS SET FOR PAC-10 Stanford defeats New Mexico and Air Force 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's soccer is back in a big
way. Playing host to the Stanford Nike Classic
over the weekend, the Cardinal made a com
pelling case for national recognition.
The Cardinal (6-1-0) finished non-confer
ence play with a pair of victories over New
Mexico (5-3-0) and Air Force (3-1-3), giving it
the tournament title and stretching its current
win streak to six games. Stanford hasn't lost a
game since it opened the season on the road
with a loss to Lehigh.

The team started the weekend with an excit
ing 3-2 victory over Air Force. Air Force was
coming off a pair of consecutive wins, and
jumped out to an early lead when Steven
Noller beat Stanford keeper John Moore one
on-one. But the lead was short-lived. A mere
five minutes later, Bobby Warshaw converted a
penalty kick off the post for his first goal of the
game.

The rest of the first half belonged to Stan
ford, dominating Air Force with a 13-3 shots
on-goal edge. The team converted again in the
31st minute, when Daniel Leon won a free ball
in the midfield and took his dribble toward the
goal, laying it off for Adam Jahn, who buried his
first touch in the back of the net for his second
goal of the year.
Despite scoring two unanswered goals,
Stanford still looked hungry coming out of half
time, and it didn't take long to score again. In
the 51st minute, Warshaw tallied his third goal
of the season on a Michael Strickland free kick.
Strickland was looking for options when he
spotted a run and yelled, "Warshaw," sending a
beautiful post to the back post where a flat-out
flying Warshaw beat the keeper with a diving
header a shot that will no doubt stand as one
of the highlights of the season.
Air Force managed to pull within one when
Jared Gomez scored in the 63rd minute. The re
maining part of the game featured nerve-rack
ing chances at both ends, but neither team man
aged to score, giving the Cardinal a hard-fought
win.

The win gave Stanford the opportunity to
play a strong, confident New Mexico team for
the title match. New Mexico came into the
game 5-2-0 after having just posted a big 2-1
win over a then-N0.5 Cal team. This is the same
New Mexico team that was begging for a rank
ing after beating three ranked teams on the
road. But it was Stanford that came out of the
game deserving of a ranking with an impressive
2-0 win.
The Cardinal got on the board early when

Evan Morgan's cross-pass found Taylor
Amman's head in the 12th minute. It was both
Amman's first start and first goal of the season.
The rest of the game was a close affair, with
each team getting good chances. But Moore
stepped up in the net for Stanford and, with a
little help from the goalpost, posted his impres
sive fourth shutout in seven games. Together,
the Cardinal defense superb last year as well
allowed just six goals in seven games.
The game stayed close until the 89th minute,
when Amman and Cameron Lemming picked
up assists on Leon's second goal of the week
end, finally breaking through a New Mexico
backfield that had repeatedly been vulnerable
to the counter-attack. The goal was Stanford's
14th of the season, a significant milestone that
suggests that the Cardinal offense has regained
its potency. While last year Stanford only

scored 14 goals all season, in 18 games, the team
has hit that mark after only the seventh game.
Now, having made its case for a national
ranking, the team faces a huge hurdle in the
form of a very strong Cal team (5-2-0), as it pre
pares to start conference play Friday in Berke
ley. But one thing is for sure: Stanford looks to
be on the right path to finally make it back to
the NCAA tournament for the first time in too
many years. And if the Cardinal manages to
beat Cal and UCLA for the Pac-10 title, then
there would be no denying Stanford's return to
its rightful place as a national powerhouse.
Like head coach Brett Simon said after the
New Mexico game, "We have a long way to go,
but I think this has a chance to be a special
team."
