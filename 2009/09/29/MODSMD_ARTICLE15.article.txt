# HARBAUGH'S HEROES
## Card doing everything right, makes case for top-25 ranking 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There have been a number of big wins dur
ing the Jim Harbaugh era at Stanford, and last
Saturday's win over then-No. 24 Washington
certainly wasn't the biggest of them. Still, there
was something special about the 34-14 over
the Huskies it was the way the Cardinal
won.

Sure, Stanford was able to take down USC
in a historical upset two years ago, but that

took a 4th-and-15 conversion and a number of
fortunate plays. And yes, coach Harbaugh de
feated the Golden Bears in his first Big Game
in 2007, but that was against an ailing Cal team
that lost six of its last seven regular-season
games. Not to take away from those big wins,
but Saturday's win over the Huskies was re
markable in just how easy it came to a Stan
ford squad that is looking to finally turn the
corner in its third year under Harbaugh.
For the second week in a row, it only took
10 seconds for the Cardinal to get on the

board. Sophomore wide receiver Chris Owusu
showed why he'll probably be playing on Sun
days someday, knifing through the Washing
ton kick coverage and then outrunning all 11
purple jerseys. Redshirt freshman Andrew
Luck made a freshman mistake at quarter
back with his lateral-gone-wrong, but still re
covered to lead the Cardinal to victory; he
even ran for 59 yards to boot. And not much
more can be said about senior tailback Toby

The Stanford football program flexed its muscles Saturday night, toppling No. 24 Washington at home. Thanks in part to upset losses suffered by Cal and the USC Trojans, the Cardinal stands alone atop the Pac-10 and is earning consideration from many as a top-25 team.
Gerhart, who ran for two touch
downs, and 200 yards. Yes, exactly
200 yards.
It was a great team performance
on all fronts including the de
fense, who gave star quarterback
Jake Locker fits all day with its pass
rush but what was most remark
able about Saturday's win was that it
came as no surprise,
"We expected [to win]," coach
Harbaugh said. "We were the fa
vored team, we were playing at home
and we expected to do that. And we
wanted to do it decisively."
Even Owusu's mesmerizing kick
off return wasn't much of a surprise
to senior linebacker Clinton Snyder.
"We expect to start games like
that," Snyder said. "If we can execute
like we do on kickoff returns, that's
what's going to happen. If anything,
we were surprised they kicked it to
him."
Snyder wasn't exaggerating, ei
ther touchdown returns by
Owusu have become a thing of
routine these first few weeks, as
the sophomore speedster has al
ready tied the Pac-10 record for
kickoff returns for a touchdown in
a season.
Not only was Saturday's win deci
sive; it was physical. The Cardinal did
its best to beat up the Huskies on

both sides of the ball, whether it was
the defensive ends harassing Locker
or Gerhart running over Washington
defenders with his patented pinball
running style.
"Our guys didn't leave any doubt
out there tonight," Harbaugh said.
"It was physical. It was in the kind of
fashion we wanted it to be."
Take a look at the box score and
you'll see that Stanford dominated
pretty much every statistical catego
ry on Saturday against the previous
ly ranked Huskies. And when there
was still hope remaining for Wash
ington, they had no choice but to go
for it on fourth down twice. Both
times? Stopped.
All in all, it may have been the
first time Stanford has looked like a
legitimate top-25 team in a long
while. Even Harbaugh said so him
self.

"Yeah, I do," Harbaugh replied
when asked if he thought his team
should be ranked. "When I vote to
morrow, I'm going to vote Stanford
in the top 25."
The Cardinal clearly has a case to
present, but it'll be put to the test
against the UCLA Bruins this Satur
day, another team on the fringe of
cracking the top 25. If last Saturday's
performance was any indicator of
this weekend's performance, though,
Cardinal fans just might be treated to
the first ranked team they've had in
nearly a decade.
