# HARBAUGH'S HEROES
## Card doing everything right, makes case for top-25 ranking 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There have been a number of big wins dur
ing the Jim Harbaugh era at Stanford, and last
Saturday's win over then-No. 24 Washington
certainly wasn't the biggest of them. Still, there
was something special about the 34-14 over
the Huskies it was the way the Cardinal
won.

Sure, Stanford was able to take down USC
in a historical upset two years ago, but that

took a 4th-and-15 conversion and a number of
fortunate plays. And yes, coach Harbaugh de
feated the Golden Bears in his first Big Game
in 2007, but that was against an ailing Cal team
that lost six of its last seven regular-season
games. Not to take away from those big wins,
but Saturday's win over the Huskies was re
markable in just how easy it came to a Stan
ford squad that is looking to finally turn the
corner in its third year under Harbaugh.
For the second week in a row, it only took
10 seconds for the Cardinal to get on the

board. Sophomore wide receiver Chris Owusu
showed why he'll probably be playing on Sun
days someday, knifing through the Washing
ton kick coverage and then outrunning all 11
purple jerseys. Redshirt freshman Andrew
Luck made a freshman mistake at quarter
back with his lateral-gone-wrong, but still re
covered to lead the Cardinal to victory; he
even ran for 59 yards to boot. And not much
more can be said about senior tailback Toby

The Stanford football program flexed its muscles Saturday night, toppling No. 24 Washington at home. Thanks in part to upset losses suffered by Cal and the USC Trojans, the Cardinal stands alone atop the Pac-10 and is earning consideration from many as a top-25 team.
