# CROSS COUNTRY
## Running on all cylinders Men and women each win Stanford Invitational 
### JULIA BROWNELL ANARGHYA VARDANA STAFF WRITERS 
As he raised his arms on the straightaway
to the finish line, Chris Derrick rallied the
home crowd to cheer the top four Stanford
runners to the tape.
Derrick, Benjamin Johnson, Jacob Riley
and Brendan Gregg all crossed the line to
gether with a 23:54 8K performance. Along
with the fifth place 24:10 finish by teammate
Miles Unterreiner, the men swept the annu
al Stanford Invitational with a perfect 15
points. That mark was followed by Cal with
101 points and UC-Davis with 102.
Crossing the line together showed off the
team's collective strength and was optimisti
cally part of the original plan before the race.
"We had talked ... that's pretty much
what I wanted to see," said coach Jason
Dunn. "We wanted the main group to stay
together as long as possible ... On the run,
all four decided to cross together."
The perfect score was much appreciated
by fans and the team on its home course.
"I'm definitely pleased with the results,"
said Dunn.

Though impressive, the team seemed to
expect the result, as the competition in the
meet consisted largely of non-conference
and even lower division teams.

"I wouldn't say [the result was] a sur
prise," Gregg said. "We knew that if we came
out and ran the way we were supposed to, we
would win."
The finish should boost the
team's confidence going into a long
training block before conference
championships.
"[The meet] gives us confidence
going out against better competi
tion. If we race like we did on Satur
day, we'll for sure be able to race
versus anyone in the country," said
Gregg.
Throughout the race, the top
seven Stanford runners kept at the
front of the pack. Eventually, Elliot
Heath and JT Sullivan fell off the
pace of the front pack, but the top
six Stanford runners finished as
nearly uninterrupted leaders.
Coach Dunn thinks the group of
top finishers will definitely lead the
team, though he thinks Heath will
be up there as well.
"Elliot Heath had a little bit of an
off day," Dunn said. "[Saturday's
runners are] going to be our top
group for sure."
The team loved running on their
home turf, as home meets are unusu
al in the cross country schedule.
"It's always fun to have a home
crowd to run for," Gregg said. "This
is always a treat."
The women also won the meet
title, followed by Cal in second and
Loyola Marymount in third.
"We are extremely pleased with
the team result," said sophomore
Maddie Duhon. "Showing such
solid performances on our home
course got the whole team both
men and women-very excited about
what is to come this season. It's only
September, and good things are al
ready happening, so I can't wait to
see how things shake out come No
vember."
Leading the way for Stanford was
the fresh talent of freshman Kathy
Kroeger. Placing third in the 6,000
meters with a time of 20:35, Kroeger
had a strong performance in her first
collegiate race. Right behind Kroeger
was senior Kate Niehaus, who placed
fourth with a time of 20:39.
Other Cardinal women placing in
the top ten were freshman Alex
Dunne, who placed sixth with a time
of 20:44, junior Alex Gits who
placed seventh with a time of 20:50,
and sophomore Stephanie Marcy
who placed ninth with a time of

20:53.
Sophomore Georgia Griffin and
senior Madelaine O'Meara also had
strong finishes, placing 12th and
16th with times of 21:04 and 21:14,
respectively.
Next up for Stanford is the UC-
Davis Doc Adams Invitational on

Oct. 5, although most of the top ath
letes will be saved to run at the
NCAA Pre-Nationals on Oct. 17 in
Indiana.
