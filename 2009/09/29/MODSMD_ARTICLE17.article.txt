# National Football Lunacy?
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
I am completely confused by the
NFL this year. And no, it's not
because my fantasy football
team laid an egg the size of Chad
Ochocinco's ego. The NFL has been
turned completely upside down.
Now, let me just say that seemingly
every year, former NFL players who
translate mediocre playing careers
into mediocre broadcasting gigs talk
about how much parity is in the
league. Usually they say this because
there are three good teams instead of
two.

This year, though, parity has been
replaced by chaos. Case in point, the
Detroit Lions a high school team
paid millions to lose has more wins
this season than the Miami Dolphins,
who were in the playoffs last season.
The Cincinnati Bengals, who have had
more drag charges than wins every
year this decade, have as many wins as
the nationally beloved New England
Patriots, even with pretty-boy Tom
Brady playing every game.
Sure, there have been flukes. But
many times they have prevented even
more insanity rather than caused it.
The aforementioned Bengals would
be undefeated if not for a miraculous
tipped pass that ended up in Brandon
Stokley's hands for a Denver Broncos
win in Week One. Minnesota escaped
a few nights ago on a prayer in the
final seconds from everyone's favorite
flip-flopper Brett Favre. But that was
just to beat the 49ers at home.
So, who, you ask, is dominant so
far? Well, let's start with last year's
Super Bowl participants, the Steelers
and the Cardinals, and let's throw in
the team with the best record, the Ti
tans. Oh, wait. Those three are a com
bined 2-7 this year.That's right, the Jay
Cutler-less, Mike Shanahan-less,
seemingly hopeless Denver Broncos
have more wins than three of last
year's most successful teams com
bined. Joining Denver at 3-0 are the
New Orleans Saints and the New York
Jets, all three of whom were picked in
the bottom half of ESPN's preseason
power rankings, and all three of whom
missed the playoffs last year.
Less surprising 3-0 teams are the
New York Giants and the Indianapo
lis Colts, who have both been playoff
mainstays recently. But even they
have had their troubles, as both had to
rely on their quarterbacks, who hap
pen to be the Manning brothers, to
lead their respective teams to game
winning drives in the final minutes of
last week's games. Also undefeated
are Minnesota, albeit barely, and the
Baltimore Ravens, who have found an
offense in former Delaware Blue Hen
quarterback Joe Flacco and the often
injured Willis McGahee to score over
30 points in each of their first three
games.

Of the eight division leaders, only
the Vikings and the New York Foot
ball Giants won their divisions last
year.

Now, before you go off to Vegas
and wager your psych survey money
on a Broncos-Lions Super Bowl, re
member that it's only been three
weeks, and 13 more games will change
many things. Still, when the No. 1 pre
season team, the Steelers, and the No.
32 preseason team, the Lions, have the
same record, you know something
weird is happening.
All sense has not left football,
though. A1 Davis is still leading the
Raiders in their never-ending tailspin
of destruction, with their lone win
coming against the even more hope
less Kansas City Chiefs. The Browns
and Rams are still awful. Drew Brees
is still lighting everyone up, and Adri
an Peterson is continuing to dominate
the football-playing world in rushing.
As always, sports networks keep find
ing inarticulate former athletes to rave
about their former teams (add Tedy
Bruschi to the rapidly growing list)
while providing less insight than the
recordings of John Madden in his
video games.
But even the analysts with some
football knowledge have been baffled
this year. And unless your favorite
team is the Titans, the Steelers or some
other under-producing team, this is
great for football. Never in recent
memory has every game seemed as up
for grabs as it does this year.
Even the Lions vs. the Steelers.
