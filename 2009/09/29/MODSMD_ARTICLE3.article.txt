# Funds are hit hard, fall 27%
## At fiscal year end, endowment has dropped by $4.6 billion 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Management Company (SMC)
announced last week that the Stanford Merged Pool
(SMP), which includes most of the University's endow
ment and expendable funds, has experienced a 25.9 per
cent investment loss for the year ending June 30,2009.
Overall, the endowment's value, including gifts from
donors and $959 million in payouts for University opera
tions, fell 27 percent to approximately $12.6 billion in the
fiscal year ending Aug. 31.
The largest previous loss in Stanford endowment was a
decline of 6.2 percent in 1974.
"This was a year where almost everything struggled,"
said John Powers, president and CEO of SMC. "There
weren't many steady places. In a year where most asset
classes were down, for us, real estate and natural
resources were hit particularly hard."
ty reserves very carefully."

Investment Strategy
The drop in Stanford's endow
ment is comparable to that of
Harvard, whose endowment value
declined 30 percent, and Yale, whose
endowment value fell 29 percent.
The similar numbers are due to
all three schools' reliance on so
called alternative assets such as
commodities, real estate and private
equity, which outperformed market
indexes prior to 2007 but are less liq
uid than stocks and bonds. The
investment strategy was largely pio
neered by Yale's chief investment
officer, David Swensen. Stanford
still has roughly $6 to $7 billion
invested across all illiquid assets.
This strategy in the past has
helped endowments rack up double
digit gains at times, and generally
outperform various market indexes.
For example, over the past 10 years,
SMP received an annualized return
of 8.9 percent while the U.S. equity
market as measured by the S&P 500
Index declined an average 2.2 per
cent per year. The U.S. bond market
as measured by the Barclays
Aggregate Bond Index increased
6.0 percent per year.
However, this year the alterna
tive investment strategy meant dou
ble-digit losses. Meanwhile, endow
ments that invested in mostly stocks
and bonds did not lose as much
value.

Portfolio Allocation
Despite the losses, not all of
Stanford's investments are down.
"We had a number of strategies
that were up, but not in any broad
asset classes," Powers said. "Some
individual managers and strategies
within broader asset classes did
manage to generate some big
returns."
Most of the funds in SMP are
managed through external money
managers who are paid on a per
formance basis.

"We get reports from them regu
larly, and we talk to them regularly
as well, both via reports they send us
and our staying actively involved,"
Powers said. "With respect to com
pensation, very many of them are on
an incentive system where they only
make bonuses if they're up. When
we enter a contract with a fund man
ager, they will charge some fees but
don't have the ability to generate
big bonus pools unless they really
generate awesome returns."

For example, the University of
Pennsylvania's endowment is
expected to decline 15.7 percent,
MlT's by roughly 21 percent and
Columbia's by 16.1 percent.
Still, Powers believes the alterna
tive investment strategy is viable.
"We do believe that the fundamen
tal principle of using alternative
investments to increase diversifica
tion and returns makes sense," he
said.

Powers also stressed that while it
is important to manage the risk in
the endowment portfolio carefully,
it is also important not to overreact
by becoming too risk-averse.
"In the past year, if you look at
how much the market's moved, the
equity markets had a once-in-80-
years kind of move," Powers said.
"It'll be just as dangerous to overre
act to a once-in-80-years move on a
five-, 10- or 20-year basis."
Current projections from top
administrators indicate more meas
ured expectations for growth than
the years prior to the endowment's
steep decline. University President
John Hennessy said earlier in the
year at the annual meeting of the
Academic Council that assuming a
three percent inflation rate, an eight
percent annual return for the next
five years and 10 percent after that,
it may take more than 30 years for
the University endowment to reach
its peak levels of $17.2 billion.
"Certainly, we would hope to do
better than that timeframe," Powers
said. "The markets have rallied here,
but the economy's still under a
severe amount of stress."

"We just have to be careful that
whatever we implement doesn't put
us in a situation where we're uncom
fortable with the level of liquidity in
the portfolio," he added. "You have
to be really clear and have sufficient
reserves of liquidity to meet the
needs of the University and the
potential claims against the Merged
Pool. You need to plan your liquidi-

For now, the University will be
assuming that it will take a long time
to recover the endowment losses,
but they will be "working [their]
best to expedite that," Powers said.

Liquidity
A Wall Street Journal blog
reported last Friday that SMC has
tapped Cogent Partners, a private
equity-focused investment bank, to
gauge investor interest for a possi
ble secondary sale of its alternative
investment portfolio.
However, Stanford has not con
firmed this secondary sale and
stressed that it is, for the moment,
adequately buffered in liquidity.
"The University remains confi
dent in its ability to meet the liquid
ity needs of the payout and in man
aging the endowment," Powers said.

In April, Stanford issued $1 bil
lion in taxable debt, which created
liquidity in Stanford's portfolio.
However, according to Randy
Livingston, Stanford's vice president
for business affairs and chief finan
cial officer, of the $1 billion that
Stanford issued in debt last spring,
$2OO million was used to refinance
previously existing debt and $BOO
million was placed in money market
funds as a liquidity reserve.

Payouts
The University normally uses a
smoothing formula whereby
endowment returns and losses are
spread over a long-term timeframe
so that payouts can remain rela
tively stable, "However, following
the extraordinary investment
downturn last year, the University
elected to suspend the smoothing
formula for two years," Livingston
said.

"So far, we have not had to draw
on the liquidity reserve, nor do we
expect to in the near future," Powers
said.

Instead, Stanford will accelerate
the payout reductions and budget
cuts in order to "get the pains
behind us and begin the recovery

process," Livingston said. Payouts
on individual endowment funds
will decrease by 10 percent this fis
cal year and a planned 15 percent
next fiscal year.
"Had we continued using the
smoothing formula, we would have
expected five to six years of reduc
tions in endowment payouts and
budget cuts," Livingston said.
In fiscal year 2009, investment
income from the endowment
accounted for 29 percent of the
University's budget; for Yale and
Harvard, the numbers were 42 per
cent and 33 percent, respectively.
Nonetheless, with decreased pay
out from individual funds, the per
centage of operating budget sup
ported by endowment will also
reduce.

"Endowment income is project
ed to represent only 22 percent of
consolidated University revenue
during the current fiscal year,"
Livingston said.

To accommodate accelerated
payout reductions, the University
has, for the most part, already com
pleted necessary budget cuts by
imposing a University-wide salary
freeze, laying off over 400 staff
members, postponing $l.l billion
of capital projects and consolidat
ing programs, among other reduc
tions.

So far, the biggest concern is a
financial aid shortfall, as the
University has not made any
reductions in student financial aid
despite the fact endowment payout
supporting financial aid is decreas
ing as well.

"The financial aid shortfall
remains a significant challenge,"
Livingston said. "A major focus of
the remaining two years of the
Stanford Challenge [fundraising
campaign] will be to raise more
endowment gifts for undergradu
ate financial aid."

And good news? No further
staff layoffs are expected.
"Overall, we expect headcount
to stay roughly flat," Livingston
said. "We'll likely see some hiring
of staff to support research grants
that are growing as a result of the
federal stimulus package, offset by
modest staff reductions in other
areas as units fully adjust to
reduced budget levels."
