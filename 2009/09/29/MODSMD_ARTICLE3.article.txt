# Funds are hit hard, fall 27%
## At fiscal year end, endowment has dropped by $4.6 billion 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Management Company (SMC)
announced last week that the Stanford Merged Pool
(SMP), which includes most of the University's endow
ment and expendable funds, has experienced a 25.9 per
cent investment loss for the year ending June 30,2009.
Overall, the endowment's value, including gifts from
donors and $959 million in payouts for University opera
tions, fell 27 percent to approximately $12.6 billion in the
fiscal year ending Aug. 31.
The largest previous loss in Stanford endowment was a
decline of 6.2 percent in 1974.
"This was a year where almost everything struggled,"
said John Powers, president and CEO of SMC. "There
weren't many steady places. In a year where most asset
classes were down, for us, real estate and natural
resources were hit particularly hard."
