## A
						DAY IN THE LIFE OF A PIZZA 
### JESS WERTHEIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the eighth day, God
created pizza, and it
was perfect flat,
covered with cheese

without cutlery.

degrees of temperature. And, best
of all, it tends to have a rather lax
final date of consumption.

on campus for Stanford students

to get their pizza fix: Treehouse.
The campus eatery offers a variety
of different kinds of pizza at rela

between two to three dollars. The
square shaped slices come four
inches by four inches, which, all
things considered, is a pretty hefty
meal. But while size does matter,
taste is the ultimate concern.

drudgery of three classes from 9
'til 12, and the only thing that
keeps me going is the thought of

Treehouse sees high traffic during lunchtime, when students come
flocking for square slices of fresh pizza. The pizzas are made every morning using local ingredients.
