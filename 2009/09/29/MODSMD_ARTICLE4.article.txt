## A 						DAY IN THE LIFE OF A PIZZA 
### JESS WERTHEIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the eighth day, God
created pizza, and it
was perfect flat,
covered with cheese
and able to be eaten
without cutlery.
It's versatile, can be eaten any
where, at any time and at varying
degrees of temperature. And, best
of all, it tends to have a rather lax
final date of consumption.
There is really only one place
on campus for Stanford students

to get their pizza fix: Treehouse.
The campus eatery offers a variety
of different kinds of pizza at rela
tively reasonable prices
between two to three dollars. The
square shaped slices come four
inches by four inches, which, all
things considered, is a pretty hefty
meal. But while size does matter,
taste is the ultimate concern.
"Every Monday, I endure the
drudgery of three classes from 9
'til 12, and the only thing that
keeps me going is the thought of

Treehouse sees high traffic during lunchtime, when students come
flocking for square slices of fresh pizza. The pizzas are made every morning using local ingredients.
the
munchy,
chewy, cheesy,
warm breadiness of the
delicious pizza of Treehouse," said
Vivek Athalye 'll. "That's the high
light of my day."
Sterling Camden 'O9 felt the
same way. "It's like the cheese is a
little piece of the divine,"
he said. He notes that
his favorite kind has
both pepperoni and
sausage
because what man
doesn't appreciate
multiple types of
meat?
Yes, Treehouse is
known for its fresh and
delicious food, but while
those who consume the food gener
ally appreciate it, few realize the
planning and procedure that go
into making a perfect Treehouse
pizza.
Each morning starts with the
making of the pizza
dough fresh
foccacia bread,
all made by
hand and
then tossed
into a 500
degree gas
oven for ten
minutes. The
dough is never
frozen, but if there
are leftovers from the morning, they
are placed on a baking sheet, cov
ered with plastic wrap and refrig
erated for later in the day.
Saul Alvarez
manages

Treehouse
and orders the
ingredients for the various
pizzas. "All of our ingredi
ents are homemade
and fresh," he said.
"We order the
vegetables locally
from Daylight
Produce in San Jose.
We have been with the
company for more than
five years."
The only items Treehouse
does not buy locally are pineap
ples and black olives. Those they
receive in cans.
Once Treehouse receives its
daily ingredients, the sauce is made
from scratch. Mid-morning, the red
deliciousness is spread over the foc
cacia bread and layered
with chopped vegetables
and cheese. Near noon,
the pizza's hot, fresh
and ready for hungry
students and staff.
"Treehouse is
busiest at lunch
there is a line out the
door every day," said
Elizabeth Aguilar, an
employee. "But what
can I say? We
have

Pgood
toppings
pepperoni, fresh veg
etables and barbeque
chicken."
And at the end of the day, when
stomachs are full and cheese has
gone cold, Treehouse conserves.
This campus may be considered
rather environmentally
conscious, and, in keep
ing with tradition,
Treehouse is quite eco
nomical.
"We keep an eye
on the amount of
pizza that is still
left on the
trays during
lunch and dinner
so that we do not
overcook,"
Alvarez

said.
"There is no
'usual' amount of
pizza that is consumed in a
day, but we are aware of the amount
of pizza that the students are
eating. We don't want to
make more waste, and
are trying to provide
only the food that is
needed."
As for Alvarez's
favorite pizza?
"Hawaiian," he
said with a

smile.
"The pineap
ple is great."
