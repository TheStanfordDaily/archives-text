## East Palo Alto police buy back firearms 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
Thirty-three people handed over guns and
took home money and San Jose Sharks tickets
Saturday at a gun buyback program organized by
East Palo Alto police.
Officers said residents dropped off 49 guns
Saturday to the tune of $2,450 in gift checks from
the City of East Palo Alto, 96 hockey tickets and
48 Hewlett-Packard gift certificates.

Police said the city's goal for the University
Avenue event was to get "unwanted" firearms off
the streets of East Palo Alto. "In the last quarter
of each year, we have a spike in violent crimes,"
said Sergeant Jeff Liu. "We're trying to, in this
component, take guns off the street and make
guns less readily available for people to do harm."
Liu was referring to Operation Fourth
Quarter, the department's attempt to combat the
spike it sees in violent crimes during the last three
months of the year. The reason for that spike is

unclear, Liu said.
"If we could put our finger on one event or
one group of people, we'd be able to stamp it out
pretty quick," Liu said.
"It's not like a back-and-forth gun battle
between two groups of people," he added. "They
range from personal disputes to arguments to
conflicts of those nature."
The array of firearms turned in
Saturday included small-caliber
handguns, shotguns and rifles, new
and old. Police said they did not ask
for residents' names or check
whether the guns were legal, and
they plan to melt down the firearms
to destroy them.
Vice Mayor David Woods told
the San Jose Mercury News last
week that the event was inspired by
the shooting of 2-year-old Andrew
Grewe in January. A 12-year-old
cousin accidentally shot Grewe with
a rifle in the garage in East Palo
Alto where they were playing.
Grewe was staying in the area
with his mother while undergoing

medical treatment at Stanford
Medical Center, according to rela
tives.

Sergio Sanchez, 34, of East Palo
Alto owned the rifle and turned
himself in the day after Grewe was
killed. He was charged with two
felonies: possession of a firearm and
leaving a loaded weapon where chil
dren could access it, resulting in
death.

In June, Sanchez was sentenced
to 16 months in prison on the
weapon storage charge. San Mateo
County prosecutors dropped the
possession charge.
Sgt. Liu said Saturday's gun buy
back was the first here in at least
nine years and called the donated
tickets and gift certificates "very
gracious."
