## East Palo Alto police buy back firearms 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
Thirty-three people handed over guns and
took home money and San Jose Sharks tickets
Saturday at a gun buyback program organized by
East Palo Alto police.
Officers said residents dropped off 49 guns
Saturday to the tune of $2,450 in gift checks from
the City of East Palo Alto, 96 hockey tickets and
48 Hewlett-Packard gift certificates.

Police said the city's goal for the University
Avenue event was to get "unwanted" firearms off
the streets of East Palo Alto. "In the last quarter
of each year, we have a spike in violent crimes,"
said Sergeant Jeff Liu. "We're trying to, in this
component, take guns off the street and make
guns less readily available for people to do harm."
Liu was referring to Operation Fourth
Quarter, the department's attempt to combat the
spike it sees in violent crimes during the last three
months of the year. The reason for that spike is

unclear, Liu said.
"If we could put our finger on one event or
one group of people, we'd be able to stamp it out
pretty quick," Liu said.
"It's not like a back-and-forth gun battle
between two groups of people," he added. "They
range from personal disputes to arguments to
conflicts of those nature."
