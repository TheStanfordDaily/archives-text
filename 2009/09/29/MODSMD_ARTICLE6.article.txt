## CardPlan turns IDs into credit cards Students prefer plan to Cardinal Dollar system 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students are now able
to use their ID cards as credit cards
at various locations on campus. The
StanfordCardPlan, implemented
this academic year, allows them to
charge up to $l,OOO on their
accounts, paid for in their universi
ty bill at the end of each quarter.
Intended in part for students
with financial needs, the new
Card Plan allows students regis
tered with the program through
Axess to purchase textbooks and
other educational-related items.
This credit system hopes to relieve
stress for students who have not yet
received all of their financial aid
packages.
The program is also available to
any student who agrees to the
Card Plan's terms of use on Axess,
and allows participants to swipe

cards at most campus eateries, pho
tocopiers and printers, in addition
to the Bookstore. The Student
Services Center hopes this change
will increase usage of the student
ID, which was relatively low with
the previous debit-focused plan.
"I like it because I bought text
books at the bookstore and I didn't
have to put it on my credit card
it just goes on the bill at the end of
the year," said Linden Moot 'l2. "It
made logistic things easier between
me and my parents.
"My dad loved it because I don't
have to keep track of my receipts
and stuff and be asking for money
for books all the time," Moot
added.
The new plan, implemented
Sept. 1, eliminates most of the pre
vious debit functions that were
originally in place for student IDs.
Many students are reacting posi
tively to this change.
"Cardinal Dollars are kind of
annoying because you have to put
in a set amount of money before

In a new StanfordCardPlan implemented Sept. 1, student IDs can now serve
as credit cards with a $1,000 limit, replacing the former Cardinal Dollar
plan. Students must agree to terms of use on Axess to join the program.
hand, and if you spend more
money than what you thought,
you're left wondering, 'Now what
do I do?'" Moot said.

"I also like that I no longer have
to send my parents a separate bill
for everything," added Kallie
Friedman 'l2. "I liked the conven
ience of how easy it was to sign up
for it as well; it's just a quick online
form."
According to the
StanfordCardPlan information
Web site, students are expected to
"manage the funds provided," and
therefore cannot deposit addition
al money onto ID cards.
"For instance, we recommend
that students maintain a small
available balance on their
StanfordCardPlan until the end of
the quarter, so that incidental
expenses such as copies can be
covered," as explained on the
financial activities Web site.

Students who had previously
deposited money into the old
Card Plan will receive a credit by
the end of the month. Any student
who enrolls in the Card Plan must
wait 24 hours for it to become
effective, but students can sign up
at any point during the quarter.
"It's like starting your own
credit card with Stanford it's
nice that it doesn't act like a debit
card," Friedman said. "The meal
plan dollars you can't really use
anywhere, but this is great because
you can use it everywhere."
Friedman praised the program
because "it means that you don't
have to carry cash." Although this
is a benefit to some, she raised con
cerns about the consequences of
losing an ID card.
"If you lose your card and don't
carry cash around, then you're out
of luck," Friedman said.

Other students discussed the
consequences and potential dan
gers of the available credit.
"Extending $l,OOO unsecured
credit to Stanford students is prob
ably not the best idea," added
Cameron Mullen 'll.
Leslie Johnson 'l2 referred to
the new credit program as a "very
dangerous system."
"More often than not, parents
aren't able to approve this spend
ing and are sometimes paying for
it," she said.
Currently, the Stanford Card
Plan applies to the Bookstore,
printing and copying, as well as
popular eateries including
Treehouse and the CoHo, where
Cardinal Dollars included with stu
dent meal plans are not applicable.
