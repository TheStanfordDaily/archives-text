## CardPlan turns IDs into credit cards Students prefer plan to Cardinal Dollar system 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students are now able
to use their ID cards as credit cards
at various locations on campus. The
StanfordCardPlan, implemented
this academic year, allows them to
charge up to $l,OOO on their
accounts, paid for in their universi
ty bill at the end of each quarter.
Intended in part for students
with financial needs, the new
Card Plan allows students regis
tered with the program through
Axess to purchase textbooks and
other educational-related items.
This credit system hopes to relieve
stress for students who have not yet
received all of their financial aid
packages.
The program is also available to
any student who agrees to the
Card Plan's terms of use on Axess,
and allows participants to swipe

cards at most campus eateries, pho
tocopiers and printers, in addition
to the Bookstore. The Student
Services Center hopes this change
will increase usage of the student
ID, which was relatively low with
the previous debit-focused plan.
"I like it because I bought text
books at the bookstore and I didn't
have to put it on my credit card
it just goes on the bill at the end of
the year," said Linden Moot 'l2. "It
made logistic things easier between
me and my parents.
"My dad loved it because I don't
have to keep track of my receipts
and stuff and be asking for money
for books all the time," Moot
added.
The new plan, implemented
Sept. 1, eliminates most of the pre
vious debit functions that were
originally in place for student IDs.
Many students are reacting posi
tively to this change.
"Cardinal Dollars are kind of
annoying because you have to put
in a set amount of money before

In a new StanfordCardPlan implemented Sept. 1, student IDs can now serve
as credit cards with a $1,000 limit, replacing the former Cardinal Dollar
plan. Students must agree to terms of use on Axess to join the program.
