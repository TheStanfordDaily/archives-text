# SHAPING THE FUTURE
## Students help youth through spiritual empowerment program 
### VINEET SINGAL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford has been described
in the past as a bubble,
implying that students often
live in isolation from the
rest of the world because
the campus is a self-sufficient bea
con of ideal college life.
However, a look at Stanford's
own student-run Junior Youth
Spiritual Empowerment Program
(JYSEP) goes a little ways toward
discrediting that stereotype.
Started as a program to encour
age and assist junior youth to take
ownership for their spiritual and

intellectual development, JYSEP
encourages young adults (aged
between 10 and 15 years) in
Stanford's neighboring schools to
"develop a strong sense of purpose
and the volition needed to make
good decisions and to engage in
meaningful social action in their
communities," according to the pro
gram's Facebook group.
The program is organized around
the idea of a junior youth group a
peer group of about a dozen teens
that meets together regularly and
is based on the principle of group
learning. The program has members
from Stanford's undergraduate
community, as well as support from

schools in the Palo Alto area.
According to Jasmine Nachtigall
'l2, the program's mission statement
is simply to help junior youth har
ness their spiritual and intellectual
development and use it to drive
decisions.
"We have a group of student
leaders at Stanford go to different
middle schools and be animators
facilitators of different moral para
bles that help allow students to
develop a sense of expressing them
selves," Nachtigall explained.
However, the program does not
aim to dictate. Group advisor Vahid
Motazedian specifically says the
program aims to educate the stu

dents to "learn how to think, but not
what to think."
"One of the components [of the
program] is the study component,
where [the student leaders] read
materials that enhance not only
powers of expression, but also help
[the youth] learn how to make deci
sions," Motazedian said.
The program has several other
components, including planning and
carrying out service projects, and
subsequently evaluating their effec
tiveness. Another component is
engaging in artistic activities as a
mode of expression for the youth's
readings under the program. The
fourth and final component of the
program is participating in recre
ational activities.
The agency uses age-specific
materials. This not only helps the
students in basic reading and writing
skills, but also aides them in devel
oping basic moral values embedded
inside of a story.
"We use materials that have been
produced by Development

Learning Press, which is a nonprofit
agency that collaborates with educa
tional organizations worldwide, such
as the Ruhi Institute in Colombia,
the Badi Foundation in Macao, the
William Mmutle Masetlha
Foundation in Zambia," Motazedian
explained.
For example, one of the books
used by the group, Breezes of
Confirmation, is an account of the
daily lives of a group of junior youth
in Bumi, a village in Zimbabwe,
According to the William
Mmutle Masetlha Foundation,
which published Breezes of
Confirmation, the book "strives to
create within the youth the moral
structures that will underlie their
decisions and guide their actions as
they mature into young adults and
active members of society."
One of the characters in the story
is a young boy who is trying to save
money so he can go back to school.
Throughout the course of the story,
he learns about the concept of eco
nomics and how to create money.

"For instance, some advice he is
given by the father of one of his
friends is to look at an economic sys
tem and find out where there's a
need that is not being met, and then
to provide that need," Motazedian
described.
These readings naturally devolve
into lengthy discussions where the
text is broken down and analyzed to
reveal truths about the human con
dition.
"Everyone gets together for
about two hours or so and talks
about how the texts relate to our
lives," Nachtigall added.
And while the group's purpose is
very noble and uncontroversial,
Nachtigall explained that there are
still some obstacles to reaching out
to students.
"The word 'spiritual' in the name
of our group can sometimes bring a
little bit of stigma, especially in pub
lic schools," she said. "So, we really
want to make clear that we are not
here to impose any kind of moral
system. Instead, we'd like these
youth to learn to explore their
own."

Although the group advocates
values embodied by the Baha'i
Faith, a monotheistic religion
emphasizing the spiritual unity of all
humankind, group member Dong
Nghi 'l2 emphasized they are not
there to "push an agenda on faith."
"We are out there to help these
kids explore their own values and
understand the importance of hon
esty, spirituality and truth and how
they play a role in public service,"
Nghi said.

Since the program typically
begins at around age 12 and ends at
around age 14, continuity is impor
tant.

"Another challenge is to set up a
system of human resources that we
can sustain for three years,"
Motazedian said.

Also members of the program,
Kevin Hardekopf 'l2 and Jenna
Nicholas 'l2 have both described
positive experiences since they've
joined.
"It's a really hands-on approach
to teaching," Hardekopf said. "I
look forward to working with jun
ior youth to inspire them to take
social change into their own hands."
Nicholas, who has experience
with similar projects in both the
Congo and London, noted the
bonding experience among group
members. "The empowerment is
not just about the junior youth but
also about us," she said. "We have
grown together as a group, just as
we hope the junior youth will also
do."
