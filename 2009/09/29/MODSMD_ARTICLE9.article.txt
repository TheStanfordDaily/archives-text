## EDITORIAL Financial aid must become sustainable 
### 
Sustainability, year in and year out, is a
Stanford buzzword. From the dining
halls to the ASSU elections, the idea
of sustainability underscores the ideal of
Stanford as a self-contained environment
that is able to flourish steadily from year to
year. Yet, one major aspect of Stanford
policy seems to be lacking any coherent
formula for sustainability: student finan
cial aid.

Last March, it was announced that, in
light of the economy and struggling en
dowment, financial aid spending would be
increased in order to meet the demands of
new students and the University's gener
ous aid policies. Now, just this last week,
Provost John Etchemendy detailed the ap
proximately $4O million dollar deficit that
the financial aid program has accumulated
as a result of overstretching its resources.
It would seem that, with regard to long
term strategy, the financial aid program at
Stanford is lacking the means by which it
can immediately sustain both progressive
student aid packages and increasing num
bers of students.
Financial aid remains one of the most
important aspects of the University budget
in terms of its impact on students' liveli
hood; without major financial support in
the form of scholarships, student loans and
work study, many students would be un
able to attend Stanford, and a great many
would choose one of its peer schools in
stead. The University appears completely
aware of this fact, as for years the primary
motivation for Stanford's annual increases
in financial aid offerings seemed to be top
ping or keeping up with similar policies at
Harvard, Yale and other schools. Yet, these
measures were made in much better eco
nomic times, and now, in the midst of the re
cession, Stanford's aid policy of keeping up
with the Joneses or, in this case, the Har
vards and Yales has put its aid policy in
the red. Facing a shrinking endowment and
deficit aid spending, the administration
needs to focus on making financial aid sus
tainable from one year to another while en
suring that students who need scholarship
support are not left behind.
Underscoring the issue of the financial

aid deficit is the issue of where the Univer
sity, faced with a shrinking endowment,
continues to dedicate resources. The re
cent renovation of Branner a multi-mil
lion dollar project seems almost comi
cal when one considers that the University
chose to revamp the walls of the residence
hall while the students dwelling inside the
walls may face financial aid cuts in the fu
ture. Throughout the campus, similar con
struction and renovation projects are still
underway, regardless of their drain on re
sources that could go to other programs. To
be fair, much of the construction going on
across campus was either begun or sched
uled before the financial crisis. But the
continuation of long-term projects such as
renovations, combined with the pressures
of a deficit and contracting endowment,
does not send the right message to stu
dents. To say that financial aid could face
cuts in the near future while millions are
being spent on aesthetic luxuries is a slap
in the face to those who rely on aid to at
tend Stanford.

One of the problems of the financial sit
uation at Stanford may be that fiscal trans
parency is still minimal. Even with the
budget cuts to the OSA last spring, the
University declines to publish line-by-line
details of the budget. Students trust the
University in its management and admin
istration, but when it comes to understand
ing the budgetary process, students are
mostly left guessing. So, when one asks
where this deficit resides, where cuts can
be made and what can be done, they may
find it hard to discover the real answers.
Thus, we are left with two problems when
it comes to financial management at Stan
ford: one of sustainability and another of
accountability.
The financial aid problem at Stanford
was sparked by economic conditions, but
the absence of a long-term strategy for al
lowing scholarships to be sustained
even in a bad economy has worsened
the situation. More important than sus
taining a reputation or aesthetic image of
Stanford is upholding the University's
commitment to those who require finan
cial assistance to attend.
