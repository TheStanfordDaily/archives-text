## Party planners react to new SAL guidelines 
### TROY YANG 
Many students are reacting with
measured optimism to the new party
rules rolled out by campus adminis-
trators, saying the guidelines are a
step in the right direction.
The 2009-10 Party Planning
Guide, which was approved by
the new Student Activities and
Leadership (SAL) office in
August, revised and clarified man
aspects of the party planning proc

Dean Schaffer 'lO, community
manager at La Maison Francaise, said
the new guidelines allow for more
flexibility and shorter advance notice
for parties. "They definitely provide a
level which is more realistic than
what's been there before for people
who plan smaller events," he said. "It
brings the guidelines a little more in
line with reality."
SAL Associate Director Snehal
Naik said students have commented
that the guidelines are more clear and
accessible than before. "I've had a lot
of feedback, and it's all been very posi
tive," he said.
For some of those responsible for
planning bigger parties, there seem to
be few major changes to the
University's policies.
"I didn't notice that many differ
ences between this year and last year's
guidelines," said Taylor Durand 'lO,
community manager for 680 Lomita
and planner of Exotic Erotic, one of
the year's biggest parties. But, she
added, "from what I can see, the new
party planning levels are helpful rather
than hurtful."
While there is consensus among
some students and staff that the new
rules are an improvement, others
believe there could still be some more
enhancement, especially when it comes
to the issue of providing and paying
for security.
"It's somewhat unfair for the
University to say that you have to pro
vide all this security and spend all this
money and we're not going to help you
come up with the funds," Schaffer said.
Will Harte 'lO, president of Kappa
Sigma, echoed the sentiment.

"It's an
J interesting mix of
us having to assume liability, us hav
ing to pay for everything and us trying
to make everything as safe as possible,"
Harte said. "I would personally like to
see more financial support from the
University."
The fact that parties must be
reported several days to several
weeks in advance, depending upon
the category and size of the party, is
another issue for many student party
planners, who claim students are busy
and could do without the extra hassle
of many regulations.
"We're providing a service that
makes our campus more lively," Harte
commented.

Naik is aware of the complaint. "I
understand that people want less time
to plan parties," he said, "but I still
think that planning time is essential.
These guidelines are there to help stu
dents plan out parties, not to deter
them from planning parties."

"I would love for students to contin
ue to give us feedback," he added.
Durand said she thought SAL's
efforts were for the overall benefit of
students. "In my experience, [SAL] are
here to help us and keep us safe. On
the one hand, clearing things with them
can be a bit of a hassle, but I think over
all they're doing the job for a reason
and... they're doing it well."
