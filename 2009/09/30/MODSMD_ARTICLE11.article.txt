## SIXTH MAN Basketball fan club is right to compromise, cut price 
### Lazarus 
t is not often that I agree with one of the
Stanford Athletic Department's deci
sions, but I have to tip my hat to its most
recent one. The cost of Sixth Man regis
tration has decreased from $65 last year to
$35 before Nov. 15, and $50 afterward. Mem
bers who earn at least 11 points, which can be
received by attending only 10 games, will
qualify for a $20 rebate. Season tickets to a
Pac-10 basketball program for $15 are defi-

nitely a bargain. What pleasantly shocks me
about the lowered prices is the accurate tim
ing from the athletic department, never
known for its efficiency or its attentiveness to
public perception.
This season figures to be a low point for
Cardinal basketball. Senior Landry Fields is

the only returning starter and the only
proven scorer on the roster. Junior Josh
Owens showed flashes of dominance in the
paint last year, but it would be a stretch to ex
pect him to carry the Cardinal. Sophomores
Jeremy Green and Jarrett Mann are still
probably another year or two away from de
veloping into all-around players.
With Red Zone membership for football
free, basketball remains the only sport for

which students have to pay. Last season, only
550 students, the lowest in recent memory,
joined the Sixth Man to watch Stanford fin
ish a respectable 20-14 overall, but only 6-13
in conference play. With the trio of Mitch
Johnson, Anthony Goods and Lawrence Hill
lost to graduation, expect the number of wins
to drop, possibly drastically.
