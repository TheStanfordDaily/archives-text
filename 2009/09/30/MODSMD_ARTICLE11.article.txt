## SIXTH MAN Basketball fan club is right to compromise, cut price 
### Lazarus 
t is not often that I agree with one of the
Stanford Athletic Department's deci
sions, but I have to tip my hat to its most
recent one. The cost of Sixth Man regis
tration has decreased from $65 last year to
$35 before Nov. 15, and $50 afterward. Mem
bers who earn at least 11 points, which can be
received by attending only 10 games, will
qualify for a $20 rebate. Season tickets to a
Pac-10 basketball program for $15 are defi-

nitely a bargain. What pleasantly shocks me
about the lowered prices is the accurate tim
ing from the athletic department, never
known for its efficiency or its attentiveness to
public perception.
This season figures to be a low point for
Cardinal basketball. Senior Landry Fields is

the only returning starter and the only
proven scorer on the roster. Junior Josh
Owens showed flashes of dominance in the
paint last year, but it would be a stretch to ex
pect him to carry the Cardinal. Sophomores
Jeremy Green and Jarrett Mann are still
probably another year or two away from de
veloping into all-around players.
With Red Zone membership for football
free, basketball remains the only sport for

which students have to pay. Last season, only
550 students, the lowest in recent memory,
joined the Sixth Man to watch Stanford fin
ish a respectable 20-14 overall, but only 6-13
in conference play. With the trio of Mitch
Johnson, Anthony Goods and Lawrence Hill
lost to graduation, expect the number of wins
to drop, possibly drastically.

If the price remained at $65, how
many students would join? Three
hundred? Two hundred? No amount
of free pizza, T-shirts, foam fingers or
Kanye glasses could fill the student
section. Potential recruits would see
an empty Maples Pavilion and would
reconsider whether Stanford is the
place they want to play in their colle
giate years.
The new pricing scheme has a
chance to work. With Stanford foot
ball's success this season, student
support for Cardinal athletics is high
and the athletic department is capi
talizing on the excitement. The aver
age student probably does not know
the expectations for basketball this
year and will translate football's hot
start into a good season for basket
ball.
If Stanford basketball surprises

the critics and has a good season,
then the student section will be filled
and everybody will be happy. If bas
ketball lives up to its expectations
and finishes in the bottom half of the
Pac-10, then the promise of a $2O re
bate will hopefully keep enough stu
dents interested in attending games.
Stanford basketball is in a unique
position. On one hand, Maples Pavil
ion provides one of the most inti
mate experiences in all of college
sports. On the other, basketball is the
only sport that requires a monetary
commitment from students. Ideally,
as the basketball program goes
through its rebuilding phase, Sixth
Man would go the way of the Red
Zone and drop any registration fees.
Still, the University is feeling the
pinch of the recession, and budget
cuts are ravaging every department,
including athletics. Jobs and coaches
in the athletic department have re
ceived the axe, and not in the way
football wants to. It would be unlike
ly, even unfair, for the athletic de
partment to pass up on the money

Sixth Man generates, no matter how
small. The athletic department has a
commitment to its players and fans.
The basketball team deserves to
have the support of the student
body; the students deserve to be able
to attend games without feeling pain
in the pocketbook. The new Sixth
Man deal is a compromise.
Some will argue paying to watch
UCLA basketball blow out the Car
dinal while freely walking into the
Avery Aquatic Center to watch the
No. 1 Stanford men's water polo
team compete is ludicrous. Others
will argue that if students are willing
to pay for basketball, the University
has a financial responsibility to sup
port its other programs by charging
admission for basketball. I just hope
that the day will come soon when I
can write that season tickets for $l5
is far too low for a nationally ranked
basketball program.
