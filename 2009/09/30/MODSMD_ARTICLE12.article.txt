# Rankings only add to confusion

Parity is running amok in col
lege football, and it's just
claimed its first off-field ca
sualty: the Associated Press
(AP) and USA Today Top 25 polls.
With top-10 teams dropping each
weekend four in the last week
alone it has become increasingly
clear that few teams deserve such
elite status, but with no "N/A" option
available, coaches (USA Today) and
journalists (AP) alike have put to
gether an assortment of teams that is
simply befuddling.
There are a few problems at work.
The first is the shuffling of teams in
the top 10 and the leaps some schools
have made despite doing practically
everything in their power to not
move up. Then there are the peculiar
rankings of squads that have played
each other lowa beat Penn State
last weekend, so naturally, as is the
case in the coaches poll, the Nittany
Lions are higher than the Hawkeyes.
Add in the inherent bias toward past
history and preseason rankings, and
you get a rankings system that is be
yond muddled.
Let's first look at some schools

that made it back into the top 10
when they most certainly did not de
serve it. Take our dear friends, the
Trojans of Southern California, for
instance, USC put together an ane
mic performance against Washington
State, the clear-cut worst team in the
conference and one of the most woe
ful BCS squads overall. The Cougars
had the unfortunate task of taking on
the Trojans in the Coliseum just a
week after Washington shockingly
upset the Pac-10's preeminent pro
gram. This had all of the makings of
your average beat-your-lesser-oppo
nent-into-submission-97-times-to-
get-back-on-track game, and yet
WSU held their own much better
than anyone anticipated. The 27-6
final was a far cry from last year's 69-
0 beat down.

What did USC get for a poor out
ing against arguably their easiest op
ponent of the year? Why, a move
from N0.12 to N0.7 in the AP, and a
move from 10 to 7 in the coaches', of
course!

LSU needed a fairly miraculous
goal line stand to hold off Mississippi
State, the Washington State of the
SEC West. How were they rewarded?
By jumping from 7 to 4 in both polls.
And those are just the leaps into
