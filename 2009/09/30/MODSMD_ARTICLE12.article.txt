# Rankings only add to confusion
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the Lines 
Parity is running amok in col
lege football, and it's just
claimed its first off-field ca
sualty: the Associated Press
(AP) and USA Today Top 25 polls.
With top-10 teams dropping each
weekend four in the last week
alone it has become increasingly
clear that few teams deserve such
elite status, but with no "N/A" option
available, coaches (USA Today) and
journalists (AP) alike have put to
gether an assortment of teams that is
simply befuddling.
There are a few problems at work.
The first is the shuffling of teams in
the top 10 and the leaps some schools
have made despite doing practically
everything in their power to not
move up. Then there are the peculiar
rankings of squads that have played
each other lowa beat Penn State
last weekend, so naturally, as is the
case in the coaches poll, the Nittany
Lions are higher than the Hawkeyes.
Add in the inherent bias toward past
history and preseason rankings, and
you get a rankings system that is be
yond muddled.
Let's first look at some schools

that made it back into the top 10
when they most certainly did not de
serve it. Take our dear friends, the
Trojans of Southern California, for
instance, USC put together an ane
mic performance against Washington
State, the clear-cut worst team in the
conference and one of the most woe
ful BCS squads overall. The Cougars
had the unfortunate task of taking on
the Trojans in the Coliseum just a
week after Washington shockingly
upset the Pac-10's preeminent pro
gram. This had all of the makings of
your average beat-your-lesser-oppo
nent-into-submission-97-times-to-
get-back-on-track game, and yet
WSU held their own much better
than anyone anticipated. The 27-6
final was a far cry from last year's 69-
0 beat down.

What did USC get for a poor out
ing against arguably their easiest op
ponent of the year? Why, a move
from N0.12 to N0.7 in the AP, and a
move from 10 to 7 in the coaches', of
course!

LSU needed a fairly miraculous
goal line stand to hold off Mississippi
State, the Washington State of the
SEC West. How were they rewarded?
By jumping from 7 to 4 in both polls.
And those are just the leaps into

the top 10. What about the head-to
head matchups that have yielded
even stranger rankings? Oklahoma
State remains ahead of Houston in
the USA Today poll despite losing at
home to the boys from Space City
just a couple of weeks ago. Oregon
went all Brock Lesner on Cal, and yet
the Ducks are six spots behind the
Golden Bears, according to the
coaches.

So far, it appears that many of in
congruities are in the USA Today
poll. Indeed, it has its faults, and LSU
coach Les Miles came perilously
close last week to saying that he was
n't qualified to vote. But these issues
are hardly exclusive; too often, voters
rely on how well teams are supposed
to do based on how they did in the
past and how they were expected to
perform this year. It leads to lazy
analysis and even lazier rankings.
Florida, the national champion, and
Texas, who had a compelling case to
play in the championship game, are
undefeated this year? Guess that
means they're No. 1 and No. 2, goes

the common thinking.
But that's a misguided methodol
ogy-

Doug Lesmerises is a beat writer
for the Cleveland Plain Dealer and
has a vote in the AP Poll. His ballot
has received significant press lately
because of his methodology —he
bases it solely on performance and
nothing else.

As a result, Florida, which is near
ly the consensus No. 1 in both polls, is
(rightfully) out of the top spot, and
Alabama, which is playing much bet
ter football against higher-quality op
ponents, is No. 1. Boise State and
Houston, two non-BCS conference

teams, are No. 2 and No. 3, respective
ly. Texas and its cupcake schedule sits
at No. 7.

It's a fantasy world, and Lesmeris
es has his critics, but he is approach
ing his ballot in the correct way. Even
though top-10 teams continue to fall
out, that doesn't mean that they
should be replaced by the same re
treads, especially when those schools
aren't playing particularly brilliantly
themselves.

The rankings don't serve any real
purpose now except to provide a
rough barometer of where each team
is relative to another. But there is
simply no way that USC is perform

ing as well as Houston, TCU or
Cincinnati, and yet the school sits
above all three of these non-tradi
tional powers.
This may all be for naught right
now, but when the rankings factor
into the BCS computer and deter
mine who will go to which bowls, it
will be quite important. And that's
the problem when it does matter,
it would be foolish to think that vot
ers will change their ways.
