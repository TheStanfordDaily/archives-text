# Heath brings perspective to Card

### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
On a team that's stacked with underclassmen
â€”l7 of the 27 players on the Stanford women's
soccer roster are freshmen or sophomores red
shirt senior Hillary Heath offers leadership to a

group that is long on talent and potential, but
somewhat shorter on experience. Despite her
strong presence on the team, the Seattle native is
the last to suggest that she's anything more than a
small piece to the puzzle of the Cardinal's 10-0-0
season.
"I think my role has changed because I'm the

only one who has seen how far our team has come
in such a short time," Heath said. "I like to think I
can provide a little perspective for the younger
players, who came in when the team was already
really good it wasn't always like this! We've put
in a lot of work to get here."
To that end, Heath gives enormous credit to
her teammates for the improvements they've
made, both individually and collectively.
"The team has changed so much since my
freshman year, it's incredible," she said. "My first
season here, we lost to Portland and UNC, [both]
4-0. Now, we go into these games not only expect
ing to win, but [also] knowing we can. That's a
huge jump in four years, and I am so proud and
happy that I'm a part of it."
"The best part about our team this year is that
every player is amazing," she continued. "I am so
impressed with everyone, and it's just great to
play such a high level of soccer every day at prac
tice."
In addition to the group's constant improve
ment, Heath has made huge individual jumps dur
ing her four years of play in cardinal and white, but
not without facing a few challenges due to injury
and position changes.
After her arrival at Stanford, Heath played
only 11 games as a freshman forward, notching a
single goal in the Cardinal's win over Washington,
before a knee injury made her a spectator for the
rest of the regular season. Her return for the post
season was then short-lived, as Stanford dropped
in the first round of the NCAAs that year.
Heath came back with a vengeance her sopho
more year, making 18 starts and appearances in all
23 season games. She was third on the team in
