# Heath brings perspective to Card
## 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
On a team that's stacked with underclassmen
â€”l7 of the 27 players on the Stanford women's
soccer roster are freshmen or sophomores red
shirt senior Hillary Heath offers leadership to a

group that is long on talent and potential, but
somewhat shorter on experience. Despite her
strong presence on the team, the Seattle native is
the last to suggest that she's anything more than a
small piece to the puzzle of the Cardinal's 10-0-0
season.
"I think my role has changed because I'm the

only one who has seen how far our team has come
in such a short time," Heath said. "I like to think I
can provide a little perspective for the younger
players, who came in when the team was already
really good it wasn't always like this! We've put
in a lot of work to get here."
To that end, Heath gives enormous credit to
her teammates for the improvements they've
made, both individually and collectively.
"The team has changed so much since my
freshman year, it's incredible," she said. "My first
season here, we lost to Portland and UNC, [both]
4-0. Now, we go into these games not only expect
ing to win, but [also] knowing we can. That's a
huge jump in four years, and I am so proud and
happy that I'm a part of it."
"The best part about our team this year is that
every player is amazing," she continued. "I am so
impressed with everyone, and it's just great to
play such a high level of soccer every day at prac
tice."
In addition to the group's constant improve
ment, Heath has made huge individual jumps dur
ing her four years of play in cardinal and white, but
not without facing a few challenges due to injury
and position changes.
After her arrival at Stanford, Heath played
only 11 games as a freshman forward, notching a
single goal in the Cardinal's win over Washington,
before a knee injury made her a spectator for the
rest of the regular season. Her return for the post
season was then short-lived, as Stanford dropped
in the first round of the NCAAs that year.
Heath came back with a vengeance her sopho
more year, making 18 starts and appearances in all
23 season games. She was third on the team in

scoring with 12 points, and notched
key goals in the Cardinal's win over
Arizona State and its first-round
NCAA victory against Nevada.
" [But] when I first came in, I actu
ally played forward, and we played
with a holding forward in the cen
ter," Heath said, seemingly looking
to dodge individual recognition.
With her sophomore season end
ing on such a high note, Heath had "a
lot of personal goals" going into
2007, but injury struck again and she
was forced to sit out as Stanford
went 15-3-5. Heath took this in
stride, though, and saw the season as
an opportunity to learn and grow in
other ways.
"It's so hard to sit and watch your
team practice and play for a whole
season without you, so it helped me
realize how much I wanted to be out
there," Heath recalled. "I think when
I was finally back playing, it gave me
a lot of motivation to get back to the
level I had been at."
It's this motivation that she still
draws on, and clearly it's working.
Heath has added dominance as a
midfielder to her repertoire over the
last two seasons, contributing major
assists for a forward line that she de
scribes as "extremely fast, fantastic
and so fun to watch."

When asked about her own goals
for the remainder of the 2009 season,
Heath unsurprisingly returned to
her team-centric mentality.
"I really want to win the Pac-10,
and if we play like we have been,
then that's a very achievable goal,"
she said. "I also want to make it back
to the Final Four, because I want the
season to keep going! It's awful
when you lose in the earlier rounds
of playoffs because not only did you
just lose, but you [also] don't get to
go to practice anymore and see your
teammates every day.

"Plus, the main reason I came
back [for a fifth year] is because I re
ally like playing soccer, going to prac
tice everyday, and after this year I
might not have the chance to do that
again. I'm not ready to give it up."
Luckily, with Heath at the helm as
a motivator on and off the field, it's
unlikely that any of the Cardinal will
be ready to give up easily.
