## Top sports doctors visit Farm 
### JENNY PETER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While many Stanford students
were taking well-earned time away
from the Farm this summer, some of
the world's most respected sports
medicine physicians and orthopedic
surgeons were flocking to it.
In collaboration with the Interna
tional Olympic Committee and the
U.S. Olympic Committee, Stanford's
Department of Orthopedic Surgery
hosted the Second Annual Advanced
Team Physician's Course. The presti
gious social program, which allowed
attendees to exchange information in
a more intimate environment, played
host to 120 physicians from 31 coun
tries. Attendees and speakers includ
ed team physicians from a wide range
of Olympic sports, as well as from
professional sports teams in the NFL,

NBA and NHL.
During the three-day event,
speakers discussed topics that were
useful for experienced team physi
cians and relevant to elite athletes,
ranging from injury treatment and
prevention methods to disordered
eating and performance-enhancing
drugs. In addition to the speakers, the
event hosted several moderated de
bates on controversial sports medi
cine topics, such as altitude training
and dealing with concussions.
Between sessions, attendees were
able to enjoy the beautiful Stanford
campus and the surrounding area.
The group was treated to outings in
San Francisco, the Cantor Art Cen
ter, Stanford Stadium and the state
of-the-art Stanford Sports Medicine
Center, as well as the Human Perfor
mance Lab. These social events were
important in enhancing collabora-

tion between experts from several
continents.
"We were fortunate to be selected
by the International Olympic Com
mittee to co-host this meeting of
physicians from around the world,"
said Dr. Gordon Matheson, director
of the Stanford Sports Medicine Cen
ter. "It was very encouraging to wit
ness the intense interest in solving the
clinical problems we all share in com
mon."
The conference, which last year
was held in Lofoten Islands, Norway,
will be held next in Corsica, France in
2011, before returning to Stanford in
2012.
