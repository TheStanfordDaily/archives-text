## EDITORIAL UCLA Volunteer Day a good model for Stanford 
### 
While incoming Stanford freshmen
have plenty of opportunities to ex
plore public service opportunities
from the Haas Center's open house to the
endless rows of student groups at Activities
Fair another California university has
taken a more direct approach to emphasizing
public service.
On Sept. 22, almost 5,000 UCLA students
flooded the Los Angeles community for the
school's first ever Volunteer Day. The event,
the largest ever of its kind, sent waves
through the community and drew praise
from the California Secretary of Service and
Volunteering as well as the Los Angeles City
Council. The enthusiasm of the students
poured forth as they planted trees, renovated
rundown schools and picked up trash from
the beaches. In short, UCLA's day dedicated
to service was a clear success, likely to be
come an annual tradition for the start of the
UCLA school year.
In light of the success of Volunteer Day,
the Editorial Board urges Stanford to follow
UCLA's lead and incorporate public service
more deeply into the framework of New Stu
dent Orientation (NSO). Universities thrive
on ideas, and in this case UCLA has shown a
level of tenacity and ingenuity that would be
beneficial to emulate.

Stanford students come to campus as
freshmen bursting with gusto and in turn are
thrown into dozens of activities and events.
With the energy put into dorm cheers, band
run and icebreakers, why not channel some
of it toward positively affecting the commu
nity? Surely if UCLA students were willing
to put effort into a good cause, Stanford stu
dents would, as well. Further, spending an en
tire day of NSO performing public services
would help bring service-minded freshmen
together at the start of their freshman year.

Many a friendship would form through such
activities as trash pick-up, building repair and
collecting goods for the needy.
Like UCLA, Stanford should not make
public service a mandatory part of NSO, but
a strongly encouraged aspect of it. If the
event were properly advertised and promot
ed, it is easy to imagine Stanford students
turning out in droves to better the communi
ty. Beyond the direct benefit of a single serv
ice day, a planned experience would allow
students to immediately immerse themselves
in service and continue to do so past the week
of orientation.

This proposal would come as part of a
larger trend at Stanford infusing public serv
ice into its core mission. Examples are al
ready becoming evident in academic pro
grams. From a community-based learning
option of PWR 2 to a two-quarter-long histo
ry course centered on homelessness and
service, several departments already make
an effort to integrate academic knowledge
with societal work. These efforts should be
applauded, but further action can be taken.
Whether that means a volunteer day during
NSO or the addition of a public service GER
in the future, it remains for the University to
decide.

Without ethics, education can only go so
far in terms of creating responsible citizens.
With the recent financial meltdown, the reck
less greed on Wall Street has shown us all the
danger of amoral advancement. To produce
citizens that will "promote the public wel
fare," as Leland and Jane Stanford hoped, the
University must develop not only students'
intellect but also their senses of empathy and
civic responsibility. And if Stanford holds its
commitment to service as a core ideal, there
is no better time to expand it than early in the
academic year.
