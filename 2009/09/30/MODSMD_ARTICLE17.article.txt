# GET IT RIGHT
## Please pass the tray ... thanks. 
### Erica Morgan 
First day of school: The intrepid Stanford
student rises, ready to take on the world.
She grabs her coffee and muffin, and
heads off to class, excited for a year of new
knowledge, friends and frolicking.
After successfully navigating the morning
schedule, she eagerly heads to the dining hall
with her comrades to enjoy fine Stanford
lunch cuisine. Chatting enthusiastically, she
aims for the buffet, reaches for a tray... and
stops.There are no trays to be found. "Where,"
she cries, "is this simple convenience, this won
drous invention that allows me to enjoy a
lunch uninterrupted by multiple trips in and
out of the cafeteria?"

Where, indeed.
Many students have been wondering
where the trays have all gone (you can find
them hiding behind the podium where ID
cards are swiped. Ask for one next time, and
maybe the anti-tray advocates will realize that
we really would like to continue using them).
Yes, Stanford, we have gone "trayless." The
newest in a long list of environmental buzz
words, "trayless" is the new "green" and "sus
tainable" way to save our melting planet
one meal at a time.

A welcoming email from the ASSU presi
dent informed us of the situation at hand:
"Going trayless dramatically reduces food
waste, conserves energy by eliminating the
need to heat water to wash trays and saves 1/3
to 1/2 gallon of water for every tray!" Wow!
Sounds great... wait... no, it sounds like a
pain in the neck actually.
I am unconvinced of the glory of "trayless."
Here we have a blatant example of how good
intentions can go wildly awry. Water conserva
tion is never a bad idea. I don't think any stu
dent starts the day thinking to himself, "Gee, I
wonder how much water I can waste today! To
the bathroom!"

Being aware of our water consumption lev
els and self-moderating our water use is fan
tastic. However, when some faction runs wild
with the idea and finds ecological validation in
ripping my tray from my fingers, I draw the
line. The University dining halls crossed that
line when they decided to micro-manage my
personal tray-using behaviors.
I have a suggestion for water conservation
that may seem blatantly ridiculous, but I think
a discerning reader will actually appreciate its
brilliance.

Background: I have recently started run
ning for exercise. On days that I run, I con
sume about a 1/2-gallon more water than I
would ordinarily. I also burn roughly 600 more
calories than I would ordinarily. I also breathe
quite heavily, surely expelling a great deal
more carbon dioxide than the average tourist
strolling the campus. The increased water con
sumption means (not to be graphic) more
trips to the lady's room. Meaning more toilet
flushes. Meaning even more water used! Will

the "waste" never end?
Let's give Stanford University another
level of micromanagement. We should pro
hibit students from exercising strenuously.
Sure, I enjoy running, but do I really need to
run? Probably not. This would take greater
steps toward saving the environment than ces
sation of tray usage, and just imagine if every
student on campus were forced to hand over
their running shoes!
Of course, the lack of exercise might then
lead to weight gain among students, which
could be a problem for health risks and such.
But this is perfect! Stanford should ration
food! Students should only be fed what they
absolutely need for "sustainable" life, and
thereby not be allowed to gain weight. This
eliminates food waste! And it gets better!
Less food means we don't even need trays in
the first place. What a beautiful world that
would be.
I would like to conclude with a few solid
facts and figures. In June 2008, Stanford Uni
versity consumed 2.3 million gallons of water
per day. If you assume that every Stanford stu
dent (6,000 students) consumes 14 meals per
week in dining halls (a gross exaggeration)
and thereby uses 42 trays per week, then the
most reduction that "trayless" can ever hope
to achieve is 0.17 percent of daily usage.This is
a pittance in the water world. Think about this:
If every student cut shower time by one
minute, four times this amount of water could
be saved. But is the University timing our
showers? I hope not. And I hope it never will.
Don't fall victim to the preaching of envi
ronmental evangelists seeking to dissipate the
apathy from their lives. I urge you to stand up
for the simple conveniences that should never
make you feel guilty. When we pay nearly
$2,000 for a dining plan, I suspect a tray can be
tossed into the bargain.

Chastise, congratulate, chide. Email Erica at

Let's give Stanford
another level of
micromanagement.
We should prohibit
exercising strenuously.
