sorry swine flu, but only a Hungarian Horn
tail could stop Stanford students from pub
licly swapping spit. Strangely enough, absent
from Stanford's long list of unusual tradi
tions is sitting on a stool in front of our class
mates and putting on a hat that somehow
tells us where we "ought to be."
It appears that the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
does nothing more than state the obvious by
telling first-year wizards what traits they pos
sess and what they are best suited to pursue.
Usage of such a sorting hat would thereby be
thoroughly unnecessary at Stanford. We al
ready have the School of Fuzzies, clearly char
acterized by acumen in the liberal arts, and the
School of Techies, for those devoted to all as
pects of the "real" sciences. Even Harry is able
to determine that Gryffindor House, into
which he is finally sorted, is the most appropri
ate fit. However, as Professor Dumbledore
later points out to Harry, the Sorting Hat
seems to understand its wearers on a much
deeper level by demonstrating that it is our de
cisions, not our talents, that reveal who each of
us is at the core and that will ultimately deter
mine the kind of people we grow to be.
In Harry's first encounter with the Sorting
Hat, the hat is certain, while looking into his
head, that Slytherin House, famed for churn
ing out particularly nasty wizards, would be
an excellent fit for him. Despite eventually
being sorted into Gryffindor, Harry panics

and believes that, because the Sorting Hat
pointed out that his innate traits indicate he
would have succeeded in Slytherin, he is au
tomatically doomed to suffer a stereotypical
Slytherin fate.
With so much Stanford techie-and-fuzzy
speak going around and the obligatory selec
tion of a major, there is naturally a tendency
for self-definition by academic gifts. Like
Harry, we can fall into the trap of believing
our talents and abilities are solely responsi
ble for determining the course of our lives.
There is no denying the fact that our
strengths do influence where we go; howev
er, we err when we believe that our skills are
some sort of Point-Me Spell (useful for Harry
during the Triwizard Tournament, though not
strong enough for navigating him safely
through the Circle of Death) that solely de
termines our life's trajectory.
Whether the group is Fuzzie, Gryffindor,
Techie or Slytherin, it's instinctive to hide be
hind these labels, making claims for their va
lidity and inevitability. As a result, we must be
careful not to get lost in these groupings. For
if these labels do define us, it appears that our
lives have been laid out for us since birth,
leading us to live a sort of half-life predeter
mined by factors over which we have no con
trol. Admittedly, it is quite tempting to simply
embrace the individual we were born as,
rather than actively shaping the person we
want to become. Putting weight on our deci
sions can be both time-consuming and men
tally exhausting. As Stanford students, who
don't want to screw up all the opportunities
that are available to us, we find ourselves
overwhelmed and skirting toward uncom
fortable and, well, unnerving directions.
This notion took Harry a good two books
to recognize, and he didn't even make the dis

covery without Dumbledore pointing out
what really happened between Harry and the
Sorting Hat. Despite the hat's murmurings
about how Harry could belong to Slytherin
based on his capabilities, it finally submits to
Harry's request and places him in Gryffind
or. Harry's choice leads him down a road
where he is enabled to literally turn the Sort
ing Hat upside down and whip out Godric
Gryffindor's sword in order to defeat
Slytherin's venom-fanged basilisk. Evidently,
decisions matter. Thus, our challenge at Stan
ford is to be sensitive to these chances for us
to make hard choices, which will ultimately
empower us and reveal more about our char
acter than any major or career choice could.
Then again, if the decision-making deal
paralyzes and petrifies you too much, just
keep hanging in there. We hear that herbolo
gy researchers at Stanford are making some
pretty amazing development with Man
drakes you should be out in no time.

Despite the Sorting Hat's warnings, Melanie and
Brian have, in fact, gotten stuck in a flap. To send
