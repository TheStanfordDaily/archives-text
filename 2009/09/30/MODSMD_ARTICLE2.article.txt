# STUDENT ACTIVISM
## Pilipinos rally for victims of typhoon 
### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
Early Saturday morning, while Stanford stu
dents were fast asleep, Typhoon Ketsana inun
dated Luzon, the main island of the Philippines.
It was the largest typhoon to hit the island since
1967.

Now, some Stanford students are saying their
friends and family on the island cannot be
reached.

In only 12 hours, the Philippine capital Manila
and 25 provinces received 17 inches of rain,

enough to cause massive flooding and power
outages, stop all air traffic and displace half a mil
lion people.
According to Aurora David 'l2, treasurer of
Stanford's Pilipino-American Student Union
(PASU), 140 people were reported dead and at
least 40 others were missing as of Monday. Since
then, the death toll has risen to 250.
David, who grew up in the Philippines, said
she has not yet been able to contact all of her
friends and family affected by the typhoon, which
disrupted cell phone and Internet service.
PASU member Jamie Querubin 'll explained

the worry of some Pilipino students. "With no
electricity, no cell phones and no Internet, people
here are really worried because we don't know
what's happening there," Querubin said.
According to Querubin, one Stanford alum
nus and honorary PASU member is currently in
medical school in the main province hit by the
typhoon.
"We hadn't heard from him and we were wor
ried," Querubin said. "He just sent an email
telling us about the chaos. He was accessing

heard from him
and we were
worried."

Internet in a mall that hadn't been
hit. He's been relocating, but is final
ly safe and so far has been helping
people clean up their homes."
Although the Philippines com
monly has a typhoon season, this
typhoon was particularly disastrous
because it hit the metropolitan area
of Manila, which houses about 12
million people.
"It's common to see flooding in
provincial areas and displacement in
the outskirts of Manila during
typhoon season," Querubin said.
"What's unusual is that this typhoon
hit metro Manila."
Although the heaviest rain has
passed through the Philippines, con
cerns about relief and recovery still
exist.
Prof. Brian McAdoo, who taught

in the School of Earth Sciences at
Stanford for the 2008-09 school year
while on sabbatical from Vassal'
College, said the Philippines is not
out of danger yet.
"Flood waters usually subside
within hours to days, yet standing
water can remain for quite a while
longer," McAdoo said in an email to
The Daily.
McAdoo added that while the
course of a typhoon can be predict
ed, its secondary effects are not as
easily foreseen. "While it is highly
likely that there will be extensive
land-sliding associated with the rain
fall, it is very difficult to predict
where this land-sliding will occur,
especially with enough lead time to
call for an evacuation," McAdoo
said.
In response to the devastation,
PASU and several other student
organizations have teamed up to
alert Stanford students about the dis
aster and raise money for the
Philippines Red Cross.

"Our plan is to go to dorm meet
ings to talk about the disaster and get
donations," David said. "They also
need clothing, so we plan to have
boxes in dorms so that students can
drop things off."
Because of the increased risk of
mosquito-borne illnesses and other
medical issues, PASU plans to con
tact the School of Medicine regard
ing sending medical supplies to the
Philippines.
As part of the campaign to raise
awareness, PASU core member
Andrew Plan made announcements
about the typhoon and handed out
informational flyers during his guitar
concert at the CoHo on Tuesday
night.
Members of Stanford's South
East Asian Leadership Network
(SEALNet), who have teamed with
PASU, feel that continuing commu
nity support will be important in
long-term relief efforts.
"Even after this initial push for
relief, there will still need to be help

over the next year to clean up infra
structure and deal with health
issues," said Noelle Pineda 'lO of
SEALNet. "I really hope the
Stanford community keeps up with it
throughout this year."
Pineda said SEALNet and PASU
have been tabling in White Plaza
with computers for students to learn
about the disaster and donate money
to the Red Cross, at www.redcross.
org.ph.
PASU has already been contacted
by groups at UC-Berkeley who hope
to organize intercollegiate relief
efforts.
Querubin agreed that the empha
sis on community mobilization is
essential to recovery in the
Philippines. "Initially, the feeling was
of worry about people that we per
sonally know," she said. "Now, we are
trying to build a community relief
effort."
