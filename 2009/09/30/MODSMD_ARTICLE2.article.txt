### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
Early Saturday morning, while Stanford stu
dents were fast asleep, Typhoon Ketsana inun
dated Luzon, the main island of the Philippines.
It was the largest typhoon to hit the island since
1967.

Now, some Stanford students are saying their
friends and family on the island cannot be
reached.

In only 12 hours, the Philippine capital Manila
and 25 provinces received 17 inches of rain,

enough to cause massive flooding and power
outages, stop all air traffic and displace half a mil
lion people.
According to Aurora David 'l2, treasurer of
Stanford's Pilipino-American Student Union
(PASU), 140 people were reported dead and at
least 40 others were missing as of Monday. Since
then, the death toll has risen to 250.
David, who grew up in the Philippines, said
she has not yet been able to contact all of her
friends and family affected by the typhoon, which
disrupted cell phone and Internet service.
PASU member Jamie Querubin 'll explained

the worry of some Pilipino students. "With no
electricity, no cell phones and no Internet, people
here are really worried because we don't know
what's happening there," Querubin said.
According to Querubin, one Stanford alum
nus and honorary PASU member is currently in
medical school in the main province hit by the
typhoon.
"We hadn't heard from him and we were wor
ried," Querubin said. "He just sent an email
telling us about the chaos. He was accessing

"We hadn't
heard from him
and we were
worried."
