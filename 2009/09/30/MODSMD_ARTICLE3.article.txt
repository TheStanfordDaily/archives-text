## False fire alarms are prevalent Fire officials say equipment is adequate; staff frustrated

Stanford firefighters have responded to 21
false alarms since students moved in on Sept.
17, prompting frustration among students and
assurances from one official that this fall has
been typical and that campus safety protocol is
adequate.
Branner Hall residents were evacuated
three times last Thursday between 4:30 a.m.
and around 9:30 p.m., all for false alarms. At
least three students said they slept through an
alarm. A fourth alarm at Branner last week
was for a scheduled drill.
"It's just frustrating," said Branner
Resident Assistant (RA) Viral Shah 'll, who,
along with other staff, had to round up resi

"This is the first time we've had false alarms
like these in the three years I've been a resi
dent fellow," said Branner RF Clyde
Moneyhun in an email to The Daily. "Every
other time, it's been either a fire drill (always
during daytime hours) or a real emergency (a
couple of kitchen fires)."
Shah said the staff heard various explana
tions of the root problem from firefighters,
including that a faulty sensor the same one
causing all three false alarms was extremely
sensitive and could be set off by spider webs or
even dust. Shah added that the staff were
never given a definitive explanation and is still
unsure of exactly what happened.
Captain Barry Marchisio of Palo Alto Fire
Station No. 6, the primary responder to cam
pus calls, said dust, spider webs or malfunctions
could indeed be the cause for alarm.
"The alarms do periodically go bad,"
Marchisio said. "If you think about how many
smoke detectors are in each building, it's a
large system to maintain and periodically
you'll have malfunctions."
His crew has responded to 18 other false
alarms on campus since Sept. 17. "You expect
them to be set off sometimes by students cook
ing, or when a football hits a detector," he said.
The latest University safety report, released
yesterday by the Stanford Department of
Public Safety, confirms Marchisio's notion that
