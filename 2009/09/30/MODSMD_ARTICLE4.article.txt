Senators hear budget proposals, dissent
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 introduced two
bills proposing the creation of a yearly
appropriations budget and a budget for
fiscal year 2010.
Reference to the previous year's
spending framed the discussion of the
bills. According to ASSU Financial
Manager Matthew McLaughlin ('08), the

Senate had approximately $298,000 to
allocate to student groups last year and
allocated a further $112,000 from the
reserve fund to make up for deficit
spending beyond the general funds
account. He said effects of the deficit will
be felt for at least five years.
Alongside a yearly cap, one bill would
require monthly expenditure guidelines
and significant internal review by the
Senate Appropriations Committee, a fea
ture Katz highlighted in his presentation
to the Senate.
Former Senator Stephanie Epps 'lO
cautioned the Senate that a fixed budget
may not be possible because of the high
degree of variability in student groups'
monthly expenditures. She strongly sug
gested that the ASSU propose monthly

guidelines but not enforce a cap, saying
such a precedent would unfairly establish
procedural constraints on future Senate
groups.
"The old Senate should not be impos
ing their views on how to run the Senate
onto the new Senate," Epps said.
The bills were tabled until next week's
meeting.

the ASSU, are going to fall short after a year of budget deficits. The class budget may not cover the costs of the Halloween fest.
