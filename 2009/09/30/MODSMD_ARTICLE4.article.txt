Ongoing budget issues took center
stage last night at the first meeting of the
11th Undergraduate Senate, where con

and Mausoleum Party financing dominat

Senators hear budget proposals, dissent
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 introduced two
bills proposing the creation of a yearly
appropriations budget and a budget for
fiscal year 2010.
Reference to the previous year's
spending framed the discussion of the
bills. According to ASSU Financial
Manager Matthew McLaughlin ('08), the

Senate had approximately $298,000 to
allocate to student groups last year and
allocated a further $112,000 from the
reserve fund to make up for deficit
spending beyond the general funds
account. He said effects of the deficit will
be felt for at least five years.
Alongside a yearly cap, one bill would
require monthly expenditure guidelines
and significant internal review by the
Senate Appropriations Committee, a fea
ture Katz highlighted in his presentation
to the Senate.
Former Senator Stephanie Epps 'lO
cautioned the Senate that a fixed budget
may not be possible because of the high
degree of variability in student groups'
monthly expenditures. She strongly sug
gested that the ASSU propose monthly

guidelines but not enforce a cap, saying
such a precedent would unfairly establish
procedural constraints on future Senate
groups.
"The old Senate should not be impos
ing their views on how to run the Senate
onto the new Senate," Epps said.
The bills were tabled until next week's
meeting.

der diversity.
Prior to the meeting, Senator
Zachary Warma 'll, also columns
editor for The Daily, issued an email
to the Senate and graduate student
community, stating his concerns
about the Judicial Affairs Board's
possible interference with the nomi
nations process.
"In the opinion of many, myself
included, we cannot constitutionally
or ethically approve this board,"
Warma wrote. "Steps are being
taken to reverse Judicial Affairs'
undue actions."
Present at last night's meeting
were Judicial Affairs Board
Administrator Rick Yuen and
Judicial Advisor Jamie Pontius-
Hogan. Although the Board had
issued concerns over the nominees
picked by the Nominations
Commission (NomCom) last spring,
Yuen stressed that the decision to
follow the office's guidance lies
squarely with the Undergraduate
Senate.

"We do not have the capacity to
appoint board members," Yuen said.

"The charter only works if the ASSU
and the GSC [Graduate Student
Council] appoint six students to the
Office of Judicial Affairs."
All other NomCom appointees
were approved unanimously by the
Senate, which will deliberate over
appointing the original six candi
dates to the Judicial Affairs Board at
next week's meeting.

Mausoleum Party facing budget
shortfalls

Junior class presidents
approached the Senate with grave
concerns regarding a serious lack of
funding for the Mausoleum Party,
an annual Halloween-season party
held at the Stanford family burial
site.
The party, which has traditionally
been organized and executed by the
junior class presidents, lost $14,000
in ASSU funding as a result of
University-wide budget cuts.
Pilar Wong 'll said the cost of
the event was approximately the
size of the entire junior class budget
and that it was unreasonable to
expect the junior class to pay for an
event for the entire community,
potentially sacrificing its funding for
junior formal.
"Our job is to provide class unity
activities for the junior class, as we

are the junior class presidents," said
Mona Hadidi 'll. "Right now, with
Mausoleum, we won't be able to
throw a junior class formal."
Presidents Dante DiCicco and
Max Hawes said that despite the
budget cuts, the junior class was will
ing to contribute $2,500 to the
Mausoleum Party efforts. The junior
class presidents are planning to con
sult both the GSC and the Senate
Appropriations Committee for fur
ther funding.

AxeComm seeks FanatAXE money

Axe Committee (AxeComm)
Chairman Kim Tran 'll and
Financial Officer Austen Wianecki
'll requested leftover funds from
the budget of FanatAXE, a now
defunct athletic fan group founded
by Warma last year.
According to the Appropriations
Committee, FanatAXE left approxi
mately $ll,OOO in take-backs that
were transferred to the ASSU and
SSE general funds after the group
folded. The FanatAXE constitution,
however, contained a non-binding
clause stipulating that all unspent
funds be transferred to the
AxeComm, contingent on approval
from the Senate.
Tran and Wianecki said last
year's ASSU Executives pledged

the leftover funds to the Axe
Committee.
Wianecki said AxeComm failed
to apply for special fees last year,
leaving it with only $l,OOO in its gen
eral fund and about $9,900 in
reserves. Tran added that without
money provided from the
FanatAXE budget, the group would
not be able to fund any events
beyond its annual Big Game rally.
Additionally, Tran said the group
would no longer have the funds to
maintain the case housing the Axe
at Arrillaga Family Sports Center,
and would be unable to pay to
restore the cannon that fires at the
start of each game.
"All events occur fall quarter and
must be planned for and paid for
soon," Tran said.
Senate Appropriations Chair
Anton Zeitsman 'l2 said the
Appropriations Committee was
unaware of any previous agree
ments between the former ASSU
Executives and AxeComm, and that
such an informal agreement was
unconstitutional. Fie invited Tran
and Wianecki to submit a detailed
budget for consideration by the
Appropriations Committee,
