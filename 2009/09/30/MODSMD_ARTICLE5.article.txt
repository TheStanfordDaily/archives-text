## Tree tussle leads to three Cal arrests Fans say they didn't steel leaves; Tree describes confusion 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
It started with a "big nudge" to the Stanford
Tree and ended with three Cal fans, dressed as
lumberjacks, arrested Friday night as the
Stanford band played them off to The Tubes'
"White Punks on Dope."
Eyewitnesses disagree about what happened
in between.
What is clear is that three men were arrest
ed Friday at 9:55 p.m. outside UC-Berkeley's
Flaas Pavilion after a brush between fans and
the Stanford Tree by day, Jonathan Strange
'll —who was there with the band to play at
the women's volleyball game.
Where accounts differ is whether the three
arrested a Cal student, a graduate and a fan,
all dressed as lumberjacks stole leaves from
the Tree, fled or resisted arrest, or were simply
bystanders. Also contested is the police's claim,
reported in The Daily Californian, that the
three were "very intoxicated."
One man also alleges that police beat one of
the arrestees, which Strange corroborated, a
claim to which officers could not immediately
respond.
Arrested were Will Allanson, 24, a Cal sen
ior; Erick Karlen, 23, a 2007 graduate; and
Derrick Gillan, 22.
Berkeley police said Allanson was arrested
for battery, resisting arrest and possession of a
locking blade knife longer than 2.5 inches.
Gillan and Karlen were arrested for battery
and excluded from campus for seven days.
Still, whether the men were involved in the
Tree tussle remains unclear.
Strange and other band members contend
he was pushed and that a Cal fan, dressed as a
lumberjack, stole several leaves from the Tree
costume, tripped a cop and fled before CJ.
Jameson 'lO, a Stanford trumpet player, and
Seth Snyder, an assistant to the dean of student
life, ran the fan down as other fans blocked for
the leaf-grabber, then held him for police. The
melee came midway through a post-game bat
tle of the bands between the two schools in a
plaza outside the pavilion.
Peter McDonald 'll, a band spokesperson,
corroborated that account.
Strange acknowledged that his
vision from inside the Tree costume
is limited, calling the overriding
emotion of the moment "confu
sion."
"Maybe they were afraid of the
Dollies," who cleared the area just
before the leaf grab, Strange said.
"All of a sudden I got a big nudge."

Karlen, one of the men arrested
in the following minutes, said the
police had the wrong guys.
"The three of us were standing
with a number of people dressed
like lumberjacks, watching the bat
tle of the bands after the game,"
Karlen said in an email to The Daily.
"At some point the Stanford band
came charging our direction.
Apparently they were chasing after
a guy dressed as a lumberjack who
had grabbed a leaf off the tree and
was fleeing the scene with it in his
hands.

"Amid the confusion, Will was
tackled from behind by a UCPD
officer who proceeded to beat him
with a nightstick as he lay facedown
on the ground," Karlen added.
Strange confirmed that police
had someone pinned: "This lumber
jack was resisting arrest, and the cop
was beating the shit out of him."
Campus police could not imme
diately respond to that allegation.
Allanson wrote of the moment in
an email to The Daily: "I was hang
ing out near the edge of the circle
around the dancing mascot trying to

get the best view over the crowd. All
of a sudden I did see out of the cor
ner of my eye a guy run and grab the
leaf off the tree and then run
straight past me, but I wasn't expect
ing it and 1 was actually kind of star
tled, especially when a huge group
of people immediately surged after
him and straight at me.
"The next thing I knew I was
being tackled, I presumed by one of
the people running past/over me,"
Allanson wrote.
Karlen continued, "As other lum
berjacks quietly left the scene,
Derrick and I stayed to make sure
our friend was alright and to give a
statement if so asked. To our sur
prise, the officer instead just arrest
ed anyone still standing around who
also happened to be dressed like a
lumberjack without asking us any
questions." The three were arrested.
They were taken to the campus
police station, Karlen said, and then
to the main Berkeley jail, where
they were released around 4 a.m.
after posting bail.
He said a police claim that the
three were "very intoxicated" was
wrong, and claimed in an interview
with The Daily that they were not
"hammered" and were never given
a breathalyzer test.
The leaves were recovered in the
scuffle, said band members.
Those involved drew different
conclusions from the Friday arrests.
Strange was upbeat: "Trips to Cal
are fun for me, because I have the
ability to provoke and let them take
their passion for the rivalry and
hatred of me to a whole new level."
"Don't bother retaliating,"
Strange added. "I feed off their
anger and enjoy every second of it.
.. I'm in a great mood after this
weekend."
Karlen's concerns were less opti
mistic.
"It is ironic that we were arrested
for battery by a [police officer] who
had just beaten our friend with a big
stick the moment before," he said.
"Unfortunately, we were just really
easy targets. We took the fall for
someone else's poor decision. If we
had been wearing anything else, we
would never have been accused or
arrested."
He said the three are scheduled
for arraignment next month.
Gillan could not be reached for
comment by press time.
