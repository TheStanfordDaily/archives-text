## Tree tussle leads to three Cal arrests Fans say they didn't steel leaves; Tree describes confusion 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
It started with a "big nudge" to the Stanford
Tree and ended with three Cal fans, dressed as
lumberjacks, arrested Friday night as the
Stanford band played them off to The Tubes'
"White Punks on Dope."
Eyewitnesses disagree about what happened
in between.
What is clear is that three men were arrest
ed Friday at 9:55 p.m. outside UC-Berkeley's
Flaas Pavilion after a brush between fans and
the Stanford Tree by day, Jonathan Strange
'll â€”who was there with the band to play at
the women's volleyball game.
Where accounts differ is whether the three
arrested a Cal student, a graduate and a fan,
all dressed as lumberjacks stole leaves from
the Tree, fled or resisted arrest, or were simply
bystanders. Also contested is the police's claim,
reported in The Daily Californian, that the
three were "very intoxicated."
One man also alleges that police beat one of
the arrestees, which Strange corroborated, a
claim to which officers could not immediately
respond.
Arrested were Will Allanson, 24, a Cal sen
ior; Erick Karlen, 23, a 2007 graduate; and
Derrick Gillan, 22.
Berkeley police said Allanson was arrested
for battery, resisting arrest and possession of a
locking blade knife longer than 2.5 inches.
Gillan and Karlen were arrested for battery
and excluded from campus for seven days.
Still, whether the men were involved in the
Tree tussle remains unclear.
Strange and other band members contend
he was pushed and that a Cal fan, dressed as a
lumberjack, stole several leaves from the Tree
costume, tripped a cop and fled before CJ.
Jameson 'lO, a Stanford trumpet player, and
Seth Snyder, an assistant to the dean of student
life, ran the fan down as other fans blocked for
the leaf-grabber, then held him for police. The
melee came midway through a post-game bat
tle of the bands between the two schools in a
plaza outside the pavilion.
Peter McDonald 'll, a band spokesperson,
corroborated that account.
