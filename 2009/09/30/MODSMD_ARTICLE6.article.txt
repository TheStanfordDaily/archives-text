## Grad Student Council to meet tonight; healthcare is lead concern 
### CAROLINE CHEN 
A lack of healthcare options for depend
ents is a growing concern for Graduate
Student Council (GSC) representatives, who
are set to meet tonight in their second meet
ing of the new quarter.
The council has struggled for three years
to help graduate students with dependents to

find affordable health insurance. Stanford
discontinued its dependent healthcare plan in
2006. Without a dependent healthcare plan
provided by the University, graduate students
with spouses or children must either seek
expensive private health insurance or, for
those who qualify, turn to subsidized public
options such as the state-sponsored Healthy
Families program.

But over the summer, Healthy Families
came precariously close to losing funding
when California lawmakers scrambled to bal
ance the state budget. Although lawmakers
passed a bill on Sept. 3 to rescue Healthy
Families, there is a long waitlist to join the
program.
"Who knows what will happen in the
future?" asked Nanna Notthoff, psychology

graduate student and co-chair of the GSC.
Notthoff is concerned about those graduate
students who cannot afford, or risk losing,
their dependent health insurance.
Council members say they look forward
to working this year with the ASSU and the
Healthcare Advocacy Committee to assess
graduate students' needs in terms of health
care. Notthoff said the GSC wishes primarily

to "be involved in bringing the issue for
ward." She also believes a reasonable solu
tion can be reached by working with, instead
of against, the administration.
Currently, the way the issue will resolve
itself is unclear. Last year, Towers-Perrin, a
consulting firm, conducted a survey on behalf
