## Grad Student Council to meet tonight; healthcare is lead concern 
### CAROLINE CHEN 
A lack of healthcare options for depend
ents is a growing concern for Graduate
Student Council (GSC) representatives, who
are set to meet tonight in their second meet
ing of the new quarter.
The council has struggled for three years
to help graduate students with dependents to

find affordable health insurance. Stanford
discontinued its dependent healthcare plan in
2006. Without a dependent healthcare plan
provided by the University, graduate students
with spouses or children must either seek
expensive private health insurance or, for
those who qualify, turn to subsidized public
options such as the state-sponsored Healthy
Families program.

But over the summer, Healthy Families
came precariously close to losing funding
when California lawmakers scrambled to bal
ance the state budget. Although lawmakers
passed a bill on Sept. 3 to rescue Healthy
Families, there is a long waitlist to join the
program.
"Who knows what will happen in the
future?" asked Nanna Notthoff, psychology

graduate student and co-chair of the GSC.
Notthoff is concerned about those graduate
students who cannot afford, or risk losing,
their dependent health insurance.
Council members say they look forward
to working this year with the ASSU and the
Healthcare Advocacy Committee to assess
graduate students' needs in terms of health
care. Notthoff said the GSC wishes primarily

to "be involved in bringing the issue for
ward." She also believes a reasonable solu
tion can be reached by working with, instead
of against, the administration.
Currently, the way the issue will resolve
itself is unclear. Last year, Towers-Perrin, a
consulting firm, conducted a survey on behalf
of Vaden Health Center about
University healthcare issues.
However, until the data analysis is
complete, it seems the GSC will not
have a concrete plan of action to deal
with the healthcare issue.
Another healthcare issue, the
controversial $167 Vaden fee that
began this year, is no longer a high
priority item of discussion, student
government leaders said.
"Of course, people don't like pay
ing extra money," said ASSU
President David Gobaud 'OB, M.S.
'lO. But, he said, he believes the grad
uate student town hall in July helped
answer many questions and clear up
a lot of the confusion that surround
ed the University's decision to imple
ment this fee.
Hanna Popick, a psychology grad
uate student and a member of the
health care committee, agreed with
Gobaud, explaining that many stu
dents now realize that if the fee had
n't been implemented, tuition would
have been raised instead. According
to Popick, there are no immediate
plans to address the Vaden fee.
Also on tonight's agenda is a vote
on funding for nine student groups,
ranging from business groups such as
the Stanford Solar & Wind Energy
Project to interest groups such as the

Vegetarian Students for Conscious
Living. Currently, the council has
more than $150,000 in funds to dis
perse among 40 voluntary student
organizations, an amount that has
not been affected by the recession
because it is funded by student activ
ity fees.
Ryan Peacock, a chemical engi
neering graduate and financial offi
cer of the GSC, predicted that the
council would see more funding
requests in the upcoming academic
year because many departments
have cut their budgets and are no
longer funding departmental social
activities. Student groups are there
fore turning to the GSC to fund
these events.
"We are hesitant to fund events
that are usually funded out of
departments," Peacock said,
"because the GSC only funds events
that are open to the entire graduate
student population." Peacock was
also wary that if the GSC agreed to
fund the events now, it would be
called upon to continue funding even
after the economy recovered.
Council members will also
receive updates tonight from the
ASSU Executives and the
Nomination Committee.
The GSC meets at 6 p.m. in the
Nairobi Room of the Graduate
Community Center. The meeting is
open to the public.
