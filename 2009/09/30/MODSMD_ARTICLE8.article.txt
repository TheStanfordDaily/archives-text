## THE
						AXE & PALM'S NEW GROOVE 
### EMILY RIALS 
It's 11:30 a.m., and the doors of the Axe
& Palm swing open. Steady percussion
and pop instrumentals pour into the
otherwise quiet spaces of Old Union.
The flow of students commences, mark
ing a new day of business.

"Ooh!" exclaims one student as she walks to
the back with her food. "Chips and salsa!"
When the campus eatery first opened its
doors this year, it did so as a changed space.
"We've made menu changes, we've changed
service plans," explained Michael Gratz, execu
tive director of Stanford Hospitality &
Auxiliaries. "We rearranged some service func
tions to really better serve the students. We've
done a cosmetic renovation, and we put the
pool table in."
The pool table in the back of the restaurant
shiny and sleek is just one of the new
additions to the Axe & Palm. Patrons can now
elect to take food from the "grab and go" sec
tion and check out at a register separate from
the register used to ring up hot food orders.
Also, instead of calling out receipt numbers to
deliver food to students, the Axe & Palm staff
now distribute buzzers that alert students to
come pick up their orders when they're ready.
"The new pick-up system is much more effi
cient," said Chad Meirose'll. "Last year, a lot
of people got their food stolen. This seems like
it will lessen the entropy."
In addition to substantial changes made to
the system of distributing food, significant
changes have been made to the food options
themselves. "Our goal is to ensure availability
of healthy food options," Gratz said.
Six months ago, Stanford Hospitality &
Auxiliaries partnered with the ASSU and the

Undergraduate Health and Wellness Team to
reexamine the Axe & Palm's menu. The
options, chalked up on the eatery's menu
boards, signal the healthier direction in which
the establishment intends to move.

"We've incorporated natural meat into the
food," said General Manager Barbara
Whittaker. "We have a new vegan burger for
people who have that diet. We have more all
natural, organic foods, and we're moving away
from the more processed foods."
Many of these changes, Gratz and Whittaker
explain, were made as a result of feedback gar
nered from a survey sent out to students in the
spring. After Whittaker collaborated with
Stanford Dining chefs to create a revamped
menu, a mid-August "tasting" further involved
the student body in the process.

"We had a number of students who wanted
to participate in the tasting and provide some
feedback," Gratz explained. "We provided
samples of all the new menu items. The feed
back was so overwhelming and so positive that
we went ahead with those items."

New fresh salads, an increased variety of
crepes, and "sliders," which allow students to
mix and match sandwich choices, are among
the many additions to the menu. Whittaker also
collaborated with a representative from the
Muslim student community to put together
halal meal options.
Students are largely pleased with the
changes made to the establishment. "The food
is great," said Jin Tik Ngai 'l2. "It just takes a
long time to get it."
Others appreciate the Axe & Palm's
attempts to be healthy, but miss some items
that have been removed from the menu in the
revamping process.
"The menu seems more centered around
fresh produce, which I appreciate, and 1 like

that the menu rotates," said Rachel Hoyde 'll.
"At the same time, I had staples like the Nutella
crepes and the chicken sandwich that I could
always eat, so I never turned away [from the
Axe & Palm] in disgust before."

Other students didn't notice much of a
change at all. "Honestly, I don't think it's that
different now," said Christina Liou 'll.

Whittaker and Gratz point to emails and
comment cards as evidence that students
appreciate the changes made to the eatery.
"[Students] really love the fact that there are
more registers and the lines aren't as long,"
Whittaker explained. "And they like the food
because it's healthier. On one comment card,
somebody just wrote 'WOW' in big red letters."

This sort of feedback bears witness to the
appreciation certain groups of students feel
toward the Axe & Palm's new diversity of
dietary options. At the same time, one group in
particular may find itself struggling to accept
the changes those students who liked the
Axe & Palm menu just the way it was.
"I don't like the changes," said Jimmy
Tang'l2. "But I like junk food. I understand
how they're trying to make things healthier,
and the food is definitely more healthy."
For now, the Axe & Palm has no plans to
stop its efforts to improve and make students
happier. "We will continue to look for ways to
make the Axe & Palm a wonderful place where
students can socialize, where the food is great,
where the ambiance is good, where you can
meet your friends," Gratz said. "That is the
vision we have for the Axe & Palm."
