# Long-distance love:
## From the Farm to the faraway 
### ERIC DUNN 
Count it as another effect of the digital
age: Long-distance relationships are
common for many Stanford students. In
fact, some 4.4 million college students
are now embracing them, according to
the Center for Long Distance Relationships.
The days of sending letters by snail mail or run
ning up the phone bill have passed. Instead, part
ners remain in contact through technology that just
a decade before was unimaginable or unrealistic.
These relationships are more manageable when a
significant other can be a text message away or on
the other side of a video screen.

"I think technology really helped to keep our
relationship strong," said Cristina Shea 'l2. "My
boyfriend's parents did a long-distance relationship
in college, too, and they were only able to speak
maybe once a week because landline phone calls
were so expensive."
Programs like Skype, a free text and video chat
software, have helped Stanford couples keep up
with small displays of emotion a smile or a quiet
laugh that just don't come across over the
phone, in an emoticon or through ink blots on a
page.

And while every long-distance relationship is
different, they all come with their own problems.
Some relationships take the strain only for a couple
weeks; others can last for months and even years.
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, but
physical distance between people can create emo
tional distance.

"It's hard to imagine how hard it's going to be
before you hit the stride of your academics and
activities," said Shawn Wallace 'l3. "That's when you
realize it's harder to be together than to break up."
Every relationship between two people depends
on trust, but a long-distance, romantic relationship
requires a real leap of faith. Stanford is a uniquely
social academic environment; new faces can intimi
date a long-distance partner.
Still, Stanford couples have found that it is pos
sible to enjoy their time apart.
"I love to see my boyfriend, but when I can't, I
can't," said Callie Rice, who is dating a Stanford
student. "I miss him and I know he misses me, but
neither of us should miss out."

Even with tools like Skype and healthy habits,
long-distance relationships can be personally and
publicly difficult. Many male students find that it
isn't easy to go to a party surrounded by smart,
attractive women and be loyal to the pictures in
their wallets. Stanford is a lifestyle, a set of
acronyms and traditions that shelter us from the
outside world and the people in it.
But many students cite two milestones for long
distance relationships: Thanksgiving break and the
eight-month mark.

"Everyone knows about the Turkey Drop
dating life at Stanford takes off after break," said
Morgan Duffy 'l3.
The Turkey Drop has become part of the lan
guage at Stanford, and is a reality of campus life.
Many students start the year with relationships that
end when they return from Thanksgiving break.
Others find that after eight months, a time when
relationship experts say couples traditionally re
examine priorities, commitments at Stanford carry
more weight than the tethers of a long-distance
relationship.
Some students see these relationships as a con
trast to the quick, fragile friendships that the begin
ning of college offers. Others leave home and
everyone there, instead choosing to arrive at
Stanford open to new relationships and the oppor
tunities associated with them. Regardless, long-dis
tance relationships are a reality of life at Stanford
for a considerable part of the student body.
