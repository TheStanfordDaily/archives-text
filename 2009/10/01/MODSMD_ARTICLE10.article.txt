## EDITORIAL It's time to reexamine Full Moon on the Quad 
### 
This weekend, when the full moon rises
over Stanford, some members of the
Stanford Community will feel a bit nos
talgic for the event that occupied the quad
for decades. The administration's announce
ment that Full Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ)
would be canceled certainly disappointed
many members of the Stanford community
who anticipate the absurdity that is one of
Stanford's oldest traditions. But in canceling
FMOTQ for this year, Stanford might have
the opportunity to revamp the event in later
years to make it safer and classier than it has
been in years past.
Despite the disappointment that many
have over the cancellation, there certainly
are also reasons why the administration must
be breathing a little more easily. Absent this
year will be the students routinely hospital
ized as a result of overdrinking, the potential
sexual abuse cases that emerge from the
event and a reason for "creepers" from the
rest of the Bay Area to sneak in to ogle those
who participate. While many students appre
ciate the raucousness of the event, the costs
and liabilities for those students and staff in
volved in planning the event are always enor
mous.

Over the past decade, the administration
has taken a more prominent role in the or
ganization of FMOTQ, as the event is now
known just as well for its full lineup of stu
dent performances as it is for the Ã¼biquitous
lip-locking upon which the tradition is found
ed. These newer, more official aspects of Full
Moon are more recent than most students
would imagine, with some of the most extrav
agant additions such as the stage and body
numbing speaker systems being added just
four to five years ago. In reality, it would be
more valid to say the administration has not
cancelled Full Moon on the Quad, but has
simply decided not to oversee the event this
year.

The Editorial Board is not opposed to the
University's involvement in the event, as it
has taken on that involvement with the best
intentions. Since the administration has in
volved itself in FMOTQ, the event has be
come safer, with more police, sober monitors
and general services. The administration's
decision to cancel the event in light of the
swine flu scare has come as a disappointment
to many, but this is an opportunity for Stan
ford as a community to examine the tradition
and decide what form we want FMOTQ to
take in the future.

When the tradition began nearly a hun
dred years ago, it was a much classier, roman
tic event. It did not, for example, attract the
attention of middle-aged perverts from all
over the peninsula. The event especially in
its more recent manifestations has be
come a spectacle for those outside of the
Stanford community, no longer viewed as a
lasting and meaningful tradition, but a no
holds-barred display of everything that is
chaotic and dirty about college.

It is reasonable to assume that the volume
of kisses on campus will spike a bit on the full
moon even without the event. So, it remains
to be seen whether campus safety and hy
giene will actually benefit as a result of the
cancellation. Hopefully, without the mania of
the music and the mass of people on the
quad, things will be safer and more sanitary
than in the past.
Ironically, FMOTQ has been sponsored
by the sophomore class every year, which
means that next year the people who will pre
sumably be planning the event will have
never actually attended it before. Those stu
dents should know that Full Moon on the
Quad doesn't have to be what it has been in
the past. If and when Full Moon on the Quad
returns, it should be safe, it should be fun, and
it would not hurt any of us if it were a bit
classier.
