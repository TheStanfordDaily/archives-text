# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Toward a Unified Theory of Glenn Beck 
### Emily Hulme 
At the ultimate horizon of political dis
course, I'm nauseous. In the spirit of
reckless theorizing, I'm onto a specter
haunting America the self-described
rodeo clown political commentator and en
ergizer bunny of ignominious neo-quasipop
ulism that is Glenn Beck in all his transub
stantiated he-devilishness.

Perhaps the easiest explanation is that he
crawled out of the Euphrates yesterday and
dragged himself by his claws up to the Wash
ington Monument, where he picked up an ec
centric potpourri consisting of equal parts
conservative resentment, yellow journalistic
instinct and shameless showmanship. This,
however, is not exactly true. Nor is it true that
he was cooked up in a laboratory by Rupert
Murdoch and Karl Rove, deep underneath
the Fox News fortress. Indeed, once upon a
time, truth was stranger than fiction with
Beck working at CNN, where he ranted
about liberals stealing Christmas for a less
sympathetic audience. Proving a teleological
interpretation of history correct in a single
swoop, the universe corrected itself with his
transfer to Fox.

So what? In politics, he's nothing new
Breitbart, his frequent accomplice, is usually
saying the same things with more tact. As a
personality, Bill Maher is as annoying. He
shouldn't be anything special, but he is. His
show draws more viewers than all the other
cable news shows in his time slot combined;
he's this week's Time cover story; and the
rooster has crowed three times with him cart
ing off the scalps of Van Jones, ACORN and
that one guy at the NEA trying to get artists
to paint within the Democratic party line.
None of this, I think, bodes well for just about
anyone.

How does the government figure in the
imaginations of Americans? It is, in a word,
the DMV. A Kafkaesque paradigm of ineffi
ciency, here employees appear to synchro
nize smoking breaks to maximize wait times;
technology more primitive than that of most
sushi bars is the norm. These latest Beck vic
tims merely seem to be the unnecessary
proof that the government has no capacity
for oversight and cannot do anything "right."
Of course, Beck doesn't bring just any
scandals to light these are big government
liberals screwing up, and the subtext of "and
you want these people running your health
care?" is inevitable. This is ruinous for credi
bility on the left (paging Nancy Pelosi
might want to look into Rangel's taxes soon
er rather than later). The Obama administra
tion has dealt with each event with dignity,
and I suspect they realize this is the Keystone
Light of politics it fills the 24-hour news
cycle and keeps people happy, but drink too

much and you, too, shall be sickened. With
the Dom Perignon of nuclear Iran awaiting
you as the main course, there is no need to in
dulge prematurely.
Notice the three causes that are repre
sented in this veritable triptych: environmen
talism with green-jobs czar Jones, communi
ty organizing with ACORN and elite artists
with the NEA. Basically, it is one inner city
Planned Parenthood short of a Royal Pro
gressive Flush. Each has been subject to pre
vious assaults from the right, but here each
one was taken down by something more or
less incidental or irrelevant to any very real
reason conservatives criticized them. Did
anyone honestly think ACORN was engaged
in child prostitution? No, these scandals are
cheap shots, and conservatives recognize the
ethically dubious nature of "right deeds for
the wrong reasons."
He's getting away with it, and, ditching
any semblance of caution, I'll posit that this
not only makes sense, but couldn't be any
other way. One day, we'll have a color-by
numbers history of the Obama presidency,
but until then, I'll just freehand my own con
tours. A significant portion of the presented
platform was not about especially left-wing
ideas, but ideologically unspecific hope,
change, bipartisanship, etc. Whether or not
these are actualized, I think their flavor is de
cidedly associated with the current adminis
tration. What Glenn Beck has realized is that
not everyone is ready to hitch their future on
these abstract ideas, and even fewer are excit
ed about them when they become particular
ized into policy (witness the Great Health
Care Melee of 2009). By the law of conserva
tion of expectations, the grand push for hope
has evolved the anti-hope: fear. When Shep
ard Smith jokingly called Beck's studio the
"fear chamber," he retorted that he preferred
"doom room."
This is the reaction to Obama's action: he
brings the low brow to the president's Ivy
League, he's against both parties where the
president is bipartisan, he'll bring the angry
Dionysian tirade to counter the oft-quoted
Apollonian coolness of the president. He has
figured out how to occupy a vacant space that
only formed when the progressive pied piper
led away millions, and can claim this nega
tively defined domain with his own siren
song. Is this move feeding off the scandalous
scraps incidentally produced by actual ac
tion, which will always lead to excess, will al
ways leave something out?
Scraps aren't five-star meals, but he won't
starve either.
