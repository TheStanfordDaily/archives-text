# FLECHAS Y PEDRADAS
## A 						conversation around a table, vino casero and the future of the humanities 
### Patrick Kozey 
Everyone who goes to Stanford has
probably read Hamlet. People dislike
the eponymous protagonist because
they think he's a do-nothing failure. He can't
get his shit together, as a result of which he
dies, along with many others. But he is also
one of the truly great characters in literature,
the type that captivates 400 years after being
set down on the page. He confronts the diffi
culty of knowing that there is no absolute an
swer to any question, and though it paralyzes
him, anyone who has ever thought should be
able to see something of him or herself in
Hamlet.

Not all of us are paralyzed by complexity,
though, and that's why we are different.
Some see black and white, some see gray. A
few nights ago, I had a conversation that
made me remember why I hope there will al
ways be people who see gray, even if it terri
fies them to the point of total impotence.
Chances are, even if you haven't read
Hamlet, you've probably seen "Crash." The
2004 film won an Oscar for Best Picture,
over, among other nominees, Ang Lee's fine
film "Brokeback Mountain." A few nights
ago, I had a conversation about why I
thought this was a travesty. I was sitting with
three other American university students at a
table outside a restaurant in Barcelona. The
night was getting colder and the proof of the
alcohol in our glasses was going up accord
ingly. We sat on the terraza Spanish for
"outdoor seating area" and as the food

disappeared, we began to hold forth. "Broke
back Mountain" came up, someone mention
ing its power and impact, and I was reminded
of the feeling I had as a 15-year-old when it
was passed over for Best Picture because of
one too many gay cowboy jokes.
I was into my cups, as the saying goes, and
the anger I felt then came back to me. I blast
ed "Crash" for being nothing more than Los
Angeles engaging in a public display of intel
lectual masturbation. "Look how thought
provoking we are! We picked a movie that
crashes into racial tensions and exposes them
for all to see!" it seemed to scream to me at
the time. Though "Crash" is a fine film in
some regards, it is at best overwritten, and at
worst, the sort of movie that deploys "social
conscience" the way Michael Mann would
use machine gun fire: to distract the audience
from what is lacking.
At that point, the waiter brought us a
complimentary round of the house's concoc
tion, some ambiguous sweet wine that kept
us at the table, haciendo "la sobremesa"
their lovely custom of staying at a table for
hours after a meal to talk. My tablemates did
not seem to agree with me, and our conversa
tion evolved into a debate on the value of the
humanities as a whole. The girl diagonally
across from me, a psych major herself, gave a
good version of a speech I had heard many
times before. She spoke about how the liber
al arts encourage critical thinking and prob
lem solving techniques, etc. Everyone

seemed to be of a kind with her, though their
majors varied from the social sciences to
econ. I was the lone true liberal arts major, a
Spanish and Comp Lit student, but I took the
hardest line against the practicality of the hu
manities. The speech just given, I said, was
more an example of what is used to justify the
continued funding of humanities depart
ments than a reflection of any real inherent
practicality that the liberal arts might have.
Why? Was I playing devil's advocate?
Merely stumping for the enjoyment of it? No.
There is gray in everything, and I cannot help
but be aware how tenuous any direct link be
tween my reading of Shakespeare and my
eventual success in management consulting
would be. I read for the joy of the aesthetic
experience, I love Hamlet as a kindred spirit
who cannot help but see all sides of every
thing. It is the for the same reason that I like
"Brokeback Mountain" a great deal more
than "Crash" no matter how giant of a
horse's ass I sound like when I say so.
That night, in that place, I lined up oppo
site my own side and railed against it, but I
hope it holds the line. We must not shrink
from complexity. For that, the world needs
the sobremesa, and the sobremesa needs hu
manities majors.

Patrick was being too much of a prick to both
er with an extra witty line. Email your displeas
