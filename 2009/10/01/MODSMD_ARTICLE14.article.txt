## Stanford joins research news wire University teams up with other top institutions to share new discoveries 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
A group of top research universities, including
Stanford, is now publishing news of its research discov
eries on a widespread online wire service called Futurity.
Futurity, which carries research findings of 42 univer
sities nationwide, publishes them on the Web at futuri
ty.org, on social media Web sites and in partnership with
other news organizations. The site aggregates the latest
discoveries in health, technology, social science, environ
mental studies and more.

Recently, the wire service became directly fed to
Yahoo News, the most trafficked news Web site in the
world. Additionally, Futurity is currently experimenting
with social media sites such as You Tube, Facebook and
Twitter, to export research news to the widest audience
possible.

Lisa Lapin, assistant vice president of communica
tions at Stanford and one of three co-founders of
Futurity, said the primary goal is to educate the public
about the latest discoveries coming out of universities.
"The wealth of information, the wealth of discovery
being produced at North American research universities
is really exciting stuff," she said. "It's really progressive
research that will shape the future, which is why we call
the site Futurity."

Futurity started in response to changing news media,
said Mike Schoenfeld, vice president of public affairs
and government relations at Duke. Schoenfeld is one of
the original brains behind the project.
"As major newspaper media and television media
have cut back on their thoughtful coverage of science,
there was a void that we thought we could fill," he said.
Schoenfeld along with Lapin and Bill Murphy,
vice president of communications at the University of
Rochester presented the idea of a collaborative news
research wire service to other university communication
professionals in March. The positive response was big
ger than Lapin expected.

"Most people have thought it's just a fantastic idea,
and it seems relatively simple," Lapin said. "But univer
sities, as you know, can be very competitive. While we're

still all anxious to get our own attention, we're trying to
get collective attention and that's what's unique here."
Although the universities often compete for research
discoveries, they came together for Futurity to share the
knowledge they are accumulating.
"It's a fundamental desire; all of us have missions to
not just do research, but to educate and to share what we
learn, and it's as simple as that," Lapin added.
With their peers' approval, the site was launched
Sept. 15. According to Lapin, the idea has gained wide
spread support since the launch, as universities around
the world ask to be a part of it. European universities,
she said, are now discussing a similar project.
Participating universities are all members of the
Association of American Universities, a nonprofit
organization of the leading public and private research
universities.

While the criteria might change in the future, right
now there is enough work managing a collaborative
Web site from the existing 42 partners, Schoenfeld said.
Futurity is run by an independent editor, Jenny
Leonard, who takes submissions from all participating
campuses and updates the site to feature different sto
ries.

Leonard also is responsible for editing the submis
sions to ensure that they are not too promotional, Lapin
said.

The stories on the site, Lapin added, are written as
news stories so that the public can read research news
according to each reader's particular interest.
"We hope that people will find what's coming out of
the universities and have a broader and better under
standing of science, social sciences, humanities and what
the product of a university is: this incredible knowl
edge," Lapin said.

While the primary goal of Futurity is to get news of
research discoveries to the public, its creators note that
there are benefits to the universities as well. Lapin
hopes the site will generate public support for research.
The service does not solely share information
through its own site, but through other news sites and
social media sites as well. Lapin was responsible for
developing partnerships with Silicon Valley companies.
"We're doing this in a rapidly changing media envi
ronment," said Murphy, "so we have to keep experi
menting with things so that we stay current."
