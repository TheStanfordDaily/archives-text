## LOOKING TO REBOUND Cardinal trying to bounce back from first loss 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Some teams never experience loss. Some
teams never taste victory. And then there is
the Stanford women's field hockey team. The
Cardinal won its first eight games, setting a
school record for the best start in Stanford his
tory, before losing to California on Sunday af
ternoon.
After the 4-3 loss to the Golden Bears, No.
14 Stanford is attempting to move on and ac
knowledge the positives gained from the situ
ation.
"We have high expectations for each
other this season, so the loss definitely
stung," said head coach Lesley Irvine, "The

Cat game is always a close game because of
the school rivalry. The game highlighted
some areas we need to tweak, and we'll do
that, ultimately making us better moving for
ward. We are excited to continue on with a
successful season."

The athletes felt the pain of the loss, espe
cially after such a strong winning record, and
also because it was against Stanford's biggest
rival. Nevertheless, the women remain hope
ful and refuse to let one loss drag them into
disparity. Instead, they are ready to use this
as further motivation to play stronger and
harder.

"The loss against Cal was our wake up
call," said senior Nora Soza. "And I know
there will not be another game where we do
not come out hard and confident."

The Cardinal looks to refocus and try to get
back to its winning ways as Stanford heads to
the East Coast this weekend to play Temple,
LaSalle and Penn State.

"As we are beginning the second half of our

season, our renewed sense of determination
and relentlessness could not come at a better
time," claimed Soza.
Traveling to the East Coast provides Stan

ford's West Coast field hockey program the
opportunity to assert itself on a national scale.
Field hockey is much more prevalent and
well-known on the East Coast, but Stanford
hopes to show that the rest of the country
boasts strong programs as well.
"Cal was just a small bump in the road, and
we're going to be working even harder now,
focusing on ourselves to get ready for our up
coming games back east," said senior Rachel
Bush.

"We're going to continue moving forward
and working hard regardless of our record,"
said senior Midori Uehara. "That's how we've
succeeded and will continue to succeed."

Nationally ranked and possessing a reputa
tion as a powerful team with an incredibly
stingy defense, the Cardinal women hope to
secure some wins and push full throttle into
the second half of the season.
