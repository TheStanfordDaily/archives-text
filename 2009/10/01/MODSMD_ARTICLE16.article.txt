# RUSHING MACHINE

### CHRISTIAN NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
In the words of senior offensive
tackle Chris Marinelli,"He's a helluva
back."

He's talking, of course, about sen
ior running back Toby Gerhart.
In last Saturday's win over No. 24
Washington, Gerhart rushed for a ca
reer-high 200 yards, the most by any
Cardinal in 21 years and the seventh
best rushing performance in school
history. In just four games this season,
he has amassed 516 rushing yards and
five touchdowns, an average of 129.0
yards per game. The average places
him first in the Pac-10 Conference
and third nationally in rushing yards
per game.

Gerhart's career statistics have
placed him in the top five on just
about every Stanford rushing record
list. He holds the single-season
records for rushing yards and 100-
yard games, with 1,136 and eight, re
spectively. His career rushing total of
2,167 yards places him sixth, only
eight yards behind the fifth-place
Glyn Milburn. With 21 career rushing
touchdowns, he's tied with Mike
Mitchell; just two more will move him
to fourth and three more will move
him to third. He comes in second on
the records list for career 100-yard
games, with 12.
Record setting isn't exactly new
for the seasoned back, who set a num
ber of records at Norco High School
in Norco, Calif. As a senior, he set the
Norco High School record for rushing

yards in a single game
and single season. He
amassed 9,662 yards over
his high school career, set
ting a new California
record for career rushing
yards, and placing him
third on the national
list.
"That guy's crazy,"
Marinelli said. "He's
so talented, so physi
cal, so fast. He just gets

through the line. We
don't like to be spectators, but he
just gets going and we can't keep
up with him."
Head coach Jim Harbaugh is
not shy about praising his star, ei
ther. "There's no doubt that Toby
is a shining star on the team. As a I
player, he is good, if not the best \
in the country," he said at Tues-
day's media day.
Even UCLA head coach Rick
Neuheisel agrees. "[Gerhart] is
maybe as good as there is in the
country," he told The Long Beach
Press-Telegram. "He's a different
kind of running back. He's not going
to try to make you miss as many times
as some as some of the elusive guys
do. He's as powerful and tough to
bring down as any back I've seen in
college football for some time."
"You've got to bring people at
him," said UCLA defensive coordina
tor Chuck Bullough. "You don't want
to let him move forward. The more
guys you bring at him, the better
chance you have of driving him back.
