## Trying to maintain perfection Card's unbeaten record at stake against Santa Clara 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford women's soccer team
faces its final and perhaps toughest
test of the non-conference season tonight as
it heads to Santa Clara for the annual South
Bay derby.
Stanford has been perfect so far this year,
at least record-wise: The team has started out
10-0-0. However, while the team has had its
share of blowouts, not every match has been
easy. Just this past weekend, the team strug
gled to assert itself over Saint Mary's, eventu
ally grinding out a 1-0 win. Taking nothing
away from Saint Mary's, the Gaels simply do
not have the talent of other teams that Stan
ford will have to go through in its quest for
the Pac-10 Conference and national champi
onships, and the Card will be hoping for a big
improvement.

"We didn't come out with the proper
mentality [in the Saint Mary's game]," said
head coach Paul Ratcliffe, "We didn't go out
there to fight; we went out just to kind of get
through a game. The second half we played
very well, but the first half we were just too
flat, nonchalant."

Santa Clara is also coming off a disap
pointing result, losing 2-0 at home to South
ern California, despite outshooting the Tro
jans 20-8. Overall, though, the 2009 season
has been a resurgent one for the Bron
cos. The team's record stands at 8-3-0
right now, whereas last year it ended
with a 4-12-4 record.

The change in fortunes is due to a
few factors, most notably players re
turning from injury and a talented
group of new freshmen. In fact, Santa
Clara's starting lineup against USC is
almost completely different from its
starting 11 in last year's Stanford vs.
Santa Clara match, which the Cardinal
dominated en route to a 5-0 victory at
Buck Shaw Stadium.

The Broncos will be a very differ
ent and by the looks of things, bet
ter team this time around. As many
as four freshmen (from one of the na
tion's top recruiting classes) could
start for SCU tomorrow, and key play
ers like Amanda Poach and Jordan
Angeli are back after missing last year
with injuries. These new and old faces
have helped propel Santa Clara to the
No. 11 ranking in the nation, and the
Card knows that it will have to put last
year's blowout out of its mind.
"Santa Clara is a strong team.
They're having a good season," Rat
cliffe said. "It's going to be a tough
game, and we're going to have to play
our best to beat them."

"Their team has changed a lot,"
said junior forward Christen Press,

who scored the lone goal against Saint
Mary's. "They're going to be a lot bet
ter of a team this year than they were
last year. We know that we have to
take this as a completely new team.
They're going to be probably the best
team we've faced this season, so we
just have to come mentally and physi
cally prepared."
Of course, this Stanford team isn't
exactly the same as last year's squad ei
ther. Gone is the dominating central
defender partnership of Marisa Abegg
and Allison Falk,both graduates in the
Class of 2009. However, Stanford has
also brought in a highly-decorated re
cruiting class.

Three freshmen fullback
Rachel Quon, center back Alina Gari
ciamendez and midfielder Mariah

Nogueira have become regular
starters, and forward Courtney Verloo
has featured in every match. That is
perhaps the scariest thing about this
Stanford team the players still
haven't completely gelled, yet the
team has a 100 percent record.
One of the other scary things about
the Cardinal is how deep it is, and the
team will need that depth tomorrow
night after receiving a red card on
Sunday, sophomore midfielder/full
back Cami Levin is suspended for the
Santa Clara game. Ratcliffe expects
Quon missing the past week due to
family reasons to reclaim her right
back role from Levin, and look for
midfielders Kristin Stannard and
Hillary Heath to possibly see in
creased roles in the midfield with
Levin's absence.

No matter what the lineup is, the
Cardinal players know how important
a victory would be not only would it
tie this year's team with the 1991 team
for the best start in school history, but
it would also be a huge confidence
boost heading into the Pac-10 season.
"It's definitely a big momentum
game," Press said. "We want to go into
the Pac 10 feeling like we are making
history at Stanford. We want to come
out with a win, and it'll be the biggest
win of our season, so it'll be a great way
to [go into] the Pac-10 season."
Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. at
Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium.

haven't completely gelled, yet the
team has a 100 percent record.
One of the other scary things about
the Cardinal is how deep it is, and the
team will need that depth tomorrow
night after receiving a red card on
Sunday, sophomore midfielder/full
back Cami Levin is suspended for the
Santa Clara game. Ratcliffe expects
Quon missing the past week due to
family reasons to reclaim her right
back role from Levin, and look for
midfielders Kristin Stannard and
Hillary Heath to possibly see in
creased roles in the midfield with
Levin's absence.

No matter what the lineup is, the
Cardinal players know how important
a victory would be not only would it
tie this year's team with the 1991 team
for the best start in school history, but
it would also be a huge confidence
boost heading into the Pac-10 season.
"It's definitely a big momentum
game," Press said. "We want to go into
the Pac 10 feeling like we are making
history at Stanford. We want to come
out with a win, and it'll be the biggest
win of our season, so it'll be a great way
to [go into] the Pac-10 season."
Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. at
Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium.
