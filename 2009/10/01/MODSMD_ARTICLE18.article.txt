## My shining moment... for Twitter 
### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
The thin cardboard of the press
pass does not convey its magic. Twisted
around my shorts' belt loop, this three
inch-wide colorful square carries me
into Stanford Stadium without a card
swipe, a ticket or a 3,000-person,
sweaty, elbowing line. I walk down the
bleacher stairs, down, down, past
where I would normally take a seat,
down to the gate by the field. The field
attendant glances at my pass and
opens the gate without a word, and for
a second I feel like Ray Liotta in
"Goodfellas." Just a little bit.
I sit down at a table on the field and
pull out my laptop. I am there on a mis
sion —to help integrate the next
phase of social media into television
and usher in an age of democratized
reporting, a technological Age of
Aquarius. In other words, I am there to
manage Samantha Steele's Twitter ac
count.

Unless you are both college-sports
obsessed and male, you probably don't
know that Samantha Steele is Fox Col
lege Sports' sidelines reporter, as well
as a "babe" (in the words of one enthu
siastic Daily sports editor). I got to
meet her, talk with her and watch her
get some non-life-threatening injuries.
But more on that later.

I interned with Fox College Sports
for Saturday's filming of the Universi
ty of Washington game. On Friday, I
joined the crew of Samantha Steele,
booth reporter Yogi Roth, FCS vice
president Max Casanova and camera
man Jeff Wright, most of whom had
flown in from Los Angeles at 5 a.m.
They started off by interviewing
running back Toby Gerhart and quar
terback Andrew Luck. I helped hook
up microphones and told them how to
pronounce "Arrillaga" when they in
troduced the facilities pretty much
the only word you need to know when
you're getting around Stanford's ath
letic arenas.

Casanova had asked me about
what pre-game activities would take
place Friday around campus and I
hated to tell them how little there was.
Not that Stanford doesn't have school
spirit (I'm looking at you, Ben Laufer),
but asking for wholesome football-re
lated activities a full 30 hours before
game time does seem a little unrealis
tic on this campus. Luckily, the activi
ties fair took place Friday in White
Plaza, so the camera got a full dose of
Stanford craziness. I took FCS up Palm
Drive for some "campus beauty shots,"
explained the difference between
Memorial Church and Hoover Tower,
and showed off the way Stanford culti
vates enough palm trees to shade a
small nation.

Finally, when the beauty had be
come obscured by the glimmering heat
waves and sweat dripping through
everyone's shirts, we walked to the
football stadium. The plan was for
Samantha and Yogi to act out an im
pressive play by Washington in the
Huskies' last game, as much as it ran
kled me to hear them laud the Huskies
on our field.

Samantha, at this point overheating
in a flannel shirt and jeans, gave me her
Blackberry to take action shots that
she could upload to Twitter. For all
those curious, she can really throw a
football. She and Yogi ran through the
play several times, culminating in a
chest bump after each successful catch.
But on the last take, an over-enthusias
tic bump sent Samantha flying through
the air in away that could not possibly
end well.

Everyone yelled, and then laughed,
and then felt bad when Samantha's vi
sion didn't work correctly through the
next hour. Diagnosis: concussion. To
quote her own Twitter, on which I am
now an expert: "Concussion=Bad.
Video of my concussion=Hilarious.
Doc says I shouldn't do any 'heavy
thinking' for a week. Shouldn't be a
problem." (Sep 25,8:26 PM).
On Friday, I prepped a humble mi
crophone acceptance speech in case
Samantha's concussion overtook her
during the game, but of course I was
content to rest with my free pass at the
best vantage point in the stadium.
My official job was to monitor peo
ple's comments to Sam on Twitter
(@SamOnFCS) and let her know if
anyone asked a question or had a sug
gestion, so she could work it into her
broadcast in real time. Besides some
innocuous remarks about looking for
ward to the game, I did not have much
to work with at first.

But then, in a heroic bit of Twitter
monitoring, I noticed an influx of com
ments such as "@SamOnFCS:TeII the
morons in the booth that the Universi
ty of Washington is in Seattle not
Bellevue before they keep embarrass
ing themselves."
So, I did, and Sam did, and the day
was saved.

Besides the Twitter, I also threw
some free T-shirts and cinch packs up

into the crowd, which, let me tell you,
is a power trip like nothing else.
After the game, I retreated from
the spotlight and walked to the Fox
truck to pick up my "free swag." I may
have sold out to Rupert Murdoch, but
in exchange for my clich?d elitist liber
al ideals, I got two Fox College Sports
T-shirts, a Fox College Sports cinch
pack, two FCS bumper stickers and six
FCS bottle openers. Not too shabby. A
walking product placement, I then re
treated back into Stanford life.

to work with at first.

But then, in a heroic bit of Twitter
monitoring, I noticed an influx of com
ments such as "@SamOnFCS:TeII the
morons in the booth that the Universi
ty of Washington is in Seattle not
Bellevue before they keep embarrass
ing themselves."
So, I did, and Sam did, and the day
was saved.

Besides the Twitter, I also threw
some free T-shirts and cinch packs up

into the crowd, which, let me tell you,
is a power trip like nothing else.
After the game, I retreated from
the spotlight and walked to the Fox
truck to pick up my "free swag." I may
have sold out to Rupert Murdoch, but
in exchange for my clich?d elitist liber
al ideals, I got two Fox College Sports
T-shirts, a Fox College Sports cinch
pack, two FCS bumper stickers and six
FCS bottle openers. Not too shabby. A
walking product placement, I then re
treated back into Stanford life.
