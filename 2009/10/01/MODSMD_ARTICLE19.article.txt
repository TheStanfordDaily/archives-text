# Hockey interest has been put on ice
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
Stanford University is pretty
crazy about sports. From our
streak of years with a nation
al championship to the fans
that pack the Red Zone
every Saturday, sports passion is alive
and well among Stanford students.
However, one sport is sadly neglected
among the student population: ice
hockey. Stanford doesn't field a varsi
ty ice hockey team, and our club team
plays off campus in Redwood City,
making it difficult for Stanford stu
dents to attend the games. Indeed,
some students have never even seen a
game of hockey, much less followed
the sport to any degree.
This tendency among students
mirrors a national trend of declining
interest in ice hockey. The TV ratings
of the NHL and attendance at its
arenas have been declining, espe
cially in warmer climates (like Cali
fornia) that have not traditionally
been hotbeds of hockey. The sport
has been increasingly dominated in
the U.S. by the Northeast and the
northern Midwest, and by Canadian
and European players. Currently,
there are no Division I teams on the
West Coast; the vast majority of
teams are concentrated in the
Northeast and in Michigan, Wiscon
sin and Minnesota.
This deterioration of interest in
hockey is even more disgraceful con
sidering the rich history that hockey
has in the U.S. While the sport's ori
gins lie in Canada, ice hockey has ex
isted in America since the late 19th
century, and the NHL expanded into
the U.S. in 1924. Four of the NHL's
"Original Six" teams are from the
U.S.: the New York Rangers, the
Boston Bruins, the Chicago Black
hawks and the Detroit Red Wings
(the other two being the Montreal
Canadiens and the Toronto Maple
Leafs).
Hockey also provided one of
America's greatest triumphs, the
Miracle on Ice at the 1980 Winter
Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y. An
American team made up of college
players beat the Soviet Union's
feared team in the semifinals, electri
fying the entire country.
The lack of hockey acumen
among Bay Area Californians is also
inexcusable considering that our
local NHL team, the San Jose Sharks,
won the President's Cup last season,

awarded to the team that has the best
regular season record in the league.
While the team habitually flames out
in the early rounds of the playoffs, its
run of impressive seasons has done
nothing to increase hockey fandom
in the area.

All of these facts beg the ques
tion: Why isn't there any interest in
hockey at Stanford or indeed in
much of America today? The sim
ple answer is that hockey has never
gained much traction in warmer cli
mates; after all, the game is played on
a big sheet of ice.

There are other reasons for hock
ey's irrelevancy, which we can see
when we compare hockey and the
NHL to the three other major team
sports in American life: football, bas
ketball and baseball. Unlike football
and basketball, two of the more pop
ular sports, hockey is fairly low-scor
ing; teams often score only twice or
three times a game, and sometimes
even less than that. While hockey is
fast-paced and packed with action,
its low-scoring nature simply does
not endear it to fans. Football and
basketball are more popular, and
baseball ranks above hockey due to
its longer tradition in American cul
ture (although interest in baseball is
also waning).

The NHL has also been unable to
market itself and its stars as well as
the other pro leagues; while the other
sports have a number of nationally
recognized stars, the NHL only has
two bona fide nationwide superstars,
Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Pen
guins and Alexander Ovechkin of
the Washington Capitals (for the
record, these players are Canadian
and Russian, respectively).

So, how can hockey remake its
image and make itself more relevant,
especially here at Stanford?
Well, for starters, the NHL needs
to market its stars more aggressively,
following the path set by the NFL
and NBA. If you asked most Stan
ford students who the Sharks' most
prominent player is, you would most
ly draw blank stares; however, most
could easily name at least two 49ers
and Raiders players.
While it is commercially difficult,
the league needs to improve its visi
bility by negotiating contracts to get
games on national television more
often. This year, games three and
four of the Stanley Cup Finals were
shown only on Versus, a premium
cable channel, whereas every game
of the World Series was broadcast
nationally on Fox. There are also
multiple ways franchises with weak
fan bases could expand, including
promotions for low-cost tickets and
partnerships with local organiza
tions.

On the ice, the NHL can't really
do much to align the sport with the
high-scoring tastes of the average
American sports fan. The game has
become faster-paced and more excit
ing in recent years, and by emphasiz
ing these elements of hockey, fans
can be drawn to the sport. Fighting,
where burly "enforcers" literally en
gage in fistfights on the ice after
plays, is a practice that should be
banned, as it makes hockey seem like
a brutish sport instead of one based
on speed and skill.
However, what's most important
is for USA Hockey to do more to
promote youth involvement in
hockey across the country. If more
people become involved in hockey,
we will get both a better talent pool
of American players and increased
interest in all levels of hockey in our
country. If we had more hockey tal
ent, the sport could expand into
places like Stanford and other
schools on the West Coast. Ice hock
ey is a great sport, and it would be a
shame if it permanently disap
peared from the American con
sciousness.

Miracle on Ice at the 1980 Winter
Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y. An
American team made up of college
players beat the Soviet Union's
feared team in the semifinals, electri
fying the entire country.
The lack of hockey acumen
among Bay Area Californians is also
inexcusable considering that our
local NHL team, the San Jose Sharks,
won the President's Cup last season,

awarded to the team that has the best
regular season record in the league.
While the team habitually flames out
in the early rounds of the playoffs, its
run of impressive seasons has done
nothing to increase hockey fandom
in the area.

All of these facts beg the ques
tion: Why isn't there any interest in
hockey at Stanford or indeed in
much of America today? The sim
ple answer is that hockey has never
gained much traction in warmer cli
mates; after all, the game is played on
a big sheet of ice.

There are other reasons for hock
ey's irrelevancy, which we can see
when we compare hockey and the
NHL to the three other major team
sports in American life: football, bas
ketball and baseball. Unlike football
and basketball, two of the more pop
ular sports, hockey is fairly low-scor
ing; teams often score only twice or
three times a game, and sometimes
even less than that. While hockey is
fast-paced and packed with action,
its low-scoring nature simply does
not endear it to fans. Football and
basketball are more popular, and
baseball ranks above hockey due to
its longer tradition in American cul
ture (although interest in baseball is
also waning).

The NHL has also been unable to
market itself and its stars as well as
the other pro leagues; while the other
sports have a number of nationally
recognized stars, the NHL only has
two bona fide nationwide superstars,
Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Pen
guins and Alexander Ovechkin of
the Washington Capitals (for the
record, these players are Canadian
and Russian, respectively).

So, how can hockey remake its
image and make itself more relevant,
especially here at Stanford?
Well, for starters, the NHL needs
to market its stars more aggressively,
following the path set by the NFL
and NBA. If you asked most Stan
ford students who the Sharks' most
prominent player is, you would most
ly draw blank stares; however, most
could easily name at least two 49ers
and Raiders players.
While it is commercially difficult,
the league needs to improve its visi
bility by negotiating contracts to get
games on national television more
often. This year, games three and
four of the Stanley Cup Finals were
shown only on Versus, a premium
cable channel, whereas every game
of the World Series was broadcast
nationally on Fox. There are also
multiple ways franchises with weak
fan bases could expand, including
promotions for low-cost tickets and
partnerships with local organiza
tions.

On the ice, the NHL can't really
do much to align the sport with the
high-scoring tastes of the average
American sports fan. The game has
become faster-paced and more excit
ing in recent years, and by emphasiz
ing these elements of hockey, fans
can be drawn to the sport. Fighting,
where burly "enforcers" literally en
gage in fistfights on the ice after
plays, is a practice that should be
banned, as it makes hockey seem like
a brutish sport instead of one based
on speed and skill.
However, what's most important
is for USA Hockey to do more to
promote youth involvement in
hockey across the country. If more
people become involved in hockey,
we will get both a better talent pool
of American players and increased
interest in all levels of hockey in our
country. If we had more hockey tal
ent, the sport could expand into
places like Stanford and other
schools on the West Coast. Ice hock
ey is a great sport, and it would be a
shame if it permanently disap
peared from the American con
sciousness.
