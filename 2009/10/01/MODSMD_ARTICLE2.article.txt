# STUDENT GROUPS
## Sprig seeks to spread invention "Switchscape" device encourages conservation 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
A new group wants students to think
twice before leaving the lights on this
fall.

Sprig's goal is to encourage a more
sustainable Stanford through the use of
resource-monitoring devices. The group
is an expanded version of PIugVIEW, a
group created last year by students in
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Banny
Banerjee's freshman introductory semi
nar, "Think Like a Designer," offered
last fall.

Last spring, PIugVIEW created a
device called "switchscape" that uses a
meter to monitor electricity usage via
images on light switches.

In the pictures on the light switch, a
plant looks more sickly and a sun
becomes dim if excess energy is used.
The device was named for its combina
tion of a light switch and a landscape.
The metering device behind the
switchscape was installed on the third
floor of Donner over a period of three
months. Sprig has plans to install the
visual element soon and push the device
further across campus.

"One of our primary goals for this
quarter is to expand that into a dorm
wide system and roll out a much more
robust version of the online dashboard
Symbiosys," said Sprig founding member
Matthew Crowley 'l2.

The dashboard measures the amount
of energy being used by students and dis
plays it online. Using colored bars rang
ing from green to red, it indicates how
much energy each dorm room in Donner
has conserved. Students, then, can go
online and monitor their own consump
tion.

According to club member Karen
Hauser 'l2, the group is presently work
ing to "display the information [online]
in away that's more effective," using
"visual metaphors" similar to the plant
and sun. Another switchscape design dis
plays colored balloons and a sun.
"Most people aren't even knowingly
perpetrating these acts of wasteful con
sumption," Crowley said. "They just
don't know what their effects are.

"Our network of systems is being
designed to make it both simple to view
your usage as well as put it in a language
that you understand, be it a visual
metaphor or a mathematical conver
sion," he added.

Although still awaiting ASSU club
recognition, Crowley said the group is
