# Medical researchers awarded
## Thirteen scientists receive funding from leading government agency 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH)
last week recognized 13 scientists in Stanford
University's School of Medicine and School
of Engineering for research proposals that
embodied risk and innovation. Overall, the
NIH granted an estimated $348 million to its
115 award winners.

The NIH, which falls under the purview of

the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, is widely regarded as the nation's

leading government agency for sponsoring
medical research.

This year, the organization conferred 42
Transformative ROl Awards for exceptional
ly novel and high-risk research projects, 18
Director's Pioneer Awards for individual sci
entists whose ideas may potentially advance
biomedical or behavioral research and 55
New Innovator Awards for promising investi
gators with creative research ideas. Over the
next five years, each award recipient will

receive $3.5 million, $2.5 million and $1.5 mil
lion, respectively.

The recipients of the awards represent
both a cross-section of Stanford's vibrant
medical research community and a tour of
the high-risk frontiers of its ongoing projects.

New Innovators Award

Sarah Heilshorn, assistant professor of
materials science and engineering, plans to
use her NIH funding to engineer three
dimensional gel cultures to study stem cell
development.

"We can grow the neural stem cells in
these engineered environments to study how

they respond to signals that they receive,"
Heilshorn said. She hopes her research will
help generate new treatments for victims of
stroke and other trauma.

Her fellow researcher, Dr. Euan Ashley,
assistant professor of cardiovascular medi
cine, also hopes his findings will result in ben
eficial medical treatments.

Ashley's clinical specialty and research
project focus on hypertrophic cardiomyopa-
thy, a genetic disease characterized
by an abnormal thickening of the
heart muscle. In the past, treatment
for this condition has ranged from
alcohol injections to open-heart sur
gery to various medications.
"The basis of my proposal was
that we can do better, and that
maybe if we go after the root cause
of the condition, then we can have
more therapeutic benefits than these
current approaches," Ashley
explained.
He hopes his lab will find away to
use RNA to silence the genetic
mutation that causes hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. "We might be able
to silence the mutation, and the
heart might be able to go back to
normal."

Commenting on the progress of
his research, Ashley stated, "We
[want to] move as fast as we can
from doing cell experiments, to small
animal experiments, to large animal

experiments and then a clinical trial.
It would be very nice if we could get
to the point of treating a patient."
Assistant professor of microbiol
ogy Justin Sonnenburg plans to
study changes in the composition of
the digestive tract's microbial com
munities. These alterations are often
linked with obesity, inflammatory
bowel disease, irritable bowel syn
drome and various other health
problems. Sonnenburg believes
studying these alterations will con
tribute new insights to pathology.
"The project is really to identify
the tools that will allow us to per
form these experiments in mouse
models with the idea that they will
lend insight into the microbiota's
contribution to diseases,"
Sonnenburg said.
"The tools that we're trying to
identify are small molecules," he
explained further. "We're screening
a huge library 120,000 small mol
ecules with help of the High-
Throughput Bioscience Center."
A theoretical physicist by train
ing, K.C. Huang says he is "relatively
new to biology."
Huang, an assistant professor of
bioengineering, plans to use his NIH
funding to study the role of cell
shape in complex processes. He
intends to use bacteria to explore
this matter. His two-part research
project aims to engineer particular
cell shapes using cytoskeletal ele
ments and to build a cell from the
ground up using scaffold proteins.
"Our goal is to move beyond the
biochemistry and genetics of cells
shape determination and come up
with both models and experimental
tools, such that we can ask with
testable hypotheses why cells take

the shape that they do, and what
happens when they don't," Huang
said.
Adding even more diversity to
these research projects is Anna
Penn's analysis of the placenta's role
in fetal brain development. Penn, an
assistant professor of neonatal and
developmental medicine, intends to
develop mouse models to investigate
the role of different hormones on
fetal development.
"My interest is really split
between wanting to understand the
basic biology because very little is
understood about the placenta in
any modern molecular sense, and
wanting to translate it into human
medical care as quickly as possible,"
Penn stated. "As we begin to under
stand these hormones in mice, the
important question will be: Do these
hormones behave the same way in
humans?"

For Penn and her fellow NIH
honorees, the $1.5 million funding
goes a long way. Most of the projects
would not have received traditional
grants because they are high-risk
and may not turn out to be success
ful.

"We even have to explain why we
probably wouldn't get funding sup
port like a traditional grant propos
al," Heilshorn said of the NIH
Award application process.
"As a junior faculty member, [l]
spend a lot of time writing grant pro
posals, and getting this big award will
really free me up to spend more time
focusing on my science," Heilshorn
added. "It's what I really love to do."

Director's Pioneer Award

Recipients of the NIH Pioneer
Award were required to submit a

short research proposal and travel to
the NIH campus in Bethesda, Md.
for interviews and presentations.

One of these recipients,
associate professor of electri- ,/m
cal engineering Krishna
Shenoy, aims to design
"brain-machine inter
faces" that
can com- ~jj
municate
neural Mflß I J '
signals to |
prosthet
ics. He hopes his research will bene
fit paralyzed patients and
amputees.
In order to accomplish this
goal, Shenoy will develop "an ,
animal model of freely moving
humans," using monkeys. As
part of his project, Shenoy first
will "develop the wireless technolo
gy to transmit neural signals from
the brain."
He further plans to use high-defi
nition cameras to record the
behavior of monkeys while
analyzing these transmitted
neural signals.
In the realm of bioengi
neering, Markus Covert
proposed "to make a com
puter model of all the genes in
a cell," using yeast as his model
organism. Covert, an assistant
professor of bioengineering,
expects his research on yeast
to translate to humans and
other mammals as well. In
particular, he will investigate J
the relationship between dietary 1
restrictions and longevity.
Covert also hopes to look at the
interaction between genes.

"Things like cancer or infection
these things don't depend on one
gene," Covert said. "They depend on
the interactions of hundreds or even
thousands of factors. It's really all
that interaction that makes the dis
ease, and that's what makes treating
those diseases so difficult."

The objective of endocrinology
Prof. Ajay Chawla's research is to
explore tissue regeneration in
mammals. He plans to exam
ine mice first and then
assess whether his find
ings are applicable for
iftfr humans as well.

under-
I I stand

\ tion in young
\ individuals or
young mice in this
case then we might
be able to exploit
these known trig
4rV> gers to potentially
regenerate tissues in
the setting of dis
ease or old age,"
Chawla said. "It
I has pretty
i straightforward
therapeutic impli
cations for
humans."
Chang-Zheng
Chen, assistant professor
of microbiology and
immunology, will study
the role of microßNAs
on the regulation of
gene expression. He
f hopes to learn about the
mechanisms that underlie the
biological activity of

microßNA.
Commenting on
his research

topic, Chen said, "It may have some
important implication in future ... I
think it is a really exciting opportunity.
"The importance of these
[microßNAs] has become very quite

apparent in recent years," he added.

Transformative ROl Award

Endocrinology Prof. Andrew
Hoffman hopes to study the role of
gene deletion and chromosome inter
action on various diseases.
"The interactions across chromo
somes can affect the way genes act,"
Hoffman said. "Our hypothesis was
that we might be able to explain some
the physical manifestations of genetic
diseases that are caused by chromo
some deletions... It's not just that a
certain gene has been deleted, but that
that gene which was deleted normally
interacted with another gene some
where else."

Calvin Kuo, associate professor of
hematology, developed a research
project that deals with intestinal cul
ture. His lab is working to grow human
intestines, a challenge that has eluded
scientists in the past.
"We hope to establish conditions
for robust propagation of human
intestines, as well as to model intestin
al diseases in the primary cultures,"
Kuo said. "Also, possibly, [we want] to
establish some systems using these cul
tures for drug screening."
Julie Parsonnet, professor of infec
tious diseases, plans to use her
Transformative ROl grant to analyze
various micro-organisms that infect
people, and Joseph Wu, professor of
medicine and radiology, plans to use
his grant to find ways to prevent the
human body from rejecting embryon
ic stem cells.

For these researchers, NIH award
money enables risky, high-yield
research that might not have been
funded otherwise. Hoffman said the
funding was a welcome change.

"I've been at Stanford now 27
years, since 1982," Hoffman remarked.
"I have to say the last few years have
been the most difficult to get grants in
all that time."

both a cross-section of Stanford's vibrant
medical research community and a tour of
the high-risk frontiers of its ongoing projects.

New Innovators Award

Sarah Heilshorn, assistant professor of
materials science and engineering, plans to
use her NIH funding to engineer three
dimensional gel cultures to study stem cell
development.

"We can grow the neural stem cells in
these engineered environments to study how

they respond to signals that they receive,"
Heilshorn said. She hopes her research will
help generate new treatments for victims of
stroke and other trauma.

Her fellow researcher, Dr. Euan Ashley,
assistant professor of cardiovascular medi
cine, also hopes his findings will result in ben
eficial medical treatments.

Ashley's clinical specialty and research
project focus on hypertrophic cardiomyopa-
thy, a genetic disease characterized
by an abnormal thickening of the
heart muscle. In the past, treatment
for this condition has ranged from
alcohol injections to open-heart sur
gery to various medications.
"The basis of my proposal was
that we can do better, and that
maybe if we go after the root cause
of the condition, then we can have
more therapeutic benefits than these
current approaches," Ashley
explained.
He hopes his lab will find away to
use RNA to silence the genetic
mutation that causes hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. "We might be able
to silence the mutation, and the
heart might be able to go back to
normal."

Commenting on the progress of
his research, Ashley stated, "We
[want to] move as fast as we can
from doing cell experiments, to small
animal experiments, to large animal

experiments and then a clinical trial.
It would be very nice if we could get
to the point of treating a patient."
Assistant professor of microbiol
ogy Justin Sonnenburg plans to
study changes in the composition of
the digestive tract's microbial com
munities. These alterations are often
linked with obesity, inflammatory
bowel disease, irritable bowel syn
drome and various other health
problems. Sonnenburg believes
studying these alterations will con
tribute new insights to pathology.
"The project is really to identify
the tools that will allow us to per
form these experiments in mouse
models with the idea that they will
lend insight into the microbiota's
contribution to diseases,"
Sonnenburg said.
"The tools that we're trying to
identify are small molecules," he
explained further. "We're screening
a huge library 120,000 small mol
ecules with help of the High-
Throughput Bioscience Center."
A theoretical physicist by train
ing, K.C. Huang says he is "relatively
new to biology."
Huang, an assistant professor of
bioengineering, plans to use his NIH
funding to study the role of cell
shape in complex processes. He
intends to use bacteria to explore
this matter. His two-part research
project aims to engineer particular
cell shapes using cytoskeletal ele
ments and to build a cell from the
ground up using scaffold proteins.
"Our goal is to move beyond the
biochemistry and genetics of cells
shape determination and come up
with both models and experimental
tools, such that we can ask with
testable hypotheses why cells take

the shape that they do, and what
happens when they don't," Huang
said.
Adding even more diversity to
these research projects is Anna
Penn's analysis of the placenta's role
in fetal brain development. Penn, an
assistant professor of neonatal and
developmental medicine, intends to
develop mouse models to investigate
the role of different hormones on
fetal development.
"My interest is really split
between wanting to understand the
basic biology because very little is
understood about the placenta in
any modern molecular sense, and
wanting to translate it into human
medical care as quickly as possible,"
Penn stated. "As we begin to under
stand these hormones in mice, the
important question will be: Do these
hormones behave the same way in
humans?"

For Penn and her fellow NIH
honorees, the $1.5 million funding
goes a long way. Most of the projects
would not have received traditional
grants because they are high-risk
and may not turn out to be success
ful.

"We even have to explain why we
probably wouldn't get funding sup
port like a traditional grant propos
al," Heilshorn said of the NIH
Award application process.
"As a junior faculty member, [l]
spend a lot of time writing grant pro
posals, and getting this big award will
really free me up to spend more time
focusing on my science," Heilshorn
added. "It's what I really love to do."

Director's Pioneer Award

Recipients of the NIH Pioneer
Award were required to submit a

short research proposal and travel to
the NIH campus in Bethesda, Md.
for interviews and presentations.

One of these recipients,
associate professor of electri- ,/m
cal engineering Krishna
Shenoy, aims to design
"brain-machine inter
faces" that
can com- ~jj
municate
neural Mflß I J '
signals to |
prosthet
ics. He hopes his research will bene
fit paralyzed patients and
amputees.
In order to accomplish this
goal, Shenoy will develop "an ,
animal model of freely moving
humans," using monkeys. As
part of his project, Shenoy first
will "develop the wireless technolo
gy to transmit neural signals from
the brain."
He further plans to use high-defi
nition cameras to record the
behavior of monkeys while
analyzing these transmitted
neural signals.
In the realm of bioengi
neering, Markus Covert
proposed "to make a com
puter model of all the genes in
a cell," using yeast as his model
organism. Covert, an assistant
professor of bioengineering,
expects his research on yeast
to translate to humans and
other mammals as well. In
particular, he will investigate J
the relationship between dietary 1
restrictions and longevity.
Covert also hopes to look at the
interaction between genes.

"Things like cancer or infection
these things don't depend on one
gene," Covert said. "They depend on
the interactions of hundreds or even
thousands of factors. It's really all
that interaction that makes the dis
ease, and that's what makes treating
those diseases so difficult."

The objective of endocrinology
Prof. Ajay Chawla's research is to
explore tissue regeneration in
mammals. He plans to exam
ine mice first and then
assess whether his find
ings are applicable for
iftfr humans as well.

these known trig
4rV> gers to potentially
regenerate tissues in
the setting of dis
ease or old age,"
Chawla said. "It
I has pretty
i straightforward
therapeutic impli
cations for
humans."
Chang-Zheng
Chen, assistant professor
of microbiology and
immunology, will study
the role of microßNAs
on the regulation of
gene expression. He
f hopes to learn about the
mechanisms that underlie the
biological activity of

microßNA.
Commenting on
his research

topic, Chen said, "It may have some
important implication in future ... I
think it is a really exciting opportunity.
"The importance of these
[microßNAs] has become very quite

apparent in recent years," he added.

Transformative ROl Award

Endocrinology Prof. Andrew
Hoffman hopes to study the role of
gene deletion and chromosome inter
action on various diseases.
"The interactions across chromo
somes can affect the way genes act,"
Hoffman said. "Our hypothesis was
that we might be able to explain some
the physical manifestations of genetic
diseases that are caused by chromo
some deletions... It's not just that a
certain gene has been deleted, but that
that gene which was deleted normally
interacted with another gene some
where else."

Calvin Kuo, associate professor of
hematology, developed a research
project that deals with intestinal cul
ture. His lab is working to grow human
intestines, a challenge that has eluded
scientists in the past.
"We hope to establish conditions
for robust propagation of human
intestines, as well as to model intestin
al diseases in the primary cultures,"
Kuo said. "Also, possibly, [we want] to
establish some systems using these cul
tures for drug screening."
Julie Parsonnet, professor of infec
tious diseases, plans to use her
Transformative ROl grant to analyze
various micro-organisms that infect
people, and Joseph Wu, professor of
medicine and radiology, plans to use
his grant to find ways to prevent the
human body from rejecting embryon
ic stem cells.

For these researchers, NIH award
money enables risky, high-yield
research that might not have been
funded otherwise. Hoffman said the
funding was a welcome change.

"I've been at Stanford now 27
years, since 1982," Hoffman remarked.
"I have to say the last few years have
been the most difficult to get grants in
all that time."

The National Institutes of Health (NIH)
last week recognized 13 scientists in Stanford
University's School of Medicine and School
of Engineering for research proposals that
embodied risk and innovation. Overall, the
NIH granted an estimated $348 million to its
115 award winners.

The NIH, which falls under the purview of

the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, is widely regarded as the nation's

leading government agency for sponsoring
medical research.

This year, the organization conferred 42
Transformative ROl Awards for exceptional
ly novel and high-risk research projects, 18
Director's Pioneer Awards for individual sci
entists whose ideas may potentially advance
biomedical or behavioral research and 55
New Innovator Awards for promising investi
gators with creative research ideas. Over the
next five years, each award recipient will

receive $3.5 million, $2.5 million and $1.5 mil
lion, respectively.

The recipients of the awards represent
