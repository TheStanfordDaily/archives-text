# Medical researchers awarded
## Thirteen scientists receive funding from leading government agency 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH)
last week recognized 13 scientists in Stanford
University's School of Medicine and School
of Engineering for research proposals that
embodied risk and innovation. Overall, the
NIH granted an estimated $348 million to its
115 award winners.

The NIH, which falls under the purview of

the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, is widely regarded as the nation's

leading government agency for sponsoring
medical research.

This year, the organization conferred 42
Transformative ROl Awards for exceptional
ly novel and high-risk research projects, 18
Director's Pioneer Awards for individual sci
entists whose ideas may potentially advance
biomedical or behavioral research and 55
New Innovator Awards for promising investi
gators with creative research ideas. Over the
next five years, each award recipient will

receive $3.5 million, $2.5 million and $1.5 mil
lion, respectively.

The recipients of the awards represent
both a cross-section of Stanford's vibrant
medical research community and a tour of
the high-risk frontiers of its ongoing projects.

Sarah Heilshorn, assistant professor of
materials science and engineering, plans to
use her NIH funding to engineer three
dimensional gel cultures to study stem cell
development.

"We can grow the neural stem cells in
these engineered environments to study how

they respond to signals that they receive,"
Heilshorn said. She hopes her research will
help generate new treatments for victims of
stroke and other trauma.

Her fellow researcher, Dr. Euan Ashley,
assistant professor of cardiovascular medi
cine, also hopes his findings will result in ben
eficial medical treatments.
