## GSC strikes down Nom Com slate 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In its second meeting of the quarter, the
Graduate Student Council (GSC) on
Wednesday night focused on an ongoing
student government controversy. The body
rescinded its approval of the original slate
recommended by the Nominations
Commission (NomCom) to serve on the
Board of Judicial Affairs (BJA), before
rejecting it entirely in an 11-2 vote.
The GSC approved all other NomCom
selections in a 12-0 vote, with one member
abstaining as a member of one of the
slates.

"We have a 'constitutional crisis' on our
hands," law student and GSC Chair Eric
Osborne told The Daily after the tense
meeting.

The GSC discussed at length whether
or not the issues raised by the Office of
Judicial Affairs regarding the lack of gen
der diversity among the original candi
dates, among them one female in a group
of five males, warranted the appointment
of an alternative slate containing an equal
number of males and females, four of
whom were undergraduates.

"At this point, I think NomCom did the
best they could with respect to diversity
and gender because they had zero gradu
ate students females and they chose one
out of three undergrads," said Eric Shed,
education representative for the GSC.
"That second slate is bogus."
The GSC had approved the initial
male-dominated BJA slate back in June,
but during yesterday's meeting the
approval was duly rescinded and, after
much debate, fully rejected.
After a series of constitutional mishaps
regarding the selection and re-selection
process, some GSC members felt that the
case is likely to be brought to the
Constitutional Council, no matter how
they voted.

"It's probably going to be the first case
the council has heard in four or five years,"
Robert Hennessy, GSC parliamentarian
suggested, after hearing that some mem
bers of the original slate for the BJA
threatened to raise the issue to the
Council.

Others warned against "haggling" over
issues of constitutionality.

"It's already been written in
NomCom's requirements [the need for]

some sense of diversity. I think that easily
counts as a requirement to beat constitu
tionality," said Fen Zhao, natural science
representative. "I'm particularly con
cerned with . . . whatever rules they're
going to make this year that might affect a
whole lot more students than constitution
ality."

"Unfortunately, this has to come out as
part of a very tumultuous situation," said
member-at large and financial officer
Ryan Peacock with regard to what he felt
was a failure of proper professionalism on
the part of one of the members of the orig
inal BJA slate. "I now question that indi
vidual's validity to serve on this board."
After suggesting the possibility of
rejecting all slates and then "starting from
scratch," some question the burden on the
NomCom to begin an entirely new selec
tion process for the BJA.

And it appears the GSC and
Undergraduate Senate will be forced to do
just that, with the former's decision to
reject the original slate and the latter's
rejection of the alternative slate for the
Board on Tuesday night. The final compo-

sition of the BJA will remain
stalled, regardless of the Senate's
position next Tuesday, as appoint
ment of the final Board requires
joint approval from both the Senate
and the GSC.

Jonathan Bakke, NomCom
chairperson, suggested that the
NomCom may respond to the
GSC's decision by putting the ball
back into student government's
court requesting that instead of
NomCom starting the interview
process anew, the Senate and GSC
work together to come up with a
new and final slate for the BJA.

Met with none of the dispute
that dominated the rest of the
evening's proceedings, all of the
evening's funding bills were
approved, including financial sup
port for ethnic group events, the
"Shaking the Foundations" confer
ence for progressive lawyers and
alternative energy initiative activi
ties.
