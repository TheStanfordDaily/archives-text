## Berkeley cops defend Tree-related arrests Officer disputes allegation of beating Cat student Friday night 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
UC-Berkeley police responded today to wit
nesses' accounts of the arrest of three men
Friday night after a Cal-Stanford women's vol
leyball game.

Lieutenant Alex Yao said some of the
arrestees' allegations including the sugges
tion that police inappropriately beat and arrest
ed the three Cal fans were "inaccurate."

Will Allanson, 24, a Cal senior, Erick Karlen,
23, a 2007 graduate, and Derrick Gillan, 22, were
arrested on suspicion of battery at 9:55 p.m.
Friday outside Berkeley's Flaas Pavilion, where
the two schools' bands were performing. They
and other Cal fans were dressed as lumberjacks.
According to them and band members, the
arrests came minutes after a lumberjack
grabbed leaves from the costume of the
Stanford band's mascot, the Tree, worn by
Jonathan Strange 'll, and fled.
Allanson and Karlen said they were sur
prised to be arrested, and Karlen said a campus
police officer "proceeded to beat [Allanson]
with a nightstick."

In addition to the battery charge, Allanson
was charged with resisting arrest and possessing
a locking blade knife longer than 2.5 inches.
Yao on Wednesday supported the charges
against Allanson. "There are interviews and
statements given by people who were at the
scene that gave a pretty clear picture that the
suspect was resisting, and officers had to do
what they needed to do in order to overcome
the resistance," Yao said. Fie said descriptions
of the scene given by Allanson, Karlen and
Stanford band members "were not actually a
reflection of what occurred." He added that the
arresting officer acted properly.
"Also, the fact that [the suspects] claimed
that we arrested the wrong individuals the
officer actually observed what occurred," Yao
said.
The Daily Californian reported
Sergeant Michael Shipman on
Monday as saying that the three
arrested were "very intoxicated," a
claim Karlen called "irritating."
Yao supported Shipman's obser
vation, saying police on the scene
told him they could "smell the odor
of alcoholic beverage from [the sus
pects'] breath, quite a distance
away."

The three were released from
jail early Saturday morning on bail.
