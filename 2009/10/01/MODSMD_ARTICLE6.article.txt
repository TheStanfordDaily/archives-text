## Entrepreneur Eric Ries stresses working through mistakes 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Owning the stage of the second session
of Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders (ETL)
speaker series Wednesday afternoon,
author and entrepreneur Eric Ries had the
crowd alternately chuckling and eagerly
copying down his advice for navigating the
fickle "start-up land."

His advice, which held to the theme of
bucking traditional business wisdom, came

from his experiences from a $4O million
loss to his surprise successes launching
various technology start-ups both before
and after the Dot Com bust. Ries also
authors the blog 'Start-Up Lessons
Learned.'

"The biggest waste in start-ups is build
ing something that nobody wants," Ries
said. Successful start-ups are not born from
grand ideas, he said, but instead are built by
a leaner organizational approach that is
responsive to customer feedback.

He was quick to debunk the myth of
entrepreneurs as visionaries dreaming up
revolutionary ideas while eating noodles in
a garage. Half-serious, he warned potential
entrepreneurs not to fall prey to the "reali
ty distortion field," disconnected from what
customers actually want.

Bringing early adopters (the first users
and customers) into the development
process creates a learning feedback loop
that ensures burgeoning start-ups don't
waste costly resources on unnecessary fea

tures, Ries said.
As Ries cautioned in the beginning,
however, this framework would not save
young companies from all the mistakes and
uncertainty that they would potentially
make.

"The bad news for you is that most of
you are going to fail," he said. "It's not per
sonal," he assured the amused audience.
"It's just a fact."
