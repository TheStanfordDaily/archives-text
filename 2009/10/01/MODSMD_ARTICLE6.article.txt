## Entrepreneur Eric Ries stresses working through mistakes 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Owning the stage of the second session
of Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders (ETL)
speaker series Wednesday afternoon,
author and entrepreneur Eric Ries had the
crowd alternately chuckling and eagerly
copying down his advice for navigating the
fickle "start-up land."

His advice, which held to the theme of
bucking traditional business wisdom, came

from his experiences from a $4O million
loss to his surprise successes launching
various technology start-ups both before
and after the Dot Com bust. Ries also
authors the blog 'Start-Up Lessons
Learned.'

"The biggest waste in start-ups is build
ing something that nobody wants," Ries
said. Successful start-ups are not born from
grand ideas, he said, but instead are built by
a leaner organizational approach that is
responsive to customer feedback.

He was quick to debunk the myth of
entrepreneurs as visionaries dreaming up
revolutionary ideas while eating noodles in
a garage. Half-serious, he warned potential
entrepreneurs not to fall prey to the "reali
ty distortion field," disconnected from what
customers actually want.

Bringing early adopters (the first users
and customers) into the development
process creates a learning feedback loop
that ensures burgeoning start-ups don't
waste costly resources on unnecessary fea

tures, Ries said.
As Ries cautioned in the beginning,
however, this framework would not save
young companies from all the mistakes and
uncertainty that they would potentially
make.

"The bad news for you is that most of
you are going to fail," he said. "It's not per
sonal," he assured the amused audience.
"It's just a fact."
He shared that his first start-up,
where he met every benchmark
and did everything right, still
resulted in millions of dollars wast
ed.

And even though his second
start-up, the social avatar network
IMVU, was launched with bugs,
errors and no hope of success, it
ended up growing into a world
wide networking service.
Leonard Golub 'll, who man

aged to secure a seat in the packed
Shilling Auditorium audience
members blocked both aisles and
craned their necks through the
doorways valued the entrepre
neurship and technologies advice
from Ries.

"The idea to integrate your
engineers and marketing team val
idated what I thought before, but it
was good to hear it here," Golub
said. "It's great to see how it plays
out in the big leagues."

Attendee Vikas Yendluri 'l3,
who hopes to enter the competi
tive world of start-ups in the
future, appreciated hearing lessons
from someone who had been there

already.
"When I try it myself, I want to
hear from other people before I
make the same mistakes," he said.
Golub and Yendluri are regis
tered for the official MS&E 472
seminar class that incorporates the
nine lectures over the quarter.

The ETL lectures are student
run and co-sponsored by the
Business Association of Stanford
Entrepreneurial Students, the
Stanford Technology Ventures
Program and the venture capital
firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson.
