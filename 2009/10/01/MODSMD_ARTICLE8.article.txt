## A blog a day...
### ANDREA SY STAFF WRITER 
There are so many networking tools today that
it's near-impossible to be out of the loop. And
one way Stanford stays connected is via the
blog.

Used as a creative outlet, venting venue and a medi
um for self-expression, the blog is a unique way for stu
dents to document their thoughts and daily lives.
The Stanford Daily caught up with Timothy Wong
'll, who manages his own blog on Xanga. Wong hopped
onto the blogging bandwagon with his friends in high
school and has continued the trend into college.
Documenting his thoughts online has now become the
norm.

"I was really drawn to it because it was new, exciting
and cool," Wong said. "It also felt neat that what I wrote
was being read by my friends."
History Prof. Thomas Mullaney started blogging
when Christian Tom 'O9, a student in an archeology class
on East Asia and a former Daily editor, invited
Mullaney to blog on the Stanford Unofficial Blog about
his summer research in China in 2007.

"I mostly blogged about China since I felt that it
would be the most interesting time to write about China
and write about things going on in the contemporary
world," Mullaney said.
While people get into blogging for very different rea
sons, the freedom they have to write about whatever
they want gives blogging its universal appeal. Chris
Rurik 'll, who has a blog on blogspot.com with fellow
bloggers Lara Ortiz-Luis 'll and Wyatt Roy 'll, says
self-expression draws him to the medium.
"As a writer, I needed to work at my craft daily in a
disciplined way in order to improve any ability I might
have," Rurik said. Rurik, Ortiz-Luis and Roy each com

pose a story or a poem of exactly 100 words every day.
For Austin Keeley 'll, who also has a blog on
blogspot, and Paula de los Angeles 'lO, who manages a
cooking blog with William H. Lewis 'O9, blogging is
something more personal and rooted in day-to-day life.
Keeley started his blog when he went to Paris during
Fall Quarter, using it as a tool for keeping in touch with
people back home. For de los Angeles, blogging started
out as a summer activity but slowly became something
more.

"Our food blog started off as just one of those crazy
summer dreamy ideas that we've gradually taken more
seriously," de los Angeles said. "We both really enjoy
cooking and baking and already use the Internet to find
recipes, so creating a photo blog of our own kitchen
adventures was an easy tangent to follow. We cooked a
variety of foods, with a great number rooted in tradition
al Filipino dishes, because that's what I knew and grew
up with. It was nice to be able to share that with Will."
Keeley, too, got into the swing of sharing his experi
ences online.

"I tried to use the blog as a regular update of my day
to-day activities," Keeley said. "Had I been at Stanford,
it would have been quite boring, but 10 weeks in the
City of Lights was more than enough material!"
Now accessible to virtually anyone with Internet
access, blogs have become an essential communication
link for some.

"Now that Will has graduated and is living on the
East Coast, it's nice that we can both still share our inde
pendent cooking adventures through the blog, and we
plan to continue to post," de los Angeles said. "[This
way], it's easy to do distance."
While blogging has become a daily regimen for these
four bloggers, they admit Stanford has a relatively
scarce blogging culture.
De los Angeles, for instance, confesses that despite
having a blog, she doesn't actively follow any other

blogs. "We don't really read other blogs right now aside
from academic ones, but it'd be nice to see what else is
out there," she said. "It's a fun niche cooking and
baking all types of food at this age."
"I don't think blogging is big on campus, or really
anywhere else," Wong said. "I have witnessed many peo
ple start blogs, but very few people actually maintain
them for an extended period of time. It kind of follows
a 'one percent rule,' which states that out of all people
who use the Internet, one percent will create content, 10
percent will interact with it and the rest will just view it."

Blogophile Timothy Wong '11 started documenting
his thoughts online in high school and fell in love
with his Xanga account. Despite his affinity for the
practice, Wong says the blogging culture is relatively scarce at the Farm.
