# Explore San Francisco, the Stanford Way
## 
### JESS WERTHEIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
San Francisco: It's hip, it's
liberal and, depending on
what side of Mission Street
you walk on, it's a gold
mine for unsolicited mar
riage proposals. San Francisco is the
home of the Summer of Love and
historic Lombard Street, and boasts
the title of the second most densely
populated major city in the United
States. So, quite understandably, it's
easy to get lost in the shuffle.
With many freshmen and some
upperclassmen hitting the streets
of the City by the Bay this week
end for Scavenger Flunt, the fol
lowing is a list of the top 10 things
to do, see and eat in S.F. when
you're not serenading strangers, of
course. This list is in no particular
order, so make like Pokemon and
catch 'em all.

Do or re-do the freshman Scavenger Hunt. It helps to feel young
again.

2 Visit Aquarius records. It's the oldest
record store in the city.
"It's quirky, and the owners cham
pion very independent records,"
said Hank Drew, a freelance multi
media reporter. "They seek small
indie bands that other record stores
may forget about or not see."
There is also a small selection of
vintage 1980 arcade machines, and
all the staff are very helpful.

3 Go to a jazz club. Try Biscuits and Blues.
"They serve you unlimited biscuits, which is
more amusing than delicious," said Daniel
Schwarz 'll.
There's also Yoshi's, which features world
renowned jazz musicians, "but don't get food
there," Schwarz warns. "It's really expensive.
Eat before you go."
The breakdown, then: Yoshi's: more expen
sive, better musicians, but fewer free biscuits.
Biscuits and Blues: cheaper, lower-profile musi
cians.

4 Fort Mason Center. Although the drive from Stanford to the Fort Mason
Center can get a bit dicey, it's well worth it.
"The Fort Mason area has cool events," said Peter Smillie 'll. "Plus,
the parking is easy."
Recently, the Fort Mason Center hosted a robot convention, complete
with robot soccer and robot death matches, the BATS (Bay Area Theater
and Sports) show and all-girl, full-contact roller derby.

5 Little Orphan Andy's. If you want
to pull an all-nighter without getting
much work done, Little Orphan
Andy's is the place. It's located in
the Castro District, next to the cook
ie shop with the edible underwear
(another shop that's worth a peek).
It's busiest after the clubs close and
a great atmosphere to people
watch. In addition, the chocolate
chip pancakes are, according to
Yelp.com, "sit on your face fantas
tic." The waiters are funny, but noth
ing compares to the patrons.
Remember this place for your next
midnight rendezvous.

6 Exploratorium. The muse
um of science, art and
A human perception has a
B very Bill Nye the Science
Guy, hands-on approach
Lto learning. Admission is
$1 1 if you're a student, so
bust out your SUID, show
off that Cardinal red, train
your working memory and
stand in line with 12-year
rolds. Go on, make your
mother proud.

Z Fisherman's Wharf. If you're looking
to fall into one of the stereotypical
tourist traps, look no further. The rabbit
hole is here. Michelle Fitzhugh-Craig,
a news editor at The Public Press, has
been working in San Francisco for the
past four years and swears by the Pier
39 Market Seafood Restaurant.
"I always get their clam chowder
it's to die for," Fitzhugh-Craig said.
"The trick is to order the chowder in
the sourdough bowl. You get more
soup that way and you get free
sourdough anyway."

8 Walk (don't run) across the
Golden Gate Bridge. Bring a
sweater, camera and reliable
footwear. And while you're over there,
check out the view from Fort Baker (at
the north end of the Golden Gate
Bridge).

9 Shop at Haight-
Ashbury. Named
for the cross
streets, Haight-
Ashbury was a hip
pie haven in the
1 960s but has
since gentrified. It's
a bohemian meets
American counter
culture district, and
a definite go-see.

0 Go to a Giants Baseball Game in AT&T park.
Get into the game, then scream, buy a hat, avoid
the hot dogs.
