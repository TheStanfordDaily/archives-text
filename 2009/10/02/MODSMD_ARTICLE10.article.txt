# THE
						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## Where are the women? 
### Shelley Gao 
While it has been said that I have met
a few people here and there on cam
pus, this allegation is simply not
true. There are exactly 2,579 delightful Stan
ford students, including 97.2 percent of the
tremendous Class of 2013, whom I have yet
to meet personally. But of those 5,011 plus
that I am dear friends with, and the roughly
367 student organizations in which they par
ticipate, I can tell all of you this: we need
more women running this school and the
world.

It is unsurprising that women are wary of
participating in electoral politics, in particu
lar. The treatment of Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential elec
tion proves that sexism still thrives in con
temporary society. All the rhetoric about
whether she is too tough (or not tough
enough!), polarizing, cold and calculating are
judgments based on her gender rather than
the issues. Some found it impossible to be
lieve that she might actually have real feel
ings! What else could her brimming in tears
in New Hampshire be, except an orchestrat
ed ploy to gain sympathy?
Despite not winning, Clinton's candidacy
signified that women could be serious con
tenders for the presidency. The 18 million
cracks in the highest glass ceiling represent
ed a momentous step in history toward gen
der equality for women everywhere.
In recent years, an entire subject has de
veloped focusing on female engagement in
public life. It appears that women have made
significant progress; they now outnumber
male college students and comprise more
than half of the individuals becoming doctors
and lawyers, albeit earning a lower pay. How
ever, women still lag far behind in heading
corporations and shaping national and inter
national politics. Extensive research has
been conducted into existing institutions and
structures that pose as barriers to participa
tion, and how to foster greater female repre
sentation around the world.

Actions, however, often speak louder
than words. Be it organizations such as
EMILY's List, which helps to elect progres
sive, pro-choice women to office, or the re
cent Clinton Global Initiative's "The Invest
ing in Women and Girls" dinner in New York
City, we are increasingly recognizing the im
portance of female leadership.
For the past three years, we have had all
male ASSU executives. This year, one female
was elected to the Undergraduate Senate

(me!). Campus politics mirror the real world,
particularly in its male-dominated nature.
Women just do not seem interested! They do
not apply to serve on University committees
and do not run in student government elec
tions. The problem lies not with the system,
but with the mentality. How can we decry the
outcome when we do not get involved in the
first place?
Interestingly, there are numerous active
female leaders in public service and who are
working for the common good. Stanford
women are making incredible contributions
to society, whether it is through improving
American education, promoting sustainabil
ity or championing civil rights. Women seem
to be issue- or policy-oriented, rather than
politically driven. Who can blame them? Pol
itics has gained such a bad reputation. It is
seen as a game played by self-interested,
testosterone-charged, ego-driven males
seeking power. It has become so "socially in
correct" to love politics for the sake of poli
tics.

This perspective is consistent with the rise
in non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
and non-profits. The choice seems pretty
clear: the "dirty" and "sleazy" political realm,
or the morally pure and celebrated NGOs
world? Undoubtedly, NGOs are tremen
dously important to tackling the most press
ing issues of our day. However, it is critical to
reconcile the two arenas, and for practition
ers in both fields to understand each other.

I am always surprised by friends in policy
or academia who cannot understand why the
perfect solution to healthcare, North Korea
and other crises cannot be implemented.
Knowing politics helps. The real world is not
ruled by theory.
Unquestionably, politics can be brutal and
nasty. At times, I question my own sanity. But,
women need to participate! We have differ
ent perspectives and contribute a vital voice
to the governance of our school and country.
It is unacceptable for the majority of the pop
ulation to be underrepresented (sometimes,
not heard at all!) in making decisions that af
fect us and future generations. As educated
elite, women at Stanford need to rise to the
challenge and join in the fight for more equi
table representation in politics.

Shelley will undoubtedly be harassing the
Class of 2013 upon her return from D. C. Eager
