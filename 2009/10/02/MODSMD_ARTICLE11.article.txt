### DANIEL LEIFER Class of 2010 
A severe drought is currently plaguing
Northern California. Given this backdrop, I
found it rather strange that Daily columnist
Erica Morgan has launched a tirade ["Pass
the tray," Sept. 30] against water conserva
tion and the environmental movement as a
whole. How has Ms. Morgan been wronged?
Because, at a particular Stanford dining hall,
when the employee swipes her ID card, she
has to ask for a cafeteria tray. Something is
wrong with this picture.
I applaud Stanford for its successful efforts
in reducing water consumption. Our campus

has commendably begun using reclaimed
water to maintain some athletics fields and
has installed low-flow showerheads and toi
lets. If Stanford Dining encourages a few stu
dents to avoid using cafeteria trays, so much
the better. And if the current campaign re
duces food waste, that's better still.
According to the columnist, these views
make me an "environmental evangelist seek
ing to dissipate the apathy from [my] life."
I'm not entirely sure what that means, but I
like to think I'm a decent fellow who wants to
do something good. When Ms. Morgan urges

us to defend our supposed right to consume
as much as we want, unfettered, I feel she
wants to make herself feel good about only
wanting to help herself.
Perhaps it's fitting that someone who so
fervently opposes conservation efforts would
waste so much newsprint with these
tantrums. I commend the Stanford communi
ty for striving to reduce its environmental im
pact and for working to conserve water dur
ing the current drought.
