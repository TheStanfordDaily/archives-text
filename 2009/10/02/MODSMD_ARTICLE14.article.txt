## RIGHTFULLY RANKED Men's soccer receives national recognition 
### TOM TAYLOR 
The Stanford men's soccer team travels to
Berkeley today to take on Cal at Edwards Sta
dium.
After a great season so far, the Cardinal (6-
1-0) takes on the Bears (6-2-0) in a rematch of
their final game last season.
That day, Stanford's ninth match of the
whole campaign and its second against Cal,
capped a frustrating season with another 1-0
defeat for Stanford. Injuries to key players, in
cluding seniors Evan Morgan andT. J. Novak,
might explain some of those results, but the
Cardinal's major problem was simply a lack of
goals.
Over 18 games, Stanford scored just 14
goals, with an average of 0.78 per game. In
seven games this season, they have already
matched that number, averaging two goals per
match so far.
The Cardinal is off to its best start since
2002 (7-0-0), and enters today's contest on a
six-game winning streak, hoping to make it
seven. After a long time outside of the
NSCAA national rankings, the Cardinal just
broke back in at No. 20. The players are gain
ing confidence with every game, putting the
disappointment of last year swiftly behind
them.
None of this is a fluke, however; it stems
from hard work and planning over the close
season. After the graduation of several key
players, the team put together a new back four
over the winter, rebuilding the defense from
scratch. The attack was then energized by the
arrival of talented freshmen in the summer. As
the games build up, this redesigned team is be
ginning to gel.
But Cal will certainly not be a walk-over.
Despite a disappointing loss to New Mexico
last Friday, the Bears still rank No. 7 in the
country and remain an experienced and ma-

ture team with a real depth of talent. Cal has
made the NCAAs for the past eight years in a
row, and they are unbeaten at home this sea
son with four wins.
The all-time record between the two might
lie in Stanford's favor at 25-17-7, but history
means nothing to the current crop of players.
When asked whether this match against
the Cardinal's traditional rivals was soccer's
"Big Game," head coach Bret Simon ex
plained that it was an important game, but not
more so than any of the others in the Pac-10.
The team looks beyond the momentary goal
of beating Cal and keeps their gaze on qualify
ing for the NCAA tournament in November,
which requires good results in all of the 10 up
coming matches.
Simon is definitely pleased with the
progress the team has made this year, but is
taking a measured approach. The team is far
from a finished article, and Simon is careful to
keep their feet on the ground after their sue

cess since the beginning of September. There
are definitely some talented and creative play
ers on the squad, but it takes time to harness
their attacking abilities without making rash
mistakes that might leave the defense danger
ously exposed.
In a similar vein, Simon is hesitant to pick
out any star performers in the group. Accord
ing to him, they win and lose as a team, and
while players like Bobby Warshaw may have
been grabbing recent headlines comfort
ably switching from striker to defender this

year and still scoring three goals it will take
every man on the pitch to bring home tro
phies.
However, even from a cautious viewpoint,
today must be perceived as a great opportuni
ty. Both teams have posted almost identical
records against pretty much the same opposi
tion this year, and Cal is planning their chal
lenge for an NCAA spot. A win for the Cardi
nal will both dent its rival's hopes while boost
ing its own.
After today, the teams will next play in the

closing match of the Pac-10 Conference, at
home in the Laird Q. Cagan Stadium in mid-
November. Whatever happens between now
and then, expect that contest to be the real
"Big Game," as the teams either lay out their
final case for inclusion in the NCAAs or seek
retribution.
Kickoff is scheduled for 4 p.m. today at the
Edwards stadium.

MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
What was presumed to be a rebuilding year has been anything but for the Stanford men's soccer team. Now ranked No. 19 in the nation, the
Cardinal looks to continue to build on its recent success of six straight victories. The team has not lost since its opening match against Lehigh.
