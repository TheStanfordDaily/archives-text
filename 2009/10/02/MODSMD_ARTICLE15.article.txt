# Perplexed by the Pac-10
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
It's the fifth week of college foot
ball season, and we're more lost
than a freshman in Math 51. We
thought we had a good under
standing of how the Pac-10 would
shape out this year who the con
tenders and pretenders would be.
However, after five weeks, it's safe to
say that we don't know anything yet
about this year's Pac-10, and if we
thought we actually did know some
thing, we were wrong.
What we thought we knew: Ore
gon was cooked after a loss to Boise
State and the suspension of running
back LeGarrette Blount.
What we now know: Oregon is a
legitimate Pac-10 title contender.
The season started as a disaster for
the Ducks, getting handled hard by
Boise State and then losing star back
Blount to a post-game unsportsman
like act. Count me as one of those who
thought Oregon would not recover
after that double whammy. But Chip
Kelly has done a great job of re focus
ing his team on the present, and it's
brought them some real success on
the field. A victory over Purdue and a
big win over Utah set up last week
end's absolute romp of Cal. Suddenly
Oregon has gained an upper hand in
the Pac-10. Winning the USC game in
Eugene in a couple weeks would be a
huge step.
What we thought we knew: De
spite losing the heart of their defense
and going with a freshman quarter
back this year, USC might not have
any problems.
What we now know: USC is not
the favorite to win the Pac-10 any
more.
The trendy upset pick of Washing
ton over USC was a winner, as USC
looked anemic on offense and could
not stop big plays on defense.The Tro
jans committed 13 penalties in their
win over Washington State last week.
USC just doesn't look like the domi

nating Trojans of past years, and this
void in the Pac-10 has opened the
door for other teams. A tough sched
ule looms for the Trojans, starting this
weekend at Cal and building with
away games at Notre Dame and Ore
gon. I'm not buying USC this year as
a top-10 team. Here's predicting they
don't end up in a BCS bowl game.
What we thought we knew:
UCLA had another year before they
would return to former greatness.

What we now know: This is look
ing like the year UCLA gets back
onto the map.
How many people actually
thought UCLA could face Tennessee
and win? I for one was surprised, but
after seeing how their defense played
over the last three games, that upset
doesn't seem so shocking anymore.
UCLA is 3-0 right now and has the
look of an eight or nine-win team. I
will give them serious consideration
in every game they play this year, in
cluding right here tomorrow after
noon. Stanford can gain the advan
tage tomorrow by making their back
up quarterback Kevin Craft play
ing for injured starter Kevin Prince
uncomfortable in the pocket.

Watch out for the Bruins' major play
maker on offense, #4 Terrance Austin
and their defensive stud, #lO Akeem
Ayers.
What we thought we knew: Stan
ford would have a tough time getting
six or seven wins and making a bowl
game this year.
What we now know: The Pac-10 is
wide open, and there are wins out
there for the taking.
After an extremely tough loss on
the road to Wake Forest two weeks
ago, questions started mounting
about what kind of team the Cardinal
really was. But Stanford came out fir
ing against San Jose State and went
on to trample a hyped-up Washing
ton. Two games with great perform
ances on all sides of the ball both
ended in wins for the Cardinal. The
games left on the schedule are tough
UCLA, USC, Oregon, Oregon
State, Arizona State, Arizona, Cal and
Notre Dame are all quality teams. But
with the way things have been shap
ing up this year, no game is un
winnable. If Stanford can run the ball
effectively, control the clock, play de
cent defense and win the special
teams battle all of which they did
last week the Cardinal can defi
nitely win at least seven games. While
no easy team remains on the sched
ule, there now seems to be no truly
daunting opponent, either.
What we thought we knew: Cal

was on pace for an outstanding sea
son and a possible Rose Bowl berth.

What we now know: Cal has to
fight in order to stay alive.
This wasn't supposed to be a
make-or-break weekend for Cal, but
when the Bears welcome USC this
Saturday, both teams will be looking
for a dreadfully needed win. It's great
for the rest of the Pac-10, which by the
end of the game will see one of the
Pac-10's best teams two losses in the
hole. I still believe that Jahvid Best
can kill you and that Cal is a great
team. I'd actually love to see Cal
bounce back with a solid win over the
Trojans, and I believe it will happen.
Stanford 3-0 in the Pac-10 and USC 1-
2? Pinch me, I'm dreaming.
