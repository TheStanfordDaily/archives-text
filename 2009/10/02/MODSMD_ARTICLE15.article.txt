# Perplexed by the Pac-10
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
It's the fifth week of college foot
ball season, and we're more lost
than a freshman in Math 51. We
thought we had a good under
standing of how the Pac-10 would
shape out this year who the con
tenders and pretenders would be.
However, after five weeks, it's safe to
say that we don't know anything yet
about this year's Pac-10, and if we
thought we actually did know some
thing, we were wrong.
What we thought we knew: Ore
gon was cooked after a loss to Boise
State and the suspension of running
back LeGarrette Blount.
What we now know: Oregon is a
legitimate Pac-10 title contender.
The season started as a disaster for
the Ducks, getting handled hard by
Boise State and then losing star back
Blount to a post-game unsportsman
like act. Count me as one of those who
thought Oregon would not recover
after that double whammy. But Chip
Kelly has done a great job of re focus
ing his team on the present, and it's
brought them some real success on
the field. A victory over Purdue and a
big win over Utah set up last week
end's absolute romp of Cal. Suddenly
Oregon has gained an upper hand in
the Pac-10. Winning the USC game in
Eugene in a couple weeks would be a
huge step.
What we thought we knew: De
spite losing the heart of their defense
and going with a freshman quarter
back this year, USC might not have
any problems.
What we now know: USC is not
the favorite to win the Pac-10 any
more.
The trendy upset pick of Washing
ton over USC was a winner, as USC
looked anemic on offense and could
not stop big plays on defense.The Tro
jans committed 13 penalties in their
win over Washington State last week.
USC just doesn't look like the domi
