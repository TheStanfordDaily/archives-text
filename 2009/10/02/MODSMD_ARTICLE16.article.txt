# Broncos Befuddled
## Stanford women shine against Santa Clara 
### SAM SVOBODA NATE ADAMS DESK EDITORS 
In facing No. 11 Santa Clara on the
road Thursday night, Stanford had
every reason to expect a tough match
to close out its non-conference season
and at first, at least, that's exactly
what the Cardinal got.
Initially, the Broncos (8-4) were
able to match Stanford's tempo as the
teams exchanged control of the ball.
Neither team, in fact, was able to put a
shot on goal in the first 15 minutes.
When the breakthrough finally came,
it was Santa Clara that drew first blood
SCU's Kiki Bosio launched a flip
throw in from the left side deep into
the box, and Jordan Angeli only need
ed a touch on her header to redirect
the ball and give her team a 1-0 lead
over the No. 2 Cardinal (11-0-0).
The goal seemed to give the Bron
cos confidence, and instead of "park
ing the bus," they began to get even
more aggressive on offense. The Car
dinal defense weathered the storm,
but the offense had yet to find its flow,
relying on long-range efforts.
That all changed in the 24th
minute. Junior forward Christen Press
put just enough on her aerial through

ball to get it over the Bronco backline,
and fellow forward Kelley O'Hara
charged onto it and deftly side
volleyed past SCU keeper Bianca
Henninger to level the scores and
notch her 11th goal of the season.
Five minutes later, Santa Clara al
most went back in front. The Cardinal
defense was able to clear a cross into
the box, but the clearance only made it
out to Bronco left back Dani Potts
near the top of the box. Potts went for
power and had Stanford keeper Kira
Maker beaten, but the ball curled out
side the post.
SCU came close again with just 10
minutes remaining. Bronco forward
Lauren Matheson received the ball in
the box off of a nice give-and-go, but
Stanford right back Rachel Quon was
alert to cut out the danger.
It was a bit against the run of play,
then, when Stanford took the lead two
minutes later. It looked like Santa
Clara had cleared their lines after
blocking an attempt by senior Kristin
Stannard, but freshman midfielder
Mariah Nogueira charged to the loose
ball and lofted it back into the penalty
area. Press was there and after tak
ing it down beautifully rifled the
ball past Henninger.
The match was beginning to pick
up from an attacking standpoint, and a
minute later the flip throw almost
struck again. Bosio's missile actually
bounced in Stanford's box and was
heading dangerously close to the net
before Nogueira smartly rose to head

it away, preserving the Cardinal lead
going into halftime.
Just seven minutes into the second
half, Stanford's offensive floodgates
began to pour open. Senior left back
Ali Riley had her low cross blocked,
but the ball went right to forward
Lindsay Taylor. The sophomore
turned her defender expertly and put
the ball right across the face of goal;
classmate Teresa Noyola only needed
to tap it in.
Head coach Paul Ratcliffe was
pleased with the way his team re
sponded after finding itself down 0-1,
especially in the second half.
"I was disappointed we went down
a goal, but after that we responded
with a nice goal, and then we started to
get our confidence and get our
rhythm. We played much better after
that, after halftime," Ratcliffe com
mented.
If 3-1 was a little harsh on Santa
Clara, it would only get harsher.
O'Hara notched her second of the
game just two minutes later, slotting
home from close range on a cross from
the right. Taylor was again the
provider, and although she didn't
record a goal, she certainly seems to be
getting back to full form after an early
season virus.

But the Cardinal was not yet done
it was soon 5-1, as O'Hara broke down
the right before centering to a wide
open Press, and yet again it was a sim-

pie tap in for Stanford.

Both teams soon subbed out the
majority of their starting lineups, and
although the Card was still creating
chances, the match died down a bit.
Santa Clara would grab a late conso
lation goal in the 79th minute, when
Meleana Shim converted a penalty
kick to make the score 5-2. Tlie goal
was just the eighth allowed by Stan
ford keeper Kira Maker all season, in
a game that saw two unorthodox
scores sneak into the Cardinal net.

"We would've loved to have a
shutout coming out of this game, but
our defense played great," Maker
said. "We played great all across the
field and came out with a win,
though, and that's what we wanted to
do."

Indeed, the game's final result was
never in doubt. Stanford would finish
off the scoring with just under three
minutes remaining. Freshman Mar
jani Hing-Glover found herself open
in the box and buried a shot past
Henninger the first of her colle
giate career to put the final score
at 6-2.

Now undefeated after 11 games,
the 2009 Stanford squad has tied the
record for the best start to a season in

school history, set in 1991. Ratcliffe is
pleased with how things are going, es
pecially with Pac-10 play just around
the corner.

"[This win] feels good, it shows
the potential we have," Ratcliffe said.
"We're a very strong attacking team
and we've got to keep playing like
this. And hopefully, this leads into
Pac-10 play."

Stanford heads north next week
end to take on the Oregon schools,
opening conference play against Ore
gon State on Friday and Oregon the

minute. Junior forward Christen Press
put just enough on her aerial through

ball to get it over the Bronco backline,
and fellow forward Kelley O'Hara
charged onto it and deftly side
volleyed past SCU keeper Bianca
Henninger to level the scores and
notch her 11th goal of the season.
Five minutes later, Santa Clara al
most went back in front. The Cardinal
defense was able to clear a cross into
the box, but the clearance only made it
out to Bronco left back Dani Potts
near the top of the box. Potts went for
power and had Stanford keeper Kira
Maker beaten, but the ball curled out
side the post.
SCU came close again with just 10
minutes remaining. Bronco forward
Lauren Matheson received the ball in
the box off of a nice give-and-go, but
Stanford right back Rachel Quon was
alert to cut out the danger.
It was a bit against the run of play,
then, when Stanford took the lead two
minutes later. It looked like Santa
Clara had cleared their lines after
blocking an attempt by senior Kristin
Stannard, but freshman midfielder
Mariah Nogueira charged to the loose
ball and lofted it back into the penalty
area. Press was there and after tak
ing it down beautifully rifled the
ball past Henninger.
The match was beginning to pick
up from an attacking standpoint, and a
minute later the flip throw almost
struck again. Bosio's missile actually
bounced in Stanford's box and was
heading dangerously close to the net
before Nogueira smartly rose to head

it away, preserving the Cardinal lead
going into halftime.
Just seven minutes into the second
half, Stanford's offensive floodgates
began to pour open. Senior left back
Ali Riley had her low cross blocked,
but the ball went right to forward
Lindsay Taylor. The sophomore
turned her defender expertly and put
the ball right across the face of goal;
classmate Teresa Noyola only needed
to tap it in.
Head coach Paul Ratcliffe was
pleased with the way his team re
sponded after finding itself down 0-1,
especially in the second half.
"I was disappointed we went down
a goal, but after that we responded
with a nice goal, and then we started to
get our confidence and get our
rhythm. We played much better after
that, after halftime," Ratcliffe com
mented.
If 3-1 was a little harsh on Santa
Clara, it would only get harsher.
O'Hara notched her second of the
game just two minutes later, slotting
home from close range on a cross from
the right. Taylor was again the
provider, and although she didn't
record a goal, she certainly seems to be
getting back to full form after an early
season virus.

But the Cardinal was not yet done
it was soon 5-1, as O'Hara broke down
the right before centering to a wide
open Press, and yet again it was a sim-

Despite a slow start to Thursday night's game against Santa Clara, the
Stanford women's soccer team continued its dominant ways, improving
its recorded to an undefeated 11-0-0 on the season.
pie tap in for Stanford.

Both teams soon subbed out the
majority of their starting lineups, and
although the Card was still creating
chances, the match died down a bit.
Santa Clara would grab a late conso
lation goal in the 79th minute, when
Meleana Shim converted a penalty
kick to make the score 5-2. Tlie goal
was just the eighth allowed by Stan
ford keeper Kira Maker all season, in
a game that saw two unorthodox
scores sneak into the Cardinal net.

"We would've loved to have a
shutout coming out of this game, but
our defense played great," Maker
said. "We played great all across the
field and came out with a win,
though, and that's what we wanted to
do."

Indeed, the game's final result was
never in doubt. Stanford would finish
off the scoring with just under three
minutes remaining. Freshman Mar
jani Hing-Glover found herself open
in the box and buried a shot past
Henninger the first of her colle
giate career to put the final score
at 6-2.

Now undefeated after 11 games,
the 2009 Stanford squad has tied the
record for the best start to a season in

school history, set in 1991. Ratcliffe is
pleased with how things are going, es
pecially with Pac-10 play just around
the corner.

"[This win] feels good, it shows
the potential we have," Ratcliffe said.
"We're a very strong attacking team
and we've got to keep playing like
this. And hopefully, this leads into
Pac-10 play."

Stanford heads north next week
end to take on the Oregon schools,
opening conference play against Ore
gon State on Friday and Oregon the
following Sunday.
