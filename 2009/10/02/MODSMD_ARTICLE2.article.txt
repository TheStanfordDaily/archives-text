## Cardinal suits up for battle with Bruins 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
UCLA is undefeated. Stanford is top in the Pac-10.
The two programs, both on a similar upward trajectory,
will collide this Saturday in an improbable battle for con
ference supremacy.
The Bruins have the benefit of two weeks rest after
starting their season with three straight wins, including
one on the road over Tennessee, The Cardinal, by con
trast, has yet to get a break, but that doesn't seem to faze
it; with few exceptions, Stanford has improved with each
game, even with each quarter of play. Its latest perform
ance, a 34-14 victory over then-No. 24 Washington, was
borderline virtuoso, as the running attack and defense
combined to trample the Huskies.
UCLA, though, poses a credible threat to the ambi
tious Cardinal. They roll into town with the nation's
14th-ranked run defense, which includes stars such as
Reggie Carter and Brian Price. They'll be tasked with
containing Stanford's star tailback, Toby Gerhart, who
rushed for a career-high 200 yards last week the
phrase "unstoppable force meeting an immovable ob
ject" comes to mind. Indeed, in terms of early season

NOTES: Stanford comes off of a 34-14 victory
against then-24th ranked Washington last
weekend. They hope to remain undefeated
at home tomorrow and continue their
record of opening kickoff returns for touch
downs. UCLA is undefeated this season and
rocks the nation's 14th-ranked defense.

tests, as well as conference position
ing, the match-up is about as equal
as one could get, and the impending
collision between the Cardinal's
rushing attack and the Bruins' run
defense is emblematic of that.
Carter understood the complexi
ty and importance of his task. "He's a
strong guy. Everybody's got to do
their job," he said.
Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh
heaped plenty of praise on his senior
rusher, but, as nearly every Cardinal
does, emphasized the role of the
team in making it a successful attack.
"There is no doubt that Toby is a
shining star on this team. As a player,
I think he is good if not the best in the
country," he said. "But he would be
the first to tell you that that line, the

fullback, [and] the receivers block."
The degree of difficulty is evident
for schools, and neither team is tak
ing it lightly.
"The defense is a huge challenge.
Price is a phenomenal football play
er," Harbaugh said. "This is the best
three linebackers we've played
against and the best secondary we've
played against."
"You better put on your big-boy
pads," said Harbaugh's UCLA coun
terpart, Rick Neuheisel. "They come
at you.They make no bones about it."
While the running game (de
servedly) holds top billing, there are
compelling matchups across the
board. For example, Stanford will
likely try to establish its pass rush
early against a UCLA offensive line

that has had some trouble in protec
tion early in the season. Adding to
the Bruins' problems on that front is
that their starting quarterback,
Kevin Prince, is out for Saturday's
game. Replacing Prince will be last
year's starter, Kevin Craft, who
threw 20 interceptions last season.
Craft is a familiar face for the
Cardinal he led the winning drive
against Stanford that culminated in a
touchdown pass with just 10 seconds
remaining in Pasadena last season
and Harbaugh refuses to take him
lightly.
"I always had a lot of respect for
him. I always thought he was their
best quarterback. I always figured
that he would be the quarterback
that we'd be seeing. He's resourceful.

I think he's very talented," he said.
Perhaps just as interesting as the
chess game orchestrated by the re
spective offenses and defenses will
be the one played out with the spe
cial teams. Sophomore return man
Chris Owusu has run wild over op
ponents all year, so much so that
teams have refused to kick to him.
UCLA, though, has one of the better
coverage teams around, and their
kicker, Kai Forbath, has consider
able leg strength. The Bruins might
take their chances, and Harbaugh
wants to be prepared for every con
tingency.
"We'll be prepared both ways.
This is also the best special teams
unit we have faced and they do a
great job on kickoff," he said. "We

definitely respect them on special
teams because they are good. We
have to be prepared for what they
can do."
The intricacies of the game are
vast. For every punch there seems to
be an available counterpunch, which
makes the contest all the more com
pelling. The weekend was supposed
to be about the matchup in the East
Bay: Cal vs. USC, two preseason fa
vorites. But the eyes of the nation
have instead landed on Palo Alto.
Stanford made some noise by knock
ing off a ranked Washington squad;
they can cause a ruckus by downing
UCLA.

cial teams. Sophomore return man
Chris Owusu has run wild over op
ponents all year, so much so that
teams have refused to kick to him.
UCLA, though, has one of the better
coverage teams around, and their
kicker, Kai Forbath, has consider
able leg strength. The Bruins might
take their chances, and Harbaugh
wants to be prepared for every con
tingency.
"We'll be prepared both ways.
This is also the best special teams
unit we have faced and they do a
great job on kickoff," he said. "We

definitely respect them on special
teams because they are good. We
have to be prepared for what they
can do."
The intricacies of the game are
vast. For every punch there seems to
be an available counterpunch, which
makes the contest all the more com
pelling. The weekend was supposed
to be about the matchup in the East
Bay: Cal vs. USC, two preseason fa
vorites. But the eyes of the nation
have instead landed on Palo Alto.
Stanford made some noise by knock
ing off a ranked Washington squad;
they can cause a ruckus by downing
UCLA.
