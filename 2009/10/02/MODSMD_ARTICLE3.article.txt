# VOLLEYBALL HEADS TO L.A.

### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The women's volleyball team (7-4
overall, 0-1 Pac-10) looks to recover
from last weekend's 3-2 loss against Cal
ifornia as it heads to Los Angeles to take
on UCLA (11-4 overall, 1-1 conference)
today and USC (12-2 overall, 1-1 confer
ence) on Saturday.
No. 11 Stanford dropped down a
notch in the rankings after a loss to rival
Cal last weekend. Though the loss may
seem like a setback for the team, the
scoreboard was the only negative aspect
of an otherwise exciting game. Alix
Klineman hit a season high of 23 kills,
Cassidy Lichtman experienced her third

triple-double of the season and Janet
Okogbaa added 14 kills.
"It's not like you have to change life;
you have to continue to go through the
process that we're going through," said
head coach John Dunning. "We're a
combination of experienced players and
new players to the court, and we need
the new players to learn more and get
better every day."
And as long as the experienced play
ers continue to step up, the Card's fresh
faces on the court will have room to de
velop tempo and skill. With each game
come a new lesson and a new skill the
rookies on the court just need to be pa
tient and try to take as much of it in as
fast as they can.

Last weekend, No. 14 UCLA fell
against Arizona State 3-0 for the first
time since 1995, yet pulled a 3-1 win at
Arizona. UCLA sits sixth in the Pac-10
with a .500 winning percentage in the
conference and .733 overall. Last week
end, outside hitter Dicey McGraw regis
tered a season-high 20 kills against Ari
zona. She also hit her second straight
double-double of the season with 15
digs.
"UCLA is a very system-oriented
team they're very fast," Dunning
said. "They are one of the fastest teams
we've ever played again; great defensive
team. Their game is about dealing with

NOTES: Stanford women's volleyball hopes to re
deem itself after a rough start to Pac-10 play last
weekend, when they lost 3-2 to rival California.

zona State last weekend for the first time since
1995. Last weekend saw terrific games for the Car
