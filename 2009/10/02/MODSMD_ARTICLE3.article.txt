# VOLLEYBALL HEADS TO L.A.

### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The women's volleyball team (7-4
overall, 0-1 Pac-10) looks to recover
from last weekend's 3-2 loss against Cal
ifornia as it heads to Los Angeles to take
on UCLA (11-4 overall, 1-1 conference)
today and USC (12-2 overall, 1-1 confer
ence) on Saturday.
No. 11 Stanford dropped down a
notch in the rankings after a loss to rival
Cal last weekend. Though the loss may
seem like a setback for the team, the
scoreboard was the only negative aspect
of an otherwise exciting game. Alix
Klineman hit a season high of 23 kills,
Cassidy Lichtman experienced her third

triple-double of the season and Janet
Okogbaa added 14 kills.
"It's not like you have to change life;
you have to continue to go through the
process that we're going through," said
head coach John Dunning. "We're a
combination of experienced players and
new players to the court, and we need
the new players to learn more and get
better every day."
And as long as the experienced play
ers continue to step up, the Card's fresh
faces on the court will have room to de
velop tempo and skill. With each game
come a new lesson and a new skill the
rookies on the court just need to be pa
tient and try to take as much of it in as
fast as they can.

Last weekend, No. 14 UCLA fell
against Arizona State 3-0 for the first
time since 1995, yet pulled a 3-1 win at
Arizona. UCLA sits sixth in the Pac-10
with a .500 winning percentage in the
conference and .733 overall. Last week
end, outside hitter Dicey McGraw regis
tered a season-high 20 kills against Ari
zona. She also hit her second straight
double-double of the season with 15
digs.
"UCLA is a very system-oriented
team they're very fast," Dunning
said. "They are one of the fastest teams
we've ever played again; great defensive
team. Their game is about dealing with

After a heartbreaking five-set loss to Cal last week, the Cardinal faces another tough challenge this weekend, as the team travels south to take on UCLA and USC.


speed, so our practices this week are
dealing with the speed of the outside
sets because as soon as you change
the timing of things, it can catch you
all out of sync.
"We set it slower than they do and
our blockers need to get in sync with
their speed. Their outside hitters hit
it quicker than we do so our blockers
need to locate the block in order to
block and dig faster," he added.
Although UCLA is a smaller
team, size-wise, than Cal, Stanford

will have to adjust to its game to take
on Bruin freshman Lauren Cook,
who recorded 43 assists, six kills and
six digs at Arizona. Another Bruin
weapon comes in the form of Kaitlin
Sather, with nine kills and 12 digs.
Contrary to UCLA's fast-paced
game, the Card will have to switch
gears and take it down a bit to adjust

to No. 13 USC's slower rhythm. Al
though the Trojans play a slower
game, they will still put in a tough
fight, as they sit at No. 7 in the Pac-10.
While Arizona defeated the Trojans
3-1, USC outside hitter Alex Jupiter
shined in a 3-1 win against Arizona
State, as she hit a career-high of 31
kills along with 20 digs. Teammate
Jessica Gysin recorded a double
double that night as well with 19 kills
and 19 digs, and setter Kendall Bate
man registered a career-high 60 as
sists.
"You play Cal one night and you
practice for it because they're the
first team you play," Dunning said.
"Then you play USC and you can be
very out of sync because they set it
higher than anybody else we play.
They're a very experienced team;
they have almost everyone back
from last year."
The Trojans' 12-2 record reflects
their overall strength as a team. USC
has been strengthening the past cou
ple years and boasts a .857 overall
winning percentage, .500 in the con

ference.
But this weekend is more than
just playing experienced teams with
great hitters. These matches will be
all about adjusting and balancing for
the Card, speeding it up against
UCLA and slowing it down at USC.
Stanford looks to triumph this week
end as they plan to attack from all
sides.
"One of our goals is to attack with
balance, which we did at Cal, but the
right side wasn't successful," Dun
ning said. "So you either have to
choose to go away from it and set the
other people more, or you choose to
get better in this and keep the bal
ance. Defending us is much harder if
we keep it in balance and divide it
between the six hitters."
Look for Stanford to play a
smarter game this weekend and
keep its opponents on their toes in
Los Angeles. First serves are set for 7
p.m. on both nights.

come a new lesson and a new skill the
rookies on the court just need to be pa

fast as they can.

Last weekend, No. 14 UCLA fell
against Arizona State 3-0 for the first
time since 1995, yet pulled a 3-1 win at
Arizona. UCLA sits sixth in the Pac-10
with a .500 winning percentage in the
conference and .733 overall. Last week
end, outside hitter Dicey McGraw regis

double-double of the season with 15
digs.
"UCLA is a very system-oriented
team they're very fast," Dunning
said. "They are one of the fastest teams
we've ever played again; great defensive
team. Their game is about dealing with

After a heartbreaking five-set loss to Cal last week, the Cardinal faces another tough challenge this weekend, as the team travels south to take on UCLA and USC.


speed, so our practices this week are
dealing with the speed of the outside
sets because as soon as you change
the timing of things, it can catch you
all out of sync.
"We set it slower than they do and
our blockers need to get in sync with
their speed. Their outside hitters hit
it quicker than we do so our blockers
need to locate the block in order to
block and dig faster," he added.
Although UCLA is a smaller
team, size-wise, than Cal, Stanford

will have to adjust to its game to take
on Bruin freshman Lauren Cook,
who recorded 43 assists, six kills and
six digs at Arizona. Another Bruin
weapon comes in the form of Kaitlin
Sather, with nine kills and 12 digs.
Contrary to UCLA's fast-paced
game, the Card will have to switch
gears and take it down a bit to adjust

to No. 13 USC's slower rhythm. Al
though the Trojans play a slower
game, they will still put in a tough
fight, as they sit at No. 7 in the Pac-10.
While Arizona defeated the Trojans
3-1, USC outside hitter Alex Jupiter
shined in a 3-1 win against Arizona
State, as she hit a career-high of 31
kills along with 20 digs. Teammate
Jessica Gysin recorded a double
double that night as well with 19 kills
and 19 digs, and setter Kendall Bate
man registered a career-high 60 as
sists.
"You play Cal one night and you
practice for it because they're the
first team you play," Dunning said.
"Then you play USC and you can be
very out of sync because they set it
higher than anybody else we play.
They're a very experienced team;
they have almost everyone back
from last year."
The Trojans' 12-2 record reflects
their overall strength as a team. USC
has been strengthening the past cou
ple years and boasts a .857 overall
winning percentage, .500 in the con

ference.
But this weekend is more than
just playing experienced teams with
great hitters. These matches will be
all about adjusting and balancing for
the Card, speeding it up against
UCLA and slowing it down at USC.
Stanford looks to triumph this week
end as they plan to attack from all
sides.
"One of our goals is to attack with
balance, which we did at Cal, but the
right side wasn't successful," Dun
ning said. "So you either have to
choose to go away from it and set the
other people more, or you choose to
get better in this and keep the bal
ance. Defending us is much harder if
we keep it in balance and divide it
between the six hitters."
Look for Stanford to play a
smarter game this weekend and
keep its opponents on their toes in
Los Angeles. First serves are set for 7
p.m. on both nights.
