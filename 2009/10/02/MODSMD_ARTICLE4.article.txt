## New laws shift views on student loans SAFRA passes House, awaits decision in the Senate 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
Legislation is moving through Congress that would en
tirely reorganize the student loans market, and Stanford's
financial aid offices are reacting.
The loan reform legislation, entitled the Student Aid
and Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA), passed the
House of Representatives on Sept. 17 by a 253-171 mar
gin. While the bill must now move through the Senate,
SAFRA appears likely to become law in the near future.
SAFRA would, in addition to other educational initia
tives, transform the landscape for student lending. The bill
would do away with the current system of private, though
subsidized student lenders, by ending loans originated
through the Federal Family Education Loan Program
(FFELP). All loans would subsequently be originated
through the U.S. Department of Education, known as "di
rect lending," removing bankers and other non-govern
mental lending institutions from the student loan equa
tion. Direct lending exists currently, but previously has not
been the sole lending process.
Director of Financial Aid Karen Cooper said the ef
fects of the legislation would be more significant for Stan
ford's graduate population because the financial aid office
no longer expects that students will take on loans as part
of their financial aid package as of 2008-09.
"It's particularly for the graduate students that we're
involved with the loan programs," Cooper said, "although
undergraduates absolutely do borrow and take advantage
of the federal programs as well."
"[Many] graduate students, especially at the masters'
level, are using the federal programs to borrow their en
tire cost of attendance," she added.
While the bill would increase funding for college stu
dents, there would also be a significant reduction in
choice, with the Department of
Education serving as the sole lender.
This would eliminate Stanford stu
dents' ability to find their own deals
and lower rates than the one provid
ed by the government.
Cooper noted that Stanford stu
dents had, in the past, been desirable
customers for lending institutions,
due to perceived responsibility and
an expectation of steady employ
ment. Jack Edwards, director of
financial aid at the Graduate School
of Business, said the lack of choice
could be a potential long-term draw
back for business students, who had
often negotiated rates lower than the
government's in the years before the
current economic downturn.
"Our MBA students are willing to
take on more risk in search of lower
rates," Edwards said.
Cooper also had concerns about
the loss of choice. "I'd hate to see the
program entirely go away because I
think that it did do great things for
our students for a long time, and real
ly forced both our lenders and the
direct loan program to provide a bet
ter level of customer service for stu
dents," Cooper said. "Competition is
healthy."
Cooper nonetheless said the
reform was, on balance, a promising
step.
"Their hearts are in the right
places," she said. "We need simplifi
cation of the loan programs. Having
four major loan programs to choose
from is confusing to people when
they're in repayment, and, in away,
centralizing everything in the
Department of Education is good."
A switch, even without legislation?
Whether or not SAFRA passes
and the exact timeframe for its
implementation —is still unclear.
However, despite the outcome,
Cooper said she and the University's
other financial aid administrators
were likely to make the transition to
direct lending regardless of the legis
lation's passage.
"We have pretty much decided,
regardless of what happens with the
law, that we're going to make the
transition to direct lending," Cooper
said. "And we're going to aim for
next summer whether we're required
to or not, though if we weren't
required to, it would give us more
flexibility to do it when we're ready.
"We may still change our minds,"
she added, "but we're investigating
that, and we're very interested in
that."

Cooper said a prime motivation
came from a growing decline in the

quality of the current student loans
market. "The lenders are backing
out, making changes to their process
ing, and at this point I think the level
of customer service that we're able to
offer students is suffering," she said.
"What we have to work with, the
direct loan program is a better option
for students."
Administrative Transition
For financial aid offices, the shifts
involved in SAFRA would require
Stanford to make a significant transi
tion.
"Stanford has been a FFELP
school," Cooper said. "So, for our
Stafford loans, PLUS loans both
parent and graduate PLUS loans
students when they take those pro
grams use a lender to fund their loan.
So they're choosing between several
different, any, lending institution who
participates in the program, to get
their funding."
On the administrative end,
Stanford has one significant advan
tage over many other American uni
versities. Cooper pointed to manage
ment resources already in place
across all facets of Stanford financial
aid that are already equipped for the
change.
"We're not in bad shape to do that
because, as a large institution, we
already have a robust student admin
istration system in place," she said.
Edwards added that Stanford's
software put the University in a bet
ter position than smaller private uni
versities facing the same transition.
Cooper said that while the process
will be a handful for staff, she is con
fident the transition would be man
aged effectively.
"We've been seeing this coming
and we've been planning for it, so I'm
not concerned that we won't able to
get it done," she said.
The context for SAFRA and the
desired transition to direct lending,
however, is heavily affected by the
economic downturn. Edwards said
the current environment marked a
low point for private lending, and
expressed worry about a loss of
potential opportunities in future
years.
Cooper echoed this worry. "In five
years from now, if things have
changed in the economy, if the banks
are in a healthier position, might we
want to make a switch back?
Maybe."
Professional Schools
The legislation will also have par
ticular impacts on student popula
tions at Stanford's three professional
schools —the Schools of Business,
Law and Medicine in addition to
diminishing choice for loans, which
Edwards pointed to as a particular
issue for business school students.
Judith Romero, associate director

of media relations at the Law School,
raised concerns about whether
removing the core business of prior
student lenders will impact funding
availability when the government
will not step in to provide. She cited
the example of loans for law students
during their time studying for the bar
exam, which can be as high as
$15,000.
"Will private lenders continue to
offer this loan if they are to discon
tinue the bulk of their student lend
ing programs?" Romero wrote in an
email to The Daily. "If not, some
mechanism will have to be put in
place for students who need financial
support during bar exam study."
Martha Trujillo, director of finan
cial aid at the School of Medicine,
said the legislation would be a net
positive for students, and would elim
inate a barrier to a medical school
education by strengthening financial
support for students.
Perkins Loans
According to Cooper, the effect
of SAFRA remains unclear on
Perkins Loans, a cornerstone of
financial aid.
Currently, the Perkins loan is the
first-choice loan for low-income stu
dents.
"It's the simplest loan," Cooper
explained. "Stanford acts as the
lender. They are federal funds, it's a
revolving loan fund, so that students
who are in repayment we loan
their money back out to new stu
dents."
Depending on the bill's final lan

guage, Perkins loans could become
less friendly in their provisions, and
may also begin charging students
interest while they are in school.
"That would definitely impact
students," Cooper noted.
Pell Grants
According to Cooper, about 13 to
14 percent of the Stanford under
graduate population is typically eligi
ble for Pell Grants funding
intended for low-income students.
The amount Stanford receives is nor
mally $5 million a year. In its current
form, SAFRA would provide
approximately $4O billion in addi
tional funding for Pell Grants, and
Stanford would see an increase in
available funds.
Cooper said she expects that Pell
Grant funding would increase by a
number in the hundreds of thou
sands of dollars. "The increased Pell
Grant funding will help. It's just a
question of how much of an impact it
will have," she said.
Cooper added that the effect on
students would be minor.
"To the student, whether the
money comes from Pell or the
money comes from the University, it
doesn't make much of a difference;
they're still going to be fully-funded
whether they're eligible for a Pell
Grant or not," Cooper said. "That's
$5 million that we don't have to give
with institutional funds, so we can
spread that out to other students."

Stafford loans, PLUS loans both
parent and graduate PLUS loans
students when they take those pro
grams use a lender to fund their loan.
So they're choosing between several
different, any, lending institution who
participates in the program, to get
their funding."
On the administrative end,
Stanford has one significant advan
tage over many other American uni
versities. Cooper pointed to manage
ment resources already in place
across all facets of Stanford financial
aid that are already equipped for the
change.
"We're not in bad shape to do that
because, as a large institution, we
already have a robust student admin
istration system in place," she said.
Edwards added that Stanford's
software put the University in a bet
ter position than smaller private uni
versities facing the same transition.
Cooper said that while the process
will be a handful for staff, she is con
fident the transition would be man
aged effectively.
"We've been seeing this coming
and we've been planning for it, so I'm
not concerned that we won't able to
get it done," she said.
The context for SAFRA and the
desired transition to direct lending,
however, is heavily affected by the
economic downturn. Edwards said
the current environment marked a
low point for private lending, and
expressed worry about a loss of
potential opportunities in future
years.
Cooper echoed this worry. "In five
years from now, if things have
changed in the economy, if the banks
are in a healthier position, might we
want to make a switch back?
Maybe."
Professional Schools
The legislation will also have par
ticular impacts on student popula
tions at Stanford's three professional
schools —the Schools of Business,
Law and Medicine in addition to
diminishing choice for loans, which
Edwards pointed to as a particular
issue for business school students.
Judith Romero, associate director

of media relations at the Law School,
raised concerns about whether
removing the core business of prior
student lenders will impact funding
availability when the government
will not step in to provide. She cited
the example of loans for law students
during their time studying for the bar
exam, which can be as high as
$15,000.
"Will private lenders continue to
offer this loan if they are to discon
tinue the bulk of their student lend
ing programs?" Romero wrote in an
email to The Daily. "If not, some
mechanism will have to be put in
place for students who need financial
support during bar exam study."
Martha Trujillo, director of finan
cial aid at the School of Medicine,
said the legislation would be a net
positive for students, and would elim
inate a barrier to a medical school
education by strengthening financial
support for students.
Perkins Loans
According to Cooper, the effect
of SAFRA remains unclear on
Perkins Loans, a cornerstone of
financial aid.
Currently, the Perkins loan is the
first-choice loan for low-income stu
dents.
"It's the simplest loan," Cooper
explained. "Stanford acts as the
lender. They are federal funds, it's a
revolving loan fund, so that students
who are in repayment we loan
their money back out to new stu
dents."
Depending on the bill's final lan

guage, Perkins loans could become
less friendly in their provisions, and
may also begin charging students
interest while they are in school.
"That would definitely impact
students," Cooper noted.
Pell Grants
According to Cooper, about 13 to
14 percent of the Stanford under
graduate population is typically eligi
ble for Pell Grants funding
intended for low-income students.
The amount Stanford receives is nor
mally $5 million a year. In its current
form, SAFRA would provide
approximately $4O billion in addi
tional funding for Pell Grants, and
Stanford would see an increase in
available funds.
Cooper said she expects that Pell
Grant funding would increase by a
number in the hundreds of thou
sands of dollars. "The increased Pell
Grant funding will help. It's just a
question of how much of an impact it
will have," she said.
Cooper added that the effect on
students would be minor.
"To the student, whether the
money comes from Pell or the
money comes from the University, it
doesn't make much of a difference;
they're still going to be fully-funded
whether they're eligible for a Pell
Grant or not," Cooper said. "That's
$5 million that we don't have to give
with institutional funds, so we can
spread that out to other students."

DAILY STAFF/The Stanford Daily
Legislation is moving through Congress that would en
tirely reorganize the student loans market, and Stanford's
financial aid offices are reacting.
The loan reform legislation, entitled the Student Aid
and Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA), passed the
House of Representatives on Sept. 17 by a 253-171 mar
gin. While the bill must now move through the Senate,
SAFRA appears likely to become law in the near future.
SAFRA would, in addition to other educational initia
tives, transform the landscape for student lending. The bill
would do away with the current system of private, though
subsidized student lenders, by ending loans originated
through the Federal Family Education Loan Program
(FFELP). All loans would subsequently be originated
through the U.S. Department of Education, known as "di
rect lending," removing bankers and other non-govern
mental lending institutions from the student loan equa
tion. Direct lending exists currently, but previously has not
been the sole lending process.
Director of Financial Aid Karen Cooper said the ef
fects of the legislation would be more significant for Stan
ford's graduate population because the financial aid office
no longer expects that students will take on loans as part
of their financial aid package as of 2008-09.
"It's particularly for the graduate students that we're
involved with the loan programs," Cooper said, "although
undergraduates absolutely do borrow and take advantage
of the federal programs as well."
"[Many] graduate students, especially at the masters'
level, are using the federal programs to borrow their en
tire cost of attendance," she added.
While the bill would increase funding for college stu
dents, there would also be a significant reduction in
choice, with the Department of
Education serving as the sole lender.
This would eliminate Stanford stu
dents' ability to find their own deals
and lower rates than the one provid
ed by the government.
Cooper noted that Stanford stu
dents had, in the past, been desirable
customers for lending institutions,
due to perceived responsibility and
an expectation of steady employ
ment. Jack Edwards, director of
financial aid at the Graduate School
of Business, said the lack of choice
could be a potential long-term draw
back for business students, who had
often negotiated rates lower than the
government's in the years before the
current economic downturn.
"Our MBA students are willing to
take on more risk in search of lower
rates," Edwards said.
Cooper also had concerns about
the loss of choice. "I'd hate to see the
program entirely go away because I
think that it did do great things for
our students for a long time, and real
ly forced both our lenders and the
direct loan program to provide a bet
ter level of customer service for stu
dents," Cooper said. "Competition is
healthy."
Cooper nonetheless said the
reform was, on balance, a promising
step.
"Their hearts are in the right
places," she said. "We need simplifi
cation of the loan programs. Having
four major loan programs to choose
from is confusing to people when
they're in repayment, and, in away,
centralizing everything in the
Department of Education is good."
A switch, even without legislation?
Whether or not SAFRA passes
and the exact timeframe for its
implementation —is still unclear.
However, despite the outcome,
Cooper said she and the University's
other financial aid administrators
were likely to make the transition to
direct lending regardless of the legis
lation's passage.
"We have pretty much decided,
regardless of what happens with the
law, that we're going to make the
transition to direct lending," Cooper
said. "And we're going to aim for
next summer whether we're required
to or not, though if we weren't
required to, it would give us more
flexibility to do it when we're ready.
"We may still change our minds,"
she added, "but we're investigating
that, and we're very interested in
that."

Cooper said a prime motivation
came from a growing decline in the

quality of the current student loans
market. "The lenders are backing
out, making changes to their process
ing, and at this point I think the level
of customer service that we're able to
offer students is suffering," she said.
"What we have to work with, the
direct loan program is a better option
for students."
Administrative Transition
For financial aid offices, the shifts
involved in SAFRA would require
Stanford to make a significant transi
tion.
"Stanford has been a FFELP
school," Cooper said. "So, for our
Stafford loans, PLUS loans both
parent and graduate PLUS loans
students when they take those pro
grams use a lender to fund their loan.
So they're choosing between several
different, any, lending institution who
participates in the program, to get
