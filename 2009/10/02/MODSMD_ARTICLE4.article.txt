Legislation is moving through Congress that would en
tirely reorganize the student loans market, and Stanford's
financial aid offices are reacting.
The loan reform legislation, entitled the Student Aid
and Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA), passed the
House of Representatives on Sept. 17 by a 253-171 mar

SAFRA appears likely to become law in the near future.
SAFRA would, in addition to other educational initia

would do away with the current system of private, though
subsidized student lenders, by ending loans originated
through the Federal Family Education Loan Program
(FFELP). All loans would subsequently be originated
through the U.S. Department of Education, known as "di

been the sole lending process.
Director of Financial Aid Karen Cooper said the ef

ford's graduate population because the financial aid office
no longer expects that students will take on loans as part
of their financial aid package as of 2008-09.
"It's particularly for the graduate students that we're
involved with the loan programs," Cooper said, "although
undergraduates absolutely do borrow and take advantage
of the federal programs as well."
"[Many] graduate students, especially at the masters'
level, are using the federal programs to borrow their en

While the bill would increase funding for college stu
