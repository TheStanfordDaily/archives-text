## THE 						MARKET AT MUNGER New store caters to grad students 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Market at Munger, geared toward
graduate students, opened its gates last
month, with shelves packed with organic,
local, fresh and pre-packaged foods.
Stanford's first catch-all market has already
attracted attention from students residing
in and around the Munger complex.
"It's great to have something very
close," said Vanessa Fieusa LLM 'lO. "I
found almost everything I needed."
According to Will Snyder, a cashier at
The Market, the master plan for the
Market waffled back and forth several

times and was initially intended to be a
convenience store kind of the Tresidder
Express mold.
The selected model, however, adapts the
convenience of a local express shop with
the class of an upscale market. With equal
parts natural organic and run of the mill
junk food, the market also packs a mean
punch of caffeine with a self-serve espresso
machine. For the pricier palate, there are
fresh baguettes and Pellegrino to boot.
The Market anticipates the opening of
its partner cafe. Both operations will be
run by Stanford Hospitality in a collabora
tive effort to provide students with fresh
and local produce as well as hot bites, cold

foods and ready-made meals that can be
popped into the oven or microwave at
home. The Market currently relies on
Tresidder for its hot meals, pre-packed sal
ads and breads, but once Cafe Russo is up
and running, hot food and pre-packaged
meals will be made on site.

Munger General Manager Joel Sage
mentioned that Cafe Russo, adjacent to
The Market at Munger, will serve New
York-style deli sandwiches and pizza. The
soon-to-be grad-hideout will also serve
wine and beer.

Paul Breast Hall, located next door to
the cafe and market, can seat up to 300
people and will allow the Munger services

to provide catering as well.
While the particular details of the
restaurant-like Cafe Russo will remain
under wraps until its opening in
November, Mr. Sage did reveal that it will
be using China, biodegradable utensils and
reusable shopping bags, much like CoHo,
and fitting of the University's support of
green living.
Some students who have already
checked out the new market feel it may
not be the hotspot for those in search of
cheap or easy snacks and dinners.
"[There is] way too much organic food,"
Ken Shin, a second-year law student
remarked, hoping that the Market will

pack more ready-to-eat meals.
The superior quality and range of choice
of organic and local food at Munger will
not affect an equally high raise in the cost
of its meals and produce to students, Sage
promised, adding that with the anticipated
high traffic of regular customers, prices can
be kept affordable for all students.

But will Cafe Russo or The Market at
Munger need to compete with other cam
pus favorites for the mouths of hungry stu
dents? Sage thinks not.
"We are trying to be different with a
very high quality of meal," he said.

The Market at Munger opened last month and has thus far attracted a number of curious graduate students through its glass doors. Cafe Russo, an upscale eatery, will open in November across from the new market.
