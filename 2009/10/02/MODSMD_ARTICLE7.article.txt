## Prof. leaves for NSC work Weinstein has spent years studying developing democracies 
### RYAN MAYFIELD 
Appointed as director for democracy on the
National Security Council, political science Prof.
Jeremy Weinstein says he is working toward
President Obama's pledge to support world devel
opment.

"From the very beginning, the president has
made clear commitments in the course of the cam
paigning around developments and around a
strong leadership role in supporting development
overseas," Weinstein said. "[l'm] happy to be a
part of putting that into practice."
Weinstein was unable to divulge the exact
details of his work for the sake of national secu
rity.

Weinstein came to Stanford in 2004 and has
spent much of the past five years researching key
international issues, focusing a great deal on
developing democracies in Africa. According to
Prof. Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institute and Weinstein's coworker,
Weinstein performed "experimental research in

Uganda to see how public accountability of legis
latures might be enhanced," increasing the trans
parency of Ugandan democracy.
Weinstein also worked on a project based in
Liberia in which he worked alongside an NGO to

study how villagers were affected by
state building in local communities.
He has also worked to analyze civil
conflict, particularly the role of
rebel and insurgent groups.
"A lot of my research has been
policy-orientated research, [includ
ing] how to rebuild countries in the
aftermath of a war," Weinstein said.
"Those projects have been hugely
informative in how I view ... U.S.
[policy] in post-conflict Liberia or
Congo.
"For me, it's always been a prior
ity to orient my research to ques
tions that are of immediate rele
vance to policy makers," he added.
Using his research experiences,
Weinstein has written a pair of
books and multiple articles for
political science journals. He
received a number of awards for his
research, most recently the Dean's
Award for Distinguished Teaching

at Stanford.
"Stanford is the sort of center of
excellence for research on the inter
section of issues of governance, the
rule of law and economic develop
ment," Weinstein said.
Weinstein's first experience
working in government came in the
late '9os, under the Clinton adminis
tration for the NSC. Before Obama
was elected in 2008, Weinstein
worked as part of his presidential
campaign serving as chair of the

Committee on Democracy and
Governance.

Yet, while Weinstein has been
influential in the White House, he
has also devoted a great deal of time
to his students. Stephanie
Majerowicz 'lO took her first class
with Weinstein fall quarter of her
freshman year.
"I basically owe him everything
I've ever done at Stanford, academ
ically at least," she said. "He took
me on as a research assistant fresh
man year without any research
experience."
Although Stanford is losing a
prominent mind on campus for the
time being, the country surely will
gain insight into democratic
advancement during Weinstein's
term.

"What's most valuable to me at
Stanford are my relationships with
my undergraduate and graduate
students," Weinstein said. "That's a
part of my life that I can't really turn
off."
