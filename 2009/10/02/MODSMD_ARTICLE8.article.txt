# ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS
## Human rights program to launch Focus will be on both gov't and non-gov't factors 
### TROY YANG 
A new human rights program will
change the way academic departments
and student groups conduct human
rights-related research and activities.
Coordinated by Helen Stacy, a senior
lecturer at the Law School, the program
will launch on Oct. 14 under the Center
on Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law (CDDRL), featuring speak
ers from several academic departments
including law, engineering, political sci
ence and medicine. The purpose of this
new program, according to Adam
Rosenblatt, a Ph.D. candidate in modern
thought and literature, is to get dialogue
about human rights scholarship across
disciplinary divides.
"Because it touches almost every
sphere of human life, human rights schol
arship has become an interdisciplinary
venture," Rosenblatt said. "For example,
you have people in literature writing
about human rights in the novel and you
have anthropologists studying a particu
lar women's human rights movement in

a country in Africa or Southeast Asia."
For many students, this new program
will provide a central academic group
that will deal with human rights, some
thing Stanford has lacked until now.

"We want to make sure we learn from
each other and pool our energies," Stacy
said. "And also to create a critical mass of
human rights professors for students to
access from across the University.
"[CDDRL] is interested in bridging
the worlds between academic work and
real life outcomes," Stacy continued.
Faculty members expect this "bridge"
to be directed toward both governments
and non-government actors who shape
human rights policy.
Students with a strong interest in
human rights seem receptive, even
enthusiastic, about this program, with the
prospect of a centralized human rights
program arousing hopes from under
graduate and graduate students alike.
"I've been waiting since I got here
almost four and a half years ago for an
interdisciplinary human rights center,"
Rosenblatt said.

Anjali Albuquerque 'll echoed that
sentiment. "There was really no central
ized academic group that dealt with
human rights," she said. "At Stanford,
what we have are a lot of niches."

The goals of this program are many,
but there is, as of now, no set template for
how it will operate. There are, however,
ideas of it acting as a clearinghouse or as
a platform for faculty-related research,
as well as away to grow the program of
student internships by working with the
Haas Center and the McCoy Family
Center.

"The outcome, we hope, is that there
will be more human rights-related
research among faculty and more human
rights activity among students," Stacy
said.
