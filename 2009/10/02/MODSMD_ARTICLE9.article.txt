## Op-Ed A 						New Itinerary for Overseas Studies 
### 
When Stanford launched the Interna
tional Initiative in 2005 to expand
research on global challenges, it
noted, "All levels of society must reassess
what they do and how they do it, and Stanford
is no exception." Today, that spirit of reinven
tion is needed once more to change the way
Stanford students choose to 'burst the bub
ble.'

Stanford has a proud history of leading
students to the edges of the world, to help us
understand problems on the horizon and
then incorporate them into our studies and
lives: In 1958, an intrepid group of Stanford
undergrads embarked on the University's
first study abroad program in postwar Ger
many, a country still emerging from the rav
ages of World War II and squarely in the shad
ow of the Iron Curtain. In the last five
decades, University administrators have
sagely continued to recognize the formative
effects of studying abroad and substantially
expanded overseas houses, seminars and fel
lowships.
But today, key regions of the world lie out
of reach for most Stanford students. In partic
ular, there are few or no overseas opportuni
ties in the Middle East and Central Asia

areas that are often at the forefront of today's
most crucial challenges in governance, glob
alization and international security.
Stanford should expand students' abilities
to learn about world affairs and extend the
University's global reach by taking three spe
cific steps:
First, partner with other universities and
non-profits to increase exchange programs
and study abroad opportunities in these over
looked regions. There are understandable
limits on Stanford's financial resources, espe
cially in today's economy. But the University
need not construct a Stanford House in every
corner of the world. Instead, it should pool re
sources with other educational institutions in
ways that expand its worldwide engagement
while maintaining academic quality.
Second, reconsider the University's inter
national travel policy, which bans all expen
ditures for undergraduate studies in nations
with State Department travel warnings.
Stanford prides itself on providing under
grads with extraordinary opportunities to
chart their own intellectual paths. But this
policy prevents travel in 26 countries
more than 13 percent of the world's nations
and confines students' intellectual initia

tive there. Other U.S. universities have been
able to safely establish educational pro
grams in some countries with travel warn
ings, including Israel, Colombia and the
Philippines, which are fertile ground for stu
dents of international affairs, languages and
beyond.
While we do not take these warnings light
ly, the University can mitigate risks of acci
dents or crime by requiring students to un
dergo safety training before departure, as
many federal agencies and international
companies do. Stanford could also require
students to buy travel insurance and confer
with the General Counsel's office in order to
fully understand and disclaim the Universi
ty's legal liabilities. Ultimately, some risk of
crime or attacks may sadly be unavoidable
even in seemingly serene countries, like
South Africa or Spain, where Stanford still
has overseas programs.
Third, empower students to organize over
seas opportunities themselves. For example,
in 2005, at the apex of the sectarian civil war
in Iraq, Stanford students (including the au
thors) started one of the first exchange pro
grams in postwar Iraq, which the University
boldly funded. Four Iraqi students twice
braved "bandits' highway" just for the chance
to visit the Farm and ended up teaching us
all a great deal about courage, everyday life in
Iraq and the some of the challenges facing the
Middle East. Conversely, visiting Iraq makes
its stories and struggles more real than photos
or articles alone can convey, as both the au
thors have found. Today, Stanford students
should reach out to the American University
of Iraq, whose provost, Joshua Mitchell,
would welcome Stanford grads to apply to
teach English at its new campus in the safer
parts of northern Iraq.
Part of the intangible value of "bursting
the bubble" is the moment when students are
able to animate ideas off the pages of a text
book and into their full real-life context. By
developing our overseas programs, we can
provide Stanford students with new opportu
nities to fathom critical countries and cultures
and to face some of today's myriad global
challenges. And perhaps we can even help
others better understand us as well.
