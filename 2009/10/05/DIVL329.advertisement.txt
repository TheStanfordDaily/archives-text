There are some financial firms where technology doesn't take a back seat. The D. E. Shaw group
is a highly successful investment and technology development firm with an international
reputation and a decidedly different approach to doing business. We offer a stimulating work
environment and colleagues from the strongest technical programs in the world. They're not
conventional "financial types," but then again, neither are we.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative analysis, software development, proprietary
trading, and information technology, to name a few. Our work environment is challenging but
surprisingly flexible â€”from the clothes you wear to the time you get to the office, it's pretty much
up to you. And we compensate our extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
