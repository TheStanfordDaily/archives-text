## Op-Ed Chicago: Crying for a Different Kind of Attention 
### CAMERON DRAKE Class of 2010 
This past week, I was disappointed by
the news that Chicago's bid to host the
2016 Summer Olympic Games had
come to a surprisingly unsuccessful end. The
list of celebrities and leaders who supported
this bid was impressive, from musicians to
President Obama. 1 was born and raised on
Chicago's south side in the Roseland neigh
borhood; therefore, the prospect of my
hometown hosting the most prominent inter
national event in the world intrigued me. My
imagination was already running wild with
dreams of inviting all of my friends back to
my home and showing all of them why my
hometown is the greatest in the world. Ironi
cally, there was one major impediment to
making these visions a reality: I don't go
home to Chicago.
It is a confession that I make with a great
deal of shame: Since arriving on the Farm as
a freshman, I have returned to Chicago less
and less each year. This fact may dumbfound
most of my friends, since anyone who knows
me knows that I am very proud to be from
the Second City. But a week ago, people
around the world got a glimpse into the truth
behind my situation. My city was attracting a
lot of attention last week not because of its
bid for the Olympics, but because of a video
that surfaced, one in which a young kid by the
name of Derrion Albert was horrifically
beaten to death in broad daylight.
I was struck by this video quite differently
than the average viewer. Where most people
would be numbed by the horrific actions that
this video captures, I was left unfazed.This, to
me, was nothing new. My entire life in Chica
go was scarred by the periodic eruptions of
violence that left friends, family and
strangers hurt, even dead. Derrion was an
honors kid who went to school within walk
ing distance from my home. He found him
self in the middle of a sudden street war and
unexpectedly paid the ultimate price that af
ternoon. Having experienced similar situa
tions, I was instantly flooded with the kind of
fear I am sure Derrion had as well. I began to
think of the many people in my life who were
taken away by violence young people
whose fleeting time on this earth was cut dra
matically short. I thought about how easily I
could have been Derrion.
Horrendous stories like this occur all over
the world and are by no means unique to my
town, but the extraordinary nature of this
event is amplified in light of Chicago's cur

rent juxtaposition. In many respects, the city
is more renowned today than ever before.
With the President of the United States on
the long list of those who consider Chicago
home, it has become nearly impossible to ig
nore the city's prominence as a world leader.
The city put on its best face for the Olympic
committee, and at its best it is a brilliant place.
Unfortunately, the Derrion Albert video
showed us a very different side of Chicago, a
side that has become increasingly frighten
ing. The number of Chicago students fatally
shot in the 2006-2007 school year stood at 24.
There were 23 deaths and 211 shootings in
the 2007-2008 school year, and 34 deaths and
290 shootings the last school year.
I grew up constantly surrounded by the
worst the city had to offer, but was comforted
by my own ambitions. In order to further my
ambitions, I decided to leave the south side
behind. I could not ignore the shame that I
felt while watching the Derrion Albert video,
considering that just last month a friend and
neighbor was walking down the street and
killed by a stray bullet. He was a soldier on
leave visiting home, and I didn't go to his fu
neral because I was too afraid of suffering a
similar fate.
Immediately, any disappointment that I
felt from Chicago's losing the bid for the
Olympics evaporated. It quickly became sar
donic to consider the energy and commit
ment that had been dedicated to this bid
while Chicago concludes one of its most vio
lent seasons in history. The city obviously
wants to further its own ambitions and be
come the world leader that it can and should
be. However, this does not justify what could
be considered a misallocation of resources.
The president was presumably a little jet
lagged by his flight home from his final
Olympic pitch in Copenhagen, which may
partially explain his absence from Derrion
Albert's funeral. I have faith that someday
Chicago will be ready to host the world, but
that day is clearly not today. With the most ur
gency I can muster, I implore the City of
Chicago, all of those people around the coun
try who supported our bid, and especially the
president: Do not forget the parts of Chicago
that do not show up on the billboards and in
commercials. They are dying for our atten
tion; let's not ignore them.
