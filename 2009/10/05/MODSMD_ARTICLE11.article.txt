# GIRL, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## Bold Stance: Anti-Child Rape 
### Jordan Carr 
I could not have been more excited to see
Roman Polanski get lured to Switzerland
and arrested via the almost cliched ruse of
awarding him a "Golden Icon Award" at the
Zurich Film Festival. For those of you unfa
miliar with his crime, allow me to explain. In
1977, Polanski invited a 13-year-old girl
named Samantha Geimer over to pose for
French Vogue. Geimer testified that after he
plied her with champagne and Quaaludes
(Ben Stein's favorite drug), Polanski had sex
ual intercourse with her and sodomized her
despite her protests. Polanski pled guilty to
unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor so as
to receive a lighter sentence.
When it began to appear his sentencing
was going to involve prison time (people get
raped in prison!) rather than just a psychi
atric evaluation, Polanski fled to France; he
has not returned to America since. Polanski's
arrest now he's owned a home in Switzer
land for years is likely the result of him
having the sheer balls to request his case be
dismissed, despite the fact that he had al
ready pled guilty to the crimes.
His arrest is good news, right? We caught
a child rapist and he will likely return to
America to face the music. Well, some say
not. For your convenience, and the sake of
fairness, I've laid out their arguments.
First and foremost, he survived the Holo
caust. I was under the impression that the
Holocaust showed the disastrous conse
quences of treating people as subhuman, but
apparently it just gives license to its victims to
treat everyone however they want. My bad.
Second, his pregnant wife Sharon Tate was
killed as part of the Manson family murders in
1969. It seems having a terrible tragedy of that
magnitude means the law doesn't apply to you
for a decade or so afterward.
Third, the judge was mean to him. At first
he made it seem like Polanski wasn't going to
have to go to jail and then the Polanski camp
came to believe that prison time would occur.
Since when did pleading guilty to a crime en
tail throwing yourself to the mercy of the
legal system?
Fourth, he made some really good movies.
"Chinatown," "Rosemary's Baby" and "The
Pianist" are all bona fide classics. I'll let the
text of a petition signed by Pedro Almod
ovar, Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson and, in
a tremendously unhelpful show of moral
consistency, Woody Allen explain why it was
unfair to nab Polanski when he was attending

a film festival:

"By their extraterritorial nature, film fes
tivals the world over have always permitted
works to be shown and for filmmakers to
present them freely and safely, even when
certain states opposed this."
Sorry, Roman, but this is a child rape pros
ecution, not a game of tag. Film festivals are
not some magical home base where nobody
can touch you. If you publicly disclose your
schedule and are a fugitive child rapist, you
run the risk of arrest.
Everything isn't bad for Mr. Polanski. If he
plays his cards right, he should be able to gain
one powerful ally: God. Perhaps you've
heard of him. This week, the Vatican read a
statement at the United Nations saying that
only 1.5 to five percent of its priests were
child molesters, and that pedophilia wasn't
really the right term for what they were
doing. The Vatican preferred ephebophilia,
which classifies them as homosexuals with an
attraction to boys aged 11 to 17. The problem
isn't a system that allows for rampant child
molestation; it's semantics. The ghost of
William Safire couldn't be prouder. The
statement also went on to point a finger at
other religions, calling them (and I para
phrase here) similarly rapey.
Atheists Milan Kundera and Salman
Rushdie (author of "The Satanic Verses")
have been cited as supporters of Polanski's
while Pope Benedict XVI is standing behind
the organizational methods that have moved
to actively protect child molesters for
decades, if not centuries. It seems particular
things matter more to some people than pro
tecting a child, including the independence of
artists, an institution's air of infallibility or just
simply defending one of your own regardless
of the circumstances and evidence.
The Wellness Room is still open.
