# THE 						DUDE ABIDES
## "Sometimes, you eat the (Golden) bear ..." 
### Zack Warma 
While this humble excuse for a col
umn has been castigated for alleged
"homerism" regarding this author's
loyalties, I just want to say that frankly I
couldn't give less of a damn. I stand before
you today, oh esteemed Daily readership, to
pontificate on a subject that literally renders
me a less cool, chain-smoking Louis Arm
strong.
For three and half hours Saturday after
noon, adorned in a fading red T-shirt, my
cheap five dollar aviators and a soul full of
hate, 42,000 other fans and I witnessed the ex
hilarating 24-16 Cardinal victory over
fUCLA. Jumping, hooting and screaming
mildly unprintable remarks toward the boys
from Los Angeles, this profane pigskin ver
sion of a 19th century religious awakening is a
rightful cornerstone of my time so far at Stan,
and my life as a whole.
Being a sports fan is about community,
heartbreak and hope. It's about bonding with
people whom you shall interact solely with
high fives or fist pumps, but whose well-being
will be directly wedded to your very own de
sires or nightmares, depending on how well
the defensive line is protecting the long ball.
It's about a sea of otherwise disparate individ
uals with individual backgrounds and circum
stances nonetheless binding together over a
common goal, or common enemy (FUCK
USC!!!).
A sports fan carries particular dreams in
tow (bowl game, victories over hated foes,
world peace, the nuking of L.A. Coliseum,
etc.), often to watch them be snatched away
as the time clock clicks to zero. But as we
watch the ball float helplessly out of the re
ceiver's hands, we are also provided with the
new hope of each recruiting class, every S.J.
State game and the buzz that comes with
beating undefeated teams (suck it, UCLA).
Unless you still hold the Supersonics, Oilers
or Expos near and dear to your heart, in
sports as in life, there will most often be an
other chance at redemption.
Since I was 15 and realized that my inabil
ity to shut up, coupled with a high level of in
ternalized venom, was a strong formula for
being a good fan, I have felt right at home in a

sea of body paint, hand-made signs and foam
fingers. I have rushed the floor of my high
school gym after snapping a particularly long
losing streak to an over-priced private high
school (that's right St. Augustine, that's right.
..). I have been nearly thrown out of arenas
for choosing to question inane policies,
threatened with physical violence, and almost
rendered to tears out of shear emotional ex
haustion. Nobody said being a fan was easy.
Coming to Stanford has not tampered this
enthusiasm, however. Crushing interceptions,
Gerhart plummeting his way through defend
ers, the Band striking up "All Right Now" for
the eighth time that afternoon, and me danc
ing as stupidly and poorly as I did before kick

off yes, I get all a-titter over history and
politics (more so than I should ever readily
admit to in mixed company), but the sweet
emotional anguish that emanates from Stan
ford Stadium is physically impossible to du
plicate in alternative settings.
The Stanford football experience speaks
volumes to the institution. Operating in a
multimillion-dollar stadium complete with
the finest amenities, one can still sense the ab
sence of a valued history. Armed with a loyal,
but undersized community following, the
upper rows of the stadium stare blankly back
at the student section, making sure that we re
alize that Michigan or Nebraska or Bama
or for different reasons a Princeton we
ain't. The student section is hearty, but has
been known to have individuals sitting in the
front rows reading Orwell (I saw this at Big
Game two years ago. I almost cried). Many
people feel they have better things to do for
those three hours, or show up for the first half,
or merely go tailgating and then do whatever.
But for a school suckled on the attractive
power of identity politics, the stadium is the
great equalizer. I have never felt tied to any
particular "community," group or any num
ber of the social identifiers/markers we Stan
ford students use to make sense of one anoth
er. However, I am never more comfortable
than when placed in the middle of a Cardinal
clad student section, of faces both familiar
and foreign, all yelling and praying and hop
ing for the same desired outcome for the men
sporting the glorious "S."
Just as everyone is equal within the eyes of
God and law, so, too, do distinctions evapo
rate in the House of Harbaugh, just as long as
you are wearing cardinal red. And with the
stadium splashed in the beautiful dusk hues
of Northern California, the crowd crying out
after another Toby TD, and our ass-kicking
Band kicking up those familiar tunes, honest
to God, everything is ALL RIGHT NOW!

Zack is looking for a good place to watch Stan
ford beat Oregon State next week. Hankerin'
for some ridiculous company? Email Zack an
