## Universities team for open-source Robot Operating System 
### ANN TYLER MOSES 
Two years ago, computer science graduate
student Morgan Quigley had an idea: an open
source programming framework for robots
that would improve collaboration between
researchers. Now, his Robot Operating System
(ROS) has caught the attention of universities
and research groups worldwide.
Menlo Park-based research group Willow
Garage has taken the lead on the project, while
teams from universities such as Carnegie
Mellon, USC, MIT and the Technical University
of Munich are also developing ROS.
ROS allows robotics developers to unify the

functions of a single robot and easily share and
build upon fellow researchers' innovations.
The idea first occurred to Quigley in 2007,
when he served as a teaching assistant for a
class in which students wrote programs in hopes
of combining them at the end of the course.
"It was hard to do that without some sort of
framework or overall architecture," he said.
"Someone could write a program that does
object recognition and someone could write a
code to pick up the object, but unless [the pro
grammers] have actually thought about the
architecture, those two programs can't talk to
each other very easily."
According to Quigley's advisor, computer

science Prof. Andrew Ng, ROS allows for "a
deeper level of integration of software from
traditionally separate areas."
For example, a robot currently employed in
the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab was
equipped to find and retrieve a stapler. This
simple task required, among many other appli
cations, computational vision (to find the sta
pler) and robotic manipulation (to grasp it)
two strategies developed in isolation from each
other.
Before ROS, these two functions would
have worked in opposition or at best alongside
each other; with ROS, the process of picking up
the stapler gives the robot a better sense of its

visual location and vice versa each maneu
ver aids the function of the other.
In addition, ROS allows multiple teams to
work simultaneously on one robot coopera
tion that was previously difficult in the robotics
world due to the lack of a common platform.
Now, roboticists can use ROS to share and
reuse programs, and thus devote all of their
energy to innovation.
"The grand goal of the whole enterprise is
to be able to integrate all these various sub
fields of artificial intelligence into one working
platform, so one physical robot can run the

work of many different people at
one time," Quigley said. Or, in lay
man's terms, "ROS is this idea of
tying together tons and tons of soft
ware so that a robot can do all sorts
of stuff."
In Ng's view, ROS heralds a new
future in robotics. "Our goal is to
put a robot in every home â€”to
have that general-purpose, house
cleaning, tidying-up robot that sci
ence fiction has promised us for
decades now but that we still don't
have today," he said.
