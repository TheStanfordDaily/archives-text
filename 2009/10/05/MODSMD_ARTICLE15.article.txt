# HONORS & AWARDS
## Siebel awards 15 students 
### ALYSSA AHLUWALIA 
Fifteen students from Stanford's graduate
departments were awarded tuition grants of
$35,000 and the title of 2010 Siebel Scholar
last month by the Siebel Foundation.
The Siebel Foundation, founded in 1996, is
a non-profit benefit corporation intended to
recognize and bring together 80 talented stu
dents a year from the fields of bioengineer
ing, computer science and business. Students
are chosen from 11 of the nation's leading
universities.

Julia Chen, Christina Fan, Douglas Jones,
Andrea Les and Chuba Oyolu were honored
as Siebel Scholars within the Department of
Bioengineering. Graduate School of Business
recipients included Ashley Evans, Kenneth
Hammond, Andrew Martin, Matthew
Skaruppa and lain Ware. And from the
Computer Science Department, graduate
students Tom Dillig, Shaddin Dughmi, Daniel
Gibson, Daniel Horn and Edward Luong
were selected.

"The Scholars program creates an active
community of interactive students just about
to enter the 'real world,"' said Jenny
Hildebrand, Siebel program manager. "The
network we create fosters collaboration and
exchange of ideas between leading minds
representing all different academic disci
plines."

The Siebel Scholars are graduate students
in the final years of their studies. University
faculty choose scholars based on outstanding
academic merit and leadership, but as a rule,

the particulars of the nomination process are
kept vague.

"We're not made aware of the
professors/staff who nominate us," Martin
said in an email to The Daily. "Indeed, there
isn't much visibility into the selection
process."

Nevertheless, having a graduate student
population under consideration for the pres
tigious title allows Stanford University to
have an active role in the Siebel Scholars
community.

"The main office in downtown Palo Alto
allows for smaller-scale group conferences,
and we have meetings on Stanford's campus,"
Hildebrand said.

The network of over 540 past and present
scholars also engages in yearly conferences
that have in the past focused on topics such as
global terrorism (2001), stem cell research
(2002), methamphetamine use in America
(2004) and water conservation (2009).
These conferences often forge partner
ships between universities, such as a joint
project between Stanford and UC-Berkeley
in 2002 for a project concerning stem cell
research.

According to the foundation's Web site,
the overall goal is "to support projects and
organizations that work to improve the qual
ity of life, environment and education of its
community members," with the hope of alle
viating societal problems stemming from hot
button issues.
"[Siebel Scholars] are very differ
ent people given the means to inter
act in the professional world so that
they can improve upon and affect
aspects of society immediately and
for the better," said Nitsa Zuppas,
executive director of the Siebel
Foundation. "These are our best and
brightest our future."
