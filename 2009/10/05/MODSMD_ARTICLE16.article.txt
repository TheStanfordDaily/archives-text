## SOUTHERN SUCCESS After slow starts, Card secures two wins in L.A. 
### CHRIS JUHNKE 
After a tough loss to California last Friday, the
No. 11 Stanford women's volleyball team rebound
ed with two solid wins in Southern California this
weekend. The Card defeated No. 16 UCLA 20-25,
25-20,25-21,25-20 on Friday night in Pauley Pavil
ion before sweeping No. 13 USC 25-23,35-33,25-18
on Saturday night to cap off an impressive road trip.
Junior Cassidy Lichtman said the wins were im
portant to set a tone for Stanford's tough confer
ence season.
"This weekend was definitely a breakthrough
for us," she said. "To get two wins on the road against
teams with such strong traditions as USC and
UCLA gives us a lot more confidence as we contin
ue in the Pac-10."
The Cardinal trailed early in the UCLA match,
with UCLA opening to a quick 6-1 lead in the first
set. However, after a timeout by Stanford Coach
John Dunning, the Card earned three quick points,
two off of service errors by the Bruins.
Junior Alix Klineman, who led the Card with 23
kills, said the timeout came at a great moment, as
the team "needed to slow down the pace of the
game and play our game instead of adjusting to
UCLA's.
"[Dunning] just told us to focus on moving on
and preparing for the next play," Klineman added.
Even so, UCLA went on to win the first set 25-
20, and opened the second set early, forcing Stan
ford to battle back from a deficit. The Card proved
more than up to the challenge and settled into a
rhythm after taking its first lead of the match at 10-
9. With contributions from Lichtman and a service
ace by redshirt freshman Jessica Walker, Stanford
went on to win the set 25-20.
The third set began with Klineman recording six
kills en route to an 8-8 tie, but a quick run by the
Bruins pulled UCLA ahead, 15-9. The Cardinal
bounced back and went on to take 11 of the next 13
points, giving Stanford a 20-17 advantage. The Card
had five blocks in the third set, and went on to win it
25-21.
With a chance to close out the match in the
fourth set, the Card came out strongly, taking a 10-7
lead early on a spike by senior Janet Okogbaa.
UCLA made a short run to pull within three at 17-
14, but the Card proved too much, as another spike
by Okogbaa cut off the run. Stanford went on to win
the set 25-20, leading to a solid four-set victory for
the Cardinal.
"The win over UCLA was huge for us," Kline
man said. "UCLA is a good team that we knew was
going to challenge us, and our team stepped up big
time and showed how resilient we can be,"
Stanford earned another W the following night
at No. 13 USC, sweeping the Trojans 25-23,35-33,
25-18.
Lichtman recorded her fourth triple-double of
the year with 12 kills, 13 assists and 14 digs. Junior
libero Gabi Ailes had a season-high 30 digs, and

Klineman had a season-high 24 kills. Overall, the
Card hit .265 to the Trojans' .192.
Once again, Stanford started down, with the
score at 6-3 in favor of the Trojans. But the Cardinal
soon found its stride and tied the match at 15. Kills
by Janet Okogbaa and Klineman helped the Card
jump out to a 21-18 lead, and USC took a timeout
to try to change the game's momentum. Stanford,
however, still pulled out a close win in the first set,
25-23.
In the second set, the Trojans jumped out to a
lead again, but the Card caught up quickly, tying the
set at 10. The set went back and forth until Stanford
pulled ahead 19-17 on a clutch play by freshman set
ter Karissa Cook. USC, though, came back to tie the
set at 22, and only after four kills by Lichtman and
two by Okogbaa did Stanford take the second set,
35-33.
After gaining momentum from the hard-fought
second set win, Stanford opened the third set 10-4.
USC rallied back, but Okogbaa had another clutch
kill to preserve the Stanford lead at 17-15.The Card
went on to take the set 25-18, finishing off the sweep
of the Trojans in dominant fashion.
"We know that we've made great strides over
the past couple weeks," Klineman said, "but we
needed some wins to back it up."
Lichtman agreed, but noted that Stanford
would need stronger opening periods to keep win
ning in the future. "We need to start faster in
games," she said. "In quite a few of the games we
played this weekend, we let the other team get
ahead early on, forcing ourselves to come back."
The Card got those wins this weekend and now
looks forward to hosting Washington State and No.
3 Washington next weekend at Maples Pavilion.
"This weekend, we showed ourselves that we
can really compete and fight when the game is on
the line," Lichtman said. "We're going to need to do
that on every point against Washington because
they are a great team."

for us," she said. "To get two wins on the road against
teams with such strong traditions as USC and
UCLA gives us a lot more confidence as we contin
ue in the Pac-10."
The Cardinal trailed early in the UCLA match,
with UCLA opening to a quick 6-1 lead in the first
set. However, after a timeout by Stanford Coach
John Dunning, the Card earned three quick points,
two off of service errors by the Bruins.
Junior Alix Klineman, who led the Card with 23
kills, said the timeout came at a great moment, as
the team "needed to slow down the pace of the
game and play our game instead of adjusting to
UCLA's.
"[Dunning] just told us to focus on moving on
and preparing for the next play," Klineman added.
Even so, UCLA went on to win the first set 25-
20, and opened the second set early, forcing Stan
ford to battle back from a deficit. The Card proved
more than up to the challenge and settled into a
rhythm after taking its first lead of the match at 10-
9. With contributions from Lichtman and a service
ace by redshirt freshman Jessica Walker, Stanford
went on to win the set 25-20.
The third set began with Klineman recording six
kills en route to an 8-8 tie, but a quick run by the
Bruins pulled UCLA ahead, 15-9. The Cardinal
bounced back and went on to take 11 of the next 13
points, giving Stanford a 20-17 advantage. The Card
had five blocks in the third set, and went on to win it
25-21.
With a chance to close out the match in the
fourth set, the Card came out strongly, taking a 10-7
lead early on a spike by senior Janet Okogbaa.
UCLA made a short run to pull within three at 17-
14, but the Card proved too much, as another spike
by Okogbaa cut off the run. Stanford went on to win
the set 25-20, leading to a solid four-set victory for
the Cardinal.
"The win over UCLA was huge for us," Kline
man said. "UCLA is a good team that we knew was
going to challenge us, and our team stepped up big
time and showed how resilient we can be,"
Stanford earned another W the following night
at No. 13 USC, sweeping the Trojans 25-23,35-33,
25-18.
Lichtman recorded her fourth triple-double of
the year with 12 kills, 13 assists and 14 digs. Junior
libero Gabi Ailes had a season-high 30 digs, and

Klineman had a season-high 24 kills. Overall, the
Card hit .265 to the Trojans' .192.
Once again, Stanford started down, with the
score at 6-3 in favor of the Trojans. But the Cardinal
soon found its stride and tied the match at 15. Kills
by Janet Okogbaa and Klineman helped the Card
jump out to a 21-18 lead, and USC took a timeout
to try to change the game's momentum. Stanford,
however, still pulled out a close win in the first set,
25-23.
In the second set, the Trojans jumped out to a
lead again, but the Card caught up quickly, tying the
set at 10. The set went back and forth until Stanford
pulled ahead 19-17 on a clutch play by freshman set
ter Karissa Cook. USC, though, came back to tie the
set at 22, and only after four kills by Lichtman and
two by Okogbaa did Stanford take the second set,
35-33.
After gaining momentum from the hard-fought
second set win, Stanford opened the third set 10-4.
USC rallied back, but Okogbaa had another clutch
kill to preserve the Stanford lead at 17-15.The Card
went on to take the set 25-18, finishing off the sweep
of the Trojans in dominant fashion.
"We know that we've made great strides over
the past couple weeks," Klineman said, "but we
needed some wins to back it up."
Lichtman agreed, but noted that Stanford
would need stronger opening periods to keep win
ning in the future. "We need to start faster in
games," she said. "In quite a few of the games we
played this weekend, we let the other team get
ahead early on, forcing ourselves to come back."
The Card got those wins this weekend and now
looks forward to hosting Washington State and No.
3 Washington next weekend at Maples Pavilion.
"This weekend, we showed ourselves that we
can really compete and fight when the game is on
the line," Lichtman said. "We're going to need to do
that on every point against Washington because
they are a great team."
