### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRTTER 
No. 1 ranked Stanford men's water polo held
off a late charge from No. 2 UCLA on Saturday
morning in a well-earned 8-6 victory at Avery
Aquatic Center. After being runner-up to un
defeated USC in the national championship
game last year, the Cardinal has catapulted it
self to the No. 1 spot, starting off the season 9-0.
The teams played just two weeks ago in the
NorCal Tournament, and Stanford won the
meeting 6-5 before going on to win the tourna
ment. Stanford's victory again this weekend
meant that it took over the Varsity Top 20 poll
and its first No. 1 ranking since the 2004 season.
Stanford senior Janson Wigo led all scorers
with four goals, while his brother Drac con
tributed two of his own in the Stanford victory.
Sophomore standout Jacob Smith netted the
Cardinal's remaining two, and senior goalkeep
er Jimmie Sandman made a strong defensive
showing with nine saves.
"My personal goal is to win every game to
set us in good position for making and winning
NCAAs," said Drac Wigo.
Drac Wigo started the game's scoring with 1
minute, 2 seconds left in the first quarter when
he took a shot from the left wing that snuck past
UCLA goalie Chay Lapin. Sandman kept the
Bruins scoreless with three saves in the opening
period.
Janson Wigo kept Stanford's offense going
faster in the next period, putting the Card up 2-
0 on a 6-on-5 power play situation in the open
ing minute. But quick responses from UCLA's
Scott Davidson and Emilio Vieira tied the
game by 5:55 to go before the half.
Stanford regained control with Smith's first
goal of the match coming just 28 seconds later.
Die Bruins had the opportunity to tie things
up again with a man advantage, but Janson
Wigo proved himself a key defensive player as
well, stealing a UCLA pass and moving the ball
to Sandman. Sandman then connected with a

charging Drac Wigo down the flank, and Drac
coolly finished the play with his second goal.
With the goal, Stanford secured a 5-2 lead and
tremendous momentum before the halftime
break.
In the third quarter, the teams traded goals
before UCLA's Clinton Jorth found the net
with 59 seconds to go in the period. UCLA
scored again, pulling within one at 6-5, and put
ting pressure on the Card.
However, Stanford began the fourth quarter
with another Smith goal to give the Cardinal a
little more separation with five minutes to play
in the game.
UCLA refused to give up, and found the
back of Stanford's net once more at 3:34. With
two minutes left to play in the game, the Stan
ford team got a crucial breakaway opportunity:
UCLA's goalkeeper made a key save, but was
penalized, and Janson Wigo got a five-meter
penalty shot. Janson Wigo made the margin two
again at 8-6, and pushed the game out of reach
for the Bruins.
The Card ran down the clock, and another
save by Sandman and UCLA allowed Stanford
to claim its ninth victory of the season.
Stanford will now prepare for the UCI Invi
tational next weekend, where they will begin by
playing Princeton 8 a.m. at UCl's Anteater Pool.
