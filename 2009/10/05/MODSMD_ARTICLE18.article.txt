# Yes, there's life beyond football
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
I heard a lot of "I told you so" after
yesterday's Stanford football vic
tory over UCLA, so touche to you
all.
To answer all of your questions at
once: Yes, I do have faith in Stanford
football, but yes, I do still believe it has
a lot to prove before it can be anoint
ed Rose Bowl-bound.
Now that we've gotten that out of
the way, let's get to what I know you all
have been waiting for: part two of
Stanford Sports 101.
When I said two weeks ago that
you shouldn't take Stanford football's
current successes for granted, I meant
it. I know because of my own experi
ence with the men's basketball pro
gram.
For the better part of a decade,
Stanford was a powerhouse in men's
basketball, not football. There was no
greater place on campus than in the
Sixth Man Club during a big basket
ball game.
The memories are vivid both from
before I arrived at Stanford the end
of the Stanford-Arizona game in 2004,
known simply as "The Shot"
(You Tube it) and since I've been
here with an epic comeback to upset
second-ranked UCLA my freshman
year.
Unfortunately, after a Sweet 16 ap
pearance two years ago, Stanford Bas
ketball has taken a bit of a tumble.
Last season, the Cardinal finished
ninth in the Pacific-10 Conference,
and with three starters gone from the
team, this could be a very long season
for Johnny Dawkins and company.
The Lopez twins the eccentric
shot-blocking duo who led the Cardi
nal for two seasons are now after
thoughts gone to the NBA. And
Dawkins, in his transition from an as
sistant at Duke to Stanford head
coach, has struggled to bring in
enough talent to compete.
Now, about that whole new coach
thing. Trent Johnson, Stanford's for
mer head coach who now holds the
same position at Louisiana State Uni
versity, may have rubbed some the
wrong way, but nonetheless was not
treated particularly amicably by the
Athletic Department after steadily
improving the team prior to his sur
prising departure.
What exactly happened in negotia
tions between Johnson and the Ath
letic Department may never be fully
known, but what is true is that Johnson
was a loss. That isn't to say Johnny
Dawkins won't be a great coach; I
think he has a ton of potential. But
coaches don't normally bolt 2,500
miles across the country after going to
the Sweet 16 unless there is some kind
of disagreement.
What I'm NOT trying to say with
all of this is that you shouldn't go to the
basketball games. You should. They
are really fun. Plus, I could be wrong
it's been known to happen on occa
sion. Maybe Landry Fields will turn
into a star. Or maybe it will be Josh
Owens only time will tell.
My second lesson today is about
the appreciation for women's sports at
Stanford. For one reason or another
whether it is general lack of inter
est, prior time commitments or pure
sexism Stanford's women sports do
not get the fan support or attention
they often deserve.
Stanford has won 15 consecutive
Director's Cups (given annually to the
top overall athletic program in the na
tion), and they weren't won on the
sails of the biggest fan-draw sports of
football and men's basketball. Nope,
they were won because of women's
sports.
Some of you will say, "Great, I'd
trade all 15 Director's Cups for one
Rose Bowl appearance." Which is fine,
but it still doesn't mean that the
women shouldn't get the credit they
deserve.
Year in and year out, almost a
dozen women's teams are ranked in
their respective top fives. Sports rang
ing from basketball and volleyball to
rowing and water polo are always
among the best in the nation and
almost no one is there to see them,
which is a shame.
With that, I conclude my lessons,
and henceforth my columns will re
turn to their normal insight, opinion
and occasional anger.

Daniel Bohm has ended his reign as the
village wise man. Thank him for his wis
dom at bohmd@stanford.edu.
