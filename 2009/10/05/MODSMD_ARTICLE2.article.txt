## Prof. Chomsky speaks at rally Speakers demand U.S. officials be held accountable for 'war mines' 
### KAMIL DADA ALEX YU 
About 200 students and Bay Area activists
gathered in White Plaza Sunday evening to lis
ten to renowned intellectual Noam Chomsky
speak about war crimes. The rally focused on
holding U.S. officials â€”in particular, Hoover
Fellow and political science Prof. Condoleezza
Rice accountable for their actions during the
years of the Bush administration.
But Chomsky, professor emeritus of linguis
tics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, did not specifically single out Rice
and instead urged students to think about two
issues: government accountability and universi
ty policy.

In terms of accountability, Chomsky said
there was no debate. "The U.N. charter [states
that] any threat of force, such as the current
threat against Iran, is a criminal offense and a
violation of the fundamental international stan
dards," he said. "The Nuremberg tribunal
defined aggression and aggressive war as the
supreme international crime."
As a result, he argued, those responsible for
aggression against another state have commit
ted the "ultimate crime" and should be held
accountable for all the crimes that followed as a
result of war.


ALEX YU/The Stanford Daily
Speaking to a gathering of 200 students in White
Plaza, Noam Chomsky labeled former Bush
administration officials as guilty of what he called
the "supreme international crime": aggressive war.
Chomsky also defended the
notion that a university should not
consider the extracurricular activi
ties of its faculty in determining
their qualifications to teach, but
instead should ask if they are ful
filling university responsibility.
He drew a comparison to a
hypothetical political economist at
Stanford who decided to "rob
banks and burn them down" before
coming back to Stanford and teach
ing a course on economics.
"At that point, the university
does have a decision to make in
terms of whether that person is ful
filling the university responsibili
ties," Chomsky declared.
Fellow speaker and history Prof.
Joel Beinin said he fully supports
the right of any faculty member to
teach freely and without any inter
ference. Nevertheless, he made
some exceptions to this policy,
questioning whether it is appropri
ate for former government officials
who enacted controversial policies
to teach classes.
"Perhaps, after a record of
major policy failure, one ought not
to be invited to advise the govern
ment and one ought not to be con
sidered an academic superstar," he
suggested. "If that policy failure is
relevant to what we are teaching at
the university, students be aware
you may be receiving damaged
goods."
In an interview with The Daily
on March 3, 2009, Rice said she
aimed to teach classes by winter
quarter of this year, but she is not
listed as teaching any classes this
academic year in the Stanford
Bulletin.
The organizing party, Stanford
Says No to War, initiated a petition
in May 2009, which called for Rice
to be held accountable for any seri
ous violations of the law, including
ratified treaties, statutes or the U.S.
Constitution. As of Sunday, the
petition had garnered 1,245 signa
tures from students, faculty, staff,
alumni and other community mem
bers. After the rally, the organiza
tion led a group of roughly 50
chanting protestors to Hoover
Tower to affix the petition to the
wall of the building.
Sandra Drake, professor emeri

tus of English, also spoke at the
rally and explained why she signed
the petition.
"I signed it because I am
opposed to torture," she said.
"Once I wouldn't have thought it
necessary to explain why I opposed
torture, but our communal and
public discourse has degenerated
to the point where some people
accept it. I'm opposed to torture
because it is based on a perversion
of empathy."
In a somewhat tumultuous yet
expected first six months at
Stanford for the former Secretary
of State, Rice has seen numerous
protests against her return. An
event entitled "Condival" featured
mock waterboarding and students
in orange jumpsuits. Rice also
engaged with the student body on
numerous occasions by visiting stu
dent dorm complexes, but was
occasionally questioned by stu
dents about her role in the alleged
use of torture.

Student organizers of the rally
encouraged continued activism.
Shara Esbenshade 'l2, for one, said
students should not shy away from
voicing concerns against the pres
ence of high government officials
with whom they disagree on impor
tant policies.
"It is our responsibility to speak
up," she said. "Our silence would be
tacit approval."
