## Prof. Chomsky speaks at rally Speakers demand U.S. officials be held accountable for 'war mines' 
### KAMIL DADA ALEX YU 
About 200 students and Bay Area activists
gathered in White Plaza Sunday evening to lis
ten to renowned intellectual Noam Chomsky
speak about war crimes. The rally focused on
holding U.S. officials â€”in particular, Hoover
Fellow and political science Prof. Condoleezza
Rice accountable for their actions during the
years of the Bush administration.
But Chomsky, professor emeritus of linguis
tics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, did not specifically single out Rice
and instead urged students to think about two
issues: government accountability and universi
ty policy.

In terms of accountability, Chomsky said
there was no debate. "The U.N. charter [states
that] any threat of force, such as the current
threat against Iran, is a criminal offense and a
violation of the fundamental international stan
dards," he said. "The Nuremberg tribunal
defined aggression and aggressive war as the
supreme international crime."
As a result, he argued, those responsible for
aggression against another state have commit
ted the "ultimate crime" and should be held
accountable for all the crimes that followed as a
result of war.
