# Despite H1N1 fear, full moon rises
## Unofficial gathering draws small crowd to Main Quad 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
Under a full moon, a small group of stu
dents gathered in the Quad at midnight to sal
vage Stanford's canceled tradition.
Huddling together, freshmen trickled in
from the south and east corners while several
security officers patrolled the outer perime
ters. Approximately 300 people attended the
unofficial Full Moon event, which received
mixed reactions. Only a handful of couples
were brave enough to pursue the kiss, and
others chose just to drop their pants in rebel
lion.
"It's better than I thought it would be,"
said Sean Tannehill 'l2. "I miss the music and
the general chill atmosphere, but it's amazing
that [students] put this together on a last
minute basis. You really can't stop students
from congregating in the Quad."
Another attendee commented that the
underground event occurred because "the
upperclassmen feel like they've had some
thing stolen from them."
But the result was low freshman atten
dance.
Pooja Desai 'l3 was one of the few fresh
men who wandered through the Quad. "It's a
little awkward but getting fun," she said.
"Once you get your first kiss, things get easier.
I'm a little afraid of swine flu, but I think this
is worth it."
After the administration announced last
week that the official Full Moon on the Quad
(FMOTQ) would be canceled due to threat of
the HINI virus, rumors spread about the
potential of alternative University-sponsored

events or even taking the celebration under
ground.
"It only takes a party with everyone kiss
ing each other for the virus to spread like
crazy," said Peer Health Educator (PHE)
Kate Frelinger 'll. "Sure, there have been
other viruses around, but none have been
nearly as highly publicized as HINI.
"Of course, the worry is not about the virus
itself, but the complications that arise from the

virus, particularly in high risk individuals," she
added. "It's not just about protecting yourself,
but protecting the community."
Although initially met with positive reac
tions by upperclassmen and freshmen not yet
exposed to campus-wide kissing, the news of
cancellation increasingly dismayed students
as the moon grew fuller.
Sunday evening, an email sent to several
dorm chat lists detailing an anonymous stu

dent's plans advocating "Full Moon(s) on the
Quad" called for a reinvention of the
University tradition.
"You see, drastic times call for drastic
measures, and though this year we cannot kiss,
Stanford students need to come together
more than ever, in new creative ways, to
ensure that the spirit, charm, magnificence
and love of our University live on," read the
anonymous email. "There are plenty of ways
to keep this year's Full Moon hygienic while
still retaining its spirit."
The email also encouraged students' semi
nudity to show defiance of the cancellation.
"Be present and bare witness for this truly
momentous, modern no-kiss remaking of Full
Moon on the Quad and come ready to bare it
all, or bare some, or at least yell really, really,
really loud," read the email.
But only a few students took the message
to heart.
"This sounds pretty weird," Christie
Brydon 'l3 said of the plan. "It's too big of a
movement with too little organization, and
there's really nothing memorable about it.
Full Moon on the Quad seems like a good
bonding experience whereas streaking across
the Quad doesn't."
Brydon said the unorganized and sponta
neous nature of the event led to her decision
to not attend.
Justin Fleermann 'l2 attended out of
curiosity. "It seems more about respecting the
tradition rather than acting it out," he said.
In the hours leading up to the impromptu
Full Moon event, rumors circulated about


GARNER KROPP/The Stanford Daily
Students congregate in the Main Quad for an impromptu replacement of the annual tradition of Full Moon
on the Quad. The official event, famous for its pairing of male seniors and female freshmen in a midnight
kiss, was called off this year due to concern over the H1N1 virus, or "swine flu."
