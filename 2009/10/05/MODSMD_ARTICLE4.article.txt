# RELIGIOUS LIFE
## Jewish religious structure at Hillel House vandalized 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
Unknown person(s) vandalized a
Jewish religious structure on the Row in
the hours between Friday night and
Saturday morning, in the midst of Sukkot, a
week-long Jewish holiday.
One of three Jewish pilgrimage holi
days, Sukkot in Hebrew translates directly
to "booths." The singular booth, a sukkah,

was set up mid-week on the lawn in front of
the Row's Taube Hillel House for the holi
day, which lasts from last Friday night to
Sunday night.
The vandalism took the form of two
phallic images drawn onto the canvas flaps
of the booth, and the physical attack of a
sign associated with the sukkah.
Jon Canel 'lO, active in Jewish student
life, discovered the images while on a
morning run from his residence in Casa

Italiana. Canel reported the incident to the
police, and the images have since been cov
ered with blankets.
Canel said the crime has a particular
impact, given the religious significance of
the sukkah. "The tent is a sacred space for
the length of this holiday," he said. "It's
akin to going up to a church and spray
painting the walls."
Amy Kroll 'l2, who described using the
tent for studying and sharing dinner with

other Jewish members of the Stanford
community, said the revelation of the van
dalism was unsettling. "I went over and
looked under the blankets and got really
scared," she said. "I don't understand who
would do that."
