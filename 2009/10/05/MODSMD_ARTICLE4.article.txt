## Jewish religious structure at Hillel House vandalized 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
Unknown person(s) vandalized a
Jewish religious structure on the Row in
the hours between Friday night and
Saturday morning, in the midst of Sukkot, a
week-long Jewish holiday.
One of three Jewish pilgrimage holi
days, Sukkot in Hebrew translates directly
to "booths." The singular booth, a sukkah,

was set up mid-week on the lawn in front of
the Row's Taube Hillel House for the holi
day, which lasts from last Friday night to
Sunday night.
The vandalism took the form of two
phallic images drawn onto the canvas flaps
of the booth, and the physical attack of a
sign associated with the sukkah.
Jon Canel 'lO, active in Jewish student
life, discovered the images while on a
morning run from his residence in Casa

Italiana. Canel reported the incident to the
police, and the images have since been cov
ered with blankets.
Canel said the crime has a particular
impact, given the religious significance of
the sukkah. "The tent is a sacred space for
the length of this holiday," he said. "It's
akin to going up to a church and spray
painting the walls."
Amy Kroll 'l2, who described using the
tent for studying and sharing dinner with

other Jewish members of the Stanford
community, said the revelation of the van
dalism was unsettling. "I went over and
looked under the blankets and got really
scared," she said. "I don't understand who
would do that."
Jewish Student Association President
Joe Gettinger 'll found the incident sur-
prising and regretted the probable
loss of the sukkah. "It was a little
unreal," he said. "This sukkah is the
same one we've had out there every
year. This is permanent damage to
something we would have used for
years to come."
Gettinger added that he found
the incident important beyond its
significance to the Jewish communi
ty alone. "The central thing is the
defilement of a sacred thing on cam
pus, which I find shocking," he said.
The motive behind the act of van
dalism is unclear. Police were
unavailable for comment before
press time, though the indication at
the scene was that they were not
treating the incident as a specifically
anti-Semitic act.
While some students suggested
that the carrying of graffiti cans, the
singling out of a religious structure
and the timing of the incident are
evidence of specific targeting, they
and others also pointed to the struc
ture's placement in a high-traffic
part of the Row and the occurrence
of the vandalism after a night of par
tying as potential alternative causes.
All the students interviewed by
The Daily familiar with the incident
expressed uncertainty about its
nature.

"We're going back and forth
between, 'Was this a crime of oppor
tunity or a crime of intent?'"

Gettinger said.
While the possibility of a specific
anti-Semitic intent weighed in their
minds, many emphasized that they
found the incident more likely to
have been a random act than specif
ic targeting.
"It was shocking, but I didn't
really make anything of it other than
it being some drunk vandals," said
Isaac Bleaman 'l2. "Most of the peo
ple I've spoken to think it's unfortu
nate, but we don't think it's anti-
Semitic."
The incident at the sukkah is the
second act of vandalism involving
graffiti to hit the Row in less than a
week. According to Kappa Sigma
President Will Harte 'lO, Kappa
Sigma's kitchen was also vandalized
in the late hours of a party the frater
nity held Saturday, Sept. 26. That inci
dent has also been reported to police.
While students and Stanford's
Jewish community take in the crime,
Gettinger said that programming
and activities associated with the
holiday will continue. He found that
the crime had a particular reso
nance with Sukkot, which has its ori
gins in both the construction of tem
porary dwellings by wandering
Hebrews, described in the Torah,
and the celebration of the end of the
annual harvest.
"There's an interesting tension in
the holiday between permanence
and frailty," Gettinger said. "This
graffiti has sort of emphasized the
frailty part of the holiday."
