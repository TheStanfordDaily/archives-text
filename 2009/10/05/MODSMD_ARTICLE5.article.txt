# CARDINAL 24 BRUINS 16
## BRUINS BROKEN Gerhart, Luck lead Stanford past UCLA 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the second year in a row, the
game between Stanford and UCLA
came down to a single matchup: the
Cardinal defense against Bruin quarter
back Kevin Craft.
The difference this year? Stanford
knew how to finish.
"Last year, we let that one get away,"
senior linebacker Will Powers said of
last year's devastating defeat at the
Rose Bowl. "We wanted to show we
were capable of going out there and fin
ishing games."
It's safe to say that the Cardinal did
just that in a 24-16 victory that was the
team's best all-around showing so far
this season. Stanford achieved nearly
impeccable balance on offense while sti
fling the Bruins most of the day on
defense.

"My head was completely void of any
thought [after we had won the game],"
Powers said. "It was just joy from knowing
we accomplished what we set out to do."

Coach Harbaugh, for one, was
pleased with the strides his defense has
made so far this year. They were in full
display on Saturday.

"They're attacking, they're playing
with confidence, they're focused, they're
loose," Harbaugh said during the post
game conference, his voice hoarse after a
hard-fought game and a raucous locker
room celebration. "I think they're playing
great team defense that's what's excit
ing about it."

GAME NOTES: Stanford currently sits atop the
Pac-10, but has yet to break into the nation's
top-25 rankings. The Beavers are 3-2 and will
look to challenge the Cardinal after securing
their first conference win against Arizona State
on Saturday.

Senior Toby Gerhart scored all three of Stanford's touchdowns in the team's win against the Bruins. But
it was the Card's sound defense that stopped the Bruins from having too much success of their own.

Redshirt freshman quarterback
Andrew Luck, in the words of Coach
Harbaugh, had the best game of his
young career with 198 yards on 14-of
-20 passing and no interceptions. His
primary target for the day was sopho
more Ryan Whalen, who caught six
balls for 118 yards one of them
coming on a 46-yard flea flicker.
"It was his best game so far," Har
baugh said of Luck. "It's one where I
told him, 'You're going to enjoy
watching the film; He was really lo
cating the ball well. There's just not
that many guys that can pinpoint a 50-
yard throw ... that's real arm talent."
Senior tailback Toby Gerhart was
his usual self, despite facing the
toughest defense the Cardinal has
faced up to this point in the season.
The UCLA defensive line looked
like it might have Stanford's run

game snuffed out after the opening
plays, but Gerhart eventually broke
down the Bruins' defense with 134
yards on 29 carries. Not to mention,
he scored all three Stanford touch
downs.

Overall, Harbaugh had nothing
but praise for his players after a win
that puts Stanford in prime position
to qualify for a bowl game in the com
ing weeks.
"They bring a real enthusiasm and
real focus," Harbaugh said of his
team. "It's a relentless play every
time they come out. They love prac
tice. There was just something about
our team today. There was a real look
in the eye."

we're off to a great start," he said.
"Deep down inside, we think we
should be 5-0. We're at the top of the
Pac-10, and the Pac-10 is a good con
ference, so I think we should be
ranked."

While the Bruins had a slight hope
of tying the game at the end, the
meeting really wasn't that close.
UCLA jumped out to a 3-0 lead after
converting a fumble by sophomore
Chris Owusu into a 29-yard field goal
by Kai Forbath, but that was the only
time they led on Saturday. Stanford
came back with 14 unanswered
points, eventually stretching its lead
out to 24-6 with about a minute re
maining in the third quarter. The Bru
ins responded with a field goal and a
touchdown in the fourth quarter, but
the Stanford defense was able to
close the game in the final minutes.

Next week's game at Oregon
State will bring another story with
plenty more implications for the Car
dinal and the rest of its season. But,
for now, all seems to be better than
it's been for a while on the Farm.

The win puts Stanford atop the
Pacific-10 Conference with its record
now standing at 3-0. That said, the
team is still on the brink of the top 25
it will take at least a win at Oregon
State next week for the team to crack
the national rankings for the first
time in years.
Gerhart, for one, thinks the Cardi
nal deserves to be ranked. "I think

Sophomore Ryan Whalen provided an easy target for freshman quarterback Andrew Luck in the Card's strong showing against UCLA. In Luck's 14-of-20 passing, the pair connected six times, and Whalen notched 118 yards on the afternoon.
