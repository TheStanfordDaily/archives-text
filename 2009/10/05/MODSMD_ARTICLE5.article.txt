# CARDINAL 24 BRUINS 16
## BRUINS BROKEN Gerhart, Luck lead Stanford past UCLA 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the second year in a row, the
game between Stanford and UCLA
came down to a single matchup: the
Cardinal defense against Bruin quarter
back Kevin Craft.
The difference this year? Stanford
knew how to finish.
"Last year, we let that one get away,"
senior linebacker Will Powers said of
last year's devastating defeat at the
Rose Bowl. "We wanted to show we
were capable of going out there and fin
ishing games."
It's safe to say that the Cardinal did
just that in a 24-16 victory that was the
team's best all-around showing so far
this season. Stanford achieved nearly
impeccable balance on offense while sti
fling the Bruins most of the day on
defense.

"My head was completely void of any
thought [after we had won the game],"
Powers said. "It was just joy from knowing
we accomplished what we set out to do."

Coach Harbaugh, for one, was
pleased with the strides his defense has
made so far this year. They were in full
display on Saturday.

"They're attacking, they're playing
with confidence, they're focused, they're
loose," Harbaugh said during the post
game conference, his voice hoarse after a
hard-fought game and a raucous locker
room celebration. "I think they're playing
great team defense that's what's excit
ing about it."

GAME NOTES: Stanford currently sits atop the
Pac-10, but has yet to break into the nation's
top-25 rankings. The Beavers are 3-2 and will
look to challenge the Cardinal after securing
their first conference win against Arizona State
on Saturday.

Senior Toby Gerhart scored all three of Stanford's touchdowns in the team's win against the Bruins. But
it was the Card's sound defense that stopped the Bruins from having too much success of their own.
