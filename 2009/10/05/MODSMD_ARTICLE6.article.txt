## Musical classrooms continues 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
According to Associate
University Registrar Sharon Velten,
443 classroom additions and
changes were made in the second
week of classes this year, leaving
some students and faculty stuck in a
game of musical classrooms.
In an email to The Daily, Velten
said that during the first week of the
quarter, the registrar handled 841
course changes, "including requests
for changing classroom assignments,
creation of new courses and creation
of discussion sections."
Comparatively, 763 similar
requests were made the first week of
last autumn quarter.
The 78 more changes in the first
week this year are in part a result of
requests made by University depart
ments for course schedule changes.
According to Velten, however,
"the most frequent change request
ed is because of a change in the esti
mated enrollment for the course" at
the start of the quarter.
Mechanical engineering Prof.
Eric Darve's CME 100 class was
moved at the beginning of the year.

"The first classroom turned out
to be too small," Darve said in an
email to The Daily. "There were
more students than seats. My assis
tant requested a larger room and I
was assigned 200-32, which is very
nice."
Other classes are simply reas
signed for scheduling purposes.
Chemistry Prof. Wray Huestis'
CHEM 35 course was moved for a
day due to outside occupation in the
lecture hall.

"ln class, the professor told us
that lecture was canceled on Friday
morning because someone was
using our usual auditorium," said
CHEM 35 student Julia Chang 'l2.
The class was assigned to a dif

ferent lecture hall, but ended up
being canceled anyway.
"[Huestis] said that we wouldn't
be able to hear her in the lecture
hall that was assigned to us, so it
wouldn't be worthwhile to have lec
ture that day," Chang said.
Despite missing a day of class,
the change didn't drastically affect
Chang.
"It wasn't a hassle," she said.
"But it would have been nice to
have class and cover more materi
al-

While the number of changes is
greater than last year, Velten cites
the new, earlier study list deadline as
lowering the fluctuations in room
assignments.

"We are seeing a positive effect
in that enrollment in classes is set
tling earlier after the start of the
quarter," Velten said. "Generally,
our second week of classes brings a
great number of classroom change
requests."
Although there is no specific
trend in certain courses being
moved more than others, changes in

section assignments are often made
later in the game.
"We have heard from the depart
ments that [section assignments] are
dependent on incoming TA [teach
ing assistant] teaching availability,"
Velten said. "In many cases, this
information is not available until
after the quarter begins. We don't
see this as a trend, but rather an
ongoing issue,"
For example, political science
Prof. Stephen Krasner's
"Introduction to International
Relations" course had to put off its
first week of section meetings in
order to add more sections to com
pensate for a higher number of stu
dents.

"They're just not sure of class
rooms yet, but I'm sure they'll
resolve it," said Ram Sachs 'l2,
whose section was held in a tempo
rary room until rooms were formal
ized. "I have full faith that the regis
trar will resolve that."
