## Musical classrooms continues 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
According to Associate
University Registrar Sharon Velten,
443 classroom additions and
changes were made in the second
week of classes this year, leaving
some students and faculty stuck in a
game of musical classrooms.
In an email to The Daily, Velten
said that during the first week of the
quarter, the registrar handled 841
course changes, "including requests
for changing classroom assignments,
creation of new courses and creation
of discussion sections."
Comparatively, 763 similar
requests were made the first week of
last autumn quarter.
The 78 more changes in the first
week this year are in part a result of
requests made by University depart
ments for course schedule changes.
According to Velten, however,
"the most frequent change request
ed is because of a change in the esti
mated enrollment for the course" at
