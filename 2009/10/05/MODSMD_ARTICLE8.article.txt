## PHASES OF FULL MOON A 						LOOK AT OUR AGE-OLD TRADITION THROUGH THE YEARS 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
Ingrid Bergman said that a kiss is a love
ly trick designed by nature to stop
speech when words become superflu
ous. At Stanford, our renowned kissing
festival of Full Moon on the Quad
(FMOTQ) is a lovely trick designed by sen
iors to welcome freshmen to the Farm. Or, at
least that's how it started out.

According to CosmoGIRL! Magazine,
FMOTQ is now Stanford's "Claim to Fame."
But how did the innocent rite of passage
transform from a sweet initiation of freshmen
to the University-sanctioned free-for-all
make-out extravaganza it has become?

And we'll kiss by the light of the moon
According to legend, it all started in the
late 19th century: In order to become a true
Stanford man or woman, a freshman had to
kiss a senior in the Quad under the light of the
academic year's first full moon. Seniors filed
in one line, freshmen in another, and, as the
tradition goes, the lines would converge at the
stroke of midnight. The seniors would bestow
roses and plant kisses on the lips of the fresh
men, and with that, the freshmen were truly
initiated to the Farm.

"To me, it was sort of in the pantheon of
these somewhat quaint Stanford traditions
that everyone knew happened," said Mathew
Nosanchuk ('B7). "It seems like the mores
have evolved. Now I've heard it's a make-out
session."

A kiss to build a dream on
FMOTQ always had a place in Stanford
history, but its formality waxed and waned
over the years. It began as one of Stanford's
many unofficial rituals like Primal Scream
and fountain hopping, but was nowhere close
to the headline-grabbing October kissing fest
it has become.
In 1980, there was FMOTQ on a balmy
night in spring quarter.
"I went to one Full Moon on the Quad
where we held a sit-down dinner in the spring
of my senior year," Angela Howell ('80)
remembered. "At this party, there were many,

many tables in the quad. We danced and
included the full moon ritual kiss. I know it
was fun!"
Throughout the 1980s, propriety and
organization were thrown out the window
and FMOTQ became a sort of fly-by-night
student ritual that existed but wasn't too well
publicized. That is, until students of the Class
of 1989 took matters into their own hands.
In 1988, Julie Lythcott-Haims ('B9) and
Preston Hammer ('B9), then class presidents,
"classed up" FMOTQ.
"Over the years, there was nothing really
organized about it," Hammer remembered.
"When I went for the first time, it was a sort of
awkward quagmire of people milling about."
Hammer, an entrepreneurial undergradu
ate who started Sigma Nu's Stanford chapter,
decided to shoot for the moon and make

FMOTQ swanky. Jay Gatsby would have
been proud. Long linen-topped tables were
placed in front of MemChu, with balloons
hovering at the ends. Champagne flowed
from six champagne fountains as the Stanford
orchestra serenaded the assembled guests.

2003: Kiss of Death for FMOTQ?
But the classy aura of 1989 fell away as
FMOTQ became more raucous and reported
instances of sexual assault and alcohol-related
incidents skyrocketed. It became so raunchy,
in fact, that officials began providing mouth
wash and condoms. But in 2003, the carousing
went too far and the tradition almost col
lapsed forever.
That year, four students were rushed to the
hospital for alcohol-related injuries, one stu
dent was slapped with a DUI, and another got

arrested for public drunkenness after the
annual lip-locking on the Quad. Officials
wanted to shut down the event.
At the time, Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe said she had "serious reserva
tions about this event happening again" and
moved to ax the pucker fest. But University
officials feared that students would moon
shine the event, so to speak, and stage a com
pletely unsanctioned underground Full
Moon, so they allowed the tradition to live on.
The saliva-swapping soiree got more inclu
sive for the kissing-averse in 2005, when Full
Moon featured a large-scale stage meant to
mimic a rock concert aura it was complete
with mounted concert lights and projection
screens showing live performances.
But with the University curtailing some of
the spontaneous practices, FMOTQ lost some

of its luster, said Jeremy Jacobs ('O6). At
Stanford, Jacobs went to FMOTQ all four
years; he stressed that he was more sober than
most, so his memory is accurate.
"Freshman year, there was a lot of making
out and few restrictions, "Jacobs said. "Plenty
of streakers, the Band, etcetera. They cracked
down on it in the next years. Fewer people,
more police. Lots more police."

FMOTQ: Today
Now, Full Moon on the Quad has evolved
â€”or devolved, according to your taste
into the undergrad kissing orgy that is the
paragon of collegiate carousing. On the first
full moon of the quarter, painted nudists
from Columbae sprint around the Quad,
seniors check off freshmen dorms on the
Bingo-boards of residences attached to their
chests, and bright-eyed freshmen play tonsil
hockey with entirely too many complete
strangers. Quantity not quality is the motto,
and at the stroke of midnight, all hell (and
saliva) breaks loose.
"The first time I went, I oogled in shock at
the naked hooligans, the Band, but rushed
home like a good little freshman to finish my
Math 51 p-set," Ada Yee ('08) remembered.
"I don't think there was any entertainment
or free mints my frosh years, but by senior
year, FMOTQ had definitely evolved."
"When I got back here as an admin in
1998 and heard what Full Moon had
become, I sort of had this deer-in-the-head
lights-slash-mortified-slash-odd type of feel
ing," recounted Lythcott-Haims, now dean of
freshmen. "I had no idea that this thing that
we had participated in would have become
what it is."
The FMOTQ of today is certainly not the
quaint tradition it was at its inception, but
even now, Dean Julie thinks the tradition is
indelibly etched into Stanford history.
"In many ways, it feels like the quintessen
tial college tradition because it has all the ele
ments: It takes place in one of our most sacred
spaces, it's at midnight, and it involves identity
exploration, which is the hallmark of the
undergrad experience," she said.

of its luster, said Jeremy Jacobs ('O6). At
Stanford, Jacobs went to FMOTQ all four
years; he stressed that he was more sober than
most, so his memory is accurate.
"Freshman year, there was a lot of making
out and few restrictions, "Jacobs said. "Plenty
of streakers, the Band, etcetera. They cracked
down on it in the next years. Fewer people,
more police. Lots more police."

FMOTQ: Today
Now, Full Moon on the Quad has evolved
â€”or devolved, according to your taste
into the undergrad kissing orgy that is the
paragon of collegiate carousing. On the first
full moon of the quarter, painted nudists
from Columbae sprint around the Quad,
seniors check off freshmen dorms on the
Bingo-boards of residences attached to their
chests, and bright-eyed freshmen play tonsil
hockey with entirely too many complete
strangers. Quantity not quality is the motto,
and at the stroke of midnight, all hell (and
saliva) breaks loose.
"The first time I went, I oogled in shock at
the naked hooligans, the Band, but rushed
home like a good little freshman to finish my
Math 51 p-set," Ada Yee ('08) remembered.
"I don't think there was any entertainment
or free mints my frosh years, but by senior
year, FMOTQ had definitely evolved."
"When I got back here as an admin in
1998 and heard what Full Moon had
become, I sort of had this deer-in-the-head
lights-slash-mortified-slash-odd type of feel
ing," recounted Lythcott-Haims, now dean of
freshmen. "I had no idea that this thing that
we had participated in would have become
what it is."
The FMOTQ of today is certainly not the
quaint tradition it was at its inception, but
even now, Dean Julie thinks the tradition is
indelibly etched into Stanford history.
"In many ways, it feels like the quintessen
tial college tradition because it has all the ele
ments: It takes place in one of our most sacred
spaces, it's at midnight, and it involves identity
exploration, which is the hallmark of the
undergrad experience," she said.

Ingrid Bergman said that a kiss is a love
ly trick designed by nature to stop
speech when words become superflu
ous. At Stanford, our renowned kissing
festival of Full Moon on the Quad
(FMOTQ) is a lovely trick designed by sen
iors to welcome freshmen to the Farm. Or, at
least that's how it started out.

According to CosmoGIRL! Magazine,
FMOTQ is now Stanford's "Claim to Fame."
But how did the innocent rite of passage
transform from a sweet initiation of freshmen
to the University-sanctioned free-for-all
make-out extravaganza it has become?

And we'll kiss by the light of the moon
According to legend, it all started in the
late 19th century: In order to become a true
Stanford man or woman, a freshman had to
kiss a senior in the Quad under the light of the
academic year's first full moon. Seniors filed
in one line, freshmen in another, and, as the
tradition goes, the lines would converge at the
stroke of midnight. The seniors would bestow
roses and plant kisses on the lips of the fresh
men, and with that, the freshmen were truly
initiated to the Farm.

"To me, it was sort of in the pantheon of
these somewhat quaint Stanford traditions
that everyone knew happened," said Mathew
Nosanchuk ('B7). "It seems like the mores
have evolved. Now I've heard it's a make-out
session."

A kiss to build a dream on
FMOTQ always had a place in Stanford
history, but its formality waxed and waned
over the years. It began as one of Stanford's
many unofficial rituals like Primal Scream
and fountain hopping, but was nowhere close
to the headline-grabbing October kissing fest
it has become.
In 1980, there was FMOTQ on a balmy
night in spring quarter.
"I went to one Full Moon on the Quad
where we held a sit-down dinner in the spring
of my senior year," Angela Howell ('80)
remembered. "At this party, there were many,

many tables in the quad. We danced and
included the full moon ritual kiss. I know it
was fun!"
Throughout the 1980s, propriety and
organization were thrown out the window
and FMOTQ became a sort of fly-by-night
student ritual that existed but wasn't too well
publicized. That is, until students of the Class
of 1989 took matters into their own hands.
In 1988, Julie Lythcott-Haims ('B9) and
Preston Hammer ('B9), then class presidents,
"classed up" FMOTQ.
"Over the years, there was nothing really
organized about it," Hammer remembered.
"When I went for the first time, it was a sort of
awkward quagmire of people milling about."
Hammer, an entrepreneurial undergradu
ate who started Sigma Nu's Stanford chapter,
decided to shoot for the moon and make

FMOTQ swanky. Jay Gatsby would have
been proud. Long linen-topped tables were
placed in front of MemChu, with balloons
hovering at the ends. Champagne flowed
from six champagne fountains as the Stanford
orchestra serenaded the assembled guests.

2003: Kiss of Death for FMOTQ?
But the classy aura of 1989 fell away as
FMOTQ became more raucous and reported
instances of sexual assault and alcohol-related
incidents skyrocketed. It became so raunchy,
in fact, that officials began providing mouth
wash and condoms. But in 2003, the carousing
went too far and the tradition almost col
lapsed forever.
That year, four students were rushed to the
hospital for alcohol-related injuries, one stu
dent was slapped with a DUI, and another got

arrested for public drunkenness after the
annual lip-locking on the Quad. Officials
wanted to shut down the event.
At the time, Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe said she had "serious reserva
tions about this event happening again" and
moved to ax the pucker fest. But University
officials feared that students would moon
shine the event, so to speak, and stage a com
pletely unsanctioned underground Full
Moon, so they allowed the tradition to live on.
The saliva-swapping soiree got more inclu
sive for the kissing-averse in 2005, when Full
Moon featured a large-scale stage meant to
mimic a rock concert aura it was complete
with mounted concert lights and projection
screens showing live performances.
But with the University curtailing some of
the spontaneous practices, FMOTQ lost some

of its luster, said Jeremy Jacobs ('O6). At
Stanford, Jacobs went to FMOTQ all four
years; he stressed that he was more sober than
most, so his memory is accurate.

out and few restrictions, "Jacobs said. "Plenty
