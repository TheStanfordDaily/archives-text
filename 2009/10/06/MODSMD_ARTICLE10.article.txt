# PALO ALTO
## P.A. gets green recognition 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
The University has had a histo
ry of making its buildings more
"green," and the surrounding com
munity has been taking note. Last
week, Santa Clara County's Green
Business program recognized 24
Palo Alto companies for their
green practices, awarding them
official "green certification."
In order to gain recognition,
the businesses have to fulfill a cer
tain number of waste standards
and energy reductions from a
checklist provided by the county.
This year, the county certified 144
businesses in total.
Zachary DeVine, a spokesper
son for the Integrated Waste
Management Division of Santa
Clara County, said that the num
ber of businesses that qualified for
the Green Business program this
year was impressive.
"It's a very exciting number,"
he said. "All of these businesses
regardless of type have taken
steps to reduce their water and
energy consumption, increase
recycling and decrease waste."
DeVine stated that most busi

nesses made simple, conscious
decisions to improve their energy
and production consumption.
Among the easiest changes that
most businesses made included
the use of recycled paper and
other consumer products, the
implementation of fluorescent
light bulbs and the installation of
low-flow toilets.
For Environmental Health and
Safety Engineer Samantha
Brichacek, an environmental
health and safety engineer for the
Palo Also Research Center
(PARC), one of the 24 distin
guished businesses, the decisions
were simply the right thing to do.
PARC currently has a "Green
Team" made of about 25 volun
teers who dedicate themselves to
decreasing the environmental
impact of the local research firm.
"We're actively pursuing
[becoming green]," she said. "It. .
. makes sense and there is a
strong interest in our culture here
at PARC. It's always a bonus
because it helps the environment,
it reduces carbon footprint, and it
saves money too."
Currently PARC is working to
use completely compostable mate-

rials and recently started installing
automatic light sensors. Other ini
tiatives include subsidizing an
alternate transportation program
in which the company gives small
financial incentives for employees
that take the bus, ride bicycles or
carpool to work.
The Green Business program
was established in 1996 by Santa
Clara County and has since certi
fied over 450 businesses over that
time. Across the Bay Area, over
1,900 businesses have been
approved for the program by their
respective countries.
In addition, DeVine made it
clear that the program was com
pletely voluntary and believed
that more and more businesses
were turning green because of
consumer pressure.
"Customers are becoming more
savvy and they know the issues
with consumption, water con
sumption and energy," he said.
"[There is] intrinsic value in let
ting customers know what [com
panies] can do to lower that
impact."
