## A 						BROAD ABROAD The 						Double-Edged Sword of Student Campaigns 
### Molly Spaeth 
When I was 5,1 wanted to be an astro
naut. Then, I found out you have to
take chemistry first.
Although this campus can be quite daunt
ing at times, I'd be hard-pressed to find a Stan
ford student who hasn't had the dream of ef
fecting change on a national, international or,
in my case, an intergalactic level. Such ambi
tion is admirable and the competition is fierce,
but despite all this, the majority of the people
here are some of the most phenomenal and
down-to-earth people I will ever have the
pleasure to know.
With that said, I would like to highlight an
anomaly that has somehow arisen in stark
contrast to our beloved campus culture of ex
tremely well-informed and involved individu
als: the unfortunate superficiality of student
government campaigns.
Call me an idealist. Call me a lib-tard (both
my editor and my father use them affection
ately, I like to think, at least once a day). But
for such an incredible school, an unbeatable
research institution and a nickname of "Ivy
League of the West," did we really allow the
candidate whose posters featured a stuffed
cow and little else to garner the top spot in the
2008 ASSU Senate elections?
Now, let me say first that this is in no way
meant to be a critique of Shelley Gao or of any
other candidate who has run for or won an
election in recent ASSU history. In fact, in
many ways these politicos have seen the sys
tem of student government here at Stanford
for what it is and have learned to acquiesce to
what is: unfortunately, the status quo.
We've all seen it. Bennett Hauser and Matt
Sprague's Exec campaign bid this past year
featured their platform in a remix of "Pirates
of the Caribbean." "The Soph Touch" took
home the sophomore class presidency in 2008
and Zack Warma's "Keeping You Warma All
Night Long" poster helped him secure a seat
in the ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
Oh, they're clever, fun to look at, and we all
know I love a good Pirates of the Caribbean
remix just as much as the next 14-year-old
Johnny Depp fan. But the inherent superfi
ciality of the campaigns at Stanford has
reached such a point that the average student
now questions the very purpose of student
government itself. And as a result, if the stu
dent doesn't believe decisions made in stu
dent government will affect them, they may
also believe their time will be better spent
catching up on IHUM rather than reading
through candidate platforms.
It's a malicious cycle.

The part that kills me the most is that I have
seen some candidates whom I have honestly
believed may be the best people for the job, a
thousand times over, lose election after elec
tion after refusing to buy into this entrenched
system of campaign frivolity.
But this belief raises yet another important
question: Is it more effective to stay true to
your integrity but not yield any elected power,
or in this status-quo system of cyclical superfi
ciality do the most successful politicos just bite
the bullet and conform in order to win an elec
tion?
Perhaps the root of the problem is inherent
voter apathy in student government. Because
student government is less glamorous than
Michelle Obama (and when I say less glam
orous, I REALLY mean less glamorous. Pic
ture Zack Warma) and doesn't produce the
same visceral results as TARP money (I see
you orange cones!), it is harder to care as
much about something that you don't truly
believe affects you.
The honest truth is that it does affect all of
us. Although you may think that however
much money the LGBT or the Women's Cen
ter receives each year doesn't matter to you as
a straight male, members of the LGBT com
munity and the female half of our campus are
going to be voting at some point down the line
whether or not you will have enough money to
throw Dis-Orientation this year. But if that
isn't enough to keep in mind, one of the most
vital functions of student government is facili
tating awareness of how decisions YOU make
will influence the interests and communities
of those around you. And that's a pretty cool
thought.
I love you, Stanford, for always thinking of
the bigger picture. But Rome wasn't built in a
day I was just there, I know and you're
going to be involved in smaller communities
for the rest of your life. When school board
meetings affect your children and local town
hall meetings decide the sales tax, it just might
be useful to get involved and understand your
community.
And just like Rome, we cannot change the
structure of the ASSU campaign process in
one day. But the next time you see a political
poster, take a look at a couple platform points,
and should you see some that you agree with,
remember those instead of a stuffed cow.
