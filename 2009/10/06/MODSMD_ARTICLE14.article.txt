# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Liberal Pessimism in Record Time 
### Danny Crichton 
Last week's announcement that Chicago
had failed in its bid for the 2016
Olympics was the latest in a series of
missteps by the new Obama administration.
As pessimism sinks in and unemployment
inches upward, what was the exuberant can
didate of 2008 has now turned into the
lugubrious president of 2009. Obama has
met the reality of the modern political
world. How to proceed from here is his
choice.
Flashback to last year. For those on cam
pus, there was an electricity pervading the
entire campus that is only seen after beating
a hated rival in football. Students, even those
who rarely follow politics, were conversing
on the issues of the day and schlepping all
the way to Nevada and Florida to make their
voices heard.
Although there was hollowness on Elec
tion Day in the face of Prop. B's success, a
packed election party at the CoHo capped
an exciting campaign. That energy remained
palpable in January when Obama was inau
gurated. Even the forgettable, early-morn
ing speech could not deter those watching
or those who secured a ticket to the event
from celebrating a momentous day in Amer
ican political history.
Seven months later, the energy and pas
sion on display during the campaign has
seemed to peter out. Left-wing Democrats
complain (almost bitterly) over forgotten
promises and disappointing decisions while
the center-left anxiously looks ahead to an
increasingly gloomy 2010 campaign. Right
now, Obama has a critical choice before him:
Will he be the candidate of his campaign, or
the president of the last seven months?
If he chooses the former, then he has
much work to do. The first issue will invari
ably be health care. Winning against empow
ered Republican congressmen, skeptical
Blue Dog Democrats and angry town hall
participants will require a more populist
Obama. The important goal would be to
frame the issue away from cost and onto pa
tient health. A full-time campaign schedule
throughout the country could draw the spot
light back to him as well.
Following through with his campaign

promises, Obama would need to refocus his
efforts to close Guantanamo Bay. The
process has been too slow and neglected. A
high-level push from the chief executive may
persuade skeptical nations to take a few in
mates and would shore up his support
among the anti-war left without angering the
political center. These two actions would
bring back some of the energy of the cam
paign and reset the current situation.
However, this plan is not the right course
for the Obama administration. Instead of

pandering to the left, a strategy that brought
him to this untenable position in the first
place, he should remain focused on the bi
partisanship he wants to represent.
Health care is the issue of the day, and it is
time to get the best deal possible and move
on. Health care is a truly messy policy issue,
with inordinate complexity filled with pit
falls. Bring down the costs of insurance
through better regulation and enforcement
of antitrust laws and come back to the issue
of universal health coverage when the econ
omy is stronger and premiums are lower.
Obama then needs a series of strong vic
tories to bring the Zeitgeist of his campaign
back. Focus on school-choice and education
al accountability. Push hard for better parity
between charter and public schools, as Stan
ford's own professor, Caroline Hoxby, has
recently shown to be quite beneficial in re
cent research. Attacking one of his major
campaign contributors is a gambit, but one
with strong dividends as he moves himself to
the political center in the mind of voters.
Next, bring back the discipline of the cam
paign. When the chief executive has to sit
down for a beer summit on the White House
front lawn, something is very wrong. When
the president goes to lobby an organization,
make sure he is not about to be humiliated
when his home city is flatly rejected.
Finally, and most importantly, bring back
some semblance of focus. The number of is
sues that demand immediate action is high,
but winning every battle, every time is hard
when the troops are scattered. The band
width of Washington, D.C. is incredibly small
better to do one thing well than to do
many and see none of them succeed.
The pessimism of my more liberal friends
will not continue forever. A stronger admin
istration with a couple of victories under its
belt will surely be more successful in the
coming years than one that seems to con
stantly reach a draw on every issue. Politics is
a marathon of tremendous length, and
Obama must be the torchbearer. Unfortu
nately, he will not hold the real one in 2016.
