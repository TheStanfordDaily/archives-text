## RETURN TO FORM OUT EAST Stanford takes two of three on Pennsylvania road trip 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last week's loss to California did not put a
damper on the Stanford women's field hockey
team, as it traveled to Pennsylvania with a re
newed vigor and convincingly bested Temple
and La Salle before dropping a hard-fought
game to Penn State.
"This upcoming week is about refocusing
and reestablishing our identity as a powerful
and dynamic team," said senior Nora Soza, as
her team prepared to head east. The rejuvena
tion certainly helped, as the women won two of
the three games on their East Coast tour.
"We're enjoying our success on road trips,"
said coach Lesley Irvine. "To come to Pennsyl
vania and beat teams is exciting."
No. 14 Stanford (10-2,2-1 NorPac) came to
Pennsylvania ready to win, and as the women
played Temple in the first match, they provided
one of the most intense offensive attacks of the
year. After a season-high 27 shot attempts, the
Cardinal won the game, 7-2.
Senior Midori Uehara had an incredible
game, leading both teams in scoring en route to
a hat trick. Uehara was the leading scorer from
last year, but had yet to hit her stride this sea
son. Having scored two goals and attempted 11
shots before Friday, Uehara's hat trick once
again established her as one of the top offensive
players on the team.
"It's been great so far, and we have gotten
better in each of the games we've played," Ue
hara said. "It's been refreshing to get on the
road and have a change of scenery, and it has
helped us to refocus."
Other scorers for the Cardinal were fresh
man Becky Dru, sophomore Stephanie Byrne,
junior Heather Alcorn and senior Mariana
Shile. This was Dru's fourth goal of the season
and Byrne's third. Stanford goalkeeper
Alessandra Moss had five saves and also
blocked a penalty shot.
"The season inevitably has ups and downs,"
Uehara said. "But the key to winning is to take

everything in stride and get better every day."
The Stanford women were able to do that at
Temple, and again the next day against La Salle.
In the match against La Salle, Uehara and
Dru once again proved themselves a threaten

ing force on the offense. Both scored two goals
apiece to win the game with a score of 4-0, with
senior Nora Soza assisting Dru on her second
goal. The defense also stepped up to not allow a
single shot attempt after halftime.
"It has been a great road trip for our team,"
Soza said. "Our focus on improving our own
style of play will benefit us in the rest of the sea
son, and it has been a great opportunity to think
only about hockey."
On Monday, unfortunately, Stanford lost a
tough battle against Penn State, ending its win
ning streak once more. It was only the second
loss of the season, but the 3-1 final score was
dismal for the Cardinal.
Stanford outshot Penn State 14-13, but was
unable to find the goal as readily as its oppo
nents. Additionally, Penn State had the upper

hand in penalty corners, outshooting the Cardi
nal 7-6.This was the second upset Penn State has
pulled this year, having defeated No. 18 Ohio
State, 2-1, three days ago. As the defending Big
Ten regular season champion and consistent
NCAA tournament participant, Penn State had
the skill and dexterity to beat Stanford.
Junior Camille Gandhi scored the only goal
for the Cardinal in the 32nd minute off a penal
ty corner attempt by junior Jaimee Erickson.
Unfortunately, it was not enough to win the
final game of the Cardinal's East Coast trip.
Stanford will be back in action Sunday, Oct.
11 as it plays Pacific for the second time this sea
son, having defeated them 5-1 earlier this year.

After suffering its first loss of 2009 to Cal, the Cardinal was looking to hit its stride again during last weekend's road trip to Pennsylvania. They managed to take two games from Temple and La Salle before falling to Penn State, improving to 2-2 on the five-game road trip, their seaon's longest.
