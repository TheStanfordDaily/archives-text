## Card falls in Berkeley 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
A week after finally cracking the top 25, the Stan
ford men's soccer team was reminded that they still
have a long way to go.
The No. 20 Cardinal (6-2-0,0-1-0 Pac-10) fell 1-0 to
No. 7 Cal Friday afternoon in Berkeley. The disap
pointing loss to its rival in the conference opener
snapped a six-game winning streak for Stanford.
As usual, Stanford's defense was solid, but the of
fense couldn't find away to covert, despite a multi
tude of chances. Stanford outshot Cal (7-2-0,1-0-0
Pac-10) 12-7, including 8-6 during a first-half rife with
scoring chances on both ends. Stanford's best oppor
tunity came in the 32nd minute when junior forward
Daniel Leon hit the crossbar.
Cal's game-winner came just three minutes and 50
seconds into the second half when Andrew Wiede
man beat Stanford keeper John Moore for his team
and Pac-10-leading ninth goal of the season. Wiede
man, the reigning Pac-10 goal leader, is well on his way
to besting his total of 12 from last year.
Faced with an early deficit in the second, the Car
dinal responded with a dominant effort that fell just
short. Stanford tallied four shots in the second half
without giving up a single shot following the Wiede
man score. But Cal keeper David Bingham stood
strong in goal, recording his third shutout of the sea
son on the strength of a five-save performance. Bing
ham was tested until the very end, when he was forced
to make a diving save on Cameron Lamming's shot a
mere 40 seconds before time expired.
The 1-0 loss to a second-half goal disturbingly
echoes the Cardinal's woes last season, when a chron
ic lack of scoring doomed a solid Stanford squad to a
subpar 4-11-3 record. However, the offense already
has appeared to remedy most of the issues that
plagued them a year ago. Stanford notched a total of
14 goals in 18 games last season, a mark it reached in
just its seventh game this year. The loss to Cal was the
first time the team has been shutout all season, a
markedly different pace than the nine times it hap-

pened last year.
On the other side of the ball, Stanford continues to
play with resolve and poise. Moore needed to make
only two saves in the game, and once Cal scored, the
Cardinal defense was in fine lockdown form. By lim
iting the Golden Bears to a single goal, Stanford
stretched its streak of limiting its opponents to two
goals or less to an astounding 26 consecutive games.
Besides being a solid duel between two rivals, the
game was extremely well attended. Some 1,320 fans
came out to watch the two teams Cal's highest
draw for a regular season game since 2000.
Going forward, Stanford hopes to retain its rank
ing as it moves further into conference play. With its
win over the Cardinal, Cal stands along UCLA as the
teams to beat in the Pac-10. Stanford will need a pair
of strong performances this weekend if it wants to re
main in the hunt. The Card play UCLA a week apart
in a home-and-home series on Oct. 18 and Oct. 25, b
efore getting another crack at Cal in its final game at
home on the Nov. 1.
This weekend, Stanford plays host to Oregon
State on Friday at 7 p.m. and Washington on Sunday
at Ip.m.
