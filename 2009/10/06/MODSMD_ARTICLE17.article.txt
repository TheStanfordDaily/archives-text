# Defense answers Harbaugh's call
## Card hanging tough against Pac-10 offenses 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the wake of Stanford's second-half
letdown against Wake Forest, coach Jim
Harbaugh issued a vague, if not unsubtle,
ultimatum to his defense.
"I told the guys: we are looking for foot
ball players," he said at the time. "A football
player is a guy that makes plays, technical
ly and fundamentally sound, knowing what
they are doing. We are looking for guys to
show that this week. There is definitely op
portunity for guys to get on the field."
Given the Demon Deacons' 251 yards
on the ground and the porous holes at the
second level in run defense, many pre
sumed that Harbaugh was talking about
his starting linebackers and particularly
because the backups included athletes like
highly-touted freshman Shayne Skov,
Stanford's top recruit this year.
How did the starters respond? By be
coming the "football players" Harbaugh
sought. The loss in Winston-Salem may
have served as a wake-up call for the Car
dinal as a whole certainly, in 12 quarters
since then, it has yet to seriously falter
but there has been no unit whose perform
ance has changed as much as the lineback
ers' has.
Take redshirt senior Will Powers, the
starter on the strong side. Against San Jose
State, the first opponent after Wake Forest,
Powers recorded two sacks in his entire
career to that point, he only had one and
that came in his freshman year. Both came
on third down, one of which while the
Spartans were threatening to enter Stan
ford territory.
It was his finest game of the season to
that point and since then, Powers has
found a niche as a blitzer from the outside.
He recovered a fumble in the midst of a
Washington drive when the Huskies visit
ed the Farm on the following weekend, but
Powers eclipsed both of his previous two
performances during the Cardinal's fight
with UCLA on Saturday.
Powers recorded four tackles, but his
impact was felt via his two pass breakups.
Both came late and at critical moments.
The first was on third down deep in Stan
ford territory with the Cardinal up 24-13.
A touchdown would give the Bruins a
chance to convert a two-point conversion
and close the deficit to just a field goal; a
stop would mean that the deficit would re
main at eight. On the play, Powers batted
down a Kevin Craft attempt, and thus
forced kicker Kai Forbath onto the field.
Later, on 4th and 10 on UCLA's last

drive with just over a minute left. Powers
came flying off the edge to knock down an
other pass and end the game,
"I was just working a pass rush move on
the left side, on the left end," he said. "Our
coverage held long enough to be able to let
me get a hand on the QB and deflect his
throw a little bit."
Powers, though, is hardly a one-man
unit.
His counterpart on the weak side, jun
ior Chike Amajoyi, has also made strides,
particularly in coverage. A former running
back that has started at linebacker for
much of his career, Amajoyi's speed has al
lowed him to stick with receivers and ei
ther force incompletions or allow him to
make an immediate tackle. Along with
junior cornerback Corey Gatewood, who
is frequently lined up on the same side,
Amajoyi has become deft at snuffing out
screen passes, the very type of play that
Wake Forest used to such effectiveness last
month.
While Power and Amajoyi hold down
the outside, redshirt senior Clinton Snyder
has been Stanford's top defender this year
as a middle linebacker. Amajoyi held down
the position last year, but after taking over
in 2009, Snyder has become the Cardinal's
leading tackier and, even when he's not in
on a stop, he's in the area his ability to
range around the field has made him par
ticularly dangerous. He led Stanford with
nine tackles against Washington, but even
that total was deceiving Snyder was a
constant part of the pile, it seemed, on near
ly every defensive play.
"That's a great position for him. He cov
ers up for a lot of things, guys get blocked
and he's covering a lot of ground between
the tackles. But he's covering ground from
sideline to sideline as well," said Harbaugh.
"He's got those strong hands and he gets
those hands on people. It doesn't take him
five yards to drag them down."
The sum total of Powers, Amajoyi and
Snyder's recent performances is a line
backing corps that has become the strength
of the defense. The Wake Forest game
seems far in the past, and yet Harbaugh's
rhetoric is reminiscent of his past declara
tion on "football players."
Only this time, he's beaming.
"It was a great effort, fanatical effort,"
he said of the Cardinal's defensive per
formance against UCLA, particularly late
in the game. "I'm really proud of them. It
was a relentless type of play."
