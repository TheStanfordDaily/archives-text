# Picking October's Winners
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
What a wonderful time of
the year for sports. Stan
ford is leading the Pac
-10 and Toby Gerhart is
steamrolling opposing defenses. The
NFL season is in full swing, and there's
already been plenty of drama, as well
as some surprises the Titans and
Broncos, just to name a few. The NHL
has started and will soon be followed
by the NBA, which has already begun
preseason.
And, on top of all that, it's playoff
time. No, not what you're probably
thinking, not the WNBA Finals. The
Major League Baseball playoffs begin
tomorrow. So for the large number of
you who convince everyone that you
don't care about baseball at all (be
cause that seems to be the cool thing
to do these days), but are still curious
about the playoffs, here is my 100 per
cent biased view of the 2009 playoffs,
complete with horrible predictions
that will not come true. (Warning, if
you are a fan of any teams I pick to do
well, I am sorry in advance for remov
ing any chance of their success.)
Let's start in the American League,
because it has been the dominant
league for years (see: 12-0-1 in the last
13 All-Star Games) and has the three
best teams in baseball again this year.
The first matchup is actually still
undetermined, thanks to the pesky
Minnesota Twins, who decided once
again to crash the party and come
back from a huge deficit they were
seven games back a month ago to
tie the Detroit Tigers for the AL Cen
tral crown and force a one-game
playoff for the second consecutive
season. These are the same Twins
who have a payroll of over $5O mil
lion less than the Tigers and who lost
2006 AL MVP Justin Morneau to in
jury for the rest of the season. It's an
amazing accomplishment that they
are still in the race and as they have
home field for tonight's one-game
playoff, as well as momentum and a
lack of stupid arrests (see: Miguel
Cabrera's drunk temper tantrum), I
expect them to complete the come
back and advance to the ALDS.
Waiting for the winner of the
Twins-Tigers game, though, are the
juggernaut Yankees, whose starting
infield alone makes over $lO million
more than the entire Twins team. Of
course, this year's Yankees put their
wads of extra cash to better use than
most New York squads of recent
years, bringing in Mark Teixeira, A.J.
Burnett and C.C. Sabathia for only a
touch over $52 million per year. It has
worked well for the Bronx Bombers
so far, as they thrived in their new
launching pad and won an MLB
leading 103 games this season. With
so many superstars, as well as home
field advantage and the luxury of
much-needed rest for their starters
against a worn out Twins or Tigers
team, I expect, as much as I hate to
say it, the Yankees to cruise through
the ALDS. Prediction: Yankees in
three.
The other series in the American
League figures to be much more
tightly contested. For the third
straight season, the Angels and Red
Sox will clash in the first round of the
playoffs. The Red Sox have dominat
ed the Angels in the playoffs, winning
all three series against them this
decade while losing only one game in
the process. Boston is again favored
by odds makers and experts alike,
thanks to some bigger names and the
East Coast media bias, as well as a lit
tle history. However, the Angels have
the better record; they won the sea
son series against the Red Sox, they
have better hitting, coaching, defense
and baserunning than the Sox and
they have home field advantage. And
yes, they are my favorite team and I
would never think about picking
against them. But this is really a dif
ferent Angels team than we've seen
in years past, and the Red Sox are
shakier this year than they have been
(see: struggles of Josh Beckett, no
backup shortstop, injuries to many
starters and no aura around David
Ortiz). And I'm a proud homer (if
you don't know what a homer is, just
Google "Bill Simmons"). Prediction:
Angels in four.
On the other side of the Designat
ed Hitter Divide, there are two more
tough matchups, as the four playoff
teams are separated by only four wins

after a 162-game season, and the best
of the bunch might have the worst
record.

To start off, the defending World
Series champion Phillies take on the
comeback story of the National
League: the Colorado Rockies. The
Rockies were again left for dead after
a dreadful start. In May, Colorado had
baseball's second-worst record (be
hind only the historically bad Nation
als) and fired its coach, Clint Hurdle,
replacing him with the previously
mediocre Jim Tracy. Tracy and the
Rockies then exploded back into the
race, going 74-42 the rest of the way
and nearly overtaking the Dodgers
before finally settling for the Wild
Card. The Phillies have looked domi
nant at times, especially after adding
last year's Cy Young winner, Cliff Lee,
as well as former ace Pedro Martinez.
Despite bullpen issues and a resilient
opponent, the experience and depth
of the Phillies should carry them to the
NLCS. Prediction: Phillies in four.

The final Division Series matchup
pits the NL West champion Los Ange
les Dodgers against the NL Central
champion St. Louis Cardinals. The
Dodgers jumped out to an enormous
divisional lead and had to fend off late
charges by the Rockies and Giants to
maintain their lead. The Dodgers suc
cess is due in large part to a surprising
ly good pitching staff, which has the
best ERA in the majors this season.
And while that ERA is helped by
playing the Padres and Diamond
backs a combined 36 times, the pitch
ing staff has certainly been impressive.
However, a playoff rotation head
lined by Randy Wolf, Clayton Ker
shaw and Chad Billingsley doesn't ex
actly make opposing teams tremble
with fear. The Dodgers' opponents,

though,can rely on the one-two punch
of Chris Carpenter and Adam Wain
wright to make any team go quietly,
not to mention that the light-hitting
Dodgers are 0-4 against the Cardinals'
two Cy Young candidates this season.

It also helps your pitchers when you
have the best human/machine/freak
of nature alive in Albert Pujols to back

you up, along with midseason acquisi
tion Matt Holliday.The Cardinals just
have too much potential and the
Dodgers have too many question
marks. Prediction: Cardinals in three.

Jacob Jaffe swears that Kendry Morales
should be theAL MVP. Figure out who
the heck that is at jwjajfe@stanford.edu.

baseball's second-worst record (be
hind only the historically bad Nation
als) and fired its coach, Clint Hurdle,
replacing him with the previously
mediocre Jim Tracy. Tracy and the
Rockies then exploded back into the
race, going 74-42 the rest of the way
and nearly overtaking the Dodgers
before finally settling for the Wild
Card. The Phillies have looked domi
nant at times, especially after adding
last year's Cy Young winner, Cliff Lee,
as well as former ace Pedro Martinez.
Despite bullpen issues and a resilient
opponent, the experience and depth
of the Phillies should carry them to the
NLCS. Prediction: Phillies in four.

The final Division Series matchup
pits the NL West champion Los Ange
les Dodgers against the NL Central
champion St. Louis Cardinals. The
Dodgers jumped out to an enormous
divisional lead and had to fend off late
charges by the Rockies and Giants to
maintain their lead. The Dodgers suc
cess is due in large part to a surprising
ly good pitching staff, which has the
best ERA in the majors this season.
And while that ERA is helped by
playing the Padres and Diamond
backs a combined 36 times, the pitch
ing staff has certainly been impressive.
However, a playoff rotation head
lined by Randy Wolf, Clayton Ker
shaw and Chad Billingsley doesn't ex
actly make opposing teams tremble
with fear. The Dodgers' opponents,

though,can rely on the one-two punch
of Chris Carpenter and Adam Wain
wright to make any team go quietly,
not to mention that the light-hitting
Dodgers are 0-4 against the Cardinals'
two Cy Young candidates this season.

It also helps your pitchers when you
have the best human/machine/freak
of nature alive in Albert Pujols to back

you up, along with midseason acquisi
tion Matt Holliday.The Cardinals just
have too much potential and the
Dodgers have too many question
marks. Prediction: Cardinals in three.

should be theAL MVP. Figure out who

What a wonderful time of
the year for sports. Stan
ford is leading the Pac
-10 and Toby Gerhart is
steamrolling opposing defenses. The
NFL season is in full swing, and there's
already been plenty of drama, as well
as some surprises the Titans and
Broncos, just to name a few. The NHL
has started and will soon be followed
by the NBA, which has already begun
preseason.
And, on top of all that, it's playoff
time. No, not what you're probably
thinking, not the WNBA Finals. The
Major League Baseball playoffs begin
tomorrow. So for the large number of
you who convince everyone that you
don't care about baseball at all (be
cause that seems to be the cool thing
to do these days), but are still curious
about the playoffs, here is my 100 per
cent biased view of the 2009 playoffs,
complete with horrible predictions
that will not come true. (Warning, if
you are a fan of any teams I pick to do
well, I am sorry in advance for remov
ing any chance of their success.)
Let's start in the American League,
because it has been the dominant
league for years (see: 12-0-1 in the last
13 All-Star Games) and has the three
best teams in baseball again this year.
The first matchup is actually still
undetermined, thanks to the pesky
Minnesota Twins, who decided once
again to crash the party and come
back from a huge deficit they were
seven games back a month ago to
tie the Detroit Tigers for the AL Cen
tral crown and force a one-game
playoff for the second consecutive
season. These are the same Twins
who have a payroll of over $5O mil
lion less than the Tigers and who lost
2006 AL MVP Justin Morneau to in
jury for the rest of the season. It's an
amazing accomplishment that they
are still in the race and as they have
home field for tonight's one-game
playoff, as well as momentum and a
lack of stupid arrests (see: Miguel
Cabrera's drunk temper tantrum), I
expect them to complete the come
back and advance to the ALDS.
Waiting for the winner of the
Twins-Tigers game, though, are the
juggernaut Yankees, whose starting
infield alone makes over $lO million
more than the entire Twins team. Of
course, this year's Yankees put their
wads of extra cash to better use than
most New York squads of recent
years, bringing in Mark Teixeira, A.J.
Burnett and C.C. Sabathia for only a
touch over $52 million per year. It has
worked well for the Bronx Bombers
so far, as they thrived in their new
launching pad and won an MLB
leading 103 games this season. With
so many superstars, as well as home
field advantage and the luxury of
much-needed rest for their starters
against a worn out Twins or Tigers
team, I expect, as much as I hate to
say it, the Yankees to cruise through
the ALDS. Prediction: Yankees in
three.
The other series in the American
League figures to be much more
tightly contested. For the third
straight season, the Angels and Red
Sox will clash in the first round of the
playoffs. The Red Sox have dominat
ed the Angels in the playoffs, winning
all three series against them this
decade while losing only one game in
the process. Boston is again favored
by odds makers and experts alike,
thanks to some bigger names and the
East Coast media bias, as well as a lit
tle history. However, the Angels have
the better record; they won the sea
son series against the Red Sox, they
have better hitting, coaching, defense
and baserunning than the Sox and
they have home field advantage. And
yes, they are my favorite team and I
would never think about picking
against them. But this is really a dif
ferent Angels team than we've seen
in years past, and the Red Sox are
shakier this year than they have been
(see: struggles of Josh Beckett, no
backup shortstop, injuries to many
starters and no aura around David
Ortiz). And I'm a proud homer (if
you don't know what a homer is, just
Google "Bill Simmons"). Prediction:
Angels in four.
On the other side of the Designat
ed Hitter Divide, there are two more
tough matchups, as the four playoff
teams are separated by only four wins

after a 162-game season, and the best
of the bunch might have the worst
record.

To start off, the defending World
Series champion Phillies take on the
comeback story of the National
League: the Colorado Rockies. The
Rockies were again left for dead after
a dreadful start. In May, Colorado had
baseball's second-worst record (be
hind only the historically bad Nation
als) and fired its coach, Clint Hurdle,
replacing him with the previously
mediocre Jim Tracy. Tracy and the
Rockies then exploded back into the
race, going 74-42 the rest of the way
and nearly overtaking the Dodgers
before finally settling for the Wild
Card. The Phillies have looked domi
nant at times, especially after adding
last year's Cy Young winner, Cliff Lee,
as well as former ace Pedro Martinez.
Despite bullpen issues and a resilient
opponent, the experience and depth
of the Phillies should carry them to the
NLCS. Prediction: Phillies in four.

pits the NL West champion Los Ange
