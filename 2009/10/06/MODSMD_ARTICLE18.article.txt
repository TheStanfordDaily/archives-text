# Picking October's Winners

### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
What a wonderful time of
the year for sports. Stan
ford is leading the Pac
-10 and Toby Gerhart is
steamrolling opposing defenses. The
NFL season is in full swing, and there's
already been plenty of drama, as well
as some surprises the Titans and
Broncos, just to name a few. The NHL
has started and will soon be followed
by the NBA, which has already begun
preseason.
And, on top of all that, it's playoff
time. No, not what you're probably
thinking, not the WNBA Finals. The
Major League Baseball playoffs begin
tomorrow. So for the large number of
you who convince everyone that you
don't care about baseball at all (be
cause that seems to be the cool thing
to do these days), but are still curious
about the playoffs, here is my 100 per
cent biased view of the 2009 playoffs,
complete with horrible predictions
that will not come true. (Warning, if
you are a fan of any teams I pick to do
well, I am sorry in advance for remov
ing any chance of their success.)
Let's start in the American League,
because it has been the dominant
league for years (see: 12-0-1 in the last
13 All-Star Games) and has the three
best teams in baseball again this year.
The first matchup is actually still
undetermined, thanks to the pesky
Minnesota Twins, who decided once
again to crash the party and come
back from a huge deficit they were
seven games back a month ago to
tie the Detroit Tigers for the AL Cen
tral crown and force a one-game
playoff for the second consecutive
season. These are the same Twins
who have a payroll of over $5O mil
lion less than the Tigers and who lost
2006 AL MVP Justin Morneau to in
jury for the rest of the season. It's an
amazing accomplishment that they
are still in the race and as they have
home field for tonight's one-game
playoff, as well as momentum and a
lack of stupid arrests (see: Miguel
Cabrera's drunk temper tantrum), I
expect them to complete the come
back and advance to the ALDS.
Waiting for the winner of the
Twins-Tigers game, though, are the
juggernaut Yankees, whose starting
infield alone makes over $lO million
more than the entire Twins team. Of
course, this year's Yankees put their
wads of extra cash to better use than
most New York squads of recent
years, bringing in Mark Teixeira, A.J.
Burnett and C.C. Sabathia for only a
touch over $52 million per year. It has
worked well for the Bronx Bombers
so far, as they thrived in their new
launching pad and won an MLB
leading 103 games this season. With
so many superstars, as well as home
field advantage and the luxury of
much-needed rest for their starters
against a worn out Twins or Tigers
team, I expect, as much as I hate to
say it, the Yankees to cruise through
the ALDS. Prediction: Yankees in
three.
The other series in the American
League figures to be much more
tightly contested. For the third
straight season, the Angels and Red
Sox will clash in the first round of the
playoffs. The Red Sox have dominat
ed the Angels in the playoffs, winning
all three series against them this
decade while losing only one game in
the process. Boston is again favored
by odds makers and experts alike,
thanks to some bigger names and the
East Coast media bias, as well as a lit
tle history. However, the Angels have
the better record; they won the sea
son series against the Red Sox, they
have better hitting, coaching, defense
and baserunning than the Sox and
they have home field advantage. And
yes, they are my favorite team and I
would never think about picking
against them. But this is really a dif
ferent Angels team than we've seen
in years past, and the Red Sox are
shakier this year than they have been
(see: struggles of Josh Beckett, no
backup shortstop, injuries to many
starters and no aura around David
Ortiz). And I'm a proud homer (if
you don't know what a homer is, just
Google "Bill Simmons"). Prediction:
Angels in four.
On the other side of the Designat
ed Hitter Divide, there are two more
tough matchups, as the four playoff
teams are separated by only four wins
