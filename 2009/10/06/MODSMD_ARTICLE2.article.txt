# University offers IDs as credit cards
## 3,100 students sign up for StanfordCardPlan with $1,000 credit" 
### FATIMA WAGDY STAFF WRITER 
Last month, Stanford implemented the
StanfordCardPlan, ending the prepaid plan
previously in place a change that has
made some students happy but has left
many others still confused or unaware of
the new program.
The program allows the SUID to func
tion like a credit card with a $l,OOO limit.
Stanford will automatically bill the charges
to a statement sent to students' parents, and
any money students have left over on their
card from the previous prepaid plan will be
debited back to their student account. It is

currently also the primary way to print on
University computers, particularly comput
ers in residences.
Once on the plan, Stanford students can
use their SUID at a myriad of on-campus
facilities, including the Stanford Bookstore,
Treehouse, Tresidder Express, CoHo, Jamba
Juice and nearly all other Stanford-operated
dining facilities. To join the plan, students
must sign a contract on Axess in the Student
Center under the financial tabs.
Student Financial Services (SFS) imple

can be charged on the card per quarter; SFS
determined this as the average amount of
money that students need to spend in order

to cover all books, supplies, printing and
copying.
Since the implementation of the plan, the
biggest charges students have been making
on their new Card Plan are at the Stanford
Bookstore. However, library printers are
the source of the highest transaction vol

Mansoor Rahman, compliance officer
and interim director of Student Financial
Services, explained the reasons behind the
change in an email to The Daily.
"The purpose of the change was to pro
vide better service to students by allowing
them access to funds early in the quarter
for education-related purchases regardless

of whether their financial aid had been dis*
bursed," Rahman said. "Student Financial
in collaboration with , the
Financial Aid Office, made a recommenda
tion in spring of 2009 to change the
StanfordCardPlan, and the recommenda
tion was approved by the Student Financial
Policy Advisory Committee."
So far, a total of 3,100 students hat'c
signed up for the plan. to
Rahman, a number of students that have
signed up for the new CardPlan are pleased
with it.
