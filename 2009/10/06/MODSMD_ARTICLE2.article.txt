# University offers IDs as credit cards
## 3,100 students sign up for StanfordCardPlan with $1,000 credit" 
### FATIMA WAGDY STAFF WRITER 
Last month, Stanford implemented the
StanfordCardPlan, ending the prepaid plan
previously in place a change that has
made some students happy but has left
many others still confused or unaware of
the new program.
The program allows the SUID to func
tion like a credit card with a $l,OOO limit.
Stanford will automatically bill the charges
to a statement sent to students' parents, and
any money students have left over on their
card from the previous prepaid plan will be
debited back to their student account. It is

currently also the primary way to print on
University computers, particularly comput
ers in residences.
Once on the plan, Stanford students can
use their SUID at a myriad of on-campus
facilities, including the Stanford Bookstore,
Treehouse, Tresidder Express, CoHo, Jamba
Juice and nearly all other Stanford-operated
dining facilities. To join the plan, students
must sign a contract on Axess in the Student
Center under the financial tabs.
Student Financial Services (SFS) imple
mented a $l,OOO limit on the amount that
can be charged on the card per quarter; SFS
determined this as the average amount of
money that students need to spend in order

to cover all books, supplies, printing and
copying.
Since the implementation of the plan, the
biggest charges students have been making
on their new Card Plan are at the Stanford
Bookstore. However, library printers are
the source of the highest transaction vol
ume.
Mansoor Rahman, compliance officer
and interim director of Student Financial
Services, explained the reasons behind the
change in an email to The Daily.
"The purpose of the change was to pro
vide better service to students by allowing
them access to funds early in the quarter
for education-related purchases regardless

of whether their financial aid had been dis*
bursed," Rahman said. "Student Financial
in collaboration with , the
Financial Aid Office, made a recommenda
tion in spring of 2009 to change the
StanfordCardPlan, and the recommenda
tion was approved by the Student Financial
Policy Advisory Committee."
So far, a total of 3,100 students hat'c
signed up for the plan. to
Rahman, a number of students that have
signed up for the new CardPlan are pleased
with it.
"Based on interactions with students vis-


BECCA DEL MONTE/The Stanford Daily
iting the Student Services Center,
the StanfordCardPlan changes have
been well-received and feedback is
positive," Rahman said.
It appears now that the greatest
challenge facing the success of the
plan is getting the information out
to students about how the Card Plan
works and how to sign up, especial
ly since many students do not own
printers and use the University
printing services.
Most of those now on the plan
said they heard about it only when
they realized they could no longer
print in the traditional way on
University computers.
"I needed to print school-related
items and the only way I could do it
was to sign up for the Stanford Card
Plan, so I signed up for it," said John
Lindsay 'l2.
When asked whether or not he
planned to use the card for anything
other than printing, Lindsay said,
"No I don't, because I feel that it's
unnecessary."
Lindsay also mentioned con
cerns about the plan. "I am con
cerned with the possibility of my
card getting stolen, or I lose the card
and it's found by someone else that
might use my money to buy some
thing that I'll be forced to pay for."
A large number of students are
not on the plan, and even more
were confused or simply didn't
know about the program.
"I tried using it, but it was kind of
complicated and frustrating," said
John Shih 'l2. "I didn't know you
were supposed to sign up; I just
tried printing and it didn't work."
Other students didn't see the

need for the plan.
"I heard about the plan because
you use it to print," said Dan
Strawser 'lO. "I still don't use it
because I have my own printer, and
printing is a lot cheaper if you just
have your own printer."
Sarah Lummis 'l2 noted that
since the Card Plan operated like a
credit card, she didn't feel the need
to sign up for the program since she
already had a debit card.
"I heard about it from someone
in Sophomore College, and I decid
ed not to do it because it seemed
like one more thing to have to
worry about when paying bills when
1 could just use my debit card for
anything that I would use the card
for," she said.
