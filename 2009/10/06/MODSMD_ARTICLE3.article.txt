Due to University-wide budget cuts, the annual Mausoleum Party, held near Halloween at the
Stanford family burial site, is in peril, in addition to Full Moon on the Quad. The presidents of the Class of 2011 are attempting to secure funding from the ASSU, the
GSC and the Senate Appropriations Committee in order to be able to organize the party, which usually costs $14,000.
