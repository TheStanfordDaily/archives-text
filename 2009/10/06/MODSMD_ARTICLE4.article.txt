## "Camp Stanford" ends; other options offered 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seniors who plan to participate in "Camp Stanford"
the spring quarter before their graduation will find
themselves unable to do so due to more stringent policy
enforcement this year.
"Last year, the Graduation Quarter policies were not
fully enforced, but they are this year and have been
every other year before that," Assistant University
Registrar Celeste Fowles wrote in an email to The Daily.
Fowles nevertheless asserted that Camp Stanford
remains a viable option for seniors who hope to relax
during their last quarter on The Farm. The appropriate
status for undergraduates who want to remain on cam
pus their last quarter ("Camp Stanford") is either
"Permit to Attend for Services Only" (PSO) as a matric

ulated student or a "Post-Graduation Quarter" as a
recent graduate, which "Camp Stanford" candidates
often qualify for.
Students who take advantage of PSO status pay a
reduced tuition of $3,765 and are entitled to various
Stanford services, including campus housing.
"Stanford undergraduates can remain on campus in
their final quarter, usually spring of their senior year,
while either finishing incompletes, working on honors
[theses] or simply needing a student registration status,"
Fowles explained.
On the other hand, undergraduates who receive
early degree conferrals have the option of applying for
a "Post-Graduation Quarter."
"Post-Graduation Quarter" applicants are required
to be enrolled during the preceding quarter, to remain
in good academic and financial standing, and to current

ly reside in University housing. These students are also
required to have their degrees conferred by the first
Thursday of their post-graduation quarter.
'"Post-Graduation Quarter' housing is not guaran
teed, and matriculated students, such as those on PSO,
have priority for housing," Fowles said.
However, provided that all enrolled students have
housing, post-grads are eligible to live in University res
idences for another quarter.
"Since the students would actually be alumni during
the 'Post Graduation Quarter,' there is no tuition
assessed, just the housing costs," Fowles added.
The Post-Graduation Quarter Petition deadline is
Oct. 23 for students who will receive degree conferrals
by the end of autumn quarter. Undergraduates who will
