## H1N1 vaccines may be just around corner Vaden hopes to offer free vaccines to students by end of the month 
### JENNIFER LEE 
October may mark the end of flying pig pictures on
doors stating, "Warning: this occupant is being quaran
tined," as well as mass emails about unofficial Full
Moon events — if all goes well, the vaccine for H1N1
should be just around the corner for Stanford students.
The Food and Drug Administration recently
approved the H1N1 vaccine and U.S. Health Secretary
Kathleen Sebelius announced that adequate doses of
the vaccine will be distributed to anybody who wants to
be vaccinated. Sebelius also promised that the vaccine
would be readily available to the public beginning in
October.
Dr. Ira Friedman, the director of Vaden Health
Center, sent out a campus-wide email last Tuesday
instructing students on how to prevent and handle
swine flu. He also announced that Vaden anticipated
receiving the vaccine in later October.
No official notice has been given, however, as to
when the vaccine will be offered on the Stanford cam
pus.
"At this point, we don't know when they will be
available," said Friedman, the director of Vaden Health
Center. "Vaden has volunteered the state health
department to administer the H1N1 vaccine to stu
dents, and we've not yet heard if and when the vaccines
will be available to us."
Friedman has guaranteed that the information will
be made public once it is available to him.
If the vaccine is offered at the Vaden Health Center,
it will be offered for free to all students. Students are
encouraged to get vaccinated, especially those that are
24 years old and younger or have chronic diseases such
as asthma; such students will be the first priority group
to receive the vaccine.
"Obviously college students and college campuses
are where H1N1 is going to run most rapid," said Dr.
Gregory Gilbert, Stanford Hospital emergency medi
cine physician. "So if students can get access to the vac
cine, they should go ahead and get it."
Gilbert, along with Eric Weiss, medical director
for Stanford Hospital and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital, are credited with recently organizing a
drive-through system to diagnose patients who
may have swine flu. Patients remain in their
cars while waiting for doctors to diagnose
them, ensuring that those patients who
are infected with H1N1 will not
contaminate others in an
overcrowded emergency
room.
The drive-through

method will be able to handle a large
influx of patients if an emergency pan
demic ever should occur.
Gilbert foresees that the drive
through triage could possibly
become a new option when getting
vaccinated because of its efficien
cy and safety to healthy patients.

"I have mentioned it to a bunch
of different people and lots of peo
ple are really impressed with the
idea, and a lot of them are like,
'Why didn't I think of that idea?"'
Gilbert said. "So I do foresee a lot
of hospitals going through with
that if the pandemic goes bad."
Whether students will be vacci
nated in the comfort of their cars
or within a hospital room, stu
dents with concerns over HINI
now have an upcoming comfort.
"I do plan on getting vaccinat-

Ed and I would also feel a lot more
comfortable if the people around
me got vaccinated," said Amy
Chen 'l3. "A lot of people have
been getting sick the last two
weeks and it was really scary see
ing everyone get sick."
"It will be nice to know that
people around you are watching
out not only for their own health,
but yours as well," she added.
