## ON THE HUNT Freshmen swarm, sing and scavenge in S.F. 
### ANNE PIPATHSOUK 
w f they say shave off your eye
brows, you have to shave your
eyebrows!" predicted Stephen
Choi 'l3, as we, the freshmen of
Roble Hall, waited anxiously at
the Caltrain station on Sunday.
The Scavenger Hunt is the tradition that
we've been told is, if not the best, then at least
one of the most memorable parts of freshman
year. Hey, if Alan "Red" Ransil 'lO warns us
to not walk into Tiffany's, wear any Stanford
gear or get arrested, how could it not be?
When we arrived in San Francisco and
received the notorious list of tasks, my group
of eight other students, named The
Surrogates don't ask decided to just
start walking.
Let the scavenging begin!
We soon found ourselves picking flowers
off the trees, jay-walking like no other and
then riding the carousel at the Yerba Buena
Gardens with children who had just learned
how to walk. We were quite the confused and
rambunctious group of individuals. Was this
Stanford's plan for us all along?
We finally decided to prioritize our tasks
things we could do anywhere, things that
were actually reasonable and things that were
specific to a location.
After marking up the list and having a
plan of action, we quickly ended up in down
town, looking for lunch. We all agreed on a
small 'sos-style diner. Right when we got
there, Carissa Levingston 'l3 yelled out,
"Look! There's a cameraman!"
Without further warning, Raina Sun 'l3
and Cisco Riordan 'lO darted into the middle
of the street, frantically trying to outmaneu
ver the rushing cars.
"Follow the man in red tights!" shouted
Helena Villalobos 'l3. Suddenly, the nine of
us ran down the cleared path, chasing a man
in a red and gold medieval costume. I silently
thanked Stanford for strengthening my mus
cles to be able to tread uphill effectively.
After returning to the diner and ordering
our lunch, Alyssa Wisdom 'l3 and Julie
Fortuna 'l3 began dancing to Michael
Jackson's "Thriller" in the aisle of the narrow
restaurant. I couldn't control my laughter as I
sat on a stool between one of my roommates
and a new friend. Suddenly I realized that this
is exactly how things are supposed to be - this
restaurant, these people, this chili were exact
ly what I wanted.
After lunch, we ended up in the park
where the Breast Cancer Walk ended.

"This is pretty crowded right?" Zander
Nowell 'l3 smirked at the rest of us.
Somehow, there was a common understand
ing that we would perform and teach Roble's
infamous "Take off your pants!" cheer to the
two hundred people congregated together.
"Maybe we shouldn't do 'Take off your
pants,"' I wondered aloud.
"Why not? Let's just go!" Nowell said as
he and Choi stood in front of a group of
about 30 middle-aged women all dressed in
pink.
"Excuse me!" Fortuna shouted.
"Hi there! We're on a scavenger hunt
going all around the city and one of the things
that we need to do is teach you a cheer,"
Nowell explained.
"Oh, and we're from Stanford," Choi
added. "Are you willing to help us out?"
"Of course!" one woman exclaimed, "I've
already given one of you a back massage
today!"
Before we even finished bellowing and
dancing to "I'm Too Sexy for My Pants," the
surrounding crowd was cheering this
provocative chant with us.
"Come on, one more time!" I exuberantly
exclaimed.
Out of nowhere, a former Roblean
appeared and explained, "I could hear you
guys from all the way across the park and
needed to join in!"
From there, we continued on our way
through more of San Francisco, unable to
fight the urges to publicly fountain hop when
ever a fountain of any size came into sight.
We happened to convince a stranger that he
wanted to take a picture with our makeshift
"Get your picture taken with a Stanford
Student $1" sign, we performed poetry
right in front of City Lights Bookstore, we
experienced the many smells of Fisherman's
Wharf, we found the only In-N-Out in the
world that has no drive thru, and we even
attempted to read a traditional Chinese sign
only to eventually realize that the other side
was in English.
Sometime, somehow, somewhere along
the way, we lost our list.
Of course, we knew it was never about the
list; but only one of Stanford's countless tools
to make its students socialize, as if we need
any help with that.
Wisdom summed it up when she
remarked, "These people [the general public]
would never guess that we're Stanford kids!"
