# Bring your books, pack your clothes, but leave your fish at home

What do candles, toasters, fish,
halogen lights and gasoline all
have in common? Almost noth
ing, except that they are all pro
hibited items according to the
Housing Residence Agreement.
While most people certainly don't need to
have something like gasoline in their room,
other items such as pet fish seem relatively
innocuous.
"Come on, it's a fish!" exclaimed Kit Garton
'lO. "Show me someone who is allergic to the
mere presence of fish. They are harmless."
Garton was a Resident Assistant in Branner
last year, where she lived with her beta fish, Ted.
"I got Ted in February because I was getting
pretty lonely in my single and thought that hav
ing a fish would legitimize me talking to myself,"
Garton explained. "I kept him on my dresser,
right by my door. I'm pretty sure everyone in the
dorm knew I had a pet fish. But there are always
so many more important things to worry about
than someone having a fish. Unlike gerbils, ham
sters, snakes, etc., fish aren't going to stray too
far from their bowls. They aren't going to get
alcohol poisoning, get into fights or pee all over
the carpeting."
While Garton showed restraint in getting a
seemingly harmless animal, other students have
opted for edgier pets. There have been stories of
a snake currently on campus, as well as a squir
rel and a cat in past years. One student even had
a pet rat, which had babies.
Ale Moss 'll had a pet gecko named Gil for
the last two years, although he is now living at
home.
"I got him freshman winter," Moss said. "He
was a spur-of-the-moment decision."
Moss was undeterred in breaking Housing
rules and suffering the fine if she got caught.
"I didn't really have to take any special pre
cautions to keep [Gil] hidden," Moss said,
"because Housing doesn't really check the
rooms. "But I wouldn't carry his cage around
during move-in days or anything like that."
According to Imogen Hinds, the associate
director of Student Housing for Undergraduate
Operations/Health and Safety Program, "Policy
violations such as keeping a pet incur a fine of
$lOO per day from the date of discovery until the
pet is permanently removed from campus."
But pets aren't the only things that are taboo.
Students break Housing rules right and left. One
student in years past constructed a hammock in
Flo Mo. Underage students sneak in alcohol.
Students let their friends crash for weeks at a
time you are supposed to get approval for
any guests beyond three consecutive days or five
days a quarter. Candles are relatively easy to
come by and half of the rooms in Mirrielees
have a toaster. Students hang things from their
walls with nails and screws, smoke hookah, weed
or cigarettes in the dorms, install window air
conditioners and make plenty of noise after
approved quiet hours.
Naturally, the punishments for breaking
these rules are diverse.
"Responses to policy violations vary from
issue to issue," Hinds said. "And while it is pos
sible for students to lose their housing privileges
for violating policies, Student Housing staff do
our best to work with the Residential Education
staff to resolve issues with the students involved
whenever possible."
