## FUND MANAGERS WEIGH SALE OF ILLIQUID ASSETS 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford Management Company
(SMC), which oversees most of the
funds in Stanford University's
endowment, is exploring the option
of selling some portions of its vari
ous illiquid investments such as pri
vate equity, real estate, venture cap
ital, oil-and-gas and timberland.
While various universities,
including Harvard, have attempted
sales of illiquid assets in the second
ary market in the past year, none has
had any success due to the gaping
spread between what secondary
market investors were willing to pay
and the price at which the endow
ments were willing to sell.
Cogent Partners, a Dallas-based
boutique investment bank that spe
cializes in the private equity second
ary market, will be organizing the
potential sale.
SMC will be taking bids from
investors and secondary-fund firms
until the end of the month.
However, unlike most sales in which
institutions unload entire invest
ments, Stanford is only interested in
unloading partial interests, or 10 to
20 percent, across its various part
nerships.
If bids are satisfactory, Stanford
would consider selling up to $1 bil
lion of the $5 billion total it has
invested in illiquid assets.
The Daily will have expanded
coverage of this potential sale later
in the week.
