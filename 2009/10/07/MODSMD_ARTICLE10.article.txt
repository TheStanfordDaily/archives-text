# GET IT RIGHT
## Atlas Shrugged ... Well, the world could probably use a good shaking 
### Erica Morgan 
Freshmen and upperclassmen alike con
verged on White Plaza on Friday, Sept.
25 to take part in the annual spectacle
that is the Stanford Activities Fair. Hundreds
of students ran the gauntlet of tables as
music, solicitations and lively conversation
filled the air. Names and email addresses
were scrawled repeatedly while their owners
navigated the sea of opportunity.
Charity Fashion Show members lounged
luxuriously in aviators as the crowd surged
around them; Students for a Sustainable
Stanford foretold the coming apocalypse and
snatched trays from the hands of passersby.
My favorite method of crowd capture, how
ever, is the classic one: giving away free stuff!
Therefore, I congratulate students lucky
enough to wander past the Stanford Objec
tivist Society's table early in the afternoon:
two thousand copies of Ayn Rand's Atlas
Shrugged were offered without charge to the
passing throng. As far as free offerings go, I
venture that you can't do much better than
this.
Atlas Shrugged is the sort of book that
most college students have heard of, but few
have actually read. Written in 1957, it seems
that this epochal novel has begun to fulfill its
predictive potential. Rand's intricate story
may in fact be unfolding before our very eyes.
Atlas Shrugged describes a world built on
the ingenuity and productivity of rational
men. This world is threatened by a society
that preaches sacrifice as a moral ideal. The
leeches of this society attempt to harness the
creative energy of brilliant men. They have
no capacity to create for themselves, so they
rely on the productivity of others and at
tempt to control this productivity with legis
lation and a deeply embedded sense of social
"duty."
This book is a thrilling and emotional read
that should be experienced by all do your
self the favor of reading it, even if you com
pletely differ in philosophy. It reads like an
action/mystery thriller, provokes thought
like an epic poem, and, at times, inspires the
passion of your sexiest harlequin romance.
Without giving away significant plot points, I
would like to highlight a few pertinent mo
ments from the novel to illustrate its applica
bility to our lives today.
For instance, our modern society seems to
be caught in the throes of a similar social
movement to the one described in Atlas
Shrugged. We're conditioned to believe that
service and sacrifice are the only true means
of accomplishing happiness. Disclaimer: Be-

fore you accuse me of hating humanity, know
that I fully support altruism, just not as the
primary means to my personal happiness and
life satisfaction.

John Gait, Atlas Shrugged protagonist ex
traordinaire and regulation hottie, addresses
his audience: "Do you ask what moral obliga
tion I owe to my fellow men? ... I seek or de
sire nothing from them except such relations
as they care to enter of their own voluntary
choice," Thank you, John! Here is the distinc
tion being made: We do not owe our fellow
men anything, nor is it our right to demand
anything of our fellow men that they do not
wish to exchange voluntarily.
That said, we are lectured on the virtues of
sacrifice. Don't have a life calling? Wander
ing without purpose? Join a service group,
and you'll feel meaningful at once!
My point is not to criticize service. My
point is that your primary purpose should be
to achieve your own happiness. How can you
expect to discover what makes you happy
and what you want to do with your life when
society tells you that the most virtuous action
you can take is to put aside your personal de
sires for the greater good? Serve because it
makes you happy! Not because it is your so
cial duty!
For example: We're all here at Stanford.
We all worked very hard to be here. Superior
grades and SAT scores, as well as laundry lists
of personal achievements, were necessary to
prove our worth. You labored as an individ
ual to succeed, and you fully earned the prod
uct of your labor. Now imagine that one of
your high school peers who, for any number
of reasons, did or could not accomplish what
you accomplished academically. If it had
been asked of you, would you have sacrificed
your own academic achievements so that this
person could attend Stanford? The same
holds true now: When you work yourself
ragged in Bio lab, would you sacrifice your
success to the less productive students in the
class? I hope not.
In Atlas Shrugged, Rand pays humans the
highest praise; she assumes that we are ra
tional beings capable of survival, happiness
and productivity by the virtue of our inde
pendence and morality.
"I swear by my life and my love of it
that I will never live for the sake of another
man, nor ask another man to live for mine"
