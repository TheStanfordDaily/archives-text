# THE 						PENSIEVE
## Harry Potter and the Stanford Bubble

"Wish that they could see famous Harry Pot
ter now, he thought savagely as he spread the
manure on the flower beds, his back aching,
sweat running down his face."

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, pg. 10

Inevitably, after a certain number of weeks
into the quarter, the absence of non-Stan
ford beings and places in our lives begins
to distort our views. Suddenly, "the real
world" seems like a figment of our imagina
tion, no more tangible than a Crumple-
Horned Snorkack. The Stanford Bubble
traps us and holds us fast, almost as if by some
... er ... magic.

While Harry attends Hogwarts, he finds
himself in a magical bubble of sorts and, as a
result, he struggles when he returns to the
non-magical Muggle world. His realization
that his identity in the Wizarding world is ir
relevant in the Muggle world and his expe
riences back home have much to show us, as
we consider how to exist outside of the Stan
ford Bubble.

While Harry's title in the wizarding
world is that of the "Chosen One," or, at
least at this point of his life, "the guy who
made Voldemort temporarily disappear,"
we may also believe that our inclusion in the
Stanford community renders us as "Chosen
Ones." Sure, we may not be out to vanquish
evil or to stick wands up trolls' noses, but
with all the "you-are-here-because-you're
special" and "save the world" rhetoric (es
pecially rampant at NSO) constantly being
shoved into our faces, sometimes we forget
who we were before we came here; we find
ourselves solely focused on what these four
years will help us become. While Harry's de
fined mission in the wizarding world is to
defeat Lord Voldemort, here at Stanford we
are also given a sense of purpose, with
checklists for the route to success.

While having goals to which we aspire is
not damaging in itself, it can be disquieting.
Once we manage to poke our way back
through the distorting bubble walls into the
rest of the world, we may discover that our
constant thirst to push forward and accom
plish supposedly great things comes across
as overeager and out of place. Like Harry,
who finds himself slaving away in his Mug
gle aunt's garden, we may realize that the
world outside of what we are accustomed to
is governed by different mantras and values.
With a Harry-like dismay, we recognize that
our Stanford identities may no longer mean
as much as we thought they did. Our chal
lenge, then, is to determine how we are to
exist in these two quasi-worlds.
At first impulse, we may try to reconcile
the two worlds. We may choose to go abroad
or to actively engage in the greater Bay
Area community in order to confront the
complacency we find in the 94305; however,
at the end of the day, the gaping holes that
we feel both at Stanford and in the outside
world are still quite unsettling. Although the
Stanford Bubble may be tiny and unrealis
tic, for many of us it is the safer of the two
worlds, because we feel more defined and
equipped with purpose. Similarly, Harry
feels safer in a world where everyone knows
his name. The non-magical world is uncom
fortable because of his anonymity and the
fact that Muggles live without knowing
about the wizarding world to which he be
longs.

Nevertheless, Harry ultimately discovers
by the end of the series that his returns to
the Muggle world grounded him and, in fact,
provided him with protection. He eventual
ly stops harping on his uselessness and lack
of identity there. Don't get us wrong: Harry
wants to return to Privet Drive as much as
any upperclassman would want to revisit
IHUM, but what does become apparent is

not that he's learned to love that time and
location, but that it has had a place in and a
necessary bearing on his life.
So, perhaps it is possible that our true
challenge is not to find some way to impose
our Stanford identity on a non-Stanford
world, but to appreciate these contrasting
worlds for what they are and what they do
for us. It may be advantageous for us to rec
ognize that the non-Stanford world has
much to offer us. It can provide us with the
grounding that we need and the realization
that life is not simply about going and mov
ing toward some future destination, as Stan
ford might have us believe. Our lives as stu
dents involve more than life objectives; they
also involve gaining perspective on the im
plications of who we might become.
Of course, we could just resort to a third
world where Crumple-Horned Snorkacks
dwell. From what we've been told, they're
pretty good at grounding us to ... uh ...
nothing.
