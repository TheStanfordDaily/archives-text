Editor's Note: Between Friday night and Sat
urday morning, on the lawn in front of the
Taube Hillel House, a Jewish booth known as
"sukkah" was vandalized. The act took place
during "Sukkot," a week-long Jewish holiday.

It happened on Friday Night, and on Sat
urday morning, there was a police car in
front of Hillel. That wasn't the most
striking part of the scene, nor was it the peo
ple trying to cover the phallic graffiti so
poorly drawn that you had to look twice to
be sure that's what you were looking at. It
was the punched-in sign that read, "Come
in. Hang out. It's Sukkot. Everyone's wel
come,"
To be kosher, to be good enough to use, a
sukkah must be fragile. It must be built so
that in a strong wind, the roof will blow off
a house made of straw to remind us of the
big bad wolf, to remind us we are dependent
on something greater.
In the Jewish American experience, it is
easy to forget. In America, Jews have en
joyed prosperity and security unparalleled
in our 3,000-year history.
In Sukkot the happiest holiday of the
Jewish year, described in the Torah as the
time of our happiness we take ourselves
out of our permanent structures, our legacy
and our accomplishment, and we live for the
moment, in a temporary space in time and
place.
The intent of the person with the can of
spray paint is unclear. Was the sukkah
and the community that built it a target,
or just another blank surface available for
tagging? It is in that uncertainty where we
can feel the wind blowing at the eaves.
But what grounds the sukkah is not the
metal and canvas which make up its frame.
It is the people and community who fill it
those who came together to celebrate with
in this island in time that we have built. We
are fortunate to be in such a place, with sup
port coming from all sides.
Here at Stanford, students are immersed
in subgroups upon subgroups of involve

ment. Quite often, we separate into our own
bubbles. Through this incident, the illusory
barriers have shattered, and the strength of
the larger community has emerged. The
communities of faith have responded as if
the defiled holy site were their own, and the
students of groups based in Hillel have
asked how they can support their home.
It is customary to invite guests to join in
eating in the sukkah. The Jewish Student
Association would like to invite the entire
Stanford community to be our ushpizin
(guests) on the closing nights of Sukkot.

This Friday, there will be candle lighting at 6
p.m., service at 6:30 p.m. and, at 7:30 p.m., a
dinner in the sukkah to which everyone is
invited.
The first thing I did at the scene Saturday
morning was to repair the sign and fix the
message, as it still stands. I encourage every
one to heed it from now through the end of
the holiday: "Come in. Hang out. It's
Sukkot. Everyone's welcome."
