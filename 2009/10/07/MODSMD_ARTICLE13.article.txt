# STUDENT GOV'T
## Exec, GSC push health in D.C. 
### NIKHIL JOSHI ELIZABETH TITUS 
ASSU Executive David Gobaud
'OB M.S. 'lO and Graduate Student
Council member and fourth-year
graduate student in geophysics
Justin Brown are back from a week
long lobbying trip to Washington,
D.C. a first in memory for the
executive and one that Gobaud
called important to graduate stu
dents at Stanford.
The trip, funded by the ASSU to
the tune of $1,250 for flights and
hotels, saw the leaders meeting with
staff members from the offices of
California Reps. Anna Eshoo, Pete
Stark and Zoe Lofgren, as well as
California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and
a State Department official.
Gobaud said that two issues were
at the forefront of the Washington
talks: securing healthcare for gradu
ate students with dependents and
easing immigration policies for inter
national students travelling to and
from Stanford.
"These people do care and they
knew the issues," Gobaud said about
the staffers he and Brown met with.
"They listened. They wanted more
details. They wanted to know what
we are actually seeing on campus."
The benefit from the trip to stu
dents at the University appeared to
be minor, but Gobaud insisted that it
was "concrete."
Gobaud maintained that what the
two "are actually seeing on campus"

justified the trip. He said that gradu
ate students frequently talk to him
about private healthcare, which is
sometimes prohibitively expensive,
and their concerns that the state-run
Healthy Families program may get
the axe in future state budget crises,
as it nearly did this year.
"There's a huge concern if
Healthy Families is going away,"
Gobaud said.
Meanwhile, on the issue of inter
national student travel, Gobaud said
the two leaders tried to share
Stanford students' concerns with the
staff. Gobaud emphasized a priority
on F and J-visa holders, and
explained a typical situation for
international students.
"Students might want to go home
for Christmas, go home and get
delayed on way back in," he said.
"We wanted to see, is there away to
speed up process?"
After a meeting with a State
Department official, the answer
appeared to be "yes."
"Students, before they leave, can
make their re-entry interview
[appointment]," Gobaud said. "Two,
supposedly every consulate has an
email address that you can email if
you're a student. Let's say you don't
reserve your interview now and do it
in December. [The State
Department] said there's an expedit
ing process. So that's two concrete
things we brought back."
Their trip was coordinated with a
larger lobbying trip organized by the

National Association of Graduate-
Professional Students (NAGPS).
Although they said that they worked
with NAGPS, because the collective
aims of most students are quite simi
lar, Gobaud and Brown said that
their lobbying activities concentrat
ed on congressmen who count
Stanford as part of their constituen
cy. Other universities adopted simi
lar approaches.
Gobaud added that he wants stu
dent lobbying efforts to continue on
a range of issues, and that under
graduates should be involved in the
future.
"It's been an issue for years," he
said. "I've talked to a lot of grad stu
dents and a lot of international ones.
In general, I think what I learned
from this trip, I'd like to see Stanford
or the ASSU take a more prominent
role or get more active in state and
federal policy or advocacy."
The GSC sends representatives to
Washington and Sacramento every
year, according to Brown and GSC
financial officer and chemical engi
neering graduate student Ryan
Peacock, but Gobaud said this is the
first in recent memory for an ASSU
executive.
The GSC covered 75 percent of
the cost of the trip, while Gobaud
paid 25 percent half of his share
from the executive budget.
