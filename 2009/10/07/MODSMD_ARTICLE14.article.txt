## Stanford's Williamson Act contracts approved 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
On Monday, the City of Palo Alto
approved contracts with Stanford for
two University-owned properties
protected under the state Williamson
Act, designed to protect agricultural
land from urban development in
exchange for a tax break for proper
ty owners.

The council voted 9-0 to extend
Williamson Act contracts with
Stanford and other property owners
for at least 10 more years.
Stanford's two properties consti
tute 10.72 acres of El Camino Park in
Palo Alto and were valued together
at $126,645 this year. The city has
leased the land, designated as
"prime" in planning documents, since
1915, according to Leonie Batkin of
the Office of Stanford Real Estate.
Stanford has been in a Williamson
Act contract with the city for the two
parcels since 1973.
