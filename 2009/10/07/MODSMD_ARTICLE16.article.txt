## NO TIME TO RE-LAX Lacrosse plays five friendly matches in two days 
### CHRIS JUHNKE 
After defeating No. 3 Penn in its last game of
the 2009 season, in which it was left out of the
NCAA tournament, the Stanford women's
lacrosse team needed a vacation.The team got one
last weekend, albeit with a lot of hard work includ
ed, as the Card traveled to the East Coast looking
to kick off the new school year with a bang and get
ready for the spring season.
With a weekend of five "friendly" matches
over two days, the team was able to play together
for the first time and get a look at what to expect
this year.
"Playing games like these early in the fall is
awesome because it lets us know what we need to
work on and look forward to for the rest of the
year," said senior Dana Lindsay.
On Saturday, the Cardinal took on Harvard
and the University of Massachusetts, and Sunday
brought games against Boston College, Boston
University and the University of New Hampshire.
The games were played without a visible score
board and clock, and an official score was not kept,
but they served as away to "play against some
great competition and get a good sense of what
[the team] needs to work on for the upcoming sea
son," according to head coach Amy Bokker.
Lindsay agreed, saying,"lt's always fun for us to
take a trip to the East Coast in the fall, and we are
so thankful for the opportunity to go and play
tough competition this early in the year."
Coach Bokker also emphasized the benefit of
not keeping score, adding, "All of our players got
to play, and we had the opportunity to see some
great combinations offensively and defensively."

In addition, the Cardinal used the trip to work
off the summer rust and welcome some new faces
from the Class of 2013. Although Stanford lost co
captain Melissa Vogelsong, all-conference selec
tion Maris Perlman and midfielder Jamie Nesbitt
to graduation, the Cardinal return all four 30-goal
scorers from last season, including top scorer
Sarah Flynn (36 goals). The 2009-10 roster lists 10
new freshmen, in addition to the rest of the upper
class returnees.
Coach Bokker thinks the combination will
prove effective for the Card this year. "The fresh
men are doing really well," she said. "We have a
strong group of returners, and [the freshmen] had
the chance this weekend for the first time to com
pete side by side with them, which was great."
However, the road trip was only the beginning
of what could be a very memorable season for the
team. In the regular season, the team looks to con
tinue its dominance in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation by earning a sixth consecutive MPSF
title. For the first time this year, the championship
will also come with an automatic bid to the NCAA
tournament, something that the Cardinal are es
pecially excited about after last year's team wasn't
selected even after defeating three top-20 teams.
In the coming weeks, Stanford will continue
preparing for the excitement of the spring season,
with fall friendly matches against Saint Mary's,
UC-Davis, Cal and others. Hopefully, the Card will
continue to successfully build on each of these
matches in anticipation of the season.
With returning experience, some new talent
and lots of the practice, this could be the year for
