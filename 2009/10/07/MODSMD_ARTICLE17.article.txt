# Gerhart for the Heisman!
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Better get a seat on the band
wagon before it's too late.The
"Toby Gerhart for Heisman"
train is leaving the station.
Whatever sports cliche you use, this
much is clear: the Stanford star is a le
gitimate contender for the nation's
highest college football honor.
His credentials are, at this point,
impeccable. He leads the Football
Bowl Subdivision (Division I) in
rushing yards with 650, and his eight
touchdowns place him fourth nation
ally. And, despite having the third
most attempts of any back in the
country, he has still put up a very good
5.4 yards per carry average. He's on
track for 1,560 yards and 19 touch
downs. His stated goal is 2,000. Yes,
he's that good.
At this point, there's only one
other running back that is even re
ceiving any real Heisman hype
Fresno State's Ryan Matthews. The
other big names are either a single
part of a rotation (USC's Joe McK
night) or have seriously disappointed
thus far (Cal's Jahvid Best and Geor
gia Tech's Jonathan Dwyer). Among
the nation's running backs, Gerhart
stands at the top.
It's still early in the season, and the
Cardinal has yet to play the toughest
of their Pac-10 competition, but Ger
hart steamrolled a vaunted, top-10
UCLA run defense for 134 yards and
three touchdowns. That performance
alone made me go from a "wait and
see" mentality to a dead sprint into
the "full steam ahead!" camp. And
this was after he faced a ranked Wash
ington team and made it cry uncle
his 200 rushing yards against the
Huskies were a career high.

While the Heisman is awarded
based on outstanding performance,
not on value to one's team (like an
MVP award), it is impossible to re
move a player's worth from their can
didacy. Gerhart's importance to the
Cardinal is dramatic, and there is no
better example than in the second half
of Stanford's loss to Wake Forest, its
only loss this year. Gerhart had only
five carries in the final two quarters
and only 17 in total far below the

usual 20+ he receives per game.The re
sult? The Cardinal's offense became
lethargic and was forced to punt on
three of their four possessions, and the
Demon Deacons came back to secure
the victory.
Coach Jim Harbaugh, himself a
Heisman contender during his playing

career he finished third in the vot
ing as Michigan's quarterback in 1986
endorsed his running back.
"Yes. I believe so," he said, with re
gards to Gerhart being a Heisman can
didate. "He means so much to our
team. He's a shining star to our team
and that's what an MVP does."

His coach is on board, and both his
value and individual totals measure up
with pretty much any candidate. Plus,
Gerhart is intriguing he's a two
sport athlete and a dedicated student,
both of which lend themselves to nice

ly creative storylines for national writ
ers. So what's next?

Gerhart has to leap a number of
passers to remain in contention. The
rest of the field is a mess of quarter
backs Saint Tim Tebow of Florida is
generally considered the frontrunner
despite unspectacular stats against
weak competition. He's also battling a
concussion that may cause him to miss
time and thus lose the top spot. Texas's
Colt McCoy is also highly regarded,
and other surprising candidates (Cin
cinatti's Tony Pike and Miami's Jacory

Harris) are also in the mix.
There is an inherent bias toward
quarterbacks, as they're so heavily in
volved in every aspect of the offense,
which only makes Gerhart more of a
dark horse. Additionally, the Heisman
isn't based solely on individual merit
but also on team performance Ger
hart has to keep performing well, but
Stanford also has to continue winning,
especially as the competition gets
tougher. Finally, factors such as nation
al recognition and lore are important,
even when they shouldn't be when
deities like Tebow are in contention,
the playing ground isn't exactly equal.
But that hardly means that there
isn't support.
The "Toby Gerhart for Heisman"
Facebook group had 600 members in
less than 24 hours. In an ESPN fan poll,
Gerhart already has 2,500 votes
good for tenth overall despite not
being an option until this week.
ESPN's experts have their own poll,
and submit a new ballot after each
weekend: Gerhart came in seventh in
the most recent one. Harbaugh, for his
part, has been Tweeting non-stop
about his support for Gerhart. And, ac
cording to Pac-10 beat man Ted Miller,
some Stanford alumni, among them
former football star Alex Fletcher 'OB,
are thinking about marketing plans as
big as putting a billboard up in New
York, a la Oregon's Joey Harrington in
2001.

The campaign is underway. Do
your part, even if it's just clicking a but
ton. T-shirts are being made; wear one.
"Gerhart for Heisman" is for real.
Get on board.
