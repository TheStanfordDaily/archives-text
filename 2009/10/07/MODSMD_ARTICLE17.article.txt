# Gerhart for the Heisman!

Better get a seat on the band
wagon before it's too late.The
"Toby Gerhart for Heisman"
train is leaving the station.
Whatever sports cliche you use, this
much is clear: the Stanford star is a le
gitimate contender for the nation's
highest college football honor.
His credentials are, at this point,
impeccable. He leads the Football
Bowl Subdivision (Division I) in
rushing yards with 650, and his eight
touchdowns place him fourth nation
ally. And, despite having the third
most attempts of any back in the
country, he has still put up a very good
5.4 yards per carry average. He's on
track for 1,560 yards and 19 touch
downs. His stated goal is 2,000. Yes,

other running back that is even re
ceiving any real Heisman hype

other big names are either a single
part of a rotation (USC's Joe McK
night) or have seriously disappointed
thus far (Cal's Jahvid Best and Geor

the nation's running backs, Gerhart
stands at the top.
It's still early in the season, and the
Cardinal has yet to play the toughest
of their Pac-10 competition, but Ger
hart steamrolled a vaunted, top-10
UCLA run defense for 134 yards and
three touchdowns. That performance
alone made me go from a "wait and
see" mentality to a dead sprint into
the "full steam ahead!" camp. And
this was after he faced a ranked Wash
ington team and made it cry uncle
his 200 rushing yards against the
Huskies were a career high.

While the Heisman is awarded
based on outstanding performance,
not on value to one's team (like an
MVP award), it is impossible to re
move a player's worth from their can
didacy. Gerhart's importance to the
Cardinal is dramatic, and there is no
better example than in the second half
of Stanford's loss to Wake Forest, its
only loss this year. Gerhart had only
five carries in the final two quarters
and only 17 in total far below the
