## CARDINAL LETS ITS HAIR DOWN 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
It's not exactly a "playoff beard" the prac
tice in which National Hockey League players
don't shave their beards during the playoffs until
their team is eliminated or wins the Stanley Cup
but something interesting is going on with
some Cardinal football players' hairdos.
Something interesting is also going on with
the Cardinal football program. Six weeks into
the season, the Cardinal stands at the top of the
Pac-10, with a 3-0 conference record and a 4-1

overall record. The very same team that was pre
dicted to finish sixth in the conference, that has
n't seen a bowl game in eight years, has seeming
ly decisively turned itself around. Jon Wilner of
the San Jose Mercury News said the new team is
"tough, smart, and oozing momentum."
Indeed, for Head Coach Jim Harbaugh, there
is no looking back.
"There's always talk about last year, three
years ago, this decade," said Harbaugh. "It's ir
relevant ... It's a different team.
"So we were 1-11, had the six years of misery,
or whatever they call it.There's no rear view mir

ror for me, and I hope not for our players. It's
about this team, this season, the merits of these
players."

It seems natural, then, that in forging new ter
ritory with a winning season, the players forge
some new traditions.

On Tuesday, a fellow writer noticed that sen
ior safety Bo McNally had grown out his hair.
What was nearly a buzz cut had grown into
blonde, curly locks of hair. "I'm a little supersti
tious." McNally said, "When I had my long hair
two years ago, I made a lot of plays.
Then last year I didn't make so
many. So, I figured it was worth a
shot."
Well, why not keep going with
the hair questions? A writer asked
junior offensive guard Chase Beeler
'll about his beard.
"Seeing that we're playing as
well as we're playing, I probably
won't be shaving it 'til after the sea
son," said Beeler.
Then senior linebacker Clint
Snyder sauntered into the confer
ence room, proudly sporting a Mo
hawk, or technically speaking, a
fauxhawk. Apparently, he had had a
different cut at the beginning of the
season: "I cut the mullet off after the
Wake Forest game because we lost."
In its place, there's The Mohawk. "I
hope we keep winning, so I can keep
the Mohawk."
And Toby? The famous, or infa
mous, senior running back sports a
short cut and a clean face, but not by
choice.
"I hardly grow any facial hair,"
said Gerhart. "When I do, it's just
gross, stringy facial hair."
The playoff beard, the playoff
Mohawk, the playoff dreadlocks,
mullet, jheri curl well, does it
even work? Though data is limited,
and likely positively biased, the suc
cess rate in football seems quite
high. One notable example is Pitts
burgh Steelers' quarterback Ben
Roethlisberger. With the aid of his
beard, Big Ben led the Steelers to
their Super Bowl XL victory in 2006.
After the victory, Roethlisberger
shaved off his beard on the David
Letterman Show.
Fortunately, the players recog
nize that it is their brawn and their
brains, not their beards, that will
carry them through the rest of the
season.
"We're winning games, but we've
got to stay humble," said Gerhart.
"We've got to keep working hard
and not let up."
"The guys across from us are just
Xs," said Beeler. "The real work, the
real development, is in us. If we pre
pare for the games and really stick to
the game plans, we'll be successful."
The beards are just an added
bonus.
