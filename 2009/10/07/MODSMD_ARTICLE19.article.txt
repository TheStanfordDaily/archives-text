# Soccer gets back on right track
## Team recovers from 2008 season 
### TOM TAYLOR 
A frustrating 1-0 loss last Friday at Edwards Stadium in Berke
ley brought back bad memories of last year for the Stanford men's
soccer team. The Cardinal recorded nine defeats by that score in
2008, including both matches against the Golden Bears.
One game won't make a season, though, and up until the start
of the Pac-10 season, the 2009 team (6-2-0, Pacific-10 0-1-0) was
on markedly different form than last year's squad (4-11-2,2-6-2
Pac-10).This disparity raises the question of how a team that con
sistently underperformed less than 12 months ago is now ranked
No. 23 in the country.
To understand the real difference between these two, it helps
to look at some statistics first.
Last year, Stanford came into the Pac-10 schedule with a
record of 2-5-0. In those first seven games, the team scored just
five goals and conceded seven. Ignoring Friday's game, the Cardi
nal went 6-1-0 this non-conference season, with 14 goals scored
against six allowed.
An ancient adage in soccer is that "Goals win games, and de
fense wins championships." This saying could never be truer, and
the difference this year explains why the Cardinal have won four
more games than at the same point in 2008 and swept up the Stan
ford Nike, Bay Area and Cal Legacy Classics.
The team certainly appears to be very different in both areas
attack and defense when compared to the squad of last
year. Nine players (out of 29) left the team after the end of the
2008 season. Six new freshmen were brought in over the summer,
and several players rejoined the squad after redshirting last sea
son.
The most substantial personnel changes were in the back,
where six players left and three joined. With senior John Moore
keeping his place in goal after his solid performance last year
letting in barely 1.2 goals per match in a season where the Cardi-

Junior Bobby Warshaw's move from attack to defense has been a revelation for the
Card. The defense has been strong this year, and Warshaw has still scored three goals.
