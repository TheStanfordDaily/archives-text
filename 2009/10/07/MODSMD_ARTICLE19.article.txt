# Soccer gets back on right track
## Team recovers from 2008 season 
### TOM TAYLOR 
A frustrating 1-0 loss last Friday at Edwards Stadium in Berke
ley brought back bad memories of last year for the Stanford men's
soccer team. The Cardinal recorded nine defeats by that score in
2008, including both matches against the Golden Bears.
One game won't make a season, though, and up until the start
of the Pac-10 season, the 2009 team (6-2-0, Pacific-10 0-1-0) was
on markedly different form than last year's squad (4-11-2,2-6-2
Pac-10).This disparity raises the question of how a team that con
sistently underperformed less than 12 months ago is now ranked
No. 23 in the country.
To understand the real difference between these two, it helps
to look at some statistics first.
Last year, Stanford came into the Pac-10 schedule with a
record of 2-5-0. In those first seven games, the team scored just
five goals and conceded seven. Ignoring Friday's game, the Cardi
nal went 6-1-0 this non-conference season, with 14 goals scored
against six allowed.
An ancient adage in soccer is that "Goals win games, and de
fense wins championships." This saying could never be truer, and
the difference this year explains why the Cardinal have won four
more games than at the same point in 2008 and swept up the Stan
ford Nike, Bay Area and Cal Legacy Classics.
The team certainly appears to be very different in both areas
attack and defense when compared to the squad of last
year. Nine players (out of 29) left the team after the end of the
2008 season. Six new freshmen were brought in over the summer,
and several players rejoined the squad after redshirting last sea
son.
The most substantial personnel changes were in the back,
where six players left and three joined. With senior John Moore
keeping his place in goal after his solid performance last year
letting in barely 1.2 goals per match in a season where the Cardi-

nal lost 11 out of 17 games it is the
defensive line in front of him, rebuilt
from scratch over the winter, that has
gone through the most changes.
Switching junior Bobby Warshaw,
arguably the Cardinal's best striker last
year with three goals and two assists,
into the backline might have raised
some eyebrows at first, but it seems to
have worked and gives some insight
into head coach Bret Simon's philoso
phy. With three goals and one assist al
ready to his name, Warshaw and the
team in general is showing that he
can play and attack from anywhere on
the field.
In the words of Chairman Mao,
"The only real defense is active de
fense," and this new back four will be
instrumental in turning defense into at
tack and, ultimately, for scoring goals.
At the front, a combination of new
talent and returning players has added
energy and creativity to the attack. The
goals are being spread out fairly equal
ly among the forwards and attacking
midfielders, which is symbolic of a
team that has strength in depth and
does not rely too heavily on the for
tunes of one or two stars.
Senior striker Evan Morgan, re
turning to the team after injury, ex

plains that last year "we weren't so far
from where we are this year." The dif
ference is that this year, team cohesion
and chemistry have really come to
gether, and the "players know their
roles."
"We could only move up" is how
senior Thiago Sa Freire summed up
last year. That might sound pretty neg
ative, but the frustration of last season
is working to drive everyone on now.
The six-game winning streak they
racked up in September is a result of. in
Morgan's words,"not settling for losses
like last year."
The players sound assured and
ready for the fight, but as the setback
on Friday showed, the team's work is
not finished. They registered far more
shots than the Golden Bears, but none
hit the back of the net, and that's the
only statistic that really counts.
But that defeat, the wins this year
and last season's disappointment are
now forgotten history. It will be the next
nine games that really decide whether
2009 will be a year to remember.
With an experienced coaching staff
(Simon has led teams to the NCAA
soccer tournament eight times), heaps
of talent and confidence from a great
start, the team is aiming high. In the
words of Taylor Amman, the goal is not
just to qualify for the NCAAs, but to
"win the Pac-10."
