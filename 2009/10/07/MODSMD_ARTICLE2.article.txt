# STUDENT GROUPS
## New interfaith group speaks up FAITH. is acclaimed by campus religious community 
### MILES UNTERREINER 
Two Stanford undergraduates launched
a student-led organization last week dedi
cated to promoting constructive interfaith
dialogue a move proving to be particu
larly timely in the wake of Friday night's
vandalism at Hillel House.
Faiths Acting In Togetherness and Hope
(F.A.1.T.H.) held its first meeting on Sept.
29 in what co-founder Anand
Venkatkrishnan 'lO called a drive to
"engage in common action for the common
good."
Established as a "counter-voice to a phe
nomenon of young people committing vio
lence to the soundtrack of prayer,"
F.A.I.T.H. is inspired, its leaders said, by
social justice activists like Mahatma
Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Dorothy
Day, Nelson Mandela and, more directly,
Rhodes Scholar and Obama administration
advisor Eboo Patel, founder and executive
director of the Chicago-based Interfaith
Youth Core (IFYC).
Patel, who delivered the Stanford Office
for Religious Life's Roger W. Heyns
Lecture last year, leads the IFYC's interna
tional push to foster "mutual respect and
pluralism among young people from differ
ent religious traditions by empowering
them to work together to serve others."
Patel and F.A.I.T.H. share the same mis
sion, Venkatkrishnan and fellow co-founder
Ansaf Kareem 'lO said. Looking to counter
a rising tide of what Patel termed "religious
totalitarianism," the "belief that only my
group dominates, and others suffocate,"
Kareem and Venkatkrishnan envision a
world in which the power of public service is
harnessed to build trust between young
people of different religious backgrounds
and, they emphasize, those of "none at all."
F.A.I.T.H. has drawn praise from the
highest echelons of the Stanford religious
establishment, including Reverend Scotty
McLennan, dean for religious life, who
praised an email Venkatkrishnan sent in
response to Friday's vandalism of Hillel as
evidence of the group's constructive
potential.
"There's a concrete example of the
organization at work," McLennan observed,
calling the email "an eloquent statement."
McLennan also spoke favorably of
F.A.I.T.H.'s campus-wide appeal, compar
ing it with the similar but slightly more insu
lar 16-member Fellowship for Religious
Encounter (FRE), which currently brings
leaders of religious groups into conversa
tion with one another once a week during
the academic year. While the FRE, of which
Venkatkrishnan has been a fellow, "is an
