# STUDENT GROUPS
## New interfaith group speaks up FAITH. is acclaimed by campus religious community 
### MILES UNTERREINER 
Two Stanford undergraduates launched
a student-led organization last week dedi
cated to promoting constructive interfaith
dialogue a move proving to be particu
larly timely in the wake of Friday night's
vandalism at Hillel House.
Faiths Acting In Togetherness and Hope
(F.A.1.T.H.) held its first meeting on Sept.
29 in what co-founder Anand
Venkatkrishnan 'lO called a drive to
"engage in common action for the common
good."
Established as a "counter-voice to a phe
nomenon of young people committing vio
lence to the soundtrack of prayer,"
F.A.I.T.H. is inspired, its leaders said, by
social justice activists like Mahatma
Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Dorothy
Day, Nelson Mandela and, more directly,
Rhodes Scholar and Obama administration
advisor Eboo Patel, founder and executive
director of the Chicago-based Interfaith
Youth Core (IFYC).
Patel, who delivered the Stanford Office
for Religious Life's Roger W. Heyns
Lecture last year, leads the IFYC's interna
tional push to foster "mutual respect and
pluralism among young people from differ
ent religious traditions by empowering
them to work together to serve others."
Patel and F.A.I.T.H. share the same mis
sion, Venkatkrishnan and fellow co-founder
Ansaf Kareem 'lO said. Looking to counter
a rising tide of what Patel termed "religious
totalitarianism," the "belief that only my
group dominates, and others suffocate,"
Kareem and Venkatkrishnan envision a
world in which the power of public service is
harnessed to build trust between young
people of different religious backgrounds
and, they emphasize, those of "none at all."
F.A.I.T.H. has drawn praise from the
highest echelons of the Stanford religious
establishment, including Reverend Scotty
McLennan, dean for religious life, who
praised an email Venkatkrishnan sent in
response to Friday's vandalism of Hillel as
evidence of the group's constructive
potential.
"There's a concrete example of the
organization at work," McLennan observed,
calling the email "an eloquent statement."
McLennan also spoke favorably of
F.A.I.T.H.'s campus-wide appeal, compar
ing it with the similar but slightly more insu
lar 16-member Fellowship for Religious
Encounter (FRE), which currently brings
leaders of religious groups into conversa
tion with one another once a week during
the academic year. While the FRE, of which
Venkatkrishnan has been a fellow, "is an
incredibly positive thing," said
McLennan, "what Anand and
Ansaf are doing is bringing it to the
entire student body ... they're real
ly stepping it up to a new level."
F.A.I.T.H. has also met with an
enthusiastic reception among lead
ers of existing Stanford-affiliated
religious groups, who have largely
applauded the group's welcoming
and inclusive approach.
"I think it's a really positive
thing," said Jessica Galant 'lO,
Jewish representative to Stanford
Associated Religions. Galant, who,
along with Venkatkrishnan and
Kareem, will attend IFYC's confer
ence at Northwestern University
later this month, praised the organi
zation's "overarching idea of reli
gious pluralism."
"By opening your mind to other
people," she said, "you're better
able to ask questions of yourself."
Rafael Vasquez 'l2, president of
the Baha'i Association at Stanford,
agreed. "We're all very excited
about it," he said, describing "this
idea of interfaith" as "something
Baha'is want."
Vasquez emphasized the particu
lar appeal of interreligious action to
members of Baha'i, a belief system
that recognizes the legitimacy of
figures from many religious tradi

tions and one he called "a faith
based on the unity of all people for
one common cause and one com
mon faith."
Fellow Baha'i Jenna Nicholas
'l2, who attended F.A.I.T.H.'s inau
gural gathering last week, con
curred, stressing the particular rele
vance of the group's vision to the
Baha'i community.
"It's completely in line with the
principles of the Baha'i faith,"
Nicholas said, commending
F.A.I.T.H.'s embrace of universal
humanitarian principles. "Love
your neighbor, care for people
these are fundamental tenets" of all
religions, she said.
Nicholas also lauded the organi
zation's service-oriented approach:
"More than just dialogue and talk
ing about things," she noted, "it's
putting people into action."
F.A.I.T.H. has also successfully
reached out to those who describe
themselves as nonreligious, includ
ing members of Atheists,
Humanists, and Agnostics at

Stanford (AHA!). AHA! publicist
Lewis Marshall, a second-year grad
uate student in chemical engineer
ing, noted a sense of "shared values"
with other groups in attendance at
F.A.I.T.H.'s meeting last week.
"We [the members of AHA!]
believe moral value comes from
upholding human dignity and
reducing human suffering,"
Marshall said. "This is a part of the
morality supported by people of
many religions." He added that the
F.A.I.T.H. leadership, and particu
larly Venkatkrishnan, "has been
warm and welcoming to our group,
and to me personally."
While F.A.LT.H. will continue to
hold weekly meetings on Tuesday
nights in Old Union, its next large
event, said Kareem, will be an
"Interfaith Day of Youth Service."
The day will include both an act of
public service to the community
and a "reflection event" afterward,
during which participants will dis
cuss "what coming together to do
service means, from our different
faiths, from our different angles,
and what we share in terms of why
we're doing this in the first place."
Scheduled for later this fall, the
founders hope the Day of Youth
Service will expand upon the foun
dation built last week upon
which F.A.I.T.H. members hope, as
Galant put it, "a lot of good, positive
work can be done in the world."
