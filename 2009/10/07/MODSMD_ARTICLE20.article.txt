# Let's toughen up IMs
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
The words Notre Dame con
jure up one thing: football.
From "Rudy" to Lou Holtz
to the "Play Like a Cham
pion Today" sign in the Fighting
Irish's locker room, Notre Dame is
synonymous with football.
The love of football in South
Bend can be found on the intramu
ral fields, where any Notre Dame
student can pad up and play full
contact football.
That's right, full contact foot
ball. Helmets, cleats, shoulder
pads, all of it. With just one signa
ture on the waiver form, Notre
Dame students play actual foot
ball.
Here at Stanford, intramural
(IM) flag football players are in
structed to avoid contact like it's
the swine flu.
You want to be a blocker in IM
football? Keep your hands behind
your back at all times and gently
try to obstruct the oncoming rush
ers. Extending your arms while
blocking is a foul, and that's not
the only anti-contact rule.
Fumbles are dead balls. Block
ing punts is not allowed. No con
tact with a receiver within five
yards of the line of scrimmage.
There are no kickoffs.
I'm sorry. I thought I signed up
for football, not Powder Puff.
IM sports are designed to allow
everyone a chance to play sports,
regardless of skill level. And that is
exactly what corequisite (Coßec)
and Division II leagues do. Divi
sion I is for experienced athletes
who take the sport seriously.
If you're afraid of a little con
tact on a crossing route over the
middle, don't play D-I. It's that
simple.
Stanford requires all IM sports
participants to sign a waiver form,
clearing the University of any re
sponsibility. It's not a big step to
allow a little contact.
Unfortunately, football is not
the only IM sport feeling the wrath
of the University's overprotective
hand.
In IM dodgeball, the traditional
red rubber kickballs have been re
placed with a spongy foam ball.
Apparently some employee
thought the kickballs might hurt a
little too much. It's called dodge
ball. Dodgeball. The goal of the
game is to dodge the ball. A little
motivation has never hurt any
body.
The only victim the new foam
ball can claim is my shoulder.
Throwing the softer, lighter ball
tore apart my shoulder, giving me
my first arm problem in the 19
years I've been playing baseball.
In IM softball, the traditional
ball has also been swapped out in
favor of a "safer" squishy ball. Not
only are the new balls awkward to
throw, they are impossible to hit
hard. And for what purpose? To
protect the third baseman from a
line drive off the chest? It's called
the hot corner for a reason; stay
alert and everything will be fine.
It really isn't a surprise that the
University involves itself so heavi
ly in IM sports, considering the
way it micromanages our lives on a
daily basis.
Stanford students already have
a nerdy, tree-hugging reputation.
How does the University respond
to the public perception of the
Cardinal? Enforcing quiet hours
starting at 11 p.m. on Thursdays
(use a library if you're trying to
finish up a problem set); closing
Late Night dining on the week
ends (when else do you want late
night food more than 2 a.m. on a
Saturday); and, to top it all off,
possibly prohibiting students from
lofting their beds (I'm speechless).
A little contact in IM football
could do this school a whole lot of
good.
All I want is for sports to be
played the way they were meant to
be played. By all means, make Di
vision II and Coßec as safe and
enjoyable as possible for anyone
who cares to play. For Division I
though, let the kids play. Injuries
will happen, but that is the nature
of sports.

Mike Lazarus is ready for an IM
sports revolution. Let him know if
you're with him at mlazarus@stan
ford.edu (unless you're a nerdy tree
hugger, of course).
