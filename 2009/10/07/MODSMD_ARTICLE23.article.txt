### â€“ Sam Svoboda 
The Stanford men's basketball
team received a big recruiting boost
on Monday, when highly-touted
class of 2010 prospect Anthony
Brown committed to the Cardinal.
The 6'6" Brown, the No. 41 recruit in
the nation according to Scout.com,
chose Stanford over Pac-10 rivals

Cal and UCLA.
"Coach [Johnny] Dawkins knows
what he's doing," said Brown. "I
want to be able to play basketball
after college, and I felt like he's the
best person to help me do that."
In addition to being the 41st
ranked recruit overall, Brown is 7th
nationally among small forwards.
The Huntington Beach, CA native
joins John Gage from Vashon, WA
(ranked 17th among centers) and
Aaron Bright from Bellevue, WA
(ranked 39th among point guards)
as Dawkins' 2010 recruits. With a few
more undecided high school seniors
also considering Stanford, Brown
has high hopes for the future of Car
dinal basketball: "If we get this right,
we can be Pac-10 champions and
NCAA champions in a few years."
