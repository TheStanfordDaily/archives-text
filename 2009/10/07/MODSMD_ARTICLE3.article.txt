# MAUSOLEUM: NEXT TO DIE?
## Halloween party funds threatened, say juniors 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
This looks like an off year for
Stanford's October fests.
With officials cancelling Full Moon on
the Quad last week to prevent the spread
of flu, it seems that another little piggy
the bank threatens Mausoleum Party,
with the junior class presidents struggling
to find necessary funding and students
beginning to feel the full weight of
University budget cuts.
A financial precedent was set in 2005
that delegated Mausoleum planning to
class slates but left the University to foot
the bill. These expenses were then paid
for using the "Absolute Fun" fund, a tem
porary reserve that was never intended

be an indefinite funding source. After the
fund ran out at the end of last year, jun
ior class officers encountered their first
road block financing Mausoleum
soon after their election.
"We've been working on it for a
while, and we've exhausted every single
option we have for funding," said Class
President Mona Hadidi 'll. "We tried to
look off-campus for companies that have
supported Stanford parties in the past,
but with the economy being as bad as it
is right now, nobody's really willing."
While much of the cost, including
security and transportation, is fixed, the
junior class representatives sought to
scale down the $14,000 costume party to
accommodate the budget deficit. Last
year's $BOO DJ, for example, will be

replaced by students, reducing the cost to
$2OO, and plans are also in the works to
purchase decorations and the like from
outside vendors instead of Events &
Labor Services.

These alterations, however, only
trimmed down expenses by $2,000.
The junior class budget for this year,
$16,685, will restrict the class from cover
ing both Mausoleum and junior formal,
for which the swanky San Francisco
venue alone took out $16,000 from the
junior class pocket last year.
"If we had to spend all of our budget
on Mausoleum, we would have a very
low-budget formal nowhere near the
type junior classes have had in the past,"

fund" ran dry. Junior class presidents, charged with budgeting the party, are now looking to other sources to fund the October fest.
said President Dante DiCicco 'll.
"And doing the community service,
CoHo nights and academic events
that we have on our agenda would
be out of the question. That's why
we're definitely willing to give $2,500
we feel like we're being very gen
erous on that. But we're not willing
to compromise the junior class being
able have their experiences as a class
for this academic year."
Beyond the funding shortage,
the juniors are unsure if it is fair for
them to even assume this obliga
tion. "It's not our responsibility,"
Hadidi said. "This is an event that is
attended by both the graduate and
undergraduate populations, so it's
not really our responsibility to pay
for it."

Looking for Help
With that position in mind, the
junior class presidents took action
to commission other members of

the student body to share that
responsibility. Their first proposal,
which was sent to the
Appropriations Committee during
the first week of school, yielded an
offer of $3,000. As this amount does
not approach the full costs of
Mausoleum, the presidents
approached the Senate last week in
an effort to obtain more financial
support.
"We were trying to argue that
they should give us the full amount
of money they could give a student
group or maybe even more
because we're more than a student
group," DiCicco said. "This is much
more than a student group-spon
sored event. This is sponsored by an
entire class for the entire school."
The ASSU, which often provides
funding for student group endeav
ors, has a cap of $6,000 for volunteer
student organizations and $7,000 for
community service groups. Though
the Mausoleum Party, in the hands
of the junior class slate, falls in the
first category, the ASSU Senate was
hesitant to pledge the entire $6,000.
According to Senate Chair Varun
Sivaram 'll, very few, if any, sena

tors are willing to provide the junior
class presidents with all of the allot
ted resources for VSOs. At last
night's Senate meeting, Senator
Anton Zeitsman 'l2 went further,
expressing that the presidents have
not done enough to find funding
before approaching the ASSU.

"The fact of the matter is I do not
like at all the way we've been going
about this," Zeitsman said. "If we
are willing to consider funding the
party, I want them, A, to actually
have a meeting with the sophomore
class presidents; B, for them to actu
ally have a meeting with the
Graduate Student Council... and,
C, to actually sit down with their
budget and go line item by line item
and work to find ways to minimize
the cost."

Senator Zachary Warma 'll, also
The Daily's column editor, attrib
utes ASSU constraints, in part, to
the fact that the ASSU budget,
which is dependent on the earnings
of the Stanford Student Enterprises,
is not only reserved for the junior
class but for other student groups as
well. This breadline of student
organizations seeking financial sup

port from the ASSU is expected to
be longer this year than in others
due to budget cuts.
"We have to be really financially
prudent with how we spend,"
Warma said.

However, many senators claim to
be on the same side as the junior
class slate.

"As much as people may deride
student government and see us as
removed, we're students too [and]
we go to these events," Warma said.
"There's unanimous support to
fund them at some level," Sivaram
added. "The [differences] come
when we decide at what level to
fund them."
All In
The success, then, of Mausoleum
appears to be contingent on the col
laboration of several organizations.
The junior class presidents have
already spoken with ASSU
Executives David Gobaud and Jay
De La Torre, who gave them $1,500,
and are working to approach the
sophomore class presidents and the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
soon for a joint meeting with the

ASSU Executive and some ASSU
senators.

The sophomores a viable
source with excess funds that were
originally reserved for the now can
celled Full Moon event seemed
eager to step up to the plate.
"Just to see another event in jeop
ardy of being cancelled, I think hits
really close to home for us," said
sophomore class president Adrian
Castro 'l2. "I feel that we have a
responsibility to a degree to help
them out."
Details about how much the
sophomore class slate can con
tribute are still up in the air.

"We would like to offer some
support, and we are planning on
doing that. [But] right now we're
talking to people who work with our
money to try and figure out what we
can give," Castro said.
Although Hadidi approached
Dean of Freshmen Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'B9, the freshmen were given
less consideration as a source of
financial support, especially because
the Class of 2013 has yet to elect stu
dent representatives. No one even
spoke to the seniors, according to

Hadidi.
"Seniors are kind of a different
entity," Hadidi said. "They've got
more to deal with pub nights,
graduation. We talked to [Student
Activities and Leadership Director]
Nanci Howe about it and she was
like, 'I would leave the seniors alone
because they have a lot.'

"We decided not to contact
them," Hadidi added.
Sivaram was cautiously opti
mistic about the situation. "I think
Mausoleum has a great chance of
succeeding this year but that's not to
say that this has any bearing on how
likely this works for next year," he
said.

For now, at least, it is very likely
that an impromptu Mausoleum
Party, much like Sunday's rendition
of Full Moon on the Quad, will be
unnecessary, as the financial
prospects for this year's event seem
promising.

The junior class presidents and
the ASSU expect to have final deci
sions made by the end of this week.
