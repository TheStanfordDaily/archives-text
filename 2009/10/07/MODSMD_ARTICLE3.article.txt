# MAUSOLEUM: NEXT TO DIE?
## Halloween party funds threatened, say juniors 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
This looks like an off year for
Stanford's October fests.
With officials cancelling Full Moon on
the Quad last week to prevent the spread
of flu, it seems that another little piggy
the bank threatens Mausoleum Party,
with the junior class presidents struggling
to find necessary funding and students
beginning to feel the full weight of
University budget cuts.
A financial precedent was set in 2005
that delegated Mausoleum planning to
class slates but left the University to foot
the bill. These expenses were then paid
for using the "Absolute Fun" fund, a tem
porary reserve that was never intended

be an indefinite funding source. After the
fund ran out at the end of last year, jun
ior class officers encountered their first
road block financing Mausoleum
soon after their election.
"We've been working on it for a
while, and we've exhausted every single
option we have for funding," said Class
President Mona Hadidi 'll. "We tried to
look off-campus for companies that have
supported Stanford parties in the past,
but with the economy being as bad as it
is right now, nobody's really willing."
While much of the cost, including
security and transportation, is fixed, the
junior class representatives sought to
scale down the $14,000 costume party to
accommodate the budget deficit. Last
year's $BOO DJ, for example, will be

replaced by students, reducing the cost to
$2OO, and plans are also in the works to
purchase decorations and the like from
outside vendors instead of Events &
Labor Services.

These alterations, however, only
trimmed down expenses by $2,000.
The junior class budget for this year,
$16,685, will restrict the class from cover
ing both Mausoleum and junior formal,
for which the swanky San Francisco
venue alone took out $16,000 from the
junior class pocket last year.
"If we had to spend all of our budget
on Mausoleum, we would have a very
low-budget formal nowhere near the
type junior classes have had in the past,"

fund" ran dry. Junior class presidents, charged with budgeting the party, are now looking to other sources to fund the October fest.
