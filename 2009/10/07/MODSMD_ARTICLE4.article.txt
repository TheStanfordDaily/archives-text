## Senate votes for budget; BJA is empty Senators express frustration with Mausoleum finances 
### NIKHIL KAMAT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In their second meeting of the year, under
graduate senators last night enacted two bills
mandating the creation of a yearly appropria
tions budget and establishing a budget for the
2009-10 academic year.
Senators also discussed budget modifications
for the ASSU Green Store and the Wellness
Room, and continued deliberation, without reso
lution, on the Mausoleum Party funding impasse,
as well as the appointment of student representa
tives to the Judicial Affairs Board.
Mausoleum Negotiations Continue
Senators briefly discussed how to best address
budget shortfalls hampering the execution of the
Mausoleum Party. The Senate decided to table
discussion until the junior class presidents had
finalized their negotiations with the sophomore
class presidents and the Graduate Student
Council (GSC). (See "Mausoleum: next to die?,"
front page.)
Senate Deems Budget Necessary
The Senate voted unanimously to enact a bill
proposed by Senator and ASSU Treasurer Alex
Katz 'l2 that would mandate the creation of a
yearly appropriations budget.
The new budget would require the
Undergraduate Senate chair, deputy chair, ASSU
treasurer and ASSU financial manager to assem
ble a yearly budget prior to the first Senate meet
ing. The yearly budget would mandate a cap on
total general fund expenditures and establish
monthly guidelines for expenditures or quarterly
presentations on the activity of the appropria
tions committee.
Any expenditure beyond the established
budget would require a two-thirds approval for
each individual appropriation request.
The Senate also unanimously approved a bill
sponsored by Katz to establish a budget for the
2009-10 fiscal year. The bill will establish a 1:1
ratio between the undergraduate funds reserve
and the general fee budget. Katz hopes such a
ratio will prevent overspending of the funds
reserve and provide a buffer for future ASSU
senates. Last year, the ASSU spent $112,107.35
from the funds reserve on top of a budget of
$298,000. According to Senate Chair Varun
Sivaram 'll, the undergraduate community
stands to have about $30,000 less available com
pared to last year, including reserve funds. The
exact amount will vary depending on the amount
of money returned to the ASSU from unspent
special fees.
Judicial Affairs Diversity Row Continues
After meeting with Stanford's general coun
