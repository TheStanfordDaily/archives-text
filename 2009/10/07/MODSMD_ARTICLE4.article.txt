## Senate votes for budget; BJA is empty Senators express frustration with Mausoleum finances 
### NIKHIL KAMAT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In their second meeting of the year, under
graduate senators last night enacted two bills
mandating the creation of a yearly appropria
tions budget and establishing a budget for the
2009-10 academic year.
Senators also discussed budget modifications
for the ASSU Green Store and the Wellness
Room, and continued deliberation, without reso
lution, on the Mausoleum Party funding impasse,
as well as the appointment of student representa
tives to the Judicial Affairs Board.
Mausoleum Negotiations Continue
Senators briefly discussed how to best address
budget shortfalls hampering the execution of the
Mausoleum Party. The Senate decided to table
discussion until the junior class presidents had
finalized their negotiations with the sophomore
class presidents and the Graduate Student
Council (GSC). (See "Mausoleum: next to die?,"
front page.)
Senate Deems Budget Necessary
The Senate voted unanimously to enact a bill
proposed by Senator and ASSU Treasurer Alex
Katz 'l2 that would mandate the creation of a
yearly appropriations budget.
The new budget would require the
Undergraduate Senate chair, deputy chair, ASSU
treasurer and ASSU financial manager to assem
ble a yearly budget prior to the first Senate meet
ing. The yearly budget would mandate a cap on
total general fund expenditures and establish
monthly guidelines for expenditures or quarterly
presentations on the activity of the appropria
tions committee.
Any expenditure beyond the established
budget would require a two-thirds approval for
each individual appropriation request.
The Senate also unanimously approved a bill
sponsored by Katz to establish a budget for the
2009-10 fiscal year. The bill will establish a 1:1
ratio between the undergraduate funds reserve
and the general fee budget. Katz hopes such a
ratio will prevent overspending of the funds
reserve and provide a buffer for future ASSU
senates. Last year, the ASSU spent $112,107.35
from the funds reserve on top of a budget of
$298,000. According to Senate Chair Varun
Sivaram 'll, the undergraduate community
stands to have about $30,000 less available com
pared to last year, including reserve funds. The
exact amount will vary depending on the amount
of money returned to the ASSU from unspent
special fees.
Judicial Affairs Diversity Row Continues
After meeting with Stanford's general coun
sel, Sivaram announced the creation of an ad hoc
panel to interview candidates for the
Board of Judicial Affairs (BJA). This
committee will be composed of three
yet-to-be-chosen representatives
from the GSC, three undergraduate
representatives, and one representa
tive each from the Nominations
Commission (NomCom) and the
executive cabinet. The undergradu
ate representatives are Kelsi
Wharton *l2, Sivaram and Zachary
Warma 'll. According to Sivaram,
these representatives were selected
on a first-reply basis via email.
The creation of an ad hoc panel is
the latest development in the feud
between the judicial affairs commit
tee and the ASSU concerning the
selection process governing appoint
ment of student representatives to
the BJA. In order to address diversi
ty concerns, the Office of Judicial
Affairs asked NomCom to replace
two candidates. Instead of reviewing
the two spots in contention, the ad
hoc committee plans to review all six
positions under consideration.
"I just want to say, if we immedi
ately gave the four away, there would
be undue pressure on us to take for
those two spots one, if not two
females, and then frankly we'll be no
better off than the office of Judicial
Affairs making decisions based on
questionable characteristics," Warma
said.
Senator Sivaram qualified
Warma's statement by adding that
the ad hoc committee also needed to
establish clear guidelines for future
appointees to the BJA. Interviews
for the board will be held next week,
and nominees will be announced at
the upcoming Undergraduate
Senate meeting at the earliest.

Wellness Budget to be Modified?
Director of Health Promotion
Services Carole Pertofsky and
Wellness Room head coordinator
Debanti Sengupta, a graduate stu
dent in chemistry, approached the
ASSU Senate to promote modifica
tions to the Wellness Room budget,
adding $3,700 to officer salaries,

$2,300 for miscellaneous program
ming and $5OO for marketing.
The budget modifications were
proposed by ASSU Vice President
Jay de la Torre TO.
The Wellness Room is a less-than
year-old initiative intended to pro
mote mental and physical well-being
and combat academically related
stress, which Pertofsky urged the
Senate to consider as an opportunity.
"It's not just a space, but a set of
programs and services, a paradigm
shift that is going to transform this
campus culture into something that
is sane and healthy," Pertofsky said.
The Senate voted to table voting
on the budget modification until
next meeting because no specific
programming guidelines were avail
able when it was proposed. The
group, however, did choose to
approve a $6,365.98 boost to the
Green Store, also proposed by de la
Torre.
The budget modification, he said,
is intended to expand product inven
tory and supply miscellaneous costs
related to staffing, marketing and
other materials.
Limon's Seat Vacant
Following the mention last meet
ing of former Senator Daniel Limon
'l2's leave of absence, the
Undergraduate Senate discussed the
possibility of amending the ASSU
constitution in order to address
future vacancies. Senate members
expressed concern about the ambigu
ity regarding the replacement of sen
ators who resign or are unable to
carry on the duties of the office.
Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe stated that in previous
years, replacements were appointed
for Senate vacancies on an ad hoc
basis.
Pending confirmation of Senator
Limon's whereabouts and intentions
to continue with his tenure, the
ASSU decided to table the discussion
until more information is available.
"When I spoke with him two
weeks ago, he expressed his intent to
return to the Senate," Sivaram said.
"He has medical reasons and he's not
sure how long they'll last."
