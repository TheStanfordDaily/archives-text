## Stanford grad marks innovative trek 
### RYAN MAYFIELD 
A 2009 graduate from Stanford's journalism
program safely returned on Tuesday from a
nationally heralded reporting trip to the so
called Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
Now, Lindsey Hoshaw M.A. 'O9 says young
Stanford entrepreneurs can take a lesson from
her project, whose untraditional funding gar
nered national attention this summer from the
journalism community an industry, by all
accounts, in a financial crisis of its own.
The Daily caught up with Hoshaw last week
when she was still at sea, where she encouraged
young reporters and entrepreneurs to dive into
risky projects.
"Especially now, I'd tell journalists to take

risks," she wrote from the Alguita, a 50-foot
catamaran en route back to Long Beach,
California. "This project was risky in so many
ways."
Her initial pitch to travel to the ecologi
cally strained "garbage patch," and write about
what she witnessed was tentatively accepted
at the New York Times, but with a caveat:
Hoshaw had to foot the bill.
As Times public editor Clark Hoyt wrote in
July, Hoshaw turned to the community-funded
news site Spot.Us to raise $6,000 for the voyage.
The newspaper might pay $7OO for Hoshaw's
photos, and possibly more for a story. Those
details, Hoshaw said, are still being sorted.
Still, the Times' offer to publish Hoshaw's
photos was a step up from where the trip

began.
"At the outset I didn't know who would
publish the story or how I would fund it,"
Hoshaw said. "But I believed in the piece and I
believed something interesting would come out
of it and that conviction convinced others that
this was something worth pursuing."
"I think that having an entrepreneurial
mindset is the best way for journalists to stay
current and create their own opportunities
instead of waiting for them to appear," she con
tinued.
So last month, soon after graduating from
Stanford's graduate program in journalism,
Hoshaw boarded the Alguita as a guest of
