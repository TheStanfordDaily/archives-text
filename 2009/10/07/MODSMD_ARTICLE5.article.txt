## Stanford grad marks innovative trek 
### RYAN MAYFIELD 
A 2009 graduate from Stanford's journalism
program safely returned on Tuesday from a
nationally heralded reporting trip to the so
called Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
Now, Lindsey Hoshaw M.A. 'O9 says young
Stanford entrepreneurs can take a lesson from
her project, whose untraditional funding gar
nered national attention this summer from the
journalism community an industry, by all
accounts, in a financial crisis of its own.
The Daily caught up with Hoshaw last week
when she was still at sea, where she encouraged
young reporters and entrepreneurs to dive into
risky projects.
"Especially now, I'd tell journalists to take

risks," she wrote from the Alguita, a 50-foot
catamaran en route back to Long Beach,
California. "This project was risky in so many
ways."
Her initial pitch to travel to the ecologi
cally strained "garbage patch," and write about
what she witnessed was tentatively accepted
at the New York Times, but with a caveat:
Hoshaw had to foot the bill.
As Times public editor Clark Hoyt wrote in
July, Hoshaw turned to the community-funded
news site Spot.Us to raise $6,000 for the voyage.
The newspaper might pay $7OO for Hoshaw's
photos, and possibly more for a story. Those
details, Hoshaw said, are still being sorted.
Still, the Times' offer to publish Hoshaw's
photos was a step up from where the trip

began.
"At the outset I didn't know who would
publish the story or how I would fund it,"
Hoshaw said. "But I believed in the piece and I
believed something interesting would come out
of it and that conviction convinced others that
this was something worth pursuing."
"I think that having an entrepreneurial
mindset is the best way for journalists to stay
current and create their own opportunities
instead of waiting for them to appear," she con
tinued.
So last month, soon after graduating from
Stanford's graduate program in journalism,
Hoshaw boarded the Alguita as a guest of

Captain Charles Moore and set off
for the "garbage patch," an area of
the north-central Pacific dense with
plastic waste, large and small, con
centrated there by ocean currents.
Even though Hoshaw was a vir
tual unknown when the project was
getting started, she said her entre
preneurial spirit helped lead her to
the project in her final year at
Stanford, when, in spring quarter,
she enrolled in an environmental
journalism class taught by
Professor Tom Hayden.
"[Lindsey] came in with a pas
sion for the environment," Hayden
said. "She left with the intellectual
tools to understand environmental

stories as a journalist at a deeper
level, so going from passion to
knowledge and ability in away that
is going to make her environmental
coverage as she goes forward [be]
much more powerful and engaging
and ultimately have more impact."
While at Stanford, Hoshaw also
worked on waste audits, discover
ing more about what is thrown
away locally. That work came full
circle when she was at sea, where
she found the wide range of trash:
from toilet seats to umbrella han
dles and toy wheels.
She wanted to clarify, however,
the garbage "patch" misnomer.
"The media has tended to focus
on its size, calling it everything
from a floating landfill to a plastic
toxic soup that's twice the size of
Texas," Hoshaw said. "In reality, it's
actually very difficult to quantify
how big the patch is. How do you

analyze something that is constant
ly moving?"
Now back on land, Hoshaw said
that she will delve deeper into the
world of journalism, working on
this piece as well as two others for
Sunset and Outside magazines.
Over the next few years, she hopes
to continue working on similarly
adventurous stories.
"A great editor once said the day
you cease to take interest in the
things you write about is the day you
need a break from journalism,"
Hoshaw said. "I'm far from that
point; journalism still keeps me on
my toes and continues to teach me
something new each day. What other
job would allow me to sail across the
Pacific Ocean amid a mass of plastic
trash?"
