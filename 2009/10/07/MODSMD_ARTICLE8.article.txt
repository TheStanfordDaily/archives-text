# Faith and Facebook
## When social networking and spirituality collide 
### JEN PITTMAN 
Facebook has been popular on campus for the past
half-decade, but has it grown beyond the social
Religious relationships are challenging, if not nearly
impossible, to foster over the Internet. Students and religious
leaders on campus indicate that many religious groups at
Stanford have used Facebook for advertising purposes, but
that it has not managed to become an independent source of
religious zeal on campus; it has been unable to inspire discus
sion and true community.
Some groups such as the Atheists, Humanists and
Agnostics (AHA!) said many Atheists have used the
Internet as a forum for intellectual discussion. But students in
this group report that the most meaningful discussions they
had were in person, not on the Web.
Lewis Marshall, a second-year graduate student in chemi
cal engineering and the public relations coordinator for
AHA!, considers Facebook a tool to generate interest in
events where discussions take place.
"I think [Facebook] is a method for groups to get their
advertisements out so they can get people together in the
same place to talk," Marshall said. "Most of the real conversa
tions take place in person."
While Facebook can be used to provide knowledge about
opportunities to interact at religious events, it can also take
away from some of the most fundamental opportunities for
interaction and community on campus.
Religious leaders, such as Rabbi Dov Greenberg, advisor
to the Rohr Chabad House, made the point that it is difficult
to have any extended discussions on Facebook. They explain
that conversations may be continued for short periods
through messaging and wall posts, but for issues that are truly
deep or meaningful, it is better to speak in person.
"Facebook and all electronic communication is less per
sonal, and it is harder to connect," Greenberg said. "Facebook
is a wonderful tool to advertise the events, but it is not the best
venue to discuss them."
Members of groups such as Rohr Chabad House and
Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship both see the importance of
using Facebook to reach students and faculty around
Stanford.
"We better use the most modern technology out there to
make sure that the power of faith and religion is used in a pos
itive way," Greenberg said, explaining a reason why Facebook
was such a necessary tool. "That is the best way we have to
ensure a more gracious world in the future."
Greenberg went on to explain that faith and technology
have an integrated relationship in the modern world, much
like the codependent relationship of the fingers and thumb.
With only one of the two, a person could survive, but without
one part, life would not be as complete.
David Kim 'lO, student president of Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship, continued in the same vein when he suggested
that in order for a religion to remain viable in a rapidly chang
ing society, it must be able to adapt and use the tools available.
"It is a Christian role to go where people are, where people
are moving," he said. "I definitely think there is a place for
Christianity or Christian efforts on Facebook."
Although it is seen as crucial to reach out to people on
Facebook, students in religious organizations are having diffi
culty gauging their impact on campus when people are hesi
tant to share their beliefs on such a public Web site.
According to Joe Foley, a third-year graduate student in
genetics and the student president of AHA!, one of the main
reasons why people do not join the AHA!'s public Facebook
group is because their friends and family are able to see which
groups they belong to.
This hyperawareness of Facebook's public nature also
makes people think twice about posting their religious affilia
tions on Facebook. Kim said people start labeling and judging
others based upon the religions with which they associate
themselves on Facebook.
"It's easier to not have it on [Facebook]," Kim said, "and to
not have to explain yourself to the entire world."
These attitudes are reflected through the statistics of cam
pus religious groups. There seems to be a consensus that
Facebook is not the most effective way to spread the word
about an event or a student group.
For example, Foley said AHA! has four times as many peo
ple subscribed to their email lists than joined in their
Facebook group. Rabbi Greenberg estimated that for an
event 150 students would attend, about 25 responses would
come through Facebook while the majority of the other
responses would come by email.
Facebook may be the most prevalent Internet resource for
social networking, but it has not proven to be as popular for
religious groups and events. Community, it seems, cannot be
created without face-to-face interaction.
