## EDITORIAL We will not stand for the silencing of student press 
### 
Los Angeles City College's student-run
newspaper, the Collegian, is an award
winning publication that has been in
continuous print for 80 years. Its staff of ap
proximately 30 students works tirelessly to
publish high-quality content while adhering
to rigorous journalistic values. The Collegian
is a training ground for writers, reporters,
columnists and editors, as are thousands of
other student-run publications that hold to
the same principles, standards and ethics.
But LACC's president, Jamillah Moore,
has made calculated attempts to hinder the
students' right to a free press. She has tried to
forbid a company working with the college
from speaking to the student press; she has
tried to pressure student reporters to sign re
leases for recording public meetings; she has
violated California Open Meeting Laws by
requesting that reporters identify them
selves; and she has attempted to silence the
Collegian by slashing its budget by 40 per
cent when the budgets of other student or
ganizations were cut only 15 percent. Adam
Goldstein of the Student Press Law Center
said that if he had to choose the biggest First
Amendment offender in the country, he
would most likely choose Moore. And now,
Moore is attempting to move the Collegian
under student services, where the adminis
tration would have the option to edit all con
tent, monitor stories and determine the di
rection of the paper.
An attack on free speech anywhere is an
attack on free speech everywhere. That is
why we, the undersigned, have come togeth
er to universally condemn the actions of
Jamillah Moore and the actions of any ad
ministration that makes deliberate efforts to
break the free speech of student publica
tions.
As students, we have been taught to ex

pect an environment where freedom of
speech will go uncontested. And as student
journalists, we expect our administrations to
understand that we strive to be an objective
voice of reason. But we also recognize that
any publication that disturbs the comfort of
the comfortable will be challenged. Student
journalists at the University of Pittsburgh,
the University of New Mexico and the Uni
versity of Oregon, as well as countless untold
others, have seen such assaults on their rights.
This cannot stand.
We, as student journalists, come together
today with a single message: We will not tol
erate administrations that, for their own ben
efit, try to silence the voice of the student free
press. We will continue to rebuke those in
power who attempt to diminish that free
dom, and we will not be silenced.
