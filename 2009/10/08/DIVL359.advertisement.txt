REDEFINING SOUL FOOD: POLITICS AND PLEASURES
OF FOOD AND EATING IN THE BLACK COMMUNITIES
BRYANT TERRY (ECO-CHEF, FOOD JUSTICE ACTIVIST, AND AUTHOR)
Bryant Terry is an eco chef, food justice activist, and author of Vegan Soul
Kitchen (VSK): Fresh, Healthy, and Creative African-American Cuisine. For the
past nine years he has worked to build a more just and sustainable food system
and has used cooking as a tool to illuminate the intersections between poverty,
structural racism, gender and food insecurity. His interest in cooking, farming,
and community health can be traced back to his childhood in Memphis,
Tennessee, where his grandparents inspired him to grow, prepare, and
appreciate good food.
Vegan Soul Kitchen will be available for purchase at the event.
Co-sponsored by The Program in African and African American Studies, The Program
in Human Biology, Modern Thought and Literature, Black Graduate Students
Association, and Feminist Studies.

improve their situation. Can a small group of workers really make a difference?

THE GARDEN PROJECT: GROWING PLANTS, GROWING PEOPLE
CATHRINE SNEED (FOUNDER, THE GARDEN PROJECT)
Working with the land has been healing activity for many. The Garden Project, which is an intensive program for former offenders
and at risk youth, takes this idea and runs with it by teaching students a wide array of horticulture skills. Started in 1992, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has called The Garden Project "one of the most innovative and successful community-based crime
prevention programs in the country."
