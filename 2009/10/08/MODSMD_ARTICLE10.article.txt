# Hi. I'm a Laptop.

### CAITY MONROE 
We've all noticed
them. You walk
into class, take a
seat, lean back in
your chair and
look out across the lecture hall
preparing for a solid 50 minutes of
note-taking (or Internet surfing).
Amid the sea of mono-toned lap
tops pops a bright collage of politi
cal slogans, witty remarks and
obscure bumper stickers.
Many students have decided to
use their laptops as creative outlets.
Laptops can now help students
establish some originality and com
municate something about them
selves to the wandering eyes of a
bored classmate.
With a purple case, keyboard
protector and a personally
designed track pad cover, Olivia
Haas' 'll laptop is a prime example
of this increasingly prevalent trend
in laptop decor.
"I kind of like to stand apart
from the majority," she said. "As the
owner of a white Macbook, assert
ing some individuality is key."
Ralph Nguyen 'l2 has stickers
all over both of his laptops. He
explained that his stickers display
what he's interested in and he is
often approached by those who
share his interests.
For example, he has two stickers
from "reddit," a social news website
that he reads.
"I'll just be sitting at a table and
they'll come up to me and strike a
conversation," Nguyen said. "I met
one of my best friends like this, so
it's a cool way to meet people."
Matt Crowley 'l2 also uses his
decorations to establish himself as
part of a community. His computer
is usually covered in stickers.
"It's usually some sort of out
door company," he said. "The out
door community is really into stick
ering anything and everything."
Options for various laptop
accoutrements abound and chances
are, no matter what obscurity stu
dents are in search of, they'll be

able to find it after only a few min
utes on the Internet.
Websites like skinweaver.com
and laptopskins.com offer an array
of unique categories of laptop skins.
Whether it's comradery and social
acceptance in a CS class ("Geek
out"), some stylistic edge ("Bling"
or "Fashionista"), a weird partially
clothed World of Warcraft girl
("Temptress") or a unique and
potentially judgment-inducing con
versation starter (any of the above)
students seek, there are entire class
es of laptop skins that can assist.
While many students choose
laptop adornments as away to
express themselves, some focus on
decor that offers practical applica
tions as well. For example, students
may opt to purchase a keyboard
protector after a fifth coffee spill
and the sad realization that a lack
of fine motor skills and severe caf
feine addiction is a lethal combina
tion and that their computers
are unlikely to survive much
longer.

Many students mentioned that
functionality often plays a part in
picking out various laptop accou
trements.
"They all serve both aesthetic
and functional purposes, such as
keeping my laptop clean while
being eye-catching," Haas said.
Tatiana Iskandar 'l2 also has
unique accessories for her lap
top. Visitors to her dorm often
make a pit stop at her desk to
admire her tulip USB flash drive,
hot pink mouse and headphones
with little duck figures on the
earbuds.
But Iskandar explained that she
wouldn't want to choose anything
more permanent to accompany the
tulip and ducks. She, along with
many other Stanford students,
expressed concern about having a
change of heart.
"I wouldn't want to put any
stickers or anything like that on it,"
she said. "I wouldn't want to ruin
my laptop if I ever changed my
mind about decorating it."
Some students, however, don't
feel the need to accessorize or
beautify their laptops.
"I would never decorate my
Macbook," said Jordan Gray 'l3.
"It's sexy the way it is. I don't want
to mess it up."
Frances Ellerbe 'l2 worried that
colorful stickers or playful orna
mentation might not set the best
environment for productivity.
"I like to have my workspace
very focused and organized," she
explained, adding that she likes the
serious simplicity of her current
laptop. "It gets me in the right state
of mind for working."
And some students, while not
necessarily opposed to altering
their laptops, simply haven't found
anything worthy yet.
"I have definitely considered it,
but I haven't found any I like
enough," said Andrew Wahba 'l2.
"You can't just have any sticker go
on your laptop."
