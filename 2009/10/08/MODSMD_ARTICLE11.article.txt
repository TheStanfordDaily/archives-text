## EDITORIAL GSC places gender balance before representation 
### 
The recent decision of the Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC) to rescind its ap
proval of the Nominations Commission
Slate for the Body of Judicial Affairs has
brought to light a bureaucratic as well as
moral mess within the nomination process.
The slate, which was approved in May, was re
scinded on the grounds that there was not
enough gender diversity in the group of six
that featured one female and five males.

tion are the ramifications of rescinding the
slate and opening the interview process anew.
The committee appears to be seeking gender
balance before representation a danger
ous path to travel. The diversity suggestions
concerning race, gender and field of study
have been enough of a guiding light in the
past. More importantly, the nominations
process has worked to appoint students who
are willing and passionate about BJA policy
to represent the student body. And looking at
the field of applicants, i.e. the Stanford stu
dent population, how could one go wrong?
Not only is our student body knowledgeable,
but the University does a marvelous job pro
moting diversity education and awareness.
The students of Stanford are defined by their
intellectual passion and ability, not by their
physicality. In a day and age when gender is
becoming less of a dichotomy and more of a
sliding scale, limiting a committee by a stan
dard of "x" number of girls and "y" number of
boys only limits the representative nature of
the committee at large.

While there is no specific requirement for
gender ratio, the Board on Judicial Affairs
(BJA) asks for "3 Undergraduate students
and 3 Graduate students, preferred. Diverse,
reflective pool of Stanford student popula
tion, including gender, race/ethnicity and field
of study needed. Preferably to include one
student from each of 6 or 7 schools." These re
cent votes and the decisions that have fol
lowed raise an important question of what di
versity actually constitutes.

Due to the array of policies that concern
the BJA from honor code violations to
theft and sexual harassment a diversity of
gender should definitely be encouraged.
When crafting policy that deals with issues
that concern each gender differently, espe
cially sexual assault or sexual misconduct, a
representation of each gender would provide
a more balanced view of the situation as well
as how the policy would affect each popula
tion. But besides sexual assault and miscon
duct, most, if not all BJA policies deal with
non-gendered issues such as property dam
age or misuse of University property.
If the BJA has no explicit requirements for
gender balance and its policies are not gen
der-specific, why is gender balance necessary
to achieve diversity? In times when women
were routinely barred from or silenced in
upper-level positions, it was a necessity to re
quire gender diversity so that women could
be represented. But today, when women have
a voice and the ability to express themselves,
it seems an outdated concept to require
women to fill certain positions. Women do not
need a call to action to act. On the other hand,
rejecting the slate because it was mostly male
could be considered a form of reverse dis
crimination against the male nominees based
on their gender. All of these concerns may be
raised in light of the ongoing issue at hand.
More important to this gender conversa-

If gender balance is deemed crucial to BJA
policies, the move to create such a committee
should begin from the ground up, in the nom
inations process. The retroactive move by the
GSC and BJA has only muddled up the bu
reaucratic process. Worse, however, is the
heightened tension over what constitutes
gender diversity due to a lack of strict guide
lines or rules. If there needs to be more gen
der balance, create a future-sighted policy.
Moving forward, the goal of a diversified
committee should begin with enticing a
broader pool of nominations, if that is what is
being sought. If the head of this judicial body
moves but the body of students does not, no
progress will be made.

The current ad hoc panel is in place until a
new slate is interviewed, a move away from
the imbalanced approach of replacing four of
the candidates based on gender require
ments. A need has been found to define strict
guidelines to committee diversity; both of
these steps are crucial to untangling the knots
of bureaucracy that have tied up any move
ment in the BJA. When all is said and done,
the committee will hopefully be diverse and
representative, moving forward with solu
tions to the gender diversity issue for future
decisions.
