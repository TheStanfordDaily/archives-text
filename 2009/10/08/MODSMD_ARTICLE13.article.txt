# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## "Bocca della Verita" 
### Emily Hulme 
As my legion of loyal Twitter followers
knows, I am currently not at Stanford.
Indeed, Serena van der Woodsen, Brit
ney and I were hiding out from the paparazzi in
an undisclosed location/lair for the summer
until an emotional fight over the best type of
eyeliner led us to conclude that we're better off
as awkward acquaintances than as cohabitating
frenemies. While B and S headed off to "rehab,"
I'm currently whiling away my days in Rome. It
totally sucks.
Basically, I misunderstood that whole "She-
Wolf" founding Rome story and have spent
the last two weeks looking for Shakira. In ret
rospect, I should've just gone to the wax muse
um in Vegas. I'd miss the Forum and Caesar,
but I could've seen styro-wonderful Greek
gods, caught a pirate show and not needed to
worry about a gypsy stealing my passport out
of my fanny pack on the bus. I'll pass on the
tragedy and go directly to farce next time.
Not everything here is the same as back
home. Hulu is blocked. Sometimes it rains. And
true Marxists are all over and no, I don't
mean in the sense of the rhetorical lens used to
analyze the sociopolitical conflicts in junior
high gym classes in Baltimore. Here they have
what I like to think of as Marxism before it was
neutered by academia, forced to suffer a bour
geoisie afterlife, robbed of its real potency.
While I haven't observed any communist poli
ticking in America (as I consider Berkeley a
foreign country), religious fundamentalists in
the States also call for radical transformation,
demand group commitment and assert a back
ing in something pretty stiff ("science of histo
ry;" that "God" guy). So, hammer and sickle for
them, "guns and religion" for us.
These admittedly strange bedfellows are
both sort of anathema to our modus operandi.
I suppose the major way we address belief is
what I think of as relativism of convenience.
Or, call it "believe whatever you like, so long as
you don't hurt anyone else"-ism. This has the
viscerally satisfying feature of feeling morally
superior to some sort of rigid dogmatism based
on antiquated dichotomies of "good" and
"bad."

Where Reagan represented that dogma
tism when inarticulately calling the USSR the
"empire of evil," Obama plays the well-educat
ed exponent of relativism of convenience
when he asserts crises are really just misunder
standings, rather than significant, potentially

irreconcilable ideological conflicts. That is,
until he switches from "no system of govern
ment can or should be imposed by one nation
on any other" to an absolute commitment to
deliberately undefined human rights, rescuing
the United States from some nihilistic policy
straitjacket.
Easy-going relativism hits the fan when all
ideas aren't equal. If Marx was right, others
must be wrong. If global warming is an issue of
national well-being, it's pretty dumb to "not
judge" people driving Hummers filled with red
meat and incandescent light bulbs. I personal
ly don't find it ethically charitable to let others
persist in their ignorance.
This, of course, leads us to the overwhelming
treasure trove of claims to truth. One way out is
to decide we shouldn't bother genuinely
searching for any variety of universal truth,
since it doesn't exist (alternately formulated ei
ther as there is no truth, or that it's socially con
structed). Some precocious students of this
school have declared our habit of preferring
Western treatments of HIV to more natural
remedies unfounded, providing valuable talk
ing points for AIDS deniers. You can connect
the dots on why Richard Dawkins has declared
cultural relativism a "sinister" threat to science.
Our other choice is to accept that truth,
while difficult to see and perhaps only under
standable in some piecemeal fashion, does
exist and is meaningful to our lives. This re
quires taking ideas seriously. Some will be
right; their contradictions will be wrong. Judg
ment and change will be necessary, and, above
all, intellectual courage will be demanded. This
is the integrity to stand up to "fashionable shib
boleths" and to back down when you are,
plainly and simply, wrong. The real beef I have
with pop relativism is that it suggests we can't,
or shouldn't, make demands of our ideas and
our peers. Stanford is filled with brilliant stu
dents; if there is any place in the world you can
search for what really matters, this is it.
The horrible reality is that Mom and Dad's
banal common sense is right after all: you have
to work for anything worth having, period.
That's probably why we haven't been able to
summarize truth into a bumper sticker-friendly
statement. And that's probably why you came
to this university in the first place.
