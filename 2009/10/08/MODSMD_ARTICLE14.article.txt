## Corrida de toros: the beautiful sacrifice 
### Patrick Kozey 
On Sunday, Sept. 27,1 was one of 19,000
who watched the matador Jose Tomas
in what may have been Barcelona's
last corrida de toros. It was not the first corri
da I had seen, but I doubt very much that I will
ever see one better. Corrida de toros is Span
ish for "bullfight," and its terminology is
tough to translate. You'll be far more likely to
hear the Spanish say torero or maestro than
matador when referring to the men trained in
the art of killing bulls. Torero because it indi
cates his function is torear, to engage with and
vanquish the bull, maestro, or "teacher," be
cause he is charged not only with killing the
bull, but with teaching it how to fight once it
gets in the ring. Matador is the only one that
mentions the act of matar , to kill. By any of
those names, Tomas is one of the best.
The corrida is on its way out in Cataluna.
The Assembly of the region is considering a
ban. For Cataluna, nationalist politics are in
the mix, along with the obvious charges of
cruelty to animals. In Spain in general, youth
interest is waning, and it remains to be seen
what will happen in the coming decades.
What of it? Who am I to say anything about
an antiquated blood sport that has no place in
my heritage or in my future? How can I de
fend a fight that is so clearly unfair?
I understand the arguments against bull
fights. They are brutal, violent affairs that en
tertain our basest instincts. They are also hon
est, in away we are almost never honest
today. The corrida forces us to see what spec
tacle has always been about at its most basic:
sacrifice.

First, the mechanics.

Briefly: A typical corrida has three toreros
and six bulls, and by the end, each man will
have killed two bulls. The bulls are put
through their paces, being led through a few
pasos, "passes," charging yellow and pink
capes. Other men weaken the bull. The pica
dor, a man on horseback, armored for safety,
gores the bull in the back with a spear. Three
more men stand in the ring and face the bull,
head to head, then jump when it rushes them,
sticking it with two spear-like sticks. Finally
the torero comes out with his muleta, a small
red cape and sword. More pasos riskier, el
egant they are the real heart of the fight.
And finally, with a sword made to be lethal,
the crowning moment: the kill. One stab and,
if the torero is skilled, the bull drops. Some
times it takes more, but the whistles and jeers
start soon after.

The two times Tomas stepped into the ring,
there were no whistles, no jeers, and when he
was done, the crowd did not return to its seats
for a long while. The other toreros were not of
the same caliber, with one producing kills so
bloody and prolonged that he quickly retreat
ed from the stadium. We in the stands had not
come to see that sort of slaughter. We had
come to see sacrifice.

Every Sunday, in churches all across
America, a sacrifice is rehearsed. A religion
that looks forward to uplifting the downtrod
den begins by fetishizing the act of stabbing a
man with a spear while nailed to a wooden
crucifix. All the good of the church flows for
ward from a foundational moment of vio
lence, so it's no wonder we have tried to dis
tance ourselves from it. We've made the mir

acle of transubstantiation into a metaphor,
we've pushed aside the fire and the brim
stone, but, when Mel Gibson has only to put
the Stations of the Cross on film to break box
office records, who are we kidding? The veil
we've hung up between our "elevated" state
and our "barbaric" past is a thin one at best.
We codify the impulse to kill first into sac
rifice, and then into rituals reliving that sacri
fice. We methodically distill the violence until
all we are left with is the comfortable abstrac
tion. The packaged meat in the deli counter.
The communion wafer on our tongues.
How can I defend the corrida ? How can I
call such brutality art? Because rather than
reliving our violent past, I propose we learn
from it. To do that, we cannot forget.
On Sunday, I sat and watched with 19,000
others as a ritual was performed in front of
me. A sacrifice was made. Watching Jose
Tomas was exhilarating, not because of the vi
olence of his actions, but because of his grace.
In the pasos of Tomas, there was an honest en
gagement with the fact that death is our most
basic contribution to this world. In the plaza,
death is laid bare. There is blood on the sand,
on the gold embroidered clothes of the mata
dor, on the red cloth of the muleta. A corrida
may not make us understand death. Nothing
could. But for a few hours on a Sunday after
noon, it does something almost as unthink
able: it makes death beautiful.

Patrick Kozey knows he has just said some things
that probably make you think he is at best pedan
tic, and at worst, an asshole. He'll be happy to ad
dress such concerns atpkozey@stanford.edu.
