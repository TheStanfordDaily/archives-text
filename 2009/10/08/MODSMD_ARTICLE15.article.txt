## Nobel Laureate Sharpe expounds economic advice 
### ZACK HOBERG 
Audience members could not
decide between laughter and baffle
ment last night as William Sharpe,
Nobel Laureate in economics,
jovially explained how futile it is to
place faith in financial experts.
"The average investor," he said,
pausing for dramatic effect, "cannot
beat the average investor." He pro
ceeded to explain the economic
principle that he developed and, in
many ways, built his name.
It boiled down to the simple fact
that any risk that can be diversified
away using financial instruments is
no longer a risk, and loses the possi
bility of massive returns.
"If you take a risk in expectation
of higher returns," Sharpe told a full
Cubberly Auditorium, "you could
get high returns you could get
really high returns. You could also
get your head handed to you."

The famed economist illustrated
his point by splitting the audience
into two groups: a third, he pro
posed, would invest their money
equally across the entire global
market. The remaining two-thirds
would research, learn about mar
kets, and try to be intelligent
investors. The average returns,
according to Sharpe, would be the
exact same across the two groups.
Despite the distrust in financial
experts' predictive abilities, Sharpe
was not against their presence in the
system. In fact, Sharpe told his audi
ence that those people doing
research and trying to beat the sys
tem served a valuable purpose to
the system as a whole: they ensure
that the prices for stocks and other
financial tools do not vary too far
from their actual values.
"Active managers you change
your minds, the brokers like you,
you get nice seats at baseball games,
but you don't get any more money."
The discussion unfolding on
stage soon moved from the unrelia
bility of the individual financial ana
lyst to the financial crisis and the
unreliability of the financial system
as a whole. Sharpe seemed almost
resigned to the behavior of the
banking industry in the recent
recession.

"Financial people did what
financial people do," Sharpe said.
"They took a lot of risks so if things
turned out well they got really rich
and if things didn't .. . you and I
bailed them out."
Sharpe upheld that the main
issue of the banking crisis was that
companies such as AIG became so
large that they needed to be bailed

out.
"If it's too big to fail, it's too big
to exist," Sharpe said of the prob
lems with the national economy.
His argument rested on the con
clusion that if the government cre
ates conditions where there are
huge upsides to risks but the down
sides are minimized through gov
ernment handouts, companies and

individuals will take much larger
risks than are healthy for the econ
omy as a whole.
As soon as a company's survival
is tied to the American government
because America could not afford
to lose it, Sharpe argued, the com
pany is incentivized to take risks
that are bad for the nation as a
whole.

"Maybe the insurance pieces
were safe," Sharpe said of the reces
sion after the talk in an interview
with The Daily. "Companies got too
big, too interconnected. We need to
consider putting some limits on size
and scope so we can legitimately say
that we won't bail you out."
"The problem with AIG was
three old guys in London making
enormous bets."
He consistently argued that once
firms get too big, there is nothing
that can be done to prevent at least
some kind of bubble.
"Everyone can spot a bubble,"
Sharpe told a captivated crowd." ..
. Afterwards."
The audience seemed to under
stand and appreciate Sharpe's
insights.
"I enjoyed his broad based mar
ket ideas," said Mike Kerry, the
boyfriend of a Stanford graduate
student, after the event. "It seems
that I might as well go with standard
funds. [l] Might as well not pay for
all the expensive investment funds."
"If it's hard for someone with an
MBA to make economic decisions
about investing," asked Karen Fox
('64), "imagine how it is for people
who aren't quantitative, who are
janitors, or other professions."
When asked after the event what
advice he would give to Stanford
students, and college students in
general, Sharpe had very strong
opinions.
"You better save a whole lot
because the long term prospects of
Social Security and Medicare are
not good," he said. "To make them
whole would take $6O trillion in a
safe somewhere on top of what we
already have."
"You could work your whole life
for one company, get a fat check
when you retire, and be set for the
rest of your life," he continued, com
paring his own situation to what stu
dents will eventually be facing.
"We don't have that anymore,
and I don't think we can unless
we become Europe, but I don't see
that happening. Although I've
always liked Europe."
