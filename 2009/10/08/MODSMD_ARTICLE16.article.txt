## CARD'S PALM DRIVE Men's golf heads to Palm Springs for The Prestige at PGA West 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's golf team
heads to La Quinta, Calif, this weekend to
co-host the 10th annual Prestige at the PGA
West Intercollegiate Invitational with UC-
Davis. The Cardinal is known for its good
showings at this course, taking third place
last year, second place in 2007 and the tour
nament crown in 2006.
"Everyone is excited to get down there
and play well," head coach Conrad Ray said.
"It is essentially our home tournament as a
co-host. The stadium course at the PGA
West is a challenging course, but we have
been practicing hard this week and doing all
that we can on our end at school."
The participating teams were invited to
play in this tournament on the premise that
they exhibit a strong dedication to both aca
demic and athletic excellence, according to
tournament organizers. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, Stanford's golfers get to tee off
with some of the best teams in golf. Stanford
will go head-to-head with No. 5 Washington,
its top competitor in the tournament.
In addition to the Husky-Cardinal rival
ry, the tournament will feature some famil
iar faces, including the 2008 Champions, No.
20 TCU. Only four total Pac-10 Conference
