## CARD'S PALM DRIVE Men's golf heads to Palm Springs for The Prestige at PGA West 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's golf team
heads to La Quinta, Calif, this weekend to
co-host the 10th annual Prestige at the PGA
West Intercollegiate Invitational with UC-
Davis. The Cardinal is known for its good
showings at this course, taking third place
last year, second place in 2007 and the tour
nament crown in 2006.
"Everyone is excited to get down there
and play well," head coach Conrad Ray said.
"It is essentially our home tournament as a
co-host. The stadium course at the PGA
West is a challenging course, but we have
been practicing hard this week and doing all
that we can on our end at school."
The participating teams were invited to
play in this tournament on the premise that
they exhibit a strong dedication to both aca
demic and athletic excellence, according to
tournament organizers. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, Stanford's golfers get to tee off
with some of the best teams in golf. Stanford
will go head-to-head with No. 5 Washington,
its top competitor in the tournament.
In addition to the Husky-Cardinal rival
ry, the tournament will feature some famil
iar faces, including the 2008 Champions, No.
20 TCU. Only four total Pac-10 Conference

GAME NOTES: No. 6 Stanford had a strong showing in

Stanford men's golf team will travel to the Palm Springs area to take on several top teams at The Prestige at PGA West this weekend.
teams will be in attendance, includ
ing No. 10 USC and UCLA, which
was ranked No. 15 in the preseason.
Other competitors include No.
46 Pepperdine, No. 48 Vanderbilt,
No. 55 Notre Dame, No. 61 Central
Florida, No. 73 UC-Davis, No. 110
University of San Diego, No. 213
Flawaii and unranked Long Beach
State.
Stanford will be on the offensive
again, looking to reclaim tourna
ment glory; however, the course
will not cut the Cardinal any slack.
This course is known to feature
many difficult, professional PGA
Tour-level holes, such as the 17th
hole, which is listed as the "Alca
traz" par-3 "island hole."
"This is the hardest golf course
in the Palm Springs area," Ray said.
"It will be fun because it was used
for the PGA Tour qualifying tour
nament. We are going to set it up
this time in the same way with the
same PGA hole locations.
"This course is visually tougher
than it plays." Ray continued. "It
has a lot of visual intimidation, lots

of sand and water. However, if we
hit good shots, we should be fine.
I'm excited to see what happens be
cause the course will be a good test
and good preparation for our guys
who want to take their game to the
next level."
Despite the normal hurdles asso
ciated with the tournament, Stan
ford has a deep team that exerts
glowing potential for the upcoming
year. In fact, the Cardinal posted a
fourth place finish, and junior Steve
Ziegler finished tied for sixth over
all, in Stanford's first tournament of
the season at Illinois.
Though Ziegler has been called
the Cardinal's go-to guy by
Golfweek, Ray emphasized that
each player has the skill to come
out on top each week.
"All five of our guys have a legit
chance of teeing it up and winning
regardless of where we are or who
we play," Ray said. "This feeling of
depth is really neat because each
guy has proved to be a great leader
for us."
Play at the Prestige at the PGA
West will begin Sunday, Oct. 11.
