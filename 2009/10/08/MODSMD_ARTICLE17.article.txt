# THE 						ORIGINAL POLO
## 
### JULIA BROWNELL 
Imagine steering a moving horse toward a
tiny ball on the ground while the other
team's player steers his horse into yours.
Meanwhile, you are trying to hit that tiny
ball with a croquet-like mallet by leaning over
the right side of your horse. Sound hard? Wel
come to polo.
Stanford's polo club is a dedicated com
munity, putting two full weekend days and
multiple weekday nights in with the horses.
You won't see them playing on campus
their practices happen off campus at local
Webb Ranch.
"It requires a lot of time from the stu
dents," said senior Russell Field, the men's

captain and equipment manager.
In addition to practices, a handful of the
club members also compete against other
schools in matches during winter quarter. In
tercollegiate polo consists of three players on
horseback per team in a dirt arena. Each play
er tries to hit the ball with his or her mallet
into the other team's goal, located on either
end of the arena.
"Think of it as soccer on horseback with a
little hockey mixed in," said senior Katy
Peaslee, women's captain and horse manager.
The hockey influence is apparent when
the defense checks the offensive player on
horseback or tries to hook their mallet.

"People slam into each other," Peaslee
said. "You come back with plenty of bruises."
However, as reiterated by players, the
rules in collegiate polo are tailored to in
crease safety. In addition, Peaslee noted that
the team has had only one injury requiring a
trip to the hospital in the past eight years. The
players wear protective gear including hel
mets with face-masks and shin guards. The
horses also wear shin guards on their legs.
The sport is definitely athletic. The riders
cannot use their hands to ride, which requires
a lot of leg strength. Their balance also has to

Playing horse polo takes leg strength, arm strength, agility, balance and skill. The Stanford horse polo team has to take care of its horses in addition
to practicing and competing. The next Stanford horse polo competition takes place Jan. 24 against UC-Davis, where both men and women will play.
be strong to lean off the side of the
horse to hit a ball while moving.
"You have two sets of reins in one
hand and a mallet in the other,"
Rowe said. "Probably only 10 per
cent of the time are you looking
where you're going . . . It's a lot
more physical than one would think
... you ride with your legs and seat.
.. and there's a lot of body checking
each other."
The game is divided into four
"chukkers" or quarters, each lasting
seven and a half minutes. Play goes
on uninterrupted during that time,
and there is a break after each
chukker in addition to a halftime.
Both the men and women com
pete against other California schools
like UC-Davis, southern California
schools and a few Oregon schools.
Post teams come here to play Stan
ford in its home arena in Woodside.
The games are taken seriously and
the teams are competitive.
"Polo is more competitive and
hard-edged than a lot of other riding
disciplines," Rowe said.
"When in the arena, we definitely
take it seriously," Field said. "[Mem
bers of opposing teams] are good
friends off the field, but it's definite
ly a competition when you're play
ing."

The teams practice, work and
hang out as one, and in professional
polo, men and women play together.
The team just splits up for competi
tion. There is very little difference
between men's and women's style of
play.
"Guys generally play faster, gal
loping or fast cantor," Field said.
"[There is] a little bit more contact,
and guys can hit further."
However, when starting polo, the
women tend to come in with some
riding experience. Almost no one
comes in with any polo experience,
but the women have a technical ad
vantage.
Getting together all the gear,
horses and playing space seems to be
expensive for a Stanford club sport.
Polo is known as a gentrified sport
because of its high cost to play, and
the polo club at Stanford does its
best to cope with the costs. The club
dues are $225 per quarter, and much
of the money for the team comes
from private donors and Stanford
club sport funding.
"It's always a challenge to
fundraise enough to make sure the
club stays going," Field said.
However, Stanford polo is a rela
tively inexpensive way for the stu
dents to play.
"It's not that expensive," Field
said. "It's a great way to learn polo."
However, after college, many stu
dents have to give up the sport be
cause it's so expensive to play.

"Polo in the real world is all about

how much money you have ... In in
tercollegiate polo, we do the work,"
Rowe said.
The students take care of the
horses, do all of the barn and horse
upkeep and complete most of the
veterinary work themselves. This
saves the team the cost of profes
sional assistance. Stanford polo has
18 of its own horses, all of which have
been donated by local polo clubs.
Taking care of those horses is a huge
commitment, handled mostly by the
team's horse manager.
"A lot of other teams have a paid
barn manager," said graduate
Megan Rowe, former team captain
and horse manager. "Stanford is
pretty unique in that we do every
thing ourselves ... Everyone who
joins the club learns a lot about tak
ing care of horses."
All the members commented on
how much they learned about horses
and playing, and they love being so
involved. All the officers started with
no experience and learned the ropes
over time. Just with effort, they said,
anyone can get the hang of it.
Rowe recalls her decision to join
when, on the way to equestrian prac
tice her freshman year, she saw the
polo team playing an exhibition on
Roble Field. She stopped to look and
was hooked.
"Six horses thundering down the
field ... I decided that's what I want
ed to do. That same feeling of exhila
ration comes every time I play polo.
That's awesome," Rowe said.
The team practices every Satur
day and Sunday at Webb Ranch. The
men's and women's first game is Jan.
24 against UC-Davis.
