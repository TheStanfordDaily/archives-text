Imagine steering a moving horse toward a
tiny ball on the ground while the other
team's player steers his horse into yours.
Meanwhile, you are trying to hit that tiny
ball with a croquet-like mallet by leaning over
the right side of your horse. Sound hard? Wel
come to polo.
Stanford's polo club is a dedicated com

In addition to practices, a handful of the
club members also compete against other
schools in matches during winter quarter. In

said. "You come back with plenty of bruises."
However, as reiterated by players, the
rules in collegiate polo are tailored to in
crease safety. In addition, Peaslee noted that
the team has had only one injury requiring a
trip to the hospital in the past eight years. The
players wear protective gear including hel
mets with face-masks and shin guards. The
horses also wear shin guards on their legs.
The sport is definitely athletic. The riders
cannot use their hands to ride, which requires
a lot of leg strength. Their balance also has to
