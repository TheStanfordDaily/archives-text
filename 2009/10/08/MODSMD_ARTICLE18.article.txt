## Battle for NorPac supremacy No. 13 Card takes on conference foe Pacific 
### ALISSA HABER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's field hockey
team (10-2,2-1 NorPac) is looking to sepa
rate itself from the rest of the competition
this weekend.
After suffering only its second loss in
what has been one of the best seasons in
school history on Monday, the Cardinal
continues with league play this weekend,
taking on Pacific this weekend in Stockton.
Stanford currently shares the lead of
the West Division of the NorPac with Pa
cific. A win on Sunday would put the Car
dinal in sole possession of first place.
Stanford is coming off a recent three
game road trip in Pennsylvania, where it
had convincing wins over Temple and La
Salle on Friday and Saturday, respectively.
However, the team failed to clinch the road
sweep, dropping a close contest to Penn
State on Monday.
Stanford head coach Lesley Irvine ad
mits that the loss to Penn State was heart
breaking. Although the Cardinal lost 3-1, it
bested the Nittany Lions in shots on goal
14-13.
"The positive from that is the team
knows what they're capable of, and can
draw confidence from those experiences,"
Irvine said.
The Cardinal is still being recognized
for its stellar play. Despite the loss, Stan-
ford moved up one spot to No. 13 in
this week's Kookaburra/NFHCA
National Coaches Poll. The Cardinal

has now been in the top 25 for four
straight weeks.
The team is also still raking in in
dividual awards on what seems like a
weekly basis. This time it was senior
Midori Uehara and freshman Becky
Dru who earned the NorPac Offen
sive Player of the Week and Rookie
of the Week, respectively.

Uehara was especially potent of
fensively for the Cardinal during its
trip back East, as she scored five
goals on 11 attempts in the three
contests, including a hat trick against
Temple.
Dru, who has also become a
mainstay for the Stanford offense,
scored three goals in three games.

With this upcoming game against
the Pacific Tigers (3-6,2-1 NorPac),
the Cardinal now shifts its focus to
league play. With the NorPac tour
nament less than a month away,
Stanford, which has played every
team in the West Division once, is
looking to distance itself from its
conference foes to gain a favorable

seed in the tournament, which is
being held at Stanford on Nov. 5-7.
Irvine knows that the team's per
formance in conference is crucial.
"We are focused on performing well
within our league."
Although the Cardinal soundly
defeated the Tigers the last time they
met, Stanford must travel to Stock

ton, and, according to Irvine, this
presents a new challenge.
"This game will be different be
cause we play it on grass which
will effect our game plan and prepa
ration."
But what the Cardinal will enjoy
is a much slower pace when it comes
to time between games. After a hec
tic road trip where the team played
three games in four days, the Cardi
nal will now be playing only one
game a week, all conference match
ups, for the next three weeks.
Irvine admits that although Stan
ford is still preparing the same way,
the break doesn't hurt.
"We do our best to prepare and
focus on one game at a time, no mat
ter what the succession. Only having
one to think about per week makes
it a little easier for us to do this."
The Pacific Tigers are coming off
a crucial conference win over UC-
Davis last week to share the lead
of the West Division with the Cardi
nal. Although they have struggled
against the Cardinal, they boast
freshman goalkeeper Ashlee Schle
sier, who last week received her
third NorPac Rookie of the Week
honor. She is currently ranked sec
ond in the conference in total saves
with 76.
The Cardinal will take on Pacific
this Sunday at 2 p.m. at Brookside
Park in Stockton.
