# Not Just a Football Coach
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Following a college football
team is unlike any other phe
nomenon in the world of
sports. Loyalties are created
at birth, with family ties and tradi
tions laying the foundation for what
will eventually become decades of
happiness and heartbreak. We grow
up idolizing the players wearing col
ors that decorate our houses and
wardrobes. For brief periods of time,
we latch on to specific players as they
grow as students, players and men.
Flowever, as athletes come and go,
winning seasons turn into losing sea
sons and champions rise and fall, in
consistency often consumes the mind
of fans.

But some of us are lucky to be
graced with a blessing; a blessing
that restores balance to the gridiron
and to our lives. Once in a blue
moon, this force will become the oft
desired, but rarely attained, godlike
symbol of our beloved college foot
ball program.
Introducing, the immortal head
coach.
I was undeniably fortunate to be
bred a Penn State fan. As a team
that defines consistency, the Nittany
Lions are led by the greatest college
football coach in the history of the
NCAA Joe Paterno.
Paterno is now 83 years old. He
has racked up an inconceivable 387
regular season and 23 bowl wins
during his tenure. JoePa has been
with the Penn State coaching staff
for 60 years and has led the team for
the last 43.
These numbers are astonishing,
but represent a mere fraction of
what the man has given back to the
University. While fellow coaches are
now approaching the five million
dollars per year mark, Paterno con
tinues to live modestly in State Col
lege, Pa. He has donated an immeas
urable amount of time and money
to the school, including the Paterno
Library, a project for which he and
his wife helped raise nearly $13.5
million.
Paterno will never be fired. He
can't be. He is entitled to his mar
riage with the Penn State coaching
staff until death do they part. Even
after he surrenders the reigns, his
legacy will continue to live on. And
as cliche as it may seem, he may de
fine the metaphorical immortality
that we so often discuss.
The only other symbol of a pro
gram that dares to be muttered in
the same breath as Paterno is Flori
da State's Bobby Bowden. Just two
wins shy of Paterno's record pos
sibly more considering an academic
scandal Bowden has been one of
my least favorite figures in college
football. A constant threat to Pater
no's mark, I have spent over a
decade scrutinizing Bowden for his
lack of control over quite a raucous
group of student-athletes, his inabil
ity to speak articulately to the media
and his apparent regression as a re
cruiting force.

News broke earlier this week
that a member of Florida State's
board of trustees had asked Bow-

Once in a blue moon,
this force will become
the oft-desired, but
rarely attained,
godlike symbol of
our beloved college
football program.
