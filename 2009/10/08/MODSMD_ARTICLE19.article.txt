# Not Just a Football Coach
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Following a college football
team is unlike any other phe
nomenon in the world of
sports. Loyalties are created
at birth, with family ties and tradi
tions laying the foundation for what
will eventually become decades of
happiness and heartbreak. We grow
up idolizing the players wearing col
ors that decorate our houses and
wardrobes. For brief periods of time,
we latch on to specific players as they
grow as students, players and men.
Flowever, as athletes come and go,
winning seasons turn into losing sea
sons and champions rise and fall, in
consistency often consumes the mind
of fans.

But some of us are lucky to be
graced with a blessing; a blessing
that restores balance to the gridiron
and to our lives. Once in a blue
moon, this force will become the oft
desired, but rarely attained, godlike
symbol of our beloved college foot
ball program.
Introducing, the immortal head
coach.
I was undeniably fortunate to be
bred a Penn State fan. As a team
that defines consistency, the Nittany
Lions are led by the greatest college
football coach in the history of the
NCAA Joe Paterno.
Paterno is now 83 years old. He
has racked up an inconceivable 387
regular season and 23 bowl wins
during his tenure. JoePa has been
with the Penn State coaching staff
for 60 years and has led the team for
the last 43.
These numbers are astonishing,
but represent a mere fraction of
what the man has given back to the
University. While fellow coaches are
now approaching the five million
dollars per year mark, Paterno con
tinues to live modestly in State Col
lege, Pa. He has donated an immeas
urable amount of time and money
to the school, including the Paterno
Library, a project for which he and
his wife helped raise nearly $13.5
million.
Paterno will never be fired. He
can't be. He is entitled to his mar
riage with the Penn State coaching
staff until death do they part. Even
after he surrenders the reigns, his
legacy will continue to live on. And
as cliche as it may seem, he may de
fine the metaphorical immortality
that we so often discuss.
The only other symbol of a pro
gram that dares to be muttered in
the same breath as Paterno is Flori
da State's Bobby Bowden. Just two
wins shy of Paterno's record pos
sibly more considering an academic
scandal Bowden has been one of
my least favorite figures in college
football. A constant threat to Pater
no's mark, I have spent over a
decade scrutinizing Bowden for his
lack of control over quite a raucous
group of student-athletes, his inabil
ity to speak articulately to the media
and his apparent regression as a re
cruiting force.

News broke earlier this week
that a member of Florida State's
board of trustees had asked Bow-

Once in a blue moon,

godlike symbol of
our beloved college
football program.

den to resign at the end of the sea
son, due somewhat to his team's un
characteristic 2-3 start. Upon first
glance, I was thrilled by this story. If
all went according to plan, Paterno
would end on top, and in an era of
increased coaching volatility, his
record would most likely never be
touched.
However, as difficult as this is, I
find myself in a position that could
not have been predicted by Nos
tradamus himself I'm defending
Bobby Bowden.
It's incredibly easy to think only
about the present, and thus, exag
gerate a short-term of failure into a
lifelong disappointment. However,
I have a feeling that the board mem
ber made his comments without
fully grasping Bowden's value.
In the previous three seasons be
fore Bowden, Florida State won a
combined three games. An average
of one win per year can you fath
om a coach surviving one year at
FSU with those numbers, let alone
three?
Neither can I, but the only reason
we can separate Florida State from
Alcorn State is because of Bowden.
The man has won two national
championships and 12 Atlantic
Coast Conference titles. In fact, the
Seminoles won every single ACC
championship from 1992-2000.
It's understandable that Florida
State fans are upset. The team has

been in a minor state of decline for
the last seven or eight years. How
ever, to pin this on Bowden is sim
ply unfair. Honestly, one has to
wonder how big of a role he actual
ly has.
Remove him from the sideline,
and I think nothing changes. But re
move Bobby Bowden the name
synonymous with Florida State, the
man who rebuilt an abysmal college
football program and the man that
has created a standard that deems
an eight-win season forgettable
from the program? Good luck con
vincing recruits that Florida State is
the place to be.
We really can't comprehend the
importance of Bowden and Paterno
to their respective universities. Ask
ing for the dismissal of either one is
merely a selfish demand of an over
paid, ignorant, undedicated football
"fan." A member of the board of
trustees should be more qualified in
making decisions for the benefit of
the University.
Supporters of college sports need
to take Bobby Bowden's unfortu
nate situation as a learning experi
ence. The college football field ex
tends further than the goalposts it
transcends the entire institution and
the surrounding community. Exiling
a once-successful coach is one thing.
Shunning one of the school's most
influential contributors?
That is disgraceful.
