A Stanford scholar has settled her claims
against the James Joyce Estate for $240,000,
winning publishing rights for her biography and

Carol Shloss, a consulting English professor,
published her biography Lucia Joyce: To Dance
in the Wake in 2003. In it, she argues that Lucia
Joyce, often written off as the schizophrenic
daughter of Irish author James Joyce, was in fact

was stifled by her family. She also asserts that
Lucia was a muse to Joyce and central to the
creation of Joyce's famous Finnegans Wake.
However, her work met objections from the
James Joyce Estate. Joyce's grandson, Stephen
Joyce, threatened a lawsuit should Shloss quote
from anything that James or Lucia Joyce ever
wrote.
He also pressured her publisher, Farrar,
Straus and Giroux. Faced with these threats,
Shloss was forced to rewrite her book.
"It felt like a violation," Shloss said of the
editing process. "It was terrible."
She removed key pieces of evidence, the
result of years of painstaking work, knowing all
the while that what she deleted would damage
her credibility.
Considering withdrawing the book from
publication, Schloss said she asked herself:
"Would Lucia Joyce want her story to be told?"
In the end, she decided it would have to be
"her book or no book" and went ahead with
