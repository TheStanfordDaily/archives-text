## Shloss wins James Joyce settlement Stanford biographer settles $240,000 in attorney fees 
### CAROLINE CHEN 
A Stanford scholar has settled her claims
against the James Joyce Estate for $240,000,
winning publishing rights for her biography and
breaking through corporate copyright laws.
Carol Shloss, a consulting English professor,
published her biography Lucia Joyce: To Dance
in the Wake in 2003. In it, she argues that Lucia
Joyce, often written off as the schizophrenic
daughter of Irish author James Joyce, was in fact
an extraordinary dancer and artist whose talent
was stifled by her family. She also asserts that
Lucia was a muse to Joyce and central to the
creation of Joyce's famous Finnegans Wake.
However, her work met objections from the
James Joyce Estate. Joyce's grandson, Stephen
Joyce, threatened a lawsuit should Shloss quote
from anything that James or Lucia Joyce ever
wrote.
He also pressured her publisher, Farrar,
Straus and Giroux. Faced with these threats,
Shloss was forced to rewrite her book.
"It felt like a violation," Shloss said of the
editing process. "It was terrible."
She removed key pieces of evidence, the
result of years of painstaking work, knowing all
the while that what she deleted would damage
her credibility.
Considering withdrawing the book from
publication, Schloss said she asked herself:
"Would Lucia Joyce want her story to be told?"
In the end, she decided it would have to be
"her book or no book" and went ahead with

claims for attorney compensation after winning
publishing rights for her biography. Her settlement marked a legal landmark for authors.
publication.
As Shloss foresaw, Lucia Joyce
received mixed reviews when it was
published, many of which accused
her of having unsupported argu
ments.

The New Yorker called her
depiction of Lucia as the Joyce's
muse for Finnegans Wake a "spec
tacular act of inflation." The New
York Times ran a skeptical review
claiming that the book "read more
like an exercise in wish fulfillment
than a biography."
In response to these accusations,
Shloss created an electronic sup
plement in 2005 containing the
edited material, protected under
the U.S. "Fair Use" doctrine.
However, the electronic supple
ment was not made publicly avail
able, and the Joyce Estate contin
ued to threaten her with legal
action unless she kept the Web site

private.
In response, Shloss filed a suit
for declaratory relief in 2006, aided
by the Stanford Law School Center
for Internet and Society's "Fair Use
Project." Larry Lessig, then a
Stanford Law professor, served as
her attorney.
In 2007, Shloss won the right to
publish her supplemental material
online and in print. This year, the
saga was finally brought to a close
with a settlement of $240,000 to
cover attorney's fees and costs to
Shloss and her counsel.
This is not the first time that
Stephen Joyce and the Joyce Estate
have tried to block quotations of
James Joyce's writing and family
works from publication, citing fam
ily privacy.
According to The New York
Times, Stephen Joyce has admitted
to destroying some of Lucia's let
ters, and he has gone so far as to
prevent performers from reciting
parts of Finnegans Wake on stage,
Shloss said there were so many
people who had been prevented
from using Joyce's writings that

Lessig wanted to bring a class
action suit to court. However,
Shloss said, everyone they
approached was "so afraid of the
Joyce Estate" that she had to take
up the suit alone.
The victory is not only a vindica
tion for Shloss in her scholarship.
The settlement is also a landmark
for scholars who face similar legal
battles with copyright laws.
Hoping that the attention her
settlement has received will gener
ate more awareness about the chal
lenges faced by scholars, Shloss
also believes her story will encour
age other scholars to realize what
resources they have.
She hopes courts and lawmakers
will realize that corporate copy
right laws can have an unintended
and devastating effect on
scholars.
"I just wanted to write a book,"
Shloss said. "It was that simple. I was
bringing an old story up to date .. .
to pass on to the next generation."
