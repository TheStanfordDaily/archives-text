# FORCE IN THE MIDDLE
## "SHE'S A FORCE." 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO 
That's head coach John Dunning's de
scription of senior middle blocker
Janet Okogbaa. And indeed, this six
foot-three volleyball star commands
attention on the court.
Okogbaa, whose name is pronounced
"Okoba," has been in the rotation since her
freshmen year, when she appeared in 32
games and tallied 18 blocks. She ran into
some slight injury trouble in her sophomore
year, but she played in 28 games and regis
tered 26 kills. Though a reserve blocker, she
was one of the most successful on the team,
even with her arm in a cast.
"Most of my freshman and sophomore
seasons were spent coping with injuries,"
Okogbaa said. "During my sophomore sea
son I actually played with a cast on my right
hand, which slightly complicated matters but
added a bit of pizzazz to my everyday volley
ball attire."
Okogbaa's junior year marked a huge
transition for her, as she finally recovered
and appeared in all 118 sets. That year, she to
taled 108 blocks, finished fifth in the Pac-10
in hitting and was named to the Pac-10 All-
Academic Second Team.
"By my junior year, I was cast-free and
had the opportunity to learn a lot more
about the game," said Okogbaa.
In her final year on the Farm, she ranks
fourth in the Pac-10 in blocks, 28th national
ly and she is currently third on the team with
162.5 points. In her career she has made three
trips to the Final Four and is looking to make
another appearance as a senior. The Final
Four matches have marked among her most
memorable games at Stanford "for obvious
reasons," she says. She has played in the past
two championship matches, and looks to
contribute to another run in the playoffs.
"In my senior season, I hope to continue
to improve my game and help my teammates
accomplish their goals," said Okogbaa.
Even as she continues to perfect her ath
letic skills and strive toward bigger goals,
Okogbaa definitely enhances the team dy
namic with her individuality and spunk.
"She's hilarious and that helps our team.
We all have unique things about us, and hers
are great for our team," said Dunning of
Okogbaa's personality at practice.
Okogbaa's vibrant personality comes out
in everyday situations with the team as well.
From the dance parties in the locker room to
the games of Catch Phrase, she values the
amusing, quality time she spends with her

team. Her personality shined
through when asked about
switching positions.
"I think it's best for everyone
involved that I stick to middle
blocker. I'm pretty sure if I attempt
ed any other position, things would
get really ugly, really fast," Okogbaa
said. "To say the least, I'm fairly 'special
ized' in my position."

Her fellow players and the coaching
staff have no problems with her staying a
middle blocker.

"She's really stepping up in match
es. She's been set in big moments
and delivered. She's a person who
is doing a lot for this team," Dun
ning said. "I'm just happy for her
because she's really getting bet
ter, and it's the best she's ever
played."
From the court to the class
room, this senior proves that
hard work and determination
pay off. Okogbaa looks to one of
her favorite quotes by Thomas
Jefferson as motivation: "I'm a
great believer in luck, and I find
the harder I work the more I
have of it."
Coach Dunning points out
how Okogbaa's admirable qual
ities have paid off.
"She's had a lot of success
as a student, and her suc
cess as an athlete is
growing with each
week right now."
And while
we may be see
ing her name in
the future for her
feats in the Human Biology field,
for now, we can enjoy the athletic
talents that she brings to the Stan
ford community.
"Teams have to pay attention
to her," said Dunning. "She's real
ly delivering."
While an intimidating force on
the volleyball court, middle blocker
Janet Okogbaa has illustrated her
fortitude in all aspects of her Stanford
career.
