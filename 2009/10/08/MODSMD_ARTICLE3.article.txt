# Residence thefts nearly double
## Stanford burglaries near top of nationwide statistics, increasing 85 percent 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Escaping the sweaty crowds and pulsat
ing music downstairs, Andrew Chou 'll
headed to his room in Phi Kappa Psi for a
quick break. But as he pushed open his door,
he found that his laptop, his roommate's lap
top and various electronics were gone.
Someone at the party had just walked off
with over $4,000 worth of computer equip
ment.
Chou's experience last year has become
increasingly common here at Stanford, as
more and more students have been report
ing items stolen from on-campus housing.

The Numbers

Burglaries from Stanford residences have
nearly doubled in the last year. They
increased from 63 victims of incidents in
2007 to 117 in 2008, according to data
released last week by the Stanford
Department of Public Safety. The numbers
do not include bike thefts or burglaries out
side of dorms and houses.
"I think part of it is that we see when the
economy starts to decline, we often see an
increase in crime not just at Stanford but
across the United States," said Stanford
Police Chief Laura Wilson.
But the jump in statistics an increase of
85 percent has not yet been replicated at
other local or top tier institutions.
Harvard and Princeton have seen respec
tive increases of 31 percent and four percent
from 2007 to 2008, while Yale's burglary
numbers declined by more than half. UC-
Berkeley and San Jose State have also

reported declines in thefts from student resi
dences.

There were 62 separate burglaries in 2008
some with more than one victim, explain
ing the discrepancy between that number and
the 117 reported victims above. The areas
with the most reported thefts were:
Escondido Village (10), Sigma Alpha Epsilon
(6), Sterling Quad (5), Theta Delta Chi (4)
and Kappa Sig (4), according to Wilson.
All U.S. colleges and universities are
required to disclose statistics on crime on or
around their campuses, as mandated by the
Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security
Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (also
known as the Clery Act). Signed into law in
1990, the Clery Act requires colleges to pub
lish and distribute their annual security
reports by Oct. 1 of each year.
The U.S. Department of Education
defines the procedures and categorization of
crimes to keep nationwide reporting prac
tices equivalent.
Wilson attributed some of the increase in
2008 to organized crime not usually found at
Stanford.
Last year, a group affiliated with a gang
targeted Stanford, prying doors open to steal
students' belongings. On the day they were
apprehended, the suspects had stolen prop
erty from 14 separate victims.
For the most part, however, Wilson said
the majority of thefts involve people leaving
their doors unlocked for brief periods of
time. "Most of our crimes are crimes of
opportunity," she said. "It's natural, people
think, 'lt's my home I should be able to
run to the restroom and leave my room
unlocked."'

Thefts of Opportunity
On the Saturday night that Chou lost his
laptop, he says one of his roommates had left
the door unlocked. Although the room was
unoccupied for no more than a half hour,
with 500-600 people attending the party at
Phi Psi, Chou said the thief would have been
"impossible to track."
Ravi Parikh 'll suffered similar circum
stances. Parikh was using his iPod Touch to
supply music for a gathering in FroSoCo two
years ago. By the end of the night, it had dis
appeared. A friend's iPod was also taken.
"There were some non-Stanford students

at the party, according to some other people,
so I guess that's something suspicious,"
Parikh in an email to The Daily.
Student rooms are most vulnerable during
parties, said Wilson. "It's folks who come to
the party who are not Stanford students that
blend in and walk out with a wallet and a lap
top," she said. "It's pretty hard to control
because people tend to leave their doors
open."
The most common items reported missing
are laptops, wallets and GPS devices, accord-
