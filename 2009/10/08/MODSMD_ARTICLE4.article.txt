## PASU members relieve typhoon victims 
### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
With 400 dead in the Philippines after
Typhoon Ketsana last week, Stanford's
Pilipino American Student Union
(PASU) is continuing relief efforts for
victims of the disaster.
According to Aurora David 'l2, treas

urer of PASU and the main relief coordi
nator, the organization has raised approx
imately $1,500 in donations from stu
dents.
Indeed, in the relief effort, every dollar
makes a difference.
"One dollar will buy two shirts or two
meals," Co-Community Service Chair
Natalie Uy 'l2 said. "Our money makes a
huge impact because the U.S. dollar is

stronger than the Philippine peso."
On Monday, PASU sent ten boxes
filled with clothes, shoes, medical sup
plies, towels and blankets to the
Philippines. The organization plans to
continue sending boxes every two weeks
for as long as help is needed.

Pilipino American Student Union (PASU) members distributed boxes to campus residences to collect relief supplies and funding for victims of Typhoon Ketsana. The storm devastated the Philippines, killing 400 and displacing over one million people.
everything for free, otherwise it would
have been 60 bucks to ship a pack
age," Uy said. "We definitely want to
take advantage of the deal." Such air
line agreements allow for increased
shipments of relief supplies to victims
of Typhoon Ketsana. Some within the
community of Filipino students feel
that, so far, the typhoon has not
received widespread media coverage.
"At first I don't think a lot of stu
dents in the general community knew
about it," PASU Social Chair Allison
Bayani 'll said in an email to The
Daily. "A lot of people within the
Filipino community were comment
ing on the fact that the typhoon did
n't seem to get a lot of coverage from
mainstream media."
Uy agreed that understanding of
the typhoon's gravity is limited.
"People here don't really realize
how big it was. The closest thing I can
think of is Flurricane Katrina, and
Ondoy was bigger," Uy said. Ondoy is
the local name given to the typhoon.
"The Philippines is nowhere near
as wealthy as the U.S., and Manila is
way more densely populated," she
continued.
To counteract the relatively low
media coverage of the typhoon,

PASU has made announcements at
house meetings, emailed dozens of
lists and tabled in White Plaza.
"Once people became aware of
the situation, the response was over
whelming â€” the generosity of the
Stanford community really blows me
away," Bayani said. "It's incredibly
moving."
Currently, PASU is gearing up for
a charity concert called "Care
Package," which will take place at the
CoHo on Thursday night. The event
will feature local music artists and
boxes for students to drop off cash
donations for the Philippines Red
Cross.
Despite the distance, Typhoon
Ketsana has affected some students
profoundly, as many members of the
Stanford Filipino community have
family and friends living in flooded
areas.
"My grandparents are in Quezon
City, an area in metro Manila," Uy
said. "They live in two story house
the first floor is a mess right now. My
mom's yearbooks and photos are all
destroyed, and the electrical appli
ances are nonfunctional."
Uy is grateful that everyone in her
family survived despite the damage.
"My uncle owns a clothing store
and his entire warehouse was ruined,
plus [he] needed a boat to get to the
warehouse," Uy added. "A family
friend's house washed away."
Bayani had similar stories.

"My paternal grandmother lives
in Cainta, which is one of the hardest
hit areas in metro Manila, and we
couldn't contact her for a few days, so
we were pretty worried," she said.
"But we've heard from her since
and my other family members, and
they're all OK the main thing that
they stress now is the total devasta
tion of really large areas of metro
Manila."
Student emotions regarding the
typhoon, which hit on September 26,
have changed somewhat in the past
week.
"When the typhoon first hit, I was
really panicked, but now that the
immediacy of it has sort of abated,
we're dealing with the aftermath,"
Bayani said.
"That's something we can control
the relief effort is about rebuild
ing, as opposed to before, when we
were all running around trying to
assess the extent of damage," she con
tinued.
The concerns about rebuilding
continue, especially in the face of the
disease and water pollution that
accompany flooding. On Saturday,
Typhoon Parma hit the northeast part
of the main island Luzon, killing at
least 15 but mostly missing Manila.
Another storm is scheduled to hit
the Philippines soon, adding more
fear about the extent of destruction in
the area.
Because the relief and rebuilding

effort will likely be a long process,
PASU hopes to keep Stanford stu
dents aware of the needs of typhoon
victims through more charity events.
"We plan to have a larger concert
during winter quarter to remind peo

ple again about the suffering," Uy
said.
Despite uncertainties about how
long floodwaters will last and how
quickly the cities will recover, the
general sentiment of Filipino students

is clear.
"We're so grateful to everyone for
helping out," Bayani said.
