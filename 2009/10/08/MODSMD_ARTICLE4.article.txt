## PASU members relieve typhoon victims 
### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
With 400 dead in the Philippines after
Typhoon Ketsana last week, Stanford's
Pilipino American Student Union
(PASU) is continuing relief efforts for
victims of the disaster.
According to Aurora David 'l2, treas

urer of PASU and the main relief coordi
nator, the organization has raised approx
imately $1,500 in donations from stu
dents.
Indeed, in the relief effort, every dollar
makes a difference.
"One dollar will buy two shirts or two
meals," Co-Community Service Chair
Natalie Uy 'l2 said. "Our money makes a
huge impact because the U.S. dollar is

stronger than the Philippine peso."
On Monday, PASU sent ten boxes
filled with clothes, shoes, medical sup
plies, towels and blankets to the
Philippines. The organization plans to
continue sending boxes every two weeks
for as long as help is needed.
