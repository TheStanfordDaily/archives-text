## Stanford explores selling $1 billion in endowments 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Stanford University and Stanford
Management Company (SMC), which
manages the majority of the University's
endowment, are exploring a secondary
sale of up to $1 billion in illiquid invest
ments such as private equity, venture capi
tal, timber, oil-and-gas and real estate.
Presently, private equity-focused bou

tique investment bank Cogent Partners is
coordinating the potential sale. Bids from
interested funds are due at the end of the
month.

Rather than putting entire funds up for
potential sale, Stanford is only exploring
the sale of up to 10 to 20 percent of its
interests in illiquid assets across a number
of partnerships. This way, the University
will be able to raise cash while maintaining
majority stakes and exposure to the assets.

"We are exploring selling off $1 billion,
both funded and unfunded," said John
Powers, chief executive officer of SMC. "If
we get a price we like, it's away to raise the
liquidity of the merged pool, which we'd
like to do.
"But we really like the managers we
work with, and we don't want to lose con
nection with them," he added.
This past spring, Stanford issued $1 bil
lion in taxable debt in order to raise liquid

ity. Powers, however, insists that this poten
tial secondary sale doesn't indicate that
the University is strapped for cash.
"The University is in good shape with
respect to liquidity," Powers said. "We
made the decision to investigate [the sale],
not the decision to do it."

Since the financial collapse last year,
illiquid assets have been hit harder than
