### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
Citing a unique set of financial pressures,
Stanford has placed its undergraduate overseas
seminars three-week summer study abroad
experiences on hold for 2010.
The programming cut will not affect the flag
ship operations of the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP): All of Stanford's academic
year, quarter-length overseas programs, at loca
tions such as Oxford, Paris and Beijing, will
remain open. The new Madrid center will also
remain in place, and the debut of the overseas
program in Cape Town this winter will proceed
as scheduled.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) John Bravman said funding concerns
forced the decision, which will save BOSP
approximately $500,000: the cost of the seminars
