## Overseas seminars put on hold Financial pressures cut abroad program for summer 2010 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
Citing a unique set of financial pressures,
Stanford has placed its undergraduate overseas
seminars three-week summer study abroad
experiences on hold for 2010.
The programming cut will not affect the flag
ship operations of the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP): All of Stanford's academic
year, quarter-length overseas programs, at loca
tions such as Oxford, Paris and Beijing, will
remain open. The new Madrid center will also
remain in place, and the debut of the overseas
program in Cape Town this winter will proceed
as scheduled.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) John Bravman said funding concerns
forced the decision, which will save BOSP
approximately $500,000: the cost of the seminars
beyond each student's $5OO contri
bution.
Bravman said the overseas semi
nars made for a relatively practical
target for cutting. "We have every
intent of returning to them," said the
vice provost. "But it is one of a hand
ful of programs that, not from a stu
dent point of view, is possible to turn
on and off with relatively short lead
times, unlike, say, a quarter-length
program overseas."
Bravman expressed regret at the
potential problems the hiatus poses
for athletes and other students who
are unable to go overseas during the
year.
Three primary financial pres
sures came to bear on BOSP in the
lead-up to the decision. First,
University-wide budget cuts forced
reductions in the VPUE office,
which includes BOSP. Second, a cru
cial source of funding for BOSP

went "underwater," meaning its pay
outs are negligible.
"The biggest endowment in
[B]OSP is underwater, and so is not
paying out anything," Bravman said.
Last, and of the most specific
importance to BOSP, is a factor out
side of Stanford's control: the value
of the dollar, which has declined rel
ative to foreign currencies.
"With OSP, the last factor that
really distinguishes them, truly, is the
value of the dollar versus other cur
rencies," Bravman said. "Over the
last five years, in rough numbers,
that has degraded the cost structure
of OSP by $2 million a year."
Bravman described possible
swings of over $1 million in funding
between years due to the fluctuating
value, lending the programs a pre
carious financial unpredictability.
"We can have million-dollar swings
in cost completely beyond our con
trol on a program that is on the
order of $l2 million," Bravman said.
"So, we have eight, 10, 12 percent
swings possible completely beyond
our control.

"We are consuming our reserves
at an unsustainable rate in OSP," he
added.

Bravman cited continued unpre
dictability as the most significant
consideration in exercising caution.

"There's a not-irrational scenario
where things are quite good in a
year or two, and there's a not-irra
tional scenario where we are out of
money," he said. "And, especially
with that dollar swing added on, pru
dence requires that we build up
those reserves again to some eco
nomically sustainable point, so that
we can operate the program on a
break-even basis."
BOSP has also made reductions
to discretionary spending for direc
tors at overseas centers and office
expenses, and chose not to fill the
position of a departing staff mem
ber.

Bravman said the hiatus could
last beyond summer 2010, and he
encouraged students to apply to aca
demic-year programs if they seek a
study abroad experience: "If a fresh
man asked me, 'ls this program
going to be here before I graduate?'
I would say, 'I can't say no, but I
would not count on it."
