# SIREN TEST AT 12:05 P.M.
## WILL LAST 60 SECONDS 
### 
The Stanford community should expect the
AlertSU outdoor siren system to sound today at
12:05 p.m. Seven sirens across campus will go
off for 60 seconds as part of an emergency test
that will include a warning tone and then a verbal
message.

The new system's sirens have a sound radius
of a half-mile and are located on 50-foot poles
outside Escondido Village, the Lyman Graduate
Residences, Meyer Library, the Beckman Center,
Frenchman's Park, Stanford Avenue (facing Nixon
Elementary School) and Arboretum Road.
