## COOL-HEADED Undergraduates put safety aside to preserve self-image

his bike is holding a twenty pack of
donuts in one hand and, with the
other, steers into the Intersection of
Death sometimes deemed the
Circle of Life by those who have
obviously never biked around it.
Other bikers swirl around him, form
ing an awkward rush hour mass of
bikers.
Then, the inevitable happens. The
girl talking on her cell phone turns
the wrong way and crashes into the
donut boy, resulting in a snowstorm
of Krispy Kremes and a seamless slur
of picturesque epithets.
The girl with the cell phone man
ages to steady herself on her bike,
while donut boy skids and pushes his
hands out in time to avoid hitting his
head on the curb. It's the accident
that makes passersby think,
"Whoops, that was close,"
Everyone's wondering what
might have happened had donut boy
not managed to shield himself from
the curb. And as we shout, "You
OK?" and hungrily eye the glistening
doughnuts on the asphalt, we can't
help but wonder why none of us are

wearing helmets.
Stanford Bike Shop manager
Chris Wiscavage has a logical theory.
"Easy, the cool factor is low," he
said. "People only come running in
here for a helmet when blood and
internal organs are involved."
Ariadne Scott, Stanford's Bicycle
Program Coordinator, gave three
reasons why only 10 percent of
Stanford's undergraduate bikers
wear helmets peer pressure,
inconvenience and the possibility of
"bad hair" days.
The absence of bike helmets
seems ironic on a campus filled with
such brainy students. Bicycle helmets
reduce the risk of head injury by an
estimated 85 to 88 percent, an
appealing statistic in light of the risks.
"Brains don't heal," Wiscavage
said. "Once they're hurt, they're
done. There are no take-overs."
Michael Madderra 'll feels guilty
about not wearing a helmet.
"I know I should, but it's the norm
on Stanford campus not to wear
one," he said.
The unstated stigma attached to
bike helmets has already reached the
newly initiated freshmen. Sarah Tang
'l3 observed this trend.
"It's a crowd mentality kind of
thing," she said. "If everyone on this
campus were wearing a helmet, then
that would be one thing, but because

no one here wears a helmet, then
most freshmen assume it's either not
cool or just not necessary.
"Honestly, you feel kind of silly
biking through the main quad on a
sunny day with a big hunk of plastic
strapped to your head," she added.
Only the graduate community
seems to think differently. Madeline
Udell, a first year graduate student in
Computational and Mathematical
Engineering, noted that most gradu
ate students she knows wear helmets.
Students are not the only ones
making the decision to wear helmets.
Russell Fernald, a professor in the
Human Biology department, was
once hit by a helmet-less student rid
ing a brakeless bike, and now always
wears a helmet. He cited accident fig
ures from the United States.
According to the Bicycle Helmet
Safety Institute, bikers who don't
wear helmets are 14 times more like
ly to die in an accident.
But what can be done to raise
campus awareness? Ben Stetler 'll
was recently awarded a $lOOO prize
from Parking and Transportation
Services (P&TS) for wearing his hel
met while biking through White
Plaza.
"I was kind of shocked," he said.
"I don't see any reason not to wear
one. I just lock it to my bike. It takes
an extra five seconds."
However, rewards for helmet
users seem to mainly target those
who already wear helmets. What
about the other 90 percent of under
graduates?
To some, including Wiscavage,
only witnessing the aftermath of an
accident can permanently change
someone's mind.
"I know people who don't walk
and talk like normal people any
more" thanks to bike accidents sans
helmets, he said. He added that some
severe accidents did not even involve
fast speeds.
To increase campus awareness of
bike safety, Scott and the crew from
P&TS set up a Bike Safety Station in
White Plaza every Friday from 11
a.m. to 2 p.m. There, students can reg
ister their bikes, obtain bike safety
materials and enjoy free bike safety
checks. In addition, there are fre
quent bike safety classes attended
most regularly by those wishing to
avoid paying a citation fee and a
discount on bike helmets at the
Campus Bike Shop.
"We endorse wearing a bike hel
met," Scott said. "It's a no-brainer!"
Despite our best efforts to look
cool, perhaps wearing a helmet is a
no-brainer. Because not wearing a
helmet? Now that could be a real no
brainer.

Despite safety concerns, many undergraduates choose not to wear helmets out of fear that it looks "uncool." Parking and Transportation
Services has implemented programs and incentives to encourage students
to wear helmets while biking.
