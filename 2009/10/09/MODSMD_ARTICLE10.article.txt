## Degrees conferred reveal no new trends 2008-09 figures remain largely unchanged from, 2007-08 
### RYAN MAYFIELD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When it comes to picking a major,
Stanford undergraduates' preferences are
staying largely consistent.
The University released numbers regard
ing the degrees conferred for the 2008-09
academic year, which were almost identical
to the 2007-08 figures. The data was grouped
into broad categories, more varied than the
three Stanford schools that grant degrees to
undergraduates Humanities & Sciences,
Engineering and Earth Sciences.
Most undergraduate degrees from last
year fell into the Interdisciplinary category
at 30 percent. This was a three percent
increase from the 2007-08 academic year.
Social sciences dropped slightly to 23 per
cent, down from 25 percent one year ago.
Third in popularity was engineering, with 21
percent of all undergraduates receiving
degrees in this field. This number was just

slightly higher than last year, in which 20
percent of all undergraduates received engi
neering degrees.
At the opposite end of the spectrum,
earth sciences, language and literature, and
the humanities remained the bottom three
in degrees conferred, with two percent, five
percent and seven percent, respectively.
While some may have been anticipating
a change in academic focuses of the under
graduate population because of the current
financial crisis and budget cuts, there was
little shift noted. Humanities & Sciences
Dean Richard Sailer explained the reasons
why no major shifts in degrees conferred
were observed.
"Presumably, most students were com
mitted to a major by the beginning of their
senior year and didn't make a last quarter
change to adjust to the economy," Sailer
said. "A more interesting number might be
any increase in co-terms this year on
account of the lack of jobs."
Unfortunately, data on co-terms was not
available at this time.

Graduate Students

Graduate student figures for degrees
awarded have also remained similar to the

previous years, with the only substantial
change coming in the School of
Humanities. In this case, the number of
degrees was halved from four to two per
cent.
The highest number of graduate degrees
awarded was in the School of Engineering,
with 41 percent. This number was mirrored
exactly by last year's graduating class. The
second most popular graduate degree was
from the Graduate School of Business, with
sixteen percent.
The School of Law and School of
Education came in with eight percent and
seven percent, respectively.
Continuing Studies made up just one
percent of all graduate degrees conferred
this year, up slightly from less than half a
percent last year. Still, even with a very sim
ilar trend line between almost every
degree, it is difficult to draw long-term data
from the correspondence.
"I think it is risky to draw conclusions
from year to year fluctuations," Sailer said.
"I would place more weight on 10-year
trends."
