## EDITORIAL Loss of Seminars a necessary sacrifice 
### 
The Bing Overseas Studies Program re
cently announced that Overseas Semi
nars approximately three week-long
courses abroad in the final weeks of the sum
mer would be suspended this year due to
budget concerns. While the suspension is cer
tainly lamentable, the Editorial Board feels
that the temporary cut of Overseas Seminars
is worthy, if it can prevent further budgets
cuts from affecting quarter-length BOSP pro
grams.
The announced suspension of Overseas
Seminars may bring with it all the classic ac
coutrements of student outrage: conversa
tions of protest during morning meals, point
ed allusions to the importance of travel and
perhaps even a few angry undergraduate let
ters to BOSP. At the heart of these communi
ty dialogues is the notion that Stanford stu
dents are hardworking and deserving of op
portunities to extend their college experi
ences beyond the campus and beyond the
United States a notion that is not without
merit.
Indeed, the loss of Overseas Seminars will
likely be the loss of a beloved addition to the
educational programs of talented undergrad
uates whose academic and extra-curricular
schedules are so rigorous and packed, that
they cannot afford a quarter-long stay
abroad. Yet the strong reactions to the Semi
nars' suspension may partly arise from a real
ity we should all be grateful for the fact
that over half of all students are able to study
abroad in their time at Stanford, a reflection
of the unique and perhaps underappreciated
"traveler" culture on campus that will still

exist during the Overseas Seminars' hiatus.
Unlike many of our educational counterparts
who do not even offer their own travel pro
grams, Stanford has, for over 51 years, com
mitted itself to funding a University-run pro
gram that makes overseas travel for students
extraordinarily feasible.
The ability to study abroad is a luxury that
Stanford students are able to utilize in large
numbers, but the state of the University amid
the budget crisis demands that some cuts be
made in various departments. If cutting the
Overseas Seminars allows BOSP to maintain
the quality of the quarter-length programs
through the coming year, then it is a worthy
sacrifice, provided that Overseas Seminars
are considered for reinstatement in future
years when the endowment improves.
A great many students who opt to take
Overseas Seminars do so because, whether
for financial reasons or because they do not
have the time in their schedules, they are un
able to commit to a full quarter abroad. But
the Overseas Seminars are by no means the
only resource available for those hoping to go
abroad for a brief stay. For those interested in
shorter travel periods that still have an educa
tional component, one of the most accessible
on-campus resources is the Haas Center for
Public Service, which offers two- to four
week programs like Impact Abroad. There
are also numerous grants available through
various departments to fund research and art
projects abroad, even during the summer
quarter. So, even with the Overseas Seminars
gone for the time being, students should not
give up hope on being able to go abroad.
