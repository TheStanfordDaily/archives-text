# THE 						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## The 						problem with campus conservatives 
### Shelley Gao 
After the passing of William Buckley last
February, it would make sense to ex
pect campus conservatives to be in
deep mourning. What a timely opportunity to
reflect on Buckley's denunciation of liberal
hegemony in academia in his 1951 "God and
Man at Yale," and how the "superstition of ac
ademic freedom" still reigns today? Nope, did
not happen. Guess there is not much hope of
collective grieving over the loss of Irving Kris
tol anytime soon.
Undoubtedly, being a conservative at Stan
ford is an isolating experience, and a sense of
esprit de corps can be gained from practicing
politics of opposition. The relentless Obama
bashing by the right on campus, however, is
both annoying and often lacking in substance.
It becomes problematic when attacks on
liberalism are based on sound bites rather than
on awareness of the underlying intellectual
and philosophical principles. Although debate
about political factors is important, discourse
must include more of the dynamics and inter
nal nature of the movement. I would faint in
shock if I ever heard the description of conser
vatism as a "disposition" that prefers "the fa
miliar to the unknown... tried to the untried .
.. present laughter to Utopian bliss" uttered by
a Stanford right-winger.
It is questionable whether the Stanford
conservative (oops! "Republican") communi
ty is truly welcoming. Antagonism is displayed
toward individuals who refuse to fervently
commit to GOP lines, and those who find such
labels simplistic are often dismissed. Appar
ently, the right on campus did not get the
memo that Edmund Burke distrusted all ide
ologies. Ironically, a fundamental concept un
derlying conservatism is an appreciation of the
complexity of the world and the virtue of mod
eration.
So, how did Stanford conservatives get to
this point? The system deserves some of the
blame. The University fails to consider ideo
logical diversity (i.e. political worldview) in
faculty recruitment. Has there ever been a re
port examining the pipeline challenge to at
tracting conservatives to enter academia?
Race does not always guarantee a different
perspective. Let's face it who is going to
challenge that in our politically correct Stan
ford bubble? In an era when a vocal minority
(of any particular stripe or creed) distorts ma
jority agenda, University administrators are
frightened to generate controversy, frequently
leaving difficult and challenging matters ad
dressed only superficially, if at all. (On this sub
ject: To those who find it hard to believe that
ASSU candidates with stuffed cows may also
possess original thought, take a look beyond
the superficial!)
Moving on, conservative leaders on cam
pus, some of whom are my dear friends, have
simply been irresponsible. They have essen
tially neglected to provide their followers with
a good education. The Stanford Review, self

characterized as the "strongest bastion of the
center-right," believes its lifeline lies in focus
ing on campus issues. It needs to step up. Ideal
ly, the publication would introduce us to key
thinkers, important literature and the histori
cal evolution of the movement in America.
There should be more events modeled after
the Hoover lunches, where major practitioners
and intellectuals are invited to discuss the past
and the future of conservatism in a social and
educational atmosphere.
Campus dynamics is reflected in the broad
er political discourse. The balance between in
tellectual elites and grassroots activists, evi
dent in the heyday of the conservative move
ment, has been toppled. Populists have taken
over. We have traded Friedrich Hayek and
Whittaker Chambers for Rush Limbaugh and
tea parties.
The American conservative movement and
the campus right share parallels both in the
state of their respective crises, and the pro
scription for moving forward. On a national
arena, it is imperative to unite the divergent
strands of conservatism. It involves a return to
fusionism, championed by Frank Meyer and
National Review in the postwar era. A poten
tial showdown between neocons and paleo
cons, the evangelicals and libertarians is enter
taining, albeit not pretty.
On a more immediate level, the challenge at
Stanford lies in building a conservative coali
tion that is inclusive of differences and nuances.
There is great variety within the campus right.
Many are classical liberals or libertarians, en
dorsing free market attitudes with progressive
social views. Others are traditionalists with an
emphasis toward re-establishing ethical and re
ligious norms in an age of relativism. Attention
should also be paid to other less-defined cate
gories. There are philosophical conservatives
with politically moderate positions, closeted
conservatives finding it difficult to openly share
their beliefs on a liberal campus, and individu
als who are still exploring and developing their
conception of the world. To become a stronger
and united force, the campus right must em
brace a wider definition of conservatism.
Many campus conservatives refute the no
tion that ideological compromise is needed.
We must, however, learn from the failure of the
Goldwater presidential campaign. His extrem
ism, while perhaps admirable, was ultimately
impractical. For the American conservative
movement to regain power, it must adapt to
changing values of society. Similarly, the future
of the Stanford right in implementing its agen
da, be it influencing campus thought, shaping
ASSU elections or merely being taken seri
ously, requires willingness to undertake critical
self-examination.

While some of Shelley's favorite people in the
world belonged to 'O9, thank God they are gone!
