# WAXWORKS AND ROUSTABOUTS
## "The club man's gambit," by P.G. Mann 
### P.G. Mann 
Beauty is the beginning of terror. That's
what my Uncle Randy used to say. It
always stood out among his other say
ings, like, "Quick, 'fore the government catch
es you," a holdover from his bootlegging
days, and "Dammit, Gladys, you're one mean
old cow," a phrase of conjugal endearment.
Only later did I find out he had learned it in a
book of words by a deadbeat German with a
sissy name: Rainy Mary Some-in-er-nother.
If only Uncle Randy had been there to
offer those wise words last Monday. Then I
would have known that the beautiful gift in
my mailbox was not to be trusted. Instead,
when I saw that card emblazoned with my
name, I shrieked with joy, "I've been admit
ted to the club!" Thanks to my remarkable
display of character, wealth and sartorial
taste, i had become a card-carrying member
of the West Coast's most prestigious organi
zation: Safeway.
I don't even remember how I got to the
store, I was so ecstatic. I vaguely remember
driving, but I am certain I do not own a car,
especially one with a baby in the back.
The doors to Safeway opened before me,
no doubt sensing the club-member
pheromones I was emitting. Inside, the fruit
looked riper, the Cheez-Its cheezier, even the
pock-marked baker had a charming Gallic
air about him. Every Muzak tune on the
loudspeaker was my favorite song.
As I danced my way through the aisles, it
became clear there were two kinds of people
in this world: club members and non-mem
bers. You could smell a non-member from
the other end of the store. They slouched,
were usually deformed, had a mucous-like
film covering their hands and were improba
bly flatulent. The more respectful ones
bowed and groveled when a member passed
by. The others just growled and stared at their
betters with desperate eyes.
At least these clubless hordes were forced
to pay a higher price for the foodstuffs they
clawed off the shelves. But, really, I began to
wonder whether having to suffer their pres
ence were a violation of my member privi
leges. What right did they have to nourish
themselves on my groceries in my club?!
These questions sent me marching in in
dignation to the meat department. I couldn't

let the riffraff feast on the precious flesh of
animals, particularly not the meat that had
been collected caringly from the feces-ridden
floor and put mindfully through a rusty
grinder for me and other club members to
enjoy at 88 cents a pound. I grabbed all the
ground beef I could fit in my cart and made
for checkout.

I'll spare you an account of the emotion I
felt when they swiped my club card. Let's just
say the $6.57 I saved on groceries was only
half as valuable as my sense of belonging.
Back at home, I slipped into my Members
Only tracksuit, put on some thumpin' club
music and whipped up some club sandwich
es, along with 16 pounds of rare hamburger

meat and a sleeve of club crackers.
An hour later, the trouble started. I felt a
rumbling in my gut, followed by swelling in
my ears. I tried to cure it with club soda and
lime, stirred with my Safeway club card.Then
I blew a gasket.
The E. coli sent my sphincter and all 16
pounds of rancid hamburger through the
back of my track suit. The bacteria attacked
my softening brain, sending me to seizure
country.
I came to in the hospital parking lot, para
lyzed from the teeth down. The hospital had
refused to treat me because, apparently, I did
n't have what they referred to as "health in
surance," They must not have seen my club
card, which, at the time, was in my mouth to
prevent me from swallowing my tongue.
Now, drooling on my benumbed body
crumpled on the asphalt, I felt like a non
member.
Suddenly, a mustachioed man wearing a
skull cap, stropping belt and a straight razor
appeared from behind the hazardous waste
bin, hoisted me up from my wretchedness,
and brought me to a door marked by a mov
ing candy cane pole.
Inside was a bustling scene of combs and
cauterized flesh, the floors wet with blood
and barbicide.
"Where am I?" I asked.
"Welcome, poor man, to the barber-sur
geon local No. 37," said my barber savior.
"We are an ancient guild. Once the beacons
of modern medicine, we were forced under
ground by doctors. Now we ply our trade in
secret, treating those infirm or in need of a
trim. We are the shadow public option,
healthcare for the clubless."
Just as I was about to protest and show
him my club card, he kicked my inert body
into a spinning chair and lathered up my side
burns.
"Don't you worry, young fellah. Let me
give you a good bloodletting whilst you
browse the nudie magazines."
And there, as the lifeblood drained out of
me while I stared into the swirling centers of
two areolae, I again felt like a club man.
