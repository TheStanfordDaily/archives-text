## BRING ON THE BEAVERS Men's soccer hosts OSU and UW 
### TOM TAYLOR 
The Stanford men's soccer team (6-2-0,0-
1-0 Pac-10) hosts Oregon State (5-3-2,1-1-0
Pac-10) at home tonight, getting a chance to
tip the Beavers' record. Stanford will then
take on Washington (3-4-3, 0-0-2 Pac-10) on
Sunday to finish off a crucial weekend for the
Cardinal.
After losing the Pac-10 opener to Cal a
week ago, this weekend presents the Cardinal
with a great opportunity to get its season back
on track with two wins.
The defeat to the Golden Bears has had
"no effect," according to head coach Bret
Simon. But Simon does concede that "the
guys feel that they had a chance to win," and
that some players may have been frustrated
by the failed opportunity to beat one of the fa
vorites in the Pac-10 conference.
Last weekend, both northern teams, Ore
gon State and Washington, travelled down the
coast to play their southern counterparts,
UCLA and San Diego State. The Beavers
managed a win and a loss, while the Huskies
recorded two draws. Now the teams set foot in
the Bay Area to face both Stanford and Cal.
Oregon State definitely appears to be in
better form, and with their strong forward
Danny Mwanga, who has already chalked up
seven goals this season, this match-up should
be a more exciting game than last year's statis
tics would suggest (two draws, 0-0 and 1-1)
"I suspect they will be very fast, very phys
ical, very challenging," Simon said of the op
posing teams.
Simon expects the Beavers to apply pres
sure all over the field, but he hopes that his
team will take advantage of the difficult situa
tion.
"We get counterattacking chances," he
said.
If Stanford can push through the Beavers,
the Card should have a great chance, as their
14 goals already this year prove that they
know how to convert.
Washington has a losing record thus far,
but they held favorites UCLA to a draw on
the road, demonstrating that their challenge
should not be dismissed. Most of the Huskies'
games have been tight this year, with the dif
ference between winning and losing just a sin-

gle goal. In fact, they come into this game hav
ing scored exactly the same number of goals
that they have conceded.
"[Washington] has had an incredible year,
looking at the results," Simon said, although
certainly wary of their two speedy forwards,
describing them as "very quick, very danger
ous, buzzing type players."
Last year, the Washington game was prob
ably one of the highlights of the season for the
Cardinal. In a year of countless 1-0 losses, in
cluding during the away leg, it racked up a 4-2
win that handed the conference title to
UCLA.
Stanford goes into this weekend unbeaten
at home in 2009. The team has scored a total of
nine goals against four at Cagan stadium and
won three trophy-winning matches, proving
that they are a force to be reckoned with on
home turf.
Discounting last Friday's result, the players
still sound upbeat about their prospects for
this year. According to sophomore midfielder
Taylor Amman, the team's aim is "to win the
Pac-10." That statement certainly doesn't
leave anything in doubt.
However, the Cardinal is careful not to
sound or act overconfident, and Simon warns
that "as usual, all of the Pac-10 teams are very
strong." Stanford needs two wins from this
weekend, but the team refuses to look past the

game today.
"One game at a time," cautioned junior
midfielder Tiago Sa Freire.
Though it opened barely a week ago, by 4
p.m. on Sunday, the teams will be roughly one

third of the way though the Pac-10 confer
ence. Only four weekends of action will be left,
and although the season is far from over, the
shape of the table will already be separating
the contenders from the also-rans.

Whether or not the coaches and players
admit it, the pressure is on.
