# Entering the Conference
## Women's soccer looks to continue perfect season opener 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
After completing a perfect non-confer
ence season last week, the No. 1 Stanford
women's soccer team now opens up confer
ence play as it heads north to face Oregon
and Oregon State this weekend.
The Cardinal (11-0-0, tied for the best
ever start in school history) is now the unan
imously top-ranked team in the nation after
North Carolina's loss to Virginia Tech last
weekend. Even so, while the players are
proud of the accomplishment, they realize
that it's just a ranking.
"I think we can still improve and we still
have a lot to prove to the rest of the country,"
said senior fullback Ali Riley. "The number
one ranking just means that everyone is gun
ning for us."
Some observers also argue that Stan
ford's non-conference schedule was not very
challenging never mind that the Card
beat multiple ranked teams, including a 5-0
drubbing of Virginia Tech and that the
team needs to win more big games to justify
its position as unanimous No. 1. If that is the
case, the Pac-10 season will certainly provide
opportunities for Stanford to prove itself.
The conference looks strong from top to
bottom this year. Although conference play
hasn't started yet, it's worth noting that No.
21 Cal and No. 23 USC are ranked ninth and
seventh in the Pac-10 right now, respectively.
And, of course, it's impossible to mention
Pac-10 soccer without mentioning No. 3
UCLA the Bruins have won the last six
conference titles.
If Stanford wants to win its first title since
2002, it will have to get past UCLA, but the
team will need to take care of business
against the other teams as well. That chal
lenge begins in Corvallis tonight, as the Card
takes its first trip outside the Bay Area since
participating in the UNC Greensboro Tour
nament over a month ago.
"Even though it's our first trip outside the
Bay Area in over a month, nothing really

changes," said senior midfielder Kristin
Stannard. "We still know what we have to do
this weekend and are mentally preparing the
same way we have been the past couple
weeks. It's the start of Pac-10 play, so I think
we are even more pumped up because this
year our goal is to finally win it."
Oregon State's record currently stands at
8-2-1, but while looking over their many
wins, it may be the Beavers' loss that says
most about their abilities. Just two weeks
ago, they played No. 4 Portland, a serious na
tional title contender, to a narrowl-0 defeat
in Portland.
The Beavers certainly appear to be a dif
ferent team from the one Stanford beat 3-0
last year. While the 2008 squad went a dismal
1-7-1 in conference, the 2009 OSU team has
already recorded two more wins than it did
the entirety of last season.
Oregon, whom the Cardinal will face Sun
day afternoon, looks to be in a similar posi
tion to their in-state rivals. Last season, the
Ducks only won two Pac-10 games and just
nine matches overall; and like Oregon State,
Stanford also beat Oregon 3-0 in 2008. Yet
Oregon too has had a strong start to the 2009
campaign, also posting an 8-2-1 and even
climbing into the top 25 in some polls.

Clearly, facing two up-and-coming teams
on the road is not an easy way to open the
Pac-10 season. But then again, no match is
easy in conference play. After narrowly miss
ing out to UCLA the past few years, the Card
knows how much work and effort lies ahead
of them in the team's quest for the Pac-10
championship.
"The entire conference is very competi

tive," said Riley. "We will take it game by
game.
"Winning the Pac-10 is definitely a major
goal for us this year," she added. "Our suc
cessful non-conference season is great, but
now is when the real competition begins."
