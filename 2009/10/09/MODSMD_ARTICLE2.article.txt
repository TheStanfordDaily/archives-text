## WHIRLWIND WASHINGTON WEEKEND Card at home vs. Huskies, WSU 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's volleyball
hosts the only two teams with better con
ference records in the Pac-10, No. 25
Washington State (14-1, 3-1 Pac-10) and
No. 3 Washington (14-0,4-0 Pac-10), in its
conference home opener tonight and Sat
urday night, respectively, in Maples Pavil
ion.
"I think, because we are coming off of
two great wins on the road, we are very
anxious to not only play again this week
end, but also play in front of our home
crowd," said junior libero Gabi Ailes.
"This past weekend was definitely a tip
ping point in our season, building much
needed confidence for the rest of the sea
son. Everyone is ready to battle this week
end."
Stanford heads into the weekend with
road wins under its belt against No. 16
UCLA and No. 13 USC, with scores of 3-1
and 3-0, respectively. Junior Alix Kline
man's performance last week earned her
the Imports/AVCA National Player of the
Week award. Over the weekend, she col
lected 47 kills, 21 digs and six solo blocks.
Ailes also hit a season-high 30 digs against
USC, and junior Cassidy Lichtman record
ed her fourth triple-double this past week
end as well.
"Experience matters. This weekend, we
had some key young players and the more
experienced players had some great expe
riences that are going to help us grow,"
said head coach John Dunning. "Some
times you have to pay for these experi
ences, but this time we didn't because we
played well in a lot of ways we needed to
and won."
UCLA and USC's volleyball programs
have remained solid over the years. With
huge fan bases, playing these two teams on

their turf is always a challenge. And com
ing out on top, especially with a sweep
against the Trojans, always marks a pivotal
turn in the season.

The wins placed the Card at No. 3 in the
Pac-10, with a 2-1 conference record and 9-
4 overall. The Washington schools, howev-

NOTES: Stanford, No. 3in the Pac-10, hosts Pac-10
No. 1 and No. 2 this weekend in their conference
home opener. Last weekend, the Cardinal defeated
both UCLA and USC on the road, displaying a com
plete recovery after their 3-2 loss to Cal the previous
weekend. Washington State suffered its only loss of the
season to Oregon, and also comes off a double victo
ry against Arizona and Arizona State last weekend.

With only one Pac-10 loss against Oregon,
Washington State boasts a near-perfect record,
as well as a pair of wins this past weekend
against Arizona and Arizona State. Sophomore
Meagan Ganzer led the Cougars with 32 com
bined kills against Arizona State and Arizona,
while freshman Oceana Bush made the WSU
record books with 39 digs against Arizona State
and 16 against Arizona.
Hitting the Cougars harder and throwing
them off-guard will be necessary in Stanford's
face-off against Washington State.
"We have to push their ball control. We have
to challenge them and be aggressive," Dunning
said. "We're going to serve tough, attack ag
gressively and try to take them out of the speed
of their game."
The only Pac-10 team to maintain a perfect
record, No. 3 Washington swept Arizona State
3-0 and Arizona 3-0 last weekend. The Huskies
have experienced a strong season and set a new
school record with 42 straight set wins. Junior
Kindra Carlson hit 13 at the net, junior Jenna
Hagglund recorded her first double-double
and senior Tamari Miyashiro had a match-high
20 digs against the Sun Devils.
Against the Wildcats, Carlson reached a sea
son-high of 16 kills while teammates Jill Colly
more and Airial Salvo hit 14 and 10 kills, re
spectively.
"Against Washington, you have to execute
what you do well," Dunning said. "When it gets
into rally mode, you have to make good choic
es. They just make you play well, and if you
don't, you're not in the game with them."
For a team like Washington, mistakes are
rare, decision-making is key and execution is
expected.
"Washington is always a tough team," said
senior setter Joanna Evans. "They are current
ly ranked No. 1 in the Pac-10, but I think we can
take them down if we play consistently and
take over early in the match."
This weekend will prove just how good the
Card is. Every weekend in the Pac-10 is a chal
lenge, but facing off against two solid teams will
definitely force Stanford to rise to the occasion.
"One of the key things about what 's happen
ing with our team is that everyone is helping
coaches and everyone . . . including our trainer
Eitan Gelber," Dunning said.
Playing together, playing early and playing
big will help the Card this weekend.
First serves are set for 7 p.m. at Maples

Stanford women's volleyball plays Washington State and Washington in
their conference home opener this weekend. The Cardinal comes off a
double road victory last weekend against No. 16 UCLA and No. 13 USC.


er, remain on the top of the Pac-10.
With only one Pac-10 loss against Oregon,
Washington State boasts a near-perfect record,
as well as a pair of wins this past weekend
against Arizona and Arizona State. Sophomore
Meagan Ganzer led the Cougars with 32 com
bined kills against Arizona State and Arizona,
while freshman Oceana Bush made the WSU
record books with 39 digs against Arizona State
and 16 against Arizona.
Hitting the Cougars harder and throwing
them off-guard will be necessary in Stanford's
face-off against Washington State.
"We have to push their ball control. We have
to challenge them and be aggressive," Dunning
said. "We're going to serve tough, attack ag
gressively and try to take them out of the speed
of their game."
The only Pac-10 team to maintain a perfect
record, No. 3 Washington swept Arizona State
3-0 and Arizona 3-0 last weekend. The Huskies
have experienced a strong season and set a new
school record with 42 straight set wins. Junior
Kindra Carlson hit 13 at the net, junior Jenna
Hagglund recorded her first double-double
and senior Tamari Miyashiro had a match-high
20 digs against the Sun Devils.
Against the Wildcats, Carlson reached a sea
son-high of 16 kills while teammates Jill Colly
more and Airial Salvo hit 14 and 10 kills, re
spectively.
"Against Washington, you have to execute
what you do well," Dunning said. "When it gets
into rally mode, you have to make good choic
es. They just make you play well, and if you
don't, you're not in the game with them."
For a team like Washington, mistakes are
rare, decision-making is key and execution is
expected.
"Washington is always a tough team," said
senior setter Joanna Evans. "They are current
ly ranked No. 1 in the Pac-10, but I think we can
take them down if we play consistently and
take over early in the match."
This weekend will prove just how good the
Card is. Every weekend in the Pac-10 is a chal
lenge, but facing off against two solid teams will
definitely force Stanford to rise to the occasion.
"One of the key things about what 's happen
ing with our team is that everyone is helping
coaches and everyone . . . including our trainer
Eitan Gelber," Dunning said.
Playing together, playing early and playing
big will help the Card this weekend.
First serves are set for 7 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion tonight and tomorrow night.
