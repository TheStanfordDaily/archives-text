## WHIRLWIND WASHINGTON WEEKEND Card at home vs. Huskies, WSU 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's volleyball
hosts the only two teams with better con
ference records in the Pac-10, No. 25
Washington State (14-1, 3-1 Pac-10) and
No. 3 Washington (14-0,4-0 Pac-10), in its
conference home opener tonight and Sat
urday night, respectively, in Maples Pavil
ion.
"I think, because we are coming off of
two great wins on the road, we are very
anxious to not only play again this week
end, but also play in front of our home
crowd," said junior libero Gabi Ailes.
"This past weekend was definitely a tip
ping point in our season, building much
needed confidence for the rest of the sea
son. Everyone is ready to battle this week
end."
Stanford heads into the weekend with
road wins under its belt against No. 16
UCLA and No. 13 USC, with scores of 3-1
and 3-0, respectively. Junior Alix Kline
man's performance last week earned her
the Imports/AVCA National Player of the
Week award. Over the weekend, she col
lected 47 kills, 21 digs and six solo blocks.
Ailes also hit a season-high 30 digs against
USC, and junior Cassidy Lichtman record
ed her fourth triple-double this past week
end as well.
"Experience matters. This weekend, we
had some key young players and the more
experienced players had some great expe
riences that are going to help us grow,"
said head coach John Dunning. "Some
times you have to pay for these experi
ences, but this time we didn't because we
played well in a lot of ways we needed to
and won."
UCLA and USC's volleyball programs
have remained solid over the years. With
huge fan bases, playing these two teams on

their turf is always a challenge. And com
ing out on top, especially with a sweep
against the Trojans, always marks a pivotal
turn in the season.

The wins placed the Card at No. 3 in the
Pac-10, with a 2-1 conference record and 9-
4 overall. The Washington schools, howev-
