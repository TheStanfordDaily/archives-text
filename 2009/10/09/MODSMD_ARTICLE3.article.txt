# Football travels to Oregon State as Pac-10 champions

### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It has been a while since a sentence like this has been
written: Stanford looks to defend its first-place standing
in the Pac-10 Conference tomorrow afternoon when it
faces Oregon State on the road.
The Cardinal (4-1,3-0 Pac-10) has rarely defended
anything of much importance, whether it be the team's
position in the conference or an opponent's passing
game. But Saturday brings an opportunity for Stanford
to stretch its conference record out to 4-0 in a game
showcasing two of the nation's top running backs.
Oregon State sophomore Jacquizz Rodgers broke
onto the national scene as a freshman last year after he
tore up the USC defense with 187 yards and two touch
downs in the Beavers' (3-2,1-1 Pac-10) stunning win
over the Trojans last year. Rodgers, standing at only 5-

NOTES ! Stanford defends its first place ranking in the Pac-10
when it travels to Oregon on Saturday. Cardinal running back
Toby Gerhart leads the nation with 650 yards rushing. The
Cardinal faces a difficult battle on the Beavers' home turf, but
has hopes of holding a 4-0 conference record by Sunday.


foot-7, is a speedy back who relies on
his speed and cutting ability to gain
yards. His style couldn't be any more
different from that of Stanford's 6-
foot-1, 235-pound running back Toby
Gerhart, who has bulldozed his way
through opponents so far this season,
leading the nation with 650 yards rush
ing. Rodgers isn't too far behind on the
rushing leaders list, with 508 yards and
nine touchdowns of his own.
Stanford will do its best to shut
down Rodgers, who is also the
Beavers' second-leading receiver with
33 catches and 187 yards on the year.
That said, the Card defense knows it
needs to focus more on itself than the
sneaky Rodgers on Saturday.
"If you have 11 guys on defense,
and each one is going to do their job,
then you should be able to contain
whatever the offense is going to throw
at you," senior linebacker Clinton Sny
der said during Tuesday's weekly press
conference.
The Beavers won't have any easy
go at it either, as Gerhart rolls into Sat
urday's game with plenty of Heisman
talk and other superlative compli
ments at his tail.
"You dream about it as a kid," Ger
hart said of the associations his name
has gotten with the Heisman race. "It's
always been a goal coming out of high
school... It comes through the team
we've been successful this season. I
think that's why were getting the
recognition."
The Oregon State run defense
ranks somewhere in the middle of the
pack, both in the conference and na
tionally, as they give up 124 yards per
game. Though Gerhart had little trou
ble in breaking down the Bruin de
fense this past weekend, his quarter
back Andrew Luck knows it won't be
done easily on the Beavers' home ter
ritory.
"They're quick, well disciplined,
well-coached," the redshirt freshman
said.
Coach Jim Harbaugh was also wary
of the challenge the Cardinal faces in
traveling to Corvallis.
"History says that Oregon State is
about the toughest team in October
and November," he said. "It's been the
hardest place in the Pac-10 for Stan
ford to score points."
Saturday's contest will certainly be
another test for Luck, who played, as

Harbaugh said himself, the best game
of his collegiate career this past week
end against UCLA. Luck's last trip on
the road was a minor trauma, but the
freshman has already made noticeable
improvements since last month's loss
at Wake Forest. The Cardinal quarter
back knows that he still has plenty of
room to get better, as well.
"I don't think I'm satisfied with
where I'm at," Luck said. "I don't think
the team is satisfied [either]. We're just
trying to stay hungiy and work as hard
as ever."
Stanford has a perfect opportunity
to satisfy that appetite this weekend. A
win would put the Cardinal at 5-1 and
4-0 in conference, with games against
Arizona and Arizona State coming up.
All three games are winnable the
Cardinal will likely be the odds-on fa
vorite in each of them so the team
has a reasonable chance of entering
the month of November 6-0 in the Pac
-10 before it faces the conference gaunt
let of Oregon, USC and Cal, respec
tively.
Saturday's game against the
Beavers will be the first step in that di
rection, however, and the Cardinal
knows that it can't get caught looking
ahead. It just has to keep up what it's
got going.
"We just got to continue with what
we're doing," Gerhart said. "We're
changing, we're turning around."
