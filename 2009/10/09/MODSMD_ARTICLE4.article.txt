## Etchemendy reassures Senate-again 
### DEVIN BANERJEE EDITOR IN CHIEF 
It's a presentation he now knows by heart, and with new
data, Provost John Etchemendy's message to the Faculty Sen
ate on Thursday couldn't have been clearer: Stanford isn't yet
in a mode of financial growth, but is in one of financial recov
ery.
As of last month, Stanford has entered a new fiscal year,
leaving behind one that saw a 26 percent decline in the Uni
versity's endowment and the loss of 472 employees. But early
action by Etchemendy, the University's chief budgetary offi
cer, meant the second half of the fiscal year (March through
August) brought $9 million and $l7O million surpluses to
Stanford's general funds and consolidated funds budgets, re
spectively.
These surpluses, the provost said, will be used as one-time
funds to help carry departmental units into the next two fiscal
years, which will necessitate further budget reductions total
ing a projected $l3O million.
"Most of the shortfall is a result of the drop in endowment
payout and Tier 1 buffer reductions," Etchemendy said.
The Tier 1 buffer, a pool of funds used to buffer losses in
the University's general fund, plummeted from $617 million
to $69 million by the fiscal year's end, although the provost
and other budget officials had initially expected the pool to
run completely dry.
The endowment drop-off from $17.2 billion to its cur
rent value of $12.6 billion still leaves Stanford with the
third largest endowment in the nation, behind Harvard's $26
billion and Yale's $16.3 billion, and just in front of Princeton's
$12.2 billion.
With a 26 percent slide the
largest since the endowment sank
eight percent in 1974 the provost
said estimates and projections won't
allow for any growth, let alone
growth at the rate of inflation, until
the 2013 fiscal year. A more ambi
tious goal say, growth at the infla
tionary rate by fiscal year 2012
would necessitate investment returns
of 19.35 percent during both fiscal
years 2012 and 2013, a prospect
Etchemendy acknowledged as high
ly unlikely.

Funding Financial Aid
The provost admitted that, with
last year's overhauled aid policy
geared toward helping middle- and
low-income students, Stanford was
"leaning forward" without the
endowment funds required to sup
port the policy's enhancements for
the longer term.
Now, a year and a half later, the
dual impact of drops in both endow
ment funds and families' incomes is
squeezing the program tighter than
ever. The $2O million shortfall initial
ly expected has become a $4O million
deficit, and the program is now being
funded one-third by the Stanford
fund and two-thirds by the presi
dent's funds.
Etchemendy said budget officials
are still analyzing a long-term plan to
fund financial aid. As of now, the
only clear policy will be to increase
the financial aid endowment goal of
the Stanford Challenge fundraising
campaign from $2OO million to $3OO

million, which, if achieved, would
increase payout to the financial aid
program from $lO million to $l5 mil
lion.

"The Flu Is Here"
Beginning Monday, vaccines for
seasonal flu will be offered to high
risk individuals those over the age
of 50 and those with chronic illness
at Vaden Health Center. Dr. Ira
Friedman, Vaden's director, said the
vaccine will be offered free of charge
to faculty, staff and students later this
month.
The primary concern, however,
remains the spread of the HINI
virus, or swine flu. Larry Gibbs, asso
ciate vice provost for health and safe
ty, said a University planning group

meets weekly to set and update
response action priorities for con
taining the virus. One such response
action was felt earlier this week,
when, under the first full moon of the
quarter, students weren't able to lock
lips at a University-sanctioned Full
Moon on the Quad.
Although the HINI vaccine has
already begun to trickle into Santa
Clara County health services centers,
Friedman said Stanford can't receive
shipments until further action is
taken by the county and the state.
"By the end of October or begin
ning of November, we hope to have
the HINI vaccine here," he said.
