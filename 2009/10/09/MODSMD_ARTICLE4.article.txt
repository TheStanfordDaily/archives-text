## Etchemendy reassures Senate-again 
### DEVIN BANERJEE EDITOR IN CHIEF 
It's a presentation he now knows by heart, and with new
data, Provost John Etchemendy's message to the Faculty Sen

As of last month, Stanford has entered a new fiscal year,

These surpluses, the provost said, will be used as one-time
funds to help carry departmental units into the next two fiscal
years, which will necessitate further budget reductions total
ing a projected $l3O million.
"Most of the shortfall is a result of the drop in endowment
payout and Tier 1 buffer reductions," Etchemendy said.
The Tier 1 buffer, a pool of funds used to buffer losses in
the University's general fund, plummeted from $617 million
to $69 million by the fiscal year's end, although the provost
and other budget officials had initially expected the pool to
run completely dry.
The endowment drop-off from $17.2 billion to its cur

third largest endowment in the nation, behind Harvard's $26
