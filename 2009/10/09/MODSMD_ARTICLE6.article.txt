## Robert Mueller addresses GSB Director of FBI talks leadership 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Few people think of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a
corporation with an annual budget of around $7.5 billion, but in
many ways, it is. And its director, Robert S. Mueller 111, is the clos
est thing to the organization's CEO.
In a talk at the Graduate School of Business last night, Mueller
spoke to GSB and Stanford Law School alumni about effective
leadership and post-9/11 changes to the FBI.
To attend the talk, entitled "Leadership in Context:
Transforming the FBI in an Uncertain World," attendees went
through a brief security check. Multiple Bureau agents staffed the
auditorium, which was filled to capacity, but Mueller showed a
more relaxed and humorous side by immediately beginning his
talk with a joke.
"When I left [the Bay Area] eight years ago, Stanford was one
of the premier educational institutions," Mueller said. "Now, I

come back to find out that it is
nothing more than a typical foot
ball factory."
Mueller, who was appointed
FBI director by President George
W. Bush one week before 9/11, out
lined how the FBI has changed
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
"We had been reactive most of
our history," he said. "Things hap
pened and we investigated. Now
we need to anticipate, to under
stand gaps, identify and fill them.

"The new metric became: Flow
did the FBI let this happen?" he
added.
Mueller said the main goal of
the FBI has become counterter
rorism and outlined three phases
of the organization's develop
ment: triage, laying the foundation
of an intelligence agency, and its
ongoing maturation.
Mueller also spoke about the
globalization of terrorism.
"Oceans no longer protect us," he
pointed out. For this reason, the
FBI must focus on bridging rela
tions with both local and state
agencies and with counterparts
overseas.
Regarding the Patriot Act,

Mueller urged its renewal, saying it
in effect dropped a wall between
various government agencies. "Be
fore, one half could not talk to the
other half," he said.
Mueller ended on a note about
recruitment. Despite the fact that
FBI job applicants must be at least
23 years old, and the average age
of an FBf graduating class is 30,
the agency has begun recruiting on
college campuses.
Tn keeping with this new prac
tice, the FBI had a booth at Tues
day's career fair for the first time
in the school's history.
