## Univ. loses four-year patent lawsuit 
### TROY YANG 
Stanford students concerned about failure can take
comfort in the fact that their school can fall short as
well.

In 2005, the University filed a suit against Roche
Molecular Systems, Inc., a research-focused healthcare
company, claiming the company had violated patent
laws by using and producing University-patented tech
nology in their HIV test kits. Last Wednesday, howev
er, the U.S. Court of Appeals dropped the suit com
pletely, claiming Stanford had no ground for a lawsuit.
The final result may prove peculiar to the
University, which, for the better part of 20 years,
believed it held sole rights to the patents-in-suit.
"It's a novel issue because of the unusual facts,"
said Mark Lemley, a professor specializing in patent
law at Stanford Law School.

The technology related to these patents were devel
oped by three Stanford researchers, Mark Holodniy,
Thomas Merigan and David Katzenstein, in a joint
effort between Stanford and Cetus. Cetus, a biotechnol
ogy company that worked with the University in the
1980s to develop the patented technology used in the
HIV test kits, has since been bought by Roche.
But of primary interest in this case was Holodniy,
currently a professor at the School of Medicine, who
worked at Stanford as a research fellow in the
Department of Infectious Disease in 1988, and not
long after, in February of 1989, started working for
Cetus.

The point of contention stems from 1 lolodniy's
signing of a "Copyright and Patent Agreement"
(CPA) with the University and then a "Visitor's
Confidentiality Agreement" (VCA) with Cetus. Both
agreements essentially required Holodniy to assign
any patent rights he may have as a result of his work at

either institution to the respective institution.
However, because Holodniy signed with Stanford
first, the University claimed sole rights to the patented
technology in contention. Therein lies the basis for the
University's original lawsuit in 2005, as the suit
claimed that Roche's HIV test kits violated Stanford's
patents on methods of quantifying HIV in blood sam
ples.
Yet, the court reasoned that the wording of the
CPA only obligated Holodniy to sign over his rights to
the University at some undetermined time in the
future, whereas the VCA stated that Holodniy "does
hereby assign to Cetus, [his] right, title and interest in
each of the ideas, inventions and improvements" that
Holodniy may devise through working at Cetus. This
technicality contributed to the court's ruling that
Stanford was not the sole owner of the patents-in-suit,
and therefore had no standing to sue Roche,
The Federal Circuit Court likewise rejected
Stanford's argument under the Bayh-Dohl Act, which
encouraged the utilization of government-funded
research conducted by universities. Citing the law, the
University's law team pointed to a tenet that suggest
ed that any government-funded research at a universi
ty gave that university a "right of second refusal" at a
patent patent.
The court found this argument irrelevant to the
facts of the case, declaring that the Bayh-Dohl Act is
not applicable between universities and companies.
In its concluding statement, which ended this four
year-long dispute, the Court dismissed Roche's owner
ship counterclaim and remanded to dismiss Stanford's
claim, in essence granting Stanford and Roche co
ownership rights to the patents.
There are currently no figures that reveal how
much the University will lose financially as a result of
this decision, though Adrian Pruetz of Pruetz Law

Group, who argued on behalf of Roche, believed the
loss was not insignificant.
The University is now faced with two options: to
either accept the decision or to pursue the case in the
Supreme Court.
"[Stanford has] lost the case in the District Court
and now they've just lost on appeal," Pruetz said,
"which basically ends the case unless they try to get a
rehearing or take it up to the Supreme Court."
There is also the matter of how the University will
react to this decision and what, if any, actions it will
take to prepare for future quandaries of this nature.
"Anytime one gets a decision of this type, it's cer
tainly prudent to go back and review any policies or
practices to make a determination as to whether any
of those policies of practices should be altered or
amended as a result of the case," said Patrick Dunkley,
a senior University counsel. "The University is in the
process, at this point, of looking at its policies and its
practices to determine if any modifications should be
made."
Some members of the law community also think it
is conceivable that other universities and corporations
may respond to this decision, noting that a decision of
this magnitude would definitely be "on the radar" of
any institution that deals with patent rights.
"I think other universities and maybe other compa
nies, too ... anybody who has written their contract to
say, 'I promise to assign' rather than T hereby assign,'
is going to want to look at this and change what they
do," said Lemley.
"As I understand it from reading the opinion, I
think it's a correct application of its law," he added.
"The law itself is a little odd. The case law on standing
to sue ... should have a different rule."
