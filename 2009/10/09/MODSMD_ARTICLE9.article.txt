## Vacant seat sparks ASSU confusion Limon takes leave of absence for fall quarter 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
Former ASSU Senator Daniel
Limon's leave of absence has left the
undergraduate student with one less
representative in the elected body,
but leaders said this week they have
no immediate plans to replace
Limon and may wait to appoint him
a senator this winter.

Limon 'l2, who was elected with
the seventh-highest number of votes
in April after receiving the Student
of Color Coalition's endorsement,
announced in an August email to the
Senate that he would take a leave of
absence fall quarter for personal rea
sons.

The University registrar's policy
says students on leave "are not reg
istered and therefore do not have
the rights and privileges of regis
tered students." The ASSU constitu
tion restricts Senate eligibility to
registered students, rendering
Limon's announcement an effective
resignation.

At Tuesday's Senate meeting,
Chair Varun Sivaram 'll acknowl
edged as much.
However, in the days following
the meeting, Sivaram told the The
Daily that it is within the Senate's
power to fill the seat left vacant by
Limon either by holding a special
election or by appointing someone.
According to Sivaram, Limon
remains an option should he return.
Limon told The Daily late
Thursday that he does plan to return
winter quarter and seek the seat that
he vacated.
