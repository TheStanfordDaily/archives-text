## Vacant seat sparks ASSU confusion Limon takes leave of absence for fall quarter 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
Former ASSU Senator Daniel
Limon's leave of absence has left the
undergraduate student with one less
representative in the elected body,
but leaders said this week they have
no immediate plans to replace
Limon and may wait to appoint him
a senator this winter.

Limon 'l2, who was elected with
the seventh-highest number of votes
in April after receiving the Student
of Color Coalition's endorsement,
announced in an August email to the
Senate that he would take a leave of
absence fall quarter for personal rea
sons.

The University registrar's policy
says students on leave "are not reg
istered and therefore do not have
the rights and privileges of regis
tered students." The ASSU constitu
tion restricts Senate eligibility to
registered students, rendering
Limon's announcement an effective
resignation.

At Tuesday's Senate meeting,
Chair Varun Sivaram 'll acknowl
edged as much.
However, in the days following
the meeting, Sivaram told the The
Daily that it is within the Senate's
power to fill the seat left vacant by
Limon either by holding a special
election or by appointing someone.
According to Sivaram, Limon
remains an option should he return.
Limon told The Daily late
Thursday that he does plan to return
winter quarter and seek the seat that
he vacated.
Sivaram explained his view of the
Senate's options, based largely on a
discussion at Tuesday's meeting with
ASSU Advisor Nanci Howe.
"We talked about the legality of
[making an appointment] and we
couldn't find the clause explicitly
that gave us the power to do so,"
Sivaram told The Daily. "Nanci
Howe said in the past, ASSU has
done things like this. That implies by
precedent we have the ability to do
so, since it's not expressly prohibited
in the constitution."
He believes a two-thirds vote
would be required to approve an
appointment.
The last time a senator resigned
was 2008, when then-Chair Tiq
Chapa 'lO took a leave of absence.
The Senate left his seat vacant, but
struggled to define a protocol for
electing a new chair, ultimately

choosing Shelley Gao 'll.
Today, as then, there are 14 sitting
senators; the constitution requires at
least 10. ASSU Vice President Jay de
la Torre 'lO wields a tie-breaking
vote.
On the Limon issue, former
ASSU Parliamentarian Adam
Beberg, a doctoral student in com
puter science, pointed to the Senate
bylaws for guidance, noting that last
time the Graduate Student Council
filled a vacant seat, "it wasn't all that
smooth since we only had an infor
mal procedure."
Neither the constitution nor
Senate bylaws, which govern Senate
membership, spell out a protocol for
filling one vacant seat more than 28
days after a general election.
Sivaram did not indicate that he
plans to pursue either perceived
option immediately; he and other
senators expressed support for
appointing Limon winter quarter
should he indeed return.
A special election would be too
costly, he said, and appointing some
one else "would probably be a pret

ty undemocratic way to do this."
Sivaram and others were insistent
on Limon's qualifications to rejoin.
"I think he's got some more
important things on his mind right
now," Sivaram said. "We'll reconsid
er that if and when he comes back ..
. I think he earned the right to be a
senator."
Senator Zachary Warma 'll, also
columns editor for The Daily, said he
believes the Senate would support
Limon's appointment.
"The Senate, maybe even two
thirds, would more than likely
approve Limon should he come
back at the beginning of winter,"
Warma said.
Senator Mohammad Ali 'lO
voiced his support as well.
"I hope he can get back on,
because he did a lot of good work,"
Ali said.
