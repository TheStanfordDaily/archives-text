## University earns 'A-' on Sustainability Report Card 
### ALYSSA AHLUWALIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This year the Sustainability Endowment
Institute (SEI) issued Stanford an "A-" grade
on its Sustainability Report Card, and thus
reaffirmed the University's role as one of 26
"sustainability leaders" across the nation.
Each year the SEI grades surveyed universi
ties' active contributions to "green living."
Other sustainability leaders this year include
prestigious universities such as Harvard and
Yale.
The report card grades universities in nine
separate categories: climate change and energy,
administration, food and recycling, green build
ing, student involvement, transportation, endow
ment transparency, investment priorities and
shareholder engagement. Each university is also
given a total grade incorporating all categories,
with the overall average score being a "C+."
"The overall 'A-' grade Stanford received
reflects the University's strength in many of the

areas the SEI looked into," said Sustainability
Programs Manager Fahmida Ahmed.
"[Campus staff] does a tremendous amount of
activity in collaboration with the student Green
Living Council and the ASSU. Campus faculty
also gets involved in specific projects and initia
tives geared toward ensuring sustainability."
Stanford employs staff dedicated to execut
ing sustainability initiatives on campus. The
Department of Sustainability and Energy
Management focuses on issues such as water
conservation, dining services policies and build
ing energy efficiency.
The University earned the same overall
grade of "A-" last year as well.
Ahmed has said that all nine areas of noted
criteria in SEl's report have improved collec
tively for Stanford since 2008, but notes that the
grading process has become more difficult this
year.
"Three hundred thirty-two schools were
evaluated by the SEI this year versus 300 last
year; though [the SEI] never discloses its full

criteria, there is no doubt there has been an
increasing standard for evaluation," Ahmed
said. "Being a 'sustainabilitv leader' is a chal
lenge that Stanford has continued to live up to
with another 'A-' rating."
Part of Stanford's strategy for progressing
with its sustainability initiatives comes from
using the SEl's report as a means of rectifying
its weak points.
"Stanford received a 'B' rating in climate
action this year and we hope to do much better
next year," Ahmed said. "The University is
engaged in a public commitment to reducing
greenhouse gases and there is in fact currently
a plan under executive review to deal with the
initiative."
Stanford also hopes to improve student and
public awareness of campus projects. Student
organizations, such as Students for a
Sustainable Stanford (SSS), are one means for
raising public awareness.
SSS Co-president David Geeter II 'll
stressed that important work still remained to

be done,
"One of our goals is to have a greater affect
on communities outside of campus," Geeter
said. "Stanford can't be an island we need to
reach out down the street, down the road; in
particular we want to get East Palo Alto
involved."
Ahmed, too, recognized the importance of
continuing to raise awareness.
"Stanford must get the word out to students
and faculty that don't know these initiatives are
taking place all around them," she said. "Only
once everyone is aware can there be a greater
level of integration between academic pursuits
and real-world application for improved sus
tainability.
"Stanford is doing very well," she added. "It
can take this opportunity to shift even more so
in the right direction toward a 'greener'
campus."
