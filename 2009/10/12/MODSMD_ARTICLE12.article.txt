## Billionaire donates to combat climate change 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Billionaire George Soros, ranked
the world's 29th wealthiest individual
by Forbes magazine, will invest more
than $1 billion in clean-energy tech
nologies to combat climate change.
While Soros has not provided
specific details as to how his contri
butions will be spent, he said he will
enforce "stringent criteria" to the
investments.

During his announcement in
Copenhagen on Saturday evening,
Soros said he will donate an addi
tional $lOO million to establish the

Climate Policy Initiative, to be head
ed by Stanford Law School Prof.
Thomas Heller.

The Climate Policy Initiative, to
be based in San Francisco, will serve
as a global climate watchdog against
special interests, Soros said.
Soros pledged the money from
his personal fortune the day after
talks between nations in Bangkok
broke down over whether or not to
renew the Kyoto Protocol. World
leaders will meet again to discuss cli
mate change in Copenhagen in two
months.

Soros hopes his financial contri
butions will pressure government
heads to attend the Copenhagen
talks and forge a formal commit
ment to address global climate
change.

"This mindset leads to ridiculous
myths...that victims are to blame."

Health Promotion Services Director Carole Pertofsky

"If victims are feeling safe and
empowered to come forward, we are
heartened to know that our work
has resulted in students feeling safer
and more empowered to report vio
lations," she said.

Prevention & Awareness

Pertofsky, Wilson, Burns and
Davis are all part of the growing net
work of groups and individuals com
bating sexual assault. Encompassing
various organizations and depart
ments, the different groups have
focuses ranging from victims' servic
es to prosecution but all are unit
ed in the goal of ending sexual vio
lence on campus.
The lead coordinator for aware
ness, prevention, and protection
efforts at Stanford is the Sexual
Violence Advisory Board (SVAB),
which tackles issues ranging from
sexual assault to domestic and rela
tionship violence.
Begun in the fall of 2005 by Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman, the SVAB is comprised
of 25 members, with representation
from faculty, staff and students. The
SVAB advises the Vice Provost on
sexual violence issues and connects
the related groups working on cam
pus.
Pertofsky co-chairs the SVAB
with Assistant Dean of Graduate
Life Laurette Beeson. The composi
tion of the Board reflects the many
partnerships within the University;
member affiliations include HPS,
Vaden Health Center, Counseling
and Psychological Services (CAPS),
Stanford police, the YWCA, the
Women's Community Center,
ResEd and the Center for
Relationship Abuse Awareness.
In the past few years, the most
visible sexual violence activism

events have been the HPS-spon
sored production "The Real World:
Stanford" during New Student
Orientation and the candlelight walk
"Take Back the Night" in Spring
Quarter.
Along with establishing an acces
sible and confidential system of serv
ices for victims, the above groups
have attempted to change the cul
ture around sexual assault and rela
tionship abuse.
"The very prolonged and subtle
influence of patriarchal values
remains a force to contend with,"
Pertofsky said. "This mindset leads
to ridiculous myths that are wide
spread that victims are to blame,
that women 'ask for it.'"
Burns discredited the notion that
forcible offenses were committed by
unknown strangers in the dark, cit
ing that 75 percent of assaults are
perpetrated by acquaintances.
"A lot of what we do is educating
people that it is not some stereotype
that it's some scary man in the night
attacking someone," she said. "The
vast majority are being done by
someone the victim knows and
trusts."

ASSU Advocacy
From the campaign platforms of
ASSU candidates to the Bystander
campaign launched in February, the
issue of sexual assault has been
steadily gaining momentum in stu
dent politics.
In particular, ASSU Executives
David Gobaud 'OB M.S. 'lO and Jay
de la Torre 'lO have made sexual vio
lence one of their main priorities.
"We want people to know that
sexual assault happens and how it
happens," said Alisha Tolani 'lO,
Undergraduate Health and Wellness
Chair for Gobaud's Executive

Cabinet.
Gobaud and de la Torre will be
expanding upon the work of last
year's Executives Jonny Dorsey 'O9
and Fagan Harris 'O9, who drove the
"I am not a bystander" campaign
last winter.

Targeting the "culture of inac
tion," the campaign was originally
intended to function much like the
alcohol.edu programming required
of all Stanford freshmen. Tolani said
the current Executives are still
developing how they will continue
that advocacy.
"Our plan right now is to work on
an education campaign in the
spring," she said. "We're still in the
process of figuring out Bystander.
The goal is to have it in the dorms
more than it was."
De la Torre remains committed
to revising the attitudes of the
Stanford student body.
"The first goal is for people to
know that it happens," he said. "It's
not talked about very much it's a
very taboo subject. We think that if
people start recognizing that it hap
pens in the first place, that's when we
can start having a conversation."
