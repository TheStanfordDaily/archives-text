## EDITORIAL President Obama deserves the Nobel Peace Prize 
### 
When it was announced on Friday that
President Barack Obama would be
the 2009 recipient of the Nobel Peace
Prize, many Americans were taken aback, in
cluding the president himself. We all waited to
see which emotions would settle in once we
were far enough away from the initial surprise
and could accurately access the situation. What
surfaced were feelings of confusion, anxiety
and a hint of suspicion, a rather cold reaction to
what has traditionally been a cheerful and
warm event in American history. Given the cir
cumstances, this reaction makes sense: Mr.
Obama has been president for only nine
months, and his administration has not accom
plished much... yet.
The Editorial Board understands the im
portance of this award to those who give and re
ceive it, and would like to extend its most sin
cere congratulations to President Obama. Re
gardless of whatever condemnation this deci
sion receives, we firmly believe this is a very
positive and important event in American his
tory. There has already been and will doubtless
ly be more opinions that sharply criticize the
Nobel committee and the president, and these
criticisms come from both friends and foes of
the president. Some feel that this announce
ment legitimized conservatives who perpetuat
ed claims that Mr. Obama was a celebrity and
not a politician. Others felt the decision was
weighted too heavily on the future, increasing
the already excruciating burden of high expec
tations the president was under.
We feel that these criticisms are not con
structive to the peace process, and that those
who launch these criticisms fail to understand
the rationale of the committee and the purpose
of the Nobel Peace Prize. In his interview after
the announcement of this award, Nobel com
mittee chairman Thorbjorn Jagland described
the many ways in which the president fit the cri
teria set forth for awarding the prize: his strong
stance against the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, his dedication to equality and im
proving the standards of life for all people, and
his strong support for a global effort to address
climate change. Many of those critical of this
decision did not hear anything in this interview
or in the press release that proved that the pres
ident was deserving of the award. This is be
cause there was not anything tangible that sup

ported the decision; but that does not mean that
there was not anything at all.
What the president has done in his very
short time in office to deserve this award are the
indiscernible but incredibly important intangi
bles. To draw an analogy to basketball ap
propriate considering the president's passion
for the game what Mr. Obama is doing may
not show up on the stat sheets in the sports sec
tion the next day, but is absolutely essential to
the outcome. On a basketball court, that can
mean hustling up and down the court the entire
game, being poised when under pressure, and
even uniting the team in critical moments and
being an inspiration. President Obama re
ceived the Nobel Prize for very similar reasons.
The Nobel committee gave the president this
award because it noticed a significant shift in
the global spirit of diplomacy and cooperation
in the past year, and any committee would have
ultimately arrived on President Obama as the
individual most responsible for this shift.
This year, America continues to fight two
wars in the Middle East. The country is still fac
ing a mounting threat from powers such as
North Korea and Iran. In giving this award to
President Obama, the committee does not ig
nore the reality of the work that needs to be
done. But the change of perception that has
been inspired by Mr. Obama around the world
has created a climate in which solutions to these
problems can be explored. His influence may
not be represented by statistics, and the legisla
tion he supports is a work in progress, but our
president's time in office is full of substance: the
immeasurable currency of hope.
The president has done plenty to restore
hope in the United States, the country most ca
pable and most necessary to achieve the ideals
that the award strives to promote. As French
President Nicholas Sarkozy said, this award
marks "America's return to the hearts of the
world's peoples."The fact that he has only been
in office for nine months makes this accom
plishment even more commendable. We urge
you, when you think of the Nobel Prize, to re
member that this award is not determined ac
cording to statistics for peace, but in true human
sentiments. Barack Obama has affected those
sentiments on a global scale unlike any leader
in the past year, and he is absolutely deserving
of this award.
