# WEBB 2.0
## Carmageddon 
### Kevin Webb 
It was around this time last year when I
tackled head-on the lack of helmets on
campus, and as you can probably tell from
the helmetless daredevils who careen through
White Plaza (including my hypocritical self),
I've made a huge impact.
But as sour grapes are my least favorite va
rietal (I much prefer "green"), I'm giving the
whole public safety thing another go. In true
journalistic boy-wonder form, I will tackle is
sues in order of descending importance. Coin
cidentally, the order of issues also reflects my
increasing desire for vengeance.
So, first up: Campus Loop. I am terrified of
Campus Loop. At any given time, I'd guess
maybe half of those driving it are familiar with
how it works, which means that even if you fi
nally understand what to do at a six-way stop,
Lucy the Lost Tourist and Emeril the Emo
tional Parent have no idea what they should
be doing. I feel like anytime I come to a stop
sign on Campus Loop, particularly at the cor
ners of Escondido and University, I'm playing
a game of life-or-death chicken with people
who don't even know the rules.
And then, add in the bikers. Speaking as
one myself: Bikers, you are horrible human
beings. There have been so many times I've fi
nally determined, through half-starts and con
fusing eye contact with Randy the Road War
rior (he cuts through campus to shave pre
cious moments off his commute), that it was
my turn to go, only to get cut off last second by
Grady the Grad Student speeding through my
blind spot. And while Grady's helmet protects
his head from injury, my car does not protect
me from lawsuits.
The solution here is easy: Install traffic
lights. I understand this is a time of budget cuts,
but over the course of my Stanford career I
have pitched in more than enough money for
tickets (see: a couple paragraphs down) to
chip in, and I'd much rather see the money go
toward a traffic light than to the jerks who
ticketed me (again: see below).
But since I know that won't happen, here's a
proposal: Instead of getting alumni to donate
gyms with no showers or student unions with no
bowling alleys, what if we managed to have
alumni donate traffic lights? Imagine it: "Get
onto Campus, then turn right at the Arrillaga
light. If you hit the Koret light, you've gone too
far." That would be, without hyperbole, six mil
lion billion times more useful than a new Kresge.
So many issues and so little time left: park
ing spots. Since moving off campus, I have pur
chased a C permit so that I can park on cam
pus. Little did I know that in the caste system
that is parking, the C permit is the serf. If you

need to park anywhere near Tresidder,
chances are you'll drive past a couple filled A
spots, dozens of unfilled ones and then a sea of
other C permit cars that got there before you.
On the bright side, I now know where the
CCRMA is, and I also know why I'd never
been there before: It is very far from every
thing except for where I had to park.
Proposal: Given that the economy sucks
and thus fewer people will be buying an A
pass, Stanford, you should reflect the numbers
of passes owned on campus and transform
some of the less frequently used A spots into C
spots.This doesn't have to cost anything say
the word, and I will spray paint the letter C
wherever you let me.
Moving on: parking tickets. I have received,
and technically earned, three tickets since
being on this campus. The first was for parking
overnight in the wrong lot, the next for having
a yearlong permit that was exactly seven hours
expired, and the third for having a permit, but
for it not being properly displayed. All clearly
valid tickets, but all equally clearly dick moves.
0.K., final point: douchebags. On campus,
people have dinged my car no fewer than
three times and, much worse, someone
scratched the letters "XZN" onto my back
windshield two years ago. Normally the pollen
that covers my car if I park outside here an
hour is enough to cover it up, but the few times
when the car's clean it's pretty clear. I'm upset
by it, sure, but mostly, I just wish I knew what it
meant. Googling "XZN" didn't turn up any
gang names, it seems unlikely someone would
scratch such unusually distinct initials into a
car, and while it's the only thing that might
make sense, the X doesn't really resemble an
A. For the record, though, my car is Japanese.
So, there we are. My car is nearly through
with Stanford, where it's been exiled, ticketed,
sullied, threatened with accidents and possibly
been made the victim of a hate crime. It's still
got a lot of kick in it, though, so I don't expect
it to head toward the light anytime soon.

Interested in donating a traffic light? Any hot tips
about people who defaced Kevin's car, or at least
about what XZN might mean? Email Kevin at
