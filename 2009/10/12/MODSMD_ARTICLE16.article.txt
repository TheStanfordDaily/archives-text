## "My Red Book" 
### P.G. Mann 
Curse you, Carl Jung! Just when the
world was ready to forget about you,
you unveil your sordid little Red Book.
For nigh on half a century, deep in the gold
brick-lined vaults of Zurich, lay the tales of
your vaunted vision quest. Meanwhile, your
modern acolytes were busy alchemizing your
high-falutin Nazi-sympathizing Swiss sor
cery into one big, mealy-mouthed, touchy
feely, rainbow massage crystal to cure the
world of its cosmic pain. Your legacy seemed
right on track for an ignominious whimper of
an end.
Then, all of a sudden, The New York
Times announces the long-awaited publica
tion of the "holy grail of the unconscious," a
tale of a psychiatrist's struggle with psy
chosis, a modern man of science conversing
with ancient demons and a personal discov
ery that would transform our understanding
of the human mind. Now the salivating Jun
gians are dusting off their Ouija boards and
polishing their monoliths, priming for per
sonal revelation and an orgy of "Aha!" mo
ments.
Well, I've got news for you, C.J. (I know
your spirit is present. I can smell its foul pipe
tobacco). You are not the only one with a se
cret diary detailing the mysteries of the un
conscious. I, too, have cut new swaths of wis
dom into the tangled jungle of the psyche.
Everyone already knows about your break
with Freud on the eve of World War I and the
personal crisis it precipitated. Boring! But
how many people have yet to read about my
break with Dr. Leaky McNuds in those omi
nous summer months of 1997 and the voyage
of self-discovery that ensued?
I had been a devoted disciple of McNuds
for five years, enjoying the role of confidante
and heir apparent in his elite circle of rogue
urologists. He called me his "golden shower
child" potty jokes being a staple of the
urology community. Naturally, I was flattered
and my affection for my mentor was sincere.
I saw McNuds as a sort of Old Testament
prophet of the penis, thoroughly free from il
lusion or propriety, and committed to prob
ing the depths of our field from sac to tip.
The tension between us began with a con
versation one evening in McNuds' study. We
were discussing the significance of maladies

arising from overzealous shaking when at the
public urinal. McNuds was convinced that
the act betrayed a repressed sexual wish.
When I suggested that there might be a less
sexual and more sincerely spiritual meaning
to the gesture, perhaps akin to the waving of
a sorcerer's wand to purge the soul of evil
spirits, McNuds stared at me, aghast. I knew
then that if I were to pursue my own urolog
ical convictions, it would cost me my friend
ship with McNuds. And it did.
The last I saw of McNuds was at an uro
analysis convention in Indianapolis, a sausage
fest, as it is called in the parlance of our disci
pline. I delivered a paper on Ancient Egypt-

ian twisticles, wherein I remarked that Amen
hotep IV's scrotal contusion resembled the
wracked state of contemporary McNudsian
urology. McNuds fainted and, in a fit of guilt,
I leapt from the podium to catch him. After
depositing my fallen idol on the couch, I hob
bled away, having just suffered a mild scrotal
contusion myself, never to see him again.
Needless to say, I was drummed out of
uro-analysis. Left virtually without a pot to
have someone piss in, my livelihood col
lapsed. And it was then, in those sweltering
summer days of 1997, during the great fen
phen epidemic, the fall of the Woolworth's
empire, the secessionist parliament of Scot
land and finally (the spark that set off the
powder keg) the death of Princess Diana,
that I lost my mind. The ground beneath me
seemed to open up and swallow me. I became
trapped in the labyrinthine trenches of my
own besieged brain, bombarded by poison
ous shrapnel-filled thoughts.
There I was playing cards with a diffident
proto-urethra and an ancient testicle from
Carthage, worrying over my lost sanity and
my pair of fives, when the hoary Carthagin
ian leaned over and whispered in my ear, "I
am a nut, but you, my son, are perfectly sane.
Go, engrave these trials on rune stones in a
Gothic hand and illuminate them with in
structive anatomical mandalas."
I realized the only way I could maintain
my sanity was by recording my phantasies,
converting the crazed ravings of a castrated
urologist into an epic poem about the male
organ's journey through all seven dimen
sions of spirit with his medieval guide Phallus
Mundus. Phallus Mundus led me to these
depths within my self, where I struck upon
my revolutionary theories of the collective
bladder of mankind and the Ur-pubis.
And as soon as these rune stones are
hauled up from my grandmother's basement
in Joplin, Mo., where they have been kept
safe all these years, I am confident they will
be a penetrating stream of insight into the
stagnant waters of urology.

I knew then that if I
were to pursue my own
urological convictions,
it would cost me my
friendship with
McNuds.And it did.
