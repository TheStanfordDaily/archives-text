## CARD HANDLES WASHINGTON DUO Stanford defeats pair of elite conference foes 
### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE 
The No. 7 Stanford women's volleyball team
is the real deal. Last weekend, the Card defeat
ed the No. 25 Washington State Cougars, and
handed No. 3 Washington its first loss of the
year in a five-set thriller (19-25,25-15,23-25,25-
23,15-12).
The weekend was off to a great start for the
Card as it took down Washington State on Fri
day night (25-23, 20-25, 25-22, 25-22). Juniors
Cassidy Lichtman and Alix Klineman led the
way for Stanford, with Lichtman recording her
fifth triple-double of the season and Klineman
leading the team with 20 kills.
"The team did a great job of playing through
every point and making each play count," said
sophomore Stephanie Browne of the match
against WSU. "We stayed focused because we
knew that Washington State was going to be a
tough match."
The Card jumped out to a 7-2 lead in the first
set off of kills by freshman Jessica Walker and
senior Janet Okogbaa. After Washington State
battled back to tie the set up at 10, kills from
Browne, Klineman and Walker put Stanford up
15-12. Another run by Washington State would
tie it up at 17-all, but a block by Okogbaa and
two kills by Klineman would put the Card up
24-21 before it won the set 25-23.
After getting up early again at 6-2 in the sec
ond set, the Card found itself in trouble after
several runs by Washington State put the
Cougars up 16-10. A quick run by the Card was
answered by Washington State, bringing the
score to 21-27 before the Cougars closed the set
out 25-20.
The Card responded by battling through a
close third set to win 25-22 on a service ace by
freshman setter Karissa Cook.
The fourth set would start evenly with errors
leading to a score of 7-7 before two kills by
Klineman put Stanford up 9-7, a lead which
they wouldn't relinquish on its way to a 25-22
fourth-set victory.
Junior Gabi Ailes wasn't happy with how
her team played, but was glad to get the win.
"I don't think we played our best match
against WSU," she reflected. "But every game is
important to us, no matter the opponent. The
Pac-10 [Conference] is a very tough conference
and we know that if we take a night off, some
thing crazy might happen."

"Something crazy" did happen the follow
ing night in Maples Pavilion as the Card
knocked off a Washington team that had not
lost a single set, much less a match, all year.
"Being the underdog was a fun opportunity
for our team," Cook said, "and last night we
took advantage of it."
The match saw a tough start for the Card as
the Huskies won the first set 25-19 while post
ing 20 kills, but the Card would rebound in the
rest of the match, with Okogbaa recording a ca
reer-high 21 kills and Cook finishing with a sea
son-high 45 assists.
"I felt like our team did a really good job re
sponding after losing the first game," Cook said.
"We stepped up our defense and our serving
after that game and it showed."
In the second set, the Card opened up a 10-
3 lead and never relinquished it. Although the
Huskies made a quick run to cut the lead, kills
by Klineman and an ace by Ailes pushed the
lead to 18-8, and Stanford closed out the set 25-
15. The Stanford defense proved essential in
handing Washington their first set loss of the
year, as the Card hit .344 while the Huskies hit
.128.
Following a big win in the second set, Stan
ford opened up with a 3-1 lead before Washing
ton came back to tie it at nine. Washington
would pull ahead 18-16 before kills from red
shirt sophomore Stephanie Browne, Okogbaa

and Klineman would tie the set at 22. After call
ing a timeout, the Huskies came out quickly and
took the set 25-23.
The Card dropped behind 2-6 early in the
fourth set before tying it at 15. After Stanford
took the lead 17-15 on an Okogbaa kill, the
Huskies would fight back, tying the score at 23.
Okogbaa, however, wasn't done yet, recording
two straight kills and giving Stanford a 25-23
victory.
In the fifth set, Stanford jumped out to a 7-4
lead and never gave it up. A block by Okogbaa
and senior Alex Fisher closed out the set (15-
12) and won the match.

"We've made it to the fifth set against great
teams a few times already this season," Okog
baa said in reference to the California match.
"The fifth set is about starting fast, moving
onto the next play and being tough. We execut
ed these aspects of the game very well and as a
result came out with a win."
The win was certainly important for the
Card, who improved to 4-1 in the Pac-10, and
travels north to face Oregon and Oregon State
next weekend.
