# STRONG WEEKEND FOR SOCCER
## Men earn win and draw in hard-fought homestand 
### WILL SEATON 
It wasn't easy, but the Stanford men's soc
cer team managed to remain undefeated at
home over a weekend of tough conference
play against both Oregon State (1-3-0 Pacific
-10 Confernce) and Washington (1-0-3 Pac-10).
Junior Bobby Warshaw was all the offense
Stanford (7-2-1, 1-1-1) needed on Friday
against Oregon State, scoring in the 4th
minute off of a free kick. Freshman Adam
Jahn set up the free kick after pressuring Ore
gon State sophomore keeper Steve Spangler
to use his hands just over the line at the top of
the box. Warshaw and junior midfielder Do
minique Yahyavi were the only two Cardinal
players to record multiple shots on goal dur
ing the game.
The early goal allowed Stanford to play
comfortably, but as usual, the defense was
needed to maintain the lead. With another
shutout from senior goalkeeper John Moore
the 14th of his career and excellent de
fense from redshirt senior center back T.J.
Novak, Stanford was able to come out on top
of a close win. Especially important was the
fact that the Cardinal kept Oregon State's
sophomore Danny Mwanga from scoring and
adding to his seven goals scored on the season.
"OSU played a lot of long, direct balls and
Danny Mwanga, their number 10, is a great at
tacking talent. This forced us to defend a little
deeper on the field," said Stanford Coach Bret
Simon. "This game as well as the UW game
showed that we need to do a better job of fin
ishing our counter attack chances."

2/24 San Diego, Calif. 4:00 RM.

GAME NOTES ! Stanford looks to continue its impressive
season this weekend against San Diego State, followed by
a tough game against No. 2 UCLA. The Aztecs faced the
Bruins just last weekend, and fought them to a 2-2 draw.

The final score of 1-0 was a positive sign for
a team who wound up on the wrong side of
that score nine times last season.They also lost
to California the week before 1-0 in the con
ference opener, raising questions as to
whether old ghosts would come back or not.
Stanford showed exactly how much they've
changed mentally by holding tough through a
scoreless second half and earning the win at
the end of the night.
Two days later, the team was back out on
the pitch facing a recently resurgent Washing
ton team. Going into the game, Washington
was on a four-game unbeaten streak with an
overall record of 4-4-3.
Warshaw scored Stanford's lone goal early
in the game, coming again in the fourth
minute. He scored off a corner kick from jun
ior Ryan Thomas, heading it into the back of
the net and raising his count to five goals on
the season.
In the 16th minute, Washington tied the
game when Moore scored on a one-touch pass
from sophomore Brent Richards. It was the
last goal that either team would score for the
rest of the game. The first half was notable in
that there were very few shooting chances,
with both teams having only three shots on
goal at the half. The shooting picked up from
there, though, as Stanford finished with 17

shots and Washington finished with
19 overall.
Out of Stanford's 17 shots on goal,
the Washington keeper was only
forced to make three saves, with the
rest of the shots going far wide or
high.
"I think our inefficiency shooting
was mostly due to the number of UW
players in front of the goal and their
pressuring our shooters," Simon said
of the poor numbers. Washington
seemed intent on crowding the box
when on defense and making it very
difficult for a clear shot.
In the second half, the ball cov
ered a lot of ground, with both teams

having their possessions but neither
able to get a good look at a shot. Ju
nior Dominique Yahyavi controlled
the sideline, frequently beating
Washington defenders to set up a
cross, but there was rarely anyone
there to help finish the ball.
Coach Simon was quick to com
pliment the Huskies' defensive
strategy on the field.
"UW has found an effective way
to play," he said. "They defend with
eight field players and are comfort
able waiting for chances on their
counter attacks. They have two very
quick and dynamic forwards who
can wear down a defense over 90-
plus minutes of a game."
Both overtimes proved to be
more exciting than many Stanford
fans could wish for. Washington
maintained possession for the ma
jority of the match and was involved

in several close calls in the Stanford
box as the Huskies outshot Stanford
5-2 in the overtime periods. Senior
John Moore stepped up big to main
tain the tie, coming out of the fray
with the ball every time.
"The Pac-10 is holding true to
form, with all schools capable of
beating each other on any given
day," Simon said.
Should a clear leader not emerge,
each game will be importance to the
Cardinal as they try to prove them
selves a standout in the Pac-10.
Stanford heads south for their
next two games against San Diego
State and UCLA.The team will face
San Diego on Friday, Oct. 23 at 7
p.m. and the Bruins on Sunday, Oct.
25 at Ip.m.

ton team. Going into the game, Washington
was on a four-game unbeaten streak with an
overall record of 4-4-3.
Warshaw scored Stanford's lone goal early
in the game, coming again in the fourth
minute. He scored off a corner kick from jun
ior Ryan Thomas, heading it into the back of
the net and raising his count to five goals on
the season.
In the 16th minute, Washington tied the
game when Moore scored on a one-touch pass
from sophomore Brent Richards. It was the
last goal that either team would score for the
rest of the game. The first half was notable in
that there were very few shooting chances,
with both teams having only three shots on
goal at the half. The shooting picked up from
there, though, as Stanford finished with 17

The Cardinal men are putting together a great
season, bouncing back from a disappointing
4-11-3 record in 2008. Stanford has now lost
only one match since September 1st.

shots and Washington finished with
19 overall.
Out of Stanford's 17 shots on goal,
the Washington keeper was only
forced to make three saves, with the
rest of the shots going far wide or
high.
"I think our inefficiency shooting
was mostly due to the number of UW
players in front of the goal and their
pressuring our shooters," Simon said
of the poor numbers. Washington
seemed intent on crowding the box
when on defense and making it very
difficult for a clear shot.
In the second half, the ball cov
ered a lot of ground, with both teams

having their possessions but neither
able to get a good look at a shot. Ju
nior Dominique Yahyavi controlled
the sideline, frequently beating
Washington defenders to set up a
cross, but there was rarely anyone
there to help finish the ball.
Coach Simon was quick to com
pliment the Huskies' defensive
strategy on the field.
"UW has found an effective way
to play," he said. "They defend with
eight field players and are comfort
able waiting for chances on their
counter attacks. They have two very
quick and dynamic forwards who
can wear down a defense over 90-
plus minutes of a game."
Both overtimes proved to be
more exciting than many Stanford
fans could wish for. Washington
maintained possession for the ma
jority of the match and was involved

in several close calls in the Stanford
box as the Huskies outshot Stanford
5-2 in the overtime periods. Senior
John Moore stepped up big to main
tain the tie, coming out of the fray
with the ball every time.
"The Pac-10 is holding true to
form, with all schools capable of
beating each other on any given
day," Simon said.
Should a clear leader not emerge,
each game will be importance to the
Cardinal as they try to prove them
selves a standout in the Pac-10.
Stanford heads south for their
next two games against San Diego
State and UCLA.The team will face
San Diego on Friday, Oct. 23 at 7
p.m. and the Bruins on Sunday, Oct.
25 at Ip.m.
