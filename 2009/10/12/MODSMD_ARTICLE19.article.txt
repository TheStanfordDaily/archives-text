### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford continued its phenomenal start last
weekend as it began Pacific-10 Conference play
with a pair of road victories against Oregon State
and Oregon. The Cardinal notched three second
half goals against Oregon State to beat the Beavers
3-0 Friday night, and senior Kelley O'Hara put to
gether a hat trick as the Cardinal downed the
Ducks 5-1 on Sunday afternoon.
The Beavers were able to keep the game score
less for the first 55 minutes of Friday night's match,
continuing the No. 1 Cardinal's (13-0-0,2-0-0 Pac
-10) relative struggles in the first half Stanford has
now been tied with or behind its opponents at half
time in eight of its 13 matches.
The Cardinal broke the game wide open
against the Beavers (8-4-1,0-2) in the second peri
od, however, where they have now outscored their
opponents 35-5 on the season. Junior Christen
Press snuck her 11th goal of the season past Ore
gon State keeper Colleen Boyd in the 55th minute,
taking a low shot off a pass from sophomore Lind-

say Taylor. Press had seven shots in the game, and
now leads the team with 72 tries.

Sophomore Camille Levin scored an impres
sive one-on-one goal in the 83rd minute before
Taylor netted one of her own to finish the scoring
in the 88th. The Cardinal's junior keeper Kira
Maker, meanwhile, earned her seventh shutout of
the season with two saves.
Cardinal Head Coach Paul Ratcliffe has seen
his team struggle to score in the first half plenty of
times this season, and the story was the same in his
team's first Pac-10 matchup.
"Every game in this conference is hard," Rat
cliffe said. "We've got to play our best and believe
we're going to score and break the ice."
The Cardinal offense managed to do just that
two days later, continuing its dominant trip to the
Northwest with a 5-1 rout of Oregon (8-4-1,0-2).
Stanford scored three goals in the first half and out
shot the Ducks 17-5 on the day. O'Hara got the
scoring started in the 17th minute off a Taylor pass,
and then scored again just three minutes later with
a header from a 40-foot pass, again from Taylor.
O'Hara would strike again in the 58th minute, put
ting her team up 4-1 and earning her first career hat
trick something that,given her prolific offensive
record, surprised her coach.
"I didn't know that," Ratcliffe said. "I'm very
surprised. I assumed she had a few already."
Sophomore Lindsay Taylor added a goal to go
along with her two impressive assists to O'Hara,
and is now third on the team with 15 points. Taylor,
after being named the Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year in 2008, began this season struggling with a
virus. Her coach is happy to see her returning to
shape.
"She's gotten stronger and stronger each game
as her fitness has improved," Ratcliffe commented.
"I expect her to continue to get better and better."
Press contributed her second goal of the week
end in the 62nd minute, arcing a 30-footer past
Ducks keeper Cody Miles, who was taken out of
the game alfer giving up her fifth goal. Press is now
second to O'Hara on the Cardinal with 12 scores
on the season.
