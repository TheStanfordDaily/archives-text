## Area students connect at Splash! 2009 Semi-annual education event draws 800 students 
### ANN TYLER MOSES 
This weekend, some 800 high school stu
dents from the Bay Area and beyond
descended on the Stanford campus to learn
about everything from quantum mechanics
and Ultimate frisbee to Argentine tango
and graphic design.
The two-day event, better known as
Splash!, gives area middle and high school
students the opportunity to learn from
Stanford students and faculty in specialized
one- to two-hour classes.
First organized by the Stanford
Educational Studies Program in 2007,
Splash! is held semi-annually in the fall and
spring.
Despite its brief duration, Splash! is "a
transformative experience" for both partic
ipants and the Stanford undergraduates,
graduate students and professors who
teach them, said physics graduate student
Michael Shaw 'l2, who directs the program.
"Our goal is lowering the activation
energy of teaching," Shaw said. "All a
Stanford student or professor must
do is find a topic they are passion
ate about and undergo a brief
teacher training session, and they
are able to teach a class over the
weekend."
Passion for a subject appears to be
in no short supply on campus: Over
200 courses were offered this year.
"It's always rewarding to teach
kids about a subject you are passion
ate about," said Nathan Woodling 'l2,
a neuroscience graduate student who
helped teach a class about the brain.
"And the questions you get are some
times unexpected and almost
more interesting than those from
adults."
On Saturday morning, the stu
dents in Woodling's class listened
raptly as he explained the brain's
functions. Hands shot up when a
question was asked and the students
grinned in disbelief when handed real
human brains to examine.
In polls given after last year's
Splash!, 21 percent of students
reported that they had learned more
in the weekend than they had in a
month of high school.
"These students realize that learn
ing is something that's actually fun,"
Shaw said of Splash!
The program began at MIT 53
years ago, and in 2007 Shaw brought
the idea to Stanford when he enrolled
as a graduate student. The first year,
the program reached 300 area stu
dents.
This year, around 800 students
participated, and the administrators
hope to keep increasing the number.
MlT's program currently involves
over 2,000 participants.
Splash! programs also occur at the
University of Chicago and New York

University and are in the works at
UC-Berkeley and Duke. In the
future, Shaw and the other leaders
hope to cooperate with these other
schools to strengthen the program as
a whole.
Other future plans involve creat

ing a student representative program
in the area so participants can have a
hand in the program's planning and
sustain the friendships they make
over the weekend. The administra
tors are also considering extending
Splash! into a multi-week program.

Though the experience is
poignantly brief, its impact on partici
pants lingers. For Shaw, all of the
work that goes into the weekend is
more than worth it.
"When you see hundreds of stu
dents together enjoying themselves,

and you know that you had a part in
making that happen well, it's not
changing the world, but it's a huge
step along the way."
