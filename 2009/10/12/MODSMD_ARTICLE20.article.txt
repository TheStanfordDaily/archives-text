# Beavers burst the bubble

### Daniel Bohm 
Well, that was sobering. In
beating Stanford 38-28
Saturday in Corvallis,
Oregon State revealed
some holes in the resurgent Cardinal
some holes that Stanford needs to
patch quickly before it runs the
gauntlet of its schedule coming up.
In jumping out to a 4-1 start to the
season, Stanford was the aggressor
on both sides of the line of scrim
mage, The Cardinal pushed people
around, controlled the clock and
demonstrated a toughness that hasn't
been seen on the Farm in a decade.
That, along with the swagger that
helped the team become a chic Rose
Bowl pick for some analysts this
week, disappeared Saturday.
In defense of the Cardinal offense,
it found itself in such a massive hole
early, that digging out involved being
more cute offensively then it would
like, meaning the offensive line and
the bull that is Toby Gerhart could
not established themselves physical
ly-
The defense, however, was where
the problems lay.
Oregon State controlled the
tempo of the game by taking advan
tage of a festering problem that final
ly bit the Cardinal in the behind a
very-banged up defensive line.
Injured on the front-four for the
Cardinal are starters Erik Lorig and
Matt Masifilo, as well as key reserve
Brian Bulcke,
Their absences cannot be under
stated. It means that space-eaters
Ekom Udofia and Sione Fua are
forced to play almost twice as many
snaps as they normally would each
game with true freshman Terrence
Stephens as the only other healthy
defensive tackle left in the rotation.
The effects of this were tangible
Saturday, as the Cardinal defensive
line was pushed back and often car
ried for extra yards by Beavers' run
ning back Jacquizz Rodgers.
Further complicating the problem
was the inability for all 11 Cardinal
defenders to get off of blocks and
make tackles Saturday. Rodgers may
as well have been wearing Crisco on
his uniform with the way defenders
were slipping off of him left and right.
When Rodgers wasn't gashing the
defense, Sean "Steve Young" Can
field was camped in the pocket find
ing open receivers between Stanford
linebackers and defensive backs.
The linebacking core seemed slow
to drop into its hook zones, while the
defensive backs were often caught
with their eyes in the backfield.
Then there is my major question
about the defense. Why on earth was
Stanford not blitzing more?
With a tired defensive line, getting
pressure on Canfield with a four-man
rush was seemingly impossible, and
when Stanford did blitz and flush
Canfield from the pocket, he was far
less effective.
Instead, the Cardinal defense
seemed content to read and react,
which is difficult to do against a team
with superior athleticism, like the
Beavers.
This is not to put the whole game
on the defense. The special team,
which has been a major factor for the
Cardinal all year, was vastly out
played Saturday. Neither of the pun
ters, David Green and Daniel Zych
linski, kicked the ball well, and ace
kick returner Chris Owusu seemed
tentative to get his pads parallel and
go upfield for the first time all season.
Tlien there was the punt return
game, which was, to put it nicely, an
adventure. Corvallis is not an easy
place to field punts, but Richard Sher
man has to do a better job back there
then he did Saturday.
Yes, some will say there was bad
officiating Saturday, which there was.
Mark Mueller's "roughing the
punter" penalty was a bad call at best
and probably more like an atrocious
call as was the first half's phantom
face-mask penalty on Kris Evans and
Chase Thomas' very borderline
roughing-the-passer penalty. All the
penalties were huge in extending
Beaver scoring drives.
That said, the Cardinal was still
overmatched, allowing 189 rushing
yards to Rodgers, and also was on the
road, with what I believe was the
same abysmal officiating crew that
jobbed Washington against Notre
