# Sexual assault lingers
## Ten cases reported on campus in 2008 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Ten cases of sexual assault were
reported on campus in 2008, according to
statistics released by the Stanford
Department of Public Safety earlier this
month. While the number of cases over
the past three years has held constant,
advocates against sexual violence say
that far more work still needs to be done.
For Vaden Director of Wellness and
Health Promotion Services (HPS)
Carole Pertofsky, success won't be
declared until the number is reduced to
zero.
"Our goal is to prevent the assaults
from happening," she wrote in an email
to The Daily.
Understanding the Numbers
The report defines forcible sex offens
es as "any sexual act directed against
another person, forcibly or against that
person's will," including rape and
forcible fondling.
Of the 10 reported cases on campus
last year, three were categorized as rape,
five as forcible fondling and two as
'other' offenses. Nine of the 10 assaults
were located in student residences,
meaning the majority of attacks occurred
within dorms and houses.
Though perceived by some as alarm
ingly high, Stanford's 2008 numbers are
comparable with reports from other
institutions.

Every year, in accordance with the
Federal Clery Act of 1990, universities
and colleges nationwide collect and pub
lish campus crime statistics. The Clery
Act requires colleges to track certain
crimes sexual assault among them
using standardized collection and cate
gorization protocols.
Clery data, compiled by the U.S.
Department of Education, reveals
Stanford within the average range for
2008.
Police departments at Harvard,
Princeton and Yale reported 15, 17 and

11 forcible sex offenses respectively. On
the other end of the spectrum, UC-
Berkeley, San Jose State, and MIT
recorded two, three and three similar
crimes for the same year.

"Underreporting is rampant"
According to both law enforcement
officials and health professionals, the
actual number of incidents is far higher.
Because of the sensitive nature of the
crime, many offenses go unreported.

Vaden Health Center for victims of sexual assault.
Reported forcible sexual offenses have plateaued in recent
years, but advocates say more work needs to be done.
