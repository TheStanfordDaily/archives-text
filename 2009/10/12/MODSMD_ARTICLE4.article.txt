Four Stanford Medical School
research teams were awarded $3O
to $4O million in grants to be given
over seven years as part of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute's recently created
Progenitor Cell Biology
Consortium (PCBC).
A total of 17 research groups
across the nation received the
money as part of a $l7O million
effort to facilitate collaboration
on stem cell research.
The Stanford beneficiaries are
teams headed by Profs. Irving
Weissman, Mark Krasnow, John
Cooke and Robert Robbins.
The four researchers are devel
oping stem cell-related therapies
for maladies such as leukemia,
vascular ailments and immune dis
orders.
Krasnow's team is researching
the development of lung stem cells

and lung tissues, while Cooke and
collaborators are focusing on vas
cular regeneration. Robbins'
group is studying therapies for
congestive heart failure, and
Weissman is examining the forma
tion of a primitive immune system
in protochordates.
Weissman's work is in collabo
ration with fellow grant recipient
Krasnow and Bioengineering Prof.
Stephen Quake, who has devel
oped a method for the biochemi
cal analysis of individual cells.
Over the next seven years $5.25
million of the grant will go to
Weissman, Krasnow and Quake.
Weissman's studies in particu
lar have centered on the role of
stem cells in the spread of
leukemia within the body. His
team has found that there is a spe
cific protein in leukemia stem cells
that prevents macrophages a
type of white blood cell from
recognizing cancer cells as hostile.
Weissman believes that other
cell cancers express this gene as
well.
