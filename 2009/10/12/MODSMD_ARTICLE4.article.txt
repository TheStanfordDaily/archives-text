## Stem cell researchers granted $3O-40 million Profs. Krasnow, Robbins, Weissman, Cooke funded

Four Stanford Medical School
research teams were awarded $3O
to $4O million in grants to be given
over seven years as part of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute's recently created
Progenitor Cell Biology
Consortium (PCBC).
A total of 17 research groups
across the nation received the
money as part of a $l7O million
effort to facilitate collaboration
on stem cell research.
The Stanford beneficiaries are
teams headed by Profs. Irving
Weissman, Mark Krasnow, John
Cooke and Robert Robbins.
The four researchers are devel
oping stem cell-related therapies
for maladies such as leukemia,
vascular ailments and immune dis
orders.
Krasnow's team is researching
the development of lung stem cells

and lung tissues, while Cooke and
collaborators are focusing on vas
cular regeneration. Robbins'
group is studying therapies for
congestive heart failure, and
Weissman is examining the forma
tion of a primitive immune system
in protochordates.
Weissman's work is in collabo
ration with fellow grant recipient
Krasnow and Bioengineering Prof.
Stephen Quake, who has devel
oped a method for the biochemi
cal analysis of individual cells.
Over the next seven years $5.25
million of the grant will go to
Weissman, Krasnow and Quake.
Weissman's studies in particu
lar have centered on the role of
stem cells in the spread of
leukemia within the body. His
team has found that there is a spe
cific protein in leukemia stem cells
that prevents macrophages a
type of white blood cell from
recognizing cancer cells as hostile.
Weissman believes that other
cell cancers express this gene as
well.
His team recently discovered
several antibodies that prevent
this protein from deterring the
macrophage. Weissman and his
team are currently working
toward preclinical therapies.
Additionally, Weissman's team
at Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Research Station is studying the
development of a primitive pre
ventive immune system in an
ocean-dwelling organism,
Botryllus schlosseri.
With the $8.4 million his lab
will receive, Cooke said he intends
to pursue a recently discovered
type of stem cell, the induced
pluripotent stem cell (IPSC),
which is derived from reverted
somatic cells cells that form the
bodies of organisms as opposed to
sperm or egg cells.
"IPSCs are changing the game
in stem cell biology," Cooke said.
Cooke said he believes IPSCs
will be especially beneficial
because they are less controver
sial than embryonic stem cells and
differentiate more readily than
adult stem cells. They are also
derived from the patients receiv
ing the treatment and require no
immunosuppressive drugs.
He noted that the methods for
developing IPSCs have not been
perfected and will require more
research before they are safe for
clinical use.
His eventual goal is to create
safe stem cell therapies for com
plications arising from heart
attacks, partial cardiovascular
blockages and tears in arterial
walls.
Through the PCBC, Weissman
hopes to enable greater under
standing of stem cells and how
they relate to disease therapies.
Cooke said he envisions the
PCBC as an invaluable tool in the
further development of the stem
cell biology field.
"I think there will be tremen
dous synergy amongst groups in
the consortium," Cooke said.
