# BEAVERS 38 CARDINAL 28
## REALITY CHECK Oregon State deals Stanford its first conference loss 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two emphatic victories over Pacific
-10 Conference opponents had Stanford
on top of the conference, but Oregon
State quickly brought the Cardinal down
to earth.
The Beavers' 38-28 victory on
Saturday was not nearly as close as the
score indicates. OSU (4-2, 2-1 Pac-10)
took a 31-7 halftime lead behind sopho
more running back Jacquizz Rodgers, the
conference's reigning Offensive Player of
the Year, who rushed for two touch
downs in the first quarter and four over
all. Rodgers and his brother James, a
wide receiver, along with senior quarter
back Sean Canfield, carved up a lethargic
Cardinal defense for a total of 463 yards.
In what would have been a statement
game to the rest of the conference if
not the nation Stanford (4-2, 3-1 Pac
-10) seemed out of sync from the start.
Redshirt freshman Andrew Luck lofted a
beautiful, sure-touchdown pass to sopho
more Chris Owusu on the first play of the
Cardinal's first drive, but Owusu
dropped the ball. The play had deep ram
ifications: Luck could not get into a
groove for quite some time afterward,
and the Cardinal was continually forced
to punt.
"I just wasn't getting in rhythm and

wasn't getting in stride and delivering the
ball," Luck said. "I'm very disappointed."
The Cardinal's inability to move the
ball on offense allowed the Beavers to
control the game. Oregon State put
together long, methodical drives that
always seemed destined for a score but
ate up a tremendous amount of time
simultaneously. OSU did not punt until
