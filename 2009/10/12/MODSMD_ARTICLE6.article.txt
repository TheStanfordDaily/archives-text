# BEAVERS 38 CARDINAL 28
## REALITY CHECK Oregon State deals Stanford its first conference loss 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two emphatic victories over Pacific
-10 Conference opponents had Stanford
on top of the conference, but Oregon
State quickly brought the Cardinal down
to earth.
The Beavers' 38-28 victory on
Saturday was not nearly as close as the
score indicates. OSU (4-2, 2-1 Pac-10)
took a 31-7 halftime lead behind sopho
more running back Jacquizz Rodgers, the
conference's reigning Offensive Player of
the Year, who rushed for two touch
downs in the first quarter and four over
all. Rodgers and his brother James, a
wide receiver, along with senior quarter
back Sean Canfield, carved up a lethargic
Cardinal defense for a total of 463 yards.
In what would have been a statement
game to the rest of the conference if
not the nation Stanford (4-2, 3-1 Pac
-10) seemed out of sync from the start.
Redshirt freshman Andrew Luck lofted a
beautiful, sure-touchdown pass to sopho
more Chris Owusu on the first play of the
Cardinal's first drive, but Owusu
dropped the ball. The play had deep ram
ifications: Luck could not get into a
groove for quite some time afterward,
and the Cardinal was continually forced
to punt.
"I just wasn't getting in rhythm and

wasn't getting in stride and delivering the
ball," Luck said. "I'm very disappointed."
The Cardinal's inability to move the
ball on offense allowed the Beavers to
control the game. Oregon State put
together long, methodical drives that
always seemed destined for a score but
ate up a tremendous amount of time
simultaneously. OSU did not punt until

GAME NOTES: Stanford suffered its first conference
loss of 2009 against Oregon State last weekend,
and looks to rebound against a Wildcat team that
it narrowly defeated last year, 24-23, in its home
coming game. Arizona is coming off a tough 36-
33 loss to conference rival Washington.

The Cardinal, after defeating its first three Pac-10 opponents, was
handed a humbling loss in Corvallis, Ore. on Saturday night.
Stanford hasn't beaten the Beavers on the road since 2005.

the third quarter, as they scored touch
downs on their first four drives and
added a field goal before the half. The
Beavers were able to drive and con
vert third downs seemingly at will.
"They did a good job keeping up
off of the field in the first and second
half," said Coach Jim Harbaugh.
"They were long-possession drives."
Much of their success was derived
from Rodgers' performance. The
diminutive back displayed a combi
nation of speed and power that the
Cardinal simply could not defend; his
ability to freeze Stanford defenders
and then beat them to any one area of
the field was a skill not yet demon
strated by an opponent this year.
"He was very effective getting
around the perimeter, whether he
was catching it out of the backfield or
being able to jump two gaps to get
outside, and that was breaking us
down," Harbaugh said.
"He's a rare kind of guy," said sen
ior safety Bo McNally. "With a guy
that's as talented as him it's kind of
like with Toby in that you know
what's coming, but nobody can stop
it."

Rodgers emerged as the clear star
of the game, overshadowing Gerhart,
his Stanford counterpart, in the
process. Gerhart did not have a poor
performance —he tallied 96 yards
and two touchdowns but he was

hardly the force that he had been
over the previous few weeks. Luck
finished with 30 attempts, his second
highest total of the year, as the Cardi
nal was forced to go through the air to
try and make up points quickly.
Indeed, in Stanford's first extend
ed chance to play from behind, the
Cardinal proved why a game plan
that relies on power running, while
great when ahead, can be cumber
some when trying to close the score.
Stanford needed quick strikes, which
neutralized Gerhart, its greatest
threat, until goal line scenarios.
"The way things went, my role was
to protect and make plays on the re
ceiving end," Gerhart said.
With the burden transferred to
Luck's shoulders, the young signal
caller stepped up after a rocky start.
He led three scoring drives in the sec
ond half, but the Cardinal simply ran
out of time. Stanford scored with 25
seconds left to close the deficit to 10,
but was unable to convert the two
point conversion that would have
made it a one-possession game; the
Beavers secured the ensuing onside
kick to seal their victory.
The Cardinal placed a lot of the
blame on itself for poor execution.
"We hurt ourselves," Gerhart said.
"It is things we did wrong and we just
need to fix those things."
Stanford will have a chance to do

just that next week when it heads to the
desert to face Arizona (3-2,1-1 Pac-10),
who lost a close game this week to a
Washington squad the Cardinal beat
badly two weeks ago. Gerhart is opti
mistic.
"We are excited to get back to work
and get right back on pace where we
were," he said.
NOTES: Harbaugh's displeasure with
the officiating was apparent all game.
One play in particular a question
able roughing the punter called in the
third quarter —allowed an Oregon
State drive to continue, and the Beavers
milked the clock into the fourth quarter
before scoring . . . Harbaugh made
two notable changes in-game: he re
placed junior linebacker Chike Amajoyi
with freshman Shayne Skov, and soph
omore punter David Green with fresh
man Daniel Zychlinki. . . Senior Clin
ton Snyder again led the Cardinal in
tackles, with 12 total against the
Beavers . . . Luck finished 12-30 for
226 yards and two touchdowns ... Ju

only receivers with more than one catch.

Two emphatic victories over Pacific
-10 Conference opponents had Stanford
on top of the conference, but Oregon
State quickly brought the Cardinal down
to earth.
The Beavers' 38-28 victory on
Saturday was not nearly as close as the
score indicates. OSU (4-2, 2-1 Pac-10)
took a 31-7 halftime lead behind sopho
more running back Jacquizz Rodgers, the
conference's reigning Offensive Player of
the Year, who rushed for two touch
downs in the first quarter and four over
all. Rodgers and his brother James, a
wide receiver, along with senior quarter
back Sean Canfield, carved up a lethargic
Cardinal defense for a total of 463 yards.
In what would have been a statement
game to the rest of the conference if
not the nation Stanford (4-2, 3-1 Pac
-10) seemed out of sync from the start.
Redshirt freshman Andrew Luck lofted a
beautiful, sure-touchdown pass to sopho
more Chris Owusu on the first play of the
Cardinal's first drive, but Owusu
dropped the ball. The play had deep ram
ifications: Luck could not get into a
groove for quite some time afterward,
and the Cardinal was continually forced
to punt.
"I just wasn't getting in rhythm and

wasn't getting in stride and delivering the
ball," Luck said. "I'm very disappointed."
The Cardinal's inability to move the
ball on offense allowed the Beavers to
control the game. Oregon State put
together long, methodical drives that
always seemed destined for a score but
ate up a tremendous amount of time
simultaneously. OSU did not punt until

GAME NOTES: Stanford suffered its first conference
loss of 2009 against Oregon State last weekend,
and looks to rebound against a Wildcat team that
it narrowly defeated last year, 24-23, in its home
coming game. Arizona is coming off a tough 36-
33 loss to conference rival Washington.


MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
The Cardinal, after defeating its first three Pac-10 opponents, was
handed a humbling loss in Corvallis, Ore. on Saturday night.
Stanford hasn't beaten the Beavers on the road since 2005.

the third quarter, as they scored touch
downs on their first four drives and
added a field goal before the half. The
Beavers were able to drive and con
vert third downs seemingly at will.
"They did a good job keeping up
off of the field in the first and second
half," said Coach Jim Harbaugh.
"They were long-possession drives."
Much of their success was derived
from Rodgers' performance. The
diminutive back displayed a combi
nation of speed and power that the
Cardinal simply could not defend; his
ability to freeze Stanford defenders
and then beat them to any one area of
the field was a skill not yet demon
strated by an opponent this year.
"He was very effective getting
around the perimeter, whether he
was catching it out of the backfield or
being able to jump two gaps to get
outside, and that was breaking us
down," Harbaugh said.
"He's a rare kind of guy," said sen
ior safety Bo McNally. "With a guy
that's as talented as him it's kind of
like with Toby in that you know
what's coming, but nobody can stop
it."

Rodgers emerged as the clear star
of the game, overshadowing Gerhart,
his Stanford counterpart, in the
process. Gerhart did not have a poor
performance —he tallied 96 yards
and two touchdowns but he was

hardly the force that he had been
over the previous few weeks. Luck
finished with 30 attempts, his second
highest total of the year, as the Cardi
nal was forced to go through the air to
try and make up points quickly.
Indeed, in Stanford's first extend
ed chance to play from behind, the
Cardinal proved why a game plan
that relies on power running, while
great when ahead, can be cumber
some when trying to close the score.
Stanford needed quick strikes, which
neutralized Gerhart, its greatest
threat, until goal line scenarios.
"The way things went, my role was
to protect and make plays on the re
ceiving end," Gerhart said.
With the burden transferred to
Luck's shoulders, the young signal
caller stepped up after a rocky start.
He led three scoring drives in the sec
ond half, but the Cardinal simply ran
out of time. Stanford scored with 25
seconds left to close the deficit to 10,
but was unable to convert the two
point conversion that would have
made it a one-possession game; the
Beavers secured the ensuing onside
kick to seal their victory.
The Cardinal placed a lot of the
blame on itself for poor execution.
"We hurt ourselves," Gerhart said.
"It is things we did wrong and we just
need to fix those things."
Stanford will have a chance to do

just that next week when it heads to the
desert to face Arizona (3-2,1-1 Pac-10),
who lost a close game this week to a
Washington squad the Cardinal beat
badly two weeks ago. Gerhart is opti
mistic.
"We are excited to get back to work
and get right back on pace where we
were," he said.
NOTES: Harbaugh's displeasure with
the officiating was apparent all game.
