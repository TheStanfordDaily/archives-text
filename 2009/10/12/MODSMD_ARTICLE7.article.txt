# STUDENT LIFE
## Groups celebrate black life in "Black Plaza" 
### EVELYN KELLEY 
Last Friday, White Plaza was turned inside
out and upside down in a "takeover" sponsored
by various black community groups. With free
Popeyes and music blasting across the renamed
"Black Plaza," students reunited with old
friends as new freshmen were introduced to
black student life on campus.
Held every year, Black Plaza is a collabora

tion between various black student groups at
Stanford, including the Black Student Union,
NAACP at Stanford, the Black African Student
Association, the Black Graduate Student
Association and the Black Community Services
Center (BCSC).
The idea of Black Plaza was first proposed in
2001 by then-mechanical engineering graduate
student Lawrence Neely 'O7 as away for the
black community to come together. He hoped

that it would help fight the isolation that he and
fellow graduate students felt at Stanford,
according to BCSC Director Jan Barker-
Alexander.
Initiated and planned by students, Black
Plaza has since evolved, and the event draws
students of all ethnicities interested in black
culture.
