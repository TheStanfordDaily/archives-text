# STUDENT LIFE
## Groups celebrate black life in "Black Plaza" 
### EVELYN KELLEY 
Last Friday, White Plaza was turned inside
out and upside down in a "takeover" sponsored
by various black community groups. With free
Popeyes and music blasting across the renamed
"Black Plaza," students reunited with old
friends as new freshmen were introduced to
black student life on campus.
Held every year, Black Plaza is a collabora

tion between various black student groups at
Stanford, including the Black Student Union,
NAACP at Stanford, the Black African Student
Association, the Black Graduate Student
Association and the Black Community Services
Center (BCSC).
The idea of Black Plaza was first proposed in
2001 by then-mechanical engineering graduate
student Lawrence Neely 'O7 as away for the
black community to come together. He hoped

that it would help fight the isolation that he and
fellow graduate students felt at Stanford,
according to BCSC Director Jan Barker-
Alexander.
Initiated and planned by students, Black
Plaza has since evolved, and the event draws
students of all ethnicities interested in black
culture.
"Black Plaza is an exercise in
community-building not only for
black people, expanding to include
other ethnicities," Barker-
Alexander said.
NAACP at Stanford member
Mia Shaw 'l2 thought the event
celebrates the spirit of fellowship.
"It was a great excuse to share
food, music and laughter; it's one
place where we can all get togeth
er," she said.
In that spirit, black student
groups, ranging in focuses from
academic to social, set up tables
laden with information and
manned with representatives.
Association leaders used the
event as away to highlight groups
tied to the black community that
might have been overlooked at the
beginning of the year. They hoped
to attract students that may not
have gotten a chance to sign up at
the Activities Fair last month.
The tables enclosed a makeshift
dance floor where circles sponta
neously formed, with the exception
of dancing to the Cha-Cha Slide,
when spectators flooded the center
to form a line, some still eating
their food.
Other events within Black Plaza
included class pictures, but for the
most part it provided a break in
the busy schedule of Stanford stu
dents.
When all was said and done,
people still lingered, chatting
amongst friends.
The various student life groups
involved in the event will collabo
rate again for the Black
Community Welcome during
Admit Weekend in the spring.
