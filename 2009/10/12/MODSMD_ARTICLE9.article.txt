## Hey Stranger, be my virtual friend Students engage in friend "padding" in attempt to boost popularity on Facebook 
### PERI UNVER 
Ah, Facebook. An effective means of
social networking, keeping in touch with
long-lost friends, great even for the occa
sional stalking of an ex-boyfriend or girl
friend. But wait, he has more friends
than me!
A new wave of the trend called friend "padding"
has hit. In other words, this is adding or "friending"
people just for the sake of making that all-too
important friend number go up. We've all seen it
people with 1,000,2,000 friends or more. Either they
are extremely popular or they do not really know
half the people on their friend lists.
Ruby Lee 'l3 acknowledged that she has a high
friend count, even if many are just acquaintances.
"I know all the people," she said. "Even if we
haven't met directly, we have mutual friends in com
mon and I know them from somewhere."

Around the dorms, the word has been that these
numbers have gone up quite a bit for freshmen after
New Student Orientation. College is a time for
meeting new people. With the opportunities to meet
people afforded by so many classes, activities and
dorm life, "friend" numbers can be expected to
increase.
When questioned directly, many students
acknowledged that others may "pad" but not them
selves. Most said they wanted to make sure they
knew someone before they "friended" or accepted
them.
Some even left requests in limbo, without con
firming or ignoring them, while others just accepted
requests regardless.
"I get some requests from people I don't really
know," said Tina Zheng 'l2. "It seems like 'friend
padding' at times."
Nevertheless, most students agree that it will be
a while before Facebook reaches Myspace's creepi

ness level and becomes outdated.
"One of the floors in our dorm is even themed
Facebook, showing just how popular it is right now,"
said Jenny Wolochow 'lO, a College Assistant (CA)
at Freshman Sophomore College.
The massive friend adding phenomena has even
become a topic of interest for the national media. A
recent CNN blog stirred debate about whether
Facebook has the right to limit the number of
friends a person can have (said to be 5,000), and
questioned why people are not allowed to add more
than 180 friends at a time. Yet why do we care so
much about the number of friends we have? When
did it become about quantity rather than quality?
Also, has Facebook become a continuation of high
school in that we measure others by how "popular"
we think they are?
Most students admitted that they do look at the
number of friends people have subconsciously,
though it doesn't really matter to them. An interest

ing point may be that no one said they add people
that they do not know. It is a small world perhaps
we do all have some sort of connection. Even those
with over 1,000 friends said that they know every
one on their list, one way or another.
But where is the satisfaction in having a four
digit friend count? A handful are friends, the rest
just clog up our news feed. Maybe we like to stalk
acquaintances for procrastination purposes. Maybe
there's an unspoken desire to show friends back
home that college life is more social than it really is.
Or maybe the number that stares back at us makes
something we never take the time to count tangible.
Even though most students did not admit to
being avid "friend padders," it is easy to just type in
a name and click "friend." The truth is, it seems that
most of us have probably done it at some point or
another.
