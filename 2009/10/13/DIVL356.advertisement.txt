HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA

In the richest country in the world, approximately 45 million people -about 1 in 6
Americans -lack health insurance. Numerous studies have demonstrated that lack of
insurance is associated with worse health outcomes. For those that do have insurance, the
costs of care are rising rapidly, leading many to postpone or forego needed care. Additional
evidence has documented major lapses in the quality of care. And despite spending more
on health care than any other country, the overall health of Americans lags behind their
European and Canadian counterparts in many respects.
We can do better. Our panel considers a number of alternative proposals for reform.
