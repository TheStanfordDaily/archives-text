## Student start-ups recognized by Time Non-profit companies from Stanford design course applauded by Time 
### TINA ZHENG 
Time Magazine recently featured two Stanford start-ups
on its list of "Responsibility Pioneers," which the magazine
believes represents global stewardship and ethical con
sumerism.
Both start-ups, Embrace and D.light Design, emerged
directly from the Graduate School of Business (GSB) course
"Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Affordability."
The course, which is in its seventh year, is taught by Profs.
Jim Patell and David Beach in conjunction with the Stanford
Institute of Design, also known as the'd.school."
Patell pinpointed some of the key aspects of the course
that allow it to cultivate successful entrepreneurs. "We
believe strongly in multidisciplinary teams," he said. "You've
got to produce a physical prototype, you've got to create a
business plan, you've got to demonstrate deep empathy."
According to Patell, over its history the course has had
students from 17 different departments. These students, as
well as faculty, have visited developing nations such as
Myanmar, Indonesia, India, Rwanda and Bangladesh to gain
a concrete understanding of what people in those countries
need most.
"You can't sit here in the West, and you can't sit here in
Palo Alto in front of a computer screen to do that," Patell
said.
Patell described the process of designing products to
meet developing nations' needs as beginning with eager
partners who present problems to solve and have the means
to solve them. The students design the product and work out
the logistics. In the cases of Embrace and D.light Design, the
teams ultimately started up their own companies.
D.light Design sells $lO to $25 solar-rechargeable LED
lights to the market of 1.6 billion people in the world reliant
on kerosene lighting. Former mechanical engineering stu
dent Erica Estrada M.S. 'O5 was a member of the founding
team, along with Sam Goldman MBA *O7, Ned Tozun MBA
'O7 and mechanical engineering graduate Xianyi Wu M.S.
'O6. Together, they founded D.light after graduation.
Estrada emphasized the revolutionary aspects of a com
pany like D.light, which she called "one of the only for-prof
it social enterprises."
"It represents a new approach to business by innovative
and sustainable social work not done
for solely monetary reasons," Estrada
said. "I think that's why Time calls us
'pioneers.'"
Embrace, on the other hand, sells
$25 incubators made from non-elec
tric heating units for premature
infants born in developing countries.
The core team consists of Jane Chen
MBA 'OB, MS&E graduate
Naganand Murty M.S. 'OB, Rahul
Panicker Ph.D. 'OB, computer science
graduate Linus Liang M.S. 'O9, bio
mechanical engineering graduate
Rajan Patel 'O9 and Elyse Marr 'll.
Marr, who is currently taking an

off-year to work full-time for
Embrace, described the incubator
design as "striking home the D
school philosophy of human-cen
tered design."
Having spent three weeks in
India at the start of the summer, she
described the personally moving and
rewarding experience of working
with respected female caretakers in
the community. Her motivation for
working for Embrace, she said,
stemmed from Embrace's focus on
the end-user.
"It's not just about the product,"
Marr said. "It's about alleviating
unnecessary pain for mothers. It's
about the people behind things.
That's our core mission."
Embrace team member Patel
agreed, although his part in the com
pany is centered on the technical

aspects of design. "It's a very fulfill
ing field to work in, but with health,
there's a lot of risk," Patel said. Patel
utilizes his bioengineering back
ground to develop a safe, intuitive
product for users who are often une
ducated.
Despite the difficulties, Patel
stressed the rewards of working with
the core team. "When I did an
internship with a medical device
company last year, I was working
nine to five and getting paid a lot
more; but around 2 p.m., I was
always like, 'When am I getting out
of here?'" Patel said. "Now, even if
it's 2 or 3 a.m., I'm excited to work
because of the people I'm surround
ed by."
Although Embrace and D.light
took final form as start-up compa
nies, Patell emphasized that that

many other students' designs were
successfully distributed through
their partners as well.
'"lTiat's what captures the press's
eye, especially in Silicon Valley:
start-ups," Patell said. He noted that
the projects not featured in Time
Magazine have collectively helped
many people as well.
A third featured company also
features Stanford graduates. Former
Stanford GSB graduates C. Hunter
801 l 'B4 and Jacqueline Novogratz
'9l sit on the Board of Directors of
Acumen Fund, a non-profit organi
zation that provides development
aid akin to venture capital to the
developing world, which was also
included in Time Magazine.
