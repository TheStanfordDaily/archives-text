Time Magazine recently featured two Stanford start-ups
on its list of "Responsibility Pioneers," which the magazine
believes represents global stewardship and ethical con
sumerism.
Both start-ups, Embrace and D.light Design, emerged
directly from the Graduate School of Business (GSB) course
"Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Affordability."
The course, which is in its seventh year, is taught by Profs.
Jim Patell and David Beach in conjunction with the Stanford
Institute of Design, also known as the'd.school."
Patell pinpointed some of the key aspects of the course
that allow it to cultivate successful entrepreneurs. "We
believe strongly in multidisciplinary teams," he said. "You've
got to produce a physical prototype, you've got to create a
business plan, you've got to demonstrate deep empathy."
According to Patell, over its history the course has had
students from 17 different departments. These students, as
well as faculty, have visited developing nations such as
Myanmar, Indonesia, India, Rwanda and Bangladesh to gain
a concrete understanding of what people in those countries
need most.
"You can't sit here in the West, and you can't sit here in
Palo Alto in front of a computer screen to do that," Patell
said.
Patell described the process of designing products to
meet developing nations' needs as beginning with eager
partners who present problems to solve and have the means
to solve them. The students design the product and work out
the logistics. In the cases of Embrace and D.light Design, the
teams ultimately started up their own companies.
D.light Design sells $lO to $25 solar-rechargeable LED
lights to the market of 1.6 billion people in the world reliant
on kerosene lighting. Former mechanical engineering stu
dent Erica Estrada M.S. 'O5 was a member of the founding
team, along with Sam Goldman MBA *O7, Ned Tozun MBA
'O7 and mechanical engineering graduate Xianyi Wu M.S.
'O6. Together, they founded D.light after graduation.
Estrada emphasized the revolutionary aspects of a com
pany like D.light, which she called "one of the only for-prof
it social enterprises."
"It represents a new approach to business by innovative
