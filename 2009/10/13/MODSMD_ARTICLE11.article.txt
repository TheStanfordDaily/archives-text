## Pilot public policy coterm begins New coterm program offers two tracks to accommodate all undergraduates 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
The Public Policy Program will be launching a pilot
coterminal M.A. program this academic year.
"We felt an increasing need from undergraduates say
ing, 'I want to get an M.P.P. [Masters in Public Policy] here
at Stanford,'" said Public Policy Program Administrator
Niki Calastas. "We thought, how can we build on that a lit
tle bit and continue to grow the program such that it's still
analytically rigorous and strong? Well, let's do a coterm."

"The idea behind the coterm is to increase Stanford
undergraduates going into public service careers,"
Calastas added. "Hopefully students should come out with
a firmer understanding of the way policy turns into law."
According to Public Policy Program Director Bruce
Owen, the public policy coterminal program was
approved by the Faculty Senate last spring.
"Right now, we're envisioning accepting 10 to 20 coter
minal students this first year," Calastas said. "It'll depend
on how many applications come through and the qualifi

cations of those students."
However, the program has not received any additional
funding for the coterminal program, which may limit the
number of applicants the program is able to accept.
"I think we are constrained resources-wise," Calastas
said. "We don't have a lot of extra funding and we don't
have a career placement service. We're relying on the
University for a lot of that."
The Public Policy Program is also not a traditional
department and does not have its own faculty.
"There are no plans to change that," Calastas said.
"That's something that's bigger than us and up to the
University."
"But there are benefits to being very small and multi
disciplinary," Calastas added. "We have an amazing pool
of faculty from other departments that we can draw
upon."
The coterminal program will have two different tracks;
one is designed for public policy majors who have already
completed the core coursework and prerequisites for the
major. Those students are encouraged to directly apply for
one of four concentrations: Health policy, environmental
and energy policy, legal and regulatory interventions, and
international policy studies.
The second track is for students
who have little public policy back
ground and designed so that students
must take 45 units of coursework
equivalent to the undergraduate
public policy major core.
"The second track will be easiest
for economics majors," Owen said.
"But we tried to design it so that any
student can do it as long as they've
thought about it and made schedul
ing arrangements."
Randy Zabaneh TO, an econom
ics major, agrees that the public poli
cy coterm program is very compati
ble with an economics undergradu
ate degree.
"The way I look at public policy,
it's applied economics," Zabaneh
said. "The background and frame
work that I have applies to a lot of
the courses in the public policy
coterm."
However, students who did not
major in economics or public policy
are also interested in the new pilot
program. Crystal Zheng 'lO, a double
major in East Asian studies and biol
ogy, is planning on applying to the
new coterm.
"I'm writing an honors thesis in
East Asian Studies that deals with a
lot of policy analysis," Zheng said. "I
realized that I don't have the quanti
tative research skills that I wanted,
and doing the coterm program
would help me gain that toolset."
If accepted, Students with an
undergraduate major in public policy
who will participate in the first track
are required to participate in a facul
ty-advised internship or a 10-unit
practicum an applied policy exer
cise where students work in small
groups for outside clients in different
areas of policy creation or implemen
tation.
"The practicum is very applied,
and not just theoretical and reading,"
Calastas said.
"In the practicum, students can
join with other graduate students to
potentially do a consulting job for
outside agencies, whether it be gov
ernment agencies, foundations or
NGOs," Owen added. "It will be a
six-month-long process, and at the
end they have to produce a report
that is satisfactory from the point of
view of academia and from the point
of view of the client."
Tim Ford 'lO, an undergraduate
majoring in public policy who is
applying to the coterm and who is
hoping to concentrate in legal and
regulatory interventions if accepted,
wants to participate in the program
for its practical applications.
"I really feel like a Master's
degree is necessary for the kind of
job that I want to do and really
makes a different in public policy,"
Ford said.
"It's cool because regulation
touches everything, especially now in
the post-financial crisis when we're
overhauling banking regulations,
overhauling health-care," Ford
added. "I think that earning a gradu
ate-level concentration in this field is
absolutely invaluable in the kind of
thing that I want to do later."
The fall application deadline for
the coterminal program is Nov. 13.
