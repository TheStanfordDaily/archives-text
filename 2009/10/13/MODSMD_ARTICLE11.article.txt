## Pilot public policy coterm begins New coterm program offers two tracks to accommodate all undergraduates 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
The Public Policy Program will be launching a pilot
coterminal M.A. program this academic year.
"We felt an increasing need from undergraduates say
ing, 'I want to get an M.P.P. [Masters in Public Policy] here
at Stanford,'" said Public Policy Program Administrator
Niki Calastas. "We thought, how can we build on that a lit
tle bit and continue to grow the program such that it's still
analytically rigorous and strong? Well, let's do a coterm."

"The idea behind the coterm is to increase Stanford
undergraduates going into public service careers,"
Calastas added. "Hopefully students should come out with
a firmer understanding of the way policy turns into law."
According to Public Policy Program Director Bruce
Owen, the public policy coterminal program was
approved by the Faculty Senate last spring.
"Right now, we're envisioning accepting 10 to 20 coter
minal students this first year," Calastas said. "It'll depend
on how many applications come through and the qualifi

cations of those students."
However, the program has not received any additional
funding for the coterminal program, which may limit the
number of applicants the program is able to accept.
"I think we are constrained resources-wise," Calastas
said. "We don't have a lot of extra funding and we don't
have a career placement service. We're relying on the
University for a lot of that."
The Public Policy Program is also not a traditional
department and does not have its own faculty.
"There are no plans to change that," Calastas said.
"That's something that's bigger than us and up to the
University."
"But there are benefits to being very small and multi
disciplinary," Calastas added. "We have an amazing pool
of faculty from other departments that we can draw
upon."
The coterminal program will have two different tracks;
one is designed for public policy majors who have already
completed the core coursework and prerequisites for the
major. Those students are encouraged to directly apply for
one of four concentrations: Health policy, environmental
and energy policy, legal and regulatory interventions, and
international policy studies.
