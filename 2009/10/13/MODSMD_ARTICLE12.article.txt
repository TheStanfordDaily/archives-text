## EDITORIAL Student activism essential to healthcare reform 
### 
Almost 90 percent of Stanford students
voted for Barack Obama. Like other
young people around the country, we
poured our hearts and souls into his election.
We held rallies, raised money, called voters
from swing-states and traveled around the
country to knock on their doors. We worked for
him with such overflowing enthusiasm that the
national media could not stop gushing about his
youth support.
On Nov. 4, when our efforts succeeded, we
celebrated. We partied, hollered and cried with
joy. We waxed poetic about the history being
made and saved the newspapers to commemo
rate it. We were proud of our nation for electing
Barack Obama, and proud of the fact that it re
quired the efforts of people just like us.
Well, with a piece of vital legislation on the
line, Barack Obama needs us now more than
ever. In the midst of this crucial moment of his
presidency, Obama has seen his healthcare bill
struggle against the tireless efforts of his oppo
sition. Despite the fact that a majority of Amer
icans support reform efforts, Rush Limbaugh,
Glenn Beck and the Tea Party Express have
somehow managed to dominate this conversa
tion. By shouting relentlessly about the nation
al debt and socialism and misleading Amer
icans with scary phrases like "death panels"
this political faction has steered the debate
away from the facts through sheer force of vol
ume and visibility.
But let there be no doubt: America must
pass this bill. And Stanford students must show
how strongly we believe so.
The facts of our nation's failing healthcare
system make it clear why President Obama
calls reform a "moral issue." The American
Journal of Public Health reports that 45,000
people die annually as a result of not having
health insurance, the equivalent of a 9/11 every
three weeks.These uninsured Americans would
actually be better off in prison, where convicted
felons are guaranteed health care. Instead, they
languish in sickness, unable to pay the exorbi
tant costs of insurance, until they are treated to
a few final, last-ditch attempts to save them in
taxpayer-funded emergency room visits. Not
only does this system fail to save lives, it does
not even save money.
By providing subsidies to low- and middle
income families, the current legislation would
raise the percentage of insured Americans
from 83 percent to 94 percent. While far from
perfect, this improvement would cover about
two-thirds of the 46 million currently unin

sured. Furthermore, by outlawing insurance
companies from charging higher premiums or
denying coverage to those with pre-existing
conditions, the insurance foundation for those
with coverage would be solidified.
But perhaps the most important aspect of
the most recent bill in the Senate, named for
Senator Max Baucus, is the efforts to control
costs. According to the Congressional Budget
Office, the Baucus bill will actually reduce the
deficit by $Bl billion over ten years, undercut
ting a main Republican criticism that we are
burdening future generations with the costs of
our action. What is, and will continue to be a bur
den, is the cost of our inaction.
That is where Stanford students must make
our voices heard. While the healthcare issue has
certainly had a presence on campus, particularly
in political organizations, the publicity has been
limited, and the focus on intellectual delibera
tion. To be sure, such conversation must take
place to further understandings and promote
discussion. What the Editorial Board would like
to see, however, is activism to supplement this di
alogue activism of the sort that draws peo
ple's attention and shows passionate dedication
to a cause.
This kind of activism was present in the
marches outside the White House this past
month, where protesters registered their oppo
sition to health reform. These people made
their voices heard. They have caused some
politicians to pause in their resolution, and
strengthened others in their resistance.
Stanford students must make themselves
the counterpart to these voices. A strong cam
paign in support of healthcare reform would
hardly be the first time we flexed our collective
muscles of activism, and it's difficult to imagine
a better time to do so. When Proposition 8 came
on the ballot in California, the political forces
on campus made their presence felt with a
force. Even those with only marginal interest
were pressured into mild forms of support.
It is difficult to imagine a more important
time to call on a similar campaign in favor of a
political achievement. We did not put all that ef
fort into electing Barack Obama to let him fail
with his first and most important effort for re
form. The Daily Californian, UC-Berkeley's
student newspaper, called on students to "sign
petitions, call our legislators and express our
views" as "vehement, vocal, and visible advo
cates." Stanford students must do the same.
Supporting healthcare reform is not enough; we
must show how much we care.
