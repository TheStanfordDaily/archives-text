# A 						BROAD ABROAD
## L'Oreal-Because You're Worth It 
### Molly Spaeth 
These past two summers, I worked with a
lady named Terri, a paralegal who also
used to work the makeup counter at
Estee Lauder. She told me a story about a mar
ried couple who had walked in one day, look
ing to get a makeover for the wife. As Terri
began painting the woman's eyelids, the hus
band kept up a steady stream of questions.
"Why do you put that there? What does that
brush do? So, is that the right color?" As the
makeover wore on, Terri began to get a little
annoyed by the man's persistent, almost-con
trolling manner in which he was allowing the
primping process to unfold. After Terri had fin
ished, the man took her to the side and apolo
gized for being so intrusive.
"I'm sorry if I was a little too involved while
you were working. It's just that my wife is going
blind, and I want to be able to learn how to do
her makeup. Although I think she's the most
beautiful woman in the world without make
up, I want to make sure that she can still feel
beautiful."
Commence the waterworks. (Men, take
note).
But in all seriousness, I would like to make a
point in hopes of educating all the men in The
Daily's readership on yet another perspective of
their all-too-long list of Things Men Just Don't
Understand: The Power of Feeling Pretty.
It is important to note that, like the man at
the Estee Lauder counter noted, being pretty
and feeling pretty are two extremely different
entities. And for those who don't easily under
stand the nuances separating the two (cough,
all men cough), it may be very easy to confuse
the interplay between confidence, insecurity
and the power of a woman's sexuality.
I've seen two sides of the male argument. A
good friend of mine consistently berates me
for putting on makeup. "Why are you doing
that?! Makeup is gross, you don't need to do
that." Another, yet still very dear, friend of
mine has asked me more than once on days I
haven't have time for blush, "Hey Molly, you
feeling alright? You look a little ill."
Critics of makeup, the beauty trade and
even stilettos for that matter have argued that
the industry was created and exists solely to
provide men with yet another source of mas
turbatory pleasure while simultaneously re
signing women to an inherently inferior sec
tion of society. You want to please the other
half? Well, then you better paint your face.

They wish.
When I add a little more gold eye shadow to
my arch, it's because sometimes I like to pre
tend that it is fairy dust. When I wear red lip
stick, it's because it makes me feel like a suc
cessful journalist, like Mary Tyler Moore. And
when I curl my hair, it's because sometimes I
like to feel like a mermaid. It may be trivial,
you may think it's stupid, and I'll admit there
probably will always be a part of me that is an
8 year-old-girl, but I can tell you with just as
much confidence that when I put on makeup in
the morning it is for me, and not for anyone
else.
I went to a high school dance one time in a
group of friends that included a girl I didn't re
ally know that well. I asked her if she wanted to
come over and curl our hair and put on make
up before the dance. She looked at me with dis
dain and responded,"Oh. I don't really do those
kinds of things. I'd rather read a book or watch
the news than play around with makeup."
0.K., I like mascara. But that doesn't mean
I'm dumb. On the contrary, I'll wave my Dior
wand around my lashes in the morning and
five minutes later we can talk about Berlus
coni's ethical dilemmas and if you catch me
on a good day, I can do them simultaneously.
Makeup is something I enjoy doing, it's some
thing that makes me feel pretty, but it doesn't
define who I am. Spending hours pawning
through the Bobbi Brown collection in Nord
strom doesn't make me insecure; it means I
have a hobby.
Hell, feminism isn't perfect. Equal rights in
the workforce may not fully exist yet, and there
are men who still think they can tell me what I
can do with my own body, but I at least find sol
ace in the fact that the intrinsic confidence of
feeling beautiful and the part of me that will al
ways be an 8-year-old girl playing "Pretty, Pret
ty Princess" is a source that no man can ever
touch.
And as far as glass ceilings go, give me a job
in your company and in two years I'll be
smashing that ceiling to pieces with my five
inch stilettos.

Molly is currently practicing a new makeup tech
nique called "The Smokey-Eyed Unicorn." If
you'd care to join in on the primping process or
discuss MAC's Christmas pigments, email
mspaeth@stanford.edu and she'll see if she can
tear herself away from the silver eye shadow.
