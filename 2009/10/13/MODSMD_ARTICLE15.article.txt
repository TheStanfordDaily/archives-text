# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## The
						depressing truth of elite students 
### Danny Crichton 
Last week's hubbub over the Nobel
Peace Prize selection nearly shrouded a
far more riveting story concerning the
Nobel Prize in Physics. The award this year
was given to three scientists for their research
into CCD sensors, the device that underlies
most digital cameras.
Two of the three researchers who made
the discovery worked at Bell Labs, one of the
premier basic research institutions in the
country or at least it was. The storied histo
ry of the labs, including its now seven Nobel
Prize wins, ended last year when parent com
pany Alcatel-Lucent decided to shut them
down.
The story of Bell Labs is a truly American
one about the technological greatness of the
past discarded in the drive for profit. Unfortu
nately, one needs to look no further than the
aspirations of Stanford students to see that
this disappointing trend will not be disap
pearing.
Ask graduates (or even prospective fresh
men) about their dream job, and a depressing
truth becomes evident: The most desired po
sitions are in finance and management con
sulting. Even in the wake of the largest eco
nomic meltdown in decades, students throng
for industries that advise, rather than create.
The hard numbers are difficult to refute at
peer institutions as well. At Princeton, 60 per
cent of graduates who find full-time employ
ment will go into these industries. At MIT, 40
percent do the same, although neither num
ber accounts for those students who pursue
higher degrees before entering these indus
tries.
Bill Gates recognized the allure of these
industries, and attempted to draw a wider
cross-section of America into science and
technology through scholarship grants. Yet,
many of those at Stanford receiving grants
are giving up 10-year fellowships in order to
major in fields more relevant to finance and
consulting.
What do these companies do that is so at
tractive to such a large number of students?
Bain & Company, a leading management
consulting firm, puts it this way: "We look at a
business as an integrated, cohesive whole.
Bain helps companies find where to make
their money, make more of it faster and sus-

tain its growth longer." Other firms state the
same mission in similar terms.
The most brilliant students no longer at
tempt to solve basic science, technology or
even political problems. Today, they want to
work for firms whose goal is to make as much
profit in the shortest time as possible. Increas
ing profit is certainly important, but not at the
expense of a company's long-term potential.
When we look back at Bell Labs, we see
this kind of decision-making in a microcosm.
Basic science research is not immediately
profitable, and thus does not fit into the equa
tions that these consulting firms provide.
From an Alcatel-Lucent spokesman quoted
in Wired magazine, "In the new innovation
model, research needs to keep addressing the
need of the mother company." Of course, ex
panding the company into new and unexpect
ed industries is probably asking for too much.
America is in for a rough future if this kind
of shortsightedness continues. Siegfried

Hecker was director of Los Alamos National
Laboratory, and was recently bestowed the
prestigious Enrico Fermi award. He related
an anecdote about meeting some students in
India while attending a conference. The stu
dents repeatedly asked for his autograph, ex
cited to see such an accomplished scientist.
The difference in mentality between our two
countries is palpable.
I do not blame students for choosing the
nicer of these divergent paths. Look at the in
centives: There is better pay, more varied
work and, to a certain degree, better job secu
rity in consulting. Earning a Ph.D. in science is
not the measure of success it once was. Train
ing is poor and support is difficult to find, not
to mention that the time to earn a degree con
tinues to increase. After graduation, there are
few avenues to pursue research as the num
ber of basic science laboratories falls. In short,
there are almost no incentives for high
achieving students to consider the basic sci
ences.
To solve these problems, two fundamental
problems need to be solved. The first is the
compensation of scientists and engineers in
corporate America. Respect for the individu
als actually innovating and producing the
products is paramount. Action may need to
come from Washington in the form of incen
tives, but I believe a far stronger approach
should focus on changing the mentality of the
top management professionals.
The second approach must center on low
ering the barriers blocking a science educa
tion in this country. President Obama has pro
posed significantly increasing the number of
NSF fellowships, one of the most important
fellowships for graduate study. He should also
advocate for better science training and men
toring.
Bell Labs was one of the few bastions of
basic research left in the corporate world.
Winning another Nobel is merely an elegy to
that forgotten era. Today, the focus must be
returning America's best to the source of
America's power: science and engineering.

Danny Crichton remains in disbelief that
AT&T once invented the transistor and the laser
when they cannot provide a cell signal at Stan
ford. Email him at dancric@stanford.edu.

The focus must be
returning America s
best to the source of its
power: science and
engineering.
