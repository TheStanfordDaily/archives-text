## Prejean argues against capital punishment 
### LAURA STAMPLER 
Death penalty abolitionist Sister Helen
Prejean spoke to a full room of students and
community members to discuss her intimate
experiences with death row inmates, the fami
lies of victims of violence and her personal
odyssey in advocating against capital punish
ment.
Issues regarding the death penalty have
made it to the forefront of national news over
the past few weeks, as investigations examine
whether Todd Willingham was wrongfully exe
cuted for the murder of his daughters in Texas
in 2004, which would make him the first
American to be proven innocent beyond a rea
sonable doubt after capital punishment.
The State of Ohio's botched first attempt to
execute Romell Broom he has been given a
one-week reprieve after 18 failed efforts to
find a vein for lethal injection has also
received national coverage. Prejean has recent
ly been in contact with Broom's attorney to
discuss the case.
"California, you are interesting ... in a bad
way," Prejean, a self-proclaimed "nun with atti
tude," said to her audience last night at Koret
Pavilion.
With over 600 Californians on death row
and only 16 executed since 1976, Prejean ques-

tioned whether capital convictions are fueled
by political ambition, and discussed the neces
sity of student activism.
"Public opinion changed things in New
Mexico and New Jersey, and it can happen in
California, too" Prejean said.
Prejean also discussed prison reforms, youth
offenders over 2,000 minors are serving life
sentences without parole in adult prisons
and the racial issues that surround capital con
victions. For example, 90 percent of death row
inmates in Georgia are men of color.
Prejean wrote the Pulitzer Prize-nominated
novel Dead Man Walking, which chronicled
her relationship with the guilty Patrick Sonnier
in the two and a half years leading up to his
execution. The novel was adapted into an
Academy Award-winning film by Tim Robbins
in which Prejean was played by Susan
Sarandon.
Prejean predominantly focused on her
experience with Sonnier and her struggle with
reconciling his crime with what she believes to
be a violation of his human rights. Tears came
to her eyes when she described the moments
before Sonnier's execution, but she perse
vered.

"I was a witness, and I have to tell the story,"
she said.
In total, Prejean has bore witness to six exe-

cutions.
Prejean receives hate mail from ideological
opponents and has found considerable opposi
tion from the religious community that is dis
pleased with her taking the role of spiritual
advisor to the guilty.
"You should see, I keep a file that I call
'ardent foes,' and I get the best stuff," Prejean
told The Daily. "You've got to go back to teach
ing children. Go dress in a habit and say your
prayers. Stay the hell away from politics. Great
stuff, I mean they're eloquent."
Prejean also noted students' unique oppor
tunity to be advocates in their own society.
"You are here at Stanford," Prejean said.
"Do you know someone would give their eye
and tooth to be here? But why have we given
that? Is it for ourselves? We can use our ener
gies, we can extend our lives for justice. And
isn't that a great way to spend a life?"
One audience member appreciated
Prejean's call to action.
"Listening to her speak inspires to action,"
said Olivia Haas 'll. "And I like how she said
that it doesn't matter how you get involved, but
that you get involved with something in some
way."
