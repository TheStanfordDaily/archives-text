## Filmmaker, prof. spat over film rights 
### JENNIFER LEE 
A documentary filmmaker has
found himself on the losing end of a
dispute with Stanford, and has
accused the University of academic
censorship.
In a documentary warning of the
dangers of environmental extrem
ism, entitled "Not Evil, Just Stupid,"
filmmaker Phelim McAleer inter
viewed civil and environmental
engineering Prof. Stephen
Schneider, but was told afterwards
that he was prohibited from using
the footage.
According to regulations set
forth by the office of University
Communications, all requests to
take footage on the Stanford cam
pus must be approved in advance,
which McAleer failed to do. In addi
tion, Schneider only signed one of
two release forms, giving permission
for his interview, but no rights to
film on campus.
Consequently, all on-campus
filming, both outside and inside
Stanford buildings, was not legally
permitted to be shown in the docu
mentary, which included the footage
of the interview. In the documen
tary, the interview has been replaced
with a blank screen with an audio
clip of the actor reading the tran
script of the interview.
Schneider argued that the under
lying reason he pulled the interview
was because his viewpoints were
misrepresented and the filmmakers
manipulated his viewpoint. He stat
ed that the clips used in the eventu
al documentary were also taken out
of context, offering only two lines
from the entire interview, and juxta
posing a single statement that he
was previously concerned about
global cooling with a later statement
that he is now confident in global
warming.
McAleer, however, stated that
the University took action to legally
prohibit the interview in order to
protect the reputation of a Stanford
professor. He had questioned

Schneider's professionalism in the
interview. McAleer also claimed
that Schneider's current support for
the theory of global warming con
tradicts his previous statements
from the 1970s that the ice age was
imminent.

He felt that because he pointed
out Schneider's change in view, the
interview was pulled.
"I thought that's what universi
ties were for, for people to be asking
difficult questions, challenging your
professor and rethinking how the
world is," McAleer said. "The mes
sage [of the ban] is if your child is
going there or if you're going there,
be careful not to ask your professors
difficult or embarrassing questions
about their beliefs or you'll find that
the full width of the university will
come down on you."
"Maybe Stanford should spend
their money hiring professors will
ing to stand over their previous sci
entific pronouncements," McAleer
added.

According to Associate Director
of University Communications Kate
Chesley, Schneider did not have the
interview banned because of embar
rassing or difficult questions, but
rather because of dishonest film
making.
"Essentially, Prof. Schneider
asked our office to help him extri
cate himself from a documentary for
which he had been interviewed,"
Chesley said. "He felt that the film
makers had not fairly represented
their intent, and when that intent
became clear, he didn't want to par
ticipate in their project."
Schneider stated during the inter
view that McAleer challenged him
on A1 Gore's statement that 1998
was the warmest year on record in
his documentary, "An Inconvenient
Truth." McAleer repeatedly ques
tioned whether Gore used this fact
as proof of global warming, which
Schneider denied several times.
Schneider described the inter
