## Quizz Rodgers exploits Card's defensive flaws 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Since his first season on the Farm in 2007,
coach Jim Flarbaugh has emphasized his mis
sion of turning Stanford into one of the top pro
grams not only in the conference, but in the na
tion. He may already be on his way to accom
plishing the first goal, but one thing is for certain
in the coming weeks, and even years for that
matter: The Card will have to learn to play its
best on the road.
Regardless of the official outcome, Stanford's
three best performances of the season so far have
all been at home. This is something to be expect
ed of course home field advantage is crucial in
any sport, especially one like college football,

where there's plenty of pride at stake. But the un
settling tidbit in all of this is the size of the gap be
tween the Cardinal's performances at home and
on the road.
Stanford started the season off with a win
against lowly Washington State, 39-13, that
looked a lot bigger than it was. Although the Card
was in control most of the game, Cougars tailback
Dwight Tardy still exposed the Stanford defense
and if it weren't for a few big plays from Chris
Owusu and Richard Sherman, the margin would
have been noticeably slimmer. And lest we forget
the heartbreaking loss at Wake Forest, when
Stanford was unable to put up a single point in
the game's final 30 minutes.
Good teams win at home, but better teams
win on the road. Last Saturday's game against the
Beavers showed us that while Stanford may be
on the brink of being a top-25 team and a Pac-10
contender, the team just isn't there yet.
However, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
Redshirt freshman Andrew Luck still has three
more years to hopefully cement himself among

the likes of Plunkett and Elway (but with a
much cooler name), while sophomore Chris
Owusu has plenty of time to leave defenders on
their feet. For the time being though, it looks
like the two are still in need of more experience
before Harbaugh's dream of a football power is
realized.
After having the best collegiate game of his
career against UCLA, Luck led a stagnant Cardi
nal offense that couldn't get anything going until
the game was already out of reach.
"I just wasn't getting in rhythm and wasn't
getting in stride and delivering the ball," Luck
said after the game. "I'm very disappointed."
The Cardinal could ask nothing more of
Owusu in terms of production this year, but his
drop of a sure touchdown pass on the first play of
the game is something that hopefully won't hap
pen a year or two down the road, especially in
less-than-hospitable environments like the one
at the Beavers' Reser Stadium.
That said, fans shouldn't chalk up
Saturday's loss to inexperience. The
Cardinal defense was beaten and
bruised by the 5-foot-7 Jacquizz
Rodgers all day long. Rodgers
showed that if the Cardinal is going to
get the respect it wants players
and coaches believed that the team
deserved to be in the top 25 in the pre
ceding weeks it's going to have to
learn to show up on both sides of the
ball, regardless of where it's playing.
Every week presents a new chal
lenge, however, and every challenge
offers a chance to make things better.
The Cardinal will have a chance to re
fine its road skills this week when it
takes on another middling Pac-10 op
ponent in the Arizona Wildcats.
If the Wildcats were coming to
Stanford Stadium, it'd probably be an
other offensive showcase, with the
Cardinal outclassing its opponent with
Toby Gerhart and a little bit of Luck.
On the road though? Anything goes.
Stanford could win by a touchdown or
lose by three.
