# Job recruiting still tough
## Seniors must be persistent to secure job 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seniors are looking to enter the job market, but
the economy doesn't look like it's making much
room for them.
In a year filled with news of dismal unemploy
ment rates and companies facing tough times,
Stanford students, especially those interested in
finance, consulting and business, are feeling some
of the crunch.
The job market doesn't appear to be recovering
after a poor year in 2008-09. Last year saw a 25
percent drop in job postings at the CDC, which led
many graduating students to frantically scramble
to apply to those few jobs available or else consid
er graduate school.
"I felt like last year was really bad," said Tiffany
Lin 'lO, a management science & engineering
major interested in entering the business or
finance worlds.
Bev Principal, assistant director of the Career
Development Center (CDC), noted a large degree

of panic among job-searching seniors. The anxiety
especially affected those interested in business and
finance, but Principal said that this year's graduating
students expect the tough times and are better pre
pared.
"Last year, we saw a panic because all of a sud
den [the banks] took a dive. There was a lot more
panic because there wasn't as much time to
reflect," Principal said. "This year, I don't really see
a panic."
In response to the experiences of last year, stu
dents are wary of job shortages and competition
for positions. Principal said this has manifested in
students striving to be ready for the application
process.
"There is a strong desire to be 110 percent pre
pared," she said, citing high attendance at resume
critique sessions and other workshops.
Seniors do express concern about the market
and feel that many of their classmates are also
worried.

With the unemployment rate still high and economic recovery sluggish, recruiting will once again prove difficult for graduating seniors.
This year's Fall Career Fair saw a 28 percent drop from last year's fair (above) in the number of companies that came to recruit.
"People definitely are worried,"
said David Tran 'lO, a computer sci
ence major who is co-terming next
year, speaking about his friends'
experiences.

"It's definitely stressful. I hate
recruiting," Lin said
However, this feeling is not just an
unfounded theme across campus. Last
year, the fall career fair had a record
300 companies sign up. (Since
recruiters sign up to particulate in fall
recruiting in the summer, the drop-off
in recruiters did not occur until winter
quarter.) This year, the interest in the
fall career fair dropped to 217, a 28
percent decrease.
Companies are wary of hiring too
many people this year in order to limit
costs, especially in the financial sector.
Kevin Lin 'lO is an economics major
who already has a job offer from his
previous summer internship in
finance. However, he is still participat
ing in recruiting.
He said companies in finance and
business are looking for the same
qualified applicants, but have to limit
their hiring class and are being cau
tious.
"[Businesses] are actually looking
for the same kinds of people, but they
are unsure of what class size they need
... they don't know about deal flow,"
he said, referring to the term for the
amount of business a consulting firm
or investment bank is getting. "The
goal this year is to set yourself apart so

that companies are willing to take you
on even with the excess capacity [of
applicants]."
Principal is finding that students
especially worry about the shortage of
spots and higher competition for the
finance jobs.
"The number-one concern is that
the company has fewer jobs," she said.
"The competition is probably a lot
higher ... people feel competitive
with their Stanford peers. They're
thinking 'Oh, shoot, we've all got 4.05,
what am I going to do?"'
Even beyond getting the job,
Tiffany Lin felt that many people are
also worried about their future career
prospects in the business world
beyond the entry-level position.
"My office [last summer] was pret
ty slow; there wasn't a lot of deal flow,"
she said. "What will my future be, what
will my career be, is there a lot of
potential there?"
"I try to assure seniors that they
will get a job," Principal added. "When
economic traditions change, flexibility
becomes key. You will find something.
Your first job doesn't determine the
rest of your life."
In addition, Jim Frizzel, events
coordinator for career fairs at the
CDC, said companies are offering
many more internships in order to
lower costs. That is great news for
underclassmen and juniors, but not for
anyone wanting to enter the job mar
ket.
"There are a lot of internships,
which is good, but not good if you're
graduating and looking for a job," he
said. "Companies are using [intern
ships] more as a trial. A lot more com
panies are offering actual jobs at the

end of internships."
However, this applies largely to the
finance and business sector. Other
areas are not being so strongly affect
ed, especially the still-hiring technolo
gy sector.
"It depends a lot on your major,"
Tran said. "I'm a CS major, so most of
my friends aren't having any trouble
finding employers."
Principal confirmed that technolo
gy companies are still very much inter
ested in Stanford engineers and com
puter scientists. Over 20 companies
have already signed up for the School
of Engineering's Opportunity Job Fair
when sign-ups just opened last week.
"Tech companies don't want to
lose the entry-level pipeline,"
Principal said. "If they have to hire
that talent at mid-level positions, it's
going to cost them more. Companies
are more successful at developing
[entry-level hires]."
With the tech market doing well,
the energy-oriented career fair occur
ring yesterday in Tresidder was
bustling. Masters, Ph.D. candidates
and undergraduate students browsed
tables ranging from solar start-ups to
Chevron and Exxon Mobil. Most stu
dents went in business casual attire,
resumes in hand and ready to net
work.
"Since the job market is a little bit
harder, you need to bulk up more,
stand out more, have more creden
tials," Tiffany Lin said. "I'm opti
mistic, though, that in the end I'll be
doing something I'm interested in,
even if it's less conventional."

Seniors are looking to enter the job market, but
the economy doesn't look like it's making much
room for them.
In a year filled with news of dismal unemploy
ment rates and companies facing tough times,
Stanford students, especially those interested in
finance, consulting and business, are feeling some
of the crunch.
The job market doesn't appear to be recovering
after a poor year in 2008-09. Last year saw a 25
percent drop in job postings at the CDC, which led
many graduating students to frantically scramble
to apply to those few jobs available or else consid
er graduate school.
"I felt like last year was really bad," said Tiffany
Lin 'lO, a management science & engineering
major interested in entering the business or
finance worlds.
Bev Principal, assistant director of the Career
Development Center (CDC), noted a large degree

of panic among job-searching seniors. The anxiety
especially affected those interested in business and
finance, but Principal said that this year's graduating
students expect the tough times and are better pre
pared.
"Last year, we saw a panic because all of a sud
den [the banks] took a dive. There was a lot more
panic because there wasn't as much time to
reflect," Principal said. "This year, I don't really see
a panic."
In response to the experiences of last year, stu
dents are wary of job shortages and competition
for positions. Principal said this has manifested in
students striving to be ready for the application
process.
"There is a strong desire to be 110 percent pre
pared," she said, citing high attendance at resume
critique sessions and other workshops.
Seniors do express concern about the market
and feel that many of their classmates are also
worried.

With the unemployment rate still high and economic recovery sluggish, recruiting will once again prove difficult for graduating seniors.
This year's Fall Career Fair saw a 28 percent drop from last year's fair (above) in the number of companies that came to recruit.
"People definitely are worried,"
said David Tran 'lO, a computer sci
ence major who is co-terming next
year, speaking about his friends'
experiences.

"It's definitely stressful. I hate
recruiting," Lin said
However, this feeling is not just an
unfounded theme across campus. Last
year, the fall career fair had a record
300 companies sign up. (Since
recruiters sign up to particulate in fall
recruiting in the summer, the drop-off
in recruiters did not occur until winter
quarter.) This year, the interest in the
fall career fair dropped to 217, a 28
percent decrease.
Companies are wary of hiring too
many people this year in order to limit
costs, especially in the financial sector.
Kevin Lin 'lO is an economics major
who already has a job offer from his
previous summer internship in
finance. However, he is still participat
ing in recruiting.
He said companies in finance and
business are looking for the same
qualified applicants, but have to limit
their hiring class and are being cau
tious.
"[Businesses] are actually looking
for the same kinds of people, but they
are unsure of what class size they need
... they don't know about deal flow,"
he said, referring to the term for the
amount of business a consulting firm
or investment bank is getting. "The
goal this year is to set yourself apart so

that companies are willing to take you
on even with the excess capacity [of
applicants]."
Principal is finding that students
especially worry about the shortage of
spots and higher competition for the
finance jobs.
"The number-one concern is that
the company has fewer jobs," she said.
"The competition is probably a lot
higher ... people feel competitive
with their Stanford peers. They're
thinking 'Oh, shoot, we've all got 4.05,
what am I going to do?"'
Even beyond getting the job,
Tiffany Lin felt that many people are
also worried about their future career
prospects in the business world
beyond the entry-level position.
"My office [last summer] was pret
ty slow; there wasn't a lot of deal flow,"
she said. "What will my future be, what
will my career be, is there a lot of
potential there?"
"I try to assure seniors that they
will get a job," Principal added. "When
economic traditions change, flexibility
becomes key. You will find something.
Your first job doesn't determine the
rest of your life."
In addition, Jim Frizzel, events
coordinator for career fairs at the
CDC, said companies are offering
many more internships in order to
lower costs. That is great news for
underclassmen and juniors, but not for
anyone wanting to enter the job mar
ket.
"There are a lot of internships,
which is good, but not good if you're
graduating and looking for a job," he
said. "Companies are using [intern
ships] more as a trial. A lot more com
panies are offering actual jobs at the

end of internships."
However, this applies largely to the
finance and business sector. Other
areas are not being so strongly affect
ed, especially the still-hiring technolo
gy sector.
"It depends a lot on your major,"
Tran said. "I'm a CS major, so most of
my friends aren't having any trouble
finding employers."
Principal confirmed that technolo
gy companies are still very much inter
ested in Stanford engineers and com
puter scientists. Over 20 companies
have already signed up for the School
of Engineering's Opportunity Job Fair
when sign-ups just opened last week.
"Tech companies don't want to
lose the entry-level pipeline,"
Principal said. "If they have to hire
that talent at mid-level positions, it's
going to cost them more. Companies
are more successful at developing
[entry-level hires]."
