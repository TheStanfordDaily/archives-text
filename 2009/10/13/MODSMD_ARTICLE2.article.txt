# Job recruiting still tough
## Seniors must be persistent to secure job 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Seniors are looking to enter the job market, but
the economy doesn't look like it's making much
room for them.
In a year filled with news of dismal unemploy
ment rates and companies facing tough times,
Stanford students, especially those interested in
finance, consulting and business, are feeling some
of the crunch.
The job market doesn't appear to be recovering
after a poor year in 2008-09. Last year saw a 25
percent drop in job postings at the CDC, which led
many graduating students to frantically scramble
to apply to those few jobs available or else consid
er graduate school.
"I felt like last year was really bad," said Tiffany
Lin 'lO, a management science & engineering
major interested in entering the business or
finance worlds.
Bev Principal, assistant director of the Career
Development Center (CDC), noted a large degree

of panic among job-searching seniors. The anxiety
especially affected those interested in business and
finance, but Principal said that this year's graduating
students expect the tough times and are better pre
pared.
"Last year, we saw a panic because all of a sud
den [the banks] took a dive. There was a lot more
panic because there wasn't as much time to
reflect," Principal said. "This year, I don't really see
a panic."
In response to the experiences of last year, stu
dents are wary of job shortages and competition
for positions. Principal said this has manifested in
students striving to be ready for the application
process.
"There is a strong desire to be 110 percent pre
pared," she said, citing high attendance at resume
critique sessions and other workshops.
Seniors do express concern about the market
and feel that many of their classmates are also
worried.

With the unemployment rate still high and economic recovery sluggish, recruiting will once again prove difficult for graduating seniors.
This year's Fall Career Fair saw a 28 percent drop from last year's fair (above) in the number of companies that came to recruit.
