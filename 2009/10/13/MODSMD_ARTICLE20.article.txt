# CYCLES OF SUCCESS
## Club cycling makes top cyclists from all talent levels 
### KABIR SAWHNEY 
It's no secret that Stanford loves bik
ing. Most students own a bike
even if they sometimes are of ques
tionable quality and the average
student will spend much of his or her
time biking around campus. It seems
odd, then, that Stanford's own cycling
team has such a low profile on campus,
especially considering its long track
record of success.
The team is split into mountain bike
and road teams, which compete in the
fall and spring, respectively. The moun
tain team, which is now in the middle of
its schedule, is sending three racers to
the national championships this week
end. The road team has been even more
successful: It won the Western Colle
giate Cycling Conference (WCCC) last
year and the Road Nationals in 2007.
Keith Wong, president of Stanford
Cycling, noted that this is not a rare feat
for the club's teams, given Stanford's
strength as both an individual and a
team unit.
"We've sent riders to both nationals
in recent years," he said. "To qualify, you
have to be an 'A' rider, [and] riders can
qualify on either an individual or a team
basis. As an individual, if you have a cer
tain number of points, you get a certain
ranking and then you qualify. If your
team has a high enough standing, then
you get a certain number of spots. For
example, our team just qualified for
mountain bike nationals, so we get four
spots."
Wong also discussed the structure of
the team, emphasizing the diversity and
variety of skill levels that give Stanford
Cycling such depth.
"[Stanford cycling] is for a wide
range of athletes," Wong said. "You get
everything from beginners to ... pros
competing. It's sort of like a develop
ment program for the entire USA Cy
cling system."
Stanford cyclists compete primarily
within the WCCC, which includes
schools from California and western
Nevada. During the season, the team
competes at a different venue almost
every weekend. In fact, Stanford Cycling
just hosted its own mountain biking
event this past weekend. However, ac
cording to Wong, the teams and racers

against whom Stanford Cycling compete
stays consistent each week, since every
team is invited to all conference events.
Stanford Cycling's perennial prob
lem has been recruitment. Due to the
team's relatively low visibility on cam
pus, it can be difficult to recruit new rid
ers to the team.
"It's hard because cycling tends to be
really expensive," said Eric Lau, captain
of the mountain bike team. "A common
question we get is, 'How much does it
cost to get into biking?' A good moun
tain bike will cost you around $3OO plus
the gear you need. We have team bikes
that we lend out to beginning racers.
They can have them for a few weeks and
if they like it, they'll return the team
bike and buy one of their own."
Lau also said that the current goal of
the mountain team is to get more people
to come out for the team, since "colle
giate racing depends on getting a lot of
people out to race."
For now, Lau is focusing on the
mountain team's current season. His
team is shooting for a top-five finish in
the WCCC. Lau himself has been very
successful he currently is second in
the individual standings for the confer
ence and has had top-three finishes all
season.
Lau added that the club has a fairly
extensive alumni network of fans and is
looking to expand its base among Stan
ford students.
"We really encourage people to just
come out and try a bike," Lau said. "We
have team bikes for a reason ... The
team is really cool, just a bunch of laid
back riders who enjoy cruising through
the redwoods and up the coast."
Wong similarly expressed the hope
that more riders would join Stanford
Cycling.
"It isn't all about racing," he said.
"There are quite a few people who like
to ride for fun, recreation or fitness. We
try to encourage those people to come
out; it's always fun to ride with other
people. There are also other benefits to
becoming a member, like getting dis
counts from our sponsors."
