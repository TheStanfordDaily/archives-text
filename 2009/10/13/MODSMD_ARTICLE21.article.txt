# Unexpected, but not underdogs
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
Everyone who picked the
Dodgers to sweep the Cardi
nals, raise your hand. Every
one who picked the Angels
to sweep the Red Sox, raise your
hand.

Now, while you might notice that
there are fewer hands in the air now
than at your last IHUM section,
think about what that means: Both
the Angels and Dodgers had better
records than their opponents, and
therefore had home field advantage.
Yet a grand total of zero of 15 base
ball experts on ESPN, Yahoo! and
Fox Sports picked either team to
sweep. In fact, only three picked the
Dodgers to win and five picked the
Angels to win.

Now, I didn't say all this just to say
"I told you so" okay, maybe just a
little bit. I didn't pick a sweep either
and I picked the Dodgers to get
swept, so I'm as bad as anyone else
for that.

I underestimated the clutch hit
ting of the Dodgers, which I had seen
firsthand throughout the year, but
did not picture carrying on into the
playoffs. I also clearly overestimated
the pitching staff for the Cardinals,
which appeared to be dominant with
two Cy Young candidates. But, it was

the seemingly inconsistent trio of
Randy Wolf, Clayton Kershaw and
the now-swine-flu-free Vicente
Padilla that dazzled, shutting down
the Cardinal offense.

The Dodgers clearly showed they
are the better team, winning easily in
two of the three games and taking
complete advantage of one of the
worst gaffes in playoff history. Ok,
so it's not Buckner version 2.0, but
Matt Holliday let a routine fly ball
go right past his glove and bank off
his family jewels for a two-base
error. And that pretty much killed
the series for the Cardinals. So, not
one of my finest picks, but hey, at
least I got the sweep part down
it's the same logic as the poker
players who risk their money with a
2-7. "At least it's suited."

I can say with complete pride,
though, that I told people how good
the Angels would be, and I got
nothing but scorn and "Well, I don't
know ..." from just about every
one.

But, I still did what most sports
fans can only dream about I un
derestimated my favorite team. I
thought the Angels could beat the
Red Sox, but I thought they would
at least drop a game. I looked to be
correct, until the little guys in the
Angels lineup decided to chip away
at the "unbeatable" Jonathan Pa
pelbon, providing one of the most
remarkable and dramatic come
from-behind victories in playoff
history, and doing it against the for
mer kings of the comeback, the
Sox.

Before the heroic Game Three,
the Angels dominated the Red Sox,
even more than the vaunted Yan
kees dominated the happy-to-be
there Twins. In the first two games,
facing two of the premier pitchers
in the league in Jon Lester and Josh
Beckett, the Angels scored more
runs (nine) than the Red Sox had
hits (eight).
And let's not forget what the ex
perts said: One expert said the only
chance the Angels had to win the
series was for Chone Figgins to get
on base and steal several times per
game. Figgins's batting line for the
series? 0-12. With zero stolen bases.
Several experts said the Angels

couldn't hang with the Red Sox be
cause the Angels' bullpen was too
shaky, and the Red Sox had a deep
er, stronger bullpen. Yet the An
gels' bullpen gave up one run in six
and a third innings, while the Red
Sox gave up seven runs from the
bullpen, which is the same number
of runs that their offense scored in
the entire series.

Shows you what expert analysis
gets you. So why was everyone so
wrong about these two SoCal
teams? Could it be East Coast bias?
Seems reasonable, especially con
sidering half the remaining teams
are within 45 minutes of each other
on the 405 Freeway, which is as far
from Bristol, Conn, as just about
anywhere else in the country.
Really, though, it's time for peo
ple from all parts of the globe to
take notice of these two teams. The
fact that they had two of the three
best records in the majors this year
was no coincidence. But we'll give
the so-called experts a pass for not
giving the Angels and Dodgers cred
it they've still got another chance.
Which is more than you can say
for the Cardinals or Red Sox.

Jacob Jaffe managed to get an "East
Coast bias " jab in unnecessarily. Ask
him if he's tight with Lute Olson atjw
