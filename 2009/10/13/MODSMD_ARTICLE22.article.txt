# Card trumps Tigers to lead NorPac
## 
### ALISSA HABER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 13 Stanford women's field hockey
team (11-2, 3-1 NorPac) continued to add on to
its impressive win total, and in the process en
sured its place on top of the NorPac Conference.
With its 3-0 win over league opponent Pacific
(3-7, 2-2 NorPac) on Sunday, the Cardinal now
stands alone atop of the West Division of the
NorPac. The season sweep over the Tigers also
marked the fourth shutout of the year for Stan
ford. The Cardinal improved its league record to
3-1, while the Tigers fall to 2-2 in conference play.
Although Stanford out-shot Pacific 11-0 in
the first half, the Card was not able to score a goal
until the 37th minute, when freshman Becky Dru
scored on a penalty corner.
When asked about the lack of offense in the
first half, senior Midori Uehara noted the diffi
culties in finishing early on, especially given field
playing conditions.
"We created a lot of opportunities, but had
difficulty converting," Uehara said. "There was a
bit of a learning curve adjusting to the grass sur
face."
Stanford added on two more goals in the sec
ond half with scores from junior Xanthe Travlos

dropped 6-1 to Cal.
