# Card trumps Tigers to lead NorPac
## 
### ALISSA HABER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 13 Stanford women's field hockey
team (11-2, 3-1 NorPac) continued to add on to
its impressive win total, and in the process en
sured its place on top of the NorPac Conference.
With its 3-0 win over league opponent Pacific
(3-7, 2-2 NorPac) on Sunday, the Cardinal now
stands alone atop of the West Division of the
NorPac. The season sweep over the Tigers also
marked the fourth shutout of the year for Stan
ford. The Cardinal improved its league record to
3-1, while the Tigers fall to 2-2 in conference play.
Although Stanford out-shot Pacific 11-0 in
the first half, the Card was not able to score a goal
until the 37th minute, when freshman Becky Dru
scored on a penalty corner.
When asked about the lack of offense in the
first half, senior Midori Uehara noted the diffi
culties in finishing early on, especially given field
playing conditions.
"We created a lot of opportunities, but had
difficulty converting," Uehara said. "There was a
bit of a learning curve adjusting to the grass sur
face."
Stanford added on two more goals in the sec
ond half with scores from junior Xanthe Travlos

GAME NOTES: No. 13 Stanford notched a win against Pacific
to stand alone atop the Western Division of the NorPac
Conference. The Card faces UC-Davis next and should
have no trouble with the division's last place team. The Ag
gies have yet to register a conference win and most recently
dropped 6-1 to Cal.

Junior Katherine Donner had two of Stanford's 22 shots on goal in the Card's contest against Pacific. Despite abundant opportunities,
Stanford didn't score until 36:04, but eventually came away with a 3-0 win over the Tigers.

and Uehara, who scored her team
leading eighth goal of the year.
For the entire contest, the Cardi
nal had 29 shots on goal, and racked
up an astonishing 20 penalty cor
ners, while allowing none by Pacific.
Although Uehara, the reigning
NorPac offensive player of the
week, is leading the team in goals,
what has been most important to
Stanford's offensive success is the
wide range of players adding offen
sive contributions on a consistent
basis. After this weekend, there are
six Cardinal players who have four
or more goals on the year.
Uehara applauded this broad of
fensive attack as one of the Cardi
nal's greatest strengths.
"When we play other teams, they
can't mark one player and effective

ly take away from our goal-scoring
potential," Uehara said. "Everyone
on the field is a scoring threat."

Stanford also continued its
amazing defensive play, as the Car
dinal allowed only two shots on goal
by the Tigers.
With the win, Stanford is now be
ginning to distance itself from the
rest of the NorPac, which is crucial
with only two conference games left
in the season.

Uehara knows the importance of
winning league games late in the
season.
"The post-season is all about
winning conference and moving on
from there," she said.
Up next for the Cardinal is an
other conference match against
UC-Davis this weekend at the Var
sity Turf. The game will be the first
of the final two home games of the
season.
