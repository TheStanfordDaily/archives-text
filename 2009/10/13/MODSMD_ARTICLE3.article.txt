## Email addresses to remain active after graduation 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Students can now retain a little more of
their Stanford affiliation after graduation

Gobaud 'OB MS 'lO. The project is largely

The Daily. "Keeping our faculty, students
and alums in contact and collaboration is a
major goal for us."
