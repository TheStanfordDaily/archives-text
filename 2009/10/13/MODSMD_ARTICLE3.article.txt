## Email addresses to remain active after graduation 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Students can now retain a little more of
their Stanford affiliation after graduation
day through their forwarding email
addresses. Beginning with the Class of
2009, the @stanford.edu email extension
will remain active for life.

"The response has been that people are

amazed with it," said ASSU President David
Gobaud 'OB MS 'lO. The project is largely
the brainchild of Gobaud, who has been
lobbying for the idea since before taking
office. Gobaud announced the news to the
student body in a campus-wide email
update on Saturday, almost a year and a half
after he first began pushing the project.
"It just took time there were a lot of
things that students don't realize are

involved with doing this," Gobaud said. "It
had to go through many different commit
tees for security and other issues."
Of the many administrators involved in
implementing the changes, Gobaud said
Registrar Thomas Black and Executive

Director of IT Services Bill Clebsch were
particularly instrumental.
"This was a major shift in policy for the
University, but we knew it was the right
thing to do," Clebsch said in an email to
The Daily. "Keeping our faculty, students
and alums in contact and collaboration is a
major goal for us."
The additional service will not
strain the existing email services, said
Clebsch.

Keeping 3,500 extra accounts
active the number of students in
last year's graduating class will
not require a capacity increase,
Gobaud said. Under the new pro
gram, past students will not be stor
ing their entire inboxes on Stanford
servers, but instead forwarding
emails directed at their Stanford
address to their current addresses.

"Many students already for
ward," Gobaud said. "We didn't want
to incur infinite costs for new servers
and storage. [Students] will have to
set up a forwarding address for it to
work, is my guess."

For now, the service will only be
available for the Class of 2009
onward.
Recent graduates were notified
Monday via email that their
SUNetID privileges were not going
to expire, as prior procedure dictat
ed. Students will automatically be
enrolled in the "Lifelong SUNetID
project," and retain SUNetID servic
es indefinitely.
People who lose email access are
encouraged to file a request at the
project's Web site to reactivate their
account.

"Our approach at present was to
keep from terminating the privileges
of the last year's graduating class,"
Black wrote in an email to The Daily.

But, in the future, "it is our intention
to include other classes in this pro
gram," he added.
Gobaud is currently working with
Clebsch, Black and Executive
Director of Administrative Systems
Ganesh Karkala to expand the fea
ture to past graduating classes.
"We are definitely hopeful that
[at] some point in the future it will be
retroactive," Gobaud said.
Some students have expressed
fears that the available SUNet IDs
will decrease with the new program.
Maintaining the access rights of past
graduates, however, won't be any dif
ferent than the current naming sys
tem, according to Clebsch.
"We already had a policy to never
duplicate any SUNet names, so this
extension of service was possible to
provide," Clebsch said.
Whether students will be able to
keep multiple alias IDs indefinitely
has yet to be determined.
