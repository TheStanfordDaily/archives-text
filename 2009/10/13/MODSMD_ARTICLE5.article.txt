## MISSING MASSEY Undergraduate community feels void nine months after passing of Thorn Massey, associate dean of multicultural education 
### FRANKIE FREEMAN 
When alumnus, Resident Fellow (RF) and
Associate Dean of Multicultural
Education Thomas Massey died on Jan. 1
at age 61, he left behind a number of earth
ly casualties.

A pillar of the multicultural community and a
prominent figure in undergraduate residen
tial life, Massey knew many people and
touched many lives. The tragedy was
both personal and institutional.
How, then, nine months later,
have the communities he left
behind felt his absence?
For students in hi;
Lagunita residence at
Naranja, Massey's death
represented the loss of a
mentor and friend.
"In the weeks after his
death, nothing seemed to
matter," explained Randy
Zabaneh 'lO, who has
lived at Naranja through
out his degree. "He had
this amazing ability to be .
different things to different '
people. He related to all of
us."
Within the Native
American community, with
which Massey had strong ties, his
death also hit particularly hard.

"It was devastating, just devastating," said Winona
Simms, director of the Native American Cultural Center

(NACC) and a close friend of Massey's. "For many of our
students, Thorn was 'Uncle TJ.' For a while after he passed
away, the [NACC] was like a dead zone."
Jan Barker-Alexander, associate dean of students and
director of Stanford's Black Community Services Center,
agreed.

"It's been a hard transition for the stu
dents who knew him," she said. "His
absence was deeply felt on our annual
retreat this year."
A long-time member of the
Stanford community, Massey
owed part of his success as an
educator and mediator to the
bank of experience he built
up over the years.
"Thorn had been wit
ness to great social change
at Stanford," Barker-
Alexander explained.
"When an issue or situa
tion arose, he could always
put it into context."
After earning a
Bachelor's degree from
Stanford in 1969 and a
Master's in 1972, Massey
dedicated the best part of 40
years to the University. By the
time of his death, he had served
numerous roles on campus, includ
ing assistant director of the Graduate
