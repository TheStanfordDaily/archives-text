## MISSING MASSEY Undergraduate community feels void nine months after passing of Thorn Massey, associate dean of multicultural education 
### FRANKIE FREEMAN 
When alumnus, Resident Fellow (RF) and
Associate Dean of Multicultural
Education Thomas Massey died on Jan. 1
at age 61, he left behind a number of earth
ly casualties.

A pillar of the multicultural community and a
prominent figure in undergraduate residen
tial life, Massey knew many people and
touched many lives. The tragedy was
both personal and institutional.
How, then, nine months later,
have the communities he left
behind felt his absence?
For students in hi;
Lagunita residence at
Naranja, Massey's death
represented the loss of a
mentor and friend.
"In the weeks after his
death, nothing seemed to
matter," explained Randy
Zabaneh 'lO, who has
lived at Naranja through
out his degree. "He had
this amazing ability to be .
different things to different '
people. He related to all of
us."
Within the Native
American community, with
which Massey had strong ties, his
death also hit particularly hard.

"It was devastating, just devastating," said Winona
Simms, director of the Native American Cultural Center

(NACC) and a close friend of Massey's. "For many of our
students, Thorn was 'Uncle TJ.' For a while after he passed
away, the [NACC] was like a dead zone."
Jan Barker-Alexander, associate dean of students and
director of Stanford's Black Community Services Center,
agreed.

"It's been a hard transition for the stu
dents who knew him," she said. "His
absence was deeply felt on our annual
retreat this year."
A long-time member of the
Stanford community, Massey
owed part of his success as an
educator and mediator to the
bank of experience he built
up over the years.
"Thorn had been wit
ness to great social change
at Stanford," Barker-
Alexander explained.
"When an issue or situa
tion arose, he could always
put it into context."
After earning a
Bachelor's degree from
Stanford in 1969 and a
Master's in 1972, Massey
dedicated the best part of 40
years to the University. By the
time of his death, he had served
numerous roles on campus, includ
ing assistant director of the Graduate


BRIAN HOWALD/The Stanford Daily
Life Office, assistant dean of Student Affairs
and, for the last 10 years, RF at Naranja. Massey
also co-authored a book entitled "Mediation:
Transforming Conflict through
Communication" and held lectures on conflict
resolution.
Aside from academic and administrative life,
Massey was also a sportsman. He played foot
ball during his student days at Stanford and,
later on, at the NFL level for the Dallas
Cowboys.
Despite his imposing figure, he was "the
most approachable of the Stanford faculty,"
Zabaneh said. "He would mould to the interests
of whomever he was talking to, whether they
were an academic or a sports fan."
Massey was perhaps best known for his role
within Stanford's multicultural community. As
associate dean of Multicultural Education, he
spent much of his time working alongside the
six cultural centers on campus. He led
Stanford's Cultural Awareness Associate
(CAA) program, an initiative aimed at enabling
better cultural understanding and respect in stu
dent residences.
Zabaneh recalled the CAA program in
Naranja. "Thorn arranged a 'Cultural Food
Progressive,' where residents would get togeth
er and share different ethnic foods," he said. "It
was a fun, sociable event that encouraged us to
get to know students from different ethnic
backgrounds."
Massey also ran "Faces of the Community," a
program originally started in the communities
of East Palo Alto and later held at New Student
Orientation, that celebrated diversity of race,
religion, sexual orientation, thought and physi
cal ability.
"Faces" directly led to the creation of the
CAA program in 2000, when, during a residen
tial retreat, students were asked to come up
with solutions to a real-life scenario. In the exer
cise, one student brought up what she termed as
"ignorance and lack of cultural understanding"
from one of her peers after they had attended a
"Faces" event not long before. The CAA model
was aimed at easing such tensions through out
reach and education.
Above all, Massey was an advocate for the
causes and people he believed in.
"The students were very aware that Thorn
was there to support their development as peo
ple within the wider cultural community,"
Barker-Alexander said. "When a student came
to him with a problem, they always felt that they
had his undivided attention."
Similarly, Massey fought to ensure that
opportunities for cultural education were made
available to Stanford students.
Last year, while filming "Voices and
Choices," a series in which students discuss the
meaning of community, Simms recalls a situa
tion that arose over the price of videotapes.
"We were having difficulties getting the
University to pay for the tapes," she explained.
"To ensure that the project could go ahead,
Thorn paid for them himself."
Since his death, funding deficits have
claimed several of the programs that Massey
championed. This year, the CAA program
failed to operate, due to budget cuts, as did the
Head Peer Academic Program (HPAC) pro
gram. Within Naranja, the dorm's entrepreneur
ial theme was lost. In an unrelated structural
change, freshmen were also moved out of the
residence,
"With so many multicultural activities being
aimed at freshmen, their absence in Naranja has
caused things to lag behind a bit this year,"
Zabaneh said.
Defending the changes, Associate Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Sally Dickson
assured The Daily that such moves were
planned in advance. "The changes within
Naranja and the decision not to fund the CAA
program this year were due to budget cuts," she
said.
Would things have been different if Massey
were still around? Dickson's response was an
emphatic "no."
"Stanford has the infrastructure in place to
carry on Massey's work," Dickson said. "No
project should be entirely dependent on an indi
vidual."
But will Massey's work really endure? In
some respects, it will. Two new RFs now serve
the residents of Naranja, and, in many ways, life
goes on as normal.
"The thing about universities is that the stu
dent population is constantly changing,"
Barker-Alexander said. "Some residents in
Naranja won't have ever known him."
Although the CAA program is not running
this year, the structure is now set for anybody
who wants to take it on, thanks to Massey.
What is missing, though, is the person who
advocated for these things in the first place.
"Budgets cuts had been threatening the
CAA program for a couple of years, but Thorn
had fought against it," Simms said. "Not long
before he died, he said to me, 'l'll pay for it out
of my own pocket if I have to.'"
Whether Massey could have saved his proj
ect or not, those who knew him agree that he
served a role far beyond his job description.
"He saw himself as the mediator of diverse
cultures at Stanford," Simms said. "He was mas
terful ... But too few people recognized his
achievements."
For Barker-Alexander, Massey's point of dif
ference was his long association with and under
standing of Stanford.
"For me, he was the Griot the storyteller,"
she said. "I remember one alum once describing
him to me 'like the Hoover Tower.' You just
knew he would always be there."
The Black Community Service Center will be
holding a memorial service for Thorn Massey on
Oct. 25 as part of Stanford Reunion Homecoming
2009.
