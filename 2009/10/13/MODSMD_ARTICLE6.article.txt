### VIVIANA ARCIA 
Kiva Co-founder Jessica Jackley MBA 'O7 was
the keynote speaker at the Sophomore Symposium,
speaking about her non-profit organization as part
of the event's theme, "Confronting Poverty."
Jackley's Kiva is dedicated to micro-financing
third-world entrepreneurs, which originally began
as away to connect entrepreneurs from the devel
oping world to American investors with less than
$5O.

It has since become a worldwide phenomenon.
In the four years since its founding, Kiva has loaned
over $lOO million dollars and has earned praise
from sources ranging from Bill Clinton to Time
Magazine, who named Jackley one of 2009's 100

Sociology Prof. David Grusky, as well as professors
from the economics, English and political science
departments, and Kiva co-founder Jessica
Jackley all gathered last night at the Sophomore
Symposium to discuss ways to confront poverty.
Most Influential People.
Jackley spoke last night at Toyon
Hall, in conjunction with a wide
range of experts, to speak on the
topic of microfinance and poverty.
Faculty from the economics, soci
ology, English and political science
departments also participated.
Exploring an interdisciplinary
method of looking at a complex
issue was a central concern.

"One of the goals [of the
Sophomore Symposium] is to see
how scholars in different disciplines
can think about different policies,"
said Sociology Prof. Paula England.
"I think sociologists often have to
acknowledge that there are social
influences to poverty which explain
why things are the way they are, why
the people in power are in power,
and how these things can be
changed."
England's view of a multidiscipli
nary approach was echoed through
out the discussion by other faculty
members present, who all presented
their perspectives, from both an aca
demic and personal level, on the
issues surrounding poverty.
The discussion began with
Jackley's keynote speech, which
went into detail on how the idea of
Kiva came about. Jackley heard
Nobel Peace Prize winner
Mohammad Yunus speak at

Stanford while working as an office
assistant just out of college, and she
decided afterward to leave her job
to embark on a journey to East
Africa.

The journey to understand the
effects of brutal poverty was not
without its apprehensions.
"It's overwhelming to process
poverty, and at first I thought, 'I
have no idea how I'm going to con
front this,"' Jackley said.
For six months, Jackley spent day
after day interviewing small entre
preneurs in rural Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda on their situations.
Each admitted that predatory lend
ing was a significant and crippling
cause for the cycle of unrelenting
poverty that they and their families
were privy to. Yet in hearing of their
struggles, Jackley found strong and
hardworking people who worked
day after day to pull their families
out of poverty with little to no out
side assistance a stark contradic
tion to Jackley's previous beliefs
about poverty.
"These were stories of hope and
dignity, which contradicted with my
ideas of poverty as shameful and
sad," Jackley said.

After six months in the African
continent, Jackley returned to
Stanford and graduated from the
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
in 2007. While a student at the GSB,
Jackley had already laid the ground
work for what would soon become
Kiva. Through a network of friends
and family, she began connecting
the African entrepreneurs she had

met to prospective loan givers, who
would extend $2O to $5O in loans to
those entrepreneurs.
Kiva has grown exponentially
since then, yet Jackley stressed to
the audience the importance of
small thinking.
"If my experience with Kiva
taught me anything, it was that the
only way to start anything is by
starting small," Jackley said.
The discussion eventually turned
to the remainder of the panelists,
who each gave respective views on
the question of poverty. Economics
Prof. John Pencavel stressed the
equalizing of human capital such as
schooling and training as a means to
escape poverty.

Associate Sociology Prof. Shelley
Correll urged the audience to recog
nize stereotypes, most of them nega
tive, which govern the way most
Americans view poverty and those
afflicted by it.

"There needs to be a move
toward a space where the working
poor, people working two jobs while
still being in poverty, are seen in a
more positive light," Correll said.
The symposium's multidiscipli
nary discussion on one of the
world's most relevant issues had an
effect on Jackley, who hopes to take
back to her non-profit some of the
ideas espoused last night.
"I'm grateful for these new per
spectives," she said. "It's inspiring to
look through fresh eyes."
