On May 11, 24 Stanford students set out from
Papeete, Tahiti on The Robert C. Seamans and head
ed for Honolulu, Hawaii. They were in search of algal
cells and studied ocean circulation. The trip would
take 37 days, and they would travel 3,500 nautical
miles, the equivalent of approximately 4,030 land
miles.
Marine Sciences Prof. Barbara Block and Earth
Sciences Prof. Rob Dunbar led the students' journey,
accompanied by two Teaching Assistants (TAs), two
other faculty and nine staff members from the Sea
Education Association. All 39 of them squished onto
a 134-foot ship, crammed into berthing areas with six
to eight bunks or two-bunk cabins.
"Stanford@SEA is exciting because not only do
we do cool science, but we do it from a sailing vessel,"
Dunbar said. "We cross vast distances of the ocean
working as a team."
Dunbar and Block, the two coordinators of the
trip, created this course in 2002, and Dunbar has
sailed on all four of the expeditions. As a sea-going
oceanographer, he has taken students not only to the
tropics, but also to Antarctica.
"I love going to sea," Dunbar said. "I've spent at
least eight years of my life at sea living in tight quar
ters, so I guess I'm used to it. Also, I don't get seasick
that helps."
The Stanford@SEA class took place spring quar
ter of 2009, and began with five weeks of study at the
Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, Calif.
Students learned navigational and seamanship skills
in a classroom before they braved the actual ocean.
By the time the group reached Hawaii, they had
gained such expertise in celestial
navigation techniques that the GPS was merely an
emergency back-up device.
Armed with an almanac, the students used sex
tants to judge the angle between the horizon and the
stars. Then, combined with the knowledge of the time
of the measurement, they looked up their exact loca
tion.
The students also each picked a research topic
before they flew out to Tahiti. These included exam
ining the weather, taking samples of the earth's crust
and considering the effects of global warming on the
temperature of the water. The professors themselves
ran their own experiments alongside their students.
Each day was divided into five watches two
day-watches and three night-watches and each
person was assigned every third watch. Chores
included working in the galley, cooking the six meals
served daily, cleaning, standing at the helm, steering
the ship and other navigational duties.
"One of the coolest parts of the class was that by
the time we reached Hawaii, it was basically us run
ning the ship," said Christine O'Neil 'lO, a marine
biology major who studied offshore snails and their
biodiversity as her project.
The remaining time the students had was divided
up between eating, sleeping and researching.
"You learned how to sleep whenever and wherev
er," O'Neil added.
In accordance with sailing tradition, the "polly
wogs," sailors who have not yet sailed across the
equator, must undergo a ceremonial, jocular harass
ment at the hands of the "shellbacks," those who have
crossed this line. Originating at a superstitious time
when the world feared the treacherous equatorial
line, sailors sought to appease King Neptune in return
for safe passage.
The Robert C. Seamans was no exception in
upholding the tradition. In the days leading up to the
crossing, "King Neptune" wrote messages to the

Stanford pollywogs. On the official day of the event,
the students underwent a sort of obstacle course, cul
minating in a ritual head-shaving and donation of hair
to King Neptune.
The ship paused for a few quick breaths along the
trip, stopping at the islands of Moorea, Rangiroa and
Nuku Hiva. Here, they had the chance to buy fresh
fruit from the island natives and walk on land for a
few hours, swimming in lagoons and exploring the

territory.
The island of Rangiroa is actually a coral ring that
surrounds a central lagoon, with a sparse population
that nevertheless is brimming with amicability and
greeted the students with open arms.
"On Rangiroa, hitch-hiking was super easy,"
O'Neil said. "The drivers were more
than willing to drive you anywhere you wanted, no
matter how far out of their way it was."
Seasickness was only a mild problem for most of
the crew, and that only lasted for the first few days. It
was lucky that they started from Tahiti rather than
Hawaii, because the waters of Tahiti are much calmer,
lending an easier transition to sea life.
Squalls did not strike until The Robert C. Seamans
reached the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ),
an area just north of the equator. While these storms
forced the students to watch the radar and be wary of
any sudden attacks from the sky and sea, they never
theless cooled off the area and blew away some of the
humidity.
Landing in Hawaii was bittersweet for the crew of
The Robert C. Seamans. A return to civilization is
always cause for celebration. But the opportunity to
study as a sailor is an experience that many partici
pants may never repeat.
