## Local health experts talk care Discussion comes after key Senate committee vote 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Listeners packed a Tresidder con
ference room last night for a panel
organized by the Center for Ethics
and Society on the controversial topic
of healthcare.
Just hours after the U.S. Senate
Finance Committee passed a key
healthcare bill, the panel, moderated
by pediatric Prof. Don Barr, featured
healthcare experts Hal Holman,
Harold Luft and Victor Fuchs as they
discussed their views on the complex
issue.
Holman, an emeritus professor of
medicine, spoke first on the single
payer system, which he personally
favors. In the single-payer system, the
government dispenses health care to
every American.
""[The single-payer system gives]
not only superior healthcare and a
better financing system; we would
have universal care ... simplicity...
portability and efficiency of practices,"
Holman said.
Luft, director of the Palo Alto
Medical Center Research Institute,
then outlined his plan, which includes
coverage for hospitalizations and
chronic illnesses. But beyond that, he
explained, he would leave Americans
largely on their own.
"I would argue for hospitalization
and chronic illness that's what's
driving healthcare costs. Those things
account for two-thirds of healthcare
costs," Luft said. "The rest are minor
acute problems, and most people can

pay. For low income levels, you pro
vide income based subsidies."
Finally, Victor Fuchs, professor
emeritus of economics and of health
research and policy, discussed the idea
of a universal voucher system in which
citizens would pay a value added tax,
essentially a tax on any exchange of
money. The money gathered from that
tax would then be equally distributed
to pay for a basic care plan.
From this plan, he said, individuals
could choose from a number of
approved options that were privately
accountable for the finance and care
of their customers. Companies would
therefore have incentives to stream
line care and provide patients with the

best available care.
"Every person in America would
have an opportunity to enroll in a
voucher for... good basic care,"
Fuchs said.
All the plans accounted for univer
sal coverage, though each took a dif
ferent path on how to achieve it. All
three speakers also agreed that the
way government currently finances
and dispenses health care is faulty, if
not completely broken.

Holman spoke specifically on the
obsolete state of the healthcare sys
tem, which he believed was geared
toward a different time period with
different health problems.
"The health system was developed
when acute disease was the main
medical problem. Today, chronic dis
ease is the main cause of disability," he
said. "It accounts for 80 percent of the
cost of healthcare."
The panel was then opened up for

audience questions, ranging from
more technical critiques of each plan
to what is going on in Washington.
One audience member asked why
the United States currently doesn't
have a universal health coverage
package available,
"The answer to your question is
greed," Holman said.
Fuchs expanded upon the matter.
He outlined how three-quarters of the
people currently without health insur

ance can't afford it, while the other
fourth are unwilling to acquire it.
"Two necessary and sufficient con
ditions [for universal coverage] are
subsidizing those who can't afford
insurance and compulsion for those
who don't want it," Fuchs said. "The
public can't bite the bullet of subsidies
and compulsion."
