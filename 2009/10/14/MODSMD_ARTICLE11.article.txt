## Hoxby, CREDO spar over schools study In memo, economics professor claims mistake 
### MELANIE SCHEIBLE 
As the adage goes, it's not what you
do. It's how you do it.
That's the lesson playing out
between Stanford economics Prof.
Caroline Hoxby and researchers at the
Center for Research on Education
Outcomes, who disagree over whether
the center's study on charter schools
really contained the statistical error
that Hoxby alleged in a memorandum
last week.
The center's study, published this
summer, compared the performance of
students at charter schools to the per
formance of students in traditional
public schools by measuring a number
of achievement indicators. It featured
pro files of hypothetical public school
students created by averaging scores
across demographics.
These hypothetical students' scores
were compared directly against those
of real charter school students' of the

same demographics.
But the study, Hoxby said, has a
problem.
In her memo last Thursday, "A
Serious Statistical Mistake in the
CREDO study of Charter School,"
later amended, along with a new title:
"A Statistical Mistake in the CREDO
Study of Charter Schools," she con
tended that because the public school
students' profiles are simulated
through averages, there is a smaller
margin of error for measuring their
achievement.
Hoxby released the memo through
the National Bureau of Economics
Research Web site, critiquing
CREDO'S method of data analysis.
The memo includes what she calls a
"boiler-plate" proof.
According to Hoxby, the math in
her memo is easily recognizable by any
economist. "This is not an original mis
take," she said. Her memo, she claimed,
uses the proof that would be taught in
a first-year graduate-level economics
class to explain why this mistake was
made.
Education Prof. Martin Carnoy,
who is not associated with CREDO or

NBRE, said public academic disagree
ments like this are not unusual.
Furthermore, he said, they are not
unusual for Hoxby.
"Hoxby's pretty aggressive on this
stuff," Carnoy said.
Hoxby's criticism sparked a rebut
tal from CREDO Director and
Hoover Fellow Margaret Raymond,
who said CREDO was obligated to
point out that Hoxby was wrong in her
assessment. The methods for analysis
had been vetted through a pilot study
that revealed the methods would work,
Raymond said.
"The pilot gave us the confidence
that our approach was solid,"
Raymond said. "It was peer reviewed
by four [other institutions], and none of
Hoxby's views emerged."
While Raymond said CREDO had
spoken on the matter, the question
remains as to whether Hoxby's memo
seeks to serve her own research results.
Raymond, Carnoy and charter
school literature all indicate that there
are a wide range of perspectives on the
efficacy of charter schools. Some
schools are effective in their geograph
ical area, some in their academic

expertise; some are not successful at all.
Also highly variable are the conclu
sions of policymakers and researchers.
Hoxby's work on charter schools
consistently points toward a positive
assessment of charter school achieve
ment.
While Hoxby insists that the memo
regarding CREDO'S study is com
pletely unrelated to her own research,
the conclusions of her research cast a
much more positive light on charter
schools than the CREDO study's con
clusions.
"I was being asked about the
CREDO study often," Hoxby said,
"but it was hard to explain the prob
lem with the statistics in words to
every person who asked." That, she
said, is why she wrote the memo for all
of the colleagues and education
researchers to read as an answer to
their questions.
Carnoy commented that "maybe
she did find something wrong [with the
study], but she obviously did not like
the message."
