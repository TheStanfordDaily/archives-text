## EDITORIAL Soph. Symposium sheds important light on poverty 
### 
Undergraduate and professorial minds
confronted the issue of poverty at this
Monday's Sophomore Symposium
featuring keynote speaker Jessica Jackley
MBA 'O7. Many aspects of poverty were dis
cussed between a multidisciplinary panel,
but perhaps the most striking argument for
change was that of a change of perception:
poverty seen not as a problem, but as a con
cern for the lives of others; poverty seen not
as a dirty word, but as a position which many
are diligently working to overcome; poverty
defined not as a buzzword of public policy,
but as a face of humanity that is easily forgot
ten.
The Editorial Board salutes the panel for
bringing the issue of poverty in America to the
Stanford community in away that emphasizes
the human face of the problem without pa
tronizing those who live in poverty. Instead,
the panel emphasized the ways in which Stan
ford students can proactively work toward im
proving society through their own careers
after school. The panel correctly identified
NGOs, non-profits and organizations like
Teach for America as influential organizations
that help bring college graduates to the aid of
impoverished communities throughout
America. Jackley also identified the serious
merits of working for an organization such as
these as a recent Stanford graduate.
In the first few years after graduation,
young people generally have more opportu
nity and freedom to commit to an organiza
tion like Teach for America or a form of pub
lic service than at any other point in their
lives. Furthermore, these kinds of work can
broaden a recent graduate's experience and
understanding in ways that the academic or
corporate world cannot. There are also ways
for graduates to make a difference outside of
these structured programs. As part of her
presentation, Jackley recalled how, in her
younger life, she was able to use her under

graduate and business degrees to forge her
own path in public service. Regardless of the
major, someone who is committed to public
service has the ability to make significant
strides if she or he is committed to doing so.
While the symposium was not a direct call
to action, it challenged the audience to con
template what the face of poverty really
looks like. Policies and actions aiming to con
front the condition of poverty should stem
first from true understanding of those in
poverty. Hopefully, undergraduates stepped
away from the symposium with a broader
perspective on poverty and the policies that
could help alleviate the problem. But words
cannot change the fundamental understand
ing of poverty that comes from firsthand ex
perience. It is easy to sign up for a program
that indirectly aids the urban poor, easy to
donate a few dollars to a homeless shelter,
easy to talk about poverty, the problem. What
is hard, on a mental and spiritual level, is to
actually connect with the problem in all its
misery, but also in the hope that those in
poverty have to change their lives and the
lives of their families for the better. That is
why the Editorial Board is grateful the sym
posium was able to bring this issue to campus.
It may seem, from the position of an un
dergraduate without a career or capital to at
tack issues such as poverty at large, like a
daunting task to confront such a large, global
concern. But as Jessica Jackley asserted, you
start out small. Changing the name of pover
ty to a face. Changing the stereotype of work
into away to give back. Changing how we
view our own unique positions now and post
undergrad as places to truly affect change
and not just dream about it. Combating
poverty is about a human-to-human relation
ship, not checking off a duty to society. Hope
fully, many more will follow in the footsteps
of those like Jackley or forge their own paths
toward the end of poverty.
