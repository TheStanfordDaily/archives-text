# GET IT RIGHT
## Good intentions pave the road to Hell... and the Nobel Peace Prize! 
### Erica Morgan 
Hey kids! Do you have pending appli
cations? Are you really in need of a
resume booster? Do you have peace
ful notions ? Stop right there! How would you
like ... a Nobel Peace Prize?!?
Here's what you do (it's a simple strate
gy): 1) Become extremely popular. Network
your ass off, make sure you can schmooze
with the powerful highfaluting politicians,
and don't forget to weed out the more em
barrassing associations of your youth. 2) Pick
an issue to champion! 3) Become a well
waxed public speaker, and bring the atten
tion of the masses to your cause.
Apparently, that's about it! You don't ac
tually need to do anything. That would be a
waste of time. Just make a lot of noise about
what you intend to do, and you're well on
your way to prize winning!
Yes, despite efforts to resist, I feel com
pelled to weigh in with my opinion about
Obama's recent receipt of the Nobel Peace
Prize. It's difficult to decide where to begin
on this issue, A brief history of the Prize, per
haps: Alfred Nobel established the five
awards (chemistry, physics, literature, physi
ology/medicine and peace) in his will. The
Peace Prize is awarded by a five-member
committee elected by the Norwegian Parlia
ment, and is bequeathed upon its recipient by
the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Suppos
edly, the great "honor" is conferred upon the
person who has "done the most or the best
work for fraternity between nations, or the
abolition or reduction of standing armies and
for the holding and promotion of peace con
gresses."
There is so much wrong with this. Let's
start with the most obvious: For all his elo
quence, oozing charm and promises of
change, all that Obama has done thus far is
make noises about closing Guantanamo Bay
(let's move the terrorists to the mainland!),
bombast the resisting public with plans for
socialized healthcare, and deliver vague yet
powerfully phrased speeches about eliminat
ing nuclear weapons and bringing lasting
peace. How pretty.
CNN reports that Obama considers his
Prize less as a recognition of his accomplish
ments and more as a "call to action." Thank
you for that clarifying sentiment, Mr. Presi
dent! It very nicely calls attention to that fact
that you have not accomplished anything of
significance.
Our motivated and well-intentioned pres-

ident humbly and gracefully accepted this
honor, while promising to push for "nuclear
nonproliferation, a reversal of the global eco
nomic downturn and a resolution of the
Arab-Israeli conflict." Wow, that makes him
really stand out from the crowd, doesn't it?
Well, at least Fidel Castro approves. Cas
tro points out that the award is a positive
step, though perhaps less of a recognition of
Obama than a statement against former
President Bush. An astute observation: It
seems that the Nobel Committee is now
awarding Peace Prizes for the admirable ac
complishment of not being George Bush. I
would like to remind Americans that our for
mer war-mongering, anti-peace President
Bush received a great deal of support in his
counter-terrorism efforts following the hor
ror of the September 11 attacks. But good for
Obama for wanting to make peace with ter
rorists! At least he impresses the Norwe
gians.
It seems that Obama's lip service to glob
al peace concerns is paying off: CNN re
porters inform us that "Obama remains ex
traordinarily popular overseas, particularly
in Western Europe. A recent Pew Research
Center survey found that more than three
quarters of respondents in Britain, Germany,
France and Spain approve of Obama's for
eign policy." And of course, popularity
should be Obama's prime concern. I shall not
fear attacks by terrorist cells, because I know,
deep in my heart of hearts, that our president
is adored abroad. Hallelujah.
Obama is clearly unsuited for the "honor"
that this prize is supposed to represent. How
ever, having said that, I must declare that in
vestigation of past Nobel Peace Prize win
ners and nominees makes me question
whether there is any honor in the award at
all. Most recently offensive, in my opinion,
was the presentation of the Prize to A1 Gore,
environmentalist and hypocrite extraordi
naire (while he saved the planet, his private
20-room home and pool house devoured
nearly 221,000 kilowatt-hours in 2006, more
than 20 times the national average of 10,656
kilowatt-hours). If you want more food for
thought, know that Erik Brandt nominated
Adolf Hitler in 1939, and that Stalin was also
a nominee. Interesting. Don't brag too loud
ly, Obama.
