"There are some things you can't share with
out ending up liking each other, and knocking
out a 12-foot mountain troll is one of them."
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,
p. 179

After much thought, we're still not
quite sure whether it's a blessing or a
curse that our world lacks 12-foot-tall
mountain trolls. While mountain trolls' inex
istence in the non-magical realm unquestion
ably keeps Palm Drive's 3,700 square feet
worth of palm trees intact, it also unfortu
nately prevents us from experiencing the sat
isfaction of clubbing one over the head.
Harry and his series-long best friends,
Ron and Hermione, actually do have this ex
perience their first year at Hogwarts, and, in
terestingly enough, manage to cast aside
some of their initial hostility toward each
other to become friends after this escapade.
Although this smelly and booger-filled bond
ing experience may not emerge in our own
lives, this instance does remind us that deep
friendships do not always evolve out of inten
tional relationships or common interests;
sometimes, it takes but a simple shared expe
rience to reveal to us another person's true
character and intentions.

The transition from high school to Stan
ford is undoubtedly difficult, even for the
most seemingly secure of freshmen. There is
not only the challenging newness of every
thing, but also the struggle to hold onto past
relationships. For many of us, we begin to re
alize that what cohered our pre-college
friendships was the fact that we shared the
ins and outs of life.

At Stanford, we start to recognize that of
tentimes this commonality simply isn't
enough to hold our friendships together.
While still appreciating the time and place in
which many of these past interactions held
value, we are satiated by a different kind of
friendship. We find ourselves stepping out
side of familiarity and refreshed, in contrast,
by a diversity of life experiences. Somehow,
days, weeks, months and years into our Stan
ford experience, we manage to stumble upon
a select few who stick by us through our most
idiotic moments, to whom we can tell any
thing, and who somehow just get us like no
one has before. In short, we find our very own
Rons and Hermiones.
It took a chance train ride and a troll
knock-out mission to bring Harry, Ron and
Hermione together, and, for many of us, it
took just that a CalTrain ride, a well
planned prank, Math 51 problem sets or a late
night encounter at TAP for us to stumble
upon the people who now help us navigate
through our Stanford careers and, well, life.
Those instances may have been trivial at the
time but they each bred the instant and unex
plainable "liking" that Harry, Ron and
Hermione (uh, maybe a little too much be
tween Ron and Hermione) experience after
their unintended encounters.

For Harry, Ron and Hermione, what could

have been a perfunctory relationship turns into
a bond that lasts through seven years of Hog
warts tribulations and constant battles with
dark wizards. Their accidental run-in with the
troll merely opens up the floodgates to a much
deeper friendship because it lends to an ulti
mate mission and purpose to defeat Lord
Voldemort. Rather than letting their apparent

differences (Hermione being clever, Ron being
less clever and Harry being angst-filled) give
them reasons to not pursue an unconventional
friendship, they discover that true friendship is
not about looking to others for affirmation and
good times, but that it is about looking forward
together toward a common goal. As Ron points
out to Harry before they set out on their final
attempt to defeat Voldemort, friends are those
who can say, "We're with you whatever hap
pens," not because of obligation, but because
Harry's aspirations and Ron's aspirations are
one and the same.

Perhaps, then, what makes many of the
friendships that we develop at Stanford so
meaningful is the journey on which we em
bark with the people around us. Like the in
famous trio, it takes but a chance experience
for us to see that spark and that shared sense
of purpose in someone else. Thus, it is imper
ative for us to be sensitive to the possibility of
meaningful camaraderie from chance en
counters, for it is these friends who join with
us in making sense of life, moving forward
and achieving our potentials.
On a side note, despite the absence of
trolls on campus, we'd like to remind you that
the unusually combative squirrels and vi
cious people-chasing raccoons are pretty
frightening, too. Nothing says instant friend
ship quite like a trip to the hospital to get
shots for rabies when you don't say
"Wingardium Leviosa" fast enough.
