To the editor,

Monday morning at about 8:30 a.m., a
peeping torn scared one of our residents, in
the women's bathroom, second floor, Robin
son House. The man, a white male, late 20s or
early 30s, about six feet, ran off, apparently in
a white van. The police were on site within
three minutes. This very morning, at 8:15
a.m., a man, the same man, peeped into the
women's bathroom in Adams, part of the
same residential compound (Sterling Quad).
Had the alarm been given from Adams
a simple call to 9-1-1 the pervert would
have been caught in or near Robinson.
There are two lessons from this incident.
One, the pervert was let in into the
dorms. While we do not want residents to
put themselves at risk, it is incumbent upon
us to ask people who we do not know and
who want to come into our dorm to show
identification. We can do this across a door's

window, waving our own ID if we have one.
Students (and faculty) have SUIDs; Stan
ford personnel have badges. Such a request
should not be offensive to a reasonable per
son, no more than being looked over in air
ports (or having one's bags checked at
Green Library). This is not about me, per
sonally; it is about a statistical risk. And if
the person is legitimate, we can gently ex
plain, in a slightly apologetic tone, once we
have let him or her in: "It is not about you; it
is just dorm safety. Do not take it personal
ly." To be too mellow is not ethical.
Two, if a Stanford student (or faculty, or
staff) is the victim (or near victim) of any
sort of foul play, be it about his or her prop
erty or about his or her physical integrity,
the problem is not over with him or her. He
or she must call 9-1-1 immediately to pro
tect others who might be the next target of
the offender. We individuals are not islands,
and have responsibilities toward others.

Two years ago, there was a string of burgla
ries (a fast-moving rogue party of three) in
Governor's Corner and Lyman. At one
point, a graduate student heard a scratch at
his door. He opened it; three people ran
away. They had been trying to pry open his
lock. Incident over, he thought, and re
turned to his tasks. Then, three hours later,
he thought that maybe he should inform
someone, and sent an email to a local hous
ing manager. It was Friday, 6 p.m.; no one,
evidently, was in the office to read the belat
ed alarm. Too late. Think before doing noth
ing. How good will you feel if a pervert you
have just escaped from harms someone else,
just because you were not diligent? To be
apathetic is not ethical.
