## POOL PARTY Getting to know the water polo players 
### MIKE LAZARUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There are a few things everyone thinks
they know about water polo players: tall,
strong, bleached-blonde hair, flip-flop wear
ing, Southern California residents.
While those stereotypes are by and large
true with the Stanford men's water polo team,
I sat down with eight members of this year's
squad to confront the misconceptions and un
cover some new truths.
I caught up with seniors Ryan McCarthy,
Jimmie Sandman, Drac Wigo and Janson
Wigo, sophomore Eric Clapper and redshirt
freshmen Travis Noll and Ryan Brown at
Kappa Alpha after dinner Monday night to
get inside the mind of the Stanford water polo
team.
Here's what I learned:
It all starts with a good song. Before every

game, the team blasts the song "Shots" by
LMFAO in the locker room. Other songs that
find their way into the pregame playlist are
"Ice Cream Paint Job" by Dorrough and any
thing by Taylor Swift. You probably didn't peg
water polo players as country fans, did you?
Being a D-I athlete has its perks. Nike
Christmas, the day the players receive a volu
minous quantity of team gear from Nike, is a
day the team looks forward to every year. The
$27 per diem players receive on road trips is a
close second. For Sandman, though, it's not
just about the money and clothes: "It's all
about having a solid group of guys that you've
gone through, in my case, five years of hard
work and come out with a solid experience
most people don't get from college."
They're graceful in the pool, but not on the
dance floor. When asked which reality shows
they would most want to be on, Sandman em
phatically responded, "Anything but 'Dancing

With The Stars.'" Ladies man Janson Wigo
would like to be on "The Bachelor," and
everybody wants to see Shaquille O'Neal try
his hand at water polo on "Shaq Vs."
They don't like traveling inland. University
of the Pacific and UC Davis are the team's
least favorite places to play. The intense heat
and foul smell of cow feces annoys the Cardi
nal. At UOP, it's the, err, wildlife. "We found a
dead possum in the trash right next to our
bench," Sandman said.
Traveling to Hawaii and Europe makes up
for it, though. It's tough to complain about
Davis and Pacific, when the team also travels
to University of Hawaii some seasons. This
summer, Stanford flew to Croatia to play a se
ries of matches on the Croatian coast. Prince
ton and Pepperdine are also team favorites.
It's not just the people in the pool that are
playing. While All-American goalkeeper Jim
mie Sandman may get nearly all of the playing

time, true freshman Scott Platshon finds ways
to contribute. "After a tip out on defense, our
counter-attack starts with a great throw-in by
Platshon," Sandman said. "We've got a great
relationship."
They're not faint-hearted. Popular team
movies include "300," "Inglorious Basterds,"
"Zombie Land" and "Shawshank Redemp
tion."
It gets physical below the belt. On average,
players go through 3-4 swimsuits during the
course of the season. Chlorine usually claims
one swimsuit by fading the colors. As for the
others, you can use your imagination.
They're swimmers, not runners. If you're
trying to find a water polo player on campus,
don't start at the track. "We don't like to run,"
Brown said.
