# QB rating needs to be replaced

### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
For decades, sports statisticians
have tried to create an all-in
one formula to aptly measure a
player's performance. Baseball
sabermetricians created the simple
yet-useful OPS (on-base plus slug
ging) in the 1980s and, more recently,
John Hollinger developed PER (play
er efficiency rating), a comprehensive
basketball statistic.

Both metrics are predated by foot
ball's passer rating, an all-inclusive
method of determining a quarter
back's performance. Developed in the
early 19705, the metric attempts to give
an overall picture of a passer's per
formance by combining various statis
ticsâ€” touchdowns, yards and inter
ceptions per attempt, as well as com
pletion percentage. However, passer
rating has numerous faults.
The first problems arise from se
mantics. The term "passer rating" in
fers that the formula is only intended
to judge a quarterback's performance
through the air. In fact, that is exactly
what it does, as only passing statistics
are accounted for. But the passer rat
ing statistic has become used to evalu
ate a signal caller's overall play, which
poses an issue. A quarterback's game
is much more than just throwing the
ball and while most of the other activ
ities are cerebral and thus intangible,
there are measurable factors fum
bles and sacks, for instance that can
be worked in.

The Oakland Raiders' JaMarcus
Russell, for instance, had a passer rat
ing of 85.4 this Sunday a figure that
is above the league average. Using his
rating as a quick reference statistic
as many do would indicate that he
had a good game under center. But in
a 44-7 loss, Russell lost three fumbles
and missed so badly on his incomple
tions that balls routinely flew 20 yards
