# QB rating needs to be replaced
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
For decades, sports statisticians
have tried to create an all-in
one formula to aptly measure a
player's performance. Baseball
sabermetricians created the simple
yet-useful OPS (on-base plus slug
ging) in the 1980s and, more recently,
John Hollinger developed PER (play
er efficiency rating), a comprehensive
basketball statistic.

Both metrics are predated by foot
ball's passer rating, an all-inclusive
method of determining a quarter
back's performance. Developed in the
early 19705, the metric attempts to give
an overall picture of a passer's per
formance by combining various statis
tics— touchdowns, yards and inter
ceptions per attempt, as well as com
pletion percentage. However, passer
rating has numerous faults.
The first problems arise from se
mantics. The term "passer rating" in
fers that the formula is only intended
to judge a quarterback's performance
through the air. In fact, that is exactly
what it does, as only passing statistics
are accounted for. But the passer rat
ing statistic has become used to evalu
ate a signal caller's overall play, which
poses an issue. A quarterback's game
is much more than just throwing the
ball and while most of the other activ
ities are cerebral and thus intangible,
there are measurable factors fum
bles and sacks, for instance that can
be worked in.

The Oakland Raiders' JaMarcus
Russell, for instance, had a passer rat
ing of 85.4 this Sunday a figure that
is above the league average. Using his
rating as a quick reference statistic
as many do would indicate that he
had a good game under center. But in
a 44-7 loss, Russell lost three fumbles
and missed so badly on his incomple
tions that balls routinely flew 20 yards

over his receivers' heads. He was
every bit as pathetic as he has been
throughout the year, but according to
his passer rating, he did just fine.
It's not the statistic's fault that it
used to judge something that, frankly,
it does not judge. But regardless, the
general perception of passer rating as
an all-in-one formula is not going to
change.
Still, that is only one issue amongst
many. Even as solely a passing statis
tic, it has problems. The scale is seem
ingly arbitrary, and it's not standard
throughout the various levels of play
the method is different for the
NCAA and the NFL.
The NFL's problem stems from an
obsession with perfection. Each of the
four data pieces is put through a calcu
lation within the formula that is sup
posed to make it fit between the
bounds of 0 and 2.375 anything
above 2.375 gets rounded down, and
that category is deemed "perfect."
To determine the completion per
centage part of passer rating, for in
stance, you subtract 30 from the per
centage and multiple by 0.05. This
means that a quarterback who com-

pletes 77.5 percent of his passes is con
sidered perfect, as the calculation will
spit out 2.375. If he completes all of his
throws, the number doesn't change.
In the end, a "perfect" quarterback
needs to attain the following bench
marks: 77.5,11.875 and 0 percent com
pletion, touchdown and interception
percentages, respectively, and 12.5
yards per attempt. That would yield a
passer rating of 158.3 the highest
possible. Seem a little random and
overly complicated? It is, and it defies
logic one quarterback could have a
dramatically better game than his
counterpart, and yet both could wind
up with perfect ratings.
Contrast that with baseball's OPS,
for example, which is simple to com
pute and understand: combine a play
er's on base and slugging percentages,
and you have a rough indication of
how well that hitter is doing. Players
can perform well, but perfection is
possibly only if you hit a home run in
every single at-bat thus, it's essen
tially unattainable.
The NCAA passer rating doesn't
limit itself like the NFL, but it also
doesn't create a bottom; whereas the
NFL formula only allows players to go
as low as zero, NCAA quarterbacks
could receive a score of as low as -
731.96. Neither the NFL nor the
NCAA has it right the bottom
should be zero (instead of a random,

negative number) and perfection
should actually indicate, you know,
perfection. But either way, the formu
la ought to be standardized across the
leagues.
In addition to these rectifications,
passer rating should be adjusted to
conform to a league norm.To use OPS
again: OPS+ is derived from the origi
nal method, but it sets the average
performance at 100. Any hitter about
100 is doing well; anyone below is
doing poorly. It's effective in evaluat
ing players relative to their peers, as
well as in ascertaining their individual
performance. By contrast, average
NFL passer rating change from year
to-year it's generally in the high 70s
or low 80s, but it's never consistent,
and it changes from week-to-week.
While rough judgments can be made,
there is little that is standard.
All of these problems add up to
make passer rating a rather imperfect
statistic, but a few improvements
could make it more accurate and eas
ier to understand. When a formula
even comes close to showing a quar
terback as bad as Russell as "above
league average," even if just for a day,
it has issues.

bounds of 0 and 2.375 anything
above 2.375 gets rounded down, and
that category is deemed "perfect."
To determine the completion per
centage part of passer rating, for in
stance, you subtract 30 from the per
centage and multiple by 0.05. This
means that a quarterback who com-

pletes 77.5 percent of his passes is con
sidered perfect, as the calculation will
spit out 2.375. If he completes all of his
throws, the number doesn't change.
In the end, a "perfect" quarterback
needs to attain the following bench
marks: 77.5,11.875 and 0 percent com
pletion, touchdown and interception
percentages, respectively, and 12.5
yards per attempt. That would yield a
passer rating of 158.3 the highest
possible. Seem a little random and
overly complicated? It is, and it defies
logic one quarterback could have a
dramatically better game than his
counterpart, and yet both could wind
up with perfect ratings.
Contrast that with baseball's OPS,
for example, which is simple to com
pute and understand: combine a play
er's on base and slugging percentages,
and you have a rough indication of
how well that hitter is doing. Players
can perform well, but perfection is
possibly only if you hit a home run in
every single at-bat thus, it's essen
tially unattainable.
The NCAA passer rating doesn't
limit itself like the NFL, but it also
doesn't create a bottom; whereas the
NFL formula only allows players to go
as low as zero, NCAA quarterbacks
could receive a score of as low as -
731.96. Neither the NFL nor the
NCAA has it right the bottom
should be zero (instead of a random,

negative number) and perfection
should actually indicate, you know,
perfection. But either way, the formu
la ought to be standardized across the
leagues.
In addition to these rectifications,
passer rating should be adjusted to
conform to a league norm.To use OPS
again: OPS+ is derived from the origi
nal method, but it sets the average
performance at 100. Any hitter about
100 is doing well; anyone below is
doing poorly. It's effective in evaluat
ing players relative to their peers, as
well as in ascertaining their individual
performance. By contrast, average
NFL passer rating change from year
to-year it's generally in the high 70s
or low 80s, but it's never consistent,
and it changes from week-to-week.
While rough judgments can be made,
there is little that is standard.
All of these problems add up to
make passer rating a rather imperfect
statistic, but a few improvements
could make it more accurate and eas
ier to understand. When a formula
even comes close to showing a quar
terback as bad as Russell as "above
league average," even if just for a day,
it has issues.
