The No. 4 Stanford men's golf team held
strong at second place with a two over par at the
Prestige at the PGA West tournament in La

Cardinal sophomore David Chung landed in

a one-under 71. He stayed consistent, posting an

in a tie for fifth and finally he posted a two-under
70 to earn him third place.
