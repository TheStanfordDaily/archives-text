## Card takes second at 'Prestige' 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's golf team held
strong at second place with a two over par at the
Prestige at the PGA West tournament in La
Quinta, CA this week. The Cardinal overcame
all of its top Pac-10 competitors, like No. 3 Wash
ington (in third place) by three strokes and
Southern California and UCLA (in a tie for
fourth) by six strokes.

Texas Christian University, the returning
champions, defended its title for the second year

in a row and the third time in the tournament's
10-year history, finishing with a resounding 14
under par score of 850. The Horned Frogs start
ed out behind Stanford by seven strokes and
UCLA by nine after the end of the first round.
However, Texas Christian never gave up and
carded a 12-under final round score to seal the
deal.

"Second is really next best to first," Coach
Conrad Ray said. "We have a really competitive
team. Though it was awesome to beat the Pac-10
teams, our last round was hard because we kept
trying to get birdies to catch up with TCU when

everyone knew that [TCU] was running away
with it. Hats off to them for a good week of golf."
Cardinal sophomore David Chung landed in
a tie for third place at the Prestige, which was the
top finish of the Stanford five. Chung began in a
tie for the tenth on the individual ladder, posting
a one-under 71. He stayed consistent, posting an
other 71 to cut the number of competitors in half
in a tie for fifth and finally he posted a two-under
70 to earn him third place.
Junior Sihwan Kim finished in eighth with a
one-under 215 for the tournament.
Kim stayed on the top of the ranks
for the first two rounds, finishing in a
tie for second after two rounds of
play. However, blustery winds on the
course cost him a top five finish
when he posted a three-over 75 in
the final round.
Senior Jordan Cox got in the
game at the Prestige and fought off
the Horned Frogs with a three-over
219 and a tie for 18th place, one
stroke above his career best three
round score.
Freshman Andrew Yun continues
to show promise this season, finish
ing the Prestige with a seven-over
223 in a tie for 34th. Yun kept his
scores low in the first and last rounds
with a par 72 and a one-under 71, but
had trouble in the middle with a 79.
Just one stroke behind Yun was

junior Steve Ziegler in a tie for 37th.
Ziegler started strong with a 71 in
the first round but failed to hang on
toward the end given the windy con-

ditions and tough hole locations.
"We played pretty well." Ray
said. "I think we have a really good
group this year. David Chung was re
ally excited about how he finished. It
was also neat to see Cox have such a
solid contribution because he hasn't
played a whole lot."
The Cardinal will face their Pac
-10 rival, Washington, and some
tough non-conference competition
like No. 1 Oklahoma State next
weekend at the Isleworth Collegiate
Invitational, hosted by Texas Tech.
"To finish second in a field like
the Prestige is an accomplishment,"
Ray said. "All in all we put in a good
effort and had a good week. This
week is good to build on for Isle
worth because the course is just as
hard, if not harder, and the competi
tion will be difficult."
The Isleworth Collegiate will
begin on Saturday, October 23rd in
Orlando, Fla.
