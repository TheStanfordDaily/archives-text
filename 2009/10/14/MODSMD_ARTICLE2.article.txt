# STUDENT GOV'T
## Senate approves Wellness funds Several projects, events could face special fees process this year, some senators say 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
With the ongoing Board of Judicial Affairs issue now in the
hands of an ad hoc committee, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
met last night in a relatively quiet meeting to discuss changes to
the budget of the Wellness Room and the financial implications it
could have on student fees next year.
Senators went on to discuss their search for a new Senate Web
developer and deliberated on the process for picking Senate
Associates.

Wellness Room
Much of the dialogue from yesterday's meeting centered on
the Wellness Room, the focus of a $7OO budget shift. ASSU Vice
President Jay de la Torre 'O9 introduced a bill that would move
$7OO dollars budgeted for Wellness Room officer salaries to pro
gramming, bringing each element of that budget to $3,000.
Some senators were initially skeptical of the proposal, especial
ly in the final year of the room's "trial run," as Senator Alex Katz
'l2 termed it. Come next year, the Wellness Room may become
subject to the special fees process, senators suggested.
While the bill would not change the net allocation of funds to
the Wellness Room, some were concerned that adding more
money to a programming budget that includes pumpkin decorat-

ing and board game nights would
alter student perceptions in the
future.

Senator Anton Zeitsman 'l2 was
simply worried about the greater
financial pressure placed on stu
dents' pockets, asking whether
budget alterations to Mausoleum
Party, the Green Store and the
Wellness Room could cause a rise
in student fees.

Yet, after a presentation from
Wellness Room Director and chem
istry graduate student Debanti
Sengupta, who discussed future sur
veys to analyze the center's impact
on student life as well as future pro
gramming, senators were comfort
ed by the direction of the program,
eventually approving the bill for the
budget shift in a unanimous deci
sion from those in attendance.

New Positions
Also discussed was the need for
a new Senate Web developer.
Senator Lee Jackson 'l2 said he and
others are currently working to
publicize the paid position's avail
ability around campus.
Another point of debate for the
Senate was the selection process for
Senate Associates, freshmen who
participate in Senate work.
According to Deputy Senate Chair
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, more than 20
individuals applied.
Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll
hoped the Senate could devise a
fair process to pick the top "16 or
so" applicants.
In response, Senator Shelley
Gao 'll, speaking from
Washington, D.C., stressed the
importance of limiting the number
of associates selected. "Senate
Associate management can easily
get out of hand," she said via Skype.

The Senate also approved the
Publications Board's request for
$6,000 for the Stanford Flipside.
The senators present unanimously
passed the appropriation for the
student publication.
