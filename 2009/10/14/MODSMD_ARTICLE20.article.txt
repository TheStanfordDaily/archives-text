## THE 						CARDINAL'S NEW GROOVE

It goes like this: "Ay Ziggy Zoom

Following Cardinal victories, the
locker room walls rumble with this
foreign-sounding tune. But from
where did it come?
Head coach Jim Harbaugh taught
his players the song this year in train
ing camp. Harbaugh learned it from
his father, Jack Harbaugh. Jack Har
baugh learned it at Bowling Green
State University in Bowling Green,
OH, where students and alumni have
been singing it for years.
Though there is some debate over
its origin, a man by the name of
Gilbert Fox allegedly brought "Ay
Ziggy Zoomba" to Bowling Green. In
October 1944, the New York native
was leaving the service, having served
as an Air Force bombardier in Italy
during WWII. Finding that Bowling

"Ay Ziggy Zoomba"

Green was the only university in the
nation that had not yet started its fall
term, he enrolled there. He became
deeply involved in student life, even
tually becoming a founding member
of SIC SIC, a secret organization pro
moting school spirit.
In 1946, he was called on to per
form at a special spirit assembly. He
sang "Ay Ziggy Zoomba," an adapta
tion of a Zulu war chant he learned
from South American airmen while
in Italy. "Those airmen were great
singers of all kinds of songs and they
taught me [the song]," Fox said. The
song quickly caught on, and over the
years has become a hallmark of
Bowling Green tradition.
Some Bowling Green alumni
have expressed displeasure at Har
baugh's version of their beloved fight
song. On Ay-Ziggy-Zoomba.com, a
forum "for Falcons, by Falcons," a
user named Ydfalcon wrote: "Some
how it's kind of flattering that some
body thinks so highly of 'Ay Ziggy
Zoomba' that they want to adapt it,
but at the same time, I feel like it's
something that should stay firmly at
BG. It sounds kinda bastardized with
other schools' names in it."

"In my mind, some traditions are
overall collegiate traditions that are
OK at nearly any school," he contin
ued. '"Sweet Caroline', 'Hey Baby',
throwing co-ed's into the air the
number of times equal to the
amount of points the home team has,
things of that nature. But other
things, like 'Ay Ziggy Zoomba',
'Rocky Top',Troy's 'Burn the Horse',
or 'Script Ohio'...among others,
should remain solidly the traditions
of one school."

Fortunately for die-hard Falcons,
"Ay Ziggy Zoomba" is still confined
to post-victory locker room celebra
tions. Stanford students and alumni
will still gravitate toward the unoffi
cial fight song, "All Right Now" by
Free or various chants. "Ay Ziggy"
has yet to become a Stanford tradi
tion.

But even if it did wouldn't it
just be the Stanford version of a
Bowling Green version of a South
American fighter version of a Zulu
war chant?
