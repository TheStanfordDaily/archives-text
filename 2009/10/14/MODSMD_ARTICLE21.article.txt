# Directors' Cup is not enough
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
Every true Stanford sports fan
can recite one number when
arguing about the Cardinal's
athletic prowess: 15. That's
how many times Stanford has consec
utively won the Directors' Cup,
awarded annually to the top colle
giate athletic program in the country.
Those 15 trophies that are sitting
behind a glass display case on campus
represent almost every Directors'
Cup that has been awarded (North
Carolina won the only year that Stan
ford didn't, in 1994). 15 out of 16 isn't
too bad.

So the question of which school is
the premier athletic university should
have an easy answer, right? Heck,
there's even a mathematical formula
invented to pick a winner.
Unfortunately for Cardinal fans,
the answer is not as clear as they may
like to believe.

Have you ever tried using the term
Directors' Cup in a sports argument?
If you have, I'm guessing you proba
bly received one of three reactions:
1. A blank stare. Your opponent
has never heard of the Directors' Cup
and fails to see the relevancy of it in
the argument. Upon learning about
what the Directors' Cup is, your oppo
nent will proceed to one of the other
two reactions:

2. A scoff. Your opponent says
something along the lines of "no one
cares about how well women's fenc
ing and men's gymnastics do; it's all
about football and basketball."
Your opponent is probably a Flori
da fan.

3. A shrug of the shoulders and a
mild "I guess." Your opponent recog
nizes the dominance Stanford has in
some of the "lesser" sports, but still
believes the big time sports should
have a more of a role in determining
the best athletic program.
The Directors' Cup is a big accom
plishment and winning 15 in a row is
mind-boggling. Just take a moment to
think about how difficult it is to win
any award for 15 straight years. Now
consider winning that award against
342 other schools. Yet the point re
mains that, on a national scale, the Di
rectors' Cup is irrelevant.
Bottom line: nobody has heard of
it.
Part of the reason that the Direc
tors' Cup does not carry much weight
east of Palo Alto is that no other
school wins it (again, save UNC in
'94). It has become a foregone con
clusion that Stanford will win the Cup
year in and year out. The Directors'
Cup is not a goal other schools set for
themselves at the beginning of the
year, simply because it is unattain
able.
In short, Stanford's complete su
premacy in sports has hurt its nation
al reputation as a sports powerhouse.
Here's the Catch-22, though. The
only way for other schools to win and
learn about the Directors' Cup is for
Stanford to lose the Cup. That doesn't
seem like a promising strategy.
So, like most arguments about col
lege sports, it all comes back to foot
ball. The irrelevancy of the Directors'
Cup is just one more reason why this
year's football season is so important.
If Stanford football makes a run
this season and contends for the Pac
-10 title, or at the very least becomes
bowl eligible, Stanford University has
a chance to hop back on the map as a
sports powerhouse.
Basketball is still probably a sea
son or two away from getting back
into the March Madness Tournament.
Baseball could easily end up in
Omaha this summer playing in the
College World Series, but baseball is
simply not a big enough sport to carry
an entire university's athletic pro
gram.
Football is the best hope.
I'm not saying I agree with the
basis of national perceptions of ath
letic programs; I'm just stating how
these bases are formed. I know first
hand how much non-football, basket
ball, and baseball players train and
how much athleticism they have. I
would love to see those sports gain
more attention and respect.
For now, the pride of Stanford's
athletic programs lies in the hands of
the football team. Hopefully soon,
Cardinal fans will begin their argu
ments about the top collegiate pro
gram with Stanford football's nation
al title and then follow with the Direc
tors' Cup.
