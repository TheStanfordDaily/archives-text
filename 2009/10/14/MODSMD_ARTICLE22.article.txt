# SUPPLEMENTS
## The 						ins and the outs of supplements on the Farm Stanford athletes experience different reactions to products 
### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
Google searches for "Stanford" and "Steroids" may
bring up more results discussing adrenal receptors, im
munosuppression and other polysyllabic concepts for
eign to your average fuzzy than articles about baseball
or football. Steroid use has never been a visible problem

at Stanford the way it has at some other colleges. At
USC, for example, two linebackers who were being
courted by the NFL tested positive for steroids this past
spring. However, legal nutritional supplements also
cause temptation for many players and worry for many
coaches.

Nutritional supplements can describe anything from
Vitamin C pills to performance-enhancing substances
with potentially dangerous side effects. Many athletes
and sweaty students coming back from a weekly visit
to Arrillaga might chow down on a protein bar with- ,
out a second thought. Once you move up from that A

level, stores and websites packed with powders and
gels and liquids await, all beckoningly backed with

personal testimony, scientific formulas, and inde- a ,
cipherable chemical promises. f
While many of these supplements might be rel-
atively innocuous, they carry the risk of distracting
athletes from focusing on their healthy diet while 1
bringing little real gain. 1
"To a certain extent [protein powders] worked,
but it's hard to tell what made the biggest difference
since I was doing so many new [things], working out
twice as much, eating way more," said sophomore
Peter Livesey, a member of men's rugby. "The coach's
official position if that if you have a healthy balanced
diet, protein shakes shouldn't be necessary."
It might take a Stanford student to decipher the
promises nutritional supplements make. Descriptions
such as "supersaturating your muscle with its hyperos
motic accelerated creatine matrix" (from GNC) and
"pure pharmaceutical grade cross flow micro and ultra
filtered whey protein isolates and concentrate dramati
cally enhanced with an optimal ratio of the branched
chain amino acids" (from IntraPro) would seem to laugh
in the face of even Robert Langdon's deciphering abili
ties. Since these supplements are not FDA-regulated,
consumers can find it difficult to tell what the product
might really do and might forget about thinking beyond
the flashy label.

"You can go down to the GNC and buy any number
of supplies that people make, but we always counsel
[athletes] not to do that," said Charlie Miller, Stanford
athletic trainer for baseball and wrestling. "The problem
might not be using it, but using it incorrectly. People will
go, 'oh gee, if two ounces is good, what if I take a pound!'
But if used in excess these things can cause dehydration,
cramping," and a host of other problems.
Besides physical discomfort and possibly even re
duced performance, Miller cautions that legal problems
can ensue.
"Because most supplements aren't government regu
lated, they might contain substances minute enough to
not be on the label," Miller said. "When the NCAA
comes down and does drug testing, some of these things
can give you a false positive."
Way back in 2006, Chris Minaker 'O6, a 2006 Seattle
Mariners draft pick, wrote in his master's sociology the
sis on steroids at Stanford that "the supplement culture
has become completely intertwined with the culture of
collegiate sports."
Minaker found that 42 percent of athletes surveyed
used creatine, a legal but side-effect-ridden supplement
that might cause anything from successful weight gain to
vomiting to seizures. According to Charlie Miller, Stan
ford used to consider creatine acceptable to distribute to
athletes. The NCAA banned school distribution of crea
tine, but the substance is still allowed.
Many athletes at Stanford take protein powders for
the purpose of gaining weight or building muscle after
lifting. Coaches on some teams insist that a balanced diet
gets rid of the need for protein powders, while other
coaches seem to overlook the issue altogether.
According to sophomore Laura Malkiewich, nutri

tional supplements Muscle Milk, Cytomax, and SPR-3
whey protein make up a large part of women's crew
training.
"We all have to drink SPR-3, Gatorade, Cytomax, or
something during erg workouts because too many kids
have passed out and had to go to the hospital to get IV's,"
Malkiewich said. "At first I hated all of them, [but] I
forced myself to drink it and by the end of the season I
couldn't live without it. When your body is running on
empty that stuff tastes like the best thing in the world."
The women's crew team also emphasizes nutrition
and eating after workouts to repower tired muscles, and
the rowers ran with this advice on their own.
"The team was very diet-centered. We all had eating
buddies that would look at what we were eating for din
ner and approve it or make suggestions," Malkiewich
said. "That was something we implemented ourselves."
Some Stanford athletes push the boundaries past nu
tritional supplements into prescription drugs. The men's
rugby coach recently sent out a cautionary email against
a growing practice of popping ibuprofen before games,
warning that the drug lowers endurance.
"People think it will help them play right through the
pain," Livesey said.
While Stanford students may be responsible enough
to avoid the legal repercussions of steroid abuse, a host of
other products promise quick improvement after ingest
ing. Though the Cardinal seems to conduct itself with
greater integrity than many other sports programs, the
pervading culture of enhancement in a bottle still seeps
through the palm tree-bordered fields.
