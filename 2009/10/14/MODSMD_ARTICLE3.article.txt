## Human rights films roll Oct. 17 The 						United Nations Association Film Festival is free, on campus Oct. 21-25 
### CALLA HUAN SHENG STAFF WRITER 
After making Stanford's campus its home for socially-conscious
documentaries for 11 years. The United Nations Association Film
Festival returns this Saturday to screen 50 energy-themed documen
taries, each from a different country. The event will be free to the
Stanford community.
Composed of a diverse group of volunteers, including some with
Stanford connections, the festival's jury reviewed more than 500 sub
missions from late June to early July before deciding on the final 50.
Lisa Kerner 'O9, the assistant to the executive director of the fes
tival, explained the concept driving the festival.
"A lot of [the films] focus on energy, sustainable energy, oil, all
those pressing issues that are facing the world today," Kerner said,
"but also energy of the human spirit, and all sorts of human rights
issues."

The festival is set to begin Oct. 17 in downtown Palo Alto. More
screenings are scheduled for East Palo Alto and San Francisco
before the festival moves back to Stanford from Oct. 21-25, where
faculty members, including Nobel Prize-winning physics Prof.
Burton Richter and more than twen
ty filmmakers will join the audience
for discussion.
Jasmina Bojic, a lecturer in the
School of Education and the execu
tive director of the festival, called the
event "very much Stanford's film fes
tival," with many campus depart
ments lending cooperation.
"It's been part of Stanford life for
the past 12 years." she said.
The Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies is supporting
the festival for the fifth time this year.
"We're one of the co-sponsors of
the event and proudly so," said Coit
Blacker, director of FSI.
"I think there are multiple ways to
understand the importance of inter
national affairs, and in universities we
tend to focus on very traditional ways
of doing that," Blacker continued.
"Some of the most powerful
moments that I can remember in my
own development have to do with
windows and cultures and societies
that have been brought by film."
This year, the FSI will co-present
two films, "The Strangest Dream" on
Oct. 19, followed by a talk by Richter
on the ethics of nuclear technology,
and "The Reckoning: The Battle for
the International Criminal Court,"
on Oct. 20.
For Bojic, the most important
message of the festival is the unity of
human experience.
"It's giving students a chance to
learn what's happening," she said,
"and to get a sense that we're not
alone, that there are other countries
in the world going through the same
situations that we are here. They are
also thinking about the economy,
they're also thinking about food,
they're also thinking about jobs.
We're all united in the world."
Bojic, originally from the former
Yugoslavia, worked as a journalist for
years before joining the Stanford fac
ulty. At Stanford, she teaches a popu
lar class in international human rights
documentaries called "Camera as
Witness."
Inspired by her students, Bojic
started the first U.N. festival twelve
years ago in collaboration with the
Stanford Film Society and the United
Nations Association Mid-Peninsula
Chapter. The festival was also found
ed in commemoration of the 50th
anniversary of the creation of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
The specific medium of documen
tary films, Bojic said, was chosen to
allow the audience to see the world
differently than through fiction and
Hollywood narratives by raising
issues not often represented in main
stream media.
In the festival's twelve-year histo
ry, many of the films first screened
there have gone on to be nominated
for Academy Awards.
Ben Cortes 'll, Stanford Film
Society's coordinator for UNAFF,
described his experience as a jury
member this summer as "almost
exhausting but extremely reward
ing." He urged more students to
come out and appreciate the films.

"As big an event as it is on cam
pus," Cortes said, "it can remain sur
prisingly quiet, which is upsetting
because, having seen many of the
films, there are some pretty awesome
ones."
"It's good collection of films that
force you to think on, reflect on,
frankly, the most important issues
that you can," Cortes added. "That is,
how we're treating each other, and
how we're treating the planet.
Thematically, it doesn't get much
more important than this."
