# TRUSTEES DETAIL RECOVERY
## Hume: University is 'absolutely committed' to financial aid 
### ERIC MESSINGER ELIZABETH TITUS 
Stanford's Board of Trustees has concluded its
first two-day meeting of this academic year, with a
focus on continued negotiation of the University's
financial situation.

In a briefing Tuesday with The Daily, Board of
Trustees Chair Leslie Hume said a top priority for
the board moving forward will be undergraduate
financial aid, which is facing a significant funding
shortfall due to a combination of an historic expan
sion and a subsequent endowment loss of 26 percent.
The Stanford Challenge currently has a target of
$2OO million for undergraduate financial aid, and
Provost John Etchemendy has previously cited a
$2O million shortfall within that goal remaining to
be made up.
"What we're going to be doing in December is
really getting into the guts of the numbers," Hume
said, "and also finding out more about, is this a
short-term problem, is it a long-term problem, and
what are our options for dealing with it. We'll have
a much more in-depth discussion in December.
"It is clearly a big challenge for the University,
but we are absolutely committed to a very gener
ous financial aid program," Hume added. "The
students we have here, we're absolutely commit

ted to keeping here."
Humanities & Sciences
The board heard a report from Humanities &
Sciences (H&S) Dean Richard Sailer on the School
of H&S, the first full report the entire board has
heard in eight years.
"I think this was a very, very positive report,"
Hume said. "The school, in terms of looking at the
way in which we measure the strength of the
school, in terms of U.S. News and World Report
rankings of departments, peer rankings done by
faculty, Stanford has the highest number of depart
ments ranked in numbers one through ten. It's real
ly quite remarkable."
Hume also cited a yield rate of approximately 45
percent for Ph.D. students across departments,
which she said "may not sound like a lot when you
think about undergraduate admission yield rate,
but it's considered really, really good."
According to Hume, Sailer reported a desire to
strengthen the school's Asian studies programs, as
well as a need for more graduate fellowships.

Undergraduate Housing
The board has also had a positive takeaway from
efforts to reform undergraduate housing, with

Hume citing input from ASSU executives.
"There seems to be just uniform enthusiasm and
approbation for the unstuffing that has happened
as a result of renovation of Crothers and some of
the other unstuffing that's been done," Hume said.
"There is a real sense that progress has been made
in terms of student housing.
"That was something that was really a nagging
concern, that we were not serving our students par
ticularly well," she added. "It's wonderful to have
that behind us."
Hume reported that Dean of Residential
Education Deborah Golder also reported to the
board on areas with room for improvement.
"We want to make sure we're providing support
for students that we need to support and really look
at the way in which we can work on the education
al component of ResEd," Hume said. "One of the
things [Golder] mentioned was a desire to give stu
dents more contact with senior faculty in residences
and how we can do better job achieving that."

Land, Buildings and Real Estate
Calling the subject "everybody's favorite,"
Hume said the board was operating on a simple
principle in managing the
University's capital projects.
"The watchword for this year is
slower and cheaper," she said.
$1.3 billion in projects was
either suspended, delayed or can
celed last year.
"Construction on this campus
is slowing down, although I have
to say, as a parenthetical, when
you look at all the construction
going on, it's hard to believe,"
Hume said.
Hume said the board approved
five projects at various stages this
week. They are: concept and site
approval for the Jill and John
Freidenrich Center for Translational
Research, final construction approval

for the Knight Management Center,
the project and construction phase for
"fit-up" for The Center for Nanoscale
Science and Technology, final con
struction approval for the Huang
Engineering Center, and then con
cept and site approval for the SLAC
National Acceleration Laboratory
Research Support Building and
Infrastructure Modernization project.

The Board will be holding its
April meeting at Yale University.
"We want to get the trustees out of
this room," Hume said. "We're in
this room all the time."

The board will be examining
Yale's residential education model,
prominent and prestigious arts pro
grams and schools, and their efforts
to send students overseas.
