## Judicial players hint at policy change Twenty-six apply for board seats in third attempt to choose student representatives 
### ELIZABETH TITUS TOM CORRIGAN 
With the Board of Judicial Affairs
still absent any student representatives
as the controversy over its makeup
enters week four of the school year,
ASSU leaders said they are reviewing
26 student applications to the board in
what is essentially a do-over for the leg
islative body.
Meanwhile, no one will say publicly
how many female nominees would satis
fy all involved the Office of Judicial
Affairs, the Undergraduate Senate and
the Graduate Student Council —or
whether the four nominees who weren't
explicitly removed from the board last
month are guaranteed spots now.
Also unclear are the exact concerns
that prompted the scuttle over gender
balance on the board and whether more
far-reaching policy changes are on the
horizon, as some close to the situation
have hinted this week.
Five men and one woman were ini
tially nominated to the board last spring
after being vetted by the ASSU
Nominations Commission, but two of
the men's names were soon rescinded
after the Office of Judicial Affairs, which
is overseen by the board, objected to the
imbalanced gender ratio. Two more
women were nominated in their place.
Judicial Affairs Officer Morris
Graves explained the pressure in an
email to The Daily at the time.
"The Board on Judicial Affairs needs
to be reflective of the Stanford commu
nity," Graves said. "The original slate
offered by NomCom did not reflect the
diversity of the Stanford community.
Specifically, there was a gender imbal
ance,"
On Oct. 1, the Graduate Student
Council rejected the revised slate, and
last week Undergraduate Senate Chair
Varun Sivaram 'll appointed three sen
ators to an ad hoc committee to re-select
all six student representatives to the
board, starting with an ostensibly blank
slate interview process.
The committee, in total, includes
Senators Kelsei Wharton 'l2, Zachary
Warma 'll and Sivaram himself; GSC
representatives Chair Eric Osborn, a
law student, Jessica Tsai from the School
of Medicine and Bryan Chen, a biology
graduate; and Michael Tubbs 'l2 of the
Executive Diversity and Tolerance

Committee this according
to Warma, also columns edi-

tor for The Daily.
Shortly after the
Oct. 11 deadline
for applica-

tions in this
new round,
Nominations
Commission

Chair Jonathan Bakke, a graduate in
chemical engineering, told The Daily 26
people had applied.
No one has publicly confirmed or
denied that the four nominees who
retained their seats this summer would
be guaranteed spots now. One of those
four, Nate Chambers, a fourth year com
puter science doctoral student, said he is
"definitely in limbo."
Warma said interviews will start
Thursday.
Spokespeople for the Office of
Judicial Affairs offered some defense of
their request to put more women on the
board that sets policy for their office, but
declined to respond to other questions.
"Both the Office of Judicial Affairs
and the Nominations Commission acted
in good faith to try to identify a slate of
student BJA members who represent a
broad range of perspectives," spokes
people wrote in an email last week. "The
OJA agrees with the Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council
that clearer guidelines and communica
tion in the selection process should be
developed."
Comments from Chambers suggest
that concerns about how sexual assault
cases are handled in the Stanford
Judicial Affairs system may have
sparked the gender-balance issue.
"It has been brought by the [Sexual
Violence Advisory Board] of the
University that we should look into how
sexual misconduct cases are handled,"
Chambers said.
And both Chambers and Sivaram
hinted that future policy changes may
be on the horizon for the Judicial Affairs
process, or at least how sexual assault
cases are heard.

"It appears that we may be making
decisions about changing how cases that
involve sexual misconduct, sexual
assault, rape, these kinds of things, are

heard," Chambers said. "Currently,
these cases go before panels, and it
has been proposed that perhaps we
make them a little more private,"
Sivaram echoed that suggestion.
"The ASSU is in the works of
talking about amending the way stu
dents see and interact with Judicial
Affairs," he said.
Meanwhile, the Office of Judicial
Affairs did not respond specifically to
a request to justify intervening in the
board selection process.
Sivaram maintained that the
office's intervention was improper,
prompting the do-over this week.
"We don't recognize the office's
right to demand that we change our
nomination slate; they don't have
that power," Sivaram said. "It's possi
ble that the Nominations
Commission just did not understand
that their authority over the issue
should not have been affected by the
Office of Judicial Affairs' concern.

"The conclusion has been, let's
just start the process anew," he con
tinued. "With the completely clean
slate, it's going to be much easier to
make decisions."
But, pressed to answer whether
the ad hoc committee could simply
arrive at the same nominees as
NomCom originally did, Sivaram did
not explicitly say.
"All we want to do is take out the
potential influence that an external
body had on the selection of the
slate," he said.
Entering the fourth straight week
of Judicial Affairs wrangling, Sivaram
concluded that the issue does indeed
matter to students.
"It's true that the proportion of
students who will have an interaction
with the judicial affairs panel or with
the policy made by the Board of
Judicial Affairs is small," he said.
"But, to those students, it can make a
world of difference what the policies
are and what the makeup of the
board is."

Comments from Chambers suggest
that concerns about how sexual assault
cases are handled in the Stanford
Judicial Affairs system may have
sparked the gender-balance issue.
"It has been brought by the [Sexual
Violence Advisory Board] of the
University that we should look into how
sexual misconduct cases are handled,"
Chambers said.
And both Chambers and Sivaram
hinted that future policy changes may
be on the horizon for the Judicial Affairs
process, or at least how sexual assault
cases are heard.

"It appears that we may be making
decisions about changing how cases that
involve sexual misconduct, sexual
assault, rape, these kinds of things, are

heard," Chambers said. "Currently,
these cases go before panels, and it
has been proposed that perhaps we
make them a little more private,"
Sivaram echoed that suggestion.
"The ASSU is in the works of
talking about amending the way stu
dents see and interact with Judicial
Affairs," he said.
Meanwhile, the Office of Judicial
Affairs did not respond specifically to
a request to justify intervening in the
board selection process.
Sivaram maintained that the
office's intervention was improper,
prompting the do-over this week.
"We don't recognize the office's
right to demand that we change our
nomination slate; they don't have
that power," Sivaram said. "It's possi
ble that the Nominations
Commission just did not understand
that their authority over the issue
should not have been affected by the
Office of Judicial Affairs' concern.

"The conclusion has been, let's
just start the process anew," he con
tinued. "With the completely clean
slate, it's going to be much easier to
make decisions."
But, pressed to answer whether
the ad hoc committee could simply
arrive at the same nominees as
NomCom originally did, Sivaram did
not explicitly say.
"All we want to do is take out the
potential influence that an external
body had on the selection of the
slate," he said.
Entering the fourth straight week
of Judicial Affairs wrangling, Sivaram
concluded that the issue does indeed
matter to students.
"It's true that the proportion of
students who will have an interaction
with the judicial affairs panel or with
the policy made by the Board of
Judicial Affairs is small," he said.
"But, to those students, it can make a
world of difference what the policies
are and what the makeup of the
board is."
