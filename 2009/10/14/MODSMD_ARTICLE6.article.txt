## Panelists: Judicial system matters A 						look at role of board, office, panelists reveals a complex bureaucracy; 'important,' say members 
### TOM CORRIGAN 
For the 120 or so students
accused of violating Stanford's
Fundamental Standard or Honor
Code every year, few things could
seem more important than the stu
dents, faculty members and
University staff who, together,
decide their fate in the limbo known
as Judicial Affairs.
Now, the weeks-long controversy
surrounding this year's nominations
to the Board of Judicial Affairs has
raised questions about the role,
responsibilities and makeup of the
group and the Judicial Affairs
process in general questions even
those involved are quick to acknowl
edge.
"It seems like there is a real lack
of education and a real lack of
knowledge about the judicial sys
tem" said Nate Chambers, a fourth
year doctoral student in computer
science whose background with
Judicial Affairs includes having
served on the panel that judges
accused students and, where viola
tions are found, metes out punish
ments like suspensions, expulsions or
delayed degree conferrals.
"I think for any community, let
alone Stanford University, it's
important to have a fair judicial

process, it's important to value the
judicial process, and it's important to
value ethical and moral behavior,"
Chambers said. Chambers was an
original nominee to this year's
board, which is now being redrawn
after a second application process
set to wrap this week.
The process arbitrating the "ethi
cal and moral behavior" Chambers
described is run by a three-part
bureaucracy: a pool of judicial pan
elists, like Chambers was; the board,
now temporarily empty of student
representatives following this quar
ter's maneuvers; and the Office of
Judicial Affairs (OJA).
A panel of four students and two
faculty or staff, selected from the
larger pool, hears each case of stu
dents accused of violating the Honor
Code or Fundamental Standard and
decides their punishment, called
sanctions. Panelists heard 120 such
cases in the last academic year.
Members of the board, mean
while, set judicial policy for the pan
elists and oversee the OJA. Fifteen
people six students, six faculty
and three administrators typically
make up the board.
The OJA, serving as the adminis-
trative backbone of the system, is
staffed by full-time professionals.
During hearings, which can last
four hours or longer, panelists
review case details, evaluate circum
stances and determine whether the
student is responsible for a violation
of the Honor Code or Fundamental
Standard.
Today, some students and faculty
who have served as panelists say the
process works.
"The fact that panels have a
majority of students and that the
panels are always chaired by stu
dents is a very good thing," said judi-

cial panelist and linguistics professor
emeritus Stanley Peters. "This shows
that there is a kind of seriousness of
purpose about academic integrity
that the Stanford student body
accepts wholeheartedly."
Panelist Tommy Tobin TO echoed
Peters' affirmation of the process.
"The Board on Judicial Affairs is an
unsung player in the campus com
munity" Tobin said. "In some senses,
they have the responsibility to make
sure that the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code are living, adapt
able documents."
Chambers added, however, that
he wants to initiate a conversation as
to whether or not the Judicial Affairs
process is serving any sort of educa
tional purpose, noting that he is
interested in why students break the
honor code.

"I wanted to be on the board
because I wanted to actually dis
cuss these issues of how these stu
dents get into these situations in
the first place, and discuss ques
tions of whether the current judi
cial process, the current sanctions,
are actually serving an educational
aspect to the system," Chambers
said.
In an email to The Daily, spokes
people for the Office of Judicial
Affairs said "one of the most impor
tant things students should know
about the Judicial Affairs process is
that it is intended to be educational
that we help students learn from
the circumstances that brought them
to our office,"
