## Panelists: Judicial system matters A

### TOM CORRIGAN 
For the 120 or so students
accused of violating Stanford's
Fundamental Standard or Honor
Code every year, few things could
seem more important than the stu
dents, faculty members and
University staff who, together,
decide their fate in the limbo known
as Judicial Affairs.
Now, the weeks-long controversy
surrounding this year's nominations
to the Board of Judicial Affairs has
raised questions about the role,
responsibilities and makeup of the
group and the Judicial Affairs
process in general questions even
those involved are quick to acknowl
edge.
"It seems like there is a real lack
of education and a real lack of
knowledge about the judicial sys
tem" said Nate Chambers, a fourth
year doctoral student in computer
science whose background with
Judicial Affairs includes having
served on the panel that judges
accused students and, where viola
tions are found, metes out punish
ments like suspensions, expulsions or
delayed degree conferrals.
"I think for any community, let
alone Stanford University, it's
important to have a fair judicial

process, it's important to value the
judicial process, and it's important to
value ethical and moral behavior,"
Chambers said. Chambers was an
original nominee to this year's
board, which is now being redrawn
after a second application process
set to wrap this week.
The process arbitrating the "ethi
cal and moral behavior" Chambers
described is run by a three-part
bureaucracy: a pool of judicial pan
elists, like Chambers was; the board,
now temporarily empty of student
representatives following this quar
ter's maneuvers; and the Office of
Judicial Affairs (OJA).
A panel of four students and two
faculty or staff, selected from the
larger pool, hears each case of stu
dents accused of violating the Honor
Code or Fundamental Standard and
decides their punishment, called
sanctions. Panelists heard 120 such
cases in the last academic year.
Members of the board, mean
while, set judicial policy for the pan
elists and oversee the OJA. Fifteen
people six students, six faculty
and three administrators typically
make up the board.
The OJA, serving as the adminis-
