## WET AND WILD: A DAY AT THE BIKE SHOP 
### JEN PITTMAN 
t must be lunch time," Chris
Wiscavage, manager of the Campus
Bike Shop, commented in an under
tone to one of the mechanics as he
M glanced at the large group of stu
dents congregating in the store.
From 11:50 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on days during
the school week, a line of students becomes a fix
ture in the shop, especially once bad weather hits.
Tuesday was no exception.
Students stood in a ragged line either clutching
rear fenders or wheeling in bicycles, which had
begun to make a variety of screeching and creak
ing sounds during the rainstorm.
One student, wet blond hair plastered to her
face, chewed her lip anxiously while waiting for
Omar Barba, a bicycle mechanic, to finish signing
out a rental so he could take a look at her bike.

"My bike is making a weird noise," she said
with a hint of desperation when he finally turned
around towards her.
After a few spins of the back tire on her bicy
cle, Barba located the problem. Mud and silt had
become stuck around the frame of her tire, caus
ing it to make a creaking sound. Using the air
compressor typically intended to fill tires with air,
Barba began to clean off her tires.
While Barba finished cleaning the engrained
mud from the tires, his fellow mechanic, Jim
Chaskin, began speaking with Kasonni Scales 'lO
about her bicycle emergency.
Scales explained to Chaskin that when she was
leaving her dorm she heard strange noises from
her bicycle but she chose to ignore them and con
tinued riding while balancing her umbrella on the
handlebars. Suddenly her bike lurched and she
almost went over the handlebars.
"I just messed up my bike," Scales asserted. "I
think it's my back brake."

Chaskin glanced at the bicycle and quickly
assessed the situation.
"Your wheel just fell out," he said.
"See, I have no idea what I'm looking at, to be
honest," Scales said, staring with slight confusion
at the tire Chaskin had gestured at.
But to Chaskin this was no problem. The wheel
was quickly adjusted along with Scales' brakes,
and the bicycle was ready to roll out of the store in
two minutes.
As Scales began to shuffle past the line of other
students with her now functioning bicycle Chaskin
cheerfully called, "Good luck back in the fray!"
Before Scales had even rolled her bike out,
Wiscavage was analyzing another bicycle at the
front of the store.
Alex Hoffer 'l3 was explaining how he had
returned a few minutes ago to the bike rack out
side of the Campus Bike Shop to find his bike was
no longer working properly.
"It was parked at the bike rack and someone

had their way with your wheel," Wiscavage stated
solemnly while fellow employees and students
cracked smiles around the shop.
But the humor quickly passed when a distinct
cry of pain from the back of the shop caused a
number of students to twist their heads, attempt
ing to distinguish if any serious injuries had
occurred.
"Is everyone back there all right?" asked a
mechanic going over some new inventory.
"Don't ask that question," Barba said with a
chuckle, "Usually that just means someone is hav
ing a good time."
Dripping students gradually streamed past the
U-Lock decorated wall and out of the bike shop.
Barba finished another quick repair and glanced
around the now empty store.
"I suppose it is safe for me to take a lunch
break now," he said with satisfaction.
