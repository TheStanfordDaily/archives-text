# Stanford flips out over the Flipside

Â£ r -yame your favorite ele-
I ment!" a Stanford
I Flipside staff member
I barked at a freshman
entering the room.
"Cobalt, of course," answered the stoic
new member, without pausing in the jour
ney to his chair.
The meeting commenced with Jeremy
Keeshin 'l2, president and founder of the
Stanford Flipside, greeting each new per
son with a handshake and a different
"What is your favorite...?" question.
Not originally established at Stanford,
the satirical newsletter Flipside was found
ed by Keeshin while he was still in high
school. Since then, it has grown to include
independent Flipsides around the country,
including newsletters at Northwestern
University and the University of Southern
California. At each campus, the Flipside
has humor relevant to its location.
At Stanford, the newsletter can be
found in dorms and cafeterias and also has

content online. Additional content
includes spoof radio shows, fake magazine
articles and funny videos, along with away
to submit answers to the clever puzzles
found on the back of the weekly newslet
ter.
"Ours is satirical news about current
events on campus and current events in the
United States," Keeshin said. "But it is def
initely in the news format as opposed to
essays or stories."
Tliis autumn, the Stanford Flipside is
entering its second year of publication on
campus. Every Tuesday night at Old
Union, they hold meetings to generate
ideas for future articles and parody news
radio shows.
Although it was the third meeting of the
year, the new members were given a short
introduction to the idea behind Flipside.
"The whole philosophy with this is that
it is short so people can read it," Keeshin
explained while pointing to the most
recent edition. "And it comes out often, so
it is current."
Eric Karpas 'l2, secretary of state for

the Flipside, elaborated on the group's
purpose.
"It's just funny pointing out some con
tradiction or something that makes us
laugh or makes other people laugh," he
explained. "And hopefully we can all laugh
about things together."
After a brief introduction to the
Flipside, the members were broken up into
small groups consisting of six new writers
and one veteran writer to brainstorm arti
cle ideas for the next issue of Flipside.
Students pulled out laptops and
searched various news sites, especially The
Stanford Daily, to look for current events
that could be topics for new articles.
Once someone proposed a new topic,
everyone in the small group suggested
potential headlines for the story, the best of
which would be presented in front of the
entire group. Afterwards, the most interest
ing ones were slotted as articles that writers
could choose for the next week.
One might expect a sense of competi
tion between the younger Flipside and the
more established iiumor magazine on cam

pus, the Stanford Chaparral. The Chappie,
however, denied any competition between
the two publications. Keeshin disagreed.
"I was threatened by some of the
Chappie guys [wielding] a sledgehammer,"
he explained. "I think it was just a bad
joke."
The Flipside believes that the Chaparral
feels intimidated by their existence, and
perhaps for good reason. Many students
around campus have been discussing the
humorous content found in the Flipside,
such as a recent "Stern goes plateless" pho
tograph.
Many students find the Flipside's ironic
wit entertaining.
"For a second I thought it was true," said
Kelly Marren 'l3. "And then I realized that
there was no way that it could be."
Karpas would agree with this student's
assessment, reiterating the Flipside's over
arching goal: "Really, we're just joking and
shouldn't be taken seriously by anyone."
