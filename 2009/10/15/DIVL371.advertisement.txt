MACQUARIE

2010 Graduate Opportunities in the US
In 1813 Governor Macquarie created the 'Holey Dollar' which solved an acute
currency shortage and created a flourishing economy in Australia. And all by
punching a smaller coin out of the larger one, instantly doubling the money
supply. It's this sort of innovative thinking we encourage at Macquarie.
Macquarie is a global provider of banking, financial, advisory, investment
and funds management services, with more than 12,500 employees in 26
countries. Macquarie's reputation for spotting extraordinary opportunities
and developing people into outstanding business leaders has led to a highly
successful business.
We have graduate opportunities in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Houston and Miami and believe in offering our graduates the chance to
make a real contribution to our business from day one. We seek motivated,
independent thinkers, whose talent and initiative will drive our future growth. If
you are up to the challenge, you may very well be our next big thing.
