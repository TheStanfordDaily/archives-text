White male, late 20's or early 30's, 6-0
tall, approx. 200 lbs. heavy
build but not fat, unshaven, short light
colored hair, dark
complexion, last seen wearing a
maroon hooded sweatshirt (not
Cardinal red), and baggy blue jeans or
pants. Another witness
thought the suspect had slightly longer
hair than illustrated in the
sketch and also possibly with a goatee.
On Monday morning, 10-12-09, between about 7:45-8:30 AM, a male suspect
was seen peeping into occupied showers in two women's bathrooms in Sterling
Quad - First in the 3 rd floor bathroom of Adams House, then a few minutes later
on the 2 nd floor of Robinson House.
The suspect was chased out of Robinson House by a female victim, whom he
ran into and knocked against the wall as he fled (she was not injured). A witness
from Lyman Houses saw the suspect possibly get into a white colored work van
with no windows on the sides, a blue ladder on a roof rack, and it is unknown if it
had any logos or writing on the sides.
