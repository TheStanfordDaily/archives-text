## UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE Cicero's Long Lost Letter 
### Emily Hulme 
Dear Atticus,

Oh my Jupiter, Illusions was crazy last
night! And the worst of it is that
Gaius's artist friend was there, and
I'm going to show up in his next has relief. I'll
definitely have to de-tag that.
After I got back to my domicile, I passed
out and had the most horrible dream (be
sides the one I told you about where Caesar
became dictator AND rationed cheese). In it,
I woke up one day in the future, and every
thing had gone from benignly tacky to
painfully absurd. I was distant from any sem
blance of civilization, and surrounded by ab
solute barbarians speaking some Gothic
tongue. The lack of public baths is only one
example of their thorough dirtiness.
I wandered around a city filled with the
tallest temples I'd ever seen, with facades pol
ished more brightly than the finest marble
sculptures from Athens. The air smelled foul.
Some people offered me a couple denarii
thinking I was a street performer like those
Dacian gypsies by the Forum. Eventually,
some brute spotted me and asked if I wanted
to buy Knicks tickets. I declined, and asked
him how to get home. He only knew Italia as
"that place with the pizza and gladiators,"
asked me if I knew the Pope and then directed
me to the nearest Olive Garden restaurant.
I found this eatery, and offered to pay one
sesterce and/or a pair of breeding geese for
endless breadsticks. The dully pretty woman
at the front gave me a quizzical look. She
called her manager, a portly man with a re
ceding hairline reminiscent of my own. Once
they figured out who I was, though, the
friendly philistines offered a free meal if only
I wrote a four hundred word history of Rome
for the back of their menus. Words longer
than three syllables were forbidden.
Here is what I wrote, after another patron
edited it to make it somewhat more up to
date by adding appropriate punctuation, re
moving all references to "Gaul" or "morali
ty" and so on:
BENVENUTI/WILKOMMEN A
ROMA! A whimsical land filled with more
magic than even the latest Sky Mall catalog
lies beyond the Atlantic in Italy, but, for $5.99
plus tax, you can sample the glory of Rome in
your own backyard! The Roman people were
a dedicated bunch of farmer-soldiers who

glamorized a man's virtus (goodness) above
all. Its founding story, however, is a little
darker than you might expect for the Caput
Mundi (cap of the mound). Romulus, leg
endary first king of Rome, actually was raised
by a lupa (either a she-wolf or a prostitute)
and killed his brother for impishly jumping
over a city wall. Then, because being king of
the seven hills ain't any fun alone, he invited
other cities' leftovers (crooks, exiles, Celine
Dion) to join his village. After a while, the
guys got sick of watching "Entourage" and
playing football, but somehow couldn't at
tract females to their city (this was before the
invention of Axe in 1453). So, they went to
the nearby Sabines and kidnapped a gaggle
of their women.
Fast-forward a couple hundred years, and
the last Etruscanus (Canadian) king of
Rome, Tarquin the Proud, was booted after
his son turned out to be a douche. Rome
slowly gained power and developed world
historical innovations such as arches, con
crete and the tuba. Eventually, the charming
Gracchi brothers emerged as populist lead
ers about four centuries after the founding of
the Republic. They might have been good
consulares (presidents), but tried to pass uni
versal health care, leading to their eventual
demise, even though Gaius Gracchus was an
"electrifying speaker" and won the Nobel
Peace Prize, Senators in Rome continued to
angle for power by earning military acco
lades after preemptive strikes against Parthi
ans hiding triremes of mass destruction in the
middle of the Arabian Desert. Finally, Rome
was blessed with an upstanding politician,
the renowned Marcus Tullius Cicero, who
fought for all the right causes and never had
sex with interns. Bon Apetit, and sign up on
line for our mailing list to receive a coupon
for a free II Mudslido next time!
I know, it's ridiculous that I would write
such a thing. Who would call the Gracchi
"charming"? Anyway, I hear you'll be hitting
up Capri this weekend. Don't forget the
Franzia. Psych!

Pax, amor et vino,
MTC
