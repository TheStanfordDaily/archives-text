# FLECHAS Y PEDRADAS
## When in Rome ... or Something 
### Patrick Kozey 
This past weekend, my roommate and
some friends of ours went to Rome. I
didn't.
I waited to ask about the trip until all who
had taken part were assembled around our ex
cuse for a dinner table (it's small and awk
wardly attached to the headboard of my bed).
They rattled off a list of sights seen, creepy
groping-related encounters endured and
fights almost had. Mostly they talked about
the exhaustion about the fact that even
when they had been taking breaks, they'd
talked so much and slept so little, that they
were completely drained. Monuments came
out like a grocery list, and at the end of it, when
the inevitable, "And how was your weekend? "
came, I sat, tired as they were, just trying to get
a handle on it.
I didn't have much to say. I said I'd been out
all four nights of the long weekend, what I'd
eaten, where I'd drunk and who made up the
rotating cast of characters I accompanied.
Needless to say, I don't think it impressed
them. It certainly didn't impress me what
bar am I supposed to pull out to top the Sistine
Chapel?
When I dozed off that night, I realized I did
see a monument that weekend after all.
Late Sunday night, early Monday morning,
I was sitting with a female friend of mine and
two others. They were a couple, a guy from my
program and his wait for it Spanish girl
friend. I know, we were all impressed too. The
third was a girl from the program who'd come
out to meet the girlfriend for the first time. We
were in a bar off Las Ramblas, L'ovella Negra,
I think it was called, which means Black Sheep
in Catalan. Where most bars I'd seen
tried hard to exude "chic," this one had em
braced "beer hall." To prove it, they served
pitchers. Accordingly, it followed many of the
rules of such bars anywhere in the world.
Games? Pool table, check. Tables packed
more than should be possible? I had to sit on a
fireplace for a while, so check. Signs of over-in
toxication? If the rowdiness wasn't enough,
the increasing levels of vomit in the urinals in
the men's room based on proximity to the
door sure were. We saw all this, and we talked
through it. We spoke about culture and histo
ry, we switched languages and topics. We did
all this through three hours, a pitcher of San
gria, a pitcher of beer, and we never felt tired.
Around 2:50 a.m., they began to kick us
out, as Spanish bars are wont to do, though
here they turned the lights off, rather than on.
We and others spilled out into the alley where
the bouncers shushed us and sent us toward
the main street. We wandered down it, headed
toward the sea.

Las Ramblas is the kind of street that trans
forms from day to night drastically. By day,

it's the cliched European thoroughfare: mov
ing statues and junk hawking vendors. They
used to sell a lot of birds, but apparently they
increase the danger of pandemic flu out
breaks. By night, I like to think it's what Times
Square must have been like before Giuliani,
but with a nightly power washing: comfortably
illicit. As we walked down it, we smirked at the
immigrant men selling beer they stashed in
the folded up umbrellas of newsstands, who
occasionally responded to a "no" with a "well,
would you possibly care for some hash?"
We were looking for a club, something that
would let us stay out for a few more hours, an
other drink. Sadly, the closest we got were
places advertising live naked girls, or places
whose flyers were being handed out by men in
costume. You'll be wise to avoid anything
handed out by a man in face paint after mid
night. So, we wandered, speaking more as I
toyed with the idea of smoking a cigarette.
Why was this a long weekend again? The
Spanish girl had some notion of a day dedicat
ed to the new world, and we spoke about
Columbus Day. We kept walking.
At the end of Las Ramblas is la Placa de
Colon. In its center, a monument to Cristobal
Colon, Christopher Columbus rather, looking
out past the port where he embarked. I'd
never made it a point to celebrate Columbus,
but it was his holiday after all, so my friends
and I raised our proverbial glasses. Then we
walked home.
I still haven't seen the Sistine Chapel, and it
may turn out that I never will. But I've been on
that street on that night.
I knew then what I should have told my
friends returning from their Roman venture:
sometimes that is enough.

Patrick Kozey has trouble noticing when he
needs to shut up. Tell him, "Yes! Enough al
ready," or, "No, maybe keep going a little
longer," at pkozey@stanford. edu.

I still haven't seen
the Sistine Chapel,
and it may turn that
I never will.
