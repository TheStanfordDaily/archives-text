# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

To the editor:

Erica Morgan's column is entitled "Get it
Right." Ms. Morgan ought to follow her own
advice rather than fill The Daily with erro
neous information.

In her Oct. 14 diatribe against Obama's
awarding of the Nobel Prize, Ms. Morgan
writes that "Erik Brandt nominated Hitler"
for the Nobel Peace Prize, making her "ques
tion whether there is any honor in the award
at all."

Erik Brandt was a member of the
Swedish parliament who despised Nazi Ger
many. He nominated Hitler in 1939 as a
hoax, protesting other parliamentarians'
nomination of Neville Chamberlain. His
nomination letter sarcastically praises Hitler
for "his past record of solving conflicts by
peaceful means, without spilling blood, with

Austria freely coming a part of Germany."
Brandt formally retracted his nomination
four days later.

Much of the article's background on the
Nobel Peace Prize appears to have been
copied from a Wikipedia page. The article
also misstates the amount of energy that A1
Gore uses in his home.

This work is indefensibly sloppy and does
its readers a disservice. Why isn't The Daily
fact-checking its content?

Re. "Questions surround Judicial Af
fairs," Oct. 14, 2009

I do not agree with Mr. Corrigan's use of

the phrase:"... the limbo known as Judicial
Affairs." In fact, I find it offensive. The volun
teers and professionals involved with the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs put in a lot of time and
effort into this process. While it takes a long
time to adjudicate the process, I would not
equate it with limbo, especially as responding
students are in regular communication with
the Office of Judicial Affairs. Professional
staff meet with these students. Students can
also take advantage of support people and
Judicial Counselors, experienced volunteers
who can walk them through the judicial ex
perience. Phrases like this hurt the process
and seem out of place with the positive tone
and overall idea of the article.
