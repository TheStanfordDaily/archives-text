## BACK AT HOME Stanford field hockey returns home to take on UC-Davis 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After its fourth shutout of the year, the Stan
ford field hockey team will face off against UC-
Davis this Saturday in one of the team's final
matches of the season. After the 3-0 win over
Pacific on Sunday, the Cardinal is now 11-2
overall and 3-1 in the league. The Cardinal
racked up 29 shot attempts on Sunday, its sea
son high. The number seems especially high
when compared to Pacific's measly two. The
Davis game will mark Stanford's second home
game in its past 11 overall, and the first in over
three weeks. Although Stanford dominated
Davis earlier this year with a score of 5-1, the
Cardinal women are not complacent and know
they need to constantly bring their best game.
The next two games for the Cardinal
against Davis and California are in league

play and will determine the league standings
and position for postseason play. After losing
to Cal earlier this season by a score of 4-3, the
women will double their efforts to ensure a
Stanford win over their biggest rivals.
''The upcoming league play is a very im
portant stretch for us," said senior Midori Ue
hara. "Winning the regular-season conference
title is key to setting ourselves up for the post
season we're very focused on our game and
we are taking the remainder of the season day
by day, practice by practice."

Senior Nora Soza further asserted that
league play is one of the most important parts
of the season.

"Our next games against Cal and UC-
Davis will be pivotal for top seeding during
the conference tournament," she said. "Our
win against Pacific only further sharpens our
swords in the great battle for conference

champions."
One of the keys to the upcoming games will
be the play of freshman Becky Dru, who was
just named NorPac Rookie of the Week for
the second week in a row. Dru earned this
honor again after scoring her seventh goal of
the year in the match against Pacific.
"Becky has become a key player on our
team by being a pivotal distributor on the field
and scoring on corners," senior Rachel Bush
said. "She has a great sense of the field and
what the next move should be it's been
great to play with her this year, and I know
she'll be a big contributor in making this team
go far."

Stanford and UC-Davis face off Saturday
at 1 p.m. at the Varsity Turf.
