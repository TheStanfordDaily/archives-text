At six-foot-six, it's kind of hard to miss Hayley
Spelman, one of the freshman stars of the
Stanford women's volleyball team. She's the
tallest player on the team, though "only by

Spelman was the Cardinal's top recruit this year in
women's volleyball. As a senior at Durango High in
Las Vegas, Nev., she was the third-ranked recruit in the
country. After being courted by a number of programs,
Spelman decided to play for Stanford because, in her
words, "I just fell in love with the campus. They had a

Spelman has seen considerable playing time for the
