# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## BIG HITTER 
### KABIR SAWHNEY 
At six-foot-six, it's kind of hard to miss Hayley
Spelman, one of the freshman stars of the
Stanford women's volleyball team. She's the
tallest player on the team, though "only by
an inch," she says.
Spelman was the Cardinal's top recruit this year in
women's volleyball. As a senior at Durango High in
Las Vegas, Nev., she was the third-ranked recruit in the
country. After being courted by a number of programs,
Spelman decided to play for Stanford because, in her
words, "I just fell in love with the campus. They had a
great volleyball program, and I really loved the coach
es. It just seemed ideal."
Spelman has seen considerable playing time for the
Cardinal this season as an outside hitter on the right
side. She has appeared in every one of Stanford's
matches, playing in 39 sets and registering 57 kills. Spel
man is also in the serve/receive rotation, where she has
recorded two aces so far this season.
"My personal goal is to come in with a positive atti
tude and improve every day, so I can help my team,"
she said.

"I just fell in love with the
campus. They had a great
volleyball program, and I really
loved the coaches. It just
seemed ideal."

She also said that the team has high hopes for the
remainder of this season winning the Pac-10 confer
ence and then a national championship.
"Beating Washington proves that we can accom
plish those goals," Spelman said. "[The win] really
showed that we're a good team, a top team."
Spelman said that while playing for Stanford has
been a lot of fun, it's also brought its
share of difficulties and obstacles.

"I think every freshman encoun
ters frustrations when they start
playing college ball," she said.
"That's just what you have to deal
with. You can either see those as ob
stacles or opportunities to get better.
I'm trying to see it as an opportunity
to improve my game."
Some of the areas Spelman looks
to improve are hitting around blocks,
hitting higher and snapping over the
ball.

While it may be a long way away,
Spelman said that she might want to
continue her volleyball career after
Stanford. "I really don't know what I
want to do, but it could be really cool
if I could play overseas after my col
lege career."
Spelman attributed a lot of her
success to the team around her.

"I've really been getting better
because our whole team is so posi
tive, persistent and competitive," she
said. "I've been getting better be
cause they've been great and awe
some to train with. I think everything
feeds off each other. I wouldn't be
getting better if it weren't for my
teammates, and the coaches have
also been really great."

As the Cardinal continues its 2009
campaign, Spelman is sure to figure
prominently in this year's title run
and will be a centerpiece of Stanford
women's volleyball for years to
come.
