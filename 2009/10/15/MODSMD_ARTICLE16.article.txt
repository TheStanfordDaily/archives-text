# American sports should emulate U.K.
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I can't think of anything more
American than Microsoft.
As the legend goes, Bill
Gates, without even a col
lege degree to his name, built the
foundations for what was to be
come one of the biggest and most
successful companies in the
world. This might be a little bit of
an exaggeration, but still, with a
lot of hard work he set up a busi
ness from scratch that would go
on to dominate the world com
puter industry, and arguably
shape the course of human histo
ry.

I can't think of anything less-
American than baseball, or foot
ball, or hockey, or basketball.
Now, before the Department
of Homeland Security and INS
come knocking on my door, let
me explain this attack on the four
cornerstone sports that run
through the American psyche.

The big U.S. leagues are all
franchisee!. That means the teams
in those leagues will always be in
those leagues. They are the aris
tocracy of sports: big, rich and
powerful, and most importantly,
ensured their place by birthright.
If they have a bad season, or ten,
it doesn't matter; they are still
guaranteed their piece of a very
big pie.

The only way to win any of
these leagues is to buy one of
these teams. That means you
have to be rich. Very rich. Hard
work counts for nothing.
Since moving to the United
States, I've learned to appreciate
several sports that are rather
alien to me. I'd probably now rate
the NCAA basketball tourna
ment, though almost unknown
abroad, as one of the highlights of
world sports for its fiercely intense
competition packed into just a
handful of weeks, and I'm even
getting the taste for, and reason
able understanding of, college
football.

But the one thing that still
drives me crazy is the very concept
of the franchises. To put it bluntly,
it's just not fair.
There are 32 teams in the NFL,
but 50 states in the Union. Mathe
matically, therefore, there are mil
lions of people without a local
team. Not only is their city not rep
resented, but their entire state is
left out in the cold. In fact, 25 states
have no major sports team.
If I were a football-loving Mon
tanan, why would I even consider
supporting the Seattle Seahawks
or Denver Broncos, technically my
closest NFL teams, though thou
sands of miles away? I certainly
wouldn't make it to many home
games.

The situation back in England
couldn't be more different. There
are 92 professional soccer teams in
the Premier League and Football
League. Add to this the 68 semi

professional teams in the Football
Conference and the potentially
1,000 or more amateur teams in a
whole host of divisions below.

There might be similar lower
league teams for U.S. sports, but
the real difference is that every
one of these divisions is linked.
The entire hierarchy is a ladder,
where each year the best teams are
promoted, and the worst demoted.
What this really means is that
however big and important the
top teams might get, they are al
ways vulnerable. They cannot
have a really bad season and get
away with it. No team is special,
and recent history has lived up to
this, with many previously huge
teams languishing far from the top
flight.

That might sound like a bad
thing, and it obviously doesn't go
down well with fans of troubled
clubs, but the flipside is fantastic.
Every city, every town, every
village has a team. And, come the
start of the season, every fan has
hope. Hope that this year their
team will go up, and that in a few
years, with steady progress, they
might reach the dizzying heights of
the Premiership, and even win it.
It also means that whoever you
are, rich or poor, if you can find 11
players, a patch of grass to play on
and a ball, you too can start your

own team. And, though the odds
are stacked against you, who
knows, with a lot of hard work,
maybe one day you'll make it to
the top.
I might be a foreigner here, but
that to me is what the "American
Dream" is all about.

Would the big teams here ever
give up their franchise powers and
agree to something that could ef
fectively destroy their own status?
Probably not.
But maybe, just maybe, when I
come back to visit Stanford when
I'm grey and old, I'll be there to see
Palo Alto win the NBA Finals.

Tom Taylor actually had the guts to say
the NFL should be more like soccer.
Tell him which football you prefer at
