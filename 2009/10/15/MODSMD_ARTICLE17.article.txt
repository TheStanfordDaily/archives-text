# Confronting the fake sports fans
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Last Sunday was awesome. As
a lucky friend of Atlanta Fal
cons' offensive coordinator
Mike Mularkey's family, I
was able to be on the field at Candle
stick Park before and after the 49ers-
Falcons game, shake the hand of Fal
cons' owner and billionaire Arthur
Blank and witness firsthand the
domination of Falcons wide receiver
Roddy White, who just so happens to
be an integral part of my infamous
fantasy team, "Faith in the Bears."
But what really captured my at
tention during the 45-10 devastation
that brought 49ers fans to the brink
of insanity imploring head coach
Mike Singletary to give former first
round bust Alex Smith a shot
took place not on the field, but in the
stands. It was both eye-opening and
comforting, a phenomenon I have
rarely encountered over my years.
See, sitting next to me in section
seven were a guy and a girl, clearly on
a first date. My man had the right
idea taking a girl to a fairly expen
sive and occasionally fun event has
the potential to both impress and ex
cite. However, he forgot a few crucial
pieces of dating information.
First, Candlestick isn't the Ritz. I
know it has its history, but there were
several times that I would have to
consciously remind myself that I
wasn't watching a California State
Penitentiary playoff game.
Second, our seats were god-awful.
Middle of the end zone, about 20
rows up, and section seven is smack
ing you in the side of the head with
the depth perception of an armadillo.
And third, the score was 45-10.
Have you ever been at a raffle, and
that one guy became far too excited
when his number was read, only to
realize that his thumb was blocking
his vision, and the eight was really a
nine? Niners fans had a very similar
reaction when Dre Bly fumbled
away his interception by doing his
worst Deion Sanders impression.
I was almost ready to give up
hope on these lovebirds going on a
second date, when he asked her a
simple question: "Do you know any
thing about football?"
Her response? "No."
He picked a winner. His lady
could have flat out lied, doing her
best job to appease her date while
gritting her teeth through the entire
four hour adult immaturity show
case. She could have easily dressed
up in Niners gear and pretended to
know and care that when Glen Cof
fee scored a touchdown, the PA an
nouncer wasn't referring to a Star
bucks vendor. She knew nothing
about football, couldn't care less
about the Niners and really wasn't
afraid to admit it.
So it got me thinking: What if
every person was like this? What if
those Yankees fans that support the
team because they saw Paris Hilton
wearing a hat didn't exist, or if USC
fans that rocked "Matt Leinart 4
Heisman" t-shirts only because they
liked his spray tan admitted to know
ing nothing about Trojans football?
For one, the viewing pleasure for
true, diehard sports fans would in
crease exponentially. As a Magic fan,
watching the NBA Finals last year in
a room full of people that wore Kobe
jerseys but couldn't separate Phil
Jackson from Dr. Phil was one of the
most painful experiences of my life.
Arguing with "Lakers fans" was like
asking for directions in a foreign
country. I would use Dwight
Howard's PER to facilitate my argu
ment, and my opponent would tell
me that Shaq is awesome. Cool, but
Shaq left L.A. five years ago.
If spectators were honest, it would
also alleviate the bandwagonism that
has ravished America for decades. I
really have no problem with band
wagon fans. I for one am the first to
admit that I am passionately rooting
for the Angels in the MLB playoffs
despite having watched in the up
ward range of two regular season
games. But that's okay! It's what
keeps professional sports in business.
If every fan was required to know the
OPS of every team's cleanup hitter
I know people that do, it's scary
there would be no MLB.

All I'm saying is that fake fans

ruin sports. Seriously. It's fine to go
to any sporting event for the sole
purpose of drinking as much as hu
manly possible at a tailgate. If that's
what lights your fire, then more
power to you. But to bring that
drunkenness and sports ignorance
into the stadium, the family room or
even a sports blog is honestly just
annoying and unnecessary.
Sport is an incredible tool for es
tablishing happiness and unity. Let's
not bastardize another one of
mankind's most appreciated pleas
ures by ruining the fun for everyone
else.The concepts aren't that hard to
grasp, and the resulting satisfaction
is priceless.
Plus, when your beautiful com
panion says she doesn't know about
football, you'll be able to explain it
to her on the second date.

Zach Zimmerman wants to work on
his spray tan. Give him some tips at
zachz @stanford. edu.
