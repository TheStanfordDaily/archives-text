## Sorority launches relief effort Sigma Gamma Rho supports Samoan victims 
### SAHAR KHAN 
Stanford students are making head
way in an effort to amass funds and non
monetary aid to alleviate the aftermath of
four tsunamis in the Samoan islands.

The tsunamis were caused by an 8.0
magnitude earthquake in the Pacific
Ocean, and razed many parts of Samoa
and American Samoa to the ground. The
casualties exceeded 100, and approxi
mately 15,000 people have been severely
affected in the wake of the disaster, which
struck two weeks ago.
Stanford's traditionally African-
American Sigma Gamma Rho (SGR)
sorority is crossing cultural lines to help
Samoan victims.
SGR President Anarghya Vardhana
'lO expressed concern over how most
Stanford students are not really aware of
the troubles of victims reeling from the
calamity.
"It is such a huge catastrophe, and I
don't think people recognize the enormi
ty of it," Vardhana said. "Living in this
very upper middle class bubble in the
United States, one gets disconnected. I've
traveled a lot to developing countries
where life is not easy."
Sigma's effort is still in its early stages,
according to SGR member Oluoma Kas-
Osoka 'lO, who is spearheading the proj
ect.

"It was a spur of the moment thing,
and it took a week for us to get it togeth
er. We saw a need and we wanted to do
anything we could to help," she said.
Although not Samoan herself, Kas-
Osoka said that her effort to marshal aid
for the Samoan victims sprung from her
personal affiliation with the large Samoan
community in San Jose. She spoke of
Samoan friends who could not contact
their families back home for days on end
because of the devastating repercussions
of the tsunamis.
Kas-Osoka described the initiative as
a small-scale effort, but added that every
thing and anything that students can
spare will make a difference.
The sorority has already placed dona
tion boxes in Ujamaa, Mirrielees and the
Black Community Services Center. So
far, they have been focusing on the public
ity front and spreading the word by send
ing e-mails to the Stanford community
and placing flyers in dorms.
SGR is in the process of planning sev
eral upcoming events, including drives to
collect clothes, blankets, canned foods and
other non-perishable items. These dona
tions will be sent to the Red Cross in San
Jose, which is supporting many of the
Samoan relief efforts in the Bay Area.
President Obama has dispatched
federal aid to the islands, and the gov
ernments of Australia and New
Zealand are lending aid to the relief
effort.
As Stanford SGR is one chapter of
a large national network, the sorori
ty's reach extends beyond the campus
boundaries, and e-mails have been
forwarded to Southern California and
Washington as well. People in the
region can also help by dropping off
their donations at the closest Red
Cross.
