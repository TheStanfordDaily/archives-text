# Man peeps in women's shower
## Robinson on alert; separate scare at Narnia 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Governor's Corner (GovCo) and Narnia resi
dences have been left shaken following a recent
wave of intrusions. Police are still actively search
ing for the latest suspect: a six-foot tall white male
who entered a women's bathroom Monday morn
ing and knocked over a female student in
GovCo's Robinson House.

Sterling Quad Intruder
Described as a 200-pound man in his late 20s
or early 30s, the suspect entered Adams House
and then Robinson House between 7:45 a.m. and
8:30 a.m., according to the Stanford Police
Department.
He was last seen wearing baggy pants and a
maroon hooded sweatshirt, fleeing in a "white
colored work van with no windows on the sides
and a blue ladder on a roof rack," according to
police spokesperson Bill Larson.
The man was chased out of Robinson after two
female residents noticed his presence in the sec
ond-floor bathroom and screamed for help, said
Robinson Residential Assistant (RA) Rafael
Wabl 'lO.
"I was in the shower stall and shampooing my
hair," said one of the victims, granted anonymity
because the experience was personally traumatic.
"I peeked around and there was a huge man in the
dressing area of my stall. I just started screaming."
The man knocked over the second victim
granted anonymity for the same reason on his
way out of the bathroom.
"I kind of fell backwards and hit the paper
towel dispenser," the second victim said. "I tried
to hit the back of his sweatshirt as he ran out the
door. I was screaming for someone to help us."
She followed him outside while another stu

dent called the police. Though the police arrived
on the scene quickly, they were too late to appre
hend the suspect.
Students in nearby Lyman House, however,
were woken by the screaming and provided the
description of the getaway vehicle.
"[The police] didn't find him, but I think they
are making a pretty serious effort to find him,"
Wabl said. "I know they brought in a sketch
artist."
Flyers with the man's description and facial
sketch were posted around Sterling Quad and
also e-mailed to various dorm chat lists.
Prior to entering Robinson, the same man was
seen peering into a woman's bathroom in Adams.
Robinson Resident Fellow and history Prof.
Philippe Buc was upset that the man wasn't
reported to the police sooner.
"Had the alarm been given from Adams a
simple call to 9-1-1 the pervert would have
been caught in or near Robinson," Buc wrote in a
letter to the editor published in yesterday's Daily.
"How good will you feel if a pervert you have just
escaped from harms someone else, just because
you were not diligent?"
Early reporting is the best way to maintain
safety, said Larson. "To increase our chances that
we will be able to make contact with a suspicious
person, it is very important that it be reported
immediately," he said.
Buc commended the police for arriving on the
scene within three minutes of the phone call. Both
victims were similarly impressed with the police
response.
"[The police] have been very nice and very
helpful," said the second student. "It's definitely
not their fault that they haven't caught the guy
yet."
