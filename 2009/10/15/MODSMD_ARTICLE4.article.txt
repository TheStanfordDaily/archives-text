## New guidelines passed for honorific faculty titles 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Following Donald Rumsfeld's contentious
appointment as a distinguished visiting fellow
at the Hoover Institution, the Faculty Senate
created the Committee to Examine the Non
academic Council Appointment Process
(CENCAP) and commissioned it to investi
gate the conferral process for University
titles.
The seven-member committee presented
its recommendations to the Faculty Senate
last week, which passed by a unanimous vote.
CENCAP Chair and geology Prof.
Gordon Brown explained that the protests
against Rumsfeld's appointment sparked
debate about the University's policy for hon

orific titles.
"Because of the use of the title 'distin
guished fellow' [by] the Hoover Institution,
there was some concern about the possibility
of using so-called honorific titles inappropri
ately at times," Brown said. "The Senate
wanted us to look at that in particular and
come up with guidelines."
After months of research and delibera
tion, the committee formulated five guide
lines for non-academic council appointments:
Titles bestowed upon non-academic coun
cil faculty appointees are to be restricted to
those named in the Stanford Faculty
Handbook.
Departments, centers and other title
granting entities must gain the approval of
the provost or the provost's designee before

creating or conferring titles with honorific
adjectives. Examples of honorific adjectives
include but are not limited to "distinguished,"
"honorary," "national" and "international."
Title-granting entities are free to make
non-faculty, non-academic council appoint
ments that do not contain honorific adjec
tives.
With the exception of post-doctoral schol
ars and fellows, appointments to non-academ
ic council positions must be approved by at
least three faculty members in the appropri
ate department, institute or center .
Non-academic council appointees will
receive written instructions on how long their
titles are valid and how these titles may be
used.

Provost John Etchemendy, in an e-mail to

The Daily, said the guidelines will have addi
tional feedback prior to their implementation
as policy.

"These are just recommendations," the
provost said of the CENCAP findings. "I will
take them to the Advisory Board to ask for
their input on the recommendations, and then
decide what changes need to be made to the
Academic Staff Handbook, which specifies
policies about this kind of appointment."
Brown and his colleagues hope the CEN
CAP findings will help reform the title-grant
ing process and prevent titles from being mis
used.

"In the past, there have been some consult
ing faculty who have used that title to run a
