## New guidelines passed for honorific faculty titles 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Following Donald Rumsfeld's contentious
appointment as a distinguished visiting fellow
at the Hoover Institution, the Faculty Senate
created the Committee to Examine the Non
academic Council Appointment Process
(CENCAP) and commissioned it to investi
gate the conferral process for University
titles.
The seven-member committee presented
its recommendations to the Faculty Senate
last week, which passed by a unanimous vote.
CENCAP Chair and geology Prof.
Gordon Brown explained that the protests
against Rumsfeld's appointment sparked
debate about the University's policy for hon

orific titles.
"Because of the use of the title 'distin
guished fellow' [by] the Hoover Institution,
there was some concern about the possibility
of using so-called honorific titles inappropri
ately at times," Brown said. "The Senate
wanted us to look at that in particular and
come up with guidelines."
After months of research and delibera
tion, the committee formulated five guide
lines for non-academic council appointments:
Titles bestowed upon non-academic coun
cil faculty appointees are to be restricted to
those named in the Stanford Faculty
Handbook.
Departments, centers and other title
granting entities must gain the approval of
the provost or the provost's designee before

creating or conferring titles with honorific
adjectives. Examples of honorific adjectives
include but are not limited to "distinguished,"
"honorary," "national" and "international."
Title-granting entities are free to make
non-faculty, non-academic council appoint
ments that do not contain honorific adjec
tives.
With the exception of post-doctoral schol
ars and fellows, appointments to non-academ
ic council positions must be approved by at
least three faculty members in the appropri
ate department, institute or center .
Non-academic council appointees will
receive written instructions on how long their
titles are valid and how these titles may be
used.

Provost John Etchemendy, in an e-mail to

The Daily, said the guidelines will have addi
tional feedback prior to their implementation
as policy.

"These are just recommendations," the
provost said of the CENCAP findings. "I will
take them to the Advisory Board to ask for
their input on the recommendations, and then
decide what changes need to be made to the
Academic Staff Handbook, which specifies
policies about this kind of appointment."
Brown and his colleagues hope the CEN
CAP findings will help reform the title-grant
ing process and prevent titles from being mis
used.

"In the past, there have been some consult
ing faculty who have used that title to run a
business," Brown remarked. "They
use the Stanford leverage in order to
enhance their visibility in the outside
world and also to enhance their busi
ness. We think that this is not appro
priate."
Furthermore, CENCAP findings
have had a marked impact on the
School of Engineering. According to
Brown, while collaborating with the
committee, Dean Jim Plummer
found that there were over 200 con
sulting faculty members in the engi
neering school, a number nearly
equal to that of the regular faculty.
Upon further investigation, Plummer
discovered that some faculty mem
bers named their graduating Ph.D.

students as consulting professors.
Plummer promptly put an end to
this process.
"He wanted to trim down the
number of consulting faculty in his
school because he felt that it was
getting a little bit out of hand,"
Brown explained.
Brown expects the committee's
recommendations "will raise a level
of consciousness about titles that we
bestow upon various people when
we appoint them."
The Hoover Institution, at the
center of the debate surrounding
Rumsfeld's title, had no official role
in devising the guidelines.
"The Hoover Institution as such
had no formal role in the process,"
said David Brady, professor of polit
ical science and a senior fellow at
Hoover, in an e-mail to The Daily.
"However, I was appointed as a
faculty member to the committee

and as deputy director was familiar
with the appointment process at
Hoover and could represent that to
the committee," he added.
According to Etchemendy, the
CENCAP findings ultimately are
intended to be cautionary guide
lines.
"It will force departments to be
more careful in considering faculty
level, non-academic council appoint
ments, but it is unlikely that it will
stand in the way of most such
appointments," Etchemendy said.
"Nor is it intended to do so."
The members of CENCAP are
Stanford Profs. Gordon Brown,
David Brady, Pamela Karlan,
Milbrey McLaughlin, Londa
Schiebinger, David Spiegel and
