## Stanford ranks 10th in economic diversity 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is keeping pace with peer
institutions in ensuring its student
body reflects a variety of class back
grounds, and administrators are work
ing to keep the trend going.
Among the U.S. News & World
Report's top 26 universities, Stanford
ranked 10th in the economic diversity
of its students.

With 13 percent of students receiv
ing Pell Grants, the U.S. News &
World Report ranked Stanford just
below Flarvard and Cornell. Tagging
closely behind were peer institutions
such as Brown at 12 percent and the
University of Pennsylvania at 11 per

cent.
The Federal Pell Grant Program
provides grants to low-income under
graduates based on need.
UCLA and UC-Berkeley are at
the top of the rankings, leading far
ahead with student populations of
which 35 and 32 percent are Pell
Grant recipients, respectively.
According to Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper, a large proportion
of non-traditional students above the
age of 24 at flagship public universities
may explain the significant gap
between the schools with high score
cards for economic diversity and the
schools that trail behind them.

In an e-mail to The Daily, Cooper
suggested that the Pell eligibility of

non-traditional students is assessed by
their own personal assets and income
rather than those of their parents.

"The more non-traditional stu
dents on a campus, the more Pell eligi
ble students you will find," she said.
According to Director of
Admission Shawn Abbott, the per
centage of first-generation college stu
dents and Pell Grant recipients are
two elements that may indicate how
the University is doing in terms of
promoting a wide socioeconomic
spread of students.
"With regard to both of these ele
ments, Stanford fares exceedingly well
by comparison," Abbott said in an e
mail to The Daily. According to
Abbott, more than 15 percent of

freshmen and 17 percent of sopho
mores are first-generation college stu
dents.
Given that the economic recession
has left few campus units insulated
from cutbacks, students may be con
cerned about the future of financial
aid funds available.
Stanford has strived to increase
economic diversity, particularly within
the past two years, after altering its
financial aid offerings, cutting tuition
for students with a family income of
$lOO,OOO a year as well as slashing par
ent contribution for families earning
under $60,000 a year.
