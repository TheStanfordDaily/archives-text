ho the hell is beandip!?

Rebels, be warned if you post comments
onto Coursework and your SUNet ID is some
thing bizarre like "beandip," your Teaching
Assistant (TA) will definitely notice.
Dan Tucker 'O9 was so ecstatic about being
accepted to Stanford that he was "too excited
to read the fine print about the significance of
your SUNet ID and how it would be used," he
said. Like any other bright, levelheaded per
son, he simply borrowed the name of the near
est living creature his cat.
Despite some initial regret, being
"beandip" has only brought Dan one stunned
TA, countless funny moments and no serious
disasters.
"It kind of gives me this quirky sense of
identity that I've come to embrace," Tucker
reflected.
Like Tucker, one of the first things that
every new Stanford student must do is choose
a SUNet ID. This is usually considered a very
serious affair, with the University Website pro
claiming that SUNet IDs remain permanent

"through graduation, employment, retirement,
and even death."

Unlike those xoxo-filled AIM or Hotmail
accounts created in junior high, most students
follow the University's recommendation to
choose an ID that "you'll be confident to say
aloud to your manager, professor, or col
leagues." Full names or "first initial plus last
name" combinations are common.
But wait a second. Stanford is the school
where revolutionary startups are regularly
founded and the marching band dances in
wacky costumes while eschewing traditional
formations. Nonconformists and creativity are
supposed to lurk around every corner! And
indeed, every year, a few brave souls choose to
make their mark by bucking the trend and
choosing a wacky SUNet ID.
Perhaps most famous on campus is "hbun
ny," the SUNet ID of the Associate Director of
Residential Education, Josh Schiller.
"My girlfriend from high school called me
Honey Bunny, so I figured that I would incor
porate that into my email address," Schiller
recalled.
Even though the relationship ended by
April of his freshman year, "hbunny" became
not only one of his nicknames, but a part of his
identity.
"I've had it for 16 years now, and I haven't

regretted it once," he said.
ResComp Senior Network Administrator
Ethan Rikleen, who said he "often laments
that students these days don't choose more
creative SUNetlDs," practices what he
preaches he proudly claims ownership of
not only the SUNet ID "bigdog," but the fan
tastic email address falcon@deathstar.stan
ford.edu.
It's not just staff that like to stand out,
though.
The rebellious Atticus Lee 'lO wanted to
"subvert the silly must-end-in-your-last-name
rule" and came up with the ID "screaming
silentlee," She considers it to be a compliment
when others comment on her unusual and
highly memorable ID.
Ruthie Arbeiter 'l2, whose love of pugs,
combined with the name of her first puppy
(Mallory), led to the de-facto username "mer
pug" throughout her teenage life. She had no
qualms about making it an integral part of her
Stanford career as well, and reports only posi
tive results.
Others, by pure chance, unintentionally
acquire amusing SUNet IDs. SheelTyle 'l2 fol
lowed Web site recommendations and used the
trusty "first letter of first name + the last
name" method, but ended up with style@stan
ford.edu.

"People think it is pretty cool as soon as
they realize that my email address is actually a
very normal arrangement of my name," Tyle
said.

Patricia Arty 'lO struck gold by following
the same rule. Her enviable email address:
party@stanford.edu. Sorry, frat boys. Looks
like the real party isn't @ your place.
But ultimately, whether intentional or not,
students with out-of-the-ordinary SUNet IDs
seem to agree that they have faced few nega
tive consequences or comments.
When asked what they would say to future
freshmen, the rebels all agreed.
"A part of me wants to recommend that you
take your SUNet ID seriously when you
choose one, but at the same time, it's kind of
fun to break the mold and just do something
weird," said Tucker. "I think that's what the
Stanford culture is all about."
Indeed, as Lee aptly concluded, "as long as
it's not creepy or obscene, anything that helps
you make a lasting impression in this world is
probably a good thing."
So why not have some fun? Be audacious,
as Dean Julie always says. Make a real impres
sion the next time you sign up for a mailing list.
