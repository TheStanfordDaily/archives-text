## Curfew concerns pose issue for Grad Formal GSC considers problem, approves new members 
### VIVIANA ARCIA 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) addressed issues with the
upcoming Grad Formal at San
Francisco City Hall and elected two
new members to its sub-committees
at its meeting Wednesday.
While the Formal has been
approved, several questions have
still not been answered. The City
Hall has attached a curfew to the
event, which now stands at midnight.
Members brought up the concern
that most students would not arrive
to the formal until past 11:00 p.m.,
and some asked whether the curfew
could be raised to 1:00 a.m. and what
the costs of such a move would be.
In addition, the distance between
Stanford and San Francisco raised
concerns over transportation.
Attendance could potentially
decrease given that the formal would
be a considerable distance from
Stanford.
Members also brought questions
to the GSC Programming
Coordinators Jessica Tsai and Addy
Satija over the price of formal tick
ets. Satija had no exact price but
would be in contact with City Hall
to discuss the council's questions.
The GSC then transitioned to the
selection of the GSC Business
Representative. This position would
serve as a liaison between the GSC
and the Graduate School of
Business.
First-year MBA student Chris
Hillier had mentioned interest in the
position and was brought to speak
before the council. Although he
lacked prior significant student gov
ernment positions or experience,
Hillier felt confident in his contribu
tions to the council and his ability to
fill the position.
"I feel this would be a great
opportunity and learning experi
ence," Hillier said. "I would like to
represent the business school and
graduate school as a whole,"
Hillier was then formally
announced as Business
Representative after a 10-0 vote. His
election was lauded by some as wel
coming an era of collaboration
between the GSC and the Stanford
School of Business.
"We want to be able to represent
students from all of Stanford's differ
ent schools well, and therefore it is

great to have someone from the
GSB on board," said GSC Co-chair
Nanna Notthoff. "This person will
also be able to reach out to the stu
dents in the GSB best."
The second election of the
evening was a vote on the position in
charge of the Stipends Advocacy
Committee. Thomas Haymore,
JD/Ph. D. student, had also
expressed interest in the position
and spoke to the council about his
decision to run.
"I loved being involved in student
government; in law school I was
involved with the law review,"
Haymore said. "I feel it's important
to have an advocate for graduate
students and that the University
understands our point of view."
A second vote followed with
Haymore being formally welcomed
as Chair of the Stipends Committee.
Notthoff celebrated the addition
of both students.
"Having these two new people on
board shows we are making progress
in reaching out to grad students,"
Notthoff said.
The last item discussed was a
source of dissent. ASSU President
David Gobaud brought up a pro
posed event at Duke University,
which would bring together student
governments. The various universi
ties would discuss common goals
and issues, and propose solutions on
issues of sustainability, sexual
harassment and overall campus
wellness.
The fact that the event is still in a
primitive planning stage was a cause
for various members to question the
overall purpose of the event.
Notthoff questioned Gobaud on
the difference between this confer
ence and past student leadership
events, particularly since the GSC
would have to provide funding and
be in charge of selecting a student to
represent Stanford. After Gobaud
cited a lack of familiarity with past
conferences, the GSC ultimately
decided that no decisions would be
made until Gobaud provided a final
date and more concrete details.
Before concluding, the council
also brought up the upcoming open
ing of the Pub in the Graduate
Community Center (GCC).
Members discussed active represen
tation of GSC Housing Advocacy and
GCC Operations Committee in the
continued talks over GCC building
policies, and the importance of taking
student input into consideration.
