## Hospitals will bar visitors under 16 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
As of Monday, Oct. 19, Stanford
Hospital & Clinics and the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital will no
longer accept visitors under 16 years
of age inside both facilities.
The hospitals cited the intensity
of the HINI flu and the possibility of
the pandemic spreading to suscepti
ble patients such as infants, children
and pregnant women as the reason

for the exclusion.

Children are both more likely to
contract the flu and more contagious
for longer amounts of time than
adults, even if they show no symp
toms.

According to Reuters, the regula
tion will be in effect throughout the
duration of flu season, which typical
ly extends to spring. At that time, the
ban will be reevaluated. In the event
of necessary visitations, cases will be
evaluated individually.
Dr. Christy Sandborg, quoted in
Reuters, said other hospitals across
the nation are adopting similar poli
cies. She added that the facilities are
doing everything they can "to make
this new policy as smooth of a transi
tion as possible."
