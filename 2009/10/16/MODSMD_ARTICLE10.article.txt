## EDITORIAL Mausoleum Party deserves student action 
### Shelley Gao 
Many of Stanford's traditions have
evolved over time with great suc
cess, a testament to the creativity of
the student body. Even controversial events
like Full Moon on the Quad are still enjoyed
by the droves of attending students (this
year's being an exception due to HINI con
cerns), the true litmus test for the majority
of Stanford traditions. In no realm should
enjoyment be more of a crucial expectation
than in annual parties, a type of tradition
Stanford is struggling to uphold in the face
of financial obstacles.
Mausoleum Party and its $2,000
budget deficit for this year offers a
unique chance for the students to take
ownership of the event and revision its for
mat. Years ago, Mausoleum Party was one
of the highlights of the Stanford fall quar
ter a dizzying array of costumes and cel
ebration that, for one night out of the year,
brought life back to the grave of Leland
and Jane Stanford. Unfortunately, in the
last few years, Mausoleum Party has grown
progressively duller and more restrained,
no more so than last year, when the party
was moved to Old Union because of a
chance of rain. As the years go on, it is be
coming questionable whether the vibrant
tradition of Halloween as a topsy-turvy
celebration of childlike fantasy and excess
can really be satisfied by such a quaint lit
tle gathering as what took place at Old
Union last year.
The Editorial Board believes that the
student body must take a more direct own

ership of Mausoleum Party, with less de
pendence on "fun funds" from the Universi
ty and perhaps more reliance on the individ
ual groups on campus that have proven
themselves capable of hosting memorable
and exciting events that are both creative
and cost-effective. Historically, it has been
Greek life here at Stanford specifically
fraternities that has time and again host
ed the student-designed and student-of
fered all-campus parties that serve as tradi
tions on a smaller scale. With the consistent
success of annual parties such as Sun Splash,
Euro Trash and other events, there may be
something to be said in leaving the campus
Halloween party to those who know parties
best.
While last year's change of venue for
Mausoleum Party was due to the weather,
the precarious situation of this year's party
is dependent on student action and financial
realities. In an academic year that has al
ready seen numerous cuts in the budget,
handing Mausoleum Party off to the Greek
community could free up funds for the jun
ior class to use elsewhere, while allowing the
Mausoleum Party to regain some of the ex
citement of years past.
Considering that a quarter and soon,
half of the current undergraduates will
have never experienced Mausoleum Party
as it once was, the most compelling reason
for student action may simply be the sense
of unity and continuity of experience creat
ed by a tradition, even a creatively redrawn
one, done in classic Stanford style.
