# THE
						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## Helloooo Froshies! 
### 
After chastising women for the gender
imbalance in politics and castigating
campus conservatives for lacking an
intellectual impulse, it is probably time to
move on to a topic whereby I can only irk
more people: Advice to the Class of 2013!
As an official member of 48 organizations
and 21 University committees, and equipped
with five (and counting!) body doubles that
attend the endless cycle of meetings, one
could make the argument that I know a thing
or two about extracurricular involvement on
campus.
First off: please, please venture outside
your dorm. Meet other freshmen and upper
classmen through academic interests or com
mon activities. While the desire to cling to the
security of a group is understandable, the
pack mentality has to stop. Residential edu
cation tends to liberate or stifle, depending
on one's personality and particular experi
ences. If you belong to the latter category,
feeling oppressed by constant dorm bonding
and collectivist programming, I beg of you to
stand up for your right to not participate.
Stanford is all about doing your own thing.
Second, get involved! After applying to
and considering attending colleges on three
continents, what attracted me to venture
from Down Under to the Farm was the sheer
vibrancy of the campus life. I still recall the
intoxicating feeling of attending my first ac
tivities fair. I was a kid in Candy Land.
Pulling yourself away from these attractions
may require greater discipline than you
imagine. Pick one or two of these desired ac
tivities, and do them in depth. Impact matters
much more than number. On that note, do
not be one of the people getting involved for
the sake of your resume. Good luck convey
ing authentic passion in your job interviews!
I learned just as much from extracurricular
involvement as from classes, perhaps even
more. An education in the reality of the press,
politics, power and people (!) is probably
more helpful in the long run. Stanford is a mi
crocosm of the real world. Important lessons
can be gained from picking and choosing from
the dizzying array of activities. Leadership
skills like knowing how to manage an organi
zation, plan events and mediate disputes are
certainly important. However, the most valu
able of lessons can be brutally delivered and
tough to swallow at first learning to have
the courage to take a stance and stand up for
your convictions, or coming to terms with the
fact that not everyone will love you, no matter
how hard you try. And believe me, I do.
Third, forget about putting up with the
abysmal freshman advising system. No one
denies that it is in shambles, with poor match
es between advisors and advisees ... Admit
tedly, reform is hard, made all the more diffi
cult in an era of budget cuts. Despite regular

editorials from The Daily crying for change,
and even complaints from faculty them
selves, the prospect looks bleak. Instead, be
proactive. Getting the most out of Stanford is
rooted in self-initiative. Go and talk to up
perclassmen in your major, academic direc
tors in your residences, professors in your de
partment or career counselors in the CDC!
Cultivating good mentorships have a critical
impact on your Stanford career.
Oh, and along the lines of academics, what
is with this research assistant business? It se
riously mirrors D.C., where there are no paid
administrative positions, only intern slaves.
Although working on a project may offer a
way in to future collaborations with the pro
fessor, it also involves a great deal of bitch
work that might just drive you nuts (dis
claimer: No personal experience, only horror
stories from friends). Humanities and social
sciences majors take note: You do not need
access to labs or those fancy technology thin
gies, so develop your own projects! Chart
your own course! Write a project proposal,
find a faculty sponsor, apply for grants and
conduct your own independent research.
Chances are you might even find yourself
getting published.
Lastly: NEVER ever talk to Daily people.
You never know what lies they might spread
about what you ordered at the Axe and Palm.
The world is becoming a more dangerous
place every day. Vast right-wing AND left
wing conspiracies may be conducted against
you simultaneously. But hey, what doesn't
kill you can only make you stronger, right?

Life gets SO much better after freshman year.
