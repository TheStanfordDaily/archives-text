## "On a Manhunt" 
### P.G. Mann 
I had just put on my pajamas and taken off
my face when the Sheriff battered down
my door. "Lace up your boots. We have to
hunt a man."
"But I just took my face off," I cried.
"Well, slap 'er back on. It's man-huntin'
time."
This was to be my third manhunt since the
Sheriff moved in across the hall last week.
And as much as I had grown to appreciate a
good manhunt, I really just felt like getting
cozy with a chalice of scotch and some old
episodes of "Murder, She Wrote."
But I couldn't tell the Sheriff that. I need
ed to buoy his spirits with a good manhunt.
Some recent jurisdiction problems at work
had made him melancholic. He also hated
"Murder, She Wrote." Jessica Fletcher's
crime-solving philosophy was anathema to
him, and whenever he caught the muffled
sounds of the show's catchy piano and strings
theme music coming from under my covers,
he'd batter down the door in a rage, scream
ing about illegal immigrants. "The Mexicans
did it! Not the jealous real estate agent!
Those dirty illegal immigrants did it!"
I tried to explain to the Sheriff that this
was impossible because there weren't Mexi
cans, let alone illegal ones, in Cabot Cove,
Maine, where Mrs. Fletcher did her sleuthing.
But the Sheriff was beyond persuasion, busy
bloodying my rug with his raw knuckles.
"When will that old crone get it? We gotta
build a giant wall to stop this murder spree in
Maine!" he shouted, heaving his battering
ram through my walls.
I don't mind the Sheriff's company, but I
do wish he would leave his battering ram
next door. If only because Lardbottom, my
domestic partner, suffers from hyperten
sion, and every time the Sheriff pays a visit,
the flying door and drywall splinters spike
his heart rate. Fearing for Lardbottom's
tranquility, I resigned myself to the man

hunt. I put my face back on, made some
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and cre
ated a mix tape to put us in the right mood
for hunting men. We drove into the Arizona
night with hunger in our hearts and Hall and
Oates on our stereo.

As the Sheriff had taught me, the secret to
a good manhunt is surprise. Just as we had
swooped from the rafters on an unsuspecting
John Tesh mid-concert on our first manhunt,
and waited for three hours in the sweltering
backseat of Charles Barkley's car during a
promotional event at Footlocker on our last
manhunt, we would disguise ourselves as
American Idol contestants and pounce on an
unwitting Ryan Seacrest on this manhunt. It
was thanks to this kind of cunning that the
Sheriff had hunted down dozens of famous
men (and women on his womanhunts) and
amassed his impressive collection of celebri
ty photos and autographs or, as he called
them, his scalps.
As usual, in route to our manhunt, the
Sheriff pulled over anyone he reckoned was
an illegal immigrant and threw them in the
back of the truck. Some might call this reck
less racial profiling. But, I assure you, the
Sheriff employed the latest techniques in
physiognomical and phrenological science.
The occipital calipers he wielded so deftly
had once adorned the desks of such leg
endary men of science as Count Gobineau

and Josef Mengele. Of course, the calipers
only confirmed what his nose already told
him. According to the Sheriff, illegal resi
dence in the United States had a specific
smell. He said it was redolent of sorghum mo
lasses, smoked birch wood and traces of arti
ficial cherry.
We cruised through town, tracking the
sweet scent of illegality. This particular night,
illegal immigration must have been rampant,
as the Sheriff found the smell on nearly
everyone we passed. We filled truckload after
truckload of illegal aliens, dressed them in
pink lingerie and herded them off to jail.
Meanwhile, Ryan Seacrest was wrapping up
at the convention center. Our manhunt was
slipping through the cracks.
I pulled out a sandwich and offered it to
the Sheriff, hoping to calm his nerves. But he
declined, unwrapping one of his own.
"What kind of sandwich is that?" I asked.
"Sorghum molasses and cherry jelly on
smoked birch wood."
Unfortunately, food seemed to aggravate
the Sheriff only more. Seacrest was long gone
and the Sheriff was returning from his man
hunt without a scalp. In his impotent fury, he
turned to immigration. He said the smell of it
was everywhere, even right here in this car.
On the way home, I caught him measuring
my skull with his calipers.
By the time we got to the apartment, the
Sheriff was beside himself. He had turned his
suspicion on himself and was measuring his
own skull. Then his gaze fell on Tardbottom,
my domestic partner.
"What kind of cat is that?" he asked me,
his eyes slowly coming aflame.
"... Mexican hairless," I whispered. A
tear rolled down my cheek.
