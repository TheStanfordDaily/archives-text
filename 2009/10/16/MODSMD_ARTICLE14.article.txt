## FIGHTING THE AZTECS Men's soccer looks to defend ranking 
### TOM TAYLOR 
The Stanford men's soccer team heads
south for its first away weekend in the Pac-10
conference today. The two games in southern
California will round off the first half of the
league, with only four weeks and five games
left to decide both the conference champions
and secure a place in the NCAAs.
The Cardinal (7-2-1, Pacific-10 1-1-1), now
ranked No. 18 in the country, will play San
Diego State (3-3-4, Pac-10 0-1-2) this after
noon, followed up by No. 4 pre-season Pac-10
favorites, UCLA (6-1-2, Pac-10 1-0-2) on Sun
day.

So far the conference has not really opened
up and while there may be a team in the lead
and a team sitting in last place, only three
points a single win separate them. The
tightness of the race means that every game re
mains crucial to Stanford's aspirations to take
the title and launch itself into the end of season
tournament.

"UCLA has two draws out of four games
and Washington has three draws out of four
games, and those are the teams that are romp
ing away at the top of the table, so I think it's a
little early to see a pattern in things," said Stan
ford Head Coach Bret Simon. "We're going to
see a lot of teams grinding through and each
weekend will tip things a little one way or the
other."

"The most important games and the most
difficult games lie ahead of us," said UCLA
Head Coach Jorge Salcedo. "Every team at this
point still has a chance to win the conference."
Still undefeated at home, the Cardinal put
in a solid performance last weekend to rack up

four team points with a win against Oregon
State and a tie with Washington. Early goals in
both games by Stanford's leading goal scorer,
junior Bobby Warshaw, secured the points
against tough opposition.
"I think we almost have to get four [points]
at home just because the job gets harder on the
road, so I don't think it's a bad weekend,"
Simon said. "Both teams were difficult oppo
nents in that their styles of play make it very
difficult to play the way we would like, and so
the game is not as free flowing."
If the organized and deep defensive tactics
of the northern teams stifled the Card's cre-

GAME NOTES: No. 18 Stanford, one of only three
ranked Pac-10 teams, travels south for two of its first
away games in conference play this weekend. After
two losses to San Diego State last season, the Cardi
nal hopes to illustrate its vast improvement in 2009.
