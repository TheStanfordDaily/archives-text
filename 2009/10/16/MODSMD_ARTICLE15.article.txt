# Undefeated women's soccer heads to L.A.
## Women are unanimously ranked No. 1 in nation 
### SAM SVOBODA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ask any member of the Stanford women's
soccer team about their upcoming matches
this weekend and they will tell you that they
are just like any other conference games. But
while each Pac-10 match technically has no
more value than any other, the truth is that the
conference championship could very well
hinge on this one weekend.
That 's because this weekend, the No. 1 Car
dinal hosts both No. 15 USC and No. 3 UCLA
on the Farm. The former is the 2007 national
champion, while the latter has won the last six
Pac-10 titles it's not a stretch to say that the
two L. A. schools will be Stanford's main com
petition for the conference title this year.
"They're both very good teams, so we have
to take it, as I always say, game by game," said
Stanford Head Coach Paul Ratcliffe. "USC,
we definitely want to beat them because they
won the national title a couple years back and
then UCLA is a team that notoriously goes to
the Final Four. So both games are very impor
tant, we want to beat both of them."
Of course, Stanford certainly has some ac
colades to its name as well. The Cardinal is the
unanimous top-ranked team in the nation, and
at 13-0-0 (2-0-0 in conference), it has set a new
record for the best season start in school histo
ry. The team has played some of the most beau
tiful attacking soccer in the nation to achieve
these heights, outscoring its opponents 48-9 so
far this season.
Stanford will first put its attacking abilities

NOTES: No. 1 Stanford hosts No. 15 USC and No. 3
UCLA this weekend. Stanford has set a record for the
best season start in school history and has outscored its
opponents 48-9 so far this season. The Trojans have
won nine straight matches, and UCLA has won the last
six Pac-10 titles, so defeating these two teams will be a
big step toward a conference title for Stanford.

to the test against a tough USC team
tonight. After a rough 1-3 start to the
season, the Trojans have gone on a roll,
winning nine straight matches to climb
into the national top-15.
Even more impressive is that the
Trojans accomplished this feat despite
losing junior midfielder Ashli San
doval, the team's leading point scorer
last year, to an ACL injury over a
month ago. Much of this comes down
to a strong defense, led by goalkeeper
Kristin Olsen. Olsen, who just became
USC's all-time leader in shutouts with
26, and has recorded six shutouts in her
last seven matches.
After facing USC, the Cardinal will
take on UCLA on Sunday afternoon.
The Bruins are also riding a wave of
confidence into the Bay Area this
weekend. After opening the season
with an embarrassing 7-2 loss at North
Carolina and a 1-1 draw at San Diego,
they won 11 in a row. And like their

cross-town rivals, UCLA has done so
despite an injury to one of their stars.
Redshirt senior forward Kara Lang,
who contributed three goals and an as
sist in UCLA's first nine matches, tore
her ACL last month and is out for the
season.
Still, with key attackers out for both
teams, one has to wonder whether both
USC and UCLA will try to play defen
sively and keep the score as low as pos
sible.
"I don't know [if either team will
change tactics due to injuries]... I

doubt it," Ratcliffe said. "I think they're
both still strong teams, they have so
many good players, so I think one or
two players missing from both teams is
not going to affect them too much."
No matter what tactics are used, the
Card recognizes the importance of
these two matches, especially the
UCLA game. Last year, the Bruins
handed Stanford its only conference
loss, and only regular season loss, of the
year in a 1-0 match in L. A. That match,
in which Stanford played without All-
American forward Kelley O'Hara due
to injury, effectively crushed the Cardi
nal's hopes of a first Pac-10 title since
2002. With a new season and everyone
healthy, the team knows how crucial a
win over UCLA could be,
"It's a new year," Ratcliffe said,
"and we've got to play to the best of our
ability and beat them."
Kickoff for the USC match is sched
uled for 7 p.m. tonight, while the
UCLA match starts at 1 p.m. on Sun
day. Both matches will take place at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
