# Undefeated women's soccer heads to L.A.
## Women are unanimously ranked No. 1 in nation 
### SAM SVOBODA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ask any member of the Stanford women's
soccer team about their upcoming matches
this weekend and they will tell you that they
are just like any other conference games. But
while each Pac-10 match technically has no
more value than any other, the truth is that the
conference championship could very well
hinge on this one weekend.
That 's because this weekend, the No. 1 Car
dinal hosts both No. 15 USC and No. 3 UCLA
on the Farm. The former is the 2007 national
champion, while the latter has won the last six
Pac-10 titles it's not a stretch to say that the
two L. A. schools will be Stanford's main com
petition for the conference title this year.
"They're both very good teams, so we have
to take it, as I always say, game by game," said
Stanford Head Coach Paul Ratcliffe. "USC,
we definitely want to beat them because they
won the national title a couple years back and
then UCLA is a team that notoriously goes to
the Final Four. So both games are very impor
tant, we want to beat both of them."
Of course, Stanford certainly has some ac
colades to its name as well. The Cardinal is the
unanimous top-ranked team in the nation, and
at 13-0-0 (2-0-0 in conference), it has set a new
record for the best season start in school histo
ry. The team has played some of the most beau
tiful attacking soccer in the nation to achieve
these heights, outscoring its opponents 48-9 so
far this season.

NOTES: No. 1 Stanford hosts No. 15 USC and No. 3
UCLA this weekend. Stanford has set a record for the
best season start in school history and has outscored its
opponents 48-9 so far this season. The Trojans have
won nine straight matches, and UCLA has won the last
six Pac-10 titles, so defeating these two teams will be a
big step toward a conference title for Stanford.
