# Let's give pong some respect

### Danny Belch On My Mind 
We all know about the
sports of football, bas
ketball and baseball.
At one time, all three
were considered solely as activities
and pastimes; only after a large pop
ulation of people started playing did
they become known as sports. So I'd
like to introduce some other activi
ties that should be considered sports
in this day and age: Beirut, flip cup,
Civil War and speed quarters.
"Beer sports," as those in the
know like to call these games, are in
creasing in popularity all over the
country. Beer sports are wholesome
and All-American athletic pursuits,
enjoyed by people of all ages. It's
about time that the sporting world
give a good look at these beer sports
and consider inviting them into its
club.
Known as Beirut, beer pong,
pong and several other names, beer
pong requires skill, accuracy and
strategy. Not only does one have to
work on throwing the ball into the
cup, each player must maintain
steadiness and poise as they drink
more and more.
Similar to Major League Base
ball, beer pong's constraints make it
unlikely that teams will have insane
ly good records. A .700 or .600
record is solid for a Beirut duo, just
as it is in the MLB. Additionally, all
Beirut tables are not created equal,
so that there can be a significant
home team advantage.
Just as a tennis player must have
a precise toss to produce a great
serve, so the Beirut player must un
derstand the path and trajectory of
the ping-pong ball to make it into
the cup. Roger Federer can toss a
tennis ball and serve an ace in his
sleep, but does he have what it takes
to sink a final-cup Beirut shot?
Don't forget about common in
juries, including the widely known
"Beirut elbow" â€”it can set you
back for a couple weeks if not treat
ed properly.
A staple of fraternity events, flip
cup requires each player on each
team to chug their beer, place their
empty cup hanging halfway off the
table, and then attempt to flip the
cup over to land upside down on the
table. Flipping the cup is harder
than it looks, requiring a holy trinity
of timing, balance and "touch." Flip
cup may be the ultimate "practice
makes perfect" beer sport; players
who take this sport seriously, quick
ly separate themselves from those
who see it as a frivolous game.
It takes a lot of practice and pre
cision to not be "that guy" who takes
15 tries to successfully flip his cup.
Just as a golfer must have a special
touch with his wedges to land the
ball close to the hole, so the flip cup
per must have special touch to flip
the cup over in as few tries as possi
ble. And just like golf, flipping the
cup is harder than it looks
A spin-off of Beirut, Civil War
transforms multiple people and
multiple Beirut racks into an all-out
fight. Not only must a player have
what it takes to play regular Beirut,
they also must stay calm in the midst
of ping pong balls flying everywhere
and stay quick on their feet in order
to maintain the advantage.
Like a defensive back in football
that can change directions quickly
on swift and light feet, so must the
Civil War player recognize opportu
nities, move laterally, and be ready
to strike when the chance presents
itself.
Speed Quarters, a game of rico
cheting quarters off a table and into
cups, is more than just a good (or
sometimes bad) time. It can take
some people more than 20 tries to fi
nally make the money shot, bounc
ing the quarter off the table into the
red cup. Couple this repetition with
multiple quarters going at once and
speed quarters becomes an exciting
and fast-paced rally.
Getting the proper bounce off
the table requires the Speed Quar
ters player to be consistent in his or
her throw, angle the quarter correct
ly and perfect the quarter's velocity.
Just as a baseball pitcher must have
proper mechanics to throw fastballs,
curveballs and changeups, a Quar
ters enthusiast must also focus their
arms. Speed Quarters is decidedly
not for the faint of heart, nor for
