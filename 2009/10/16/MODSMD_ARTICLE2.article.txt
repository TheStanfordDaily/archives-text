# BURSTING THE BEAVER DAM
## Card is undefeated against Oregon State 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
After emphatically defeating both Washington schools at
home last weekend, the No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball team
will head north to Oregon to battle unranked Oregon State
tonight and No. 15 Oregon on Saturday night.
This past weekend, the Card battled Washington State for a 3-
1 win. All-American junior Cassidy Lichtman tallied her fifth
triple-double of the season versus the Cougars and junior Alix

Klineman reached dou
ble digits with 20 kills. Se
nior Janet Okogbaa led
the defense with seven
blocks.
"I think we showed
ourselves and everyone
else that we can play with
and beat one of the bet
ter teams in the nation,
and that confidence will
help us in future tough
matches," said freshman
setter Karissa Cook. "I
don't, however, think
that our wins will cause
us to overlook two very
solid Oregon teams. Our
confidence is not over
confidence, and we are
not taking either of these
teams lightly."
Stanford gave then-
No. 3 Washington a run
for their money when
they took the Huskies to
five sets on Saturday
night, ultimately winning
3-2.The Card handed the
Huskies, previously un
defeated in the season
and in matches, their first
loss of the year. Okogbaa
led Stanford with 21 kills
in just 36 attempts, earn
ing the honor of Pac-10
Player of the Week. Her

outstanding performance also sparked a team highlight as a
whole, the Stanford defense registered 15 blocks against Wash
ington.
"I think there were a lot of reasons for our team to be excited
this weekend; definitely one of them was Janet's performance,"
said Head Coach John Dunning. "It was as good as it gets.The fun
thing to see was to watch her confidence grow, watch her want the
ball more and more and more."
