# BURSTING THE BEAVER DAM
## Card is undefeated against Oregon State 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
After emphatically defeating both Washington schools at
home last weekend, the No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball team
will head north to Oregon to battle unranked Oregon State
tonight and No. 15 Oregon on Saturday night.
This past weekend, the Card battled Washington State for a 3-
1 win. All-American junior Cassidy Lichtman tallied her fifth
triple-double of the season versus the Cougars and junior Alix

Klineman reached dou
ble digits with 20 kills. Se
nior Janet Okogbaa led
the defense with seven
blocks.
"I think we showed
ourselves and everyone
else that we can play with
and beat one of the bet
ter teams in the nation,
and that confidence will
help us in future tough
matches," said freshman
setter Karissa Cook. "I
don't, however, think
that our wins will cause
us to overlook two very
solid Oregon teams. Our
confidence is not over
confidence, and we are
not taking either of these
teams lightly."
Stanford gave then-
No. 3 Washington a run
for their money when
they took the Huskies to
five sets on Saturday
night, ultimately winning
3-2.The Card handed the
Huskies, previously un
defeated in the season
and in matches, their first
loss of the year. Okogbaa
led Stanford with 21 kills
in just 36 attempts, earn
ing the honor of Pac-10
Player of the Week. Her

outstanding performance also sparked a team highlight as a
whole, the Stanford defense registered 15 blocks against Wash
ington.
"I think there were a lot of reasons for our team to be excited
this weekend; definitely one of them was Janet's performance,"
said Head Coach John Dunning. "It was as good as it gets.The fun
thing to see was to watch her confidence grow, watch her want the
ball more and more and more."

State, with an overall series record of 48-0.
Last weekend, Stanford shut down the pre

Other highlights of the night included
Cook, with 45 assists, and Klineman, with 14
kills and five blocks. With last weekend's
success under her belt, junior Gabi Ailes
needs only three more digs to beat out
Olympian Kerri Walsh's record.
Last weekend, Oregon State went 1-1
against the Arizona schools. They pulled
away with a 3-2 win against Arizona State,
but fell to Arizona 3-2.
While Stanford is a perfect 48-0 histori
cally against the Beavers, the team still
presents challenges for the Card.
"They have two really good outside hit
ters who are going to get about 60 percent
of the sets, and they really scramble on de
fense," Dunning said. "When you play a
team that really scrambles, you have to
match that. If they have more energy than
you do, then you have a problem."
Against Oregon State, Stanford needs
to come with fire in order to take control of
the game early. Shutting down the two best
hitters on the team will be a key component
in Stanford's defensive strategy. The Cardi
nal block, a proven success in the past two
weekends, will be another tool Stanford
needs to utilize against this offense driven
team.
"We have the people who can make us a
really good blocking team," Dunning said.
"We just have to keep getting better at it."
The Oregon Ducks are coming off a
weekend in which they swept Arizona 3-0
and lost to Arizona State 3-1. Hitter Sonja
Newcombe recorded her fourth double
double against Arizona with 26 kills and 11
digs. Heather Meyers, who currently
switches between outside hitter and right
side hitter, led Oregon against Arizona
State with 14 kills, eight digs,five blocks and
two aces.
As the record books show, the Ducks
have consistently failed to best the Card.
Dunning holds a 16-0 record against Ore
gon during his time at Stanford. While this
feat is impressive, the Ducks still have a
solid volleyball program.They reflect many
of the other teams in the Pac-10, particular
ly UCLA's fast-paced system.
"We've already played three or four
teams that are like [Oregon], so our team
will have a feel for it, but it still will be a
switch of gears," Dunning said. "We'll have
to do that quickly from one day to the
next."
The faster sets require the Card to be on
its toes while still performing as a fluid and
functional unit. Staying disciplined in order
to commit the fewest possible errors will be
essential to beat the Ducks.
"I think this weekend we are going to be
focusing on carrying over the positives
from last weekend," Cook said. "We are al
ways trying to improve and this weekend is
no different. These matches are both great
opportunities for our team to get better."
The Card needs to bring its block and
solid defense against Oregon State, and
keep it together and fluid against Oregon
to maintain the tone they have set for them
selves in the Pac-10.
The two matches begin at 7 p.m. tonight
and Saturday.

loss of the year. Okogbaa
led Stanford with 21 kills
in just 36 attempts, earn
ing the honor of Pac-10
Player of the Week. Her

outstanding performance also sparked a team highlight as a
whole, the Stanford defense registered 15 blocks against Wash
ington.
"I think there were a lot of reasons for our team to be excited
this weekend; definitely one of them was Janet's performance,"
said Head Coach John Dunning. "It was as good as it gets.The fun
thing to see was to watch her confidence grow, watch her want the
ball more and more and more."

Other highlights of the night included
Cook, with 45 assists, and Klineman, with 14
kills and five blocks. With last weekend's
success under her belt, junior Gabi Ailes
needs only three more digs to beat out
Olympian Kerri Walsh's record.
Last weekend, Oregon State went 1-1
against the Arizona schools. They pulled
away with a 3-2 win against Arizona State,
but fell to Arizona 3-2.
While Stanford is a perfect 48-0 histori
cally against the Beavers, the team still
presents challenges for the Card.
"They have two really good outside hit
ters who are going to get about 60 percent
of the sets, and they really scramble on de
fense," Dunning said. "When you play a
team that really scrambles, you have to
match that. If they have more energy than
you do, then you have a problem."
Against Oregon State, Stanford needs
to come with fire in order to take control of
the game early. Shutting down the two best
hitters on the team will be a key component
in Stanford's defensive strategy. The Cardi
nal block, a proven success in the past two
weekends, will be another tool Stanford
needs to utilize against this offense driven
team.
"We have the people who can make us a
really good blocking team," Dunning said.
"We just have to keep getting better at it."
The Oregon Ducks are coming off a
weekend in which they swept Arizona 3-0
and lost to Arizona State 3-1. Hitter Sonja
Newcombe recorded her fourth double
double against Arizona with 26 kills and 11
digs. Heather Meyers, who currently
switches between outside hitter and right
side hitter, led Oregon against Arizona
State with 14 kills, eight digs,five blocks and
two aces.
As the record books show, the Ducks
have consistently failed to best the Card.
Dunning holds a 16-0 record against Ore
gon during his time at Stanford. While this
feat is impressive, the Ducks still have a
solid volleyball program.They reflect many
of the other teams in the Pac-10, particular
ly UCLA's fast-paced system.
"We've already played three or four
teams that are like [Oregon], so our team
will have a feel for it, but it still will be a
switch of gears," Dunning said. "We'll have
to do that quickly from one day to the
next."
The faster sets require the Card to be on
its toes while still performing as a fluid and
functional unit. Staying disciplined in order
to commit the fewest possible errors will be
essential to beat the Ducks.
"I think this weekend we are going to be
focusing on carrying over the positives
from last weekend," Cook said. "We are al
ways trying to improve and this weekend is
no different. These matches are both great
opportunities for our team to get better."
The Card needs to bring its block and
solid defense against Oregon State, and
keep it together and fluid against Oregon
to maintain the tone they have set for them
selves in the Pac-10.
The two matches begin at 7 p.m. tonight
and Saturday.

Women's volleyball travels north to face unranked Oregon State and No. 15 Oregon. The Cardinal
has never lost a match to Oregon State, and, at 46-2, its record against Oregon is not much
worse. Stanford comes off two victories against ranked opponents last weekend at Maples Pavilion.
