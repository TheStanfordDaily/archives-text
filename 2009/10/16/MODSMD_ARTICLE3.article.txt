## Cardinal tries to rebound from first Pac-10 loss 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It has become practically trite, at this
point, to emphasize the importance of
each conference game the Cardinal has
to play this year. Stanford had to beat
Washington to prove they could down a
quality opponent; they had to beat
UCLA both for revenge and to show,
definitively, that they were downtrod
den no longer; and they had to beat
Oregon State to demonstrate that they
could win on the road. While they ac
complished their first two tasks, the
third has proved elusive, as both of
Stanford's losses have come away from
The Farm. But they'll have a chance to
rectify that when they head to Tucson to
take on Arizona this Saturday.
Both teams are coming off disheart
ening losses. The Cardinal was blown
out in Corvallis and the Wildcats lost to

Washington on a dubious interception
return late in the fourth quarter. The
two squads pose a considerable chal
lenge to one another as both try to get
back on track.
Arizona's lone losses are to the
Huskies and at lowa the Hawkeyes
are currently ranked No. 11 in the coun
try. Meanwhile, the Wildcats beat Ore
gon State on the road, and downed a
talented Central Michigan team at
home.
They've been successful through
good play on both sides of the ball. Ari
zona ranks 17th in total defense and
21st against the run. Quarterback Nick
Foles has been a revelation of sorts, as
he's already thrown for 737 yards and 6
touchdowns despite starting only the
last two games.
"I think he has a real understanding
of what they're doing. I think they are
adding to his package every week,"

Stanford Head Coach Jim Harbaugh
said of Foles. "He is doing a really good
job of spreading the ball around."
The distribution point is particularly
key: The Cardinal has struggled against
teams that have utilized their speed, es
pecially in the open field. Against the
Beavers last weekend, the defense sim
ply had no answer for the quick
Jacquizz Rodgers.
But the Wildcats' star running back
Nic Grigsby and his backup, Keola An
tolin, are nursing injuries and it is still
not clear whether or not they will play
and, if they do, for how long. Removing
either of the two runners would take
away a significant speed advantage for
the Arizona offense. It will also force
Foles to throw more, but the young
quarterback has so far demonstrated
that he is up to the task.
