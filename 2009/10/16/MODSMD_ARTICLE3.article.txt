## Cardinal tries to rebound from first Pac-10 loss 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It has become practically trite, at this
point, to emphasize the importance of
each conference game the Cardinal has
to play this year. Stanford had to beat
Washington to prove they could down a
quality opponent; they had to beat
UCLA both for revenge and to show,
definitively, that they were downtrod
den no longer; and they had to beat
Oregon State to demonstrate that they
could win on the road. While they ac
complished their first two tasks, the
third has proved elusive, as both of
Stanford's losses have come away from
The Farm. But they'll have a chance to
rectify that when they head to Tucson to
take on Arizona this Saturday.
Both teams are coming off disheart
ening losses. The Cardinal was blown
out in Corvallis and the Wildcats lost to

Washington on a dubious interception
return late in the fourth quarter. The
two squads pose a considerable chal
lenge to one another as both try to get
back on track.
Arizona's lone losses are to the
Huskies and at lowa the Hawkeyes
are currently ranked No. 11 in the coun
try. Meanwhile, the Wildcats beat Ore
gon State on the road, and downed a
talented Central Michigan team at
home.
They've been successful through
good play on both sides of the ball. Ari
zona ranks 17th in total defense and
21st against the run. Quarterback Nick
Foles has been a revelation of sorts, as
he's already thrown for 737 yards and 6
touchdowns despite starting only the
last two games.
"I think he has a real understanding
of what they're doing. I think they are
adding to his package every week,"

Stanford Head Coach Jim Harbaugh
said of Foles. "He is doing a really good
job of spreading the ball around."
The distribution point is particularly
key: The Cardinal has struggled against
teams that have utilized their speed, es
pecially in the open field. Against the
Beavers last weekend, the defense sim
ply had no answer for the quick
Jacquizz Rodgers.
But the Wildcats' star running back
Nic Grigsby and his backup, Keola An
tolin, are nursing injuries and it is still
not clear whether or not they will play
and, if they do, for how long. Removing
either of the two runners would take
away a significant speed advantage for
the Arizona offense. It will also force
Foles to throw more, but the young
quarterback has so far demonstrated
that he is up to the task.

NOTES ! Stanford suffered its first conference
loss to Oregon State on the road last week
end. The Card looks to get back on track in
Tucson and continue its four game winning
streak at Arizona's stadium. Arizona also
comes off a loss last weekend, having suf
fered a 36-33 defeat at Washington.

Stanford, however, has toyed
with its defense to try and optimize
its lineup; linebacker Shayne Skov,
who took over for junior Chike
Amajoyi on the weak side in the
second half last week, is expected to
see considerable playing time, and
the Cardinal was rotating most of its
defensive backs throughout this
week's practice.
Meanwhile, the Wildcats may
have to make defensive adjust
ments of their own, as two of their
starters have injuries of their own
both are expected to play. De
spite Arizona's wounds, Cardinal
players emphasized the complete
ness of the Wildcats' defense.
"They have the best DBs we
have played so far this year," said
senior running back Toby Gerhart.
"Their linebackers are quick and
play downhill. Their defensive line
is fast and physical. They are a good

defense and we're going to have to
be on our A-game."
Gerhart, who had a respectable
performance against the Beavers,
certainly not up to his usual stan
dards, will look to reassert himself.
Meanwhile, redshirt freshman quar
terback Andrew Luck will have to
do battle against a secondary that
features two shutdown cornerbacks
in Devin Ross and Trevin Wade.
"When the ball is in the air, they
run around and almost turn like a
receiver going up to get the ball with
both hands," Luck said.
It will certainly be a difficult
challenge, especially because the
game carries even greater meaning
than simply showing that the Cardi
nal can win on the road. Beat Ari
zona, and last week's loss becomes
an aberration for a team that is truly
in the Rose Bowl race at the
halfway point. But lose to the Wild-

cats, and all of a sudden the Cardi
nal will find itself right back in the
middle of the conference, needing
two wins against a difficult schedule
in order to just qualify for a bowl.
It's fitting that this match up
would come when it had right in
the heart of Stanford's schedule.
The proverbial fork in the road is
here. One path leads to redemption;
the other starts a dangerous trend.

NOTES: Starting senior defensive end Erik
Lorig continues to be hampered by a
groin injury, and is not listed on Satur
day's depth chart. Stanford's punters,
sophomore David Green and fresh
man Daniel Zychlinski, will likely split
time this weekend, as neither one has
pulled ahead in their on-going compe
tition

Stanford, however, has toyed
with its defense to try and optimize
its lineup; linebacker Shayne Skov,
who took over for junior Chike
Amajoyi on the weak side in the
second half last week, is expected to
see considerable playing time, and
the Cardinal was rotating most of its
defensive backs throughout this
week's practice.
Meanwhile, the Wildcats may
have to make defensive adjust
ments of their own, as two of their
starters have injuries of their own
both are expected to play. De
spite Arizona's wounds, Cardinal
players emphasized the complete
ness of the Wildcats' defense.
"They have the best DBs we
have played so far this year," said
senior running back Toby Gerhart.
"Their linebackers are quick and
play downhill. Their defensive line
is fast and physical. They are a good

defense and we're going to have to
be on our A-game."
Gerhart, who had a respectable
performance against the Beavers,
certainly not up to his usual stan
dards, will look to reassert himself.
Meanwhile, redshirt freshman quar
terback Andrew Luck will have to
do battle against a secondary that
features two shutdown cornerbacks
in Devin Ross and Trevin Wade.
"When the ball is in the air, they
run around and almost turn like a
receiver going up to get the ball with
both hands," Luck said.
It will certainly be a difficult
challenge, especially because the
game carries even greater meaning
than simply showing that the Cardi
nal can win on the road. Beat Ari
zona, and last week's loss becomes
an aberration for a team that is truly
in the Rose Bowl race at the
halfway point. But lose to the Wild-

cats, and all of a sudden the Cardi
nal will find itself right back in the
middle of the conference, needing
two wins against a difficult schedule
in order to just qualify for a bowl.
It's fitting that this match up
would come when it had right in
the heart of Stanford's schedule.
The proverbial fork in the road is
here. One path leads to redemption;
the other starts a dangerous trend.

NOTES: Starting senior defensive end Erik
Lorig continues to be hampered by a
groin injury, and is not listed on Satur
day's depth chart. Stanford's punters,
sophomore David Green and fresh
man Daniel Zychlinski, will likely split
time this weekend, as neither one has
pulled ahead in their on-going compe
tition
