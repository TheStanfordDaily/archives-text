# LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE: 20 YEARS LATER
## Staff recount their experiences from when the quake hit The Farm 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Oakland A's and San Francisco Gi
ants were playing the third game of the
World Series in San Francisco. But at 5:04
p.m. on Oct. 17, 1989, a reverberation of
rumbling that had nothing to do with rag
ing fans swept across the Bay.
Fifteen seconds later, all went quiet.
The 7.1-magnitude Loma Prieta earth
quake, perhaps the worst the Bay Area
had seen since 1906, had just made its
mark on the Bay Area.

And by no means did Stanford escape
its destruction.

"The first thing I noticed was the
noise," recalled Pat White, a Stanford li

brary specialist. She had been waiting for
the elevator in Green Library, just outside
what were then the archives on the top
floor. "I'd wondered what that was. I had
n't heard anything quite like that, and then
a couple seconds later I felt the shaking."
White felt incredibly lucky to have nar
rowly missed boarding the elevator that
Tuesday afternoon in 1989.
"I had left at just the right time so [the
elevator] didn't have time to get to me
because I would not have wanted to be in
that elevator," she said with a laugh. After
making her way to a staircase and leaving
the building, she remembers feeling wind
ed and coughing from inhaling plaster that
had come off the walls.

"It was really difficult to breathe because there
was a lot of plaster dust," she said, "It was an
unnerving experience."

Quite a Shaker
The quake, which occurred along the San
Andreas fault, claimed 63 lives, injured countless
others and fractured the Bay Bridge and more than
a thousand homes.
"I saw the glass going in and out," said Polly
Armstrong, a library specialist in Special
Collections. But Armstrong remembers what fol
lowed the quake better: A waist-high mountain of
books and plywood on walls of the library "holding
it all together."
Stanford was one of the earthquake's many
victims, leaving a hefty bill of $l6O million in
repairs in its wake. Following Loma Prieta, the
University spent another $llO million to retrofit
older buildings.

Then-University President Donald Kennedy
wasn't on the ground when Loma Prieta hit, but his
United Airlines flight was redirected from San
Francisco to Los Angeles. Kennedy was relieved
when the plane finally touched down and he was
able to contact family and administrators here at
Stanford.
"I felt terribly thankful that Stanford hadn't had
any fatalities, and that we had made a serious com
mitment to life protection," he said. "We escaped."
Kennedy chuckled as he recalled the lightheart
ed demeanor with which four members of the
Stanford men's swimming team responded to the
quake, rocking a trailer in Manzanita at 2 a.m. to
prank their teammates with an aftershock scare.
Manzanita had become a "tent city" of sorts as
housing repair projects commenced. Displaced stu
dents slept in sleeping bags across the lawn until
trailers were assessed for safe use. The Kennedys
also housed students in the Lou Henry Hoover
President's house for a week.

A Slow Recovery
Although the livelihood of Stanford's faculty
and students remained virtually unchanged, sever
al of the older buildings on campus faced major
damage.

Buildings here were recovered and retrofitted
over the next 10. Some offices were moved to trail
ers to accommodate massive repair and the rein
forcement of older buildings to new seismic codes.
The Geology Corner was in shambles, and what
is now the Bing Wing of Green Library also needed
major repair. The balconies of the beloved
Memorial Church were destroyed and, when cou
pled with damages to the Cantor Arts Center, cost
more than $l5 million to recover.
Joyce Kiefer, then an administrative assistant in
the Science, Technology and Society program,
recalled what it was like to return to campus the day
after the quake to make a phone call in her office,
which had been taped off with caution signs.
"There was a creepy feel to the whole place
because there were cracks in the walls and there
was that musty smell of plaster," Kiefer recalled. "I
could watch the paint bubbles or plaster bubbles,
whatever they were, flaking or cracking."
According to Kennedy, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) helped the
University assess its damages and reimbursed
Stanford for part of its damages. With fundraising
help from the Development Office, interested facul-

ty and volunteer committees, under
the leadership of John Ford, the
University raised the funds neces
sary to finish repairing and retro
fitting most of its academic buildings
and residences.

Looking back at the earthquake
from the Mitchell Earth Sciences
building, which was one of many
buildings that underwent significant
retrofitting, Mark Zoback, a geo
physics professor, deemed the quake
"a real wake-up call."
"As devastating as it was, it was
probably maybe a good thing,
because we're that much more pre
pared," Zoback said.

Moving Forward
Forecasting the frequency of
earthquakes involves a tedious
process of detective work and exca
vation that includes examining faults
and carbon-dating sedimentary lay
ers to determine the frequency of
rifts that cause quakes.

According to Greg Beroza,
another geophysics professor, the
chances of at least one other earth
quake of a similar magnitude to
Loma Prieta are very high. There is a
two-in-three chance that a similar
quake will rock the Bay Area within
the next 30 years.
The problem is that current tech
niques offer vague predictions of
when quakes will hit and can only
detect large quakes. The specifics of
short-term quake detection are not
yet, and may never be, possible.
"I can't tell you when that's going
to be, but some faults are moving
quickly," Beroza said. "The most
likely candidate is the Hayward
fault."
The temperamental fault in ques
tion is just across the Bay, and an
earthquake located much closer to
Stanford's swaying palm trees may
cause stronger shakes to be felt on
campus.
Associate Vice Provost of
Environmental Health & Safety
Larry Gibbs assured residents, how
ever, that the University is ready for
a quake if and when it happens, and
will continue to prepare to manage
emergency situations.

The University has bolstered its
emergency staff with a full-time
emergency manager for planning
and coordination of earthquakes
and other disasters, as well as volun
teer building assessment teams.

In addition, the ALERTSU out
reach motivation program sends text
messages and e-mails to students
and faculty about what to do during
an emergency. Residential
Education and Student Affairs are
also working to prepare new stu
dents with information about how to
prepare themselves for earthquakes
and other emergency situations.
Seven sirens have already been
installed around campus to alert
those walking outdoors about cam
pus safety in emergency situations.
Beroza approaches the relative
unpredictability and power of
quakes with a "respect, but no
panic" philosophy.
"You can't count on getting more
warning than you already have," he
said. "Earthquakes happen sudden
ly. That means the time to get pre
pared is now."

repairs in its wake. Following Loma Prieta, the
University spent another $llO million to retrofit
older buildings.

Then-University President Donald Kennedy
wasn't on the ground when Loma Prieta hit, but his
United Airlines flight was redirected from San
Francisco to Los Angeles. Kennedy was relieved
when the plane finally touched down and he was
able to contact family and administrators here at
Stanford.
"I felt terribly thankful that Stanford hadn't had
any fatalities, and that we had made a serious com
mitment to life protection," he said. "We escaped."
Kennedy chuckled as he recalled the lightheart
ed demeanor with which four members of the
Stanford men's swimming team responded to the
quake, rocking a trailer in Manzanita at 2 a.m. to
prank their teammates with an aftershock scare.
Manzanita had become a "tent city" of sorts as
housing repair projects commenced. Displaced stu
dents slept in sleeping bags across the lawn until
trailers were assessed for safe use. The Kennedys
also housed students in the Lou Henry Hoover
President's house for a week.

A Slow Recovery
Although the livelihood of Stanford's faculty
and students remained virtually unchanged, sever
al of the older buildings on campus faced major
damage.

Buildings here were recovered and retrofitted
over the next 10. Some offices were moved to trail
ers to accommodate massive repair and the rein
forcement of older buildings to new seismic codes.
The Geology Corner was in shambles, and what
is now the Bing Wing of Green Library also needed
major repair. The balconies of the beloved
Memorial Church were destroyed and, when cou
pled with damages to the Cantor Arts Center, cost
more than $l5 million to recover.
Joyce Kiefer, then an administrative assistant in
the Science, Technology and Society program,
recalled what it was like to return to campus the day
after the quake to make a phone call in her office,
which had been taped off with caution signs.
"There was a creepy feel to the whole place
because there were cracks in the walls and there
was that musty smell of plaster," Kiefer recalled. "I
could watch the paint bubbles or plaster bubbles,
whatever they were, flaking or cracking."
According to Kennedy, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) helped the
University assess its damages and reimbursed
Stanford for part of its damages. With fundraising
help from the Development Office, interested facul-

ty and volunteer committees, under
the leadership of John Ford, the
University raised the funds neces
sary to finish repairing and retro
fitting most of its academic buildings
and residences.

Looking back at the earthquake
from the Mitchell Earth Sciences
building, which was one of many
buildings that underwent significant
retrofitting, Mark Zoback, a geo
physics professor, deemed the quake
"a real wake-up call."
"As devastating as it was, it was
probably maybe a good thing,
because we're that much more pre
pared," Zoback said.

Moving Forward
Forecasting the frequency of
earthquakes involves a tedious
process of detective work and exca
vation that includes examining faults
and carbon-dating sedimentary lay
ers to determine the frequency of
rifts that cause quakes.

According to Greg Beroza,
another geophysics professor, the
chances of at least one other earth
quake of a similar magnitude to
Loma Prieta are very high. There is a
two-in-three chance that a similar
quake will rock the Bay Area within
the next 30 years.
The problem is that current tech
niques offer vague predictions of
when quakes will hit and can only
detect large quakes. The specifics of
short-term quake detection are not
yet, and may never be, possible.
"I can't tell you when that's going
to be, but some faults are moving
quickly," Beroza said. "The most
likely candidate is the Hayward
fault."
The temperamental fault in ques
tion is just across the Bay, and an
earthquake located much closer to
Stanford's swaying palm trees may
cause stronger shakes to be felt on
campus.
Associate Vice Provost of
Environmental Health & Safety
Larry Gibbs assured residents, how
ever, that the University is ready for
a quake if and when it happens, and
will continue to prepare to manage
emergency situations.

The University has bolstered its
emergency staff with a full-time
emergency manager for planning
and coordination of earthquakes
and other disasters, as well as volun
teer building assessment teams.

In addition, the ALERTSU out
reach motivation program sends text
messages and e-mails to students
and faculty about what to do during
an emergency. Residential
Education and Student Affairs are
also working to prepare new stu
dents with information about how to
prepare themselves for earthquakes
and other emergency situations.
Seven sirens have already been
installed around campus to alert
those walking outdoors about cam
pus safety in emergency situations.
Beroza approaches the relative
unpredictability and power of
quakes with a "respect, but no
panic" philosophy.
"You can't count on getting more
warning than you already have," he
said. "Earthquakes happen sudden
ly. That means the time to get pre
pared is now."

The Oakland A's and San Francisco Gi
ants were playing the third game of the
World Series in San Francisco. But at 5:04
p.m. on Oct. 17, 1989, a reverberation of
rumbling that had nothing to do with rag
ing fans swept across the Bay.
Fifteen seconds later, all went quiet.
The 7.1-magnitude Loma Prieta earth
quake, perhaps the worst the Bay Area
had seen since 1906, had just made its
mark on the Bay Area.

And by no means did Stanford escape
its destruction.

"The first thing I noticed was the
noise," recalled Pat White, a Stanford li

brary specialist. She had been waiting for
the elevator in Green Library, just outside
what were then the archives on the top
floor. "I'd wondered what that was. I had
n't heard anything quite like that, and then
a couple seconds later I felt the shaking."
White felt incredibly lucky to have nar
rowly missed boarding the elevator that
Tuesday afternoon in 1989.
"I had left at just the right time so [the
elevator] didn't have time to get to me
because I would not have wanted to be in
that elevator," she said with a laugh. After
making her way to a staircase and leaving
the building, she remembers feeling wind
ed and coughing from inhaling plaster that
had come off the walls.

"It was really difficult to breathe because there
was a lot of plaster dust," she said, "It was an
unnerving experience."

Quite a Shaker
The quake, which occurred along the San
Andreas fault, claimed 63 lives, injured countless
others and fractured the Bay Bridge and more than
a thousand homes.
"I saw the glass going in and out," said Polly
Armstrong, a library specialist in Special
Collections. But Armstrong remembers what fol
lowed the quake better: A waist-high mountain of
books and plywood on walls of the library "holding
it all together."
Stanford was one of the earthquake's many
victims, leaving a hefty bill of $l6O million in
