Two days shy of the infamous
Loma Prieta Earthquake's 20th an
niversary, a panel of earthquake ex
perts gathered Thursday night in
Memorial Auditorium to ruminate
on the Bay Area's readiness for an
other seismic incident.
Hosted by the School of Earth
Sciences, the event brought together
speakers who spanned a variety of
perspectives, including academia,
public safety, engineering and gov
ernment research.
"We are here tonight because in
the next 40 years we are going to ex
perience a big earthquake in the San

Francisco Bay Area," said geo
physics Prof. Mark Zoback at the
event's opening.
Zoback went on to discuss Stan
ford's current earthquake prepared
ness, which includes the significant
retrofitting of Main Quad buildings
in 1999. However, he claimed that
some structures, including Stanford
Hospital, do not meet current build
ing codes.
"This building will not be func
tional after a significant earthquake
in the Bay Area," Zoback cautioned
of the hospital.
Currently, Stanford Hospital is

Chris Poland, CEO of engineering firm Degenkolb Engineers,
believes the lessons learned from Loma Prieta
directly led to the design of safer modern structures.
