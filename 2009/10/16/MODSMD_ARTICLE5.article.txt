# Earthquake experts discuss safety, try to predict future

### ALEX YU 
Two days shy of the infamous
Loma Prieta Earthquake's 20th an
niversary, a panel of earthquake ex
perts gathered Thursday night in
Memorial Auditorium to ruminate
on the Bay Area's readiness for an
other seismic incident.
Hosted by the School of Earth
Sciences, the event brought together
speakers who spanned a variety of
perspectives, including academia,
public safety, engineering and gov
ernment research.
"We are here tonight because in
the next 40 years we are going to ex
perience a big earthquake in the San

Francisco Bay Area," said geo
physics Prof. Mark Zoback at the
event's opening.
Zoback went on to discuss Stan
ford's current earthquake prepared
ness, which includes the significant
retrofitting of Main Quad buildings
in 1999. However, he claimed that
some structures, including Stanford
Hospital, do not meet current build
ing codes.
"This building will not be func
tional after a significant earthquake
in the Bay Area," Zoback cautioned
of the hospital.
Currently, Stanford Hospital is

directly led to the design of safer modern structures.
slated for a massive expansion and
seismic improvement project.

Zoback's colleague, Prof. Greg
Beroza, emphasized that seismic pre
diction technology is a means to pro
tect Bay Area structures.
"Earthquake prediction is a holy
grail of seismology," he said, but
qualified his statement by stating
that it's practically impossible to
develop accurate forecasting sys
tems.

But by utilizing these prediction
techniques, Mary Lou Zoback, vice
president of earthquake risk appli
cations at Risk Management
Solutions, extrapolated geophysical
data to warn about the possibility of
a major earthquake in the next 30
years.

"For the Hayward fault, what we
found is that it happens pretty regu
larly," she noted. '"On average, every
140 years there's a major earth

quake. The last one was 1868."
Chris Poland, CEO and chairman
of Bay Area structural engineering
firm Degenkolb Engineers, analyzed
the fringe benefits of Loma Prieta,
saying modern buildings are more
structurally sound in terms of earth
quake preparedness, and are more
cost-effective as well.

Through post-Loma Prieta
improvements, Poland asserted that
San Francisco will eventually
become a "resilient city." Still, Poland
joined his fellow speakers to warn
the audience about the structural
integrity of Bay Area structures.
"All the buildings built before the
mid-'7os are questionable," he said.
"Those are the ones we need to
worry about."
Amid the warnings, though,
speakers also commented on recent
seismic research breakthroughs.
Beroza noted that earthquake
research focus has turned to equip
ping the average resident with tools
to evade a major quake's disastrous
results. Developers are currently
working on an iPhone alert system
that can warn a user up to 20 seconds

before the onset of an earthquake.
The final speaker of the night,
Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold
Schapelhouman, commended the
government's initiation of the Urban
Search and Rescue Teams following
the Loma Prieta quake.
"The government no longer could
just write checks to solve problems,"
he argued. "[As a result], the nation
al response system as it exists today
started in 1989."

He also encouraged individual
communities rather than the state
government to begin the process of
preparing for a seismic incident. "It's
about community efforts," he said.
"It's about helping your neighbors
out. There are not enough of us to go
around."

However, Schapelhouman
stressed the final responsibility still
lies in the individual: "Many people
want to relay responsibility to local
government. That responsibility lies
in each one of us. It starts with all of
us. It ends with all of us."
