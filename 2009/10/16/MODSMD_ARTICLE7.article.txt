The marathon is on and organizers say it's bigger than ever.
Stanford Dance Marathon, the annual 24-hour fundraiser
for HIV/AIDS nonprofits, is set to mark its sixth reprise this
February and leaders say what started with two students deter
mined to raise money and awareness is seeing a spike in cam
pus popularity today.
With 400 student "dancers" and counting on the guest list
Tuesday, executives said curious freshmen and nostalgic seniors
have been especially receptive to the advertisements "One
Day. One Party. One Cause," "Are You Hardcore?" and the
"Biggest Party of the Year!" covering campus this quarter.
But with the Arrillaga Alumni Center-housed event still

months away, many are
wondering: Why the
early start?
"It's so that we can
start to focus on
fundraising and building
this great community,"
said Tristana Perkl TO,
one of this year's fresh
man outreach execu
tives. "If we're still get
ting sign-ups in
November and
December, that only
leaves the three weeks
after winter break to get
everything else togeth
er."
Another reason, said
Director Patricia Arty
'lO, is to give dancers as
much time as possible to
raise the $192 they
promise when they reg
ister. Students raised
$140,000, including
matching donations, in
2009.
Although fundraising
could seem a daunting
task in the wake of last

year's economic woes, Dance Marathon organizers said they
probably won't be feeling the effects of the recession as acute
ly as last year.
"We're over the [economic] hump, at least psychologically,"
said Event Experience Executive Alexandra Coleman 'l2.
"We've been coming up with way more creative ways [for stu
dents] to fundraise, because that's an integral part of DM."
As in past years, marathon teams are encouraged to hold
group fundraisers, such as dorm pancake breakfasts and car
washes.
"Letter-writing is really powerful... even if people only
give you $5, if you ask 10 people that's already 50 bucks," said
Perkl. "Reach out to people in your community."
Making a return appearance at the 2010 marathon is the 24-

"It's so that we
can start to focus
on fundraising
and building
this great
community''
