## University rolls out two hybrid buses for Marguerite fleet 
### RYAN MAYFIELD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stopping to pick up passengers,
bus driver Michael Moses swung
open the doors to tired faces on
their way home from work and
class. But as the passengers quickly
boarded, walking between gray
toned seats decorated in swirls of
blues and reds, they noticed some
thing different about this
Marguerite.
With the new-car smell still lin
gering, they seated themselves as
the bus wheeled away to complete
its final B-line route of the night.
Yet, instead of the usual roar of the
engines and smell of diesel, the rid
ers were treated to a surprising
silence and fresh air.
For the University, these were
the signs of an environmental
investment a million dollar
investment, in fact. Recently,
Parking and Transportation
Services (P&TS) purchased two
hybrid diesel-electric buses for the
Marguerite shuttle service at
$500,000 apiece.
While they are still currently
under testing, the buses will soon
become a permanent fixture circling
campus, after having gained the
administration's confidence. While
the hybrid buses cost $200,000 more
than is spent for regular diesel
buses, they are 40 percent more
fuel-efficient and will save the
University money over time at a

Recently, the University purchased two hybrid diesel-fuel buses to join the Marguerite shuttle service at $500,000 apiece. The buses are 40 percent more fuel efficient than current Marguerites.
