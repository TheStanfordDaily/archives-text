## University rolls out two hybrid buses for Marguerite fleet 
### RYAN MAYFIELD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stopping to pick up passengers,
bus driver Michael Moses swung
open the doors to tired faces on
their way home from work and
class. But as the passengers quickly
boarded, walking between gray
toned seats decorated in swirls of
blues and reds, they noticed some
thing different about this
Marguerite.
With the new-car smell still lin
gering, they seated themselves as
the bus wheeled away to complete
its final B-line route of the night.
Yet, instead of the usual roar of the
engines and smell of diesel, the rid
ers were treated to a surprising
silence and fresh air.
For the University, these were
the signs of an environmental
investment a million dollar
investment, in fact. Recently,
Parking and Transportation
Services (P&TS) purchased two
hybrid diesel-electric buses for the
Marguerite shuttle service at
$500,000 apiece.
While they are still currently
under testing, the buses will soon
become a permanent fixture circling
campus, after having gained the
administration's confidence. While
the hybrid buses cost $200,000 more
than is spent for regular diesel
buses, they are 40 percent more
fuel-efficient and will save the
University money over time at a

Recently, the University purchased two hybrid diesel-fuel buses to join the Marguerite shuttle service at $500,000 apiece. The buses are 40 percent more fuel efficient than current Marguerites.
rate of approximately $7,000 per
year on fuel alone.
"We don't use up much diesel, it
runs on battery power and only
uses diesel to charge the batteries,"
Moses, a new bus driver, said.
"We're not throwing [anything]
into the atmosphere."
Accelerating smoothly after a
stop, Moses showed the new
maneuvering ability of the hybrids.
In decelerating, which was also
demonstrated by Moses, the bus
came to a smooth gradual stop, in
which the driver barely needed to
apply the brake. According to the
driver, this helps reduce wear and
tear on the tires, further saving
money.
Plus, it helps with bikers and
pedestrians coming from all direc
tions, with Moses stopping quickly
yet efficiently, as a biker shot across
an intersection in front of the bus
just as he was about to accelerate.
"This is a different animal here
with all the bikes and pedestrians,"
Moses said. "Bikes just shoot out,
[and] buses just don't stop like a
car."

Yet, even with the distinctive
handling and environmental advan
tages of the hybrid buses, P&TS will
not be replacing their whole fleet
just yet. According to Brodie
Hamilton, director of P&TS, the
needs of the Marguerite line are
currently being met by the fleet as
is.
"Until such time as we need
more buses, we're looking at the
strategy of replacing [aging] buses
over time," Hamilton said.
Students on the bus, however,
felt the buses were a move in the
right direction for a University con
cerned with its environmental
image.
"It's probably a good step in the
green movement going on around
campus," said Brian Cheng 'l3.
Despite the relative newness of
the buses, Moses picked out a few
human-induced problems, stopping
to point out where individuals had
begun to peel off Emergency Exit
stickers "These are beautiful buses
and I hate to see them messed up,"
Moses said. "[lt's sad that] someone
at Stanford University is trying to
mess it up."
For now, these torn stickers
remain the only imperfections.
