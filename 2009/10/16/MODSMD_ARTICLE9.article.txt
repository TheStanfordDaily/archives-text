### ANN TYLER MOSES 
On Thursday evening, Stanford
hosted Dr. A. T. Ariyaratne, Sri
Lankan activist and founder of
Sarvodaya, a grassroots movement
aiding rural villages in Sri Lanka.
The Stanford Sarvodaya branch,
along with the Sri Lanka Students
Association, Stanford Buddhist
Community and Project Love put
on the event, which was attended by
about 100 members of the Stanford
community.
At the event, which began with
45 minutes of silent meditation,
Ariyaratne spoke about the spiritual
opportunities of public service
the basis of his movement,
Sarvodaya. Through his movement,
which translates into "awakening of
all," Sri Lankan students work in
over 15,000 rural villages digging
wells, building sanitation systems
and leading meditation, in an
attempt to meet the physical and
spiritual needs of the villagers.
"We are helping these communi
ties to help themselves to overcome
their poverty, through peace and
spiritual development," Ariyaratne
said.
Educated at Vidyodaya
University of Sri Lanka, Ariyaratne
received honorary doctorates from

that school as well as from Emilio
Aguinaldo College in the
Philippines. It was his time in at
school where he traveled to rural Sri
Lanka and witnessed the suffering
and indigence of villagers.
"I vowed, after my studies," he
recalled, "I will turn this country
upside down, to the best of my abili
ty."
With this goal in mind, he found
ed Sarvodaya and 50 years later the
movement has still remained intact
despite conflict raging through Sri
Lanka.
Among his many accolades,
Ariyaratne received the Gandhi
Peace Prize from the Indian govern
ment as well as the Acharya Sushil
Kumar International Peace Award.
In 2007, he was honored with the
Pride of Sri Lanka, his country's
highest honor.
Today, his group remains true to
its founding principles. He stressed
that the organization's authority
came from the lowest level and that
there is no hierarchy.
"Working like one family may be
the only hope to cure 30 years of
unnecessary bloodshed in our coun
try," he said. "I have the position of
leader, but I do not lead. I am presi
dent, but I do not preside."
Also, although the organization
strongly adheres to Buddhist princi
ples, Ariyaratne was a strong believ
er in the irrelevancy of religious
classification in service.
"Spirituality has no labels," he
said. "Some call it Buddhist love,

Christian love, Hindu love ... I
don't believe in that. Love is love."
However, Buddhist meditation
holds great significance in
Ariyaratne's work. He's led mass
meditation sessions, including one
that involved 950,000 people,
throughout Sri Lanka. He claimed
that the power of meditative silence
was a great contributor to
Sarvodaya's success.
"A silence like this affects human
consciousness," he said. "This is an
incredibly powerful thing."
Somik Raha, a graduate student
in management science and engi
neering, agreed. A member of
Stanford Sarvodaya, he stated that
the group engages in various service
activities in the community, such as
distributing laptops to the needy
and holding counseling sessions to
help students deal with stress, much
of which incorporates meditation.
"We try to turn that silence into
service action," Raha said.
Ariyaratne's presentation at
Stanford included a gift room, where
attendees were able to take and leave
small presents as tokens of kindness
and ended with a shared meal.
Ariyaratne viewed the evening as
a demonstration of how easily com
munity can be built.
"If you want, you can bring peo
ple together," he said, "not only for
games and destructive work, but for
internal joy."
