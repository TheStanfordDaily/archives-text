## SIX CHOSEN FOR JUDICIAL BOARD 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The committee charged with rec
ommending six student representa
tives to the Board of Judicial Affairs
has selected three men and three
women for the posts, a spokesperson
announced late Friday.
The recommended students are
Salone Kapur 'lO, Ruby Garrett 'lO,
Brandon Jackson 'l2, Ben Davidson
JD 'lO, computer science graduate
Nate Chambers and electrical engi
neering graduate Leili Baghaei
Rad.
Graduate student Eric Osborne,
speaking for the ad hoc committee
that interviewed applicants to the
board seats, said it is now up to the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
Graduate Student Council to
approve the recommendations.
The Senate is set to vote on the
matter Tuesday at its weekly meet
ing, at 7 p.m. in the Old Union
Nitery. The GSC meets Wednesday
at 6 p.m at the Graduate Student
Center Nairobi Room.
The selections come after a
months-long dispute between stu
dent government leaders and the
Office of Judicial Affairs, whom the
board oversees.
In June, five men and one woman
were recommended to the board by

the ASSU Nominations Commission.
The office, however, objected to a
"gender imbalance" and asked for a
revised slate, prompting the removal
of two male nominees in favor of two
new women.

The Senate and GSC would not
approve that slate, instead forming
an ad hoc committee to interview
candidates anew. Twenty-six stu
dents applied to that new round,
which occurred last Thursday.
Chambers, Davidson, Kapur and
Jackson were part of both the original
set of nominees and the first revised
list, in addition to their inclusion
among the current nominees. Neither
the two men removed in June nor the
two women who replaced them were
nominated this time.
