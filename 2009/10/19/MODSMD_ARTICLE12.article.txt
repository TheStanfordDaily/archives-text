## Sudhof gets $1.6M for autism research 
### TYLER BROWN 
Stanford Molecular and Cellular Biology
Prof. Thomas Sudhof was recently awarded a
two-year, $1.65 million grant by the National
Institute of Health to further his study of the
genetics behind autism.
The study of autism continues to pose a chal
lenge for researchers, as it is unclear exactly how
autism is induced and whether it is caused by a
few isolated mutations, a broad swath of genetic
abnormalities, or neither.
Sudhof's focus in studying the disease has
been the nervous system. His recent studies have
concerned the effects of several genes that code
for neuroligins, a family of proteins that are a key
component of synapses the junctions between
nerve cells. If the DNA that codes for the neu
roligins undergoes a mutation, it modifies the
neuroligins' structure and alters their function,
often to a detrimental effect.
While research suggests that neuroligin muta
tions are associated with autism, their precise
effects are still unknown.
Sudhof framed his central question as: "How
do these genes participate in shaping autism and
creating autism?"
He believes the grant will help deliver
answers.
"It will allow us to screen a large number of
candidate genes for possible synaptic functions,"
Sudhof said.
He intends to evaluate more than 50 "candi
date" genes genes with alterations that have
been associated with autism for synapse
forming roles that could influence the develop
ment of the disease.
Post-doctoral Associate Antony Boucard said,
"This screen is going to bring a much broader

understanding of how those molecules in the
[synapse] work they could be an independent
system."
Why Neuroligins?
Sudhof developed an interest in the relation
ship between neuroligins and autism after geneti
cists suggested a link between the two earlier in
the decade.
"Step back: The first gene [associated with
autism] was NLGN [pronounced 'neuroligin'],
about six years ago," Sudhof said. "That really
caused my interest because neuroligin is a pro
tein we had been studying for decades."
Of the genes that have been studied, Boucard
says NLGN was the one that had the most muta
tions in people with autism.
"So, the key question here is, 'Do other candi
date genes potentially function in synapses?'"
Sudhof said.
Sudhof's previous research had shown that
neuroligins are physically connected to "postsy
naptic" proteins receptors on the adjacent
neuron, called neurexins and are vital to
synapses' functions.
Synapses are activated by an electrical signal
within the neuron that prompts groups of pro
teins at the presynaptic site, including neuroli
gins, to secrete neurotransmitters. These neuro
transmitters then bind to receptors on an adja
cent neuron, communicating a signal.
If the signal-propagating proteins are mal
formed, the neurotransmitters are produced in
lower quantities and potentially possess atypical
chemical structures, weakening the signal. This
could, theoretically, be related to autism.
According to Sudhof, geneticists have identi
fied other genes that either interact with neuroli
gins or interact with proteins that interact with

neuroligins. These genes have been tagged as fur
ther candidate genes for autism.
"Now there is almost like a ... synaptic path
way for autism defined by these genes," he said.

Applications
Sudhof believes there is a lot of research yet
to be done before his study yields any benefits to
the medicine.

"The biggest problem in autism ... is that we
don't actually know how to diagnose or treat it
because we don't understand the disease at all,"
Sudhof said. "Any kind of rational drug design
requires identification of reasonable target...
whose pharmacological alterations may be help
ful to the patient."
And autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning
its severity and symptoms differ from case to
case and its potential causes vary widely.
M.D./Ph.D molecular biology student Mark
Etherton suggested that identifying effective
medical targets is easier said than done. He pre
dicted the research at Sudhof's lab would explain
only a fraction of the causes behind autism.
"Of that [gene] spectrum, a small percent
age of mutations have been found in [NLGN],"
Etherton pointed out. "There are a lot of muta
tions that are being identified in all sorts of
proteins in families with autism spectrum dis
orders."

Even if Sudhof is unable to correlate many
"candidate genes" to synaptic proteins, Boucard
is optimistic that the results will nonetheless be
enlightening.
Further study of synaptic development will
"reveal more targets, more ways of attacking the
system," Boucard predicted.
