## EDITORIAL Rest not on your laurels; take sustainability further 
### 
Recent news of Stanford's excellent re
port on its annual "Sustainability Re
port Card" barely registered a blip on
campus. At a University already overflowing
with accolades where sustainability comes up
around every corner, it seems such an award
was too predictable to garner much attention.
Thus, we write this editorial to highlight the
University's commendable efforts and urge
the student body to put its full force behind fu
ture initiatives.

on Nobel-prize winning committees, advise
the government, and even go on to become
Steven Chu. If we want Stanford to make the
world more sustainable, then it has to start
here. And not only do people expect this of us,
they count on it.
But what cannot be allowed to happen is
for such achievement to be taken for granted.
Recognizing our performance must serve as a
call to further action rather than an invitation
to rest on our laurels.
Sometimes, it seems as though the efforts to
promote environmental awareness actually
end up being too successful in getting the word
out. Like any other issue, overexposure can en
gender imperviousness. When students grow
tired of hearing the same things over and over,
they start to tune out. With sustainability, the
possibility hovers of its commonness, obscur
ing its urgency.
We raise this point not to discourage the
publicity of environmental issues, but rather to
reiterate that the issue is not a tired one and
that Stanford students must not let it fade into
background noise.
We trust that the University and the dedi
cated core of interested students will continue
to move forward with new and greater sustain
able initiatives. As much as has already been
accomplished, possibilities for new projects
abound. Photovoltaic arrays have begun to
scratch the surface of powering Stanford with
renewable energy. Students for a Sustainable
Stanford's plans to extend its reach into East
Palo Alto and the nonprofit organization,
IDEAS, spreading the efforts into developing
countries are just two examples of ways to ex
pand the impact.
Taking sustainability beyond Stanford,
however, starts by taking it across our popula
tion of students. This is not the type of issue that
can be addressed by delegating to a few devot
ed citizens. Everybody must take ownership of
environmental stewardship. When Stanford
students go out and lead businesses and gov
ernments, they must do so with a core commit
ment to sustainability. This University and its
passionate students have shown great leader
ship in tackling this issue, but it is not their
problem alone. Those leaders need followers.
And, yes, we know you've heard this mes
sage a lot. That's because it's important.

That Stanford has earned the distinction as
a national "sustainability leader" represents
tireless campus-wide efforts to cut down on ex
cess waste. The initiatives outlined in the report
card were innovative and impressive, if slightly
unpublicized. Through various programs,
Stanford has reduced greenhouse gas emis
sions from commuting to below 1990 levels
and decreased water usage by 15 percent in the
last eight years. Several buildings on campus
meet LEED certification requirements, in
cluding the new Graduate School of Business
complex. The Energy Conservation Incentive
Program, instituted in 2004, gives academics
cash payouts for reduced energy use and
makes them pay for going over an assigned
budget. With 18 full-time professionals em
ployed for sustainability purposes, the Univer
sity makes clear its dedication to incorporating
stewardship into its core mission.
The various student groups involved with
the issue have also been a driving force behind
the greening of the Cardinal red. Contributing
from different angles with focuses ranging
from awareness and outreach to technology
and engineering, Stanford offers something for
pretty much anybody interested in getting in
volved. Even if no existing organizations catch
your fancy, the Green Fund allows students to
run with their own original ideas. The depth
and breadth of student involvement is difficult
to overstate and impossible to ignore.
So, admittedly, all this action should make
the sustainability report card performance an
expectation. In fact, it is an expectation that ex
tends far beyond the boundaries of this cam
pus. People around the country and even
around the world look to Stanford to lead on
the environment. Our students develop clean
tech startups, organize to raise awareness, and
research new solutions. Our professors serve
