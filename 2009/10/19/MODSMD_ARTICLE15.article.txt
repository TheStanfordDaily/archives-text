# GIRL, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## Hamsun beats out Obama

Barack Obama, I'm Really Happy for You, and I'm Gonna Let
You Finish, but Knut Hamsun was the Worst Nobel Prize Win
ner of All Time

Everyone is abuzz over the Nobel Prize con
troversy in Oslo this past week. I speak of
course about Herta Muller's Nobel Prize for
Literature. Who is Herta Muller? I'll let Wikipedia
explain: "Prior to the award, Muller was little
known outside Germany, and even there she was
only known only among a minority of intellectuals
and literary critics."
Super. Not to be nationalistic about this, but the
same number of American-born authors have won
the Nobel Prize for literature in the last 40 years as
the resident number of St. Lucia, a country with a
smaller population than the burgeoning metropolis
that is Chattanooga, Tennessee.
There was an American who did win a Nobel
Prize, though he was born in Kenya. Snarky com
mentators have argued that an Arizona State hon
orary degree is now held to a higher standard than
a Nobel Prize (Jake Tapper), or that he won for ei
ther extraordinary diplomacy at the Gates-Crowley
beer summit, or being the 10th caller (David Bern
stein).
All aside, if you believe Mr. Obama is the least
deserving laureate of all time, well, in the presi
dent's words, "There are white folks, and then there
are ignorant motherfuckers like you." Let's take a
look at some of the worst winners:
Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, Economics,
1997.
Twelve years ago, Messrs. Merton and Scholes
(who is a professor of finance emeritus at Stanford)
were given the Nobel Prize "for a new method to
determine the value of derivatives." Considering
that the economy collapsed from overleveraging
and ill-advised derivative trading, we should proba
bly not have given these guys a Nobel Prize for hav
ing thought of it first. It does not seem these guys
knew better than their own terrible ideas as Long-
Term Capital Management, the hedge fund they co
founded exploded in 1998 after losing $4.6 billion in
four months.
Nassim Taleb, a scholar who cautioned against
the risks of overleveraging before the economic cri
sis, described Scholes' academic work enabling
widespread use of derivatives as "giving children
dynamite" and, in case his position was unclear,
added that "this guy should be in a retirement home
doing Sudoku." It should be noted, however, that
Alfred Nobel's principal achievement in life was
giving children dynamite, so maybe they deserve it.
Knut Hamsun, Literature, 1920.
A Norwegian, Mr. Hamsun won "for his monu
mental work, 'Growth of the Soil.'" I have not read
"Growth of the Soil," but here are two things I do
know about Knut Hamsun: He wore a monocle and

he loved him some Germany. In the 19405, Mr.
Hamsun vigorously supported the pro-Nazi gov
ernment of Vidkun Quisling (a man so treacherous
that "quisling" is defined in the dictionary as "a per
son who betrays his or her country by aiding an in
vading enemy").
This is all bad enough, but Mr. Hamsun crossed
any remaining lines of decency when he described
Adolf Hitler as a "warrior for mankind, and a
prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations " in an
obituary. And when he sent his Nobel Prize to Nazi
Minister of Propoganda Joseph Goebbels as an ex
pression of admiration.
Seriously, this guy actually mailed his Nobel
Prize to Joseph Goebbels. I promise you this hap
pened.
I understand that the Nobel Prize for Literature
is not supposed to be a political award, but is "Your
Nobel Prize is not to be used as a Nazi tchotchke"
really too high of a standard here?
Nelson Mandela, Peace, 1993.
0.K., fine, he deserved it at the time for spending
27 years in prison, all the while maintaining an in
credible dignity and faith in the righteousness of his
cause. Everyone knows of Mr. Mandela's heroic
struggles. You probably are less familiar with the
tale of Nelson Mandela, international seducer.
Shortly after his release from prison, Nelson
Mandela separated from (and later divorced) his
second wife. Mandela then remarried in 1998 to
Graca Machel, the widow of former Mozambican
President Samora Machel, who had died in a plane
crash 12 years prior.
Someone please explain to me how sleeping
with a country's first president's widow qualifies as
building fraternity between nations. How would we
have liked it if Martha Washington had shacked up
with George III? Even between allies, this is not ac
ceptable behavior. If Jacqueline Kennedy had run
off after President Kennedy's assassination with
British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, we probably
would have lost the Cold War. Not cool, Mandela,
not cool.
The Wellness Room is still open.
He absolutely said this. Google it.
