# THE 						DUDE ABIDES
## "You're not dealing with morons here." 
### Zack Warma 
Now now, I know all of you pro
foundly missed me, that a small
part of your being was left void last
Monday when you happened not to find
my ugly mug splashed across the Opin
ions page. Well, no need to go looking
elsewhere for your weekly dose of
schadenfreude, because the Dude is back,
y'all.
Perhaps it is merely my conveniently
constructed delusions about being a
schmucky upperclassman; however, I like
to think there are very few aspects of the
Stanford experience that I now find
shocking or truly unexpected. I have inad
vertently climbed rooftops at 4 a.m. and
watched the sun rise on the FloMo cat
walks while drinking brandy the morning
before a final. I have run a campus-wide
political operation, gone sailing around
the Bay with the illustrious Captain
Tomas, done an ignominious naked lap
around Bob (damn you Cap Group!), and
initiated blood feuds with a small but
healthy contingent of student leaders and
administrators. Needless to say, I feel like
I have a decent grasp on how things go
down at this palm-lined loony bin.
With that said, early each fall there is
an annual ritual still so foreign to me that
I cannot help but momentarily stand in
terrified awe before promptly fleeing to
my domicile. Ah, the venerable Career
Fair. As a freshman, the 'O7 fair was one of
the first instances I can recall where I felt
myself beginning to see the Stanford that
actually exists, as opposed to the carefree
first-year world constructed around
Wilbur Flail. The juniors and seniors in
their best Sunday wear handing in
leather-bound resumes to eager Fortune
500 companies there was a touch of ar
tificiality and surrealism to the whole af
fair that stuck with wide-eyed me. Fortu
nately enough, the tremendous level of
unease I felt was effectively mitigated by
the copious amount of free knick-knacks
I made off with (my Nalgene bottle is still
in great shape, actually).
Fast-forward two years. Sitting on the
third floor balcony of the Clubhouse, I
look out at an affair less monstrous than

previously recollected (HOORAY the
clobbered economy!), but still rife with
the identical flirtations of potential em
ployers (Visa, Anheiser Busch, Palo Alto
Fire???) and employees. Struck with an
impish desire to water balloon the hell
out of White Plaza, I correctly saunter
back to the Mitt.
To this day, I am still not sure why I
hold such an intense loathing of career
fairs. In large part, they symbolize the
strengths of the Stanford as an institution.
Since our founding at the hands of a man
who bribed his way into California state
government, the mission of this universi
ty has been to produce "cultured and use
ful" citizens (as a history major, I think
that qualifies me as neither). We have a
proven track record of churning out
hugely successful leaders of industry and
society, and that is something that we
should take pride in.
However, I cannot help but see career
fairs as largely the manifestation of a cor
poratist culture here at the Stan that de
emphasizes intellectual dynamism and

turns four years into simply a vodka
soaked rung on the social ladder. Now, I
have a couple extraordinarily close
friends who are shipping out to HBS and
Goldman next year, individuals whose in
tellects and worldliness I deeply admire.
So clearly I am not one who sees the top
rung of Stanford pre-professionals as in
tellectually deficient. Outside of some of
those in the upper strata, however, there
seems to exist a mentality that views Stan
ford primarily as a workshop for wealth
accumulation, an enjoyable means to a
Petron-sipping, Upper West Side end.
On a variety of levels, I personally find
such a viewpoint as profoundly disturb
ing. Fundamentally, I still believe in the
traditional values of the academy as a
center for personal development and
growth, the most open of all forums to dis
cuss and debate ideas and beliefs. When
the university is viewed as merely a train
ing ground for a job, then we as a society
have failed in properly articulating the
dire need for skills outside of simply mak
ing money. Maybe it stems from the fact I
am an embittered humanities major real
izing his only chance of ever being
wealthy hinges on the quixotic dream of a
seven-figure book deal. But I simply can
not abide by the absurdist notion that the
chief mission of a university is to give me
the connections to land me the internship
that lands me a job at some impersonal
monetary monstrosity.
Additionally, Stanford is just too damn
insane/wonderful to be looked on fore
most as a gold(man)en ticket to a pre-set,
seven-figure lifestyle. Stanford is not a
stepping stone, but rather a four-year
break from reality to have a bloody hoot,
meet some of the kookiest SOBS out
there, gain the skills necessary to be a suc
cessful individual, not just in the work
place, but out. Oh, and to drink brandy at
5 a.m. That too.

If you currently are in the possession of any
good brandy, or perhaps own a water bal
loon launcher you won't be using in 11
months, please do let Zack know at zwar
ma@stanford.edu.

To this day, I am still
not sure why I hold
such an intense
loathing of career
fairs.
