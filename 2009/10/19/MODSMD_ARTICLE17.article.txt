## OUTLASTED BY OREGON Volleyball goes one-and-one on the road 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball
team disappointingly split the weekend in
Oregon as they stormed Oregon State 3-1 (22-
25,25-21,25-23,25-19), but dropped a five-set
thriller to Oregon (23-25, 25-22, 32-30, 22-25,
11-15).
"I think our team went into this weekend
with a lot of confidence from coming off a big
win (last weekend)," said junior outside hitter
Alix Klineman. "[We were] definitely a little
more relaxed at practice during the week, and
while that can be a good thing in many ways, it
hurt us a little bit in the end."
The Card started off strong Friday night,
taking the early 8-3 lead in the first set. Kills
from junior Cassidy Lichtman, senior Janet
Okogbaa, and redshirt sophomore Stephanie
Browne maintained the Stanford lead at 12-8.
The Stanford offensive continued to force the
Beavers into bad habits, as they registered
four service errors and three attacking errors.
The accumulation helped the Cardinal get
comfortable with a 20-11 advantage.
OSU came back with a vengeance, though,
cutting it down to 21-17, and OSU junior Jill
Sawatzky hammered in a pair of kills, giving
the Beavers the momentum to finish off the
set, 22-25.
Feeding off their set win, the Beavers con
tinued to drill the Cardinal and took the 4-1
lead. But Okogbaa and Klineman combined
forces to help cut the second-set lead to 5-4.
With sights set on the lead. Cardinal redshirt
freshman Jessica Walker and Browne shut
down Oregon State's offensive with back-to
back blocks.
The Card then pulled away on a 5-0 run,
bringing the score to 15-10. Klineman's kills
and junior Gabi Ailes' ace kept the Stanford
lead up. A slight hiccup kept the Beavers in
the game, but Lichtman answered back to
win, 25-21.
The third set went back and forth, as the
score was knotted at 8,14 and 22 points. But
defense put the third set in the bag for the Car
dinal, as a double block from Walker and
Browne ended the set at 25-23.
Early in the fourth, Stanford took a lead
through much of the same Lichtman kills,
combined with Klineman and Walker solo
blocks left the Beavers trailing, 16-10. A small
Beavers run was not enough, as Klineman an
swered with her 20th kill of the night.The Card
took the fourth set, 25-19, and the match, 3-1.
"I think we are performing at a higher level
each week and if we can perform to our poten
tial, we are capable of beating anyone," Kline
man said.
But the tone changed the following day
versus Oregon.
After a quick 4-3 start by the Ducks, Stan
ford finally pulled ahead with 10-8. The teams

fought for the lead until the Ducks edged
Stanford out, 17-15. Errors made the Card un
able to recover, and Oregon took the first set,
25-23.

Stanford sought revenge in the second set
and pulled ahead early with kills by Lichtman
and Okogbaa. After Oregon tied it up, Kline
man registered two kills for the 11-9 lead.
Another Duck spree put Oregon ahead,
20-18. Klineman and Walker brought life back
into the offensive drive and helped Stanford
regain a 23-20 lead. Walker ended the set on a
block for the 25-22 set win.

"Our team fought with a lot of intensity and
perseverance and pulled out that game even
though the odds were against us," Klineman
said.

In the third set, the teams were tied at 13
when Oregon went on a run to pull ahead, 18-
14. Stanford's 5-1 run tied it up at 19, and the
back-and-forth tempo remained through the

score, 32-30.
An early 4-1 lead in the fourth,
though, was Stanford's only lead
of the set, and the Ducks managed
to punch out another close win,
25-22.

At two sets apiece, the Card start
ed slowly in the fifth, and was pushed
to a 7-2 deficit. Though the Ducks

committed multiple errors to put
Stanford within reach, Oregon fin
ished the set 15-11, and took the 3-2
victory.

"We played two good teams in
Oregon and Oregon State and when
it came down to it, we weren't as ur
gent as we needed to be," Klineman
said. "We are getting tougher and
tougher each week, but we need to
continue to get better at being that
way all the time, not just when the
match is on the line."

Klineman had 44 kills, 27 digs, and
three blocks on the weekend. She
also recorded her fifth double-dou

ble against Oregon State. Ailes
reached a season-high 32 digs
against Oregon State. Lichtman also
recorded her sixth triple-double with
17 kills, 17 digs and 17 assists versus
Oregon, and had 17 kills and 16 digs
versus Oregon State.

The Cardinal is now 5-2 in the Pa
cific-10 Conference, and 12-5 over

only two teams left to face in the first
half of conference play, come to

score, 32-30.
An early 4-1 lead in the fourth,
though, was Stanford's only lead
of the set, and the Ducks managed
to punch out another close win,
25-22.

At two sets apiece, the Card start
ed slowly in the fifth, and was pushed
to a 7-2 deficit. Though the Ducks

committed multiple errors to put
Stanford within reach, Oregon fin
ished the set 15-11, and took the 3-2
victory.

"We played two good teams in
Oregon and Oregon State and when
it came down to it, we weren't as ur
gent as we needed to be," Klineman
said. "We are getting tougher and
tougher each week, but we need to
continue to get better at being that
way all the time, not just when the
match is on the line."

Klineman had 44 kills, 27 digs, and
three blocks on the weekend. She
also recorded her fifth double-dou

reached a season-high 32 digs
against Oregon State. Lichtman also
recorded her sixth triple-double with
17 kills, 17 digs and 17 assists versus
Oregon, and had 17 kills and 16 digs
versus Oregon State.

The No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball
team disappointingly split the weekend in
Oregon as they stormed Oregon State 3-1 (22-
25,25-21,25-23,25-19), but dropped a five-set
thriller to Oregon (23-25, 25-22, 32-30, 22-25,
11-15).
"I think our team went into this weekend
with a lot of confidence from coming off a big
win (last weekend)," said junior outside hitter
Alix Klineman. "[We were] definitely a little
more relaxed at practice during the week, and
while that can be a good thing in many ways, it
hurt us a little bit in the end."
The Card started off strong Friday night,
taking the early 8-3 lead in the first set. Kills
from junior Cassidy Lichtman, senior Janet
Okogbaa, and redshirt sophomore Stephanie
Browne maintained the Stanford lead at 12-8.
The Stanford offensive continued to force the
Beavers into bad habits, as they registered
four service errors and three attacking errors.
The accumulation helped the Cardinal get
comfortable with a 20-11 advantage.
OSU came back with a vengeance, though,
cutting it down to 21-17, and OSU junior Jill
Sawatzky hammered in a pair of kills, giving
the Beavers the momentum to finish off the
set, 22-25.
Feeding off their set win, the Beavers con
tinued to drill the Cardinal and took the 4-1
lead. But Okogbaa and Klineman combined
forces to help cut the second-set lead to 5-4.
With sights set on the lead. Cardinal redshirt
freshman Jessica Walker and Browne shut
down Oregon State's offensive with back-to
back blocks.
The Card then pulled away on a 5-0 run,
bringing the score to 15-10. Klineman's kills
and junior Gabi Ailes' ace kept the Stanford
lead up. A slight hiccup kept the Beavers in
the game, but Lichtman answered back to
win, 25-21.
The third set went back and forth, as the
score was knotted at 8,14 and 22 points. But
defense put the third set in the bag for the Car
dinal, as a double block from Walker and
Browne ended the set at 25-23.
Early in the fourth, Stanford took a lead
through much of the same Lichtman kills,
combined with Klineman and Walker solo
blocks left the Beavers trailing, 16-10. A small
Beavers run was not enough, as Klineman an
swered with her 20th kill of the night.The Card
took the fourth set, 25-19, and the match, 3-1.
"I think we are performing at a higher level
each week and if we can perform to our poten
tial, we are capable of beating anyone," Kline
man said.
But the tone changed the following day
versus Oregon.
After a quick 4-3 start by the Ducks, Stan
ford finally pulled ahead with 10-8. The teams

fought for the lead until the Ducks edged
Stanford out, 17-15. Errors made the Card un
able to recover, and Oregon took the first set,
25-23.

Stanford sought revenge in the second set
and pulled ahead early with kills by Lichtman
and Okogbaa. After Oregon tied it up, Kline
man registered two kills for the 11-9 lead.
Another Duck spree put Oregon ahead,
20-18. Klineman and Walker brought life back
into the offensive drive and helped Stanford
regain a 23-20 lead. Walker ended the set on a
block for the 25-22 set win.

"Our team fought with a lot of intensity and
perseverance and pulled out that game even
though the odds were against us," Klineman
said.

In the third set, the teams were tied at 13
when Oregon went on a run to pull ahead, 18-
14. Stanford's 5-1 run tied it up at 19, and the
back-and-forth tempo remained through the
