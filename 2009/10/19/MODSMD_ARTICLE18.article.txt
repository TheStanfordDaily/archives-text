# Breaking even in Pac-10 play
## After overtime win in San Diego, Card drops to UCLA 
### WILL SEATON 
The Stanford men's soccer team (2-2-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) experienced a little bit of
everything this weekend, winning 2-1 in over
time against San Diego State (0-2-2 Pac-10),
and then getting shut out, 2-0, by UCLA (3-0-2
Pac-10) on Sunday.
Stanford dominated play in the first half of
its Friday night game against the Aztecs, but
San Diego State managed to hold the Cardinal
scoreless through halftime.
Stanford junior midfielder Dominique
Yahyavi broke free early to direct a shot toward
the net, but sophomore midfielder Clayton
Holz failed to capitalize on an Aztec defensive
mistake and San Diego keeper Brad Byrns
stepped up for the save.
The Aztecs gained a 1-0 lead early in the sec
ond half when redshirt senior captain Matt Mc-
Manus scored his first goal of the season six
minutes in. The goal came off a corner kick
from senior Daniel Ortega, with McManus fin
ishing into the right corner for his seventh ca
reer goal.
"If you know the players on San Diego
State, you know they have some terrific play
ers," said Stanford Head Coach Bret Simon.
"They are within a hair of sitting in second place
themselves right now."
The Cardinal was feeling desperation
creep in until sophomore Garrett Gunther
tied the game with just three minutes left. In
nearly identical fashion to the Aztecs, Gun
ther finished a perfect cross from Yahyavi,
heading it into the right corner. The goal itself
was a long time coming, as Stanford out-shot
San Diego State 7-2 in the second half, and 13-
9 overall. With it, Yahyavi matched redshirt
senior Evan Morgan's team-leading three as

sists this season.
Simon said he had few worries about his
team's success as the clock ran down.
"The one thing I do know is that our guys
will always give their best," he said. "They're
good players and will create chances. We'll have
our opportunities to get back in the game."
With the game tied at 1-1, the game went to
overtime but not for long. Just 1 minutes, 38
seconds into overtime, San Diego State was

whistled for a foul from 24 yards out. Stanford
junior Ryan Thomas stepped up and sent the
ball over the Aztec wall into the top left corner
for the golden goal. The loss marked San Diego
State's fourth consecutive overtime match, and
leaves the Aztecs without a win in Pac-10 play.
After squeezing out the close 2-1 win, the
Cardinal was rewarded with important mo
mentum going into its game against UCLA on
Sunday.

Unfortunately, that momentum wasn't
enough to help Stanford score against a domi
nant Bruin team. UCLA rode its eight-game
unbeaten streak to a 2-0 win on Sunday, posting
its second consecutive shutout over Stanford.
"We made mistakes and they capitalized,"
Simon said. "We have to give them credit, but
the game was very even. Sometimes it is just the
way it goes."
The game proved to be all about the de
fense, as the two teams combined for just four
shots in the first half. UCLA, however, knew
how to finish. Bruin freshman Chandler Hoff
man scored first at the 32-minute mark off a
pass by Michael Stephens that came short in
side the box and was put away past Stanford
goalkeeper John Moore. Stanford, mean
while, had only one shot on goal during the
first half.
The second half proved to be more open, but
both teams' defenses still played a dominating
role the offensive difference came in corner
kicks. The Bruins managed to take six corners
to Stanford's one, and UCLA's second goal
came from a corner at the 75-minute mark.
Stephens set up the goal, sending the ball into
the box, where senior Sean Alvarado headed it
into the goal for his second score of the season.
Halfway through the Pac-10 season, UCLA
has started to distance itself from the crowd.
The Bruins sit in first place with 11 points. Stan
ford holds a precarious second-place position
with seven points, but the remainder of the Pac
-10 is within a few points.
"We haven't distanced ourselves quite yet,"
Simon said. "Everyone is still within the race to
be in the top two or three in the conference.
Every game in our conference is going to be a
tough game, and right now I have to think the
return back home is going to be a good thing."
Stanford gets a chance at revenge against
UCLA at home next week, as well as a rematch
against San Diego State. The Cardinal takes on
the Aztecs on Friday at 7 p.m., and the Bruins
on Sunday at 1 p.m.
