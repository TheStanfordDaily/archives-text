# Too much hype for Harbaugh
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
For the past three years, we
sportswriters have had noth
ing but praise for Jim Har
baugh.
Who could blame us? After suf
fering through five years of Buddy
Teevens and Walt Harris, Harbaugh
has been extremely refreshing.
We've complimented his energy,
his enthusiasm, his recruiting, and
even his game management.
Today, however, it's time for Har
baugh to face some music.
Stanford lost at Arizona on Satur
day for two reasons. The first is the
defense, which was, for the second
consecutive week, downright horri
ble, Instead of attacking, Cardinal
defenders were repeatedly caught on
their heels trying to stop the Wild
cats' short passing attack.
As a student and a fan, I can live
with losing because the defense was
overmatched. I can't live with the
second reason that the Cardinal lost
yesterday: Harbaugh's ego.
For too long, we have showered
Harbaugh's ego.
We've applauded the grandiose
comments he makes about working
harder than any team ever, his ridicu
lous twitter account and his attacking
style as a coach.
That is all well and good, but as we
saw Saturday, no ego should go
unchecked.
There were two instances in the
game Saturday that showed Har
baugh had an irresponsible amount
of confidence.
The first occurred with about five
and half minutes left in the game and
Stanford leading 38-36 with the ball
on the Arizona 8-yard line. It was
fourth down and about a yard and a
half. Harbaugh chose to go for it by
throwing a quick pass to Chris
Owusu on the left, which was
dropped, and the Cardinal turned
the ball over on downs.
I'll begin expressing my displeas
ure with this decision by stating the
obvious. When you have the lead,
you add to the lead especially on
the road â€”period. It's one of the
most basic coaching fundamentals.
You kick the field goal, extend the
lead and even if Arizona scores a
touchdown (which they did), another
field goal keeps you in the game (see
later).
Sure, kicker Nate Whitaker
missed a 36-yard field goal earlier in
the quarter. But he has been solid all
season, and I seriously doubt Har
baugh expected him to miss a 25-
yard chip shot.
Instead, the former quarterback
in Harbaugh came out deciding to
pass the ball on fourth down and
short, despite being one of the best
running teams in the nation.
Admittedly, the nation's leading
rusher, Toby Gerhart, had limped off
and probably couldn't have carried
the ball on that play. That should
have been an indication to Har
baugh, however, to kick the field
goal; instead, he tried to throw a pass
from a freshman quarterback to a
sophomore wide receiver. Interest
ing.
Not surprisingly, Arizona now
had all the momentum in the world,
and took the lead on its subsequent
drive. Luckily for the Cardinal
who now needed a touchdown, in
stead of a field goal to win the game
(see above for reason why) there
were still nearly three minutes left in
the game and Arizona kicked the
kickoff out-of-bounds, giving Stan
ford the ball at the 40-yard line.
Wait, what? Jim Harbaugh de
clined the penalty on the kick out-of
bounds?
This was one of these decisions
that as soon as it was made, everyone
and their mothers knew it was going
to bite the team in the you-know
what.
So Arizona re-kicked and instead
of getting the ball on the 40, Owusu
returned the kick to the 22. Har
baugh's overconfidence in his kick
return team cost Stanford 18 yards
(more on that to come).
With just over a minute to play,
Andrew Luck completed a 36-yard
pass to Doug Baldwin to the Arizona
17-yardline.
Most of you are Stanford stu
dents, so you know where I'm going
