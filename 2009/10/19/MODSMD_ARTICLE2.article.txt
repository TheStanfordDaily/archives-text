# OFF-CAMPUS
## Detained scientist had SLAC ties He spent six months at SLAC, was not employed 
### LAURA STAMPLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A physicist with ties to Stanford was
arrested in Vienne, France on Oct. 8 after
police intercepted encoded e-mails
allegedly sent to a terrorist organization in
Algeria.
Judge Christophe Teissier ordered the
French internal security service, DCRI, to
investigate Algerian national Dr. Adlene
Flicheur, 32, for "association with crimi
nals in relation with a terrorist enterprise."
The organization in question is "al-
Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb," affiliated
with al-Qaeda International.
Hicheur came to Stanford for six
months in the summer of 2002, the last
time he is believed to have visited campus,
to do research for his Ph.D. at SLAC
National Accelerator Laboratory. At the
time, Hicheur was as an employee of
Laboratoire d'Annecy-le-Vieux des
Particules (LAPP) at the University of
Savoie in France.
SLAC has moved to counter the level
of association between Hicheur and
Stanford in the reports of many media
organizations, saying these reports often
"got it wrong."
"Hicheur was never employed by
SLAC, nor by Stanford, nor was he a stu
dent at Stanford, nor did he receive his
Ph.D. from Stanford," said Robert Brown,
director of communications for SLAC, in
an e-mail to The Daily.
While at Stanford, Hicheur collaborat
ed on the Baßar experiment, which stud
ies the decay of particles known as "B"
mesons in pursuit of understanding the
dominance of matter over anti-matter
(recently coined the "God particle" and at
the crux of the plot of Dan Brown's
"Angels and Demons.")
Brown said that Hicheur's work at
SLAC in no way involves work applicable
to terrorist actions.
"Hicheur's work at SLAC did not
bring him into contact with tools, materi
als or information that could be used for
terrorism, because SLAC research does
not involve nuclear, biological or other
technologies with military applications,"
Brown said. "The lab conducts basic
research, and all our results are peer
reviewed and published openly in the sci
entific community."
In keeping with this, no projects at
SLAC require a security clearance,
although visitors and employees from four
"terrorist-sponsoring countries" Cuba,
Iran, Sudan and Syria must be cleared
by the Department of Energy, according
to SLAC'sWeb site.
According to employees who work on
the Baßar experiment, Hicheur's relation
ship with the program was a standard one.
"The Baßar collaboration is an inter
national collaboration of over 500 physi
cists from approximately 70 institutions in
about a dozen countries," said Physics
Chair Patricia Burchat. "All collaborators
are included as authors on all papers.
Many collaborators spend only a fraction
of their time at SLAC since all collabora
tors can access the electronic physics data
from their home institution."
Baßar-related research is often pub
lished with a high number of co-authors.
Burchat is one of many researchers who
have co-published with Hicheur in that
manner; however, even though their
research and time at Stanford over
lapped, the two never met or came into
direct contact with one another.
After his time at Stanford, Hicheur
conducted research at the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory in the United
Kingdom (UK). Up until his arrest he also
worked with the Large Hadron Collider, a
project that causes high-speed proton col
lisions in the hopes of recreating the Big
Bang. Through this work he was associat
ed with the European Organization for
Nuclear Research (CERN), a premier
European particle physics laboratory near
Geneva, Switzerland.
According to a statement made
by CERN on Oct. 12, the laboratory
does not do research in fields of
nuclear power or nuclear weaponry
and does not possess materials that
could be used for terrorist means.
Hicheur has acknowledged con
tacting the terrorist organization,
but his family denies his connection
to terrorists and believes he was just
writing to family in Algeria, accord
ing to the UK's Times.
"Adlene is a good guy, he is bril
liant, he is so shy, so far from vio
lence but at the same time, he is of
Algerian origin, educated, Muslim,"
said Adlene Hicheur's brother
Halim Hicheur, a post-doctoral
researcher of physiology and biome
chanics at College de France, in an e
mail to The Daily. "And these last
reasons have been unfortunately, in
France, the sources of hundreds of
[arrests] of innocent people."
French law allows for a person to
be held under "provisional deten
tion" for a indefinite period of time
if suspected of terrorist actions.
Halim Hicheur believes that the
media has misrepresented his broth
er's case and that his family intends
to "prosecute the journals [that "sen
sationalist" reporters] are working
for, from the beginning of this affair,
in clear violation of the law."
"We personally experienced how
many lies, sensational but complete
ly false scenarios have been written
about this story," he added.
