# Lieberman talks terror
## In Pearl lecture, senator urges look back to Cold War; audience gives mixed reviews 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) spoke at
the Fourth Annual Daniel Pearl Memorial
Lecture last night on the topic "The End of
the War on Terror."
Daniel Pearl was a 1985 Stanford alum
nus and Wall Street Journal journalist
whose 2002 death at the hands of al-Qaeda
terrorists in Pakistan sent shock waves
across the globe.
Sunday, the fourth-term senator
described a society governed by Islamic
extremists as "a society, in other words, in
which everyone is to be terrorized into con
formity as it is defined by a deranged
minority . . . This is the world view that
caused the murder of Daniel Pearl."
Lieberman centered his speech around
the present threat of Islamic extremism, his

personal experiences visiting Middle East
countries plagued by extremist factions,
and ways in which the global community
could go about eradicating this threat.
He emphasized the importance of
squarely facing the ideology championed
by al-Qaeda.
"Part of the perversity of evil is that the
greater its depravity, the greater is our nat
ural human temptation to avert our eyes
from it, to look away and convince our
selves that we cannot possibly be seeing
what we are seeing," Lieberman said.
"Indeed, that is one of the reasons that such
evil persists."
Rejecting the idea of the "war on terror"
as a war of civilizations, Lieberman pre
ferred to describe it as a civil war within
Islam. He also claimed that the idea that
the U.S. and the West are at war with Islam
is simply a lie marketed by extremists.

"More Muslims have been murdered by
Islamic suicide bombers than have mem
bers of any other faith precisely because
the ultimate aim of these Islamist extrem
ists has been to destabilize and seize con
trol of the Muslim-majority countries of the
greater Middle East and South Asia,"
Lieberman said.
Lieberman also spoke optimistically
about the end of Islamic extremism.
"This war will end when a critical mass
of people recognize that the ideology of our
enemy is capable of creating nothing but
hell on earth," Lieberman said. "It will not

end when every conflict and injustice is
solved, but when the world view of Islamic
extremism is discredited, discarded and
even reviled."
Lieberman pointed to the decline of
communism as an instructive precedent in
moving forward.
"There was a time not so long ago when
countless people across the world were
intrigued by the promise of communism,"
Lieberman said. "It was an ideology that
provoked popular uprising, wars and coups,
