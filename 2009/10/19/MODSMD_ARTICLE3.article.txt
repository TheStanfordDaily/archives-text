# Lieberman talks terror
## In Pearl lecture, senator urges look back to Cold War; audience gives mixed reviews 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) spoke at
the Fourth Annual Daniel Pearl Memorial
Lecture last night on the topic "The End of
the War on Terror."
Daniel Pearl was a 1985 Stanford alum
nus and Wall Street Journal journalist
whose 2002 death at the hands of al-Qaeda
terrorists in Pakistan sent shock waves
across the globe.
Sunday, the fourth-term senator
described a society governed by Islamic
extremists as "a society, in other words, in
which everyone is to be terrorized into con
formity as it is defined by a deranged
minority . . . This is the world view that
caused the murder of Daniel Pearl."
Lieberman centered his speech around
the present threat of Islamic extremism, his

personal experiences visiting Middle East
countries plagued by extremist factions,
and ways in which the global community
could go about eradicating this threat.
He emphasized the importance of
squarely facing the ideology championed
by al-Qaeda.
"Part of the perversity of evil is that the
greater its depravity, the greater is our nat
ural human temptation to avert our eyes
from it, to look away and convince our
selves that we cannot possibly be seeing
what we are seeing," Lieberman said.
"Indeed, that is one of the reasons that such
evil persists."
Rejecting the idea of the "war on terror"
as a war of civilizations, Lieberman pre
ferred to describe it as a civil war within
Islam. He also claimed that the idea that
the U.S. and the West are at war with Islam
is simply a lie marketed by extremists.

"More Muslims have been murdered by
Islamic suicide bombers than have mem
bers of any other faith precisely because
the ultimate aim of these Islamist extrem
ists has been to destabilize and seize con
trol of the Muslim-majority countries of the
greater Middle East and South Asia,"
Lieberman said.
Lieberman also spoke optimistically
about the end of Islamic extremism.
"This war will end when a critical mass
of people recognize that the ideology of our
enemy is capable of creating nothing but
hell on earth," Lieberman said. "It will not

end when every conflict and injustice is
solved, but when the world view of Islamic
extremism is discredited, discarded and
even reviled."
Lieberman pointed to the decline of
communism as an instructive precedent in
moving forward.
"There was a time not so long ago when
countless people across the world were
intrigued by the promise of communism,"
Lieberman said. "It was an ideology that
provoked popular uprising, wars and coups,

and quite literally divided humani
ty in half, and that spread contin
ued even after its center became so
clearly a brutal totalitarian leader
ship.
"It is because of a global con
sensus that eventually formed that
the underlying premise of commu
nism was false," Lieberman added.
"And that it had repeatedly and
grotesquely failed to live up to its
own promises. As a result, people
simply stopped believing in the
ideology, including to this day the

leaders of countries that still hold
themselves Communists, such as
the People's Republic of China
and Vietnam."
Just as Communism was once
thought to be an undefeatable
force that eventually fell apart,
Lieberman said Islamic extremism,
too, will "collapse under the weight
of its own evil."
However, during the question
and answer session of the event, an
audience member questioned that
assertion, saying communism is and
was mainly an economic and politi
cal ideology while Islamic extrem
ism has a more theological origin.
Countering, Lieberman said that
despite the ideological differences
between the two, "the point I'm try

ing to make tonight is that... ulti
mately, communism became less of
an ideology and more of a totalitar
ian dictatorship, and that's exactly
what Islamic extremism has already
shown itself essentially to be."
Supporting his optimistic view
that Islamic extremists will eventu
ally end, Lieberman earlier in the
speech cited a number of statistics
and recounted a trip he took to the
Anbar province in western Iraq.
"After the overthrow of
Saddam Hussein, Anbar became
the epicenter of the Sunni Arab
insurgency and al-Qaeda.
However, eventually the local
Sunni population turned against al-
Qaeda with their totalitarian rule,"
Lieberman said.

Lieberman cited the Sunni
insurgents' switching sides to fight
alongside a largely non-Muslim
American military, against their
fellow Sunni Arabs, as a sign that
local Muslims who have had to live
under the barbarism and brutality
of al-Qaeda extremists eventually
do turn against them.
Sunday's audience, which
included students, alumni, Palo
Alto residents and a wide variety
of Stanford employees, appeared
to have a positive response to the
speech the audience clapped
off-the-cuff a number of times dur
ing the lecture.
"I thought it was a very inform
ative and balanced speech, that his
views were spot-on with what

needs to be done domestically and
internationally to combat terror
ism, and it's unfortunate that he
was not elected vice president,"
said Daniel Zahi, a resident at the
Stanford Hospital & Clinics.
Still, fitting to the controversial
nature of the topic, a number of
attendees also found the speech
unsatisfactory.
"I thought the speech was
poor," said Josh Pincus, a Palo Alto
resident. "I don't believe the
speech reflected his true views on
the matter ... he attempted to try
to be politically correct rather than
rile up people."
