## South Asian students celebrate 'Festival of Lights' 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
The Old Union courtyard was awash in
saris, food, candlelight and music Sunday night
as hundreds of students celebrated the Hindu
holiday of Diwali.
This year, four of Stanford's most promi
nent South Asian organizations the Hindu
Student Council, Sanskriti, the Stanford India
Association and the dance team Basmati Raas
pooled their efforts and funds to host the

Diwali festival.
Diwali, or "The Festival of Lights," is a
major Hindu festival celebrated across India
and Nepal that marks the return of Rama to
his homeland after his 14-year exile and defeat
of Ravana. According to legend, the citizens of
Ayodhya, the capital of Rama's kingdom, cel
ebrated their king's return by lighting rows of
lamps.

In India today, people light "diyas," or clay
pots, signifying the triumph of one's struggle
between good and evil. Diwali is celebrated on

the first day of the lunar Kartika month. This
year it falls on Saturday, Oct. 17.
About 600 students danced, ate and min
gled in the candlelit courtyard here as they cel
ebrated the holiday.
Beginning with the religious component,
called the Diwali Puja, in the Sanctuary Room
of Old Union, the night continued with a free
Indian dinner and sweets in the Old Union
courtyard, and culminated with the
Garba/Dandiya Party co-hosted by the
Basmati Raas team.

"Diwali is the Indian equivalent of
Christmas and New Year's," said Sheel Tyle
'l2, co-president of the Hindu Student
Association. "Schools are off, there are fire
works and it's a huge party."
Muthu Alagappan 'l2, vice president of the
Hindu Student Council and member of the
Basmati Raas dance team, was in charge of
organizing the Diwali Puja, the religious ritual
that honors the Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of
wealth and prosperity, and Lord
Ganesh, the god of knowledge and
the remover of obstacles.
Alagappan said turnout to the
Puja was down from last year, but
expected more people to attend the
Garba, the party and dance portion
of the festival, because Sanskriti a
non-religiously-affiliated undergrad
uate organization was focusing
more on the cultural aspect of the
holiday.
"This is one of the biggest holi
days in India the equivalent of
Christmas here," Alagappan said.
"I've never been to Diwali in India,
but I've heard it's pretty amazing."
Miriam Ellora Marks 'll, co-pres
ident of Sanskriti, said the group's
involvement made this year's Diwali
more of an undergraduate event.
Kamal Aggarwal, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering who
hails from northern India, about 100
miles from New Delhi, experienced
Diwali in India and said Stanford
made an effort to capture the same
feel of authenticity.
"We try to make it as authentic as
possible," Aggarwal said. "There has
been great support for Diwali."
Tyle added that the number of
participating groups contributed to
Sunday night's success: "That sort of
collaboration is great."
