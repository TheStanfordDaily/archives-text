## Stanford takes sole possession of Pac-10 with wins over USC and UCLA 
### NATE ADAMS SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITORS 
It may be true that all good things must come to an
end. But judging from yet another sweep this weekend,
the Cardinal women aren't letting that end come any
time soon. Stanford, facing perhaps the toughest pair of
opponents of the regular season, continued its unde
feated season with a pair of shutout victories over con
ference rivals USC and UCLA.

Stanford opened the homes
tand Friday night with a 4-0 win
over No. 15 USC (11-4,3-1 Pac
-10), who was coming off a nine
game winning streak of its own.
The Trojans were able to hold
No. 1 Stanford scoreless in the
first half, despite being out-shot
19-3.

The first great chance for
Stanford (15-0-0, 4-0-0) fell to
freshman center back Alina
Garciamendez in the ninth
minute. Garciamendez got a
good header off of a corner
kick, only to see USC senior
keeper Kristin Olsen make the
save. The Cardinal continued to

GAME NOTES: No. 1 Stanford earned its top rank
again this weekend, taking out No. 15 USC and
No. 3 UCLA, 4-0 and 2-0, respectively. No. 24
Washington State would love to end the Cardinal's
undefeated streak, and will have a better shot with
a home field advantage. But Stanford enters the
game with momentum and confidence, and will be
hard-pressed to give up their solo spot atop confer

ELIZABETH CLAIR/The Stanford Daily
Christen Press had a team-leading 10 shots and
two goals in Friday's 4-0 win against USC. The
junior added five more shots against UCLA, but
had an early goal called back for offsides.
make Olsen work hard throughout
the first half, forcing save after save,
and, by the end of the period, Olsen
had recorded seven. While USC had
a few looks at goal, Stanford junior
keeper Kira Maker was not called
into action to make a stop.
The game went into halftime 0-0,
but as has been the case throughout
the year, the Cardinal opened up the
floodgates in the second half. Stan
ford Head Coach Paul Ratcliffe was
pleased with his team's persistence
on offense.

"We really just were slowly
breaking the other team down, so
we had the chances all along and
their goalie came up big," he reflect
ed. "Once we had one goal, it boost
ed our confidence and really
opened things up, so you just have
to break the ice, and we were able to
do that."

In the 53rd minute, senior for
ward Kelley O'Hara found space on
the left and blasted a low shot to
ward goal. Once again, Olsen made
the save, but this time spilled her re
bound. Junior forward Christen
Press who had been the focal
point of the Stanford attack all
game was there to tap it home
and give the Card the lead.
"We'd been taking long-range
shots for a long time, and that was
just a great shot by Kelley," Press
said of her scoring opportunity. "I
just happened to be there for the re
bound. It's slippery out there, so
there was a good chance for a re
bound and I was able to take advan
tage."

The Cardinal doubled its lead
just two minutes later. Sophomore
Lindsay Taylor pushed past a de
fender on the right and centered a
ball through the box. The cross made
it past the opposite post, where
O'Hara was waiting to slot it in.
The two quick goals seemed to
demoralize the Trojans, and within
15 minutes, the game was safely out
of reach. O'Hara notched a second
goal in the 63rd minute, this time
seeing her shot deflect in off a USC
defender.

Five minutes later, Press made a
drive from the midfield and un
leashed a blast of her own from out
side the box this time, Olsen

could not keep it out. With the
score, the junior matched her team
mate and finished off the game's
scoring, ending it 4-0.
Fresh off the dominating victory,
the Cardinal nearly got off to a
dream start against No. 3 UCLA
(12-2-1, 3-1) on Sunday 12 min
utes in, freshman midfielder Mariah
Nogueira flicked on a ball that
O'Hara ran onto on the right. The
senior then found a wide-open
Press, who put the ball in the back of
the net, but was judged offside by
the referee's assistant.

O'Hara and Press both got close
again before the half was over, but
the best opportunity for either side
came from UCLA senior Lauren
Cheney, who curled a shot just over
the crossbar in the 35th minute. The
game remained scoreless going into
halftime, and although Stanford was
out-shooting the Bruins 11-4, nei
ther team looked dominant over the
other.

The intensity picked up in the
second half, as both teams were de
termined not to let up the all-impor
tant opening goal. With both de
fenses looking airtight, it began to
look like only a moment of bril
liance or luck would break the dead
lock.

The Bruins nearly broke the
stalemate in the 22nd minute, when
Cheney swung in a cross from the
left. However, no one got a touch on
it, and the ball continued to curve to
ward goal. Although Maker was
beaten, the ball caromed off the post.
Just a few minutes later, luck
went Stanford's way. Press had a
shot blocked at the top of the box,
but the ball took a bounce off anoth
er Bruin defender, and UCLA red
shirt sophomore keeper Chante
Sandiford was helpless as the ball
looped over her and into the net for
an own goal.
Ratcliffe was happy to have a
goal on the scoreboard, regardless
of how it went in.
"You need a little bit of luck in
soccer," he said. "I think we really
put them under pressure, so unfortu
nately for them they kicked into
their own goal. But we made that
luck, I think we made that luck,
and in the past it's gone their way, so
tonight we broke the ice and it
worked out for us."

As in the USC match, the second
goal came right on the heels of the
first. Senior left back Ali Riley cut
inside from the left flank and deliv

ered a perfect cross to sophomore
Cami Levin, who was playing up
front instead of in her usual midfield
role. Levin finished like a true strik
er, nodding the ball down past San
diford to make it 2-0. Riley was im
pressed with Levin's effort at for
ward, giving her credit for the score.
"I just remember crossing it and
seeing Cami open," the senior de
fender said. "It was nice having her
at forward, and it was a great head
er. She worked hard to get up there,
so I just passed it to her and she was
able to put it in."
Ratcliff e, with a very deeppoolof
talent to draw on, has been able to
mix and match players across the
field this season. He was happy with
how the Cardinal's substitutions
worked out on Sunday, particularly
playing Levin at forward.
"Cami's a winner, and you want
her on the field," he said. "I was try
ing to see where we needed some
body and we'd done it in training,
and my assistant coaches and I
thought she'd be a good fit there
today."

UCLA did not give up after sud
denly finding itself down 2-0, and
the Bruins poured forward in num
bers. Right after Levin's goal,
UCLA freshman Sophie Metz
forced Maker into a diving save.
With 12 minutes remaining, Cheney
saw her free kick hit the underside
of the crossbar, only to bounce down
in front of the goal line. Sophomore
teammate Sydney Leroux's follow
up header was high.
Recognizing his opponents'
tenacity, Ratcliffe kept his team on
its toes to the very end of the 2-0
win.

"I've been coaching long enough
that I know there's never a game in
the bag," he said. "You always need
to play well until the last whistle, and
I was pleased with how we kept
working. It was a good result."
The weekend sweep continues a
best-ever start for the Cardinal,
which now holds a perfect record
with just five games remaining in the
regular season. Stanford continues
Pacific-10 Conference play next
weekend on the road, facing off
against the Washington State
Cougars on Friday at 3 p.m. and the
Washington Huskies at noon on
Sunday.

(12-2-1, 3-1) on Sunday 12 min
utes in, freshman midfielder Mariah
Nogueira flicked on a ball that
O'Hara ran onto on the right. The
senior then found a wide-open
Press, who put the ball in the back of
the net, but was judged offside by
the referee's assistant.

O'Hara and Press both got close
again before the half was over, but
the best opportunity for either side
came from UCLA senior Lauren
Cheney, who curled a shot just over
the crossbar in the 35th minute. The
game remained scoreless going into
halftime, and although Stanford was
out-shooting the Bruins 11-4, nei
ther team looked dominant over the
other.

The intensity picked up in the
second half, as both teams were de
termined not to let up the all-impor
tant opening goal. With both de
fenses looking airtight, it began to
look like only a moment of bril
liance or luck would break the dead
lock.

The Bruins nearly broke the
stalemate in the 22nd minute, when
Cheney swung in a cross from the
left. However, no one got a touch on
it, and the ball continued to curve to
ward goal. Although Maker was
beaten, the ball caromed off the post.
Just a few minutes later, luck
went Stanford's way. Press had a
shot blocked at the top of the box,
but the ball took a bounce off anoth
er Bruin defender, and UCLA red
shirt sophomore keeper Chante
Sandiford was helpless as the ball
looped over her and into the net for
an own goal.
Ratcliffe was happy to have a
goal on the scoreboard, regardless
of how it went in.
"You need a little bit of luck in
soccer," he said. "I think we really
put them under pressure, so unfortu
nately for them they kicked into
their own goal. But we made that
luck, I think we made that luck,
and in the past it's gone their way, so
tonight we broke the ice and it
worked out for us."

As in the USC match, the second
goal came right on the heels of the
first. Senior left back Ali Riley cut
inside from the left flank and deliv

ered a perfect cross to sophomore
Cami Levin, who was playing up
front instead of in her usual midfield
role. Levin finished like a true strik
er, nodding the ball down past San
diford to make it 2-0. Riley was im
pressed with Levin's effort at for
ward, giving her credit for the score.
"I just remember crossing it and
seeing Cami open," the senior de
fender said. "It was nice having her
at forward, and it was a great head
er. She worked hard to get up there,
so I just passed it to her and she was
able to put it in."
Ratcliff e, with a very deeppoolof
talent to draw on, has been able to
mix and match players across the
field this season. He was happy with
how the Cardinal's substitutions
worked out on Sunday, particularly
playing Levin at forward.
"Cami's a winner, and you want
her on the field," he said. "I was try
ing to see where we needed some
body and we'd done it in training,
and my assistant coaches and I
thought she'd be a good fit there
today."

UCLA did not give up after sud
denly finding itself down 2-0, and
the Bruins poured forward in num
bers. Right after Levin's goal,
UCLA freshman Sophie Metz
forced Maker into a diving save.
With 12 minutes remaining, Cheney
saw her free kick hit the underside
of the crossbar, only to bounce down
in front of the goal line. Sophomore
teammate Sydney Leroux's follow
up header was high.
Recognizing his opponents'
tenacity, Ratcliffe kept his team on
its toes to the very end of the 2-0
win.

"I've been coaching long enough
that I know there's never a game in
the bag," he said. "You always need
to play well until the last whistle, and
I was pleased with how we kept
working. It was a good result."
The weekend sweep continues a
best-ever start for the Cardinal,
which now holds a perfect record
with just five games remaining in the
regular season. Stanford continues
Pacific-10 Conference play next
weekend on the road, facing off
against the Washington State
Cougars on Friday at 3 p.m. and the
Washington Huskies at noon on
Sunday.

It may be true that all good things must come to an
end. But judging from yet another sweep this weekend,
the Cardinal women aren't letting that end come any
time soon. Stanford, facing perhaps the toughest pair of
opponents of the regular season, continued its unde
feated season with a pair of shutout victories over con
ference rivals USC and UCLA.

Stanford opened the homes
tand Friday night with a 4-0 win
over No. 15 USC (11-4,3-1 Pac
-10), who was coming off a nine
game winning streak of its own.
The Trojans were able to hold
No. 1 Stanford scoreless in the
first half, despite being out-shot
19-3.

The first great chance for
Stanford (15-0-0, 4-0-0) fell to
freshman center back Alina
Garciamendez in the ninth
minute. Garciamendez got a
good header off of a corner
kick, only to see USC senior
keeper Kristin Olsen make the
save. The Cardinal continued to

GAME NOTES: No. 1 Stanford earned its top rank
again this weekend, taking out No. 15 USC and
No. 3 UCLA, 4-0 and 2-0, respectively. No. 24
Washington State would love to end the Cardinal's
undefeated streak, and will have a better shot with
a home field advantage. But Stanford enters the
game with momentum and confidence, and will be
hard-pressed to give up their solo spot atop confer

ELIZABETH CLAIR/The Stanford Daily
Christen Press had a team-leading 10 shots and
two goals in Friday's 4-0 win against USC. The
junior added five more shots against UCLA, but
had an early goal called back for offsides.
make Olsen work hard throughout
the first half, forcing save after save,
and, by the end of the period, Olsen
had recorded seven. While USC had
a few looks at goal, Stanford junior
keeper Kira Maker was not called
into action to make a stop.
The game went into halftime 0-0,
but as has been the case throughout
the year, the Cardinal opened up the
floodgates in the second half. Stan
ford Head Coach Paul Ratcliffe was
pleased with his team's persistence
on offense.

"We really just were slowly
breaking the other team down, so
we had the chances all along and
their goalie came up big," he reflect
ed. "Once we had one goal, it boost
ed our confidence and really
opened things up, so you just have
to break the ice, and we were able to
do that."

In the 53rd minute, senior for
ward Kelley O'Hara found space on
the left and blasted a low shot to
ward goal. Once again, Olsen made
the save, but this time spilled her re
bound. Junior forward Christen
Press who had been the focal
point of the Stanford attack all
game was there to tap it home
and give the Card the lead.
"We'd been taking long-range
shots for a long time, and that was
just a great shot by Kelley," Press
said of her scoring opportunity. "I
just happened to be there for the re
bound. It's slippery out there, so
there was a good chance for a re
bound and I was able to take advan
tage."

The Cardinal doubled its lead
just two minutes later. Sophomore
Lindsay Taylor pushed past a de
fender on the right and centered a
ball through the box. The cross made
it past the opposite post, where
O'Hara was waiting to slot it in.
The two quick goals seemed to
demoralize the Trojans, and within
15 minutes, the game was safely out
of reach. O'Hara notched a second
goal in the 63rd minute, this time
seeing her shot deflect in off a USC
defender.

Five minutes later, Press made a
drive from the midfield and un
leashed a blast of her own from out
side the box this time, Olsen

could not keep it out. With the
score, the junior matched her team
mate and finished off the game's
scoring, ending it 4-0.
