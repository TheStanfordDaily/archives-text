### NATE ADAMS SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITORS 
It may be true that all good things must come to an
end. But judging from yet another sweep this weekend,
the Cardinal women aren't letting that end come any
time soon. Stanford, facing perhaps the toughest pair of
opponents of the regular season, continued its unde

Stanford opened the homes
tand Friday night with a 4-0 win
over No. 15 USC (11-4,3-1 Pac
-10), who was coming off a nine

The Trojans were able to hold

Stanford (15-0-0, 4-0-0) fell to
freshman center back Alina

GAME NOTES: No. 1 Stanford earned its top rank
again this weekend, taking out No. 15 USC and
No. 3 UCLA, 4-0 and 2-0, respectively. No. 24
Washington State would love to end the Cardinal's
undefeated streak, and will have a better shot with
a home field advantage. But Stanford enters the
game with momentum and confidence, and will be
hard-pressed to give up their solo spot atop confer
ence play.
