# WILDCATS 43 CARDINAL 38
## Wildcats claw back to beat Card Shotty defense proves Card's weakness on the road â€“ again 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The University of Arizona Wildcats (4-2,
2-1 Pacific-10 Conference) stunned
Stanford football in a 43-38 defeat in
Tucson on Saturday. With 3 minutes, 23 sec
onds left to play in the fourth quarter, the
Wildcats' junior Nic Grigsby, who had been
largely ineffective for most of the game,
found a hole in the Stanford defense and
cruised down the left sideline for a 57-yard
rushing touchdown.

Despite an impressive 11-play, 61-yard
final drive, a trio of incomplete passes pre
vented the Cardinal (4-3, 3-2 Pac-10) from
overcoming its five-point deficit.
The game marked the first time Stanford
has lost in Tucson in five years.
It was a big night for both teams, full of
staggering offensive statistics. The
Cardinal's offense netted 584 total offen
sive yards to the Wildcats' 553. Stanford
freshman quarterback Andrew Luck
racked up 423 passing yards and three
touchdowns, while senior running
back Toby Gerhart ran for 123 yards
and two touchdowns. On the other
side, the Wildcats' sophomore quar
terback Nick Foles tallied 415 pass
ing yards and three touchdowns.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal's
prolific offense could not compen
sate for its lack of defensive effort,
which all but collapsed in response to
an Arizona rally in the fourth.
The game opened in Stanford's
favor, as sophomore wide receiver
Chris Owusu returned the opening
kickoff for 52 yards to the Arizona
33. Just two short plays later, on third
and long, Luck's pass was intercept
ed by Wildcat sophomore corner
back Robert Golden, who then re
turned it for a 79-yard touchdown.
The Cardinal responded with yet
another long kickoff return. This
time, sophomore cornerback
Michael Thomas brought the ball 56
yards to the Arizona 44. After the
Wildcats twice stopped Gerhart at
the line of scrimmage, Luck connect
ed with a wide-open Jim Dray in the
end zone and tied the score at 7-7.

On the next Arizona possession,
senior cornerback Kris Evans
stripped the ball from Wildcats'
Juron Criner, forcing a fumble that
Cardinal senior linebacker Will Pow
ers recovered. Stanford then ran a
wildcat formation, with Gerhart tak
ing the snap and rushing just short of
a first down. However, when Luck
returned to the field, he fumbled the
snap and turned the ball over for the
second time.
Some confusion over coverage
among Stanford defense allowed
Foles to connect with sophomore
David Douglas on a 43-yard pass for
another touchdown.
Trailing 13-7, the Cardinal rallied
back, thoroughly exploiting its entire
offensive arsenal. After an Arizona
punt placed the ball at the Stanford
32, Luck passed to sophomore wide
receiver Warren Reuland for 17
yards, then to freshman wide receiv
er Tyler Gaffney for 22. With the ball
on the Arizona 11, Luck connected
with junior wide receiver Ryan
Whalen for 11 more yards and the
score.
Midway into the second quarter,
the Cardinal again forced Arizona to

punt into Stanford territory. With the
ball at the Card's own 30, they ran a
flea-flicker: Luck took the snap and
handed the ball off to Gerhart, Ger
hart passed it back to Luck, and Luck
fired downfield to Reuland for a 45-
yard reception. Luck capped off the
drive with a pass to Owusu in the end
zone, making the score 28-13.
The Cardinal looked strong in the
third quarter, coming in with a 28-20
edge, and increasing that lead to 38-
29 by the quarter's close.
In the fourth, however, the Cardi
nal was simply unable to score
missing a field goal from 28 yards
out, later resorting to its first punt
and lay victim to a series of Wildcat
touchdowns.
With 6:06 left on the clock, Stan
ford had an opportunity to extend its
38-36 lead. On 4th and one on the
Arizona eight, the Card went for it.
The play naturally would have gone
to Gerhart, but he had sustained an
ankle injury on the previous play. In
stead, Luck went to Owusu, but
Owusu dropped the ball and ended
the possession.

Despite taking the ball on their
own eight, Arizona completed a se
ries of quick plays that pushed them
downfield. On the first possession,
Foles kept the ball and rushed for a
gain of five. He then found Criner for
a 37-yard completion to bring the
ball to the 50-yard line. After a short
rush loss and a penalty, Foles handed
off to Grigsby, who rushed for 57
yards to the end zone. The score,
coming in five plays and 2:30, gave
Arizona the lead, 43-38.
A valiant effort by Luck in a series
of connections brought the Cardinal
within reach of a victory. With 0:38

left to play, at 2nd and 10 at the Ari
zona 17, Luck was unable to com
plete any of his passes: a pass to jun
ior wide receiver Doug Baldwin was
dropped, one to Whalen in the end
zone was just out of reach, and a final
attempt that went to Owusu in the
end zone was batted away.
"This is the toughest loss you
could be a part of," Harbaugh said to
the SF Gate. "I don't have away to
lift their spirits right now ... We'll
find away to bounce back."

GAME NOTES: Stanford has proved unable
to win on the road all season. Luckily, the
Cardinal returns home for its encounter
with Arizona State. The Sun Devils have
won just one road game themselves: at
the conference's worst, Washington State.
But a stunner over Washington last week
end puts Arizona State in a four-way tie
for second in the conference at 2-1, and
the Sun Devils will look to knock Stanford
further out of the Pac-1 0 race.

The University of Arizona Wildcats (4-2,
2-1 Pacific-10 Conference) stunned
Stanford football in a 43-38 defeat in
Tucson on Saturday. With 3 minutes, 23 sec
onds left to play in the fourth quarter, the
Wildcats' junior Nic Grigsby, who had been
largely ineffective for most of the game,
found a hole in the Stanford defense and
cruised down the left sideline for a 57-yard
rushing touchdown.

Despite an impressive 11-play, 61-yard
final drive, a trio of incomplete passes pre
vented the Cardinal (4-3, 3-2 Pac-10) from
overcoming its five-point deficit.
The game marked the first time Stanford
has lost in Tucson in five years.
It was a big night for both teams, full of
staggering offensive statistics. The
Cardinal's offense netted 584 total offen
sive yards to the Wildcats' 553. Stanford
freshman quarterback Andrew Luck
racked up 423 passing yards and three
touchdowns, while senior running
back Toby Gerhart ran for 123 yards
and two touchdowns. On the other
side, the Wildcats' sophomore quar
terback Nick Foles tallied 415 pass
ing yards and three touchdowns.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal's
prolific offense could not compen
sate for its lack of defensive effort,
which all but collapsed in response to
an Arizona rally in the fourth.
The game opened in Stanford's
favor, as sophomore wide receiver
Chris Owusu returned the opening
kickoff for 52 yards to the Arizona
33. Just two short plays later, on third
and long, Luck's pass was intercept
ed by Wildcat sophomore corner
back Robert Golden, who then re
turned it for a 79-yard touchdown.
The Cardinal responded with yet
another long kickoff return. This
time, sophomore cornerback
Michael Thomas brought the ball 56
yards to the Arizona 44. After the
Wildcats twice stopped Gerhart at
the line of scrimmage, Luck connect
ed with a wide-open Jim Dray in the
end zone and tied the score at 7-7.

On the next Arizona possession,
senior cornerback Kris Evans
stripped the ball from Wildcats'
Juron Criner, forcing a fumble that
Cardinal senior linebacker Will Pow
ers recovered. Stanford then ran a
wildcat formation, with Gerhart tak
ing the snap and rushing just short of
a first down. However, when Luck
returned to the field, he fumbled the
snap and turned the ball over for the
second time.
Some confusion over coverage
among Stanford defense allowed
Foles to connect with sophomore
David Douglas on a 43-yard pass for
another touchdown.
Trailing 13-7, the Cardinal rallied
back, thoroughly exploiting its entire
offensive arsenal. After an Arizona
punt placed the ball at the Stanford
32, Luck passed to sophomore wide
receiver Warren Reuland for 17
yards, then to freshman wide receiv
er Tyler Gaffney for 22. With the ball
on the Arizona 11, Luck connected
with junior wide receiver Ryan
Whalen for 11 more yards and the
score.
Midway into the second quarter,
the Cardinal again forced Arizona to

punt into Stanford territory. With the
ball at the Card's own 30, they ran a
flea-flicker: Luck took the snap and
handed the ball off to Gerhart, Ger
hart passed it back to Luck, and Luck
fired downfield to Reuland for a 45-
yard reception. Luck capped off the
drive with a pass to Owusu in the end
zone, making the score 28-13.
The Cardinal looked strong in the
third quarter, coming in with a 28-20
edge, and increasing that lead to 38-
29 by the quarter's close.
In the fourth, however, the Cardi
nal was simply unable to score
missing a field goal from 28 yards
out, later resorting to its first punt
and lay victim to a series of Wildcat
touchdowns.
With 6:06 left on the clock, Stan
ford had an opportunity to extend its
38-36 lead. On 4th and one on the
Arizona eight, the Card went for it.
The play naturally would have gone
to Gerhart, but he had sustained an
ankle injury on the previous play. In
stead, Luck went to Owusu, but
Owusu dropped the ball and ended
the possession.

Despite taking the ball on their
own eight, Arizona completed a se
ries of quick plays that pushed them
downfield. On the first possession,
Foles kept the ball and rushed for a
gain of five. He then found Criner for
a 37-yard completion to bring the
ball to the 50-yard line. After a short
rush loss and a penalty, Foles handed
off to Grigsby, who rushed for 57
yards to the end zone. The score,
coming in five plays and 2:30, gave
Arizona the lead, 43-38.
A valiant effort by Luck in a series
of connections brought the Cardinal
within reach of a victory. With 0:38

left to play, at 2nd and 10 at the Ari
zona 17, Luck was unable to com
plete any of his passes: a pass to jun
ior wide receiver Doug Baldwin was
dropped, one to Whalen in the end
zone was just out of reach, and a final
attempt that went to Owusu in the
end zone was batted away.
"This is the toughest loss you
could be a part of," Harbaugh said to
the SF Gate. "I don't have away to
lift their spirits right now ... We'll
find away to bounce back."
