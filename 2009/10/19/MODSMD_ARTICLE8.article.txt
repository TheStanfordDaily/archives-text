### CHARLIE MINTZ 
Alienated and alone, the
stranger left Stanford. Last
Monday, after a week of osten
sibly touring the Stanford co
ops as an ambassador from the
UC-Berkeley co-op scene, he left, on a bus
bound for UC-Davis, in pursuit of the
thing he failed to find here.
"I'm in search of something great hap
pening," said Iskundar "Isky" Haddad on
the day of his departure, sitting at one of
the hand-painted tables outside
Columbae. "Somebody to reach out to me
or give me some reason for what I'm
doing."
Maybe it was naive of Isky to come to
the Stanford co-ops looking for all that.
Stanford co-ops have been known to open
their doors to idiosyncratic strangers, but
what Isky left with was a sense of frustra
tion and disillusionment. The co-ops here
offered little of the inclusion that he had
found at dozens of other college co-ops
around the country.
❖ ❖ ❖
A 20-year-old student at Berkeley City
College, Isky was a stranger here, and most
people don't have time for strangers. Even
after he introduced himself, which he did
— abundantly, effusively, heedlessly — he
was still inescapably an outsider: a lanky,
dark-haired kid with ferocious mutton
chops wearing Stanford gear he found in
the free stores. To many, it wasn't clear
what he wanted, or why he was pursuing it
here.
By the first evening of his visit, Isky had
appeared in the Columbae lounge, intro
ducing himself before the house meeting
as a "Berkeley student waiting for his
tuition to come through" and offering his
availability to hang out, or attend classes
or just wander around Stanford. He left
scraps of paper with his phone number,
reminding people to call him for a round
of Halo or an adventure.
Reed Matheny '10, a co-op resident,
recalled that he liked Isky at first. He was
"friendly, energetic," and "had a lot to talk
about." But soon he found Isky's presence
discomforting.
"When you have a person like that in
the house, who's a guest, but doesn't share
any history with anyone in the house,
there's really just a tension that can't be
eased," said Matheny, staring off towards
the couch where they first met. "It puts an
odd feeling in the back of your mind."
Reed wasn't alone in that sentiment.
People began to grow annoyed with Isky
as his presence impinged on their lives.
Isky tried to come aboard the Stanford

Band's bus — he was invited by a few
Band members, but they were overruled.
He invited himself on a camping trip and
irritated the others by getting drunk and
singing along with his iPhone. People
called him sketchy and house e-mails
began circulating as house managers and
Resident Assistants (RAs) debated what
to do about him.
Eventually he was refused guest status
by Columbae, Synergy and Chi Theta Chi.
The co-ops had shut their doors to the
stranger.
Of course, they were justified. Isky had
overstayed his welcome. Yet if there's one
Stanford community where Isky should
have found a place, it was among the very
co-ops that had refused him. They, more
than anywhere else on campus, share the
burden of keeping alive the long-faded,
some would say corny, ideals of open
mindedness, idiosyncrasy and inclusion
that cooperative living once embodied.
It was among them that Isky sought his
fantasy of Platonic connection — a
stranger who would forget Isky's strange
ness and reach out to him. Perhaps unsur
prisingly, that didn't happen. The question
is then, did he fail, or did the co-ops?
❖ ❖ ❖
Isky arrived at Stanford via an invita
tion from a Stanford student named
"Jane." She met him through a Web site
popular for coordinating these endeavors,
and invited him to stay for several days at
her co-op.
The plan was that he would sleep in an
empty room downstairs and help out
around the house to earn his keep. In the
meantime, he would share his knowledge
about cooperative living, acquired from
years of visiting co-ops around the country
and from his own experience at the
Berkeley clothing-optional co-op
Lothlorien.
Tothlorien is an important part of Isky's
story. The community of 60 or so students
was the "only place [he] ever felt at home."
He couch-surfed into the house, and
ended up spending several months there.
"Loth made me so happy because I got
to see nothing but people interacting lov
ingly," he said. "It was one big cuddle pile
after work or school."
For Isky, an outsider in his hometown of
Jacksonville, Florida, who spent the ages of
11-16 "locked in his room with video
games, Wikipedia and Netflix," Lothlorien
was Utopia.
"It was the most emotionally support
ive place I'd ever seen of people my age,"
he said.
