# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## For grad school, run away from the Ph.D. 
### Danny Crichton 
The leaves are turning colors and the rain
has already begun to fall. It is fall again
at Stanford, and that means another ad
missions season is about to begin for seniors
not quite ready to move on to the "working"
world.

One of the degrees available is the Doctor
of Philosophy (Ph.D.), commonly the highest
degree attainable in a field. The degree
uniquely forces its candidates to become
world experts on a highly defined subject.
There is also a darker side to this degree that
few universities wish to discuss: The Ph.D. is a
disaster, and little evidence exists that the sit
uation will improve in the near term.
Last week, I wrote a column deploring the
trend of America's best students leaving ca
reers of invention and discovery for careers in
consulting. An element underlining the prob
lem is that strong candidates for Ph.D. pro
grams are choosing to pursue other options
instead of more education. Knowingly or not,
these students are making the right decision
today.

After spending years in a doctorate pro
gram, graduates are offered few options in
the academic job market. The doctorate is a
research degree that prepares its candidates
exclusively for research, a profession that
takes place in few institutions outside of aca
demia. Budget cuts have reduced the number
of tenure-line positions, limiting potential po
sitions to record lows.

The number of open positions for history
doctorate holders, for example, is almost one
for every five graduates, a trend seen across
departments in the humanities, social sci
ences and natural sciences. Even worse, once
a graduate has failed at finding a position,
search committees will often ignore that per
son for later openings, preferring newer grad
uates.

The Ph.D. is lengthier than other degrees,
and rightfully so. However, the time to degree
has risen considerably, damaging the finances
of students and increasing attrition rates.
I have talked to my peers about their ex
pectations regarding the Ph.D. Most believed
that a doctorate could be completed in four or
five years. In reality, it is hard to find any pro
gram that can be completed in five years or
less. According to a Council of Graduate

Schools report, only 57 percent of doctoral
candidates will graduate in 10 years; the aver
age length was eight years.
The time to degree is linked to the increas
ing workload of graduate students. Teaching
more classes means less time for research and
writing, delaying degree completion.
Some schools are changing. Princeton has
prioritized lowering the Ph.D. length, and
Harvard has threatened to withhold admis
sions slots if too many of a department's stu
dents are falling behind. Other institutions
need similar reform.

Given the nature of academia, few gradu
ates make fat salaries upon graduation. Loans
being impractical, funding is an important
consideration for graduate work. While Stan
ford and peer institutions offer generous
packages to ensure the financial health of its
students, most schools cannot. Financing a de
gree entails teaching multiple classes a quar
ter, thereby extending the degree, or going

into debt, which is a bad move. Too few stu
dents connect the financial dots of the doctor
ate.

Finally, the length of the degree coupled
with a bleak employment market provides lit
tle encouragement to graduate. In fact, the at
trition rate in doctoral programs is abysmal.
In most fields, one-fifth of students will leave
by the fourth year, and that is only half way
through the typical program.
If all of this sounds scary, it should. But
with clarity and thoughtful questioning, the
Ph.D. does not have to be disastrous. Every
field has schools that offer the support and
administrative structure to ensure success.
Finding these programs has to be a priority
for any student considering a doctorate.
There are three questions to ask a poten
tial program: The finishing rate, the time to
degree and the placement list. The finishing
rate and time to degree indicates a depart
ment's support for its graduate students. If
more students are finishing and doing so
faster, this likely means that they are better
funded and have better advisers. It also avoids
the trap of programs that specifically enroll
more students only to cut them later on with
comprehensive examinations.
Tlie placement list may be the most impor
tant indication of the strength of a program.
Considering the academic market, a program
that places a high percentage of its graduates
into tenure-track positions is an excellent sign
of a strong program.
At this point, I want to particularly con
gratulate Duke for being among the most
open universities regarding its doctorate pro
grams. The school deserves special mention
for publishing this information in a standard
ized format for all of its programs. Stanford
should follow in their footsteps with similar
transparency.

Choosing to pursue a doctorate is not a
light decision considering that an entire
decade may be used to complete it. While I
cannot recommend a Ph.D. for anyone, the
right questions and mindset can do wonders
in the search for the best program. Godspeed.
