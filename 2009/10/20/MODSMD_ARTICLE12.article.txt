## CROSS COUNTRY Men, women run strong in Pre-Nationals 
### JULIA BROWNELL ZACH ZIMMERMAN 
The No. 1 Stanford men's cross country team proved that
they are the team to beat this year with a dominant win at the
NCAA Cross Country Pre-Nationals in Terre Haute, Ind. on
Saturday.
Sophomore Chris Derrick led the Cardinal with a blistering
time of 23:27 in the eight-kilometer race, the fastest time in ei
ther of the two men's races. He came from behind to pass Sam
Chelanga of Liberty College, who won last year's pre-nationals.
"We came into this meet ranked number one, but it was
something we weren't trying to pay much attention to," Derrick
said. "We wanted to come out and show against good competi
tion that we are for real and that we are going to be a national
title contender. We also wanted to show ourselves that we could
perform against competition that we know well. We did exactly
what we wanted to do."
After a non-scoring performance at the Stanford Invitation
al, junior Elliot Heath came in with a blazing third-place finish
overall as the Card's second runner. At 23:39, he bested his in
vitational time by almost a full minute, showcasing his ability to
contribute to scoring through the post-season.
Junior Justin Maripole-Bird proved to be a pleasant surprise
for the Card as he came in 10th with a strong 23:57 perform
ance, followed by teammate sophomore Jacob Riley in 11th
with a time of 24:00. To round out the scorers, junior Brendan
Gregg came in at 24:10, good for 22nd place,
"Justin had a really good race," Derrick said. "Elliot also had
a great performance. It sets us up really well for the future be
cause we know we have a lot of work left to do and we are start
ing from a very good spot."
Altogether, the Card's top five runners totaled 47 points, en
tirely overshadowing second-place Colorado's score of 130 in
the men's "white" race. In the "blue" race, Oregon won, fol
lowed by Northern Arizona University.
Pre-national is the team's first chance to really perform on
the national stage, and the Cardinal showed that its dominance
at the less competitive Stanford Invitational was no fluke. The
Card will try to keep their momentum going into next Satur
day's Pac-10 Championships in Long Beach.
Derrick is confident that the team's performance last week
end will translate into success down the road.

Both of Stanford's cross country teams are having relatively
strong seasons, and last weekend was more of the same. The
No. 1 men earned first, while the women came in third.
