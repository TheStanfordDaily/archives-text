## Men's water polo defeats Santa Clara and Pepperdine 
### MIKE LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
Coming off a tough loss to rival Cal, the Cardinal
bounced back last weekend by defeating No. 16 Santa
Clara, 10-4, on Saturday and No. 5 Pepperdine, 13-5, on
Sunday.
In its second conference game of the season, No. 3
Stanford (14-1,2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
jumped out to an early lead against the Pepperdine
Waves. Redshirt freshman Travis Noll and sophomore
Jacob Smith gave the Cardinal a 2-0 advantage on con
secutive possessions.
"We normally come out slow, but we came out fast
[on Sunday]," Noll said. "We realize there's a sense of ur
gency since we're no longer number one, so we have to
fight for every game."
Pepperdine immediately countered with its only goal
of the first period, scoring on a five-meter penalty shot.
Stanford stayed perfect on converting scoring opportu
nities, as junior Alex Pulido found the back of the cage
on an outside shot.

Noll and Smith each scored once more in the period,
as did senior Janson Wigo, to pull out to a 6-1 lead.

"We huddled up after the end of the first quarter and
our coach told us that was our best quarter we've had all
season," said senior goalkeeper Jimmie Sandman. "We
were three for our first three, which really hurt their
goalie's confidence,"
Scoring was at a premium in the second period. Sand
man had an impressive block to deny a six-on-five Pep
perdine power play on the Waves' first possession of the
period. Junior Jeffrey Schwimer then scored the Cardi
nal's only goal of the period, grabbing the rebound from
his blocked shot and sneaking it past the Pepperdine
goalkeeper.
Leading 7-2 at the break, the second half was all Stan
ford. The Cardinal outscored the Waves 4-2 in the third

heads to Stockton for its first conference match on the road.

The Cardinal men showed resilience last weekend, following a loss from Cal with a pair of convincing victories over
ranked opponents Santa Clara and Pepperdine at home. Stanford outscored both teams by a combined 23-9.

period, with goals coming from Noll,
Wigo, junior Will Smith and senior
Ryan McCarthy.
Pepperdine could not get into the
game in the fourth period, mustering
only one goal. The highlight of the
fourth quarter or at least the play
that drew the biggest fan reaction
was the entrance of freshman goalie
Scott Platshon, who came in with two
minutes left to play to spell Sandman.
On his first defensive possession, Plat
shon made a Sandman-esque one
armed block on an open player's shot.
"I'm trying to play a perfect game
so we can get a big lead and that guy
can get in there and play," Sandman
said. "I'm just happy that he could
play and make a sweet save. He was
stoked, too."
Smith's third score of the game, a
lob shot over the goalie set up by a
strong pump fake, sealed Stanford's
13-5 victory.
The victory marked the third time
Stanford has beaten Pepperdine this
season. The Cardinal defeated the
Waves 15-9 on Sept. 19 in the NorCal
Invitational and 13-3 on Oct. 10 in the
UC Irvine Invitational.

"They're normally a little more
tired in a tournament setting," Sand
man said. "This is a conference game,
just a single game, and Pepperdine is a
team that brings a lot of energy."
On Saturday, Stanford made quick
work of its South Bay neighbor. Mc-
Carthy led all scorers with three goals.
Schwimer and Wigo each had two
goals, as Noll, Pulido and Smith also

added one a piece.
The Cardinal wasted no time, scor
ing within the first minute on a six-on
five opportunity. Up 3-1 after the first
period, Stanford shut out the Broncos
in the second period, increasing its
lead to 5-1 at the half.

Stanford outscored Santa Clara, 5-
3, in the second half to earn the 10-4
victory.

"When we get out to a big lead, we
tend to slow down and stop scoring,"
Noll said. "We've been working on
game situations in practice when
you're up late and keeping the pres
sure on."

Up next for the Cardinal is anoth
er conference game at No. 12 Pacific
on Oct. 23. The Tigers are 14-6 on the
season, but lost to the same Pepper
dine team 10-4 earlier in the year.
