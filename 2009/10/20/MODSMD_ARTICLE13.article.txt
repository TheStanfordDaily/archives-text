## Men's water polo defeats Santa Clara and Pepperdine 
### MIKE LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
Coming off a tough loss to rival Cal, the Cardinal
bounced back last weekend by defeating No. 16 Santa
Clara, 10-4, on Saturday and No. 5 Pepperdine, 13-5, on
Sunday.
In its second conference game of the season, No. 3
Stanford (14-1,2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
jumped out to an early lead against the Pepperdine
Waves. Redshirt freshman Travis Noll and sophomore
Jacob Smith gave the Cardinal a 2-0 advantage on con
secutive possessions.
"We normally come out slow, but we came out fast
[on Sunday]," Noll said. "We realize there's a sense of ur
gency since we're no longer number one, so we have to
fight for every game."
Pepperdine immediately countered with its only goal
of the first period, scoring on a five-meter penalty shot.
Stanford stayed perfect on converting scoring opportu
nities, as junior Alex Pulido found the back of the cage
on an outside shot.

Noll and Smith each scored once more in the period,
as did senior Janson Wigo, to pull out to a 6-1 lead.

"We huddled up after the end of the first quarter and
our coach told us that was our best quarter we've had all
season," said senior goalkeeper Jimmie Sandman. "We
were three for our first three, which really hurt their
goalie's confidence,"
Scoring was at a premium in the second period. Sand
man had an impressive block to deny a six-on-five Pep
perdine power play on the Waves' first possession of the
period. Junior Jeffrey Schwimer then scored the Cardi
nal's only goal of the period, grabbing the rebound from
his blocked shot and sneaking it past the Pepperdine
goalkeeper.
Leading 7-2 at the break, the second half was all Stan
ford. The Cardinal outscored the Waves 4-2 in the third
