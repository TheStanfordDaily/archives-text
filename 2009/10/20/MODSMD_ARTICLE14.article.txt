## Card in command at home Stanford routs UC-Davis, sets season high in goals 
### ALISSA HABER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 13 Stanford women's field hockey team
(12-2,4-1 NorPac) continued to display its offensive
firepower this past weekend at the Varsity Turf.
With a staggering 11-1 victory over conference op
ponent UC-Davis on Saturday, the Cardinal is also
continuing to assert its dominance in the NorPac
West Division.
In the first of its last two league matchups, the Car
dinal was able to gain a significant amount of offen
sive momentum as it registered a season-best 33 shots
on goal, making it the eighth time this year the Cardi
nal has attempted at least 20 shots in a game.
This is also the first time Stanford has registered
double-digit goals since the 2007 season.
It seemed that Davis did not have a chance from
the outset, as the Cardinal, playing in front of a large
home crowd that included the Stanford Band and the
Dollies, gained momentum very quickly, scoring four
goals in the first 10 minutes of the contest. The Cardi
nal scored seven in the first half.
Leading the Stanford offensive attack was senior
Midori Uehara, who for the third time this year
scored at least three goals in one match as she regis
tered a hat trick against the Aggies. Uehara also had
a career-high eight shots during the contest.
But the offensive success was evenly distributed as
six other Cardinal players found the net over the
course of the contest. Juniors Camille Ghandi and
Xanthe Travlos were also impressive in the contest,
registering two goals apiece.
Senior Mariana Shile, juniors Katherine Donner
and Jaimee Erickson, and sophomore Stephanie
Byrne all recorded a goal in the first half.
Senior Nora Soza knows that this balanced offen
sive attack is what makes Stanford such a large offen
sive threat.
"We attack the goal as a team, not relying on one
player to win games for us," Soza said.
Perhaps equally as impressive as the goals was the
Cardinal's ability to set the table. Soza recorded three
assists on the match, bringing her to a season total of
12, which leads the team on the year. Erickson and
freshman Becky Dru recorded two assists of their
own.
The Cardinal win completed the season sweep of
the Aggies, who fell to 0-4 in the NorPac.The win also
brings Stanford within two victories of matching the
single-season win record, which was set by the 1997
squad.
The win also keeps the Cardinal
undefeated at home, as it has a per
fect 5-0 record at the Varsity Turf.

This is not the first time this sea
son that Stanford has been so domi
nant on the offensive side of the ball.
The Cardinal also recorded blowout
wins over Kent State and Temple
earlier in the season when it record
ed seven goals in each game.
Soza explained that offensive
output is something in which her
team takes pride. "We set specific
goals to obtain, keeping us focused
and at a high intensity all game, con
stantly making ourselves better,"
she said.
Stanford's nationally recognized
offense is also closing in on many
single season records, including as
sists, points and shots.
Liz Seimion scored for the Ag
gies in the last minutes of the game
to avoid the shutout, but the nation
ally ranked Cardinal defense was as
stingy as ever, limiting Davis to only
six shots in the entire match.
Up next for Stanford is the final
game of the NorPac regular season,
in which the Cardinal hosts Califor
nia (5-9, 3-1 NorPac) this Friday at
the Varsity Turf. This fast home game
will be Senior Night as it is the final
home game of the season. A Stan
ford win would clinch the NorPac
West Division regular season title,
and the Cardinal will be looking to
avenge its loss last month to the
Golden Bears in Berkeley.

Soza and her team are aware of
the implications surrounding this
contest. "Facing Cal on our Senior
Night couldn't come at a better
time," she said. "We have a score to
finish, and it's bound to be an excit
ing game."
