## Struggling Card in need of Luck Stanford looks to rebound from two straight road losses 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
Saturday's 43-38 loss at Arizona was the toughest
kind to take.
The Cardinal defense, which had been effectively
employing the "bend but don't break" method up
until the past two weekends, was hit up by Arizona
quarterback Nick Foles for 415 yards and three touch
downs. The most remarkable or unremarkable

stat was that the Wildcats' quarterback completed
nearly 80 percent of his passes, moving the ball
against the Stanford defense at will in the second half.
"There were a lot of easy gains," Harbaugh told the
San Francisco Chronicle. "Our corners would play off,
and they would throw the short passes. Our corners
would play tight and they would beat us over the top.
Offensive execution, or lack thereof, also plagued

factoring into the final outcome of the game (with a
final score of 43-38), certainly would have made
things tougher for Arizona in its comeback attempt.
Dropped balls were also a problem for Stanford, as
sophomore wide receiver Chris Owusu, despite the
great season he's had, dropped multiple passes, in

eluding one at a crucial juncture in the game this
time, on a fourth-down conversion that would have
helped put the Wildcats away for good.
Not much more can be said about Stanford's loss
on Saturday. It was devastating, plain and simple. To
point out the team's flaws and ramble on any more
about what they could have done to win on Saturday
would just be redundant.
As tough as Saturday's loss was tough to swallow,
finding its silver lining isn't all that hard. And with any
Luck, it's a silver lining that will continue guiding the
Cardinal the next three and a half years.
