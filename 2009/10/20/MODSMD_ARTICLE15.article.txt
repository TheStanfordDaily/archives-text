## Struggling Card in need of Luck Stanford looks to rebound from two straight road losses 
### JACK SALISBURY STAFF WRITER 
Saturday's 43-38 loss at Arizona was the toughest
kind to take.
The Cardinal defense, which had been effectively
employing the "bend but don't break" method up
until the past two weekends, was hit up by Arizona
quarterback Nick Foles for 415 yards and three touch
downs. The most remarkable or unremarkable

stat was that the Wildcats' quarterback completed
nearly 80 percent of his passes, moving the ball
against the Stanford defense at will in the second half.
"There were a lot of easy gains," Harbaugh told the
San Francisco Chronicle. "Our corners would play off,
and they would throw the short passes. Our corners
would play tight and they would beat us over the top.
Offensive execution, or lack thereof, also plagued
the Cardinal. Junior placekicker Nate Whitaker
missed a routine 36-yard field goal which, while not
factoring into the final outcome of the game (with a
final score of 43-38), certainly would have made
things tougher for Arizona in its comeback attempt.
Dropped balls were also a problem for Stanford, as
sophomore wide receiver Chris Owusu, despite the
great season he's had, dropped multiple passes, in

eluding one at a crucial juncture in the game this
time, on a fourth-down conversion that would have
helped put the Wildcats away for good.
Not much more can be said about Stanford's loss
on Saturday. It was devastating, plain and simple. To
point out the team's flaws and ramble on any more
about what they could have done to win on Saturday
would just be redundant.
As tough as Saturday's loss was tough to swallow,
finding its silver lining isn't all that hard. And with any
Luck, it's a silver lining that will continue guiding the
Cardinal the next three and a half years.
Redshirt freshman Andrew Luck came to the
Farm with plenty acclaim and accolades, both as a
five-star recruit and the valedictori
an at Stratford Fligh School in
Houston. Luck was fairly good in
his first six games quarterback of
the Cardinal, but it wasn't until this
weekend when he showed the num
bers that he's capable of putting up.
It only took him midway
through his first season to post a ca
reer game, as Luck amassed an eye
popping 423 yards and three touch
downs on 21-of-35 passing. Though
he did throw a pick-six to Wildcat
defender Robert Golden in the
opening moments of the game.
Luck recovered from that mistake
and nearly led Stanford to an im
probable comeback drive that
started with less than three minutes
on the clock.
"He's special," Harbaugh said
after the game. "He's coming into
his own."
Whether he was standing tall in
the pocket or running for a first
down, Luck looked at ease on Sat
urday. His throws were crisp and
right on target, hitting his receivers
despite the dropped passes in
stride.
Luck was even on the receiving
end of things, making a diving catch
after a trick-play toss from wide re
ceiver Griff Whalen.
With all that said, a quarter
back's job at the end of the day is to
lead his team to victory, and his
merit is often measured on this sta
tistic more than any other. As the
team's signal caller, Luck definitely
felt the pain from Saturday's loss.
"It's heartbreaking," he said.
"It's tough. I've lost a lot of games,
but this one stinks the most."
One can only hope that the sting
from a loss like the one on Saturday
will help Luck's future career as the
Cardinal quarterback. While his
mistakes certainly didn't cost the
Cardinal the game, he erred when
Stanford received a delay-of-game
penalty with 30 seconds to go. The
penalty proved to be crucial as it
pushed the ball back to the 17-yard
line instead of the 12. That extra
five yards usually doesn't amount
to much, but it handcuffed Stan
ford's play-calling on the game's
final three plays.
Saturday's game was a showcase
of Luck's talents, but there's still
plenty of room for improvement, as
there always is for a quarterback in
his first year playing at the colle
giate level. And the opportunities
for improvement abound. Just try
this Saturday, when Luck and his
Cardinal teammates look for re
demption against another school
from the desert.

The Cardinal football team, after nearly earning a top-25 national ranking with
three Pac-10 wins, has lost each of its last two contests. Redshirt freshman quarter-back Andrew Luck has impressed so far, and looks to help his team rebound.
