# W. Golf: Not quite up to par

### Laura Malkiewich 
The Stanford women's golf team
wrapped up its final home tourna
ment of the season this Sunday at
the Stanford Intercollegiate. After
three rounds of competition, the
Cardinal took 12th overall in a stiff
field including No. 1 USC, No. 2
UCLA, No. 3 Arizona State and No.
7 California. Arizona State took
home the tournament win with a
total of 12-under-par (840). Mean
while, Jennifer Song of USC was the
individual leader for the weekend
with a total of 8-under par (205).

The Cardinal came in 53 strokes
behind, with a total of 41-over par
(893). Stanford's top scorer was jun
ior Rebecca Durham who stroked
2-over-par (215), tying for 17th
place on the individual leaderboard.
Despite strong efforts from

every player, the team was not fully
satisfied.

"We haven't played as well as we
hoped, both as individuals as well as
a team," said senior Angela King.
"Golf is such an up and down sport
and this just wasn't our week."
King had a strong weekend with
a total of 4-over-par (217), which
placed her in a three-way tie for
23rd overall. King recognizes her
role as an important part of the
team.

"The goal going into any tourna
ment as an individual is to bring in
the lowest score of the day," she re
flected. "You need to trust that no
matter what's going on with your
own game, the rest of your team is
there to back you up."
Backing up King was freshman
Kristina Wong, who tied for 38th
with a weekend total of 8-over-par

(221). The team's other freshman,
Sally Watson, came in with a total of
14-over-par (227) and tied for 51st.
Other performers included sopho
more Sydney Burlison, who tied for
54th this weekend with 15-over-par
(228). Piper Miller placed 76th over
all with a total of 26-over-par (239),
while Lila Barton was right behind
her in 77th overall with a total of 29-
over-par (242).
Stanford's recent tournament
performances have given the team
plenty to reflect on.
"Playing in tournaments over the
past couple weeks has helped us
identify our weaknesses and what
we need to work on," Burlison said.
"Hopefully we'll all improve what
we need to by February. Even
though we didn't have a strong per
