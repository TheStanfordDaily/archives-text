# The
						pain and glory of sports fandom
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
It's a Saturday night and you're
completely free; you've got no
work to do and nothing to be up
for in the morning. You can truly
do whatever you want. Yet, due to the
actions of people thousands of miles
away whom you've never met, your
life is ruined. No, I'm not trying to
teach you string theory and I'm not
trying to convert you to Voodooism.
I am just describing a typical day
in the life of a sports fan.
Now, I'm sure many of you have
no clue what I'm talking about. Your
day has never depended on the eye
sight of an umpire or the bounce of a
ball. You're probably also the people
who say, "It's just a game," or "Oh,
he's the one dating Gisele," while we
sports fans are in sports purgatory,
anxiously awaiting our fates without
any control over the results.
Being a sports fan is truly a sick,
perverse way to live. In what other
hobby can you lose without playing?
In what other hobby do you trust ex
criminals and middle-aged men to
ensure your happiness? In what other
hobby do you repeatedly spend your
time doing something that can make
you thoroughly miserable?
It may seem like I am trying to
stop people from watching sports.
This could not be further from the
truth. I love sports and I only know
about the pain it can cause because I
experience it firsthand. My goal is
simply to explain to non-fans why
sports affect fans so much so maybe
you non-fans can give us a break
once in a while, or at least understand
what we're going through.
This last Saturday was a rough
day for me. My two favorite teams,
the Angels and Stanford football,
both played arguably their most im
portant games of the season, games
that have a huge impact on the post
season chances for both teams. By
now, you might have seen what hap
pened: The Cardinal blew a nine
point fourth quarter lead at Arizona
and dropped several chances to
clinch the game before succumbing
in the final moments and putting our
once-confident hopes for a bowl
game in serious jeopardy. Mere
hours later, though it felt like days,
the Angels blew a lead in extra in
nings, left half the population of
Wyoming on base and played Little
League defense, allowing the Evil
Empire to take a 2-0 lead.
Needless to say, any reasonable
fan of a team would be unhappy to
see his team lose. I was not just upset,
though. I honestly felt like I could
never be happy again. J.K. Rowling
must have seen her favorite soccer
team lose when she came up with
Dementors, because I felt surround-

Ed by them that night. Only I'm a
Muggle and no Patronus was coming
to save my soul.
Now, the fact that I was lying on
my bed with the lights off comparing
myself to Harry Potter on a Saturday
night probably says more about my
social life than it does about sports
fans, but I promise you other people
understand my pain. Ask a diehard
Red Sox fan about Bucky Dent, Bill
Buckner or Aaron Boone. Ask a true
Stanford fan about The Play (it was
illegal and yes, I'm still bitter even
though I wasn't alive then). Ask a
Mets fan about, well, any game this
season.

It's no simple task to get over a
loss,\ and not having any ability to
change the outcome of the game
doesn't make it any easier.
I know that many people around
me hope for my favorite teams to win
just so I won't be upset all day and
when my favorite teams are losing I
have to make a concerted effort not
to look as upset as I feel just to avoid
the jokes of my friends. Lots of peo
ple say I shouldn't let sports affect
me so much, or that they aren't worth
caring this much.
I have two responses to this. First,
I don't think anyone goes into a
sporting event hoping for it to ruin
his day. Some people are just born to
live and die with their teams and
there isn't much that can change that.
Second, why aren't sports worth it? I
mean, obviously the health and well
being of people you care about
comes first, but after that, why not
sports? When trying to think of
things that are more important than
sports, I came up with pathetically
few answers. So I came to the simple
conclusion that sports ARE that im
portant to me, and I'm fine with that.
Sports are not just excuses for de
spair and disgust. Sports bring joy
and excitement to billions of people
around the world and I am glad to be
one of those people. Just last night
my Angels came back from a 3-0 hole
to beat the banes of my existence, the
New York Yankees, and the glow
from that win has overcome the an
noyance of two problem sets and a
midterm. Many of the best moments
of my life have come from sports and
all those people who have sports hor
ror stories have just as many sports
glory stories.
So when your friend, family mem
ber or significant other walks away
from the television in disgust and
does not reappear for hours, you
don't need to call a psychiatrist
they'll be okay eventually.
Just don't say it's only a game.
