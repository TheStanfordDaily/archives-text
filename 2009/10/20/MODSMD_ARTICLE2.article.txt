## Nobel winner reflects on Farm 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
A Stanford graduate has won the 2009
Nobel Prize in Economics.

Oliver Williamson, Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB) alumnus and current
professor emeritus at UC-Berkeley's Haas
School of Business, shared The Sveriges
Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in
Memory of Alfred Nobel for 2009 with Indiana
University and Arizona University State
University Prof. Elinor Ostrom.
Williamson, who received a Bachelor of
Science from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology before applying to the GSB, took
his first economics course at Stanford as a busi
ness student.
"My earlier training was in engineering,"
Williamson said. "It was principally a chemical
engineering background. But rather than
remaining in engineering, I decided to apply to
the GSB and was accepted. Participating in the
program was transformative because I discov
ered economics as a world."
Stanford was the place where Williamson
realized that economics was a "really exciting
arena." He began to view it as a discipline that
had much more rigor and was related to issues
more fascinating than he had previously imag
ined.
Williamson named a number of Stanford
professors, including Economics Professor
Emeritus James Howell, who were instrumental
in guiding his burgeoning interest in economics.

"I ended up in Jim Howell's office talking to
him about issues coming up in class,"
Williamson said. "At some point in these con
versations he urged me to take advantage of the
full range of resources at the University, specif
ically over at the economics, statistics and math
ematics departments.
"So, my second year I did take full advan
tage of all the resources of the University,"
Williamson added. "All that, together with the
GSB, provided me with a broader background
than I had anticipated a background that
allowed me to do an interdisciplinary econom
ics program, transfer to Carnegie-Mellon and
finish my Ph.D. in the economics program."
After graduating from the GSB in 1960,
Williamson went on to earn a Ph.D. in econom
ics from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1963.
Winning the Nobel
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
awarded Williamson the Nobel Prize "for his
analysis of economic governance, especially the
boundaries of the firm."
Williamson, whose research deals primarily
with contracts and transaction costs, argues that
there is a difference between repeated case-by
case bargaining and relationship-specific con
tracts.
"The contract approach to economics is in its
early stages of development," Williamson said.
"But it has some applications to new areas; it
has applications to issues of the federal govern
ment, federal organization and the efforts of the
government to undertake reconstructive

actions."
Williamson believes organizational issues
may require more attention in economic analy
sis. "A suggestion I have made recently that very
tentatively reflects some of my concerns is that
we have a council of economic advisors, but we
don't have a council of organizational advisors,"
Williamson said. "Organization is important,
but not factored in systematically. It's suscepti
ble to analysis, and most of the action resides in
the details."
With regard to his half of the monetary
award of the Nobel Prize half of the full
$1.44 million â€”Williamson hopes to use it
toward advancing higher education.
"I haven't actually engaged in discussions of
what I'm going to use the resources for, but I
think I will find ways mainly to use them to sup
port higher education," he said.
Williamson expressed an appreciation for
his time at Stanford, but also addressed the dif
ficulties facing the future of the economics field.
"I have great admiration for Stanford as a
first-class university," Williamson said. "It's had
a real impact on scholarship in the last 50 years
and more.
"I'm grateful for my Stanford education, for
the good colleagues I have had at Stanford," he
added. "I think we've all got challenges here
economic organization is still a nascent field. We
need to display value added. We've had some
success, but the challenges for the future are
vast."
