# Annual DUI statistics vary
## Most on-campus DUIs not given to students 
### JUSTIN COSTA-ROBERTS 
The Stanford Department of Public
Safety and the Office of Judicial Affairs
(OJA) have released statistics of on
campus driving under the influence
(DUI) incidents, giving a clearer picture
of the nature of drinking and driving on
the Farm.

The Police Department made 31
DUI arrests in 2008, seven of which
were Stanford students. This year,
there have already
been 49 incidents, 20
of which were stu
dent-related

In every year
since 1998, the
last year logged
in the police
report on DUI
incidences, most
of the individuals
arrested for drunk
driving have not been
students.

According to Deputy Eric
Fenton of the Stanford Police,
the majority of the people
arrested for DUIs were pass
ing through campus, often lost
or driving home from Palo Alto
bars. Even taking these cases
into account, however, the num
ber of drunk driving incidents
per 1,000 residents is generally

well below that of California as a whole,
and Fenton reports few on-campus
DUI-related accidents.

Easily the majority of student DUI
arrests occur on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday, with the early hours of Sunday
being the most common time. Only four
students over the past ten years have
been arrested for drunk driving on
Monday.

Student Cases
The OJA reports taking on 11 DUI
cases during the 2008-09 school year.
The year before that, they did not
have any DUI cases, although the
police did arrest several students
for DUIs.
Javier Alcala, supervising district
attorney (DA) in Palo Alto, sug
gests that the difference between
the figures of the OJA and the
police can be attributed to the Santa
Clara County DA Office, which
rejects some of the cases sent to it.
Once a student has been
arrested for DUI, the police
send the report to the Santa
Clara County DA. The DA
then decides whether to reject
the case or to charge the stu
dent. Before taking a case, the
DA office has to be certain it
can prove the individual was
both driving and impaired.
In some cases in which police

suspect drivers of driving under
the influence, laboratory results
come back with a blood alcohol
concentration low enough to bring
into question whether the driver
was actually impaired. By law, it is
assumed a driver is impaired if her
or his blood alcohol content
(BAC) is above 0.08. The DA can
still press charges if there is other
evidence that the driver was
impaired for example, if the
police witness the driver exhibiting
signs of intoxication.
The OJA can only proceed
through the judicial process when
there is sufficient evidence to do
so. Since it cannot access evidence
if the DA rejects a case, it follows
up on complaints only if the DA
presses charges.
The OJA would then investigate

the case, looking specifically for
whether the driver has violated the
Fundamental Standard. According
to Judicial Advisor Morris Graves,
this usually means assessing
whether the driver endangered the
physical safety of Stanford stu
dents, faculty or staff.
The number of student arrests
varies widely from year to year.
For instance, there were only seven
such arrests in 2001, but in 2003,
police recorded 29 incidents.
Fenton cautioned against
interpreting the number of stu
dents arrested for DUI per
annum as evidence that underly
ing drinking and driving patterns
have changed. He suggested that
the number of arrests made per
year would more accurately be
described as a function of the
police staffing levels. Because
most DUI arrests start as simple
traffic violations and only esca
late when an officer detects a
scent of alcohol in the vehicle, the
more police officers there are, the

more can be spared for patrolling
campus.
Since Stanford participates in
Federal Financial Aid Programs, it
is bound by the Clery Act to report
on-campus crimes in an Annual
Campus Security Report every
October. DUI reporting is pointed
ly omitted, however, by mandate:
The U.S. Department of
Education, the body that enforces
the Clery Act, puts out a
Flandbook for Campus Crime
Reporting that contains a list of
liquor law violations of which DUI
is not a part.

Liquor law violations include
underage possession, furnishing
liquor to minors and intemperates,
operating stills, bootlegging and
even using a vehicle for the illegal
transport of alcohol. It specifies,
however, that "drunkenness and
driving under the influence are not
Liquor Law Violations."
