# Annual DUI statistics vary
## Most on-campus DUIs not given to students 
### JUSTIN COSTA-ROBERTS 
The Stanford Department of Public
Safety and the Office of Judicial Affairs
(OJA) have released statistics of on
campus driving under the influence
(DUI) incidents, giving a clearer picture
of the nature of drinking and driving on
the Farm.

The Police Department made 31
DUI arrests in 2008, seven of which
were Stanford students. This year,
there have already
been 49 incidents, 20
of which were stu
dent-related

In every year
since 1998, the
last year logged
in the police
report on DUI
incidences, most
of the individuals
arrested for drunk
driving have not been
students.

According to Deputy Eric
Fenton of the Stanford Police,
the majority of the people
arrested for DUIs were pass
ing through campus, often lost
or driving home from Palo Alto
bars. Even taking these cases
into account, however, the num
ber of drunk driving incidents
per 1,000 residents is generally

well below that of California as a whole,
and Fenton reports few on-campus
DUI-related accidents.

Easily the majority of student DUI
arrests occur on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday, with the early hours of Sunday
being the most common time. Only four
students over the past ten years have
been arrested for drunk driving on
Monday.

Student Cases
The OJA reports taking on 11 DUI
cases during the 2008-09 school year.
The year before that, they did not
have any DUI cases, although the
police did arrest several students
for DUIs.
Javier Alcala, supervising district
attorney (DA) in Palo Alto, sug
gests that the difference between
the figures of the OJA and the
police can be attributed to the Santa
Clara County DA Office, which
rejects some of the cases sent to it.
Once a student has been
arrested for DUI, the police
send the report to the Santa
Clara County DA. The DA
then decides whether to reject
the case or to charge the stu
dent. Before taking a case, the
DA office has to be certain it
can prove the individual was
both driving and impaired.
In some cases in which police
