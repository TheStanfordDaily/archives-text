## Delhi schoolgirl's idea gets Stanford backing 
### CAROLINE CHEN 
Stanford researchers have been
inspired by a 15-year-old Delhi schoolgirl's
idea to invent a wristband that converts
the heartbeat into an electric current to
charge cell phones and have extended
$l,OOO to encourage further innovations.
Sarojini Mahajan, a class 9 student in
Meera Bagh in western New Delhi, sub
mitted her idea to IGNITE 2009, a nation
wide ideas contest for children currently in
its fourth year. IGNITE is organized by
the National Innovative Foundation (NIF)
in India, which was established by India's
Department of Science and Technology in
2000 and has the stated goal of creating
"an innovative and creative society and a
global leader in sustainable technologies."
Sarojini's idea, "Charging Mobiles
Using Human Pulse," was one of 15 that
won awards out of 1,344 entries. Her idea
is also the first of the competition entries
to garner attention from a major
American academic institution.

"The very thought of a reputed univer
sity like Stanford getting interested ... is a
very encouraging thing for [Sarojini] and
us," said Anil Gupta, executive vice chair
man of the Foundation. He added that
both Sarojini and her school, St. Mark's
Senior Secondary Public School in Meera
Bagh, were "very excited" about the news.
On a trip to India last summer, Paul
Kim, chief technology officer at Stanford's
School of Education, met Gupta. Upon
reading Sarojini's idea, he saw its potential
application for his goal of improving edu
cation in developing countries.
Kim is the leader of educational
research for Stanford's Programmable
Open Mobile Internet (POMI).
His team has already developed mobile
electronic books that they give to children

who do not have access to education.
These books provide educational material
in the children's native language and even
read aloud to the children, since many of
those children's parents are illiterate.
However, Kim has struggled to find a
good way to charge the books. He has in
the past tried hand cranks, solar cells, wind
mills and water power and has even found
away to modify a bicycle so it charges an
e-book while the rider pedals.
Kim said Sarojini's idea had significant
potential due to the worldwide frequency
and distribution of cell phones. Kim said
that out of 6.7 billion people in the world,
4.1 billion have cell phones and half of all
cell phone users live in the developing
world.
Kim wants more than one idea, howev
er, and so POMI has provided $l,OOO for
the NIF to run a new competition. The
Foundation is going around from district
to district, asking children for ideas to
charge a mobile learning device. The
objective, Kim said, is to "have fun while
playing and simultaneously charge a learn
ing device."
The $l,OOO will be used as prize money
and distributed among several winners.
Kim hopes that this will help the children
stay in school.
"In India, many parents do not send
kids to school so they can work at home,"
Kim said. "But all they need is $1 a day to
go to school."
By the end of the year, Kim and Gupta
hope to have gathered two or three thou
sand ideas. From there, Stanford hopes to
develop a charging method that will be
more accessible to children around the
world.
