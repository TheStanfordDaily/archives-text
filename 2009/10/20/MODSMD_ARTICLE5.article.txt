## PROFESSORS OF SUMMER A 						look at what professors are doing outside of the classroom 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI 
Yesterday's rain makes summer seem far away, but some
Stanford professors are still going strong off of academic
momentum gained during those sacred vacation days. This
article is part one of an exploration of the summer lives of
Stanford faculty.

Condoleezza Rice
Condoleezza Rice, who is teaching this quarter at the Graduate
School of Business and working at the Hoover Institution, spent a sig
nificant portion of her summer writing.
"I'm writing two books, one book about the last eight years, a poli
cy memoir," she explained. "And then I'm writing a book about my
parents. People say, 'How did you become who you are?' and it's all
about my parents."
Rice described her writing as a systematic process. "The thing about
writing is that you have to treat it like a job," said the former Secretary
of State. "You can't say, 'l'm going to wait for inspiration,' or 'l'm going
to think more about how to do this.' It doesn't get written until you
start writing.
"So I've always adopted a strategy, going all the way back to when
I was doing my dissertation in graduate school, of writing for a certain
number of hours every day," she continued. "So that's what I do. I just
write for four or five hours every day."
Rice also got to enjoy time playing chamber music at a music camp,
something she hasn't been able to do in eight years.
"Every summer, I used to go to music camp where I would play
with my chamber group, and we would be trained and coached by this
professional quartet the Miro String Quartet from Boston," Rice
recalled.
Rice was also involved in a Miro Quartet charity program called
Classics for Kids. "They put musical instruments in the schools," she
said. "I performed with them for a benefit concert. That was great
fun."
After coming back from music camp, Rice devoted time to working
on her books. She began a routine: Wake up at 5:30 a.m., exercise, write
for four to five hours, go to the office and perhaps finish up with a
round of golf.
"I had a really nice summer," she said. "At the end of the summer,
I went to visit friends in Tahoe for three or four days, a group of
women that I always do vacation with."
For Rice, it was one pivotal summer when she decided to pursue a
major outside of piano performance, changing the trajectory of her
career and leading her to where she is today.
"I've never operated my life on a five-year plan. Never. Only on a
one-year plan," she said.

After she finishes her books. Rice
plans to analyze the global state of
democracy. "No one would argue
that people aren't ready for democ
racy," she said, "though I want to
explore that in a more systematic
way as a political scientist."
Robert McGinn
For Robert McGinn, director of
the Science Technology & Society
(STS) program and professor of both
STS and management science and
engineering (MS&E), summer was a
time spent working on articles relat
ed to the ethics of nanotechnology
for the National Nanotechnology
Infrastructure Network (NNIN).
But McGinn also took time to

pursue hobbies, such as cycling. "I'm
very much into bike riding these
days," McGinn said. "One of the
things I do almost every week is to
ride my bike down to the Caltrain
station, and then go to San Francisco
and ride around the city on my bike
and visit various friends."
McGinn also spent a few weeks
visiting friends in Vermont and
Manhattan. His time in Vermont
was filled with kayaking, sail boat
ing, hiking, golfing and other out
door ventures.
In New York City, McGinn
immersed himself in the arts. "I had
a chance to go to the Lincoln Center
to a performance of Haydn's
'Creation,' which is a spectacular
piece of music," he said.
He also visited some four or five
museums, such as the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. "I had the pleasure
there of seeing a stunning exhibition
of Afghan cultural artifacts from the
time of Alexander the Great to the
20th century," he explained.

Another highlight of New York
was an Italian delicatessen called
Dipalo. "It was astonishing, not only
the array of goodies in the store,
wines, cheeses, pastas, but it was also
the quality of service," he said.

But when McGinn returned to
campus, his academics became pri
ority number one. His research in
the summer dovetails well with his
teaching during the academic year.
"A lot of my research has come out
of my teaching," he said. "A book that
I wrote and my articles were some of
the things that came out of discussions
in class and seminars, which after
wards I reflect on and think, 'That's
worth putting down on paper.'
"Teaching and research can fer
tilize one another," he added. "It's
nice when they can be synergistic."

Part two of this story will run in
tomorrow's issue of The Daily.
