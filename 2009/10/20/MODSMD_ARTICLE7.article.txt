## STAMP OF RECOGNITION NPR features segment of STAMP project, "Out of Sight, Out of Mind" 
### MIRANDA SIMON 
It all started with a massive vir
tual catharsis across campus.
At their request, dozens of
anonymous e-mails on depres
sion, anxiety and outright exis
tential crises began flooding the
inboxes of the Stanford Theatre
Activist Mobilization Project
(STAMP) theatre troupe, ready to
be tweaked and turned into mono
logues the whole campus could
hear.
"I imagine depression feels dif
ferent for different people," one of
the e-mails read. "For me, it felt like
an elephant was sitting on my chest,
constricting my heart, and I could
barely breathe."
"Who overeats like a dumb ani
mal and then has to vomit because
they have no self-restraint? Me,
apparently. It's embarrassing,"
another said.
The project, "Out of Sight, Out of
Mind" was the brainchild of
Amanda Gelender 'lO.
"People who have mental illness
es don't feel very comfortable talk
ing about it openly, and a lot of them
don't know where to get help," she
said. "On the flipside, a lot of people
who are in the dorms are complicit
in creating an atmosphere that's
very hostile to people with mental
illness, inadvertently. We really want
to show everyone that people with
mental illness are all over campus.
And they're struggling and thriving,

and their stories are of great impor
tance to all of us."
When STAMP conceived the
idea of collecting real life stories
about mental health on campus
issues so precarious that students
are uncomfortable sharing even
with their best friends they didn't
think they would get very far.
It was different from anything
they had ever taken on in their two
years of existence. STAMP works
with many student groups such as
FACE AIDS, the Muslim Student
Awareness Network (MSAN) and
Blackstage, presenting global and
national issues through theatre,
using the University as their arena.
This time, they decided to do
some navel-gazing instead and, as it
turns out, their audience was bigger
than ever.
"It didn't seem like a big deal in
the beginning until we started see
ing the number of people that were
being moved by it, " recalled Liesl
Spitz 'll, one of directors and pro
ducers of "Out of Sight, Out of
Mind."
On Monday, at 8:40 a.m., a year
later, seven of them are huddled
around a portable radio with a
paper bag full of bagels, waiting for
the National Public Radio to air a
segment on their production smack
in the middle of the Morning
Edition.
All conversation is postponed for
eight and a half minutes, conceding
complete silence to Deborah

Franklin's broadcast-perfect voice
and her interview with Gelender.

"We're absolutely thrilled that
NPR covered our project,"
Gelender said. "We thought they did
so responsibly and that they did so
comprehensibly.
"I specifically was covered as
someone who had bipolar disorder
and as someone who covered
STAMP And on both fronts, I was
very pleased with how the project
was represented," she added.
Spitz was surprised by the public
ity.
"Apparently we are taking on a
larger issue," Spitz said, as if she had
just realized the actual scope of the
production she directed.
Franklin brought in Dr. Daniel
Eisenberg from the University of
Michigan and threw in a few other
figures more than twice as many
students are on psychiatric medica
tions as were a decade ago, and
there has been a 50 percent increase
in the diagnosis of depression.
Stanford increased its staff from 10
to 16 therapists in just the last year.
"I think it's important that it's
getting national attention because
then, hopefully, students from other
colleges could help fellow students
in the same way," Spitz said.
"We'll be on international news
soon; BBC is going cover it, you
know?" she added.
