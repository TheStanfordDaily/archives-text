## OP-ED A 						Carnivore's Dilemma 
### BRIAN WONG Class of 2012 
The following was an assignment submitted
for the Sophomore College course Food and
Politics.

Remember when you found out what
meat really was? I was 6 when my par
ents finally broke the terrible truth to
me, and I still remember that moment to this
day. Utterly disgusted and horrified, the sym
pathetic, animal-loving kid in me decided to
go vegetarian. It's sad how long I lasted.
I'll never forget those two long days of
torture. No meat! My stomach missed it. My
taste buds missed it. I missed it. So, I stopped
feeling sorry for the animals, got over my
crushed spirit and gave my body what it
craved thus ended my first venture into
ethical consumerism.
Here I am today, still happily eating my
meat. I still haven't reconciled my 6-year-old
conscience with my insatiable carnivorous
appetite, but recently I've discovered some
thing else that makes me even sicker to my
stomach.
The sixteen-ounce rib-eye steak on my
plate has been bought at a terrible price; 60
percent of U.S. grain goes to feed the live
stock industry while the impoverished in
third-world countries starve. The health con
ditions that our livestock live in are even
more disgusting.
According to prolific food writer Michael
Pollan, cattle being fed for slaughter can
hardly live on industrial feedlots for five
months without suffocating from bloating of
the rumen or dying of liver disease. Other an
imals suffer similar health issues on Concen
trated Animal Feeding Operations. As a re
sult, the entire livestock industry uses up 70
percent of the antibiotics produced in the
U.S.

And don't forget the manure; U.S. feed
lots produce 300 million tons of it a year,
stressing local water quality levels to "their

tipping point. Here's an interesting fact: As a
whole, the livestock industry contributes
more to climate change than all the carbon
emissions from cars.
The consumption of meat in the U.S. is, by
all accounts, unsustainable, and each of us
should do all we can to limit our own.
I'm compelled. Right now, I'm trying out
being semi-vegetarian, skipping out on all
red meat. No steak, no hamburgers and no
hot dogs. I've been going strong for a month
so far, and if I'm able to make it another
week without it, I'll try ditching meat alto
gether. Why? Because I've realized how my
eating habits directly affect other people,
and I'm more than willing to sacrifice a little
gustatory pleasure and cultural bravado for
some peace of mind and a healthier diet.
Are you?
If you're still skeptical about the effect
you can have, there's only one thing left for
you to do: Try it. Try giving up red meat for
just a week, and see what happens. At the
very least, ask your dining hall to find small
er local farms to buy from that raise their
livestock sustainably and feed them grass in
stead of artificial corn and vitamin soup
many of our dining halls already do.
Try, because ultimately, our actions inside
or out of the marketplace speak louder than
our words. If nothing else, I promise you'll
have gained a greater appreciation for the
steep costs of our food economy by question
ing the processes that brought your meat to
you.

Be an ethical consumer. Be empowered
knowing how your food choices directly af
fect people around the world. And when you
start feeling like I did when I found out what
meat was, go ahead and do something about
it even if for only a few days.
