# A 						BROAD ABROAD
## Always Coming Back Home to You 
### Molly Spaeth 
You probably don't remember be
lieve me, I do but during Freshman
Convocation for the Class of 2011,
President Hennessy proclaimed, "I am proud
to announce that this year, we are welcoming
students from all 50 states. This year, I am
happy to say, we even have representatives
from the state of North Dakota!"
You're welcome, President Hennessy. Al
ways my pleasure to help fulfill the quota.
But seriously, my mom and I gasped,
screamed and practically fell out of our seats,
we were so proud. I think my grandma still
talks about it.
Unless you're from the Midwest north of
lowa, you can't comprehend 7-year-olds
wearing snow pants under Sleeping Beauty
costumes for Halloween, nor can you under
stand what it feels like to have minus 50-de
gree wind chills during Christmas. You don't
know what it's like to have to sit in your car
for half an hour after basketball practice
waiting for your gear to unthaw so you can
drive the 10 minutes home, nor do you have
neighbors who drive around with chains in
their trucks during blizzards, solely to help
pull people with stalled cars out of snow
drifts. But perhaps most importantly, you
don't understand what it really means to be
Midwestern.
0.K., I'll admit it. I love California. God
forbid I admit this to any openly, California
born-and-raised resident, lest I resign myself
to the 15-minute tirade on the perfect beach
es of San Diego or the inherent Utopian
essence that really just emanates from every
square foot of Pasadena. I love California
and I love Californians, but if I could fault
them one thing, it's a blatant lack of interest
in living anywhere else other than, well, Cali
fornia.
Last spring break, my homegrown city of
Fargo, N.D. was under attack by the Red
River. After one of the hardest winters North
Dakota had seen in a long time, the raging
waters of the Red River were cresting at up
ward of 40 feet and were threatening to de
stroy my city, my people and the Midwestern
spirit.
As the flood raged on, I was enjoying my
spring break in, where else? Sunny San
Diego, lolling around on the beach and being
pampered in some of the gorgeous abodes of
my California friends. I hopped around to
some great restaurants, took in more sun in
one day than I'd take in all month in March in
North Dakota and frolicked across the beach
outside my four-star hotel.
After an abruptly-ended, cross-country
call with my mom one night during the flood,
I huddled under the covers in my friend's
bedroom in Newport Beach, clicking
through the articles on CNN. As I stumbled
across an article written by Bob Greene on
the situation in Fargo, I almost started to cry
when I realized how much I would trade my
Utopian Southern California Adventure for
the opportunity to put just one more sandbag
on top of the dike keeping my city afloat.

"Even if the river overflows its banks to an
extent and for a duration never before seen in
Fargo, the things that truly matter in town will
not be destroyed. Once in a great while, a com
munity has the opportunity to understand
anew what that word 'community' real
ly means; once in a while, a town defines itself
as a town. In the community of Fargo this past
week, as the residents have worked shoulder
to shoulder to fight the river, they have learned
the meaning of [community] all over again.
But of course, being from Fargo, they never re
ally forgot."
My brother was skipping school and
meals so he could spend 12 hours a day sand
bagging in hopes that the river wouldn't rise
faster than he could shovel. My former co
workers were leaving work to go dig up a soc
cer field because increasing the height of the
dike was way more important than our spring
sports. And my friends from Minneapolis,
Minn, were leaving school in droves, bringing
along Midwestern and non-Midwestern
friends alike to help save our city.
As I sat alone in the bedroom in Newport
Beach during my perfect, sunny spring break,
I had never felt so guilty in my life.

A fellow Midwestern Stanford friend of
mine, Ellen Cerf, once said, "You may have
met your Minnesota quota, but I haven't met
mine."

The Midwestern folk may not be as rich,
they may not be as tan, and not all of them are
as well-educated as some of these beautiful
Californians, but the Midwest, in its never
ending cycle of frozen miracles and sticky
summers, is home to some of the hardest
working, compassionate and down-to-earth
people I have ever met. And California, al
though you may be a seductive "Utopia," I
figure it is best to tell you now, before we get
too involved, that I am, and always will be, a
Midwesterner at heart.

from her grandpa describing last night's casse
role and how much snow is currently on the
ground in Nordak. Save her bye-mailing pic
