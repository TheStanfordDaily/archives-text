# OPINIONS
## EDITORIAL For students, optimism in job market can still exist 
### 
Things are looking up. The economy is
showing signs of strength, and con
sumer and investor confidence are
slowly rebuilding. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose above 10,000 points for the first
time in a year, leading many market experts
to feel reassured by the market's ascendancy
above what was a seemingly elusive ceiling.
But, in many ways, we as Stanford students
shield ourselves from believing the good
news and allow immediate experiences to
shape our understanding. An RA from an old
dorm may relay his frustrations about being
unable to find a job with his desired pay scale.
Minutes later we see reports regarding the
highest national unemployment rates in 26
years and feel dismayed. Those driven to fur
ther research find the unemployment rate
among 16- to 25-year-olds is a staggering 25.9
percent. Coupled with our parents' worries
over tightened finances, these markers may
be enough to make us despondent regarding
our job and internship search.
But the Editorial Board believes it is ben
eficial to consider whether there is a growing
disconnect between how we perceive the re
cession and how it shows up in our daily lives.
At times we fail to see that the inundation of
our inboxes with job information sessions
and resume drops is a luxury. We forget the
sheer volume of firms and organizations who
actively recruit is nearly unmatched outside
of Ivy League-caliber institutions.
A number of great job resources for sen
iors are found at the CDC. Their traditional
interview and resume preparation is always
available, along with other initiatives like
nightly drop-in hours at 7 p.m. and the Stan
ford Alumni Mentoring program, which fa

cilitates relationships with alumni who are
driven by a strong desire to serve undergrad
uates. A more dedicated employment of the
Stanford Alumni database is also another
well-known but seldom undertaken strategy.
Another notion that recruiters, Career
Center employees and young Alumni seek to
communicate every year is the fact that a stu
dent's previous internship experience and
professional network are just as important, if
not more important than the major they
choose. This understanding can hopefully
lead underclassmen to continue to seek op
portunities throughout their undergraduate
careers with discipline and doggedness.
Many of us are gravely concerned with the
salary we can expect upon graduation. The
starting salaries for recent college graduates
have decreased slightly amid the economic
downturn. A 2009 Bachelor's Degree gradu
ate nabbed an average offer of $48,633, while
the same graduate a year before was offered
on average $49,224. Even so, keep in mind
that for many of the nation's millions of un
employed workers, simply having a salary of
forty grand or more does not even seem with
in their grasp.
We are privileged to attend an institution
that delivers resources within arms reach.
Not all jobs are available, but our prospects
for finding employment are very high. Se
niors are graduating into an economy better
than it was a year ago, and it is projected to
only get better. Salary is important, but find
ing a stable job in a career you enjoy is ex
tremely fulfilling. Where you go immediately
after Stanford does not determine your life's
path. Remain positive, take advantage of the
resources here and enjoy the year.
