# GET IT RIGHT
## Cookie Monster: Do not go gentle into that good night 
### Erica Morgan 
I would like to be completely upfront with
my readers for a moment, lest Daniel
Leifer accuse me of irresponsible jour
nalism. The poem I referenced in my title is a
famous work by Dylan Thomas. When, later
in the article, I refer to Sesame Street, I may
in fact draw basic info of Sesame Street? s ori
gins from Wikipedia. I assure you, however
that the opinions presented here are my
own, which is the important feature of a col
umn. Thanks for keeping me honest, Daniel.
To the point: I suffered a minor panic at
tack last week, when I heard it mentioned
that Cookie Monster, the simple yet lovable
connoisseur of culinary concoctions, had
been replaced by a ?Veggie Monster? on
Sesame Street. Horrified, I dashed to my
computer for confirmation. It transpired
that the claim was false. Happily, Cookie
Monster remains the lovable blue beast that
he was in my childhood days.
Or does he?
Further investigation yielded some dis
turbing information. While Cookie Monster
has not been replaced, his role on Sesame
Street has certainly undergone significant
changes. Most notably, the sacred song of
Cookie Monster is no longer: ?C is for Cook
ie, that?s good enough for me,? What is it
now, you ask? ?Cookies are a sometimes
food.? Updated Cookie Monster is educated
about moderation and now consumes a bal
anced diet of fruits and veggies.
Bemused, I sought answers for this radi
cal change in Monster?s eating behaviors.
Sesame Street? s Web site offers some insight,
advertising the fact that the show is now ?ad
dressing the need for nutrition and exercise
education.? There you have it. The popular
children?s show is caving in to the political
pressure to intervene in American dietary
habits. Labeling nutritional content is not
enough, banning trans fats in some restau
rants is not enough and the suggestion of a
?soda tax? to address the obesity epidemic is
not enough. Sesame Street will conquer
childhood obesity by dropping a silly song
and decreasing the Monster?s cookie calorie
intake.
Personally, I am sick of seeing my peers,
politicians and lobbyists of all kinds desper
ately seek a target to blame for the nutrition
al problems of the nation. Cancer due to
smoking can be handed off to tobacco com
panies. Eating disorders can be attributed to
models, actresses, fashion magazines, the
vegan movement... etc. The responsibility
for obesity is laid at the feet of fast food
restaurants, soda companies, dining halls,
high fructose corn syrup and now, apparent
ly, Cookie Monster?s gluttonous eating
habits.
In this warped world of finger pointing,

Americans have forgotten the simple fact
that we, as autonomous individuals, are ca
pable of modulating our on behaviors. Thus,
we bear personal responsibility for the
health decisions we make, I don?t have to
consume Big Macs just because McDon
ald?s provides them. Camel doesn?t compel
me to smoke! And Coca-Cola certainly
doesn?t hold me down and force-feed me
sugary delight. People who are obese are vic
tims of their own volition. Children who are
obese are the victims of irresponsible par
enting.
Seriously, how weak-minded are we as a
society that we believe a change in Cookie
Monster?s eating habits will have a signifi
cant influence on behavior? Will cookies be
any less appealing now that they?re no
longer good enough for Cookie Monster?
Will children leap off of the couch and run to
the fridge for a delicious celery stick in
stead? And, since I?ve mentioned the couch,
maybe parents should encourage kids to turn
off Sesame Street, jump off their obese bums
and engage in some exercise?
That would be too simple, not to mention
asking far too much of parents. Instead, soci
ety places trust in Sesame Street to educate
our children and bequeath upon them the in
formation necessary to form healthy habits,
as they sit, staring at the screen.
If this is to be the new trend behav
ioral manipulation through childhood enter
tainment I would like to point out a few
necessary changes. Disney movies must be
altered to promote healthy relationships. I
mean, we?re teaching children that the ways
to a man?s heart are silence ( Little Mer
maid) and to value things like superficial
beauty (see any princess movie), servitude
(■Cinderella ) and insipid femininity (Snow
White). HORROR. How can this be inflicted
on young minds? We must change these
characters to strong, intelligent, average
looking, loud feminists. Think Hillary Clin
ton.
Alternatively, we could accept personal
responsibility for the choices that we make.
We could encourage interactive parenting to
help children distinguish between healthy
and unhealthy choices. We could allow chil
dren, as we were allowed, to enjoy the simple
entertainment value of an unaltered, classic
Disney Movie and a cookie-hoarding, floppy
blue beast.
Policy-makers and lobbyists: Please stop
your fruitless efforts to manipulate me.
Focus your energy on something more im
portant like combating socialized health
care, for instance.
