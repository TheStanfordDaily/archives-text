# THE 						PENSIEVE
## Harry Potter and the Extreme Fountain-Hop

"As certainly as he had known that the doe
was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the
one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at
least taught Harry something about certain
kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of
certain acts."

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,
p. 373

We'd just like to say that for the
record, despite all the merits we
Stanford students possess, we are
not wizards. Sorry, magic-obsessed Muggles,
no matter how hard you wave your wand, the
Patronus thing just isn't happening. Al
though it is easy to malign a Muggle exis
tence, it could just be that the best way to sat
isfy our desire for magic is not to mourn what
we lack, but to fully embrace the notion that
magic is not restricted to whipping up po
tions or muttering incantations it is simply
that which we cannot explain by rational
means.
Harry is forced to come to terms with this
notion when he finds himself diving into an
icy cold pond to grab the sword of Godric
Gryffindor, necessary to destroy part of
Voldemort's soul. Rather than wielding the
sword himself, Harry is irrationally com
pelled to give Ron the privilege of the task.
Although there are no spells or magical de
vices to guide his decision, he recognizes that
beyond classroom knowledge, there are
other forms of magic that all humans possess.
We each have the capacity to draw from our
intimate knowledge of our feelings and emo
tions.
For Stanford students, reasoning is more
than second nature. From SATs and our actu
al decision to enroll at Stanford, to IHUM
and the countless decisions we find ourselves
faced with every day, we have all become
masters of pro-con lists and working to max
imize our returns. We like our plans, we pour
over our micromanaging to-do lists and we
follow our iCals and Google Calendars like

nifflers in search of gold. We have been
taught and fully believe that reasoning skills
are the ingredients to success. While there's
no denying that in many cases these skills are
nifty Portkeys to the next stages in our lives,
there are still times when those refined dis
cernment skills fall short, and we are left only
with an unexplainable strong "tug" in a cer
tain direction.
While some situations can be reasoned
through, others are much more vague and
filled with uncertainty. Knowing when to
have a tough conversation with a friend, de
ciding whether or not to take a year off, or

turning down an amazing opportunity to pur
sue something less academically worthwhile
are all acts contingent on the seemingly irra
tional "tug" we feel to go through with them.
As rational, independent thinkers, these
"tugs" may seem frightening, as no technical
vocabulary or reasoning can properly justify
them. After all, what kind of person substan
tiates acts lending to such grand implications
with a mere "I felt like it?" Somehow we lose
touch with, and begin to doubt the power of
the magic of "incalculable acts" with which
we have been endowed.
It is precisely this magic that Harry uses to
defeat Lord Voldemort. The steps he takes
throughout his quest are not always based on
the logical path so often asserted by his
clever friend Hermione, He recognizes that
there is a reason why he feels so compelled to
take on certain acts because that is what
he is somehow meant to do. Hence, casting
aside what seems to be the pending doom of
the uncertain, he is able to move confidently
and deliberately forward in his mission based
on what he innately knows must be done.
Utilizing this brand of magic, he ultimately
defeats Lord Voldemort and catalyzes a
process of growth and empowerment for
those around him, in this instance, Ron.
Therefore, it is our challenge to also attune
ourselves to these magical murmurings with
in and to plunge headfirst into the immediate
unknown with assurance that our internal
compasses, in the end, will have gotten it
right.
Of course, we could also take a leaf out of
Harry's book and plunge headfirst into a
pond in the dead of winter. Then again, we're
not sure if Extreme Fountain-Hopping fits
under Dumbledore's description of worth
while "incalculable acts."
