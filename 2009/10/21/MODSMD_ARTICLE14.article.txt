## REVERSAL OF FORTUNE 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
A
m m fter a pair of stunning losses
against Oregon State and Arizona, the Stan
ford football team's (4-3, 3-2 Pac-10) mo
mentum which just a few weeks ago had
them peeking into the top 25 in the
ESPN.com Power Ranking poll and en
route to a bowl berth seems to be dissi
pating.
In last week's game against Arizona, the
Cardinal's redshirt freshman quarterback
Andrew Luck threw for a career-high 423
yards and 3 touchdowns, but the Wildcats
were equally prolific, with their QB Nick
Foles tallying 415 yards and 3 touchdowns.
The big numbers on offense, however, high
light the ineffectiveness of the defenses. Ac
cording to Bet Us.com, "Stanford's defense
had absolutely no answer for anything that
Arizona was throwing at it."
This isn't the first time the Card has start
ed out ahead and fallen behind.
In the 1997 season, under head coach Ty
rone Willingham, Stanford started out 4-1,
2-0 Pac-10, with victories over San Jose
State, Oregon State, Oregon and Notre
Dame. It went on to lose its next five games,
finishing the season 5-6,3-5 Pac-10, one win
short of a bowl berth.
In the 2004 season, under head coach
Buddy Teevens, the Cardinal opened the
season 3-1,1-1 Pac-10, their only loss dealt
by USC, who was the Associated Press' No.
1 team for the duration of the season and
later went on to defeat Oklahoma for the
BCS Championship. The Card then conced
ed the final five games of the regular season,
including a 21-0 shut out at the hands of
UCLA and a 41-6 Big Loss at Cal.
It's also gone the other way a few times.
In the 2007 season, new head coach Jim

Harbaugh inherited a crumbling football
program, one that had just come off a 1-11,
1-8 Pac-10 season. Harbaugh infused some
much-needed hope and determination into
the team, which ended the season with a
vastly improved 4-8,3-6 Pac-10 record.
He also engineered what is, quite possi
bly, the biggest upset in Stanford football
history. In 2007, No. 2 USC was the clear fa
vorite, favored by 41 points in the matchup
at the Coliseum. Then-redshirt sophomore
quarterback Tavita Pritchard connected
with a leaping Mark Bradford in the Trojan
end zone with 49 seconds remaining in the
fourth, securing a 24-23 victory. The Trojans
shut out the Cardinal in the first half 9-0 and
maintained the lead until well into the
fourth; in fact, the Cardinal had not led at
any point until the final touchdown.
But Harbaugh hadn't doubted his team
at all. "I knew he'd come through," he said of
Pritchard, following the game.

Perhaps it is natural that Coach Har
baugh, nicknamed "Captain Comeback"
(the second player to be named so, after
Roger Staubach) for leading the Indianapo
lis Colts in a pair of comebacks over the
Kansas City Chiefs and San Diego Chargers
in the 1995 AFC playoffs, is so set on the
turnaround this year. He's good at it.
"The thing we're looking for and we're
all learning this together, is how to get over
the 'hump,'" Harbaugh said Tuesday at a
media luncheon. "There's a learning process
that's going on, players and coaches looking
at themselves and what can we do better."
That seems to be what differentiates this
Stanford team from previous years' teams:
They're showing a real commitment to ad
mitting their mistakes, to learning and im
proving and to believing in themselves.
"We just weren't playing consistently,"
said senior linebacker Clint Snyder. "All of
their plays were from little mistakes where

people weren't doing what they were sup
posed to do or trying to do too much. I made
a lot of mistakes. On the second-to-last
touchdown, I spun out of the gap. That was
my gap to cover. You can't have that and ex
pect to win football games. I was trying to do
too much."

"But," he added, "you can't stay on any
loss or any win for too long. You've got to
move on to the next game. And that's what
we're doing."

Senior offensive tackle Allen Smith was
also looking forward to this week's matchup:
"I feel like we're very close [to beating a
good team]. The coaches talk to us about
turning the corner, getting over the 'hump'.
It's being confident, no matter what situa
tion you're in, that you'll pull it out and win .
.. and right now that's just practices away."
