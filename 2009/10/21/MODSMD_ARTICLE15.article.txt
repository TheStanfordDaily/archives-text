# There's no place like home

Home field advantage is a
peculiar thing. It is gener
ally accepted that home
field advantage is, in fact,
an advantage. The teams with the
best records in the regular season
get to play at home during the play
offs. The home field goal kicker
knows how the wind will affect his
kick. The home outfielder knows
how a fly ball will bounce off a wall.
Yet, sports is also filled with hun
dreds of examples where playing at
home seems more like a curse than a
benefit.

Just don't tell that to Stanford
athletes.

This year, not one Stanford
sports team has lost at home.
Read that line again and think
about it for a second. Every game,
every match, every meet played
here on The Farm, the Cardinal has
been victorious (save for one tie).

Football is 3-0 at home. Men's
water polo is 7-0 at home. Women's
soccer is 7-0 at home. Field hockey is
5-0 at home. Women's volleyball is
4-0 at home. Men's soccer is 5-0-1 at
home.

The first question is how is this
possible? I have no idea.

Let's start with football. Stanford
Stadium is not Happy Valley (Penn
State) or Death Valley (LSU). Stan
ford Stadium is quiet valley.
So quiet that University of Wash
ington head coach Steve Sarkisian
actually turned off the sound in the
Huskies' practice stadium prior to
playing at Stanford. Imagine that, a
team actually preparing for silence.

How did the Axe Committee, the
group of students responsible for
firing up the crowd, respond? By
handing out sheets to Red Zone
members instructing them when to
and when not to yell. (Hint: when
the Cardinal is on defense make
noise. When the Cardinal is offense,
don't.)
Maybe this campus's lack of
school spirit actually doubles as a
home field advantage, but I find it
difficult to believe that opposing
teams get weak in the knees think
ing of the empty seats and quiet
chants awaiting them at Stanford
Stadium.
The same applies to water polo.
Avery Aquatic Center is the pre
mier pool in the nation, regularly
hosting the national championships.
Except for 15 or so KA members
and a few parents though, Avery
usually welcomes opponents with
minimal fanfare.
The same is true of Laird Q.
Cagan Stadium, home to men and
women's soccer. Great field, great
facilities, but not always a lot of

crowd noise.

If it's not for a boisterous crowd,
then why is Stanford undefeated at
home? The only possible explana
tion, aside from the unblemished
mark being a statistical oddity, is
road weariness and routine.
Against Wake Forest, Stanford
football led 17-3 at halftime. 21
unanswered points later, the Cardi
nal suffered its first lost of the sea
son. It's possible that the transconti
nental flight, in which players were
not allowed to sleep, finally caught
up with Stanford in the fourth.
Against Oregon State, Stanford
never got off the ground running,
trailing 14-0 after the first quarter
and 31-7 at the break. After three
straight home games, could it be the
Cardinal was a little out of whack
having to break its pre-home game
routine?
Or maybe it's best not to analyze
the perfect record and just appreci
ate the high quality of play at home.

In the immortal words of Crash
Davis from the movie Bull Durham:
"A player on a streak has to re
spect the streak. If you believe
you're playing well because you're
getting laid, or because you're not
getting laid, or because you wear
women's underwear, then you are!"
So, Stanford athletes, don't
change a thing. If you failed a
midterm the day of a big game,
sorry, but for now you're going to
have to do your best not to study.
You pull an all-nighter before a
game? Well, get your caffeine pills
ready because you got a long a night
ahead of you.
You got something special going
on here. Whatever you're doing, it's
working. We're all just along for the
ride.
