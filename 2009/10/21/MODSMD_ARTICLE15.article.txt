# There's no place like home

Home field advantage is a
peculiar thing. It is gener
ally accepted that home
field advantage is, in fact,
an advantage. The teams with the
best records in the regular season
get to play at home during the play
offs. The home field goal kicker
knows how the wind will affect his
kick. The home outfielder knows
how a fly ball will bounce off a wall.
Yet, sports is also filled with hun
dreds of examples where playing at
home seems more like a curse than a
benefit.

Just don't tell that to Stanford
athletes.

This year, not one Stanford
sports team has lost at home.
Read that line again and think
about it for a second. Every game,
every match, every meet played
here on The Farm, the Cardinal has
been victorious (save for one tie).

Football is 3-0 at home. Men's
water polo is 7-0 at home. Women's
soccer is 7-0 at home. Field hockey is
5-0 at home. Women's volleyball is
4-0 at home. Men's soccer is 5-0-1 at
home.

The first question is how is this
possible? I have no idea.

Let's start with football. Stanford
Stadium is not Happy Valley (Penn
State) or Death Valley (LSU). Stan
ford Stadium is quiet valley.
So quiet that University of Wash
ington head coach Steve Sarkisian
actually turned off the sound in the
Huskies' practice stadium prior to
playing at Stanford. Imagine that, a
team actually preparing for silence.

How did the Axe Committee, the
group of students responsible for
firing up the crowd, respond? By
handing out sheets to Red Zone
members instructing them when to
and when not to yell. (Hint: when
the Cardinal is on defense make
noise. When the Cardinal is offense,
don't.)
