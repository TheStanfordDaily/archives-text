# Too much tennis for pros
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
Tennis is one of the few pro
fessional sports that is seem
ingly always in season. Play
ers compete in tournaments
from January all the way through
mid-November, leaving only a short,
six-week offseason for players to re
cover and train before jumping back
into the fray. Competing for almost
eleven months per year is an insane
burden on tennis professionals and
the tennis season needs to be short
ened, both for the health of the play
ers and for the success of the sport.
There are disparities in season
length between collegiate and pro
fessional athletics in virtually all
sports. This system makes sense; col
lege athletes are also students and
must devote time to both academics
and athletics. Professional athletes
have no other job than to train and
compete; thus, they compete for a
longer period of time. However,
these disparities are at their peak in
tennis.

For example, college football
teams play a 12 to 14-game season,
while NFL teams play 16 to 20 games
(including bowls and playoffs). The
NFL regular season extends only for
an extra month beyond the college
football season.

Other sports have reasonable dif
ferences in season length. Baseball
has a two month disparity between
college and the major leagues; men's
basketball has a similar difference.

In tennis, however, there is a much
more significant difference between
collegiate and professional seasons.
