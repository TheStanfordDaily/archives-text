# Too much tennis for pros
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
Tennis is one of the few pro
fessional sports that is seem
ingly always in season. Play
ers compete in tournaments
from January all the way through
mid-November, leaving only a short,
six-week offseason for players to re
cover and train before jumping back
into the fray. Competing for almost
eleven months per year is an insane
burden on tennis professionals and
the tennis season needs to be short
ened, both for the health of the play
ers and for the success of the sport.
There are disparities in season
length between collegiate and pro
fessional athletics in virtually all
sports. This system makes sense; col
lege athletes are also students and
must devote time to both academics
and athletics. Professional athletes
have no other job than to train and
compete; thus, they compete for a
longer period of time. However,
these disparities are at their peak in
tennis.

For example, college football
teams play a 12 to 14-game season,
while NFL teams play 16 to 20 games
(including bowls and playoffs). The
NFL regular season extends only for
an extra month beyond the college
football season.

Other sports have reasonable dif
ferences in season length. Baseball
has a two month disparity between
college and the major leagues; men's
basketball has a similar difference.

In tennis, however, there is a much
more significant difference between
collegiate and professional seasons.
Stanford's men's tennis team com
petes from January through May;
that fact means that there is more
than 5-month gap between the col
lege and pro seasons.
Sam Ecker, a freshman on the
Stanford men's tennis team, agreed
that the professional tennis season is
excessive.

"I would say it probably is [too long],
just because they play a ton of tour
naments every year," Ecker said.
"It's especially long for the top play
ers; they play five or six matches
every tournament and 20 or 25 tour
naments a year [although players
aren't compelled to play every tour
nament], which means they can play
a hundred matches in a year."
The excessive playing schedule
not only hurts the players; it also
damages the health of the sport as a
whole. For all but the most dedicated
fans, tennis comes into the public's
general view four times a year, dur
ing the Grand Slam tournaments:
the Australian Open, the French
Open, Wimbledon and the U.S.
Open. With the conclusion of the
U.S. Open, the last Grand Slam, in
mid-September, tennis more or less
fades until the Australian Open
starts the new season in January.

Thus, having such a long season
places extra strain on the players
while accomplishing no clear pur
pose in expanding the sport's profile
and viewership.
The long season also has had a
very obvious negative effect on one
of the sport's most high-profile male
stars, Rafael Nadal of Spain. Nadal
has won the Australian and French
Opens as well as Wimbledon and
came close to completing a career
Grand Slam this year at the U.S.
Open, losing in the semi-finals.
Nadal employs an aggressive, corpo
real style of play, which, while im
mensely entertaining to watch, is in
credibly physically punishing.
The length of the season com
bined with Nadal's playing style
makes him susceptible to simply run
out of energy and destroy his body as
the season wears on. Prior to this sea
son, Nadal had never progressed
into the semifinals of the U.S. Open:
by that point in the season, he was
basically gassed. Nadal also was
forced to miss Wimbledon this year
due to injuries, caused by the wear
ing down of his body. These injuries
also went a long way toward explain
ing his fourth-round exit from the
French Open.
When one of a sport's most dy
namic, elite players can't keep up
with the schedule, it's clearly time to
make a change.
To that end, the ATP and WTA

need to shorten their yearly sched
ules, to reduce the pounding that ath
letes take and to provide a longer
offseason for training and recovery.
The schedule needs to be oriented
around the four Grand Slam events;
ideally, the Australian Open would
start the season and the U.S. Open
would end it.
Making such a change would
have profound benefits for the sport.
It would make for more exciting and
entertaining matches, since athletes
wouldn't constantly be contending
with exhaustion and minor injuries.
Better-rested athletes could also
lead to a breakup of the stratified
structure of tennis, which is currently
dominated by a small group of top
players. Matches would no longer be
determined heavily on the basis of
which player has greater endurance
and athleticism to simply grind it out
and thus lesser-known players would
have opportunities to break into the
spotlight.
Shortening the season isn't neces
sarily imperative to the future of ten
nis; however, it could do a great deal
to improve the welfare of profes
sional tennis players and, for that
reason alone, it should be imple
mented.
