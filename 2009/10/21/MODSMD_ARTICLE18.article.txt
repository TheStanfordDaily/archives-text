## Odwalla founder shares life lessons Alumnus returns to push entrepreneurship 
### TIM JACONETTE 
Hungry and broke, Greg
Steltenpohl '77 first started
Odwalla in 1980. Through the first
year, he worked constantly to grow
his fruit juice company he said
he "didn't have a single day off" in
the early years.
Showing photos of his shed in
Santa Cruz where the company
first operated, Steltenpohl said he
started his company by borrowing
$2OO from his girlfriend to buy a
hand squeezer and box of oranges.
An environmental studies major
at the Farm, Steltenpohl shared his
history of starting new ventures
and tips for up-and-coming entre
preneurs last night at the Stanford
Career Development Center.
"The reality is, when you go out
there, it's very easy to start a busi
ness in the United States." But the
challenge, he said, is growing the
business.
He also described his own com
pany's laid-back origins. "I wanted
to call the company Jedi Juice," he
said. In order to be part of the orig
inal Odwalla, he joked that "you
had to be a musician and have a
Volkswagen van."
Steltenpohl explained that now,
as he starts his latest venture, he is
once again generating new
accounts by pounding the pave
ment as a salesperson. His new
company, Adina, focuses on bever
ages with less sugar than products
currently on the market.
SteltenpohPs experiences were
a departure from the many tech
nology start-ups commonly associ
ated with Stanford alumni, said
CDC Student Business Adviser
Dilys Sun 'lO.
"We want students to see oppor
tunities in entrepreneurship that
are not necessarily high-tech," Sun
said.
Students drew inspiration from
Steltenpohl's story.
"It's only $200," said manage
ment science and engineering grad

uate student Sergei Chevtsov 'll.
"Right now, with $2OO, you can
start nothing."
Eva Orbuch 'll was impressed
with Steltenpohl's continued vision
and drive. "After he has gone
through the whole corporate
world, he's still an idealist, and
that's nice to see," she said.
Following a question and
answer session, Steltenpohl, still

the enthusiastic salesman, passed
out hats, beverages and coupons
for his new Adina beverage ven
ture.
The talk was co-sponsored by
the CDC and Business Association
of Stanford Entrepreneurial
Students (BASES).
