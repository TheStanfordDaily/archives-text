### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
After two years of study, the
University unveiled a $250 million.

10-year initiative to combat global
climate change and reduce
Stanford's emissions and energy
consumption.
By 2020, the Energy and Climate
Plan, first presented to the Board of
Trustees on Oct. 12, aims to cut
down greenhouse gas emissions to
20 percent below 1990 levels a
target far above the requirements
set by California's Global Warming
Solutions Act.

Stanford's 20 percent goal is also
among the highest of national uni
versities.
The plan, now in the detailed
design stage, includes major modifi
cations to building heating and cool
ing systems, a transformation of the
campus energy plant and explo
ration of renewable electricity tech
nologies. Alongside these efforts will
be an education component to
reduce individual energy usage.
