## Law prof, simplifies tax returns CA State 'ReadyReturn' program proposed in D.C. 
### EVELYN KELLEY 
Stanford Law Professor Joseph
Bankman recently travelled to
Washington, D.C. to present his proposal
for tax simplification to the President's
Economic Recovery Advisory Board
(PERAB).
Bankman is proposing the use of
"Readyßeturn," a service that simplifies
tax returns by presenting users with a
pre-filled tax return based on informa
tion from previous years. Readyßeturn
has been available free of charge to eligi
ble residents in the state of California
since 2007, following an initial pilot pro
gram in 2004.
On Oct. 16, Bankman presented his
program to the PERAB as a model for a
possible national-level tax return
process. While Obama had previously
endorsed a similar plan by PERAB's
chief economist and staff director
Austan Goolsbee, Bankman styled his
program as a slightly more conservative
approach that may have a higher chance
of being enacted.
Bankman presented a variant of this
program to the Bush Administration in
2005, but he hopes to find more support
under the new leadership.
The program could reduce stress con
cerning taxes, not by simplifying the code
but by providing a straightforward,
immediate interaction with the govern
ment. According to Bankman,
Readyßeturn uses information the gov
ernment already has on file, thus pre
venting error and cutting down on the
$3O billion that individual-wage earners
spend per year filing their taxes, accord
ing to Bankman.
Users may still make changes to the
Readyßeturn estimate, but user feed
back has been positive.
Intuit, which manufactures the widely
used tax software Turbo Tax, is a center
of opposition. Their concerns focus on
the possibility of mistakes that the IRS
can make with some of the information.
Bankman, however, dismisses this
criticism.
"The mistakes turn out to be awfully
low and taxpayers really love the pro
gram," he said. Between the years 2007
and 2008 the amount of users have quin
tupled.
But Mary Morrison, a financial aid
officer, believes that although
Readyßeturn simplifies the actual filing
process, the program does not address
the root of people's anxiety.
"People have no comprehension of
why certain amounts are taken from
their pay," she said. "They don't know
what W-2 forms are. They don't know if
and when they should file. This form
won't solve that."
Besides difficulties with financial
comprehension, Morrison also points
out that the program may not be accessi
ble to those who need it. Despite the
prevalence of computers, many still lack
access to the Internet and the
Readyßeturn service, which is only
available online.
But Bankman dismisses the concerns

about accessibility,

"The digital divide is less a problem that one
might have thought," Bankman said. "Even in
2004, which is ages ago computer-wise, nearly half
the eligible users filed online. In an ideal world.
Ready Return might be paper based, too. But that
is more expensive and less secure."
Both Bankman and Morrison still agree that
the federal tax code needs to be simplified.
For those that don't trust the system,
Bankman said, "Readyßeturn is even more
important."
"Readyßeturn tells you what the State
already thinks you owe, based on information it
has about your wages," he added. "If you don't
trust the State, you'd want to know what they
think ahead of time and not wait for them to send
you an audit notice. If you find something in
Readyßeturn that is wrong, you can spot it
before you file."
The format of Readyßeturn does not work
for those with complex incomes. Ineligible wage
earners — including those who have multiple
incomes sources or deductions cannot use
Readyßeturn, but Bankman is looking to expand
accessibility with another program, "Data
Retrieval."
For those who cannot use Readyßeturn, Data
Retrieval uses the same concept of drawing on
government-stored information but without giv
ing a full estimate. The planned program would
add third-party reported sums to an incomplete
tax return to nullify the anxiety of forgetting a
transaction and the possible resulting fine.
