## Law prof, simplifies tax returns CA State 'ReadyReturn' program proposed in D.C. 
### EVELYN KELLEY 
Stanford Law Professor Joseph
Bankman recently travelled to
Washington, D.C. to present his proposal
for tax simplification to the President's
Economic Recovery Advisory Board
(PERAB).
Bankman is proposing the use of
"Readyßeturn," a service that simplifies
tax returns by presenting users with a
pre-filled tax return based on informa
tion from previous years. Readyßeturn
has been available free of charge to eligi
ble residents in the state of California
since 2007, following an initial pilot pro
gram in 2004.
On Oct. 16, Bankman presented his
program to the PERAB as a model for a
possible national-level tax return
process. While Obama had previously
endorsed a similar plan by PERAB's
chief economist and staff director
Austan Goolsbee, Bankman styled his
program as a slightly more conservative
approach that may have a higher chance
of being enacted.
Bankman presented a variant of this
program to the Bush Administration in
2005, but he hopes to find more support
under the new leadership.
The program could reduce stress con
cerning taxes, not by simplifying the code
but by providing a straightforward,
immediate interaction with the govern
ment. According to Bankman,
Readyßeturn uses information the gov
ernment already has on file, thus pre
venting error and cutting down on the
$3O billion that individual-wage earners
spend per year filing their taxes, accord
ing to Bankman.
Users may still make changes to the
Readyßeturn estimate, but user feed
back has been positive.
Intuit, which manufactures the widely
used tax software Turbo Tax, is a center
of opposition. Their concerns focus on
the possibility of mistakes that the IRS
can make with some of the information.
Bankman, however, dismisses this
criticism.
"The mistakes turn out to be awfully
low and taxpayers really love the pro
gram," he said. Between the years 2007
and 2008 the amount of users have quin
tupled.
But Mary Morrison, a financial aid
officer, believes that although
Readyßeturn simplifies the actual filing
process, the program does not address
the root of people's anxiety.
"People have no comprehension of
why certain amounts are taken from
their pay," she said. "They don't know
what W-2 forms are. They don't know if
and when they should file. This form
won't solve that."
Besides difficulties with financial
comprehension, Morrison also points
out that the program may not be accessi
ble to those who need it. Despite the
prevalence of computers, many still lack
access to the Internet and the
Readyßeturn service, which is only
available online.
But Bankman dismisses the concerns
