# Spending down for FY10
## Capital Budget cutbacks force University to prioritize construction 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the effects of Stanford's budget
cuts on people and programming have
drawn much attention from the campus
community, Stanford has also made signifi
cant cutbacks and alterations to its funding
for major construction, infrastructure proj
ects and programs.
At a projected $646.7 million, Stanford's
Capital Budget reflects a sizable decrease in
expenditures for the 2010 fiscal year. The
Capital Budget, this year's anticipated
expenditures, are part of a three-year Capital
Plan, which totals $l.B billion.
Though the Capital Plan suggests a costly
financial forecast, it already includes a $l.l

billion reduction in costs from delayed or
suspended projects. The Capital Plan under
went a 35 percent decrease from last year's
$2.8 billion financial plan.
Provost John Etchemendy described how
the administration decided which capital
projects to approve or suspend in this year's
budget.
"First of all, we didn't pull anything that is
currently being built, being worked on, for
the simple reason that before we start a proj
ect we always have all the money ready to go
on the project," Etchemendy said.
"Secondly, we're saving a lot of money on
the projects that we're currently constructing
by renegotiating with contractors," he added.
"We are one of the few places that still has a
large building project, so contractors are

willing to renegotiate and bring their prices
down."
In implementing the Capital Budget and
Capital Plan, Etchemendy worked in close
conjunction with Robert Reidy, vice presi
dent of Land, Buildings & Real Estate.
Both Reidy and Etchemendy acknowl
edged that the projects originally listed in
the Capital Budget were of great importance
to the University. Therefore, the decision to
delay some of them was difficult.
"It's hard to kind of rank them," Reidy
said of the capital projects. He noted that
they were all "very important to the academ
ic mission and the teaching of undergrads."
"But some are higher priority than others
either we've run out of space in a particu
lar department, or we can no longer do a par-

ticular kind of research, or we have people
that are housed off-campus," Etchemendy
asserted.
He alluded to the Lorry I. Lokey Stem
Cell Research Building that is currently
under construction. Once complete, this new
structure will house researchers who are
presently working off-campus in buildings
leased by the university.
Expenditures for the current fiscal year
will also finance the construction of the
Knight Management Center, the Jen-Hsun
Engineering Center, the Center for
Nanoscale Science and Technology, the Li
Ka Shing Center for Learning and
Knowledge, the East Campus Dining
