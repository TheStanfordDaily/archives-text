# Spending down for FY10
## Capital Budget cutbacks force University to prioritize construction 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the effects of Stanford's budget
cuts on people and programming have
drawn much attention from the campus
community, Stanford has also made signifi
cant cutbacks and alterations to its funding
for major construction, infrastructure proj
ects and programs.
At a projected $646.7 million, Stanford's
Capital Budget reflects a sizable decrease in
expenditures for the 2010 fiscal year. The
Capital Budget, this year's anticipated
expenditures, are part of a three-year Capital
Plan, which totals $l.B billion.
Though the Capital Plan suggests a costly
financial forecast, it already includes a $l.l

billion reduction in costs from delayed or
suspended projects. The Capital Plan under
went a 35 percent decrease from last year's
$2.8 billion financial plan.
Provost John Etchemendy described how
the administration decided which capital
projects to approve or suspend in this year's
budget.
"First of all, we didn't pull anything that is
currently being built, being worked on, for
the simple reason that before we start a proj
ect we always have all the money ready to go
on the project," Etchemendy said.
"Secondly, we're saving a lot of money on
the projects that we're currently constructing
by renegotiating with contractors," he added.
"We are one of the few places that still has a
large building project, so contractors are

willing to renegotiate and bring their prices
down."
In implementing the Capital Budget and
Capital Plan, Etchemendy worked in close
conjunction with Robert Reidy, vice presi
dent of Land, Buildings & Real Estate.
Both Reidy and Etchemendy acknowl
edged that the projects originally listed in
the Capital Budget were of great importance
to the University. Therefore, the decision to
delay some of them was difficult.
"It's hard to kind of rank them," Reidy
said of the capital projects. He noted that
they were all "very important to the academ
ic mission and the teaching of undergrads."
"But some are higher priority than others
either we've run out of space in a particu
lar department, or we can no longer do a par-

ticular kind of research, or we have people
that are housed off-campus," Etchemendy
asserted.
He alluded to the Lorry I. Lokey Stem
Cell Research Building that is currently
under construction. Once complete, this new
structure will house researchers who are
presently working off-campus in buildings
leased by the university.
Expenditures for the current fiscal year
will also finance the construction of the
Knight Management Center, the Jen-Hsun
Engineering Center, the Center for
Nanoscale Science and Technology, the Li
Ka Shing Center for Learning and
Knowledge, the East Campus Dining
Commons, the Law School Clinics
and Faculty Office Building, as well
as the Bing Concert Hall.
"The things that we kept on the
list are the things that either have
extremely high or pressing priority,"
Etchemendy maintained.
In general, capital projects that
were funded by gifts received the
go-ahead for construction, whereas
projects that relied on funding by
debt or University reserves were
more likely to be delayed.
Almost all projects that did not
receive funding this year will be
delayed, rather than suspended,
according to Etchemendy.
"In every case, there was a very
good reason why the building was
on the capital plan â€”it was
because it was considered a high
priority for the University,"
Etchemendy said. "So that's why we
will eventually do almost all of the
buildings and, in the case of the
highest priority ones, we'll move
them back on the plan probably
within a year or two."
These include a new biology
teaching laboratory, a childcare cen
ter and the new art building.
"The things that ended up being
delayed were things that we thought
could be delayed, first of all and that
would save us money to delay
them," Etchemendy further
explained.
"The original capital to do the
building is one thing," Reidy said of
the financial hurdles for various
construction projects. "We also have
to be able to afford the ongoing
costs of the building the opera
tions and maintenance of the build
ing. And if you happen to use some
debt on the building, you have to
service the debt."
On the other hand, construction
of some buildings has been
scrapped altogether. One prominent
example is the cancellation of the
new parking structure near Maples
Pavilion.

Past and Future
For the past eight years, the
Capital Budget has been significant
ly higher than actual expenditures,
with the anticipated budget exceed
ing actual expenditures by 65 per
cent on average. Flowever, this
year's spending represents an
anomaly to the overall trend.
In fact, Reidy noted that there
are 85 projects in design and con
struction at the moment and eight of
these projects cost over $5O million.
"In fiscal year 2010, which ends
Aug. 31,2010,38 of those 85 projects
will be completed," Reidy stated.

"The total value, or cost, of those
projects is $B5O million."
Reidy indicated that his antici
pated costs are higher because they
encompass projects that do not fall
under the Capital Budget.
"It's the largest capital plan since
the University's founding and we've
been preparing and planning for
this six or seven years," he added.
Both the Capital Budget and the
Capital Plan are liable to change,
depending on the availability of
funding and assessments about the
priority of the various projects.
Financing for projects listed in the
Capital Budget mainly comes from
current funds, gifts and debt.
Both Etchemendy and Reidy
remain confident that these capital
projects will, in the long run,
enhance the University's academic
mission.
"I think the one that really
stands out is a series of buildings,
SEQ2," Reidy said of Stanford's

School of Engineering Quad 2.
"It's really more than a building .
.. it enables us to take a peek at
campus and return to the Olmsted
Plan," he added.
Reidy stated that Frederick Law
Olmsted, the university's original
planner, organized the campus
along axes. The new SEQ2 quadran
gle signals a return to this original
idea.

When he presented the Capital
Plan to the Board of Trustees this
past June, Etchemendy acknowl
edged the difficulty of implement
ing high-priority capital projects in
the midst of an economic slump.
During 2008-09, the endowment fell
by an approximate 30 percent; it is
predicted that the University will
have to shoulder a $3OO million
decrease in revenue over the next
few years.
