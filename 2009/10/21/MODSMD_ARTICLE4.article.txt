Senate Appropriations Chair Anton

sophomore class presidents, the ASSU exec
utive and the Undergraduate Senate have
come to an agreement resolving funding
issues threatening to derail Mausoleum

According to Zietsman, the junior class

In previous years. Mausoleum Party was

sponsor a variety of campus events.
Judicial Affairs Appointments Tabled Until
Next Week's Meeting
Following the recommendation by an ad
hoc committee to select nominees for the
Board of Judicial affairs (BJA), Chair Varun
Sivaram 'll presented a bill to the Senate to
confirm the six original BJA candidates. The
Senate will cast a final vote to confirm their
appointment during next week's meeting.
ASSU Green Events Checklist Proposed
Sustainability Subcommittee Chair Dean
Young 'll presented a bill to the Senate that
would formally establish a checklist outlin
ing sustainability standards for internal
ASSU events. Young said the creation of a
checklist was mandated last spring follow
ing the creation of the sustainability sub
committee. Since then, the subcommittee
has consulted with various campus organi
zations, including the Green Store, in order
to determine reasonable guidelines that
would reduce the environmental impact of
all events hosted by the ASSU.
Volunteer student organizations and the

undergraduate classes are exempt from the
sustainability guidelines because the ASSU
needs time to test their implementation.
Young said the specific content of the
checklist would be modified pending a trial
run expected during fall quarter.
"We would implement this now and test
it out for the rest of fall quarter, and get
feedback from groups that try it and then
make revisions," Young said.
Certain components of the bill remained

unresolved, such as the degree to
which the checklist would restrict
student choices in securing mate
rials for events. Senator Alex Katz
'l2 issued concerns that the bill
was too vague with respect to how
students could sustainably source
food for events. Of particular con
cern was a clause in the bill
encouraging students to buy local
ly grown food and purchase items
from bulk retailers like Costco.
"Buying locally and buying
from Costco; these two don't seem
to work together," Katz said, "You
can't buy chips, you can't buy
soda, you can't buy a lot of
things."
The bill is expected to be mod
ified and presented again for a
final vote by next Tuesday's meet
ing.
