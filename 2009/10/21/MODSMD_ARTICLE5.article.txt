## Stanford draws top black profs. Study shows black scholars hired at prestigious colleges 
### TINA ZHENG 
Amadu Kaba, a professor from
Seton Hall University, is claiming that
Stanford and other prestigious univer
sities are magnets for a disproportion
ate number of well-known black schol
ars.
He recently published a paper enti
tled "Demographics and Profile: The
Most Cited Black Scholars in the
Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities"
in the September 2009 Journal of Pan
African Studies. It has been gaining
press for its numerical analysis of the
56 most-cited black scholars in the
U.S.
Kaba's findings indicate that 40
percent of these scholars are
employed at Harvard, Princeton,
Stanford and Yale. Stanford, where
five of the 56 scholars currently
work, comprises 8.9 percent of the
total. Former Psychology Professor
Emeritus Claude Steele, who
recently left to become provost of
Columbia University, was also
third on the list.

Stanford professors mentioned
in the study, however, have doubts
about the significance of the data.
Caroline Floxby, professor of
economics and a senior Floover
fellow, was the ninth most-cited
black scholar in the social sciences
from Kaba's findings. Hoxby,
whose research specialty is educa
tional choice and reform, found
Kaba's work to be more descrip
tive than conclusive.

"It is confusing in the sense that
if I were a reader who didn't know
anything about higher education, I
would think that there was some
thing special about these schools
that attracts highly cited black
scholars," Hoxby said.
This, however, is not the case,
Hoxby argued. She stated this dis
tribution was just "the nature of
the beast." According to Hoxby,
the most prestigious research insti
tutions are always going to have
disproportional numbers of the
most-cited scholars in any catego
ry: "If you study all the red-haired
scholars, you would see them dis
tributed randomly, but if you stud
ied the most well-cited red-haired
scholars, they would of course be at
the top research universities.
"It's almost the definition of
being the best research institutions
â€”to have the most-cited schol
ars," Hoxby added.
History Prof. Clayborne
Carson, founding director of the
Martin Luther King, Jr., Research
and Education Institute at
Stanford, is also among the most
cited scholars in social sciences
featured in Kaba's paper. Carson
questioned the merits of Kaba's
paper in its supposed specificity to
black scholars.
"The only way to determine the
validity [of the paper] would be to
do a study of white scholars and he
didn't do that research," Carson
said.
Carson also identified possible
reasons for the concentration of
black scholars at prestigious uni
versities.
"Schools like Stanford can
recruit from other schools," Carson
said. "By the time you have
research that is widely cited, you
are more likely to be older.
Younger scholars, who may be
equally bright, aren't as well
known and haven't been recruited
yet."
Carson further described a
"pecking order" enduring in aca
demia that supports the concen
trated statistics of black scholars.
"Few people leave Harvard to
go to Duke, but the same isn't true
the other way," Carson added.
Stanford is an ideal working
atmosphere for Carson, who said
Stanford professors' limited teach
ing loads give them more time for
research when compared to small
er schools like Morehouse College,
where Carson also teaches.
"At Stanford, I can do the
research I want to do and have the
time and resources to do it,"
Carson said.
Carson doesn't criticize the goal
of Kaba's research; he believes any
research that gives the public
information and brings to light cru
cial issues is "worthwhile." Carson
further identified still-present
racial barriers and inequalities
concentrated at lower levels of
education.
"Students starting at predomi
nantly black high school are less
likely to progress through graduate
school and teach at universities,"
Carson said. "The pool is very
much less than for white scholars."
