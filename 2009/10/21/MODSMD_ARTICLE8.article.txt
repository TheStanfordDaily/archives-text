## Professors of Summer

Part two of an exploration into the summer
accomplishments of Stanford professors.

Keith Devlin

For mathematics Prof. Keith Devlin, co
founder and executive director of Stanford's
Fluman-Sciences and Technologies Advanced
Research (H-STAR) Institute, and National
Public Radio's "The Math Guy," summer is a
time for research, writing, cycling and confer
ences, often all in the same day.
This past summer, Devlin worked on two
books, one historical popular book on mathe
matics and a second related to video-game
technologies and middle school education.
"I've always got at least one book project on
and so summer is one of the times when I can
do a lot of book writing," he said.
Devlin is also working on two research
projects.
"One is counterintelligence work," he said.
"It's not secret work, it's just trying to develop
methods to improve intelligence gathering and
intelligence analysis. I've actually been working
in that area since 9/11."
His other research project relates to game
technology and math education. Devlin's
research shows how video-game technology
can revolutionize middle school mathematics
education.
"When you think about it, the written word
is a very poor way of communicating mathe
matics because mathematics is not about know
ing it is about doing," he explained.
He compared learning math to playing
music.
"You can capture music through notation,
but you then have to read it and interpret it,"
Devlin said. "If the only way to have access to
music were through the printed note, very few
people would like it. But now we can have it in
our ears with our iPhone and we can hear it."
As Director of the H-STAR Institute,
Devlin hosted a number of Danish guests, from
top Danish technology companies and political
parties as Denmark was this summer's geo
graphical emphasis. Devlin also traveled to
Washington D.C., Sweden and Cornell to pres
ent in a variety of workshops, conferences and
lectures.
However, for Devlin, summer is an especial
ly important time to do some serious cycling.
"In July I did a thing called the Death Ride,
which is supposedly one of the hardest rides in
the United States," he said. "It's a day-long ride
in the Sierras. You do about 130 miles over big
mountains. You're on the saddle for about
eleven and a half hours."

"The research and the book-writing was
going on all the time," he said. "Even when I'm
cycling, I'm always thinking about how to write
an article or a passage of a book or thinking
about the challenging issue of the research.
Many of the best visual ideas come when you
clear the mind doing physical exercise ... You
just clear the mind of thoughts, and original
ideas can sometimes come."

But Devlin admits that there is not a large
distinction between his work commitment dur
ing the summer and the other three seasons.
"For many years I never took an official hol
iday," he said. My tax accountant would say, 'ls
this business or pleasure?' and I'll say yes. It's
all the same. I don't have work, relaxation time,
vacation time it's just life."

Creative Writing and English Prof.
Elizabeth Tallent spent a significant portion of
her summer on the Mendocino Coast working
on a novel.
"The novel takes place post-Civil War in
Mendocino county and that means I need to
read everything I can get my hands on about
the Civil War and about California at that
time," she said. "Luckily for me it's fascinating
stuff. I have this notion that these very imagi
nary readers will be watching for every mistake
... but I'm also giving myself some freedom to
invent. I felt like that's where I spent my sum
mer â€”1867."

Devlin also did mountain biking with
friends for a week in Washington State and
more cycling in Utah.

The main character of her novel is a botanist
who survived Andersonville, one of the most
brutal prison camps in the South. The botanist
in the novel spends his time finding and identi
fying plants.
"I'm really fascinated by the idea that it was
n't that long ago," she said. "We're talking about
the 1870s. They were still finding the Californian
flora at least the Anglo Europeans were find
ing it for the first time and trying to slot it into
the Linnaean system of identification and nam
ing. I'm interested in the contrast between the
horrific imprisonment and the frontier and the
freedom and the wilderness."
One of her favorite books from this past
summer was "Co. Aytch" by Sam Watkins, a
Confederate infantryman who wrote a memoir
twenty years after his service.
"You can tell he's a writer," she said. "He's
so incredibly likeable and funny, and just smart
about human beings ... he just makes the asso

ciations that you know that he saw the thing
itself, but he also has a sort of slant way of see
ing it."
Tallent first became aware of her passion for
writing while she was working on an archeolog
ical dig in Texas.
"They required us to keep a journal and you
had to write every day," she said. "I think their
notion was that this trains you to become an
observant archaeologist. I just wrote these long
descriptions about the beauty of an antelope
skull. Mine was totally useless for the training
of an archaeologist. But I started to get it that I
really liked writing."
She takes this same approach with summer,
describing it from a creative perspective.
"You just sort of jump off the cliff and you
don't have to come back for anything," she said.
