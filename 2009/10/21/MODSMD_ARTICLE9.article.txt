# OVERSEAS SEMINARS ON HOLD
## 
### ELLEN HUET SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University-wide budget cuts and
restructuring in the office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate
Education (VPUE) have led
Stanford to temporarily close its
undergraduate Overseas Seminars program for
summer 2010, eliciting a variety of responses
from the Stanford community.
The overseas seminars take place each sum
mer and concentrate on specific subjects for a
short three-week term, as opposed to the longer
and more popular Bing Overseas Studies
Programs (BOSP), which are quarter-long pro
grams that offer a variety of classes.
Because the seminars do not conflict with
school-year academics, they are often targeted
toward students who might be otherwise unable
to study abroad and the program closure has
caused some concern among students.
Aidan Dunn 'll participated in an overseas
seminar in Western Australia and, as a transfer
student, feels that the seminar was a unique
opportunity to study abroad while still focusing
on graduating.
"Transfer students have a very limited
amount of time at Stanford to complete our
graduation requirements and many of us don't
have the option of studying abroad for a quar
ter," Dunn wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "The
overseas seminars were away that transfer stu

dents (and others who can't take time away from
campus) could still have an overseas experience,
so I was very disappointed to hear that future
transfer students would no longer have that
option."
The seminars, unlike BOSP, also offer more
intensive study on one subject, which may attract
students uninterested in entire quarters abroad.
"My decision to attend the Oxford seminar
was motivated not only by its being only three
weeks in the summer versus a full quarter, but
also because its topic, British Contributions to
Computer Science, was directly relevant to my
techie interests," said Jeffrey Wear 'll. "It would
be virtually impossible to study anything related
to computer science at Oxford for a quarter-long
program."
Although the seminars are sometimes mar
keted as alternative options to those who want to
study abroad for a quarter but can't afford the
time, students who have done both feel that the
two programs are essentially different and not
substitutes for one another.
"I got very different things out of my overseas
seminar than I have out of my two quarters at the
Stanford in Paris program," said Magali Ferare
'lO. "While both were rewarding in different
ways, I feel like advertising overseas seminars to
students who can't go abroad for a full quarter as
the 'full overseas experience' (or their replace
ment for it) is false advertising."
In announcing the program's temporary clo
sure, Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman explained that the Overseas

Seminars were chosen because of their relative
expense and because their concentrated timeline
would make the program easier to re-establish
quickly.
Although the seminars have been temporari
ly cut, administrators in the quarter-long over
seas programs don't feel they are under the same
threat.

"The administrative structure of overseas
seminars is very different from the BOSP," said
Fabienne Jeannot, an administrator at Stanford
in Paris. "The seminar programs don't have per
manent overseas centers and they still manage to
do admirable work, but it may have also been a
reason behind their closure."
Since students can apply for a seminar after
any year at Stanford except their last, current stu
dents missing out on summer 2010 may still be
able to participate if the program returns soon.
Although the fluctuating power of the dollar
and the uncertain economic future have prevent
ed VPUE from making guarantees about the
seminar program's return, past participants are
hopeful about the program's future and insistent
on its unique place in Stanford's academic cul
ture.
"My overseas seminar gave me a chance to
something I never could have done on campus or
through a quarter-length study-abroad pro
gram," Dunn wrote. "I think we are definitely los
ing something invaluable in shaping our students
and future leaders by letting these seminars go."
