## EDITORIAL Stanford more prepared for flu threat than others 
### 
Since the threat of swine flu first
emerged last spring, the world has
worked quickly and cooperatively to
suppress further spread of this virus. The
Stanford community is uniquely vulnerable
to the spread of a virus. Despite the vastness
of the campus, Stanford features many high
ly trafficked areas, frequented by young
adults with immune systems that are weak
ened by all-nighters and parties. The only
reasonable course of action is to err as much
on the side of caution as possible, taking
every necessary step to limit the spread of
this strand of flu.
We have learned from incidents in the
past how to behave. The Editorial Board
commends the efforts of the campus organi
zations that make it easier for us to stay
healthy with continuous reminders to wash
our hands, get rest and watch for symptoms.
In evaluating the risks that swine flu pres
ents to the Stanford community, we immedi
ately think of the inconvenience that this
sickness can cause. This is week five of the fall
quarter, and a serious case of swine flu could
confine any of us to days of bed rest that
would keep us away from our academic and
professional endeavors. It comes as no sur
prise that those of us who have been lucky
enough to avoid the flu already have been
waiting anxiously for vaccinations against it.
People arrived in droves and stood in line for
the seasonal flu vaccine, and we continue to
await the arrival of the swine flu vaccine.
We deserve to have a vaccination in a
timely manner, and we hope that those re
sponsible for providing it are doing all that
they possibly can to provide it as soon as pos
sible. But the Editorial Board feels that, with
the incredible health resources available on
this campus and our collective awareness of
the gravity of virus control, we would not be
playing our part in the global community if
we were not more outspoken for the distribu

tion of this vaccination in disadvantaged
areas.
Simply put, a significant portion of
mankind has nowhere near the resources
that we have here at Stanford to combat an
epidemic. There are countless places on
Earth where a Vaden Health Center or a
world-class university hospital is beyond
what the locals could ever dream of seeing.
These areas disproportionately represent the
deaths that have occurred from this epidem
ic. When the information about this flu be
came available to us, we all began to feel
panic slowly set in as reports from around the
globe brought news of fatalities at the hands
of the HINI virus. When the disease finally
came to Stanford, we knew enough about it
to handle it appropriately, and we have been
blessed enough to treat the virus successfully
in every case.
Just as many people began to stockpile
bottled water and gasoline back in 1999,
there is no way to avoid the competition that
exists today for a sense of security in times of
peril. Ironically, it is the same case then as
now that those who are working the hardest
to secure themselves against these threats
are those who are in the best situation to re
sist this danger. There are many people out
there who have few, if any resources avail
able to combat seasonal flu, swine flu or any
other flu that may afflict them.
We do not need to get up in arms to ensure
that a vaccine arrives in our community in a
timely manner, because we have effective in
stitutions in place to protect our health and
interests. We do, however, need to be sure
that we are doing all that we can to ensure the
health of those who do not have the re
sources that we have. Continue to be healthy
and considerate in this time, and, as leaders in
this global community, keep in mind the re
sponsibilities that we have to each other in
the Stanford community and abroad.
