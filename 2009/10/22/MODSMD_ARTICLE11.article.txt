# FLECHAS Y PEDRADAS
## Last May, I Went to North Carolina ... 
### Patrick Kozey 
This week, I'm taking a break from
Spain and from the present. Instead, I'll
be using this space to sing the praises of
past aimlessness.
Last May, throwing my luggage in the
trunk of my friend's silver Mustang, I left
California at two in the afternoon. The car re
flected, snub-nosed, in the windows of the
storefronts we drove by on the way to San
Jose Airport. The top was down, and the wind
was good. The sun was good. The day was
good, as it all too often is on that shoulder of
America. The air had a peculiar quality to it
diamond-like, pristine with a clean cutting
edge one that I forgot as soon as I was out
of it and sitting in the metal tube of recircu
lated air that took me from one coast to an
other. I slept. Outside the airport in Raleigh,
N.C., the air was different. Tobacco hung
around the ashtrays, and the dampness of the
night locked it in place.
It was the weekend after my birthday, and
my brother. Matt, was graduating from law
school. I took the weekend as a needed break
to remind me there were other places than
Stanford, and to see my family. Matt and his
twin Chris are five and a half years my sen
iors, and I cannot remember a time when I
thought what I was doing was as interesting
or as valid as my thoughts and concerns in
life. Seeing the last of them finish with school
seemed appropriate it was what I would
want to do next.
One of the things I had wanted before, no
doubt because I saw Matt and Chris have it
first, was a relationship. The real kind, with
someone whom I loved and who loved me,
someone interested in and capable of those
things someone older. When I was six
teen, I found that person, and for two years,
despite the stupidity that always surrounds
such things, I'd like to think we had some
thing real. When I left California last May,
that girl was engaged, and when I came back
she was married, neither time to me. In one of
life's great moments of hilarity with a healthy
added portion of "fuck you," I had unknow
ingly flown to the very spot where, and at the
very time when the ceremony took place,
I was happy for her. I did not want mar
riage, and I did not want it with her. All the
same, I was surprised that it fucked with me
as much as it did. And it didn't leave me
alone, like when an album of wedding photos
showed up on a friend's Facebook page. The
logical response? When the sun rose that day,
I was waiting for it, with a friend, the both of

us leaning against a rooftop railing with rust
roses blooming underneath and spreading. I
flicked the paint to make sure it wouldn't
stain my shirtsleeves, and I turned the glass of
cheap brandy in my hand, slowly. The amber
in it was flecked by touches of the early
morning sun, and that sunlight felt like it
traveled with every sip, coursing through all
the appropriate internal valves and pieces of
tubing. The pleasant burn dissipated so
quickly, though, that you didn't notice it was
leaving until it was gone like heat trapped
underneath ruffled bed linens, keeping alive
embers of whoever has left. Maybe just to
take a shower. Maybe without saying good
bye.
Matt is still out of law school, still living
life, still looking for a job. Chris is engaged to
be married this coming summer. I am happy
for both of them, but I am not envious. Now
is fine with me, and the future can wait its
turn. If you disagree, dear reader, I'll tell you
this: Look at your ex walking down the aisle
and tell me you feel differently.
Until next time.

Patrick Kozey is interested to hear from those
who don't think it would be weird to be married
right now. I mean, really? Email him at
