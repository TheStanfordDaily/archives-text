# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Turn, Turn, Turn 
### Emily Hulme 
Well, it's that time of year again. With
too many midterms and not nearly
enough sleep, let's focus on some
thing bigger than you, me and our Facebook
relationship status.
That's right it's time for New Year's
Resolutions. But wait, you say aren't
those for January? Technically, yes, in the
Oprah-engineered world of self-fulfilling
goals and 12-step happiness via intellectual
euthanasia schemes. I'm not talking about
those kinds of resolutions. Rather than focus
ing on some abstract notion of "self-actual
ization," try thinking about it as a tangible,
evolutionary sense. In the grand Darwinian
scheme of life, you should be using your en
ergy to improve your relative sexual fitness.
Your success, indeed, should be as flashy as a
male peacock?s turquoise plumage. There's
no better way to win at resolutions than giv
ing yourself ample time to (1) tilt the game in
your favor, (2) modify implausible goals and
(3) fabricate results, if necessary. In this, you
have an admirable predecessor: Karl Rove.
Yes, yes, the former special advisor to the
president; he's on your side in one of his more
artsy columns in The Wall Street Journal. Ap
parently, he and W. each read 96 books or so
during the presidency. Now, my putative oc
cupation is reading and learning, or so a man
at JJ&F's claimed when he saw me at one of
the outside tables with a textbook (little did
he know it has a secondary function as a nap
kin for cranberry sauce). That being said, I

certainly am not reading more than one book
a week. So, since Karl asserts these are nei
ther books on tape nor the abridged versions
of childhood favorites like "Goodnight,
Moon," I'm not sure how the Commander in
Chief managed to squeeze this in while run
ning the country. Maybe Cheney really was in
charge. Or, Karl Rove is ... exaggerating.
Never saw that coming.
Now, the usual resolutions are pretty
cliche and boring, and saying you plan on ex
ercising more everyday won't wipe the smug
look off that girl from your high school's face.
Your goals need glamour, sex appeal and,
above all, must seem exquisitely esoteric. To
this end, I will humbly make a few recom
mendations based on my own observations:
Learn a foreign language, but be sure to
pick one spoken by less than 100,000 people
who have little to no contact with the outside
world. This will avoid any nasty confronta
tions in which some woeful inadequacy on
your part might be revealed.
Start wearing existential black turtle
necks and use the online Postmodernism
Generator to establish your opinions on cul
tural matters. It's a healthier way to be cool
than smoking.
Become a Southern Baptist. Putting the
fun in fundamentalist since 1845!
Feature yourself as a "classy drinker." No
Malibu.
Win a few Nobel Prizes. Take it from me
the first time is always awkward, but it gets

better.
Buy some Aqua Velva. It's like a liquid
pick-up line!
Stop watching The Hills under the pre
tense that its artistic integrity has been com
promised by Lauren's departure.
These are just the tip of the iceberg, and
there's a whole world of outlandish commit
ments you can make if you put your mind to
it. If these aren't exciting enough for you, go
find inspiration by putting things in perspec
tive at what I like to think of as the birthplace
of un-civilization: Las Vegas. Imagine what
all your friends will think when you come
back and tell them you married the guy with
hair gel who beat you at blackjack twice in a
row.

Like most people, you'll probably be sick
of your commitment after two to four days
(see: the divorce rate, circa now). At the same
time, you don't want the Republicans playing
pin-the-tail on the flip-flopper with you as
the main roast. This is where the real genius
comes in you deny that it was a resolution
at all. It was made before all the facts were in,
so be pragmatic it's not all about winning;
it's about cutting losses, too. Make an appear
ance on SNL, if you must, to appease the pro
les. Will a few folks call you flaky? Sure, but a
commitment is only ever as good as what
you're committing to.
