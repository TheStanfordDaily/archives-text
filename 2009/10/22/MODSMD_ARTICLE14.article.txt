Dear Editor,

While Main Street is grappling with
mounting job losses, home foreclosures and
health insurance payments, Wall Street is in a
state of euphoria. The villains of the financial
meltdown, who escaped accountability and
possibly long term prison sentences, are now
being rewarded with huge bonuses amount
ing to $l4O billion. On the government side of
the ledger, Timothy Geithner's closest advi
sors (Gene Sperling, Lee Sachs), Larry Sum
mers and others are making millions in moon
lighting fees. It is astounding that government

officials can participate in lucrative consult
ing services while in office. As former bank
regulator William Black observed, "finance
simply works for finance and in particular for
the elites within finance." Black is convinced
that the alleged record bank profits have
been falsely manufactured using 'Enron ac
counting gimmicks.' Pending home foreclo
sures have been postponed or kept 'off the
books' to portray a more favorable 'bottom
line: In a bank-friendly gesture, Geithner has
now proposed capital insurance to replace
deposit insurance, which would immunize
banks from losses encouraging reckless trad

ing. Contrary to the White House rhetoric
promising stricter regulations of banks, the
House Financial Services Committee recent
ly exempted 98 percent of the banks from an
nual oversights. An unhealthy nexus between
Treasury, Wall Street and K Street is alive and
well stifling real reforms benefiting Main
Street. It is time for the public to express its
outrage and demand real change.
