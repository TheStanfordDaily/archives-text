## AIMING FOR THE BEARS Cardinal takes on rival Cal with division title at stake 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After racking up a season-high 33 shots in
a dominating 11-1 win over UC-Davis on Sat
urday, the Stanford field hockey team now
sets its sights on rival California.
The No. 12 Cardinal (12-2, 4-1 NorPac)
looks to avenge one of its two losses on Fri
day when it hosts the Golden Bears (5-9,3-1
NorPac). Last month, Stanford suffered its
first loss of the season after an 8-0 start, losing
4-3 at Berkeley. Although Cal is 0-7 on the
road, the Cardinal knows better than to over
look the Golden Bears.
"We're going to have to play our game, go
at Cal hard and be composed the whole
time," said senior Rachel Bush. "We can't

allow any mental lapses that Cal could take
advantage of."
Enjoying one of the team's best seasons
ever, Stanford is a mere two wins away from
tying the program record for most wins in a
season. The record of 14 was set in 1997, and
may soon be overrun by this year's team.
The major key to Stanford's success so far
has been its intimidating offense, which has
averaged over four goals per game and re
ceived numerous NorPac Offensive Player of
the Week titles, most recently by junior Xan
the Travlos, who scored her second hat trick
of the season against UC-Davis on Saturday.
The result of Friday's match is exceeding
ly important as it not only determines the
winner of the NorPac's West Division title,
but also provides the winning team with a No.
1 seed in the NorPac Championship two
weeks later. Although the game is vital both
for postseason chances and for team momen
tum, the Cardinal women are not feeling the
pressure.
"I try to keep my head clear of external

pressure," said senior Midori Uehara. "I hope
to make the right decisions on the field,
whether it's giving a good pass, taking a good
shot or making a good run."
Also, prior to Friday's game, the seniors on

the team Bush, Jennifer Luther, Rachel
Mozenter, Mariana Shile, Nora Soza and Ue
hara will be honored for their commit
ment and service to the team. With this grad
uating class, the team has claimed back-to
back NorPac Tournament Championship ti
tles. Additionally, these women were able to
carry the team to the postseason NCAA
Tournament for the first time in eight years in
2007.

"It's a big game for all of our seniors on
Friday, and I know that everyone will be play
ing for them," said sophomore Stephanie
Byrne. "They have been excellent leaders for
us underclassmen, and we want to honor
them with a win."

The game begins at 7 p.m. at the Varsity
Turf, with the senior honors ceremony taking
place a few minutes before, along with the
honoring of 30 Stanford field hockey alumnae
as part of Reunion Weekend.
