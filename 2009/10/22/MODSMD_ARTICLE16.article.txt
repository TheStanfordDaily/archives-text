## Cardinal golfers take on nation's best in Florida 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's golf team will
take on the cream of the crop in college golf
this Sunday at the Isleworth Collegiate Invi
tational in Windermere, Fla. hosted by Texas
Tech University.
The top five teams in the nation according
to Golfweek rankings will be in attendance.
The Cardinal will face No. 1 Oklahoma State,
No. 2 Arizona State, No. 3 Illinois, No. 4 Wash
ington and No. 5 TCU.This is the second tour
nament in a row in which Stanford will chal
lenge its main Pacific-10 Conference oppo
nents.

Other than the top five, the Isleworth tour
nament will feature many East Coast teams,
including No. 11 Florida, No. 14 South Caroli
na, No. 16 Alabama, No. 24 Clemson, No. 26
Georgia, No. 48 East Tennessee State, No. 73
Central Florida and No. 117 Kentucky.
Not only are the Cardinal five up against
the top teams in the country, but they will also
have to overcome obstacles on the links. The
Isleworth course is consistently ranked as the
"longest and toughest course in the state" by
the Florida State Golf Association.

Weather has also proven to add to the Isle
worth golf course's difficult mystique. The
day after Hurricane Wilma during the tour
nament in 2005, the average score rose from
75 to 81 with no individuals breaking par. In
2006, golfers faced temperatures ranging
from 50 to 90 degrees, which resulted in a
four-stroke increase in the average.
Last year, Georgia took the tournament
crown by 17 strokes.The top ten scores not in
cluding Georgia's ranged from 20 over-par to
38 over-par. This wide range of scores shows
that a few teams often separate themselves
from the rest.

The Cardinal held fast in eighth last year
paced by current senior Joseph Bramlett in a
tie for 14th and junior Steve Ziegler in a tie
for 20th. Given the golf team's current high

streak, Stanford will be looking to out-do
themselves.
"What is awesome about our team this
year is that our top five guys have the ability
to win any tournament individually," said
sophomore David Chung.
At the Prestige at the PGA West tourna
ment last week, the Cardinal was runner up as
a team and scored the third place individual
medal with Chung.
"The preseason is important to us," he
said. "Our team is working very hard right
now in both practices and workouts to be the
most physically fit and prepared team for
tournaments this year."
The Isleworth Collegiate tournament will
be like nothing Stanford has seen so far. A
tough course, top competition and potential
ly testy weather conditions all will test the
Cardinal five in only the third tournament of
this fall season.
Action begins Sunday at 8 a.m.
