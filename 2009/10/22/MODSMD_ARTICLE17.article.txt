# Get the calls right, MLB

### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
If baseball were a prepubescent
sixth grader, I'd be its bearded
eighth grade bully. He's just too
easy of a target, constantly leav
ing himself vulnerable to an infinite
supply of wedgies and swirlies. He
tries to stand up to me and end this
abusive relationship, even attempting
to befriend me from time to time.

And baseball was close. This year
was almost the year that I left him
alone, once and for all. Minnesota's
historic push into the playoffs, the po
tential world championship defense
of the Phillies and the loaded ALDS
matchup between the Angels and the
Red Sox almost brought me to terms
with baseball. Sure, he's an acne-rid
den punk that annoys me on a regular
basis, but he does have some redeem
ing qualities.
Plus, baseball was supposed to
bring me a special gift that I had been
lacking in my sports universe, an oc
currence that I now believe is only a
fantasy. Baseball was going to give
me officiating consistency.
As an overly passionate NBA fan,
I have been slapped around by dis
turbingly sketchy officiating for over
a decade, peaking at the Tim Don
aghy scandal, and reinforced by less
than-desirable performances by the
referees in the 2008 and 2009 NBA
Finals.
The NFL has been no less embar
rassing. The pigskin zebras have
given us the Ed Hoculi-San Diego de
bacle, the Golden Boy's famous tuck
rule against Oakland and a $32 mil
lion blunder during a 2008 Titans-
Steelers game.
I mean, NFL refs are so awful that
they need get this instant re
play! What tools. Go figure, a sport
that is so concerned with getting cru
cial calls right that it has implement
ed away to at least partially ensure
the integrity of the game.
Baseball traditionalists would not
allow such a travesty. Their argu
ments change daily, but remain
miraculously abundant:
"Baseball has never needed in
stant replay! Human error is part of
the game! There's no need to belittle
one of the greatest traditions this side
of Thanksgiving! It's America's
game! Instant replay in baseball for
calls other than disputed home runs is
just silly! Overweight grandpas in
navy blue add so much to the game!
Only Al-Qaeda would want to
change baseball!"
Sound logical to you?
Nonetheless, I gave baseball a
chance and decided to give my team
that-I-will-half-heartedly-follow-
but-really-not-care-less-about vote
to the Angels. It was playoff time,
there was potential for slight excite
ment and there was no Florida team
to bandwagon. Most of all, there was
no real threat of mood instability, be
cause at the end of the day, my feel
ings would be unaffected.
Or so I thought.
The umpiring in this year's play
offs has demonstrated why Major
League Baseball is slowly regressing
into the Major League Lacrosse
stratosphere. Never in my wildest
dreams could I have imagined seeing
so many awful yet obvious errors in
judgment on the part of any officiat
ing crew of an American professional
sport. Aside from calling balls and
strikes and the occasional close play
at first, baseball really isn't a difficult
sport to officiate my vision is hor
rendous, but I feel like I'm right on
most calls upon first glance.
Yet in Tuesday night's game be
tween the Angels and Yankees alone,
there were so many questionable
calls that Donaghy was shivering.
Dale Scott made the first glaring
error, when he ruled that a clearly
successful pickoff of Yankees right
fielder Nick Swisher had failed,
granting Swisher another shot at
scoring. Then, only moments later,
fellow ump Tim McClelland called
Swisher out for leaving third too
quickly on a pop fly, only to be proven
otherwise by, get this, instant replay.
McClelland wasn't done though, as
he failed to correctly call an undeni
able heads-up double play by Angels
catcher Mike Napoli when he tagged
both Jorge Posada and Robinson

Cano as they stood two feet from
the umpire off of the third base
bag.

Words could never do these plays
justice. Every one of these mistakes
was completely and utterly avoid
able; yet, both teams were wrongly
punished as a result.

For those who watched the 10-1
beat down by New York, you fall into
one of two categories.
The first is that group comprised
of Yankees fans and those who wa
gered on the Yankees that contend
that these blown calls did nothing to
affect the outcome of the game.

Great argument. Except for the fact
that momentum does exist in sports
and having the umpires dictate the
outcome of a crucial, potential series
tying matchup with buffoon-like
judgment feels like getting repeated
ly kicked by a donkey below the belt.
The Angels looked absolutely lifeless
after the 4,213 th blown call of the se
ries and I really can't blame them.
The second group is made of
those rational human beings my
self included that see the need,
rather, the necessity for instant replay
in baseball. Although this specific
game may not have been ultimately
decided by bad calls, other games
have and will continue to be deter
mined by the poor eyes of a few "pro
fessionally trained" umpires.
Baseball is just too vulnerable of a
sport to take another hit. America has

changed. We like high-scoring, fast
paced action. The MLB, besides al
lowing pitchers to take eight months
to toss an infinite amount of pickoff
attempts to first, cannot afford anoth
er distraction that slows down the
pace of the game because of elongat
ed arguments between umps and
managers and especially not if this
distraction is directly affecting the
outcomes of playoff battles.
And for those of you traditional
ists that have been punching a pillow
while reading this column: Not all
traditions are beneficial. Don't be
lieve me?
Just watch the replays.
