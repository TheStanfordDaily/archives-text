## DLCL deliberates central changes 
### ANNIE PROSSNITZ 
Many of Stanford's culture and
literature departments could be fac
ing a major administrative change.
In the upcoming weeks, the work
ing committee designed to review
the structure of the Division of
Literatures, Cultures and Languages
(DLCL) will announce its proposed
changes to the division's structure.
The committee is currently deliber
ating on whether to merge the five
separate departments, which include
the departments of comparative lit
erature, French and Italian, German
studies, Iberian and Latin American
cultures, and Slavic languages and
literatures, into a single department.
The DLCL also includes several
non-departmental units, including
Structured Liberal Education
(SLE), as well as numerous research
groups.
According to DLCL Director and
comparative literature Prof. Roland
Greene, the committee is four to six
weeks away from announcing its for
mal decision.
"The dean of Humanities and
Sciences [Richard Sailer] has the
final approval of it, and we have to
have a consensus about the faculty
for it to work," Greene said. "Our

conversations with the dean have
been about coming up with an
instruction that we're happy with
and he's happy with."
Sailer declined to comment.
For the past five years, the DLCL
has been composed of these five sep
arate departments, with five differ
ent department chairs and individual
departmental control over the direc
tion of programs and budget. A com
mon chair oversees the entire DLCL
division.
"I would hazard that the current
structure has been appreciated by
most people in the DLCL," said
Iberian and Latin American cultures
Prof. Joan Resina. "Some of us
thought that it was an ideal situa
tion."
In the past fifteen years, the
DLCL has become increasingly cen
tralized. According to former
Stanford and current Yale professor
of comparative literature Haun
Saussy, the DLCL held no common
chair in 1995, and the departments
functioned as separate, though simi
lar, entities.
In 2001, the DLCL was further
consolidated with the creation of a
shared chair, Saussy explained.
The DLCL merger under current
consideration would involve the con

solidation of the separate depart
ments' budgets into a single budget,
as well as the elimination of individ
ual department chairs.
"Such changes, in my view, should
not be driven by factors such as
administrative convenience or sav
ings, but rather by an innovative
intellectual or scholarly agenda,"
said comparative literature and
Italian Prof. Jeffrey Schnapp. "To
simply departmentalize the de facto
structure accomplishes little."
But Resina fears the consolida
tion of the division may potentially
also affect the process of deciding
curricula, hiring and promoting with
in the division.
"If hiring is no longer done by the
units but is done by the overall struc
ture, then you will have the paradox
of someone who's an expert on
Russian literature perhaps determin
ing who would become faculty in the
Iberian area, and vice versa," he said.
While Greene said the proposal
would affect faculty, he explained it
will not have much impact on stu
dents. "There's no scenario where
we're talking about changing degree
programs or majors," he noted.
