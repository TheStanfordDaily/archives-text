## Fellowships cut due to economy 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN 
The economic depression has recently claimed two
more financial casualties and threatens to claim a third,
reducing the options for Stanford students seeking external
support for study abroad and schooling post-graduation.
The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation (JKCF) Graduate
Fellowship, which funds many seniors intending to continue
their education at graduate or professional school, has been
discontinued for new graduate students.
According to their website, the JKCF will from now on
fund only those students "who have received an undergrad
uate scholarship from the Foundation."
"The JKCF was a major source of graduate funding,
albeit for only a small number of awardees nationwide
annually," said Glenn Magid, the academic director of
Wilbur Hall, in an e-mail to The Daily. He added that stu
dents shouldn't be too discouraged by the loss of this specif
ic opportunity as there are plenty of scholarships and fel
lowships to consider.
In addition, the Freeman-ASIA Award, which funded
undergraduate study abroad programs in East and
Southeast Asia, has also been slashed. Its Web site
announced that the competition was discontinued after
Spring 2009, after eight years of grants sponsored by the
Freeman Foundation.
However, the survival of other major funding programs
indicates that it is hardly time to despair. Overseas
Resource Center Manager Katie Route told The Daily in
an e-mail that it is very unlikely that the scholarships many
graduates depend on for overseas research, such as
Fulbright, Rhodes, Marshall and Gates, will cut the number
of awards offered. "We certainly haven't noticed any drop,"
she added.
Although it is possible, Route conceded, that cuts to
scholarships might not be reflected in the number of avail
able awards, Stanford students remain interested in study

and research abroad.
A fellowship coordinated by the Haas Center for Public
Service has also been affected.
The John Gardner Public Service Fellowship Program,
which operates both at Stanford and at UC-Berkeley, has
suffered. As Megan Fogarty, the Postgraduate and Alumni
Programs Director at the center, told The Daily in an e
mail, "The Berkeley program has been impacted such that
unless they raise $25,000 by March 1, Berkeley will only be
able to fund two (not three) fellows for next year."
Fogarty noted that Gardner alumni are attempting to
close the gap, which although helpful, is not a long term
solution.
Many students have also shown concern about the
future of Stanford's financial aid program, which in the past
several years has attempted to revise its criteria to include
more students. Fortunately, Director of Student Awards
Ron Diaz reassures students that those receiving financial
aid will not be directly affected.
"This has not directly impacted undergraduates current
ly receiving need-based aid." According to Diaz, the
University has tapped into other funds to maintain its com
mitment to current aid policies. However, the financial aid
office has seen a notable increase in aid applications this
year, which have been attributed to the downturn in the
economy.
Where there have been losses, staff said they are pre
pared to compensate by assisting students as much as pos
sible in discovering new opportunities. Magid offers support
to any students who have been affected by the discontinua
tion of JKCF, or similar programs.
"Undergraduate Advising and Research (UAR) wel
comes anyone who was interested in the JKCF fellowship
to speak with their Academic Directors about other ways
they can pursue their academic goals," he said.
