## Budget cuts rule in GSC discussion Reduction of $50,000 hinders programming 
### VIVIANA ARCIA 
The Graduate Student Council's
Wednesday meeting was dominated
by an issue much of Stanford is
attempting to overcome: budget cuts.
Recent cuts by the University
administration have now begun to
force some of its members to begin
taking a closer look at finances and to
try to curb a significant portion of
their loans. This new plan influenced
the council's aid toward one of
Stanford's major events: the
Mausoleum Party.
The council, announcing that over
the course of the next few years a
budget reduction of $50,000 would
significantly affect the amount of
financial aid they grant, concentrated
much of their meeting on discussing
possible plans to keep their aid, as well
as their overall budget, within limit.
As of now, the council has just
over $14,000 after allocating $5,000 at
Wednesday's meeting to the
Graduate Thanksgiving Party, mostly
going toward catering and, as GSC
Thanksgiving Party representative
and geological and earth sciences stu
dent Mary Van der Hoven put it,
"providing a festive and party atmos
phere,"
Members asserted that in order
for the council to stay afloat until
spring quarter, student groups asking
for aid will have to be handled on a
case by case basis, and the GSC must
maintain objectivity toward every
one.
"We need to tighten our belts;
budget protection needs to occur,"
said GSC Financial Officer and
chemical engineering student Ryan
Peacock. "We might want to encour
age groups to cut back five to 10 per
cent of their budgets."
While concern has not turned to
panic, many members encouraged
the council to begin planning now so
that next year's budget, likely to be
under further financial strain, will
remain sound and flexible toward
financial aid.
"We're not in trouble yet we'll
know more in March," Peacock said.
"But we need to concentrate on
improving our budget for the next fis
cal years."
Many members welcomed
monthly budget projections from the
GSC Funding Committee.
Mausoleum Party
The GSC's budget woes carried
on to the Mausoleum Party, which
was brought to the council by the jun
ior class leaders. The party, in plan
ning since August, has barely sur
vived a series of budget cuts reducing
its budget from well over $14,000 to
$lO,OOO. Having exhausted most
other options, the class leaders made
their case to an apprehensive board,
asking for $l,OOO.
After being turned away by many
Stanford organizations, the junior
class has had to dip into its general
budget for funding for the party. The
juniors added that money is still
needed to cover transportation,
mostly for underclassmen, from
numerous points on campus to the
mausoleum.
Various members objected to this
potential use of GSC funds, arguing
that buses could be cut from the
overall budget in order to allow
funding toward other areas. The jun
iors countered that a substantial
number of potential attendees had
made it clear they would cease to
attend the party if transportation
was not provided.

The GSC, not convinced that
$l,OOO of its funds would be appro
priately used toward the party,
instead provided several non-mone
tary options, including having an
entrance price of $3.
"[The GSC] might only be able to
give you suggestions on massaging
the system because that's a lot of
money," Peacock said.
ASSU Vice President Jay de la
Torre TO offered to the Mausoleum
Party planners the recently added
ASSU undergraduate fund, which
would be used toward all campus
inclusion parties, including Full
Moon on the Quad and the
Mausoleum Party.

Addenda
The council ultimately approved
allotting $5OO toward the party.
While most of the meeting
catered to discussion and debate on
the current financial state of the
GSC, other matters were discussed
and voted on.
Last week's elected GSC business
representative unexpectedly quit the
position, so a new representative,
Janet Zhou, was unanimously
approved after presenting various
past experiences in leading and unit
ing polarizing campus groups.
Changes to the upcoming
Graduate Student Party were also
discussed, with the programming co
chairs bringing up the possibility of
changing the venue to the San
Francisco Computer Museum or the
California Academy of Sciences.
