## Budget cuts rule in GSC discussion Reduction of $50,000 hinders programming 
### VIVIANA ARCIA 
The Graduate Student Council's
Wednesday meeting was dominated
by an issue much of Stanford is
attempting to overcome: budget cuts.
Recent cuts by the University
administration have now begun to
force some of its members to begin
taking a closer look at finances and to
try to curb a significant portion of
their loans. This new plan influenced
the council's aid toward one of
Stanford's major events: the
Mausoleum Party.
The council, announcing that over
the course of the next few years a
budget reduction of $50,000 would
significantly affect the amount of
financial aid they grant, concentrated
much of their meeting on discussing
possible plans to keep their aid, as well
as their overall budget, within limit.
As of now, the council has just
over $14,000 after allocating $5,000 at
Wednesday's meeting to the
Graduate Thanksgiving Party, mostly
going toward catering and, as GSC
Thanksgiving Party representative
and geological and earth sciences stu
dent Mary Van der Hoven put it,
"providing a festive and party atmos
phere,"
Members asserted that in order
for the council to stay afloat until
spring quarter, student groups asking
for aid will have to be handled on a
case by case basis, and the GSC must
maintain objectivity toward every
one.
"We need to tighten our belts;
budget protection needs to occur,"
said GSC Financial Officer and
chemical engineering student Ryan
Peacock. "We might want to encour
age groups to cut back five to 10 per
cent of their budgets."
While concern has not turned to
panic, many members encouraged
the council to begin planning now so
that next year's budget, likely to be
under further financial strain, will
remain sound and flexible toward
financial aid.
"We're not in trouble yet we'll
know more in March," Peacock said.
