## STANFORD DANCE MARATHON EXTENDS DEADLINE 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford Dance Marathon has
extended its registration deadline
to Nov. 1, allowing more students
the opportunity to raise money for
HIV/AIDS awareness. Already,

828 people have registered for the
24-hour fundraising event.
Influenced to postpone the sign
up by the growing number of stu
dents who have expressed a desire
to participate this year, marathon
organizers now hope to reach a
goal of 1,000 dancers this year.
"I think there's no reason we
can't hit 1,000 24-hour dancers,"
said Campus Director Bill Loundy
in a Stanford Dance Marathon
press release, "It was a pipe-dream
when we first mentioned that num
ber in the spring."

In its sixth year running, the
marathon already breaks past
records in sign-ups.
"We're incredibly pleased with
our registration results I think
DM is finally at the point at which
we're a Stanford tradition, some
thing everyone needs to do before
they graduate," said Event
Director Lia Bonamassa in the
same release.
Following the trend of past
years, freshmen currently represent
the largest demographic of regis
tered students.
