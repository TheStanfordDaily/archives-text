# 'Hope' artist lied
## Stanford Fair Use Project attorneys back case 
### AIMEE MILES 
Stanford Fair Use Project attorneys rep
resenting "HOPE" artist Shepard Fairey have
said they will continue to provide legal counsel
in his copyright case, despite Fairey's recent
admission that he lied in court about which
photograph he used to create his iconic cam
paign portrait of Barack Obama.
Fairey, who designed the red, white and
beige stenciled image when the former senator
was a candidate for the presidency in 2008,
preemptively filed suit against the Associated
Press in February for a declaratory judgment
stating that his use of their photograph as a ref
erence for his poster constituted fair use under
U.S. copyright law.
The AP previously asserted that Fairey
should have obtained a license before using its
image, and responded in March with a coun
tersuit seeking damages for copyright infringe
ment.
One of Fairey's legal arguments against the
AP asserted that the news agency had misiden
tified the reference photograph named in its
countersuit a claim Fairey recently conced
ed was false.
In a statement released Oct. 16, Fairey
wrote, "Throughout the case, there has been a
question as to which Mannie Garcia photo I
used as a reference to design the HOPE image
... While I initially believed that the photo I
referenced was a different one, I discovered
early on in the case that I was wrong. In an
attempt to conceal my mistake I submitted
false images and deleted other images."
Fairey went on to apologize for his "lapse in

judgment." He also expressed regret that his
actions could distract from the "real focus" of
his case, which he claimed is "the right to fair
use so that all artists can create freely."
The revelation led to early reporting by the
AP that Fairey's attorneys had withdrawn
from his case as a result of his dishonesty a
claim also proved to be untrue.
Anthony Falzone, executive director of the
Stanford Fair Use Project and one of the attor
neys representing Fairey, declined to comment
on the status of Fairey's case. Falzone instead
referred The Daily to a written statement first
provided to the Los Angeles Times on Oct. 17.
"We have not withdrawn as counsel for
Shepard Fairey, and none of his other lawyers
have, either," the statement read.
The statement also expressed the attorneys'
intention to withdraw their representation "at
the appropriate time," but stressed that the
decision to do so had nothing to do with "the
underlying merits" of the case.
"We believe as strongly as ever in the fair
use and free expression issues at the center of
this case, and believe Shepard will prevail on
those issues," the statement concluded. "We
hope this unfortunate situation does not
obscure those issues."
Fairey's statement indicated that he noti
fied the AP and the photographer, Garcia,
that he intended to amend his court pleadings
to reflect his acknowledgement of which pho
tograph he referenced for the portrait. The
case is still pending.
