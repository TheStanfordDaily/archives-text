## BEYOND THE BUBBLE Graduates battle the job market 
### MELANIE SCHEIBLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Erich Wolodzko 'O9, a computer
science major, enjoyed the securi
ty of having a job waiting for him
upon graduation.

"I got offered my job halfway into fall
quarter, which is early by looking-for-full
time-jobs standards," said Wolodzko, who
has a position at Microsoft in his specialty
developing programming tools to help

other software designers.
Not everyone had that luxury.
1,646 students received bachelor's
degrees from Stanford in June of 2009,
according to the University Registrar.
Thirty-six percent of 2009 graduates
planned to go to on to graduate school at
the time of graduation, according to the
Career Development Center (CDC). The
rest chose from a myriad of options
post-graduate fellowships, exciting new
jobs or rigorous job searches.
Thirteen members of the Class of 2009

are pursuing international studies through
Fulbright Scholarships this year. Their
projects range from completing a collec
tion of short stories in the Philippines to
researching media and democracy in
Uganda. Other grads received Huang
Teaching Fellowships to work on issues of
education in the U.S. and China.
Although the climate for securing full
time employment is not optimal, many stu
dents, including Wolodzko, have successful
ly pursued this option.
"What we make is to programming as
Microsoft Word is to writing an essay,"
Wolodzko said of his duties.
He landed the job by making contact
with Microsoft early, and going out on a
limb. Originally, Wolodzko turned down a
summer internship at Microsoft during his
senior year for another internship that
turned out to be dissatisfying.
"I actually called them [Microsoft] up
before I finished the other internship and
asked for an interview," Wolodzko said. "I
interviewed with them really, really early,
before the economy even crashed, and I had

an offer before the hiring freeze."
Eric Showen 'O9, a public policy major,
will be beginning as an associate consultant
at Bain and Company a global business
and strategy consulting firm in January.
He accepted the job offer in mid-November,
deferring his acceptance to Harvard Law
School.
"I feel very fortunate because I have the
best of both worlds, having time off to trav
el and to have a job when I come back,"
Showen said.
He got the job through the normal
recruiting process, submitting his resume,
and undergoing a rigorous round of inter

views.
"Bain was always my first choice, and I
could see myself working there for a long
time," Showen added.
Other students have graduated from
Stanford with good grades and professional
experience, but without a job a paying
job, that is.
"I would characterize [the job search] as
a full time job," said Victoria Harman 'O9, a
Classics major.
Harman moved back to New York City,
which she calls home, after graduating from
Stanford. Searching for a job related to busi
ness in Latin America, she found resources

to help find a job there limited.
"Almost all of the jobs posted on the
Stanford site, or jobs that alums or the CDC
will help you with, are jobs in California,"
Harman noted.
Her main goal at this point is to keep her
options open. This is one reason Harman is
also applying to graduate school, where she
would like to earn a master's in Latin
American studies.
Lance Choy, director of the Career
Development Center (CDC), observed that
the job market tightened this year. Job and
internship postings were down by 25 per
cent, so the positions became fewer and the

application processes more competitive.
Tliis led to difficulties for many students.
"In 2008, 50 percent of graduating stu
dents found a job within one to two
months," Choy said. "For this class it was 39
percent."
Fewer students than last year accepted
jobs they considered "satisfactory," accord
ing to CDC surveys. They are also coming
back more frequently Choy estimates
about 10 or 20 percent more than last year
returning for help from the CDC.
