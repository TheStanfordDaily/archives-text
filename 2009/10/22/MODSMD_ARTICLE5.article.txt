## Fallen trees confuse maintenance staff 
### JANE LEPHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The old saying asks, "If a tree
falls in the forest and no one is
around to hear it, did it make a
sound?" New question: What if
three trees fall down around
campus?
In the span of one week, earli
er this month, the Stanford
Police Department Public
Bulletin reported that 12 cars
were damaged when trees fell in
three separate incidents.
A large oak tree fell in the
grove area at Arboretum Road
and Arboretum Grove during a
Stanford football game on Sept.
26, causing damage to nine
parked vehicles. Three days later,
on the 100 block of El Camino
Real, another oak tree fell

because of high winds and land
ed on a parked vehicle. And on
Oct. 5, a large eucalyptus tree fell
onto two more parked vehicles
in a parking lot on Escondido
Road.
While the Sept. 29 incident
was attributed to high winds in
the area, the cause of the two
other trees falling remains large
ly unanswered.
"Sometimes, trees just fall
down," said police spokesperson
Bill Larson. "It could be related
to the amount of rainfall
we're beginning an El Nino year
and other different variables,
like the lifespan of trees, age, dis
ease, etc. But I don't remember
[that many] trees falling down in
my eight years here."

Three separate incidents of fallen trees in the span of one week resulted in the damage of 12 cars,
leaving campus grounds maintenance to question the cause of the unusually high number.
