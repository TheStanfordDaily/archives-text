## Fallen trees confuse maintenance staff 
### JANE LEPHAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The old saying asks, "If a tree
falls in the forest and no one is
around to hear it, did it make a
sound?" New question: What if
three trees fall down around
campus?
In the span of one week, earli
er this month, the Stanford
Police Department Public
Bulletin reported that 12 cars
were damaged when trees fell in
three separate incidents.
A large oak tree fell in the
grove area at Arboretum Road
and Arboretum Grove during a
Stanford football game on Sept.
26, causing damage to nine
parked vehicles. Three days later,
on the 100 block of El Camino
Real, another oak tree fell

because of high winds and land
ed on a parked vehicle. And on
Oct. 5, a large eucalyptus tree fell
onto two more parked vehicles
in a parking lot on Escondido
Road.
While the Sept. 29 incident
was attributed to high winds in
the area, the cause of the two
other trees falling remains large
ly unanswered.
"Sometimes, trees just fall
down," said police spokesperson
Bill Larson. "It could be related
to the amount of rainfall
we're beginning an El Nino year
and other different variables,
like the lifespan of trees, age, dis
ease, etc. But I don't remember
[that many] trees falling down in
my eight years here."

Three separate incidents of fallen trees in the span of one week resulted in the damage of 12 cars,
leaving campus grounds maintenance to question the cause of the unusually high number.
Still, heavy rainfall and strong
winds last Tuesday were a cause for
concern. Calls to Buildings &
Grounds Maintenance Director of
Operations Robert Carpenter were
promptly answered with, "We need
to deal with this storm right now."
University Grounds Manager
Ted Tucholski emphasized that
proper maintenance and meticulous
steps were being taken to make sure
that campus trees remain rooted,
and the fact that trees were falling
down was very unusual.
"It was more of a random anom
aly," Tucholski said of the fact that
three trees had fallen around the
University area in a single week.
"Trees don't fall down."
"We have 40,000 trees around
campus, and we maintain quite a few
of those," he continued. "We survey
around the areas, prune the trees,
etc. We have a staff of 10 tree work
ers, and during the storm, the
Grounds crew made sure drains
were clear of debris."
Although Tucholski reiterated
the peculiarity of the tree downfalls
earlier this month, once in a while,
trees do fall and on cars.
While tree branches and trees
themselves have fallen on vehicles

in the past, Joanne Thorne, Risk
Management administrative associ
ate, indicated that determining Uni
versity liability for these accidents is
not a straight-forward procedure.
"It's definitely a case-by-case
basis," Thorne said. "We have a
claims adjuster who works with the
Stanford arborist and directly with
the person's auto insurance. It's a
strictly confidential process."
Although no more trees fell dur
ing last week's downpour, data from
New York City's Parks & Recre
ation's Urban Forest Management
Plan indicated that broken branches
and entire trees could fall down dur
ing inclement weather. The public
release also stressed the importance
of regular inspections as a line of de
fense in tree maintenance.

"Inspections should include
close scrutiny of the target popula
tion for a number of tree health
measures, including decay, pests and
diseases, unhealthy growing condi
tions and vandalism," the report
stated.

As of press time, Max Pinedo, the
University Grounds Service Group's
tree crew supervisor, could not be
reached for comment.
