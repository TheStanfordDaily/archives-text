## Hospital bans young visitors New policy has been 'relatively smooth,' says health official 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
On a warm Thursday night last week, Stanford
Hospital's emergency room was bustling. Nurses
shuffled quickly, shuttling patients behind closed
doors, as doctors hustled from room to room mak
ing quick assessments.
During all this, loved ones, young and old, sat in
the waiting room with worry etched across their
faces. Yet, these concerns were hidden, quite literal
ly, by facemasks, one of the latest hospital interven
tions in the spread of HINI influenza.
Continuing on this crusade against the prolifera
tion of the virus within hospital walls, administrators
recently implemented new visitation restrictions,
which, among other things, would severely limit the
presence of youth visitors in places like the E.R. On
Monday, both Stanford Hospital and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital (LCPH) began policies
completely banning non-patient visitors under the
age of 16.
With flu season in full swing, hospital officials
believe the ban will effectively reduce the possibili
ty of the HINI virus spreading to at-risk patients
already hospitalized for other ailments. The only
exceptions to the policy are visitors of patients with
terminal illnesses or extenuating circumstances,
decided on a case-by-case basis by hospital staff.
While there are currently no national specifica
tions for age-specific visitation bans, administrators
decided to take a proactive stance, as explained by
Pediatrics Prof. Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, who spe
cializes in pediatric infectious diseases.
"In this country so far, the median age of HINI
infections is 16, which means that 50 percent of peo
ple infected are 16 and under," she said. "Fifty-three
percent of hospitalizations for HINI are for
patients under 25. Younger people are at higher risk
for this epidemic and we don't understand why, but
that is the case."
Maldonado went on to cite
other reasons for the arbitrary age
restriction, including the fact that
children could be carriers of the
diseases without even knowing it.
She believes that children could
transmit the HINI virus more easi
ly than older patients, even if they
are at the time asymptomatic.
According to Maldonado, the
disease can take one to four days to
incubate in the body, and it may be
as long as 24 hours before an
infected individual starts to devel
op symptoms. The doctor also felt
that it was simply harder to deal
with young children for the sake of
disease prevention.
"In terms of logistics, it's hard to
have kids keep hands off face or

wash their heads, the little things,"
Maldonado said. "It's also hard to
mask little kids because they'll just
rip those things off."
Though Santa Clara County
Public Health Department did not
actively encourage the age restric
tion on visitors, officials there rec
ognized the reasons behind the
decision.

"The hospital is trying to limit
infected people who are contagious
before displaying symptoms, espe
cially in high-risks with possibility
for complications," said Dr. Julie
Higashi, deputy health officer with
the county. "We understand what
they're doing and why they're
doing it."
But for Santa Clara County,
these bans are by no means new.
According to Joy Alexiou, public
information officer for the Public
Health Department, Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center has previ
ously had a policy of not allowing

visitors under the age of 14 present
even before the HINI scare.
So far, at Stanford Hospital and
LCPH, the new policy has been
implemented easily into current
hospital practices.
"We started the policy on
Monday and it's been relatively
smooth," Maldonado said. "I think
in general people have been under
standing."
As for ending the restriction,
Maldonado could only estimate a
general time period. "We're think
ing it will last through the end of
the flu season, whenever that is,"
she said. "We will be reassessing
the situation until then. However,
right now it's the peak season for
respiratory viruses in kids anyway .
.. and I'm thinking that we're not
going to change that policy for
now."

Precautionary measures against the HINI virus have led to a recent ban preventing people under the age
of 16 from visiting patients at both the Stanford Hospital and the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
