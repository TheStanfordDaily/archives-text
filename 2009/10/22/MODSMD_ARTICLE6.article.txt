## Hospital bans young visitors New policy has been 'relatively smooth,' says health official 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
On a warm Thursday night last week, Stanford
Hospital's emergency room was bustling. Nurses
shuffled quickly, shuttling patients behind closed
doors, as doctors hustled from room to room mak
ing quick assessments.
During all this, loved ones, young and old, sat in
the waiting room with worry etched across their
faces. Yet, these concerns were hidden, quite literal
ly, by facemasks, one of the latest hospital interven
tions in the spread of HINI influenza.
Continuing on this crusade against the prolifera
tion of the virus within hospital walls, administrators
recently implemented new visitation restrictions,
which, among other things, would severely limit the
presence of youth visitors in places like the E.R. On
Monday, both Stanford Hospital and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital (LCPH) began policies
completely banning non-patient visitors under the
age of 16.
With flu season in full swing, hospital officials
believe the ban will effectively reduce the possibili
ty of the HINI virus spreading to at-risk patients
already hospitalized for other ailments. The only
exceptions to the policy are visitors of patients with
terminal illnesses or extenuating circumstances,
decided on a case-by-case basis by hospital staff.
While there are currently no national specifica
tions for age-specific visitation bans, administrators
decided to take a proactive stance, as explained by
Pediatrics Prof. Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, who spe
cializes in pediatric infectious diseases.
"In this country so far, the median age of HINI
infections is 16, which means that 50 percent of peo
ple infected are 16 and under," she said. "Fifty-three
percent of hospitalizations for HINI are for
patients under 25. Younger people are at higher risk
for this epidemic and we don't understand why, but
that is the case."
