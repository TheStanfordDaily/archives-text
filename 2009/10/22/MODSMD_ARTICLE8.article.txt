## Pre-Med Pulse Future docs weigh in on healthcare reform 
### STEPHANIE LIOU 
Everyone knows about the big ones, like Organic Chemistry,
the MCATs or Chem 31X. But besides these well-publicized
obstacles to pursuing the noble career of medicine, a new
and rather unsettling issue faces pre-meds of today.
America is notorious for its bloated, broken healthcare system.
After a landmark election, constant debates about healthcare reform
followed. But behind the promises and the red tape lies the reality
that the face of American healthcare may change dramatically within
the next decade. Current pre-meds cannot be sure of how they will be
paid, how much they will be paid, who they will be required to treat
or who their bosses will be.
Indeed, under new insurance plans and reallocation of available
resources, doctors may be required to assume new, unprecedented
roles in the care process. Deciding who receives what care and in
what order may become a huge part of doctors' jobs.
"Once care is no longer determined by who can afford it, decision
making will become the doctor's responsibility, and pre-medical stu
dents must ask themselves if they are willing to take on that role," said
sociology and human biology Prof. Donald Barr. "The key factor for
physicians, then, becomes integrity."
So how, if at all, has this affected Stanford's pre-meds?
"It hasn't affected my decision to pursue medicine as a career, but
it has made me a little more wary of what I'll be facing if I decide to
go into practice," said Grace Laidlaw 'lO. "I think no matter what the
final outcome is, it's going to introduce more bureaucracy into the
medical system."
However, Laidlaw also echoed the optimistic sentiments of many
students.
"If the reform succeeds in making healthcare more accessible and
affordable to most Americans, I'd be happy to take on some bureau
cracy-induced stress," she said.
"If anything, the current possibility of healthcare reform has made
me more excited to be going into medicine," agreed Kelly Fero 'lO.
Increased focus on preventive medicine and primary care, which
have been heavily touted by President Obama, are possibilities that
excite many Stanford pre-meds.
"While both drugs and surgery save millions of lives per year, we
ultimately need a paradigm shift in the way Americans view the link

between diet and disease," said Kaylin Pennington 'O9. Pennington
plans to pursue pediatrics or primary care, currently two of the lowest
paid fields of medicine.
While the glamorous lifestyles of TV doctors may become obso
lete, altruistic souls such as Pennington just might reap unexpected
rewards. Increased demand and encouragement for primary care
physicians could increase their salaries, balanced by significant reduc
tion of the lucrative incomes currently available to many specialists.
"I would not be surprised if in the next 10 years salaries come
down on average, and the gap is closed between specialists' compen
sation and primary care providers' compensation," Fero said.
Overall, though, median incomes for doctors are likely to decrease.
Without hugely enticing monetary benefits, does medicine still remain
as attractive a career option? For many Stanford students, it has never
been about the cash.
"Money has never influenced my decision to pursue a career in
medicine," Pennington said. "Medicine appealed to me first and fore
most as a vehicle for public service and social change."
Others, while more pragmatic, confirmed that prospects of reduced
income have not deterred them from going pre-med.
"I'd certainly count pay as a benefit of becoming a physician, but
my interest in medicine doesn't stem from money," Laidlaw said. "I'm
in it for the academic interest and for my love of people."
Dr. Barr agreed. "Students should definitely rethink their choice if
it is just based on money," he said.
But in the face of such uncertainty, an unexpected silver lining has
emerged.
"This is an excellent opportunity to really ask yourself why you
want to be a doctor, and to reassess your own motivations," Dr. Barr
said.
So, pre-meds, both current and potential, it may be worth
while to take some time to think: Is medicine the right
path? Do potential reforms in the healthcare system
affect your motivation? And if you find yourself
struggling with these questions, don't forget there
are always alternative options. As Toronto
native Justin Lam 'l3 pointed out, "I'm
just going to practice in Canada."
