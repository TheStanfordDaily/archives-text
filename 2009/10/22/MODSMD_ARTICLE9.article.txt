## SCIENCE & TECH Physicists calculate alternative universes 
### TINA ZHENG 
Two of Stanford's physicists. Professor Andrei
Linde and postdoctoral researcher Vitaly
Vanchurin, have garnered recent celebrity status in
the scientific community for their recent discovery
of the maximum number of alternate universes.
In their newly published paper entitled "How
many universes are in the multiverse?" the authors
present their take on the maximum number of
alternate universes to be: 10 A 10 A 10 A 7.
Linde and Vanchurin had been working on the
project for two months after extensive discussion
dating back to a year ago, though Linde has been
researching inflationary cosmology since 1981.
Vanchurin refers to the amount of attention he has
received as "surprising."
"I didn't expect this much reaction," Linde
agreed.
Both Linde and Vanchurin don't describe the
process as technologically intensive.
"It was necessary to understand the concepts
deeply," Linde said. He explained the theory of
inflationary cosmology, a theory where fluctua
tions created the entire universe.
"It seems like very interesting science fiction
how can we create these huge galaxies by tiny
quantum fluctuations?"
Yet Linde describes this as the most accepted
theory regarding the creation of the universe.
Eternal inflation produces new parts repeatedly, a
theory concordant with the predominant string

theory. These new parts can have completely dif
ferent properties.
"The whole universe can be divided into enor
mous numbers of universes where in one of them
there is normal physics and in another, there are
completely different roles and interactions," Linde
said.
Vanchurin started his research by asking the
question of how many distinguishable universes
exist in pursuit of answering a more complicated
question: what probabilities can be assigned to the
existence of those universes.
"Even though the universe is generally infinite
in the mathematical sense, if we only concentrate
on the locally distinguishable things, maybe this
number will reduce to be finite," Vanchurin
explained.
Two important cutoffs guaranteed the finite
nature of their number, according to Vanchurin
the acceleration of the expanding universe, called
the "cosmological constant" and the "eternal infla
tion cutoff." The two did calculations using both.
"Calculating using the internal inflation cutoff,
it seems to give us the number 10 A 10 A 10 A 7. You
would not be able to see more before you end up
in a black hole," Vanchurin said. "And after that,
you would collapse."
The concept of the multiverse consisting of
alternate universes was not always widely accept
ed.
"Most people thought that physics everywhere
was the same it was the old prevalent belief,"
Linde said. "Starting in 2003, string theorists start-

Ed working on the concept of the multiverse and
that has allowed us to start counting."
Some students doubt the now-popular concept
of the multiverse altogether.
"I personally find the concept intriguing, but I
think we should be wary of scientists who can use
it as away to write things off and stop looking for
deeper answers to physical phenomena," Lauren
Janas 'l2 said.
Linde stressed that their estimate may not be
comprehensible to the human brain.
"Our brain is the final computer to which all the
data about the universe is going," she said.
Linde estimates that the brain's limit to how
many alternate states can be processes is
10 A 10 A l6, far less thanl0 A 10 A 10 A 7.
"If we concentrate on the information our brain
can acquire, we're going from real physics to a lit
tle bit more philosophical issues," Vanchurin said.
Some Stanford students are not entirely con
vinced of Vanchurin and Linde's complicated
methods.
"I'm quite skeptical," Frank Liu 'l3 said. "I
think it's hard to tell how many universes there
exactly are."
Nevertheless, Vanchurin claims, the maximum
number of states the brain can process still pres
ents a definite bound analogous to the two other
mathematical cutoffs. Vanchurin hopes that in the
future, they can work with modular observations
to confirm their findings.
