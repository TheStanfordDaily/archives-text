# FACULTY SENATE
## Undergrad experience to be assessed Commission will make a recommendation by 2012 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
Short-term and long-term efforts
to further modernize Stanford's edu
cational experience are on the way for
students.
The Faculty Senate heard Thurs
day from Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education John Bravman
about a multi-year effort to remake
the Stanford undergraduate experi
ence, as well as from University Reg
istrar Thomas Black and University
Librarian Mike Keller regarding a
move to an all-digital process for sub
mitting and accessing dissertations.
Bravman announced that a com
mission, called the Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford
(SUES), will take a comprehensive
look at undergraduate education
from 2009 to 2011 and make final rec
ommendations about academic pro
gramming by the 2011-12 year.
The multi-year assessment will
take a holistic approach, with a focus
on requirements at the University
level, balancing the relationship be
tween individual programs of study
and relating of academic guidelines to
Stanford's overall goals.
Freshman year will be a particular
focus for SUES, according to Brav
man. He pointed to a constraining
number of expectations facing incom
ing students, saying of the intersecting
requirements, "this is not integrated
the way it should be."
"In particular, our freshman year is
too packed, it's over-prescribed" he

said. "We preach practically a gospel
of 'explore, explore, explore,' but then
we pack that curriculum, and so it's
very hard to do that. That's why we
have to think about the whole rather
than the excellence of the parts that
we have that our faculty has built."
Bravman compared the effort di
rectly to two major, University-wide
initiatives focused on education: The
1968 Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) and the 1994 Commission on
Undergraduate Education (CUE).
He emphasized that SUES will seek
to consolidate and monitor the rela
tionships between many of the posi
tive components of undergraduate
education achieved in prior efforts.
Yet much has changed since the
most recent report, with Bravman
presenting SUES as necessary after a
period of transition on both the cam
pus and in the world.
"Students have really changed," he
added. "I don't see how one can look
at these often titanic changes and say
that it's not time to take some kind of
comprehensive look again at what
we're doing for our students, what are
goals are, what students should expect
of Stanford, and what they will get out
of Stanford when they leave."
While the long-term impact of
SUES will not be clear for years, a
more immediate change is on its way
for graduate students in the form of
electronic submission of theses and
their digitally-based distribution.
Black pointed to excessive costs
for graduate students in submitting,
printing and then accessing as a main
impetus for overhauling the end of
the dissertation process.
"The way I look at it, there's got to
be a better way," Black said.
Keller said that electronic submis

sion would also open up new possibil
ities for students in presenting their
finished work, and connected these
outcomes to earlier discussion of
changing landscape for student writ
ing.

"By permitting, yeah, even en
couraging, graduate students to sub
mit their theses and dissertations in
electronic form, several important
outcomes should be realized," Keller
said.

Electronic submission will allow
for the inclusion of embedded media,
such as sound and media, as well as a
greater ability to use color, graphics,
hyperlinks and special character sets.
Keller cited the many benefits of
fered by digitization for the distribu
tion and dissemination of graduate
students' work to the worldwide com
munity.

"What we have is a big expansion
to new knowledge as generated by
our students," Keller said.
Provost John Etchemendy added
in later discussion that the change
would relate to Stanford's central
goal, saying, "Our mission is the pro
duction of knowledge for the benefit
of all-
Black also said that undergradu
ates could also eventually benefit
from the transition.
"We can extend these to the hon
ors theses, and of course to the Mas
ter's theses," Black said.
The reports from Bravman, Black
and Keller led to further discussion
from faculty at the Senate session, but
no obstacles were raised to the further
progress of either initiative.
