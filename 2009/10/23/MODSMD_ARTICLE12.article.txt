## EDITORIAL Accessibility is a right for all students 
### 
Accessibility is not just a privilege for
Stanford students; it is a right. Walk
ing by certain dorms at Stanford,
this conviction seems evident from the
strategically placed wheelchair ramps to
the automatic doors, a representation of the
University's recent commitment to making
its expansive campus manageable for all.
Yet, this sentiment has been lost among
other buildings that do not offer universal
access despite their construction decades
ago.
It is the opinion of the Editorial Board
that, in the case of housing at 102 Hoskins
Center, students who were given the false
impression that apartments were wheel
chair accessible were deprived of a basic
right, reasonable and previously promised
by the housing administration. This is a mo
ment in time not only to consider, but to
honor the rights of disabled students and
the obligations made clear and at times
left unfulfilled by the University.
The issue of accessibility for all students
across Stanford has been raised off and on
throughout the years. In the past, alumni
have responded with generous and desper
ately needed gifts to increase the accessibil
ity of certain buildings on campus, such as
the 1992 gift that allowed for improvements
to be made at the Law School. Beyond the
actual monetary support, the fund created
by the Folger & Levin firm allowed for the
University to make a strong and visible
statement about the right to universal ac
cess. Now, 12 years later, the Hoskins Cen
ter situation seems to point to a problemat
ic stagnancy from the administration in
tackling this consistently important part of
protocol, mainly building upgrades.

Beyond the issue of the University fail
ing to act on these accessibility obstacles is
the issue of students failing to make their
voices heard on behalf of their fellow stu
dents. On a campus where students are will
ing to rally on behalf of custodial wages and
gay marriage rights, student activists should
also take time to champion the basic acces
sibility rights of those students with disabil
ities. Furthermore, it is vital to remember
that one of the greatest accessibility obsta
cles for students does not originate in poor
administrative choices, but rather in those
of other undergraduates and graduates
going about their daily routine. Improperly
parked student bikes impede critical
ground paths for disabled students, perhaps
the most troubling and Ã¼biquitous way in
which the disabled population of the stu
dent body is finding themselves viewing ac
cessibility as a "sometimes" rather than an
"always." Whatever the case, these barriers
to accessibility whether to a residence or
to a classroom are unacceptable. We
were all admitted to the same university,
and the entirety of the University should be
physically accessible to all.
While all areas of the University budget
are being hit with budget cuts, the Editorial
Board believes there is little excuse for in
action or delay on this issue. Those students
who have managed in spite of thAeir dis
abilities to attend Stanford deserve to be
given access to every part of the campus to
which the average enrolled student is able
to access. When a building improvement
makes the difference between what is avail
able to a student and what is out of reach, it
is something much more than just construc
tion.
