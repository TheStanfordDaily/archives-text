# THE 						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## The 						Value of Humanities 
### Shelly Gao 
Providing a superior education in the lib
eral arts has been a cornerstone of
Stanford University since its inception.
During this alumni reunion and homecom
ing, it seems timely to reflect upon the
tremendous strides that this institution has
made toward realizing the vision of its
founders and its dedication to continual re
examination and renewal.
President John Hennessy spoke about the
humanities as the core of a great university at
his inauguration in 2000, and promised a
recommitment to this field in a column pub
lished in the Stanford Alumni Magazine two
years ago. However, this conversation seems
to have come to a standstill. In a time of eco
nomic downturn, it is essential to revisit the
question regarding the value of humanities
in a university education.
Let me make clear that I do not seek to di
minish the importance of sciences or engi
neering. These are critical to spearheading
the entrepreneurial and pioneering spirit of
Stanford and to producing graduates with
the boldness to take risks and pursue innova
tion. However, there is a tendency for hu
manities to be neglected in an institution
known for its prowess in the technological
and scientific arenas.
Although Leland and Jane Stanford
hoped to produce useful and practical citi
zens, they recognized the significance of a lib
eral education as a goal of an undergraduate
education.
Leland Stanford wrote, "I think I have no
ticed that technically educated boys do not
make the most successful businessmen. The
imagination needs to be cultivated and de
veloped to assure success in life. A man will
never construct anything he cannot achieve,"
Rarely do we ask ourselves today: What is
the purpose of going to college? What does a
liberal education mean? The true end cannot
merely be for the sake of attaining employ
ment. Evaluating our four years at Stanford
by purely utilitarian standards is rather un
satisfying. What about learning for its own
sake? Does anyone still believe that the rea
son for attending university is to "illuminate"
and "enlarge the mind"?
There is a tendency to develop expertise
in a single discipline at the expense of a
broader humanistic scholarship at the mod
ern academy. However, it is study of the hu
manities that provides the foundation for
more specialized pursuits. It is through ex
amining Shakespeare's plays Plato's "Re
public" and Homer's "Iliad" that helps us ar
rive at a coherent view of the world, as well
as some kind of truth that unites the human
experience.
An education in humanities disciplines is
critical to developing global leaders who will

be grappling with problems that are growing
in complexity and ambiguity. Indeed, in the
aftermath of the financial crisis, business
schools around the country are scrambling to
ensure ethics are a compulsory part of the
MBA curriculum. Moral, cultural, historical
and political issues embedded in a liberal arts
education have become increasingly perti
nent in contemporary debates ranging from
scientific cloning to development economics.
Stanford has made significant steps to
ward reprioritizing humanities in the recent
few years, whether it is direction toward
multidisciplinary teaching or funding for hu
manities scholars to pursue research. How
ever, more can be done. In a time of job
scarcity and economic uncertainty, there is a
decline in engagement and appreciation for
humanities.
Good freshman advising is critical to
helping students broaden their perspective:
Understand that majoring in philosophy
does not eliminate your chance to attend
business schools and studying English does
not exclude a future career as a doctor.
The current version of the traditional core
curriculum after five evolutions since 1923,
known as IHUM, is perceived by most fresh
men as an unnecessary burden rather than an
authentic immersion in "the study of human
thought, values, beliefs, creativity and cul
ture." Indeed, greater investment should be
made in offering discussion-style courses in
humanities disciplines as introductory or
higher level seminars. More flexibility in the
number of units and grading options would
enhance the appeal of taking such classes.
Of greater importance however, is a fun
damental shift in the mentality of the stu
dents. Stanford students are a pragmatic
bunch. We are action-oriented individuals,
driven by impulses to implement and seek
real-world application. Whether it is pressure
from parents questioning the value of their
quarter-million-dollar investment or from
"hard-headed, practical" advisors arguing
that college serves as an acquisition of mar
ketable skills, it is so easy to ignore the hu
manities.
Stanford students, however, are re
deemed by their desire to grapple with and
affect greater forces than themselves. No one
is content to live an ordinary life. We all seek
how to make the best use of our talents to ful
fill the purpose of a Stanford education as
outlined in the founding grant "to pro
mote the public welfare by exercising an in
fluence on behalf of humanity and civiliza
tion." Humanities may just have the answer.
