## "Malcolm Gladwell polishes a turd" 
### P.G. Mann 
A page from Malcolm Gladwell's moleskine:

I haven't slept for days. No idea when I last
ate. My mind is on fire. Synthesizing all
that data has turned my head into a fur
nace. Seriously, my ears feel hot. Correction:
It's my hair that is on fire. I must have nodded
off on the stove again. It looks like my snap
decision to work in the kitchen today was one
of those snap decisions with adverse effects.
Which only confirms my thesis: Sometimes
the decisions made in the blink of an eye have
positive outcomes, though, in certain cases,
the outcome is negative. That's the "50/50 Ef
fect."
Or consider it this way. My great great
grandfather Clemens came to this country as
an indentured servant in 1773, employed as a
grease monger on the estate of a prominent
Rhode Island rum merchant. The savage
Highlander that he was, and Rhode Island
winters being what they were, he acquired a
habit of loitering in his lord's kitchen and
warming the underside of his kilt on the
wood-burning stove. Kitchen loitering be
came a tradition in my family, passed down
through the generations. Pair that with the
fear of scissors that my mother instilled in me
at a young age, a residue from the Great Scis
sors Uprising in Western Pennsylvania as
it turns out, all sons of Western Pennsylvanian
mothers who grew up during the Great Scis
sors Uprising have wild unshorn hair. Then
factor in the nearly 10,000 hours I have spent
at the end of a manic streak dozing off in
strange places.
Seen in that light, it wasn't my guarana-fu
eled gut decision to put my notes in the oven
and set my laptop on the griddle this morning
that turned my hair into a flaming orb. It was
the combination of unique opportunities, his
torical circumstance and habitual behavior
that enabled me to make that seemingly idio
syncratic decision.That's the "Other Stuff Be
sides You Matters Hypothesis," which is all
the rage these days in certain circles of corpo-

rate market I mean, social psychology.
But how can we explain the meteoric rise
of the Floofkin theory? In 1944, philosopher
and accordionist Gabe Floofkin escaped
Nazi-occupied Poland only to fall into the
hands of the Russians. Under suspicion of es
pionage, he was sent to the gulag. There,
under conditions of extreme deprivation and
routine buggery,Floofkin developed his theo
ry of burnished matter. Lacking writing mate
rials, he commissioned a thief to tattoo it on
his body with a rusty screwdriver. Two weeks
later, Flookfin died from tetanus. But his lega
cy would live on.

Mysteriously, his frozen body wound up on
a Vladivostok cargo ship bound for Brazil, fell
off en route and, after months at sea, washed
ashore on Venice Beach. The next morning, a
lifeguard named Eugene Krik, originally
from Odessa, discovered Floofkin's theory
inked across his chest in lewdly stylized Cyril
lic. It read: "You can't polish a turd."
Within weeks, the Floofkin theory went
viral. What started as amusing shower banter
at the lifeguard hut quickly achieved critical
mass and exceeded the tipping point, the point
at which ideas become diseases and it is nec
essary to use the language of epidemiology to
understand cultural change. From its Los An
geles epicenter, the Floofkin theory swiftly in
fected California, ravaged the Midwest and
gave shingles to the entire eastern seaboard.
Children in Cheyenne, grandmothers in Fort
Meyers and news anchors on CNN all conclu
sively endorsed the Floofkin theory. As a re
sult, turd-polishing plummeted, even in New
Jersey. That's a perfect example of the "Some
times Ideas Spread Fast Effect."
But the story doesn't end there. As always,
market research statistics have some really
fascinating insights into how the world works
ones that just might overturn the Floofkin
theory. The advertising industry has long dis
puted the Floofkin theory and has thrown a
lot of money at the social science departments
of major research universities to disprove it.
Researchers at Yale have recently found that
if you put a turd in a box and polish the box,
57 percent of consumers will consider the
turd itself to be polished.
Which leads me to my latest thesis: You re
ally can polish a turd. Except that you can't.
But sometimes you can if you put that turd in
a box, polish the box and find some people
who will believe that the polished box with a
turd in it is, in fact, a polished turd.
