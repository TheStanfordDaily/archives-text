# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor:

One of our main concerns as student lead
ers besides advocating for grad students' con
cerns and promoting a sense of community is
reaching out to our constituents. We are very
grateful that the Stanford Daily reporters at
tempt to help us by covering our weekly GSC
meetings. Unfortunately, sometimes impor
tant facts are lost: This week's Daily article
portrayed the situation of the GSC as one of
financial disaster when the GSC is far from
being in a crisis financially or otherwise.
We would therefore like to straighten out
some facts, so that our fellow grad students
are accurately informed.
Let us first give you some background in
formation on the GSC budget. The GSC's
budget is funded by two sources, the ASSU
endowment (administered by the SSE) and
the graduate student activity fee (paid by
every grad student on a quarterly basis and
voted on once a year in ASSU elections). The
ASSU endowment funds the GSC's political
budget (e.g., advocacy efforts, training of
GSC members) (roughly $45,000 for 2009-
10). The graduate student activity fee is used
for funding large-scale programming events
by the GSC, for example the Grad Formal
and the Fourth of July BBQ (roughly
$115,000 for 2009-10) and for funding gradu
ate student organizations to put on their own
events (roughly 145,000). While the ASSU
endowment experienced a small drop this
year, the GSC's political budget has re
mained largely unaffected. The program
ming/funding budget has been stable due to a
stable activity fee, and it is currently supple
mented by money from the GSC reserves.
As becomes evident, the GSC is not suf
fering a financial crisis, neither in terms of the
political budget nor in terms of the program
ming budget. The issues that were raised re
garding the budget cuts at the meeting this
Wednesday were twofold: 1) Some GSC
members hypothesize that University budget
cuts are probably affecting any supplemen
tary programs that departments run (e.g.,

Happy Hours), and that the GSC might thus
see an increase in demand on funding money
from groups that have previously been fund
ed by departments. So far, the GSC Funding
Committee has not seen much evidence of
this. 2) In order to spend down the GSC Re
serves to a level of one year's grad student ac
tivity fee, a subcommittee consisting of GSC
members and the ASSU financial manager
decided to supplement the funding budget by
roughly 10 percent of the GSC reserves for
the next few years until the desired reserves
level is reached. GSC Financial Officer Ryan
Peacock reminded GSC members at the
meeting that we should plan ahead for the
times when the funding budget will no longer
be supplemented and anticipate that some
funding rules and caps might need to be ad
justed.
The funding decisions that were made at
this week's GSC meeting were not in any way
affected by a sense of financial constraints.
While the GSC manages its budget responsi
bly and relatively conservatively, the GSC
has, to our knowledge, never been forced to
turn away a student organization or project
because of a lack of financial resources. In
stead, the GSC makes decisions based on its
funding policies (which can be reviewed on
the GSC Web site) and on impact dollars (i.e.,
what the grad students are getting for their
money).
At this point, we will review the decisions
from this week's GSC meeting that were ad
dressed in the Daily article.
Thanksgiving: The Thanksgiving Dinner is
generously sponsored by the President's Of
fice ($30,000 this year). In order to give us
more flexibility in creating a festive atmos
phere and in being environmentally con
scious (using real silverware, real table linen,
etc.), the GSC decided to supplement the
event with an additional $5,000 from the pro
gramming budget (a line item, which started
at $25,000 this fiscal year and will have
$14,000 remaining after the allocation to the
Thanksgiving event).
Funding for student groups: According to

GSC funding policies, student organization
events are sponsored up to $lO/person for
dinner, $B/person for lunch and $5/ person for
snacks. Natural Sciences Rep. Bryan Chen
brought up the idea that as the number of
people student groups are feeding increases,
the per-person cost decreases (e.g., perhaps
$lO/person is not necessary for an event with
600 attendees) and that the policies should
perhaps be modified accordingly. GSC Fund
ing Committee Chair Ping Li and Deputy
Chair Justin Brown clarified that these
amounts are caps that actually are reached by
few groups only. In addition, each group's
budget is reviewed carefully at the weekly
funding committee meeting. They acknowl
edged that this concern could be addressed in
the next revision of GSC funding policies at
the end of the fiscal year, but recommended
not to modify policies for the current fiscal
year to keep the process fair for groups that
have yet to apply.
Mausoleum Party: The GSC decided to
fund this party for $5OO instead of the re
quested $l,OOO. This decision was based
mainly on two considerations: 1) The budget
for the Mausoleum Party that was presented
at the GSC Meeting was roughly $lO,OOO.
Budgets for similar large-scale GSC events
that also provide alcoholic beverages and
snacks tend to come in under $6,000. 2) The
attendance of grad students at this event is
very low. It was estimated to be about five to
10 percent. Since this party is mostly an event
for undergraduates, GSC members did not
think that contributing $l,OOO was a wise use
of graduate student money.
We sincerely hope that this clarifies both
the financial situation of the GSC as well as
the proceedings of the meeting to our con
stituents. For more information, the GSC co
chairs can be reached at chair@gsc.

garding the budget cuts at the meeting this
Wednesday were twofold: 1) Some GSC
members hypothesize that University budget
cuts are probably affecting any supplemen
tary programs that departments run (e.g.,

Happy Hours), and that the GSC might thus
see an increase in demand on funding money
from groups that have previously been fund
ed by departments. So far, the GSC Funding
Committee has not seen much evidence of
this. 2) In order to spend down the GSC Re
serves to a level of one year's grad student ac
tivity fee, a subcommittee consisting of GSC
members and the ASSU financial manager
decided to supplement the funding budget by
roughly 10 percent of the GSC reserves for
the next few years until the desired reserves
level is reached. GSC Financial Officer Ryan
Peacock reminded GSC members at the
meeting that we should plan ahead for the
times when the funding budget will no longer
be supplemented and anticipate that some
funding rules and caps might need to be ad
justed.
The funding decisions that were made at
this week's GSC meeting were not in any way
affected by a sense of financial constraints.
While the GSC manages its budget responsi
bly and relatively conservatively, the GSC
has, to our knowledge, never been forced to
turn away a student organization or project
because of a lack of financial resources. In
stead, the GSC makes decisions based on its
funding policies (which can be reviewed on
the GSC Web site) and on impact dollars (i.e.,
what the grad students are getting for their
money).
At this point, we will review the decisions
from this week's GSC meeting that were ad
dressed in the Daily article.
Thanksgiving: The Thanksgiving Dinner is
generously sponsored by the President's Of
fice ($30,000 this year). In order to give us
more flexibility in creating a festive atmos
phere and in being environmentally con
scious (using real silverware, real table linen,
etc.), the GSC decided to supplement the
event with an additional $5,000 from the pro
gramming budget (a line item, which started
at $25,000 this fiscal year and will have
$14,000 remaining after the allocation to the
Thanksgiving event).
Funding for student groups: According to

GSC funding policies, student organization
events are sponsored up to $lO/person for
dinner, $B/person for lunch and $5/ person for
snacks. Natural Sciences Rep. Bryan Chen
brought up the idea that as the number of
people student groups are feeding increases,
the per-person cost decreases (e.g., perhaps
$lO/person is not necessary for an event with
600 attendees) and that the policies should
perhaps be modified accordingly. GSC Fund
ing Committee Chair Ping Li and Deputy
Chair Justin Brown clarified that these
amounts are caps that actually are reached by
few groups only. In addition, each group's
budget is reviewed carefully at the weekly
funding committee meeting. They acknowl
edged that this concern could be addressed in
the next revision of GSC funding policies at
the end of the fiscal year, but recommended
not to modify policies for the current fiscal
year to keep the process fair for groups that
have yet to apply.
Mausoleum Party: The GSC decided to
fund this party for $5OO instead of the re
quested $l,OOO. This decision was based
mainly on two considerations: 1) The budget
for the Mausoleum Party that was presented
at the GSC Meeting was roughly $lO,OOO.
Budgets for similar large-scale GSC events
that also provide alcoholic beverages and
snacks tend to come in under $6,000. 2) The
attendance of grad students at this event is
very low. It was estimated to be about five to
10 percent. Since this party is mostly an event
for undergraduates, GSC members did not
think that contributing $l,OOO was a wise use
of graduate student money.
We sincerely hope that this clarifies both
the financial situation of the GSC as well as
the proceedings of the meeting to our con
stituents. For more information, the GSC co
chairs can be reached at chair@gsc.
