## TAKING IT TO THE STREETS Undefeated women travel to Washington 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's soccer team is hitting the
road for the final time this weekend in its already
stellar 2009 regular season. The No. 1 Cardinal will
put its undefeated record on the line against the
Washington schools as it competes in its third-to-last
series before the postseason.
Friday's matchup with the No. 23 Cougars of
Washington State (10-3-1, 2-0-1 Pac-10) comes on
the heels of an astonishing home series in which the
Cardinal shut out No. 15 USC with four goals, then
blanked No. 3 UCLA 2-0. While it's certainly a relief
for Stanford (15-0-0,4-0) to come out of such an im
posing weekend series with a pair of wins, Paul Rat
cliff e's Cardinal remains focused as always on tak
ing every opponent seriously, one at a time.
"I was excited for the challenge last weekend and
now that's behind us and we have a new challenge to
look to," Ratcliffe said. "We've just got to keep
rolling and playing our best. Every weekend is going
to be a challenge from here on out and there are no
easy games on this schedule."
Despite the definite threat that both Washington
teams pose, the sweep over the Trojans and the Bru
ins certainly gives the Cardinal with just five
games left on its schedule a much better chance
to finish the year undefeated. True to both character
and coaching style, however, Ratcliffe insists he isn't
concerned about keeping a "zero" as the second
digit in his record.
"I just think game to game and if you start think
ing long-term like that, you're just going to trip your
self up," he commented. "For me, we've just got to
prepare for Washington State on Friday, hopefully
beat them and go from there. They're a tough team
and we can't breeze by them."
A veteran of final stretches to a season, senior
Kristin Stannard agrees with her coach that every
team, especially at this time of year, has something
to prove and can't be underestimated.
"We can't just look to the end," Stannard said.
"Every game's going to be a challenge and we can't
go soft. These games are going to be tough and we
can't let up until everything is done."
Indeed, neither the Cougars nor the Huskies (9-
2-3,1-0-2) will be a breeze to defeat, even relatively
speaking after last weekend's tough opponents.
Washington State remains undefeated in the Pac-10
and has already matched its 10 total

wins from last year. Highlighting
their talented roster is Kiersten Dall
stream, who stands as the Pac-10's
third-best scorer with 12 goals and
four assists for 28 points.
Sunday's opponents, the Huskies,
are no pushovers, either. Despite a
somewhat less eye-catching record in
conference play, Washington carries
an impressive overall record, boasts a
nine-game unbeaten streak and has
yet to suffer an outright loss in the
Pac-10.
"I think they're both going to be
difficult games," Ratcliffe said.
"Washington State and the Universi
ty of Washington are very good
teams, so we're going to have to real
ly prepare well and play to the best of
our ability on Friday and then on
Sunday as well."
The Cardinal should be in fine
shape to face them, however. Stan
ford has been fortunate to suffer rel
atively few injuries this season and
has been able to make effective sub
stitutions when needed. Last week
end, for example, defensive midfield
er Cami Levin scored a big goal
against the Bruins when she was put
in at forward.
"We've been able to stay pretty
healthy, which has been great," Rat
cliffe reflected. "And we have a great
bench that can come in make things
happen if we need it, so I feel com
fortable with how things stand. You
have to be careful with the changes
you make, but it's fantastic that I can

make so many. I think the changes we made against
UCLA, which was a tight game, really those changes
probably won the game. After that kind of experi
ence, I'm going to want to sub more,"
While Stanford's bench has certainly impressed,
it's the Cardinal starters that have been consistently
putting up big numbers and garnering national at
tention. Senior forward Kelley O'Hara leads the
conference in scoring with 41 points and junior
Christen Press is right behind her with 38. As a team,
Stanford ranks second in the nation with 3.6 goals
per game.
Besides the talented players they will face in
Washington, the Northwestern climate might pose
some other unique challenges on the Cardinal's
final road trip. Stannard, a veteran of every trip on
the Cardinal's conference schedule, knows the con
ditions in Washington can sometimes require some
adjustments.
"The thing I really remember about Washington
is that the grass is really thick, so it's hard to run
there," she said. "But we came out here [at Stanford]
last week when it basically was pouring, so we just
need to go into it mentally prepared and we'll be
fine."
The Cardinal faces off against the Washington
State Cougars at 3 p.m. on Sunday, then heads to the
University of Washington to take on the Huskies on
Sunday at 12 p.m.
