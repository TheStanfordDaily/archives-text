# Men's soccer welcomes Aztecs
## 
### WILL SEATON 
It's about time for a little revenge.
The Stanford men's soccer team (8-3-1,
2-2-1 Pac-10) gets a chance at payback
against UCLA (8-1-2, 3-0-2 Pac-10) at
home this weekend after suffering a
tough loss to the Bruins last Sunday.
Before the Cardinal gets that chance,
however, it must fight through a tough
San Diego State team (4-4-4,1-2-2 Pac
-10) that it just barely beat in overtime.
Home field advantage plays a huge
role this weekend. Stanford has been
nearly unbeatable at home so far in
every sport, sporting an incredible
combined 31-0-1 record. The lone tie
came from men's soccer against Wash
ington two weeks, as Stanford battled
through to notch a 1-1 tie.
In order to keep this improbable
streak going, Stanford will need to prove
that its last win over San Diego State
was deserved. Achieving victory only
after a goal in the last three minutes of
regulation and a vital score early in
overtime, the Cardinal came very close
to closing the weekend with two losses.
Sophomore midfielder Garret Gunther
stepped up that day; but this time
around, the team will need to score ear
lier to put pressure on the Aztecs.
The Aztecs' goalkeeper, redshirt
junior Brad Byrns, has proven vital to
his team's success. Byrns averages 4.45
saves per game, leading the Pac-10 and
maintaining a 75.4 save percentage and
two shutouts.
Stanford star forward/midfielder
Bobby Warshaw explained that San
Diego State's playing style is "a grind."
"They do the work needed," he said.
"They're not as talented as UCLA, but
they do the work and wear a team
down physically. It's tough."
Fortunately for the Cardinal, San
Diego has not performed too well on the
road this season.The Aztecs are 0-1-1 on
the road and only recently notched their
solo conference win against California.
In addition, Stanford boasts its own im
pressive defense. Goalkeeper John
Moore leads the Pac-10 with five
shutouts. The defensive line of Hunter
Gorskie, T.J. Novak, Ryan Thomas and
Bobby Warshaw has also been a big help
in allowing just 0.92 goals per game, the
second fewest in the Pac-10.
"I think the beauty of our team is we
have talented guys all over the field,"
Warshaw said. "We have guys who can
do great things with the ball."
Stanford has the ever-important

home field advantage which, combined
with their victory over the Aztecs last
week, should be enough to give them
the "W."
"Our chances are very good," War
shaw said. "We've beaten them the last
two years at home. If we want to be the
nationally ranked team we know we
can be, we need to win these kinds of
games at home."
But beating San Diego State is just
the first part. UCLA should prove to
be the real challenge for the men's
team this weekend. UCLA is on a
nine-game unbeaten streak and hard
ly seems to be intimidated on the road.
They stand at 3-1-2 on the road, which
is slightly more forgiving than their 5-
0-0 home record. They defeated Stan
ford last week 2-0 in a fairly demon
strative game and have slowly begun
pulling ahead of their conference chal
lengers.
Is Stanford worried? If they are,
they won't admit it.
"We're feeling confident," Warshaw
said. "It's a game we should win.
They're a great team, but I don't feel
like they're better than us."
With 11 points, UCLA rests atop the
Pac-10 standings, trailed by Stanford and
Washington tied with seven. With only
five games left in the regular season, this
weekend could provide Stanford with its
last chance to halt UCLA's ascension to
the Pac-10 title. A win this weekend
would put Stanford nearly even with
UCLA and give itself valuable space
over the rest of the league. A loss would
almost assuredly guarantee UCLA firm

shutouts. The defensive line of Hunter
Gorskie, T.J. Novak, Ryan Thomas and
Bobby Warshaw has also been a big help
in allowing just 0.92 goals per game, the
second fewest in the Pac-10.
"I think the beauty of our team is we
have talented guys all over the field,"
Warshaw said. "We have guys who can
do great things with the ball."
Stanford has the ever-important

home field advantage which, combined
with their victory over the Aztecs last
week, should be enough to give them
the "W."
"Our chances are very good," War
shaw said. "We've beaten them the last
two years at home. If we want to be the
nationally ranked team we know we
can be, we need to win these kinds of
games at home."
But beating San Diego State is just
the first part. UCLA should prove to
be the real challenge for the men's
team this weekend. UCLA is on a
nine-game unbeaten streak and hard
ly seems to be intimidated on the road.
They stand at 3-1-2 on the road, which
is slightly more forgiving than their 5-
0-0 home record. They defeated Stan
ford last week 2-0 in a fairly demon
strative game and have slowly begun
pulling ahead of their conference chal
lengers.
Is Stanford worried? If they are,
they won't admit it.
"We're feeling confident," Warshaw
said. "It's a game we should win.
They're a great team, but I don't feel
like they're better than us."
With 11 points, UCLA rests atop the
Pac-10 standings, trailed by Stanford and
Washington tied with seven. With only
five games left in the regular season, this
weekend could provide Stanford with its
last chance to halt UCLA's ascension to
the Pac-10 title. A win this weekend
would put Stanford nearly even with
UCLA and give itself valuable space
over the rest of the league. A loss would
almost assuredly guarantee UCLA firm

Men's soccer welcomes San Diego State and UCLA to Stanford this weekend, in a
rematch of last weekend's matches. The Cardinal narrowly defeated the Aztecs in
overtime, but fell to UCLA 2-0. Men's soccer is as yet unbeaten on their home turf.

control over the top spot.
"Both teams have a lot of num
bers in the midfield," Warshaw ex
plained. "UCLA plays with a very
free-flowing style, which is tough for
us. Our team has done a great job at
knowing our roles and our systems.
A free-flowing style is tough be
cause we're seeing things we're not

used to and we're outnumbered in
the midfield. We need to work hard
there and stay connected with each
other."

The action promises to be just
what you would expect from two na
tionally competitive teams facing
off in this marquee event. Kickoff is
scheduled for 7 p.m. on Friday
against San Diego State and 1 p.m.
on Sunday against UCLA at Laird
Q. Cagan Stadium.
