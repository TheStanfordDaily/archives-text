# Boise and BCS: Hope for change
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
If Boise State goes undefeated this
season and either one or zero
other teams go undefeated, I be
lieve Boise State should play in the
BCS National Championship game.
Why, you ask? Well, why the heck
not? I personally have grown tired of
the debate about whether teams from
second-tier, non-BCS conferences are
any good. The college football world is
like old men sitting by the fire debating
whether capitalism is a good economic
system or not. It's like the BCS won't
allow a team from a non-BCS confer
ence to even have a sniff at the Cham
pionship. Why don't we do something
about it this year? Why don't we finally
let an undefeated and pretty darn good
football team play for the national
title? I would absolutely love to see
Boise State out there on the field come
January.
Wouldn't that end the drawn-out
debate about the weakness of non-
BCS schools? Wouldn't we finally be
able to give actual evidence to the
claims of BCS superiority or non-BCS
mediocrity? If Boise State gets
crushed, then we may finally say for
sure that the best teams from the non-
BCS conferences just aren't on the
same page as the BCS conference lead
ers.
On the other hand, if Boise State
keeps it close or hell, even wins, won't
that perhaps change the landscape of
college football for years to come?
Won't it show that teams like the Bron
cos are capable of being on the same
field as the Florida's and Texas's and
USC's?
Don't forget my stipulation in the
first sentence: Only if Boise State and
only one other team are undefeated
should the Broncos get to play in the
title game. I fully understand that if, for
example, lowa and Alabama and Boise
State are undefeated, the Broncos
draw the short straw.
I also understand that Boise has no
chance if they lose a game. If Florida,
Alabama, Texas, Cincinnati, lowa and
USC six of the top seven teams in
the country right now, minus our dear
friend Boise State can all finish the
season strong and win out, then Boise
State will get left in the cold and I will
be able to live with that. But I am bank
ing on the fact that at least five of those
schools will lose a game before the sea
son is over. And if that happens and
Boise State stands alone unbeaten, or
just one of two unbeatens, then they
should get ready for a trip to Pasadena.
My argument today rests signifi
cantly on a few things, but none greater
than the show that Boise State and
other non-BCS conference schools
have put on against quality teams over
the past few years. Everyone knows
about Boise's awesome win over Okla
homa in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl. How
about some teams similar to the Bron
cos? Utah's win over Big East champ
Pittsburgh in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl and
last year's thumping of SEC giant Al
abama in the Sugar Bowl. Wasn't
everyone watching that game both
stunned and impressed? Does that not
give at least some proof to the fact that
these teams can play with the "big
boys"?
Let's also not forget the numerous
regular season wins that these teams
have had in recent years. This year:
Boise over Oregon (which is looking
better every week), BYU over Okla
homa, TCU over Clemson. Last year:
Utah over Michigan, UNLV over Ari
zona State, Wyoming over Tennessee,
Boise over Oregon again. Two years
ago: Air Force over Notre Dame, Utah
over UCLA. Yes, these teams can play
with the biggest bailers in the BCS.
Allowing an undefeated Boise
State to play for the national champi
onship would, in my mind, be great for
college football. It's an exciting story
when the underdog makes it far during

March Madness and fans support the
Cinderella. Why can't that be the same
in football?
If Boise State plays for the national
title in January I would don my blue
and orange and be the Broncos' biggest
fan. I bet a lot of college football fans
would cheer for Boise State as well, just
because of the monumental signifi
cance. It could very well be one of the
most-watched college football games
of all time.
I just want to finally see why college
football has been beating around the

bush for years. Instead of complaining,
discussing and analyzing why a second
tier conference team never can make it
as far as the title game, let's put them in
there for once and see what they can
do. If they get blown apart, I'll shut up
and never speak a word about this sub
ject again. We will finally know the
truth. But if the Broncos put forth a
great effort and provide serious com
petition, it will give credibility to all
non-BCS schools that they have the
chance to play for a national title.
I think it would make the college
football game that much better and
give real hope to the hundreds of ath
letes who thought they never had a
chance of hoisting the silver football.
And don't think I am solely a blue
turf kind of guy. Don't forget about an

other team in Texas that's looking to
run the table this year: TCU. They play
a tougher schedule than Boise State; if
undefeated they would have wins over
Virginia, Clemson, BYU and Utah.
The Mountain West Conference that
has produced some quality teams in re
cent years could send TCU out this
year with an unblemished record.
Knowing the BCS system, TCU
would be rated higher than an unde
feated Boise State because of strength
of schedule. But if Boise State were to
slip up and TCU held strong, then
everything I said about the Broncos
can be changed to TCU. It doesn't real
ly matter which unsung team plays for
the BCS Championship TCU or
Boise, whatever. It just matters that one
of them gets that chance.

So come on, voters and computers,
if Boise State goes undefeated this
year, let them have a shot at the title. I
won't fault you if there are other quali
ty teams to choose from, but if Boise
State is all you got with a zero in the loss
column, let's see this happen. Let's find
the answer to this endless debate about
strong versus weak teams and let's find
it on college football's biggest stage.

Boise, whatever. It just matters that one
of them gets that chance.

So come on, voters and computers,
if Boise State goes undefeated this
year, let them have a shot at the title. I
won't fault you if there are other quali
ty teams to choose from, but if Boise
State is all you got with a zero in the loss
column, let's see this happen. Let's find
the answer to this endless debate about
strong versus weak teams and let's find
it on college football's biggest stage.

If Boise State goes undefeated this
season and either one or zero
other teams go undefeated, I be
lieve Boise State should play in the
BCS National Championship game.
Why, you ask? Well, why the heck
not? I personally have grown tired of
the debate about whether teams from
second-tier, non-BCS conferences are
any good. The college football world is
like old men sitting by the fire debating
whether capitalism is a good economic
system or not. It's like the BCS won't
allow a team from a non-BCS confer
ence to even have a sniff at the Cham
pionship. Why don't we do something
about it this year? Why don't we finally
let an undefeated and pretty darn good
football team play for the national
title? I would absolutely love to see
Boise State out there on the field come
January.
Wouldn't that end the drawn-out
debate about the weakness of non-
BCS schools? Wouldn't we finally be
able to give actual evidence to the
claims of BCS superiority or non-BCS
mediocrity? If Boise State gets
crushed, then we may finally say for
sure that the best teams from the non-
BCS conferences just aren't on the
same page as the BCS conference lead
ers.
On the other hand, if Boise State
keeps it close or hell, even wins, won't
that perhaps change the landscape of
college football for years to come?
Won't it show that teams like the Bron
cos are capable of being on the same
field as the Florida's and Texas's and
USC's?
Don't forget my stipulation in the
first sentence: Only if Boise State and
only one other team are undefeated
should the Broncos get to play in the
title game. I fully understand that if, for
example, lowa and Alabama and Boise
State are undefeated, the Broncos
draw the short straw.
I also understand that Boise has no
chance if they lose a game. If Florida,
Alabama, Texas, Cincinnati, lowa and
USC six of the top seven teams in
the country right now, minus our dear
friend Boise State can all finish the
season strong and win out, then Boise
State will get left in the cold and I will
be able to live with that. But I am bank
ing on the fact that at least five of those
schools will lose a game before the sea
son is over. And if that happens and
Boise State stands alone unbeaten, or
just one of two unbeatens, then they
should get ready for a trip to Pasadena.
My argument today rests signifi
cantly on a few things, but none greater
than the show that Boise State and
other non-BCS conference schools
have put on against quality teams over
the past few years. Everyone knows
about Boise's awesome win over Okla
homa in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl. How
about some teams similar to the Bron
cos? Utah's win over Big East champ
Pittsburgh in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl and
last year's thumping of SEC giant Al
abama in the Sugar Bowl. Wasn't
everyone watching that game both
stunned and impressed? Does that not
give at least some proof to the fact that
these teams can play with the "big
boys"?
Let's also not forget the numerous
regular season wins that these teams
have had in recent years. This year:
Boise over Oregon (which is looking
better every week), BYU over Okla
homa, TCU over Clemson. Last year:
Utah over Michigan, UNLV over Ari
zona State, Wyoming over Tennessee,
Boise over Oregon again. Two years
ago: Air Force over Notre Dame, Utah
over UCLA. Yes, these teams can play
with the biggest bailers in the BCS.
Allowing an undefeated Boise
State to play for the national champi
onship would, in my mind, be great for
college football. It's an exciting story
when the underdog makes it far during

March Madness and fans support the
Cinderella. Why can't that be the same
in football?
If Boise State plays for the national
title in January I would don my blue
and orange and be the Broncos' biggest
fan. I bet a lot of college football fans
would cheer for Boise State as well, just
because of the monumental signifi
cance. It could very well be one of the
most-watched college football games
of all time.
I just want to finally see why college
football has been beating around the

bush for years. Instead of complaining,
discussing and analyzing why a second
tier conference team never can make it
as far as the title game, let's put them in
there for once and see what they can
do. If they get blown apart, I'll shut up
and never speak a word about this sub
ject again. We will finally know the
truth. But if the Broncos put forth a
great effort and provide serious com
petition, it will give credibility to all
non-BCS schools that they have the
chance to play for a national title.
I think it would make the college
football game that much better and
give real hope to the hundreds of ath
letes who thought they never had a
chance of hoisting the silver football.
And don't think I am solely a blue
turf kind of guy. Don't forget about an

other team in Texas that's looking to
run the table this year: TCU. They play
a tougher schedule than Boise State; if
undefeated they would have wins over
Virginia, Clemson, BYU and Utah.
The Mountain West Conference that
has produced some quality teams in re
cent years could send TCU out this
year with an unblemished record.
Knowing the BCS system, TCU
would be rated higher than an unde
feated Boise State because of strength
of schedule. But if Boise State were to
slip up and TCU held strong, then
everything I said about the Broncos
can be changed to TCU. It doesn't real
ly matter which unsung team plays for
the BCS Championship TCU or
Boise, whatever. It just matters that one
of them gets that chance.

So come on, voters and computers,
if Boise State goes undefeated this
year, let them have a shot at the title. I
won't fault you if there are other quali
ty teams to choose from, but if Boise
State is all you got with a zero in the loss
column, let's see this happen. Let's find
the answer to this endless debate about
strong versus weak teams and let's find
it on college football's biggest stage.
