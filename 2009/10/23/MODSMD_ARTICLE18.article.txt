# Boise and BCS: Hope for change
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
If Boise State goes undefeated this
season and either one or zero
other teams go undefeated, I be
lieve Boise State should play in the
BCS National Championship game.
Why, you ask? Well, why the heck
not? I personally have grown tired of
the debate about whether teams from
second-tier, non-BCS conferences are
any good. The college football world is
like old men sitting by the fire debating
whether capitalism is a good economic
system or not. It's like the BCS won't
allow a team from a non-BCS confer
ence to even have a sniff at the Cham
pionship. Why don't we do something
about it this year? Why don't we finally
let an undefeated and pretty darn good
football team play for the national
title? I would absolutely love to see
Boise State out there on the field come
January.
Wouldn't that end the drawn-out
debate about the weakness of non-
BCS schools? Wouldn't we finally be
able to give actual evidence to the
claims of BCS superiority or non-BCS
mediocrity? If Boise State gets
crushed, then we may finally say for
sure that the best teams from the non-
BCS conferences just aren't on the
same page as the BCS conference lead
ers.
On the other hand, if Boise State
keeps it close or hell, even wins, won't
that perhaps change the landscape of
college football for years to come?
Won't it show that teams like the Bron
cos are capable of being on the same
field as the Florida's and Texas's and
USC's?
Don't forget my stipulation in the
first sentence: Only if Boise State and
only one other team are undefeated
should the Broncos get to play in the
title game. I fully understand that if, for
example, lowa and Alabama and Boise
State are undefeated, the Broncos
draw the short straw.
I also understand that Boise has no
chance if they lose a game. If Florida,
Alabama, Texas, Cincinnati, lowa and
USC six of the top seven teams in
the country right now, minus our dear
friend Boise State can all finish the
season strong and win out, then Boise
State will get left in the cold and I will
be able to live with that. But I am bank
ing on the fact that at least five of those
schools will lose a game before the sea
son is over. And if that happens and
Boise State stands alone unbeaten, or
just one of two unbeatens, then they
should get ready for a trip to Pasadena.
My argument today rests signifi
cantly on a few things, but none greater
than the show that Boise State and
other non-BCS conference schools
have put on against quality teams over
the past few years. Everyone knows
about Boise's awesome win over Okla
homa in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl. How
about some teams similar to the Bron
cos? Utah's win over Big East champ
Pittsburgh in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl and
last year's thumping of SEC giant Al
abama in the Sugar Bowl. Wasn't
everyone watching that game both
stunned and impressed? Does that not
give at least some proof to the fact that
these teams can play with the "big
boys"?
Let's also not forget the numerous
regular season wins that these teams
have had in recent years. This year:
Boise over Oregon (which is looking
better every week), BYU over Okla
homa, TCU over Clemson. Last year:
Utah over Michigan, UNLV over Ari
zona State, Wyoming over Tennessee,
Boise over Oregon again. Two years
ago: Air Force over Notre Dame, Utah
over UCLA. Yes, these teams can play
with the biggest bailers in the BCS.
Allowing an undefeated Boise
State to play for the national champi
onship would, in my mind, be great for
college football. It's an exciting story
when the underdog makes it far during
