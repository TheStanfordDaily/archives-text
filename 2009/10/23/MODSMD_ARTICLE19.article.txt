# SPORTS BRIEFS
## Women's basketball picked to finish first in Pac-10 
### â€“ By Jacob Jaffe 
The head coaches in the Pacific-10
Conference recently released their
predictions for the conference and
Stanford is the clear favorite to win
another conference title.
The Cardinal received nine of 10
first place votes and totaled 81 points,
falling well ahead of second-place
California, which received 67 points.
Arizona State is in third with 64
points, which includes the other first
place vote.
Stanford has won nine consecu
tive Pac-10 titles, so it comes as no
surprise that the coaches predict a
10th. Last year, the Cardinal domi
nated Pac-10 play, going 17-1 in con
ference games and 33-5 overall. Stan
ford's run in the NCAA Tournament
ended in the Final Four against unde
feated Connecticut.
The Cardinal returns four starters
from last year's team, including All-
American and Pac-10 Player of the
Year center Jayne Appel. Second-
Team All-Pac-10 guard Jeanette
Pohlen and Third-Team All-Pac-10
forward Kayla Pedersen also support
the team again this year. Other key

contributors are redshirt senior
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, fresh
man forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
and redshirt junior J.J. Hones, who
missed last year with an ACL tear.
Tara VanDerveer's 24th season as
Stanford's head coach begins at Old
Dominion on Nov. 13.
