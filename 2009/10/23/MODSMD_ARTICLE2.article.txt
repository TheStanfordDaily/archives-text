# ARIZONA INVASION
## Stanford women's volleyball looks to burn the Sun Devils 
### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE 
It's going to be a busy homecoming
weekend for the Stanford women's
volleyball team. Following last week's
tough road loss against now No. 12 ,

Oregon (14-3 overall, 4-3
Pac-10), the Cardinal looks
to gain some valuable
league wins at home this
weekend. Stanford (12-5,4-
2 Pac-10) looks to defend
its home turf at Maples
Pavilion, as it takes on Ari
zona State (11-8, 1-6 Pac
-10) on Friday and No. 16
Arizona (15-3, 4-3 Pac-10)
Sunday afternoon.
The Card lost one spot
in the ranking after last
weekend's matches, a four
set win over Oregon State
(11-8,2-5 Pac-10) followed
by a heartbreaking five-set
loss against Oregon. In the
OSU match, junior outside
hitter Alix Klineman led
the Cardinal with 20 kills
and 17 digs, while junior
libero Gabi Ailes set a new
career-high with 32 digs.
Ailes also set the Stanford
record for most digs in a
match. In the loss at Ore
gon, Klineman again led
the team in kills with 24
while senior middle block
er Janet Okogbaa added 15
kills and 7 blocks.

"When you win or lose
as you go through the season, you learn a lot of things," said Head
Coach John Dunning. "We realized we needed to work on our of
fensive execution because of the Oregon match. We had to do a
better job connecting."
Junior Cassidy Lichtman, who recorded her sixth triple-double
of the season with 17 kills, digs and assists at Oregon, echoed this
sentiment.
"We have been working a lot on our offensive connection,"
Lichtman said. "Our serving and passing are good enough that we

NOTES ! A five-set loss against Oregon on
the road cost Stanford the No. 1 spot in
the rankings last weekend. Now they re
turn home to Maples Pavilion, where
they remain undefeated at 4-0. Arizona
State also lost last weekend to Arizona.

The Cardinal welcomes Arizona and Arizona State. They suffered
a loss to Oregon last weekend 3-2, but remain undefeated
at home. Arizona State comes off a six-game losing streak.
should be executing better offensively.
I think it is going to help us improve a
lot at this point in the season."
Now that Stanford is back at home,
they look to continue the success
they've had at Maples Pavilion, where
they remain undefeated at 4-0.
"We've been on the road a lot this
season, six of the first eight weeks," Dun
ning said. "There are very few road wins
in the conference. We had them at USC
and UCLA, which was huge, but it's
hard traveling and not having your
crowd support and familiarity."
"We're excited to be home these
next two weeks and to defend our
court," added senior Alex Fisher.
The Card will get a chance to do
just that against an Arizona State line
up that has struggled recently in
league play. The Sun Devils lost last
weekend to Arizona, bringing their in
conference losing streak to six; but still,
they should not be marked as a

pushover just yet. Many of their losses
have been close matches against some
of the best teams in the conference, in
cluding a five setter against 15-4 Wash
ington State.
"We've spent the last few days get
ting ready for ASU," Dunning said.
"They're a great defensive team."
Additionally, the Sun Devils have
junior outside hitter Sarah Reaves, an
imposing force who racked up 16 kills
last year against Stanford. Reaves
ranks third in the Pac-10 with 4.39 kills
per set.
"Arizona State has a very domi
nant outside hitter in Sarah Reaves, so
it will be important to try to contain
her," Lichtman said.
After taking on ASU Friday night,
the Cardinal faces Arizona Sunday af
ternoon in an important conference
match-up between the second- and
third-place teams in the Pac-10. After
getting out to a great start with 12 con
secutive wins, the Wildcats lost three of
their first four conference games. Since
then, they have come back more dan
gerous than ever. With outside hitter
Whitney Dosty, fully recovered from a
broken pinky earlier in the season, in

their lineup, and with a recent upset
against No. 11 Oregon under its belt,
Arizona is an impressive opponent.
"Arizona is a great offensive team,"
Dunning said. "They have several
good hitters and are a big net team."
Senior Alex Fisher emphasized the
importance of controlling the big hit
ters for Arizona, including outside hit
ters Dosty and Tiffany Owens, who
leads the team with 3.82 kills per set.
"We have to shut down their out
side and right side hitters," Fisher said
of the Arizona match. "If we win our
next four matches, it will distance us
from the rest of the Pac-10, with the ex
ception of Washington."
As the midpoint of the conference
season approaches, solidifying its con
ference standing is a main goal for the
Cardinal. Wins against Arizona State
and Arizona this weekend will put
Stanford in secure standing heading
into the second half of the season.
First serves are set for 7 p.m. on Fri
day and 1 p.m. on Sunday in Maples
Pavilion.
