## Stanford women's volleyball looks to burn the Sun Devils 
### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE 
It's going to be a busy homecoming
weekend for the Stanford women's
volleyball team. Following last week's
tough road loss against now No. 12 ,

Oregon (14-3 overall, 4-3
Pac-10), the Cardinal looks
to gain some valuable
league wins at home this
weekend. Stanford (12-5,4-
2 Pac-10) looks to defend
its home turf at Maples
Pavilion, as it takes on Ari
zona State (11-8, 1-6 Pac
-10) on Friday and No. 16
Arizona (15-3, 4-3 Pac-10)
Sunday afternoon.
The Card lost one spot
in the ranking after last
weekend's matches, a four
set win over Oregon State
(11-8,2-5 Pac-10) followed

loss against Oregon. In the
OSU match, junior outside
hitter Alix Klineman led
the Cardinal with 20 kills
and 17 digs, while junior
libero Gabi Ailes set a new
career-high with 32 digs.
Ailes also set the Stanford
record for most digs in a
match. In the loss at Ore
gon, Klineman again led
the team in kills with 24
while senior middle block
er Janet Okogbaa added 15
kills and 7 blocks.

"When you win or lose
as you go through the season, you learn a lot of things," said Head
Coach John Dunning. "We realized we needed to work on our of
fensive execution because of the Oregon match. We had to do a
better job connecting."
Junior Cassidy Lichtman, who recorded her sixth triple-double
of the season with 17 kills, digs and assists at Oregon, echoed this
sentiment.
"We have been working a lot on our offensive connection,"
Lichtman said. "Our serving and passing are good enough that we
