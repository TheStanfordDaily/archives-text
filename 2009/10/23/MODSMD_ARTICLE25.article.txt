Ever been to a concert, seen people from the audience chosen to go on stage and felt an
overwhelming sense of envy as you watched these other people dance their heart out in
front of thousands? Well, we at Intermission have felt this resentment too many times
and as we ventured to Treasure Island Musical Festival last weekend, we set out to ensure that
we got ourselves on stage. We thought we would share some tips on how to get the feat
accomplished.

1. In order to have any chance of being picked from the audience, you must be at the front,
Often times this front line position entails waiting hours at a time at the same stage in
order to gradually push your way to the desired location as other patrons move to the dif
ferent stages around the festival. This weekend, we waited at least four hours at one stage in
anticipation of the acts to come later in the day.

2. Now that you've positioned yourself at the front, you need a gimmick to stand out from
the crowd. Make yourself noticeable, yet don't go overboard you still need to look
cool and impressive. Our group decided to wear feathers and face paint, a la MGMT and
this ploy worked like a charm. Audience members, as well as the press, could not help but look
in our direction, asking us to pose as we appropriately channeled the mood of the festival. We
witnessed our gimmick's success as the lady who chose which people got on stage yelled to

security, "Get me the Indians!"

3. Become friendly with security. These people are the ones that control who can come
over the barrier that separates audience from performer. Being congenial with these
staffers does not guarantee a spot on stage, but it definitely helps towards this goal. We
talked with the security guard at the stage numerous times, making sure that he knew of our
presence and that he would remember us if necessary. It was our dear friend Casey (I think . .
?) that literally pulled us from the stampede of people vying to get on stage and onto the side
of the performer.

So there you have it: Three easy tips to get yourself on stage. Follow these guidelines,
get creative and in no time, you will be dancing with bands and artists alike. Be patient,
because it's a long process and don't be afraid to be ruthless because hundreds of people like
you want to be on that stage. So, who do you want to dance with? Girl Talk is fun, trust us.
