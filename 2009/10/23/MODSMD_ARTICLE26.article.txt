It's an odd place for a music festival, Treasure Island. A man-made pimple popped in the middle of the Bay, the place is a San Franciscan eye sore of dilapidated low-income housing,
broken basketball hoops and failed foresight.
There's nothing buried there, save for the garbage and muck buried in the landfdl that the island was built upon, and if it's adventure you're looking for, you'd be better off in the
Tenderloin. Commuters on the Bay Bridge scoff every time they pass the unwelcoming, sharp turn to Treasure Island. Who would want to go there?
Yet every year, there is this musical gem, a two-day pearl set in the confines of the broken place. On its third reprise, this year's Treasure Island Music Festival (TIMF) was about a
month later than its previous counterpart, placing the event in the toehold of an awakening winter instead of the embrace of a crisp fall.
If concert-goers were skeptical of the weather, no one told Saturday, which featured among an eclectic spectacle of electronica, hip hop and international music, as warm as a day as
you'll get in San Francisco. With the sun beaming down, droves dressed in neon spandex and smothered face paint, romped between the Bridge (main) Stage and Tunnel (side) Stage, past make
shift clothes boutiques and across the wet festival grass. The island was their dance floor, and acts like Girl Talk, MSTRKRFT and MGMT were there to guarantee it.
But as always, it was a tale of two days. The blustery and chilled Sunday, was one for the subdued, a time to break out the blankets and embrace of folk and indie rock offering. The
crowd, rougher and older, had come for the brass of Beirut and the harmonies of Grizzly Bear, braving the cold to be on the frontline of audio bliss.
Concert-organizers Noise Pop and Another Planet Entertainment were up to their usual micromanagement and hip detail application as well, employing everything from refillable water
stations to hipster clothes boutiques to recycling education booths to appease the progressive mindset. Not to mention the flushing Porta-Potties as well. Sanitation! Making their returns this
year were interesting art exhibits and the 60-foot Ferris Wheel that had lines stretching through the vendor village.
As for the new, the festival's Bridge Stage featured a giant screen, and backing LCD arch, controlled by video mash-up artists Dubbo. Whether the videos provided visual appeasement
or seizures remains to be seen, however, this year's most prominent addition showed that festival organizers were open to tweaking the festival so as to provide the perfect experience.
In terms of festivals it doesn't get much better than this. The continued prevention of overlap of sets remains a trademark of TIMF, and, along with the small details, well justified the
price of admission, especially if you could walk 100 yards the other stage and watch Yo La Tengo after spending an hour with The Decemberists.
Who thought you could find actual treasure on a place like that?

Flaming Lips
The Flaming Lips are every bit as legendary as people say they are. Known for their
famous UFO shows, the Flaming Lips did not disappoint as the closing act of the festival on
Sunday night.
With a bright orange set, bright orange roadies, and a huge bright orange screen, the
experience was clearly a visual overload. Opening with NSFW graphic in the background,
each of the Lips emerged from the enormous, flashing vagina on the screen.
That is, all of the Lips except Wayne Coyne, the frontman and visionary. Instead, he
rolled out in his customary giant plastic bubble, and proceeded to walk in it all over the enor
mous crowd. After he made it back on stage, the band launched into "Race For the Prize,"
complete with lucky fans dressed as bears dancing in the background.
Confetti cannons and balloons added to the already stimulating experience. A man
dressed in a bunny suit began to crowd surf, and in the process landing on a bystander, caus
ing paramedics to infiltrate the pit. It was this uncontrollable excitement and frenzy lasted
throughout the entire set. Wayne suggested that the audience just stay and "take over Treasure
Island." Trust me, Wayne ... if we could, we would.

Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes
And God said, Let Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes from Paraguay be gathered
together unto the Tunnel Stage: and it was so.
While it's debatable if Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes were a godsend, there's
no doubt they played the part.
"It's kind of like Jesus," someone in the crowd murmured.
Booked for a 2:30 set on Sunday, Alex Ebert, known as Edward Sharpe, pranced onto
Treasure Island's main stage trailed by an assortment of vagabonds and kooks, delicately
referred to as the Magnetic Zeroes. Drawing comparisons to Ken Kesey and the Merry
Pranksters, who had roamed the city almost six decades earlier, the cultish group stood around
for a few minutes grinning at each other and swaying before embarking on their musical jour
ney.
And what a journey it was. While a great deal of the crowd was at first asking,
"Where's the Kool-Aid?" their doubts were largely erased as soon as the band got rolling.
From accordions to glockenspiels, trumpets to ukeleles, the group was an eclectic surprise,
packing a rich interpretation of folk rock into their upbeat songs, like "40 Day Dream."
Ebert cut an interesting figure, fully bearded and dressed in a deep, tie-dye V-neck,
which he promptly lost by the third song. He was very much the charmer, baptizing the crowd
with a Dylan-esque voice as he jumped and hollered across the stage.
Yet, it was his duet with vocalist Jade Castrinos that captured the hearts of the Treasure
Island crowd, as the two shared memories of Alabama, friendship and good times in "Home",
as they sang "Home, let me come home, home is when I'm alone with you."
On that island, it was love of biblical proportions.
