It's an odd place for a music festival, Treasure Island. A man-made pimple popped in the middle of the Bay, the place is a San Franciscan eye sore of dilapidated low-income housing,
broken basketball hoops and failed foresight.
There's nothing buried there, save for the garbage and muck buried in the landfdl that the island was built upon, and if it's adventure you're looking for, you'd be better off in the
Tenderloin. Commuters on the Bay Bridge scoff every time they pass the unwelcoming, sharp turn to Treasure Island. Who would want to go there?
Yet every year, there is this musical gem, a two-day pearl set in the confines of the broken place. On its third reprise, this year's Treasure Island Music Festival (TIMF) was about a
month later than its previous counterpart, placing the event in the toehold of an awakening winter instead of the embrace of a crisp fall.
If concert-goers were skeptical of the weather, no one told Saturday, which featured among an eclectic spectacle of electronica, hip hop and international music, as warm as a day as
you'll get in San Francisco. With the sun beaming down, droves dressed in neon spandex and smothered face paint, romped between the Bridge (main) Stage and Tunnel (side) Stage, past make
shift clothes boutiques and across the wet festival grass. The island was their dance floor, and acts like Girl Talk, MSTRKRFT and MGMT were there to guarantee it.
But as always, it was a tale of two days. The blustery and chilled Sunday, was one for the subdued, a time to break out the blankets and embrace of folk and indie rock offering. The
crowd, rougher and older, had come for the brass of Beirut and the harmonies of Grizzly Bear, braving the cold to be on the frontline of audio bliss.
Concert-organizers Noise Pop and Another Planet Entertainment were up to their usual micromanagement and hip detail application as well, employing everything from refillable water
stations to hipster clothes boutiques to recycling education booths to appease the progressive mindset. Not to mention the flushing Porta-Potties as well. Sanitation! Making their returns this
year were interesting art exhibits and the 60-foot Ferris Wheel that had lines stretching through the vendor village.
As for the new, the festival's Bridge Stage featured a giant screen, and backing LCD arch, controlled by video mash-up artists Dubbo. Whether the videos provided visual appeasement
or seizures remains to be seen, however, this year's most prominent addition showed that festival organizers were open to tweaking the festival so as to provide the perfect experience.
In terms of festivals it doesn't get much better than this. The continued prevention of overlap of sets remains a trademark of TIMF, and, along with the small details, well justified the
price of admission, especially if you could walk 100 yards the other stage and watch Yo La Tengo after spending an hour with The Decemberists.
Who thought you could find actual treasure on a place like that?

Flaming Lips
The Flaming Lips are every bit as legendary as people say they are. Known for their
famous UFO shows, the Flaming Lips did not disappoint as the closing act of the festival on
Sunday night.
With a bright orange set, bright orange roadies, and a huge bright orange screen, the
experience was clearly a visual overload. Opening with NSFW graphic in the background,
each of the Lips emerged from the enormous, flashing vagina on the screen.
That is, all of the Lips except Wayne Coyne, the frontman and visionary. Instead, he
rolled out in his customary giant plastic bubble, and proceeded to walk in it all over the enor
mous crowd. After he made it back on stage, the band launched into "Race For the Prize,"
complete with lucky fans dressed as bears dancing in the background.
Confetti cannons and balloons added to the already stimulating experience. A man
dressed in a bunny suit began to crowd surf, and in the process landing on a bystander, caus
ing paramedics to infiltrate the pit. It was this uncontrollable excitement and frenzy lasted
throughout the entire set. Wayne suggested that the audience just stay and "take over Treasure
Island." Trust me, Wayne ... if we could, we would.

Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes
And God said, Let Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes from Paraguay be gathered
together unto the Tunnel Stage: and it was so.
While it's debatable if Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes were a godsend, there's
no doubt they played the part.
"It's kind of like Jesus," someone in the crowd murmured.
Booked for a 2:30 set on Sunday, Alex Ebert, known as Edward Sharpe, pranced onto
Treasure Island's main stage trailed by an assortment of vagabonds and kooks, delicately
referred to as the Magnetic Zeroes. Drawing comparisons to Ken Kesey and the Merry
Pranksters, who had roamed the city almost six decades earlier, the cultish group stood around
for a few minutes grinning at each other and swaying before embarking on their musical jour
ney.
And what a journey it was. While a great deal of the crowd was at first asking,
"Where's the Kool-Aid?" their doubts were largely erased as soon as the band got rolling.
From accordions to glockenspiels, trumpets to ukeleles, the group was an eclectic surprise,
packing a rich interpretation of folk rock into their upbeat songs, like "40 Day Dream."
Ebert cut an interesting figure, fully bearded and dressed in a deep, tie-dye V-neck,
which he promptly lost by the third song. He was very much the charmer, baptizing the crowd
with a Dylan-esque voice as he jumped and hollered across the stage.
Yet, it was his duet with vocalist Jade Castrinos that captured the hearts of the Treasure
Island crowd, as the two shared memories of Alabama, friendship and good times in "Home",
as they sang "Home, let me come home, home is when I'm alone with you."
On that island, it was love of biblical proportions.

irl Talk
Arguably one of the most anticipated and hyped performers of the weekend, Gregg
Gillis, aka Girl Talk, brought the energy and excitement to the Treasure Island Music Festival.
By bringing audience members (like some Intermission staff) onstage and getting the crowd
involved through props, such as toilet paper, popcorn, and balloons, Girl Talk's performance
seemed more like a party than a concert.
To say that being in the audience is an "experience" would be an understatement. I
have never in my life been in a crowd this rowdy, aggressive, and out of control. People were
stepping on me, shoving me, literally infiltrating the space I was inhabiting, and the only way
I could react was to do the same. Although Girl Talk spent a lot of the time focused on his
computers to play his tracks, the time he spent dancing and acting crazy reflected the crowd,
bringing the already overwhelming enthusiasm even higher.
While I'm not exactly sure what his talent is, it's evident that whatever Girl Talk is
doing seems to be right. Regardless of how crazy and fun Girl Talk himself behaves, his songs
act on their own, presenting a dynamic sound that resonates in the crowd, and never cease to
be catchy and really damn popular.

Limousines
The first 34 minutes of the weekend could not have been better.
Eric Victorino and Giovanni Giusti, the Bay Area pair known as The Limousines, were
charged with one of the most difficult music festival responsibilities: breaking in the main
stage on opening day. But for those hundred or so fortunate enough to arrive on the island
early enough, it was electrifyingly clear The Limousines may just be the next big in the elec
tro-alternative scene.
With no instruments, the pair relies on the force and, when appropriate, the sensitivity
of Victorino's voice. And on Saturday, Victorino was spot-on, nearly identical to the pair's
recordings of "Dancing at Her Funeral" and "New Year's Resolution."
The Limousines' single "Very Busy People" has undoubtedly been their ticket into the
Treasure Island-caliber arena, and Saturday's performance ensures the pair are poised to
explode onto the larger scene as soon as they can push out an EP or full-length album.

passion Pit
Perhaps the most anticipated set of the entire festival, indie electronic darlings Passion
Pit took the main stage early on Saturday afternoon to play for a massive crowd. With not
much material under their belt, Passion Pit has enjoyed enormous amounts of success
Their EP "Chunk of Change" and full-length album "Manners" are sugar sweet, with
falsetto melodies and catchy synths. The show started with very high energy, and the crowd
had nothing but love for the inexperienced group.
They opened with "Make Light," and when Michael Angelakos grabbed the micro
phone, it became quickly apparent that he was the weak link to the performance. All of the
instrumentals were spot on, which is often surprising for an electronic band performing live.
Angelakos' vocals left something to be desired, sadly.
His mic was turned down very low, and from the front of the pit it was still difficult to
make out what he was saying. Beyond the sound issues, Angelakos simply was not committed
to his traditional falsetto.
Overall, the set was a wonderful start to the weekend, setting the bar high for other
acts. Even with flaws, this concert proved that everybody really does love Passion Pit.

"J^JSTRKRFT
Last year, two individuals sporting black jackets, five o'clock stubble and crossed fore
arms conquered the Bridge Stage with a brand of power electronic that shook the island and its
audience to the core.
So when Canadian-duo MSTRKRFT took the stage at 7:45, they had a hole to fill, a
Justice-sized hole that was. But it's not like they cared. They were going to do it their own
way and, lugging a massive bottle of Crown Royal Whiskey, they proved it with every swig.
It was liquid confidence and electronic at its finest, as Jesse Keeler and Al-P assaulted
the crowd with characteristic synth blasts and heavy percussion of drum machines. Using their
newest album "Fist of God" as a platform, the duo built their set around hits like "Bounce"
and "Heartbreakerm," incorporated cuts of everything from Daft Punk to Benny Benassi. A
full remix of Justice's "D.A.N.C.E" was thrown in for memory's sake as well.
For entertainment's sake, MSTRKRFT provided everything they were billed to do. It
was sheer electronic energy backed by dizzying visuals, and the crowd, uninhibited by the
cold, welcomed it with raised hands and screams for every song they recognized.
And while the pair didn't have to do much in terms of creativity to placate the hordes,
the shrewdest move of the night came when they closed with a remix of Queen's "Bohemian
Rhapsody," a tribute to the late DJ A.M. who often used the song in his own sets. It was a cal
culated move and it worked to perfection as thousands performed their best Freddy Mercury
falsettos to the exiting duo before rushing off to Girl Talk.

f he Decemberists
The chill in the air disappeared Sunday evening when The Decemberists told us a love
story.
A dark stage. Gold specks on the LCD screen. These were just the beginnings of one of
the most treasured hours of the weekend. And as the band lay down the first chord of their lat
est album, "The Hazards of Love," the crowd knew they were in not for a trick as some
believed upon hearing that the group would be performing only "Hazards," from beginning to
end but for a treat.
Released in March to widespread acclaim, the album is a musical love story unlike any
other: Layered with heavy-metal thunder, breezy acoustics, orchestral interludes and a chil
dren's choir, the 14-track collection tells the story of — get this a maiden knocked up by an
amorphous forest beast-fiancee.
And Sunday night could not have been a better time to perform and to listen to
the love story as told by the five from Portland. With the forest story playing out on the screen
behind them, The Decemberists, decked out in all black, were juggling guitars, accordions and
upright basses throughout the hour-long serenade. Frontman Colin Meloy's famously nasal
tone was spot-on, aside from the water break he took during "The Hazards of Love 3
(Revenge!)," and the group maintained a captivated audience for the entire set, leaving the
crowd wide-eyed and still as they left the stage.
The Decemberists play this weekend in their hometown of Portland before heading to
Europe and Australia until February.

Grizzly Bear
With the wind whipping at 4 p.m., a tired looking Brooklyn quartet sauntered on to the
Bridge Stage. Looking more prepared for winter hibernation than a 45-minute set, the mem
bers of Grizzly Bear lined up across the stage and lazily surveyed a capacity crowd.
The masses had no idea how to react. They'd read the fuss about the band's newest
album "Veckatimest." They knew Radiohead had declared them their new favorite band. They
heard about Jay-Z personally attending one of their shows with Beyonce in tow. But who,
what, how is Grizzly Bear?
All it took was one harmony, one warm, layered mix of vocals to make the crowd real
ize. Opening with "Cheerleader," the band introduced their brand of experimental brand of
indie rock, wafting it gently toward the crowd in a combination of mellowed guitar riffs,
relaxed percussion and all the oohs and ahs that would make a church choir proud.
In the middle of the day, Grizzly Bear was the calming presence between the cultish
energy of Edward Sharpe and the brass of Beirut. "Hang on, slow down," the band seemed to
explain.
So the crowd listened, transfixed as the band went through "Southern Point" and "The
Knife." By the time "Two Weeks" was played, judging by the amount of interpretative dance
going on, the crowd had bought into the band's brooding charm. And with the sun shining
from the west in its first appearance of the day, it seemed like Mother Nature agreed.
Add them to your growing list of admirers, Grizzly Bear.
