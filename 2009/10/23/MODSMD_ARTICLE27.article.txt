The United Nations Association Film Festival (UNAFF)
is making a stop in Stanford this week in their nation
wide tour. These historically important and emotionally
captivating films focus on everything from human rights and
politics to environmental issues and disease. In addition to
screenings, panels of filmmakers and human rights advocates
will open up to the public. Such events and screenings started
Saturday, Oct. 17, and will continue on through this Sunday,
0ct.25. Stanford students get in free to all screening sessions.
Wednesday night's session started out with a heart
wrenching film about the Western Shoshone Natives living in
upstate Nevada. "American Outrage" followed the lives of
two grandmothers, Carrie and Mary Dann. These sweet old
women work tirelessly. Their life is simple and beautiful.
Their cattle and horses live as one with nature in a land they
consider to be sacred and protected under a treaty signed by
the U.S. government during the Civil War.
Throughout the course of the fdm, we watch these
women as they are physically man-handled, financially
exploited and simply disrespected as every form of sustenance
they own is grappled from them by the government. This
inspired filmmaker Beth Gage to get involved in the project.
She asks, "Why are we harassing these people? We should be
applauding them." Audiences watch awestruck as the Danns'
cattle are led to starvation and their land is torn up for micro
gold, leached from the ground with cyanide. The Shoshone
people fight back with an inspiring amount of tenacity.

To many, the film seemed dismal. In a Q&A session
with the filmmakers, one audience member noticed that this
sort of thing happens all too often and people are becoming
desensitized. "Isn't it a tragic fact that these are all losing bat
tles? You can't delay the inevitable." To this, filmmaker Beth
Gage replied, "That doesn't mean you stop fighting. There is
still hope." Her husband and co-director George Gage agreed
with these words. He is actively trying to get this film shown
to Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and promote action.
At Stanford, Gage requests that "people realize that this issue
is not something that happened in the past." The Gages are
encouraged by the presence of an active Native population
here at Stanford and other universities, that change will come
in the future.
The second film of the night, "Mustang: Journey of

Transformation" directed by Will Parrinello, tells a more
uplifting tale. It is about the ancient Tibetan culture of
Mustang, hidden in the Himalayas 2,500 meters high, suffer
ing to stay alive. Monasteries, which lie at the center of the

Mustang cultural heritage, were falling apart. The buildings
had no structural support, and were used more as homes for
pigeons and hay than for learning and ritual.
In turn, the people of Mustang were losing their educa
tion, language, ritual and sense of identity. In a valiant effort,
art conservationists from around the world come in to restore
the structure, natural paintings and respect of the monasteries.
All this was done with natural pigments used in the original
paintings, and labor from both locals and experts. Long beams
are brought in by foot from Tibet to restore roofs.
With the restoration of these sacred places, the liveli
hood of the Mustang people begins to flourish on screen.
Director Will Parinello suggests that the Mustang remind us
that "it is possible to live your life with an open heart."
Parniello went through outrageous efforts to make this film.
He traveled on horseback for five days, with loads of filming
equipment, up mountains and across rivers. He claims that it
was all worth it though.
"It's as remote a place as I've ever been," he said.
"The sparse beauty is engaging, I love those amazing open
vistas. If you love mountains, it can't be more spectacular. But
the most powerful experience is the people with their unique
optimism."
He's right, in that between the enchanting views and
the warm, inviting subjects, there never was a prettier place.
These and other films can been viewed all weekend
across campus. The filmmakers are ecstatic about having their
work shown in front of a live audience. Parrinello explained
that "without the festival, Independent film makers are unable
to show our work."
And this is the perfect place to do it.
"Screening a film in a darkened room with a live audi
ence is how we want people to see our films," he said.
