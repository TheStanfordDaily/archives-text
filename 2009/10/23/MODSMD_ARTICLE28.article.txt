As Stanford students, we are so lucky to be close to San
Francisco, with world-renowned dance companies
such as the San Francisco Ballet and Margaret Jenkins
Dance Company. What students may be surprised to find out
is that Stanford houses its own selection of dance and chore
ography talent. This artistry was showcased last Friday at the
Dance Division's concert "JUMP START: Reprising
Repertory to Begin the Year." On Friday night, the Dance
Division used faux wings and low lighting to turn Roble
Gym's Studio 38 into a stage.
Meanwhile, students from a variety of backgrounds
showed us that dance really is alive at Stanford. Maria
Fernandez, president of Stanford's modern dance company
Bent Spoon, suggested that "as a freshman, it is difficult to
fully get involved with the Dance Division right off of the bat
because there are classes going on, but you don't really know
the potential or the performance possibilities within the divi
sion . . . Dancers mostly get involved with student groups, but
don't really know how to get involved with the Dance
Division."
"I think that [concert director Diane Frank's] idea is to

try to show the freshman and anyone else interested the wide
spectrum of opportunities," she added.
The show was comprised of 10 dances, taken from
various programs in the Dance Division. Dances of all differ
ent genres and forms were shown. The first number,
"Rewired," came from the Stanford Institute for Creativity and
the Arts, and The Institute for Diversity and the Arts. It was a
bright, clean piece created by resident choreographer Parijat
Desai last winter. Foot stomping and movement made this
high energy Indian dance electric with life. The piece was a
fluid combination of three dances that had been separately
choreographed, but were performed seamlessly together. The
dancers' high energy and composed focus gave vibrancy to the
dance.
Other repertory works included "Other Suns," choreo
graphed by Margaret Jenkins and taught to dancers Maddie
Graber and Liz Schackmann in last spring's "Duet's Project."
This modem dance showcased the student's capacity for learn
ing complex choreography with interesting use of geometric
forms. It also highlighted their range of movement and their
athleticism as the dance picked up speed. Jane Comfort also
choreographed an interesting piece for her residency project.
Directed by Aleta Hayes, "4 Screaming Woman" ironically
starts out with two men repeating phrases, each one associated
with a movement. The piece progresses as two more dancers
enter stage to create a mock conversation. The audience was
thrilled as the rhythmic chant started to take on both humor
ous and social tones.
Students actively involved in dance groups on campus
choreographed the other dances. Dana Sittler from Cardinal
Ballet choreographed an elegant ballet in "Concerto Bleu."
The dance involved both the fine pointe work and the com
posed, effortless power of the troupe. "Rastaman Chant" was

the fruit of an independent study choreographed and per
formed as a solo by Kimberley McKinson. This dance done to
Bob Marley combined afro styles and modern dance to create
a smooth, cool island feel. Kimberley's strong arms and
impressive extension made the audience remark at her power
ful and soulful execution of creative movement.
The final dance of the night, "Thriller," came from
Ronnie Reddick's spring class "Hip Hop Through the Ages."
Dancers crept out from behind the curtains and wings dressed
as zombies and performed choreography from Michael
Jackson's most famous music video. This crowd pleaser really
got the audience going. It was the perfect way to end the
night.
The Dance Division was successful in inspiring the
hearts of prospective dance students and patrons at Stanford.
The pocket of avid dancers at this school may be small, but
they refuse to go unnoticed. Dancers from this performance
shared a wide range of background, but each brought some
thing extraordinary to the table. Some like Katherine
Hawthorne, a senior majoring in physics, will seek profession
al dance careers once they graduate from Stanford. Others
dance recreationally for a love of the art. Lenika De Simone, a
sophomore at Stanford said that she "doesn't have much
dance experience, but [she's] still pursuing a dance minor."
With this showcase, the enthusiastic dance community
opened its arms to Stanford, asking us to join in the fun. As
the concert director Diane Frank explained, "We gather our
selves as a dance community ... to spring forward into the
coming year. For new students, this program is a danced invi
tation to you."
