# Remote Nomad: "Bored To Death" is surprisingly boring

There is no Television
Studies department at
Stanford, or at most
other fancy universities in the
country for that matter
Dartmouth has a Film and
Media Studies department,
but at Dartmouth all they can
do in that weather is wear
J. Crew cashmere and watch
TV. In an attempt to legit
imize my TV obsession, I
gave into the Man and took a
Woody Allen film class and a
film-focused Sophomore
College course. I'm nowhere
near as well-versed in film as
I am in TV. However, when I
turn on an episode of HBO's
new film noir/detective novel
comedy, "Bored To Death"
(Sundays at 9:30 p.m.), my
modicum of film knowledge
informs me: A. that it's noth
ing like film noir. B. Oh look!
It's Jason Schwartzman, Zach
Galifianakis, the "honest to
blog?!" chick from "Juno"
and Miss Rhode Island from
"Miss Congeniality"! And
then there's Ted Danson. I'm
too young to be familiar with
his work, but he indulges my
Woody Allen-esque older
man thing and he's the best
part of the show.
The story of the show
is that Jonathan
(Schwartzman) has just been
dumped by "Juno" chick and
is struggling to write his sec
ond novel. Inspired by his
collection of detective novels,
he places an ad on Craigslist
for a private detective service
and creativity, but not so
much humor, ensues. He's
also the pseudo-errand boy of
George (Danson), who runs a
magazine and the sole friend
of Ray (Galifianakis), who is
dating Miss R.I.
The actual premise of
the show can be -summarized
in three phrases: Private
detective, Brooklyn and awk
ward. I know awkward is the
most-likely-to-be-abused
word of our generation, but in
"Bored to Death," the writers
are playing on the cultural
significance of "awkward"
instead of bothering to be
funny. The show's slow pace
and prolonged shots of
Brooklyn render it more simi
lar to a movie than a TV
show. Yes, Brooklyn is pretty,

but the lethargy of the show
neutralizes the comedy of
Zach Galifianakis, who
proves to be a great bearded
physical comedian.
Ironically, despite the
sluggish speed of each
episode, the latest one
claimed it's been two months
in their world since the pre
miere! Bogus. Ted Danson
manages to shine through
with his bawdy and absurd
subplots, like the herpes sore
on his face and decision to
hire a male escort to get in
touch with his feminine side.
Schwartzman seems to fall
prey to the writers' self-indul
gence as he plays the self
proclaimed "another self-hat
ing New York Jew." I love all
three of those things, but
Schwartzman's character is
not defined well enough to
earn my affection. He vacil
lates between mopey and is
addicted to pot and white
wine, two characteristics that
do go hand in hand.
Schwartzman, as the symbol
of the white Brooklyn male,
becomes emblematic of the
borough itself, as he gives the
filmmakers an excuse to
make choppy, artsy, filmic
shots with the camera.

Despite all of this, the show
lacks a sense of place: You
would think a detective
would have an office or
apartment to ground him, but
Schwartzman mostly flits
between Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Brighton
Beach. The familiarity of
place is key to both TV and
the film noir, yet it is misin
terpreted in "Bored to
Death."
In fact, the genre as a
whole doesn't translate well,
at least in this show. The
show is simultaneously cre
ative (skateboard gang) and
not (sperm donor to a lesbian
couple), while the conven
tions of film noir go mostly
unaddressed. The opening
credits provide a more effec
tive femme fatale than any of
the first five episodes. I did,
however, love Kristen Wiig's
portrayal of a neurotic stun
ner. Her episode, in which
she asks Jonathan to follow
her boyfriend, reminded me
of the opening of "The
Maltese Falcon" which is
playing at the Stanford
Theatre in three weeks! a
classic of film noir. Part of
the problem seems to be that
the show doesn't have a good
format necessaiy to half-hour
comedies. The detective slash
film noir setup enables this,
but the writers' approach to
the topic has been scatter
brained. Attempts to be
obscure and funny at the
same time cancel out most of
the show's merit, except for a
very timely Roman Polanski
joke!
Thus far, I've enjoyed
two of the five episodes and
am hopeful that we'll find a
balance of episodic detective
stories and overarching per
sonal conflicts. A good fusion
of TV and film styles could
bring us one step closer to
TV 101: "Bonanza" through
"Mad Men."
