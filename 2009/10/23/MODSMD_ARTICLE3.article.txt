# EXORCISING THE DEMONS
## Card seeks fiery redemption 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After suffering one of the toughest losses
imaginable against Arizona last Saturday,
Stanford has the perfect chance to redeem it
self against Arizona State Saturday night at
Stanford Stadium.
The Sun Devils (4-2, 2-1 Pac-10) come
into Saturday night's game after two consec
utive victories, both against teams the Cardi
nal has also already beaten: Washington State
and Washington. If the transitive property
means anything in the world of sports (which
it very well may not), Stanford may be in
good shape, having beaten both the Cougars
and Huskies much more thoroughly than
Arizona State did the Sun Devils eked out
a 50-yard touchdown pass with just five sec
onds left to beat Washington 24-17 last Satur
day.
With that said, it's still clear the Cardinal
needs to cut down on its slip-ups if it wants to
bring the transitive property to fruition.
Head Coach Jim Harbaugh, for one, is deter
mined that Stanford will learn from the mis
takes dropped passes, weak coverage and
leaving wide open holes on defense â€”it
made last Saturday.
"We're all learning this together, how to

NOTES ! Stanford looks to rebound from
two consecutive losses on the road.
Arizona State is coming off of two
wins, including a 24-1 7 game against
Washington, in which the Sun Devils
scored a touchdown with just five sec
onds to spare. Stanford needs just two
more wins to become bowl eligible.



get over the hump," Harbaugh said
during Tuesday's press conference.
"There's a learning process that's
going on. Players and coaches look at
themselves and [think about] what we
can do better."

Despite the growing pains still an
guishing the team in his third year on
the job, Harbaugh remains confident
of the Cardinal's future.
"This ball club is so close and we're
so proud of that," he said. "We should
be 6-1. Saturday night was an example.
It was a game that should have been
won and if we were there, over that
hump, we would have won. I'm proud
of our guys and it's a learning process,
for coaches and players, to get this ball
club to where we want to be."

The Sun Devils provide a competi
tive opponent for Stanford's Home
coming Game, as the two teams jockey
for the same relative position in the
conference. While the Arizona State
offense, led by quarterback Danny
Sullivan, is not all that remarkable

the Sun Devils rank 82nd in the nation
in total offense their defense has

only given up an average of 16 points
per game this season.
Redshirt freshman quarterback
Andrew Luck seems to be coming into
his own at this point in the season,
however, and with senior tailback
Toby Gerhart chugging along at an
other record-breaking pace this year,
the Cardinal offense should not be
overmatched against the Sun Devil
defense come Saturday.
Harbaugh had nothing but praise
for his quarterback.
"He's really doing a great job of
finding that balance, stepping up in the
pocket, having the courage to hang in
there when he knows the hit's coming
and when to take off," he said. "He's
really got those instincts."
If the Cardinal offense wants to put
together a complete game, however,
its receiving corps will have to put up a
better showing than last week. A num
ber of dropped balls at crucial points in
the game by sophomore standout
Chris Owusu and junior wideout
Doug Baldwin helped prevent a Car
dinal victory.
Sophomore Ryan Whalen, the
team's leading receiver, known for his
solid hands, was confident the rest of
the corps would bounce back from last
weekend's setback.
"It's something that you have to

overcome: If you drop a pass, then you
gotta forget it because there's going to
be another one," he said. "I don't have
any doubt in any of our receivers, I
trust all of them."
Gerhart's health and his ankle have
caused some recent concern, but Ger
hart assured the press that despite the
minor pain, his ankle would be fine for
Saturday's game.
"I guess I'd call it a bit spicy," Ger
hart said.
Regardless of how the Stanford of
fense gets it done, the team knows how
critical a win is against the Sun Devils.
A win puts the Cardinal just one game
from bowl eligibility with four games
remaining on its schedule. Saturday
night's game is all the more important
considering that Stanford's final four
games come against probably the four
toughest opponents it will face all sea
son: Oregon, USC, Cal and Notre
Dame.
Gerhart, a senior who has been
around the Farm for the good and bad,
knows that locking down those final
two wins boils down to the close out.
"We're in the game, we just gotta
find away to finish," he said. "The onus
is on us to seal the game."
