Few musicals in our generation have garnered as much buzz or as many awards as
"Spring Awakening." Beyond the fact that it has multiple Tonys and Grammys under its
belt, this musical, based on the 1891 German play of the same title, has launched its cast
members to stardom. Teenagers and young adults everywhere are obsessed with the show, fol
lowing the different cast members like they are rock stars and singing along with the sound
track on their iPod. Not since "Rent" has a rock-infused musical been so popular. After the
show closed on Broadway, it has embarked on a very successful tour; its next stop, in San
Jose, runs from Oct. 28 until Nov. 2. Intermission was lucky enough to catch up with Christy
Altomare, who stars as Wendla, the sexually troubled teen who is looking for guidance.

Intermission (I): How did you get the opportunity to tour with "Spring Awakening?"
Christy Altomare (CA): It was my senior year at Cincinnati University's Conservatory of
the Arts and we do these things called "showcases," where different casting directors watch us
perform. The casting director for "Spring Awakening" was there, and I was told to come and
audition privately. I went to New York and got the part! This show has been the most amazing
thing that has ever happened to me.


(I): What was the rehearsal process like? Was it intense?
CA: Basically right after I graduated, I moved to New York. We rehearsed in a building on
42nd Street, and that was just crazy. We rehearsed for a month, worked with most of the origi
nal creative team and got close with the kids in the original cast. Lea Michele (original
Wendla, now star of "Glee") gave me some really kind words, which is so nice to hear from
somebody who created the role.

(I): What do you think the ideal audience demographic for "Spring Awakening" is?
CA: I honestly think that this show speaks to every generation. Everybody has either grown
up or is growing up. This theme of coming of age is universal. I think parents should definite
ly bring their young teenagers, just to open up this dialogue about sex and love. Kids know all
about sex they just don't know when it is appropriate. This show is definitely a cautionary
tale, with real life lessons.

(I): Do you have any advice for Stanford students pursuing the arts after college?
CA: Basically, connections are everything. You really just have to be nice to everybody, not
burn any bridges and keep in touch. Also, bring your heart
into everything you do. They aren't looking for the best
singers or the best dancers, but who brings the most heart into
the role. Bring your heart with everything you do.

"Spring Awakening" will be in San Jose from Oct. 28
until Nov. 2, with a student discount price of $22.50.
