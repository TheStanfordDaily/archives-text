# ALUMS FIND WAY BACK TO THE FARM
## Thousands of alumni and their families are expected for Alumni Weekend festivities

A group of adults carrying cardinal tote bags
engaged in enthusiastic conversation as they
walked through the Quad. An older man don
ning a red-stringed nametag whizzed by on his
bicycle, smiling contentedly as he passed a "Wel
come Alumni" banner and red and white bal
loons decorating the front of the bookstore.
These scenes and others will fill a four-day
whirlwind of events this weekend, when thou
sands of alumni, as well as their family and
friends, will return to Stanford.
Walking along Lasuen Mall, a woman in a
brown sweater gazed around wistfully at a
changed campus, stopping to look at a map. Lucy
Guthrie-Keil '59 was en route to Old Union,
where she lived during her last two years at
Stanford. She'd traveled from Asheville, N.C, to
attend her class' 50-year reunion.
"It's interesting to sort of try to put together
50 years," she said. "Who was I then? Who am I
now? What happened in between? Fifty years is
a long time."

This wasn't Guthrie-Keil's first time return
ing to campus she also attended her 35 and
40-year reunions but she couldn't help but
notice how much the campus had evolved.

"There's not very much that feels familiar,"
she reminisced. "The Quad does, I guess, and
Memorial Church. You kind of reach for memo
ries and feelings. I think it's the feelings that re
ally hit you That feeling of being a very inse
cure freshman."

Yet reunion weekend doesn't merely attract
older alumni from far reaches of the country.
Richard Jones 'O7 lives just 15 minutes away
from campus, attends every home football game
and still plays rugby for the Graduate School of
Business. Regardless, he plans to partake in the
weekend's festivities.

"Being back on campus and seeing all the
kids, especially freshmen, really takes me back
to freshman year," he laughed. "Being lost, not
having any real work, partying all the time be
cause of said lack of work, meeting all the peo
ple who would become your good friends over
the coming years. Oh, to be young again."
And despite his own proximity to campus,
Jones looks forward to reuniting with some of
his college friends, whom he no longer sees reg
ularly due to demands of the "real world."
"I'm coming back for Homecoming just be
cause it's a good opportunity to see the people I
might not be fortunate enough to see often, both

those still in school and graduated,"
he explained. "Once you start work
ing, it's hard to take time off to visit
old friends."
Yet not all alumni will be flocking
to their alma mater this weekend.
Some alumni chose to forgo their
Stanford reunions altogether, citing
the less intimate setting as a deter
rent from attending.
"I have not attended any Stan
ford Reunions, although I came
close to attending my 20th," said
Leif Carlson 'B2 in an e-mail to The
Daily. "At the last minute, my wife,
Lena, and I opted for dinner in Palo
Alto instead. I guess I feel much
more comfortable sharing an inti
mate dinner and wine with an old
friend or two whom I may not have
seen for a long while, rather than en
gaging in superficial small talk."
For the alumni who have chosen

to attend the Homecoming activi
ties, there is an impressive array of
events for visitors to attend: Tours,
open houses, sporting events, con
certs, tailgates, speeches and recep
tions. And the time and money that
the school funneled into the week
end has not gone unnoticed.
"I think it's terrific that the Uni
versity puts so much effort into re
unions," Guthrie-Keil said. "The
planning, the arrangements, the
classes without quizzes, dinner on
the Quad it makes people want
to come back."

Yet despite the plethora of pro
gramming, to the alumni, it is the
company of former classmates that
matters most, as last year's brought
back more than 8,700 alumni.
"The most important thing is the
people," Guthrie-Keil said. "It's a
time to talk to friends. It's amazing
that you can keep connection with
people over 50 years, spread out all
over the country, with different
lives."
