## 44th Annual McClatchy Symposium Experts debate future of news 
### ALYSSA AHLUWALIA 
Fresh off another announcement of
layoffs at The New York Times, finan
cial considerations are clearly on the
minds of editors at top media institu
tions.
"Good journalism without a viable
business model sows the seeds of its
own demise," said Philip Balboni, pres
ident and CEO of the Global Post, at
the 44th Annual Kelly McClatchy
Memorial Symposium on Thursday.
The event was titled, "New Times: The
Future of Journalism."
"On a scale of one to 10 of healthy
media, we're somewhere around two,"
added Alberto Ibarguen, president and
CEO of the Knight Foundation.
The panel, including Balboni, Ibar
guen, ProPublica Editor in Chief Paul
Steiger and Martin Nisenholtz, senior
vice president of digital operations for
The New York Times, focused on the
current challenges faced by print media
in an increasingly media-driven society.

Yet, perhaps the main surprise of the
night was not the panelists who attend
ed, but rather the one who did not.
Arthur Sulzberger, CEO of The New
York Times, was originally scheduled to
participate in the panel, but was an
nounced absent due to illness.
Joel Brinkley, visiting Hearst profes
sional in residence at Stanford Univer
sity, moderated the discussion.
One of the first concerns addressed
was newsprint's decline in revenue as a
result of free online content.
Steiger offered his belief that his in
dependent, non-profit newsroom,
ProPublica, has the potential to achieve
successful financial stability through a
combination of nonprofit funding and
volunteerism.
"We have a grant from the Knight
foundation and we are working for re
sources to diversify funding," he said.
"We find that this allows us to be a non
partisan producer of reporting."
Balboni introduced the alternative
option to achieve a direct source of rev

enue through what he deems "online
monetization," the charging of readers
for use of news online, as a means of es
tablishing a news organization's self
sufficiency.
"Excellence in journalism goes hand
in hand with good business," he ex
plained. "A high quality, principled
news organization that is also a com
mercial success has conquered the
great challenge and opportunity of our
time."
Yet, it was Nisenholtz who explained
the delicate dilemma in charging cus
tomers who had previously enjoyed
content for free.
"There's a fine line, a balance that
needs to be taken into account that
stops [The New York Times from deci
sively engaging in online monetiza
tion]," he said. "The problem with
charging out of the gate is that you
don't have much trial... you need a
significant constituency to charge what
you want without risking your survival
as a news organization."

Despite their views, the panelists
were in agreement that the Internet
brings an audience of unprecedented
scope, both nationally and internation
ally, to news. The problem is simply that
with the increasing rate of technologi
cal advancement comes the demanding
responsibility that journalists adapt to
new forms of practice.
The Internet giveth and the Internet
taketh away,'" Ibarguen said, quoting
Nisenholtz in addressing a disgruntled
audience member about layoffs of
Times journalists. "Everybody has digi
tal access, so there is possibility to have
demand for where we're going, digital
and mobile.
"[Once the] country [has] access to
that, we will have models that will main
tain the beat journalism in a new form
of media," he added.
