## Energy plan will cost $250 million Goal is to increase energy efficiency, decrease energy consumption 
### HEMING YIP 
In a commitment to reduce campus energy use and boost en
ergy efficiency, the University last week released the Energy
and Climate Plan, a $250 million commitment to incorporate re
newable sources into the campus power supply.
Developed by the Department of Sustainability and Energy
Management, the plans aim to cut Stanford's green house gas
(GHG) emissions 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, while si
multaneously lowering domestic water consumption by 18 per
cent.
Along the lines of previous plans, the initiative promotes
lower energy usage in both existing buildings and future con
struction. New buildings are required to be 30 percent more en
ergy efficient than is required by California building standards.
Yet, among the most extensive plans for conservation will be
the transition away from energy provided by the University
owned natural gas-powered facility on the corner of Campus
Drive and Via Ortega. The largest source of the University's
GHG emissions, the facility is nearing the end of its useful life,
according to the report.
When the plant eventually does shut down, the University
will begin to purchase energy from private company Pacific Gas
& Electric (PG&E), which is currently bound by Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's executive order for utilities companies to
generate 33 percent of their power from renewable sources by
2020.
This transition will mean that at least one-third of the Uni
versity's energy supply will come from renewable energy
sources instead of carbon-intensive fossil fuels.
Another facet of the plan involves a significant overhaul of
the heating and cooling systems on campus, both of which re
quire significant energy use,
"We knew that our chillers and cooling towers consumed a
lot of energy and water to get rid of unwanted heat in the cool
ing process," said Joe Stagner, executive director of the Depart
ment of Sustainability and Energy Management, in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Knowing this, the group devised a plan to get rid of unwant
ed heat by warming chilled water and then evaporating it into
the air, so that the excess heat could be captured and used to
meet heating demands on campus, which would otherwise be
fulfilled by burning fossil fuel. This regeneration will reuse up to
70 percent of the heat discharged from the air conditioning sys
tem to meet nearly half of Stanford's heating needs, cutting
water use by 18 percent; it will result in the elimination of need
for cooling towers.
In tough economic times and under budget constraints, pro
ponents worldwide have argued that energy efficiency can be
good for the environment, as well as for bank accounts. Deter
mined to demonstrate that development does not have to come
at the expense of our environment, the Energy and Climate
Plan, despite a $250 million price tag, will result in long-term cost
