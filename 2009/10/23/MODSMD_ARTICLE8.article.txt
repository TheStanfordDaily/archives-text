## Mayor sets goal for emission reduction City wants five percent CO2 reduction by 2012 
### ADAM COLE 
Amid the whir of bike wheels, the
flapping of the United Nations flag
and the gleam of Tesla's new all-elec
tric roadster, Palo Alto officials last
week announced a new environmen
tal city goal at the kickoff of the Unit
ed Nations Association Film Festi
val.

At the event, Mayor Peter Drek
meier encouraged Palo Alto citizens
to embrace the theme of this year's
event, "Energy and the World," and
strive for a five percent reduction in
carbon dioxide emissions by 2012.
The event, featuring demonstrations
of a bike-powered generator and a
plug-in engine, hosted a loose coali
tion of green community organiza
tions, including Wave One, Acterra
and the Community Environmental
Action Partnership (CEAP).
Currently working with the city,
Wave One helps businesses finds
ways to reduce their carbon foot
print. Acterra offers a free in-home
consultation on energy conservation.
CEAP, formed in 2008 by the Palo
Alto City Council, strives to connect
these groups and involve the com
munity in environmental initiatives
like zero waste and emissions reduc
tion.

Drekmeier hoped that groups
like these could help Palo Alto, a city
with a long history of environmental
action, combat the threat of global
warming.

"It's part of Palo Alto culture,"
the mayor said. "We started protect
ing our bay lands back in the 19205."
According to CEAP Chairman
Walt Hays, Palo Alto is one of the na

tion's current environmental leaders.
This comes as no surprise to the city
council, which listed environmental
protection as one of its top three pri
orities.
In terms of simple conservation
practices, Debbie Mytels, associate
director of Acterra, said residents
could save energy by finding "the low
hanging fruit of conservation," in
cluding fixing leaking heating ducts
and using compact fluorescent light
bulbs.
But obstacles remain.
"People are very busy," Drek
meier said. "Reducing their carbon
footprint is a luxury of time."
For Charles Keenan, a real estate
developer who worked with Wave
One, money is the major barrier in
preventing the transition to green
practices. While he hopes advances
in green technology can make envi
ronmental efforts economically vi
able, he believes they are currently
not.
"If it takes subsidy, it's not sus
tainable," he said.
Drekmeier disagreed. "Economi
cally, it makes sense," he said. "Effi
ciency is much more lucrative than
building more power plants."
A five percent reduction in car
bon emissions, he added, is afford
able and attainable. Local govern
ment operations have already re
duced their emissions by 11 percent
since 2005.
Hays believes this is just a small
step in the right direction, saying the
real challenge is in reducing emission
by 80 percent by 2050.
"If the ocean [levels rise] eight or
five feet, Palo Alto is a community
that will definitely be affected," he
said.
