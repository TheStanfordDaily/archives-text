## Marriage fight heads to Maine LGBT activists work phone banks, lobby against proposed gay marriage ban 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
California LGBT supporters, regrouping following the
passage of Proposition 8 last year, are now carrying on the gay
marriage fight remotely. For the past two weekends, Stanford
students have made over 1,200 calls as part of a larger phone
banking effort against Maine's Question 1.
Similar to Prop. 8, Maine's Question 1 puts the question of
same-sex marriage to a popular vote. Maine Gov. John
Baldacci signed legislation allowing same-sex couples to
marry earlier in the year, which prompted opposition advo
cates to petition for a formal, popular vote to be held Nov. 3.
In conjunction with Equality California (EQCA) and
Maine Equality, the Emma Goldman Society for Queer
Liberation organized phone banks at the LGBT Community
Resources Center to assist with the anti-Question 1 cam
paign.
"The purpose of a phone bank is not to argue with those
who disagree with us but to get out the vote," said organizer
Ben Casement TO in an e-mail to The Daily. "Many people
are confused by the way Question lis worded... We clarify
this, we encourage them to vote early."
Saturday, nine people participated in the phone bank, log
ging 750 calls to Maine voters.
One of the callers, Justine Massey TO, said the phone call
ing was overall a pleasant experience. Massey, who was
abroad in Madrid last year, decided to contribute after she
learned Proposition 8 had passed.
"It's really easy to do," she said. "We're having conversa
tions with people who agree with us and just need help under
standing the issue and encouragement to go out to the polls."
The phone bank was just one of many put on by EQCA
across the state.
According to EQCA Marriage Director Marc Solomon,
callers have already surpassed their original target of 25,000
calls. A third of out-of-state calls regarding Question 1 have
come from California.
Comparing the population of Maine to that of the city of
San Diego, Solomon stressed that the two states have very dif
ferent political climates. But, he said, EQCA is committed to
fight for equal rights everywhere.
"Following Proposition 8, there has been a huge sensitivi
ty to the issue," Solomon said. "Lots of people woke up and
wished they had done more before the proposition. I think
people don't want our allies to go through what we went
through."
Whether or not Question 1 will be passed is still very much
in the air, said Casement. National groups on both sides of the
issue have descended on the Maine case, relocating the gay
marriage battle ground across the country.
"If we win in Maine, it will be the first time gay marriage
has won at the ballot box," Casement said. "It would be a big
milestone."
