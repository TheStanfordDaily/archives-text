## WEBB 2.0 Etiquette, Shmetiquette or Good Food, Bad Manners 
### Kevin Webb 
As happens more often than perhaps I
should admit, the inspiration for this
column came with a sandwich.
The other day I was sitting at a table, glee
fully devouring a gigantic sub, when the
thought struck: I could be doing this with my
elbows on the table. And why not? Some
where in the dark recesses of my mind, I re
called a Miss Manners column (which I read
during the time be tween finishing the comics
and my cereal) where she tersely scolded her
readers for their misplaced elbows; I remem
bered that she was rude, but I couldn't re
member why.
And so, bereft of a justification for this ar
chaic rule, I planted my elbows on the table
and ate and what a wonderful decision it
was. Suddenly the distance between my
sandwich at rest and my mouth was halved,
possibly even thirded, which did wonders for
my eating efficiency. So incredible was it that
I am now wholeheartedly convinced that
natural selection shaped the human arm to
rest on a table while eating; I can easily see a
situation where our ancestors who used the
stone table for forearm leverage ate all the
mammoth brains (their equivalent of fried
mozzarella sticks), while their politer
brethren starved to death.
Out of a mild sense of guilt and an active
sense of needing more content to write
about, I spent literally minutes on the Inter
net trying to figure out why such an incon
venient rule exists. Among the theories I
saw, the most common were to keep a diner
from tipping over the table or to help with
digestion. My personal favorite, though,
came from Internet user/Annadale resident
Oliver McKenzie:
"Most animals don't have elbows. Hu
mans and various species of monkeys do.
Since the majority of humans can't bear the
thought of being linked to monkeys, we sub
consciously keep our elbows off the table,
and out of sight, while eating."
Indeed, Oliver, indeed. Yet, despite his
nuanced argument (it simultaneously fails at
basic animal anatomy and explaining the ex
istence of t-shirts), I find myself uncon
vinced.
True, I do get a childlike joy from break
ing meaningless laws. Biking in the corridors,
recklessly driving golf carts, wearing white
after Labor Day unless a rule has a clear
ly stated reason for existence, I'm inclined to
disobey. Signs are some of the worst offend
ers; the necessity for simplicity and clarity of
message reduces most to paternalism. "DO
NOT ENTER" might be clear, but it's mean
ingless; "DO NOT ENTER MAN WHO
FEASTS ON FRESH HUMAN LIVER
INSIDE," on the other hand, will keep me
out of almost anywhere.
But returning to the greater issue of eti
quette, I realize now that this elbows-on-the
table rule is only one of many purposeless
conventions. While many long-held rules
may have once been relevant, in today's mul-

ticultural world, too extreme of an adher
ence to a culture's etiquette is, at best, elitist,
and, at worst, society-destroying.
"Society-destroying" may sound
alarmist, but here I exaggerate not â€”in
2006, the so-called "Montreal-Philippines
Cutlery Controversy" nearly tore Quebec
apart. Now, say what you will about whether
Quebec qualifies as a "society," but the con
troversy that resulted from a Filipino boy
who was scolded not once but ten times for
using a fork to scoop food onto a spoon (as is
appropriate in Filipino culture, but appar
ently "piggish" in the so-called Quebecois
culture) resulted in a trial at the Quebec
Human Rights Tribunal, and still remains
unresolved today.
It is thus not merely out of my mild re
belliousness but instead out of genuine
concern for the welfare of all nations that I
present two rules to simplify the complicat
ed, highly variable conventions of dining
etiquette.
RULE NUMBER ONE: Be nice. The
same rules you've picked up on how to deal
with people in life apply at the table; don't
insult other guests, don't pound on the table,
don't throw plates at the dog. If any of these
things are a struggle, I suspect a long list of
rules won't help much anyway.
RULE NUMBER TWO: Be flexible.
When hosting, arrange dishes, glasses, etc. in
away that looks nice and that people can
use, but don't worry to much about whether
the salad fork goes to the right or left of the
emergency backup soup spoon I guaran
tee your guests will still find away to eat
their food.
Moreover, if you are inviting people over
who care which side of their food their alco
hol is on, you are definitely inviting over the
wrong people.
Not only should my revised set of eti
quette laws reduce stress for those hosting
and attending dinners, they should also pre
vent people from freaking out over utterly
insignificant transgressions (looking at you,
Quebec). So, until I hear a good reason oth
erwise, I think I'm just going to keep my el
bows on the table. For world peace.

and say, "Good job! " those are his favorite
e-mails.
