# THE 						DUDE ABIDES
## Quite a pad you got here, man 
### Zack Warma 
Sitting here adorned in my beloved blue
bathrobe, guzzling a few cups of freshly
brewed Peet's coffee while listening to
the Stones and looking out toward the East
Bay hills, it would be pretty goddamn im
possible for me to claim my life is remotely
uncomfortable. For all the railing (justified
or otherwise) I have done against some per
ceived injustice delivered by the University
to the unsuspecting hands of the student
body, I would rather like to dedicate this col
umn to what I can consider as perhaps the
great jewel of the undergraduate experi
ence: the Row.

Stretching along the main extent of May
field Avenue (sorry FloMo, but you really
don't count), the Row encompasses 19 or so
stunning upperclassmen homes, which out
side of the Narnia/EBF/Jerry realm, consti
tute one of the most beautiful residential
clusters at the Farm. These extraordinarily
distinct homes truly exemplify the quirky
and diverse flavor of the Farm. From the
Ruskies in Slav to the Storey Bio-nerds, to
the cluttered C-Bae vegan hippies (and the
delightful Joseph Gettinger) to ... well,
Sigma Nu, the Row is a frank cross-section
of the quirky and the wonderful.
The Row is more than just beautiful
homes, though; tradition and community are
uniquely encased along Mayfield. In Haus
Mitt, for example, there are individuals who
have been taking classes, living or staffing in
das haus for the entirety of their four years.
And the Mitt is most certainly not excep
tional in these regards. People actively try to
remain in many of these locales, providing a
sense of institutional knowledge that cannot
be found often in other aspects of Stanford
life. The freshman dorm atmosphere is
hugely influential in the initial construction
of one's time at Stanford. But what the Row
offers is largely a sense of organically grown
intimacy.
Oh, the food. I can't not mention the
food. FloMo Dining you were actually
pretty decent. And Wilbur, you fed me fresh
man year, so I will always hold a place for

you in my heart. With that said, the advan
tage swings decisively to the Mitt chef
Renny. One of the more interesting of indi
viduals I have yet come across, Renny is a
damn good chef. Case in point: Bagel Day,
whereby Renny weekly bakes 200 of the
freshest bagels ever. Ever. Point of the story
open kitchens and chefs is where it's at,
kiddos.

And to the actual inhabitants of these
houses ... well, generally speaking, they are
fucking kooky, probably on average more so
than any other hub of campus residences. I
have had the distinct pleasure of coming
across a wild cast of lunatics all over campus.
But be it from getting all a-titter talking
post-war German history with my financial

manager over sandwiches, or sitting on my
rooftop blaring Wagner and Dusty Spring
field with two friends as girls in plaid skirts
walked to SAE's Back to School party, there
is an open embrace of the absurd on a cam
pus that otherwise seems content to box in,
commodity or suppress our raging collective
insanity.

Now over half way through my tenure
here at the Stan, it has become readily ap
parent that the culture of Mayfield was the
Stanford I had more or less been looking for
since I arrived here in September 2007.1 in
no way want to discount my first two years
of residential life. The Wilbur all-frosh ex
perience yielded friends who will be with me
for years, and Partying With Mirlo (yes, I
helped get those hilarious tanks made)
ended up being a hoot beyond anyone's
wildest expectations for a four-class dorm
flanked by SLE. A brief aside: I don't care if
you have ever lived in FloMo, will live in
FloMo or know a single person in Flo Mo.
Get up to the catwalks. Smoke a cigar. Talk
until the sun comes up. Before you graduate,
make it up there.
I apologize for that slight detour, but
back to the point at hand: for a Stanford ex
perience that embraces intellectualism and
insanity shamelessly, the Row is where you
need to be. Whether or not you prefer to
spend your Wednesdays at Durand for Triv
ia Night (my team won the history section
three weeks back, by the way) or Kairos for
my beloved Wine and Cheese (though you
actually don't have to pick because they
happen on alternating weeks, thank god!),
Mayfield offers an environment I am pretty
sure I cannot leave, and one that I hope
many of you will at some point get a chance
to revel in. And should you ever need to
hunt me down for any perceived injustice, I
am not that hard to find. Check the Mitt
rooftop first.

If you would care to check out Zack's rooftop,
or perhaps enjoy a glass of Chuck at Kairos, let
him know at zwarma@stanford.edu.
