# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

As a pre-med student, I appreciated
Stephanie Liou's "Pre-Med Pulse" piece
concerning how doctors will need to be more
engaged in the conversation about health
care policy. However, I was disappointed to
find that little mention was made about
health coverage disparities.
In the current system, a significant por
tion of the population remains uninsured,
which contributes to unequal health out
comes. In one of my classes, I have learned

that even with universal coverage, social de
terminants of health are a dominant factor in
health disparities. However, the first step in
reducing such inequities involves expanding
access to care. I would hope that the discus
sion on healthcare reform is focused on
these issues rather than how it will be affect
ing doctors' future paychecks.
