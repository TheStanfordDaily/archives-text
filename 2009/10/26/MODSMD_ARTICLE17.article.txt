## WOMEN'S SOCCER Netting wins in the Northwest 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
It wasn't easy, but the Stanford women's soccer
team's final road trip of the regular season was a suc
cessful one, as the Cardinal swept the Washington
schools in the Pacific Northwest this weekend. The
team beat Washington State, 2-1, in overtime, and de
feated Washington, 3-0, leaving No.l Stanford as the
only remaining unbeaten team in Pacific-10 Confer
ence play.
The Cardinal (17-0-0,6-0-0 Pac-10) took on Wash
ington State on Friday afternoon, but the team had an
other opponent besides the Cougars: the conditions.
Pullman was cold and rainy, and the wet field certainly
did not suit Stanford's slick passing game. If the Card
wanted a victory, it had to grind it out.
The first half was fairly even, with Stanford produc
ing a few more

chances but neither
team dominating.
Given the Cardinal's
second half scoring
trend this season,
however, this was not
surprising.

What was surpris
ing, though, was the
fact that Washington
State took the lead.
WSU senior Kiersten
Dallstream got to the
end line and sent in a
cross, and teammate
senior Elysse Van
Lier finished from
close range. Sudden
ly, Stanford was in the
unfamiliar position of
playing from behind.

The Card threw
everything forward in
search of the equaliz
er and outshot the
Cougars 13-4 in the
second half. Despite hitting the crossbar twice, though,
it looked like Stanford's perfect season had expired
heading into the game's final five minutes. However, a
breakthrough came in the 87th minute: Senior forward
Kelley O'Hara collected the ball on the left and drew
the defense toward goal before crossing the ball to
strike partner Christen Press. The junior kept her com
posure and slid the ball past the WSU keeper to tie the
match.
Regulation ended at 1-1, but it only took the Card
four minutes to net the golden goal in overtime. This
time, O'Hara was the finisher, leaping above a defend
er to nod in a sophomore Lindsay Taylor cross and
keep Stanford's record perfect. It was the first time that
the team had faced overtime in the entire season, but
the players proved their mental strength against a hun
gry WSU side.
Two days later, the Card was in Seattle to take on
Washington, the only other team without a loss in
conference play. Against the Huskies, Stanford final
ly did something it had not done in its past three
games score a first half goal. As has been the case

GAME NOTES: Stanford remained unde
feated, despite a close overtime game
with Washington State, and is poised to
keep it up against the Sun Devils. Ari
zona State has yet to win a conference
game, and is coming off a deflating
double overtime loss to state rival Ari
zona. But the egg in the loss column for
the Card is a bull's eye in conference
play, and the Sun Devils will be anxious
to prove themselves at Stanford.

so many times this year, it was anoth
er Press-O'Hara combination, with
the former providing a through ball
and the latter lashing it home from
about 10 yards to give the Cardinal
the lead. The goal was the senior's
19th of the season, putting her within
one goal of tying the single season
school record.
The score was 3-0 before the end of
the first half and it was the reserve for
wards who got their names on the
score sheet. In the 39th minute, fresh
man Courtney Verloo created some
space just outside the top of the box
and rocketed a shot in off the under
side of the crossbar for her third goal
of the year.
Three minutes later, another fresh
man found the back of the net, as

freshman Marjani Hing-Glover head
ed in from close range after a pinpoint
cross from freshman right back
Rachel Quon. The goal made it 3-0
and for a change, Stanford would enter
the second half with a comfortable
lead.

The Cardinal did not sit on the
lead, though, and continued to put
pressure on the Husky goal through
out the second half. The defense
stayed strong, as well, not allowing a
single shot on target in the final 45
minutes. In the end, Stanford cruised
to a comfortable victory as the score
remained 3-0.

The Card will now close out its reg
ular season with a three-game homes
tand, hosting the Arizona schools this
upcoming weekend and then taking
on California on Nov. 8. If the team can
win all three, it will be assured its first
Pac-10 title since 2002.
