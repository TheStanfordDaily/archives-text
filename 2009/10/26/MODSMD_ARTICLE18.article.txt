## Arizonas fail to take a single set from Stanford in Maples 
### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
enjoyed a rare weekend at home and the
Card took advantage of it. After spending
most of the start of its Pac-10 season on the
road, Stanford swept both Arizona State
(11-9 overall, 1-7 conference) and Arizona
(15-5 overall, 4-5 conference) this weekend
at Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal defeated
Arizona State, 33-31,25-21,25-20, on Satur
day before taking care of No. 16 Arizona, 25-
22,25-21,25-23. Both were critical wins and
the winning combination moved Stanford
into a tie for first place in the Pac-10.
"Our two wins this weekend have al
lowed us to stay at the top of our confer
ence," said senior middle blocker Janet
Okogbaa. "[The wins also] have given us
momentum to take into next weekend's
matches against USC and UCLA."
Additionally, the Arizona State match
provided a showcase of some of the talented
Cardinal freshman. Outside hitter Hayley

Spelman had a season-high 10 kills, setter
Karissa Cook had 29 assists and redshirt
freshman Jessica Walker captured the criti
cal first set with a service ace.
"Our young players have been working
very hard in practice," Okogbaa said, "and
their diligence has translated successfully
into matches."
"All the players on our team are extreme
ly talented," added junior outside hitter Alix
Klineman, who recorded nineteen kills and
eight digs in the victory over Arizona State.
"Oftentimes, it's just getting that opportuni
ty to show it off."
The first set of the match against the Sun
Devils found Stanford down quickly before
a five-point run gave the Card a 12-10 lead.
After trading points and a Klineman kill, the
score was tied at 20. With both teams looking
for the first set victory, another Klineman
kill put the Card up and an ace by freshman
Jessica Walker sealed the set, 33-31.
"Winning the first set was crucial," Kline
man said. "The game was on the line and
everyone stepped up to make some great

plays."
At the start of the second set, the Card
once again found itself down early. Fortu
nately, several runs by Stanford earned a 18-
17 lead in the middle of another close game.
Following a kill and a block by sophomore
Stephanie Browne, Okogbaa closed out the
match with a kill, and the Cardinal won the
set second set, 25-21.
Another slow start in the third set forced
Stanford to come back, but the team proved
up to the challenge. Several errors by ASU
and two kills by Klineman, followed by a kill
by Spelman, gave Stanford the match, 25-20.
Again on Sunday, the Card found itself
down 8-3 early in the first set against No. 16
Arizona, providing Stanford with something
to work on.
"These matches showed us that we can
get better at playing with a sense of urgency
from the start of each game," Okogbaa said.
However, the Card was once again able
to go on a quick run, including a joint block
