# Battling back with the Bruins
## Stanford splits the weekend, but upsets No. 2 UCLA 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two weekends, two nearly identical
results.

The difference is that a week ago it
was Stanford (9-4-1, Pacific-10 3-3-1)
who grabbed the away win against San
Diego State (6-4-4, Pac-10 3-2-2) and
notched up the loss to UCLA (9-2-2,
Pac-10 4-1-2). This weekend, the roles
were completely reversed.
On Friday, Stanford started off look
ing far better than the Aztecs the
team had good possession, was playing
flowing soccer and looked in control.
But in the 14th minute, San Diego State
junior Michio Akazawa headed the ball
from a corner in for a goal.
Suddenly, it was a different game.
Within seconds, the Aztecs won a free
kick in a dangerous position, and SDSU
senior Daniel Ortega curled a shot
round the wall. Only a diving save by
senior goalkeeper John Moore kept the
ball away from the net.
The Card then looked a little shaken
until the break. Instead of shorter, con
trolled passes along the ground, the ball
was often in the air, and dangerous in
terceptions by the Aztecs may have

brought results, save the presence of
Moore.

SDSU was clearly happy to slow the
pace down and stall until halftime - jun
ior goalkeeper Brad Byrns even picked
up a yellow card for time wasting.
"For us the game is better when it's
played at a fast pace, when the ball is
moving, when the game continues on,"
said Stanford Head Coach Bret Simon.
"After they scored ... they took the air
out of the game and we had to get the
pace faster ... [and] we had to take
more risks and pressure them in their
end of the field."

The Card was certainly better after
the break, though loose balls or a simple
lack of support seemed to break down
its attacks. But then, freshman Dersu
Abolfathi broke clear of the pack, and,
stepping around the last defender, slot
ted the ball into the back of the net.

"Dersu scored a tremendous goal,
and we felt we had a little bit of the mo
mentum there I felt we had a little bit
of the play and had them on the ropes a
little bit," Simon said.
Now there was everything to play for
the pace was fast, crunching, but fair.

Sophomore midfielder Garrett Gunther helped the Cardinal top UCLA, offering the corner that junior
Bobby Warsaw netted as Stanford's first goal. After an overtime loss to SDSU, a win over the Bruins
was just what the Card needed to stay competititve in conference play.
When Byrns dropped the ball, it
looked like the Card might just
scramble the ball over the line, but a
deadlock took the teams to over
time.
Stanford started the added period
in great form and was really pressur
ing the Aztecs. But SDSU got pos
session and scored just seconds later.
Golden goal. Game over.
It was the toughest way to lose
and piled more pressure and signifi
cance onto the match against No. 2
UCLA.
A scrappy start against the Bruins
by the Cardinal on Sunday looked
ominous, but the teams soon settled
into a very fast-paced and flowing
game. Neither had an edge over its
opponent, with solid chances for
both attacks and real heart-in-mouth
situations on defense.
It was going to require either a
mistake or a moment of brilliance for
one side to seize the initiative. Who
better to do this than Stanford's lead
ing goal-scorer, junior Bobby War-

Shaw? Warshaw stepped up in the
56th minute to head sophomore Gar
ret Gunther's corner in for the lead.
The game remained tight, but the
goal gave Stanford the advantage,
and as the minutes ticked by, UCLA
had to commit more and more play
ers forward. This stretched the play
and the Cardinal counterattacked
perfectly in the 76th minute, as soph
omore Taylor Amman placed the
ball directly at senior Evan Morgan's
feet to notch a two-goal lead.
The second game of a two-match
weekend is always a physical strug
gle for both teams and added to the
heat and bright sunshine, no one
would have criticized the players for
easing up a little. But they didn't and
facing a 2-0 deficit, UCLA fought
until the death.
"It was a pretty fast game," Simon
said. "It wasn't an easy game
there were a lot of people whose
tongues were hanging out at the end.
Being [at] home I think our players
just had that little extra to make the
big tackles, to win the ball, to get for
ward, to create a chance."
Playing against a higher ranked
team, who were unbeaten until this
point in Pacific-10 Conference play,
made this a real team victory for the

Card.
"Everyone just got really moti
vated for this game, just realized that
the season's not only one game, it's
all of our games combined," Amman
said. "Everyone gave it their all, and
I think that's how we won."
"I think we had a lot of guys step
up who hadn't had a lot of minutes in
the past," Moore said. "All around, I
think we had a really good effort
from the young guys on our crew."
"Beating one of the top teams in
the country is always a good way to
go forward," Simon said. "This is a
good step, but we need to continue."
