# Battling back with the Bruins
## Stanford splits the weekend, but upsets No. 2 UCLA 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two weekends, two nearly identical
results.

The difference is that a week ago it
was Stanford (9-4-1, Pacific-10 3-3-1)
who grabbed the away win against San
Diego State (6-4-4, Pac-10 3-2-2) and
notched up the loss to UCLA (9-2-2,
Pac-10 4-1-2). This weekend, the roles
were completely reversed.
On Friday, Stanford started off look
ing far better than the Aztecs the
team had good possession, was playing
flowing soccer and looked in control.
But in the 14th minute, San Diego State
junior Michio Akazawa headed the ball
from a corner in for a goal.
Suddenly, it was a different game.
Within seconds, the Aztecs won a free
kick in a dangerous position, and SDSU
senior Daniel Ortega curled a shot
round the wall. Only a diving save by
senior goalkeeper John Moore kept the
ball away from the net.
The Card then looked a little shaken
until the break. Instead of shorter, con
trolled passes along the ground, the ball
was often in the air, and dangerous in
terceptions by the Aztecs may have

brought results, save the presence of
Moore.

SDSU was clearly happy to slow the
pace down and stall until halftime - jun
ior goalkeeper Brad Byrns even picked
up a yellow card for time wasting.
"For us the game is better when it's
played at a fast pace, when the ball is
moving, when the game continues on,"
said Stanford Head Coach Bret Simon.
"After they scored ... they took the air
out of the game and we had to get the
pace faster ... [and] we had to take
more risks and pressure them in their
end of the field."

The Card was certainly better after
the break, though loose balls or a simple
lack of support seemed to break down
its attacks. But then, freshman Dersu
Abolfathi broke clear of the pack, and,
stepping around the last defender, slot
ted the ball into the back of the net.

"Dersu scored a tremendous goal,
and we felt we had a little bit of the mo
mentum there I felt we had a little bit
of the play and had them on the ropes a
little bit," Simon said.
Now there was everything to play for
the pace was fast, crunching, but fair.

Sophomore midfielder Garrett Gunther helped the Cardinal top UCLA, offering the corner that junior
Bobby Warsaw netted as Stanford's first goal. After an overtime loss to SDSU, a win over the Bruins
was just what the Card needed to stay competititve in conference play.
