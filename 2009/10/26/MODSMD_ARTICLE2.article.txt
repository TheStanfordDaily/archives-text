# Panel takes on economy
## Experts stress education and structural reform for recovery 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
The recuperating American economy
still requires a structural upgrade, according
to the panel of experts who gathered for
Stanford's fourth annual Roundtable.
Emmy-award winning television host
Charlie Rose moderated the wide-ranging
discussion on Saturday, entitled "The Road
Back: From Economic Meltdown to
Renewal."
The event brought together University
President John Hennessy, Graduate School
of Business (GSB) Dean Garth Saloner,
economics Prof. Caroline Hoxby, Penny
Pritzker JD MBA 'B4, Google chairman and
CEO Eric Schmidt and Governor of the
Bank of Mexico Guillermo Ortiz PhD '77.
The discussion dove immediately into the
origins of the economic crisis, which plagued
the global economy in 2008 and into 2009.
"This is the worst crisis since the second
World War," Ortiz said, attributing it to a
combination of macroeconomic factors, mis
pricing of risk in financial markets and over
confidence in the years prior to the crisis.

However, the consensus among the pan
elists was that the U.S. economy is on the
road to recovery.
"If you look at results from the corpora
tions in the United States, everybody's see
ing some improvements in their businesses,"
Schmidt said. "It appears that the low was
March, April and we don't know what the
high will be, but we do know things are
improving. Joblessness has not improved
yet, but that's always a lagging indicator."
Pritzker, who serves on the President's
Economic Recovery Advisory Board, treat
ed unemployment as mainly an issue of tim
ing, while Hoxby noted that there may be "a
good side to unemployment."
"It reallocates labor from jobs where
maybe people weren't as productive as they
could be to jobs where they're going to be
more productive," Hoxby said. "It's a painful
process, but it is a process that means every
time we come out of a recession, labor pro
ductivity is at an all-time high.
"Every recession we've had recently,
skilled laborers have come out of the reces
sion looking better than unskilled laborers,"
she added, "and that's why I think we do

care about the long-term effects of the stim
ulus on education."
One of the most heavily discussed topics
at the panel was the importance of educa
tion, with most panelists agreeing that edu
cation will be one of the largest ingredients
in America's future economic success.
"US growth is increasingly dependent on
innovation," Schmidt said.
Hennessy and Hoxby agreed that the

main problems in US education reside at the
K-12 level.
"If we can't offer every young person in
this country a decent opportunity for a good
education at K-12, we're sunk," Hennessy
said.
A number of the panelists expressed
frustration at the fact that many internation
al students, after receiving educations at US
institutions, then have trouble obtaining

visas or green cards to remain in the country.
"This is a brilliant strategy. Bring the
smartest people in the world to Stanford,
educate them and kick them out of the
country. Brilliant strategy. Great for
America," Schmidt said sarcastically to
applause from the audience and nods from
other panelists.

"As it is also said, we should sta
ple a green card to a diploma," Rose
said.

Hennessy reiterated his support
for the DREAM Act, which he
described as "a very simple piece of
law which would take young people
who came to this country who didn't
come with citizenship, who com
plete high school and go on to col
lege, and give them the opportunity
to become citizens."
Hoxby said that the federal gov
ernment can use leverage to get the
states to "do the right thing, to hold
schools accountable,"
Looking towards the future, the
panelists debated changes that
should be made in financial regula
tion and the US budget deficit.
Hoxby posed the challenge of
changing the relationship between
taxpayers and financial institutions.
"It's like parents: if you bail out
your kids every time they take too
many risks, they're going to do it
again," Hoxby said.
Panelists agreed that an impor

tant question to address during the
economic recovery is how to man
age growth without high inflation,
which would put the country back
into a tight monetary policy.
Ortiz emphasized the potential
synergies between Canada, the US
and Mexico. "As a block, we can
really compete and create jobs and
become much more efficient."
Bringing the discussion into con
crete terms, Saloner noted how the
curricular changes that have
occurred in the GSB will better edu
cate future business leaders.
"We have to educate principled
leaders, we have to change the cur
riculum, which we have done at
Stanford," he said. "It's not about
teaching finance and supply chain
and accounting. You have to teach
those things, but you have to edu
cate future leaders of managed
institutions who will approach their
decisions in a principled way."
Hennessy remained optimistic,
referencing his greeting of the new
Stanford undergraduate class last
month. "They are determined to
make a difference in the United
States and around the world," he said.
