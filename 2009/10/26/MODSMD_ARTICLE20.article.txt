# Let the Amtrack Series begin
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
The most wonderful week of
the year is upon us. No, it's not
bowl season quite yet. It's
World Series week and I'd be
lying if I didn't admit I am thrilled to
see the Yankees back in the Series
for the first time in six years.
It may not be as exciting for the
Californians among you this year, as
the Yankees will take on the
Philadelphia Phillies in what will in
evitably be dubbed because Fox
loves any pun-y advertising that it
can come up with the Amtrak Se
ries.
Yankee Stadium and Citizen's
Bank Park lie a mere 108 miles from
one another, so it should make a
good week of cold weather, train
trips and total insanity amongst fans
of both teams.
With the disclaimer that I am a
Yankees fan, as is my desk editor,
here are some things that may help
decide this year's Fall Classic.
I Hope You Like Homeruns:
If Tom Glavine's immortal com
ment that "chicks dig the long ball" in
a 1990's Nike commercial is true,
then the Amtrak Series should be
very popular with the ladies.
The Yankees and Phillies were
first and second in the league in
home runs this season, combining for
468. If you do the math, fans should
expect to see about three home runs
per game from the two power-hitting
lineups.
Adding to the massive power of
the Yankees and Phillies is the fact
that both play in bandbox stadiums.
Citizen's Bank Park is just tiny and
although it is the same size as the old
stadium, the new Yankee Stadium,
for whatever reason, has proved to
be an absolute launching pad this
year.
The Yankees had seven players
hit at least 22 home runs this season,
while Philadelphia had four with at
least 34.
Pitching should be at a premium
as the Yanks and Phils slug there way
through the series.
Pedro vs. New York
I can't believe it was six years ago
that Pedro Martinez, while pitching
for the Boston Red Sox, completely
melted down in the bottom of the
eighth inning against the Yankees in
Game 7 of the 2003 American
League Championship Series.
That was one of many storied
showdowns between Pedro and New
York in the postseason some of
which have included hit batters (see
Karim Garcia), fights with coaches
(see Don Zimmer) and absolutely
dominant pitching (many, many ex
amples).
Martinez is now a Phillie and is
likely, because of his experience
pitching against the Yankees at Yan
kee Stadium, to start Game 2 of the
World Series.
The hatred between Martinez and
New York cannot be understated.
There are few people in this world
that New Yorkers enjoy seeing fail
more than Pedro Martinez.
Martinez who may not be the
pitcher he once was, but still can be
utterly dominant at times will be
looking to take home field advan
tage from the Yankees and help his
team grasp its second consecutive
World Series title. It should be very
good drama.
The A-Rod Factor:
Maybe it was his admission that
he took steroids, maybe Kate Hud
son is just easing his tension, or
maybe it's just dumb luck, but all of
sudden Alex Rodriguez can hit in the
postseason.
After going zero for 20 with run
ners on base in the postseason from
2005 to 2007, the enigma of New
York has absolutely crushed the ball
this year, hitting five home runs
three to tie games and prompting
the Angels to pitch around him pret
ty much every at-bat in the last two
games of the American League
Championship Series.
For the Yankees to take down the
defending champs they need A-Rod
to be the A-Rod of this postseason
and not the A-Rod of postseasons
past.
That being said, whether the
