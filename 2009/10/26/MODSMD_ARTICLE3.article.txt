# STUDENT GROUPS
## Students reach out, befriend area homeless Awareness of Palo Alto homeless population remains low 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Apart from periodic rumors of strangers
sleeping in Meyer, the issue of homelessness
largely remains detached from Stanford cam
pus.
According to the 2009 Santa Clara County
Homeless Census and Survey, 178 homeless
individuals live on the streets of Palo Alto. The
survey, conducted by the County as part of
their "10-Year Plan to End Chronic
Homelessness," counted a total of 7,086 home
less persons in Santa Clara County.
Yet Stanford students, separated from
downtown Palo Alto by the 3,750 foot length
of Palm Drive, often are unaware that such a
population even exists.
"We are not aware of a 'local population' on
the Stanford campus," wrote Stanford Police
Department Public Information Officer Bill
Larson in an e-mail to The Daily. "However, we
do have contact with individuals who appear or
present themselves as homeless or transient
from time to time."
Nevertheless, over the last two decades, sev
eral student groups have quietly reached out to
the local homeless population. From food
donations to computer education classes to the
establishment of a permanent shelter, Stanford
groups have focused on providing direct assis
tance to individuals and disproving common
misconceptions.
Palo Alto resident Judy Smith is apprecia
tive of their efforts. Homeless for over 20 years,
Judy Smith now lives in an apartment and vol
unteers in the kitchen of the local shelter with
Stanford sophomore Marie Baylon, co-presi
dent of the student service group Night
Outreach.
"All you guys that are even concerned and
wanting to hear our stories, thank you guys so
much," she said. "I don't have to live out there;
I don't have to live like that. I feel so grateful."

'l'm a college graduate'
Palo Alto's homeless population is one that
defies categorization, according to
sociology Prof. Donald Barr. In 2007,
he and medicine Prof. Lars Osterberg
performed a survey of 145 homeless
individuals residing in Palo Alto, East
Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Published in the Journal of Health
Care for the Poor and Underserved,
the results showed that the local
homeless population is older and
more educated than national aver
ages.
The study found that 78 percent of
surveyed individuals have completed
high school, compared to the U.S.
average of 62 percent. Most striking
ly, half of the survey participants
reported education experience
greater than high school, almost twice
the national average.
"We're a very highly educated
community," Barr said. "Every com
munity has a homeless population
and every homeless population
reflects the community they come
from."
Gary Peters is part of the 15.8 per
cent of Palo Alto's homeless popula
tion that has attained a higher-level
degree. He has moved into the
Opportunity Center, a mixed-use
facility close to Stanford campus that
Barr helped found.
Fluent in Spanish and some
Korean, Peters is well read and
aspires to be an author. He has never
had drug or alcohol problems, and
has never been in jail.

"I'm a college graduate," he said,
"I went on to get teaching credentials
elementary and high school
and then went on to get a masters
degree."
Originally from central California,
he taught in South Korea from 1998
to 2003. But when he returned, the
jobs were scarce and he found him
self in a down period.
"When I got back here there was
really not much to do in terms of get
ting a job because all the professor
jobs, high school jobs were really all
taken up," he said. He currently coun
sels others at the Phoenix Self Help
Center in Palo Alto.
Homeless in the Bubble
"I think physical space breeds a
mental gap between us and urban
issues," said Tommy Tobin 'lO, who
writes for The Daily's entertainment
section. "At comparative institutions
like Harvard or Berkeley, it's right
there you see the homelessness
on the streets. We lag far behind on
this awareness that this is a major
issue."
The Palo Alto homeless, howev
er, only barely register at Stanford.
"Some of the homeless do come
to campus," Baylon said. "They use
the Marguerite and use some of the
services on campus, but none I know
of stay here."
Libraries Director of
Communications and Development,
Andrew Herkovic maintained that
while there have been complaints of
homeless and indigent persons in
libraries, the situations only occur
"from time to time."
"It is certainly true that from time

to time people that don't fit the
Stanford student profile show up in
either Green or Meyer, particularly
Meyer's 24-hour study room,"
Herkovic said. "They are not there
to use info resources, but are there to
either stay warm or be entertained
or whatever else."
Library access policy allows non
students to utilize facilities in Green
for seven days in a year period.
Unlimited access is granted to visi
tors of the Jonsson Library of
Government Documents, Special
Collections and University Archives,
and many of the research libraries.
Larson echoed the infrequent
nature of complaints, and pointed
out that being homeless was not a
crime on campus.
"If we receive a report of an indi
vidual who is described as homeless
or transient, we first ask the report
ing party if the individual is violating
a law, creating a disturbance or nui
sance, or is using University facilities
without authorization," Larson
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Stressing Stanford's "open" cam
pus, Larson said no action is taken
unless the individual interferes with
University business or is in need of
medical or mental health assistance.
"It is not a law or rule violation to
simply sleep or nap on a bench out
side Meyer Library or sit on the
ground outside the Post Office," he
said. For public safety, however,
Larson encourages people to report
any suspicious persons or activities
to the police immediately.
Formerly homeless Lorin Krogh,
has lived around Palo Alto for over
ten years, takes advantage of living

"a couple blocks away from
Professorville" and takes frequent
walks about campus.
"When I get a little time on my
hands, I take a walk over to
Stanford," Krogh said. "I really like
all the cultural activities that go on
over here. Unfortunately, not many
people take advantage of them."
Yet some students have different
experiences with the "open" nature
of the University.
"Two years ago there was a man
living in a tree on campus and we
kicked him out," Tobin said. "Police
patrol [the Lair and Meyer] specifi
cally for homeless individuals."
Students posing as homeless peo
ple on campus last year, as part of a
joint project between Stanford
Theatre Activist Mobilization
Project (STAMP) and Students
Taking on Poverty (STOP), also felt
the stigmas against the homeless.
Two students were asked by the
police to leave the premises and Will
Sherman 'O9, dressed in grungy
clothes and holding a cardboard
sign, was spat on by a passing biker.

Student Outreach
Groups like STAMP, STOP, Night
Outreach and the Stanford Project
on Hunger (SPOON) do their best to
help the area homeless and also raise
awareness on campus. Every year,
STOP organizes for National
Hunger and Homelessness
Awareness Week, along with the
week-long Food Stamp Challenge.
Since 1987, SPOON volunteers
have been collecting unused food
from dining halls, house kitchens and
Stanford events, and distributing it to

the local homeless population. Every
day, students take leftover food to
the Haas Center freezers where later
a representative from the
Opportunity Center will pick it up.
However, for the most part, the
organization does not specialize in
direct interaction with the homeless.
That goal is instead met by Night
Outreach, led by co-presidents
Baylon and Samara Nichols 'l2. They
organize regular "night walks" into
downtown Palo Alto, where students
speak with people living on the
streets.
"It's not just us reaching out to
them," Baylon said. "I feel like it's a
mutual relationship with them
because we consider the residents of
the Opportunity [Center] as really
part of the community."
Along with night walks, the
organization organizes a three-day
awareness event "Closer to Home"
every quarter and a weekend retreat
to San Francisco's Tenderloin
District.
Donald Goens 'l2, member of
Night Outreach and co-President of
STOP, insisted, however, that people
for the most part care about home
lessness but do not know how to do
anything about it.
"I think a lot of people care, but
it's more 'What do you do about
that?'" he said. "I think it's hard to
take that first step and break that
barrier."
Barr, who worked closely with the
City of Palo Alto on the project of
building the Opportunity Center,
claimed the biggest misconception
was the perception of the homeless
as outsiders.

"When you ask the people who
are homeless what is the worst part
of being homeless, it is not being cold
or hungry but being stigmatized by
the community," he said. "It's how
people treat you."
Baylon and Nichols further
emphasized the value of treating the
homeless as human beings.
"I think that a lot of people
assume that people that are home
less are not educated or had a limited
experience," Baylon said. "But a lot
of people that you talk to, being
homeless isn't the one thing that
defines them."
Soft-spoken but quick to laugh,
Smith regularly goes to church, vol
unteers and takes classes. Clean and
sober for three years she vows
that Nov. 29,2006 will be the last time
she drinks Smith enrolled in elder
education classes and was proud to
earn a final grade of 'A-.'
"I always stay busy that's the
secret," she said. "I go to school, I go
to work. I'm not going backwards."
Thanks to people's kindness,
Krogh was able to turn his life
around 180 degrees.
"Two years ago I was a chronic
alcoholic and drug addict," he
shared. "Since then my life has
changed 180 degrees. I pay rent, I
don't live on the streets, I live in an
apartment."
"One of the things that really
helped me," he continued, "was when
someone would come up and treat
me like a human being and just listen
to me. Now that's true love."
