## Students reach out, befriend area homeless Awareness of Palo Alto homeless population remains low 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Apart from periodic rumors of strangers
sleeping in Meyer, the issue of homelessness
largely remains detached from Stanford cam

According to the 2009 Santa Clara County
