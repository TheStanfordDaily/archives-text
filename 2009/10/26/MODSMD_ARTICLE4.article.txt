# CARDINAL 33 SUN DEVILS 14
## SEIZING COMMAND Nation's second-best defense can't stop the Card 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
After a pair of disheartening losses
against Oregon State and Arizona, the
Stanford Cardinal (5-3, 4-2 Pac-10) engi
neered a much-needed 33-14 win over the
Arizona State Sun Devils (4-3, 2-2) on
Homecoming Weekend.
Freshman quarterback Andrew Luck
threw for 236 yards and senior running back
Toby Gerhart ran for 125 against the
nation's second-ranked run defense, which
had given up an average of only 57.8 yards
in six games. Luck didn't throw a single
interception on the night, snapping the Sun

Devils' 15-game interception streak, and
holding them at nation's third-ranked total
of 13 for the season.
"It was just a good mix of run and pass,"
Gerhart said. "When you can do that, it
keeps the defense off balance. We knew it
was going to be hard to run the ball tonight,
hats off the offensive line. It was really a test
of wills. We just got physical tonight."
On the other side of the ball, the Cardinal
defense held the Sun Devils to 161 net pass
ing yards and 129 rushing yards. Arizona
State had only 15 first downs the entire
game, the first of which did not occur until
the team's third possession at the end of the
first quarter. The Cardinal defense also

sacked Sun Devil quarterback Danny
Sullivan twice for a total loss of 21 yards
and forced and recovered two fumbles.
"It was a complete game," said Stanford
Head Hoach Jim Harbaugh. "We talked
about playing loose, playing focused and
doing the things you have to do to win ball
games."
Stanford got out to an early lead in the
first quarter, after sophomore wide receiver
Chris Owusu's 17-yard punt return spotted
the ball on the Arizona 48. With 8:30 on the
clock, freshman wide receiver Jamal-Rashad
Patterson scored his first career touchdown

twice. Marecic produced a 28-yard gain off a reception, as well as a two-yard rushing touchdown in Stanford's win over ASU.
on a beautifully executed 22-yard re
verse.
At the start of the second quarter,
the Sun Devils seemed to gain a bit of
offensive momentum: Sullivan com
pleted a pass to wide receiver Chris
McGaha for a gain of 15, then tailback
Dimitri Nance posted a 15-yard carry
to bring the ball to the Arizona 48.
Arizona's wide receiver Jamal Miles
was then to put it mildly pum
meled by Cardinal sophomore strong
safety Delano Howell, committing a
fumble that was recovered by Stan
ford senior nose tackle Ekom Udofia.
The Cardinal extended its lead
into the second with offensive variety.
At Ist and 10 from the Stanford 14,
Luck completed a 36-yard pass to jun
ior tight end Coby Fleener, placing
the ball at the 50. On the next play,
Luck found junior fullback Owen
Marecic for a gain of 28 yards to the
Arizona 19. On 2nd and goal, Gerhart
found a seam up the middle and post
ed his 13th touchdown for the season.

In the next Cardinal possession,
Luck engineered a couple of plays
that looked more like Monday Night
Football than Saturday Night Foot
ball in Palo Alto. With 1:25 left in the
half, on Ist and 10 at the Arizona 43,
he lofted what GoStanford.com
aptly described as a "thread-the-nee
dle" 15-yard pass to junior tight end

Konrad Reuland in coverage. On 3rd
and 3 at the Arizona 21, Luck es
caped a tackle and scrambled to the
right sideline, firing at junior wide re
ceiver Ryan Whalen for a gain of 16.
"I think the balance, the way An
drew played, was spectacular," Har
baugh said. "1 think we're seeing
something really special unfold with
Andrew Luck.The balance on offense
is something we really look for. Reu
land, Ryan Whalen, Griff Whalen.
Our guys really stepped up: when they
got an opportunity, they made the

most of it."
Arizona State got a couple of
breaks in the third quarter, as Luck's
completion to Fleener in the end zone
was negated due to an ineligible re
ceiver, then a Gerhart fumble in the
end zone that turned the ball over on
downs.The Sun Devils, however, were
unable to capitalize on the Stanford's
errors, and trailed by three touch
downs going into the fourth.
With 7:57 left in the fourth, the Sun
Devil's chance for a comeback was
quickly waning, and Stanford fresh
man running back Stefan Taylor put
even more distance between the
teams when he posted a 33-yard rush
ing touchdown. The touchdown gave
the Cardinal a 33-14 lead that it main
tained for the remainder of the game.
The win injected some much
needed optimism to a Stanford team
that will soon face Oregon, USC, Cal,
and Notre Dame, who are a combined
22-6.

"It's where we want to be," Ger
hart said. "We want to be in the upper
tier of the Pac-10. Each week is going
to be like a playoff game now do or
die. We're going to play some good
opponents, and we're going to be
ready for them."

Sophomore strong safety Delano Howell hit the Sun Devils where it hurt on Saturday, forcing a fumble that
Stanford recovered when he annihilated Arizona State wide receiver Jamal Miles.

After a pair of disheartening losses
against Oregon State and Arizona, the
Stanford Cardinal (5-3, 4-2 Pac-10) engi
neered a much-needed 33-14 win over the
Arizona State Sun Devils (4-3, 2-2) on
Homecoming Weekend.
Freshman quarterback Andrew Luck
threw for 236 yards and senior running back
Toby Gerhart ran for 125 against the
nation's second-ranked run defense, which
had given up an average of only 57.8 yards
in six games. Luck didn't throw a single
interception on the night, snapping the Sun

Devils' 15-game interception streak, and
holding them at nation's third-ranked total
of 13 for the season.
"It was just a good mix of run and pass,"
Gerhart said. "When you can do that, it
keeps the defense off balance. We knew it
was going to be hard to run the ball tonight,
hats off the offensive line. It was really a test
of wills. We just got physical tonight."
On the other side of the ball, the Cardinal
defense held the Sun Devils to 161 net pass
ing yards and 129 rushing yards. Arizona
State had only 15 first downs the entire
game, the first of which did not occur until
the team's third possession at the end of the
first quarter. The Cardinal defense also

sacked Sun Devil quarterback Danny
Sullivan twice for a total loss of 21 yards
and forced and recovered two fumbles.
"It was a complete game," said Stanford
Head Hoach Jim Harbaugh. "We talked
about playing loose, playing focused and
doing the things you have to do to win ball
games."
Stanford got out to an early lead in the
first quarter, after sophomore wide receiver
Chris Owusu's 17-yard punt return spotted
the ball on the Arizona 48. With 8:30 on the
clock, freshman wide receiver Jamal-Rashad
Patterson scored his first career touchdown

Redshirt freshman quarterback did just about everything on Saturday, including connecting with junior fullback Owen Marecic (48)
twice. Marecic produced a 28-yard gain off a reception, as well as a two-yard rushing touchdown in Stanford's win over ASU.
on a beautifully executed 22-yard re
verse.
At the start of the second quarter,
the Sun Devils seemed to gain a bit of
offensive momentum: Sullivan com
pleted a pass to wide receiver Chris
McGaha for a gain of 15, then tailback
Dimitri Nance posted a 15-yard carry
to bring the ball to the Arizona 48.
Arizona's wide receiver Jamal Miles
was then to put it mildly pum
meled by Cardinal sophomore strong
safety Delano Howell, committing a
fumble that was recovered by Stan
ford senior nose tackle Ekom Udofia.
The Cardinal extended its lead
into the second with offensive variety.
At Ist and 10 from the Stanford 14,
Luck completed a 36-yard pass to jun
ior tight end Coby Fleener, placing
the ball at the 50. On the next play,
Luck found junior fullback Owen
Marecic for a gain of 28 yards to the
Arizona 19. On 2nd and goal, Gerhart
found a seam up the middle and post
ed his 13th touchdown for the season.

In the next Cardinal possession,
Luck engineered a couple of plays
that looked more like Monday Night
Football than Saturday Night Foot
ball in Palo Alto. With 1:25 left in the
half, on Ist and 10 at the Arizona 43,
he lofted what GoStanford.com
aptly described as a "thread-the-nee
dle" 15-yard pass to junior tight end

Konrad Reuland in coverage. On 3rd
and 3 at the Arizona 21, Luck es
caped a tackle and scrambled to the
right sideline, firing at junior wide re
ceiver Ryan Whalen for a gain of 16.
"I think the balance, the way An
drew played, was spectacular," Har
baugh said. "1 think we're seeing
something really special unfold with
Andrew Luck.The balance on offense
is something we really look for. Reu
land, Ryan Whalen, Griff Whalen.
Our guys really stepped up: when they
got an opportunity, they made the

most of it."
Arizona State got a couple of
breaks in the third quarter, as Luck's
completion to Fleener in the end zone
was negated due to an ineligible re
ceiver, then a Gerhart fumble in the
end zone that turned the ball over on
downs.The Sun Devils, however, were
unable to capitalize on the Stanford's
errors, and trailed by three touch
downs going into the fourth.
With 7:57 left in the fourth, the Sun
Devil's chance for a comeback was
quickly waning, and Stanford fresh
man running back Stefan Taylor put
even more distance between the
teams when he posted a 33-yard rush
ing touchdown. The touchdown gave
the Cardinal a 33-14 lead that it main
tained for the remainder of the game.
The win injected some much
needed optimism to a Stanford team
that will soon face Oregon, USC, Cal,
and Notre Dame, who are a combined
22-6.

"It's where we want to be," Ger
hart said. "We want to be in the upper
tier of the Pac-10. Each week is going
to be like a playoff game now do or
die. We're going to play some good
opponents, and we're going to be
ready for them."
