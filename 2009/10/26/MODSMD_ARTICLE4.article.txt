# CARDINAL 33 SUN DEVILS 14
## SEIZING COMMAND Nation's second-best defense can't stop the Card 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
After a pair of disheartening losses
against Oregon State and Arizona, the
Stanford Cardinal (5-3, 4-2 Pac-10) engi
neered a much-needed 33-14 win over the
Arizona State Sun Devils (4-3, 2-2) on
Homecoming Weekend.
Freshman quarterback Andrew Luck
threw for 236 yards and senior running back
Toby Gerhart ran for 125 against the
nation's second-ranked run defense, which
had given up an average of only 57.8 yards
in six games. Luck didn't throw a single
interception on the night, snapping the Sun

Devils' 15-game interception streak, and
holding them at nation's third-ranked total
of 13 for the season.
"It was just a good mix of run and pass,"
Gerhart said. "When you can do that, it
keeps the defense off balance. We knew it
was going to be hard to run the ball tonight,
hats off the offensive line. It was really a test
of wills. We just got physical tonight."
On the other side of the ball, the Cardinal
defense held the Sun Devils to 161 net pass
ing yards and 129 rushing yards. Arizona
State had only 15 first downs the entire
game, the first of which did not occur until
the team's third possession at the end of the
first quarter. The Cardinal defense also

sacked Sun Devil quarterback Danny
Sullivan twice for a total loss of 21 yards
and forced and recovered two fumbles.
"It was a complete game," said Stanford
Head Hoach Jim Harbaugh. "We talked
about playing loose, playing focused and
doing the things you have to do to win ball
games."
Stanford got out to an early lead in the
first quarter, after sophomore wide receiver
Chris Owusu's 17-yard punt return spotted
the ball on the Arizona 48. With 8:30 on the
clock, freshman wide receiver Jamal-Rashad
Patterson scored his first career touchdown

Redshirt freshman quarterback did just about everything on Saturday, including connecting with junior fullback Owen Marecic (48)
twice. Marecic produced a 28-yard gain off a reception, as well as a two-yard rushing touchdown in Stanford's win over ASU.
