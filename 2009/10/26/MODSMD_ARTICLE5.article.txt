### VIVIANA ARCIA 
The Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital at Stanford is now $lOO million
closer to the funding it needs for its
expansion goals, following a large dona
tion.

The expansion is part of the larger
Stanford University Medical Center
Renewal Project initiated in 2007, which
includes plans to build a new adult hospi
tal and replace outdated laboratory facil
ities in the School of Medicine.

The gift came from the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation, which is tak
ing the lead on funding for the Hospital.
According to Director of
Development Communications Jose
Gordon, the funds from the Packard
Foundation "will be earmarked for the
expansion component, which includes
building 441,500 square feet of new facil
ities on the current site,
"These new facilities will add 104
beds, feature single-patient rooms, house
surgical, diagnostic and treatment rooms;
and include nursing, support and admin
istrative offices and clinics," he wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.
Currently, the Children's Hospital is in
the process of raising over $5OO million of
its needed funds for the remodel, known
as the Breaking New Ground Project. It
has raised $297 million to date, according
to Gordon.
"The Breaking New Ground cam
paign will fund the planned children's
hospital expansion, pediatric training and
research at the School of Medicine
through endowed fellowships, faculty
scholar awards and research funds,"
Gordon said.
The funding will also go toward med
ical bills for children without insurance,
said Gordon.
