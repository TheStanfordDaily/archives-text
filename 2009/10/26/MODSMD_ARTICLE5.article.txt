## Expansion project gets donation Foundation pledges $100 million to expand hospital 
### VIVIANA ARCIA 
The Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital at Stanford is now $lOO million
closer to the funding it needs for its
expansion goals, following a large dona
tion.

The expansion is part of the larger
Stanford University Medical Center
Renewal Project initiated in 2007, which
includes plans to build a new adult hospi
tal and replace outdated laboratory facil
ities in the School of Medicine.

The gift came from the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation, which is tak
ing the lead on funding for the Hospital.
According to Director of
Development Communications Jose
Gordon, the funds from the Packard
Foundation "will be earmarked for the
expansion component, which includes
building 441,500 square feet of new facil
ities on the current site,
"These new facilities will add 104
beds, feature single-patient rooms, house
surgical, diagnostic and treatment rooms;
and include nursing, support and admin
istrative offices and clinics," he wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.
Currently, the Children's Hospital is in
the process of raising over $5OO million of
its needed funds for the remodel, known
as the Breaking New Ground Project. It
has raised $297 million to date, according
to Gordon.
"The Breaking New Ground cam
paign will fund the planned children's
hospital expansion, pediatric training and
research at the School of Medicine
through endowed fellowships, faculty
scholar awards and research funds,"
Gordon said.
The funding will also go toward med
ical bills for children without insurance,
said Gordon.
Following the fundraising period,
the start of construction is still
dependent, however, on approvals by
state and city planning offices.
"The City of Palo Alto is currently
conducting the required
Environmental Impact Report
process for the Renewal Project, and
review by the California Office of
Statewide Health Planning and
Development (OSHPD) must also be
completed," Gordon said. "Once the
City and OSHPD have approved the
project, construction of the hospitals
can begin and is expected to take at
least five years."
Although $lOO million will come
from the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation, the Renewal Project's
remaining funds will come from a
variety of sources.
"Funding for the expansion will
come from a combination of chil
dren's hospital income and operating
reserves, new debt issuance and pub
lic philanthropy," Gordon said. "Last

year, more than 8,000 donors made
gifts in support of Packard Children's
Hospital and the pediatric programs
of Stanford School of Medicine."
The Foundation will also continue
its lead role in supporting the project.
"The David and Lucile Packard
Foundation has been a long-time hin
der of the [hospital]," said Catherine
England, communications officer for
the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation, in an e-mail to The Daily.
Gordon said the expansion effort
centers around continuing to achieve
the hospital's main goals.
"Expansion will allow Packard
Children's to sustain its mission of
caring for any child in our communi
ty; provide the community's children
access to the most advanced cures,
treatments and technologies per
formed by the best minds in pediatric
medicine," Gordon said.
The project, according to Gordon,
will ultimately "advance family-cen
tered care and maintain our status as
a world-class hospital devoted entire
ly to the care of babies, children, ado
lescents and expectant mothers."
