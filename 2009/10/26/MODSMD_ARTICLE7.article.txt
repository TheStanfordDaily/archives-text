▼ _A_IDS!" projects one of
the security guards at the student entrance to
the Stanford Stadium.
Streams of students rush toward the tunnel
after having their student IDs scanned at
Gate 3. Some students pause at food stands,
but the majority dash to the seating section.
If attendees do not stake out their territo
ry in the stands quickly enough, they end up
behind people who stand on their seats, per
manently without a view of the game or des
tined to have soda spilled "accidentally" down
their backs when they follow the trend and
stand as well.
It's about 30 minutes before the game
begins and already the Red Zone is filling up
with alumni who sneaked into the student sec
tion and the Red Zone t-shirt clad students.
Although students have saved a few seats
for their friends, significant others and dorm
mates, most of the empty spots are quickly
snatched up, causing students to begin squish
ing closer together, intermingling the smells of
Pepsi, greasy fries and ketchup with perfume.
No one feels like sitting. The weariness
from the parties last night hasn't yet hit the
students and the Red Zone is alive with con
versation, screaming cheers and random stu
dents jumping and waving friends over to
their seats.
In the midst of this excitement comes the
announcement all of the Red Zone is waiting
for: "And now, the one, the only, the truly
incomparable... Leland Stanford Junior...
University Marching Band!"
Alumni and students rush onto the field
with their traditional costume of red blazers,
with the less traditional Mohawk hairstyles
adorning a number of Band members, much
to the amusement of students in Red Zone.
The tree is also festive,
"I want that hat!" laughs a student, shaking
her curly hair in amusement while pointing
out the neon orange hat atop of the tree's
head, with a pumpkin face cut-out on the

front and the silhouette of an evergreen on
the back.
A tree look-alike sporting a painted-on
Joker smile and the mini tree hat, complete
with individual leaves is sitting and smiling
in the Red Zone, Although older than most of
the students sitting around him, he is the sub
ject of many photographs.
When the Band creates a funnel, everyone
in the Red Zone jumps to their feet and
begins to clap along with the Band's rendition
of the de facto fight song "All Right Now." No
one misses the cue to jump after "Five! Six!
Seven! Eight!" or to boo boisterously as the
Arizona State University (ASU) football
team runs out onto the field.
As the game is about to begin, a group of
Stanford students begins to chant "Let's go
Stanford!" and is quickly joined by the stu
dent body. With that cheer, the game begins.
Many students in the full Red Zone are
barely able to see the game and simply follow
the crowd to know when to cheer.
"I just clap when they clap," admits a tall
freshman male with a slightly embarrassed
chuckle to the petite girl next to him, who
could not see the game.
Closer to the front of the Red Zone a
group of intoxicated upperclassmen takes up
the role of giving the most outrageous cheers
during the game.
"I love you Toby and I want your kids!"
screams a blond male, his voice already
becoming hoarse from his cheers and insults.
Die atmosphere continues to gain more
electricity as part of the student body screams
"Go" to the response of "Stanford."
Stanford scores a touchdown. Three blares
from the foghorn cue double high-fives
shared across aisles in the Red Zone.
"All Right Now" is played on a loop, with
students becoming more and more outra
geous in their dance moves and jumping as it
continues to play. Some students, in their
overexcitement, fall off the bleacher seats
they had been standing on while others drop
keys into plastic glasses of soda.
"Red Zone, Make Some Noise" flashing
on the screens isn't even necessary for the stu
dents to begin the deafening pounding for
which they are known. They kick the metal
backs of seats and pound their sore hands as

fast as they can on their neighbors' backs and
thighs.
Containers of French fries move closer to
the edges of seats as the noise level crescen
dos. Then, the noise stops and the play begins.
Everyone knows they've reached the cor
rect level of school spirit when their hands are
burning from clapping and pounding on
bleachers by halftime. If they are lacking
bruises, they know they need to pick it up a
notch.
After yet another touchdown, rolls of red
and white creche paper are thrown around
the Red Zone by students, leading to a spon
taneous new dress code of paper headbands
and necklaces in the stands. Students are talk
ing and laughing, certain that they will score a
field goal as well all they have to do is wait.

Sure enough, they do: 17-0.
"I think everyone in Red Zone has a crush
on Toby Gerhart," Joseph Victor 'l3 states.
After Stanford strategically kicks a low
punt during second quarter, various students
begin reenacting the play, complete with crazy
kicks in the air.
"Wait, what kind of football are we play
ing?" asks a student amid laughter and cheers.
Since Stanford is so far ahead, students feel
laughter is appropriate, but that does not pre
vent another student from expressing his
appreciation for ASU.
"Fuck you, you Chlamydia-ridden bas
tards," shouts an upperclassman after ASU
scores a touchdown.
Another student standing next to him
starts up a group cheer of "A-S-U, you can

suck my balls!" The front rows take up the
chant with relish, only to stop when they
notice that the A, S and U flags spelled USA
when seen from the Red Zone.
Quickly, a student in a white fisherman's
hat coated in "Beat Cal" buttons and Stanford
stickers begins to conduct a cheer of "U-S-A",
drowning out the feeble cheers from the ASU
section in the far corner.
By the end of the fourth quarter, the
majority of Stanford students have left the
Red Zone to begin celebrating Stanford's
win, but the loyal few remain with arms linked
and cheers intermingled to rejoice with the
football team. The final score: 33-14.

chant with relish, only to stop when they
notice that the A, S and U flags spelled USA
when seen from the Red Zone.
Quickly, a student in a white fisherman's
hat coated in "Beat Cal" buttons and Stanford
stickers begins to conduct a cheer of "U-S-A",
drowning out the feeble cheers from the ASU
section in the far corner.
By the end of the fourth quarter, the
majority of Stanford students have left the
Red Zone to begin celebrating Stanford's
win, but the loyal few remain with arms linked
and cheers intermingled to rejoice with the
football team. The final score: 33-14.

Students and alumni crowded the Stanford Stadium to watch Stanford defeat ASU 33-14. Chanting, dancing and pounding ensued.
r -m jr ove on, there are three
1% /I entries you can use.
I % / I Open your bags and
I %/ I hold out your student
▼ _A_IDS!" projects one of
the security guards at the student entrance to
the Stanford Stadium.
Streams of students rush toward the tunnel
after having their student IDs scanned at
Gate 3. Some students pause at food stands,
but the majority dash to the seating section.
If attendees do not stake out their territo
ry in the stands quickly enough, they end up
behind people who stand on their seats, per
manently without a view of the game or des
tined to have soda spilled "accidentally" down
their backs when they follow the trend and
stand as well.
It's about 30 minutes before the game
begins and already the Red Zone is filling up
with alumni who sneaked into the student sec
tion and the Red Zone t-shirt clad students.
Although students have saved a few seats
for their friends, significant others and dorm
mates, most of the empty spots are quickly
snatched up, causing students to begin squish
ing closer together, intermingling the smells of
Pepsi, greasy fries and ketchup with perfume.
No one feels like sitting. The weariness
from the parties last night hasn't yet hit the
students and the Red Zone is alive with con
versation, screaming cheers and random stu
dents jumping and waving friends over to
their seats.
In the midst of this excitement comes the
announcement all of the Red Zone is waiting
for: "And now, the one, the only, the truly
incomparable... Leland Stanford Junior...
University Marching Band!"
Alumni and students rush onto the field
with their traditional costume of red blazers,
with the less traditional Mohawk hairstyles
adorning a number of Band members, much
to the amusement of students in Red Zone.
The tree is also festive,
"I want that hat!" laughs a student, shaking
her curly hair in amusement while pointing
out the neon orange hat atop of the tree's
head, with a pumpkin face cut-out on the

front and the silhouette of an evergreen on
the back.
A tree look-alike sporting a painted-on
Joker smile and the mini tree hat, complete
with individual leaves is sitting and smiling
in the Red Zone, Although older than most of
the students sitting around him, he is the sub
ject of many photographs.
When the Band creates a funnel, everyone
in the Red Zone jumps to their feet and
begins to clap along with the Band's rendition
of the de facto fight song "All Right Now." No
one misses the cue to jump after "Five! Six!
Seven! Eight!" or to boo boisterously as the
Arizona State University (ASU) football
team runs out onto the field.
As the game is about to begin, a group of
Stanford students begins to chant "Let's go
Stanford!" and is quickly joined by the stu
dent body. With that cheer, the game begins.
Many students in the full Red Zone are
barely able to see the game and simply follow
the crowd to know when to cheer.
"I just clap when they clap," admits a tall
freshman male with a slightly embarrassed
chuckle to the petite girl next to him, who
could not see the game.
Closer to the front of the Red Zone a
group of intoxicated upperclassmen takes up
the role of giving the most outrageous cheers
during the game.
"I love you Toby and I want your kids!"
screams a blond male, his voice already
becoming hoarse from his cheers and insults.
Die atmosphere continues to gain more
electricity as part of the student body screams
"Go" to the response of "Stanford."
Stanford scores a touchdown. Three blares
from the foghorn cue double high-fives
shared across aisles in the Red Zone.
"All Right Now" is played on a loop, with
students becoming more and more outra
geous in their dance moves and jumping as it
continues to play. Some students, in their
overexcitement, fall off the bleacher seats
they had been standing on while others drop
keys into plastic glasses of soda.
"Red Zone, Make Some Noise" flashing
on the screens isn't even necessary for the stu
dents to begin the deafening pounding for
which they are known. They kick the metal
backs of seats and pound their sore hands as

fast as they can on their neighbors' backs and
thighs.
Containers of French fries move closer to
the edges of seats as the noise level crescen
dos. Then, the noise stops and the play begins.
Everyone knows they've reached the cor
rect level of school spirit when their hands are
burning from clapping and pounding on
bleachers by halftime. If they are lacking
bruises, they know they need to pick it up a
notch.
After yet another touchdown, rolls of red
and white creche paper are thrown around
the Red Zone by students, leading to a spon
taneous new dress code of paper headbands
and necklaces in the stands. Students are talk
ing and laughing, certain that they will score a
field goal as well all they have to do is wait.

Sure enough, they do: 17-0.
"I think everyone in Red Zone has a crush
on Toby Gerhart," Joseph Victor 'l3 states.
After Stanford strategically kicks a low
punt during second quarter, various students
begin reenacting the play, complete with crazy
kicks in the air.
"Wait, what kind of football are we play
ing?" asks a student amid laughter and cheers.
Since Stanford is so far ahead, students feel
laughter is appropriate, but that does not pre
vent another student from expressing his
appreciation for ASU.
"Fuck you, you Chlamydia-ridden bas
tards," shouts an upperclassman after ASU
scores a touchdown.
Another student standing next to him
starts up a group cheer of "A-S-U, you can

suck my balls!" The front rows take up the
chant with relish, only to stop when they
notice that the A, S and U flags spelled USA
when seen from the Red Zone.
Quickly, a student in a white fisherman's
hat coated in "Beat Cal" buttons and Stanford
stickers begins to conduct a cheer of "U-S-A",

majority of Stanford students have left the
Red Zone to begin celebrating Stanford's
win, but the loyal few remain with arms linked
and cheers intermingled to rejoice with the
football team. The final score: 33-14.
