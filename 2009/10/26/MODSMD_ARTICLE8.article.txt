Two underclassman boys riding the same bike,
both sitting on the seat (sweetheart style):
"This is NOT spooning. Okay? This is totally
normal and not like spooning at all."
Thirty seconds later, two upperclassman boys
seen running naked through the field between
KA and EBF:
"WE'RE NOT NAKEDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!"
Overheard snippet from upperclassman girl:
"And then Moses parted the Red Sea and was
like 'Bitches, let's leave!"'

Freshman boy outside of Terra Fawcett:
"So Terra is . . . the 'tolerance' themed dorm?"
Upperclassman girl and her friend at The Axe
and Palm, drunk facebooking:
Girl: "HEY, if I close one eye I can see everything
really clearly. But if I open the other eye it's like
gone-zo."
Friend: "OK "
[Five minutes later]
Girl: "Dude, seriously, have you ever tried clos
ing one eye? It's blue and it's white and I'm
confused."

Two girls, Suites eating club. Girl 1 tipsy, on a cell
phone:
Girl #1: T m coming to Bob. You're going to be
sorry you told me where you are."
Girl #2: "Don't get on a bike right now."
Girl #1: "I'll just run there! It'll take TWO min
utes."
