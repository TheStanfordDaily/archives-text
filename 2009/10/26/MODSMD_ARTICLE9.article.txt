## E-mail policy simplifies trash Stanford IT Services implements plan to increase convenience, reduce costs 
### GEORGE MALKIN 
Stanford e-mail accounts will be tidier after a policy
change, as e-mails in the trash folder will now be deleted
automatically after 30 days.
In a school-wide e-mail sent out last Thursday, IT
Services announced that each trashed e-mail will have its
own month-long waiting period before being "purged."
According to Nancy Ware, IT Services director of
Strategic Planning and Communications, the new policy has
two aims: convenience for the end user and cost savings.
Firstly, users will not have to worry about freeing up their
disk space on the Stanford network. Secondly, in an era of
budget constraints, IT Services has managed to avoid a real
cost associated with the storage of old, unwanted messages.
Administrators exercised caution as the project was
developed.
"We were waiting for a feature from the vendor on how
this policy behaves," Ware explained in an e-mail to The
Daily. The new policy sought to evade the "simplified
approach" employed by typical desktop programs, which
delete e-mails based on the date it was received without a
guaranteed waiting period.
Still, IT Services was ready for some opposition to the
change, particularly by users who tend to delete most of
their e-mail or store e-mails in their trash.
In an effort to address such concerns, IT Services will
allow students to submit a HelpSU request asking for a
restore from backup. Backups will only be available for a
limited time, though, and students are encouraged to submit
their requests promptly.
Most students reacted to the announcement with a mix
ture of approval and indifference.
"I don't think it really matters to me because I'm not
going to delete anything that's important," said Moses
Gonzalez 'l3. "It's in the trash because it's trash."
According to Simone Haynseworth 'l2, "It's a favor to
me because I hardly read my emails anymore."
One source of apathy may be those who no longer use
webmail.
For instance, Alfredo Martinez 'l2 switched from web
mail to Gmail this summer. "It has more features, such as
Google Docs," he explained, "and generally allows me to do
more."
The RCC from Casa Zapata, Gilberto Jimenez 'll, even
wrote in a guide to his dorm that "webmail is a bit prehis
toric" and suggested students use other e-mail programs for
most of their e-mailing.
Yet Ware argued contrariwise. "We believe the current
product to be leading-edge and one that best meets the
known needs of the overall Stanford community."
A new update with "some significant changes" is due
with the e-mail vendor's next major release, she added,
which is tentatively planned to occur in the first quarter of
2010.
