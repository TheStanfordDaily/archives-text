# BLOGOSPHERE OF INFLUENCE
## Professors use blogs as venues to share research and facilitate discussion 
### VIVIANA ARCIA 
The Internet revolution has created a new outlet for
college students to encounter their professors out
side of the usual academic setting: blogs. Stanford
professors in many departments have taken up
blogging about their academic expertise.

"I want to provide a little more information about econom
ic issues than we [encounter] in the classroom or readings,"
said economics Prof. John Taylor, who authors the blog
"Economics One." "I also want to share some of what we do
in introductory economics at Stanford with a broader audi
ence."
Stanford professors from a myriad of academic disciplines
have, over the years, turned their attention to blogging as a
way to not only connect with students through technology,
but also to convey much of their research, theories and over
all thoughts to the world.
"I wanted to create a blog to help disseminate important
research findings in the area of energy (and water) to the
general public, the energy industry, VCs [venture capitalists]
and policy makers," said energy resources engineering Prof.
Margot Gerritsen in an e-mail to The Daily.
Others prefer to use blogs to facilitate access to and
exchange of information.
"[I keep a blog] because it's a good place to keep things
like stories and links; it's a memory aid," said management
science and engineering Prof. Robert Sutton, whose
blog "Work Matters" addresses management tech
niques.
Coming from a diverse range of academic
departments, professors convey messages and per- *
spectives on their blogs in different manners. /
Gerritsen's site "Smart Energy" relies on video I
interviews with scientists, engineers and policy mak- \
ers.
"[I use] expert opinions on energy resources and
informative short documentary pieces on interesting
energy issues or developments," she said.
Many professors, like Taylor, use their blogs to pro
mote a wider community discussion on the issues and ideas
they concentrate on in their respective fields. Taylor uses his
blog as a springboard for discussion of economic issues.
Others prefer to use a more lighthearted approach to
their blogs' subject matter.
"I mention how to be a good boss, innovation and how to
deal with different people at work, which includes an a-hole
exam featuring 26 possible a-hole behaviors," Sutton said.
Because of the Internet's more informal method of

attaining and disseminating information, many professors
use their blogs as away to engage their intended audiences
without the confines of an academic setting.
According to Taylor, blogging "is much more informal
than lectures, not tied to the sequence of the course. You can
read if you want and when you want. I sometimes discuss
topics that we have not yet covered in lectures or that we
may never cover."
Blogs have a "much larger potential audience," Gerritsen
said. "Once it is online, the pieces start their own lives and
frequently end up in good places."
While Stanford students are in some cases the primary
audience, many professors, like Sutton, use blogging as a
method to put out ideas that "question assumptions but in a
form people can digest it."
With the prevalence of professors using the Web to blog
and spread the word of their particular academic interests,
the University and its faculty have, for the most part, been
welcoming toward this new trend in academia.
"My faculty colleagues have thanked me for doing the
blog, so the feedback is good," Taylor said. "The University
administration has not said anything. I assume they think of
it much as the articles I write for newspapers or when I
appear on TV or radio."
Other professors, how

ever, have not taken as well to the concept of bloggmg as a
public academic figure.
"Not many colleagues are interested; the barrier is high,"
Gerritsen said. "Often, colleagues shy away from it for fear
of it taking a lot of time and fear of possible negative
responses. It is a little scary to put yourself out there for all
to see and for all to criticize."
Most, however, agree on the high level of leeway the
University provides for professors who embark on nontradi
tional methods of espousing their ideas.
"I really appreciate the academic freedom that the
University provides," Sutton said. "It's not a traditional hier
archy; we [professors] can try different things."
Yet where the University faculty may lack in enthusiasm,
the students more than make for it in feedback. Both
Gerritsen and Taylor said that student response has been
"mostly positive."
Sutton admits that much of the feedback he receives from
his audience, students and otherwise, centers primarily on his
blog's a-hole exam, which ranks up to 26 different types of
personality characteristics in bosses.
"I didn't mean to be the 'a-hole guy,"' Sutton said. "I still
get three to five e-mails a day about people complaining they
have a bad boss."
In keeping with the Stanford tradition of charting through

unknown territory, all three profes
sors had a palatable excitement
for what's next for their blogs.
)"We are revamping the site to
make it more accessible. We also
hope, if we can attract more fund
ing, to produce more documen
taries and package information up
for K-12 and undergraduate educa
tion," Gerritsen said. "I personally also
hope to grow this into an independent
advice think-tank for policy makers."
Others, however, are taking it
slowly.
"Right now it is one day at a time.
Some have suggested I use a different
font, or add a comment section rather
than use e-mail responses, connect with
Facebook or Twitter," Taylor said. "I
will consider all those things, but right
now I am focusing on the content."
