## A 						BROAD ABROAD My Barackonversion 
### Molly Spaeth 
Call me a sellout, but this week we're
going to talk about Barack Obama!
No, I promise I'm not going to detail
how exactly we should fix the economy or
propose a timetable for withdrawing from
Iraq, mainly because A) I'm not smart
enough and B) You've already read about
900 different versions of each.
Rather, I'm going to approach the more
humanistic side of Barack Obama. Or as I
like to call it, my own personal Barackonver
sion.
Rewind to about 15 months ago: August
2007.1 was skeptical of Barack Obama.
My political beliefs did not coincide with the
youth voting bloc, the rest of my friends or
my upbringing. I fell in the 18-30 year old cat
egory and was registered as a Democrat,
which by all standard conventions would
imply indiscriminately the existence of a "Si
Se Puede" poster hanging above my bed.
No, I couldn't.
I wanted to love him. I truly, honestly did.
I spent hours scrounging CNN,
NYTimes.com, MSNBC, Politico and every
other online news source I could find. I woke
up at 6 a.m. every morning so I could watch at
least an hour and a half of Andrea Mitchell
and Joe Scarborough before getting to work
at Vogel Law Firm by 8 a.m. My 15-minute
breaks at work were spent hunched over my
laptop in the back corner of the visiting attor
ney's office, wolfing down the news updates
and political commentary like it was my last
meal, terrified I had missed some crucial de
velopment in the two hours that had passed
since I had refreshed Slate.com.

I saw what Barack Obama did to people. I
saw the inspiration he put into thousands of
non-Americans at the Berlin Wall in Ger
many. I saw the enchantment he seemed to
cast over everyone he touched and the hope
he distributed like a ripple effect.
Yet I could not believe.
Every new mass e-mail I received from
David Plouffe I dismissed as rhetoric without
substance; inconsequential promises without
meaning. I questioned every one of my
friend's beliefs in Obama, daring them to
give me a substantial reason for why I should
choose Obama over any other primary con
tender, or for that matter, John McCain.
But it wasn't until Obama's speech at the
Democratic National Convention that I real
ized what had been holding me back. In those
last few months, the pros and cons lists and
the post-it notes scribbled all over my laptop
had only served to distract me from my in
ability to believe that "hope" could be trans
lated into something tangible. I was scared to
believe: to put my future in the hands of blind
inspiration, of something or someone that
couldn't be proved empirically or beyond a
shadow of a doubt.

I can't exactly describe how Barack
Obama finally broke through my entrenched
cynicism. Maybe it was something in the
water. Maybe my heart grew four sizes. Or
maybe I just finally let myself succumb to

that which the non-jaded, hardened-academ
ic side of me had always wanted to believe.
That night, as I watched his speech at the
2008 DNC alone in my dark basement, I let
myself be washed away in hope.
After casting my ballot for Barack
Obama on November 4th, 2008,1 finally saw
the proof I had so desperately craved during
the campaign that hope was tangible. I saw it
in the hugs given and received as strangers
and friends, men and women alike jammed
themselves into the packed Stanford Coffee
House to watch Obama's victory speech on
the big screen. I heard proof that hope was
tangible, through the shouts and sobs of joy
that made Brian Williams' voice barely audi
ble. And I felt the proof that hope was tangi
ble, in one of the most significant displays of
empirical evidence I had encountered
throughout the campaign, as the tracks of
saline rolling down my cheekbones fell to the
ground, taking with them my inability to be
lieve in hope.
Call me crazy, call me brainwashed, but al
though it took a good 14 months for me to
warm up to the idea of personified inspira
tion serving as our Commander in Chief, I'm
currently one of the biggest advocates of per
sonified inspiration serving as one of our
only ways forward. OK, so maybe you think
he didn't deserve the Peace Prize. OK, so
maybe the economy isn't completely back to
normal.
But something has got to be said for a man
that inspires even my host mom in Madrid,
some 3,789 miles away, to create something
better in the world. And if the same woman
who still thinks Franco was one of the best
things to happen to Spain can embrace with
the same unparalleled enthusiasm a Democ
ratic, liberal president as the leader of the
free world, then hey, USA, I think we've got
ourselves a good leader.

Contrary to what this column may have led you
to believe, Molly is still a hardened skeptic in
most respects, although she has been known to
shed a tear over a good Ted Kennedy speech.
