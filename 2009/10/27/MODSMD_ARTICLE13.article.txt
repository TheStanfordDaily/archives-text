# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Do Stanford students have time to think? 
### Danny Crichton 
Last week, I dropped my first class at
Stanford, bringing myself from twenty
down to my new record low of fifteen
units. Since then, I have done something that
I have not done since arriving at Stanford
two years ago: I read a book not required for
a class. I also ran for the first time since early
September. I had a wonderful time consider
ing my graduate school options, debating
honors thesis topics and had time to read the
textbook for class. I even started to sleep
more I almost have the average up to six
hours. I have not felt so stress-free since I had
a full-time job.
Shortly after, I had a conversation with a
friend of mine from freshman year, a com
puter science major. He looked a little hag
gard when I ran into him and for good rea
son. He was completing two problem sets, a
written response paper and a take-home
midterm, all for a single class. He was averag
ing three to four hours of sleep a night.
Every day does not bring such a delicious
schadenfreude moment, so f talked about all
the things I had been doing since dropping
that one class. He responded with a line that
I have now heard from three different people
this week: "Danny, I wish I had time to
think."
According to people wiser than me, col
lege is one of the most formative times in a
person's life. The openness of campus, the
wealth of resources and the diversity of opin
ions and thought can shape the thinking of
individuals for their entire lives. What hap
pens, though, when there simply is no time to
take advantage of all this school has to offer?
Are problem sets really all there is to gain
from a Stanford education?
I am not the only person concerned about
this topic. The Faculty Senate has just ap
proved the creation of a new commission to
study undergraduate education at Stanford,
the kind of all-encompassing commission
that leads to big changes at a university.
Dean Bravman placed the new commis
sion in a good context. According to Stan
ford's news report, he said that there was

nothing but movies and parties at night dur
ing his time as an undergrad. Now, there is in
tense scheduling of time well into the
evening, several hours longer than in the
past.
Is this the sort of education that leads to
original and innovative leaders of industry
and government?
When Joseph Lieberman, a distinguished
senator with tremendous power and a critical
vote in the Senate came to Stanford last
week, students could not even be bothered to
fill a couple hundred seats. The answer was
the same for the six I asked to join me: "I'm
just too busy." Funny, Senator Lieberman
managed to take two flights in the same day
from Washington, D.C. to give that speech.

It is all a matter of priorities. As students,
we choose what courses we take. We are cer
tainly the first to blame when it comes to
overloaded schedules. Taking five (some
times six!) classes a quarter is no way to cre
ate thinking time. Indeed, the focus on well
ness at this school should be better linked
with this cause of stress.
Students though, can only take part of the
blame. In my estimation, the main driver of
this increased scheduling is the courses them
selves. Bravman in his talk used introductory
chemistry as an example (scheduling
midterms every other week), but one can go
to classes throughout the university and see
that the quantity of work is inconsistent with
the time needed to understand the material.
This is most clearly seen in the science and
engineering tracks, which need to be extend
ed to provide more time for conceptual
knowledge to sink in. When I took honors lin
ear algebra five years ago at my state school,
I had 16 weeks to read and understand the
material. Stanford students have six. It is
hard to believe that even the brightest stu
dents can understand an entire subject in
such a short period with three other classes to
boot. I have not used linear algebra since, but
I can still help others understand the materi
al. Some of my friends here do not even re
member it from spring quarter last year.
Extending the tracks will also provide
professors the opportunity to teach the mate
rial in more creative ways, moving out of the
rapid-fire lecture system that seems to be the
hallmark of science education at Stanford.
Most of us will not be here when the com
mission's recommendations take force, but
there are things we can do right now to im
prove. I heartily endorse taking a few less
units when the university does not require it.
As Twain said, "never let school get in the
way of your education."

For all the students x taking a class on logic,
there does not exist a Danny Crichton, where
Danny =x. If you found a logical fallacy, you
can email him at dancric@stanford.edu.

In my estimation, the
main driver of this
increased scheduling
is the courses
themselves.
