## FIELD HOCKEY Card tops rival Cal at home Senior Night brightened by Stanford victory 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
Friday night at the Varsity Turf show
cased a packed crowd of over 500 people,
the largest crowd of the season. The six
seniors on the Stanford field hockey team
were honored for their dedication and
commitment to the team and as these six
women lined up, they had only one thing
in mind: "Beat Cal."

After losing to Cal in September to end
an eight-game winning streak, the Cardi
nal vowed to beat them the second time
through not only because of the Bay
Area rivalry, but also in order to clinch a
NorPac West Division title. The seniors'
desire to beat Cal, coupled with the rest of
the team's hope to honor their teammates
with a win on Senior Night was enough
motivation for Stanford to secure a win
with a score of 4-2. With a season record of
13-2 and 5-1 in NorPac, the women are
now guaranteed the No. 1 seed in the West
Division for the NorPac Conference
Championships in two weeks at Stanford.
Additionally, this win moved Stanford
one win closer to tying the program
record of 14 wins, established in 1997.The
prospect of matching the record gives the
women an added challenge, offering them
an opportunity to make Stanford athletic
history.
"As a senior, setting the record would
be really amazing," said senior Nora Soza.
"Leaving something behind for future
Stanford teams to beat would be a really
cool way to leave our mark on the pro
gram."
The women face pressure not only to
reach this record, but to eclipse it. Howev
er, they understand the importance of
maintaining focus heading into the post
season.
"We have been working with the team
on handling the pressure of the success
this season, we are focused on what we can
control," said Head Coach Lesley Irvine.
"The statistics and records are exciting
and great indicators of the steps we are
taking as a program; but we are looking
beyond that we are focused on how we
are playing our game."
