## FIELD HOCKEY Card tops rival Cal at home Senior Night brightened by Stanford victory 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
Friday night at the Varsity Turf show
cased a packed crowd of over 500 people,
the largest crowd of the season. The six
seniors on the Stanford field hockey team
were honored for their dedication and
commitment to the team and as these six
women lined up, they had only one thing
in mind: "Beat Cal."

After losing to Cal in September to end
an eight-game winning streak, the Cardi
nal vowed to beat them the second time
through not only because of the Bay
Area rivalry, but also in order to clinch a
NorPac West Division title. The seniors'
desire to beat Cal, coupled with the rest of
the team's hope to honor their teammates
with a win on Senior Night was enough
motivation for Stanford to secure a win
with a score of 4-2. With a season record of
13-2 and 5-1 in NorPac, the women are
now guaranteed the No. 1 seed in the West
Division for the NorPac Conference
Championships in two weeks at Stanford.
Additionally, this win moved Stanford
one win closer to tying the program
record of 14 wins, established in 1997.The
prospect of matching the record gives the
women an added challenge, offering them
an opportunity to make Stanford athletic
history.
"As a senior, setting the record would
be really amazing," said senior Nora Soza.
"Leaving something behind for future
Stanford teams to beat would be a really
cool way to leave our mark on the pro
gram."
The women face pressure not only to
reach this record, but to eclipse it. Howev
er, they understand the importance of
maintaining focus heading into the post
season.
"We have been working with the team
on handling the pressure of the success
this season, we are focused on what we can
control," said Head Coach Lesley Irvine.
"The statistics and records are exciting
and great indicators of the steps we are
taking as a program; but we are looking
beyond that we are focused on how we
are playing our game."
Friday's game began with freshman
Becky Dru setting the pace. Already hav
ing established herself as a fearsome of-
fensive player, Dru started off the
game with a goal in the fifth minute,
assisted by junior Jaimee Erickson
and Soza. The next two goals were
provided by seniors Rachel Mozen
ter and Midori Uehara. Mozenter
scored unassisted, while Uehara's
goal was aided by sophomore
Stephanie Byrne.
Dru came back in the second
half to score again within the first
three minutes. And while Cal

played a much better second half by
outshooting the Cardinal 9-2, Stan
ford's defense was able to hold
them off, led by the strong goal
keeping of sophomore Alessandra
Moss, who made five saves.
On top of the huge win, the Car
dinal team was honored with the se
lection of Soza for the National
Field Hockey Coaches Association
(NFHCA) Division-I Senior All-
Star Game, One of Stanford's top
defenders, Soza will participate in
the match, which takes place on
Nov. 21 at Wake Forest University
in North Carolina.

Soza, along with the five other
seniors, have contributed immense

ly to the program, gathering 43 vic
tories since their start on the Farm.
Hopefully, they have saved their
best for last, as the team will set off
on a two-game road trip at the end
of this week, playing No. 1 Mary
land and No. 14 Louisville.
Currently ranked No. 12 in the
nation, Stanford will need to bring
its best game yet, especially against
Maryland. The results of these
matches are critical for the Cardi
nal as it prepares to make another
appearance at the NCAA Tourna
ment.

With a convincing victory over the rival Golden Bears, the Cardinal's senior night couldn't have gone much better. The victory, coming with the Stanford Band
and many alums in attendance, avenges a 4-3 loss to Berkeley earlier this season and clinches the NorPac West Division regular season title for the Cardinal.
