# POWERING PAST PACIFIC
## Wigo leads team in goals as Cardinal defeats Tigers 
### MIKE LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
The University of Pacific has twice been the site of near
major upsets in the world of collegiate water polo this sea
son. Behind the strength of senior driver Drac Wigo, the
No. 3 Stanford men's water polo team (15-1,3-0) marched
into Chris Kjeldsen Pool on Oct. 23 and quickly smashed
any talk of a potential upset, winning 13-6.
The No. 14 Tigers gave both the No. 1 Southern Califor
nia Trojans and No. 2 California Golden Bears a scare,
barely losing 10-7 and 11-7, respectively. Against the Car
dinal, Pacific never had a chance.
Wigo netted two of his game-high six goals in the first
period, along with one from senior Ryan McCarthy, to give
Stanford an early 3-0 lead.
"We played tough defense from the beginning and were
able to stop their offensive attacks," said sophomore Peter
Sefton. "We did a good job getting some counter attacks
and scoring some easy goals."
Pacific and Stanford each traded a goal in the second
period, bringing the half to a close at 4-1. After halftime,

the Cardinal offense woke up.
Redshirt freshman Travis Noll scored within the open
ing minute, and Wigo followed with another goal of his
own. Pacific crawled back to within 6-3, but never came any
closer.
Goals from sophomore Jacob Smith and senior Janson
Wigo and two more from Drac Wigo accounted for the rest
of the Stanford scoring.
For Drac Wigo, his six-goal performance, which earned
him Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) player of
the week, is one of his best as a Cardinal.
"I didn't know I scored that many goals," he said. "I did
n't really notice I scored that many because I was focusing
on my defense. I wasn't that pleased until after the game
and I found out how many goals I scored. It's tough to com
plain when you score that many, though."
Though Pacific is now 0-3 in the MPSF, Stanford never
anticipated an easy game at Pacific, where poolside dead
rodents have been known to greet visiting teams.
"We were a little bit surprised with how much we won
by," Sefton said. "Earlier this year they were playing real
well in their home pool, especially against USC and Cal. We
were expecting a very close game."
The Cardinal knows it has the offensive firepower to
match up against any opponent, but its success always
comes back to the defense.
"Our game plan for every single game is to play good de
fense and keep teams around six goals," Drac Wigo said.

"We did what we intended to do against Pacific."
Strong defense will be essential in Stanford's next game,
when it faces No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara.
In their last five games, the Gauchos have scored at least
seven goals. Either Stanford's defensive run of giving up no
more than six goals or UCSB's scoring streak is going to have
to give. Moreover, after upsetting Stanford last year, UCSB
