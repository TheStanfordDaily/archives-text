## SOPHOMORES STEP UP Luck, Owusu, Howell and 2012 classmates lead Card 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY STAFF WRITER 
With his team hurting and his defense out
of sync, Coach Jim Harbaugh turned to his
2008 recruiting class for help. The sophomores,
redshirt freshmen and transfers came through,
helping propel Stanford to last weekend's 33-
14 victory over Arizona State.
The contributions of budding stars like
quarterback Andrew Luck, wide receiver/kick
returner Chris Owusu and guard David De-
Castro have become integral to Stanford's suc
cess. Luck is among the Pac-10's passing lead
ers and has a shot at All-Conference Honors;
Owusu has been so successful on kick returns
that he's the front-runner for the first team.
And DeCastro, a frequent lead blocker on
runs, is one of the most promising interior line
men on the West Coast.
Jonathan Martin was the starter at the ever
important left tackle slot at the beginning of
the year but had lost his gig to senior Allen
Smith over the past couple weeks. He was
called back into action against the Sun Devils
after Smith went down early and wasted no
time getting back to work a mobile athlete,
he was able to get downfield to establish
blocks on run plays while also maintaining his
effectiveness against pass rushers. Between
Martin, DeCastro and the rest of the linemen,
Stanford has surrendered just five sacks on the
year.
"The offensive line does a great job," Luck
said.
Then there's safety Delano Howell, a first
teamer who missed the entirely of last week's

game against Arizona and spots of time before
then with a quad injury, came back vigorously
against the Sun Devils. His forced fumble in
the second quarter, a violent, jarring hit on
Jamal Miles that popped the ball loose and
straight into the arms of Cardinal defensive
tackle Ekom Udofia was highlighted by
Harbaugh as one of the plays of the game.
"That kind of stuff gets game balls. A big hit
gives you a warm feeling," Harbaugh said.
"Delano has been missed on defense. To get a
big hit like that, change the momentum of the
ball game, it's huge."
But the quintet has been so reliable, when
healthy and in the game, that its production
has almost become expected. The same cannot
be said for others in their class, many of whom
are just now finding their spots in the Cardinal
lineup.
Defensive end Chase Thomas, for instance,
has started the last three games as an injury re
placement for senior Erik Lorig. Originally a
speedy, pass-rushing specialist, Thomas is now
third on the team in tackles for a loss and was
second in total tackles this weekend.
Against ASU, cornerbacks Johnson
Bademosi and Quinn Evans were named the
starters at the last minute. It was their first time
in the starting lineup, and both performed
well. Bademosi was particularly deft at tack
ling in the open field, a skill that has been elu
sive for many Cardinal defenders this year.
Evans was so good in coverage that even his
lone mishap, a pass interference call in Stan
ford territory, may not have really been a mis
take at all the flag prompted the visible dis
pleasure of Harbaugh and defensive backs
coach Clayton White toward the officials.
Evans and Bademosi were aided by class
mate Michael Thomas, an experienced nickel
back, who was matched up with Chris McGa
ha, one of the Sun Devils' top playmakers.
"They did a heck of a job stepping up,"
Luck said in reference to the young defenders.

"They do a good job and they get the job
done."
On offense, Konrad Reuland a Notre
Dame transfer and redshirt junior who was
part of the 2008 recruiting class and sopho
more Griff Whalen both tallied just one catch
each over the Cardinal's first five games, but
have now begun to see more playing time,
Reuland, who has a knack for finding holes
in coverage and picking up considerable

yardage, has over 100 yards in the past three
games as Stanford's third tight end. Whalen. a
versatile wide receiver who is constantly in
motion before the snap, completed a pass to
Luck against Arizona and reeled in two catch
es, one of which came just a couple of feet away
from the end zone, this past weekend.
Harbaugh highlighted Reuland and

The Cardinal's 2008 recruiting class has impressed in 2009, with eye-catching performances
from strong safety Delano Howell, receiver Chris Owusu, quarterback Andrew Luck and others.
Whalen specifically for their contri
butions.

"Those guys really stepped up.
They got an opportunity and made
the most of it," Harbaugh said.

Out of an official class of 18
which doesn't include Whalen, a
walk on, and starting kicker Nate
Whitaker, another transfer in the
same year (and from the same
school) as Reuland, who joined the
team at the beginning of last season

10 are valuable assets to the Car
dinal. And they may not be done:
linebacker Alex Debniak showed
tremendous promise during spring
ball, but has been hampered by in
juries all year and is just now on the
cusp of returning, and punter Daniel
Zychlinksi is in an ongoing battle for
the starting job.
"I'm proud of the way the team
has improved and is improving,"
Harbaugh said after the Arizona
State game, "My thought coming off
the field is that this Cardinal team's
come a long way."
