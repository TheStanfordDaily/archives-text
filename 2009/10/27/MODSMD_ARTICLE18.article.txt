# Sports sullied by star-bias

### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
There is a widely known but com
monly hushed up adage in all
sports: The stars get the calls.
Why, though?
Why do the best athletes, who al
ready get benefits in schooling (just
ask Derrick Rose), benefits in salary
(just ask the Yankees) and benefits in
the courtroom (just ask Donte Stall
worth), get additional benefits in
their own sports?

Believe me, I've heard the reason
ing: "People watch sports to see the
stars play." First of all, I think a whole
lot of people watch sports to see
everyone, not just Leßron and
Tebow. Even so, who watches a game
to see their favorite player get
fouled? I love watching basketball,
but I can't say that watching Shaq
brick free throws has ever been a
highlight for me. And Shaq doesn't
even get the ridiculous calls some
other stars get.

Most of all, though, if I'm watch
ing a star player, I want to see him
earn it. I want to see him stand out
from the rest on a level playing field.
Otherwise, why is he a star? Wow,
cool, Leßron can do a crazy dunk. So
can 50 other players if they're al

lowed eight steps.
Things like this stop me from fol
lowing the NBA. Many of my friends
love it, but the NBA seems like it's
moving toward And 1 Streetball
every day. Players can find new ways
to travel and as long as they are tal
ented enough and give the move a
cool name ("Crab Dribble" sounds a
little better than "Taking two extra
steps"), they'll never be called.
I know college basketball is turn
ing into the NBA's minor leagues, but
I still see a much higher level of bas
ketball in college than in the pros.
Even still, the Tyler Hansbroughs of
the world still find themselves at the
free throw line whenever they deem
fit.

It does make some sense that bas
ketball, which is very individually-fo
cused and relies on referees to an ex
treme degree, has many of the most
blatant examples of favoring stars.
It's more puzzling and disheartening,
when sports like baseball and foot
ball fall victim to the same disease.

Baseball announcers often justify
a poor call on balls and strikes by
saying, "Clemens will get those close
calls" or "Bonds has a good eye, so
the umpires will usually give him the
benefit of the doubt." In what
messed up universe does this make
sense? Why can a good pitcher have
a bigger strike zone than a bad pitch
er? Why is a good batter unable to be
called out on strikes? Just the other
day, Alex Rodriguez drew a bases
loaded walk on a pitch he said on na
tional television was a strike. Re
mind me how that helps the game.
Perhaps the most blatant recent
example of favoritism, though, has

come from college football of all
places. College football is generally a
team game, so it is rarer to see play
ers singled out. Of course, sometimes
the media falls so much for a player
that his entire team is rewarded for
it. Naturally, I couldn't be talking
about anyone other than Jesus rein
carnate himself, Tim Tebow.
Tim Tebow is unquestionably a
great player. Few quarterbacks have
ever put together the kinds of num
bers he has and he might be the best
dual-threat quarterback in college
football history. Therefore, it's pretty
tough to overstate his quality. Unfor
tunately for sports fans outside of
Gainesville though, the sports media
has found away. I'm surprised
Tebow's ESPN picture hasn't come
with a halo yet, because he's pretty
much achieved sainthood status
from many analysts.

This attitude seems to have in
fected SEC referees as well. Even

before the season started, everyone
seemed to have expected and
hoped to see Florida in the title
game, and the refs have done their
best to make that the case. Three fel
low SEC coaches have already com
plained about the officiating in their

games against Florida. Tennessee
Head Coach Lane Kiffin has re
ceived a formal warning from SEC
commissioner Mike Slive for some of
his comments about Florida's unfair
advantage. Arkansas Head Coach
Bobby Petrino was reprimanded for
pointing out the obvious no-calls for
Florida and the absurd personal foul
calls against his team, which cost
them an enormous upset win over
Florida. Clearly, his claims had some
legitimacy because the referees who
called that game were suspended by
the SEC. Yet just last week, Florida
got the benefit of another horren
dous call, as a fumble by Florida line
backer Dustin Doe was not called,
giving Florida a crucial touchdown
as it hung on against Mississippi
State, whose head coach, Dan
Mullen, is still calling for more action
by the league against the officials.
There are starting to be too many
examples for this to just be coinci

dental. Any unbiased fan that tunes
into a Florida game will see how
much help the Gators receive from
the referees.

I'm seriously sick of this. Before
this barrage of favoritism, I was com
pletely neutral toward Florida. Now,
I root against Florida no matter
what, just to see some justice in the
world. When I watch the NBA, I
hope to see traveling called and I get
excited to see a call go against a star,
because both are as rare as a quiet
Terrell Owens or a compassionate
Mike Tyson.
It shouldn't be this way. Let the
players play the game, and the stars
can shine on their own. Otherwise
the referees are becoming the stars,
and I'm not paying to watch Fieldin
Culbreth.

Jacob Jaffe was paid to give a shout
out to Fieldin Culbreth. Ask him how
much at jwjaffe@stanford.edu.

Let players play
the game. The
stars can shine
on their own.
