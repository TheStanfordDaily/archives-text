# H&S will add professors and fellowships, expand language instruction
## Univ. to upgrade Asian area studies 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Despite a lean budget and all the pres
sures that come with it, Humanities and
Sciences (H&S) Dean Richard Sailer showed
that cuts have not hampered Stanford's aca
demic ambitions at a Board of Trustees meet
ing two weeks ago, where he mentioned plans
to upgrade the University's Asian area stud
ies.
Sailer wrote in an e-mail to The Daily that
the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia
are the specific areas he is looking to
improve. The improvements will include
additions to the faculty, more graduate fel
lowships and expanded language instruction.

Stanford already has a program in East
Asian studies. Stanford's faculty includes
experts in the other areas. For example, Prof
Abbas Milani, an Iran specialist, is the sole
member of Stanford's Iranian Studies pro
gram but has neither a curriculum nor
strength in numbers for studying the Middle
East.
"We have scattered faculty studying these
areas, but not substantial, coherent strength,"
Sailer said.
"We aim to add five or six faculty in the
humanities and social sciences in both Islamic
Studies and South Asian Studies," Sailer con
tinued. "In addition, we plan to strengthen
East Asian Studies with some additional
appointments, especially in literature."

According to Sailer, the improvements
would require about $lOO million in addition
al endowment, which he believes will take
about five years to raise depending on the
performance of the economy. H&S is cur
rently restricting its faculty hiring due to
budget shortfalls.
Though planning future growth in aca
demic programs during a period of financial
concern is risky. Sailer did not need to look
any further for motivation than to Leland
and Jane Stanford's mission statement on the
founding of the University.
"Most simply, Stanford cannot educate
'cultured and useful citizens' for the 21st cen
tury without programs of research and teach
ing about the major Asian cultures," Sailer

said.
Other professors in the Asian area studies
programs echoed Sailer's comments. Prof.
Andrew Walder, the director of Stanford's
Division of International Comparative and
Area Studies, said that Asia is too important
to overlook.
"The move to emphasize Asia began at
least five years ago," Walder wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "The simple answer is 'the
rise of China'... and the parallel and some
what more muted, at present, 'rise of India.'
The region has become too big and too influ
ential economically, politically and [to some
extent] culturally to ignore."
Stanford has been ramping up its Asian
programs over the past decade. The

University opened its overseas studies pro
gram in Beijing in 2004 and is the home of the
Forum for American/Chinese Exchange at
Stanford (FACES), a student group formed
in 2001 which fosters interaction and dia
logue between Chinese and American under
graduates.
Prof. Karen Wigen, the director of
Stanford's Center for East Asian Studies, said
that the increased focus and funding will feed
an already existing hunger for expertise on
Asia.
"The planned increase in graduate fellow
ships is an encouraging sign," Wigen said.
"There is going to be a big future
demand for training in these areas."
Wigen noted that Stanford has
a tradition as a "powerhouse" in
East Asian studies. The University's
first endowed professorship, created
in 1920, was the Yamato Ichihashi
Chair in Japanese History and
Civilization, but the focus on other
Asian areas was novel.
"What's new here for Stanford is
South Asia and it's to the dean's
credit that he's driving there," Wigen
said.

Sailer is not the only professor to
harken back to the pillars of
Stanford's history when discussing
the upgrade in Asian subjects. Wigen
believes that a renewed focus on
Asia is in perfect harmony with for
mer Provost Frederick Terman's
model of the University as a set of
"steeples of excellence," a number
of programs that attract the best and
the brightest in their field and
inspire excellence in the rest of the
University.
Wigen said the planned improve
ments are a major step toward mak
ing Stanford that kind of magnet for
Asian studies.
"A school of this size can't do
everything," Wigen said. "But this is
a traditional steeple of excellence
for Stanford."
