# OVERSEAS STUDIES
## Cape Town set for winter launch 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
The days are fast approaching when, in
January 2010, 24 undergrads will embark
to Cape Town, South Africa as the first
class of Stanford's new Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP). The Cape Town
program, unveiled in April of last year,
brings BOSP's overseas program count to
11 and is Stanford's first permanent over
seas outpost in Africa.
"We are very excited about the open
ing," said BOSP Director Norman
Naimark. "The program has been a long
time coming. Much thought and effort has
gone into preparing the ground for it.
Faculty in that program have been think
ing about an Africa program for decades."
Naimark explained that the Cape
Town program received a $1 million grant
from the President's Fund to get it off the
ground, but once the initial funding fades
out, BOSP must carry the cost itself. Most
BOSP programs cost a little over $1 mil
lion per year to run for a three-quarter

system.
Interest in South Africa has peaked
throughout the years, explained Cape
Town Program Director Timothy Stanton,
and there had been a push from both stu
dents and faculty since the late '9os to ini
tiate a program in the South African
region.
At the southeastern tip of South Africa,
Cape Town is South Africa's "Mother
City." A bustling cultural center of 3.5 mil
lion inhabitants, it was the site of the first
European settlement in South Africa and
houses the country's national parliament.
Stanford students will live in two adja
cent houses in the Observatory neighbor
hood, an urban college town, known affec
tionately as "Obs." Obs is close to the
Health Sciences campus of the University
of Cape Town (UCT) and within shuttle
distance to the main campus. Observatory
was also what Stanton called a "gray
neighborhood" during apartheid and not
subject to color regulation.
These racial tensions were part of what
drew Eva Orbuch 'll, an urban studies

major, to apply to Cape Town
in the winter.
"I really -
hope to get a
more solid idea
of what I'm inter
ested in through
the program,"
Orbuch said. "Three \
months isn't much
time to spend there, .
but I hope to come
away with some under
standing of the com
plexities of the country
and the culture,"

Enumale Agada 'lO, an anthropology
major, went to Cape Town with the 2008
pilot program and called the experience
"life-changing."
"South Africa is a sort of microcosm,"
Agada said. "The juxtaposition there is
amazing. There are shopping malls and
designer clothing stores and then right
next door there is a township."
Stanton agreed. He first ventured to

Cape Town in 1996, after
supporting the anti-apartheid campaigns
at Stanford in the 'Bos. At that time, he was
invited to give a speech at a conference at
UCT and that visit cemented his fascina
tion with the country.
"The country was still in the spirit of
apartheid and about to embark on becom
ing a new nation," Stanton said. "It was
one of the most spirited and intellectually -
stimulating times of my life."
