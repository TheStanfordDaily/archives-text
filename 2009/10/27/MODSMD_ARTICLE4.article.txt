## Budget concerns push back renovations Plans to refurbish Bob delayed until at least 2010

Student Housing is delaying renova
tions to three row houses in response to
budget reductions.
While renovations projects on Bob
were planned for this summer, the
University has delayed such developments
until 2010, according to Rodger Whitney,
executive director of Student Housing.
Remodeling on Casa Italiana and Storey,
which were next in line for renovations
after Bob, has also been subsequently
delayed.
"There have been cutbacks...
University-wide and some projects are
being delayed a year or more depending
on the University's financial assessment,"
wrote Whitney in an e-mail to The Daily.
"There are only three Row houses [Bob,
Casa Italiana and Storey] which have not
yet been renovated."
Whitney explained that the houses
been chosen for renovation based on the
Capital Improvement Program (CIP), a
project developed 19 years ago to address
deferred maintenance needs as well as
appropriate upgrades. Decisions to
upgrade student housing are based on Life

Safety Code compliance, accessibility,
deferred maintenance and other opera
tional needs.
While ongoing renovations will not be
halted, new projects will be postponed
until the Student Housing can adjust to
new funding realities. Currently, Bob, built
in the 19705, is most in need of repairs.
Residents, however, while recognizing
the need for improvement, have accepted
the delay on renovations.

"There are only three row
houses [Bob, Casa Italiana
and Storey] whch have not
yet been renovated."

Bob, which had originally been scheduled for complete renovation this summer, will
have to wait until at least next year for such improvements. Budget constraints have
forced Student Housing to delay any new renovations projects for at least a year.
