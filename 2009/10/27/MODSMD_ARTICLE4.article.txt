## Budget concerns push back renovations Plans to refurbish Bob delayed until at least 2010 
### BRIANNA PANG 
Student Housing is delaying renova
tions to three row houses in response to
budget reductions.
While renovations projects on Bob
were planned for this summer, the
University has delayed such developments
until 2010, according to Rodger Whitney,
executive director of Student Housing.
Remodeling on Casa Italiana and Storey,
which were next in line for renovations
after Bob, has also been subsequently
delayed.
"There have been cutbacks...
University-wide and some projects are
being delayed a year or more depending
on the University's financial assessment,"
wrote Whitney in an e-mail to The Daily.
"There are only three Row houses [Bob,
Casa Italiana and Storey] which have not
yet been renovated."
Whitney explained that the houses
been chosen for renovation based on the
Capital Improvement Program (CIP), a
project developed 19 years ago to address
deferred maintenance needs as well as
appropriate upgrades. Decisions to
upgrade student housing are based on Life

Safety Code compliance, accessibility,
deferred maintenance and other opera
tional needs.
While ongoing renovations will not be
halted, new projects will be postponed
until the Student Housing can adjust to
new funding realities. Currently, Bob, built
in the 19705, is most in need of repairs.
Residents, however, while recognizing
the need for improvement, have accepted
the delay on renovations.

"There are only three row
houses [Bob, Casa Italiana
and Storey] whch have not
yet been renovated."

Bob, which had originally been scheduled for complete renovation this summer, will
have to wait until at least next year for such improvements. Budget constraints have
forced Student Housing to delay any new renovations projects for at least a year.
"Bob is an old house," said
Christina Zhu 'll, kitchen manager.
"It definitely is due for renovation,
but it's not like we can't live in it."
Zhu provided one prominent
example of the house toilets, which
have posters on stall doors remind
ing residents to check that they are
completely flushed.
After renovation on Bob has
been completed, Casa Italiana and
Storey will follow. According to the
Student Housing website, all three
houses will be improved with, among
other things, seismic upgrades,
greater handicap accessibility, new
kitchens and new landscaping. For
Bob, there is also the relief that hous
ing will refurbish the house's bath
rooms.

Students in other houses, howev
er, are not too concerned about the
delay.

"I can't complain," said Anton
Scherba 'lO, who lives in Casa
Italiana. "There are just minor things
here and there carpets are a little
worn and there are chips in the wall."
Though these housing projects
have been postponed, Student
Housing is working to finish up
ongoing renovations. As students
were enjoying the last few days of
their summer vacation, contractors
were renovating Wilbur, Stern, and
Lagunita.
Wilbur and Stern are currently in
the process of receiving makeovers.
These houses are receiving electrical
improvements, new fire sprinklers,
upgraded fire alarms, remodeled
restrooms, new carpet in the student
rooms and fresh paint throughout.
"Student Housing tries really
hard to stay on top of dorm renova
tions; they respond to general dorm
improvement needs reasonably
quickly," said Patti Hanlon-Baker,
Larkin's Resident Fellow.

One problem for students living in Bob is the temperamental toilets, which
need to be checked by residents so that they flush completely. Bathroom
refurbishment was among the many plans for the renovations last summer.
