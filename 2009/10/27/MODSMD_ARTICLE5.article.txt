Returning to her alma matter, Under Secretary
of Energy Kristina Johnson spoke to a packed
Tresidder Oak Room last night on the possibilities
for alternative energy in the United States.
Johnson, who holds a B.S 'Bl, M.S. 'Bl and a
Ph.D. 'B4, all in electrical engineering, was appoint
ed Under Secretary for the Department of Energy
(DOE) after being nominated by President Barack
Obama last April. Before taking this post she spent
eight years as the Dean of the Pratt School of
Engineering at Duke University and prior to that
was the Provost and Senior Vice President for
Academic Affairs at Johns Hopkins University.
Opening her speech, Johnson stressed that
employing clean energy methods would not be a
quick fix to the current dependence on nonrenew
able energy.
"There is, as I'm sure you've heard it said ...
no silver bullet," Johnson said.
Johnson proceeded by outlining the priorities
for expanding the use of clean energy by 2030 and
cited decreases in greenhouse gas emissions,
attaining "energy security" and creating green jobs
as the most important goals.
"The first priority is to build a coherent energy
portfolio strategy," Johnson explained. "About
two-thirds of our 21 million barrels [of oil] a day
are imported, some from countries that aren't too
careful in the way they challenge [the United
States]."
Johnson listed the DOE's goals to cut back on
greenhouse gas emissions, which include reducing
the use of fossil fuel-generated electricity to less
than 25 percent of total energy generated as well as
raising electricity from renewable sources to more
than 25 percent. To achieve these goals, the govern
ment has invested money in the energy portion of
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,
which plans to double solar and wind energy in the
United States.
However, Johnson did not expect to have this
funding every year for alternative energy invest
ment.
"We don't expect to have that kind of stimulus
every year," Johnson said. "So the question is, what
can we learn from our investments ... that can
inspire folks to continue to double solar and wind
[energy]?"
In addition to describing the significance of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Johnson
stressed the importance of an educated workforce
in creating alternative energy methods.
"We have a huge workforce problem," Johnson
said. "We don't have a population that's becoming
educated ... in how to deploy this new industrial
revolution."
Johnson specified that 60 percent of the energy
workforce is expected to retire in five years.
Additionally, the United States has the lowest
