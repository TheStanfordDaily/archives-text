## TOWERING INSTITUTION 
### ERIKA ALVERO KOSKI 
These words that grace the archway lead
ing to the Hoover Tower elevator repre
sent all that the Hoover Institution aims
to encompass in its political endeavors
aboard the Stanford campus.
To this day, the Tower still attracts many illustri
ous politicians and thinkers, drawn in by the sec
ond-largest collection of Cold War documents in
the world. Or it could be the sheer mountain of
books, with 1.6 million volumes filling the shelves.
Or it could be the hordes of scholars and politicians
that come for the exact same reasons.
The Tower
Gliding up by elevator, tourists and students
travel 285 feet to the observation platform, where
they can see light dancing on the dazzling blue
fountain in front of Memorial Auditorium, the
stripes streaking the football field and miniature
ant-like people scurrying along busily below. On a
clear day, they can even see all the way to San
Francisco.
Stories one through nine of Hoover Tower are
devoted to library stacks only available to librarians
and only accessible by stairs. The next three stories
then house the offices and workspace of fellows, but
the elevator has no thirteenth floor button, much to
the appeal of superstitious guests.
"A lot of people think that the fact that there is
no elevator access to the thirteenth floor is because
it is 'unlucky,'" said Lyn Mehe'ula 'll, a tour guide
who operates the Hoover Tower elevator three
times a week. "But it's actually the floor of the car
illon bells' mechanical drum and people can't really
walk around that."
The original 38 carillon bells were brought over
from Belgium and installed in 1941, a turbulent
time for a Europe occupied by Nazi Germany. They
have stood solid and strong over the years, although
they were cracked in the 1989 earthquake and now
can only be played manually. Upon repair, they
were expanded to include ten more bells.
Professor Zerlang is currently the only carillon
neur at Stanford, so they now are played less regu
larly, reserved for special occasions such as

The purpose of this institution
is to promote peace. Its records
stand as a challenge to those who
promote war. They should attract
those who search for peace.

I therefore dedicate this building
to these purposes.

The 285-foot building attracts tourists and scholars alike. It holds 1.6 million volumes and houses the second-largest collection of Cold War documents.
Commencement. The bells must
wait for the numerous visitors to
empty out of the 14th floor observa
tion deck because of the high noise
level.
As an immensely tall structure,
Hoover Tower has no trouble draw
ing the eyes of students. It has beck
oned climbers and adventurers, dar
ing them to traverse the 285 feet.
"A group of students attached a
rope during the day to a ledge on the
observation platform," Mehe'ula
said. "Then at night they attempted
to climb the Tower, but they never
made it."

The Institution
More than merely a tall building,
the Hoover Institution for War,
Revolution and Peace is a complete
ly separate entity in itself. Herbert
Hoover, a member of the "pioneer
class" of Stanford, founded the
Institution in 1919 to study past wars
and their implications for the future,

hoping to rebuke any further blood
shed.

Hoover had previously founded
the Commission Relief of Belgium
(CRB), which distributed basic life
essentials throughout Belgium dur
ing World War I, earning Hoover a
reputation as a humanitarian.
Hoover then donated $50,000 to
Stanford to develop a collection of
artifacts relating to war for the pur
pose of promoting world peace.
"World War I obviously wasn't
the war to end all wars," said
Nicholas Siekirski, who has worked
in the Exhibits and Outreach section
of the Hoover Institution for eight
years. "Hoover believed it was
important to study history in order
to change the future."
The Hoover Institution remains a
political "think tank" that is inde
pendent of Stanford University, rely
ing on its own endowment and
donors for monetary support. While
typically acknowledged as having a
conservative bias in favor of the free
market and free enterprise, there
nevertheless are Democrats
researching and writing there. The
library itself is also bipartisan.
Hoover's collection centers main

ly on Communist documents, but
also encompasses artifacts on all
forms of war and oppression, such as
the diary of Chiang Kai-shek and a
large piece of the Berlin Wall. The
archives containing over 6,000 items
actually lie underground rather than
in Hoover Tower, underneath the
Herbert Hoover Museum, the Lou
Hoover Museum and the actual
tower.
The institution also hosts
"Fellows," scholars who research,
write and give talks around Hoover
Tower. Prominent politicians such as
Condoleezza Rice, Milton Friedman
and George Schultz have all been
senior fellows here.
Controversy has circled Hoover
Tower for the last few years, with a
few clashes between college stu
dents and some conservative visi
tors. Upon Bush's prospective visit
with Schultz in 2006, students
protested so fervently that the meet
ing moved to Schultz's house,
Donald Rumsfeld's appointment in
2007 as a visiting fellow also drew
protests.
