## TOWERING INSTITUTION 
### ERIKA ALVERO KOSKI 
These words that grace the archway lead
ing to the Hoover Tower elevator repre
sent all that the Hoover Institution aims
to encompass in its political endeavors
aboard the Stanford campus.
To this day, the Tower still attracts many illustri
ous politicians and thinkers, drawn in by the sec
ond-largest collection of Cold War documents in
the world. Or it could be the sheer mountain of
books, with 1.6 million volumes filling the shelves.
Or it could be the hordes of scholars and politicians
that come for the exact same reasons.
The Tower
Gliding up by elevator, tourists and students
travel 285 feet to the observation platform, where
they can see light dancing on the dazzling blue
fountain in front of Memorial Auditorium, the
stripes streaking the football field and miniature
ant-like people scurrying along busily below. On a
clear day, they can even see all the way to San
Francisco.
Stories one through nine of Hoover Tower are
devoted to library stacks only available to librarians
and only accessible by stairs. The next three stories
then house the offices and workspace of fellows, but
the elevator has no thirteenth floor button, much to
the appeal of superstitious guests.
"A lot of people think that the fact that there is
no elevator access to the thirteenth floor is because
it is 'unlucky,'" said Lyn Mehe'ula 'll, a tour guide
who operates the Hoover Tower elevator three
times a week. "But it's actually the floor of the car
illon bells' mechanical drum and people can't really
walk around that."
The original 38 carillon bells were brought over
from Belgium and installed in 1941, a turbulent
time for a Europe occupied by Nazi Germany. They
have stood solid and strong over the years, although
they were cracked in the 1989 earthquake and now
can only be played manually. Upon repair, they
were expanded to include ten more bells.
Professor Zerlang is currently the only carillon
neur at Stanford, so they now are played less regu
larly, reserved for special occasions such as

The purpose of this institution
is to promote peace. Its records
stand as a challenge to those who
promote war. They should attract
those who search for peace.

I therefore dedicate this building
to these purposes.
