# I HUM THROUGH IHUM

### CATHERINE LOWELL 
y*y y*y y*y a.m. A herd of freshmen dragged
M \ M\M % themselves to their first class,
I whipped by wind and pelted by
■ ■ 1 ■■ m hard rain. They sported backwards
9 V_X V umbrellas and raincoats that flew
behind them like capes. Judging by their soaked clothing, deep coughs
and angry expressions, no one really wanted to be there.
It was IHUM (Introduction to the Humanities) lecture.
'Die Walkure' might as well have been playing in the background.
The dim lights in the auditorium were flickering. Tlie room had no win
dows. It smelled like wet dog. The coughs, sniffs, sneezes and groans
were so frequent that it might have been a sick room from the Civil War.
But when lecture started, the fabled spitballs did not fly. In fact, the
class was painfully normal. The professor was funny, students laughed.
He asked an intelligent question, someone offered an intelligent
answer. There were a few students who were hovering over a muted
You Tube video of Swedish rappers, but for the most part, people were
paying attention.
This was it?
