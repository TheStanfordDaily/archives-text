# I HUM THROUGH IHUM

y*y y*y y*y a.m. A herd of freshmen dragged
M \ M\M % themselves to their first class,
I whipped by wind and pelted by
■ ■ 1 ■■ m hard rain. They sported backwards
9 V_X V umbrellas and raincoats that flew
behind them like capes. Judging by their soaked clothing, deep coughs
and angry expressions, no one really wanted to be there.
It was IHUM (Introduction to the Humanities) lecture.
'Die Walkure' might as well have been playing in the background.
The dim lights in the auditorium were flickering. Tlie room had no win
dows. It smelled like wet dog. The coughs, sniffs, sneezes and groans
were so frequent that it might have been a sick room from the Civil War.
But when lecture started, the fabled spitballs did not fly. In fact, the
class was painfully normal. The professor was funny, students laughed.
He asked an intelligent question, someone offered an intelligent
answer. There were a few students who were hovering over a muted
You Tube video of Swedish rappers, but for the most part, people were
paying attention.
This was it?
Either it was a particularly good
IHUM, or IHUM wasn't as bad as
everyone said it was.
Nightmarish tales often surround
IHUM, justified or not. To some, it is
a program designed to ease freshmen
into the world of college, while to oth
ers, it is a program designed to subject
unsuspecting freshman to intellectual
lynching.
To be sure, there are legitimate
complaints about the institution. For
one thing, many techies wonder why
they must take a year of humanities
in addition to GERs, while fuzzies
must only fulfill a few quarter-long
requirements for math and science.
Hanni Hanson 'l3 noted that
IHUM takes up too many units and
too much time,
"We're not learning much of con
tent," Hanson said. "Sections are
helpful in clarifying concepts, but not
much analysis and interpreting hap
pens."
Linden Melvin 'll commented
upon some of the institutions' weak
nesses.
"My lecture consisted of a couple
of Power Points and a professor who
read his dissertation," Melvin said.
"You get to be very good at saying
what people want to hear, especially
in section, when you have to partici
pate. Your voice isn't in it anymore."
However, for some students, the
memory of IHUM is worse than the
class itself. It may be that it is simply
not cool to like IHUM. Complaining
and ranting about it seems to be the
fad.
"Freshmen bond over not liking
IHUM," Melvin said. "It was the
topic of many a dinner discussion.
You were so upset and frustrated that
you'd get with a friend and you'd
laugh about it."
That said, Melvin noted, "What
IHUM aims for is incredibly valu
able. It is a ritualistic coming of age
experience."
At the end of the lecture, the pro
fessor made a reference to an obscure
Greek. The TF nearby grinned know
ingly. He had taken IHUM once, too.
