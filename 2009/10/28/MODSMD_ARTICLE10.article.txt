## GET IT RIGHT Poetry time â€“ Ode To Obama: 
### Erica Morgan 
Obama we adore you. Your being is
supreme.
We know you stand for change, but what pre
cisely does that mean?
You have a massive fan base flaunting T
shirts of your face,
And schools of intellectuals are focused on
your race.
"What progress" loudly preach your proud
promoters with delight.
"His policy is lacking, but at least he isn't
white."
And really this is perfect, for now we clearly
see:
Opponents of your politics are racist SOBs.
But this can't be the change we need, for it is
no new news,
The liberals have always pulled the race card
when they choose.
Where then is the CHANGE that we de
manded desperately?
Perhaps in taking over private U.S. industry?
When companies are failing in an economic
plight,
You bravely intercede and increase debt to
set it right!
And I am very glad to have my hard earned
dollars seized.
To make you CEO of any company you
please,
I fully recognize that our economy was
grown,
By independent strivers seeking profit of
their own.
But it's unfair to let the U.S. market run so
free.
Thus I confess, I think it's best to let you in
tervene.
But history has often seen this trend, though
it is wrong:
The liberal inserts himself where he does not
belong.
If this is not the promised change I guess we 'll
give a thought
To improving care and comfort of the terror
ists we've caught.

The towers burned, bin Laden cheered, our
nation tried to mend.
That there could live such hateful scum was
hard to comprehend.
But hate is base! And thus we've tried to
tame our vengeful flame.
And in this breach we now can preach for
giveness and self-blame.
These villains who would kill us all deserve
human respect.
They blow up schools and villages ... but
their rights we'll protect!
Obama must close Git-mo to prevent its
gross misuse!
Investigate the CIA for terrorist abuse.
I'm not sure that this is change, although it
seems obscene,
We've seen a lot of fools protecting scum
bags, thieves and fiends.
I'll take a final stab at seeking some dramat
ic "change,"
To justify the "Yes we cans!" and other cam
paign mange.
This healthcare bill will surely be the greatest
progress yet!
We'll force a standard coverage on the popu
lation set.
The route of cost effectiveness will be a solid
plan.
We'll cover the abortions while neglecting
gramps and gran.
And everyone can pay a share, though few
will really gain.
But we'll pretend to somehow mend the suf
fering and pain.
Though I declare this crime we share was
never framed so well,
We've often witnessed thievery by socialist
cartel.
And while he double dips his hand into your
dwindling purse,
Obama's only changing things by making
them much worse.

If you wish to villainize, validate or versify,
please make sure to do so in correct rhythm and
rhyme, and send it to emorganl@stanford.edu.
