To the editor:

I applaud Danny Crichton's conclusion
that it is alright to relax from time to time, but
his article still seems to imply that there is
something structurally wrong with Stanford
that keeps students from doing what they re
ally want to do. I disagree.
A key NSO maxim taking a place right
below the exalted duck metaphor in the hier
archy of undergraduate wisdom â€”is that
Stanford is what you make of it: there are
many opportunities out there, but you must
actively pursue them. That advice does not
just apply to academics 1 believe that true
free time must be pursued, and doing so can
be very rewarding.

I came to Stanford because I wanted to
learn and meet like-minded people, but
somewhere along the way, among the rush of
freshman year and the breakneck intensity of
my then physics major, I lost track of those
values. For a while, I was highly critical of
Stanford's culture, believing that it was too
focused on work and productivity and not
enough on the pursuit of knowledge. I joked,
with a tinge of bitterness, that they should re
place "The Thinker" with "The Doer."
It has taken me three years of college and

a leave of absence to realize that I can have
control over my life at Stanford. I value
knowledge and creativity more than almost
everything else, and if I do not have time to
spend time with my thoughts and create
things, 1 feel as though 1 do not have a reason
to exist. So, now, I allow myself some time
every day to read, play guitar and do whatev
er else 1 want to. A few weeks ago, 1 went and
saw the Great Lake Swimmers in San Fran
cisco with a good friend on a school night,
which gave me a taste of the sense of inspira
tion and enrichment I really want out of col
lege. My grades might not turn out to be as
good as they could have been, but they are
only grades.
I am not trying to claim that 1 have every
thing figured out, or imply that people should
follow my example. I believe, though, that life
is vastly open-ended, yet we only tend to see
a few narrow paths that comfort us with their
familiarity. Stanford, like life as a whole, can
be anything one wants it to be. So, my re
sponse to Danny's article is yes, Stanford stu
dents can find plenty of time to do what they
want to do. ft is just a matter of choice.
