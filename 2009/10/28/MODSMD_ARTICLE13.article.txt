## Harry Potter and the Unexpected Thrust 
### Melanie Horn Brian Wanyoike 
"It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those
who are best suited to power are those who
have never sought it. Those who, like you, have
leadership thrust upon them, and take up the
mantle because they must, and find to their
own surprise that they wear it well."
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,
p. 718

We're convinced that it can't possibly
be that difficult to rule the world.
Given careful planning, intense mo
tivation and a pinch of good luck (or a swig of
Felix Felicis), any Stanford student could
probably make it happen. Our favorite resi
dent dark wizard Lord Voldemort certainly
thinks he has what it takes, as throughout the
books he most definitely has the wizarding
world under his spell. Flowever, oddly
enough, we walk away from the series re
membering a bespectacled, knobbly-kneed
Flarry as the better leader.
It's not as if Harry is particularly intelli
gent or possesses the charisma often associ
ated with a leader. If anything, he's down
right awkward and can't even do his home
work without Hermione's help half the time.
Yet, on his quest to defeat Lord Voldemort
he finds himself leading the fray and gather
ing an immense amount of support as he
fights giant serpents and battles imprints of
departed souls. His unexpected and unin
tended rise to the position of an exalted fig
urehead reminds each of us, as Dumbledore
so astutely points out, that the best leaders
are those who naturally rise up because they
are passionate about a cause and are deter
mined to pursue it relentlessly.
From researchers on the brink of discov
ery in medicine and technology to students
standing at the helm of countless organiza
tions on and off campus, there is simply no
denying that Stanford is a place where lead
ers dwell. After all, most of us are here, in
part, because we held perfect-Percy-prefect
positions within our high schools or local
communities. The thirst for these roles and
more lines on our resumes only increase dur-

ing our time here, as we are constantly re
minded in Howler-fashion that we are being
trained to become world leaders. We begin to
forget why we seek these positions in the first
place and what they are supposed to say
about us.

After filling out the ten thousandth in
ternship application that asks, "What posi
tions of leadership do you hold?" we become
convinced that it is the titles we possess that
are meaningful, and not why or how we ob
tained them. Oftentimes, rather than our pas
sions naturally calling us to places of author
ity where we find ourselves pushing bound
aries and rallying others to our cause, we first
land ourselves positions and must work
backward to figure out what we actually want

to do with them. We so easily fall into the trap
of seeking out activities primarily for title
and rank; thus, leadership becomes an unnat
ural and forced act that doesn't feel right no
matter how much we try to justify our ac
tions.
Interestingly enough, Harry's own path to
leadership starts in the shadows under the
stairs before it cascades full-force into a vic
torious showdown with Voldemort. Harry
certainly never seeks prestige or power he
simply wants to track down his parents' mur
derer so as to give him a friendly little jab
with his wand. His unconventional path to
leadership demonstrates that the "mantles"
that we take up, and how we do so, differs for
each person. Whether we find ourselves im
mersed in education and healthcare reform,
the political scene, or technological innova
tion, all that seems to matter is that our man
tles come from a place of true dedication and
concern, such that we cannot help but get in
volved.
It is particularly worth noting that the wiz
arding world greatly admires Harry because
he takes action and ownership out of a sense
of greater purpose. It is ultimately his devo
tion to his objectives that is compelling and
contagious. Perhaps, then, it might be useful
for us to redefine our view of a leader not as
one with followers, but one who inspires oth
ers to join a pressing and worthwhile cause.
As we chase after callings from which we
cannot hide or stay away, we may also then
find that, like Harry, we wear our leadership
well.
Then again, if all this seems like too much,
we suppose you can always just stick with
Voldemort's leadership plan. Oh, except for
the part where he ends up firing a killing
curse that accidentally results in his own
death. Our bad.

All that seems to matter
is that our mantles
come from a place of
true dedication and
concern.
