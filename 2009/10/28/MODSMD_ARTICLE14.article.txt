## ENTER THE BAND 
### ZOE LEAVITT 
I'm sure you've heard, seen, rocked out to
and possibly been flashed by the
LSJUMB, the marching band that never
walks when it can scatter.
People say that they almost tipped over a
plane once by getting up in mid-flight and run
ning back and forth down the aisle; that they
made fun of the Irish potato famine in 1997 at
Notre Dame; that they almost got banned from
the state of Oregon for making fun of the en
dangered spotted owl at Oregon in 1990; that in
2004 they mocked polygamy at Brigham Young
University.
These stories get passed around in vague
terms, like any quality urban legends, while
many people don't realize that the factual bases
took place sometimes over twenty years ago.
Could the one, the only, the truly incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band be getting tame?
In 2006, the University cracked down heavi
ly on the band after a summer vandalizing of the
Band Shak cost the University up to $50,000.
The destruction, which the band reports
stemmed from a misunderstanding that the
Shak would be torn down in the fall, along with
the discovery of large quantities of alcohol, led
to fines, strict alcohol policies and the installa
tion of an interim band director. Since that year,
the band has incurred no large disciplinary ac
tion, no banning from states or stadiums and no
controversial national media coverage.
These efforts brought the band closer within
the fold of the University and attempted to fos

ter understanding between students and admin
istration.

"[The band] is one of Stanford's great, iconic
traditions," said Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman. "Since 2006 ... there
have been efforts to create a stronger partner
ship between the Band and the University. Gen
erally speaking, these efforts have been success
ful... zany and irreverent humor remains a
trademark of the group's music and their per
formances."
While Stanford's administration seems more
cooperative than most, Stanford's band must
hang on to its independence and enthusiasm re
gardless of boundaries. But if the band hopes to
avoid losing its touch, the problem may not be
over-intrusive faculty, but an increasingly cau
tious and forward-thinking student body.
"Compared to ten or fifteen years ago, kids
come to Stanford today more academically mo
tivated, they come as just another step in their
career path versus for the experience [of col
lege] , while joining the band is very much about
the experience," said Peter McDonald 'll,
LSJUMB head of public relations.
The band may seem to be a vestigial institu
tion hanging on from the riotous sixties and sev
enties, a celebration of chaos that has no place
in today's world. In a world where everything is
Youtubed and Google-able, video clips of you
conducting the band with a crucifix online
might come back to haunt you in future job in
terviews.
