# Redskins spiraling out of control
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Larry Johnson's Twitter problems aside, the
most compelling drama of the 2009 NFL
season has been the ongoing soap opera
that is the Washington Redskins.
Let's recap.
After a fourth place finish last year in arguably
the toughest division in football, the Skins looked
to make the jump back into the playoffs. They
once again earned the title of Champions of the
Offseason, as they dropped $lOO million to sign
defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth, the jewel
of the free agent class.
As an indicator of how quickly Washington's
season has gone downhill, let's note that it is not
even the midway point of 2009 and Haynesworth
has already developed a reputation for being out
of shape his "breaks" on long drives have be
come commonplace and outspoken. They
guaranteed this man $4l million. This is not even
remotely close to their biggest problem. But I di
gress.
2009 marked the second season of coach Jim
Zorn's tenure. Zorn is a career position coach
who was hired as the offensive coordinator during
the 2008 offseason, but was promptly promoted to
head coach after only two weeks on the job.
"Why?" is anyone's guess, but the educated one
says that owner Daniel Snyder was rejected by
higher profile coaches, such as Jim Mora and

Steve Spagnuolo and needed a quick fix to avoid
embarrassment. Enter Zorn.
Of course, the question begs to be asked: why
would someone turn down the Redskins job? It is,
after all, one of the most notable coaching gigs in
the game and the franchise's history extends back
to the 19305. Look no further than the big boss
man himself, derisively nicknamed "Danny Boy."
Snyder became very rich, very quickly and de
cided to buy the Redskins in 1999. While his
shrewdness as a businessman has rarely come into
question Washington routinely ranks at or
near the top of the NFL's most profitable fran
chises his skills as a talent evaluator leave a lot
to be desired. Actually, scratch that since he
has absolutely no deftness in that area, they leave
everything to be desired. And, like many men of
considerable power and even greater ego, he feels
that he can run the team not just as an owner, but
also as a manager.
That presents a very real problem for the foot
ball side of the Redskins, since the coaches are
forced to work with people that the owner deems
desirable.This is not a tactic of successful franchis
es, which leave that aspect to professionals.
Cincinnati, Oakland, Washington they are all
teams that have struggled mightily in recent years

and all are teams whose owners es
sentially act as general managers.
Technically, Snyder has a GM
Vinny Cerrato, the very definition of
a puppet. That means that when
Danny Boy has a little crush on a
player, he gets him, even though those
little affairs rarely work out for the
better.

But where were we? Oh yes, back
to Zorn.

Two things were clear from the be
ginning of his tenure. First, that he
wasn't Snyder's top choice. Second,
that he was in over his head. But who
can blame him? Snyder offered him
$l5 million over five years to take the
job —it would take him triple the
time to make as much as a position
coach.

Problems began when Zorn intro
duced the West Coast Offense
(WCO), which goes directly against
the strengths of the Skins' young
starting quarterback, Jason Camp
bell, who has a big arm and likes to air
it out. The WCO calls for shorter pat
terns and more restraint. Campbell
has subsequently failed to progress
over the past year and change in
fact, he's regressed. Couple an unsta
ble quarterback one made even
more unhappy because of offseason
trade rumors with a decimated of
fensive line and two aging running

backs and you have the recipe for suc
cess!
The Redskins went south quickly
in 2009. They gave Detroit their first
win since 2007 and the only teams
they have beaten are the currently
winless: the St. Louis Rams and the
Tampa Bay Bucs. Fans grew anxious
and linebacker Robert Flenson took
to what else? Twitter to call
them out for being "half hearted."
By the beginning of October, Sny
der decided to hire Sherm Lewis, who
was wait for it playing bingo
when he took Danny Boy's call, to
serve as an "offensive consultant."
That essentially ended Zorn's tenure
with the team, but he wouldn't quit
why would he and lose out on mil
lions? and Snyder didn't want to
lose face by firing him. Before Mon
day's game against Philadelphia, Sny
der ordered Zorn to relinquish play
calling duties to Lewis. Let's quickly
remember how bad it usually turns
out when the owner pokes his head
into these decisions. The result? A de
bilitating display of offensive inepti
tude en route to a 27-17 loss that was
never even remotely as close as the
score. Zorn, against management's
orders, took back the play-calling du
ties during the game.
The criticism has begun to pour
down on Snyder and Cerrato. Former
Redskins players like John Riggins,
Brian Mitchell and Sam Huff have
taken to the airwaves to rail on the
leadership, pointing to their pathetic
talent evaluation skills indeed,
Washington's current makeup leaves

them nothing short of screwed for the
foreseeable future. Fans have begun
calling for Snyder to sell the team and
for Cerrato to be fired sites have
sprung up asking for donations to buy
bus billboards in the D.C. area. Zorn,
though not liked, is spared a lot of
venom, as fans seem to sympathize
with his impossible situation.
Snyder's response has been an
open dialogue to come to an equi
table solution. Just kidding, ffe has
spent years silencing media opposi
tion by buying up radio stations in
D.C. and even giving Cerrato his own
show, but now he has turned his atten
tion to fans, tn the aftermath of the
loss to the Eagles, stories have seeped
out about fans being asked to leave
for chanting anti-Snyder phrases.
Billboards were torn up that derided
the team in any way. And just yester
day, Snyder banned all posters from
FedEx Field, ostensibly out of "safety
concerns."

Dan Steinberg of the D.C. Sports
Blog has been tracking the madness.
Fie relays a short exchange between a
security guard and a fan regarding a
Dumb and Dumber sign.

"That would be kind of offensive."
"It's offensive to come to these
games."
After years of accepting years of
ineptitude as part of some master
plan, the mutiny is on in Redskins
land.

with the team, but he wouldn't quit
why would he and lose out on mil
lions? and Snyder didn't want to
lose face by firing him. Before Mon
day's game against Philadelphia, Sny
der ordered Zorn to relinquish play
calling duties to Lewis. Let's quickly
remember how bad it usually turns
out when the owner pokes his head
into these decisions. The result? A de
bilitating display of offensive inepti
tude en route to a 27-17 loss that was
never even remotely as close as the
score. Zorn, against management's
orders, took back the play-calling du
ties during the game.
The criticism has begun to pour
down on Snyder and Cerrato. Former
Redskins players like John Riggins,
Brian Mitchell and Sam Huff have
taken to the airwaves to rail on the
leadership, pointing to their pathetic
talent evaluation skills indeed,
Washington's current makeup leaves

them nothing short of screwed for the
foreseeable future. Fans have begun
calling for Snyder to sell the team and
for Cerrato to be fired sites have
sprung up asking for donations to buy
bus billboards in the D.C. area. Zorn,
though not liked, is spared a lot of
venom, as fans seem to sympathize
with his impossible situation.
Snyder's response has been an
open dialogue to come to an equi
table solution. Just kidding, ffe has
spent years silencing media opposi
tion by buying up radio stations in
D.C. and even giving Cerrato his own
show, but now he has turned his atten
tion to fans, tn the aftermath of the
loss to the Eagles, stories have seeped
out about fans being asked to leave
for chanting anti-Snyder phrases.
Billboards were torn up that derided
the team in any way. And just yester
day, Snyder banned all posters from
FedEx Field, ostensibly out of "safety
concerns."

Larry Johnson's Twitter problems aside, the
most compelling drama of the 2009 NFL
season has been the ongoing soap opera
that is the Washington Redskins.
Let's recap.
After a fourth place finish last year in arguably
the toughest division in football, the Skins looked
to make the jump back into the playoffs. They
once again earned the title of Champions of the
Offseason, as they dropped $lOO million to sign
defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth, the jewel
of the free agent class.
As an indicator of how quickly Washington's
season has gone downhill, let's note that it is not
even the midway point of 2009 and Haynesworth
has already developed a reputation for being out
of shape his "breaks" on long drives have be
come commonplace and outspoken. They
guaranteed this man $4l million. This is not even
remotely close to their biggest problem. But I di
gress.
2009 marked the second season of coach Jim
Zorn's tenure. Zorn is a career position coach
who was hired as the offensive coordinator during
the 2008 offseason, but was promptly promoted to
head coach after only two weeks on the job.
"Why?" is anyone's guess, but the educated one
says that owner Daniel Snyder was rejected by
higher profile coaches, such as Jim Mora and

Steve Spagnuolo and needed a quick fix to avoid
embarrassment. Enter Zorn.
Of course, the question begs to be asked: why
would someone turn down the Redskins job? It is,
after all, one of the most notable coaching gigs in
the game and the franchise's history extends back
to the 19305. Look no further than the big boss
man himself, derisively nicknamed "Danny Boy."
Snyder became very rich, very quickly and de
cided to buy the Redskins in 1999. While his
shrewdness as a businessman has rarely come into
question Washington routinely ranks at or
near the top of the NFL's most profitable fran
chises his skills as a talent evaluator leave a lot
to be desired. Actually, scratch that since he
has absolutely no deftness in that area, they leave
everything to be desired. And, like many men of
considerable power and even greater ego, he feels
that he can run the team not just as an owner, but
also as a manager.
That presents a very real problem for the foot
ball side of the Redskins, since the coaches are
forced to work with people that the owner deems
desirable.This is not a tactic of successful franchis
es, which leave that aspect to professionals.
Cincinnati, Oakland, Washington they are all
teams that have struggled mightily in recent years

and all are teams whose owners es
sentially act as general managers.
Technically, Snyder has a GM
Vinny Cerrato, the very definition of
a puppet. That means that when
Danny Boy has a little crush on a
player, he gets him, even though those
little affairs rarely work out for the
better.

But where were we? Oh yes, back
to Zorn.

Two things were clear from the be
ginning of his tenure. First, that he
wasn't Snyder's top choice. Second,
that he was in over his head. But who
can blame him? Snyder offered him
$l5 million over five years to take the
job —it would take him triple the
time to make as much as a position
coach.

Problems began when Zorn intro
duced the West Coast Offense
(WCO), which goes directly against
the strengths of the Skins' young
starting quarterback, Jason Camp
bell, who has a big arm and likes to air
it out. The WCO calls for shorter pat
terns and more restraint. Campbell
has subsequently failed to progress
over the past year and change in
fact, he's regressed. Couple an unsta
ble quarterback one made even
more unhappy because of offseason
trade rumors with a decimated of
fensive line and two aging running

backs and you have the recipe for suc
cess!
The Redskins went south quickly
in 2009. They gave Detroit their first
win since 2007 and the only teams
they have beaten are the currently
winless: the St. Louis Rams and the
Tampa Bay Bucs. Fans grew anxious
and linebacker Robert Flenson took
to what else? Twitter to call
them out for being "half hearted."
By the beginning of October, Sny
der decided to hire Sherm Lewis, who
was wait for it playing bingo
when he took Danny Boy's call, to
serve as an "offensive consultant."
That essentially ended Zorn's tenure
with the team, but he wouldn't quit
why would he and lose out on mil
lions? and Snyder didn't want to
lose face by firing him. Before Mon
