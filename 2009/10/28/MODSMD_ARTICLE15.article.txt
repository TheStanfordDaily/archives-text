# Redskins spiraling out of control

Larry Johnson's Twitter problems aside, the
most compelling drama of the 2009 NFL
season has been the ongoing soap opera
that is the Washington Redskins.
Let's recap.
After a fourth place finish last year in arguably
the toughest division in football, the Skins looked
to make the jump back into the playoffs. They
once again earned the title of Champions of the
Offseason, as they dropped $lOO million to sign
defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth, the jewel
of the free agent class.
As an indicator of how quickly Washington's
season has gone downhill, let's note that it is not
even the midway point of 2009 and Haynesworth
has already developed a reputation for being out
of shape his "breaks" on long drives have be
come commonplace and outspoken. They
guaranteed this man $4l million. This is not even
remotely close to their biggest problem. But I di
gress.
2009 marked the second season of coach Jim
Zorn's tenure. Zorn is a career position coach
who was hired as the offensive coordinator during
the 2008 offseason, but was promptly promoted to
head coach after only two weeks on the job.
"Why?" is anyone's guess, but the educated one
says that owner Daniel Snyder was rejected by
higher profile coaches, such as Jim Mora and

Steve Spagnuolo and needed a quick fix to avoid
embarrassment. Enter Zorn.
Of course, the question begs to be asked: why
would someone turn down the Redskins job? It is,
after all, one of the most notable coaching gigs in
the game and the franchise's history extends back
to the 19305. Look no further than the big boss
man himself, derisively nicknamed "Danny Boy."
Snyder became very rich, very quickly and de
cided to buy the Redskins in 1999. While his
shrewdness as a businessman has rarely come into
question Washington routinely ranks at or
near the top of the NFL's most profitable fran
chises his skills as a talent evaluator leave a lot
to be desired. Actually, scratch that since he
has absolutely no deftness in that area, they leave
everything to be desired. And, like many men of
considerable power and even greater ego, he feels
that he can run the team not just as an owner, but
also as a manager.
That presents a very real problem for the foot
ball side of the Redskins, since the coaches are
forced to work with people that the owner deems
desirable.This is not a tactic of successful franchis
es, which leave that aspect to professionals.
Cincinnati, Oakland, Washington they are all
teams that have struggled mightily in recent years
