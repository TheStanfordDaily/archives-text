# A 						TASTE OF SAMBA
## Freshman brings Brazilian passion to Cardinal soccer 
### LAUREN TAYLOR 
As the Stanford women's soccer team adds win after
win to its flawless record, expectations continue to
rise. With last year's nearly perfect 22-2-1 season,
nine returning starters and the team's current No. 1
national ranking, the possibility of a national cham
pionship is real and the pressure on the players is high.
Yet it apparently isn't enough to stop freshman starter Mari
ah Nogueira, an already dominating force for the Cardinal at de
fensive center midfield. As one of the squad's youngest members
and also a previous Pac-10 Conference Player of the Week,
Nogueira has proven to everyone that age really is just a number.
Just how did she become so talented? Passion. With a Brazil
ian background, a love for the game of soccer is literally in her

blood. Since the age of six, when her father and grandmother
first encouraged her to step on the field, Nogueira has had the
desire to get out there and play.

However, soccer is not the only sport that has earned her de
votion over the years. A self-proclaimed "sporty girl," Nogueira
enjoys spending her time doing anything that requires physical
activity. This was certainly evident during her high school years,
in which she excelled as a three-sport varsity athlete. She played
volleyball and softball in addition to soccer, rightfully becoming
the 2009 Orange County Athlete of the Year. This impressive ac
colade was only one of many, as Nogueira was also an NSCAA
All-American, Student of the Year, Student-Athlete of the Year
and Athlete of the Year at Marina High School in her hometown
of Huntington Beach, California.

In fact, a future in softball surely would have been attainable

for Nogueira, as she achieved a .371
batting average, 19 RBI, and 13
stolen bases during her final high
school season, all of which were
league-leading statistics. The Sunset
League MVP and All-Southern Sec
tion first-team infielder had very
promising skills in the sport, yet it
was soccer that she chose to pursue.
Why? Because, quite simply, for her
it was "more fun."

"Soccer is very active and versa
tile. You have more room to be cre
ative," Nogueira said, also noting that
she felt she had a brighter future in
the soccer realm as opposed to soft
ball or volleyball.

The Farm is fortunate for this de
cision; Nogueira has already made a
tremendous impact on the team this
season. Head Coach Paul Ratcliffe is
certainly thrilled to have her on the
field, stating that Nogueira has been
"exceptional."
"She is an integral part of the cen
ter midfield," Ratcliffe said. "She has
brought a lot to the team as a fresh
man, especially because of her head
ing ability and calming effect on the
team in terms of both playmaking
and level of skill."
Furthermore, though she is sur
rounded by mostly older players, it is
not hard to see that Nogueira has
quickly settled into a leadership posi
tion. Her ball winning and possession
skills are definitely apparent but she
also contributes to the team effort by
consistently staying vocal and enthu
siastic.
"As a player I think she's already
taking on a leadership role in the
midfield," Ratcliffe said. "The team
really looks up to her."

Her title as captain on her high
school team and club team, Slam
mers, undoubtedly helped her to de
velop the leadership qualities she has
carried to the Farm. In fact, Nogueira
led the Slammers to four state cham
pionships and a third place position
at Nationals in 2007.

This experience sufficiently pre
pared her for her Stanford soccer ca
reer, which so far has been "awe
some," in Noguiera's words.The tran
sition to collegiate soccer was made
easier by Coach Ratcliffe's playing
style that Nogueira says is "very
much about possession," which hap
pens to be her strong suit. Preseason
double-days and daily physical train
ing have also made her capable of
dealing with the much faster and
more physical game than the one she
played in high school.
But it is the strong team chemistry
that Nogueira finds most beneficial.
Her favorite parts of her freshman
soccer experience thus far are the
friendships she has created with the
other players.
"There's no drama," Noguiera
said. "The upperclassmen are re
spectful of the underclassmen and
we all hang out off the field, which
helps us play much better as a team."
It was this sense of team unity that
helped produce last weekend's victo
ries over USC and No. 3 UCLA,
which Nogueira claimed was her
highlight of the season so far. But
with only three games left in the Pac
-10, Nogueira and her teammates are
looking toward the future: she envi
sions a conference title and hopes to
appear in the national championship
at the end of November. With the
season's current pace and Nogueira's
contributions at center midfield, the
team can certainly do just that.
