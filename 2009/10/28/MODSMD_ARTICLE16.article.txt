## Freshman brings Brazilian passion to Cardinal soccer 
### LAUREN TAYLOR 
As the Stanford women's soccer team adds win after
win to its flawless record, expectations continue to
rise. With last year's nearly perfect 22-2-1 season,
nine returning starters and the team's current No. 1
national ranking, the possibility of a national cham
pionship is real and the pressure on the players is high.
Yet it apparently isn't enough to stop freshman starter Mari
ah Nogueira, an already dominating force for the Cardinal at de
fensive center midfield. As one of the squad's youngest members
and also a previous Pac-10 Conference Player of the Week,
Nogueira has proven to everyone that age really is just a number.
Just how did she become so talented? Passion. With a Brazil
ian background, a love for the game of soccer is literally in her

blood. Since the age of six, when her father and grandmother
first encouraged her to step on the field, Nogueira has had the
desire to get out there and play.

However, soccer is not the only sport that has earned her de
votion over the years. A self-proclaimed "sporty girl," Nogueira
enjoys spending her time doing anything that requires physical
activity. This was certainly evident during her high school years,
in which she excelled as a three-sport varsity athlete. She played
volleyball and softball in addition to soccer, rightfully becoming
the 2009 Orange County Athlete of the Year. This impressive ac
colade was only one of many, as Nogueira was also an NSCAA
All-American, Student of the Year, Student-Athlete of the Year
and Athlete of the Year at Marina High School in her hometown
of Huntington Beach, California.

In fact, a future in softball surely would have been attainable
