# When swine meets sports
## Cardinal athletes deal with H1N1 
### CLAUDIA LOPEZ 
Swine flu seems to have swept through
most of Stanford University, infiltrating
dorm halls and cancelling main events, in
cluding Full Moon On The Quad. No one
seems to be immune to the disease, even
athletes. They may practice for hours a
day and seem in top health, but this form
of influenza appears to be merciless. It is
more important than ever that athletes
know how to stay healthy and keep up the
game during this flu season.
Some athletes, however, cannot avoid
getting sick. Students miss approximately
three to four days of class, a potentially
damaging amount of time in the quarter
system, especially if an athlete has prac
tice every day. Even if students show a
slight fever, they are quarantined until
they present no fever for twenty-four
hours without any medication.
Freshman synchronized swimmer
Megan Hansley was quarantined for ap
proximately three days; she was forced to
stay in her room in complete isolation,
having food and homework delivered to
her.
"It was really hard because it was dur
ing the preliminary training season,"
Hansley said. "Conditioning is really im
portant so that you are in shape for prime
competition."
After her illness, Hansley had to show

her coach and her team she was ready to
come back.
"It was hard because by that point the
team was already familiar with the work
outs," Hansley said.
Even though many students around
campus were sick, activities still contin
ued, including classes and practice for
many sports. For this reason, it took Hans
ley longer to get to the point where the
rest of the team was.
Now that Hansley is better, she and the
rest of the team take extra precautions to
stay healthy.
"In the weight room the first thing we
have to do after we workout is use hand
sanitizer," she said.
Since the pools contain chlorine, most
of the bacteria there are killed; the team's
main concern is to keep the weightlifting
equipment clean.
Similarly, in lightweight crew, it is ex
tremely important to keep communal
equipment sanitary.
"We make a point of using hand sani
tizer in the weight room and at the boat
house," said freshman lightweight rower
Caitlin Morgan.
The crew team also makes sure their
boating equipment is clean, since the Bay
water can make equipment dirty and po
tentially hazardous.

Stanford athletes have recognized the need to take preventative measures against contracting swine flu. Even traditional actions such as
shaking hands with opponents have been met with precautions like using hand sanitizers in the locker room afterward.
"We dip our handles in bleach
after each use," Morgan said. "We
wash the boats after each row and Sat
urday is our 'get out the toothbrushes
and scrub away' day."

This flu season seems to have Car
dinal athletes working hard to stay
healthy. In some games, however,
contact with the opposing team is
necessary and therefore exposure to
germs is inevitable. Handshakes of
appreciation are always customary
after a football game. Teams need to
demonstrate good sportsmanship
and find away to keep clean. The

football team seems to be taking
extra safety measures in the locker
room to protect its players.
"With the recent flu outbreak the
team has taken extra precaution and
we now have bottles of hand sanitizer
in all the locker rooms," said fresh
man wide receiver Jemari Roberts.
"[The coaches] believe it is the most
we can do to prevent from getting
sick, aside from a lot of sleep and
plenty of fluids."
The women's field hockey team
has also been very cautious with their
players, especially during their trip to
Philadelphia in early October.
"A lot of people were feeling under
the weather during that Philadelphia
trip," freshman goalkeeper Julia
LaSalvia said. "Our trainer was pro
viding everyone with Emergen-C."

Her roommate was also sick dur
ing the main cycle of swine flu that
swept through the University.
"I remember the day she got sick I
ended up eating a lot of broccoli and
orange juice," LaSalvia said. "I was
definitely worried about getting sick."

"Overall the team has been a lot
more conscious about washing hands,
getting fluids and getting the right
amount of sleep," he added.
Each sport is staying sanitary in
similar ways, coping with the hard hit
of flu this season. Athletes need to re
member that outside of the hand san
itizer-filled locker rooms, swine flu
thrives and is ready to strike anyone
who crosses its path.
