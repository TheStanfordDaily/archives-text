## 'Unstuffing' pressures Stern Dining More traffic from Crothers, Toy on as Dining tries to help 
### JANE LEPHAM STAFF WRITER 
When East Campus became home to the
newly renovated Crothers Hall in September,
the lack of a new dining hall left the residence
hall's 376 residents looking for a place to eat.
Now, Student Housing's recent move to
"unstuff" dorms has some students and
administrators asking whether dining halls are
overcrowded as a result.
According to Executive Director of
Stanford Dining Eric Montell, while the
Housing Master Plan uncrowded and
improved many student residences on campus,
it has also significantly impacted the dining
meal program, prompting Dining to respond.
"These enhanced days of operation [at
Stern and Manzanita dining] and meal options
are in response to student requests and the
increased number of meal-plan students to the
region with the addition of Crothers, Crothers
Memorial and Toyon to the meal plan,"
Montell said in an e-mail to The Daily.
Toyon Hall, which houses mainly sopho
mores, was added to the Dining meal plan
when the hall's Eating Clubs closed last year.
"While the Eating Clubs are on hiatus
pending relocation to a more appropriate
space, Toyon [and Crothers] students are now
part of the Stanford Dining meal plan and are
able to eat in any of the Stanford Dining halls,
have additional access to Late Night Dining
operations and the flexibility of using meal
plan dollars in designated Stanford Hospitality
& Auxiliaries cafes," Montell said. "This signif
icantly enhances their dining program with
added flexibility, and added more campus
choices than in years past."
While the newly renamed Linx @ Toyon
took over the Eating Clubs' space earlier this
year, both Linx and the Branner dining hall
close on the weekends, adding to Stern din
ing's load. Students who have eaten at Stern in
the past have noticed the significant change in
the dining hall's capacity and traffic.
"I feel like there's definitely been a lot
more people in Stern this year because
Crothers doesn't have a dining hall," said
Colin Roach 'l2, a Toyon resident who lived in
Larkin last year. "It's pretty obvious that if
Crothers doesn't have a dining hall, they're
going to go to Stern because it's the closest."
Tom Kozlowski 'll made a similar observa
tion. "The first couple weeks of the year, a lot
of Crothers people were eating at Toyon, and
we regularly ran out of food," Kozlowski said.
"I think people realized that and started tran
sitioning over to Stern, which makes sense
it's a much bigger dining hall and can handle
the capacity."
Although both Crothers and Toyon resi
dents have the option of eating at Linx, many
cite more flexible hours and a wider food
selection as reasons why they end up frequent
ing the Stern dining hall anyway.
"Stern seems pretty busy, but that's
because the hours are terrible at the Linx and
they have very limited selection," said Peter
Gail 'l2. "At least at Stern, even though it's
busy, they have options for people with aller
gies. I can't eat food items with wheat, and all
the food at the Linx has wheat in it."
Kozlowski, who lived in Toyon last year and


AVERY WEIDMAN/The Stanford Daily
is on staff there this year, suggested
that better use of resources at Linx
could alleviate the capacity problems
placed on Stern.
"I think the problem that Dining
made when they did the switchover
was underutilizing Toyon dining," he
said. "While there are some con
straints in terms of seating area
indoors, the sheer fact of the matter
is they can serve more food there,
which can offset the load that
Crothers is putting on Stern.
"And another problem I see with
them handling Crothers' opening,"
he continued, "is not using the
kitchens in Toyon dining . . . I'm
sure if they cooked the food onsite

by using the Toyon kitchens, the eat
ing experience would be much more
enjoyable."
Aside from having to dine in
crowded quarters, some Crothers
residents are frustrated by the trek
to the dining hall, though some mit
igation efforts by Dining seem to be
working.
"Not having our own dining hall
blows chunks," said Naomi Shachter
'l2. "I don't like having to travel for
my food, and I dislike the fact that I
can't eat with my dorm mates
because I feel like that's an integral
part of the experience.
"However, I do enjoy the
Crothers barbecues," she added, ref
erencing the Dining-hosted barbe
cues in the Crothers courtyard on
Friday nights.
Montell said those barbecues
were "to build community in their
newly renovated residence while

having a fun and festive event."
While Stern has experienced
increased levels of traffic, Wilbur
dining hall is serving fewer students
than last year for two reasons,
according to Dining's executive
director. The residence was
uncrowded, and Manzanita, where
many upper-class students are
choosing to eat this year, is open for
brunch and dinner on the weekends.
A new two-story dining hall for
Crothers and Toyon students is in
its final stages of planning and is
scheduled to open in fall 2011.
Slated to be housed in the current
Toyon parking lot adjacent to
Crothers and Toyon, it will be the
first residential dining hall built on
campus in 18 years, according to
Montell.
