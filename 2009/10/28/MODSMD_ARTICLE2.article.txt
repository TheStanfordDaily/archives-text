## 'Unstuffing' pressures Stern Dining More traffic from Crothers, Toy on as Dining tries to help 
### JANE LEPHAM STAFF WRITER 
When East Campus became home to the
newly renovated Crothers Hall in September,
the lack of a new dining hall left the residence
hall's 376 residents looking for a place to eat.
Now, Student Housing's recent move to
"unstuff" dorms has some students and
administrators asking whether dining halls are
overcrowded as a result.
According to Executive Director of
Stanford Dining Eric Montell, while the
Housing Master Plan uncrowded and
improved many student residences on campus,
it has also significantly impacted the dining
meal program, prompting Dining to respond.
"These enhanced days of operation [at
Stern and Manzanita dining] and meal options
are in response to student requests and the
increased number of meal-plan students to the
region with the addition of Crothers, Crothers
Memorial and Toyon to the meal plan,"
Montell said in an e-mail to The Daily.
Toyon Hall, which houses mainly sopho
mores, was added to the Dining meal plan
when the hall's Eating Clubs closed last year.
"While the Eating Clubs are on hiatus
pending relocation to a more appropriate
space, Toyon [and Crothers] students are now
part of the Stanford Dining meal plan and are
able to eat in any of the Stanford Dining halls,
have additional access to Late Night Dining
operations and the flexibility of using meal
plan dollars in designated Stanford Hospitality
& Auxiliaries cafes," Montell said. "This signif
icantly enhances their dining program with
added flexibility, and added more campus
choices than in years past."
While the newly renamed Linx @ Toyon
took over the Eating Clubs' space earlier this
year, both Linx and the Branner dining hall
close on the weekends, adding to Stern din
ing's load. Students who have eaten at Stern in
the past have noticed the significant change in
the dining hall's capacity and traffic.
"I feel like there's definitely been a lot
more people in Stern this year because
Crothers doesn't have a dining hall," said
Colin Roach 'l2, a Toyon resident who lived in
Larkin last year. "It's pretty obvious that if
Crothers doesn't have a dining hall, they're
going to go to Stern because it's the closest."
Tom Kozlowski 'll made a similar observa
tion. "The first couple weeks of the year, a lot
of Crothers people were eating at Toyon, and
we regularly ran out of food," Kozlowski said.
"I think people realized that and started tran
sitioning over to Stern, which makes sense
it's a much bigger dining hall and can handle
the capacity."
Although both Crothers and Toyon resi
dents have the option of eating at Linx, many
cite more flexible hours and a wider food
selection as reasons why they end up frequent
ing the Stern dining hall anyway.
"Stern seems pretty busy, but that's
because the hours are terrible at the Linx and
they have very limited selection," said Peter
Gail 'l2. "At least at Stern, even though it's
busy, they have options for people with aller
gies. I can't eat food items with wheat, and all
the food at the Linx has wheat in it."
