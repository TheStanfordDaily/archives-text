# Professor fights subpoena
## Proctor defends research freedom in tobacco suit 
### TYLER BROWN RYAN MAC 
Students who have taken the
IHUM course "World History of
Science" in the last two years proba
bly know history Prof. Robert
Proctor for his crusade against the
tobacco industry. Bespectacled and
typically relaxed, he was often found
in front of hundreds of freshmen pre
senting incriminating evidence
against the business.
The professor has also appeared
as a witness in 15 lawsuits against
tobacco companies since 1998 and
most recently agreed to appear in
court on behalf of the plaintiffs in
Stella Koballa, et al., etc. v. Philip
Morris U.S.A., Inc., et al., etc., a civil
lawsuit filed in 2007 against Philip
Morris U.S.A., Inc., R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. and several other large
tobacco firms.
But in this latest bout with Big
Tobacco, Proctor is facing stiff oppo
sition.
While the suit awaits trial in the
Seventh Judicial Circuit Court of
Florida, lawyers for RJ. Reynolds are

attempting to obtain a manuscript of
the professor's still-unpublished
book on the tobacco industry and
already had a subpoena for the work
approved in late August. The defense
wanted to use this manuscript for the
cross-examination of Proctor when
he takes the stand for the plaintiffs.
For Proctor, R.J. Reynolds'
attempt to obtain his unpublished
book, entitled Golden Holocaust: A
History of Global Tobacco, is an
attack on his private work and credi
bility before he can even take the
witness stand.
"The tobacco industry is trying to
win its cases by intimidating witness
es and harassing me," Proctor said.
"One of the ways they're doing it is
by trying to get my unpublished man
uscript, which is not finished and had
not been submitted for publication.
"The idea of them trying to get
this is repugnant and is a violation of
first amendment rights," he added.
Contacted by The Daily for com
ment, R.J. Reynolds spokesman John
Singleton could not provide com
ment on the case. The company's liti
gation spokesman, David Howard,

did not return repeated requests for
comment.

Proctor's Case
While the subpoena has been
approved, Proctor and the plaintiffs
have yet to submit to the court's
order. Instead, more than a week
after the subpoena was issued, the
plaintiffs filed a motion in the hopes
the court would reconsider the deci
sion.
In the 27-page motion, the plain
tiffs argued that the court's decision
to obtain Proctor's work violated his
rights to independently publish the
book, to keep individual privacy and
to gather information under the First
Amendment. As such, the motion
also asked that the work be placed
under a protective order, preventing
access to the manuscript for use as
evidence in a court of law.
For Proctor, one of his primary
concerns is the decision's implication
for research. He said he believes this
case could create a precedent that
encourages litigants to subpoena
