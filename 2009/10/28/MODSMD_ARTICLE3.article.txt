# Professor fights subpoena
## Proctor defends research freedom in tobacco suit 
### TYLER BROWN RYAN MAC 
Students who have taken the
IHUM course "World History of
Science" in the last two years proba
bly know history Prof. Robert
Proctor for his crusade against the
tobacco industry. Bespectacled and
typically relaxed, he was often found
in front of hundreds of freshmen pre
senting incriminating evidence
against the business.
The professor has also appeared
as a witness in 15 lawsuits against
tobacco companies since 1998 and
most recently agreed to appear in
court on behalf of the plaintiffs in
Stella Koballa, et al., etc. v. Philip
Morris U.S.A., Inc., et al., etc., a civil
lawsuit filed in 2007 against Philip
Morris U.S.A., Inc., R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. and several other large
tobacco firms.
But in this latest bout with Big
Tobacco, Proctor is facing stiff oppo
sition.
While the suit awaits trial in the
Seventh Judicial Circuit Court of
Florida, lawyers for RJ. Reynolds are

attempting to obtain a manuscript of
the professor's still-unpublished
book on the tobacco industry and
already had a subpoena for the work
approved in late August. The defense
wanted to use this manuscript for the
cross-examination of Proctor when
he takes the stand for the plaintiffs.
For Proctor, R.J. Reynolds'
attempt to obtain his unpublished
book, entitled Golden Holocaust: A
History of Global Tobacco, is an
attack on his private work and credi
bility before he can even take the
witness stand.
"The tobacco industry is trying to
win its cases by intimidating witness
es and harassing me," Proctor said.
"One of the ways they're doing it is
by trying to get my unpublished man
uscript, which is not finished and had
not been submitted for publication.
"The idea of them trying to get
this is repugnant and is a violation of
first amendment rights," he added.
Contacted by The Daily for com
ment, R.J. Reynolds spokesman John
Singleton could not provide com
ment on the case. The company's liti
gation spokesman, David Howard,

did not return repeated requests for
comment.

Proctor's Case
While the subpoena has been
approved, Proctor and the plaintiffs
have yet to submit to the court's
order. Instead, more than a week
after the subpoena was issued, the
plaintiffs filed a motion in the hopes
the court would reconsider the deci
sion.
In the 27-page motion, the plain
tiffs argued that the court's decision
to obtain Proctor's work violated his
rights to independently publish the
book, to keep individual privacy and
to gather information under the First
Amendment. As such, the motion
also asked that the work be placed
under a protective order, preventing
access to the manuscript for use as
evidence in a court of law.
For Proctor, one of his primary
concerns is the decision's implication
for research. He said he believes this
case could create a precedent that
encourages litigants to subpoena

unfinished and unreviewed work in
the future. Currently, Proctor's man
uscript has not been edited and,
according to the professor, are just
"notes and thoughts."
"For a polluting industry, the abil
ity to get [unpublished work] would
have a chilling effect on academia,"
he said. "For them to have access to
notes before they are finished
impairs ability to conduct research."
The University agreed. On Oct. 8,
after meeting with Proctor and Staff
Counsel Lauren Schoenthaler, Vice
Provost and Dean of Research Ann
Arvin filed an amicus curiae brief
supporting the plaintiff's motion on
behalf of the University. The brief
expressed concern that forcibly
revealing unreviewed work would
damage a scholar's reputation and
deter others from serving as witness
es in any court case for the future.
"Stanford has a broad interest in
ensuring that not only Stanford pro
fessors, but all faculty members at
other research institutions, are able
to conduct research... without fear
that serving as an expert witness will
force them to pre-publish unfinished
research efforts through compelled
disclosure," Arvin wrote in the brief.

So far, Proctor has spent $27,000
in legal fees to protect his work.
Regardless of the implications for

academia and individual rights, the
plaintiffs' main focus is retaining
their "single most important wit
ness." For Bill Ogle, the lawyer repre
senting the Koballa family, the fear is
that the manuscript could be used to
dissuade Proctor from taking the
stand.
"The result will be [the tobacco
companies will] use that unpub
lished work to try to create areas for
cross-examination based upon state
ments that may be in that work
statements that may be taken out of
context," Ogle said. "We would lose
our primary witness."
As It Stands
Koballa v. Philip Morris is still
awaiting trial in the Seventh Judicial
Circuit Court of Florida. Aside from
the legal wrangling surrounding
Proctor, the case has also been
delayed because of the decision to
replace the original presiding judge.
It was deemed that the judge,
William A. Parsons, was unfit to
oversee to the case because his
daughter is employed by Cobb Cole,
a law firm assisting the plaintiffs.
Parsons' office did not return
calls for comment.
Like many other lawsuits against
tobacco companies, Koballa alleges
that the tobacco companies con
cealed information about the haz
ards of smoking in the 1950s and
19605, causing individuals to smoke
without regard to health risks,
including cancer. The defendant,
Stella Koballa, is a lung cancer sur-

vivor and currently suffers from
emphysema.
Ogle declined to comment on the
damages the Koballas are seeking,
but doubted the case will settle out
of court. "Tobacco companies have
adopted a policy in litigation where
they, as a matter of strategy, will
never settle a case," he said. "They
have so many financial resources."
If the subpoena stands, Proctor
believes lawsuits against big tobacco
will only get harder. "Over 40 histo
rians have testified for tobacco and
only three against, and there's a
huge asymmetry here," Proctor said.
"It's hard to find historians that are
willing to testify against the industry
... it's sort of a David versus Goliath
situation."

Proctor, the case has also been
delayed because of the decision to
replace the original presiding judge.
It was deemed that the judge,
William A. Parsons, was unfit to
oversee to the case because his
daughter is employed by Cobb Cole,
a law firm assisting the plaintiffs.
Parsons' office did not return
calls for comment.
Like many other lawsuits against
tobacco companies, Koballa alleges
that the tobacco companies con
cealed information about the haz
ards of smoking in the 1950s and
19605, causing individuals to smoke
without regard to health risks,
including cancer. The defendant,
Stella Koballa, is a lung cancer sur-

vivor and currently suffers from
emphysema.
Ogle declined to comment on the
damages the Koballas are seeking,
but doubted the case will settle out
of court. "Tobacco companies have
adopted a policy in litigation where
they, as a matter of strategy, will
never settle a case," he said. "They
have so many financial resources."
If the subpoena stands, Proctor
believes lawsuits against big tobacco
will only get harder. "Over 40 histo
rians have testified for tobacco and
only three against, and there's a
huge asymmetry here," Proctor said.
"It's hard to find historians that are
willing to testify against the industry
... it's sort of a David versus Goliath
situation."

PROE ROBERT PROCTOR
Students who have taken the
IHUM course "World History of
Science" in the last two years proba
bly know history Prof. Robert
Proctor for his crusade against the
tobacco industry. Bespectacled and
typically relaxed, he was often found
in front of hundreds of freshmen pre
senting incriminating evidence
against the business.
The professor has also appeared
as a witness in 15 lawsuits against
tobacco companies since 1998 and
most recently agreed to appear in
court on behalf of the plaintiffs in
Stella Koballa, et al., etc. v. Philip
Morris U.S.A., Inc., et al., etc., a civil
lawsuit filed in 2007 against Philip
Morris U.S.A., Inc., R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. and several other large
tobacco firms.
But in this latest bout with Big
Tobacco, Proctor is facing stiff oppo
sition.
While the suit awaits trial in the
Seventh Judicial Circuit Court of
Florida, lawyers for RJ. Reynolds are

attempting to obtain a manuscript of
the professor's still-unpublished
book on the tobacco industry and
already had a subpoena for the work
approved in late August. The defense
wanted to use this manuscript for the
cross-examination of Proctor when
he takes the stand for the plaintiffs.
For Proctor, R.J. Reynolds'
attempt to obtain his unpublished
book, entitled Golden Holocaust: A
History of Global Tobacco, is an
attack on his private work and credi
bility before he can even take the
witness stand.
"The tobacco industry is trying to
win its cases by intimidating witness
es and harassing me," Proctor said.
"One of the ways they're doing it is
by trying to get my unpublished man
uscript, which is not finished and had
not been submitted for publication.
"The idea of them trying to get
this is repugnant and is a violation of
first amendment rights," he added.
Contacted by The Daily for com
ment, R.J. Reynolds spokesman John
Singleton could not provide com
ment on the case. The company's liti
gation spokesman, David Howard,

did not return repeated requests for
comment.

Proctor's Case
While the subpoena has been
approved, Proctor and the plaintiffs
have yet to submit to the court's
order. Instead, more than a week
after the subpoena was issued, the
plaintiffs filed a motion in the hopes
the court would reconsider the deci
sion.
In the 27-page motion, the plain
tiffs argued that the court's decision
to obtain Proctor's work violated his
rights to independently publish the
book, to keep individual privacy and
to gather information under the First
Amendment. As such, the motion
also asked that the work be placed
under a protective order, preventing
access to the manuscript for use as
evidence in a court of law.
For Proctor, one of his primary
concerns is the decision's implication
for research. He said he believes this
case could create a precedent that
encourages litigants to subpoena

unfinished and unreviewed work in
the future. Currently, Proctor's man
uscript has not been edited and,
according to the professor, are just
"notes and thoughts."
"For a polluting industry, the abil
ity to get [unpublished work] would
have a chilling effect on academia,"
he said. "For them to have access to
notes before they are finished
impairs ability to conduct research."
The University agreed. On Oct. 8,
after meeting with Proctor and Staff
Counsel Lauren Schoenthaler, Vice
Provost and Dean of Research Ann
Arvin filed an amicus curiae brief
supporting the plaintiff's motion on
behalf of the University. The brief
expressed concern that forcibly
revealing unreviewed work would
damage a scholar's reputation and
deter others from serving as witness
es in any court case for the future.
"Stanford has a broad interest in
ensuring that not only Stanford pro
fessors, but all faculty members at
other research institutions, are able
to conduct research... without fear
that serving as an expert witness will
force them to pre-publish unfinished
research efforts through compelled
disclosure," Arvin wrote in the brief.

So far, Proctor has spent $27,000
in legal fees to protect his work.
Regardless of the implications for

academia and individual rights, the
plaintiffs' main focus is retaining
their "single most important wit
ness." For Bill Ogle, the lawyer repre
senting the Koballa family, the fear is
that the manuscript could be used to
dissuade Proctor from taking the
stand.
"The result will be [the tobacco
companies will] use that unpub
lished work to try to create areas for
cross-examination based upon state
ments that may be in that work
statements that may be taken out of
context," Ogle said. "We would lose
our primary witness."
As It Stands
Koballa v. Philip Morris is still
awaiting trial in the Seventh Judicial
Circuit Court of Florida. Aside from
the legal wrangling surrounding
Proctor, the case has also been
delayed because of the decision to
replace the original presiding judge.
It was deemed that the judge,
William A. Parsons, was unfit to
oversee to the case because his
daughter is employed by Cobb Cole,
a law firm assisting the plaintiffs.
Parsons' office did not return

vivor and currently suffers from
