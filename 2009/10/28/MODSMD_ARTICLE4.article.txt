## Senate: Pizza for town hall, but how much? Group compares rules for food spending, sustainability 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
Tuesday's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting turned into a food fight of sorts.
Last night, Senators debated how much
money they would spend on food for the
ASSU town hall on Thursday in the wake
of newly tightened restrictions on other
student groups' food spending. Also con
tested was how the Senate would enforce
the sustainable event guidelines it will soon
vote on and whether it was capable of over
seeing itself when it comes to ensuring its
own events follow the green rules.
New Senate associates and their new
freshman aides filled most of the public's
seats at last night's packed meeting, where
Senior Class President Walter Foxworth
announced that Aria Florant 'lO has been
chosen to replace former president Claire
Roscow 'lO, who resigned last week.
The Senate also met Sonali Chopra 'll,
who is set to serve as the ASSU executives'
sustainability chairperson, and graduate
student Hariharan Vijay, who had been
named the executives' social chairperson.
The group also confirmed the nominees
to the Board of Judicial Affairs reported
earlier in The Daily.
But the bulk of last night's talks cen
tered on food spending, sustainability and
the role both issues will play in Thursday's
town hall meeting, which is sponsored by
the executives, the Senate and the
Graduate Student Council.

Town Hall
Some senators seemed surprise by the
executives' request that the undergradu
ates co-sponsor Thursday's gathering, with
Chair Varun Sivaram 'll acknowledging
that executives David Gobaud 'OB M.S. 'lO
and Jay de la Torre 'lO only made the
request last week after the Senate meeting.
The executives' request, specifically, was
that the Senate give $2OO from discre
tionary funding for pizza for attendees to
the 5:30 p.m. event.
This comes on the heels of an Oct. 25
notice from Appropriations Committee
Chair Anton Zietsman 'l2 to student group
financial officers that said food spending
would be curbed.
"In our continued effort to lead a fiscal
ly responsible Senate, the Appropriations
Committee is trying to curb excessive or
unnecessary spending," Zietsman said in

the e-mail announcement. "From now on,
the Committee will only fund food that is
absolutely essential to the occurrence of
the event.

"While we understand that food helps
attract people to an event, we believe that
attendance should be based off the merit of
the event as opposed to the type of food
that is provided," he continued.
On Tuesday, pizza remained on the
menu, but senators treaded cautiously.
"I'm concerned this contradicts a policy
of the Appropriations Committee," said
Senator Alex Katz 'l2, who proposed put
ting money toward the event at the "snack
rate" of $2 per undergraduate attendee

a suggestion that ultimately won out.
As to how many students are expected
to attend, de la Torre could only speculate.
"The upper bound, very, very optimistic,
is 600," he said. "I don't think we're going
to get to that." He said 300 was probably a
more realistic number, citing the graduate
town hall this summer as a similar case.
Green Guidelines
A bill defining "best sustainable prac
tices" for student group events, which
includes suggestions like buying com
postable foodware from the ASSU Green
Store, doing away with tablecloths and buy
ing local food, also held the senators' atten

tion last night. But whether student groups
and the Senate itself would be compelled
to follow the guidelines or face its con
sequences remains unclear.
Katz, the group's parliamentarian,
declared that a larger sustainability bill,
which would include the list of recom
mended practices, "does not mandate"
compliance.
Zietsman disagreed. "This is very sub
jective," he said. "The way that I under
stood it [was] ... we were creating a check
list we would impose on ourselves. In order
for this to be a trial run, it needs to be

"From now on, the [Appropriations] Committee will only fund food that is absolutely essential to the event," the Senate said in a policy
announcement to student groups earlier this week. Last night, the group debated how much it would spend on pizza for Thursday's ASSU-sponsored
town hall. Vice President Jay de la Torre '10 said he expects about 300 undergraduate and graduate students to attend.
imposed on ourselves."
If the Senate fails to do so, said
Senator Adam Creasman 'll, "it's a
signal to the student body that
we're not serious about this issue."
But possible consequences are
murky, as Senator Brian Wanyoike
'l2 noted.
"Are we going to punish our
selves?" he asked. "What would
that look like?"
Ultimately, the group unani
mously endorsed the list of green
suggestions, postponing the ques
tion of enforcement to next week's
meeting, set for 7 p.m. Tuesday in
the Old Union Nitery.
