## DAWN AT THE DISH Nature, newborns and first dates 
### STEPHANIE CHONG 
Lone joggers and chatty friends,
aging couples and new moms,
Stanford students and Palo Alto
residents all can be found fre
quenting the Dish on a Thursday
morning at sunrise.
The Dish, which rests on top of the hill
by the intersection of Campus Drive and
Junipero Serra Boulevard, is a disk-shaped
radio telescope used for research by
Stanford University. In everyday vernacu
lar, the term "the Dish" commonly refers to
the 3.5-mile long asphalt path circling this
massive radio structure.
"I love this place," commented a jogger

as she stopped for a quick breather. "Every
morning is exciting. It's nice to have this lit
tle piece of nature here in Silicon Valley."
Others couldn't agree more. There were
repeated mentions of deer, rabbit, hawks,
squirrels, mountain lions and, for the faint
of heart, snakes.
"You can see tarantulas!" one grand
motherly trekker exclaimed.
Wild animals aside, almost everyone
comes to the
Dish primari
ly for exer-

cise. Walkers and joggers alike cited self
discipline, heart health and the challenging
incline as motivations.
Ross Shachter, Serra House RF and
Associate Professor in Management
Science and Engineering, has been walking
the Dish four times a week since 1991. He
rarely misses a day, even when it rains.
"It's my mental health time," he said.
Nancy Klimp and Christine Bennett,
Dish regulars for almost ten years, pointed
to another reason for their walking routine.
"It affords us time for friendship," one
explained. "Knowing that the other But
not everyone here is a Dish veteran. A con
siderable number of young mothers bring
their newborn babies along for the hike.

One woman could be seen maneuvering
her 8-week old daughter in a stroller up the
initial incline.
"We did the Dish four days before she
was born and three weeks after," she said.
"She's a devoted Dishee."
Her companion had a similar experi
ence with her newborn son.
"My baby is still getting used to it," she
laughed. "He's a little bigger now, but at
first he used to hold onto the stroller with
his eyes popping out of his head."
These two stroller moms suggested that
the Dish was also appropriate for another
sort of first-timers new couples.
"I think it's a great first date," said the
first woman chuckling. "I've seen people

walking the Dish and I'll be like, 'Oh, they
totally look like they're on a first date.'"
A number of other Dish regulars pro
posed useful advice to achieve the optimal
Dish experience. Come in the morning, not
in the middle of the day. Start on the path to
the right because there's less of an uphill.
Try to appreciate the diversity of color.
Listen for the birds. Wear running shoes.
But perhaps Prof. Shachter provided the
most valuable summation of the Dish expe
rience.
"Everyone should visit the Dish," he
said. "It's one of the treasures on campus."
