# LUCKY CHARM: USING OLD PHONES TO IMPROVE HEALTHCARE
## 
### KATE ROSE 
What's in a name? For second-year Stanford
medical student Lucky Gunasekara, inspi
ration.
Having lived in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Korea and
Japan, Gunasekara comes from an extremely diverse cul
tural background, yet he still has strong ties to the Sri
Lankan heritage of his immigrant parents. It was during a
trip to Sri Lanka with them that he experienced what
would propel him into the world of global health aid, non
profit work and, ultimately, cell phones.
"They took me and my younger brother for a drive into
the countryside during a winter break in Sri Lanka when
we were visiting relatives, but didn't say where we were
going," he said. "We pulled over to the side of the road and
picked up trays of rices and curries, and so my brother and
I assumed that we were just getting food for a family gath
ering back in the villages."
However, what Gunasekara proceeded to see next
changed his life.
"We got to a clearing with a small house in it and grad
ually these children started crawling out," he said. "I say
crawling because they didn't have hands or feet. And then
it hit me they were children who lost their limbs and
sometimes their parents due to the landmines and suicide
bombings that had become regular tragedies in Sri Lanka
by then."
He remembers his father motioning for him to help one
child and feed him.
"It was just so surreal to be feeding a child who looks
just like you but will never have the life that you will," he
continued. "And the dividing line between him and me
was just luck. That was the day I learned the real meaning
behind my name."
This experience awakened a new state of consciousness
within him anger toward what he saw as major injus
tices and discrepancies within the societies of the develop
ing world.
Gunasekara proceeded to co-found a non-profit com
pany, FrontlineSMS: Medic, which works toward aiding
healthcare workers in third world countries through the
application of innovation and technology. Gunasekara,
along with other former and current Stanford students, has
come one step closer to vastly improving the healthcare
situation in countries like Malawi, Uganda and
Bangladesh, where the company now has full-scale opera
tions.
"The problem," said Nadim Mahmud, fellow medical
student and co-founder and research director of Frontline,
"is that central clinics are trying to provide care for hun
dreds of thousands of people who live in villages that are
sometimes at a great distance from the clinic itself, some
times more than 50 miles away."
In order to deal with this potential logistical nightmare,
community healthcare workers (CHWs) and volunteers or
paid individuals hired from respective villages have been
used to traffic medical information back and forth
between village and clinic. This includes records, medica
tions and treatment adherence updates.
FrontlineSMS: Medic, founded in February of this year,

hopes to eliminate this night
mare. The company utilizes a
piece of software called
FrontlineSMS, developed by
Ken Banks, a specialist in the
application of mobile technolo
gy. It has the capacity to turn a
laptop into a two-way text-mes
saging hub.
Medic workers collect
donated, used mobile phones
and provide healthcare workers
in the field with them. Medical
data and patient information
can then be collected by the
users and can be transferred
reliably and quickly via text
message to and from the laptop
hub, stationed at a main hospi
tal or clinic.
This helps to alleviate the
burden of exhausting and time
consuming routes back and
forth between villages and
hospitals taken by commu- >

nity workers in the field,
and eliminates the
reliance on paper
records, which are sus
ceptible to damage, j
loss and error.
In countries like
Malawi, where there
are only three doctors I
for every 100,000 peo- I
pie, the main challenge
is figuring out how to
treat the enormous
patient burden in coun
tries with no solid infra
structure for healthcare
practitioners.

"The answer is to
decentralize traditional
healthcare along the one
solid piece of infrastructure,
which is mobile phones,'
Mahmud said.
In Malawi, for example, the
cost to run the entire text-mes
saging network amounted to
under $5OO in six months.

Despite the short period of time
FrontlineSMS: Medic has been in
business, the staff is incredibly pleased '
with the progress. Medic is less than a
year old but in that time it has gone from
one clinic in Malawi with 250,000 patients
using the FrontlineSMS software to well over
2.5 million patients in 10 countries.
"Grown is an understatement at this point,"
Gunasekara said. "We've exploded."
But even for someone whose first toy was

Macintosh 128K, Gunasekara has found that this entire
experience from bursting into the global health and
non-profit sector as an undergraduate at Cornell
University to rounding up armies of Nokia and Samsung
oldies has been humbling.
"It's a blessing to be so close to the biggest problems in
global health and see them personally and to try and fix
them," he said. "I've been in the villages, sitting in the huts
and homes of health workers and patients, actively holding
myself accountable to them and trying to find ways to
improve their lives."
Co-founder Mahmud also considers his experiences
thus far to have been incredibly rewarding, especially
regarding his work with disease control in Bangladesh.
"Being a Bengali myself, it has been an amazing oppor
tunity to get in to spend time with some of the most hard
working and dedicated people in the country," he
explained. "Many of the community health workers there
are unpaid or paid only very nominal sums. It's human
altruism at its finest and one of the most endearing things
that I've witnessed."

Mahmud proposes that similar m-depth involve
ment in aid endeavors and personal interaction with
people in developing countries is what will have
L the greatest effect on improving the healthcare
V situation around the world.
"lt's too comfortable to think about a
problem abstractly when you're thousands
of miles away from the problem itself," he
said. "You really need to spend time with
people if you want to help them."
