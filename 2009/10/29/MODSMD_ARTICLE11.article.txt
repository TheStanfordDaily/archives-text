Sometimes, I don't know how I feel about
being an American.

Scratch that. Before you jump down my
throat, let me rephrase: Sometimes, I don't
know how I feel about being an American
abroad.
In Barcelona, Americans are infamous for
roaming about in packs and drinking their
way through the semester. Clubs boost their
weeknight business by holding what amount
to glorified frat parties with drinks that cost
ten dollars. Hotels in the area have blacklists
of certain (most) abroad programs that may
not frequent their establishments for fear of
noise complaints and property damage.
So, where does that leave Stanford, you
might ask? Surely our abroad offerings are
immune to such unpleasantries? I'm not so
sure.
Let's start with a place called George
Payne's. It falls into the large category of "Irish
Pubs" that dot the world over. While other Eu
ropean peoples have a spat of institutes
named after famous authors dedicated to
spreading their respective cultures the
Spanish Instituto Cervantes , the Catalan Insti
tut Ramon Llull and the British Council all
come to mind the Irish have chosen pubs.
Specifically, pubs selling Guiness. After all, it's
both delicious and it sports the harp from the
Irish coat of arms as its logo (just backwards).
As such, Irish pubs work like embassies for the
country/brewery, and, accordingly, stepping
into such a place means entering a space with
different laws. They are special spaces in
limbo, where foreign things are allowed to
flourish. Like NFL games, chicken wings and
beer by the pitcher. Also karaoke.
My Sunday night was full of all these things,
and by the time it was over, it felt like I'd final
ly been able to find and scratch an itch that had
eluded me for weeks. You never escape where
you come from, so an occasional reminder is
always welcome even if it comes to you in a
pub with no affiliation to your country.
But what if the reminder isn't occasional?
What if all that your time abroad amounts to
is a constant stream of finding ways to feel like
you never left America? It means you're wast
ing your time. Extending the simile above into
a metaphor, who wants to hang out with the
scabby loser who scratched too much?

You wouldn't be alone, though.
I greatly admire the abroad offerings that
Stanford has been able to assemble over the
years, and the time and money given by the
Bings to help with the process is remarkable.
What I do wonder is whether maybe, in our
rush to make these overseas campuses acces
sible and inviting, we as a university are losing
something of the point in studying abroad.
A night or two before my stop over at
George Payne's, I went out with a group of
Stanford students visiting from Madrid. It was
nice in a lot of respects I could talk about
which dorms I'd lived in, dining halls I'd fre
quented, who I hung out with at school and
people knew what I meant. I didn't even have
to spell the name of my a cappella group for
them to know to which one I was referring (I'll
admit, "Mendicant" is not a supremely com
mon word, so no surprise there). All of that
hadn't happened in a long while, but as much
as I enjoyed it, I was worried when I looked
around me as the gleaming film of a bubble
began to form.
How much do we really gain if all we do is
trasladar our Stanford experience to another
site, without changing anything about how we
act? Being abroad should force us to almost
drown in a new culture before we manage to
pull our heads above water and suck in some
air. The awkward, unpleasant moments, the
embarrassing misunderstandings (yeah, you
knew embarazada meant pregnant, not em
barrassed, but did you know preservative)
means condom, not, you know, preservative?),
the infuriating absence of the familiar, it's all
just the warts of a new place coming into view.
Airbrushing them out just makes it cheaper.
Plus, it leads to an unhealthy body image for
countries everywhere.
Before the hypocrite bell starts ringing,
dear reader, let me assure you that I know I am
no saint in this. Seeing my fellow classmates in
their non-native environs just made it all to
clear what I want to avoid what we should
all want to avoid. It isn't on the program, al fin
y al cabo, but on us.
