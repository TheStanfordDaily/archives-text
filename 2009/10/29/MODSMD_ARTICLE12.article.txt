# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Books and Other Things I Buy Into 
### Emily Hulme 
Here is a story you have already heard:

On the second day of August, 1939, a
certain Albert Einstein (perhaps you
have heard of him) composed a most
singular letter. I do not think it had prece
dent, but then again, this Einstein was a
shrewd fellow and might have suspected the
following years, too, would bring many un
precedented circumstances. Nazi Germany,
giddy from its recent conquest of Czechoslo
vakia, made a pact with the USSR and, in
short, started the Second World War.
A recent study published in Science says
people like Einstein tend to write a number
of letters in one setting in order to save time.
We might suppose, then, that he first wrote
his son or his stockbroker before writing the
President. Putting these letters aside, he
turned to urging Roosevelt to look into re
cent scientific results that could lead to a
weapon large enough to destroy not just a
man or a boat, but a whole city. He noted that
the Germans, indeed, already had begun
stockpiling Uranium. And so he signed the
letter, and maybe turned to write another to
the County Court of Long Island contesting
an undeserved parking ticket.
It was a month before Roosevelt read and
replied to the letter, and by now, a perilous
situation had turned deadly. Many commit
tees and many meetings followed. Research
filled long hours, and dull discoveries came
by the dozen. All this culminated in the end
of one war with two bombs and seemingly
infinite regret.
Six years prior, Einstein had emigrated
from Germany the very year a certain Mar
tin Heidegger publicly embraced Nazism. I
hope you will have heard of him as well, for
he was a very talented philosopher, quite
possibly the best of his whole generation, but
I suspect the philosophers' lobby is not quite
as well-funded as the physicists'. He and his
students were citizens of the state, and influ
ential ones at that. Their words about nation
alism and the future were not whispers mur
mured in the din of history, but cacophonous
shouts.

And yet Leon Wieseltier writes in The
New Republic that poets, philosophers and
historians have never caused crises, never
caused revolutions. In the words of Cher
Horowitz, "as if." Ever heard of Karl Marx?
But his point is not lost on me. Reporting

a common sense half-truth, The New York
Times declared "Those Impractical Human
ities Must Struggle To Justify Themselves In
Times of Economic Distress." As if dodging
an imaginary attack from predatory scien
tists decrying their frivolity, it is the usual
first move of any self-deprecating humani
ties apologist to admit his or her subject is
useless. This, by my lights, is a concession no
student at this university can or should
make. Here's why:
First of all, scientists don't think humani
ties subjects are full of 8.5., no matter what
your sleep-deprived pre-med roommate
might say when she finds an English major
leisurely reading Shakespeare while she's
memorizing the Calvin Cycle. Hardly any
major scientist has published a book on his
subject without mentioning literature or art.
On the back of "The Oxford Book of Mod
ern Science Writing," Richard Dawkins
refers to two crowning achievements of hu
mankind: science and literature. Scientists
don't study science since they don't appreci
ate art, literature or history, or even in spite
of appreciating these fields. They study sci
ence because they appreciate them.
Next, in the narrow definition of "practi
cal" as "immediately applicable to a career"
at universities like Stanford, or any Ivy
League school, or UCLA, or basically any
American university, frankly, not many un
dergraduate programs are especially "prac
tical." Theoretical physics isn't "practical."
Most of the sciences aren't taught here as
"practical" subjects in this sense; that's why
you go to graduate school for organic chem
istry, or medicine or what have you. That's
the point of going to a university rather than
a tech school. There is a very good reason sci
ence majors here don't take all hands-on lab
classes as an undergraduate, you are be
ginning to learn how scientists think, just as
humanities majors are learning how writers
or historians think. Thinking has never been
an easily "marketable" skill, but if you have
a problem with thinking as a subject, you
should be indicting a lot more fields that just
the humanities.

Finally, calling the humanities "useless"
in the sense of not causing things to happen
is just plain wrong. No matter how immedi
ately convenient, by distancing the humani
ties from responsibility for involvement in
nasty snarls (such as Heidegger with

Nazism), you give up the very reason the hu
manities are worth studying: the radical
good that can come out of these subjects.
They are a motivating power in the world,
and modern science itself is inconceivable
without the context of Enlightenment think
ing. The humanities are not harmless, and
they aren't relics we nostalgically keep
around from a previous age. They are power
ful, for better or for worse, and blindly pre
tending otherwise only ensures someone
else will get to decide which.
