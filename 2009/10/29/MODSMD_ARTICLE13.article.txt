To the editor:

Once again yesterday, I opened the Stan
ford Daily editorial page to find political car
toons purchased from a national wire service.
This time, two cartoons had been reprinted
from the fourth-tier Washington, D.C. news
paper The Examiner (a tabloid distributed
for free on the subways). One dealt with the
beleaguered coach of the Washington Red
skins, the other with the Virginia gubernato
rial race. As a native Washingtonian, I appre
ciated the subject matters even though the
cartoonist's humor was pretty weak. Howev
er, as a Stanford graduate student, I had a
hard time seeing the relevance of local con
tent rehashed from 3,000 miles away. Such is
the price of wire service subscriptions it
sure is easy to reprint someone else's work,
but your readers often end up scratching
their heads.

Many of our nation's great political car
toonists got their starts at college newspapers
most notably Gary Trudeau at the Yale
Daily News. Surely The Stanford Daily can
identify one or more talented students on
this campus to ink relevant political cartoons
and perhaps have a shot at a great and impor
tant line of work?
