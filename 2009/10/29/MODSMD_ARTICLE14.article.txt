## The 						lessons of an NBA life 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
I have reached a point in my life
where I truly believe that the
NBA is in level la of my basic
needs for survival, falling just
short of the upper echelon of eating
and breathing, and deadlocked with
water. The 2009-2010 season has just
kicked off, cementing the fact that
from now until June, I will be bliss
fully occupied, and my academic
performance will be legitimately en
dangered.
But to hell with grades, this may
be the tightest race for the title in re
cent memory! I could talk for at least
60 consecutive hours about all things
NBA including Zach Randolph's
body fat percentage, the over/under
on the amount of games missed by
Gilbert Arenas and the nine-year
implosion that is the Sacramento
Kings but to be honest, there's
just no need. This year, the battle for
league supremacy will unquestion
ably come down to five teams: the
Boston Celtics, the Cleveland Cava
liers and the Orlando Magic in the
East, and the San Antonio Spurs and
the Los Angeles Lakers in the West.
Every other team, aside from possi
bly Portland and Denver, has no
shot. Don't even kid yourselves,
Warriors fans. I could give your fran
chise a reincarnation of a young
Michael Jordan, unlimited cap space
and three wishes from a genie's
lamp, and you would still find away
to both be in and screw up
next year's draft lottery.
All five of the teams I mentioned,
despite having achieved a fairly de
cent amount of success in last year's
campaign, made very significant
moves in the offseason. Whether
these changes will have a consider
able impact on the layout of the
NBA hierarchy is yet to be deter
mined, but, using my somewhat
thorough and largely Orlando-bi
ased knowledge of the league, I have
a pretty good feeling about how this
season will unfold.
We'll start with the Spurs, a team
striving for two titles this year: The
Larry O'Brien Trophy and The Most
Abhorrent Team to Watch of the
2000s. This team is as intelligent and
experienced as it is boring. Tim Dun
can, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili
have the potential to play together
again, healthy, for the first time in
what seems like an eternity. The big
news this summer in San Antonio,
however, was that the team had
signed high-flying former Nets star
Richard Jefferson. He alone takes
this team from a probable middle
seed to the frontrunner for the two
seed behind the Lakers. However,
the potential for injury and the in
ability to matchup with Los Angeles
will eventually be too much for this
squad.

The Boston Celtics are another
team battling age and injury, as well
as offseason contract disputes and
overly optimistic expectations.
Kevin Garnett, Mr. Anything-Is-
Possible himself, is back from a sea
son-ending knee injury he fell victim
to last year, causing Boston fans to
once again make the hilarious argu
ment that he will play a vital role in
helping lead them back to glory. The
Celts also added Rasheed Wallace
and his posse of technical fouls to
the squad this year, along with very
dangerous combo guard Marquis
Daniels. The addition of Daniels is
very under-hyped, as he may now fill
the void of the best backup point
guard in the league. On the other
hand, Wallace, coming off the bench
behind Garnett and Kendrick
Perkins, will both provide a threat
from three-point range and increase
the mean age of the Celtics to 65.
Expectations for the Celtics are
high, but I see it as a near impossibil
ity for them to make it to the Finals,
unless they are competing in the
Cambridge Seniors League. Despite
beating the Cavs in the season open
er, look for Boston to finish third in
the East and then lose in the second
round of the playoffs.
To me, the Cleveland Cavaliers
are the biggest anomaly. After
Cleveland's astonishing 66-win sea
son last year, the Cavs did not let up
in their push for a title. In perhaps
the largest, and I mean this literally,
move of the offseason, Cleveland
signed Shaquille O'Neal in hopes of
fortifying a rather week frontline.
Cleveland fans were ecstatic, but I'm
not too quick to bite.
I watched the Cavs season open
er, and several times I needed my
roommates to remind me that it was
Shaq I was watching, and not an
obese version of the Pokemon Snor
lax. O'Neal will clog the lane with
what appears to be 400 pounds of
lard, stifling James' penetration. He
will be unable to defend against the
pick and roll that doomed Cleveland
in the Eastern Conference Finals,
and he is undeniably out of shape
and past his prime, limiting him to a
maximum of 20 to 25 minutes of
solid production per game.
I'd be a fool to deny MVP Le-
Bron James the recognition as one
of the best three basketball players
James, Jordan and Kobe Bryant
that I have ever seen. This team
will go as far as Le√üron goes, and in
the year before his highly anticipat
ed free agency, he's going to work
for his money. The Cavs are always a
threat, but will fall short in the East
ern Conference Finals.
In similar news regarding popu
lar teams to bandwagon, we have
reached the NBA Champion Los

Angeles Lakers. I was at game five
of last year's NBA Finals, and I
watched Kobe's emotional celebra
tion in front of my very eyes on the
floor of my favorite team. To be hon
est, I felt like he deserved it. He's the
greatest scorer I have ever wit
nessed. Period. The Lakers were the
complete team, as they comple
mented Bryant perfectly and used
their length and depth to dispose of
the Magic in five games.
This year, the team looks remark
ably similar, except for one minor
detail. Trevor Ariza was replaced
this offseason by global role model,
Ron Artest. When he's not dis
cussing the art of murder using bro
ken table legs, Artest participates in
other illustrious American pastimes
including physically abusing fans,
rapping and playing lockdown de
fense. Swapping Ariza for Artest
doesn't make a lot of sense to me, in
the sense that Ariza was starting to
turn into a high-quality role player,
while Artest has seen a significant
decline in his numbers and ability in
recent years. Nonetheless, the Lak
ers are just too good not to breeze
through the West, and with an al
most identical lineup to last year's
championship team, the Lakers will
cake walk to the Finals.
But they won't win.
That job belongs to the Orlando
Magic, a pick I'm sure no one ex
pected me to make. Please just try to
see past my blatant hometownism
and appreciate how deep this team
is. With the acquisitions of Brandon
Bass, Ryan Anderson, Matt Barnes
and White Chocolate, this team is 11
deep. Also, I should probably men
tion that the Magic acquired my
homeboy Vince Carter literally,
we both grew up in Daytona Beach,
Florida from the Nets in the off
season. When the news broke this
summer that Carter was returning to
the Motherland, I shrieked louder
thanTri-Delts at a midnight showing
of Paranormal Activity.
The starting lineup will now fea
ture four potential All-Stars in
Jameer Nelson, Carter, Rashard
Lewis and Dwight Howard. This
team will, amazingly, improve in
both defensive and offensive effi
ciency this year, and, with the addi
tion of more big bodies, will ab
solutely dominate the glass on both
ends.
It also appears as if the additions
of the Cavs may work to Orlando's
benefit. Although Shaq has merely
replaced another ogre known for his
inability to move in Zydrunas ll
gauskas, Shaq is still, amazingly,
slower. The Magic's pick and roll will
only be better now with Carter at
the helm, and Cleveland is in a world
of hurt with O'Neal on the floor. If
Cleveland and Orlando were to face
off in the Eastern Conference Finals
for a second consecutive year, it's
hard to imagine a result much differ
ent from the one we saw last season.
I love this team and am frighten

ingly biased. But, even from an ob
jective and statistical perspective,
the Magic are as good as any team in
the league. I'd like them to make a
return trip to the Finals and, this
time, come home with the hardware.
This sport has taken a serious hit
in recent years. The often-men
tioned Donaghy scandal has
brought years of speculation into
the authenticity of the game. I have
been skeptical, but have never lost
faith. The NBA is absolutely incred
ible and holds my attention better
than any other sport, collegiate or
professional.
I encourage all of you to join me
on the journey through June and
if you're looking for a ride, there's
always plenty of room on the Magic
bandwagon.

"/ don't always write about the NBA,
but when I do, I prefer obsessing about
the Magic," is Zach Zimmerman's
