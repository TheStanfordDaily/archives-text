## The
						lessons of an NBA life 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
I have reached a point in my life
where I truly believe that the
NBA is in level la of my basic
needs for survival, falling just
short of the upper echelon of eating
and breathing, and deadlocked with
water. The 2009-2010 season has just
kicked off, cementing the fact that
from now until June, I will be bliss
fully occupied, and my academic
performance will be legitimately en
dangered.
But to hell with grades, this may
be the tightest race for the title in re
cent memory! I could talk for at least
60 consecutive hours about all things
NBA including Zach Randolph's
body fat percentage, the over/under
on the amount of games missed by
Gilbert Arenas and the nine-year
implosion that is the Sacramento
Kings but to be honest, there's
just no need. This year, the battle for
league supremacy will unquestion
ably come down to five teams: the
Boston Celtics, the Cleveland Cava
liers and the Orlando Magic in the
East, and the San Antonio Spurs and
the Los Angeles Lakers in the West.
Every other team, aside from possi
bly Portland and Denver, has no
shot. Don't even kid yourselves,
Warriors fans. I could give your fran
chise a reincarnation of a young
Michael Jordan, unlimited cap space
and three wishes from a genie's
lamp, and you would still find away
to both be in and screw up
next year's draft lottery.
All five of the teams I mentioned,
despite having achieved a fairly de
cent amount of success in last year's
campaign, made very significant
moves in the offseason. Whether
these changes will have a consider
able impact on the layout of the
NBA hierarchy is yet to be deter
mined, but, using my somewhat
thorough and largely Orlando-bi
ased knowledge of the league, I have
a pretty good feeling about how this
season will unfold.
We'll start with the Spurs, a team
striving for two titles this year: The
Larry O'Brien Trophy and The Most
Abhorrent Team to Watch of the
2000s. This team is as intelligent and
experienced as it is boring. Tim Dun
can, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili
have the potential to play together
again, healthy, for the first time in
what seems like an eternity. The big
news this summer in San Antonio,
however, was that the team had
signed high-flying former Nets star
Richard Jefferson. He alone takes
this team from a probable middle
seed to the frontrunner for the two
seed behind the Lakers. However,
the potential for injury and the in
ability to matchup with Los Angeles
will eventually be too much for this
squad.
