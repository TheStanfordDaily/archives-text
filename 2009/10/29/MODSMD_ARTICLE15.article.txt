## Men's golf takes third in Isleworth Invitational 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's golf team
took third place by just two strokes in the
thrilling Isleworth Collegiate Invitational
this past weekend in Windemere, Fla. Just
in front of the Cardinal was No. 11 Florida
in second place and only five strokes
ahead of Florida sat the tournament
champion. No. 1 Oklahoma State. Round
ing out the top five were No. 26 Georgia at
29 over par and No. 16 Alabama at 32-
over.
"It came down to the final round," said
coach Conrad Ray. "We hung in there on
the back nine and it ended up being clos
er than we expected. The guys were a little
disappointed that they didn't place high
er, but overall it was a good week."
Junior Sihwan Kim was runner up by
just one stroke on the individual ladder.
Kim entered the final round tied for fifth
place but drained six birdies to threaten
the tournament individual winner, Bud
Cauley of Alabama.
"Sihwan has really been doing great
for us," Ray said. "He has been handling
his emotions well and has matured a lot.
As a result, he has been playing better and
is more confident on the green. He putted
really well to make up for both good and
bad shots this tournament."
"Hopefully all of this will continue for
Sihwan," Ray continued. "I am seeing
more and more of the Sihwan that we all
know and love coming back."
Fellow junior Steve Ziegler came in
19th with a seven-over for the tourna
ment. Ziegler dominated the first round
with a four-under 68, and his second
round score of 74 landed him in third after
the second round. Unfortunately, tough
winds and a difficult course contributed to
a high final round score of 81.
Just the opposite of Ziegler, sopho
more David Chung ended the tourna
ment strongly to land him in a tie for
29th. Chung steadily improved through
out each of the three rounds with a ten
over 82, a five-over 77 and finally a four
under 68.

Freshman Andrew Yun finished in a tie
for 33rd with a 12-over 228. After two
powerful rounds with scores of 71 and 75,
Yun began the final round in a tie for
ninth. The final round got to Yun, howev
er, and he ended with a single round score
of 10-over 82.
Last, but certainly not least, of the Car
dinal five was senior Jordan Cox. Cox had
a tough time with the difficult course and
conditions and finished in 72nd.
Each of the five Stanford golfers suf
fered at least one difficult round. The Isle
worth links are known as some of the
toughest holes in the U.S. Combining dif
ficult play with competition by some of
the top collegiate teams, the Cardinal had
their work cut out for them in this tourna
ment, but they held strong.
"The course was a little tough, but I
think that the guys dealt with it pretty
well," Ray said. "Florida has different
types of grass and tough winds that made
this tournament challenging. Each day
was a great test for us and I think that the
guys felt pretty good about how they com
peted."
With back-to-back second and third
place finishes, Stanford has built up pow
erful momentum heading into the final
event of the fall season, the CordeValle
Collegiate, The tournament is located
close to home for the Cardinal and the
team has a history of strong finishes each
year there. Ray was optimistic about how
his golfers will perform next week, and his
team shows a continuing improving trend.
"We always approach each even like a
prep for the NCAAsRay said. "I'd be
lying if I told you that we didn't expect to
win. The guys are competitive and expect
to do well. We are capable of better than
second and third place. We just need to
lower the high fourth and fifth scores.
Every time we tee it up, we should feel like
we're ready to win."
The Cardinal will show its true colors
in one week at the CordeValle in San
Martin, Calif, on November 9th.
