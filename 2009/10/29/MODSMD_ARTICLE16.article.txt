# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Hoping to sink Gaucho ambitions 
### CLAUDIA LOPEZ 
An invigorating game is in
store for this Saturday afternoon
as No. 3 Stanford men's water polo
plays No. 9 UCSB on Cardinal ter
ritory.
The UCSB Gauchos suffered
an 11-10 loss against No. 8 Long
Beach State on Saturday after
four grueling overtime periods.
Long Beach came out strong early
in the game with a 2-0 lead, but the
Card quickly bounced back, leav
ing Long Beach with a mere 5-4
lead by the end of the first period.
The match bounced back and
forth as the score became tied on
eight separate occasions with five

lead changes, but Long Beach
stole the show in the end.
UCSB will present Stanford
with challenges on both ends of
the pool this weekend, in the
forms of Gaucho junior goalie
Fraser Bunn and junior utility
player Milos Golic. Bunn blocked
a total of fourteen goals last week
end while Golic scored six times
throughout the game and even
racked up three consecutive goals.
Cardinal defense will need to neu
tralize the threat Golic poses if
they hope to increase their
chances of keeping the Gaucho
side of the scoreboard low.
In contrast to UCSB, Stanford
came out of last weekend strong,

defeating No. 14 Pacific on Friday.
Cardinal senior driver Draco
Wigo led Stanford to an early 3-0
lead by the first period, and con
tributed seven points to the team
overall. Because of his outstand
ing work last weekend, Wigo
earned the MPSF Mikasa Player
of the Week honor of the 2009 sea
son along with the Gauchos' Milos
Golic.
"Even though we beat Pacific
really [well], they still scored six
goals on us," Wigo said, who
outscored the entire Pacific team
by himself on Friday. "There's still
stuff like that that we can improve
on."
Yet despite the high Cardinal

score, Pacific scored five goals
during the third period, while
Stanford only notched two. Al
though Cardinal senior goalie
Jimmie Sandamn blocked a total
of eight goals this weekend, the
team needs to prevent UCSB
from establishing a lead this week
end.
"We need to keep up our de
fense," said sophomore 2-m Peter
Sefton.
Excitement runs high as the
Stanford men's team returns
home after last weekend's road
game, and the team seems opti
mistic and confident that they will
play strongly before a supportive
crowd.

"I think we will play pretty well
since it is a home game on the
weekend," Wigo said. "Usually we
always play well in that situation."
The stadium should be packed
with fans and the atmosphere will
be lively an encouraging sight
for the Cardinal team. Further
more, Saturday's game will be
Freshman Dorm Day, and free
prizes will be given out to the dorm
with the most attendees, an entice
ment sure to boost attendance.
With the Stanford record at 14-
1, the team expects to have some
great plays as the Cardinal at
tempts to justify their No. 3 status.
The match is this Saturday, Oc
tober 31st at noon at the Avery
Aquatic Center.
