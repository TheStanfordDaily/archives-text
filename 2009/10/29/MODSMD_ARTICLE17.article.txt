# OWNING THE TURF
## Sophomore star Delano Howell does it all 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When your coach compares you to Troy
Polamalu without a hint of levity, you must
be doing something right.
Like the Pittsburgh Steelers' Pro
Bowler, Stanford sophomore Delano
Howell is a fast and ferocious safety capa
ble of changing the dynamics of a game
with just one hit.
Take this Saturday's game against Ari
zona State. With Stanford leading 10-0 at
the beginning of the second quarter, the
Sun Devils' Jamal Miles ran into Cardinal
territory and appeared destined for a first
down and more when Howell delivered
one of the most bone-crushing hits of the
year. The ball popped out, Stanford recov
ered and the tone was set in a matchup
between two Ã¼ber-tough squads, the Cardi
nal was harder. Howell was awarded a
game ball largely because of that single
play.
"I saw an opportunity and I hit it," How
ell said. "I guess the ramification of it was a
fumble."

"That changed the momentum in that
game. It turned around the game on a lot of
levels," said coach Jim Harbaugh. "The hit,
the forced fumble, the turnover, it was a big
swing in momentum."
Howell's journey to his current position
starting strong safety and feared hitter
has not been ordinary. He entered Stan
ford as a running back, even though he
played both ways in high school. He ran
track and excelled there, too. During his
freshman year, he was a part of the running
back rotation and served in a variety of
roles he would line up in the backfield
or split out wide and was moved around so
often that he became a frustrating adver
sary for opposing defenses.
But from early on, the plan was to move
him to defense indeed, the Polamalu
comparison came during the winter and
by the time spring ball had wrapped up,
Howell had secured the starting job.

players like the rangy Polamalu
standing out as an exception. The
subsequent velocity he can generate
makes him an imposing force.
But beyond Howell's tendency
for the big hit is his general tackling
ability it is good without any
qualifiers, but given that he did not
play defense throughout his entire
freshman year, it is particularly no
table. When he missed time recently

with a quad injury, his absence in the
defensive backfield was perilously
noticeable. And it is, in part, surpris
ing when a player switches posi
tions and sides of the ball, teams
must usually account for a learning
curve, but so far, Howell has demon
strated no need for one. In fact, he
has become one of the most consis
tent players on the Cardinal de
fense.

"He's a sure tackier, a rough and
tough tackier," Harbaugh said.
That viciousness was also slightly
unpredictable. As a running back,
Howell was known more for his
speed and versatility than any bull

dozing ability, but on defense, he
thrives on contact.

"It's attack mode," Howell said.
"There's a bit of an identity there
for your defense when Delano is in
there," Harbaugh said.
While Howell has played some
offense this year his blocking on
a long Toby Gerhart touchdown run
demonstrated his persistence
there are no plans to move him back
on a more regular basis.
"I'm a safety now," he said. "I
wouldn't ask for anything else."
