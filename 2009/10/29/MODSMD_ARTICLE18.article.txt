## STORMING THE NORPAC Women secure No. 1 seed in West division 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
After a satisfying victory against
Cat this past Friday during Senior
Night, the Stanford women's field
hockey team reached No. 12 in the na
tion with a record of 13-2 and 5-1 in
NorPac.
The win assured the women the No.
1 seed in the West Division going into
the NorPac Championships in the next
few weeks. The championship matches
will take place on The Farm this year.
"I'm so excited and glad that Stan
ford is hosting the NorPac tourna
ment," said senior Midori Uehara.We
get a few more home games before the
NCAA tournament."
However, before the tournament,
the Cardinal will play a two-game road
trip, taking on No. 1 Maryland on Fri
day and No. 14 Louisville two days
later. Maryland will be a tough team to
face the team is currently undefeat
ed with a history-setting record of 17-0.
Terrapin senior goalkeeper Alicia
Grater should prove a threat to the
Cardinal, as she notched a career high
of 12 saves last week in a match against
No. 2 North Carolina. Grater was
named Co-ACC Player of the Week
following her exceptional perform
ance. The Stanford offense will have to
put forth its best performance in order
to score with Grater defending the
goal.
Cardinal freshman Becky Dru will
be a key player in this match, having al
ready asserted herself as an offensive
threat early in her collegiate career
with nine goals for the team. Midori
Uehara, who leads the team in goals
this season with 11, will join forces
with Dra and her other teammates
against the Terrapin defense.
Aside from this Friday's match, the
women have their eyes focused on the
NorPac Championships.
"We're looking to win the champi
onship by playing the two-touch hock
ey that has worked for us all season
and we also want to come together
and gel at this critical point," Uehara
said.
Having only suffered two losses
this season, one against Cal and one
against Penn State, the women have
gained an upper hand in terms of rep
utation and confidence. And what

happens if they face Penn State again?
"The only way we'll play Penn
State again would be in the NCAA
tournament," said senior Rachel
Bush. "We've been working hard to
make the changes [on things] that
kept us from winning earlier this sea
son, and if we have to play them again,
we'll be ready."
The women are set with their eyes
on the end result.
"Our goal is to win the champi
onship," said Head Coach Lesley
Irvine. "Our theme all season has
been to focus on each game and treat
it like it's our last. We respect the
teams in our conference and under
stand that the conference tournament
is a new opportunity for everybody.
That said, we are playing very well
right now [and] have great confidence
in our ability and high expectations
for ourselves."
The Stanford women's top per

formances have not gone unnoticed.
The team's efforts have been reward
ed with eight NorPac Player of the
Week honors in the 2009 season: hon
ors have gone to Dru, junior Jaimee
Erickson, freshman Kelsey Lloyd,
senior Rachel Mozenter, Uehara and
twice to sophomore goalie Alessan
dra Moss.
Additionally, the team has had an
opportunity to make a mark on the
west coast.This is an important step, as
the west normally is not as responsive
to field hockey as the east coast, where
the sport has been more greatly estab
lished over the years.
"I don't think our season will
change the face of field hockey on the
west coast," Bush said. "But I do think
it speaks greatness about our program
here at Stanford specifically."
