# Stanford punishes digital pirates
## Information Security Office cracks down on illegal downloading with new policies 
### JANE LEPHAM STAFF WRITER 
Located within the "File
sharing and copyright law" section
of the University's Residential
Computing (ResComp) Web site
are seven words that send a clear
message to student file-sharers:
"Stanford University policy also
forbids illegal file-sharing."
As the entertainment indus

try increasingly takes aim at college
students for illegal downloading, the

University administration continues to take
steps of its own to crack down on the
amount of non-traditional file-sharing on
campus.
The University began issuing fines of
$lOO, $5OO and $l,OOO for the first, second
and third respective violations of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in
September 2007, and it has since implement
ed further measures to deter students from
illegally downloading.
In July 2009, Stanford's Information
Security Office (ISO) announced a new
automated system for students to respond to

DMCA complaints, including a quiz and
subsequent automatic re-routing to an ISO
Web page if students do not respond to the
complaint in a timely manner.
"We've made some changes aside from
implementing a disconnection fee to make
it more painful for students in an effort to
prevent them from illegally downloading,"
said Associate Information Security Officer
Paul Keser.
"We got all these DMCA complaints,
and people who have gotten notices from
us have noticed that they're a lot more
automated. Students have to pass a quiz

before they're allowed back on the net
work. Hopefully, it educates them about a
thing or two and has more of an impact," he
continued.
The University is also legally required to
confirm that students are no longer in pos
session of or distributing the copyrighted
material, according to Keser.
"The quiz asks them to clean the
machine, and once they pass the test, they
can get back on the network," he said.
"We're just trying to get the message across


BECKY WRIGHT/The Stanford Daily

and do what we're required to by
law."

While official policies are a large
portion of the University's interac
tions with students on downloading
issues, the actions of companies that
sue Stanford students have had the
largest impact on some students.
According to Senior University
Counsel Lauren Schoenthaler, for sev
eral years, the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) had
a campaign in which they served many
pre-litigation demand letters, and
insisted on a receipt of thousands of
dollars in settlement.
"Around 50 Stanford IP users were
served demand letters under the pro
gram, and I estimate that Stanford stu
dents have collectively paid the RIAA
around $150,000 in the past couple of
years to avoid litigation," she said.
In terms of student reaction to
being sued by the RIAA,
Schoenthaler expressed that many of
the emotions she saw ranged from
fear to anger. "For many of the stu
dents, coming up with $3,000 to $4,000
was not something they could easily
do," she said. "For many, it was a living
nightmare."
Schoenthaler explained that the
University is obliged to follow certain
DMCA standards as an Internet
Service Provider (ISP) in order to
avoid being liable for any copyright
violations by Stanford Internet users.
For administrative reasons, students
who do not respond to DMCA com
plaints in a timely fashion, defined by
the University as 48 hours, face having
their Internet access disabled.
"New Internet privileges are not
granted until the student enters into a
contract with the University agreeing
to respect copyright and to indemnify
the University for any copyright viola
tions arising out of the student's use of
Stanford's ISP," Schoenthaler said in
an e-mail to The Daily.
Schoenthaler added that while stu
dents who do not respond to a DMCA
complaint in a timely manner may be
fined $lOO for the first complaint and
$5OO for a second complaint, "students
who receive a third complaint at
Stanford are referred to the Office of
Judicial Affairs for consideration of
discipline."
DMCA complaints, however, are
not the only action that copyright

holders can take against illegal down
loading. Aside from filing a DMCA
complaint, owners of copyrighted
materials can also file a civil lawsuit.
According to Schoenthaler, these are
generally filed as "Joe Doe" lawsuits
against the IP address; the ISP is then
served a subpoena to link the IP
address to the user who unlawfully
file-shared. She maintains, however,
that the process is confidential.
"Unless we are under a subpoena
to release a student's name, we do not
release the names of our students
back to the copyright holder who sent
the DMCA complaint," she said.
Keser echoed the same message of
confidentiality with regard to the con
tent of the illegally downloaded mate
rial.
"We don't look at what people are
downloading because we're a safe har
bor," he said. "Once we start looking,
however, the safe harbor is in jeop
ardy. The record companies are going
to want to see what the kids are down
loading and are going to go for the
University, which has deeper pockets.
They might try to sue us out of exis
tence."
Stanford has received a number of
subpoenas in recent years and,
according to Schoenthaler, has "com
plied with those legally issued."
Damages have been set by copyright
law, ranging from a low penalty of
$750 to a high of $150,000 for inten
tional violations. Schoenthaler point
ed out that even for a student
assessed the lowest penalty for shar
ing 100 songs illegally, they would still
be liable for $75,000.
Fortunately, the University's three
strikes policy against illegal download
ing seems to have had an effect in
reducing the number of violations.
While file-sharing still exists on cam
pus, the Senior University Counsel
indicated that the University has "a
low recidivism rate." Usually, receiving
just a single DMCA complaint is
enough to change students' file-shar
ing behavior.
Schoenthaler also believes that
legal free-access content, such as
Pandora and Hulu, will reduce the
number of illegal downloads.
"My sense is that file-sharing
should decrease in parallel to the
increase of free or low-cost access to
content on the Internet," she said. "I
watched an episode of Glee on Hulu
last night for free no need to break
the law to get good stuff."

In 2008, Congress passed the
Higher Education Opportunities Act,

which imposes three requirements
regarding file-sharing on universities
nationwide: An annual disclosure to
students describing copyright law and
campus policies related to violating
copyright law, a plan to "effectively
combat the unauthorized distribution
of copyrighted materials" by users of its
network, and a plan to "offer alterna
tives to illegal downloading."
According to Schoenthaler, the
annual Copyright Reminder issued to
students when they re-register their
computers on the Stanford network
each fall quarter satisfies the first
requirement. The University also
employs bandwidth shaping to limit
the amount of file-sharing that can
happen across the network, while the
ISO automatically sends out periodic
P2P Traffic Advisories to the top file
sharers on campus. The Copyright
Reminder and ResComp Web site also
direct students to legal music and
movie content available on the
Internet.

pre-litigation demand letters, and
insisted on a receipt of thousands of
dollars in settlement.
"Around 50 Stanford IP users were
served demand letters under the pro
gram, and I estimate that Stanford stu
dents have collectively paid the RIAA
around $150,000 in the past couple of
years to avoid litigation," she said.
In terms of student reaction to
being sued by the RIAA,
Schoenthaler expressed that many of
the emotions she saw ranged from
fear to anger. "For many of the stu
dents, coming up with $3,000 to $4,000
was not something they could easily
do," she said. "For many, it was a living
nightmare."
Schoenthaler explained that the
University is obliged to follow certain
DMCA standards as an Internet
Service Provider (ISP) in order to
avoid being liable for any copyright
violations by Stanford Internet users.
For administrative reasons, students
who do not respond to DMCA com
plaints in a timely fashion, defined by
the University as 48 hours, face having
their Internet access disabled.
"New Internet privileges are not
granted until the student enters into a
contract with the University agreeing
to respect copyright and to indemnify
the University for any copyright viola
tions arising out of the student's use of
Stanford's ISP," Schoenthaler said in
an e-mail to The Daily.
Schoenthaler added that while stu
dents who do not respond to a DMCA
complaint in a timely manner may be
fined $lOO for the first complaint and
$5OO for a second complaint, "students
who receive a third complaint at
Stanford are referred to the Office of
Judicial Affairs for consideration of
discipline."
DMCA complaints, however, are
not the only action that copyright

holders can take against illegal down
loading. Aside from filing a DMCA
complaint, owners of copyrighted
materials can also file a civil lawsuit.
According to Schoenthaler, these are
generally filed as "Joe Doe" lawsuits
against the IP address; the ISP is then
served a subpoena to link the IP
address to the user who unlawfully
file-shared. She maintains, however,
that the process is confidential.
"Unless we are under a subpoena
to release a student's name, we do not
release the names of our students
back to the copyright holder who sent
the DMCA complaint," she said.
Keser echoed the same message of
confidentiality with regard to the con
tent of the illegally downloaded mate
rial.
"We don't look at what people are
downloading because we're a safe har
bor," he said. "Once we start looking,
however, the safe harbor is in jeop
ardy. The record companies are going
to want to see what the kids are down
loading and are going to go for the
University, which has deeper pockets.
They might try to sue us out of exis
tence."
Stanford has received a number of
subpoenas in recent years and,
according to Schoenthaler, has "com
plied with those legally issued."
Damages have been set by copyright
law, ranging from a low penalty of
$750 to a high of $150,000 for inten
tional violations. Schoenthaler point
ed out that even for a student
assessed the lowest penalty for shar
ing 100 songs illegally, they would still
be liable for $75,000.
Fortunately, the University's three
strikes policy against illegal download
ing seems to have had an effect in
reducing the number of violations.
While file-sharing still exists on cam
pus, the Senior University Counsel
indicated that the University has "a
low recidivism rate." Usually, receiving
just a single DMCA complaint is
enough to change students' file-shar
ing behavior.
Schoenthaler also believes that
legal free-access content, such as
Pandora and Hulu, will reduce the
number of illegal downloads.
"My sense is that file-sharing
should decrease in parallel to the
increase of free or low-cost access to
content on the Internet," she said. "I
watched an episode of Glee on Hulu
last night for free no need to break
the law to get good stuff."

In 2008, Congress passed the
Higher Education Opportunities Act,

which imposes three requirements
regarding file-sharing on universities
nationwide: An annual disclosure to
students describing copyright law and
campus policies related to violating
copyright law, a plan to "effectively
combat the unauthorized distribution
of copyrighted materials" by users of its
network, and a plan to "offer alterna
tives to illegal downloading."
According to Schoenthaler, the
annual Copyright Reminder issued to
students when they re-register their
computers on the Stanford network
each fall quarter satisfies the first
requirement. The University also
employs bandwidth shaping to limit
the amount of file-sharing that can
happen across the network, while the
ISO automatically sends out periodic
P2P Traffic Advisories to the top file
sharers on campus. The Copyright
Reminder and ResComp Web site also
direct students to legal music and
movie content available on the
Internet.

Located within the "File
sharing and copyright law" section
of the University's Residential
Computing (ResComp) Web site
are seven words that send a clear
message to student file-sharers:
"Stanford University policy also
forbids illegal file-sharing."
As the entertainment indus

try increasingly takes aim at college
students for illegal downloading, the

University administration continues to take
steps of its own to crack down on the
amount of non-traditional file-sharing on
campus.
The University began issuing fines of
$lOO, $5OO and $l,OOO for the first, second
and third respective violations of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in
September 2007, and it has since implement
ed further measures to deter students from
illegally downloading.
In July 2009, Stanford's Information
Security Office (ISO) announced a new
automated system for students to respond to

DMCA complaints, including a quiz and
subsequent automatic re-routing to an ISO
Web page if students do not respond to the
complaint in a timely manner.
"We've made some changes aside from
implementing a disconnection fee to make
it more painful for students in an effort to
prevent them from illegally downloading,"
said Associate Information Security Officer
Paul Keser.
"We got all these DMCA complaints,
and people who have gotten notices from
us have noticed that they're a lot more
automated. Students have to pass a quiz

before they're allowed back on the net
work. Hopefully, it educates them about a
thing or two and has more of an impact," he
continued.
The University is also legally required to
confirm that students are no longer in pos
session of or distributing the copyrighted
material, according to Keser.
"The quiz asks them to clean the
machine, and once they pass the test, they
can get back on the network," he said.
"We're just trying to get the message across

and do what we're required to by
law."

While official policies are a large
portion of the University's interac
tions with students on downloading
issues, the actions of companies that
sue Stanford students have had the
largest impact on some students.
According to Senior University

eral years, the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) had
a campaign in which they served many
pre-litigation demand letters, and
insisted on a receipt of thousands of
dollars in settlement.
