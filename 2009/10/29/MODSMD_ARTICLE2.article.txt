## Information Security Office cracks down on illegal downloading with new policies

Located within the "File
sharing and copyright law" section
of the University's Residential
Computing (ResComp) Web site
are seven words that send a clear
message to student file-sharers:
"Stanford University policy also
forbids illegal file-sharing."
As the entertainment indus

try increasingly takes aim at college
students for illegal downloading, the

University administration continues to take
steps of its own to crack down on the
amount of non-traditional file-sharing on
campus.
The University began issuing fines of
$lOO, $5OO and $l,OOO for the first, second
and third respective violations of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in
September 2007, and it has since implement
ed further measures to deter students from
illegally downloading.
In July 2009, Stanford's Information
Security Office (ISO) announced a new
automated system for students to respond to

DMCA complaints, including a quiz and
subsequent automatic re-routing to an ISO
Web page if students do not respond to the
complaint in a timely manner.
"We've made some changes aside from
implementing a disconnection fee to make
it more painful for students in an effort to
prevent them from illegally downloading,"
said Associate Information Security Officer
Paul Keser.
"We got all these DMCA complaints,
and people who have gotten notices from
us have noticed that they're a lot more
automated. Students have to pass a quiz

before they're allowed back on the net
work. Hopefully, it educates them about a
thing or two and has more of an impact," he
continued.
The University is also legally required to
confirm that students are no longer in pos
session of or distributing the copyrighted
material, according to Keser.
"The quiz asks them to clean the
machine, and once they pass the test, they
can get back on the network," he said.
"We're just trying to get the message across
