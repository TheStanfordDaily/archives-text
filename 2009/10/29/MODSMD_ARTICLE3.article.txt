# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Artists, profs, evaluate arts education 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Performing artists are presented with a unique chal
lenge when teaching in an academic setting: They must
merge creativity and scholarship for their students while
still maintaining their own vision.
Such was the theme of the Wednesday evening
"Pedagogy of the Impressed" discussion, where panelists
explored the place of art in a university renowned for its
sciences.
"I think that teaching does have some danger for
practicing artists, not only a sense of interrupting the
work ... but also in the sense of their works are influ
enced by the heavy practice of teaching," said panelist,
painter and art and art history Prof. Xiaoze Xie.
Sponsored by the art and art history department, the
event brought together Xie, ballerina and dance lecturer
Muriel Maffre, visiting guest directors Lin Hixson and
Matthew Gouhlish and choreographer and guest lectur
er Ralph Lemon to discuss the shifting relationship
between academic and working artists.
Though at one point Xie referenced teaching as a
"cancer for artists' work," the assembled panelists gener
ally downplayed and blurred the division between aca
demic and artistic learning.
"I don't distinguish between theory and practice in
the sense that I think you can do theory on your feet and
practice while you're sitting down," Hixson said. She
compared the uncertainty and breakthrough in art with
the sense of discovery in mathematics.
Maffre further disabused the notion of art as imprac
tical and unstructured, likening herself to an artisan
rather than an artist.
"Ballet dancers are not artists in their own rights," she

said. "I feel like, as a teacher, what I'm giving them are
tools. Artisans are experts at using their tools that's
what I'm trying to achieve with the students."
Attendee and third year graduate student in drama
Virginia Preston was appreciative of the panelists' teach
ing styles in a setting that does not primarily foster artis
tic inspiration.
"The key kind of space that's creative is almost under
siege at the University," she said, referencing the rules
and constraints typically associated with institutions.
Preston supported the more fluid class structures used by
the teaching artists.
It was these sorts of regulations that Lemon liked to
challenge in his teaching pedagogy.
Using out-of-the-box methods at a previous teach
ing gig he has organized "drunk day" to spur new ideas
and now "grades" by watercolor drawing on students'
papers Lemon said he liked to push boundaries.
"For me, it's like, 'Where is that edge?'" he said.
A student of Lemon this quarter, Lili Hsu 'll has been
appreciative of this viewpoint. An engineer in dance

classes, Hsu highlights the juncture between scholarship
and art.
"It's the first year I've been able to take an arts class,"
she said. "It's been kind of fascinating in Ralph's class
physics has come up." A study of out-of-control dance
spurred a discussion of velocity and bodies in motion
during one class session.
While the discussion was billed as an in-depth look at
pedagogy, the actual event wavered from performance
piece to art exhibition to frank dialogue.
Gouhlish and Lemon, both guest lecturers at
Stanford, also expressed a positive astonishment at the
type of students in their classes.
"Wherever you turn there are very serious people
who are very good at what they do," Gouhlish said. "But
they are very relaxed at the same time."
Luke Wigren 'll agreed with his assessment of stu
dents: "I think the most resonating thing is this idea of
both rigor and relax in dealing with academics and art."
