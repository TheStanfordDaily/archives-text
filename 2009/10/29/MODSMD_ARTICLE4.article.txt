## Author wins $50k writing award Johnson recognized for 'fearless,' 'dazzling' work 
### CAROLINE CHEN 
Stanford lecturer Adam Johnson
was awarded the prestigious Whiting
Writer's Award Wednesday. The
$50,000 award, funded by the Mrs.
Giles Whiting Foundation, is awarded
annually to ten emerging American
writers in fiction, nonfiction, poetry
and plays.
Johnson, a senior lecturer in
English, is the author of the story col
lection "Emporium" and the novel
"Parasites Like Us", which won a
California Book Award. His fiction
has also appeared in Esquire,
Harper's Paris Review, Tin House
and Best American Short Stories.

The Whiting Award, currently in
its 25th year, praises Johnson as "fear
less" and "dazzling." Johnson joins
the ranks of other famous award-win
ners such as authors David Foster

Wallace (1987), Michael Cunningham
(1995) and one of his heroes, English
Prof. Tobias Wolff (1989).

The New York Times has
described Johnson's stories as "funny
sad-bizarre," and other reviews have
frequently called his work off-kilter
and absurd. But when asked about
this, Johnson responded by laughing.
"They seem normal to me,"
Johnson said.

Johnson went on to explain that he
writes about emotional absurdity
rather than situational absurdity. "I'm
not writing about a tornado throwing
someone 20 miles in a bathtub," he
said, "but that people are alone in a
world of six billion people ... that
seems absurd to me."

Johnson first discovered his pas
sion for creative writing in college. He
took his first creative writing class in
order to get an easy "A," but soon
realized that writing would be his
career.

"All the flaws people had always
pointed out in me that I was a day

dreamer, an exaggerator, a rubber
necker all combined to make
something that everyone said was
great, which was a short story," he
laughed.
However, Johnson believes he
made the right choice. Although a
career in writing is not the most lucra
tive of jobs, he said, "I would never
regret any time I spent writing."

Johnson came to Stanford as a
Stegner Fellow in 1999, and has been
teaching since 2001. When asked
about his teaching experience at
Stanford, Johnson was enthusiastic,
"Oh my gosh," he said, "The students
here are so bright, so creative, have so
much initiative."

Besides the students, Johnson also
had high praise for the English
Department.
"Stanford has the greatest creative
writing program in the world actu
ally, in the galaxy," Johnson said,
explaining that the Stegner

writing style. He joins the ranks of his hero, Tobias Wolff.
Fellowship program brings in a
steady stream of emerging young
writers, many of whom stay as teach
ers after they complete their two
year fellowship.
Other former Stegner fellows
who have taught at Stanford include
Wolff, ZZ Packer, Tom Kealey and
Stephen Elliot. Among the past win
ners of the Whiting Award, five have
been Stegner fellows.
Johnson is currently working on a
new novel, a love story set in North
Korea that he describes as "a North
Korean 'Casablanca.'" He is also
teaching The Graphic Novel in the
winter and Creative Nonfiction in
the spring.
When asked what he would do
with the $50,000 grant money,
Johnson responded with another
laugh.
"Am I supposed to say I'd buy a
bright green, pimped-out low
rider?" he asked. After a pause to
think, he finally said, "I'll use the
money to buy time to keep creating."
