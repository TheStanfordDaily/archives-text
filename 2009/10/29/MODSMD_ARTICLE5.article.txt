## Budget cuts affect faculty recruitment Financial constraints hinder hiring and faculty searches in select schools 
### VIVIANA ARCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Budget cuts will have an effect on faculty recruit
ment this year, but early indicators are emerging about
where new members will be welcomed.
The School of Humanities and Sciences (H&S) has
initiated about two dozen searches for new faculty,
according to H&S Dean Richard Sailer.
"They are scattered across the natural sciences,
humanities and social sciences, depending on need and
recent retirements," Sailer said.
The reduction of available spots has affected the
type of faculty members the University seeks to
acquire, with preference given at times to more expe
rienced scholars.
"The net result of fewer searches is simply that we
will be hiring fewer spectacular young faculty," said
Engineering Dean Jim Plummer.
The School of Engineering, according to Plummer,
"has been doing about half as many searches this year
as we have done historically."
Because of the decreased funds normally used to
aid the hiring process, schools have been forced to
come up with alternative methods to fund recruit
ment.
"Current searches are using billets that were not
frozen as part of our budget cuts last spring," Plummer
said. "The billets that were frozen will be refunded
over time through raising new endowed chairs."
For Engineering, once funding is in place to fund a
search, no exact position or type of academic discipline
is actively sought.
"We generally do broad area searches, not search
es in specific disciplines," Plummer said. "We hire the
best available person in searches, not someone fulfill
ing a specific need."
Other schools, like Education, were able to attain a
comfortable number of faculty members while strug
gling to manage budget cuts. Education is making five
hires.
"One is paid for with funds from an endowed
chair," said School of Education Dean Deborah
Stipek. "The other four are replacements of faculty
who have retired or left Stanford."
Yet the budget cuts also adversely affected the
search to fill two integral parts of the School of
Education.
"We did have to cancel one search and put on hold
another," Stipek said. "Both are in important areas of
international higher education and neuroscience and
education."
The School of Education's new faculty members
include H. Samy Alim, an addition to the Social
Sciences, Policy and Educational Practice (SSPEP)
program faculty and David Plank, executive director
of the Policy Analysis for California Education
(PACE) policy research center;
Additionally, Geoffrey Cohen will be joining the
Psychological Studies in Education (PSE) program
faculty as the James G. March Professor of
Organizational Studies in Education and Business.
Jelena Obradovic, a new PSE associate professor, and
Susan O'Hara, associate professor of the Curriculum
Studies and Teacher Education (CTE) program, will
also be joining the department.
