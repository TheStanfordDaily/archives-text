## WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE Aside from housing 6,000 undergrads, Stanford is also home to an abundance of critters

"As long as wildlife is not destructive and doesn't pose a
danger to humans, they can coexist," said Max Pineda, pest
control supervisor for Stanford's Grounds Maintenance
Department. "Bats and owls are great pest management
helpers. A bat can eat up to 1000 mosquitoes a night and
owls prey on gophers and ground squirrels that could dam
age lawns, plants and tree roots."
"Herons have also been spotted in open fields hunting
rodents, keeping the population under control," he
added.
The hunters and the hunted
abound on campus, this balanced
ecosystem means a healthy
population of small
birds, squirrels and a
few other creatures
live in and around
many student-popu-
lated areas. Most stu
dents seem to have no
problem with the small
animals they see daily
and in true Stanford form,
many try to utilize the cam
pus wildlife for their owi
purposes.
Roger Yang '13 was all
seriousness as he discussed
his plans to add a conver
sation piece to his
dorm room.

We all have those Ivy League friends who
brag about the imposing, Hogwarts
esque feel of their dining halls or various
stone buildings, but most of us never
expected Stanford campus to feel like
part of a Harry Potter book.
Still, sitting in Old Union courtyard at midnight and
watching three tawny owls screech and soar in and out of
the building's two side towers, backed by a glowing moon
and stars, one can't help but search for Hedwig and per
haps a few late-night broomstick riders. You can hear the
owls before seeing them — a Morse-code series of high
pitched screeches echo in the clear cold — followed by the
animals themselves, appearing one after another to glide in
tandem overhead, near-luminescent and almost other
worldly in their grace.
The courtyard is certainly a different world by day —
the bubbling fountain, evenly spaced palm trees and
Spanish-style architecture connote a gentrified space rela
tively free of nature's influence, beyond a twittering spar
row or two. But wildlife at Stanford is everywhere.
The water, vegetation and sheltered overhangs of places
like Old Union simply provide all the "creature comforts"
that draw animals in to share our environment.
Likewise, the temperate climate and plentiful open
spaces on campus that allow you to work on your tan in
February or hike the dish in October in your shorts also
make Stanford the ideal hangout for many indigenous
small creatures.
For the most part, the local fauna is harmless, even helpful.

/ "I want to trap a squirrel
for a pet," he said.
With elaborate plans for a bait
ed snare in the works, Yang seems
pretty invested in owning his own
piece of Stanford's wildlife.
"I didn't have any traditional pets growing
up," he explained. "What's the difference between
a squirrel and a kitten? A pet's a pet. I'd take good
care of it... I'd teach it to water ski!"
While the majority of campus wildlife is simply
harmless and a bit quirky — many east-coasters are
fascinated that Stanford has black squirrels as well
as grey — there are certainly downsides to being in
such close proximity to unpredictable wildlife. We're
closer to the foothills and a larger, wilder ecosystem
than we think, as evidenced by a young mountain
lion's foray into residential areas in Palo Alto in
2004. Although the animal didn't come onto cam
pus, it did pass an elementary school blocks away
down Embarcadero and eventually had to be shot
after it was found in the tree of a local family's yard.
Chris "Wisco" Wiscavage, manager of the Campus
Bike Shop, said one of his most memorable servic
ing jobs was for a student who had run over a rat
tlesnake while biking on campus.
"The snake was still caught in the wheel," he said.
"You could see its open mouth with the fangs and
everything."
Fortunately, the biggest common menaces on

campus right now seem to be raccoons. Many stu
dents have seen groups of them saunter across the
road by Lake Lag at night and, when asked about
animals on campus, can immediately respond with
stories about the tiny bandits.
"I'll be walking down the sidewalk and a raccoon
will just pop out next to me ... we saw four of them
together once, and now we just see them all the
time," said Daniel Towns '13. "It's creepy!"
Another student recalled almost crashing her
bike when a raccoon popped out of a sewer drain
and ran across her path.
Although students' aversion to the dumpster div
ing critters is understandable, they are little more
than traffic nuisances and average in size — compa
rable to a large black lab puppy. All in all, Stanford's
fiercest predators shouldn't have anyone living in
terror.
If anything, interactions with the Stanford wildlife
make the daily slog across campus a unique experi
ence, more meaningful or at least more interesting.
Every student has, in a way, a personal ownership of
this space and this place — a familiarity with the
raccoon seen on the way to LateNite and with the
daily antics of the squirrels. These animals connect
us for some brief moment to something outside
papers and midterms — they are a piece of the larg
er world that we might be grateful to have among us.
