/ I 1 he Road to Recovery" economics
panel addressed the state of the
-X. American economy this past Satur
day during Alumni Weekend. The economic
experts featured on the panel explored what
went wrong in the economic downturn as well
as the future steps that need to be taken. But a
few lurking potholes remain on the road to re
construction of the American economy.
Specifically, the discussion about economic re
covery here at Stanford needs to try to include
the human perspective of this downturn, in
stead of merely treating it in theoretical eco
nomic terms.
At what point does focusing on the theo
retical aspect of the economy lead to a failure
to see what is going on for the everyday
American? During the roundtable discus
sion, the conversation concerning joblessness
centered on rearranging our economy to re
build manufacturing in the high-tech market
as well as in green technology. These sweep
ing ideas, however, failed to adequately ad
dress the predicament of the millions of low
skilled, unemployed workers left behind in
the modern economy. A cycle of downturn,
one panelist stated, reallocates labor to create
a more efficient economy. But this realloca
tion is not simply a word to describe an eco
nomic process it is a word defined by the
millions who have lost their jobs and are los
ing hope as unemployment persists in spite of
claims of "recovery."
The humanity of this economic downturn is
easy to ignore because it is so hard to rational
ize and make tangible to those who are still
afloat. Economic theory of cycles and upturn
provides the silver lining to our economic
storms, but our conversation cannot ignore the
masses left in the dark in these trying times.
Yes, the roundtable panel detailed a key differ
ence between jobs and finances that jobs
are only created when necessary, whereas fi
nances depend on future predictions but
dealing with joblessness in the here and now is
of the utmost importance as well. When it
comes to the countless newly unemployed and
homeless struggling in America today, a whole
lot of theory about cycles and upturns matters
very little at the end of the day.
Even the supposed solutions offered by the
economic panel remained floating in the
realms of the abstract. The panel's assertion

that education could solve the problems of the
economy drew applause from the audience of
primarily Stanford alumni, but the question of
how the already deficit-ridden nation could
achieve greater education was left largely up in
the air. Easy remedies in the form of grant
ing foreign students visas, focusing on becom
ing global citizens, and investing knowledge
and resources into green technology were
put on the table, but at times appeared to be
more of a pat-on-the-back congratulations to
an audience of educated Americans. The fund
ing of such an education, especially in the state
of California, was bypassed for a discussion of
how we have better methods to measure stu
dent's and teacher's performance, without en
suring they have the ability to perform to their
highest potential. All the advice and advances
the world has to offer can be suggested, but
without funding will remain unimplemented
and simply a pile of suggestions. Education is
key to America's economic future, but its ur
gency is crippled by our nation's inability to
provide the necessary resources.
To be fair, President Obama's allocation of
$4.3 billion for the Race to the Top Fund for
states that aggressively pursue education re
form could help matters greatly in coming
years. But, as with many of the education-cen
tered solutions suggested as a means to recov
ery, the positive results of the Fund may not be
directly felt in the economy until a whole new
generation has graduated and entered the job
market.

The ideas and theories surveying the road
of recovery are necessary tools to fixing our
economy, but the work of recovery itself is the
missing implement. Criticism of the financial
sector's overconfidence, the importance of
using taxpayer dollars wisely, and the necessity
of rebuilding Americans' confidence in fi
nance are all necessary parts of reconstruction.
But engaging with the communities and peo
ple affected across the nation is critical to up
holding the well-being of the American public.
Theory should not be marginalized, but should
be complemented with a sense of shared hu
manity with those most affected by the down
turn. The economic disconnect between theo
ry and reality will only perpetuate economic
woe, but wedding the two together can allow
us to safely navigate the hurdles of an uncer
tain economic future.
