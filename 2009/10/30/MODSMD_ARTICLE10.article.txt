In attempt to open communica
tion between students and adminis
trators, the ASSU sponsored a Town
Hall meeting at the Black
Community Services Center on
Thursday evening to address student
questions about sustainability, hous
ing, dining and transportation.
According to ASSU President
David Gobaud 'OB M.S. 'lO, approxi
mately 40 students attended the
event. Administrator presentations
dominated the public statements at
the event, with most questions from
students addressed in person to
administrators over dinner or at the
town hall's later stages.

Each administrator in attendance
received a short segment of time to
explain his or her respective pro
gram, providing a tour of much of the
on-campus administration. Gobaud
said each presentation was guided by
student questions and concerns
raised on the Town Hall discussion
page of the ASSU Web site.
Manager of Sustainability
Programs Fahmida Ahmed began by
discussing Sustainable Stanford and
the Stanford Ecosystem.
"The vision for sustainability on
campus is to have a balanced
approach of infrastructural improve
ment, as well as an educational envi
ronment around sustainability
and together, that makes the culture

of sustainability," Ahmed said.
Senior Associate Vice Provost of
Residential and Dining Enterprises
(R&DE) Shirley Everett said the
mission, mantra and belief of R&DE
all referred back to her main point of
"students first."
"We want to make sure graduates
and undergraduates are living in
well-maintained facilities," Everett
said. "We have renovated 47 percent
of our graduate housing ... If you're
thinking about where your housing
dollars go, a big part of it goes to
improvements."
Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney elaborated
on Everett's statements as he out
lined the achievements and chal
lenges concerning housing and the
use of the housing dollars.
"Every penny we take in goes into
improving the housing system,"
Whitney said. "There's nothing else.
More than one-third of our budget
goes into paying those debts from
maintaining quality housing."
Whitney emphasized the impor
tance of on-campus housing as well.
He compared the off-campus rates to
on-campus rates to argue that the
University is providing a better deal,
since it includes the full package of
room and board, laundry, utilities,
furnishings and stable rates.
Executive Director of Dining Eric
Montell spoke briefly of Dining's
accomplishments, but mostly empha
sized student transparency.
"We're here to serve the needs of
students .. . based on their class
schedule, location and what is impor
tant to them. If there's any feedback,
we're welcome to that. We also have

a 'Let Us Know' feature on the Web
site," Montell said.

The last presentation came from
Director of Parking and
Transportation Services (P&TS)
Brodie Hamilton. He noted the
many initiatives that the University is
attempting in order to lower the
overall carbon footprint of the
school.
"Stanford is making great
progress in getting significant
increases in the use of alternative
transportation and reducing the
numbers of individuals commuting
alone in an automobile," Hamilton
said. "The level of University com
muters has dropped to the point
where the carbon dioxide generated
by those driving is now below the
1990 levels."
Students in attendance appeared
satisfied the evening's presentations.
"They had a lot of information
that is very useful about where our
dollars go," said Krystal St. Julien, a
second-year graduate student in bio
chemistry.
"I think that the ASSU did a great
job in gathering the important figures
to inform students about what's cur
rently available and what's about to
be accomplished and to educate the
student body about the issues around
campus," said Bryan Chen, a fourth
year graduate student in biology.
"It's good to see that Stanford is
conscious about sustainability," said
Brandon Skerda 'lO. "Integration of
administrators and students is vital to
University's wellbeing."
