## EDITORIAL Daylight Savings should raise sleep awareness 
### 
This weekend marks the end of Day
light Saving Time (DST), which means
that sleep or the lack thereof
will be on the minds of most students on cam
pus as they prepare for an additional 60 min
utes of rest. Time is a commodity most stu
dents feel they are in short supply of, espe
cially within a higher academic culture that
accepts, if not venerates, sleepless nights and
the exhausting side-effects they bring.
It is the opinion of the Editorial Board that
DST, as annual a routine as it is, offers a
unique opportunity for undergraduates and
graduates to reexamine the role of sleep in
their lives rather than simply adjust their
alarms. We advocate this not simply because
of the individual health benefits of prioritizing
sleep, but also based on the fact that, without
sufficient physical and mental rest, a student's
ability to remain a fully-engaged, healthy
member of society is thrown into jeopardy.
Most students at Stanford are committed
to engaging with their academics and activi
ties as much as they possibly can. To do so re
quires energy, sanity and undoubtedly a cer
tain level of mental alertness that sleep by its
very nature must provide. Despite this fact, it
still seems that the average student on cam
pus who spends the majority of his or her

waking day in class still operates well
below the minimum seven hours of nightly
sleep most medical institutions recommend.
The side effect of not sleeping goes beyond
the individual and jeopardizes the quality of
student performances, clubs, representative
groups and classes. The result is that lack of
sleep ceases to be an individual problem and
instead becomes a collective risk for the en
tire campus.

As undergraduates consider their futures
as contributing citizens, their willingness to
forsake a healthy sleep cycle is quite unset
tling. Work, just like school, will continue to
offer an opportunity to forgo sleep in the
name of efficiency or "productivity." Beyond
an inability to perform at optimum level,
sleep deprivation can physically place one at
considerable risk to other problems. Accord
ing to a 1990s psychological study published
in Canada, the Monday after spring Daylight
Savings Time in which we lose an hour of
sleep generally witnesses a 17 percent in
crease in traffic accidents. Though Stanford
has, in general, less traffic to worry about
than other areas, the "crashes" that most
often occur on campus as a result of a lack of
sleep are usually mental, emotional or physi
cal, and they are not to be taken lightly.
