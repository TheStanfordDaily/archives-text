# THE 						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## More Pantsuits in the Halls of Power 
### Shelley Gao 
My life philosophy centers on self-ini
tiative and individual responsibility.
Sometimes, however, greater forces
should intervene in the world. Three weeks
ago, I chastised women for failing to actively
participate in politics (The GAO Report:
Where are the Women?). Today, I offer you a
humble prescription for the problem.
Advancing women's leadership in the pub
lic sphere, particularly politics, has long been
neglected at Stanford. The Feminist Studies
program provides classes that examine gen
der inequality and an alternate interpretation
of traditional disciplines. But, there is only so
much you can learn from theory.
In terms of real world impact, several or
ganizations have explicitly articulated goals of
advancing women's interests. However, their
weakness is rooted in their broad, all-encom
passing mission to "helping women succeed."
The Women's Community Center is a gener
alist that tries hard, but covers way too much
everything from sexual assault awareness
to career counseling.
The women's honor society at Stanford,
the Cap and Gown, has the potential, but lacks
the will and womanpower to be a forceful
presence. The challenge lies in the fact that its
members' interests are too disparate. The at
tention and support that women seek to enter
academia is very different from women want
ing to run for Congress.
The only resource that really has an impact
is Stanford Women in Business (SWIB). It is
targeted and vigorous. Its active programming
agenda and frequent networking events are
actually useful for women intending to enter
corporate America.
Stanford women need a bold, innovative
and aggressive program that centralizes re
sources ranging from academic departments
to the Alumni Association to help women
move into positions of greater power and in
fluence, specifically in politics. Rather than
starting a new institution, it could be housed
under existing structures like the Haas Center
for Public Service. Its mission should be en
abling women to cultivate skills in leadership,
communication and decision-making through
simulation workshops, speaker series and
mentoring opportunities. The program should
focus on practical strategies that enable
women to participate and succeed in policy
formulation and public office.
We can look to other institutions for inspi
ration. For the most part of this week, I was in
Cambridge visiting Harvard. The Kennedy
School of Government's "Women and Pubic
Policy Program" (WAPPP) is an ideal model,
as it fulfils the gap in the gender discourse at
Stanford.

The WAPPP involves four areas, stretching
from the role of gender in negotiations in
management to post-conflict reconstruction.
The most interesting one that can be replicat-

Ed on campus is "gender and political oppor
tunity." This initiative encompasses "From
Harvard Square to the Oval Office," a project
that addresses the inequitable representation
of women in government. It effectively at
tacks the problem by training female students
in electoral strategies, thus increasing
women's success and participation in the
pipeline.
The state of women has been an issue of
late in national dialogue, TIME published a
cover story investigating "The State of the
American Woman" this week. A study headed
by Maria Shriver and The Center for Ameri
can Progress, titled "The Shriver Report: A
Woman's Nation Changes Everything," was
released earlier this month. It is a feel-good,
uplifting document. "For the first time in our
history, half of all U.S. workers are women ...
Mothers are the primary breadwinners or co
breadwinners in nearly two-thirds of Ameri
can families!" But it fails to acknowledge that
the top five categories of jobs in the U.S. are
not lawyers or doctors, but secretaries, regis
tered nurses, elementary and middle school
teachers, cashiers and retail salespersons.
The concluding claim: "What we heard
loud and clear is that the Battle Between the
Sexes is over." Hmm ... I don't think so.
Beneath the rosy depiction of "progress"
lies a disturbing reality. Women are still bat
tling a persisting wage gap, discrimination in
the workforce and domestic violence. You do
not have to be an expert to notice the glaring
inequality, particularly in politics.
While women comprise half of graduate
school students, and gained grounds in educa
tion and health policy fields, there is still an
enormous gap in representation in interna
tional security and foreign affairs indeed, a
problem overall in the higher echelons of
power and decision making hierarchy. De
spite all the cited individual examples of suc
cess, like the first female Speaker of the House
and the second female Secretary of State, the
overall picture is rather gloomy.
I hope this conversation has penetrated the
Stanford bubble. Institutional changes at the
University only occur as result of strong advo
cacy and lobbying efforts by stakeholders,
particularly the students. Despite a need for
University action, there has to be the demand
and pressure, I am frustrated by the compla
cency and lack of engagement by women at
Stanford. The first and most important step is
for Stanford women to demonstrate their
commitment to fostering female leadership in
politics.

Ladies, we need to expect more from our
selves, and our peers.

Shelley would be delightedto chat with some fel
low Cardinal ladies about greater political en
gagement. Contact Shelley at
