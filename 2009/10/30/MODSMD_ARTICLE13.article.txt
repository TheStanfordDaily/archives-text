## "My Living Will" 
### P.G. Mann 
Dear Reader,
Lately, my thoughts have been drifting
toward swine flu. I find this alarming,
since usually my thoughts drift toward
encephalitis, botulism and syphilitic brain
softening, in that order, right after I think
about what I want for lunch. What is this new
fear in my hypochondriac closet of illnesses?
It's making me nervous. Only a sick person
perhaps someone with encephalitis!
would add a new disease to his litany of imag
ined infections. Granted, swine flu seems an
upstart compared to a healthy neurodegen
erative disease. And it's so lowbrow. Even the
newspapers scrawl about it. But, then again,
the 1918 Spanish flu killed millions. And I
have always been drawn to anachronism ...
I'm sure this epidemic is nothing to worry
about, but just in case, I'm writing a living
will. Since you are the only person I trust, I
am designating you to execute it. In the event
of an emergency, please see to it that my
wishes are carried out. Thank you, even
though I despise you for staying alive and
healthy longer than me.
Yours,
P.G.

Dear Executor of My Living Will,
If you are reading this, then I am lying in a
hospital bed in a completely leguminous
state, no doubt stricken by one of the mal
adies I so feared. And you called me a
hypochondriac looks like I really did have
something to worry about. Just out of curios
ity, what was it that got me? It was that dent
ed can of lentils, wasn't it? Or maybe it was a
flesh-eating virus from riding the city bus? I
told you public transportation would be the
death of me. Well, whatever it was, I'm not
dead yet. I intend to drink up the dregs of life
still floating in my inert limbs. And you're
going to help me.
Did you ever see that movie "The Bucket
List"? I saw it on an airplane, and although I
was feeling a little panicked and congested
from all the microbes circling in those winged
germ labs, I found it poignant, although
poignancy is a common side effect of Dra-

mamine. And it got me thinking: Before it it's
too late, there are some things in life I want to
do. Why should I be cooped up in bed coma
tose when there's a whole world out there for
me (and my breathing machines) to explore?
Carpe diem!
First, I've always wanted to go water-ski
ing. Before I fell into a coma, I refrained out
of fear of pollutants. The Great Lakes
seemed like one giant network of bedpans. I
figured I might as well have gone swimming
in a toilet. But that was the old me. Now I
want you to take me to Cleveland, strap some
skies on my feet, tie me to a boat in Lake Erie
and let rip. Then I want to go swimming in a
toilet.

Next, I would like to write a novel. The
fancy kind where everyone talks about what

a thundering talent I am, makes excuses for
my fascist sympathies and infamous drinking
problem, and writes me bootlicking poems
on my birthday. First, put an eye-patch on me
and carve a deep gash in my cheek, some
thing that will leave a scar and give me an old
world literary mystique. Then, they say to
write what you know, so for a working title
I'm thinking "Portrait of the Artist as a
Drooling Vegetable," Of course, this will re
quire your help. I've devised an ingenious
system of communication, where every time
I twitch you start cycling through the alpha
bet and when I twitch again, you write down
whichever letter you're at. If I am not twitch
ing, feel free to jostle me, I think this is going
to be good.
Becoming a famous novelist has made me
realize how important family is. It's a seem
ingly trivial moment sitting around the
dinner table, sharing stories by the hearth,
sponging down my lifeless bedsore body
that really count. That's why I want you to
move me to my brother's home and see to it
that I enjoy three meals a day with them. His
wife Deb will see to my feeding and hygienic
upkeep. As is my want in my helpless state,
I'll have French toast for breakfast, a roast
for lunch and chile rellenos for dinner, all
piped down my food straw. See to it that Deb
stuffs the chile herself, daily, right after she
gives me my mid-morning undercarriage
scrub.
Every afternoon, the kids will tell me how
school was. For the sake of their education,
I'd like to make them legally obligated to an
swer in full paragraphs in proper Latin and
German. And on the weekends, my brother
won't have to go through the trouble of look
ing for someone to share his season tickets.
I'll gladly go to every game with him. That
should make up for his having been the fa
vorite son.
Thank you. This coma has given me a new
lease on life. My will is done.
P.S. Don't pull the plug!
