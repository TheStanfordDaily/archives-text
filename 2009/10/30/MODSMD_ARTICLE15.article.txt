## FINAL ROAD TRIP Stanford men's soccer heads to the road for the final time this season 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It is the last weekend on the road and the
last real chance for the Stanford men's soccer
team (9-4-1, 3-3-1 Pac-10) to secure the top
spot in the Pac-10 conference.
No. 21 Stanford is coming off a huge upset
of then-No. 2 UCLA this past Sunday, record
ing a 2-0 victory at home. The Cardinal will
now travel north to face Oregon State (6-5-2,
2-3-0 Pac-10) on Friday and Washington (4-5-
4,1-1-3 Pac-10) on Saturday.
Oregon State has had a solid, if unspectacu
lar, season. The Beavers are fifth in the six
team conference. Games this weekend against
Stanford and Cal are the last two home games
of the season for the Beavers, so they will try to
make use of this advantage before finishing
the season on the road.
"We find it a big motivating factor when a
team is hyped up to play us," said junior mid
fielder Dominique Yahyavi. "It gets us really
focused and excited to play them as well.
They're going to come in and make sure to
beat us, so it's a good challenge to see what we
can do."
The last time these two teams met, Stanford
won a competitive 1-0 shutout, one of only
three times Oregon State has been shutout this
season. Stanford was troubled by the Beavers'
star sophomore forward, Danny Mwanga, who
ranks third in the Pac-10 with 18 points.
"Mwanga is definitely a great player and it
will be a team effort to stop him," Yahyavi said.
"I think as long as we cover the space behind
us and put pressure on him to make sure he

doesn't get any open shots, we'll be fine,"
The Huskies, however, could prove to be a
trickier opponent. They just came off of a week
of rest and the last time the two teams met,
they ended up level after double overtime, fin
ishing in a 1-1 tie.

Washington needed the break after going
into overtime in three out of its past five
games. UW has played an extra 110 minutes in
six overtimes combined for the season. The
Huskies have fought hard, downing then-No. 5
California while it was on a hot streak and
fighting UCLA and Stanford to ties.
"We take it one game at a time," Yahyavi
said. "They're coming off a bye weekend so
they've just been focusing on us coming and
playing them."

The game may come down to a battle of
goalkeepers. The Huskies will be looking to
their strong keeper, redshirt senior Rylan
Hawkins, to keep them in this game. He is
ranked third in the Pac-10 in saves (50), saves
per game (3.85) and shutouts per game (0.31).
The Cardinal will expect another all
around game from senior keeper John Moore,
who made a career-high nine saves in the
UCLA game and recorded his sixth shutout of
