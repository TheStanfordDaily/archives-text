## Jeremy Green suspended indefinitely 
### â€“ By Wyndam Makowsky 
Sophomore shooting guard Jeremy
Green has been suspended indefinitely
from the men's basketball team for a viola
tion of team rules. Coach Johnny Dawkins
and his team, through Stanford Athletics,
declined to comment on the specific cause
for Green's punishment or a potential
timetable for his return.
However, late Thursday night the Palo
Alto Daily News reported that Green had
been arrested for suspicion of felony do
mestic violence over the weekend. He spent
a night in jail, but no charges have been filed.
It is unclear if the suspension was caused by
the arrest or not.
Green was expected to assume a start
ing role and be a primary scoring threat
for the Cardinal this season. He averaged
6.4 points per game last year off the
bench as a freshman, but came on strong
as Pac-10 competition progressed. His
greatest asset was his sharp shooting he
made a remarkable 45.6 percent of his
three-point attempts. He was subse
quently named to the conference's All-
Freshman Team.
Stanford basketball is no stranger to
suspensions. Brook Lopez was suspended

indefinitely at the beginning of the 2007-08
season, missing nine games in total. Will
Paul was ousted from the team at the end
of last year for academic purposes and will
not able to rejoin the team until spring
quarter at the earliest.
While Stanford deals with holes in the
front court, the team will rely on a combi
nation of freshman Gabriel Harris, sopho
more Jarrett Man, redshirt junior Da'Veed
Dildy and seniors Drew Shiller and Em
manuel Igbinosa to hold down the back
court and shooting guard in particular
in Green's absence. Shiller is expected to
start at point guard and Mann saw consid
erable time off the bench last year. Igbi
nosa, although limited in game action so
far in his career, has a reputation for his
hot hand. Dildy is known for his defense
and Harris, a touted point guard recruit, is
still largely an unknown commodity.
Green's suspension is yet another blow
to the Cardinal's young basketball squad.
Promising freshman forward Andy Brown
tore his ACL and will miss the year. Junior
Josh Owens, a starter at center for much of
last season, is injured and has been de
clared out for the foreseeable future.

Despite its issues, the Cardinal will
begin its season with an exhibition game
against Sonoma State on Nov. 6 at Maples
Pavilion.
