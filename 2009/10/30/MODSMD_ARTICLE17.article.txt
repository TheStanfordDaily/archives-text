### 
While the news of Jeremy Green's sus
pension continues to percolate, Stanford
basketball did receive some good news on
Thursday night: Forward Josh Huestis has
committed to the Cardinal. He is a part of
the ever-growing and impressive recruit
ing Class of 2010, which was ranked No. 11
before Huestis made his collegiate inten
tions known and may now crack the top 10
nationally.
Huestis, the 2009 Montana Gatorade
Player of the Year as a junior, has a three
star rating from Scout.com and is tabbed as
the No. 21 small forward in his class. Both
ESPN and Rivals.com label him as a power
forward, with the World Wide Leader giv
ing him a high grade of 90.
Huestis stands 6-foot-7, 210 pounds,
and became a national prospect after an
impressive summer of camps and tourna
ments. As a junior, he averaged a double
double with 16 points, 10 rebounds and
five blocks per game.

His final decision came down to Har
vard and Stanford. He is the Cardinal's
fifth commitment.
