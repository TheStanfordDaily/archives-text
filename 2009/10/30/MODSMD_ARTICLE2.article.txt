## Women look to clinch Pac-10 title 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal women, after earning wins in
both matches on their final road trip to Washing-
ton, will look to continue their perfect season t
against the Arizona schools in their final two-game
homestand this weekend. With a sweep of both teams,
Stanford would clinch at least a share of its first Pac-10
title since 2002.
At first glance, one might think that the unranked
duo of Arizona State (7-5-3,0-4-1 Pac-10) and Arizona
(4-11-1,1-4) might be no match for the No. 1 Cardinal,
which comes in riding an incredible 19-game regular
season winning streak. Indeed, the Sun Devils' and
Wildcats' combined win total in conference play stands
at just one and that victory, earned by Arizona,
came in a intrastate contest that all but necessitated a
win for one school or the other.
As he usually does, Stanford Head Coach Paul Rat
cliffe remained stoic and determined, no matter how
his upcoming opponents have been faring lately. He in
sisted that Stanford (17-0,6-0) can't underestimate any
team, regardless of its record.
"We've got to make sure we're not complacent
they're strong teams, the Pac-10 is very strong," Rat
cliffe said. "So, we have to come to play and really earn
a victory. There are no freebies in this confer

Ratcliffe's words, even to the casual
fan, are in no way unfounded. Friday's
opponent, Arizona State, has yet to
win a Pac-10 match this season, but i
has been only one goal behind in
every loss, with two defeats coming in \
the second overtime. Arizona is no
pushover either, and after earning their
first victory after Dan Tobias quit as head
coach last weekend, the Wildcats have plei

ty to prove.
"I don't know a great deal about their squads this
year, but I'm sure they'll both be tough, physical
games," Ratcliffe said. "But I also know they have
some good players. I think they'll be difficult games
and I'm not taking them lightly. Who knows, they could
