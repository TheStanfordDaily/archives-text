## Women look to clinch Pac-10 title 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal women, after earning wins in
both matches on their final road trip to Washing-
ton, will look to continue their perfect season t
against the Arizona schools in their final two-game
homestand this weekend. With a sweep of both teams,
Stanford would clinch at least a share of its first Pac-10
title since 2002.
At first glance, one might think that the unranked
duo of Arizona State (7-5-3,0-4-1 Pac-10) and Arizona
(4-11-1,1-4) might be no match for the No. 1 Cardinal,
which comes in riding an incredible 19-game regular
season winning streak. Indeed, the Sun Devils' and
Wildcats' combined win total in conference play stands
at just one and that victory, earned by Arizona,
came in a intrastate contest that all but necessitated a
win for one school or the other.
As he usually does, Stanford Head Coach Paul Rat
cliffe remained stoic and determined, no matter how
his upcoming opponents have been faring lately. He in
sisted that Stanford (17-0,6-0) can't underestimate any
team, regardless of its record.
"We've got to make sure we're not complacent
they're strong teams, the Pac-10 is very strong," Rat
cliffe said. "So, we have to come to play and really earn
a victory. There are no freebies in this confer
ence."

Ratcliffe's words, even to the casual
fan, are in no way unfounded. Friday's
opponent, Arizona State, has yet to
win a Pac-10 match this season, but i
has been only one goal behind in
every loss, with two defeats coming in \
the second overtime. Arizona is no
pushover either, and after earning their
first victory after Dan Tobias quit as head
coach last weekend, the Wildcats have plei

ty to prove.
"I don't know a great deal about their squads this
year, but I'm sure they'll both be tough, physical
games," Ratcliffe said. "But I also know they have
some good players. I think they'll be difficult games
and I'm not taking them lightly. Who knows, they could

be getting hot right now, so we have to be ready."
As the season winds down, the Cardinal is play
ing with plenty on the line. If Stanford manages to
continue its dominance this weekend with a pair of
victories, it would earn at least a tie for the Pac-10
championship.
"Being this close [to a conference title] shows all
the work we've put in this year, and we want to make
sure we continue the hard work and get good
enough results this weekend to clinch some of that
title," Ratcliffe said.
Senior forward Kelley O'Hara, currently leading
the team in goals with 19, which is good enough for
a first-place tie in the national standings, is also
eager to win her first conference title since joining
the team in 2006. Even still, she knows her team's
work may not be finished even with a sweep this
weekend.
"Winning a Pac-10 title would be amazing,"
O'Hara said. "It was a goal of the team going into
this year, so to be able to accomplish something we
set for ourselves to achieve since the beginning
would be great for the team and really start us off on
the right foot going into tournament play. But we
don't want to share the title we want to win it out
right, so we'll be looking to finish that against Cal."
O'Hara has another achievement in her sights
this weekend as well, and this one is a bit more per
sonal than a conference title. Her next goal would tie
Sarah Rafanelli's 1993 mark of 20 for the most goals
ever by a Cardinal player in a single season. Despite
the understandable pressure that such a tremen
dous record might place on a player, O'Hara insists
it won't get to her head in the final three games.
"It would be an honor to break a record that has
been around for such a long time, but it will not af
fect the way I approach the games," O'Hara said.
Ratcliffe, who has enjoyed coaching the dynamic
O'Hara for four seasons now, is thrilled with her
proximity to a top-tier offensive record.
"Kelley O'Hara is a tremendous player, and she
deserves all the success that she's having," Ratcliffe
reflected. "She's terrific, and I think she has a chance
to break the record. I certainly hope she can. She's
an inspiration to the entire team and a great leader."
Stanford begins the final stretch of its quest for a
Pac-10 title and a perfect season this Friday at
7 p.m. against Arizona State. It then takes on Ari
zona at 1 p.m. on Sunday. Both games will be played
at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
