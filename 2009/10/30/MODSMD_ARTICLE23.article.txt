It's that time of year again time to carve your pumpkin, pull out the scary movies and most importantly, choose your slutty costume. I know it's cliche to
talk about how trashy everyone gets around Halloween, but let's face it: It's true. Last year, I saw more French maids and Playboy bunnies than I could
count. This year, not only will we see the traditional salacious garb, but also there will be a whole slew of costumes that people inaccurately regard as creative.
I'm talking about Quailman, Rubik's cubes and the Joker . . . they are fun, but overdone. We at Intermission are here to warn you of this year's passe costumes to
look out for. If you want to stand out this year at Halloween, don't be any of these:
Vampires
Vampires are undeniably this year's biggest craze. With the overwhelming popularity of the "Twilight" series, vampires are bound to be everywhere
this Halloween. I'm not talking about scary, fanged Transylvanian Dracula. I'm talking about Edward Cullen-esque vampires (I swear, I don't read the
books), the glittery ones that all the ladies are drooling over.

"Where the Wild Things Are" fared extremely well at the box office and landed itself as the hippest movie of the year. Although I understand the
appeal of slipping into a feline footsy and crown, beware that this costume is going to be a popular one. On the flipside, if you don't care about being
unique, being Max is the perfect excuse to act a tad wild this Halloween.
. Lady Gaga

Don her poker face this Halloween and you'll definitely blend in with the crowd. Males and females alike are going to flock to this costume,
as it will allow individuals to simply look crazy I'm pretty sure she wore something like roadkill as an accessory at the VMAs.
«. Kate Gosselin
"Jon & Kate Plus 8" is no longer, but rumor has it that Kate Gosselin wigs have been flying off the shelves. Apparently, viewers miss their dosage
of the sextuplet saga and are channeling Kate to relieve the separation. Either that, or her hair-don't is iust too good to pass up.
