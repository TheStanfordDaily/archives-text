# WE JUST CAN'T HOP LOVING HIM: "THIS IS IT" A FITTING TRIBUTE FOR THE KING OF POP

Walking into the
movie theater, we
saw a group of
about five performers, fully
zombie-fied, music blasting
and intensely dancing the
famous moves to "Thriller." I
wasn't surprised.
Unless you spent your

summer in outer space (and
even then I wouldn't believe
it), you've probably heard
that on June 25, 2009,
Michael Jackson, the King
of Pop, passed away.

Whether you personally like
Michael Jackson's music or
not, he was undeniably a tal
ented artist and performer.
Obviously he did something
right, given that he has fans
literally all over the world
and that his sixth studio
album, "Thriller," is the best-

selling album of all time
duh.
MJ was posed to
make a comeback, as he had
scheduled a 50-show concert
series planned to open in

2009 at the 02 Arena in
London. After his death, Sony
Pictures edited hours of
footage from MJ's rehearsals
of the tour to create "This Is
It," directed by Kenny
Ortega, as a tribute to the late
performer and, let's face it,
one more outlet to make

some money. Although, the
quality of the filmmaking
itself is subpar, this flaw can
be overlooked because of the
message it portrays the
King of Pop may have died,

but his music and memory
will live on forever.
The movie is format
ted in away that gives the
audience a chance to view the
concert as it was supposed to
be performed. Arguably, this
movie is the next best thing
besides the actual concert. We

get a glimpse of Michael per
forming about 10 of his most
popular songs, such as "Billie
Jean," "Beat It," "Bad" and
"Man in the Mirror." While
Michael was definitely not as
young as he used to be, he
can still sing and he most cer
tainly still has the moves. His
ability to perform has not
waned in the slightest and
keep in mind, these were just
rehearsals. His death is unfor
tunate for many reasons, one
of which being that his
legions of fans will never
have the chance to really see
his final masterpiece.
Michael was not just
planning a performance, he
was planning an experience,
and this vision showed. The
concert, though a work in
progress, appeared to have
many intense and creative
elements. The film does well
portraying Michael as a very
hands-on performer. Although
he had experts there to guide
him, Michael was ultimately
the artist and he had the final
say. There were numerous
times in the film in which MJ
would give his creative input,
would begin to dance and
sing and then those around
him would nod their heads,
clearly not entirely under
standing, but nonetheless
agreeing with whatever
Michael wanted. Although
MJ had these zany moments,
surprisingly he did not
behave as strangely as I
expected. He seemed very
focused, dedicated and

adamant on making the per
formance enjoyable for all of
his fans.
The film also showed
several interviews of the peo
ple working with Michael to
create the tour. They not only
had extremely complimentary
things to say, but also you
could tell that they were
speaking genuinely. The
dancers, musicians, techni
cians and even the producers
were Michael Jackson fans
just like all the people who
bought his albums, purchased
concert tickets and sadly
mourned his death. The film
is enjoyable for one sole,
powerful reason: Michael.
His passion for music is con
tagious and this infectious
nature shows. Numerous peo
ple in the theatre were clap
ping, dancing, singing and
screaming for Michael. This
untraditional lack of theater
etiquette didn't bother me. It
felt just right and the way
Michael would have wanted
it.
