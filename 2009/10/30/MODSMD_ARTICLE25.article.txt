# Therapy: Couldn't all Stanford students use a little?

This week's quest for
cheap eats didn't lead
us far from the red
tiled roofs of John Arrillaga's
testing ground for new archi
tectural plans. We headed
down California Ave. to the
homey exterior of Antonio's
Nut House, one of those
establishments that Stanford
students often ogle at, but sel
dom frequent. The Nut House
embodies dive bar eccentrici
ty both inside and out it's
decorated by celebrating beer
as "helping ugly people have
sex since 1862," an inexplica

ble, life-sized animatronics
gorilla in one corner, and
mounds of used peanut shells
littering the floor. Therapy is
nestled in a corner of the Nut
House, separate from the high
bar tables and big screen TVs
blaring ESPN; yet the restau
rant is deeply molded by its
environment, adopting the
same laid back and eclectic
feeling. Therapy has only
been open since September,
but the funky banquettes and
sizzling grill feel like part of
the fabric of Palo Alto bar
culture.

While the restaurant
integrates itself perfectly into
its surroundings, the food is
anything but the drab bar fare
one might expect. We asked
the owner, a cheerful man
named Josh Mattson, to bring
us the most popular items on
the menu and he didn't disap
point. First arrived an order
of piping hot, heavily bat
tered onion rings. The rings
were crunchy, but not brittle,
giving way to the coarse,
doughy interior of the coating
and the onion within. We
greedily dipped them in

ketchup and fought over the
last one. Next came buffalo
wings, drenched in a subtly
spicy and delightfully fatten
ing sauce that ended up all
over our hands, faces and
clothes ( nota bene : Bring
your Tide to Go pen!). And
then could we eat any
more? an order of Kobe
beef sliders. The meat was a
little overdone for our taste,
but the concept was solid
just like the mini-burgers of
youth, but made with fresh,
high-quality ingredients.
After that, at which point our
stomachs were begging us to
stop, a Philadelphia cheese
steak. It was meaty, cheesy,
bell peppery and everything a
cheese steak should be.
But the real tour de
force was the pulled pork
quesadilla. We were so com
pletely full that it would have
taken a lot to rouse us from
the food coma setting in, but
roused we were! The que
sadilla was absolutely divine.
The cheese was gooey, the
tortilla was crisp and piping
hot, and the pork was out of
this world. It was tender,
moist and flavorful, and when
one of our dining companions
bit in, she simply exclaimed,
"This makes me so happy!"
We may have squabbled over
the last onion ring, but we
absolutely brawled over who
got to finish the quesadilla.

We told the owner we
simply couldn't keep eating.
We begged him not to feed us
more. And then he brought
out the flourless Chocolate
torte. It was incredible. And
this high praise comes from a
group of diners who have
eaten many, many flourless
chocolate tortes during
Passover. The owner
explained that his mother
makes them, a charming fact
about a dessert that more than
stood on its own. Only
crumbs remained on the plate
three minutes later. We con
sidered ordering more to take
home, it was that good.
Therapy in Antonio's
Nut House may be new to the
Palo Alto restaurant scene,
but it already has a primo
place in our hearts (and stom
achs). And don't be deterred

by its bar location minors
are more than welcome to
chow down. It would be the
perfect place to catch a World
Series game, goof off with
friends or just pig out on bar
food that is so much more
than simple bar food.
