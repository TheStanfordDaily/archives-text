# NEW MOON, NEW TUNES

Teenage vampire falls in
love with hormonal
girl. Teenage vampire
then decides he can't be with
her. Girl becomes depressed,
but finds solace in a growing
friendship with a werewolf.
Vampire boy returns after
some harrowing plot develop
ment to hormonal girl and
claims it's impossible for
them to be apart.
Forgive the oversim
plification of the Twilight
Saga's "New Moon," but how
a plot like this could captivate
the majority of the female
population under the age of
25 is beyond basic reason. It
just doesn't make sense.
From the de facto, story-driv
ing conflicts to Kristen
Stewart's lip biting, it just
feels so forced.
So it probably makes
sense that the filmmakers cre
ated an equally-forced, equal
ly-puzzling soundtrack. At
least they were consistent?
Perhaps what's most
mystifying was the choice to

move away from the angsty
pop-punk of 2008 film
"Twlight," highlighted by the
theme from Paramore in
favor of the more mature,
adult attraction of indie rock.
The New Moon soundtrack is
loaded with the flagship
names of indie from Thorn
Yorke to Bon Iver, who all
wrote and performed original
songs for the album.
But for music defined
by the alternative it provides
to the mainstream, there sim
ply is nothing original about
the music, which further suf
fers due to the fact that it's
tied to a teenage vampire
flick. Not to mention the fact
that almost every track has
been molded to include some
vague blood-sucking refer
ence or mention of lunar
activity.
Take The Killers con
tribution, "A White Demon
Love Song," as a prime
example. In it, lead singer
Brandon Flowers provides a
subdued performance, monot-

onously repeating
lyrics about a white
demon (Edward
Cullen, perhaps?)
as the band builds
up to a sterile
crescendo of a 10-
second guitar solo.
Also disappointing
were Ok Go's
"Shooting the
Moon" and Editors'
"No Sound but the
Wind," an over-the
top attempt at
developing at the
stereotypical croon
er-on-the-piano
love song.
Seriously, guys, that
niche has been long
occupied by Randy
Newman, try again.

Turning to
the more subdued tracks of
the "New Moon" OST, we
find the five-minute Bon Iver
and St. Vincent collaboration
"Roslyn." While it's an inter
esting honest attempt to fuse
the unique styles of both
artists, it simply results in the
indie folk equivalent of back
ground music. The same goes
for Lykke Li's whiney, unin
spiring "Possibility."
Coming out relatively
unscathed however were
Grizzly Bear, whose "Slow
Life" was one of the bright
spots on the track. On it, the
band's style was relatively
unchanged and their ethereal
vocal rounds were well bal
anced by the soothing female
presence of Beach House
singer Victoria Legrand.
Muse were up to their usual
antics as well, despite having
to cut three minutes from
their song, with the power
guitar riffs of their "I Belong
to You." The song provided a
needed change of pace and
was welcomed among a
soundtrack crammed with
soft, acoustic tracks.
As for the heavy hit
ters, Death Cab for Cutie pro
vided theme song "Meet Me
on the Equinox," which for
the most part is a decent track
given the very little thematic
content the band had to work

with. There's nothing subtle
about the song from its trans
fixing rhythm guitar layer to
Ben Gibbard's chorus of
"Everything, everything
ends."
Thorn Yorke's
"Hearing Damage" is another
respectable track with
Radiohead's lead singer up to
his usual synth rock, but it
doesn't really fit in terms
with the rest of the OST. In
fact, not many of the songs fit
when you think about it. With
the soundtrack, filmmakers
forgot that their movie works
best with heartbroken teens or
at least young adults wonder

ing where the charming vam
pires were when they were in
high school. This isn't an
audience looking to grow up.
In fact, it's quite the opposite,
one looking to rekindle the
fantasies of youth. Give them
Robert Pattinson and
Paramore and leave indie out
of the equation. The hordes of
"teenage" girls will thank
you.
