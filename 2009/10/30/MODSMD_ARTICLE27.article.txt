Weezer absolutely
tore up the stage
Wednesday night
when they played a free
secret show at the Regency
Ballroom. Yes, that's right - it
was free and it was in a tiny
1,200-person venue. This is
not the typical arena rock
venue for the band, some
thing that the lead singer,

Rivers Cuomo, pointed out
early in the show before
jumping up and down on a
trampoline. The group has
certainly come a long way
from the nerdy, awkward per
formances of the early '9os.
The opening act for
the performance was a band
called Natalie Portman's
Shaved Head. While they had

some decent songs and per
formed them with aplomb,
this was not their show. Soon
enough, the audience got
what they wanted and Weezer
took the stage in matching
white tracksuits. This was
definitely one of the most
appreciative crowds I have
ever seen. With every single
song, there was a huge roar
of delight and vocals chanted
back to the stage.
The set began with
"Hash Pipe" and the hits kept
coming over the course of
their 20-song set. They wisely
chose to highlight their old
numbers as well as the new
songs. They intermixed
"Beverly Hills" with "My
Name Is Jonas" and "Surf
Wax America" with songs
like "Troublemaker." The
best part is that without the
studio mixing, the songs all
blend together very well
without any jarring shifts

from "Old Weezer" to "New
Weezer."
The same held true for
their new album, "Raditude."
Probably the best song off of
the album is the hit single, "If
You're Wondering If I Want
You To (I Want You To)."
While the title is a mouthful,
the music got the crowd
dancing and screaming along
with everything else that the
band did. They played two
other songs off of their new
CD, which didn't stand out as
much, but that's probably
because the audience didn't
yet know the words. It offers
a very different experience
when the singer is the only
one actually singing the song.
Cuomo has definitely
taken up a role as a formida
ble leading man. He was rac
ing all over the stage and had
the audience in the palms of
his hands. With just a few
notes of "Say It Ain't So," the

crowd was screaming their
heads off. He also made great
use of props onstage. For one
song, he brought out a mini
ukulele; but instead of play
ing it, he smashed it on the
ground and tossed it into the
crowd. He was so energetic
with his motions that with a
toss, he snapped the base of
his microphone stand clean

off. While the stagehands
probably hated it, the audi
ence ate it up and gave as
much as they had.
