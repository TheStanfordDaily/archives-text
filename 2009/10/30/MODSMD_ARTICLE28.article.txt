# Remote Nomad: Life after Hulu

The Hulu homepage reads: "Watch your favorites.
Anytime. For free." In 2010, the most famous and most
legal video hosting Web site will lose one-third of its
motto. Chase Carey, deputy chairman of News Corporation,
the company that owns Hulu with NBC Universal and Disney,
announced that Hulu plans to implement some sort of charge
and/or subscription model for Hulu's video content starting in
2010. This is the most infuriating thing to happen to Internet
TV since Megavideo implemented the 72 minutes-a-day cap.
Here's my analysis of the sorry state of Hulu advertis
ing that has led to Hulu's impending subscription system.
First, Hulu's philosophy seems to be that links to other videos
take precedence over ads. Hulu has decided that getting peo
ple to click more links and see more ads is better than show
ing ads in more prominent places.
Take the Hulu homepage, for example: Not an adver
tisement in sight. While this plan is good in theory, the reality
of Hulu is that people, for the most part, visit the Web site
already knowing what they want to watch. In that case, the

very small advertisements on the home page and video pages
themselves lose their efficacy. When you're watching a video,
full screen or not, you're not getting any subliminal messaging
from that little box in the corner that's telling you about the
newest Lexus you can't afford.
The content of Hulu's advertisements also provides
quite the conundrum. The companies that own Hulu, NBC
Universal and ABC, seem to pay for the most ads. During
"The Office," "30 Rock" or "Community," for example,

you're forced to watch those horrible "The More You Know"
PSAs. Isn't that self-defeating if you put your own ads, which
don't even advertise your own programming, during your
most popular shows? Disney, the parent company of ABC,
suffers a similar fate, although they manage to promote their
other shows, such as the new venture "Flash Forward" and the
November full-length feature "V." All this seems redundant,
however, when these programs are already being advertised
on the Hulu homepage.
The ads that are not shameless plugs for other TV
shows are examples of horrific demographic targeting. Hulu
seems to think that every female show, from "Grey's
Anatomy" to "Desperate Housewives" to "Greek" to "Ugly
Betty," has a female audience that wants a Nuvaßing. The
repetition of advertisements may be a symptom of Hulu's
advertising woes, but you would think these companies would
realize that continued exposure to the same advertisements at
some point becomes more annoying than effective. When the
pairing of TV show and advertisement lacks all subtlety and
creativity, the ads are even more offensive than ever.
Admittedly, the problem of video advertisements on

the Internet is not unique to
Hulu. The nature of the Internet
is such that, when it comes
around to an advertisement,
you can open another window
and check your Facebook
instead of watching what's
going on. Advertisers on ABC's
video player seem to have
found one solution in interac
tive advertisements, with fea
tures such as quizzes and
games. I mean, who doesn't
want to play a computer game
about a Stouffer's microwav
able panini? If NBC and ABC
can get it right on their own
Web sites, why aren't they

helping Hulu? Or rather, why are they investing in Hulu in the
first place?
The end of Hulu is not the end of the TV Internet
world, just the end of bad TV Internet advertising. Many free
alternatives to Hulu exist abc.com, nbc.com, cbs.com,
cwtv.com, lifetime.com and abcfamily.com all offer decent
quality, legal alternatives to Hulu. If you're feeling adventur
ous and have a good pop-up blocker, sites such as
sidereel.com, surfthechannel.com and realitytvfan.org can help
you out, although the flash quality is markedly worse.
Ninjavideo.net is for the particularly invested viewer, whose
willingness to download from the Web site is rewarded with
HD-quality video whenever you want.
Will the end of Hulu make my life a little harder? Yes.
But will I be happy when their subscription plan crashes and
burns? Yes indeed.
