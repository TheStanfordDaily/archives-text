# Top 10 hardest feats in sports
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
In 2005, USA Today came out
with a top-10 list of the hard
est things to do in sports. They
ranked the toughest tasks in
sports based on sheer difficulty, how
the average person does at each of
the tasks and insights from profes
sional athletes.
The list is naturally controversial
who knows where to even start?
How do we compare quarterback
ing an offense with dunking a bas
ketball? Or a balance beam routine

with speed skating?
The thing is, the people that can
do these things successfully practice
them every single day. You can't just
go out and land a triple axel in ice
skating after a week. The athletes
that do that are on the ice eight
hours a day, every day. The same
goes for all other sports. Just be
cause people do them doesn't make
them easy. They work extremely
hard.

However, there are some things
that are inherently harder than oth

ers. Sorry, quarterbacks, but throw
ing a 40-yard spiral isn't as hard as
clearing the bar in the pole vault. I'll
argue that until the end of time.

But that doesn't mean we can't
at least try to make a list. I'll present
what USA Today thinks are the
hardest feats in sports and then I'll
give my own list. Of course, all read
ers will naturally begin to think
about their lists too.

Here are the USA Today rank
ings, starting with the most difficult:
1. Hitting a 95 mph baseball, 2.

NASCAR driving, 3. Pole vaulting,
4. Hitting a long and straight tee
shot in golf, 5. Returning a serve in
tennis, 6. Landing a quad toe loop in
ice skating, 7. Running a marathon,
8. Tour de France, 9. Saving a penal
ty kick in soccer, 10. Downhill ski
ing.
