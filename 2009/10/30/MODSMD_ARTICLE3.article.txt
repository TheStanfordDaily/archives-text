# Top 10 hardest feats in sports
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
In 2005, USA Today came out
with a top-10 list of the hard
est things to do in sports. They
ranked the toughest tasks in
sports based on sheer difficulty, how
the average person does at each of
the tasks and insights from profes
sional athletes.
The list is naturally controversial
who knows where to even start?
How do we compare quarterback
ing an offense with dunking a bas
ketball? Or a balance beam routine

with speed skating?
The thing is, the people that can
do these things successfully practice
them every single day. You can't just
go out and land a triple axel in ice
skating after a week. The athletes
that do that are on the ice eight
hours a day, every day. The same
goes for all other sports. Just be
cause people do them doesn't make
them easy. They work extremely
hard.

However, there are some things
that are inherently harder than oth

ers. Sorry, quarterbacks, but throw
ing a 40-yard spiral isn't as hard as
clearing the bar in the pole vault. I'll
argue that until the end of time.

But that doesn't mean we can't
at least try to make a list. I'll present
what USA Today thinks are the
hardest feats in sports and then I'll
give my own list. Of course, all read
ers will naturally begin to think
about their lists too.

Here are the USA Today rank
ings, starting with the most difficult:
1. Hitting a 95 mph baseball, 2.

NASCAR driving, 3. Pole vaulting,
4. Hitting a long and straight tee
shot in golf, 5. Returning a serve in
tennis, 6. Landing a quad toe loop in
ice skating, 7. Running a marathon,
8. Tour de France, 9. Saving a penal
ty kick in soccer, 10. Downhill ski
ing.

Pretty intense list, huh? I surely
can't do everything on this list and
I'm not sure if anyone can. But I am
not sure I agree with this list entire
ly. Let's take a look at what I think
are the hardest things in sports.
1. Landing a quad loop/triple axel
ice skating: I think this is the
hardest thing to do in sports. That
teeny blade on the skate. Three
spins. Dizziness. Jumping while mov
ing and twisting. Landing perfectly
on the skate and continuing to go.
Messing up only slightly and you are
basically screwed. This takes the
cake.
2. Gymnastics rings: The iron
cross. Enough said.
3. Gymnastics balance beam:
You only have 4 inches to do crazy
cartwheels and flips. And if you land
but you have to catch yourself, you
are screwed. Also, there's a reason
why men don't compete on the bal
ance beam (think: Falling in the mid
dle of it).

4. Hitting the hole football:
Who wants to take the ball and try to
hit the hole when eight crazy defen
sive players are ready to light you up?
There's a reason why an average four
yards per carry is really good. One of
my greatest accomplishments in life to
date was playing scout team running
back on my high school football team,
getting the ball and shooting into a
gap that I saw. I hit that hole like no
other. I ended up with a concussion.
5. Hitting a solid bunker shot
golf: Golf rules stipulate the sand as a
hazard. And it definitely is hazardous;
hitting out of the sand is no fun. You
may be able to get out of the sand, but
in order for your ball to end up where
you want it, you need major skill and
technique. Believe me when I say a
bunker shot is tough.
6. Hitting a fastball: How can we
not put this on here when players who
are successful only 30 percent of the
time are practically Hall of Famers?
Not to mention when the pitcher de
cides to throw some junk and you get
caught looking silly.
7. Shooting under par golf: It's
hard enough to get a single birdie in
golf, but try putting 18 solid holes in a
row. Countless numbers of golfers
will tell you how close they were to
breaking par, if it weren't for one or
two bad holes. The consistency factor
is huge here and that's why it's so
hard.
8. Competitive eating: This is con
sidered a sport according to
Wikipedia. You try eating 60 or more
hot dogs in 10 minutes or 15 pies in 20
minutes. And even if you decided you
were going to train for competitive
eating, you will still struggle, not to
mention puke.
9. Diving: All right, jumping off of
an insanely high platform, doing
twists and turns and then landing per
fectly into the water ... now that's
something. Then add synchronization
to that, being perfectly aligned with
your partner at every moment.
Damn.
10. Losing gracefully: Yeah, you
didn't think I'd throw a metaphoric
one in here. But seriously, when ath
letes get really competitive and they
pour tons of emotion into their sport,
coming out empty isn't exactly the
greatest feeling. While it is perfectly
okay to be upset and disappointed,
there is something to be said about a
"good loser." Here's to all the athletes
out there who take losses in stride and
don't go down kicking and screaming.
Also receiving strong considera
tion: ski jumping, running the hurdles
in track and field, pole vaulting, sav
ing a slapshot in hockey and, of course
(if you read my column a couple
weeks ago) hitting that final cup in
Beirut.
So there it is. I welcome any and all
thoughts and objections. Next time
you see one of these things happening
(or any sport you find insanely hard),
just think about how special those
athletes are who are carrying out the
feats to a tee. I sure do.
Danny Belch doesn't want you to
know what happened when he tried the
balance beam. Ask him for details at
