# CAL BUDGET SLASHED BY UC SYSTEM
## Cuts mean fewer courses, faculty layoffs and reduced pay 
### RYAN MAYFIELD TROY YANG 
It's no secret that the state is suffering from
the economic recession. These financial prob
lems have in turn translated into $Bl3 million
in budget cuts for the 10 schools of the Univer
sity of California (UC) system. Particularly af
fected is Stanford's neighbor, Berkeley.
At the beginning of this school year,
Berkeley cut nearly $l5O million from the
budget, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle. Totaling more than eight percent
of the school's budget, these cuts have begun
to show on campus and may likely have a rip

pie affect across the region.
On campus, the most noticeable way these
cuts have been affecting Berkeley students is
through a reduction in courses. Approximate
ly eight percent of all courses were cut to re
duce costs.
"I definitely have noticed a reduction in
the amount of classes that they offered," said
Pilar Kearney, Berkeley 'lO. "A couple classes
I really wanted to take aren't offered any
more."
For some, these class shortages are having
a long-term affect, and this has them worried.
Due to the reduction in courses, they may

have to face the possibility of spending an
extra year on campus, simply in order to com
plete their major requirements.
RachelTenney, Berkeley 'lO, who is major
ing in anthropology and minoring in integrat
ed biology, is currently facing this problem.
"There [are only] two or three [required
classes being offered]," Tenney said. "The
chances of me getting in are smaller. As if it
wasn't hard enough to graduate in four years,
with the amount of classes being offered it's
making it a lot more difficult."
Aside from a smaller course
selection, Berkeley's budget cuts
have manifested themselves in
many other ways among them a
45 percent increase in tuition, set
to be carried out over this year and
next.

This will be accompanied by the
reduction of 2,000 employees and
forced furlough days for those
remaining, all of which are hanging
precipitously over the university.
This furlough program consists of a
gradual increase in pay cuts, begin
ning with those with the lowest
salaries losing four percent to
those with the highest salaries los
ing 10 percent.
Concerns about the possibility
of losing distinguished faculty
members have surfaced as a result
of these cuts. As their wages
decrease, the professors may
choose to leave the university due
to higher pay at financially better
off universities, including public
universities like the University of
Texas and private universities such
as Stanford and Harvard.

"I feel that if these furloughs
went on for more than a year,
we're at real risk that we will have
an exodus, and I don't care how
bad conditions are, the really out
standing people will always find
positions," said UC President
Mark Yudof to the Daily
Californian. "Our outstanding pro
fessors can pick up a telephone
and they'll have a choice of where
they can land."
Another prominent issue is the
reduction of staff. An example is
Bob Jorgensen, who had worked as
Berkeley's Director of School
Relations until his early retirement
in 2005 and continued his service
to Berkeley as a member of its
recall staff until this year, when he
became Stanford's Manager of the
Introductory Studies Program
because his recall contract was not
renewed due to budget cuts.
"They didn't want to lay off any
regular staff any more than they
would have to, and so they wanted
to open up any positions recall
staff were picking," said Jorgensen,
"So they would kind of close down
that kind of option for people who
retired early."
Staffing cuts throughout the
university have caused protest,
including one in which a crowd

estimated at more than 5,000
marched through campus. One of
the primary causes of these
protests was the claim of inequali
ty in cuts.
"I know that a lot of the admin
istration hasn't been affected so
much with pay cuts whereas a lot
of the professors and staff are suf
fering," Kearney said.
These cuts to professors' salaries
are also bringing up concerns about
the quality of the university.
Projections by the school have
shown that the budget crisis will
not be resolved until 2011 at the
very earliest, and over that time
salaries will continue to take hits.
As a top public university,
Berkeley's plight has struck a
chord with many, including mem
bers of Stanford's own faculty and
staff with current or prior affilia
tions with Cal. One such example is
Donna Hunter, currently a lecturer
for Stanford's Program in Writing
and Rhetoric.
Hunter, who received her Ph.D.
in English from Berkeley in 2000,
worries about the current situation
for students and faculty at her alma
mater.
"Having gone to Berkeley, I
know it's already hard to get con
tact with professors because
they're already overworked," she
said. "If your funding gets cut and
you have to teach more classes with
more students, I think it's going to
be unfair to both [students and fac
ulty]."
A decrease in academic promi
nence would not only affect
Berkeley and its students, but
would also cause a ripple across the
Bay area.
"It would be a tragedy if one of

the country's greatest universities
were seriously weakened due to
lack of state support," Provost John
Etchemendy wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "Stanford benefits from
having such great academic part
ners [and, yes, competitors] as
Berkeley and UCSF in close prox
imity. Berkeley's continued
strength is in the interest of
California, of the Bay Area and of
Stanford."
Fears of the "crown jewel" of
public universities diminishing in
prominence ring from both stu
dents and alumni.
"When I went to school there, it
was the top English department in
the country, and I'd like to see it be
the top again," Hunter said. "I
think that Cal may never recover,
and that worries me ... Who's to
say when this recession will be
over? Once you fall behind, it's
hard to catch back up."
Despite these worries, UC-
Berkeley Chancellor Robert
Birgeneau believes that there is
still hope.
"Everyone should be clear
about one thing: We are not going
to let Berkeley deteriorate,"
Birgeneau said in an interview with
the Berkeleyan. "We should not
underestimate or mask the chal
lenges that we are facing. But I
think that we are facing them
extremely well. .. But it's impor
tant to keep in mind that we see
this as a several-year process. I
cannot stress it enough: There is no
silver bullet. We are all in this
together."
