# CAL BUDGET SLASHED BY UC SYSTEM
## Cuts mean fewer courses, faculty layoffs and reduced pay 
### RYAN MAYFIELD TROY YANG 
It's no secret that the state is suffering from
the economic recession. These financial prob
lems have in turn translated into $Bl3 million
in budget cuts for the 10 schools of the Univer
sity of California (UC) system. Particularly af
fected is Stanford's neighbor, Berkeley.
At the beginning of this school year,
Berkeley cut nearly $l5O million from the
budget, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle. Totaling more than eight percent
of the school's budget, these cuts have begun
to show on campus and may likely have a rip

pie affect across the region.
On campus, the most noticeable way these
cuts have been affecting Berkeley students is
through a reduction in courses. Approximate
ly eight percent of all courses were cut to re
duce costs.
"I definitely have noticed a reduction in
the amount of classes that they offered," said
Pilar Kearney, Berkeley 'lO. "A couple classes
I really wanted to take aren't offered any
more."
For some, these class shortages are having
a long-term affect, and this has them worried.
Due to the reduction in courses, they may

have to face the possibility of spending an
extra year on campus, simply in order to com
plete their major requirements.
RachelTenney, Berkeley 'lO, who is major
ing in anthropology and minoring in integrat
ed biology, is currently facing this problem.
"There [are only] two or three [required
classes being offered]," Tenney said. "The
chances of me getting in are smaller. As if it
wasn't hard enough to graduate in four years,
with the amount of classes being offered it's
making it a lot more difficult."
