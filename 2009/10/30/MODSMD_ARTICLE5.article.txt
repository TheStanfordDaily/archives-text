zona schools, the No. 4 Stanford women's vol
leyball team closes out the first half of Pac-10
play tied for first place with No. 5 Washington.
The Cardinal kicks off the second half of its
conference schedule this weekend against No.
16 USC and No. 11 UCLA.
"The second half of the Pac-10 is always
great, very exciting," said Head Coach John
Dunning. "We feel good about finishing the
first half tied for first with Washington and
know that every team is going to be going for it
in the second half of the Pac-10."

Stanford has a solid 7-2 conference record and
a 14-5 overall record. UCLA, however, sits in
third, only one game behind.

State 3-0 on Saturday night with junior Alix
Klineman leading the offense with 19 kills. A
breakout performance from freshman Hayley
Spelman added another 10 kills. Senior Janet
Okogbaa chipped in with seven against the
Sun Devils as well.
