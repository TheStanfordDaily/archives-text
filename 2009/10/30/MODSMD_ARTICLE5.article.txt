## Volleyball taking on L.A. schools this weekend 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
After a successful weekend against the Ari
zona schools, the No. 4 Stanford women's vol
leyball team closes out the first half of Pac-10
play tied for first place with No. 5 Washington.
The Cardinal kicks off the second half of its
conference schedule this weekend against No.
16 USC and No. 11 UCLA.
"The second half of the Pac-10 is always
great, very exciting," said Head Coach John
Dunning. "We feel good about finishing the
first half tied for first with Washington and
know that every team is going to be going for it
in the second half of the Pac-10."
After playing each conference team once,
Stanford has a solid 7-2 conference record and
a 14-5 overall record. UCLA, however, sits in
third, only one game behind.
Last weekend, Stanford swept Arizona
State 3-0 on Saturday night with junior Alix
Klineman leading the offense with 19 kills. A
breakout performance from freshman Hayley
Spelman added another 10 kills. Senior Janet
Okogbaa chipped in with seven against the
Sun Devils as well.
Stanford triumphed 3-0 over Arizona the
next afternoon. Klineman and Okogbaa had

weekend's matches having swept Pac

Cassidy Lichtman had nine kills, nine

While Stanford's offense has been
surging of late, it will match up with
another dominating offense in USC.
This past weekend Alex Jupiter
tallied 19 kills in a sweep of Oregon
State, with teammate Audrey Eichler
adding 10 more.
Jupiter followed this up with 19
more kills against Oregon, along with
three aces, seven digs and three
blocks. Lauren Williams also had 12
kills against the Ducks.
Earlier in the month, Stanford
swept the Trojans, as Klineman led
the way with 24 kills and Lichtman
added 12 kills in the victory.
"When we played USC the last
time we really served and passed well.

which is very important," Dunning
said. "For us to be successful the rest
of our offense needs to be better, we
need to be balanced."
Last weekend, UCLA beat the
Oregon schools, taking a five-set
match against Oregon and a 3-0
sweep against Oregon State. Against
Oregon, Kaitlin Sather, Amanda Gil,
and Lauren Cook all had double
doubles.
Against Oregon State, UCLA at
tacked quickly in each set and found
no problem sweeping the Beavers.
The first match up against the Bru
ins had the Cardinal focused on the
fast-paced game that UCLA brings.
Stanford still needs to look out for an
even more fluid, speedy match while
also looking out for key players in
Sather, Gil and Cook. Gil leads the
conference in blocks, with Okogbaa
second. With Gil on the defensive,
Stanford needs to spread out its hit
ters in order to throw her game off.
Although the Cardinal defeated
UCLA 3-1 at the beginning of the
month, playing fast and making quick
decisions will be a key component in
making the Bruins commit errors.
"UCLA is always dangerous the
second half of the season because the
fast stuff they do takes a lot of prac
tice, and by the time you get to them
the next time, they're going to be a lot
better at it," Dunning said.
Stanford plays USC on Friday at 7
p.m. and UCLA on Saturday at 7 p.m.
at Maples Pavilion.
