## Ten percent of campus water use maintains 215 acres of golf course grass Golf course requires millions of gallons 
### ADAM COLE 
There is a fox on the fairway. As it saun
ters along, dodging sprinkler heads and
yawning toothily, it looks surprisingly at
home. But this isn't the wilderness it's a
carefully cultivated golf course, where the
price of being verdant is paid in gallons,
despite the best efforts of its caretakers to
reduce water use.

"It's a heavily irrigated landscape," said
biologist Alan Launer, a research associate
with the Stanford Center for Conservation
Biology. "It's just a bunch of lawn."
The 215 acres of lawn that make up the
Stanford Golf Course and the adjacent var
sity practice area use 123 million gallons of
water a year. This represents one-third of
Stanford's non-potable water use and 10
percent of their total water consumption.

Farm Educator and earth sciences lectur
er Sarah Wiederkehr is not surprised. "The
idea of a golf course is inherently not sus
tainable, especially in this climate," she said.
"That green is green because it's been heav
ily fertilized and watered."
For the extended community that enjoys
the Stanford Golf Course every day, all this
watering is worth it.
"[The] Stanford Golf Course is one of the

most beautiful and challenging golf courses
I have played," said varsity golfer Angel
King 'l2.
Golf Course Superintendent Ken
Williams said the course is used every day
by the varsity teams, as well as many com
munity members, alumni and even the varsi
ty cross country team. He estimated that
60,000 rounds of golf are played there every
year.

The golfers who frequent the course may
be unaware that each of these rounds is
made possible by 1,600 gallons of water.
That's the equivalent of flushing the toilet 55
times for every hole played.

Williams is well aware of the amount of
water the course uses and has made a strong
effort to minimize it. He said it pays to con
serve. The course spends about $200,000 on
irrigation every year.

David Freyburg, an associate professor of
civil and environmental engineering who
specializes in water resources, said one of
the best things a golf course can do to save
water is to monitor exactly how much the
grass needs.
Williams has done just that. With scores
of surface and below-ground sensors that
report back to a central computer, golf
course caretakers know exactly where and

when the grass needs more water. In some
areas, they can even turn on single sprinklers
to deliver water to the exact location.
Still, Williams said, "We could do better."
Some of the sprinklers can only be
turned on in groups, so patches of grass may

get water they don't need. And while sprin
klers are mainly turned on in the morning
and at night when there is less evaporation,
sometimes watering during the day or when
it is windy results in unnecessary water loss.
One way to reduce the necessity for

extreme water use, Freyburg said, is to plant
hardier grass species that lose less water
through evaporation. Williams considered
this option, but said such grass tends to turn
brown in the summer and doesn't have the
same consistency and give that golfers are
used to.
"The grass does affect the roll and the
bounce of the ball differently," said King,
who has played on water-saving grasses in
Arizona.
Freyburg said more sophisticated moni
toring tools and irrigation technology will
help save more water in the future, and
Williams agreed. Williams talked excitedly
about more efficient sprinkler head nozzles
and the individual control of every sprinkler
on the course.
Flowever, these new measures can only
go so far maintaining a golf course inher
ently means using a lot of water.
"I do not know how feasible it would be
for a golf course to be able to sustain its
prestige and condition while minimizing the
use of water," King said.
"It's not nature," Williams said. "It's defi
nitely a forced situation."

Stanford's climate is inherently not conducive to maintaining a perfect-kempt golf course, so doing so requires a large amount of resources in the form of fertilizer, water and irrigation. Although caretakers have tried to
decrease the water usage of grass maintenance by installing sensors and other monitoring tools, the case remains that golf courses are expensive to maintain.
