## Heller picked by billionaire Soros to head global climate change project 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
Billionaire George Soros has picked a
Stanford professor to head a $lOO million
project to address global climate change.
Soros, ranked in Forbes magazine as the
world's 29th most wealthy individual,
pledged $l.l billion in total to climate
change policy in mid-October. Law Prof.
Thomas Heller, who will head the Climate
Policy Initiative (CPI), said the goal of the
CPI in particular will be to improve the
effectiveness of governments worldwide in
implementing crucial measures.
"The simple purpose [of the CPI] is to
assess what is working and not working in
the policy portfolios, and try to understand
why you get the gap that exists between

intention of policy and performance,"
Heller said. "And then work with govern
ments to try and help them to improve the
kind of policies they are adapting in key
countries around the world."

According to Heller, who has worked
with Soros on other environmental-related
issues, the idea of forming the CPI began
circulating about a year ago, but really
materialized in the last six months. Heller
has been doing climate work for almost 20
years.

"Tom has exceptional experience in the
international arena and has been working
on climate change issues for as long as I can
recall," said colleague and Law Prof. Buzz
Thompson. "He's probably the perfect can
didate for running a climate policy initia
tive."

Heller explained that the CPI will most
ly be a decentralized organization with
operating facilities in San Francisco as well
as in some European countries, China,
India and Brazil. These countries are all
currently exploring a cap-and-trade system
or implementing a carbon tax, and Heller is
interested to see the effects of these poli
cies.

"Our experience and our knowledge
about how governments and organizations
work tell us that very well-intended poli
cies often don't have the intended impact
on behavior or changes or the way activi
ties proceed," Heller said.
Soros, too, has emphasized the impor
tance of a practical focus.
"The problem of global warming is pri
marily a political problem at this point,"

Soros said in his announcement in
Copenhagen. "The science is beyond dis
pute, but how do we achieve the objectives
we all know are necessary? That is a politi
cal problem."
Heller said one of the most important
objectives of the CPI is deciding what is rel
evant in current climate change research, as
well as finding "the strength of objectivity
in analysis."
"I have very specific goals about rele
vance," Heller said. "We want to find away
to present these responses in away policy
makers see [as] most relevant. It has to fit
into the agenda as they perceive it and [be]
absorbable in the way [that] governments
or organizations can actually make use of
assessments that they may be requesting."
Thompson said that he was confident

Heller could analyze climate policy on the
global scale necessary to make further
advances.

"[Heller is] somebody who has not only
been working on the international treaty
front, but has also been thinking about
other ways in which you can move climate
policy through bilateral agreements and
other mechanisms," Thompson said. "The
bottom line is Tom is one of the most cre
ative thinkers I know in this area and is
really well positioned to advance climate
policy worldwide."
According to Heller, the CPl's first step
is to attend a small workshop in Berlin,
where the CPl's first office is already "up
and running," on how countries
define subsides. The workshop will
be held in two weeks, followed by a
financial discussion in Venice and
another in Beijing.
Heller said that in conjunction
with these global meetings, the CPI

also plans to reach out to students
at universities located near the
intended international offices,
including Stanford.
"We're expecting to engage peo
ple in research," Heller said, "from
Berlin with the technical university
and here in the Bay Area where
doctoral level students from
Stanford are interested, we will be
able to attract some of them to
work with us and develop theses
that are consistent with our own

research objectives."
"I'm looking forward to train a
new generation around the world,
and I would love to see this devel
op to help make those [research]
opportunities available," Heller
added. "There's an educational
dimension to it that we hope
Stanford will be involved in and
students will take advantage of."
