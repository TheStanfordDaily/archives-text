### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford stem cell researchers
will receive $52 million from
California's stem cell agency.

The California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine (CIRM),
along with Britain's Medical
Research Council and Canada's
Cancer Stem Cell Consortium,
announced the award of $250 mil
lion in total to foster the discovery
of stem cell treatments. UCSF,
UCSD and UCLA are among the

other recipients of CIRM grants.
Stanford's money will go toward
research projects on leukemia,
stroke and epidermolysis bullosa, a
genetic disorder characterized by
skin blisters. The separate projects
received $2O million, $2O million and
$l2 million, respectively.

Created in 2004, CIRM aims to
cut down the time between lab
research and human patient trials.
Eligible grant applicants must prove
they can gain U.S. Food and Drug
Administration clearance to begin
human studies within four years.
To date, Stanford has won the
most grants from CIRM, securing
$163 million for stem cell research
out of the total $1 billion that has

been distributed by the agency. The
next highest is UCSF, which has
received $lO3 million.
