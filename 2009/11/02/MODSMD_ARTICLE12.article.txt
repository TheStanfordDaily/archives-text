### 
You have midterms. You are tired. You
did not get enough sleep last night.
Your PWR professor expects way too
much from you. And your statistics lecture
was incredibly boring today. Yeah, we know.
We also know you are from some dorm on
campus and some city in the world. If you are
passionately involved in a campus organiza
tion or got so drunk on Friday you do not even
remember it, we probably could have guessed
that, too.

come not from our successes, but out of our
failures. Allowing ourselves to have vulnera
bilities and to let other people in on them
is the only way to develop the sense of trust
we can fall back on. But Stanford students try
to present themselves as winners, right down
to the core. We embrace our vulnerabilities
about as much as we wrap ourselves around
porcupines. In this select population of super
achievers, being human does not seem good
enough. And so often, we pretend we are be
yond it.
In the absence of the bravery necessary to
put our real selves out there, for better or for

But that doesn't mean we know you. And
neither do most of the 200 other people you
have had that conversation with this week.
Sure, it's important to be friendly and sociable
making conversation is a life skill that will
serve you well wherever you go, and Stanford
students have heard enough about the value
of making "connections."

worse, we resort to the same old conversations
about the things you are "supposed" to be
stressed about. We think we are bonding over
difficult times by flaunting our struggles
against the traditional badges of worry:
midterms, papers or lack of sleep. But when
bigger issues like the kinds people face in
the real world come up, they seem out of
place and embarrassing. And so, students keep
them hidden, sometimes even from their close
friends and roommates.

But what the Editorial Board does feel
needs reiteration is what developing relation
ships with people is really about: quality over
quantity.

Unfortunately, some of the basic staples of
life at Stanford seem to stand in the way of this
quest at times. For one thing, there is the usual
excuse: not enough time. Yes, developing the
kinds of bonds we are talking about requires
free time something Stanford students do
not have a lot of.There is just only so much you
can talk about in the fifteen minutes a day be
tween your problem sets and meetings and
classes. But if Stanford students find time for
everything else, surely they could carve out
the occasional hour or two for genuine human
interaction. We call this an excuse because we
actually do not think it is the problem.
There is one thing close friendships require
that Stanford students are not so good at: fail
ing. In a paradoxical way, our best friendships

In this way, the Stanford duck syndrome is
not so much about pretending we are not
stressed as it is about limiting the things we re
veal to others to acceptable forms of anxiety.
But this superficial form of relating gets us
nowhere in terms of creating real bonds with
others. Only when we let ourselves fall do we
give people the opportunity to lift us back on
our feet. Those are the people we call our best
friends.

From the perspective of the Editorial
Board, creating authentic and lasting bonds
with others is a vital yet all too often over
looked aspect of college life, and one which
students may later regret not fulfilling.
