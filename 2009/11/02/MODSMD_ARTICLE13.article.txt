# THE 						DUDE ABIDES
## "You're Goddamn Right I live in the Past!" 
### Zack Warma 
Before we proceed into today's topic,
there are some housekeeping issues that
I must address in relation to last week's
column. First, to Renny: I realize the errors of
my shoddy journalism. Bagel Day is actually
100, and not 200, of the world's tastiest bagels.
Next, to the residents and staff of Narnia: I
want to make it clear that literally zero disre
spect was meant toward your lovely home. I
should have made it clearer that I think you
constitute one of the best residential environ
ments on campus. Should I happen in some
time this year, please don't shoot me.
Moving right along. As many of you may or
may not have keyed in from the massive
amount of tremendously questionable and ex
travagant outfits flaunted publicly (and not
just inside the Band Shak, Cowell Cluster or
SAE!), Saturday was Flalloween. As a brief
aside, yours truly has ye t to shave the mullet off
his head. But coming in tow with All Hallow's
Eve was Mausoleum Party, the on again, off
again, weather-contingent all-campus bonanza
that remains with Big Game, Full Moon and
Exotic Erotic, essentially one of the only Farm
wide, non-greek events that draws folks from
even the most remote nooks and crannies
(Adams and Schiff). While this author cannot
personally vouch for the party actually hap
pening, the 58 different Facebook albums that
have popped up on everyone's home page are
certainly proof enough.
The bits and pieces that have floated out
from Mausoleum billed it largely a success.
However, there was a seriously possibility no
more than four weeks ago that our Dead Man's
Party would have had to leave its body at the
door. With the drying up of certain University
funds, the junior class presidents (the assigned
planners and annual stewards of the event since
being revived a few years ago) found them
selves looking at a several thousand dollar
shortfall. Had not the ASSU (particularly the
Senate and sophomore class presidents)
opened their wallets to save the puppy, this
school year would have had been bereft of both
Mausoleum and Full Moon on the Quad, which
was offed by the great threat of Swine Flu.
Now something that will NEVER be
threatened by budget cuts or killer pigs is
Homecoming Weekend, which unfolded in a
sea of tents, expensive dinner spreads and rose
tinted nostalgia two weekends back. Throngs
of faithful Cardinal alumni poured in from
across the globe armed with lanyards, families
and pleas for directions at a place becoming in
creasingly foreign, yet in ways all too familiar.
The oddity of this annual spectacle is the sense
of history that literally descends upon the
Farm, where old memories of bygone times are
relived over walks and the white wine. Though
sadly even having a giant alum contingency, we
still couldn't get Stanford Stadium looking like
a moderately legitimate Pac-10 fan section.
But we did win.

Why bring up Mausoleum, Full Moon and
Alumni Weekend? As seemingly disparate
kissing drunk freshmen, desecrating the
founding family's final resting place, and
yukking-it-up alums may seem, these are some
of the most singular vestiges of Stanford tradi
tion. Stanford, generally speaking, is not in the
business of dealing with the past. We have a sin
gle, distastefully decorated room in Cantor on
the Stanford family. Stunning period photo
graphs are relegated to the Lalß. Spirits of the
past whistling through the arcades? We have
CoHo caricatures.

Screw history; we are about cold, hard
progress baby! There's a reason why even in
the face of several billion-dollar budget cuts,
we're still putting up science buildings stocked
with top-of-the-line technology. Our students
design and patent million-dollar iPhone soft
ware. Stanford University is the great white of
higher education: Fearsome and powerful, our
death will supposedly come once we stop mov
ing.

In this regard, we will never be a Harvard or
a Princeton. Our institution will never revel in
the glorious cobwebs of the past. We even have
a penchant for discarding relics of the past. Big
Game Bonfires, swimming in Lag, Moonsplash
(Really, SAL, really???), the beloved Kappa
Sig "Tropical Archipelago Themed Party"
(you will be missed), even "Branner Sucks": as
this school changes and develops, for better or
worse, historical holdovers are negated, disre
garded or essentially phased out by institution
al un-learning.
So, then, what place does that leave for tra
ditions at the Farm? What function does the
past serve as a forward-looking institution?
Fundamentally, with the utter absence of a uni
fied campus feel, even contrived gags like roll
outs help create a level of shared experience,
one that can be traced back longer than last
quarter. Traditions, in a strange Stanford way,
also provide vitality to each generation. The
1953 FMOTQ sure as hell didn't look like the
2008 edition, which will be different from what
goes down in 10,20 years from now, and that's
not a bad thing. So master the Jump, learn
Stanford's past, but take what this place throws
at you. Even if it's a mullet.

Zack is shocked by the copious amounts of Hal
loween pics that feature the exact same costumes.
Have a story about an insane get-up? Let Zack
know at zwarma@stanford.edu.
