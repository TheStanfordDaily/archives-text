# GIRL, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## Pat Robertson, Gay Lover 
### Jordan Carr 
Pat Robertson secretly loves the gays.
More on this later. This week. President
Obama signed hate crime legislation
named for Matthew Shepard, a gay man who
was brutally murdered 10 years ago which
will, for the first time, protect sexual orienta
tion. Some gay rights activists have celebrat
ed this occasion, apparently under the im
pression that it was legal to kill gay people
until this week, ignoring that both of Matthew
Shepard's killers are serving consecutive life
sentences without parole, despite being sen
tenced before any such hate crime legislation
was in place.
These laws criminalize opinions, not ac
tions. It is not illegal to hate other people. It is
illegal to rob someone. Under hate crime leg
islation, if you rob someone because you hate
a group they belong to, it becomes more ille
gal. As such, holding certain opinions be
comes conditionally legal. Hate crime laws
implicitly argue that there are occasions when
opinions, rather than the actions they inspire,
should be criminalized. If we do not have
enough faith in one another to discern the
morally abhorrent from the socially accept
able, then it is time to admit this "free speech"
experiment was a failure. One prominent
politician and religious leader agrees.
Pat Robertson ran for president in 1988,
placing third in the Republican primaries. His
fame primarily comes from his ownership of
the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN)
and his program on it, "The 700 Club." He has
a penchant for making outlandish statements,
my favorite being when he claimed that
through the power of his Age Defying Shake
he was able to leg press 2,000 pounds.
Mr. Robertson's most recent imbroglio
came when he noted that the aforementioned
hate crimes legislation was a sign that "the
noose has tightened around the necks of
Christians to keep them from speaking out on
certain moral issues."

Mr. Robertson's insane framing of the de
bate obscures the reasonable position against
hate crime laws. For hate crime legislation's
apologists, letting Pat Robertson make him
self the voice of the opposition is ideal. Mr.

Robertson clearly has taken to heart that
great syphilitic German Friedrich Nietzsche's
exhortation (in a book called "The Gay Sci
ence"!) that "the most perfidious way of
harming a cause is deliberately defending it
with faulty arguments," and so it seems likely
that he is doing just that.

I would be remiss if I did not note that this
article owes a debt to the modern literary tra
dition of Contrarianism, best defined as using
a semi-accurate attention-grabbing title, then
making a counterintuitive point based on
scanty evidence. This week, Stephen Dubner
and Steven Levitt, authors of the bestselling
"Freakonomics" and its sequel "SuperF
reakonomics," came under heat for making
scientifically dubious arguments in favor of
drunk driving and against global warming.
The criticism has had two points: They are
wrong, and are irresponsibly choosing an in
teresting story over an accurate one. Point
one is debatable; point two is irrefutable.

If anyone deserves credit for bringing this
type of oversimplified Contrarianism to the
fore, it is Malcolm Gladwell, who has been in
credibly successful peddling formulaic dreck
in which an easy explanation shows how
Things Are Different Than You Thought They
Were by advancing a hypothesis, then, with
out warning, jumping to a superficially unre
lated example.
New York City underwent a rapid drop in
crime rates in the early 19905. Gladwell says it
is the result of the so-called "broken win
dows" policy wherein minor crimes are pros
ecuted, and the subways and cities are physi
cally cleaned to prevent would-be criminals
from taking cues from their dilapidated sur
roundings that push them toward crime.
Dubner and Levitt argue that abortion's
legalization in 1973 neutered that genera
tion's youth in its criminal prime. Both these
stories wrap up a confusing, multivariate phe
nomenon into an interesting, straightforward
and compelling story that allows the reader to
feel like they can understand an infinitely
complex mechanism. The formula is working
they combine to have six New York Times
bestsellers.

Gladwell, Contrarianism's godfather, has
been immensely successful because he can si
multaneously tell a fascinating story and mar
ket it as nonfiction, even if his claims that
Atticus Finch was a racist or the 1995-1996
Kentucky Wildcats basketball team with nine
future NBA players were underdogs
range from questionable to specious.

Still, Gladwell is not the worst offender.
That honor belongs to Slate's Jonah Weiner,
who published what is unquestionably the
most irresponsible and dishonest article ever
written, possibly signaling the demise of the
Contrarians. The article's headline says it all:
"Creed Is Good." No, they are not, and if this is
the best the Contrarians can do, then they, like
the Fonz before them, have jumped the shark.
The Wellness Room is still open.
