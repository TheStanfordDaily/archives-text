## WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL Falling short at the finish Klineman and Okogbaa lift Card over USC, but can't beat Bruins 
### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team
hosted two ranked teams this weekend, coming
away with a victory against No. 16 USC (15-7, 4-6
Pac-10) and a grueling five-set loss to No. 11 UCLA.
The Cardinal took down the Trojans 21-25, 25-18,
25-13, 25-13 on Friday at Maples Pavilion before
falling to the Bruins Saturday night 18-25,32-34,25-
19, 25-21, 11-15, the team's first loss at home this
year.

The weekend started smoothly for the Cardinal
(15-6,8-3 Pac-10), as it executed the serving game to
perfection, recording seven aces as a team on the
way to victory over USC.

"Serving is crucial in a match like this, especially
against such an offensively minded team like USC,"
said freshman setter Karissa Cook, who recorded 38
assists in the win. "If we serve that tough against any
team we will be successful; if they can't pass, they
can't run their offense."

Stanford was led by junior outside hitter Alix
Klineman's 16 kills, which, along with senior middle
blocker Janet Okogbaa's 13 kills and seven blocks,
propelled the team to the win. Junior libero Gabi
Ailes also made big contributions, registering three
service aces and 27 digs.

In the first set, USC sophomore outside hitter
Alex Jupiter's 10 kills helped the Trojans go on sev
eral runs and eventually win the set 21-25.
However, Stanford came back strong in the sec
ond set, opening up a 12-8 lead off a run that includ
ed three kills by Klineman.The lead increased to 17-
12, as Okogbaa pounded two kills, but a quick run
brought the Trojans within two, 17-15. Kills by soph
omore Stephanie Browne and Okogbaa, as well as
errors by USC, allowed Stanford to take the set, 25-
18.

"The biggest change in our game between sets
one and two was our overall speed of play," Cook
said. "We knew after the game that we needed to
pick it up and we did."

The Card continued to dominate in the third set,
jumping out to an early 5-1 lead and never relin
quishing it. Okogbaa contributed five kills and jun
ior Cassidy Lichtman, who recorded her 14th dou
ble-double of the season, added two more as the
Card captured the third set in commanding fashion.
In the fourth set, the Card was led by Klineman's
seven kills and managed to pull out the set, 25-23,
and the match, bringing its overall record to 15-5.
"We did a great job of not letting the slow speed
of their offense have an affect on our game," said
senior Alex Fisher of the win.
