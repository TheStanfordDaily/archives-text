## WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL Falling short at the finish Klineman and Okogbaa lift Card over USC, but can't beat Bruins 
### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team
hosted two ranked teams this weekend, coming
away with a victory against No. 16 USC (15-7, 4-6
Pac-10) and a grueling five-set loss to No. 11 UCLA.
The Cardinal took down the Trojans 21-25, 25-18,
25-13, 25-13 on Friday at Maples Pavilion before
falling to the Bruins Saturday night 18-25,32-34,25-
19, 25-21, 11-15, the team's first loss at home this
year.

The weekend started smoothly for the Cardinal
(15-6,8-3 Pac-10), as it executed the serving game to
perfection, recording seven aces as a team on the
way to victory over USC.

"Serving is crucial in a match like this, especially
against such an offensively minded team like USC,"
said freshman setter Karissa Cook, who recorded 38
assists in the win. "If we serve that tough against any
team we will be successful; if they can't pass, they
can't run their offense."

Stanford was led by junior outside hitter Alix
Klineman's 16 kills, which, along with senior middle
blocker Janet Okogbaa's 13 kills and seven blocks,
propelled the team to the win. Junior libero Gabi
Ailes also made big contributions, registering three
service aces and 27 digs.

In the first set, USC sophomore outside hitter
Alex Jupiter's 10 kills helped the Trojans go on sev
eral runs and eventually win the set 21-25.
However, Stanford came back strong in the sec
ond set, opening up a 12-8 lead off a run that includ
ed three kills by Klineman.The lead increased to 17-
12, as Okogbaa pounded two kills, but a quick run
brought the Trojans within two, 17-15. Kills by soph
omore Stephanie Browne and Okogbaa, as well as
errors by USC, allowed Stanford to take the set, 25-
18.

"The biggest change in our game between sets
one and two was our overall speed of play," Cook
said. "We knew after the game that we needed to
pick it up and we did."

The Card continued to dominate in the third set,
jumping out to an early 5-1 lead and never relin
quishing it. Okogbaa contributed five kills and jun
ior Cassidy Lichtman, who recorded her 14th dou
ble-double of the season, added two more as the
Card captured the third set in commanding fashion.
In the fourth set, the Card was led by Klineman's
seven kills and managed to pull out the set, 25-23,
and the match, bringing its overall record to 15-5.
"We did a great job of not letting the slow speed
of their offense have an affect on our game," said
senior Alex Fisher of the win.
Saturday night brought a tough
match against the No. 11 UCLA
Bruins 18-6 overall, 8-3 Pac-10), in
which the Card experienced a brutal
five-set loss, dropping Stanford's
conference record to 8-3 and putting
the team in a tie for second place in
the Pac-10 with UCLA.

In the first set, Stanford jumped
out to an early 12-7 lead, behind kills
by freshman Jessica Walker, Fisher
and Klineman, who again led the
team with 20 kills. After a Lichtman
kill gave Stanford a 17-14 lead,
UCLA went on an 11-0 run, taking
the set, 18-25.
The teams stayed even in the sec
ond set, with some back and forth
play leading to an 11-11 tie. Kills by
Okogbaa and Klineman put Stan
ford up 20-18, but the Card couldn't
hold on, allowing UCLA to catch up
and tie it at 25 all. Stanford eventual
ly dropped the set, 32-34, hitting .191
in the first two sets, while the Bruins
recorded a .238 attack percentage.

"The main difference between
USC and UCLA is the speed of their
offense," Fisher said. "UCLA runs a
very quick offense that we struggled
to keep up with."
However, the Card stepped up in
the third set, jumping out to a 16-10
lead behind kills by Okogbaa and
Klineman. After UCLA pulled back
to within three, a Card run, punctuat
ed by a Klineman kill, gave the Card
the set, 25-19.
In the fourth, Stanford found it
self down early, 7-10, but used the
home crowd to pull into a 16-13 lead
on kills by Litchman and Browne.
The Card wouldn't trail again in the
set and an Okogbaa kill sealed the
deal, with Stanford tying the match
up at two sets apiece.
In the fifth and final set, Stanford
jumped out to an 8-4 lead, but went
down 10-11 after committing some
errors. This proved to be all UCLA
needed, and a quick 4-1 run ended

the set, 11-15, and the match.
"We made more unforced errors
than usual, which was the difference
between winning and losing," Fisher
said. "The good news is that the loss
has only made us more motivated to
work hard this week in preparation
for the Huskies."
Next weekend, the Cardinal
looks to take the lessons they
learned against USC and UCLA up
to Washington, where it will face the
conference-leading No. 5 Washing
ton Huskies on Friday, before squar
ing off against Washington State on
Saturday.

Junior outside hitter Alix Klineman registered 16 kills against No. 16 USC on Friday and another 20 against No. 11 UCLA on Saturday. Klineman
leads the team with 309 kills on the season, helping her lead the team with 358 overall points. The Cardinal's loss to UCLA, though, marked the
team's first loss at home this season, but Stanford will look to rebound on the road at the Washington schools this week.
The No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team
hosted two ranked teams this weekend, coming
away with a victory against No. 16 USC (15-7, 4-6
Pac-10) and a grueling five-set loss to No. 11 UCLA.
The Cardinal took down the Trojans 21-25, 25-18,
25-13, 25-13 on Friday at Maples Pavilion before
falling to the Bruins Saturday night 18-25,32-34,25-
19, 25-21, 11-15, the team's first loss at home this
year.

The weekend started smoothly for the Cardinal
(15-6,8-3 Pac-10), as it executed the serving game to
perfection, recording seven aces as a team on the
way to victory over USC.

"Serving is crucial in a match like this, especially
against such an offensively minded team like USC,"
said freshman setter Karissa Cook, who recorded 38
assists in the win. "If we serve that tough against any
team we will be successful; if they can't pass, they
can't run their offense."

Stanford was led by junior outside hitter Alix
Klineman's 16 kills, which, along with senior middle
blocker Janet Okogbaa's 13 kills and seven blocks,
propelled the team to the win. Junior libero Gabi
Ailes also made big contributions, registering three
service aces and 27 digs.

In the first set, USC sophomore outside hitter
Alex Jupiter's 10 kills helped the Trojans go on sev
eral runs and eventually win the set 21-25.
However, Stanford came back strong in the sec
ond set, opening up a 12-8 lead off a run that includ
ed three kills by Klineman.The lead increased to 17-
12, as Okogbaa pounded two kills, but a quick run
brought the Trojans within two, 17-15. Kills by soph
omore Stephanie Browne and Okogbaa, as well as
errors by USC, allowed Stanford to take the set, 25-
18.

"The biggest change in our game between sets
one and two was our overall speed of play," Cook
said. "We knew after the game that we needed to
pick it up and we did."

The Card continued to dominate in the third set,
jumping out to an early 5-1 lead and never relin
quishing it. Okogbaa contributed five kills and jun
ior Cassidy Lichtman, who recorded her 14th dou
ble-double of the season, added two more as the
Card captured the third set in commanding fashion.
In the fourth set, the Card was led by Klineman's
seven kills and managed to pull out the set, 25-23,
and the match, bringing its overall record to 15-5.
"We did a great job of not letting the slow speed
of their offense have an affect on our game," said
senior Alex Fisher of the win.
Saturday night brought a tough
match against the No. 11 UCLA
Bruins 18-6 overall, 8-3 Pac-10), in
which the Card experienced a brutal
five-set loss, dropping Stanford's
conference record to 8-3 and putting
the team in a tie for second place in
the Pac-10 with UCLA.

In the first set, Stanford jumped
out to an early 12-7 lead, behind kills
by freshman Jessica Walker, Fisher
and Klineman, who again led the
team with 20 kills. After a Lichtman
kill gave Stanford a 17-14 lead,
UCLA went on an 11-0 run, taking
the set, 18-25.
The teams stayed even in the sec
ond set, with some back and forth
play leading to an 11-11 tie. Kills by
Okogbaa and Klineman put Stan
ford up 20-18, but the Card couldn't
hold on, allowing UCLA to catch up
and tie it at 25 all. Stanford eventual
ly dropped the set, 32-34, hitting .191
in the first two sets, while the Bruins
recorded a .238 attack percentage.

"The main difference between
USC and UCLA is the speed of their
offense," Fisher said. "UCLA runs a
very quick offense that we struggled
to keep up with."
However, the Card stepped up in
the third set, jumping out to a 16-10
lead behind kills by Okogbaa and
Klineman. After UCLA pulled back
to within three, a Card run, punctuat
ed by a Klineman kill, gave the Card
the set, 25-19.
In the fourth, Stanford found it
self down early, 7-10, but used the
home crowd to pull into a 16-13 lead
on kills by Litchman and Browne.
The Card wouldn't trail again in the
set and an Okogbaa kill sealed the
deal, with Stanford tying the match
up at two sets apiece.
In the fifth and final set, Stanford
jumped out to an 8-4 lead, but went
down 10-11 after committing some
errors. This proved to be all UCLA
needed, and a quick 4-1 run ended

the set, 11-15, and the match.
"We made more unforced errors
than usual, which was the difference
between winning and losing," Fisher
said. "The good news is that the loss
has only made us more motivated to
work hard this week in preparation
for the Huskies."
Next weekend, the Cardinal
looks to take the lessons they
learned against USC and UCLA up
to Washington, where it will face the
conference-leading No. 5 Washing
ton Huskies on Friday, before squar
ing off against Washington State on
Saturday.
