# EARNING A BREAK
## Stanford wins one and ties one in its final northern roadtrip 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's official: The Cardinal is back. After
racking up it's 10th win of the regular sea
son, the men's soccer team has brought
back memories of 2002, the last time they
won as many games, and the year they
reached the title game at the NCAAs.
The great results from before the start of
the Pacific-10 Conference schedule had
blown away the cobwebs from last year but,
until recently, it was tough to say where
Stanford (10-4-2, Pac-10 4-3-1) would place
this season. Now, after picking up four
points for a win against Oregon State (7-6-
2, Pac-10 3-4-0) and a draw against Wash
ington (4-5-6, Pac-10 1-1-5) on a difficult
weekend away in the north, it looks as if the
players will be rewarded with an NCAA
berth.

"We're in pretty good shape after our

weekend," said Head Coach Bret Simon.
"But there is still a lot to be determined,
whether we host the first round, or whether
we get a bye."

The game at Corvallis on Friday against
the Beavers started well for the Cardinal,
with senior Evan Morgan scoring in the
23rd minute, and the team holding on to a
1-0 lead at the break. In the second half,
Stanford was looking comfortable until
the team conceded a penalty midway
through. Oregon State capitalized on the
opportunity, bringing the game level and
risking a turn of the game's momentum.
"Up until that point we really had the
game under control," Simon said. "We were
creating the chances, we had the majority of
the possession and they really hadn't had a
quality chance. After the PK, for the next 10
or 15 minutes, they gained a lot of enthusi-

GAME NOTES ! Cal has not earned a win since Oct.
11, but the cross-bay rivalry always makes soccer's
Big Game a heated rivalry. Stanford is coming off
two wins and a tie, and hopes that this momentum
will last through the teams' two weeks of deserved
rest. Come Big Game weekend, though, both
teams will be ready to go, as Stanford looks to im
prove its positioning before the postseason.

Senior midfielder Michael Strickland and the Cardinal improved to 4-3-1 in conference play (1 0-4-2 overall) with a win over
Oregon State and a double-overtime draw with Washington.

asm, they played well, they played
hard. All of a sudden the momentum
had changed."
The game settled down until the
last 10 minutes, when a flurry of goals
finally broke the tie. The Cardinal
was able to notch two more goals by
junior Cameron Lamming and fresh
man Adam Jahn, and Stanford put
the game seemingly out of reach.The
Card was even denied a fourth
chance by a debatable offside deci
sion. Beavers' sophomore Danny
Mwanga then clawed one back, forc
ing Stanford to hang on in the final
moments to earn its 3-2 victory.
Where Friday's game was a real
goal-fest, Sunday's ended 0-0, after
two periods of overtime could not
separate the teams. It was not, how
ever, a case of the two sides playing
for a draw.
Washington collectively made 24
shots to Stanford's seven, forcing
some fingertip saves out of senior
goalkeeper John Moore and repeat
edly testing the defense. It was a
tough, physical game the referee
whistled for 35 fouls and handied out
three yellow cards apiece.
"We've got a lot of guys beaten up
from this game a lot of guys who
are very sore, [and] a couple of in
juries," Simon said.
Washington threw everything it
could at Stanford, determined to
break the rhythm that had been
building with the wins over UCLA
and Oregon State. Where the Cardi
nal had mostly looked in control on
Friday, it struggled to take charge
this time, allowing the Huskies to
dictate the pace and create the
chances.
"We didn't really have the sharp
ness or energy to hold on to the ball
for long stretches," Simon said.
"We'd make a pass or two, we'd im
mediately lose possession and [we'd]
find ourselves under pressure from a
long ball forward."
With both Washington and Ore

gon State coming off a week's break
and the Stanford team contending
with a long traveling schedule in
cluding a six-hour bus journey on
Saturday this was never going to
be an easy trip.
"That's our fourth weekend in a
row with two games and it's really
been a tremendous workload,"
Simon said. "I think today was the
day we hit the wall, but the guys were
mentally tough enough, and physi
cally strong enough to get through it
and get a result."
Next up is a well-deserved
breather before the team's final Pac
-10 match the Big Game at
home against California on Nov. 14.
The Bears have lost six games in the
Pac-10, likely ending their challenge
for an NCAA slot, but this won't
make them any less hungry to put a
dent in the Cardinal's season.
"This last game will be a big

game," Simon said. "[But now] we
need the break. We need a little rest."
