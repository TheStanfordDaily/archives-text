# EARNING A BREAK
## Stanford wins one and ties one in its final northern roadtrip

It's official: The Cardinal is back. After
racking up it's 10th win of the regular sea
son, the men's soccer team has brought
back memories of 2002, the last time they
won as many games, and the year they
reached the title game at the NCAAs.
The great results from before the start of
the Pacific-10 Conference schedule had
blown away the cobwebs from last year but,
until recently, it was tough to say where
Stanford (10-4-2, Pac-10 4-3-1) would place
this season. Now, after picking up four
points for a win against Oregon State (7-6-
2, Pac-10 3-4-0) and a draw against Wash

The game at Corvallis on Friday against
the Beavers started well for the Cardinal,

opportunity, bringing the game level and
risking a turn of the game's momentum.
"Up until that point we really had the
game under control," Simon said. "We were
creating the chances, we had the majority of
the possession and they really hadn't had a

GAME NOTES ! Cal has not earned a win since Oct.
11, but the cross-bay rivalry always makes soccer's
Big Game a heated rivalry. Stanford is coming off
two wins and a tie, and hopes that this momentum
will last through the teams' two weeks of deserved
rest. Come Big Game weekend, though, both
teams will be ready to go, as Stanford looks to im
prove its positioning before the postseason.
