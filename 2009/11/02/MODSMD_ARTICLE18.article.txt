### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's water polo team start
ed the Halloween weekend off with a bang, beating
No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara, 13-8.

"I think we played pretty well," said freshman
driver Paul Rudolph. "They are a good team and
we came out strong."

At the beginning of the match, senior driver
Drac Wigo was ejected, leaving UCSB with a 6-on
-5 advantage and helping the Gauchos earn the first
point of the game. Yet seconds later, it was Stanford
with the 6-on-5 advantage, and sophomore driver
Jacob Smith scored the first Cardinal goal at 6 min
utes, 58 seconds.

Later in the first period, sophomore utility Peter
Sefton and junior utility Jeffrey Schwimer were
also ejected, giving the Gauchos a rare 6-on-4 ad
vantage. UCSB's freshman utility Brian Shoemak
er attempted to score, but senior goalkeeper Jim
mie Sandman stopped the shot.
At 2:54, UCSB took the lead, as junior utility
Milos Golic snuck the ball into the net.

With only 34 seconds left, sophomore driver
Ryan Kent threw a quick pass to Rudolph, who
smashed the ball into the goal, making it a tie game
at 2-2 at the end of the first period.
The Cardinal picked up the pace in the second
period, taking a formidable lead with eight goals.
Schwimer made an impressive goal while heavily
guarded by two Gauchos, sneaking the ball straight
into the net.

A little later, with three Gauchos hovering by
the goal, Cardinal junior driver Cody Wiesen
skipped the ball between the UCSB defensemen
and found the net.

By the end of the second quarter, an enthusias
tic crowd helped Stanford to a 10-4 lead over the
Gauchos.

Stanford kept up its great defense throughout
the third quarter, with Sandman blocking almost
every Gaucho attempt and enabling the Cardinal
to maintain an 11-6 lead.

The final period was exceptionally fun the
crowd was feeling Stanford's momentum and it
seemed as if the Cardinal was unstoppable.
At 5:47, Drac Wigo shot a quick pass to Smith
who tossed the ball into the upper right hand cor
ner of the goal.

"Jacob Smith had a really good game," Sefton
said. "He had five goals and some really good
shots."

Close to the game's end, Pulido smashed the ball
into the UCSB goal. He raised a pointed index fin
ger after the score, letting the Cardinal fans know a
win was coming.

At about 1:33, freshman goalkeeper Scott Plat
shon got into the pool and played the rest of the
match, saving a goal at the game's finish.

The Cardinal finished the match with a 13-8 vic
tory, making Head Coach John Vargas extremely
pleased.

"He was happy about how we played," Sefton
said. "He was really happy since we haven't beaten
Santa Barbara in the past few years."
Last year, the Cardinal lost 5-4 against UCSB,
making this year's victory even sweeter.

GAME NOTES: No. 3 Stanford shouldn't get any trouble

from the No. 1 6 Aggies, who were roughed up by Cal in
an 1 1 -4 loss last week. UC-Davis has gone 2-6 in its last
eight outings, and a trip to Avery will not offer too friendly
an environment. The Cardinal also looks to extend a five
game win streak before taking on Long Beach State and
UC-lrvine over the weekend.
