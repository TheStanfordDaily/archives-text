# The
						ups and many downs of IM sports
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
C.C. Sabathia isn't going to win
three games in the World Se
ries, but other than that, my
predictions seem to be pretty
on point knock on wood.

Now on to this week's rant. This
one has been festering in my mind for
a while: intramural sports at Stanford
and all, or most, that is wrong with
them.

The column about how soft Stan
ford intramural sports are has already
been written. I agree with it whole
heartedly, but the problems with intra
murals extend well beyond their
touchy-feely nature.

Stanford intramurals are sort of
fun at best; when you actually play,
that is which is only about half the
time games are scheduled.
In basically every intramural
league, at least one team stops show
ing up to games, and usually more than
one. The reasons vary sometimes
teams are overmatched, or sometimes
there is an abundance of eagerness in
dorms at the beginning of the season,
which wanes as time passes.
One thing that is constant, howev
er, is the frustration of a team whose
opponent fails to show up. Stanford
students are busy, and they pay to play
intramurals, so not getting to play
games when you expect to really
stinks.

Which brings me to my next point:
You pay $3O to sign up an intramural
team, which amounts to only a few
dollars per player on a team, and this
makes showing up for games an incen
tive system.

Charge $lOO (or even more) for
each intramural team and if your team
doesn't forfeit a game all season, your
team gets $7O back after the season.
I'm no economics genius, but this
seems like a fairly simple system that
will encourage teams to sign up only
for leagues that they will actually show
up for.
With this kind of system, teams
won't have to worry about showing up
to the field or court and not having an
opponent. Plus, it will generate rev
enue.

There are issues once the games
start as well. It's never tasteful to criti
cize umpires and referees (and I have
both been an intramural referee and
complained to plenty of intramural
referees), but there needs to be some
sort of regulation as to who can be an
intramural official.

Everyone wants to make a buck in
college for food, beer, or whatever
else and intramural referees get
paid pretty well, so let's at least make
sure they know the rules.
I'm sorry, but one training session
isn't enough. Stanford students are
competitive, and putting referees out
there who are unsure of the rules and
cannot take control of a testy game is
irresponsible.
When two fraternities are squaring
off on the football field, having some
overmatched freshman out there as a
referee is ludicrous.The teams deserve
better refereeing and the referees
shouldn't have to be berated as they
ultimately always are.
This isn't to say everything about
intramurals is bad (although deciding
to start games at 5 p.m. after daylight
savings has ended is beyond stupid
just ask SAE or Sigma Chi).
Wallyball is a nice new game that
seems to be pretty popular. Students
also tend to enjoy the occasional tour
naments â€” like sand volleyball and
inner tube water polo but things
could definitely be better.
Having to watch the over-competi
tive business school teams pummel
freshman dorm teams that are com
posed of players literally 10 years
younger is painful, especially when the
graduate students are the ones com
plaining like middle-school kids to the
referees.
That is one thing that will never
change, unfortunately. The other is
sues, however, could easily be reme
died, and should be.
Students need an athletic outlet
like intramurals, and a university like
Stanford has all the resources anyone
could ever want (except a second
baseball diamond). So, let's do a better
job with intramurals, please.

Daniel Bohm wants intramurals to
charge more and offer a better venue for
competition at Stanford. Tell him there's
no fee for intramural midterms at
bohmd@stanford.edu.
