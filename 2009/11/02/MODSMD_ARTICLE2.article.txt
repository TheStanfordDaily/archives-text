## Event merges economy, energy policy 
### JOSEPH LEVENSON 
As the UN Conference on Climate Change
negotiations in Copenhagen approaches,
Stanford researchers stressed the importance of
approaching climate problems from both a scien
tific and economic perspective.
The Stanford Institute for Economic Policy
Research (SIEPR) hosted a policy forum enti
tled "Using Economics to Confront Climate
Change" on Friday. Leading experts in their
prospective fields, interested faculty and stu
dents gathered in Encina Hall to share ideas on
how to approach the energy problems of the
21st century.
Speakers from many disciplines were repre
sented at the policy forum and topics discussed
ranged from the rise of plug-in hybrids, to eco
nomic development and carbon policy, to using
the power of capitalism for positive change.
One of the topics on the agenda addressed
how to combine breakthrough technologies with
clever economic policy.
Don Wood '76, managing director of Draper
Fisher Jurvetson, an investment company with a
primary focus on clean-tech gave a
presentation entitled "Using Venture Capital to
Limit Climate Change... and Make Money."
He began his presentation with a nostalgic
look back at the 19705, when high fuel prices got
the United States "thinking green." A small,
clean-tech "boomlet" followed, which was later
cut short by the Reagan era, Wood said, refer
encing the symbolic removal of President
Carter's solar panels from the White House and
their subsequent relegation to life in a museum.
But, Wood asked, what makes the current
clean-tech "boomlet" different from its 1970s
predecessor?
He said he felt there were five powerful
forces at work today that make investment in
renewables and clean-tech a real possibility:
the need for new investment options apart
from incumbent companies, a heightened spir
it for environmental awareness, the emergence
of developing world markets, the lack of ener
gy security with oil and OPEC, and an
increased governmental stimulus for invest
ment in clean technologies.
Wood illustrated the many possibilities for
investment through his presentation of his own
company's ventures.
For example, Draper Fisher Jurvetson has
invested in the company Bright Source, which
has developed a technique to produce high tem
perature steam from the reflections of thou
sands of small mirrors. The steam is then piped
to a conventional turbine, which generates elec
tricity. The system is already proving extremely
effective in Israel's Negev Desert.
While Wood represented the side of ven
ture capitalists in promoting green technolo
gies, keynote speaker and Senior Advisor to
the Secretary of Energy Matt Rogers summa
rized the government's role in providing sound
infrastructure for these budding clean-tech
companies.

ment in new technologies into concrete
numbers. Of the $787 billion stimulus
package from the 2009 American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act, $338
million was set aside for geothermal
technologies, $1 billion for carbon cap
ture sequestration, $3O million for
hydro energies and $BOO million for bio
fuels.

There is still a strong need to invest
in infrastructure and technology to ere

ate platforms for long-term economic
growth, Rogers said. He believes the
key to success in those areas is to bring
in a set of fundamental disciplines and
foster collaboration in academia
between engineers, scientists and econ
omists.

In his speech, Rogers contrasted the
short- and long -term goals of the U.S.
Department of Energy. Currently, the
U.S. government is focused on job
recovery and economic restoration, yet
he acknowledged that in 10 years time,
the Department of Energy will be
judged on whether the U.S. can reclaim
leadership in innovation and renewable
energy.

"We are committed to doubling
renewable capacity over the next three
years," he said.
Overall, the policy forum gave
insights into the infrastructure prob
lems the U.S. still faces today and the
bright prospects in clean technology in
its future.

Though economic prospects may be
bleak, Wood sees the potential in pas
sionate students.

"The greatest ideas will come from
the youngest generation, from schools
like Stanford University," he said.
