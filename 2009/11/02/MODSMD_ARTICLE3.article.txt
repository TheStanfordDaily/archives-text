# Mausoleum Party revived
## Funding resolved, students celebrate annual tradition 
### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
Little Leland's legacy lives on with pride.
Bolstered by student support, the
Mausoleum Party rose from the dead this
year, to overcome funding obstacles.
"Everyone I talked to said it was far and
away the best Mausoleum Party ever," said
Evan Huck 'lO, one half of the DJ duo
Cattle√üanch, who DJ'd the party from a scis
sor lift 30 feet up in the air.
The Mausoleum itself provided the cen
terpiece for the party, lit up as a dramatic
backdrop to the outdoor dance floor and
adorned with colorful spinning lights. Since
last year's Mausoleum Party had to be relo
cated to Old Union due to rain, half of
Stanford undergraduates had never experi
enced a true Mausoleum Party before last
night.

Despite several last-minute changes
caused by the makeshift budget, most people
seemed excited just to be there, flailing cos
tumed arms and shaking hips in a treasured
Stanford tradition.

Costumes both crazy and conventional
filled the lot before the Mausoleum. Stanford
students worked in cultural references, cre
ative design and much of the risque
Halloween attire that teenagers everywhere
have to come to expect and love.
Several boys wore a sled all together as
the Jamaican bobsled team from "Cool
Runnings," sliding past Vendetta V's, Risky
Business boys in underwear and pirates, of
the Caribbean and elsewhere.

One Asian girl cleared a path with a paper
mache lizard tied to her back she was
"running from Godzilla."

As might be expected at Stanford, com
puter-related costumes drew in a multitude
of students. Several groups of Mario
Brothers characters ran around the party,
including six sophomores from Castano who
sewed much of their costumes from scratch.

One sophomore dressed as a Sim, a dia
mond-shaped green crystal bobbing above
his head.

A living iPod ad walked through the
crowd, wearing earbuds and a large neon

green-colored square behind his back. Two
or three students interpreted "Twitter" for
their costume needs and Facebook pages,
although slightly less popular than last year,
also roamed.

In a sign of the cultural ascendency of
Pixar, two boys and one pair of two girls, all
unrelated, dressed as the house from "Up"
with house costumes and balloons tied to
their backs.

While Stanford has often been referred to

as a mildly political campus at best, a doctor
holding a sign saying "Will Save Lives for
Food," with a sign on her back explaining,
"Doctor after Obama's healthcare plan,"
showed that on Flalloween some students
take the chance to make a statement.

A "Kobe Bryant rape case" costume
brought back the days of turmoil in 2003, as
a student wandered the party with a blow-up

Students in costume descended upon the Stanford family burial site for Stanford's annual Halloween tradition, the Mausoleum Party. After
averting a last-minute funding crisis, the party was pulled off with the requisite spinning lights, flying glow sticks and crazy costumes.
