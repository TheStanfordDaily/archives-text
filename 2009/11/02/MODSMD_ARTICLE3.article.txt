# Mausoleum Party revived
## Funding resolved, students celebrate annual tradition 
### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
Little Leland's legacy lives on with pride.
Bolstered by student support, the
Mausoleum Party rose from the dead this
year, to overcome funding obstacles.
"Everyone I talked to said it was far and
away the best Mausoleum Party ever," said
Evan Huck 'lO, one half of the DJ duo
Cattleßanch, who DJ'd the party from a scis
sor lift 30 feet up in the air.
The Mausoleum itself provided the cen
terpiece for the party, lit up as a dramatic
backdrop to the outdoor dance floor and
adorned with colorful spinning lights. Since
last year's Mausoleum Party had to be relo
cated to Old Union due to rain, half of
Stanford undergraduates had never experi
enced a true Mausoleum Party before last
night.

Despite several last-minute changes
caused by the makeshift budget, most people
seemed excited just to be there, flailing cos
tumed arms and shaking hips in a treasured
Stanford tradition.

Costumes both crazy and conventional
filled the lot before the Mausoleum. Stanford
students worked in cultural references, cre
ative design and much of the risque
Halloween attire that teenagers everywhere
have to come to expect and love.
Several boys wore a sled all together as
the Jamaican bobsled team from "Cool
Runnings," sliding past Vendetta V's, Risky
Business boys in underwear and pirates, of
the Caribbean and elsewhere.

One Asian girl cleared a path with a paper
mache lizard tied to her back she was
"running from Godzilla."

As might be expected at Stanford, com
puter-related costumes drew in a multitude
of students. Several groups of Mario
Brothers characters ran around the party,
including six sophomores from Castano who
sewed much of their costumes from scratch.

One sophomore dressed as a Sim, a dia
mond-shaped green crystal bobbing above
his head.

A living iPod ad walked through the
crowd, wearing earbuds and a large neon

green-colored square behind his back. Two
or three students interpreted "Twitter" for
their costume needs and Facebook pages,
although slightly less popular than last year,
also roamed.

In a sign of the cultural ascendency of
Pixar, two boys and one pair of two girls, all
unrelated, dressed as the house from "Up"
with house costumes and balloons tied to
their backs.

While Stanford has often been referred to

as a mildly political campus at best, a doctor
holding a sign saying "Will Save Lives for
Food," with a sign on her back explaining,
"Doctor after Obama's healthcare plan,"
showed that on Flalloween some students
take the chance to make a statement.

sex doll taped to his side.
And of course, in the honored
Fleet Street tradition, a God of
Partial Credit bestowed his blessing
on the Mausoleum Party in a saintly
robe and white beard.

"I had a laurel I made from plants
I picked myself outside, and wore old
'passed' and 'failed' blue books, from
me and my friends, around my waist"
said Clay Ramel 'l2. "I wore
Christmas lights that I powered from
a battery in my pocket and carried a
sign with the four commandments of
partial credit. It seemed to be a con
sistent favorite, so that was good."
Rather than professional DJs, stu
dent DJ duo Huck and Jess Lam 'lO
of Cattleßanch blasted nineties
songs and some classic rock mixed
with Top 40 favorites to keep the
Mausoleum bouncing.
"We wantfed] to make it less of a
frat party and more of a dance
party," Lam said. "Stanford DJs have
always been awful, so this year we
are glad to make it good."
Turning tables from a scissor lift
that took them 30 feet up in the air
midway through the party,
Cattleßanch also hurled a total of
3,000 glow sticks into the crowd.
Their songs kept people on the pave
ment until the last minute allowed,
said Junior Class Co-president Mona
Hadidi.

"You know how at the end of a
school dance there's five couples
slow dancing?" Hadidi said. "Here,

even at the end of the night people
were still trickling in —in the last
song people were still just raging."
Even a power outage at around
10:45 p.m. that cut the music off for
several minutes threatening a
reliving of 2007's disaster, when the
Mausoleum Party DJ lost power for
45 minutes did not faze the crowd.

"People kept singing the lyrics,
they picked it up a capella it was
pretty sweet," Huck said.
Problems with Marguerite capac
ity, however, were not so easy for
some to overlook, as the buses desig
nated to shuttle students to the party
quickly ran out of seats and got
mobbed by rowdy, costumed kids
blocking the road.
"We had to wait for a really long
time and then we got separated from
our friends when some made one bus
but half of them didn't," said Abby
Howard 'l3.
Even those who beat the mob to
claw their way onto the bus screamed
for their friends to be let on after the
doors had been closed. Outraged
cries of "My friend is out there!" and
"She's right there, right there in front,
just let her in!" filled the bus.
"I can't open the door again,
there are too many people!" yelled
one driver.

At the gates to the Mausoleum
Party, the mob scene continued as
many high school students, commu
nity members and even UC-
Berkeley students attempted to
sneak past the ID checkers. The jun
ior class presidents shot down intrud
er after intruder, many of whom
claimed to be naive, ID-less fresh
men.
"One girl said, 'I live in Robel,"'

Hadidi said, of a prepared but misin
formed high school student.
And, unfortunately for devotees
of IHUM Prof. Tobias Wolff, Hadidi
said "the resounding favorite IHUM
for non-Stanford students is
Journeys."
Student organizers are now look
ing toward next year's party. Budget
cuts have given the Mausoleum
Party's future a murky tinge and
unless drastic measures can succeed,
Leland Stanford, Jr.'s final resting
place may remain restful indeed.
"Now that the University has
indefinitely withdrawn its support..
what's worrying is next year," said
Varun Sivaram 'll, ASSU
Undergraduate Senate chair. "This
year was totally ad hoc —it can't
happen again."
Following their struggles, the jun
ior class advises 2012 to start plan
ning as soon as possible.
"My advice for next year's class,"
Hadidi said, "is that we weren't real
ly aware that we didn't have that
funding from the Absolute Fun fund,
so I am really hoping they can learn
from our experience, start lobbying
from the very beginning to the
ASSU Appropriates committee,
talking to all the class slates, talking
to the Greek community. With budg
et cuts there's no way it can be fully
funded.
"All facets of the Stanford com
munity will have to work together to
plan it," she added. "It's going to
require passion and commitment
from the student body to make this
go through."

At this year's Mausoleum Party, students in and out of costume danced to the beats of DJ duo Evan Huck '10 and
Jess Lam '10 of CattleRanch, who at one point in the night played music from 30 feet in the air atop a scissor lift.
Little Leland's legacy lives on with pride.
Bolstered by student support, the
Mausoleum Party rose from the dead this
year, to overcome funding obstacles.
"Everyone I talked to said it was far and
away the best Mausoleum Party ever," said
Evan Huck 'lO, one half of the DJ duo
Cattleßanch, who DJ'd the party from a scis
sor lift 30 feet up in the air.
The Mausoleum itself provided the cen
terpiece for the party, lit up as a dramatic
backdrop to the outdoor dance floor and
adorned with colorful spinning lights. Since
last year's Mausoleum Party had to be relo
cated to Old Union due to rain, half of
Stanford undergraduates had never experi
enced a true Mausoleum Party before last
night.

Despite several last-minute changes
caused by the makeshift budget, most people
seemed excited just to be there, flailing cos
tumed arms and shaking hips in a treasured
Stanford tradition.

Costumes both crazy and conventional
filled the lot before the Mausoleum. Stanford
students worked in cultural references, cre
ative design and much of the risque
Halloween attire that teenagers everywhere
have to come to expect and love.
Several boys wore a sled all together as
the Jamaican bobsled team from "Cool
Runnings," sliding past Vendetta V's, Risky
Business boys in underwear and pirates, of
the Caribbean and elsewhere.

One Asian girl cleared a path with a paper
mache lizard tied to her back she was
"running from Godzilla."

As might be expected at Stanford, com
puter-related costumes drew in a multitude
of students. Several groups of Mario
Brothers characters ran around the party,
including six sophomores from Castano who
sewed much of their costumes from scratch.

One sophomore dressed as a Sim, a dia
mond-shaped green crystal bobbing above
his head.

A living iPod ad walked through the
crowd, wearing earbuds and a large neon

green-colored square behind his back. Two
or three students interpreted "Twitter" for
their costume needs and Facebook pages,
although slightly less popular than last year,
also roamed.

In a sign of the cultural ascendency of
Pixar, two boys and one pair of two girls, all
unrelated, dressed as the house from "Up"
with house costumes and balloons tied to
their backs.

While Stanford has often been referred to

as a mildly political campus at best, a doctor
holding a sign saying "Will Save Lives for
Food," with a sign on her back explaining,
"Doctor after Obama's healthcare plan,"
showed that on Flalloween some students
take the chance to make a statement.

sex doll taped to his side.
And of course, in the honored
Fleet Street tradition, a God of
Partial Credit bestowed his blessing
on the Mausoleum Party in a saintly
robe and white beard.

"I had a laurel I made from plants
I picked myself outside, and wore old
'passed' and 'failed' blue books, from
me and my friends, around my waist"
said Clay Ramel 'l2. "I wore
Christmas lights that I powered from
a battery in my pocket and carried a
sign with the four commandments of
partial credit. It seemed to be a con
sistent favorite, so that was good."
Rather than professional DJs, stu
dent DJ duo Huck and Jess Lam 'lO
of Cattleßanch blasted nineties
songs and some classic rock mixed
with Top 40 favorites to keep the
Mausoleum bouncing.
"We wantfed] to make it less of a
frat party and more of a dance
party," Lam said. "Stanford DJs have
always been awful, so this year we
are glad to make it good."
Turning tables from a scissor lift
that took them 30 feet up in the air
midway through the party,
Cattleßanch also hurled a total of
3,000 glow sticks into the crowd.
Their songs kept people on the pave
ment until the last minute allowed,
said Junior Class Co-president Mona
Hadidi.

"You know how at the end of a
school dance there's five couples
slow dancing?" Hadidi said. "Here,

even at the end of the night people
were still trickling in —in the last
song people were still just raging."
Even a power outage at around
10:45 p.m. that cut the music off for
several minutes threatening a
reliving of 2007's disaster, when the
Mausoleum Party DJ lost power for
45 minutes did not faze the crowd.

"People kept singing the lyrics,
they picked it up a capella it was
pretty sweet," Huck said.
Problems with Marguerite capac
ity, however, were not so easy for
some to overlook, as the buses desig
nated to shuttle students to the party
quickly ran out of seats and got
mobbed by rowdy, costumed kids
blocking the road.
"We had to wait for a really long
time and then we got separated from
our friends when some made one bus
but half of them didn't," said Abby
Howard 'l3.
Even those who beat the mob to
claw their way onto the bus screamed
for their friends to be let on after the
doors had been closed. Outraged
cries of "My friend is out there!" and
"She's right there, right there in front,
just let her in!" filled the bus.
"I can't open the door again,
there are too many people!" yelled
one driver.

At the gates to the Mausoleum
Party, the mob scene continued as
many high school students, commu
nity members and even UC-
Berkeley students attempted to
sneak past the ID checkers. The jun
ior class presidents shot down intrud
er after intruder, many of whom
claimed to be naive, ID-less fresh
men.
"One girl said, 'I live in Robel,"'

Hadidi said, of a prepared but misin
formed high school student.
And, unfortunately for devotees
of IHUM Prof. Tobias Wolff, Hadidi
said "the resounding favorite IHUM
for non-Stanford students is
Journeys."
Student organizers are now look
ing toward next year's party. Budget
cuts have given the Mausoleum
Party's future a murky tinge and
unless drastic measures can succeed,
Leland Stanford, Jr.'s final resting
place may remain restful indeed.
"Now that the University has
indefinitely withdrawn its support..
what's worrying is next year," said
Varun Sivaram 'll, ASSU
Undergraduate Senate chair. "This
year was totally ad hoc —it can't
happen again."
Following their struggles, the jun
ior class advises 2012 to start plan
ning as soon as possible.
"My advice for next year's class,"
Hadidi said, "is that we weren't real
ly aware that we didn't have that
funding from the Absolute Fun fund,
so I am really hoping they can learn
from our experience, start lobbying
from the very beginning to the
ASSU Appropriates committee,
talking to all the class slates, talking
to the Greek community. With budg
et cuts there's no way it can be fully
funded.
"All facets of the Stanford com
munity will have to work together to
plan it," she added. "It's going to
require passion and commitment
from the student body to make this
go through."
