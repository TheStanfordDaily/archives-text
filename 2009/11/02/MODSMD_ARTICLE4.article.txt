The Cardinal women earned their
18th and 19th consecutive victories of
2009 over the Arizona schools last
weekend, continuing their perfect sea
son and clinching at least a share of the
Pacific-10 Conference title. Senior
Kelley O'Hara set a school record for
points in a single season with a goal
and an assist on Sunday, while fresh
man Mariah Nogueria put in a goal
each game, as the Cardinal defeated
Arizona State, 3-1, and shut out
Arizona, 4-0.
Friday night started off with a tech
nical glitch the national anthem did
not start playing on the loudspeakers,

leading to an impromptu a cappella
performance from fans and players
but there was no glitch in Stanford's
game. The Card flew out of the gates
against ASU, and got off to a dream
start courtesy of two freshmen. In the
third minute, freshman right back
Rachel Quon sent a beautiful cross
into the box from the right side, and
freshman midfielder Mariah Nogueira
overpowered her marker to head it
into the net.

It looked like more goals were to
follow, as Stanford continued putting
on the pressure, but the match went
into the half at 1-0. However, a second
goal would come only three minutes
into the second half. Sophomore

GAME NOTES: Stanford soccer meets Cal for the
first time this season in the team's final game.
The Bears have lost four of eight Pac-10 match
ups, but all of the defeats have been by a sin
gle goal, and two went to overtime. Cal is also
coming off consecutive wins over the Arizona
schools and would like nothing more than to
end Stanford's red-hot, season-long win streak.

CAL


Lindsay Taylor playing as a central
attacking midfielder, as Ratcliffe
went with four forwards on the field
chipped a ball over the top to
Christen Press, and the junior forward
ran onto it and sent the ball back
across goal. Freshman Courtney Ver
loo, who had taken Taylor's usual
starting forward spot, finished from
close range to make it 2-0.
After Verloo's goal, three of the
four players who had participated in
scoring for Stanford were freshmen,
with goals by Nogueira and Verloo
and an assist by Quon, who would
soon add another.

"The freshmen are growing in
confidence and growing better and
better, and really becoming leaders
on the field," said Stanford Head
Coach Paul Ratcliffe of his 2013 class.
"They're no longer freshmen as far as
I'm concerned, and they've played
enough games where they're veter
ans. Like all us, they'll have to pick up
the pace and keep playing well."
The Cardinal was seemingly on
cruise control, although it did re
ceive a scare four minutes from the
final whistle. Junior goalkeeper Kira
Maker couldn't control the slippery
ball on a shot by the Sun Devils' red
shirt freshman Courtney Tinnin, and
the ball bounced over the line for a
goal. Yet Stanford responded and
iced the game one minute later, with
Quon once again sending in a per
fect ball from the right and junior
Morgan Redman finishing with a
well-placed header to put the final
score at 3-1.

The Card returned to Cagan Sta
dium yesterday afternoon to take on
Arizona, and after a bit of a slow
start, the Stanford attack began to
come alive, mostly through Press. In
the 14th minute, the junior forced
Wildcat redshirt senior keeper
Devon Wharf into a diving save from
the top of the box, with Wharf getting
just enough on it to push it against
the right post. One minute later,
Press hit the opposite post from the
left side.

When the goal finally arrived 25
minutes in, Press offered the assist.
The forward swung in a corner kick
and once again Nogueira opened up
the scoring, with the freshman plant
ing an unmarked header past Wharf
to make it 1-0.
The Cardinal made it 2-0 in the
33rd minute, when senior center
back Alicia Jenkins sent a long ball
over the Arizona backline. O'Hara
ran onto it and deftly lobbed the
keeper on a half volley.
Stanford was firmly in control at
this point, making it 3-0 just 13 min
utes into the second half. O'Hara
lofted a through ball to Press, who
beat the offsides trap and held off
multiple defenders to slot the ball
into the net. The assist gave O'Hara
the school record for points in a sin
gle season, and her earlier goal tied
her for the top spot on the single-sea
son goals list.
"Kelley O'Hara's been fantastic
the entire season, and I'm so proud
of her that she broke the single-sea

son record," Ratcliffe commented.
"She deserves it, and she's also get
ting really good assists like she did
today, so to me she's just been doing
really great all year and I'm very
proud of her."
The scoring was finished when
two subs combined in the 83rd
minute senior Kristin Stannard
collected the ball on the right and
beat a defender to get to the endline
before whipping in a pinpoint cross.
Sophomore Teresa Noyola planted a
powerful header into the goal to
make it 4-0.

The four-goal margin of victory
was the biggest for Stanford thus far
in conference play. Noyola, whose
end-of-game score made it so, was
pleased with her team's effort, but
was convinced of the Card's greater
potential.

"I'm not sure that was our best
game, even with the score," Noyola
said. "The first half was a little slow,
but we picked it up toward the end of

the first and picked up in the second
half. Mariah's goal was really key at
the time and gave us our momentum.
Overall, it was one of our better per
formances, but not the best. There's
room to improve, definitely."

The win also ensures that Stan
ford will share at least part of the
Pac-10 title, and will have to win it
outright with a victory over rival Cal
ifornia next weekend.

"It's a good feeling it's not easy
to win the Pac-10 title," Ratcliffe
said. "That being said, we do want to
be the only winners we don't want
to share it, so we're going to come out
next weekend and fire it up against
Berkeley."

Stanford hosts the Golden Bears
next Sunday at Laird Q. Cagan Stadi
um at 1 p.m. The game will be tele
vised on FSC.
