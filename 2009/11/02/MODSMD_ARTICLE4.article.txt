The Cardinal women earned their
18th and 19th consecutive victories of
2009 over the Arizona schools last
weekend, continuing their perfect sea
son and clinching at least a share of the
Pacific-10 Conference title. Senior
Kelley O'Hara set a school record for
points in a single season with a goal
and an assist on Sunday, while fresh
man Mariah Nogueria put in a goal
each game, as the Cardinal defeated
Arizona State, 3-1, and shut out
Arizona, 4-0.
Friday night started off with a tech
nical glitch the national anthem did
not start playing on the loudspeakers,

leading to an impromptu a cappella
performance from fans and players
but there was no glitch in Stanford's
game. The Card flew out of the gates
against ASU, and got off to a dream
start courtesy of two freshmen. In the
third minute, freshman right back
Rachel Quon sent a beautiful cross
into the box from the right side, and
freshman midfielder Mariah Nogueira
overpowered her marker to head it
into the net.

It looked like more goals were to
follow, as Stanford continued putting
on the pressure, but the match went
into the half at 1-0. However, a second
goal would come only three minutes
into the second half. Sophomore

GAME NOTES: Stanford soccer meets Cal for the
first time this season in the team's final game.
The Bears have lost four of eight Pac-10 match
ups, but all of the defeats have been by a sin
gle goal, and two went to overtime. Cal is also
coming off consecutive wins over the Arizona
schools and would like nothing more than to
end Stanford's red-hot, season-long win streak.
