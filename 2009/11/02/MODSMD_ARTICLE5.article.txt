## FROM THE TABLE TO THE TRASH We all know what happens to the food you eat. But what about the food you don't eat? 
### LAUREN KUBIAK 
Perched precariously atop a barbed wire
fence, John Mulrow looks down and
surveys the scene. Several dumpsters
nearly overflowing with just-expired
food enter his field of vision, and he
jumps down into the courtyard. Picking up a
black trash bag stuffed with spoiled meats, he
smells it, wrinkles his nose and tosses it back on
the pile.
Digging further, he finds several tubs of ice
cream. He picks one up and liquid cream pours
out.
"Ugh, four hours too late," he remarks.
As he continues to search for discarded treas
ures in the grocery store dumpster, he finds wilt
ed lettuce, shredded celery and rotten tomatoes.
Finally, he finds what he came searching for: a
sack filled with several baguettes. Success
he'll be able to eat bread this week.
No, Mulrow is not a homeless man scaveng
ing for his next meal. He is an environmentalist
and the former president of Students for a
Sustainable Stanford (SSS), a coalition aiming to
reduce Stanford's consumption of resources.
By consuming foods that are produced or
salvaged locally, Mulrow conserves trans
portation fuel and limits food waste. His
method? Dumpster diving, or taking advantage
of food thrown away by restaurants and grocery
stores, most of which has only recently expired
and is still edible.
The Problem
According to the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), 27
percent of the food produced in and for
the United States is wasted. A portion of
the wasted food is salvaged or composted,
but the vast majority of it ends up in land
fills, where it emits greenhouse gases and
contributes to global warming.
Mulrow isn't alone in his drive to fight
the problem. Stanford too recognizes the
severity of this environmental issue and is
thus making efforts to reduce the amount
of food that ends up in landfills.
In order to accomplish this goal,
Stanford has implemented different pro
grams that limit the amount of excess food
produced and wasted on campus. These
measures include sustainable dining initia
tives, food donation programs and a com
post program.

To reduce the amount of food going to
landfills, the first challenge that Stanford
must tackle is reducing the amount of
excess food produced in the first place.
Dining halls are a good place to start, due
to the large-scale production of food
the waste of which Stanford Dining has
been working hard to combat.

The Program
One of Stanford Dining's Eat Well ini
tiatives is the Love Food Hate Waste pro
gram.

"[The program] creatfes] sustainable
dining for the campus community," said
Executive Director Eric Montell in an e
mail to The Daily.
The initiative, through education and
outreach, encourages students to use
smaller plates and to go trayless.
"We are focused on reducing food
waste [and] educating students about mak
ing healthy food choices and appropriate
portioning for wellness," Montell said.
While Stanford Dining has been working
toward sustainability for quite some time, the
trayless pilot program was just implemented
this fall in Wilbur and Stern Dining.
"We started last year with a voluntary
trayless program in all of the dining halls
to encourage students to take a tray if they
need one," Montell explained.
At the end of the year, a survey was
conducted showing a majority of students
in favor of a trayless dining program.
"Wilbur and Stern were picked as two
pilot dining halls since they primarily
house freshman who would be unbiased to
using a tray," Montell continued. "It is too
early to tell if this has had an overall
impact on food waste. This will be
reviewed more closely at the end of the fall
quarter."
While the trayless both pilot and vol
untary programs have yet to return
quantifiable data, Florence Moore Dining
Chef Nijo Joseph says he has seen a reduc
tion in the amount of food waste produced
at his dining hall.
"Stanford Dining is doing a good job,"
he said.

Still, larger dining halls continue to pre
pare excess food, despite the success of the
Love Food Hate Waste campaign. That's
where the Stanford Project on Hunger
(SPOON) comes in.

SPOON's student volunteers take the

food to a freezer, where it is picked up by
the Palo Alto Opportunity Center, a local
homeless center. SPOON's project also
cuts down on the amount of food available
to dumpster divers like Mulrow.
SPOON salvages unserved food, but
much of the excess food prepared on cam
pus does not fall into that category. Rather,
it is spoiled or contaminated, and so mem
bers of the Stanford community dispose of
the food in either a trash can or compost
bin. If deposited in a compost bin, the
nutrients will be recycled.

How Composting Works
During the composting process,
microbes assist in the biodegradation, or
breakdown, of organic matter such as
foods and yard trimmings. The end product
of composting compost is a nutrient
rich organic matter that is used as a soil
additive or fertilizer.

Stanford first implemented a compost
program in January of 2003. The pilot pro
gram began at Stern Dining when
Stanford's waste service, Peninsula
Sanitary Service, Inc. (PSSI) began collect
ing organic waste separately from the recy
clables and garbage.
Soon after, compost collection spread
to the other six dining halls on campus.
Since then, row houses, as well as larger
cafes, such as the Faculty Club, have been
added to the compost program.
Composting at Stanford diverts approx
imately 186 tons of organic waste each
month, according to Julie Muir, Stanford's
recycling program manager. That number
continues to increase as Stanford expands
the composting program to smaller cafes,

and 29 cafes currently have access to a
compost bin.
However, incorporating the smaller
cafes has been harder than originally antic
ipated, said Muir, due to the logistics of
collection and transportation.
PSSI trucks collect waste and yard trim
mings from around campus. They transport
the organic materials to Newby Island, a
compost center in Milpitas that also hous
es a landfill and recycling center.
Once the organic waste arrives at
Newby Island, contaminants mostly
plastics are removed by hand. Then the
material travels through the chute of a
chipper, and fountains of shredded organic
matter spew out the top, ready to begin
decomposing.
Once the material is shredded, tractors
move it to eight-foot tall rows, which
resemble the uniformly spaced mounds of
strawberry fields. The compost piles sit for
90 to 180 days, during which they are
turned over in order to allow the microbes
to sufficiently decompose the material.
At the end of the cycle, landscapers buy
much of the compost. Stanford also
reclaims half of what they sent, using the
finished product for groundskeeping on
campus.

Moving Forward
The composting program has taken a
sizable bite out of Stanford's food waste
problem. Still, there's room for improve
ment.

"I don't think it's the best we can do,"
Muir said.

Moving compost to and from Newby
Island has high transportation costs, both

environmental and economic. Also, despite
the raising awareness of compost on cam
pus, 28 percent of the waste on campus still
comes from organics, according to a recent
waste audit conducted by Muir.
"It's the ultimate waste of a resource,"
Muir said when discussing the logistical
hurdle of collecting from 600 buildings.
"The energy that went into producing the
food gets thrown away."
Meanwhile, food that could have been
recycled to provide nutrients to grow new
plants instead decays in landfills. There, it
emits methane, a greenhouse gas 23 times
more potent than carbon dioxide.

In order to curb the landfill methane
emissions and to create a more sustainable
Stanford, Muir, Dining and SSS have been
working to improve the composting pro
gram.

"There are opportunities to compost
small volumes of food waste on campus
and we are in fact starting to do this,"
Montell said. "We are currently diverting
coffee grounds from Tresidder and [the]
Alumni Cafe."

The coffee grounds provide an excel
lent source of nitrogen for soils in dining
hall gardens and on the Stanford
Community Farm, while small, on-campus
composting efforts have the potential to
expand exponentially.
"We're working with several students
to understand whether and how we might
divert and compost a greater amount of
campus food waste at the Community
Farm," Montell explained. "We're hoping
to pilot a small program by the end of this
year."

Another on-campus composting option

that Muir has considered is utilization of a
methane digester machine. The digester
would produce â€”in addition to compost
high-energy gases such as methane. The
methane could then become a source of
alternative energy, rather than an atmos
pheric pollutant.
"It's the best of both worlds," Muir said.

While the methane digester would
indeed solve many logistical problems and
make urban composting more feasible, it is
still a long way off.
"It's mostly a conversation piece so
far," Muir explained.
The digesters would be too expensive
for the University to develop in the poor
economic conditions, so the detailed plans
of the machines have not been completely
discussed, Muir explained. Still, Stanford
aims for a zero waste campus.
If reached, Stanford's zero waste goal
would make Mulrow's bread dumpster
dives much less lucrative. Cornucopias of
baguettes won't sit free atop other discard
ed items. But perhaps Mulrow won't need
to turn to the dumpster for his sustainable,
locally salvaged bread in the future.
As Dining, Muir and SSS continue to
tackle food waste issues, Stanford will
become more effective in conserving food
and nutrients. The programs may even
encourage locally produced bread.
As a result, Mulrow will be able to pur
chase his baguettes instead of risking his
life and legal record for them.
Trespassing for the sake of sustainability
can only be sustainable for so long.

To reduce the amount of food going to
landfills, the first challenge that Stanford
must tackle is reducing the amount of
excess food produced in the first place.
Dining halls are a good place to start, due
to the large-scale production of food
the waste of which Stanford Dining has
been working hard to combat.

The Program
One of Stanford Dining's Eat Well ini
tiatives is the Love Food Hate Waste pro
gram.

"[The program] creatfes] sustainable
dining for the campus community," said
Executive Director Eric Montell in an e
mail to The Daily.
The initiative, through education and
outreach, encourages students to use
smaller plates and to go trayless.
"We are focused on reducing food
waste [and] educating students about mak
ing healthy food choices and appropriate
portioning for wellness," Montell said.
While Stanford Dining has been working
toward sustainability for quite some time, the
trayless pilot program was just implemented
this fall in Wilbur and Stern Dining.
"We started last year with a voluntary
trayless program in all of the dining halls
to encourage students to take a tray if they
need one," Montell explained.
At the end of the year, a survey was
conducted showing a majority of students
in favor of a trayless dining program.
"Wilbur and Stern were picked as two
pilot dining halls since they primarily
house freshman who would be unbiased to
using a tray," Montell continued. "It is too
early to tell if this has had an overall
impact on food waste. This will be
reviewed more closely at the end of the fall
quarter."
While the trayless both pilot and vol
untary programs have yet to return
quantifiable data, Florence Moore Dining
Chef Nijo Joseph says he has seen a reduc
tion in the amount of food waste produced
at his dining hall.
"Stanford Dining is doing a good job,"
he said.

Still, larger dining halls continue to pre
pare excess food, despite the success of the
Love Food Hate Waste campaign. That's
where the Stanford Project on Hunger
(SPOON) comes in.

SPOON's student volunteers take the

food to a freezer, where it is picked up by
the Palo Alto Opportunity Center, a local
homeless center. SPOON's project also
cuts down on the amount of food available
to dumpster divers like Mulrow.
SPOON salvages unserved food, but
much of the excess food prepared on cam
pus does not fall into that category. Rather,
it is spoiled or contaminated, and so mem
bers of the Stanford community dispose of
the food in either a trash can or compost
bin. If deposited in a compost bin, the
nutrients will be recycled.

How Composting Works
During the composting process,
microbes assist in the biodegradation, or
breakdown, of organic matter such as
foods and yard trimmings. The end product
of composting compost is a nutrient
rich organic matter that is used as a soil
additive or fertilizer.

Stanford first implemented a compost
program in January of 2003. The pilot pro
gram began at Stern Dining when
Stanford's waste service, Peninsula
Sanitary Service, Inc. (PSSI) began collect
ing organic waste separately from the recy
clables and garbage.
Soon after, compost collection spread
to the other six dining halls on campus.
Since then, row houses, as well as larger
cafes, such as the Faculty Club, have been
added to the compost program.
Composting at Stanford diverts approx
imately 186 tons of organic waste each
month, according to Julie Muir, Stanford's
recycling program manager. That number
continues to increase as Stanford expands
the composting program to smaller cafes,

and 29 cafes currently have access to a
compost bin.
However, incorporating the smaller
cafes has been harder than originally antic
ipated, said Muir, due to the logistics of
collection and transportation.
PSSI trucks collect waste and yard trim
mings from around campus. They transport
the organic materials to Newby Island, a
compost center in Milpitas that also hous
es a landfill and recycling center.
Once the organic waste arrives at
Newby Island, contaminants mostly
plastics are removed by hand. Then the
material travels through the chute of a
chipper, and fountains of shredded organic
matter spew out the top, ready to begin
decomposing.
Once the material is shredded, tractors
move it to eight-foot tall rows, which
resemble the uniformly spaced mounds of
strawberry fields. The compost piles sit for
90 to 180 days, during which they are
turned over in order to allow the microbes
to sufficiently decompose the material.
At the end of the cycle, landscapers buy
much of the compost. Stanford also
reclaims half of what they sent, using the
finished product for groundskeeping on
campus.

Moving Forward
The composting program has taken a
sizable bite out of Stanford's food waste
problem. Still, there's room for improve
ment.

"I don't think it's the best we can do,"
Muir said.

Moving compost to and from Newby
Island has high transportation costs, both

environmental and economic. Also, despite
the raising awareness of compost on cam
pus, 28 percent of the waste on campus still
comes from organics, according to a recent
waste audit conducted by Muir.
"It's the ultimate waste of a resource,"
Muir said when discussing the logistical
hurdle of collecting from 600 buildings.
"The energy that went into producing the
food gets thrown away."
Meanwhile, food that could have been
recycled to provide nutrients to grow new
plants instead decays in landfills. There, it
emits methane, a greenhouse gas 23 times
more potent than carbon dioxide.

In order to curb the landfill methane
emissions and to create a more sustainable
Stanford, Muir, Dining and SSS have been
working to improve the composting pro
gram.

"There are opportunities to compost
small volumes of food waste on campus
and we are in fact starting to do this,"
Montell said. "We are currently diverting
coffee grounds from Tresidder and [the]
Alumni Cafe."

The coffee grounds provide an excel
lent source of nitrogen for soils in dining
hall gardens and on the Stanford
Community Farm, while small, on-campus
composting efforts have the potential to
expand exponentially.
"We're working with several students
to understand whether and how we might
divert and compost a greater amount of
campus food waste at the Community
Farm," Montell explained. "We're hoping
to pilot a small program by the end of this
year."

Another on-campus composting option

that Muir has considered is utilization of a
methane digester machine. The digester
would produce â€”in addition to compost
high-energy gases such as methane. The
methane could then become a source of
alternative energy, rather than an atmos
pheric pollutant.
"It's the best of both worlds," Muir said.

While the methane digester would
indeed solve many logistical problems and
make urban composting more feasible, it is
still a long way off.
"It's mostly a conversation piece so
far," Muir explained.
The digesters would be too expensive
for the University to develop in the poor
economic conditions, so the detailed plans
of the machines have not been completely
discussed, Muir explained. Still, Stanford
aims for a zero waste campus.
If reached, Stanford's zero waste goal
would make Mulrow's bread dumpster
dives much less lucrative. Cornucopias of
baguettes won't sit free atop other discard
ed items. But perhaps Mulrow won't need
to turn to the dumpster for his sustainable,
locally salvaged bread in the future.
As Dining, Muir and SSS continue to
tackle food waste issues, Stanford will
become more effective in conserving food
and nutrients. The programs may even
encourage locally produced bread.
As a result, Mulrow will be able to pur
chase his baguettes instead of risking his
life and legal record for them.
Trespassing for the sake of sustainability
can only be sustainable for so long.

Perched precariously atop a barbed wire
fence, John Mulrow looks down and
surveys the scene. Several dumpsters
nearly overflowing with just-expired
food enter his field of vision, and he
jumps down into the courtyard. Picking up a
black trash bag stuffed with spoiled meats, he
smells it, wrinkles his nose and tosses it back on
the pile.
Digging further, he finds several tubs of ice
cream. He picks one up and liquid cream pours
out.
"Ugh, four hours too late," he remarks.
As he continues to search for discarded treas
ures in the grocery store dumpster, he finds wilt
ed lettuce, shredded celery and rotten tomatoes.
Finally, he finds what he came searching for: a
sack filled with several baguettes. Success
he'll be able to eat bread this week.
No, Mulrow is not a homeless man scaveng
ing for his next meal. He is an environmentalist
and the former president of Students for a
Sustainable Stanford (SSS), a coalition aiming to
reduce Stanford's consumption of resources.
By consuming foods that are produced or
salvaged locally, Mulrow conserves trans
portation fuel and limits food waste. His
method? Dumpster diving, or taking advantage
of food thrown away by restaurants and grocery
stores, most of which has only recently expired
and is still edible.
The Problem
According to the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), 27
percent of the food produced in and for
the United States is wasted. A portion of
the wasted food is salvaged or composted,
but the vast majority of it ends up in land
fills, where it emits greenhouse gases and
contributes to global warming.
Mulrow isn't alone in his drive to fight
the problem. Stanford too recognizes the
severity of this environmental issue and is
thus making efforts to reduce the amount
of food that ends up in landfills.
In order to accomplish this goal,
Stanford has implemented different pro
grams that limit the amount of excess food
produced and wasted on campus. These
measures include sustainable dining initia
tives, food donation programs and a com
post program.
