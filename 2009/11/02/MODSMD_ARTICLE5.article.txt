## FROM THE TABLE TO THE TRASH We all know what happens to the food you eat. But what about the food you don't eat? 
### LAUREN KUBIAK 
Perched precariously atop a barbed wire
fence, John Mulrow looks down and
surveys the scene. Several dumpsters
nearly overflowing with just-expired
food enter his field of vision, and he
jumps down into the courtyard. Picking up a
black trash bag stuffed with spoiled meats, he
smells it, wrinkles his nose and tosses it back on
the pile.
Digging further, he finds several tubs of ice
cream. He picks one up and liquid cream pours
out.
"Ugh, four hours too late," he remarks.
As he continues to search for discarded treas
ures in the grocery store dumpster, he finds wilt
ed lettuce, shredded celery and rotten tomatoes.
Finally, he finds what he came searching for: a
sack filled with several baguettes. Success
he'll be able to eat bread this week.
No, Mulrow is not a homeless man scaveng
ing for his next meal. He is an environmentalist
and the former president of Students for a
Sustainable Stanford (SSS), a coalition aiming to
reduce Stanford's consumption of resources.
By consuming foods that are produced or
salvaged locally, Mulrow conserves trans
portation fuel and limits food waste. His
method? Dumpster diving, or taking advantage
of food thrown away by restaurants and grocery
stores, most of which has only recently expired
and is still edible.
