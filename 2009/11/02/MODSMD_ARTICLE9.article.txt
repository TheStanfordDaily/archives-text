# SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING
## Campus encourages tech ventures 
### TYLER BROWN 
Silicon Valley is a hotbed for the
technology industry and Stanford has
long been at its center. Stanford affili
ates have founded or co-founded
more than 20 billion-dollar technolo
gy companies, including Hewlett-
Packard, e√üay, Google and Yahoo.
The Stanford Technology Ventures
Program (STVP) aims to teach
Stanford students the skills they need
to keep the successes coming.
"We try to teach students how to
see opportunities where other people
always see problems," said STVP
Marketing and Communications
Director Theresa Stevens.

STVP is housed in the department
of management science and engineer
ing (MS&E), but a wide range of
undergraduate and graduate students
can take classes offered through
STVP. Dean of the School of
Engineering Jim Plummer considers
it a University-wide program.
"I believe entrepreneurship is fun
damental to any good education, not
just an engineering education,"
Plummer wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily.

Within its overarching mission of
spreading entrepreneurship educa
tion, Stevens said that STVP has three
main focuses: teaching, research and
outreach.

Stevens reports that one of STVP's
most popular courses is the weekly
Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders lec
ture series, which recently featured
Craig Barrett, former chairman and
chief executive of Intel Corporation
and Greg Papadopoulos, the chief
technology officer at Sun
Microsystems, Inc.
The next lecture, at Memorial

Auditorium on Nov. 4, will kick off
STVP's Global Innovation
Tournament, a competition that
Stevens says is designed to simulate
the "entrepreneurial experience." The
lecture will spotlight music industry
producer Quincy Jones 111 and
Grammy award-winning hip-hop
artist Hakeem Seriki, known by his
stage name "Chamillionaire," speak
ing on the combined future of the
technology and music industries.
STVP also offers the Mayfield
Fellows program, a nine-month inten
sive work-study program in manage
ment science that admits 12 Stanford
undergraduates per year from any
major. It includes two quarters of
study and a summer internship with a
Bay Area start-up.

STVP Co-Director and MS&E
Prof. Kathy Eisenhardt said that some
of the most significant studies occur
ring at STVP focus on the relative suc
cesses of firms in the solar industry,
the effects of different types of fund
ing sources on start-ups in the medical
devices industry and how public poli
cy affects entrepreneurship in China.
One finding was of particular inter
est: Many successful solar ventures
were founded by people who had lit
tle, if any, previous experience in solar
at all.

STVP's outreach includes leading
the Stanford Entrepreneurship
Network (SEN), a collection of differ
ent entrepreneurship groups on cam
pus. SEN hosts "Entrepreneurship
Week" in February each year, which
includes a career fair, workshops,
speakers, roundtables and networking
events.

"It's a great way to dive in without
a curricular long-term commitment,"
Stevens said.

STVP also has an international
outreach program that puts together
conferences for entrepreneurship
educators across the world.

"Our goal is to accelerate high
technology entrepreneurship educa
tion and to create scholarly research
on technology-based firms,"
Eisenhardt said. "Really, what we're
trying to do is get students the busi
ness skills that they need to go out and
understand the business environment
in which they will be operating."
Linda Wells, director of the
Graduate School of Business' Center
for Entrepreneurial Studies, said, "I
think [STVP has] their finger on the
pulse of what's going on in terms of
entrepreneurship education."

Three directors and a core team
administer STVP day to day. The
STVP advisory board, which meets
twice yearly to advise the directors,
consists of 14 professionals and six
Stanford faculty members, including
Plummer and Graduate School of
Business Dean Garth Saloner.

The organization is funded with a
combination of research grants from
the National Science Foundation, con
tributions from alumni donors and
donations from local venture capital
and technology companies. Stanford
pays the faculty salaries and offers
support to the Ph.D students.
"Entrepreneurship is fundamen
tally away of looking at life and at the
problems and opportunities that life
presents," Plummer said. "[lt] is basi
cally the view that anything is possible
and that individuals can make a differ
ence in any problem they choose to
tackle,"
