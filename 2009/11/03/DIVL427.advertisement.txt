Stanford Pioneers in Science
A quarterly series celebrating the scientific contributions and lives of Stanford
faculty members who have been awarded Nobel Prizes, National Medals of
Science or Technology, and Mac Arthur Fellowships.
William H. Durham
Creator of the coevolutionary approach to human diversity
In addition to being a "rock star" teacher of undergraduates at Stanford and a favorite
faculty leader of Alumni Travel/Study excursions, Bill Durham is an internationally
acclaimed human ecologist and has won the prestigious Mac Arthur Fellowship
("genius grant") in 1983. Among Durham's specialties is indigenous ecotourism, and his
contributions to this field include co-founding the Center for Responsible Travel and
establishing a series of Field Seminars in the Stanford Alumni Travel/Study Program.

Professor of Biology, Benjamin Scott Crocker Professor of Human Biology, and an
internationally recognized expert in the evolution of the visual and nervous systems in
living organisms.
