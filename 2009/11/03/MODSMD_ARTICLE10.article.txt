## EDITORIAL Funding prioritization needs greater transparency 
### 
Last week, the Stanford Historical Soci
ety hosted an event called "What Does
the Board of Trustees Actually Do?"
An interesting presentation, led by current
Board Chair Leslie Hume and former Chair
Burt McMurty, provided insight into the col
lection of 35 individuals who govern Stan
ford University. A great love and desire to
serve Stanford was said to be the only criteria
for a potential trustee appointee. Well, the
fact is that many students also feel deeply
passionate about our campus, and the Edito
rial Board believes greater transparency re
garding trustee and administrative work
would give the student body necessary in
sight into how the University prioritizes
funding.

operating budget. While feeling the pinch of
the endowment stems inevitably from trou
bled economic times, little of the financial
prioritization of available funds is made open
to the student body. More specific informa
tion regarding the metrics and finances of the
Vice Provost of Student Affairs, the Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education and
the newer office of the Vice Provost of Grad
uate Education would do much to inform the
broader Stanford community about how the
University is prioritizing programs and issues
most relevant to students.

The ASSU is providing a great service to
the student body through its series of town
hall events.The latest allowed University em
ployees from Residential and Dining Enter
prises to share their strategies and successes
with the greater student body. Late Nite din
ing and a multitude of sustainability initia
tives are examples of the many resources we
enjoy that sprang from student input. A more
relevant town hall, led by Provost
Etchemendy, was also highly informative, but
held in the middle of summer. And while the
town hall structure has been helpful, in the
long run it really does little to open broader
lines of communication outside of University
committee and ASSU positions. These events
are unable to touch the increasingly perti
nent issue of administrative accountability.
Though many complicated and interre
lated factors must be considered in budget
ing at the University level, the Editorial
Board feels that at the end of the day, relying
solely on information weaned from head
lines limits students' ability to provide bene
ficial insight into the validity of administra
tive prioritization.

The Editorial Board understands that
preserving Stanford and advancing its over
all excellence is the over-arching aim of ad
ministrators and trustees alike. Each Octo
ber, President Hennessey reports to the
board regarding the past year and plans for
the current academic year. Every five years,
the chair of the board and other selected
faculty and staff partake in a 360-degree in
ternal review of the University. However,
little is done to build open broad lines of
communication for students, outside of
nominations commission appointments and
ASSU positions.
Lost within the discussion of the reporting
mechanisms is not only the inability of stu
dents to play any role in the agenda-setting
process, but also the lack of a shared under
standing regarding the metrics employed to
assess progress and success. More trans
parency with regard to the management of
University resources would allow students to
become better stewards of the University's
best interests, principally regarding how to
best serve students.

Stanford is often characterized as a highly
decentralized institution. In many ways, the
autonomy granted to academic and adminis
trative departments allows for more special
ized and economical scholarship and service.
However, greater transparency is still needed
with regard to how the University and its
trustees prioritize finances.

Though nearly all students understand
our endowment is down almost 30 percent,
fewer realize our annual endowment pay
ment which is decided every February by
the trustees is less than 10 percent of our
