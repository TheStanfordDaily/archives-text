## Dear Men, an Intervention 
### Molly Spaeth 
Dear Men,

I have heard that you are actually extreme
ly complex beings, with real profession
al, familial and social goals. You take
pride in your work, your friends and your
family. And according to the wage differen
tial in the world, you are clearly smarter
than the other 50 percent of our beloved
species.

However, recent events have led me to
believe that this preconceived notion I held
that men actually possessed brains or a con
science, must, in fact, be false.

The catalyst for my letter, dear men, oc
curred a week ago, although the build-up
for this constructive critique has been a
long time coming.
There I was last week, walking back to
the Metro after a great day at my internship
in Madrid. I was feeling extremely happy: I
had just had a really fun, productive day at
work, and about an hour earlier, a good
friend had asked me to go to one of
Madrid's finest restaurants with his parents
that night. In addition, my boss had given
me two "galletas" (cookies) before I left the
office as a little treat; even the 7-year-old
side of me was content.

I was strolling along to Beyonce (como
siempre) when I reached the intersection
before the Metro stop. I waited for a car to
pass, but when it slowed down to wait for
me to cross the street I noticed that the
driver was talking to me.
Now, as a rule, I normally don't respond
to anything that anyone says to me in Spain.
Believe me, I wasn't always this cold-heart
ed, but after too much experience with far
too many 'questions' from Spanish men, I
now maintain the eyes-on-the-prize (usual
ly, eyes-on-the-floor) mentality. But for
some reason, I decided to take pity on the
poor man. He looked really lost and I was
on such a cloud 9 that I figured I could
pause, "Halo" for a second and muster a
"Perdon?" to see if he needed directions.

The original Spanish was so vulgar that
I'll go ahead and translate it into a more sub
tle form of English so my column isn't used
to fuel the fire for anti-first amendment
"value voters." Suffice to say he asked me if
I would like to perform oral sex on him.
In that second, and with a single com
ment, that creepy 30-year-old man wiped
out all the happiness and confidence I had
acquired during that day, while simultane
ously obliterating the progress women in
Spain have made regarding their role in so
ciety 35 years post Franco.

He didn't care if I was smart. He didn't
care if I was employed or unemployed, sin-

gle or taken, Catholic or Jewish. All he
cared about was fulfilling some tiny, de
ranged part of his brain that potentially de
rived some miniscule, intrinsic joy from
making me feel like the absolute lowest
thing on the planet.
My question for you, men, is WHY?
WHY do you do these things? I cannot
wrap my mind around it. Have comments
like these, ever, in the modern history of
women's rights, garnered a positive re
sponse? EVER? The only possible expla
nation I can think of to why this deplorable
behavior continues to exist is that one time,
some poor woman actually responded pos
itively, thus ruining the lives of womankind
for the rest of eternity.
"Oh, you like my boobs? I'm SO glad
you yelled that at me from across the street,
otherwise I never would have known! So,
do you want to go get a hotel room or shall
we just go at it right here?"
And then this man, in his infinite wis
dom, passed this one tale of his masculinity
around the brotherhood of men for the con
tinuation of time, an urban legend that con
tinues to provide the brethren with this
sick, twisted idea that sometime, somehow,
some woman will welcome these vulgar ad
vances with open arms and a key to a cheap
hotel.

I apologize if this comes off as an unreg
ulated rant against all of brother-kind
based solely on the actions of one deranged
Spaniard. I wish this had been an isolated
incident. But the sad truth is that incidents
like these have happened more than just a
few times, to some of my classmates and
closest friends both at home and abroad.

I do recognize that there are some good
ones out there (Call me, please. Call your
friends. Teach them your ways). My inten
tion is not to write off your entire species
but rather to encourage a more positive and
productive form of expression. For as far
fetched as it may sound, treating a woman
with respect will yield far greater results
than "I like your boobs."
Come on, guys. There has to be SOME
reason that you are, on average, paid so
much more than women. Somewhere, deep
inside that neuronal mess of futbol (or foot
ball), sex and beer, I know you must have a
brain and a conscience. USE THEM.
Un saludo,
Molly
