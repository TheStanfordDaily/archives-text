# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Does Stanford provide a public good? 
### Danny Crichton 
A few years ago, during those quaint
stock market boom years, there was a
debate in Congress over the value of
elite college institutions in America. Senator
Charles Grassley, the chair and later ranking
minority leader of the Senate Finance Com
mittee, attacked well-endowed schools like
Stanford who bring in enormous income
from fundraising and investments yet contin
ue to aggressively raise tuition.
During that time, he brought into clarity
an important question that an institution like
Stanford must continually answer: How well
are we serving the public?
For Stanford, there has been an obligation
to assist the public interest from our very
founding. As part of the founding grant, Stan
ford's mission is "to promote the public wel
fare by exercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization." Thus, the ques
tion posed goes directly to the core mission
of the university.
Stanford is considered a nonprofit educa
tional institution and thus does not pay taxes
on endowment income or alumni donations
that would amount to millions of dollars lost
per year. The University also receives federal
research grants totaling a little less than a bil
lion dollars per year. These enormous subsi
dies make Stanford accountable to the public.
The legitimacy of the question is clear, but
how to measure public interest is not. A com
plex institution like a university cannot be pi
geonholed into a couple of metrics, regard
less of what the editors of U.S. News would
have us believe. A further question to ask is
whether Stanford must excel in every area
with regard to the public interest, or whether
it can excel at some and not others.

Evaluating Stanford by its own arguments
is enlightening. The University writes an eco
nomic impact report each year to demon
strate its benefits to the local Bay Area com
munity. Last year's study concluded that a lit
tle less than $4 billion was spent by Stanford,
most of which was in the local area. There is
also tens of millions of taxes collected from
utilities and sales taxes that go directly into
the coffers of local and state government.
Stanford does indeed spend a lot of
money. Does that mean the University is in

the public interest? No, since every major
multinational company also spends liberally.
I am fairly certain that companies like
Google and Sun Microsystems are helping
the local economy, too, and they pay taxes (or
should). The notion that Stanford should not
be taxed because of its spending fails logic.
Perhaps Stanford's efforts to bring under
served communities to campus through ad
missions and provide strong financial aid to
those who need it is the way it accomplishes
a public service. In its most current numbers,
a little less than half of students received
Stanford financial aid and almost 15 percent
of the newly admitted class were first-gener
ation college students.
Those are both strong arguments, but they
only work if one ignores the comparative
numbers. Stanford enrolls 12.8 percent of
Pell Grants, in line with peer institutions like

Harvard. At public universities like UCLA
and Berkeley, almost 40 percent of students
receive Pell Grants. Stanford's outreach to
low-income communities is appreciated and
important, but the argument that this defines
Stanford's public benefit is not fair.
A more targeted argument would focus
on Stanford's quality of education. The
school provides one of the best educations in
America, creating the leaders of the future.
This is an argument that works throughout
the different schools as well as at both the un
dergraduate and graduate levels. Not only is
the education top-notch, but a high level of
aid allows graduates the freedom to pursue
public service careers, a freedom not avail
able at every school in the nation. Too bad so
few graduates go into public service.
All of these arguments are true to a de
gree, but lack definitiveness. That argument
is Stanford's drive for original research. As
fewer companies support the kind of basic
research that underpins many of their prod
ucts, it is left up to scientists at research uni
versities and institutions to fill the gap. Few
places can handle the level and depth of re
search like a university, and Stanford is al
most without peer in the level of its research.
It also helps that a myriad of recognizable
companies were started here as well.
Making that argument to the public needs
to happen more often. Senator Tom Coburn
recently proposed eliminating National Sci
ence Foundation grants to political science.
Even politicians are not seeing the benefit of
some research.

Meeting the demands of the public is not
easy, nor should it be, Stanford has done a
solid job using the public trust (perhaps the
research scandals of the early 1990s helped).
The University does not excel in all criteria,
nor would meeting every criterion validate
Stanford's utility. In the end, Grassley was
pleased enough with University responses to
avoid pressing for legislation. Let us continue
to engage and inform.

With his column, Danny Crichton hopes to
provide a public good and therefore save on in
come taxes. You can e-mail him at dancric@
