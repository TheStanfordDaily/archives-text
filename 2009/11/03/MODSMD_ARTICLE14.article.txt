## Dire outlook for men's hoops 
### Haley Murphy 
Call me a pessimist and I'll call
you delusional. Because the
glorious (and, believe me, it
is) start to the men's college
basketball season simultaneously
marks the end of Daily columns that
read something like Glory Be's to
Stanford sports. Why? Because this
year will be a struggle and even that is
a gross understatement.
Unlike its female counterpart, the
Stanford men's basketball team is ex
periencing a 'rebuilding' year. And by
that, I mean it will be a bit like watch
ing a very slow and very gruesome
train wreck.

After graduating three of five
starters, expectations for the Cardinal
bench started to shift in April. But in
juries and overall poor life decisions
have caused the would-be faces of
Stanford basketball to drop faster
than Will Paul's GPA.

Thanks a lot. Will. You deserve
Zoolander's "Slashie Award" as the
year's best Athlete/Student and not
the other way around (please read
that statement with all the sarcasm it
deserves). Deepest apologies, Andy
Brown. Wish you had a stronger left
ACL. Though I'm sure you do, too.
Later, Jeremy Green. Those 'team
rules' things sure are confusing. Who
knew there's a punishment when you
disregard them? And (maybe) adios,
Josh Owens. Please, can someone say
there's a speedy recovery from this
undisclosed medical issue?

In short, let me paint a picture of
the oh-so-stellar basketball squad as
it currently stands: Drew Schiller.
Starting point guard. Passing to
Landry Fields and ... Jarrett Mann?
Jack Trotter? Freshman Gabriel Har
ris? Yep, that's the crew.
Assuming the worst for Owens, of
Stanford's eight leading scorers from
last season, only Fields returns. Hell,
Paul's 4.0 points per game is a sub
stantial loss because Schiller is the
next best option ninth last year
with 2.5.

If I were Fields, I'd be knocking on
Johnny Dawkins' door with one word
on my mind: redshirt.
See, Dawkins is sacrificing this
year, the 'rebuilding' year, and really
is rebuilding, with five commits for
2010-11 already, and clearly plenty of
scholarship positions to go around,
there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
But, for now, shut your eyes. Tight.
Don't get me wrong, I'm all about
the rah-rah Card, but there comes a
time in every Stanford fan's life when
you need to take a peek outside the
Stanford bubble. And maybe wish
the guys' team played a little more
like (Stanford's) girls.
In the world outside, Kansas has
become the preseason favorite. The
Jayhawks won it all in 2008 and lost
last year in the Sweet 16 to future
runners-up, Michigan State. Coach
Bill Self (unlike Dawkins here) got
back all nine of his leading scorers, all
five starters, and earned three great
newbies in Xavier Henry, Thomas
Robinson and Elijah Johnson. While
Kansas and fellow Big 12 heavy
weight Texas both are consensus Top
5 teams, their only potential rivals are

pre-season No. 17 Oklahoma and
boredom with their conference
schedules.

Meanwhile, the Big 10 and Big
East are just that: big. The confer
ences sent six and five teams, respec
tively, to the pre-play rankings.
Michigan State (Big 10) was voted
the nation's second best and with a
roster packed with upperclassmen,
experience will keep the Spartans
more consistent than, let's say, their
fifth-ranked Villanova counterparts
(Big East), who has what scout.com
deemed the nation's second best re
cruiting class, with four rookies
named in the top 100 high school
graduates.
Neither one is a recipe for success,
given the cannibalizing nature of
conference play there. Michigan
State will be on the watch mainly for
Purdue, as the Boilermakers made
and Elite Eight run to cap off 2009.
But nine freshmen joined Purdue's
roster, so Coach Matt Painter will test
his transition abilities. Nova, mean
while, will race for the Big East with
West Virginia, Connecticut, George
town and Louisville, with some of the

game's most commanding, and classy
(cough, Calhoun and Pitino, cough
insert sarcasm here as you catch
your reflection in Pitino's hair), rep
resentatives at the helms of pro
grams.

And then there's the good 'ol
ACC, stacked per usual up and down
Tobacco Road, plus Georgia Tech.
The Yellow Jackets wrangled six re
cruits that they hope are reminiscent
of Luke Schenscher and Javaris Crit
tenton to bring Georgia Tech back to
Tournament contention. But, unlike
perhaps any other conference
(maybe I'm biased), the tensions and
hatreds and prideful motivations run
deepest here, so count nobody out.
And nobody in.
Stragglers hit the Top 25 from the
Pac-10, SEC and Horizon Leagues,
among others, but rankings rarely
hold through the first month, anyway.
We're ten days in, but it's no use to
look back before March.

So, here it is. The time of muting
games to block out Dick Vitale's
praise of some 6-foot-9 overrated
'Diaper Dandy' who cries six times a
season. The time of buzzer beaters

and miracle minutes and Cinderella
stories. The time when my productiv
ity drops to nil and the nation follows
suit come March. It's all here. Just not
quite close enough to hit Maples.

Haley Murphy wishes she could red
shirt her own senior year. Tell her there's
life outside Stanford at hmmurphy@
stanford.edu.

like (Stanford's) girls.
In the world outside, Kansas has
become the preseason favorite. The
Jayhawks won it all in 2008 and lost
last year in the Sweet 16 to future
runners-up, Michigan State. Coach
Bill Self (unlike Dawkins here) got
back all nine of his leading scorers, all
five starters, and earned three great
newbies in Xavier Henry, Thomas
Robinson and Elijah Johnson. While
Kansas and fellow Big 12 heavy
weight Texas both are consensus Top
5 teams, their only potential rivals are

pre-season No. 17 Oklahoma and
boredom with their conference
schedules.

Meanwhile, the Big 10 and Big
East are just that: big. The confer
ences sent six and five teams, respec
tively, to the pre-play rankings.
Michigan State (Big 10) was voted
the nation's second best and with a
roster packed with upperclassmen,
experience will keep the Spartans
more consistent than, let's say, their
fifth-ranked Villanova counterparts
(Big East), who has what scout.com
deemed the nation's second best re
cruiting class, with four rookies
named in the top 100 high school
graduates.
Neither one is a recipe for success,
given the cannibalizing nature of
conference play there. Michigan
State will be on the watch mainly for
Purdue, as the Boilermakers made
and Elite Eight run to cap off 2009.
But nine freshmen joined Purdue's
roster, so Coach Matt Painter will test
his transition abilities. Nova, mean
while, will race for the Big East with
West Virginia, Connecticut, George
town and Louisville, with some of the

game's most commanding, and classy
(cough, Calhoun and Pitino, cough
insert sarcasm here as you catch
your reflection in Pitino's hair), rep
resentatives at the helms of pro
grams.

And then there's the good 'ol
ACC, stacked per usual up and down
Tobacco Road, plus Georgia Tech.
The Yellow Jackets wrangled six re
cruits that they hope are reminiscent
of Luke Schenscher and Javaris Crit
tenton to bring Georgia Tech back to
Tournament contention. But, unlike
perhaps any other conference
(maybe I'm biased), the tensions and
hatreds and prideful motivations run
deepest here, so count nobody out.
And nobody in.
Stragglers hit the Top 25 from the
Pac-10, SEC and Horizon Leagues,
among others, but rankings rarely
hold through the first month, anyway.
We're ten days in, but it's no use to
look back before March.

So, here it is. The time of muting
games to block out Dick Vitale's
praise of some 6-foot-9 overrated
'Diaper Dandy' who cries six times a
season. The time of buzzer beaters

and miracle minutes and Cinderella
stories. The time when my productiv
ity drops to nil and the nation follows
suit come March. It's all here. Just not
quite close enough to hit Maples.

Haley Murphy wishes she could red
shirt her own senior year. Tell her there's
life outside Stanford at hmmurphy@
