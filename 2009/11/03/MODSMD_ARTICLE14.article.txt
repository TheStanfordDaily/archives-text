## Dire outlook for men's hoops 
### Haley Murphy 
Call me a pessimist and I'll call
you delusional. Because the
glorious (and, believe me, it
is) start to the men's college
basketball season simultaneously
marks the end of Daily columns that
read something like Glory Be's to
Stanford sports. Why? Because this
year will be a struggle and even that is
a gross understatement.
Unlike its female counterpart, the
Stanford men's basketball team is ex
periencing a 'rebuilding' year. And by
that, I mean it will be a bit like watch
ing a very slow and very gruesome
train wreck.

After graduating three of five
starters, expectations for the Cardinal
bench started to shift in April. But in
juries and overall poor life decisions
have caused the would-be faces of
Stanford basketball to drop faster

rules' things sure are confusing. Who
knew there's a punishment when you
disregard them? And (maybe) adios,
Josh Owens. Please, can someone say

undisclosed medical issue?

In short, let me paint a picture of
the oh-so-stellar basketball squad as
it currently stands: Drew Schiller.
Starting point guard. Passing to
Landry Fields and ... Jarrett Mann?
Jack Trotter? Freshman Gabriel Har
ris? Yep, that's the crew.
Assuming the worst for Owens, of
Stanford's eight leading scorers from
last season, only Fields returns. Hell,
Paul's 4.0 points per game is a sub
stantial loss because Schiller is the
next best option ninth last year
with 2.5.

If I were Fields, I'd be knocking on
Johnny Dawkins' door with one word
on my mind: redshirt.
See, Dawkins is sacrificing this
year, the 'rebuilding' year, and really
is rebuilding, with five commits for
