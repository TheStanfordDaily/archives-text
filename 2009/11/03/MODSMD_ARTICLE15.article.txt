# CARD STUMBLES OUT EAST
## Stanford struggles, but retains top seed 
### ALISSA HABER STAFF WRITER 
As the postseason looms, the No. 12 Stanford
field hockey team must try to find the positives
after a tough road trip out East.
The Cardinal suffered two losses this week
end, the first to top-ranked Maryland on Friday
night, and the second to No. 15 Louisville,
Stanford is now 13-3 on the season.
The 6-2 loss to Maryland, the nation's No. 1
club, ensured the Terps an undefeated regular

season. However, the score was not indicative
of the Cardinal's efforts, as Stanford was only
trailing 3-2 at the half.
But the Terps took over in the second half and
would score 3 unanswered goals in the final 35
minutes of the game, Maryland outshot the Cardi
nal 31-10 for the entire contest.
Both of Stanford's first half goals were
scored by freshman Becky Dru, who increased
her season total to an impressive 11 goals on the
year. Junior Jaimee Erickson and senior Nora
Soza each recorded an assist.
Looking for redemption against No. 15
Louisville on Sunday, the Stanford offense was
uncharacteristically stifled in the 4-1 loss. The
Cardinals recorded 26 shots while holding Stan
ford to only 16. This is only the third time on the
season that Stanford has failed to score at least

two goals in a game.
The Cardinal's only goal was scored in the first
half by Erickson, who now has 7 goals on the year.
Another positive for the Cardinal was goal
keeper Alessandra Moss, who matched a career
best 13 saves on the match despite the 4 goals al
lowed. The sophomore had an impressive 25
saves combined during the road trip.
This is the first time Stanford has dropped
two games in a row in over a year, when the Car
dinal lost to Northeastern and Holy Cross in Oc
tober of 2008.
Up next for the Cardinal is the NorPac tourna
ment, which Stanford is hosting at the Varsity Turf
starting Thursday. The Cardinal is the top-seeded
team out of the West division of the NorPac and
