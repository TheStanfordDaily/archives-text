# Women run to fourth in Pac-10
## 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's cross country
team has had a season of ups and downs. To
start off the season, the women dominated
at the Stanford Invite, winning the meet
with 24 points, with freshman Kathy
Kroeger leading the pack by placing third
overall with a time of 20 minutes, 35 sec
onds on a 6,000-meter course. The Cardinal
had four other top 10 finishes in that meet,
with Kroeger followed by senior Kate
Niehaus, freshman Alex Dunne, junior
Alex Gits and sophomore Stephanie
Marcy.

The women also had a strong showing at
the Nevada Twilight Invitational, finishing
second, with sophomore Maddie Duhon
placing fourth overall with a time of 15:40
on a 4,000-meter course. Despite the grad
uation of top runner Lauren Centrowitz,
the Cardinal still had several elite women
returning, such as Niehaus, a member of
both the 2006 and 2007 NCAA Champi
onship teams, and Gits, an All-American
who placed third at the NCAA Outdoor
Championships in the 10,000 meters in
2008.

Another big meet for the women was
the NCAA Pre-Nationals, one of the most
competitive regular season meets. Going
into the meet ranked No. 6, the women
were up against No. 4 Oregon, No. 7 lowa
State, No. 11 Florida State, No. 13 George
town, No. 19 Colorado, No. 24 Michigan
State and No. 29 lowa.

The women finished fifth at the meet,
behind Colorado, Florida State, Oregon,
and Georgetown, with Gits, Marcy, and
Dunne placing 15-17 th respectively.
Following NCAA Pre-Nationals, the
women competed at the Pac-10 Champi
onships this past weekend at Long Beach,
CA. While the men won the Pac-10 title, the
women did not fare as well, finishing in
fourth place behind Washington, Oregon

and Arizona State. Unfortunately, the
women came in just one point behind the
Sun Devils.

The primary reason for the disappoint
ing team result was the fact that the Cardi
nal was competing without two of its top
runners, Kroeger and Niehaus. Further
more, Dunne did not finish the race, as she
had to stop running 500 yards short of the
finish line.

"We are dealing with some injuries right
now," said senior Madeleine O'Meara,
"But we have to take it in stride and work
with the talent, strength and teamwork we
have available on any given day."
At the Pac-10 Championships, the
women were led by Gits, as she finished in
10th place with a time of 20:13.16 on a
6,000-meter course. Gits has been enjoying
an incredible comeback after spending al
most the entire last season injured. Direct
ly following Gits was Marcy, who finished
in 11th placed with a time of 20:16.58. An
other top 20 performance was provided by
O'Meara, who placed 18th with a time of

WOMEN'S CROSS COUNTRY
10/30 4th 111 points
UP NEXT
NCAA WEST REGIONALS
11/14 Eugene, Ore.
GAME NOTES: While their male counterparts captured
a conference title in Long Beach last weekend, the
Cardinal women weren't quite as successful, earning
a fourth place finish in the absence of top runners
Katy Kroeger and Kate Niehaus. Like the men, they
will compete next on November 14th at the NCAA
West Regionals in Oregon.

The Cardinal women, running without top performers Kathy Kroeger and Kate Niehaus, managed to take fourth place
in last weekend's Pac-10 Championships. Stanford finished just one point behind the Sun Devils of Arizona State.
20:33.64, a career best.
In regard to the team's perform
ance this past weekend, O'Meara
said, "Pac-lOs was a definite wake
up call for everyone. We know we
can't be complacent about our com
petition, or focus solely on UW and
Oregon."
Next up for the team will be the

NCAA West Regionals in two weeks
in Eugene, OR. The women will once

again face the Pac-10 teams, as well
as other top runners.
"We have all the tools and per
sonnel necessary to run very well at
the regional and national level,"
O'Meara said. "The Pac-10 is one of
the toughest conferences in the
country and it showed on Friday.
We're excited to get another oppor
tunity to race against the Pac-10
schools at the regional meet in two
weeks. And we're definitely moti
vated to improve upon our team's
placing."
