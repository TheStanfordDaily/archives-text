yards of total
offense. 47
points. Against
one of the best
defenses in the country, and against
perhaps the most dominant program
in the nation for the past 10 years.
Wow.
Oregon's performance against
USC last weekend was truly incredi
ble, It was one of the most impressive
displays of offense I have ever seen
and Oregon's defense wasn't too
shabby either, holding the vaunted
Trojan offense to only three points in
the second half.
And this was no pansy USC team
either. USC is still one of the best
teams in the country, which just
makes the way the Ducks dismantled
the Trojans even more impressive.
And this was no fluke Oregon has
been arguably the hottest team in the
country. In its last five games, only
one opponent has gotten within
three touchdowns of the Ducks, and
that was UCLA, who was held with
out an offensive touchdown.

Oregon is undefeated in confer
ence play, ranked eighth in the BCS
and on a tear. Stanford, who couldn't
finish off Wake Forest (4-5 in the
mediocre ACC), couldn't possibly
fare any better than USC, let alone
have a chance at winning, right?

As Lee Corso so often proclaims,
"Not so fast, my friend!"

With all the talent and success
Oregon has had, and all the woes
Stanford has had, Oregon is only fa
vored by 5.5 points by the oddsmak
ers. No, I didn't accidentally put a
decimal point there Stanford is
actually less than a touchdown un
derdog. Why?
To put it simply, Stanford is pretty
good. And playing at home, in front
of the "quiet" Stanford Stadium
(thanks, Steve Sarkisian), the Cardi
nal is excellent, winning nine of its
past 10 games. This home-field ad
vantage, despite disappointingly
poor attendance, is even more re
markable considering Stanford is 2-9
in that stretch on the road, with both
wins coming against Pac-10 bottom
feeders Washington and Washington
State. So playing at home should
help.

Stanford is also well up to the
challenge on offense. As crazy as it
sounds, the Cardinal should pose a
tougher test to Oregon than USC.
Yeah, I said it. Stanford ranks higher
than USC in rushing offense, total
offense, scoring offense and passing
efficiency. And, although Oregon's
defense has been spectacular (first in
the Pac-10 in scoring defense and
second in total defense), it has been
mediocre at defending the run (sixth
in the Pac-10). If any team can ex
ploit this weakness, it is the Cardinal.
In particular, Toby Gerhart's
straight-ahead power running game
can neutralize Oregon's speed on
defense, and it can expose a lack of
strength up front for the Ducks.
In order to have a chance against
Oregon, Stanford is going to need to
run successfully, and that's not just to
gain yardage. Oregon has a quick
strike offense (the Ducks are first in
the conference in points per game
and last in time of possession), so
Stanford will need to give it as few
chances as possible. The Cardinal
can do this, as its offense ranks 13th
in the nation in time of possession at
over 32 minutes per game. Also, the
more time Stanford can hold the
ball, the longer it can stay close
enough to use its running game.

A one-dimensional offense will
not be enough though, because Ore
gon has a defense capable of shut
ting down either the run or the pass.
Therefore, despite Oregon's prolific
pass defense (under 180 yards al
lowed per game, three sacks per
game), Stanford will need a strong
performance from Andrew Luck,
and I believe he can come through.
Although the Ducks have stifled op

posing quarterbacks the past month
or so, I don't believe they've faced a
quarterback as skilled as Andrew
Luck, and that includes media fa
vorites Jake Locker and Matt
Barkley.
No, I'm not just trying to be mini-
Harbaugh and stir up Luck-Tebow
controversy. I'm just stating the sim
ple fact that Andrew Luck is really,
really good. He leads the Pac-10 in
passer rating and is third in the na
tion in yards per attempt, so his im
pact can be felt quickly and often. He
has also been sacked only five times
all season, so the offensive line
should be a good match for Oregon's
pass rush.
Now, the one question Cardinal
fans should be asking (besides, "Will
Chris Owusu please return kicks for
touchdowns again?") is, "What
about the defense?"
Stanford's defense will undoubt
edly decide whether this game will
be a classic nail-biter or Cumber
land-Georgia Tech II (look it up).
The Cardinal's defense has been
melted butter so far, and Oregon
brings the sharpest knife Stanford
has seen all year. Stanford is only
sixth in the Pac-10 in total defense,
which isn't awful, but the Cardinal
ranks last in red zone defense and
tied for last in turnovers and
turnover margin. This makes staying
in the game difficult.
The good news is that Oregon fig
ures to test Stanford's anemic sec
ondary less than other teams have,
because the Ducks are last in the
conference in passing yards per
game and passing plays per game.
The bad news is that this happens be
cause Oregon can run all over just
about everyone, and Stanford's sev
enth-ranked rush defense doesn't in
spire too much confidence, particu
larly when you contrast the speed on
each side of the ball.

Realistically, though, it only takes
a big play or two on defense to give
the Stanford offense the chances it
needs to secure the upset and gain
bowl eligibility. And although the
Cardinal hasn't made too many big
plays this season, there are certainly
many athletes capable of changing
the game for Stanford.
Oregon is clearly the favorite and
deserves to be, and if each team plays
the way it has, Stanford will probably
lose. But Oregon is coming off an
emotionally and physically draining
win over USC, while Stanford has
just had an "improvement week," so
Stanford should have a scheduling
and health advantage.
And who knows, maybe Stan
ford's home cooking can whip up a
bowl of Duck soup.

Oregon is clearly the favorite and
deserves to be, and if each team plays
the way it has, Stanford will probably
lose. But Oregon is coming off an
emotionally and physically draining
win over USC, while Stanford has
just had an "improvement week," so
Stanford should have a scheduling

yards of total
offense. 47
points. Against
one of the best
defenses in the country, and against
perhaps the most dominant program
in the nation for the past 10 years.
Wow.
Oregon's performance against
USC last weekend was truly incredi
ble, It was one of the most impressive
displays of offense I have ever seen
and Oregon's defense wasn't too
shabby either, holding the vaunted
Trojan offense to only three points in
the second half.
And this was no pansy USC team
either. USC is still one of the best
teams in the country, which just
makes the way the Ducks dismantled
the Trojans even more impressive.
And this was no fluke Oregon has
been arguably the hottest team in the
country. In its last five games, only
one opponent has gotten within
three touchdowns of the Ducks, and
that was UCLA, who was held with
out an offensive touchdown.

Oregon is undefeated in confer
ence play, ranked eighth in the BCS
and on a tear. Stanford, who couldn't
finish off Wake Forest (4-5 in the
mediocre ACC), couldn't possibly
fare any better than USC, let alone
have a chance at winning, right?

As Lee Corso so often proclaims,
"Not so fast, my friend!"

With all the talent and success
Oregon has had, and all the woes
Stanford has had, Oregon is only fa
vored by 5.5 points by the oddsmak
ers. No, I didn't accidentally put a
decimal point there Stanford is
actually less than a touchdown un
derdog. Why?
To put it simply, Stanford is pretty
good. And playing at home, in front
of the "quiet" Stanford Stadium
(thanks, Steve Sarkisian), the Cardi
nal is excellent, winning nine of its
past 10 games. This home-field ad
vantage, despite disappointingly
poor attendance, is even more re
markable considering Stanford is 2-9
in that stretch on the road, with both
wins coming against Pac-10 bottom
feeders Washington and Washington
State. So playing at home should
help.

Stanford is also well up to the
challenge on offense. As crazy as it
sounds, the Cardinal should pose a
tougher test to Oregon than USC.
Yeah, I said it. Stanford ranks higher
than USC in rushing offense, total
offense, scoring offense and passing
efficiency. And, although Oregon's
defense has been spectacular (first in
the Pac-10 in scoring defense and
second in total defense), it has been
mediocre at defending the run (sixth
in the Pac-10). If any team can ex
ploit this weakness, it is the Cardinal.
In particular, Toby Gerhart's
straight-ahead power running game
can neutralize Oregon's speed on
defense, and it can expose a lack of
strength up front for the Ducks.
In order to have a chance against
Oregon, Stanford is going to need to
run successfully, and that's not just to
gain yardage. Oregon has a quick
strike offense (the Ducks are first in
the conference in points per game
and last in time of possession), so
Stanford will need to give it as few
chances as possible. The Cardinal
can do this, as its offense ranks 13th
in the nation in time of possession at
over 32 minutes per game. Also, the
more time Stanford can hold the
ball, the longer it can stay close
enough to use its running game.

A one-dimensional offense will
not be enough though, because Ore
gon has a defense capable of shut
ting down either the run or the pass.
Therefore, despite Oregon's prolific
pass defense (under 180 yards al
lowed per game, three sacks per
game), Stanford will need a strong
performance from Andrew Luck,
and I believe he can come through.
Although the Ducks have stifled op

posing quarterbacks the past month
or so, I don't believe they've faced a
quarterback as skilled as Andrew
Luck, and that includes media fa
vorites Jake Locker and Matt
Barkley.
No, I'm not just trying to be mini-
Harbaugh and stir up Luck-Tebow
controversy. I'm just stating the sim
ple fact that Andrew Luck is really,
really good. He leads the Pac-10 in
passer rating and is third in the na
tion in yards per attempt, so his im
pact can be felt quickly and often. He
has also been sacked only five times
all season, so the offensive line
should be a good match for Oregon's
pass rush.
Now, the one question Cardinal
fans should be asking (besides, "Will
Chris Owusu please return kicks for
touchdowns again?") is, "What
about the defense?"
Stanford's defense will undoubt
edly decide whether this game will
be a classic nail-biter or Cumber
land-Georgia Tech II (look it up).
The Cardinal's defense has been
melted butter so far, and Oregon
brings the sharpest knife Stanford
has seen all year. Stanford is only
sixth in the Pac-10 in total defense,
which isn't awful, but the Cardinal
ranks last in red zone defense and
tied for last in turnovers and
turnover margin. This makes staying
in the game difficult.
The good news is that Oregon fig
ures to test Stanford's anemic sec
ondary less than other teams have,
because the Ducks are last in the
conference in passing yards per
game and passing plays per game.
The bad news is that this happens be
cause Oregon can run all over just
about everyone, and Stanford's sev
enth-ranked rush defense doesn't in
spire too much confidence, particu
larly when you contrast the speed on
each side of the ball.

Realistically, though, it only takes
a big play or two on defense to give
the Stanford offense the chances it
needs to secure the upset and gain
bowl eligibility. And although the
Cardinal hasn't made too many big
plays this season, there are certainly
many athletes capable of changing
the game for Stanford.
Oregon is clearly the favorite and
deserves to be, and if each team plays
the way it has, Stanford will probably
lose. But Oregon is coming off an
emotionally and physically draining
win over USC, while Stanford has
just had an "improvement week," so
Stanford should have a scheduling
and health advantage.
And who knows, maybe Stan
ford's home cooking can whip up a
bowl of Duck soup.
