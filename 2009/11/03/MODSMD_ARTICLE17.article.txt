# Nice win, Ducks â€“ now watch out

in the nation for the past 10 years.
Wow.
Oregon's performance against
USC last weekend was truly incredi
ble, It was one of the most impressive
displays of offense I have ever seen
and Oregon's defense wasn't too
shabby either, holding the vaunted
Trojan offense to only three points in
the second half.
And this was no pansy USC team
either. USC is still one of the best
teams in the country, which just
makes the way the Ducks dismantled
the Trojans even more impressive.
And this was no fluke Oregon has
been arguably the hottest team in the
country. In its last five games, only
one opponent has gotten within
three touchdowns of the Ducks, and
that was UCLA, who was held with
out an offensive touchdown.

Oregon is undefeated in confer
ence play, ranked eighth in the BCS
and on a tear. Stanford, who couldn't
finish off Wake Forest (4-5 in the
mediocre ACC), couldn't possibly
fare any better than USC, let alone
have a chance at winning, right?
