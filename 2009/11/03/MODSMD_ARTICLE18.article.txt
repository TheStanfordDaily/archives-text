# MEN TAKE PAC-10 TITLE
## Derrick, Heath, team run away with conference crown 
### JULIA BROWNELL 
After a three-year drought, the
Cardinal men recaptured the Pac-10
championship on Saturday with a de
cisive win over last year's national
champion, Oregon.
The No. 1 ranked Stanford team
showed its dominance yet again this
season. Six of the Cardinal's seven
runners finished in the top 12,
demonstrating the depth of the
young team. However, the win was
not a surprise to the runners.

"I'd say we expected [to win]. It
would have been a poor showing if
we didn't," said redshirt junior Justin
Marpole-Bird.
TTiis is the first time that the Car
dinal men have captured the title
since the team's dominant streak of
wins 2000-2004. This 2009 team ap
pears to be recapturing that dynasty
and the runners see continuing that
legacy as a definite possibility for
their young team with no seniors.
"We're a very young team," said
sophomore Chris Derrick. "We're
bringing everyone back next year."
Derrick led the Card to the win,
breaking the tape in a record 22
minutes, 35 seconds, a Pac-10 8,000-
meter record.
Junior Elliot Heath followed in
third with a time of 22:52, edging out
Oregon's top runner. Redshirt soph
omore Jake Riley and Marpole-Bird
came in sth and 6th respectively, with
Miles Unterreiner wrapping up the
five scoring runners in 11th. The
team finished the meet with 28 total
points to Oregon's 45.
"This was pretty much a dual
meet between us and Oregon,"
Marpole-Bird said. "It's always
good to have an indicator that we're
doing something right."
The team expressed happiness at
their win, but their sights are defi
nitely on nationals.
"It feels pretty good [to have
beaten last year's national champi
ons]," Derrick said, "But the most
important race is still to come. I'd
say we're pleased, but not satisfied."
Derrick did not rule out Oregon
as competitors in the future, even
after Saturday's defeat. He cited
them, Oklahoma State and North
ern Arizona as competition on the

national stage.
In addition to hopes of team title,
after Saturday's record and his first
place finish at nationals, it appears
that Derrick has a shot at the indi
vidual title as well. He brushed off
the significance of this time, howev
er, noting that every course is differ
ent and instead focusing on the

team's accomplishment.
"The time was kind of irrele
vant," he said.
To prepare for their champi
onship schedule, the team will put in
hard work this week, then enjoy a
break in preparation for NCAA
West Regionals on Nov. 14 in Ore
gon. They will then head into the na

tional meet in Terra Haute, Indiana
on Nov. 21.
As for that national meet, the
team has their eyes on the podium.
"We absolutely want to win,"
Marpole-Bird said.
