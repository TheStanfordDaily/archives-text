# Preview: '09 elections
## Daily breaks down candidates, key issues 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY AMY JULIA HARRIS 
The 2009 election season may
seem tame compared to last year's
whirlwind, but political fireworks
continue to flare in races nation
wide. There's a three-candidate bid
for a governor's seat; a fight for a
party's identity in a House election;
a familiar gay marriage referendum;
and mayoral bouts in some of
America's biggest cities. Here are a
few races to keep an eye on when
the polls open today.

New Jersey Gubernatorial Race
New Jersey has been a persistent
enigma for the Republican Party
no matter how strong a candidate
they pick or how turbulent the tur
moil within the Democratic opposi
tion, the Republican Party is inca
pable of winning a statewide elec
tion. They have not captured the
governor's mansion since 1997.
Former U.S. Attorney Chris
Christie, the GOP nominee, is as
good a candidate to buck that trend
as any in the recent past. A self
described moderate, his prosecution

record has garnered respect. Though
a pro-life Republican, he has also
pledged not to seek a total abortion
ban, the issue that is generally a lit
mus test for New Jersey voters.

Christie's reform and law
enforcement campaign takes direct
aim at incumbent Democratic
Governor Jon Corzine, who has seen
rampant government corruption
and economic losses throughout his
tenure and the low approval ratings
to show for it. But in a campaign
that has been almost exclusively
negative, Corzine has used his con
siderable personal wealth to paint
Christie as nothing more than a
lackey. Despite Christie leading uni
versally in early polls, recent num
bers have shown the election to be
razor-close.

Throwing a wrench into the race
is independent candidate Chris
Daggett, who has seen a double
digit popularity rise while Corzine
and Christie's negative campaigns
rage. Daggett's chances at actual vic
tory are slim, but his center-right
stances mean that he is likely to pull
some voters that would normally
break for Christie.

New York 23rd Special Election
As one of just two off-year con
gressional elections today, the two
man race for New York's 23rd con
gressional district between
Democrat Bill Owens and
Republican Doug Hoffman has
become a marquee election for
Republicans looking to direct the
future of the party.

The district has become a hotbed
of political infighting for conserva
tives. State Assemblywoman
Dierdre Scozzafava, the GOP nomi
nee, was deemed to be too liberal by
the Republican rank and file, and
Conservative Party candidate Doug
Hoffman received the high-profile
endorsements of Sarah Palin and
Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty,
among others. The war of words
between Hoffman and Scozzafava
became particularly vicious.
Scozzafava abruptly ducked out
of the race this weekend amid lag
ging poll numbers, leaving Hoffman
to carry the Republican banner.
Then, in a game of political football
that blindsided the GOP,
Scozzavava bucked her own party
and endorsed Owens, much to the

ire of party leaders like Newt
Gingrich, who stuck out his neck for
Scozzafava previously.

Politicians across the board are
weighing in on the 23rd —Vice
President Joe Biden stumped on
Monday for Owens, lambasting
Hoffman for being "handpicked" by
Rush Limbaugh.
Republicans have a sizable regis
tration advantage over Democrats
in the 23rd more than 44,000 vot
ers but President Barack Obama
won the district by a five-point mar
gin last November. Former
Republican Congressman John
McHugh, now Obama's Secretary of
the Army, had a lock on the district
for nine terms, garnering over 60
percent of the vote in every election
since 1992.

The latest polling by the Sienna
Research Institute has Owens trail
ing Hoffman, 35 to 41 percent.

Maine Gay Marriage Referendum
It's deja vu for Prop 8 opponents

ture's May decision to green-light
