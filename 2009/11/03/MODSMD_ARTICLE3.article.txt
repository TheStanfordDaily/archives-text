## Joyce Carol Oates reads 'The Knife' Princeton writer Oates invited to read at Lane Lecture Series 
### JENNIFER LEE 
"I'm sort of a normal person," said Joyce
Carol Oates, author and creative writing profes
sor at Princeton University. "I'm the only nor
mal person I know at Princeton."
As a part of the Jean and Bill Lane Lecture
Series sponsored by the Creative Writing
Program, Oates gave a reading of her short
story "The Knife" Monday night in Cubberley
Auditorium, followed by a Q&A session.
English emeritus Prof. John L'Heureux, for
mer director of creative writing at Stanford,
introduced Oates by commenting on Oates'
dedication and commitment to writing. He
noted that she published her first story at 19 and
has since then published five books a year.
"In the Stanford [Bookstore] catalog, the
number of books written and or edited by her is
listed at 159," L'Heureux said. "But that was two
weeks ago."
L'Heureux emphasized that Oates is not
remarkable merely for the quantity of her works
but also for the high quality and enduring
nature of those works.
As Oates stepped on the stage, she immedi
ately shared her excitement in participating in a
public lecture. "Writers spend a lot of time in
solitary confinement," she said. "So, when we
actually get out in the world, we get very excit
ed to see other people and see that they actual
ly exist."
Oates followed by giving a reading of her
short story "The Knife." She noted that the story
was based on a real event that occurred at
Princeton, though the events did not happen to
her and the characters are fictitious.
In "The Knife," a mother is robbed by a man
armed with a knife in her own home. When the
mother gains possession of the knife, she does
not defend herself and is ultimately raped by the
robber.
Oates explained that the story was inspired
by the idea of images that one cannot compre
hend but still find haunting. She became haunt
ed by the possibility of dropping the knife had
she been in that position and also
failing to protect herself.
"This story is not about a sus

pense plot," she said. "It's about
how when a moment comes when
you might behave in a certain way,
you can't do it because you're not
the person who is able to do it, so
you have to live with that."

Several audience members said
they were struck not only by Oates'
writing but also by her personality.

"Joyce Carol Oates' reading was
soothing and powerful at the same
time, with a very natural rhythm,"
said Irteza Binte-Farid 'l3. "Along
with the reading, I also loved the
Q&A session, during which Oates
showed her sharp wit and charm."
"For such an accomplished
author, she was very humble and

personable," agreed Mari Tanabe
â€¢13.

During the Q&A session, Oates
had to pause when asked how she
views herself in the context of
American literature.

"I think of myself as walking
hand-in-hand, maybe palm-by
palm, with Edgar Allan Poe," Oates
responded after much thought.
A colloquium will be held today
for the reading at 11 a.m. in the
Terrace Room of Margaret Jacks
Hall.
