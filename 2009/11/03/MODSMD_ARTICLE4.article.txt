## Volkswagen, CARS celebrate collaboration Volkswagen providing millions for auto technology 
### TYLER BROWN 
The Center for Automotive Research at
Stanford (CARS) and Volkswagen Group
of America, Inc. commemorated five years
of collaboration on automotive research by
celebrating the soon-to-be completed
Volkswagen Automotive Innovation Lab
(VAIL).

Volkswagen is providing $2 million
toward the roughly $4 million capital cost of
the building an 8,000 square foot, ware
house-like research facility under construc
tion at the intersection of Stock Farm and
Oak Road. The company is also providing
$750,000 a year for the next five years to
Stanford researchers working on automo
tive technology.
"This definitely makes them stick out
among the automotive research partners,"
said Sven Beiker, executive director of
CARS.
Beiker said the most immediate benefit

of VAIL is that all the automotive
researchers on campus will finally be under
the same roof.

"There's really been no collaborative
area in past at ah, and in fact, there haven't
even really been good facilities for this,"
said Chris Gerdes, professor of mechanical
engineering. "So, we've really been begging,
borrowing and stealing space as we could,
and now there's going to be nice dedicated
space for ah these activities."
With VAIL, "The idea is that [there will
be] a very energetic exchange of ideas, skills
and people, and that the industry will find

this a great place to do automotive
research," Beiker said.

The building will include a shop area,
dedicated stalls for cars, a seminar room and
the driving simulator that currently resides
in the Mechanical Engineering Research
Building.

"It is a collaborative area, so nobody
really will own space," Gerdes said.
Gerdes expects VAIL to be finished by
February 2010, with a March move-in date.
