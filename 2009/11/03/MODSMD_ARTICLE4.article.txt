## Volkswagen, CARS celebrate collaboration Volkswagen providing millions for auto technology 
### TYLER BROWN 
The Center for Automotive Research at
Stanford (CARS) and Volkswagen Group
of America, Inc. commemorated five years
of collaboration on automotive research by
celebrating the soon-to-be completed
Volkswagen Automotive Innovation Lab
(VAIL).

Volkswagen is providing $2 million
toward the roughly $4 million capital cost of
the building an 8,000 square foot, ware
house-like research facility under construc
tion at the intersection of Stock Farm and
Oak Road. The company is also providing
$750,000 a year for the next five years to
Stanford researchers working on automo
tive technology.
"This definitely makes them stick out
among the automotive research partners,"
said Sven Beiker, executive director of
CARS.
Beiker said the most immediate benefit

of VAIL is that all the automotive
researchers on campus will finally be under
the same roof.

"There's really been no collaborative
area in past at ah, and in fact, there haven't
even really been good facilities for this,"
said Chris Gerdes, professor of mechanical
engineering. "So, we've really been begging,
borrowing and stealing space as we could,
and now there's going to be nice dedicated
space for ah these activities."
With VAIL, "The idea is that [there will
be] a very energetic exchange of ideas, skills
and people, and that the industry will find

this a great place to do automotive
research," Beiker said.

The building will include a shop area,
dedicated stalls for cars, a seminar room and
the driving simulator that currently resides
in the Mechanical Engineering Research
Building.

"It is a collaborative area, so nobody
really will own space," Gerdes said.
Gerdes expects VAIL to be finished by
February 2010, with a March move-in date.

Multidisciplinary Collaboration
The labs Volkswagen funds
include Gerdes' Dynamic Design
Laboratory, computer science and
electrical engineering Prof. Sebastian
Thrun's Artificial Intelligence Lab
(which designed and built Stanley,
the first autonomous vehicle to com
plete the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, or
DARPA, Grand Challenge in 2005)
and communication Prof. Cliff Nass'
Communication between Humans
and Interactive Media (CHIMe)
Lab.

Gerdes, Thrun and Nass were the
original three faculty members who
decided Stanford should have a cen
ter that brings together the key play
ers in academia and industry for
automotive research. They launched
CARS on Oct.l, 2008.
Today, CARS formally associates
with Stanford's departments of com
puter science, engineering and com
munication, but the organization is
also well-connected with the
Graduate School of Business, the
School of Law and Stanford's Global
Climate and Energy Project.
"What we're really hoping to do is
to bring in people who would like to
work with vehicles, people who are
doing other projects on campus
related to vehicles," Gerdes said.
"There's a good opportunity to bring
them under the roof."

Currently, CARS has five indus
try partners: Volkswagen, Bosch,
Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Each
affiliate pays a $50,000 annual mem
bership fee, which covers administra
tive costs for CARS. From there,
companies collaborate with individ
ual labs and often grant additional
funds for research.

Even with five affiliates, Beiker
believes CARS has room to expand.
"We want to grow it a little bit, so on
the order of 10,12 companies would
be nice," he said.
Part of Beiker's job as executive
director is to assure that members of
the auto industry can find research
counterparts here on campus, and
vice versa.

"Where there's maybe a research
group and they say, 'We're doing
exciting things but we definitely want
an industry partner'... you know
that you'll really get input from
industry as well," Beiker said.

Executive Director of
Volkswagen's Electronics Research
Lab Burkhard Huhnke agrees. He
says Volkswagen has worked on
Audi's Clean Air Initiative, a pro

gram geared toward automobile effi
ciency, with Stanford researchers.
Volkswagen is particularly interested
in communication between vehicles,
the human-machine interface and
on-board energy-regeneration tech
nologies, Huhnke said.
"Stanford is a fantastic partner,"
he said. "Especially when we started
our collaboration ... our experience
was fantastic. We had experience on
the car side, and [Thrun's Artificial
Intelligence Lab] had experience
with smart computers."

Huhnke believes the collabora
tion between CARS and
Volkswagen will continue into the
future, well beyond the five-year
grant period.
CARS is also responsible for
organizing regular meetings with
industry partners and reaching out to
companies for conferences and
expert roundtable discussions on
campus.

The research under CARS' wing,
much of which will be going on at
VAIL, includes work on electric and
autonomous vehicles, "ownership
models" like car sharing and ride
sharing, vehicle-to-vehicle communi
cation technologies, visual media in
the car and new engine technologies.

YAIL's Future
At the "Driving Innovation"
event held Oct. 24,
Volkswagen and CARS
also unveiled the cul-

mination of nearly a decade of
research on autonomous cars: a pearl
white Audi TT-S that they intend to
race up Pikes Peak in September
2010 as a demonstration of how
accurately a vehicle can be con
trolled at the limits of handling. On
the outside, the car, nicknamed
"Shelley," looks little different from
any other TT-S. But under the hood,
the Audi's computerized control sys
tems transform it into a fully
autonomous rally car.
With the continued support of
Volkswagen and CARS' other affili
ates, Gerdes sees automotive innova
tions coming at an even faster pace in
the future.

"I'm not aware of any [other]
place that brings it all together,"
Gerdes said. "I think that's what's
really special here. Stanford is an
amazingly easy place to do interdisci
plinary research. The department
barriers, barriers across schools, are
very low.
"I think we've got a great oppor
tunity to do things that really cross
disciplines here," he added.

organizing regular meetings with
industry partners and reaching out to
companies for conferences and
expert roundtable discussions on
campus.

The research under CARS' wing,
much of which will be going on at
VAIL, includes work on electric and
autonomous vehicles, "ownership
models" like car sharing and ride
sharing, vehicle-to-vehicle communi
cation technologies, visual media in
the car and new engine technologies.

YAIL's Future
At the "Driving Innovation"
event held Oct. 24,
Volkswagen and CARS
also unveiled the cul-

mination of nearly a decade of
research on autonomous cars: a pearl
white Audi TT-S that they intend to
race up Pikes Peak in September
2010 as a demonstration of how
accurately a vehicle can be con
trolled at the limits of handling. On
the outside, the car, nicknamed
"Shelley," looks little different from
any other TT-S. But under the hood,
the Audi's computerized control sys
tems transform it into a fully
autonomous rally car.
With the continued support of
Volkswagen and CARS' other affili
ates, Gerdes sees automotive innova
tions coming at an even faster pace in
the future.

"I'm not aware of any [other]
place that brings it all together,"
Gerdes said. "I think that's what's
really special here. Stanford is an
amazingly easy place to do interdisci
plinary research. The department
barriers, barriers across schools, are
very low.
"I think we've got a great oppor
tunity to do things that really cross
disciplines here," he added.

The Center for Automotive Research at
Stanford (CARS) and Volkswagen Group
of America, Inc. commemorated five years
of collaboration on automotive research by
celebrating the soon-to-be completed
Volkswagen Automotive Innovation Lab
(VAIL).

Volkswagen is providing $2 million
toward the roughly $4 million capital cost of
the building an 8,000 square foot, ware
house-like research facility under construc
tion at the intersection of Stock Farm and
Oak Road. The company is also providing
$750,000 a year for the next five years to
Stanford researchers working on automo
tive technology.
"This definitely makes them stick out
among the automotive research partners,"
said Sven Beiker, executive director of
CARS.
Beiker said the most immediate benefit

of VAIL is that all the automotive
researchers on campus will finally be under
the same roof.

"There's really been no collaborative
area in past at ah, and in fact, there haven't
even really been good facilities for this,"
said Chris Gerdes, professor of mechanical
engineering. "So, we've really been begging,
borrowing and stealing space as we could,
and now there's going to be nice dedicated
space for ah these activities."
With VAIL, "The idea is that [there will
be] a very energetic exchange of ideas, skills
and people, and that the industry will find

this a great place to do automotive
research," Beiker said.

The building will include a shop area,
dedicated stalls for cars, a seminar room and
the driving simulator that currently resides
in the Mechanical Engineering Research
Building.

"It is a collaborative area, so nobody
really will own space," Gerdes said.
Gerdes expects VAIL to be finished by
February 2010, with a March move-in date.

Multidisciplinary Collaboration
The labs Volkswagen funds
include Gerdes' Dynamic Design
Laboratory, computer science and
electrical engineering Prof. Sebastian
Thrun's Artificial Intelligence Lab
(which designed and built Stanley,
the first autonomous vehicle to com
plete the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, or
DARPA, Grand Challenge in 2005)
and communication Prof. Cliff Nass'
Communication between Humans
and Interactive Media (CHIMe)
Lab.

Gerdes, Thrun and Nass were the
original three faculty members who
decided Stanford should have a cen
ter that brings together the key play
ers in academia and industry for
automotive research. They launched
CARS on Oct.l, 2008.
Today, CARS formally associates
with Stanford's departments of com
puter science, engineering and com
munication, but the organization is
also well-connected with the
Graduate School of Business, the
School of Law and Stanford's Global
Climate and Energy Project.
"What we're really hoping to do is
to bring in people who would like to
work with vehicles, people who are
doing other projects on campus
related to vehicles," Gerdes said.
"There's a good opportunity to bring
them under the roof."

Currently, CARS has five indus
try partners: Volkswagen, Bosch,
Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Each
affiliate pays a $50,000 annual mem
bership fee, which covers administra
tive costs for CARS. From there,
companies collaborate with individ
ual labs and often grant additional
funds for research.

Even with five affiliates, Beiker
believes CARS has room to expand.
"We want to grow it a little bit, so on
the order of 10,12 companies would
be nice," he said.
Part of Beiker's job as executive
director is to assure that members of
the auto industry can find research
counterparts here on campus, and
vice versa.

"Where there's maybe a research
group and they say, 'We're doing
exciting things but we definitely want
an industry partner'... you know
that you'll really get input from
industry as well," Beiker said.

Executive Director of
Volkswagen's Electronics Research
Lab Burkhard Huhnke agrees. He
says Volkswagen has worked on
Audi's Clean Air Initiative, a pro

gram geared toward automobile effi
ciency, with Stanford researchers.
Volkswagen is particularly interested
in communication between vehicles,
the human-machine interface and
on-board energy-regeneration tech
nologies, Huhnke said.
"Stanford is a fantastic partner,"
he said. "Especially when we started
our collaboration ... our experience
was fantastic. We had experience on
the car side, and [Thrun's Artificial
Intelligence Lab] had experience
with smart computers."

Huhnke believes the collabora
tion between CARS and
Volkswagen will continue into the
future, well beyond the five-year
grant period.
CARS is also responsible for
organizing regular meetings with
industry partners and reaching out to
companies for conferences and
expert roundtable discussions on
campus.

much of which will be going on at
