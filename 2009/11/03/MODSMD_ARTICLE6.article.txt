## Roommate Mystery Unique housing policy promotes diversity, causes frosh stress 
### FEDERICO DELABALZE 
Things are done differently at
Stanford from day one. On new
student move-in days across the
world, freshmen calmly greet
their roommates, whose faces
they've memorized through Facebook. At
Stanford, though, this isn't quite possible.
The policy is clear: incoming freshmen
can't ask for specific roommates and aren't
told their roommates' names beforehand.
It's over a month into Autumn quarter and
freshmen across campus are beginning to
speak out about the policy.
"I wish I could've picked my roommate,"
said Shane Hedge 'l3. "He would have been
someone from the rowing team. We would
wake up at the same times for practice and

it would work out perfectly."
However, Hedge admitted that having a
roommate who didn't match his own profile
so perfectly introduced him to new interests
and people, something he is grateful for.
"I wouldn't have been pushed past my
comfort zone and I wouldn't have gotten to
know people outside the rowing team," he
said. "I'm glad, in away. I was pushed."
Having a mystery roommate sparks
much stress for everyone. There are, after
all, many possible issues at hand out of
sync sleeping schedules, bad habits and ide
ological differences, among others. Stanford
tries to address these concerns by having
new students fill out questionnaires about
their lifestyle behaviors and preferences.
But international students, arriving in a
novel country with perhaps little knowledge
of what awaits them, appear particularly

rattled by the policy.
"I was definitely a little nervous," said
Nelson Estrada 'l3, a native of Nicaragua
who is now Dorm President of West Lag. "I
had heard some stories of other
Nicaraguans having bad experiences. I was
very surprised the first day since I was
expecting a double I didn't know I
could get a triple! I would've appreciated
knowing."
All the talk about extra stress due to
roommate compatibility is nonsense to
more pragmatic students who point out dif
ferent, mainly logistic, problems to rooma
mates remaining incognito.
"We brought two microwaves, two TVs,
two fridges, two everything," said Roy
Perkins 'l3. "I think it would be much bet
ter if we knew our roommate before to bet
ter coordinate."

Arcadio Morales, residence dean for
Stern Hall, explained that it is exactly
because some students face greater stress
that the policy is so valuable.
"[The policy] does create stress but it's
an equalizer," Morales said. "Whether
you're an international or a domestic stu
dent, you're approaching [Stanford] in the
same way and everyone starts on an equal
footing. In the long run it works beautiful
ly-"

Some older students are, indeed, ecstatic
about how things worked out in the long
run. Kimberly Conner 'll, who has spent
three years with her freshman roommate,
vividly remembers move-in day.
"I was anxious all that day but, as soon as
I met her it was fine," Conner said. "I
wouldn't have it any other way."
In fact, Conner holds that not knowing

her roommate beforehand was essential for
their friendship to grow.
"I'm from a rural part in Kentucky.
Cassidy [Lichtman 'll] is a volleyball player
from SoCal. I think if I had had a sheet with
all these facts about her, it would have made
me less anxious," Conner said. "However, I
might look at that list and assume we have
nothing in common and we wouldn't be
friends. Yet now, we're such good friends."
Yes, this policy is a small matter. But,
according to Morales, it's a big testament to
Stanford's boldness and goal to promote
diversity.

"Stanford sets its own trend. It identifies
its own uniqueness with these policies,"
Morales said with pride. "It's incomparable."

Although students are initially apprehensive
about meeting their roommates for the first
time, many are happy with their roommate
assignments.
