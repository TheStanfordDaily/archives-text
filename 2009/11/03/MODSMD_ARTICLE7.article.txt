# HANSSON MAKES BALLOT DEBUT
## Stanford IT finance director runs for San Mateo City Council seat; election today 
### KATHRYN ROETHEL 
In Fred Hansson's 33 years behind the
scenes of political campaigns and
local initiatives, he's helped create
dozens of red, white and blue cam
paign mailers like the one he now
holds. The only thing different about this
postcard is, for the first time ever, Fred's
face is on it.

Flansson is the assistant director of
finance for Stanford University's IT
department and is responsible for a $93
million budget. Fie has worked at Stanford
27 years.
At 57, he is making his public election
debut, running to keep the San Mateo City
Council seat council members unanimous
ly appointed him to last January. His inau
gural campaign has been marked with
unexpected triumph (several local officials,
including two of his four opponents, donat
ed to his war chest) and personal tragedy
(his stepmother and uncle died this sum
mer, and two weeks ago his father was
diagnosed with cancer and suffered a
stroke).
Yet the first-time candidate campaigns
on, estimating that he's personally knocked
on 4,000 San Mateo doors. He's guided by
the mantra he said his grandfather taught
him: "Don't complain about it go fix it."
Hat in the Ring
Hansson has lived his whole life in San
Mateo, prompting former Mayor Sue
Lempert to deem him "a rarity ... a local
official who was born and raised in the city
he now helps govern."
Because he's been doing many of the
same things for so long, it's surprising this
is the first time Hansson's name appears on
a ballot.
"I really enjoy the public process,"
Hansson said. "After finishing my eighth
year on the San Mateo Planning

Commission an appointed public office
I was about to be termed out. [Running
for the city council] was a natural next step
to stay involved."
He added that although he's cam
paigned for dozens of issues and candi

dates in the past, it's nerve-wracking to do
it on his own behalf.

"I realized after going to the first couple
of houses that I can't tell you how great I
am, but I can ask, 'what do you think we're
doing right and what do you think we're

doing wrong?"' Hansson said. "I've found
that people really light up when you ask
them for their ideas."

Hansson puts this technique into prac
tice every chance he gets. At an Oct. 20
candidates' forum and neighborhood asso
ciation meeting at Park School, an elemen
tary school in San Mateo, he was came
early and stayed late to chat with residents.
At the forum, he wore a sand-colored
suit and maroon shirt, bolstered by city
council and police department lapel pins
and a tie with a rainbow-colored toucan on
it. All of these embellishments were con
versation starters.
Before the forum, Hansson noted that
each neighborhood has its own pet issue.
"For the North Shoreview
Neighborhood Association, it was the four
digit cost of flood insurance," he said. "For
other neighborhoods, it's leash laws for
dogs. One neighborhood was concerned
about raccoons that keep knocking over
their trash cans."
The Finance Candidate
One issue that inevitably comes up,
though, is San Mateo's projected $4 million
budget deficit. As the only candidate or
sitting council member with profession
al experience in finance, that question
often falls to Hansson.
When responding, he tries to be realis
tic. Even if voters approve ballot measures
L and M, which would raise sales and hotel
taxes to curb the deficit, Hansson said San
Mateo may not be out of the woods.
"I think we're going to still struggle next
year," he said. "Finance isn't about
answers; it's about consequences. Which
consequences can you live with? If you
don't want to pay for [services], you're not
going to get them. People just need to
decide [which services] are important to
them."
It was logic like this that prompted San

Mateo City Council members to appoint
Hansson in the first place, A field of 14
applicants vied for the vacant council seat,
but Hansson emerged in the council's first
ballot 4 votes to 1. He carried the second
vote unanimously.
"With such an array of qualified candi
dates, in was stunning that the vote was 5-0
for Fred Hansson," Council member Jan
Epstein said, adding that she voted for him
after witnessing his eight years on the
Planning Commission.
"Fred was also involved in reviewing
plans for our new library and police sta
tion. Fred's careful, conscientious and con
sistent style impressed me," she added.

Competitors are Friends
Mayor Brandt Grotte is also up for re
election, making him one of Hansson's
competitors for the three open seats on the
city council. Yet their campaign signs sit
side-by-side in each other's yards and they
have made the maximum individual contri
butions to each other's campaigns.
In terms of campaign fundraising,
Hansson ranks third among the five candi
dates. He had raised $10,442, just behind
Lt. Robert Ross' $12,553 and far behind
David Lim's $23,277.

Hansson's endorsements include the
Sierra Club, the San Mateo Labor Council,
the San Mateo County Association of
Realtors and the San Mateo County
Democratic Party. He also has supporters
in County Supervisor Carol Groom, State
Assemblyman Jerry Hill and all four cur
rent city council members.
Hansson's city council fate will be
decided in today's election. Win or lose, he
and his wife will enjoy their first weekend
out of town since the campaign began in
August.
