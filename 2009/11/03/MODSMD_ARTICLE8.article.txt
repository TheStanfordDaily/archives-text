## Dept. of Energy grants $5M

As part of a $l5l million nation
al stimulus program for clean tech
nologies, a Stanford research team
has received a $5 million grant from
the U.S. Department of Energy's
Advanced Research Projects
Agency on Energy.
The team applied for the grant to
install energy use sensors in build
ings and residences around campus
and beyond. Out of 3,700 applica
tions, the Stanford team's proposal
was one of 350 that were then asked
to send in a full application. They
were then one of the few that
received funding.
"Our general goal is to leverage
wireless sensor technology with
behavioral techniques in order to
help people significantly reduce
their energy use," said Project
Director Carrie Armel, a research
associate at the Precourt Energy
Efficiency Center.
Increasingly common "smart
meters" are an example of wireless
sensor technology. The meters allow
homeowners, in addition to their
energy providers, to monitor their
energy use in real time how much
hot water and gas they consume, for
instance. The meters can also be
installed in vehicles.

Many states are considering
requiring the use of smart meters in
homes and businesses. California
will mandate their installation in

residences by 2012.
"The fact that we can now meas
ure how much energy is being con
sumed gives us a lot of additional
behavior change techniques that we
can use," Armel said. "It quantifies
energy use, provides people feed
back, and also provides clever ways
of visualizing the information."
"This allows people to compete
with others and compare themselves
in a valid way, so markets can be set
up for people to coordinate their
energy use if a cap is set on how
much energy can be used," she con
tinued.

The grant will be used to fund
twelve different projects, ranging
from electrical engineering of the
sensors to online games, to make
people aware of their energy use.
"One of the biggest pieces of this
project is its interdisciplinary focus,"
said communication Prof. Byron
Reeves, one of four principal inves
tigators on the grant. "Engineers
have teamed up with faculty in psy
chology and education, and faculty
from four different schools
[Medicine, Engineering, Education,
and Humanities and Sciences] are
involved."

Though full implementation of
the projects don't begin until next
fall, some pilot programs are already
in place.

Sensors have been installed in
the Gates Building, and mechanical
engineering Prof. Banny Banerjee is

heading a group to install sensors in
a student dorm. Reeves's team is
experimenting with installation in
homes.

But the grant project's teams
have goals beyond mere installation
of these sensors; many other organi
zations, such as the U.S.
Government, have already tried to
implement sensors but have found
that the existence of a sensor does
not guarantee a reduction in energy
use.

"Behavior has not been consid
ered often in thinking about energy
efficiency," Reeves said. "Engineers
will build a device, but not give
much thought to the people using
it."

The program's originality comes
from its attempt to connect mechan
ical innovation with human concern
about the environment.

"Our country has spent billions
of dollars to put energy use sensors
in people's homes, businesses and
cars," Reeves said. "All of this
money has been spent on creating
this informative environment, but
little has been spent on how to com
municate the findings.
"Our project is concerned abut
the intersection of human capabili
ties and intelligence with this idea,"
Reeves added. "The point of this
grant is to focus on the human side."
