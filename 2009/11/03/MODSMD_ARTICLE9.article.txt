## STANFORD AND GLADSTONE STUDY PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Scientists at Gladstone Institute
of Cardiovascular Disease and
Stanford University have teamed up
to use $lO million of federal funding
over the next seven years to see how
induced pluripotent stem cells can
repair damaged heart muscle.
Induced pluripotent stem cells,
which can develop into any cell type,
are adult stem cells that are manipu
lated to have embryonic-like qualities.

A collaboration between
Gladstone and Stanford will allow
the group to take advantage of
Stanford's tissue engineering
expertise and high-resolution imag
ing of cells with Gladstone's ability
to manipulate cells.
"This is an exciting opportunity
to work with the most talented
investigators in the field to acceler
ate the application of this promising
technology to real patient benefits,"
said Gladstone Cardiovascular
Institute Director Deepak
Srivastava in a press release.
