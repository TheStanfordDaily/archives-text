### BRIANNA PANG 
a.m. The alarm rings. I hit the
_ 1 snooze button and, five minutes
later, the alarm goes off again. I
1 turn it off and decide to just sleep
9 —A— in for the day.
While lying in bed, I realize that I have a Mandarin quiz this
morning, so I can't sleep in. I sprint around the room doing my
morning preparations.
I glance over at the laptop on my desk and realize that I
have yet to check my e-mail or Facebook for the day. Just five
minutes, I tell myself. I'll just check my notifications and then
I'll go to breakfast.
"I never log off," said Sabrina Pol 'l3. "It's more convenient
to just click on a button and be on Facebook."
It's 9:05 already. Where has the time gone? I decide to just
grab a granola bar for breakfast, rushing to barely make it to
my 9:15 class at the Quad.
Quiz, done! Now, time to think of a new status. Maybe I can
put up "Brianna Pang beasted this Mandarin quiz!"
"I make mental notes of things to put on my status later,"
said Tumisang Madigele 'l3.
Half an hour later, I receive a text message from Facebook
mobile. However, the message is too long and cuts off, and I
have to reply with "n" to see the next part of the message.
"Facebook message from Anna Soto ['l3]: Hey! How are ya
doing? GUESS WHAT HAPPENED T0..."
The suspense is too frustrating. I guess I should go check my
Facebook now to get the full message but only really quick
ly, because I need to do some homework. I check my message,
update my status quickly and then rush off to math lecture.
I wake up from my brief nap in math lecture and realize the
professor is still droning on about the Chain Rule. I wonder if
anyone has commented on my status yet. I hope I've gotten a
few 'likes.'
With class over, I return to my dorm and promise myself
that I will start on the math homework. After all, I retain more
information if I recopy my notes right after lecture. But first, I
should probably check my e-mail.
I finish sorting through the 32 e-mails that I received in the
past two hours. I decide to check Facebook, to see if anyone
had tried to contact me. After all, I don't want to be anti-social.
Great! Three likes and two comments! I'm popular! Hmm,
I haven't talked to the third commenter in a while. She proba
bly deserves a wall post.
After looking through all 503 of her pictures and her vari
ous statuses and wall posts, I feel reacquainted with her life
again. I decide to leave her a fairly generic, yet chipper wall
post: "Hey! Long time no talk. How are you doing?"
I need to do some homework. I change my status to reflect
my sudden burst of motivation. "Brianna Pang is on her grind."
It's noon and time for lunch. Maybe I'll start that
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) paper after I get back
from Lag Dining. I grab my laptop and head over to the lounge
to work.
I sit down, open my laptop and open a Microsoft Word doc
ument. I can't focus, so I go on Facebook again. Maybe this will
help my writer's block.
"Every time I touch the laptop, I log onto Facebook," Soto
said. "And I touch the laptop too often."
Why has no one commented on my status or pictures? I
could put up something to provoke people into looking at my
page. Maybe I'll think of another clever status.
I open up iTunes and find a song that fits my mood. I know
perfect!
"Brianna Pang my milkshake brings all the boys to the
yard."
I can't wait for others to comment on how insightful I am.
"When I'm listening to a song, I tend to quote a line to put
on my status," Madigele said.
An hour after heading to the lounge, I commit myself to the
idea of starting my paper. But wait, what's this? "Disney A.
Williams ['l2] just took the quiz 'What category kid were you
in high school?"' I just have to know this about myself. Maybe
I'll take it quickly and then get to work.
I break out of my Facebook daze, realizing that I just spent
