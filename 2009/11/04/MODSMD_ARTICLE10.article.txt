### BRIANNA PANG 
a.m. The alarm rings. I hit the
_ 1 snooze button and, five minutes
later, the alarm goes off again. I
1 turn it off and decide to just sleep
9 —A— in for the day.
While lying in bed, I realize that I have a Mandarin quiz this
morning, so I can't sleep in. I sprint around the room doing my
morning preparations.
I glance over at the laptop on my desk and realize that I
have yet to check my e-mail or Facebook for the day. Just five
minutes, I tell myself. I'll just check my notifications and then
I'll go to breakfast.
"I never log off," said Sabrina Pol 'l3. "It's more convenient
to just click on a button and be on Facebook."
It's 9:05 already. Where has the time gone? I decide to just
grab a granola bar for breakfast, rushing to barely make it to
my 9:15 class at the Quad.
Quiz, done! Now, time to think of a new status. Maybe I can
put up "Brianna Pang beasted this Mandarin quiz!"
"I make mental notes of things to put on my status later,"
said Tumisang Madigele 'l3.
Half an hour later, I receive a text message from Facebook
mobile. However, the message is too long and cuts off, and I
have to reply with "n" to see the next part of the message.
"Facebook message from Anna Soto ['l3]: Hey! How are ya
doing? GUESS WHAT HAPPENED T0..."
The suspense is too frustrating. I guess I should go check my
Facebook now to get the full message but only really quick
ly, because I need to do some homework. I check my message,
update my status quickly and then rush off to math lecture.
I wake up from my brief nap in math lecture and realize the
professor is still droning on about the Chain Rule. I wonder if
anyone has commented on my status yet. I hope I've gotten a
few 'likes.'
With class over, I return to my dorm and promise myself
that I will start on the math homework. After all, I retain more
information if I recopy my notes right after lecture. But first, I
should probably check my e-mail.
I finish sorting through the 32 e-mails that I received in the
past two hours. I decide to check Facebook, to see if anyone
had tried to contact me. After all, I don't want to be anti-social.
Great! Three likes and two comments! I'm popular! Hmm,
I haven't talked to the third commenter in a while. She proba
bly deserves a wall post.
After looking through all 503 of her pictures and her vari
ous statuses and wall posts, I feel reacquainted with her life
again. I decide to leave her a fairly generic, yet chipper wall
post: "Hey! Long time no talk. How are you doing?"
I need to do some homework. I change my status to reflect
my sudden burst of motivation. "Brianna Pang is on her grind."
It's noon and time for lunch. Maybe I'll start that
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) paper after I get back
from Lag Dining. I grab my laptop and head over to the lounge
to work.
I sit down, open my laptop and open a Microsoft Word doc
ument. I can't focus, so I go on Facebook again. Maybe this will
help my writer's block.
"Every time I touch the laptop, I log onto Facebook," Soto
said. "And I touch the laptop too often."
Why has no one commented on my status or pictures? I
could put up something to provoke people into looking at my
page. Maybe I'll think of another clever status.
I open up iTunes and find a song that fits my mood. I know
perfect!
"Brianna Pang my milkshake brings all the boys to the
yard."
I can't wait for others to comment on how insightful I am.
"When I'm listening to a song, I tend to quote a line to put
on my status," Madigele said.
An hour after heading to the lounge, I commit myself to the
idea of starting my paper. But wait, what's this? "Disney A.
Williams ['l2] just took the quiz 'What category kid were you
in high school?"' I just have to know this about myself. Maybe
I'll take it quickly and then get to work.
I break out of my Facebook daze, realizing that I just spent
the last hour stuck in a Facebook
quiz-taking chain. I now know that I
was a nerd in high school, that of all
drugs I am most like marijuana, my
best subject would be Potions if I
went to Hogwarts, Heidi Klum is the
Victoria's Secret angel most similar to
me, and as a kisser, I am passionate
and romantic. Oh, and I'm 75 percent
liked, according to the Liked or
Hated quiz. Tight.
"I tend to take a bunch of quizzes
on Facebook to kill time," Pol said.

I decide to work on the IHUM
paper again. I have been legitimately
trying to work for the last hour and a
half, but between Facebook and Texts
from Last Night, all I've done is read
the prompt.
I wonder what type of guy Daniel
Defoe was. Perhaps that would pro
vide some insight on this Robinson
Crusoe essay. Wikipedia can tell me.
Half an hour later, I have clicked
through Wikipedia and gone from an
entry about Defoe to the origins of
chocolate. Speaking of chocolate, I
think I may have found a potential
new status! "Brianna Pang did you
know that the word chocolate is de
rived from Spanish?"
I run through my Live Feed and

comment on every status possible. I
see that one of my friends is now in a
relationship with a girl I don't know.
Scandalous! I leave an angry yet jok
ing comment "Why haven't you
told me about this?" I click through
his photos and try to find more details
about this girl.
An old friend from high school
Facebook-Chats me, and I decide to
talk to him for a little bit. I'm feeling
nostalgic and enjoying catching up on
old times. The paper can wait.

After 15-or-so minutes of dull con
versation, Facebook Chat starts to get
on my nerves. Plus, my Internet keeps
cutting out and my messages are tak
ing too long to load.
The message is still "sending." He
signed off on me? Rude. And no, I do
not want to send a message, Face
book. Forget you. I'm getting back to
work.

"Facebook chat has its annoying
moments," said Christian Vega 'l3.
"Especially when you're trying to
have an important conversation."
I finish half of my outline for my
paper. I'm excited that I was so pro
ductive. Time to reward myself with a
little bit of Facebook. No. I decide to
control myself I'm on a roll.
I can't get Facebook off my mind.
I wonder how my best friend from
back home is doing? I wonder if peo
ple have commented my status? Who
was that hottie in that one picture I
was looking at in the morning? Note

to self: look into this later.
After 10 minutes of moral forti
tude, I can no longer resist the temp
tation to log in to Facebook. I change
my status again. "Brianna Pang is pro
ductive today!"
I also decide to change my profile
picture definitely not my best
look. With my newly revamped
photo, I decide to send a friend re
quest to Mr. Hottie from the picture.
I receive a notification saying my
roommate has tagged me in seven
photos. I browse through and see that
they are pictures from some frat party
a week ago. My face is sweaty, my hair
is frazzled and my makeup is
smeared. Disgusting. I go through an
un-tagging frenzy.
"Anytime I look bad in a picture or
I'm making a stupid face, I un-tag my
self," said Jackson Dartez 'l3.

I return to my home screen and
see that Facebook has a new friend
suggestion for me. My 60-year-old
high school math teacher has a Face
book? Intrigued, I click on his profile
and try to look through his photos,
but unfortunately, the profile is limit
ed.

6:30 rolls around and I decide to go
to dinner. I promise myself that I
won't go on Facebook for the rest of
the day. This IHUM paper has to get
done at some point.

signed off on me? Rude. And no, I do
not want to send a message, Face
book. Forget you. I'm getting back to
work.

"Facebook chat has its annoying
moments," said Christian Vega 'l3.
"Especially when you're trying to
have an important conversation."
I finish half of my outline for my
paper. I'm excited that I was so pro
ductive. Time to reward myself with a
little bit of Facebook. No. I decide to
control myself I'm on a roll.
I can't get Facebook off my mind.
I wonder how my best friend from
back home is doing? I wonder if peo
ple have commented my status? Who
was that hottie in that one picture I
was looking at in the morning? Note

to self: look into this later.
After 10 minutes of moral forti
tude, I can no longer resist the temp
tation to log in to Facebook. I change
my status again. "Brianna Pang is pro
ductive today!"
I also decide to change my profile
picture definitely not my best
look. With my newly revamped
photo, I decide to send a friend re
quest to Mr. Hottie from the picture.
I receive a notification saying my
roommate has tagged me in seven
photos. I browse through and see that
they are pictures from some frat party
a week ago. My face is sweaty, my hair
is frazzled and my makeup is
smeared. Disgusting. I go through an
un-tagging frenzy.
"Anytime I look bad in a picture or
I'm making a stupid face, I un-tag my
self," said Jackson Dartez 'l3.

I return to my home screen and
see that Facebook has a new friend
suggestion for me. My 60-year-old
high school math teacher has a Face
book? Intrigued, I click on his profile
and try to look through his photos,
but unfortunately, the profile is limit
ed.

6:30 rolls around and I decide to go
to dinner. I promise myself that I
won't go on Facebook for the rest of
the day. This IHUM paper has to get
done at some point.

a.m. The alarm rings. I hit the
_ 1 snooze button and, five minutes
later, the alarm goes off again. I
1 turn it off and decide to just sleep
9 —A— in for the day.
While lying in bed, I realize that I have a Mandarin quiz this
morning, so I can't sleep in. I sprint around the room doing my
morning preparations.
I glance over at the laptop on my desk and realize that I
have yet to check my e-mail or Facebook for the day. Just five
minutes, I tell myself. I'll just check my notifications and then
I'll go to breakfast.
"I never log off," said Sabrina Pol 'l3. "It's more convenient
to just click on a button and be on Facebook."
It's 9:05 already. Where has the time gone? I decide to just
grab a granola bar for breakfast, rushing to barely make it to
my 9:15 class at the Quad.
Quiz, done! Now, time to think of a new status. Maybe I can
put up "Brianna Pang beasted this Mandarin quiz!"
"I make mental notes of things to put on my status later,"
said Tumisang Madigele 'l3.
Half an hour later, I receive a text message from Facebook
mobile. However, the message is too long and cuts off, and I
have to reply with "n" to see the next part of the message.
"Facebook message from Anna Soto ['l3]: Hey! How are ya
doing? GUESS WHAT HAPPENED T0..."
The suspense is too frustrating. I guess I should go check my
Facebook now to get the full message but only really quick
ly, because I need to do some homework. I check my message,
update my status quickly and then rush off to math lecture.
I wake up from my brief nap in math lecture and realize the
professor is still droning on about the Chain Rule. I wonder if
anyone has commented on my status yet. I hope I've gotten a
few 'likes.'
With class over, I return to my dorm and promise myself
that I will start on the math homework. After all, I retain more
information if I recopy my notes right after lecture. But first, I
should probably check my e-mail.
I finish sorting through the 32 e-mails that I received in the
past two hours. I decide to check Facebook, to see if anyone
had tried to contact me. After all, I don't want to be anti-social.
Great! Three likes and two comments! I'm popular! Hmm,
I haven't talked to the third commenter in a while. She proba
bly deserves a wall post.
After looking through all 503 of her pictures and her vari
ous statuses and wall posts, I feel reacquainted with her life
again. I decide to leave her a fairly generic, yet chipper wall
post: "Hey! Long time no talk. How are you doing?"
I need to do some homework. I change my status to reflect
my sudden burst of motivation. "Brianna Pang is on her grind."
It's noon and time for lunch. Maybe I'll start that
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) paper after I get back
from Lag Dining. I grab my laptop and head over to the lounge
to work.
I sit down, open my laptop and open a Microsoft Word doc
ument. I can't focus, so I go on Facebook again. Maybe this will
help my writer's block.
"Every time I touch the laptop, I log onto Facebook," Soto
said. "And I touch the laptop too often."
Why has no one commented on my status or pictures? I
could put up something to provoke people into looking at my
page. Maybe I'll think of another clever status.
I open up iTunes and find a song that fits my mood. I know
perfect!
"Brianna Pang my milkshake brings all the boys to the
yard."
I can't wait for others to comment on how insightful I am.
"When I'm listening to a song, I tend to quote a line to put
on my status," Madigele said.
An hour after heading to the lounge, I commit myself to the
idea of starting my paper. But wait, what's this? "Disney A.
Williams ['l2] just took the quiz 'What category kid were you
in high school?"' I just have to know this about myself. Maybe
I'll take it quickly and then get to work.
I break out of my Facebook daze, realizing that I just spent
the last hour stuck in a Facebook
quiz-taking chain. I now know that I
was a nerd in high school, that of all
drugs I am most like marijuana, my
best subject would be Potions if I
went to Hogwarts, Heidi Klum is the
Victoria's Secret angel most similar to
me, and as a kisser, I am passionate
and romantic. Oh, and I'm 75 percent
liked, according to the Liked or
Hated quiz. Tight.
"I tend to take a bunch of quizzes
on Facebook to kill time," Pol said.

I decide to work on the IHUM
paper again. I have been legitimately
trying to work for the last hour and a
half, but between Facebook and Texts
from Last Night, all I've done is read
the prompt.
I wonder what type of guy Daniel
Defoe was. Perhaps that would pro
vide some insight on this Robinson
Crusoe essay. Wikipedia can tell me.
Half an hour later, I have clicked
through Wikipedia and gone from an
entry about Defoe to the origins of
chocolate. Speaking of chocolate, I
think I may have found a potential
new status! "Brianna Pang did you
know that the word chocolate is de
rived from Spanish?"
I run through my Live Feed and

comment on every status possible. I
see that one of my friends is now in a
relationship with a girl I don't know.
Scandalous! I leave an angry yet jok
ing comment "Why haven't you
told me about this?" I click through
his photos and try to find more details
about this girl.
An old friend from high school
Facebook-Chats me, and I decide to
talk to him for a little bit. I'm feeling
nostalgic and enjoying catching up on
old times. The paper can wait.

After 15-or-so minutes of dull con
versation, Facebook Chat starts to get
on my nerves. Plus, my Internet keeps
cutting out and my messages are tak
ing too long to load.
The message is still "sending." He
signed off on me? Rude. And no, I do
not want to send a message, Face
book. Forget you. I'm getting back to
