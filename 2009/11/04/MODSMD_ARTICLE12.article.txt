## Prinz lab builds scanning probe microscope Nanotech construction possible, prof, says 
### TYLER BROWN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Stanford professor is collaborat
ing with the U.S. Department of
Energy, Agilent Technologies and
Honda to create a new type of micro
scope that will be able to scan at the
atomic level and build nanotech
devices, researchers announced last
week.

Mechanical Engineering Chair
Friedrich Prinz said most of the micro
scope's basic technologies have been
available for more than a decade, but
he is using the technology in an entire
ly new capacity.
"What we are adding is a synthesis
capability," Prinz said. "In the past,
we've just put something [in the
microscope], looked at it and analyzed
it. Now, we try to build a structure with
the tool then analyze it with the same

tool."
Agilent spokesman Jack
Wenstrand said the company is very
involved in support the project. "It
gives us a chance to work with the
very best minds in the world, capitaliz
ing [on] years of investment, having
those people apply their thinking to
advance measurement science,"
Wenstrand said.

"We really try to build these con
nections because what we find is that
we are actually able to contribute
maybe financially, but intellectually to
the research because of our knowl
edge 0f... how to make accurate
measurements where the real practi
cal problems are in the world," he con
tinued.

Prinz said the Department of
Energy was providing funding, while
Wenstrand confirmed Honda's
involvement. Honda could not be
reached for comment.
The Science
The device, called a "scanning
probe microscope," is designed to

operate at the atomic scale. The "scan
ning probe" on the microscope is a
tiny tip that moves over the subject
being studied.
The device in Prinz's lab is capable
of "atomic force microscopy" (AFM)
and "scanning tunneling microscopy"
(STM), alternative methods of detect
ing the crystalline structure of
nanoscale devices.

"As far as we know, this is the only
instrument in the world that combines
ALD and a STM into one system,"
said Phil Van Stockum, a Ph.D. stu
dent in physics and a member of
Prinz's lab.

In both, "you monitor the interac
tion between the surface and your tip
and use that information to control
the distance between the tip and the
surface," said James Mack, a Ph.D. stu
dent in mechanical engineering.
In AFM, a flexible cantilever with
a sharp tip bends as it passes over
structures and features on the surface.
The cantilever's movement is moni
tored with a laser, which then gener
ates information on the physical struc

ture of the surface.
In STM, a voltage is applied to the
scanning tip. The electric current that
passes between the tip and the object
being scanned is monitored to deduce
its physical structure.
"This technique is actually the
most sensitive," Mack said. "You can
see individual atoms in a crystal lattice
on the surface. It's very powerful."
Van Stockum, who joined Prinz's
lab in January 2009 when work on this
microscope began, helped design a
system to isolate the microscope from
external vibrations. To prevent sound
waves from interfering with the scan
ning resolution, the device is con
tained within a vacuum chamber and
located in a soundproofed box within
a soundproofed room.
The support structure includes a
200-pound slab of granite and bungee
cords that are designed to prevent
seismic tremors from affecting the
scanning tip.
"In the experiment, it's literally
