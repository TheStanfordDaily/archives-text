## EDITORIAL One year later, Afghanistan is the elephant in the room 
### 
Exactly a year ago today, this country
made a monumental statement by
electing a young junior senator from
Illinois, Barack Obama, to be President of the
United States. The president captured our
hearts with promises of change and hope.
What set Barack Obama apart from his De
mocratic and Republican rivals was that he
was and is a charismatic leader blessed with
the gift of persuasion, and intelligent enough
to tackle the multitude of problems that face
our nation.

luxury we would be less critical of the presi
dent's inaction. But, quite to the contrary, the
clock is ticking in Afghanistan, as every day
the president stalls, American troops are
dying, terrorists organizations are growing
more audacious and the country is growing
more impatient.

For better or worse, President George W.
Bush made decisions. Although most of the
country was disapproving of the decisions he
made, President Bush was able to act based on
whatever information was available. And al
though his instincts often proved to be mistak
en, President Bush demonstrated what we ex
pect of the highest leader in our country: deci
siveness. In this department, Obama still has
plenty to learn.There are some issues that face
our nation that deserve our patience on the
president's behalf, such as health care and eco
nomic recovery. But the war in Afghanistan
has been going on for over eight years and has
shown very little improvement for the people
there, and no greater sense of security for the
United States. Quite frankly, President
Obama, our patience is wearing thin.
The Editorial Board does not expect the
president to know exactly how or when this
war is going to end. Whatever strategy he pur
sues may change tomorrow, and we accept
that these circumstances often require an
adaptive attitude. We do not expect President
Obama to have all of the answers, but we do
expect him to have a plan. He asked us a year
ago to believe in the "audacity of hope," but,
in the year since, has done little in
Afghanistan that could be considered auda
cious or hopeful. Every day that our troops
remain in Afghanistan's political limbo is an
other day they remain in great danger. The
president has the support of Congress, and for
now he still maintains high approval ratings
domestically and abroad. So, while President
Obama still has a significant deal of trust and
influence, it would appear that today, not to
morrow, is the time to make a decision on
Afghanistan.

But today, many of us are disappointed
with the president, not because of what he has
done in the past year, but because of what he
has not done. Of all of the boxes that remain
unchecked on President Obama's campaign
promise checklist, perhaps the most disap
pointing is the task of developing a new strat
egy for the war in Afghanistan. As the first
year of Mr. Obama's presidency comes to a
close, the circumstances in Afghanistan
would be the same as when he entered office,
notwithstanding the increase in violence.
With the deadliest month in the history of
the U.S. presence in Afghanistan concluding
this past week, the Editorial Board feels the
need to stress the urgency for developing a vi
able strategy in Afghanistan. We understand
that any foreign policy decisions particu
larly those involving military actions re
quire a great deal of deliberation, and we do
not intend to rush the president to a decision
that would endanger more American sol
diers. However, in a situation as urgent as the
one in which America finds herself, time is a
luxury we cannot always afford.
The fact of the matter is simple: This coun
try would not have elected President Obama
if we did not trust his ability to make decisions
under the most severe pressures. The presi
dent has demonstrated his very deliberate and
thoughtful decision-making process, but has
chosen to postpone many key decisions in
order to make a more informed decision. This
is certainly not a bad thing, and if time were a
