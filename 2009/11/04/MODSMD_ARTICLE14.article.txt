# GET IT RIGHT
## Back off My Beef 
### Erica Morgan 
At the risk of infuriating the sustainabili
ty community, I am compelled to offer
my commentary regarding the useless
propaganda promoted in Stanford dining
halls. Never fear, I am not referring to the
trayless movement. This week, I entertained
myself in Stern Dining with the newly posted
signs encouraging students to drop essential
nutrients from their diets various days of the
week. Mondays: go without red meat! Tues
days: no dairy products! Fridays: go complete
ly meatless! As student initiatives continue to
push self-denial for politically correct rea
sons, I remain skeptical.
The push for vegetarianism and veganism
is being promoted with unprecedented fer
vor, but until recently, I hadn't been able to
identify coherent arguments for this faddish
diet. I was taken aback last week when a veg
etarian acquaintance congratulated me for
the lack of red meat on my plate. She was ex
cited that I was doing my part to save the en
vironment, reduce my carbon footprint and
end famine. It would be morally gratifying to
believe that cutting meat from my diet could
heal the world's wounds, but I find this pre
scribed insta-fix lacking in credibility.
Socially conscious veg-heads would have
us believe that a vegetarian diet is superior in
a plethora of ways. Lord Stern of Brentford
(acclaimed adviser on the economics of cli
mate change) announced, "Meat is a wasteful
use of water and creates a lot of greenhouse
gases. It puts enormous pressure on the
world's resources. A vegetarian diet is better."
The aforementioned pollution supposedly oc
curs in the form of pesticides, exhaust from
farm equipment and, perhaps most impor
tantly, methane from cow manure. Additional
ly, meat production/consumption is wasteful
because resources could be diverted to grain
production: It takes fifteen pounds of grain to
produce one pound of meat. Of course, we
could end world hunger with a 15x grain sur
plus! The conservation journal Soil and Water
announces that one acre of land used for ani
mal agriculture could produce 40,000 pounds
of potatoes, instead of 250 pounds of beef.
There you have it. How could you not go
vegetarian? Before tossing out my chicken
tenders, I have a few questions. How would
conversion to vegetarianism eliminate pesti
cides and farm equipment emissions? An es
timated 37 percent of pesticides used in
America are directed toward livestock and
feed crop agriculture. This means a whopping
63 percent of the 500,000 tons of pesticides
used annually provide us with our fruits and
veggies. Assuming we kill the meat industry, I
predict that pesticide levels will not drop, but
be maintained to support the increase in grain
production (which is a feed crop). I can't fig-

ure out how the need for farm equipment will
vanish with the cessation of meat consump
tion either.

The famine argument may sound more
convincing, but is problematic on a number of
levels. Roughly two-thirds of the Earth's dry
land cannot be used for agriculture. Open
ranges and mountainous grazing lands that
help sustain the meat industry cannot be used
to grow grains. The practicality of land usage
aside, it is illogical to think that vegetarian
crops used to feed livestock would be instru
mental in ending world hunger. BBC corre
spondent Alex Kirby pushes for a reduction
in the meat industry, but makes a keen obser
vation: "The world does produce enough to
feed everyone. But the food is often in the
wrong place or can't be stored long enough."
The problem is clearly not a shortage of grain.
On to the manure methane argument: All
plant-eating animals produce methane when
they excrete. Especially ruminants. If you
want to eliminate cow manure, you should
also be worried about dairy cattle, sheep,
goats, camels, etc. Therefore, the elimination
of these animals is crucial to the preservation
of the planet. This line of reasoning conve
niently ignores the uses of animal manure as
fertilizer in large-scale agricultural farming,
for soil enrichment and as a fuel source. As a
side note, humans also produce methane on a
small scale. I have grave concerns that in
creasing consumption of high fiber fruits and
veggies may exponentially increase the quan
tity of methane created by human flatulence.
Don't say you weren't warned.
This article is not an attack on vegetarian
ism (which is a personal choice). It is a defense
of omnivores (also a personal choice). Anthro
pological data supports the fact that humans
evolved as meat eaters. Perhaps a meat-free
diet can meet nutritional needs for human de
velopment, but scientific studies continue to
raise concerns about protein deficiencies in a
vegetarian lifestyle. Processed soy rich in
trypsin inhibitors hinder protein digestion, and
soybeans lose nutritional content when treat
ed to create meat substitutes. Also worth con
sidering: U.N. figures imply that meat produc
tion is responsible for 18 percent of carbon
emissions and this figure includes the produc
tion of animal feed like soy. Well, I hate to
break it to the environmentalists, but soy pro
duction is certainly not going down in a vege
tarian world.

Vegetarians: enjoy your soy. But some
beano might be in order because your hot air is
bothering the carnivores (and possibly warm
ing the planet).
