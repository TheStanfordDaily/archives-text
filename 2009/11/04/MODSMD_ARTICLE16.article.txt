# THE 						PENSIEVE
## Harry Potter and the Perfect Patronus 
### Melanie Horm Brian Wanyoike 
"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave
us? You think that we don't recall them more
clearly than ever in times of great trouble?"
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban,p. 427

We'd like to think that Stanford stu
dents have the whole preparation
thing down. We somehow make
sure that we have all our random GERs and
units in so we can graduate and waste im
mense amounts of time evaluating just how
much time we can waste before we're actual
ly royally screwed. While such forms of
preparation and anticipation are clearly im
portant, Harry's experiences in his third year
have much to say about ways in which we can
be prepared for otherwise daunting obsta
cles.

That year Harry encounters foul crea
tures known as dementors, creatures who
suck the happiness and souls out of their vic
tims — think 9 a.m. class unpleasantness
times 1,891. Because of Harry's past horrors,
the dementors particularly affect his well
being, so he desperately attempts to find a
way to combat them. Harry learns the Pa
tronus Charm from Professor Lupin, which
allows him to use his own happy memories to
repel the dementors. Through using the
charm, Harry realizes just how much the peo
ple in his life have equipped him to stand firm
in the face of apparent despair.
Admittedly, we may not deal with Harry
like traumas in our lives. After all, last time
we checked, we don't know of any infants
branded with wizard-made scars on their
foreheads. Still, to certain degrees, we have
all gone through and will go through person
al struggles. We may be horrified by a cata
strophic event that was beyond our control,
bomb an important midterm or final, and be
overwhelmed when we try to tackle the
world's seemingly insurmountable evils.
Thus, knowing that we share like hardships
with Harry, we can then look to his own jour
ney for wisdom and inspiration.
In Lupin's instructions to Harry on how to
cast a Patronus, it is evident that it requires a
simple yet difficult act concentrating on
something that makes us happy. At first

thought, the idea seems trivial and almost
comical. When immersed in our darkest mo
ments, what most of us feel like we desperate
ly need is a hug from our mothers, friends
who can talk and walk us through things, and
mentors who can sit down and give us a plan
of action. In short, we tend to feel as if we
need certain people to be tangible and phys
ically present with us to comfort and provide
us with the fortitude to tackle the crushing
weight of life's problems.

Despite the fact that these people are
probably still on earth, unlike Harry's late fa
ther, they can still feel wholly inaccessible to
us while we are away from home or embark
ing on new personal battles in the future. We
may find ourselves feeling overwhelmingly
alone and helpless. Interestingly, while feel
ing those same emotions, Harry is able to
draw from within himself to produce a Pa
tronus that, much to his surprise, materializes
as a stag the animal into which his father
would transform. As a result, Harry recog
nizes just how significant his experiences
with and feelings about other people are, par
ticularly with respect to his father. They are
not mere fleeting moments of delight, but po
tent weapons he can use to somehow stay
standing amid the greatest of troubles.
Although it is probably not advantageous
or even possible to consciously store up good
memories and positive interactions, it is im
perative that we come to appreciate just how
powerful these experiences are. Because
when those finals-tough-life-decisions-over
whelming-hardship dementors come, we
need to be prepared to whip out our own Pa
tronuses. To successfully cast them, we must
be grounded in the songs our mothers used to
sing us, the first time we engaged deeply with
what we were passionate about, and that 3
a.m. conversation with a friend who gave us
odd clarity about life. We must realize the
memories of those whom we come in contact
with might just be what give us the courage to
trudge forward when life comes less easily.
For proximity, whether measured in miles or
breaths, does not correlate directly with the
intimacy and power of our most emotionally
inundated experiences.
We could also just pass up messing around
with such a complicated spell and surrender
to the eminent failure that is our lives. Things
aren't looking so great after all didn't you
see that big black dog around the math cor
ner last week?

Melanie and Brian aren't quite sure what ani
mal form their Patronuses take. If you have any
inklings, or can teach them the spell, e-mail
