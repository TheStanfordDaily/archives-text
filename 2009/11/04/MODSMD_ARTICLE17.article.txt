## FOOTBAU SPECIAL UNSUNG HERO Long snapper Nolan keys Cardinal special teams unit 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Among the many positions represented on a football team,
there may not be a less recognized one than the long snapper.
Although some play on offense and defense, many are just
in on special teams for a few plays a game, when their squad
lines up to attempt a field goal, extra point, or punt. Given the
lack of attention paid to linemen overall, it isn't uncommon
for the long snapper to be confused with a center.
Indeed, outside of diehard supporters, long snappers gen
erally remain anonymous until they've made a mistake. Trey
Junkin, a legend in the field, is remembered most for a single
botched snap in the 2003 NFL playoffs and not for his 19-year
pro career.

But behind the veil is a carefully crafted skill that is integral
to the success of a team at large. As Junkin fatefully demon
strated, an errant snap can be the difference between victory
and defeat.

Stanford's Zach Nolan, a redshirt junior, has held down the
Cardinal's long snapping duties for the past two years. That is
his sole responsibility "All I do is long snap," he said and
one that he is meticulously devoted to.
Few long snappers assume the job by design. Former Car
dinal snapper Brent Newhouse, for example, started his ca
reer because he wanted out of a running drill in a high school
practice.

Like many others in the long snapping fraternity, Nolan
happened upon the duties by chance. During his time at the
Pine Crest School in Florida, Nolan was tossing a ball around
with his friend Sam Young, the current starting right tackle for
Notre Dame. They decided to throw the ball between their
legs and the rest is history.

"His was terrible, but mine ended up spiraling," Nolan said.
"He went and told the coach about me, said, 'Hey, Nolan can
long snap.' Coach then called me up and said, 'Hey, we need
you to long snap.' I had no idea what to do so I was out there
improvising, but eventually you get into it and get the tech
nique down."

Nolan was recruited solely as a long snapper and received
interest from a number of schools. But he had been set on
Stanford and joined the team as a walk-on in 2006.
Since then, he has tried to perfect his craft. His procedure
is different depending on the situation.
"A punter is standing back there 14 yards and you're trying
to get it to him quickly and accurately and you're also trying
to block. On field goals, it's more about being accurate. You
don't have to wing it back there as fast, because he's only back
there seven yards. You just need to hit his hands and let him
do the rest."

The literal snap is not the only difference.
"On field goals, I try and stand my ground and make sure
no one goes through me," he said. "My stance is narrower for
punts because I have to not only snap it faster, but get back to
block a rusher."

Blocking can be a tall task for a long snapper. Though they
are technically linemen, many are not as large as their compa
triots. Nolan, for example, is 220 pounds, while other blockers
are almost always 285 pounds and heavier. Nolan routinely
has to face defenders who hover around the 300-pound mark.
"Thank God I have a lot of help from the guys next to me,"
he said. "But we get the best looks that we ever see in practice,
so in a game it's not a big deal, you don't think about it."
Since Nolan focuses solely on snapping, his practice rou
tine is different from everyone except for the kickers and pun
ters.

"We do field goals and punts right away, then [the offense and
defenses goes] off and does their scout team stuff," he said.
"While they're doing that, we have a lot of time to hone our
craft."

In the process, long snapping becomes a passion and it cer
tainly is one for Nolan. Though he'll graduate in the spring, he
has one more year of eligibility remaining and he's currently
looking at coterminal programs so that he can stay with the
team.

"Hopefully they'll have me back," he said.
He then added the essential long snapping qualifier: "As
long as I do my job."
