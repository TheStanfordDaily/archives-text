# Bright future for Stanford basketball
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
It will be a long year for Cardinal
men's basketball fans Haley
Murphy covered as much in her
column yesterday. That's not why
we're here. Rather, we're going to dis
cuss the light at the end of the tunnel. Be
cause, while Stanford enters this season
with a roster exhausted due to gradua
tion, injuries and suspensions, the talent
coming to The Farm next year may make
the next few months a bit easier to take.

In just his second year, coach Johnny
Dawkins has already landed five mar
quee recruits for the class of 2010 and he
may not be done. The turnaround has
been rapid. He lost the commitment of
four-star forward Miles Plumlee shortly
after taking the Stanford job and his first
two hauls brought in just one player
ranked at their position by Scout.com.

Now, Dawkins has a highly ranked class
of five commits, including two three
stars and two four-stars, who could pro
vide immediate help next season.
Anthony Brown, a small forward, is
the jewel of the class so far. He is the
highest rated Stanford prospect since
the Lopez twins. He can play anywhere
from the two to the four and has a
wingspan that is longer than normal for
his 6'6" frame. A natural scorer, scouts
have raved about his shooting touch

and ESPN has compared him to former
Cardinal star Josh Childress. While he is
slender, he has bulked up over the past
year to prepare himself for the colle
giate game the Pac-10 is a notorious
ly physical conference.

Perhaps the most compelling thing
about Brown's recruitment is the rela
tionship he developed with Dawkins,
which was apparently tremendously
strong, so much so that it became one of
the single biggest factors in his decision.
We've heard the stories about football
coach Jim Harbaugh's highly personal
approach to recruiting, which has
seemed to work throughout his tenure.
If Dawkins can establish a similar rap
port with his targets, then it bodes well

for the Cardinal's chances at landing
players well into the future.
After giving his verbal commit
ment, Brown did not go back to sim
ply being a high school senior in
stead, he helped Dawkins reel in his
friend and top center prospect
Dwight Powell, who committed less
than two weeks after Brown.

Powell, who can also play power
forward, embodies the evolving role
of big men in upper level basketball.
He runs the floor well, has a reliable
jumper out to 15 feet and can natural
ly rotate along the perimeter. He's a
high-energy, dedicated player who is
currently studying and training at the
elite IMG sports academy. Like
Brown, he needs to add weight, par
ticularly if he wants to be effective in
the post and on the boards, but the
strength conditioning between high
school and college, even at a place
like IMG, is massive these im
provements will come in time.

The Cardinal's latest recruit is
Josh Huestis, a forward from Mon
tana who won the state's Player of
the Year award as a junior. Huestis is
well rounded and averaged five
blocks a game last year a gaudy
total, no matter the level, that
demonstrated his aggressiveness
around the basket. Concerns about
competition (Montana isn't exactly a
basketball powerhouse) proved
baseless when he stood out in nation
al summer camps, where he showed
off not only his defense, but also good
ball handling and distribution skills.

Stanford's tallest recruit is also
good with the ball in his hands
power forward John Gage's excep
tional passing and feel for the game
alone was worth an offer. He can dish
out assists on the perimeter or under
neath the basket and can score from
practically anywhere on the court.

But not all of Stanford's recruits
are forwards and centers. Aaron
Bright is an offensively inclined,
pass-first point guard with a deft
touch from behind the arc. He has
been lauded for his decision making
and generally aggressive play, which
allows him to cut to the hoop as well

as match up tight on his man.
The range of talent between these
five men alone is remarkable. There
are skillful passers in both the front
and back courts coupled with aggres
sive slashers. All have good athleti
cism and reliable jump shots and, in
scouting reports, each one is de
scribed as savvy high basketball
IQs are, as always, at a premium.
And Dawkins might not be done.
The common belief is that there are
six scholarships to dole out this year,
which means that the team has one
left. Small forward Jason Morris, for
example, is still on the board and
would cap off a class in impressive
and declarative fashion.

The future is becoming increas
ingly bright for Stanford basketball
and given that two starters of an al
ready depleted team will graduate
after this year, the incoming fresh
men will have every opportunity to
contribute.

All that's required now is a little
patience.
