# Bright future for Stanford basketball
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
It will be a long year for Cardinal
men's basketball fans Haley
Murphy covered as much in her
column yesterday. That's not why
we're here. Rather, we're going to dis
cuss the light at the end of the tunnel. Be
cause, while Stanford enters this season
with a roster exhausted due to gradua
tion, injuries and suspensions, the talent
coming to The Farm next year may make
the next few months a bit easier to take.

In just his second year, coach Johnny
Dawkins has already landed five mar
quee recruits for the class of 2010 and he
may not be done. The turnaround has
been rapid. He lost the commitment of
four-star forward Miles Plumlee shortly
after taking the Stanford job and his first
two hauls brought in just one player
ranked at their position by Scout.com.

Now, Dawkins has a highly ranked class
of five commits, including two three
stars and two four-stars, who could pro
vide immediate help next season.
Anthony Brown, a small forward, is
the jewel of the class so far. He is the
highest rated Stanford prospect since
the Lopez twins. He can play anywhere
from the two to the four and has a
wingspan that is longer than normal for
his 6'6" frame. A natural scorer, scouts
have raved about his shooting touch

and ESPN has compared him to former
Cardinal star Josh Childress. While he is
slender, he has bulked up over the past
year to prepare himself for the colle
giate game the Pac-10 is a notorious
ly physical conference.

Perhaps the most compelling thing
about Brown's recruitment is the rela
tionship he developed with Dawkins,
which was apparently tremendously
strong, so much so that it became one of
the single biggest factors in his decision.
We've heard the stories about football
coach Jim Harbaugh's highly personal
approach to recruiting, which has
seemed to work throughout his tenure.
If Dawkins can establish a similar rap
port with his targets, then it bodes well
