## VSO funding plea divides U.G. senators Senator says burden falls on groups to figure out' policies 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate was
torn yesterday about whether a Web site fail
ure that limited access to special fees funding
procedures was reason enough to allow a stu
dent group to dip deeper into its reserves for
travel expenses than stipulated in budget
modification policy guidelines.
Tommy Tobin 'lO, co-director of the
Stanford Project on Hunger (SPOON), plead
ed with the body to allow the group to allot an
additional $lOO to $2OO from its reserves
toward covering travel expenses for a repre
sentative of the group to attend a national
conference.

SPOON initially requested $2,400 for
three students to the conference, but later
adjusted its request to a more modest $5OO
after deciding to only budget for one student
representative to attend. Still, the $5OO
request exceeds the amount the group is
allowed to withdraw from its reserves for
travel expenditure.

"We have explicit funding policies with
regard to travel expenses," said
Appropriations Committee Chair Anton
Zietsman 'l2. "We have been applying these
policies since spring quarter last year."
According to the policy, special fees groups
can fund travel expenses up to $4OO or 75 per
cent of the cost, whichever is lower. Although
listed on the Appropriations Web site, the pol
icy regarding reserve budget modifications
was inaccessible for groups who searched pol
icy guidelines on the special fees Web site,
whose links were no longer active.
"How are [student groups] supposed to
find the resources if all the links are broken?"
questioned Deputy Chair Kelsei Wharton 'l2.
"Let's not set a precedent that we're going to
make mistakes and let them slide."
Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll made
clear that the Senate needs to hold itself
