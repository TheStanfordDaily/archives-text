## VSO funding plea divides U.G. senators Senator says burden falls on groups to figure out' policies 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate was
torn yesterday about whether a Web site fail
ure that limited access to special fees funding
procedures was reason enough to allow a stu
dent group to dip deeper into its reserves for
travel expenses than stipulated in budget
modification policy guidelines.
Tommy Tobin 'lO, co-director of the
Stanford Project on Hunger (SPOON), plead
ed with the body to allow the group to allot an
additional $lOO to $2OO from its reserves
toward covering travel expenses for a repre
sentative of the group to attend a national
conference.

SPOON initially requested $2,400 for
three students to the conference, but later
adjusted its request to a more modest $5OO
after deciding to only budget for one student
representative to attend. Still, the $5OO
request exceeds the amount the group is
allowed to withdraw from its reserves for
travel expenditure.

"We have explicit funding policies with
regard to travel expenses," said
Appropriations Committee Chair Anton
Zietsman 'l2. "We have been applying these
policies since spring quarter last year."
According to the policy, special fees groups
can fund travel expenses up to $4OO or 75 per
cent of the cost, whichever is lower. Although
listed on the Appropriations Web site, the pol
icy regarding reserve budget modifications
was inaccessible for groups who searched pol
icy guidelines on the special fees Web site,
whose links were no longer active.
"How are [student groups] supposed to
find the resources if all the links are broken?"
questioned Deputy Chair Kelsei Wharton 'l2.
"Let's not set a precedent that we're going to
make mistakes and let them slide."
Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll made
clear that the Senate needs to hold itself
responsible for making sure its poli
cies are clearly stated on the Web.
Although the links on the special
fees Web site to the policy stipula
tions are dead, Zietsman assured
the group that he attached a correct
link to the Appropriations Web site,
where policies are clearly outlined,
in his correspondences with student
groups.
"Essentially, the burden falls on
the groups to figure out what the
policies are," he said. "I just don't
want us to set the precedent that
groups can come on the Senate floor
post-appropriations meeting and
plead for more money and get
more."
However, whether the policy
guidelines listed on the
Appropriations Web site apply to
both general and special fees needs
to be more clearly defined, accord
ing to Nanci Howe, director of
Student Activities and Leadership.
"I think there may be some mis
leading pieces of information on the
Web site," Howe suggested. "It's not
complete enough for groups to be
doing the planning that they need."

Still, Senate Parliamentarian
Alex Katz *l2 was convinced that a
technical Web site issue was not rea-

son enough to allow an exception to
the policy.
"You made your budget based
on those policies, so you should be
well aware of those policies," he
said.

Katz and Sivaram both were of
the same mind that an apology was
due, along with the immediate
updating of the special fees Web
site.

"We did fail to put up policies
explicitly on the Web site that's
our mistake," Sivaram told The
Daily after the heated debate that
breached issues of the body's
accountability. "If we ever make
another mistake again, the student
body is going to suffer fiscally."

Senators considered their own
fiscal responsibility when examining
their spending so far this year, and
considered how to budget properly
into a financially squeezed academ
ic year for the University as a whole.
Zietsman reported that the
body's spending has increased sig
nificantly this year, and has already
far surpassed both spending last fall
as well as the proposed budget for
this year.
Although the Senate has recom
mended fewer groups for funding

than in previous years, those funded
groups have already requested
$60,000 more than last fall, with
over a month left in the quarter.
With more student groups
approaching the Senate for more
funding earlier in the year, the
Senate is likely to see a continued
rise in its spending this quarter.
"It is still too early to tell,"

Zietsman said on possible need for
adjustments in budgeting. "It looks

as though groups are heeding our
advice and are coming in early,
which would explain the discrepan
cies in numbers."

Financial matters aside, the
Senate welcomed Leonard Parker
'lO as its new Webmaster and offi
cially confirmed freshman Senate
associates.
