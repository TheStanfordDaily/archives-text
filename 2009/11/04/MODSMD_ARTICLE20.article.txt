# IM REFEREES UNVEILED

In a school with students as competitive as
Stanford's, could pitting two groups of stu
dents against each other in battle, while el
evating other students to decide winners
and losers and who gains the epic final
prize of free t-shirts, ever be a good idea?
The answer, it turns out, is only if those who
judge are qualified.
These qualifications have been a contentious
issue in Stanford intramural sports for years.
Most people enjoy their intramurals, reminis
cent, perhaps, of a more innocent high school
time and Stanford's Web site boasts over 9,000
participants in 37 intramural sports. Stanford in
tramurals seem characterized by an unfortunate
mixture of students that might not have their
priorities rightly sport-oriented colliding with
students whose priorities fall too far toward
sports-orientation, all presided over by referees
that might count only one PowerPoint presenta

tion as their sporting experience.
Since intramurals accept everyone, the
league fills with people who played three years
ago in high school and want to relive the glory,
people whose friends promised them free pizza
if they'd join so they'd have enough people for a
team, as well as those who view intramurals as
one step down from the Olympics in prestige
and importance. In a league where team names
range from "Baby Seal Clubbers" to "Apathetic
Mountain Lions," you know some competition
levels might fall out of sync.
This mismatch can lead to some grueling
struggles out on the field. Though many of the
intramural games lead to exciting play and close
scores, some can seem like massacres to fresh
men surprised by the competition.
"When I was doing football [as a freshman],"
said sophomore Joshua Alvarez, "the most in
timidating group was the Graduate School of

Business. All of their
team last year was ex-mili
tary football players."
In Stanford's academic
environment, some students
view athletics/going i
outside/showering and I
breathing as falling secondary 1
when midterm season picks up, I
while others channel their !
stress into flag football rages.
Unfortunately for the latter,
careless or overworked teams
miss the kickoff fairly frequently.

another student;

of three or four games the other team
didn't even show up," said sophomore
Nick Mendoza, who led the Junipero
intramural flag football team last
year. "Then you get these teams that
are so, so into intramural sports.
There's a big differentiation. People
are either not into it at all, or they take
it as life or death."

For the students caught in the mid
dle, things can get hot and heavy in all
the wrong ways. Intramural referee
ing is a student job with a relatively
high salary and no sports qualifica
tions needed. New referees attend a
single training session before the sea
son starts and learn the rules from a
slide show.
"The PowerPoint is about 45 slides
and we go through it in about 10 min
utes," said sophomore intramural su
pervisor Josh Alvarez. "It's a lot of in
formation, it is difficult to retain. But
for most of the games you don't need
to know 75 percent."
Perhaps caused by that elusive 75
percent, conflicts between players
and referees seem not uncommon. As
some players lose themselves in the
quest for athletic domination and
dorm pride, they find themselves un
able to take certain referees' final
calls.

"I've definitely seen people yelling
at them," Mendoza said. "In intramu
ral, you know that the people are just
another student; there's not that feel
ing that the ref is untouchable."

"It's a tough job," Mendoza con
ceded. "On the one hand, anyone can
sign up for it and it's like there's no
training at all. I'm pretty sure some
refs last year weren't even sure of all
the rules. [On the other hand,] you
can't please everybody. I've seen
some competitive teams that really
get down on the refs."
On the intramural supervisors'
side, they see that refs need to assert
themselves and resist caving to older
players or students in a competitive
fervor. Supervisors also stand on
hand in every game to take control if
any conflicts get out of hand.
"It's a tough position to be offici
ating your own peers," said senior su
pervisor Mark Bentrott, who also
refereed. "The first couple games
you can be intimidated ... You have
to be a confident person, you can't be
passive."

This year, the intramural system
also introduced a system of officials
helping out new referees in their first
games, in order to supplement their
previously PowerPoint-focused edu
cation.

Popular intramural sports such as
Wallyball get along without referees,
basing fouls and scorekeeping on the
honor system. Stanford students nor
mally act with integrity and that car
ries over to the court, field, or swim
ming pool things can, however, fall
apart.

"The game ended with a tie three
to three, but the other team's captain
insisted the score was three to two. He
wouldn't budge," said a student who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The student's team ended up giving
the other team the victory.

Students in charge of other stu
dents might always lead to conflict,
but a system without any leadership
hierarchy might lead to anarchy. On
the other hand, though the IM super
visors consider refereeing just like
any other campus job, the truth is that
any job does require qualifications
and relevant experience. Handing the
whistle to students who have never
held a ball before could be asking for
trouble.

The referees seem to have little
sympathy for complaining players,
though.
"The referees here are as good as
how you play," Alvarez said. "When
you go pro, we'll go pro."
Fighting words. When students
step it up on both sides of the black
and white striped shirt, intramural
sports will surely improve.

The answer, it turns out, is only if those who
judge are qualified.
These qualifications have been a contentious
issue in Stanford intramural sports for years.
Most people enjoy their intramurals, reminis
cent, perhaps, of a more innocent high school
time and Stanford's Web site boasts over 9,000
participants in 37 intramural sports. Stanford in
tramurals seem characterized by an unfortunate
mixture of students that might not have their
priorities rightly sport-oriented colliding with
students whose priorities fall too far toward
sports-orientation, all presided over by referees
that might count only one PowerPoint presenta

tion as their sporting experience.
Since intramurals accept everyone, the
league fills with people who played three years
ago in high school and want to relive the glory,
people whose friends promised them free pizza
if they'd join so they'd have enough people for a
team, as well as those who view intramurals as
one step down from the Olympics in prestige
and importance. In a league where team names
range from "Baby Seal Clubbers" to "Apathetic
Mountain Lions," you know some competition
levels might fall out of sync.
This mismatch can lead to some grueling
struggles out on the field. Though many of the
intramural games lead to exciting play and close
scores, some can seem like massacres to fresh
men surprised by the competition.
"When I was doing football [as a freshman],"
said sophomore Joshua Alvarez, "the most in
timidating group was the Graduate School of

Business. All of their
team last year was ex-mili
tary football players."
In Stanford's academic
environment, some students
view athletics/going i
outside/showering and I
breathing as falling secondary 1
when midterm season picks up, I
while others channel their !
stress into flag football rages.
Unfortunately for the latter,
careless or overworked teams
miss the kickoff fairly frequently.

of three or four games the other team
didn't even show up," said sophomore
Nick Mendoza, who led the Junipero
intramural flag football team last
year. "Then you get these teams that
are so, so into intramural sports.
There's a big differentiation. People
are either not into it at all, or they take
it as life or death."

For the students caught in the mid
dle, things can get hot and heavy in all
the wrong ways. Intramural referee
ing is a student job with a relatively
high salary and no sports qualifica
tions needed. New referees attend a
single training session before the sea
son starts and learn the rules from a
slide show.
"The PowerPoint is about 45 slides
and we go through it in about 10 min
utes," said sophomore intramural su
pervisor Josh Alvarez. "It's a lot of in
formation, it is difficult to retain. But
for most of the games you don't need
to know 75 percent."
Perhaps caused by that elusive 75
percent, conflicts between players
and referees seem not uncommon. As
some players lose themselves in the
quest for athletic domination and
dorm pride, they find themselves un
able to take certain referees' final
calls.

"I've definitely seen people yelling
at them," Mendoza said. "In intramu
ral, you know that the people are just
another student; there's not that feel
ing that the ref is untouchable."

"It's a tough job," Mendoza con
ceded. "On the one hand, anyone can
sign up for it and it's like there's no
training at all. I'm pretty sure some
refs last year weren't even sure of all
the rules. [On the other hand,] you
can't please everybody. I've seen
some competitive teams that really
get down on the refs."
On the intramural supervisors'
side, they see that refs need to assert
themselves and resist caving to older
players or students in a competitive
fervor. Supervisors also stand on
hand in every game to take control if
any conflicts get out of hand.
"It's a tough position to be offici
ating your own peers," said senior su
pervisor Mark Bentrott, who also
refereed. "The first couple games
you can be intimidated ... You have
to be a confident person, you can't be
passive."

This year, the intramural system
also introduced a system of officials
helping out new referees in their first
games, in order to supplement their
previously PowerPoint-focused edu
cation.

Popular intramural sports such as
Wallyball get along without referees,
basing fouls and scorekeeping on the
honor system. Stanford students nor
mally act with integrity and that car
ries over to the court, field, or swim
ming pool things can, however, fall
apart.

"The game ended with a tie three
to three, but the other team's captain
insisted the score was three to two. He
wouldn't budge," said a student who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The student's team ended up giving
the other team the victory.

Students in charge of other stu
dents might always lead to conflict,
but a system without any leadership
hierarchy might lead to anarchy. On
the other hand, though the IM super
visors consider refereeing just like
any other campus job, the truth is that
any job does require qualifications
and relevant experience. Handing the
whistle to students who have never
held a ball before could be asking for
trouble.

The referees seem to have little
sympathy for complaining players,
though.
"The referees here are as good as
how you play," Alvarez said. "When
you go pro, we'll go pro."
Fighting words. When students
step it up on both sides of the black
and white striped shirt, intramural
sports will surely improve.
