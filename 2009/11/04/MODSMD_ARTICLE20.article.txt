# IM REFEREES UNVEILED

In a school with students as competitive as
Stanford's, could pitting two groups of stu
dents against each other in battle, while el
evating other students to decide winners
and losers and who gains the epic final
prize of free t-shirts, ever be a good idea?
The answer, it turns out, is only if those who
judge are qualified.
These qualifications have been a contentious
issue in Stanford intramural sports for years.
Most people enjoy their intramurals, reminis
cent, perhaps, of a more innocent high school
time and Stanford's Web site boasts over 9,000
participants in 37 intramural sports. Stanford in
tramurals seem characterized by an unfortunate
mixture of students that might not have their
priorities rightly sport-oriented colliding with
students whose priorities fall too far toward
sports-orientation, all presided over by referees
that might count only one PowerPoint presenta

tion as their sporting experience.
Since intramurals accept everyone, the
league fills with people who played three years
ago in high school and want to relive the glory,
people whose friends promised them free pizza
if they'd join so they'd have enough people for a
team, as well as those who view intramurals as
one step down from the Olympics in prestige
and importance. In a league where team names
range from "Baby Seal Clubbers" to "Apathetic
Mountain Lions," you know some competition
levels might fall out of sync.
This mismatch can lead to some grueling
struggles out on the field. Though many of the
intramural games lead to exciting play and close
scores, some can seem like massacres to fresh
men surprised by the competition.
"When I was doing football [as a freshman],"
said sophomore Joshua Alvarez, "the most in
timidating group was the Graduate School of

Business. All of their
team last year was ex-mili
tary football players."
In Stanford's academic
environment, some students
view athletics/going i
outside/showering and I
breathing as falling secondary 1
when midterm season picks up, I
while others channel their !
stress into flag football rages.
Unfortunately for the latter,
careless or overworked teams
miss the kickoff fairly frequently.
"In general, in every one oul

"In [lMs], you know
that [the ref is] just
another student;

there's not

that feeling that the ref
is untouchable."
