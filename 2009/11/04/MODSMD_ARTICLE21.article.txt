# NCAA needs justice

Someone needs to give Urban
Meyer a vocabulary lesson.
After Florida stud linebacker
Brandon Spikes blatantly and
viciously eye-gouged Georgia run
ning back Washuan Ealey last week,
head coach Meyer announced Spikes
would be suspended for the first half
of this week's game against Vander
bilt.

Suspended for a half. Sounds like a
benching to me, but maybe I'm just
not use to SEC lexicon.

Eye-gouging is one of the dirtiest
plays in football and can potentially
blind someone. Florida is the No. 1
team in the nation and is led by Jesus
super fan Tim Tebow, who has served
as a role model for both high school
and professional players on how to
play the game the right way. Tebow
wants his team to play with honor, pas
sion and respect for the opponent.
Eye-gouging contradicts all of it.
It just so happens that Vanderbilt
sits in the cellar of the SEC with a 0-5
conference record, making the sus
pension a moot point. Las Vegas has
Florida as a 35-point favorite; the
game will not be close.

Why would Meyer not make a
statement to the college football na
tion and actually suspend Spikes for a
whole game?

Think back to the Brawl in Boise
in the first week of the season. Boise
State defensive lineman Byron Hout
sought out Oregon running back
LeGarrette Blount after the Broncos
embarrassed the Ducks 19-8. Long
story short, Blount responded to
Hout's taunting with a punch that sent
Hout down to the ground faster than
Blount's NFL Draft status.
After the scuffle ended and Hout
scraped his shattered ego off the blue
turf, the sanctions came down. Ore
gon head coach Chip Kelly suspended
Blount for the entire season, though
there is talk he may be reinstated in
time for the Ducks' game against
Stanford this Saturday (just what we
need). Apparently Boise State head
coach Chris Petersen thought getting
embarrassed on national television
was enough of a punishment for
Hout, only giving him a stern slap-on
the-wrist.

By making a strong and swift ac
tion, Kelly rescued his program from
what could have been an irreparable
damaging moment and transformed
it into a legitimate Rose Bowl and na
tional title contender.

Meyer missed a chance to show
what his program represents, deciding
that trying to cover the spread against
Vanderbilt was more important.
Here at Stanford, where 15 consec
utive Directors' Cups reside, the ath
letic department does not let winning
detract from the integrity of the Uni
versity.

Look no further than men's bas
ketball. After graduating four starters,
the Cardinal only had eight recruited
scholarship players on its roster. Ex
pectations for the program were at a
new low.
Then came the news that sopho
more Jeremy Green, one of the play
ers head coach Johnny Dawkins was
depending on to fill the scoring void,
was arrested on suspicion of felony
domestic abuse.
He has not been charged and his
mother firmly believes that Green
will be playing again this year. There's
a chance the whole situation blows
over.
That hope didn't stop Dawkins
from suspending Green indefinitely
for an undisclosed violation of team
rules. Dawkins could have waited for
formal charges before suspending his
second-best player.
No, Dawkins went Roger Goodell
on Green and prematurely suspend
ed him. Dawkins took charge and told
everybody watching that Stanford
does not stand for illegal or immoral
actions.
It was not the easy decision to
make, but it was the right one.
Student-athletes do not deserve
special attention. Too often through
out collegiate sports do student-ath
letes get treated as athletes first and
students second (see Florida State's
cheating scandal or any John Cali
pari-coached team).
Maybe there's a reason profes
sional athletes seem to act like they're
above the law (I'm looking at your
gunshot wound, Plaxico). It's because
they're treated as such in college.
Every university has the same
mission: prepare students to enter
the professional world as responsible
adults. They do it well for non-ath
letes. Why not for the athletes?
They're students too.
