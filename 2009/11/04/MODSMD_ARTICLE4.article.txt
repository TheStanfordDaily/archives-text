# Ph.D. works go digital
## Registrar, libraries join forces for e-dissertation project; live Nov. 9

When Jacqueline Marie
Benjamin finished writing her dis
sertation in cancer biology earlier
this year, she still had to clear one
last hurdle.
She had to print the darn thing.
"It's a pain to print it all out,"
Benjamin said of the 120-page cap
stone to her Ph.D., submitted on
Sept. 17. "It took a good half a day."
For Benjamin and many other
graduate students writing disserta
tions, producing the requisite print
version was a costly, long and prob
lematic process, involving hours of
formatting and hundreds of dollars
in fees.
But all that may change Nov. 9.
That's when staff from the regis
trar's office and University libraries
are set to roll out a pilot electronic
dissertation option that, students
say, could ease their hassle and,
more importantly, change the nature
of their work.
"The pilot is indeed going
ahead," wrote library staff members
Mimi Calter, Hannah Frost and
Assistant Registrar Reid Kallman in
an e-mail to The Daily. They credit
ed University Librarian Mike Keller
and Registrar Thomas Black with
pushing the effort forward.
Speaking to the Faculty Senate
earlier this month, Black said, "The
way I look at [dissertations], there's
got to be a better way."
For Benjamin and current doc
toral students, that program could
signify a big step toward easing the
dissertations process.
"Dissertations end up being too
costly," Benjamin said. "Electronic

dissertations can be cost-efficient
and it would save paper."
"Some of the more common
comments from students are in
regards to .. . the administrative
hassle of making copies and sched
uling appointments," added
Assistant University Librarian Mimi
Calter.
Current students went further,
saying that their contributions to
their fields will be magnified under
the new system.
"We already have a huge but still
expanding body of knowledge in
terms of dissertations," said third
year graduate student Addy Satija,
who studies electrical engineering
and energy resources. "The fact that
we can run a electronic search
through all of it means that we can
expand more on this body of knowl
edge. We can run an electronic
search through all the research that
others have done before us. It's rev
olutionary."
Maria Lynn Spletter, Ph.D. 'O9 in
biology, agreed.
"It can improve the quality,
breadth and depth of the thesis,"
Spletter said.
And the ability to add multime
dia to dissertations is a game-chang
er, students indicated.
"Now you can have video on
your dissertation and this is an
amazing development," Satija said.
"It expands what a dissertation can
be."
Kristiaan De Greve, a fifth-year
Ph.D. student in electrical engineer
ing, said he believes other people
could peruse his work more easily in
electronic form.
"People only print it out [a dis
sertation] when they want to really
study it in depth," he said. "Many
people like to make notes on the
margins. But with electronic ver
sions, you can look at more informa
tion at a quicker pace."
Calter said doctoral students are
invited to attend open lab sessions
throughout the quarter to monitor
the new system, whose details are

set to go live on the registrar's Web
site Nov. 9.
"We'll continue to assess the pro
gram," Calter said.
Meanwhile, Spletter summed up
her reaction in a pointedly 21st-cen
tury way.
"I don't see the point of the
paper dissertation anymore," she
said. "Quite honestly, I read every
thing on my computer. I rely on
technology."

"In terms of dissertations...the fact that we can run an electronic search
through all of it means that we can expand more on this body of knowledge," said Addy Satija, a third-year graduate student in electrical engineer
ing and energy resources. "It's revolutionary."
