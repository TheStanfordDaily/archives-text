# Ph.D. works go digital
## Registrar, libraries join forces for e-dissertation project; live Nov. 9

When Jacqueline Marie
Benjamin finished writing her dis
sertation in cancer biology earlier
this year, she still had to clear one
last hurdle.
She had to print the darn thing.
"It's a pain to print it all out,"
Benjamin said of the 120-page cap
stone to her Ph.D., submitted on
Sept. 17. "It took a good half a day."
For Benjamin and many other
graduate students writing disserta
tions, producing the requisite print
version was a costly, long and prob
lematic process, involving hours of
formatting and hundreds of dollars
in fees.
But all that may change Nov. 9.
That's when staff from the regis
trar's office and University libraries
are set to roll out a pilot electronic
dissertation option that, students
say, could ease their hassle and,
more importantly, change the nature
of their work.
"The pilot is indeed going
ahead," wrote library staff members
Mimi Calter, Hannah Frost and
Assistant Registrar Reid Kallman in
an e-mail to The Daily. They credit
ed University Librarian Mike Keller
and Registrar Thomas Black with
pushing the effort forward.
Speaking to the Faculty Senate
earlier this month, Black said, "The
way I look at [dissertations], there's
got to be a better way."
For Benjamin and current doc
toral students, that program could
signify a big step toward easing the
dissertations process.
"Dissertations end up being too
costly," Benjamin said. "Electronic

dissertations can be cost-efficient
and it would save paper."
"Some of the more common
comments from students are in
regards to .. . the administrative
hassle of making copies and sched
uling appointments," added
Assistant University Librarian Mimi
Calter.
Current students went further,
saying that their contributions to
their fields will be magnified under
the new system.
"We already have a huge but still
expanding body of knowledge in
terms of dissertations," said third
year graduate student Addy Satija,
who studies electrical engineering
and energy resources. "The fact that
we can run a electronic search
through all of it means that we can
expand more on this body of knowl
edge. We can run an electronic
search through all the research that
others have done before us. It's rev
olutionary."
Maria Lynn Spletter, Ph.D. 'O9 in
biology, agreed.
"It can improve the quality,
breadth and depth of the thesis,"
Spletter said.
And the ability to add multime
dia to dissertations is a game-chang
er, students indicated.
"Now you can have video on
your dissertation and this is an
amazing development," Satija said.
"It expands what a dissertation can
be."
Kristiaan De Greve, a fifth-year
Ph.D. student in electrical engineer
ing, said he believes other people
could peruse his work more easily in
