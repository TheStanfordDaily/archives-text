## Univ. ranks second in sexual health Stanford drops one spot from last year in Trojan survey 
### RYAN MAYFIELD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford has been ranked second in the nation
on the Sexual Health Report Card commissioned
annually by Trojan Brand Condoms, losing last
year's top spot narrowly to the University of
South Carolina Gamecocks.
Ranking 141 American colleges, the study
looked at 14 measures of campus sexual health,
including contraceptive availability, testing costs
and sexual assault programs but students' trust
in their campus health centers was the pivotal fac
tor in the end, researchers said.
In an interview with the PR Newswire, Bert
Sperling, whose consulting company, Sperling's
Best Places, conducted the study, said that "centers
that had higher levels of trust in student polls ...
[tended] to score much higher."
At Stanford, some in the student health com
munity are pleased with Stanford's service, but
acknowledge there is still more to be done.
The Peer Health Educator (PHE) program,
which aims to have someone in every residence
that can help students with health issues, is one
part of that effort.
"Having a staff member who's specially

trained in sexual health issues, I think, is really
great for residents, considering ... students who
come in with all different backgrounds around
sex," said Julia Feinberg '11, PFIE for East
Florence Moore Hall.
"It allows them to talk someone they're com
fortable with," Feinberg added. "I'm not only your
PHE. I'm also your friend."
Stanford's PHEs are exceptional in that
regard, said program coordinator Jarreau Bowen
â€¢07.
"Though many schools do have a similar pro
gram," Bowen said, "they do not often have a stu
dent-staff position that [brings] students with this
level of passion or the same commitment to edu
cating the student body at large."
Peer educators are also charged with expand
ing students' access to resources, often pointing
them toward the Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center (SHPRC) or HIV Peer Anonymous
Counseling and Testing at Vaden Health Center.
SHPRC, which was founded by students and
continues to be student-run, credits every student
$2 per quarter and attempts to charge minimally
beyond that. University subsidies also mean that
no individual item costs more than $10.

Nonetheless, according to ASSU
health and wellness chair Alisha
Tolani TO, there are further steps to
be taken to improve the Stanford
sexual health landscape.

"We want to increase awareness
about sexual health, period," Tolani
said. "In an ideal world we would
want all students to have access to
contraception at fairly cheap rates,
we want them to be on contracep
tion if they are sexually active,
[know] where to get it and what to
do if contraception fails."
But for now, Feinberg, the
FloMo PHE, highlighted Stanford's
strengths.
"Across the board, I see how
we're strong in every category," she
said. "When they say HIV testing,
outreach, low cost of contracep
tives, low cost of condoms... we
have all of those and we do all of
them very, very well and take them
extremely seriously."
"A lot of it is run by student
groups exclusively," she added. "I
think we have a lot to be proud of."
