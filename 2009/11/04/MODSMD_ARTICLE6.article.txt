# ELECTION '09
## GOP wins New Jersey, Virginia Bloomberg, Garamendi lead; gay marriage splits 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
The 2009 elections were, by and
large, business as usual, with a couple
of surprises. Favored candidates Chris
Christie, Bob McDonnell and John
Garamendi did not squander their
leads in their respective races. Michael
Bloomberg survived a scare in New
York City. Two gay marriage ballot
measures went in separate directions
on opposite sides of the country, and in
New York's 23rd congressional district,
Democrat Bill Owens pulled off the
biggest upset of the night to win a tra
ditional Republican stronghold.
New York's 23rd Congressional District
Democrat Bill Owens won a sur
prising victory over the Conservative
Party's Doug Hoffman in the New
York 23rd, pulling in 49 percent of the
vote to Hoffman's 46 percent. Hoffman
conceded Tuesday night.
It was perhaps the most interesting
race of the cycle. Republican nominee
Dede Scozzafava dropped out of the
race over the weekend after national
conservative leaders deemed her too
liberal, which led to plummeting funds
and poll numbers. That left Hoffman, a
darling of the right wing, to face off
against the moderate Owens in a dis

trict Democrats have not won since
1990.
Owens will take over the seat vacat
ed by John McHugh, who is currently
serving as President Obama's
Secretary of the Army.
The latest polling showed Hoffman
with a five-point lead over Owens, but
that never materialized, as the
Democratic candidate led from the
start. The strong red counties in the dis
trict did not come out in force, while
their blue counterparts showed up
strong. Jefferson County, whose fate
was seen as an indicator for the rest of
the district, went for Owens.
Owens had received the last
minute support of the AFL-CIO and

other powerful unions, whose get-out
the-vote efforts are essential on elec
tion days, as well as Scozzafava her
self. Indeed, polling showed that her
supporters carried far more resent
ment toward Hoffman than toward
Owens. While conventional thinking
would assume that Scozzafava's sus
pension of her candidacy would bene
fit Hoffman, it appears to have aided
Owens.
It appears that the GOP went from
what would have likely been a sure vic
tory with Scozzafava, who seemed to
specialize in crossover appeal, to a split
voter base once Hoffman's campaign
