# ELECTION '09
## GOP wins New Jersey, Virginia Bloomberg, Garamendi lead; gay marriage splits 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
The 2009 elections were, by and
large, business as usual, with a couple
of surprises. Favored candidates Chris
Christie, Bob McDonnell and John
Garamendi did not squander their
leads in their respective races. Michael
Bloomberg survived a scare in New
York City. Two gay marriage ballot
measures went in separate directions
on opposite sides of the country, and in
New York's 23rd congressional district,
Democrat Bill Owens pulled off the
biggest upset of the night to win a tra
ditional Republican stronghold.
New York's 23rd Congressional District
Democrat Bill Owens won a sur
prising victory over the Conservative
Party's Doug Hoffman in the New
York 23rd, pulling in 49 percent of the
vote to Hoffman's 46 percent. Hoffman
conceded Tuesday night.
It was perhaps the most interesting
race of the cycle. Republican nominee
Dede Scozzafava dropped out of the
race over the weekend after national
conservative leaders deemed her too
liberal, which led to plummeting funds
and poll numbers. That left Hoffman, a
darling of the right wing, to face off
against the moderate Owens in a dis

trict Democrats have not won since
1990.
Owens will take over the seat vacat
ed by John McHugh, who is currently
serving as President Obama's
Secretary of the Army.
The latest polling showed Hoffman
with a five-point lead over Owens, but
that never materialized, as the
Democratic candidate led from the
start. The strong red counties in the dis
trict did not come out in force, while
their blue counterparts showed up
strong. Jefferson County, whose fate
was seen as an indicator for the rest of
the district, went for Owens.
Owens had received the last
minute support of the AFL-CIO and

other powerful unions, whose get-out
the-vote efforts are essential on elec
tion days, as well as Scozzafava her
self. Indeed, polling showed that her
supporters carried far more resent
ment toward Hoffman than toward
Owens. While conventional thinking
would assume that Scozzafava's sus
pension of her candidacy would bene
fit Hoffman, it appears to have aided
Owens.
It appears that the GOP went from
what would have likely been a sure vic
tory with Scozzafava, who seemed to
specialize in crossover appeal, to a split
voter base once Hoffman's campaign
took off, leading to ultimate defeat,

New Jersey Governor
Republicans racked up a win in
the horserace for the New Jersey
governor's mansion, where
Republican Chris Christie clinched
49 percent of the vote over incum
bent Democrat Jon Corzine, who
nabbed 45 percent with three-quar
ters of the ballots counted.
Republicans had not secured a
statewide office in the Garden State
in nearly a decade,
Corzine conceded right before
11 p.m. EST in a speech in East
Brunswick, saying he had phoned
Christie to congratulate him.
"Mr. Christie was gracious in his
response, and we will work hard
together to make sure the transition
is smooth," Corzine told supporters.
"It has been an incredible, incredi
ble journey together, and I am
grateful to all New Jerseyans."
The hard-fought New Jersey
face-off had all the political fanfare
of a major campaign, with slews of
negative ads, multi-million dollar ad
buys and national party implica
tions. National attention aside, how
ever, this was an election about
local issues. Despite Corzine's
immense personal war chest the
former Wall Street executive tun
neled $23 million of his personal
wealth into attack ads on Christie
and time spent with President
Obama, Corzine could not over
come his bottom-barrel approval
ratings and the specter of political
corruption in the state to earn a sec
ond term.

Despite being outspent 3-1,
Christie's campaign message

which capitalized on voter concerns
about unemployment, Corzine's
tanking approval ratings, budget
slashes and spiking property taxes
carried more weight with New
Jersey voters.
The White House had wagered
some political capital on New
Jersey's governorship, deeming it
the most likely win in an off-year
election that was trending
Republican and expended signifi
cant effort in propping up Corzine.
Obama hit the campaign trail hard
for Corzine, stumping stateside with
the governor on three different
occasions this past week to fire up
voters who helped the president
carry the state by 15 percentage
points last November.

Former U.S. Attorney Christie's
message framed as a referendum
on Corzine resonated with inde
pendents, with exit polls showing
that 58 percent of independents
sided with Christie compared to the
31 percent who pulled for Corzine.
Those numbers disappointed some
Democrats, who had pinned their
hopes on Republican voters break
ing rank with Christie and siding
with independent Chris Daggett.
However, Daggett's less than stellar
showing a mere five percent of
the vote made him little more
than a footnote and did nothing to
help Democrats bleed away
Republican votes.

Virginia Governor
In Virginia, Republican Bob
McDonnell won the governor's
seat over Democrat Creigh Deeds,
ousting the Democrats from their
eight-year hold on the office.
McDonnell, who heavily outspent
Deeds, scored big with independ
ent voters with promises to spur
job growth in the state's stagnant
economy and deal with Virginia's
congested roadways without
raising taxes. Deeds' campaign was
lackluster at best, gaining minimal
traction with voters.
McDonnell's win also aligns with
history since 1977, no party that
captured the White House has pro
ceeded to win the Virginia governor
seat the next year.
New York City Mayor
The Empire State could not con
tain its intrigue to one district on
Tuesday New York City was
affected, too.
Incumbent independent mayor
Michael Bloomberg was expected
to win reelection easily over his
opponent, Democratic comptroller
Bill Thompson. Bloomberg invested
nearly $lOO million in the race and
had the widespread media adver
tisements to show for it. Thompson,
by contrast, was deemed the "stealth
candidate" because of his subdued
and often invisible campaign.
But on Tuesday, after jumping
out to an early lead that prompted
NBC to call the race, Bloomberg
began to sweat. After numbers came
in from the outer boroughs showing
the race tighter than it originally
seemed, NBC retracted its predic
tion and the election was deemed
too close to call. Still, Bloomberg
retained his lead, ultimately winning
by less than five points.
Maine Question 1
The gay rights movement was
struck a major blow on Tuesday,

when voters in Maine repealed a
law allowing same-sex marriage
through approval of a ballot initia
tive called Question 1.

Gay-marriage opponents com
prised 53 percent of the votes, with
87 percent of the precincts report
ing.

Maine's legislature legalized
same-sex marriage last spring, but
conservatives resurrected the issue
by launching a petition to repeal the
law by putting it on the ballot.

This was the first time American
voters overturned a gay-marriage
law passed by the legislature.
Proposition 8 in California rejected
a court ruling, not a piece of state
legislation.
With the defeat in Maine, pushes
for same-sex marriage have now
failed in all 31 states in which is has
been put to a popular vote.

Washington Referendum Measure 71
Washington State voted
Tuesday to reaffirm an earlier bill
passed in the state legislature to
give homosexual domestic partner
ships the full rights and benefits
afforded to heterosexual couples.
These civil unions, however, will
not be considered a "marriage."
That said, for all legal purposes in
the state, gay partnerships will be
equivalent to their straight coun
terparts.
The referendum was passed
with just under 52 percent of the
vote. It appeared on the ballot
after anti-gay marriage groups
gathered the requisite signatures
needed; however, polling showed
that an ultimate rejection of the
legislature's bill was unlikely.
California's 10th Congressional
District
In a less exciting race than New
York's 23rd, Democrat John
Garamendi, the state's lieutenant
governor, beat Republican David
Harmer by a wide margin in an elec
tion that was never considered to be
particularly close.
Although the district is reliably
Democratic, Garamendi is consid
ered more liberal than his predeces
sor, Ellen Tauscher, who left
Congress to become the Under
Secretary of State for Arms Control
and International Security Affairs.
Speaker of the House Nancy
Pelosi encouraged Garamendi to fly
to Washington, D.C. immediately to
be sworn in.
