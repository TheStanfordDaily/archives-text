the weathered walkways hold an air of great
mystery. What really goes on atop the corridors
connecting Alondra, Cardenal, Faisan, Gavilan,
Foro, Mirlo and Paloma?
To the outsider's eye, the catwalks are a peace
ful scene. Rooftop pebbles radiated the warmth of
the late afternoon October sun as one resident paced
around the path's perimeter, engrossed in a cell phone
conversation. Hockey pads and jerseys were strewn out
side Alondra. Cardenal's rope hammock stood perched
and a few cigarette butts mostly around Mirlo spot
ted the otherwise clean rooftop. The SEE dorms showed the
most signs of activity, with pumpkin pie, candy and frosting
left over from Halloween.
The Faisan Residential Writing Tutor (RWT), a jovial fellow
named Aaron Kalb 'll, finds that the catwalks are pleasant places
to "pace around thinking about life without looking too crazy."

"People also come up
hei eto make out, but occa- .
sioially someone will walk
by,'' he added.

"A few friends of mine picked up
a water balloon launcher, but instead %.
of sending water balloons out at peo-
pie, they used slightly rotten fruit," |
Rice recounted of his freshman year T jj
with a glint of mischief in his eyes. m y
His face lights up as he describes one of %
his fellow mischief-makers\ a world-class
pitcher who did not require the use of said
launcher.
"The guy could hit anywhere within a hun- M
dred feet dead on with a rotten lemon," Rice Til
laughed.
However, with FloMo's recent shift away from
all-freshman dorms, Rice feels that the catwalks \
aren't what they used to be.
"If you're downstairs, you may hear someone run
ning across 'em," reported Rice. "But no one's smok
ing pot anymore."
Yet contrary to Rice's observations, nighttimes on
the catwalks are still places of revelry for those in
Flo Mo. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous
in fear of consequences, referred to the catwalks "as good
places to do things you shouldn't be doing."
"During the daytime, it's nice to take a nap or read up
here," he said. "But on the first night of school we all passed
around a hookah."
