(FOUNDER, THE GARDEN PROJECT)
Working with the land has been a healing activity for many. The
Garden Project, which is an intensive program for former offenders
and at risk youth, takes this idea and runs with it by teaching students
a wide array of horticulture skills. Started in 1992, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has called The Garden Project "one of the
most innovative and successful community-based crime prevention
programs in the country."
