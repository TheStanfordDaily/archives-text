## GSC reexamines budget to prevent future problems Council considers special fees reform and tightening of VSO finding rules 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
The graduate students' reserves are dropping
fast maybe too fast.

That was the message last night from
Graduate Student Council Financial Officer
Ryan Peacock, who told the council that if it con
tinues to transfer $50,000 a year from its reserves
like it did last year, big budget problems could be
on the doorstep by 2012.

In his budget update to the council, Peacock,
a fourth-year graduate student, reviewed the
GSC's expenses and sources of income. He
stopped short of any formal actions on the
reserve issue, but did suggest that the group
schedule a targeted reduction in reserves spend
ing until 2016.

Co-Chair Eric Osborne, a third-year law stu
dent, asked at one point whether the council
should "try to convince" graduate students to raise
their activity fee, which is now $35 per quarter.
Amid murmurs of disapproval, Peacock
responded that "even if you want to do that, I
think you need to start phasing back like this."
Despite seeming unwilling to raise student
fees, the council did not reach a consensus on
how they would curb spending. Special fees
reform and stricter funding rules for volunteer
student organizations (VSOs) remain on the
table, also suggested during talks this week on
the Undergraduate Senate side.

The Peacock Talk
The financial officer tried to give council mem-

bers an up-to-date overview of the GSC budget.
Income comes from three sources, he
explained. The ASSU endowment, which pays
out about $46,000 annually, funds the GSC polit
ical budget and suffered in the economic down
turn last year, but "we were much less aggressive
ly invested" than the University, Peacock said.
Student fees, called "general fees" once in the
coffers, are collected by the University to the tune
of some $237,000 and go to the funding commit
tee, special fees groups and GSC programming.
Graduate students pay $35 a quarter and under
graduates pay about $l2O a quarter, said ASSU
Vice President Jay de la Torre.
All students can request refunds, and do so
much more for special fees VSOs than for gener
al fees, Peacock said.

Then there are the reserves, which lie at
$481,000 and are projected to drop $50,000 this
year.

Expenses are distributed widely, Peacock
explained.

The GSC political budget, funded by the
$46,000 endowment payout, covers $16,000 in
officer stipends, $19,000 in operational expenses
like meeting food and $lO,OOO for a discretionary
advocacy fund. About $9,500 has been allocated
for meeting food so far this year.
In programming. Winter Formal is one of the
largest expenses, with $23,000 allocated, while the
discretionary fund has been allocated for town
halls and other events.

Student Group Funding
The funding committee chair gave an overview
similar to Peacock's, giving some indication of the
tightening restrictions student groups may face
when asking the GSC for money.
Ping Li, a third-year business student, said the
committee is attempting to focus the GSC's finan

rial resources on "core programs."
Among the criteria for funding, she said, will be
whether attendees to events are 35 percent gradu
ate students and whether there are three distinct
VSOs co-sponsoring "big events."
Li also said the committee likely will not fund
student groups for gas expenses, encouraging
them to keep their events on campus.

Special Fees Reform
Peacock said he met recently with
Undergraduate Senators Alex Katz 'l2 and Anton
Zietsman 'l2 to discuss an "out of control" special
fees process.

"The undergraduates are really concerned
because they don't vote down any special fees
groups, so they're all spending $l2O a quarter, and
it's getting out of control," Peacock said. "If we're
going to do reform," he said, there are several
options, including raising the required number of
petition signatures or changing the percent vote
needed to pass special fees.

"Getting away for ASSU to manage reim
bursement requests" is another option, Peacock
said.

Graduate student and former GSC parliamentari
an Adam Beberg cautioned against changing the
elections process, however.

"Tinkering with the rules is a very dangerous
thing," Beberg said. "It sounds like the problem
with the undergraduates is they all vote yes on
everything on the ballot. They have a voter educa
tion problem."

Before adjourning, the council approved
upping this week's Grad Night budget from $3OO
to $350.

The next council meeting is Wednesday at 6
p.m. at the Graduate Community Center.
