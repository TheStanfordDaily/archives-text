## EDITORIAL Individual actions vital to campus sustainability 
### 
The classrooms and dorms of Stanford
are filled with a lot of big ideas about
cleaning and greening our planet. Stu
dents will spend hours in lectures hearing
about the next big clean energy, world ener
gy resources and the chemistry of pollution.
Students will spend hours tirelessly studying
for midterms, writing papers and discussing
global warming and its effects. Some stu
dents, however, seem to balk at using their
hands and feet to remember to unplug a
power strip.

next to the recycle bin or the light switch that
is perpetually on. Perhaps it is because these
steps seem too simple to work that we push
them aside, instead focusing on the big, com
plex technologies and social policies that
promise big rewards.

But if we were to look at the recent suc
cess of President Obama in the 2008 elec
tion, grassroots is anything but a small idea.

to create a cry for change. The reward was
big and the efforts were small, an idea that
easily translates into the small steps stu
dents can take to make Stanford more sus
tainable and decrease each and every car
bon footprint he or she leaves behind.
Student groups like Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford, the Green Living Council
and SPOON are sadly more of a back
ground noise in our campus conversation.
Once they get too loud, we tune out, espe
cially when it means giving up the steak for
dinner. But if we were to stop and listen, we
might realize that it is less noise and more a
call to action. It is not a sacrifice of great
price, but rather a small sacrifice of time or
palate in our privileged lives as Stanford
students.

For many students, it is hard to see the
greater benefits of skipping the steak and
going for the chicken. It is easy to belittle the
simple things one can do in order to reduce
our university's and even our own car
bon footprint. We are a population of big

the world. But more often than not, we ig

With privilege comes responsibility, but
not just a responsibility to enlarging the aca

ment. Our responsibility begins in our own
actions as individuals actions that can ei
ther help or hinder the progress we hope our
big ideas will create.
