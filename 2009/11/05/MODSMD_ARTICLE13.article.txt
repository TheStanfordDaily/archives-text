# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## One Historical Fiction, On the Rocks 
### Emily Hulme 
Like most people, I was clearly born in
the wrong century. I don't mean to
blame God on this one but, really,
10/10/89 was just a little ... off. I think I first
realized this when, presumably inspired by
one of those parenting books, dear old mom
and dad decided to have some "family bond
ing" time which included dragging their
angsty 13-year-old daughter to the wilder
ness, as defined by lacking the high school so
cial triptych: cell phone service, MySpace and
AIM. In retrospect, I've realized this wasn't
actually a punitive measure, but an attempt
to harness the artistic skills of their youngster
who first manifested her talent with a pen
chant for coloring outside the lines.
While this early display may or may not
have been chiefly due to the early onset of
the family myopia, this trip was a surefire way
to challenge my abilities to conjure up new
and better ways to complain about how un
fair my forced vacation was where I would
eat better food than 95 percent of the world
(I mean, we were still in California) and go
waterskiing with people who genuinely
cared about me, and I quickly upgraded my
snide remarks from "I hate you" to more nu
anced and specific invectives. In between
sulking and playing pool, I went through all
the places I'd rather be in my diary. Since this
was before the invention of the Moleskine, it
was in one of those one's they advertised on
Nickelodeon that had the "lock" shaped like
a heart with the plastic key.
I'm not alone in my habitual daydream
ing. Some friends of mine wish they were
born in Ancient Egypt. As alluring as the Nile
sounds, I'm frankly pretty intimidated at the
idea of meeting Cleopatra, the original She-
Wolf. Although I couldn't find any sources
confirming that she partied in a glitter lair
like Shakira, she did manage to seduce Julius
Caesar and then Mark Antony. I actually
would have loved to be the Perez Hilton of
the day, reporting on dinner parties with
guests asking Cleo and Mark how they met
"Oh, you know, when I was hooking up
with Caesar in Rome, Mark came over one
day to deliver some tablets Cicero sent by,
and it was love at first sight and/or love
promptly after JC got stabbed and Mark
started skeezing on me like whoa." For bonus
points, history decided to go against Holly
wood, and she apparently wasn't especially
pretty. Although statistically-inclined
naysayers suggest I'd probably be a slave if I
were born in Egypt, I would have been a hero
when I wrote the Rosetta Stone in English
and featured what lines she was feeding these
guys rather than recording tax laws like the
real one does.

I also have some friends in biology and
physics who wish they could have lived 400

number of ways.

years ago and discovered gravity or genetics.
Given that I believe in neither of these since
I can't physically see them, I don't find this
proposition very exciting. Also, since I tend
to pepper my dialogue with lines from Sabri
na the Teenage Witch, I'm pretty sure I'd be
burned at the stake.

Other eras, too, have various attractions. I
can't help but imagine I might be very happy
mixing paint for Michelangelo or copy-edit
ing for Shakespeare. But my heart is not in
the Renaissance. I also don't think they'd in
vented the unpaid internship at that point,
which is really my long-term goal. If there is
one era I'm willing to thanklessly brew coffee
and make copies for, it's right around the
turn of the 20th century, just in time to meet
the most bad-ass president, Theodore Roo
sevelt. He may be the only man comfortable
enough with himself in the history of human
ity to head the "Bull Moose Party," and I
imagine he would play a mean game of
Scrabble, cook poorly and never read this
column. This is all to say I would probably be
high on the Secret Service's list of harmless
stalkers after I was caught rifling through the
trash to find his used gum.

There are a number of other characters
I'd like to meet, but that's not really the point
of this exercise. It's not that the past had any
people and questions more interesting than
today. We just already know the results, and
can see in brilliant Technicolor who and what
really mattered. Life is about fighting the im
minent collapse of tomorrow that could still
play out any number of ways. Dreaming ain't
living, and if we're all outcasts from our home
centuries, stranded on planet 2009, it's time
to make like the Swiss Family Robinson and
build a sick tree house.
