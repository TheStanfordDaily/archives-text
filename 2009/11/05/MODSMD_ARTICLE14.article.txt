# FLECHAS Y PEDRADAS
## Whipping it out in Spain

J- -i. columnist Molly Spaeth's open letter
to men inviting us not to be so disgusting. It oc
casioned me to think a bit about what I've
seen in this country, and why sometimes being
a guy is harder than it looks. I know Spaeth's
column is, at heart, a hyperbolic response to
the truly horrendous comportment of some
men with whom she's recently been in con
tact, but I want to affirm that men do in fact
have both brains and consciences. It's just that
we're told that if we use them too much, our
penises will fall off.
Macho the word comes from the Span
ish machismo, so it should come as no surprise
that it's alive and well here. After Franco
gained power in the late 19305, the values es
poused by the conservative wing of the
Catholic Church became the law of the land.
He revoked all divorces, forbade women from
gaining employment without written permis
sion from their spouses and then, in 1975, he
died. During the transition to democracy, the
country shifted to the polar opposite of its past
conservatism, and the odd commingling of
hyper-liberal and hyper-conservative tenden
cies in Spanish society today is the result. It
means that while the country has legalized gay
marriage, it is also still common for women to
be harassed on the street.

In the summer before my freshman year, I
went to visit the family that had hosted me in
Spain the year before. They lived in Ciudad
Real, a town of some 70,000 in Castilla-La
Mancha, a province that barceloneses conde
scendingly refer to as Espana profundo, or,

"deep Spain." There, the piropos, "pick-up
lines," flew fast and furious, something I ex
pected in the campo. From there, I accompa
nied my host family to the beach town of
Benidorm for their summer vacation. The city
cemented my image of Spain, at least por la
costa, as the Florida of Europe: an entryway
for illegal immigrants seeking passage to the
continent, a haven for retirees in search of
warmer climes and a long string of beaches
that serve as a backdrop for the debauchery of
pasty foreign youths.
Walking one night with my host-mother
and -brother, we stopped to watch a gaggle of
Brits circling around a young man speaking
something that I think must have been Eng
lish. He was just too drunk to force his sylla
bles into word form. Seeing the throng, we
stopped and I craned my neck up to see over
the heads of those surrounding the lad. I was
just in time. There was a gasp and, lo and be
hold, his pants and underwear were puddled
around his ankles. He was intoning something
to the girls in front of him, but they were most
ly focused on laughing at his genitals.
After all, laughter was the easy response.
The kid cut such a buffoonish figure, how
could his limp member really be taken as any
kind of threat? It opens a larger question:
What do men ever hope to gain from making
sexual overtures to strangers?
And here's where it begins to get a little
more complicated for us menfolk. If one pays
a bit of attention, it quickly becomes clear that
Spaniards don't toss out piropos to actually
get anywhere. They'll yell them out in the
company of friends, or in front of their girl-

friends or wives. Why? A man whistling at a
woman on the street is not doing it to get her
into bed. The purpose is to show that they are
there, that they are virile it's the vestiges of
machismo that dictate that if you are a man,
you should make it known. It's just subtler
than dropping your pants and waggling your
dick around.

That's why we laugh it off. It's a collective
male effort in willful ignorance. But don't tell
me men can't understand that it's wrong. Do
men have brains? Check. Consciences?
Check, but as much as sex is about communi
cation and the expression of love, it is also
primitive and powerful enough to make
men and women alike lose upper level brain
function at the drop of a hat. To this day, I
haven't seen anything quite so funny as that
scrawny kid with no pants on weaving around
in front of a crowd of onlookers. I also have
never felt so drawn to physical violence as
when friends of mine have been groped.
So, ladies, don't write men off.There will al
ways be creeps, but remember that most of us
are trying. Who knows a little more hon
esty from both genders about the stupefying
powers of human sexuality, and maybe guys
the world over would stop whipping it out,
verbally or otherwise ...

Hasta entonces,
Patrick

Patrick Kozey knows he just spent 800 words
being hetero-normative, and apologizes for it.
