Re: "Back off My Beef," Nov. 4,2009

Dear Editor:
I found a number of faults and omissions
in the arguments Erica Morgan presented in
yesterday's Daily opinion article "Get It
Right: Back off My Beef." This is the second
article that Morgan has written consisting en
tirely, it seems, of poorly-researched argu
ments justifying her bad attitude toward sus
tainability efforts. I'm not sure why she insists
on doing this,but, as someone majoring in en
vironmental and sustainability matters, I
would like to point out some issues that she
overlooked.

Morgan's main argument is that the
"fads" of eating vegetarian and vegan don't
really have any effect on reducing a person's
environmental impact, and she is simply
wrong about this. I think we all know that. In
terms of greenhouse gas emissions alone, eat
ing beef is more significant than driving a
Hummer all your life. It's that simple.
But my main problem with the piece is
that the issues the author brings up show a

fundamental and complete lack of knowl
edge about how our modern agricultural
system works. I think this is the saddest part
because it means she doesn't even know the
origins of the substances she is putting in
her own body every day. The truth is that
most of the meat in the U.S. comes from
CAFOs Confined Animal Feeding Op
erations and not the open rangeland
that she romanticizes about, which, in the
case of beef production, means that thou
sands of cows are crammed together (their
waste is not re-used, as she would like to be
lieve, to create fertilizer it simply pol
lutes the surrounding air and water) and
forced to eat our nation's surplus of cheap
corn (itself the result of over-use of chemi
cal fertilizers that go on to pollute rivers
and seas, creating dead zones). Because
cows' stomachs are not designed to digest
corn, they are fed hormones, steroids and
antibiotics so they can survive until they are
slaughtered. Even the American Medical
Association is trying to ban CAFOs be
cause this reckless drug usage is creating
antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, but

the industrial agriculture lobby has over
powered them. So, really, people should be
eating less beef for their own health on mul
tiple levels.
The other issue that Morgan ignored com
pletely was that of water usage. As the author
should know, being a Stanford student, the
West is in its third consecutive year of
drought. The way we raise cows by feed
ing them crops that require irrigation and
that also give them permanent diarrhea, de
hydrating them and forcing them to drink ex
cessive amounts of water and the way we
slaughter them means that hundreds of gal
lons of water have gone into the production
of every pound of meat you eat.
Every single climate model predicts that
rainfall and snowpack in the West are going
to keep decreasing, so if we can't find away
to eat less meat or, I will gladly admit,
more sustainably produced meat than we
do now, then we're going to have bigger fish
to fry than Morgan's self-construed "right" to
eat meat.
