## MEN'S WATER POLO Stanford dismantles Davis Cardinal blows out Aggies in Wednesday night showdown

One down, two to go.
The No. 3 Stanford men's water polo team began its
three-game week with a 10-2 victory over No. 16 UC-
Davis Wednesday night at the Avery Aquatic Center.
"We missed a lot of opportunities, but we really
pushed off our counter-attack and played good de
fense against Davis," said sophomore Ryan Brown.
Sophomore Jacob Smith headed the Stanford team
with three goals. Senior Ryan McCarthy netted two,
and redshirt freshman Travis Noll, freshman Paul
Rudolph, sophomore Peter Sefton, junior Will Smith
and senior Drac Wigo each added one goal.
The Cardinal jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the
first period, and extended the lead to 5-2 at halftime.
Stanford blanked the Aggies in the second half, thanks
to goalie play by senior Jimmie Sandman and fresh
man Scott Platshon. Sandman only had to make five
saves, as the Cardinal defense did not allow many shots
to go through. Platshon took his place in the goal with
four minutes to go in the match, blocking one shot.
Platshon nearly added an embarrassing play in the
fourth period, when an errant outlet pass headed
straight to a Davis player. Luckily for Platshon, the
Aggie wasn't paying attention and the ball hit off his
head straight into the hands of McCarthy.
The victory marked the second time the Cardinal
has defeated the Aggies this season. In the NorCal In
vitational on Sept. 19, Stanford steamrollered UC-
Davis 16-3.

This weekend, Stanford faces two conference oppo
nents on the road. The Cardinal will travel to No. 8
Long Beach State on Saturday and No. 7 UC-Irvine on
Sunday. Stanford is undefeated in Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play, and hopes to return to The
Farm with the record unblemished.

"It's going to take a lot of focus in the first game, and
we're just going to have to come back with that same
intensity in the second game, which isn't easy to do,"
said redshirt freshman Tim Norton.
