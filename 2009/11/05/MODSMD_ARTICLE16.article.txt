## MEN'S WATER POLO Stanford dismantles Davis Cardinal blows out Aggies in Wednesday night showdown 
### MIKE LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
One down, two to go.
The No. 3 Stanford men's water polo team began its
three-game week with a 10-2 victory over No. 16 UC-
Davis Wednesday night at the Avery Aquatic Center.
"We missed a lot of opportunities, but we really
pushed off our counter-attack and played good de
fense against Davis," said sophomore Ryan Brown.
Sophomore Jacob Smith headed the Stanford team
with three goals. Senior Ryan McCarthy netted two,
and redshirt freshman Travis Noll, freshman Paul
Rudolph, sophomore Peter Sefton, junior Will Smith
and senior Drac Wigo each added one goal.
The Cardinal jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the
first period, and extended the lead to 5-2 at halftime.
Stanford blanked the Aggies in the second half, thanks
to goalie play by senior Jimmie Sandman and fresh
man Scott Platshon. Sandman only had to make five
saves, as the Cardinal defense did not allow many shots
to go through. Platshon took his place in the goal with
four minutes to go in the match, blocking one shot.
Platshon nearly added an embarrassing play in the
fourth period, when an errant outlet pass headed
straight to a Davis player. Luckily for Platshon, the
Aggie wasn't paying attention and the ball hit off his
head straight into the hands of McCarthy.
The victory marked the second time the Cardinal
has defeated the Aggies this season. In the NorCal In
vitational on Sept. 19, Stanford steamrollered UC-
Davis 16-3.

This weekend, Stanford faces two conference oppo
nents on the road. The Cardinal will travel to No. 8
Long Beach State on Saturday and No. 7 UC-Irvine on
Sunday. Stanford is undefeated in Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play, and hopes to return to The
Farm with the record unblemished.

"It's going to take a lot of focus in the first game, and
we're just going to have to come back with that same
intensity in the second game, which isn't easy to do,"
said redshirt freshman Tim Norton.

GAME NOTES: Sophomore driver Jacob Smith recorded a hat
trick for Stanford in Wednesday night's match. The win over
UC-Davis boosted the Cardinal's record to 17-1 on the sea
son. Long Beach State marks the first of three consecutive road
matches for Stanford in Southern California.

Long Beach is 8-9 on the season,
with key victories over UC-Santa
Barbara and UC-San Diego. The
49ers are coming off a 9-3 loss to
UCLA, a team Stanford has defeat
ed three times already this season.
Irvine should pose a similar chal
lenge to Long Beach. The Anteaters
have faced the 49ers three times,
winning twice 9-8 and losing once 8-
7. Most recently, Irvine defeated Pa
cific 6-4 on Nov. 1 to improve its
record to 14-7. On Halloween, Irvine
could not pull off the upset at Berke

ley, losing 13-10 to Cal. Cal, a difficult
opponent, also handed 17-1 Stanford
their sole loss of the season.

For Stanford, the key to the week
end will be defense.

"In order to win this weekend, we
got to play solid defense all through
out this weekend," Wigo said. "If
things don't go well, we're going to
have to rely on our defense,"

If Stanford can survive this week
end, it will look forward to a classic
showdown over the final two weeks
of the regular season against No. 1
USC and No. 2 Cal.

The Cardinal is scheduled to play
USC on Nov. 14 and Cal the follow
ing Saturday on Nov. 21. As Stan
ford's lone loss this year came
against Cal, and last year Stanford

lost to USC in the national champi
onship games, emotions will run high
throughout both the matches.
For now, the Cardinal is doing its
best to focus on this weekend's
games against Long Beach and
Irvine.

"We definitely [have] to focus on
these first two games because a loss
of this point of the season could be
detrimental to our chances of win
ning a national championship,"
Brown said. "We can't afford to look
ahead."

Both the Long Beach and Irvine
games are scheduled to begin at
noon.
