# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW
## LET THE JOURNEY BEGIN Appel, Cardinal set to take on the nation 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
t's time to get back to business.

After a dominant 2008-2009 season that came to a pre
mature end in last year's Final Four, the Cardinal women
are returning to the court with one goal in mind: a national
championship.
Considering what the team accomplished last year, an
NCAA title is just about the only thing left that could flesh
out the Cardinal's resume. Stanford (33-5, 17-1 Pac-10)
cruised to its second 30-win season in a row en route to a
ninth consecutive Pac-10 regular season title last year and
went on to dominate a Pac-10 tournament in which it
outscored its opponents 239-157. They went undefeated at
Maples Pavilion, never lost consecutive games and posted
the second-best scoring margin of any Division I team (20.3
avg.j.They led the conference in offense, accuracy, assists and
rebounding. They drew considerably more fans than any
other Pac-10 team as well, averaging over 4,200 per game.
They were, quite simply, incredible.
But a new season means a clean record. Stanford's ac
complishments last season, besides contributing to its pre
season No. 2 ranking, won't bring it any closer to a 2009-
2010 national title.
Stanford, which played with only one healthy senior last
season, is returning 13 players who earned their way to
and felt the pain of last April's loss to Connecticut. Jayne
Appel, the nation's seventh-best scorer last year, returns for
her senior campaign and point guard JJ Hones is finally
back at playing strength after a season on the sidelines. Join
ing them are a pair of freshmen looking to translate their
highly-regarded talents to college-level contributions.
BACKCOURT
This season, JJ Hones makes her return to the position
of point guard tearing her ACL last season. With Hones'
presence on the court, junior and All-Pac-10 selection
Jeanette Pohlen will transition into the role of shooting
guard. Pac-10 All-Defensive Team honorable mention Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude should also see a significant amount of
playing time in the backcourt this season.The red-shirt sen
ior presents a rare offensive and defensive threat, having
contributed 29 three-pointers, 90 assists and 32 steals to the
Cardinal's past season.
A guard from Las Vegas, Nev., sophomore Lindy La
Rocque will also return to the team with her share of defen
sive and offensive merit, with 119 three-point attempts and
18 steals last season.
Finally, juniors Melanie Murphy and Hannah Donaghe
and sophomore Grace Mashore add to the backcourt rota
tion.
WING
After successfully starting in all 38 games last season,
junior Kayla Pederson returns to the wing position for her
third season with the Cardinal. Last year, she averaged 10.8
points and 7.2 rebounds a game and scored an impressive
32 three-pointers during the season. Red-shirt junior Harri
son returns to the court for another season after a debilitat
ing knee-injury shut down her 2007-2008 season. Finally,
freshman and Beavercreek, Ohio native Mikaela Ruef

rounds

off the line-up at

the wing. The presence

of this 2009 Ohio Gatorade
Player of the year lends a hand to a highly

anticipated season.

POST f
This is where Stanford really shines the Cardinal's
post players are, without a doubt, among the best in the
nation. Jayne Appel returns for her senior year and is al- I
ready an early pick for player of the year. She was the 1
seventh-best shooter in the NCAA last season and is '
among Stanford's all-time greatest in shots blocked, field
goal percentage, rebounding and total points. In short,
she's one of the best and most motivated players to
ever don a Cardinal jersey.
Appel is joined by capable sophomore Nnemkadi Og
wumike, who posted an astonishing 62.9 shooting percent
age in her freshman year. Classmate Sarah Boothe, whom
head coachTaraVanDerveer played in every game last sea
son, also accompanies the pair.
Alongside Stanford's top three post players are junior
Ashley Cimino, who rebounded from a back injury by
shooting 60 percent last season and freshman Joslyn Tin
kle, A native of Missoula, Mont., Tinkle was named the

Gatorade Player of the Year in her home state last year
and earned McDonald's and WNBA Ail-American
honors. ,

SCHEDULE
As per usual, the Cardinal faces a tough slate
of non-conference opponents scheduled for the
2009-2010 season. Highlighting the schedule is a
rematch against defending national champion
Connecticut on December 23. Stanford faces a I
pair of experienced teams in Duke (Dec. 15) /
and Tennessee (Dec. 19) as well and also
squares up against Utah, Gonzaga, DePaul J

and Fresno State.
Of course, Stanford will have to compete

against its Pac-10 opponents as well, against
whom it went 17-1 last season. If it lives up to last
year's example, the Cardinal could win its tenth con-

secutive regular season conference title and its sev
enth overall Pac-10 tournament title.

SCHEDULE
As per usual, the Cardinal faces a tough slate
of non-conference opponents scheduled for the
2009-2010 season. Highlighting the schedule is a
rematch against defending national champion
Connecticut on December 23. Stanford faces a I
pair of experienced teams in Duke (Dec. 15) /
and Tennessee (Dec. 19) as well and also
squares up against Utah, Gonzaga, DePaul J

and Fresno State.
Of course, Stanford will have to compete

against its Pac-10 opponents as well, against
whom it went 17-1 last season. If it lives up to last
year's example, the Cardinal could win its tenth con-

secutive regular season conference title and its sev
enth overall Pac-10 tournament title.
