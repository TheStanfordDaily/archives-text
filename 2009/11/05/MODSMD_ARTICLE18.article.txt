# NOTHING BUT NORPAC
## Cardinal makes run at conference championship 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
After a strong season of steady wins, the
Stanford women's Field Hockey team was
brought back to earth with back-to-back loss
es this weekend. While Stanford's record sunk

to 13-4 overall, it remains a proud 5-1 in Nor-
Pac conference play.

No. 12 Stanford headed to the east coast
this weekend to face No. 1 Maryland and No.
15 Louisville.The trip offered a break from the
league play in which Stanford has already
proven itself triumphant the Cardinal se
cured a No. 1 seed going into the NorPac
Championships and captured the West Divi
sion regular season title after a 4-2 win over
Cal two weeks ago. Radford gained the No. 1
seed in the East Division and it will play UC
Davis in the first round of the tournament.

Last weekend's non-conference matches
provided the Cardinal with a chance to im
prove its NCAA Tournament profile. Howev
er, the matchup against Maryland proved too
much for Stanford and clearly illustrated why
Maryland, the defending national champion,
is the best team in the country. This victory for
the 18-0 Terps helped give Maryland its first
undefeated regular season in school history.
Although they lost to Maryland 6-2, the
women still had reason to celebrate, as they
put up a good effort and were only trailing 3-2
at halftime. Maryland has achieved many
blowout wins season and Stanford is just one
of five teams that has been able to score more
than once on the Terps.

Freshman star Becky Dru scored the first
goal for Stanford, with a pair of assists from
junior Jaimee Erickson and senior Nora Soza.
Junior Xanthe Travlos provided the Cardinal's
second goal, working off an assist from Dru to
narrow the Terps' margin of victory to 3-2.
Sophomore goalie Alessandra Moss had a
season-best 12 saves during the match, despite
the loss.

The Cardinal next took on Louisville, suf
fering another loss by a score of 4-1. Erickson
scored the lone Cardinal goal with assists from
Soza and Dru. Moss, however, had another
good performance, matching her career high
of 13 saves.

Now sitting at No. 15, Stanford will now
take on the NorPac Championship Tourna
ment, beginning November sth on The Farm.
The first match pits Stanford against the No. 4
seed in the East Division, Appalachian State.
The Mountaineers have not had the best of
seasons, racking up a dismal 0-8 record on the
road and a 3-1 record at neutral sites. The Car
dinal has the upper hand in this match, with a
6-0 record at home. Since last season, Stanford
has won nine home games in a row.
Despite the encouraging statistics, these
matches are vital, as they determine the Nor-

GAME NOTES: No. 15 Stanford enters this year's Nor-
Pac Championship with the top seed in the tourna
ment. The Cardinal is looking to avenge back-to
back losses suffered on last week's east coast road
trip. Appalachian State has lost eight straight games.

Pac Championship title and also affect the
NCAA Tournament. The winner of the Nor-
Pac Championship will participate in an
NCAA Play-In game next week against the
America East Conference Champion. The
winner of that match will gain a spot in the 16-
team NCAA Tournament.

Stanford has won the NorPac Champi
onship title for two years in a row and is look
ing to secure a third title. Losing in the NorPac
Championship would eliminate the team,
making every win absolutely necessary.
"We're playing every game like it's our last,
because from now on, if we lose, our season is
over," said senior offensive player Midori Ue
hara. "We're going to stay focused at practice
and mentally prepare ourselves for the high
emotion games we have coming up."
The women hope to assert themselves on
the field and confirm their first-place seeding
in the tournament.

"We are definitely looking to take NorPacs
and hoping to move on far afterward," sopho
more Stephanie Byrne said. "But in order to
do this, we need to make sure that we take
these upcoming games one at a time and focus
on playing our game each time we step on the
field."
