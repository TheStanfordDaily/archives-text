# Bridging the overseas' sports gap
## 
### Tom Taylor 
When I sat down to write
this column, I had visions
of typing something
highly insightful about
sports, something relevant to the read
ers of The Stanford Daily: something
NCAA or professional sports.
But I hit a wall. I just don't know
enough; I don't have the grounding of
growing up rooting for a local team
here. I'm just not American.
We speak pretty much the same
language and though I might not al
ways like to admit it, our cultures are
reasonably similar. Most Brits are well
versed in US history and society,
thanks to the flood of films, music and
TV programs and it's fairly easy to
adapt to life out here.
From the start, little things set us
apart from the crowd aside from
our accents, of course. But before long,
we are fully assimilated and even those
precious notes in our voices, the ones
we like to think make us sound more
intelligent, begin to fade away.
I just don't feel like a foreigner
here. My family might live half-way
around the globe, but this seems more
a home away from home than a far
away land.
Until, that is, I flip to the back page
of a newspaper and start reading. If
there is one thing that will always
make me feel like the (Non-Resident)
Alien that I am, it's sports.
Now, I love sports of any type, as a
fan or a player. Nothing beats the
thrill of being amongst fellow sup
porters, singing together, screaming
at the top of your voices, reveling in
the highs and despairing in the lows.
As you start off toward the stadium
before a game, you might be alone,
but bit by bit others join your march
until, as the stadium finally comes
into view, you are a heaving throng of
loyal colors.
Everyone loves the feeling of
adrenaline that comes from competi
tion. Whether you are a professional
athlete lining up for the final game of
the season that will define your entire
career, or just throwing a ball around
with your friends on a lazy Sunday af
ternoon, everyone feels that extreme
rush of sport. That last play, that final
move where you could win it, or
throw it away that's the buzz.
But here I just feel lost.
I'm learning, sure, but it's not easy.
When I watch the Stanford football
team, I stand with my fellow cardinal
hued students in the Red Zone. Un
consciously, I find myself carried
along with the crowd. I shout, I com
plain when the referees throw a
penalty flag on a promising play and I
sink my head in my hands when play
ers fumble away a possession.
But then I get back to my room,
still on a high from a thrilling win and
switch on my computer only to see
that FC has lost again. I get dragged
back to English sports in an instant.
Two years ago, my team was in the
highest league in English soccer. We
were rich, dynamic, exciting. Now,
we're looking like favorites for rele
gation to the third.
It hurts a lot. But perhaps worst is
that no one here cares. No one recog
nizes my blue and white hooped shirt.
No one even understands me.

The terminology used to describe
and analyze soccer seems like a for
eign language. When I flick through
the sports pages of even this publica
tion that I write for, browse the ESPN
Web site or catch the occasional piece
on TV, it all just sounds so strange and
unfamiliar. A "clean-sheet" becomes a
"shut-out," a final score of "one-nil" is
now "one-and-oh."

And it's not just soccer. I can't de

bate with anyone about the finer
points of England's great (albeit rather
lucky) Ashes win over Australia last
summer, or the chaos of the blood-sub
scandal in Rugby Union.
Here, the big news is that the
Phillies and Yankees are fighting for
the World Series, that the Stanford
women's soccer team has destroyed all
of their opposition so far and that the

football team could reach a bowl game
for the first time since 2001.

There is simply no easy way around it

I cannot keep dreaming of the
green, green grass on the soccer fields
of home. I'm here for the full experi
ence of living abroad, sol will just have
to immerse myself in the culture of this
country, to study its language and un
derstand its customs.

I am going to have to learn to love
American sports.
