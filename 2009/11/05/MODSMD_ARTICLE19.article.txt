# Bridging the overseas' sports gap
## 
### Tom Taylor 
When I sat down to write
this column, I had visions
of typing something
highly insightful about
sports, something relevant to the read
ers of The Stanford Daily: something
NCAA or professional sports.
But I hit a wall. I just don't know
enough; I don't have the grounding of
growing up rooting for a local team
here. I'm just not American.
We speak pretty much the same
language and though I might not al
ways like to admit it, our cultures are
reasonably similar. Most Brits are well
versed in US history and society,
thanks to the flood of films, music and
TV programs and it's fairly easy to
adapt to life out here.
From the start, little things set us
apart from the crowd aside from
our accents, of course. But before long,
we are fully assimilated and even those
precious notes in our voices, the ones
we like to think make us sound more
intelligent, begin to fade away.
I just don't feel like a foreigner
here. My family might live half-way
