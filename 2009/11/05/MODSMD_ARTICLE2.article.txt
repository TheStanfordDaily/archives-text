### VIVIANA ARCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's history department spon
sored a campus-wide screening of the
1972 classic "The Godfather"
Wednesday night and invited as its
keynote speakers history Profs. David
Kennedy and Paula Findlen.
"I've long loved the film and have
frequently shown it to my classes, espe
cially my freshman seminar, 'History
Through Literature: Reflections on the
American Experience,'" Kennedy told
The Daily.
Apart from enjoying the Francis
Ford Coppola-directed film, which
won the Oscar for Best Picture, the
screening was meant to be the begin
ning of a series of academic discussions
on the historical bases often employed
in cinema.

"There has been a lot of interest in
the department about having an annu
al series on how history becomes film,"
Findlen told The Daily. "A good num
ber of historians act as consultants on
films and documentaries at some point
in their careers, and many of us consid
er film to be a terrific resource in imag
inatively recreating the past."
Kennedy added, "This is the kick-off
event in what will be a continuing histo
ry department program to screen films
of historical interest."

The film was preceded by introduc
tory comments on the seminal place
