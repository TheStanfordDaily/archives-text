## History Department screens The Godfather Students study film history at campus-wide showing 
### VIVIANA ARCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's history department spon
sored a campus-wide screening of the
1972 classic "The Godfather"
Wednesday night and invited as its
keynote speakers history Profs. David
Kennedy and Paula Findlen.
"I've long loved the film and have
frequently shown it to my classes, espe
cially my freshman seminar, 'History
Through Literature: Reflections on the
American Experience,'" Kennedy told
The Daily.
Apart from enjoying the Francis
Ford Coppola-directed film, which
won the Oscar for Best Picture, the
screening was meant to be the begin
ning of a series of academic discussions
on the historical bases often employed
in cinema.

"There has been a lot of interest in
the department about having an annu
al series on how history becomes film,"
Findlen told The Daily. "A good num
ber of historians act as consultants on
films and documentaries at some point
in their careers, and many of us consid
er film to be a terrific resource in imag
inatively recreating the past."
Kennedy added, "This is the kick-off
event in what will be a continuing histo
ry department program to screen films
of historical interest."

The film was preceded by introduc
tory comments on the seminal place


AURELIA HEITZ/The Stanford Daily
the film holds in American cinema,
by Kennedy, Findlen and history
lecturer Carol McKibben.

"I always sought to find an artis
tic work that constitutes the core of
American history, which is immigra
tion, and the Mario Puzo novel and
movie fits this," Kennedy said.
Kennedy added, "This film, bet
ter than any other, does an excellent
job of capturing some essential
parts of the immigrant experience,"
Kennedy appreciated the lack of
glamour Coppola inserted into the
film, instead illustrating the Italian
immigrant experience in early 20th
century Little Italy with a bleak,
realistic perspective.
"We give ourselves a pat in the
back for being a nation of immi
grants, but this is a story of toil,
struggle and discrimination,"
Kennedy said. "It's no surprise that
in this time period, over 40 percent
of immigrants returned to their
native country."
Apart from Kennedy and
Findlen, McKibben spoke on the
portrayal of women in the movie.
"In the movie, women are seen as
victims, Madonnas or whores," she
said. "Yet historically, women were
very much central to families, and
Italians have often described their
family as matriarchal, an extremely
unusual instance."

The film was also chosen by the
history department for its portrayal
of Ellis Island, deconstructing the
myth of the gold-paved streets of

New York City.
"We picked Godfather to start
because it is a film within a film that
tells the story of immigration in two
directions: the arrival and struggles
of the first generation, and the
dilemmas and ambitions of the sec
ond generation," Findlen said.
For Findlen, a historian of Italy
with ancestral ties to the land, the
movie's subject matter carried a
personal significance.
"Many Italian immigrants my
great-grandfather, who returned to
Italy with an automated haircutting
machine, and my grandparents who
came and stayed arrived through
Ellis Island and from there to the
Little Italies of the East Coast," she
said. "Francis Ford Coppola's atten
tion to the details of this experience
is truly memorable, even if most
families never produced a
Corleone."

She added, "I love the Godfather
series as an epic between Italy and
America, filled with all sorts of
stereotypes, but also for its recre
ation of an era in which approxi
mately four million Italians, mostly
from Southern Italy, immigrated to
America."
All three scholars shared their
excitement for the movie and its his
torical importance in the cinema
and American history, but made
sure to allow their audiences to
have an open mind.
"We are going to make introduc
tory comments and then allow
everyone the pleasure of watching
the film with these thoughts in
mind," Findlen said.
