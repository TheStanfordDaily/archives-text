# Chamillionaire talks business
## Rap artist and film, music producer Quincy Jones III discuss entrepreneurship 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
The business of music is changing, and two hip
hop talents sharing the stage at Memorial
Auditorium said their roles are changing within a
rapidly evolving entertainment world.
"I started out as an artist, but then in the
process I became an entrepreneur," said film and
music producer Quincy Delight Jones 111, often
known as QD3.
"You start having to take the entrepreneurial
standpoint," added rapper Chamillionaire, whose
real name is Hakeem Seriki.
Chamillionaire said managing his brand and
business ventures was an ongoing and challenging
effort.
"It used to be a lot more fun when I wasn't the
boss," he said.
Still, keeping an active eye on developments in
business and technology has allowed the
Grammy award-winning rapper to stay ahead of
the curve.
"All the other rappers used to call me a nerd,
[being] on the Internet," Chamillionaire said.
"Then, like 5 million ringtones later..."
Jones, too, was full of praise for the Web and
new technological opportunities, saying the

Internet "allows every single person in the world
to become an entrepreneur."
"I coined the term, e-hustlin' it's available
to everyone," Jones added.
Jones, who has produced for famous artists
such as Tupac Shakur and LL Cool J in addition
to producing rap documentaries, repeatedly
pointed to personal branding as an essential part
of the new music landscape.
"Creating a look and feel for your band that
only your band has is going to be the key," he
said.
Chamillionaire shared his experience negoti
ating his deal with major label Universal
Records, where he sold his experience with mar
keting and publicity in addition to his value as an
entertainer. He said that knowledge of and
emphasis on his strengths has served him well in
bettering his position.
Explaining his strategy to his lawyer at the
time, Chamillionaire said, "I just told 'em every
thing people told me not to tell 'em."
"The business of being authentic worked for
me," he added.
He also pointed to the importance of coop
eration and personal interaction in creating
business growth. Chamillionaire said that labels
and other groups often fail to understand the

value created by long-term associates, including
his cameraman.
"I have to give him all these other titles," he
said, in order to convince labels of his worth.
He also cited the importance of his own inter
actions with fans, and missed opportunities for
cooperation he sees elsewhere.

"When you go to tech conferences, everyone is
always competing with each other,"
Chamillionairc said. "But you never know, if they
got together, they might be able to build Voltron."

porters was also a positive for Jones.
"If you have a personal connection to
your audience and your core demo...

that's sometimes better than the bill
board on Sunset Boulevard."

Jones was largely critical of major
labels and established media compa
nies, and said even their traditional

strengths were fading with the decline
of the influence of traditional advertis
ing.

"You can't buy your way into mar
kets as easy anymore," Jones said.

Jones called transitions in the indus
try a "paradigm shift."
"Right now, the only profitable
labels are the indies," he said.
"What's really interesting now is tak
ing down everything that we've known
about the entertainment industry," he
added.

His advice for new and future entre

preneurs was to seize the chances
afforded by major changes.
"It's the individual today who has
the biggest shot," Jones said.
"While this window is here, take
advantage of it," he added.
On the subject of social benefit,
Jones connected a drive to achieve good
with continued persistence in achieving
his own goals.
"My father always taught me that if
you have an underlying mission that's
positive for more than just you, that
will give you that extra strength,"

Jones said. He also pointed to the pos
itive benefits of many of his projects,
even his documentary series on hip
hop feuds.
University President John
Hennessy opened the event
Wednesday afternoon, exhorting the
audience to see challenges in the
world as openings for entrepreneurial
innovation.

"How do we change the world?" he
asked. "How do we make it better?"

"We face a lot of problems out there
in the world, and we're going to have to

approach them differently," Hennessy
added.

The event also marked the kick-off
of the Global Innovation Tournament
2009, organized by the Stanford
Technology Ventures Program
(STVP). The event asks contestants to
create value on the theme of "making
saving money fun." STVP Executive
Director Una Seelig moderated the dis
cussion.

Chamillionaire emphasized tak
ing advantage of the program and
the Entrepreneurial Thought

Leaders (ETL) series, of which the
event was a part.

"I wish I had an opportunity to do a
class like this, at a school like this," he
said.

The rap artist closed by telling the
audience, particularly students, to
"embrace this moment that you're in"
and to pursue their ideas.
"Maybe later on I'll be reading about
you in Forbes," he added.
