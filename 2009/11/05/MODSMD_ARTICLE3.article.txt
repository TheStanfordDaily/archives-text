## Rap artist and film, music producer Quincy Jones III discuss entrepreneurship

The business of music is changing, and two hip
hop talents sharing the stage at Memorial
Auditorium said their roles are changing within a
rapidly evolving entertainment world.
"I started out as an artist, but then in the
process I became an entrepreneur," said film and
music producer Quincy Delight Jones 111, often
known as QD3.
"You start having to take the entrepreneurial
standpoint," added rapper Chamillionaire, whose
real name is Hakeem Seriki.
Chamillionaire said managing his brand and
business ventures was an ongoing and challenging
effort.
"It used to be a lot more fun when I wasn't the
boss," he said.
Still, keeping an active eye on developments in
business and technology has allowed the
Grammy award-winning rapper to stay ahead of
the curve.
"All the other rappers used to call me a nerd,
[being] on the Internet," Chamillionaire said.
"Then, like 5 million ringtones later..."
Jones, too, was full of praise for the Web and
new technological opportunities, saying the

Internet "allows every single person in the world
to become an entrepreneur."
"I coined the term, e-hustlin' it's available
to everyone," Jones added.
Jones, who has produced for famous artists
such as Tupac Shakur and LL Cool J in addition
to producing rap documentaries, repeatedly
pointed to personal branding as an essential part
of the new music landscape.
"Creating a look and feel for your band that
only your band has is going to be the key," he
said.
Chamillionaire shared his experience negoti
ating his deal with major label Universal
Records, where he sold his experience with mar
keting and publicity in addition to his value as an
entertainer. He said that knowledge of and
emphasis on his strengths has served him well in
bettering his position.
Explaining his strategy to his lawyer at the
time, Chamillionaire said, "I just told 'em every
thing people told me not to tell 'em."
"The business of being authentic worked for
me," he added.
He also pointed to the importance of coop
eration and personal interaction in creating
business growth. Chamillionaire said that labels
and other groups often fail to understand the

value created by long-term associates, including
his cameraman.
"I have to give him all these other titles," he
said, in order to convince labels of his worth.
He also cited the importance of his own inter
actions with fans, and missed opportunities for
cooperation he sees elsewhere.

"When you go to tech conferences, everyone is
always competing with each other,"
Chamillionairc said. "But you never know, if they
got together, they might be able to build Voltron."
