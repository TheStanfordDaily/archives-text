As Prof. Joshua Cohen began lecturing on
equality of opportunity, Laura Wadden 'O9 burst
through the doors of Cubberley Auditorium,
megaphone in hand, on Wednesday afternoon. She
called out Sarah Masimore 'll, who as part of the
script, identified herself as gay to the class.
"I'm here to inform you that yesterday,
November 3,2009, voters in Maine took away your

said late Tuesday night, after the Yes on Question
1 campaign had declared victory. "It's an exact mir
ror of Prop. 8.1 almost feel exactly the same type
of emotions I felt last year."

Election Day, was less surprised at the results.
"In the days before the election, there were

polls which showed us losing by five points, there
were polls which showed us winning by ten,"
Casement wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "I think
that when you're fighting for something as contro
versial as gay marriage, you need to be prepared to
lose more often than you win."
That night, same-sex marriage advocates on
campus immediately began planning how they
would demonstrate against the results. They finally
