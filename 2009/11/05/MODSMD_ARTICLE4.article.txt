# ELECTIONS '09
## Gay marriage supporters storm class Students demonstrate disapproval of Maine's Question 1 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
As Prof. Joshua Cohen began lecturing on
equality of opportunity, Laura Wadden 'O9 burst
through the doors of Cubberley Auditorium,
megaphone in hand, on Wednesday afternoon. She
called out Sarah Masimore 'll, who as part of the
script, identified herself as gay to the class.
"I'm here to inform you that yesterday,
November 3,2009, voters in Maine took away your
ability to marry the person you love," Wadden said
to Masimore while confused students in Cohen's
"Justice" class looked on.

Wadden and Masimore, and about 20 other stu
dents, staged the performance in protest of the pas
sage of Maine's Question 1. The measure,
approved by 53 percent, as reported by CNN
Wednesday night, repealed the state's law allowing
same-sex marriage.

The news was a blow to LGBT activists nation
wide, coming exactly one year after California

passed the similar gay marriage ban, Proposition 8,
by a similar margin.
"I've been crying for the last hour," Wadden
said late Tuesday night, after the Yes on Question
1 campaign had declared victory. "It's an exact mir
ror of Prop. 8.1 almost feel exactly the same type
of emotions I felt last year."
Ben Casement 'lO, who organized phone banks
against Question 1 in the weeks preceding
Election Day, was less surprised at the results.
"In the days before the election, there were

polls which showed us losing by five points, there
were polls which showed us winning by ten,"
Casement wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "I think
that when you're fighting for something as contro
versial as gay marriage, you need to be prepared to
lose more often than you win."
That night, same-sex marriage advocates on
campus immediately began planning how they
would demonstrate against the results. They finally

decided to stage "takeovers" of three
different classrooms: Psych 1, a chem
istry lecture and Cohen's "Justice"
class.

Participants were recruited by word
of mouth and from the Community
Academic Support and Advising for
Queer Freshman (CASA) lunch being
held in the LGBT Community
Resources Center.

Joseph Moreno 'l3 was one of the
freshmen persuaded to join in the per
formances.

"I went by for the free food today,
and I decided to go ahead and go
because it's a good cause," he said. "I
think [the classes are] going to be pret
ty surprised."
Gathering in the Women's Center,
participating students ran through the
script before heading en masse to
Cubberley. Members spread them
selves through the lecture hall and
waited for their cue.

One portion of the script encour
aged the class to stand in solidarity with
the "second-class citizens." Over three
quarters of Cohen's class stood. When
the members filed out of the auditori
um, a few students clapped.
"I stood up and listened to them,"
wrote class member Alex Katz 'l2 in an
e-mail to The Daily. "It probably
helped spread awareness about the

vote in Maine."

But Michael Cruz 'l2, a student in
the class, thought that while the per
formance was effective, not all the stu
dents were sincere in their support.
"Many people were almost guilted
into standing up," he said. "I got the
feeling that most people were more
annoyed than anything else."
Cohen himself initially appeared
upset at the interruption, of which he
had no prior notice. As Wadden and
others chanted their way out of
Cubberley, Cohen exclaimed, "Excuse
me, before you go, next time you come
in, you ask me first."
Yet as the last member left, he
turned to the class and joked, "It's been
a long time since I did what they did."

The demonstration continued
Wednesday evening, when same-sex
marriage supporters gathered for a
"speak-out" in front of Old Union.
Though still upset, LGBT advo
cates remain committed to fighting
until same-sex marriage is fully legal
ized on the federal level.

"I think it's clear that allowing gay
and lesbian couples to marry is the
right thing to do, and I think we need to
pursue it by any means possible,"
Casement said. "The public will catch
up when it's ready."
But, he added, "This struggle will
continue to be hard-fought, and we will
have to contest it every inch of the
way."
