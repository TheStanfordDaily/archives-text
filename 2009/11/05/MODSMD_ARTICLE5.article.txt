## Radiologist scans mummy CT scans provided for exhibit at San Francisco Legion of Honor

This summer, a 2,500 year-old Egyptian
mummy went home. Not to Egypt, but to the
San Francisco Legion of Honor, which finally
brought back its resident mummy after loan
ing him out to a Stockton museum for the past
65 years.

Stanford radiology Prof Rebecca Fahrig
helped the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco (FAMSF) welcome the mummy by
providing computed tomography (CT) scans
to put on display in a special homecoming
exhibition.

In celebration of the mummy's return, a

new exhibit at the Legion of Honor entitled
"Very Postmortem: Mummies and Medicine"
opened on Halloween.

The mummy, a minor priest named
Irethorrou (meaning "The Eye of Horus is
Upon You"), is one of thousands of mummies
found at the Middle Egyptian site of Akhmim.
He lived during Egypt's 27th dynasty, in reali
ty a period of Persian rule in Egypt and died in
500 B.C. between the ages of 35 and 45.
"The Tut exhibit at [FAMSF] has no actu
al mummy," Fahrig explained, "so the Legion
of Honor decided that it would be a good time
to display one." FAMSF Curator of Ancient
Art Renee Dreyfus considered different ways
to approach the exhibition and decided to
look into the use of CT scans to examine the
mummy.
