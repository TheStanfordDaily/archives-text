## Radiologist scans mummy CT scans provided for exhibit at San Francisco Legion of Honor 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN 
This summer, a 2,500 year-old Egyptian
mummy went home. Not to Egypt, but to the
San Francisco Legion of Honor, which finally
brought back its resident mummy after loan
ing him out to a Stockton museum for the past
65 years.

Stanford radiology Prof Rebecca Fahrig
helped the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco (FAMSF) welcome the mummy by
providing computed tomography (CT) scans
to put on display in a special homecoming
exhibition.

In celebration of the mummy's return, a

new exhibit at the Legion of Honor entitled
"Very Postmortem: Mummies and Medicine"
opened on Halloween.

The mummy, a minor priest named
Irethorrou (meaning "The Eye of Horus is
Upon You"), is one of thousands of mummies
found at the Middle Egyptian site of Akhmim.
He lived during Egypt's 27th dynasty, in reali
ty a period of Persian rule in Egypt and died in
500 B.C. between the ages of 35 and 45.
"The Tut exhibit at [FAMSF] has no actu
al mummy," Fahrig explained, "so the Legion
of Honor decided that it would be a good time
to display one." FAMSF Curator of Ancient
Art Renee Dreyfus considered different ways
to approach the exhibition and decided to
look into the use of CT scans to examine the
mummy.

Stanford radiology Prof. Rebecca Fahrig makes computed tomography (CT) scans of a 2,500-year-old
mummy called Irethorrou. The mummy is provided by the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco.
According to Fahrig, the purposes
of the scans were clear from the
beginning: to create a forensic facial
reconstruction of the mummy using
bone structure analysis (in the same
way that modern forensic investiga
tors do) and to use the high-resolu
tion 3D imagery to do a completely
non-invasive digital "unwrapping" of
the mummy.
This is not Fahrig's first time
working with mummified patients
she collaborated with the
Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum three
years ago on scanning the mummy of
a five-year-old girl. Although she
enjoys the different experience and
learning more about mummies and
Egyptology, it is a far cry from her
usual research at the School of
Medicine.

"We used the Siemens artis dTA
C-arm imagery system, which can be
used to provide real-time video x-ray
images as well as to make CT images
that you can slice and dice so that you
can see details about the inside of the
object," Fahrig said.
The system has applications for

living patients, as well, including its
potential use to get 3D images of
the beating heart, which could be
used to guide procedures where a
small area of malfunctioning heart
tissue (e.g. after a heart attack) is
killed on purpose.

The results of the scans of
Irethorrou were sent to information
technologists at Stanford, who
processed them into a visual format
and interpreted by Egyptologist
Jonathan Elias, Director of the
Akhmim Mummy Studies
Consortium. They then were sent to
Fovia Inc., a Palo Alto-based soft
ware company, which used the radio
logical data to create a "fly through"
movie that guides the viewer through
the contents of the mummy, without
ever having to unwrap the linens.
One can see the 14 disease-curing
amulets placed strategically through
out the linen wrappings, as well as
high-resolution images of body parts
and preserved organs, without ever
disturbing the body itself.
"Very Postmortem" features
Irethorrou's still-unwrapped mummy,

black-and-gilt sarcophagus and his
reconstructed bust. Alongside him is
the reconstructed bust of his father,
Ankhwenefer, whose mummy cur
rently resides at the Washington
State Historical Society in Tacoma,
Wash.

Viewers can even see which nos
tril they pulled the brains out of dur
ing the mummification process and

evidence is visible of a possible con
tagious disease on the mummy's
back from which he may have been
suffering at the time of his death.
"People are very interested in the
marriage of art, technology, history,
medicine and Egyptian archaeology
and art history," Dreyfus said. "This
was a wonderful opportunity to put
all those aspects of culture together
in one place, as well as utilize the
Museum's collection of Egyptian
artifacts related to death, burial and
the afterlife."
Irethorrou came to the United
States in 1890 with wealthy San
Francisco businessman, politician
and explorer Jeremiah Lynch. Lynch
kept Irethorrou as a souvenir of his
adventures in Egypt until he died in
1917 and his estate donated the
mummy to the FAMSF.
"Very Postmortem: Mummies and
Medicine" will run through August
15, 2010 at the Legion of Honor in
San Francisco.
