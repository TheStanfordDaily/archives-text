This resurgence in scientific invest

During the past year, the School of
Medicine underwent a hiring freeze for
basic science faculty who primarily deal
with research. The school currently
employs 840 faculty members, well
within its cap at 900. For this reason, the
ARRA stimulus awards provide a wel

"The ARRA awards are made on a
competitive application basis and they

"The ARRA support from Nil I has
