## Stimulus funds help research School of Medicine faculty benefit from ARRA money 
### ANLE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford University is benefiting
from the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)
through stimulus funding for scientific
research. Individual faculty members
within the School of Medicine are espe
cially well situated to receive money
from the federal government.
The ARRA allotted $8.2 billion in
extramural funding to the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) in an effort
to galvanize the American economy.
While the NIH generally finances a
wide array of grant programs, its distri
bution of ARRA funds is directed at
projects that can create or preserve jobs.
Furthermore, these ARRA projects
must be carried out in the next two
years, since ARRA funding cannot be
extended beyond September 2010.
This resurgence in scientific invest
ment is a welcome change after six years
of funding that was below inflation.
During the past year, the School of
Medicine underwent a hiring freeze for
basic science faculty who primarily deal
with research. The school currently
employs 840 faculty members, well
within its cap at 900. For this reason, the
ARRA stimulus awards provide a wel
come, albeit temporary, relief.

"The ARRA awards are made on a
competitive application basis and they
almost always go to individuals not insti
tutions," wrote School of Medicine
Dean Philip Pizzo in an e-mail to The
Daily.

"It is not a source of funds for univer
sities or medical schools to distribute, but
for faculty to compete for," Pizzo added.
"The ARRA support from Nil I has
supported existing faculty grants, new
highly competitive grants... as well as
some infrastructure support for equip
ment and even career development."

A number of researchers within the
Medical School have already procured
funding. According to Pizzo, the school
received approximately $5B million
during the first fiscal year of the ARRA
stimulus funding, which ended Sept. 30.
"It is important to note that
Stanford is among the smallest medical
schools in the country [relative to its
peer institutions]... consequently, we
are always smaller in total funds than
our much larger peer institutions, but
we do very well in [the competitive
amount] received per faculty member,"
Pizzo said.

The School of Medicine plans to
launch a website dedicated to the
results of its ARRA awards and the
number of jobs they have created on
Nov. 9.

While the ARRA research projects
are expected to help in the creation and
retention of jobs throughout the
American economy, it is doubtful that
they will greatly enhance the number of
research faculty at Stanford.
"We are not adding many new facul
ty — only a very limited number
due to ARRA funding," Pizzo
explained. "We are adding staff to sup
port the research projects, and their
support comes from these projects, and

if and when the support ends, so too
would their positions."
"ARRA funds will definitely allow
hiring of researchers to do work that
would otherwise not have been possi
ble," wrote Vice Provost and Dean of
Research Ann Arvin in an e-mail to
The Daily.
However, Arvin also commented,
"Much of the ARRA funding consists
of two year awards, so the impact on
hiring new faculty is limited."

Earth Sciences Dean Pamela
Matson echoed these sentiments.
Matson explained that within her
school, "long-term commitments to fac
ulty are not solved by short-term bene
fits of the stimulus funds."

Matson nonetheless acknowledges
that the ARRA stimulus funds present
a much sought-after opportunity for the
School of Earth Sciences.

"I think that the additional funds, if
we receive them, will benefit our facul
ty's research programs and will allow
them to support their students and
potentially new staff and equipment in
a beneficial way," Matson said. "But the
question remains, will we receive those
funds?"

"Earth Sciences is a small school,"
Matson added. "We're likely to benefit
from the stimulus funds at an individual
faculty member basis. It may influence
the number of staff that we hire, but it
would be at a very low level."
