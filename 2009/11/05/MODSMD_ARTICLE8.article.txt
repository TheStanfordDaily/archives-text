Do you want a lifestyle of attaining the goals
you've only dreamed of in the past?
Stanford Athletics recommends you get in
touch with a personal trainer.
Unbeknownst to most students, at any
given time, the Stanford Athletics department employs
around 20 personal student trainers for hire.
A quick browse through the posted information on
the Physical Education, Recreation and Wellness Web
site gives brief bios of the student trainers. Some are
certified by organizations like the National Strength
and Conditioning Association (NSCA), some have
degrees in things like Kineseology. And they all are pic
tured twice, once at work running or stretching or lift
ing weights, and once posed before the Arillaga Center,
sporting form-fitting black lycra t-shirts.
The Web site also features every trainer's personal
"exercise philosophy" telling readers how the trainer's
advice will allow them to "function at an optimal level
with respect their goals and needs."
A few of these trainers list in-progress bachelors and
graduate degrees at Stanford alongside their fitness cre
dentials. Athletics says their trainers are "enthusiastic fit
ness professionals or avid apprentices," which certainly
does not exclude students from applying.
But, to be hired, they still have to meet the same
qualifications as their professional colleagues.
"Basically, all of our trainers have nationally reconized
certifications," said Wendy Fortino, head of the personal
training program and assistant coordinator of
Recreational Fitness & Wellness. "Our student trainers
have the same requirements as our non-student trainers."
ft may be worth it. One student trainer last year,
Mark Kogan 'O9, felt that it may be the best-paying job
on campus. A former Track & Field team member, he
didn't want to give up exercise, and found that this job
provided the perfect outlet.
"I found I was spending all my time in the weight
room anyway," he said. "This way I could turn it into a
hobby that would make some money."
According to his online biography, Kogan, who vol
unteered as a trainer in high school, specializes in
"General Strength and Conditioning, Sports Specific
Training, Bodybuilding" and "Powerlifting." Last year,
Kogan trained around five clients, meeting with each
for an hour a week. He said the nature of the job var
ied from client to client.
"Some clients have goals," he said. "Things they

want to be able to do. Some just want to get back in
shape."
Kogan's training style also varied from client to
client. Some requested that he be extra strict with them.
"Yeah, I mean, a big part of my job is playing the

role of motivation coach," he laughed. "Some people
need a little more motivating than others."
He paused for effect. "And some people .. . need a
little less."
One of Kogan's most fulfilling experiences was with
a client who wanted to get back in shape so he could
surf on his trip to El Salvador. After the training ses
sion was over, and the trip rolled around, the client sent
Kogan pictures from his trip and the jubilant news that
he "surfed for 36 hours in six days."
Kogan smiled, remembering. "It was pretty cool."
Yet few undergraduates take advantage of the per
sonal trainer program.
One factor may be the cost.
"I've been advised by more than a dozen weight
training coaches," said George Bridges 'l2. "And I
think that using a personal trainer on a consistent basis
is a huge waste of money."
Fortino said that the fixed rates for Personal
Training Packages are comparatively inexpensive.
Mostly intended to cover the program's costs, prices
range from $lOO for two sessions to $B4O for twenty, for
non-students. The student discount sits at about ten
percent.
Bridges felt that fitness experts are only neccessary
for consultation.
"There's just no need to pay somebody to monitor
every work out," he added.
But it's not because students undervalue fitness
either. In fact, the drive to optimize whether in aca
demics or health is, in a sense, a Stanford hallmark.
"Stanford students don't just break world records,"
Erich Wolodzko 'O9 said. "They annihilate them."
And although Wolodzko said this while planning to
make the world's largest gingerbread man, it is not so
difficult to direct this attitude towards something a lit
tle more fundamental. Stanford undergraduates are
young, smart and motivated. All of the personal train
ers' "exercise philosophies" are in some sense preach
ing to the choir.
"I don't need someone to yell at me," said Lili Hsu
'll, explaining that she knows how to motivate herself
without professional help. "Its no different from school
work. If I need motivation, I find a friend to work with,
or I set a goal with a time limit."
In the end, it's all a matter of getting the motivation
to put on those jogging shoes whether it comes from
within or from someone else.
