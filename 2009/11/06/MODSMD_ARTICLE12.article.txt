## EDITORIAL Rapper offers valuable non-academic insight 
### 
Student bemusement and even skepti
cism about rapper Chamillionaire's
lecture on campus Wednesday largely
evaporated as he spoke, and understand
ably so. As his thoughtful and arresting
points hit the back of the theater, it became
clear quite quickly that Chamillionaire em
bodied that incredibly potent mixture of
qualities often necessary for entrepreneur
ial success; mainly integrity, ingenuity and
charisma. Though his Grammy award-win
ning single "Riding Dirty" perhaps only ex
emplified the latter trait, Chamillionaire's
continued accomplishments offstage as Ha
keem Seriki CEO is easily attributed to that
trinity. Yet, for most walking into the audito
rium, the general vote of confidence in Seri
ki was incredibly low.
This may have been in part because of his
stage name or his fresh kicks and chain,
which to some may have seemed incongru
ous for the traditional role of lecturer, aca
demic or even entrepreneur. Yet for those
who entered the auditorium, Seriki's lecture
was informative, interesting and different.
He related to the student body casually, shar
ing his successes and failures as perfect ex
amples of entrepreneurship at its best and
worst. He spoke to the audience with an ease
and generosity of spirit few see from those
standing over them at the podium.
Unlike the conceptual thinking or theo
rizing that often dominates lectures, Seriki
engaged us using anecdotal evidence that al
lowed for a measure of entertainment, yes,
but also insight into the entrepreneurial con
cepts and problems such stories revealed. As
he laid out his experience and observations

of and about the major music industry, the
audience was captivated laughing, clap
ping, shaking their heads or nodding. All
signs said: We're listening.
In essence, this seems to confirm a need
for more of our lecturers to come from below
that dreaded but existent Ivory Tower. It is
the opinion of the Editorial Board that stu
dent lectures, and more importantly stu
dents, would benefit greatly from those non
traditional lecturers with real-world under
standing and refreshing ways of relating to
their audience. It would be wise to encourage
us to seek those from outside the bubble of
academia, whom we may trump in technical
education, but whose very life, rather than
study, has allowed for them to impart upon us
the real goal of a lecture: knowledge.
Perhaps the best example of this is the stu
dent reaction from one of Chamillionaire's
concluding thoughts: After a meticulously
detailed explanation of the corrupt and
skewed power dynamics he witnessed within
the music industry, he stopped for a moment
of silence. Rather than going off on a theoret
ical discourse on the importance of adhering
to ethics in business, he simply said, "I believe
in just doing it right." The sentence was sim
ple, personal and perhaps on paper may
seem a bit vague. But after relating so plain
ly, intimately and informally with his audi
ence about his character as entrepreneur, the
glazed silence of the usual student audience
during lecture was replaced with expressions
of affirmation and understanding for the rap
per sitting there quietly on stage, hands fold
ed gently in his lap, fresh kicks and modest
smile gleaming under the stage lights.
