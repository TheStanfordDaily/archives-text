# THE 						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## Need-blind admission for the whole world 'round 
### Shelley Gao 
During the annual Reunion Homecom
ing two weeks ago, a Roundtable was
held to discuss "The Road Back: From
Economic Meltdown to Renewal." The as
sembled experts emphasized education as
one of the most important factors in shaping
future economic growth. Some expressed
frustration that many international students
studying in the United States are prevented
from making long-term contributions to this
country due to the difficulty in obtaining visas
or green cards. A significant question not ad
dressed by the panel is whether international
students can access the world-class education
provided by American institutions.

Stanford needs to undertake an examina
tion of its policies toward foreign students,
namely re-energizing its efforts to achieve
need-blind admission for non-U.S. citizens or
Permanent Residents. The University de
serves praise for prioritizing this objective as a
special focus of the Stanford Challenge. Ad
ministrators in Admission and Financial Aid,
as well as the Office of Development in the
Alumni Center, have also been very receptive
to input. However, it is particularly challeng
ing to make headway in the current economy,
where many Americans are seeking greater
aid packages due to changes in their family
circumstances. Progress is only possible when
international need-blind admission remains
visible and relevant in the campus discourse.
Currently, international students compose
slightly more than six percent of Stanford's
undergraduate population, which is about 400
of 6,700 students. This is a much smaller num
ber compared to most of the Ivy League insti
tutions, which enroll around 10 percent inter
national undergraduates.
There are more than 3,500 international
students from over 130 nations who apply for
undergraduate admission every year. Interna
tional applicants are required to indicate "up
front" whether they will need financial assis
tance for the duration of their time at Stan
ford. Indeed, the admission Web site explicitly
states that the "need for aid will be a major
factor in your admission decision." For the
Class of 2010, more than 1,000 applied for aid;
ultimately, 35 were admitted.
Knowing this, many international students
unable to entirely fund their education simply
do not apply to Stanford at all. Of those who
do, Stanford inevitably rejects many com
pelling candidates who would be admitted if
their ability to pay were not a consideration.
The current practice severely limits our abili
ty to attract the best applicants. It diminishes
Stanford's competitiveness for talent and our
global standing. It also leads to the question of
whether we are fulfilling Jane Stanford's di
rective that the University keep "open an av
enue whereby the deserving and exceptional

may rise through their own efforts from the
lowest to the highest station in life."
The obstacle preventing Stanford from
reaching its full potential as an educator of
global leaders is its inability to admit interna
tional applicants solely based on merit. Stan
ford is lagging behind its peers. Dartmouth,
MIT, Yale, Harvard and Princeton are able to
offer need-blind admission for all undergrad
uates. Admittedly, most of these universities
have greater endowment per student ratio.
Unlike domestic students, foreign students
are not eligible for U.S. federal or state grants,
private loans and work-study programs. Thus,
financial aid must come directly from the Uni
versity through privately funded scholarships.
For international need-blind admission to be
a sustainable practice at Stanford.it requires a
$2OO million increase in our endowment. Cer
tainly, this is not a drop in the bucket.The bold,
visionary and strong-willed nature of our in
stitution will definitely be useful when striving
to meet this challenge.
There is no doubt regarding the value of
pursuing this weighty goal. There are many
benefits to ensuring that Stanford be open to
the best and brightest around the world. Inter
national diversity ensures an exciting experi
ence of peer-to-peer learning. American un
dergraduates can learn firsthand about differ
ent cultures and worldviews from their inter
national friends.

Equally important is the opportunity for
Stanford to educate individuals who will re
turn to their home countries. International
students have the duty to undertake positions
of public leadership and help the world under
stand American values and ideas. This is the
most valuable way they can give back to the
United States. Indeed, the "smart power" ap
proach in foreign policy involves an increasing
focus on international education and cultural
exchanges. Public diplomacy is crucial to re
viving America's global leadership and ad
vantageous to the United States' long-term
security and strategic interests. Simple inter
actions have the tremendous potential to
break down barriers and help us recognize
our shared humanity.
Sadly, there is little evidence of students
and alumni actively calling for change. With
out pressure from a mobilized constituency,
the University has little incentive to translate
its commitment into action. However, Stan
ford must recognize its responsibility to its
founders, to the nation and to the world to en
sure that its education is accessible to all.
