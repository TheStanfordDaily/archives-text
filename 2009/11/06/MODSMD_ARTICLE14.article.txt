## "Selling Out" 
### P.G. Mann 
Dear readers, I'm feeling the pinch of
the economy. In order to buy my
weekly gruel, I've had to lease my col
umn out to advertisers. Fortunately for you,
not to the same advertisers that wiggle when
I blink. Otherwise, you would be reading the
words "Enjoy Scruggs' Whole Meat Nuggets"
for the next 700 words, without experiencing
the pleasure of the adorable dancing nugget
that adorns the copy on my forehead.
Although I would like to take this oppor
tunity to say that Scruggs, a family (style)
farm operated by the Nihilex Corporation,
has been producing the finest naturally fla
vored Whole Meat Nuggets that you've come
to know and be strangely chemically addict
ed to since 1973. Of course, I receive compen
sation for the Scruggs Dancing Nugget I
sport in two-tone color above my eyebrows.
But I assure you there was no financial incen
tive for the Scruggs Super Bowl XXXII
Nugget-Off glow-in-the-dark tattoo that
shines through my underwear that ap
peared after a hazy night out on the town in
the company of two Scruggs Nugget employ
ees with a vial of GHB and a penchant for
prank tattoos.
Just so you know, I'm not the type of guy
who goes around hurling reckless accusations
of being slipped the date rape drug by Scrug
gs employees. But I know for a fact they did
because they left this message on my phone:
"Hey P.G., remember us? We're the two
Scruggs employees who slipped you the date
rape drug. Yeah, and we tattooed that huge
glow-in-the-dark Super Bowl Nugget-Off ad
on your ass!"
Initially, I was considering litigation, but
then Scruggs came to me with an offer I
couldn't refuse. They threatened to smash my
fingers into splinters unless I agreed not to file
suit. As compensation, however, they did

offer to send me a shipping crate of Scruggs
Whole Meat Nuggets and tattoo the Scruggs
Dancing Nugget on my forehead. I told them
that if they left the date rape drug out of it this
time, we would call it a deal. I've always loved
that dancing nugget.
But love and money are two different
processed meat products. And while I may
love Scruggs' nuggets, Bickelmeyer's pork
berries pay the bills:
The following is a paid advertisement by
Bickelmeyer's Old Country Partially Dehy
drogenated Pork Berries, a member of the
Domicorp Group:
Do you know what's in your nugget?...
Scruggs, subsidy of the Nihilex Corporation,
may look like your average God- fearing Mid
western mom-and-pop genetically modified
industrial chicken farm, but what if we told you
it was really a terrorist training ground, nour
ishing al-Qaeda one nugget at a time? What if
you were to learn that Osama bin Laden has
stayed alive all these years thanks to a steady
supply of Scruggs Whole Meat Nuggets?
That's right, the nuggets you feed your family
may be costing us thousands of innocent
American lives.

Did you know Scruggs imports nuggets to
a place called Venezuela, a SOCIALIST
country? Did you know that socialism is a di
abolical plot to rid the world of private
healthcare, devised by a Marxist named Karl
Marx and carried out by his Oriental hench
men Mao, Stalin and Barack Hussein
Obama? Did you know Scruggs means "athe
ist" in another language?
Why support terrorism and the oblitera
tion of democracy when you can enjoy a deli
cious freedom-loving, partially dehydro
genated Pork Berry brought to you by Bickle
meyer's? The folks at Bicklemeyer's have
been cultivating pork berries right here on

Main Street* for over 40 years. Our Old
Country flavor tastes of a simpler time in
America, when kids could play stickball on
the streets and munch on a pork berry, with
out fear of being recruited into a terrorist
youth organization or lured into a homosexu
al marriage. That's because each pork berry is
genetically infused with the spirit of Christen
dom. Yes, sir, when you bite into a Bicklemey
er's pork berry, you're consuming the blood
of Christ.
Transubstantiation not enough? Well,
after they come off the petri dish, we roll our
pork berries in the American flag, sing "I'm
proud to be an American" to them and press
them between the pages of an abridged two
for-one edition of the U.S. Constitution and
the Bible.
Our pork berries are what made Ayn
Rand so wonderfully selfish. They're what
Rush Limbaugh gave up painkillers for. And
they are the only partially dehydrogenated
pork product that Glenn Beck dunks at tea
parties.
Bickelmeyer's Old Country Partially De
hydrogenated Pork Berries. Real American
taste to die for!
*Main Street is what we call our industrial
labor campus for children in Burma. Educat
ing the community is a top priority at Bick
elmeyer's.
