## WEEKEND IN WASHINGTON Women's volleyball faces tough road games against ranked teams 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend proved to be a weekend of
firsts for the No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball
team.
The Cardinal (15-6, 8-3 Pac-10) defeated
USC 3-1 for the first time at home since 2006
and dropped a match to UCLA, 3-2, for the
first time since 2000. Stanford now faces a
tough weekend with road matches against
N0.4 Washington and No. 24 Washington State.
"Our defense is getting better and our
block is getting better, so we're dealing with
our opponents better, we're containing them,"
said Head Coach John Dunning. "But offen
sively, we're just getting stuck in rotations and
can't get out."

The matches against the Los Angeles
schools could have been what set the Cardinal
apart in the Pac-10. Two wins would have tied
Stanford for first in the conference with Wash
ington, making this upcoming weekend the de
facto Pac-10 championship match. However,
the split weekend puts Stanford tied for sec
ond in the Pac-10 with UCLA.

"Coming off of last weekend, we have been
grounded because we were beat by UCLA,"
said junior libero Gabi Ailes. "Going into this
weekend, Washington is a really good team,
better than UCLA, and we're really motivated
to go after them the second time around and
see what we can do. Hopefully, we can pull it
out again."

Two wins this weekend could lead to a
three-way tie for the title, but the Card must
first consider its upcoming matches before
thinking about who will come out on top of the
Pac-10.
"Our team knows that we could have
changed everything last weekend, but they
also know that it's not the end of the world ei
ther," Dunning said.
Washington has only dropped two matches
this season, one to Stanford and the other to
Washington State; both matches were road
losses. Last weekend, the Huskies picked up
wins at Arizona, 3-1 and Arizona State, 3-0.
"One of the keys for us last time was that
Janet (Okogbaa) had a great match," Dunning
said. "I think that she can have another great
match. We're looking for the match where four
or five hitters are on at the same time."
While Washington lost the first set against
Arizona, the Huskies pulled forward as Kindra
Carlson led with 18 kills, Jill Collymore added
14 kills and Airial Salvo put in 13 kills. A solid,
balanced offensive attack helped the Huskies
remain perfect against Arizona this season.
In Saturday's match, Washington swept
Arizona State, as Carlson hit a career-high 24

The No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball team faces an important road trip this weekend, as it takes on No. 4 Washington, which leads the Pac-1
0 by a game over the Cardinal, and No. 24 Washington State. With two victories, the Cardinal would at least be tied for first in the Pac-1 0.
