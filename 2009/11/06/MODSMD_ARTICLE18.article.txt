# Fall sports' title chances
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Now that the fall season is
coming to a close and
championship season is
upon us, it's time to take a
look at Stanford's fall teams and their
chances at an NCAA title. Stanford
trails UCLA by seven NCAA titles,
104 to 97.

Women's Volleyball
Cynthia Barboza and Foluke Ak
inradewo are names of the past now.
It's all about Klineman, Lichtman and
Okogbaa. The Stanford women's vol
leyball team is basically refueling
rather than rebuilding this year and it
is one of the best teams in the nation.
The No. 5 Cardinal is tied for second in
a wide-open Pac-10 and has big wins
over USC, UCLA and Washington.
This team has the experience of deep
NCAA runs and anything can hap
pen. The NCAA title is up for grabs
next month and Stanford certainly is
in the mix. The Card is a Regional host
this year; it would be a huge advantage
if the team were placed right here at
home with a trip to the Final Four on
the line.
Football
It's pretty safe to say Stanford
probably won't win the BCS National
Championship in football this season.
However, with one more win needed
for bowl eligibility, every game for
Stanford is going to be pivotal.The last
four games are the toughest of the en
tire schedule, so the Cardinal will have
its hands full. With one more win, pos
sible bowl destinations include Las
Vegas, San Diego and right here in the
Bay Area at AT&T Park. One of the
biggest games in a few years at Stan
ford is happening this weekend as No.
7 Oregon comes to visit. How huge
would a win over the Ducks be?
Men's Water Polo
Ranked No. 1 for a good portion of
the season, the now-No. 3 Cardinal is a
good pick for an NCAA appearance.
With rivals USC, Cal and UCLA all
ranked in the top four in the nation,
Stanford will have its hands full in the
MPSF tournament and beyond. Since
the NCAA Championships only takes
four teams, if Stanford does not win
the MPSF tournament it will need an
at-large bid. Chances are the Card's
resume is good enough, but we are
talking about winning the whole thing
here.The team has the players, the sen
iors and the big game experience.They
just need to put it together for a few
games in a row.
Men's Cross Country
One of Stanford's top-ranked
teams this year, the men's cross coun
try team has exploded onto the na
tional scene. Led by super sophomore
Chris Derrick and junior Elliott
Heath, the men's team has proven all
naysayers wrong thus far. Winning the
big Pre-Nationals race a few weeks
