# Fall sports' title chances
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Now that the fall season is
coming to a close and
championship season is
upon us, it's time to take a
look at Stanford's fall teams and their
chances at an NCAA title. Stanford
trails UCLA by seven NCAA titles,
104 to 97.

Women's Volleyball
Cynthia Barboza and Foluke Ak
inradewo are names of the past now.
It's all about Klineman, Lichtman and
Okogbaa. The Stanford women's vol
leyball team is basically refueling
rather than rebuilding this year and it
is one of the best teams in the nation.
The No. 5 Cardinal is tied for second in
a wide-open Pac-10 and has big wins
over USC, UCLA and Washington.
This team has the experience of deep
NCAA runs and anything can hap
pen. The NCAA title is up for grabs
next month and Stanford certainly is
in the mix. The Card is a Regional host
this year; it would be a huge advantage
if the team were placed right here at
home with a trip to the Final Four on
the line.
Football
It's pretty safe to say Stanford
probably won't win the BCS National
Championship in football this season.
However, with one more win needed
for bowl eligibility, every game for
Stanford is going to be pivotal.The last
four games are the toughest of the en
tire schedule, so the Cardinal will have
its hands full. With one more win, pos
sible bowl destinations include Las
Vegas, San Diego and right here in the
Bay Area at AT&T Park. One of the
biggest games in a few years at Stan
ford is happening this weekend as No.
7 Oregon comes to visit. How huge
would a win over the Ducks be?
Men's Water Polo
Ranked No. 1 for a good portion of
the season, the now-No. 3 Cardinal is a
good pick for an NCAA appearance.
With rivals USC, Cal and UCLA all
ranked in the top four in the nation,
Stanford will have its hands full in the
MPSF tournament and beyond. Since
the NCAA Championships only takes
four teams, if Stanford does not win
the MPSF tournament it will need an
at-large bid. Chances are the Card's
resume is good enough, but we are
talking about winning the whole thing
here.The team has the players, the sen
iors and the big game experience.They
just need to put it together for a few
games in a row.
Men's Cross Country
One of Stanford's top-ranked
teams this year, the men's cross coun
try team has exploded onto the na
tional scene. Led by super sophomore
Chris Derrick and junior Elliott
Heath, the men's team has proven all
naysayers wrong thus far. Winning the
big Pre-Nationals race a few weeks

ago and following it up with a Pac-10
victory over defending NCAA
champ Oregon has put Stanford in
prime position to capture its first na
tional title since 2003.
Women's Cross Country
The women's team has been ham
pered by injuries to its two top run
ners for most of the year. The team
has still run well and just needs to get
through the West Regionals to quali
fy for the NCAA Championships.
The women probably will do it, and if
healthy, can pose a threat on any day.
The men's chances look better here,
but you can never guess how people
will run on any given day don't
count any team out of it.
Men's Soccer
After a few disappointing seasons,
the men's soccer team has righted it
self this year and is looking to secure
an NCAA appearance for the first
time since 2002, when it made it all the
way to the College Cup. Ranked in
the top 25 at various points in the sea
son, the team can beat Cal next week
end to ensure a postseason berth. It is
unclear how far Stanford is capable of
going in the tournament, as the top
teams in the nation are pretty strong.
However, Stanford has shown it can
play with the best (see: win over
UCLA two weeks ago), so we cannot
count them out of anything.
Field Hockey
Another Stanford team having a
strong season is the women's field
hockey team. The Cardinal is ranked
No. 15 in the nation and is the heavy
favorite for the NorPac title this week
end. Barring any unforeseen losses,
the team should be invited to the
NCAA tournament for the second
straight year. However, the teams in
the tournament are strong Stan
ford got a little taste of the competi
tion last week, losing two games in a
row to highly ranked Louisville and
Maryland squads. So while we know
Stanford can dominate the NorPac,
the Cardinal will have to turn it on
when it reaches the tournament. Up
sets are possible, but Stanford must be
on its game in order to string a bunch
of them together at the right time.
Women's Soccer
Stanford's only undefeated team
and No. 1 team in the nation, the
women's soccer team is enjoying a
record-breaking season. The stats,
goals and awards can speak for them
selves this team is hungry for the
NCAA title this year and I can't think
of another team more worthy and de
serving. At 19-0-0, Stanford should be
the top seed in the NCAA tourna
ment and have the easiest path to the
NCAA Finals. This team is for real
this year and after last year's tough
loss in the College Cup to Notre
Dame, it is ready for something more.
If I was betting on a Stanford team to
bring home the hardware this fall,
these ladies would be it.
Expert predictions: Stanford will win
two NCAA titles this fall (women's
soccer, men's cross country) and
make two more Final Four appear
ances (men's water polo and
women's volleyball).
