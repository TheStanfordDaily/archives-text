## Stanford hosts No. 7 team in nation 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Coach Jim Harbaugh has clearly turned Stanford
football around in his three years on the Farm, but
the transformation is not complete just yet.
Stanford needs just one win in its next four games
to secure a bowl bid, which would serve as a symbol
ic accomplishment for measuring the success of Har
baugh's program. The odds may be in the Cardinal's
favor to get that final win, but with four of the tough
est opponents left on its schedule, it won't be easy.
The Cardinal (5-3,4-2 Pac-10) faces the first test
of its season-ending gauntlet when it takes on the
No. 7 Oregon Ducks (7-1,5-0 Pac-10) this Saturday
at Stanford Stadium.
Oregon started its season off on one of the low
est notes possible, getting shut down 19-8 in front of
a national audience by Boise State. That wasn't even
the worst part, though; (former) running back
LeGarrette Blount added injury to insult after suck
er-punching the Broncos' Byron Hout.
Despite that embarrassing start, however, the
Ducks come into Saturday's contest riding as high as
they possibly could be. Coach Chip Kelly's team has
won seven in a row since the opening-day debacle in
Idaho and currently sits in the driver's seat of the
Pac-10 race as the only undefeated team in confer
ence play.
"They're a good offense, and they exposed USC a
little bit," senior tailback Toby Gerhart told the San
Francisco Chronicle.
Exposed is one way of putting it.The Ducks hand
ed Pete Carroll the worst loss of his collegiate coach
ing career, putting up an astounding 613 yards in a
47-20 drubbing of USC last weekend.

NOTES ! Stanford looks to become bowl eli
gible for the first time since 2001, which
was also the last time it defeated Oregon.
No. 7 Oregon is coming off of a dominant
47-20 victory over Pac-10 powerhouse
USC, which put the Ducks in the driver's
seat for a Pac-10 title. The Cardinal has
won nine of its past 10 home games.



That said, Saturday's game will
still be a battle, and it is a battle that
will be won and lost on the ground
and in the trenches. Oregon is the
conference's top team at what the
Cardinal does the best, namely run
ning the football. The Ducks get
their yards much differently, howev
er, running for the corner with quar
terback Jeremiah Masoli leading
Kelly's spread-option offense. While
Masoli has established a reputation
as primarily a running quarterback,
he has still thrown the ball with plen
ty of success this season, completing
more than 60 percent of his attempts
for six touchdowns and only two in
terceptions.

"He's as good a dual-threat quar
terback as you're going to see in the
country," Harbaugh said.
Complementing Masoli in the
backfield has been, not LeGarrette,
but Ducks freshman LaMichael
James. James has been giving Toby
Gerhart a run for his money as the
best running back in the Pac-10 this
season, amassing 918 yards on just
130 carries. James stands at only 5-

foot-9, but that hasn't hindered the
speedy back, especially in recent
contests: James haunted the USC de
fense on Halloween night with 183
yards and has rushed for over 100
yards in five of his last six games.
The Cardinal defense, which has

struggled against the ran at points
this season, will certainly need to be
up to the task if Stanford is going to
pull off the upset.
"I've never seen our team intimi
dated," Harbaugh said of the chal
lenge Stanford faces Saturday.
The Cardinal has reason to be op
timistic, too, as the team has not lost
a home game yet this season, and has
won nine of its last 10 home games
dating back to the end of the 2007
season. The team also had an extra
week to prepare for the Ducks' visit
to town; while Oregon was reveling
in the emotional high that comes
with beating USC, the Cardinal was
studying and preparing for the chal
lenge it will face this Saturday.
The season doesn't ride on Satur
day's match-up with the Ducks, but a
win would certainly make the re
mainder of Stanford's season much
smoother. Against an opponent like
Oregon at home, the Cardinal simply
does not have much to lose. Gerhart,
a senior looking to qualify for the
first bowl game of his career, knows
this better than anyone.
"There's definitely not a feeling
of fear around the locker room," he
said. "There's a feeling that this is an
opportunity to make a name for our
selves and show that we're moving
up into the top tier in the Pac-10."
