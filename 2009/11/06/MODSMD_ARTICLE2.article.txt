## Stanford hosts No. 7 team in nation 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Coach Jim Harbaugh has clearly turned Stanford
football around in his three years on the Farm, but
the transformation is not complete just yet.
Stanford needs just one win in its next four games
to secure a bowl bid, which would serve as a symbol
ic accomplishment for measuring the success of Har
baugh's program. The odds may be in the Cardinal's
favor to get that final win, but with four of the tough
est opponents left on its schedule, it won't be easy.
The Cardinal (5-3,4-2 Pac-10) faces the first test
of its season-ending gauntlet when it takes on the
No. 7 Oregon Ducks (7-1,5-0 Pac-10) this Saturday
at Stanford Stadium.
Oregon started its season off on one of the low
est notes possible, getting shut down 19-8 in front of
a national audience by Boise State. That wasn't even
the worst part, though; (former) running back
LeGarrette Blount added injury to insult after suck
er-punching the Broncos' Byron Hout.
Despite that embarrassing start, however, the
Ducks come into Saturday's contest riding as high as
they possibly could be. Coach Chip Kelly's team has
won seven in a row since the opening-day debacle in
Idaho and currently sits in the driver's seat of the
Pac-10 race as the only undefeated team in confer
ence play.
"They're a good offense, and they exposed USC a
little bit," senior tailback Toby Gerhart told the San
Francisco Chronicle.
Exposed is one way of putting it.The Ducks hand
ed Pete Carroll the worst loss of his collegiate coach
ing career, putting up an astounding 613 yards in a
47-20 drubbing of USC last weekend.

NOTES ! Stanford looks to become bowl eli
gible for the first time since 2001, which
was also the last time it defeated Oregon.

47-20 victory over Pac-10 powerhouse
USC, which put the Ducks in the driver's
seat for a Pac-10 title. The Cardinal has
won nine of its past 10 home games.
