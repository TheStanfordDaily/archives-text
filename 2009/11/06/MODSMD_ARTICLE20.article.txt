# Rebuilding starts now
## Exhibition game tonight 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's basketball will hit
the court for its first competition of
the 2009-10 season on Friday when it
hosts Sonoma State in an exhibition
match at Maples Pavilion.
The Division-II Seawolves will be
the first test for a Cardinal team that
enters the year with a dramatically
different roster from the end of last
season. Stanford lost four players, in
cluding three starters, to graduation
last year, and has dealt with a number
of injuries and off-court issues since
it was knocked out of the College
Basketball Invitational last March.
As a result, expectations are low for
Stanford it placed last in the an
nual preseason Pac-10 media poll.
"For us, we are at an exciting time
of the year," said Head Coach John
ny Dawkins. "We have lost three sen
iors that were an important part of
our team. Our younger players are
going to get some playing time. This
is a different season."
Senior guard and forward Landry
Fields is the top returner for the Car
dinal. At a lanky 6-foot-7 with a large
wingspan, Fields realized his im
mense potential during the 2008-09
season and started 33 contests. De
spite rarely being the first option on
offense, he was third on the team in
scoring, dropping 12.6 points per
game while shooting just under 50
percent from the floor. A complete
player, Fields led the team in re
bounding and steals, and was second
in blocks and third in assists. Due to
the loss of Lawrence Hill and Antho
ny Goods, who shared the offensive
load, Fields is expected to be the Car
dinal's primary scoring threat.
"We have a player who gained a
lot of experience last season in
Landry Fields. I am excited about his
play. He is our captain and I think he
can be one of the best players in the
conference," Dawkins said. "He is a
very good competitor. I could talk
about his versatility, but he competes
every day, every play. He has a great
work ethic."
While Fields will be a constant in
the lineup, the rest of the depth chart
appears up for grabs, in large part be
cause of injuries, suspensions and in
experience.
Sophomore Jeremy Green, who
averaged 6.4 points per game in a re
serve role, was expected to start at
shooting guard and play a major of
fensive role, but he has been sus
pended indefinitely. A timetable for
his return is unknown. Junior center
Josh Owens, who started 28 games
last season, is suffering from a pub
licly unknown injury and is not ex
pected to come back any time soon.
Promising freshman forward Andy
Brown is gone for the year with an
ACL tear, and forward Will Paul, sus
pended for academic reasons, will
not be eligible to rejoin the team
until after the season.
That leaves a motley crew of for
mer walk-ons, true freshmen, a trans
fer and past reserves to pick up the
slack. Senior Drew Shiller, who aver
aged 2.5 points per game last year, is
one of the top returners and is ex
pected to start at point guard. How
ever, Dawkins has emphasized that
the team does not have a true floor
general and that there will be a

steady rotation early on. Indeed,
much of the Cardinal's backcourt
lacks a cemented position Shiller,
sophomore Jarrett Mann, freshman
Gabriel Harris and redshirt junior
Da'Veed Dildy are all in the running
for time at the "one."
"We will have to do it by commit
tee," Dawkins said. "We don't have a
true point guard in our program right
now. We will have to make adjust
ments in our offense to make that
work."
All four will likely play at shoot
ing guard, too. They will be joined by
senior Emmanuel Igbinosa, whose
jump shot has earned praise during
the off-season.
The frontcourt, aside from Fields,
may be even less locked down.
Sophomores Matei Daian and Jack
Trotter, former walk-ons who both
earned scholarships for this season,
highlight a group that includes
sophomore Elliot Bullock and
Santa Clara and Foothill College
transfer Andrew Zimmermann.
Trotter will be expected to con
tribute offensively, while Daian
should highlight the defensive and
rebounding effort.
The Cardinal, however, is not the
only Pac-10 team entering the year
with rampant uncertainty. Washing
ton State, for example, saw its highly
regarded coach, Tony Bennett, bolt
for Virginia. USC, who won the con
ference tournament last year, lost
key cogs to the NBA and had to deal
with Tim Floyd's surprising resigna
tion and the ramifications of that
decision. It is entirely possible then,
that Stanford could position itself
better than it did last year, when it
finished ninth in the Pac-10.
The team will start its journey
tonight against the Seawolves, who
return their top scorer, guard Ben
Washington. While the game will not
count, the Cardinal must be wary of a
letdown Syracuse, ranked No. 25
in the preseason coaches' poll, lost to
Division-II Le Moyne in an exhibi
tion on Tuesday.
Regardless, that is an anomaly
and given the uncertainty surround
ing Stanford's roster, the Cardinal
should use the game to get a better
feel for its depth before starting the
regular season at San Diego next
weekend.
"We are going to have young
players that are ready to go out there
for us. We feel with that knowledge
that they will continue to grow and
we are excited about this season and
where we can take things," Dawkins
said.
Tip off against Sonoma State will
be at 7 p.m.

Senior Drew Shiller will see an expanded role this season as the point guard for the Cardinal. Stanford faces the challenge
of replacing four seniors, as well as a number of suspended and injured players who will miss the start of the season.
