Booties
Just because it's getting colder outside does not mean that footwear is limited to Uggs. While sheepskin boots hold a comfy place in all of our hearts, step out in
something a little more cutting edge, like this season's must have booties. Investing in a pair of ankle boots in black, grey or camel is a wise decision, because they can be
worn with skirts and jeans. They are sassier and more flirtatious than knee-length boots, and are also seasonally appropriate. Booties with embellishments like
bows or zippers earn extra points.

Faux fur
While you can't go wrong with a classic wool peacoat, add some pizzazz to your winter wardrobe with a dash of faux fur. Cheetah print jack
ets, black mink stoles and fur-lined gloves are saucy additions to an otherwise standard outfit, not to mention they keep you warm.
Look out for lots of fur this winter, but keep in mind that most of it is faux. Intermission doesn't want you covering somebody in red
paint by accident. . .
Attention-grabbing scarves
It is very rare that accessories serve as both fashion and function, but winter provides the perfect opportunity to don
scarves, which can be the perfect complement to any outfit. This season in particular, scarves are very bold. Look for obscene amounts

of cloth with American Apparel's popular circle scarf or the all-the-rage hooded scarf.
Also, trolling consignment stores can lead to some scarves with bold personalities and
patterns.


While people may still be sun tanning out on Wilbur field, winter is fast approaching, and for Intermission that means one thing winter fashion. That's right, it is time to retire
those gladiator sandals and neon racerback tanks, and invest in these seasonal staples. These essentials will ensure that you look trendy and stay toasty warm this winter quarter,
because let's face it highlighter hues were so summer 2008.
