During the second
week of school, while
most Stanford fresh
men had replaced Facebook
with Courseßank and were
attempting to grasp the con
cept of Thursday night as part
of the weekend, Taryn
Peacock was memorizing
lines.
Peacock,'l3, plays
the lead role in "Bulrusher,"
the Blackstage Theater
Company's latest show,
which opens Nov. 5 in the
Nitery Theater.
The show is co-spon
sored by the Stanford Drama
Department and Blackstage
Theater Company, a student
performance group dedicated
to presenting multicultural
work and promoting black
expression through theater.
Founded in 2001, the
current Blackstage company
consists of a wide range of
students; from Humßio to
drama majors, from freshmen
to graduate students, the
group is quite diverse.
Artistic Director A-lan Holt
' 11, is excited to be able to
work closely with the
Stanford Drama Department
on this performance, some
thing that is not often done
with student groups. She calls
it a "wonderful collaboration"
and an excellent experience
to be able to come together
with the Drama Department
faculty.
I recently had the
privilege of watching a
rehearsal of "Bulrusher." I
came into the theater on a

Thursday night, having no
idea of what to expect other
than perhaps an opportunity
to catch up on some lost
sleep, but the performance
completely captivated me.
Even in its raw form there
was no lighting scheme,
music or costumes I was
incredibly engaged all the
way through the two acts.
The physical sparseness of
the set drives the focus of the
show to the richness of the
characters and their dialogue.
The script is both humorous
and beautiful and it is inject
ed with elements of poetry
through Bulrusher's frequent
soliloquies.
There is genuinely no
way to reduce the complexity
of the play to a few sen
tences, but here are the basics
of the plot: Bulrusher is a
young multiracial girl grow
ing up in a predominantly
white town north of San
Francisco in the 'sos. She is
found floating in the river as
a baby and is raised by a
schoolteacher who introduces
her to the wild cast of charac
ters in this small town the
feisty owner of a local broth
el, the logger who frequents
said brothel and the young
man who tries to win
Bulrusher over with his guitar
and his smooth moves.
Conflict arises when a
Southern black girl comes to
town, shaking the foundation
of Bulrusher's sense of self.
This only summarizes
the literal level of the play,
however.

"The whole story is
about coming into your own
identity," Peacock said.
"There's racial identity, sexu
al identity, familial identity
and class identity and I feel
like everyone can relate to
that in some way or another."
Although Peacock had
a bit of acting experience in

high school, this is her first
time playing such a major
role. She has learned that col
lege theater is quite different
from high school theater.
"It's so fast-paced,"
she said. "In high school, we
would spend a week or two
blocking the play. With
'Bulrusher,' we spent a day or

two. Also, there's a lot of
character development that
had to be done on my own
time whereas in high school,
we had a lot more time to
work on that as a group. It
was a completely different
experience." "Even the con
tent is more mature "We
would never do a play like
this in high school," she
added.

Peacock found the
Blackstage Theater Company
by accident and thought it
would be a fun group to be
involved with. Once she read
"Bulrusher," the significance
of her performance became
clear.
"When I first audi
tioned, I had absolutely no
idea what the play was
about," Peacock said. "It was
tough at first not knowing
anything about the characters
or the plot. But after the first
read through of the script, all
of the actors were just like,
'Whoa.' There are so many
unexpected twists and turns
in the story, the relationships
are so complex and there's no
one-dimensional character.
There are so many aspects we
get to explore, which is a lot
of fun."
Isaiah Wooden, a
Stanford graduate student
pursuing his Ph.D. in Drama,
directs "Bulrusher." He came
across the play in Professor
Harry Elam's seminar on
Contemporary African
American Playwrights and
fell in love with the poetic
storytelling. He says the show

is challenging to direct
because it is "both beautiful
and complicated."
Peacock also appreci
ates the challenges that the
play presents.
"When Eisa Davis,
the playwright, writes plays,
she doesn't necessarily write
them with the intention of
being performed," she said.
"She just lets the script come
out however she wants it to,
making it really difficult to
figure out the staging since
she doesn't write it with per
formers and directors in
mind. She just wants to tell
her story, so it's more of a
challenge for us to bring that
to the stage."
Davis' multifaceted
story is an intense task for a
small student theater group,
but Blackstage has clearly
rocked the show and made it
their own.
"This play is for
everyone," Peacock said,
"and I'm not just saying that
to get people to come see it.
Anyone who has ever ques
tioned their own identity,
questioned someone else's
identity, felt like they don't
belong somewhere, met
someone who's affected them
and their sense of self — this
show is for you."
