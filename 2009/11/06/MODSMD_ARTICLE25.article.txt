The 2004 comedy
"Napoleon Dynamite,"
written and directed by
25-year-old Jared Hess, polar
ized audiences, although I felt
only lukewarm toward it. I
was mildly amused, a little
annoyed and not nearly
impressed enough to watch
Jack Black prance in Mexican
wrestler duds for Hess's next
film, 2006's "Nacho Libre,"
which grossed more than
"Dynamite," but didn't
achieve nearly the same buzz
or acclaim. The woman host
ing the screening of
"Gentleman Broncos," Hess's
latest creation, seemed to rec
ognize where Hess's appeal
lay and when she addressed
the audience, asked the ques
tion she knew would get the

crowd revved up: "Who here
is a fan of 'Napoleon
Dynamite?"' A great whoop
ing and clapping there fol
lowed. Then the movie start
ed and we settled into our
seats, curious as to whether
Hess would again deliver the
occasionally hilarious parade
of self-deluded freaks and
grotesque weirdos that he's
made his stock in trade.
He does that's the
short answer. And if you're
just reading this review to
find out whether this movie
was enough like "Napoleon
Dynamite" to be worth see
ing, then yes. In fact, I think
it's even funnier, though with
the same tics and flaws and
the same mannered, anachro
nistic ugly '7os aesthetic that

gave Hess's critics their
ammo the first time around.
The movie involves
Benjamin Purvis (Michael
Angarano), a sweet, home
schooled sci-fi nerd whose
most common expression is
one of brow-furred consterna
tion, attending a science fic
tion camp called Cletus
Festival, where he meets his
idol, the pompous and mam
mary-missile obsessed sci
ence fiction author Dr.
Ronald Chevalier (played to
the hilt by "Flight of the
Concords'" Jemaine
Clement). In a dastardly turn
although one perhaps por
tended by Chevalier's ever
present in-ear bluetooth head
set Chevalier, desperate
after his agent rejects his lat
est book, plagiarizes the man
uscript that Benjamin had
submitted for a contest.
In the mean time,
unknowingly, Benjamin
"sells" the $5OO check he
receives is post-dated for the
following year his movie
to two geeky friends he's met
on the bus ride to Cletus Fest.
They are Tabitha (Jules
Feiffer's daughter, Halley),
whose main traits are over
enthusiasm and a penchant
for writing terrible romance
fiction and Lonnie (Hector

Jimenez), a flamboyant, ugly
sweater-and-turtleneck-wear-

ing amateur movie producer
who either has the most
unpleasant-looking facial
expressions in the world, or is
method acting, having his lips
pried apart by a sadistic den
tal hygienist. Either way his
cavernous, unseemly smile
and his increasingly gay
antics yielded some of the
biggest laughs in the movie,
although I got more than a lit
tle tired of them by the end.
Two other eccentric
beyond-plausibility characters
appear in "Gentleman
Broncos," oozing weirdness
and probable cognitive defi
ciency at every turn. There is
Benjamin's mom, Judith
(Jennifer Coolidge), who
breaks apart coagulated balls
of popcorn and serves them
in milk for dinner and designs
hideous clothing ("This one is
breakfast inspired") amidst
the disorder of her home,
which looks, from the out
side, like a cross between a
geodesic dome and a dog
house. Then there is Dusty
(Mike White), the staring,
white-garbed "Guardian
Angel" whom Benjamin's
mom invites over, whose
curly orange hair hangs
almost as low as the matching
white boa he keeps around
his neck and who functions
mainly to get shat on by his
snake, look priceless in cut-

off shorts and deliver a blow
gun at crucial moments in the
fdm.
The randomness of
Benjamin's novel mirrors the
randomness of the fdm itself,
but Hess seems to have
grown a little since
"Napoleon Dynamite" and
makes some partly successful
attempts to imbue his film
with a bit of heart.
Benjamin's father has died,
he and his mother are poor
and the pain of seeing his
novel mangled in its transla
tion to film by Tabitha and
Lonnie registers authentically
on Benjamin's face. He earns
enough sympathy for us to
want him to come out on top.
That alone is quite an

achievement, although I was
a bit more skeptical of Hess's
intentions toward his charac
ters. Is he laughing with them
or at them? It's still not clear.
But as long as there are
laughs, I'm not quite sure I
care.
