# CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE WORST KIND

Hot off the heels of the
smash-hit blockbuster
"Paranormal
Activity" comes another
"real" footage-based, eerily
authentic horror film. "The
Fourth Kind," in theaters
today, uses "actual" case
studies to argue that alien
abductions are responsible for
the multiple unsolved disap
pearance cases in Nome,
Alaska.
The concept and gim
mick is initially very intrigu
ing. Milla Jovovich, who
plays Dr. Abigail Tyler, opens
the film with a literal intro
duction. She informs the
audience that the movie is
based off of real events and
that what is about to be wit
nessed is very disturbing.
While this style of opening
had us all on the edge of our
seats, it quickly became clear
that this was far too melodra
matic. The following images
weren't so much disturbing as
they were just silly.
The "actual" footage
follows seemingly real-life
hypnotherapist Abigail Tyler,
who is attempting to under-

stand the strange behaviors of
her patients. In a "Ghost
Hunters" or "Unsolved
Mysteries" style, the footage
is overlapped with reenact
ments, resulting in a cheesy
attempt at credibility. Simply
because Jovovich and the
"real doctor" are saying the
same things does not make
the situation accurate.
Beyond the footage
that the movie is based off of,
the rest of the film is com
pletely boring. The panoramic
shots of Alaska are of course
stunning, but that is not
enough to sustain a film that
promises to be exciting.
Jovovich, a supermodel
turned actor, tries her best to
be a convincing, albeit para
noid, widow, but definitely
falls short of the mark. Her
attempts at a breakdown over
losing her child had the audi
ence laughing in disbelief.
For those who enter
the theater as non-believers in
alien abductions, this film
does little to persuade other
wise. In fact, the footage that
is utilized further breeds
skepticism. Much of the audi

ence was captivated by a
scene showing a deranged
abductee holding his family
at gunpoint and then proceed
ing to kill all of them, as well
as himself. While initially
powerful, many began to
realize that the legality of
using actual police footage of
a man killing his family in a
major studio film is highly
questionable. This is where
any and all credibility began
to unravel.
Soon the story
becomes absolutely ludicrous.
What kind of a police officer
would leave a clearly unsta
ble woman alone without
hospitalization or security
after her child disappears?
What kind of doctor would
continue to practice her work
after experiencing a number
of tragic and horrifying
events? It is almost as if the
screenwriters didn't even take
the movie seriously.
While the storyline
itself was full of holes and
unbelievable situations, the
filmmaking itself left some
thing to be desired. Dubbing
the reenactments over the col

lected footage seemed desper
ate, not edgy as intended. The
one truly creepy moment
came when a patient is shown
floating off of his bed for a
millisecond, causing most of
the audience to jump. Instead
of actually showing us alien
abductions, "The Fourth
Kind" simply has characters
sit and tell us what happened,
albeit with some screaming in
between. The film asks the
audience to make up its own
mind about whether or not
abductions did occur, but by
the end of this movie, all any
body was thinking was,
"Who cares?"
