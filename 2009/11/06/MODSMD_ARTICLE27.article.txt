# Remember, remember, the play called "November"

If there was any doubt in the first couple of
minutes that "November," by David
Mamet, is supposed to be a farce, they
were quickly silenced when the President of
the United States (Andrew Hurteau) decided
to extort the representative from the turkey
business (Manoel Felciano) for $2OO million.
The sad thing is the show, a farce that has
loose ties to the Bush administration, occa-

sionally strikes too close to home to be as
funny as normal comedy. While I can only
imagine that President Bush never used extor
tion in exchange for the typical Thanksgiving
tradition of pardoning a turkey, the fact that it
isn't out of the realm of possibility is kind of
a disturbing thought.
Overall, the show was very funny
because it made great pains to make the presi
dent, Charles Smith, his own character
instead of merely a caricature. As 1 said, it is
only loosely based on reality and that works
mostly to its advantage. Smith is a fast-talk
ing, albeit quick-tempered and kind of dim,
sleaze ball who uses his words at any and
every opportunity. Hurteau makes Smith
oddly endearing even as he's spouting lines
that are borderline racist and, usually, just
flat-out profane. His character has huge
amounts of charisma, capturing the audi
ence's attention whenever he speaks. What's
most impressive is that Hurteau is actually
the understudy and he still absolutely domi
nated the role. Part of that is surely the high
caliber of talent that the theater company
attracts to its productions.
The supporting cast was terrific as
well. Each of the actors inhabited their roles
with ease. Felciano was especially wonderful
as the turkey representative. His nasally
voice and uptight mannerisms toed the line of
overdoing it, but he never quite crossed that
border, making his character great to watch

on stage. Probably the one disappointing part
of the cast was Rene Augesen as Smith's
speechwriter, Clarice Bernstein. Her acting
was perfectly fine, but her role was underwrit
ten and left her with little to do other than
fake a cold. Her scenes were also Mamet's
attempt to inject some drama and deeper mes
sage to the show, which didn't quite fit as
well as he probably intended. The show
worked best when it was straight-up farce,
like the turkey plot and Bernstein's scenes
were usually not funny; they kind of fell flat
for the most part.
One of my favorite parts of the show
was the set, designed by Erik Flatmo. Based
on the Oval Office, the set is a bright, flashy
version of the room that lends itself to the
crazy scenarios happening inside. Flatmo
works with the circular nature of the room to
give a more complete version of the Oval
Office than that which is actually presented
on stage. It succeeds and immediately places
the actors and audience in the situation.
As a whole, the show is entertaining
for its brief running time. It, however, is not
destined to be a classic. It is topical and
irreverent like much great farce, but it lets
the action sag too much. The cast does its
best to keep the show light and snappy, but
there are definite stretches where there is not
a laugh to be found. In the end, this only
slightly detracts from the comedic moments,
which are appropriately (or inappropriately,

as they were) outrageous, leading to a climax
that involves blow darts and ancient Chinese
medallions ... in the Oval Office.
