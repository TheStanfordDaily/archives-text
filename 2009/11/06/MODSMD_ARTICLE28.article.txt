## FEST

On the morning of Oct. 25, the
streets of San Francisco present
ed an interesting array of outfits
from sports bra and shorts, to suit
and tie . . . to leather vest, bell bottoms,
headbands and tie-dye? Something
made this morning unique. Amid what
makes up regular city life and normal
apparel was a "blast from the past"
from 40 years ago, to be exact.
Promised to be the largest of
Woodstock's 40th anniversary events,
West Fest did not disappoint. If you are
anything like me, I know what you are
thinking: This sounds like a place for
hippies, druggies and tree huggers.
While that is partially true, the festival
actually offered a whole lot more.
West Fest was a ground for busi
ness. Maybe it was the prominence of
Woodstock or maybe it was just the
general atmosphere of the festival, but
business owners lined up stand after
stand in the middle of San Francisco's
Golden Gate Park to offer their services
at this event. Stands offered anything

from free pens as incentive to sign peti
tions legalizing marijuana all the way to
henna tattoo artists. With so many
options, every person was sure to find a
hidden treasure if they dug down deep
enough. For me, it was a wrap that can

be worn 20
different ways.
For a friend of
mine, it was a
Rastafarian
hat. For most
people, it was
the food.
Surprisingly,
West Fest was
a place for
families.

Considering the excessive amounts of
drug use and constant smell of marijua
na in the air, I can see why my claim
would need some backing up. Like I
said before, I did not expect really any
one but hippies and druggies at the fes
tival, so what I encountered came as a

shock. High school students packed the
park in groups, original Woodstock
attendees (who now were middle-aged
men dressed in what I can only assume
was their uncharacteristic "non-day job"
outfits) filled the audience and families

roamed the park
freely. Parents
clearly appreci
ated the oppor
tunity to go out
somewhere
where their kids
could enjoy
nature and
where they
could listen to
music from
some of their

favorite bands.
In the grand scheme of things,
however, West Fest was an anniversary.
While 1 was there, not only did 1 meet
real musicians but real music lovers,
who unlike the audiences of many of
today's concerts, knew more than just

the artist's one hit song. Those at West
Fest "knew their music" and took the
time to visit both stages of the concert
to celebrate the decades of song that
have really defined our country from
before and after Woodstock.
While the music was great, just
like the original 1969 festival, it was
pretty clear from the start that West Fest
was about something more. The count
less musicians and guest speakers
served to give a public history lesson on
what Woodstock was all about the
promotion of anti-war and green efforts,
and the remembrance of love, peace and
spirituality. A great reminder of the
theme was given toward the end of the
day as one speaker quoted Jimi Flendrix
saying, "When the power of love over
comes the love of power, the world will
finally know peace."
