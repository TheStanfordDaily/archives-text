# Remote Nomad: My ANTM Anthem

Twelve women have
been the illustrious
winners of the dozen
cycles of that impregnable
cultural fortress that is Tyra
Banks' "America's Next Top
Model."
The show, currently
down to the final four con
testants its 13th iteration,
solidified Tyra's insanity and
inferiority long before her
talk show, giving us cultural
phenomena such as
"Fiiierce," "Smile with your
eyes" (recently rebranded as
"Smize"), Nigel Barker and
the Jays, and my lamentation
of choice, "My life as a cover
girl." While CBS likes to
think that franchises such as
"Survivor: 19" are still enjoy
able and culturally relevant, I
can't foresee the end of
"America's Next Top Model."
The show has indeed had to
concede sponsors, judges and
dignity as of late, but I will
argue that it does have more
abstract principles.
First let's examine the
signs of decay. Sponsors and
modeling agencies have real
ized that "Top Model" is not
a quality institution in the
modeling world, unless you
count the few models that go
on from winning ANTM to
walk in runway shows for the
Project Runway season
finale! ANTM winners were
demoted from Elle and Ford
Models to Seventeen

Magazine and Elite Model
Management in Season Seven
and this season Tyra had to
grovel to get Wilhelmina
Models to take the show's
shorties.
As Tyra has become
persona non grata in the fash
ion community with her
transformation into the Jerry
Springer of our generation,
legitimate fashion designers
long ago stopped allowing
her models to visit them for
go-sees or walk in their fash

ion shows. All of this is old
news. While similar trends
have slowed down "Project
Runway" and even "Top
Chef," "Top Model" has man
aged to redefine its usefulness
in the wake of its expulsion
from the garden of hot naked
models.
Another factor is the
TYRA-nny in the creative
and evaluative portions of the
show. Having fired Paulina
Porizkova before this season,
Tyra is the only member of
the panel with legitimate,
independent fashion creden
tials. This season has boasted
some more credible judges
than recent seasons Chanel
Iman and Marisa Miller come
to mind but Tyra is
involved in more challenges
and photo shoots than ever
before. These effects may be
symptomatic of the show's
fall from fashion grace,
although personal conflicts
suggest they are just as much
corollaries of Tyra's ego.
Many were quick to
scoff at the premise of the
13th season petite models
standing in at under 5-foot-7.
Despite her unnecessary
emphasis on the challenges of
petite modeling in the early
episodes, the height issue dis
solved as the season pro
gressed. Tyra didn't call the
final seven the seven dwarves
and the final four contestants
are all very pretty. In theory,
we know it doesn't matter

that these models are short
because no ANTM contestant
goes on to an illustrious run
way career anyway. In prac
tice, Tyra seems to be coming
to terms with this as well,
making the go-sees more
about time than performance
and cozying up to Ann
Shoket. Her gimmick worked
in that it generated curiosity
and intrigue at the beginning
of the season, although ulti
mately the show dropped the
act, eliminated Sundai this
week and recognized that
height doesn't really matter in
photographs.
What lies at the core
of the show is what happens
in the final 15 minutes: artis
tic criticism. When I say
artistic criticism, I don't mean
that we should compare their
photos to real fashion photog
raphy, because that's clearly
not the aesthetic these models
and photographers are achiev
ing. Tyra has chosen a lot of
pretty girls for her show, so
we can appreciate their beau
ty, or lack thereof, in the final
photographs, no matter how
absurd the concept, like last
week's pseudo-blackface
shoot. "Top Chef' survives in
a similar way: In both shows,
we like to watch the creative
process without knowing how
the final product will turn
out. On "Top Model," we
have an even greater ability

to judge that product than on
"Top Chef' because we can
see the photos, but we can't
taste the food. Strategy shows
like Survivor entertain, but
we can't appreciate the
genius or idiocy of their
schemes thanks to editing and
not-so-omniscient fdming.
Top Model functions on our
attachment to the pretty peo
ple, based on beauty, talent,
personality
or some

combination of the three and
our relationship to their "art
work." Tyra may run out of
foreign fashion capitals, but
she'll never run out of beauti
ful girls.
