# EYEING PERFECTION
## Women's soccer finishes regular season against rival Cal 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
Given the nature of their rivalry,
there always seems to be some added
significance when Stanford faces Cal.
However, when the Cardinal women's
soccer team faces the Golden Bears
this weekend, there will be even more

on the line than usual with a victory
(or even a draw), the Card can claim its
first outright conference champi
onship since 2002.
Stanford (19-0-0, 8-0-0 Pac-10) has
already clinched at least a share of the
Pac-10 title, but UCLA could still be
co-champion if the Bruins win and
Stanford loses, leaving both teams with

one conference loss. If the Card wins,
not only will it win the Pac-10 title, but
it will secure the school's first ever un
defeated regular season. While that
would be a significant achievement,
Stanford Head Coach Paul Ratcliffe
knows that it would only be a step to
ward the final goal.
"It's exciting if we can get a perfect

regular season, but you also have to be
hot in the playoffs," Ratcliffe said. "We
want to win a national title, and I think
we'll only be happy if we win the na
tional title."
The Cardinal certainly looks like a
favorite for the national title at the mo
ment. Stanford is the unanimous top
ranked team in the country; it is also
the only school without a single blem
ish on its record. If the team beats Cal,
the wave of momentum that it will ride
into the playoffs will be enormous.
Cal (10-7-1, 4-4-0 Pac-10) is just
starting to gain some momentum back,
sweeping the Arizona teams this past
weekend after losing four in a row cour
tesy of the Washington and Los Angeles
schools. The Bears currently sit sixth in
the Pac-10 table, and while they look
like a good bet to be in the NCAA tour
nament, a win over the nation's No. 1
team certainly wouldn't hurt their
chances heading into the playoffs.
Cal's main threat will likely come
from junior forward Alex Morgan, who
has tallied 12 goals and seven assists
this season put another way, she has
had a hand in 19 of the 31 goals her
team has scored this year. Stopping the
U.S. youth international will be a high
priority for the Cardinal.
"We worry more about our game
plan for us, but Alex Morgan is a good
player and very talented," Ratcliffe said.

NOTES ! No. 1 Stanford looks to cap off a perfect season
when it hosts rival Cal. A win or draw would give Stanford
its first outright Pac-10 title in seven years. No opponent
has gotten within a goal of the Cardinal at Cagan Stadi
um this season, and Stanford defeated Cal 3-0 last year.

Stanford, the only unbeaten and untied team, looks to finish off its perfect season when it takes on Cal this Sunday for
Senior Day. The Cardinal is the unanimous No. 1 team in the nation, and it hopes to finish 20-0 for the regular season.

"We'll have to be aware of her, there's
no doubt about it. But hopefully we
can play our game, keep possession of
the ball and dictate the play."

Stanford was able to hold Mor
gan scoreless last year en route to a
3-0 victory at Cal's Edwards Stadi
um. Of course, the Cardinal backline
was reshaped this year after losing
both of its starting center backs to
graduation, but this year's new-look
defense has improved dramatically
throughout the year.
"The defense has made huge im
provements," Ratcliffe said. "They're
getting more and more confident,
their defending shape is much better
and I think their playmaking out of
the back is getting much better."
The quick adaptation of fresh
men defenders Rachel Quon and
Alina Garciamendez has been key
to Stanford's success, but the leader
ship and play of seniors Ali Riley
and Alicia Jenkins have been per
haps the most crucial factor. The two
will be playing their last regular sea
son home match on Sunday and,
along with forward Kelley O'Hara
and midfielders Kristin Stannard

and Hillary Heath, will be honored
for Senior Day. So even regardless of
the possible conference champi
onship and perfect season, the match
is sure to be one of the most mean
ingful of the year.
"I think it's going to be an emo
tional game," Ratcliffe said. "It's Se-

nior Day, so there's a lot at stake
there. [And there's] the cross-town

rivalry with Cal and [the fact that
it's] a televised game."
"There are a lot of things to play
for, so I hope we can put on a good
performance," he added.
Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m. on
Sunday at Cagan Stadium.
