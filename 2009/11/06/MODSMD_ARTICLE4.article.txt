# RANKINGS RANKLE ADMINS
## Relationship with ranking agencies is marked largely by indifference 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Stanford, confident in its
reputation as an elite universi
ty, never makes a big deal about
college rankings. None of the
promotional material from the
Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission, for example, makes
any mention of U.S. News &
World Report, the best-known
college ranking service.
But behind the noncha
lance, the University has wres
tled for years with the difficult
questions posed by ranking in
stitutions of higher learning.
The number of problems
that Stanford administrators
see with college rankings, in
cluding subjectivity, over-sim
plicity and year-to-year vari
ability, might only be out
weighed by the quantity of
ranking surveys out there. The
University has responded to
these issues by backing away
from rankings in general, but
despite the concerns, Stanford
remains involved with them to
some degree.
Stanford gets "dozens upon
dozens" of information re
quests from college ranking
services each year, according to

Kate Chesley, the University's
associate director of communi
cations. Despite a common
perception that Stanford does
not participate in ranking sur
veys, the University does, in
fact, participate in order to
disseminate information to as
many potential applicants as
possible, officials say.

"Stanford answers U.S.
News and just about every
other survey, regardless of
whether or not they rank, be
cause we want to be of service
to prospective students and
their families," Chesley wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily.
College rankings have
blossomed into a massive in
dustry in the past 20 years.
Each publication, seeking to
differentiate itself, puts a twist
on its grading different cat
egories for schools here, differ
ent weights for admissions and
yield rates there.

U.S. News, for example,
weights 25 percent of its final
rankings based on subjective
"reputational" surveys, in
which officers at different col
leges and universities rank
other schools.
Therein lies one of the main
problems for many at Stanford.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman is in
charge of filling out the reputational
peer evaluation that U.S. News sends
to the Office of the Provost each
year. He does not complete the sur
vey with relish.
"I get this huge list of undergrad
uate institutions," Bravman said.
"About most, I have no personal
knowledge at all, and the rest are
notional at best. I try to be conscien
tious about it, but it's hard to see
where the value-added is from this."
Former University President
Gerhard Casper did not see the
value either.
During his tenure, Casper was at
the front of a campaign against col
lege rankings. Deeming U.S. News
overly subjective and arbitrary,
Casper declined to submit the repu
tational peer evaluation for U.S.
News in 1997, returning only objec
tive data about Stanford that was
also made publicly available on the
University's official Web site.
"Many colleges and universities,
including Stanford, have begun to
consider withdrawing from the
annual U.S. News survey on the
grounds that its methods of ranking
institutions are misleading and inac
curate," Casper said in a statement
that year. "No standardized lists of
'best colleges' can begin to do justice
to what is best for a given student."
Stanford now participates in both
parts, subjective and objective, of the
survey. Bravman marks "not appli
cable" or the U.S. News equivalent
for those schools he feels unable to
rank properly.
But the weight of those subjec
tive surveys, coupled with problems
like ranking different types of col
leges against each other and algo
rithm changes that cause yearly fluc
tuations, causes Bravman "discom
fort."
"How is it possible to capture
everything that Stanford is, and is
not, via a ranking system?" Bravman
asked, adding, "I feel for smaller
schools for which the U.S. News
rankings play a huge role in yield
rates."
James Fallows, currently a nation
al correspondent for The Atlantic
Monthly, was the editor of U.S. News

during Casper's anti-rankings
efforts. Like Casper, he is "not a fan"
of the magazine's system for ranking
colleges, but he thinks there have
been some improvements in the
rankings system, specifically con
cerning what Bravman called unin
formative, "uni-axial" rankings that
pit all schools against each other.
"There simply was and is no
prospect of the magazine abandon
ing its ranking plans," given the pop
ularity of the service, Fallows said in
an e-mail to The Daily. "During the
two years I was at U.S. News, I think
we improved the rankings in a num
ber of ways ... a 'best' colleges rank
ing that ranges from Cal Tech to
Notre Dame to Harvard is like try
ing to [rank] basketball, swimming
and football teams together on the
same list."
Fallows has company from the
Farm in his belief that rankings are
here to stay and that reform is a
more productive option than boy
cott. Rana Glasgal, Stanford's asso
ciate vice provost for institutional
research and decision support, sits
on the U.S. News Advisory
Committee of the Association of
Institutional Research.
"We can rail against it all we
want, but [subjective rankings]
aren't going anywhere," Glasgal
said.
In response, she and institutional
researchers from other colleges
counsel the magazine on what ques
tions it should use in its surveys.
"If they want to change their sur
vey, we serve as a sounding board to
say, 'lf you ask that question, you
might get bad data,"' Glasgal said.
"We try to advise the editors on
what would work and what would
n't."
For the most part, however,
Stanford has responded to the vari
ous problems with college rankings

by backing away from them.
In addition to the admission
office, neither the Law School nor
the Graduate School of Business
publicizes or even comments on its
ranking, according to spokeswomen
from both schools. According to
Chesley, Stanford's inclusion in the
top-10 greenest colleges by
Discovery Communications is one
of the only rankings the University
actually touts.
Gus Horwith 'lO, a Stanford tour
guide, says the issue of college rank
ings never appears in the volumi
nous manual the University's guides
memorize to answer potential ques
tions on their tours. Horwith did
have an idea of how he would
respond if someone asked him about
Stanford's U.S. News ranking,
though.
"I would tell them that I don't
know where we are exactly, that
we're somewhere in the top five, but
that the rankings change each year
and we don't think they matter that
much," he said.
Robert Morse, the director of
data research for U.S. News, said
Stanford's indifferent approach to
college rankings is common among
the nation's elite schools.
"It's certainly typical that schools
near the top are quite dismissive of
the rankings," Morse said. "They
understand their position is secure,
so they can have it both ways and be
critical of the process."
According to Bravman, Stanford
would rather have it no way than
both ways.
"We just do it and we move on,"
he said. "The students who choose to
come here, for them Stanford was
number one, and that's all we care
about."

cations. Despite a common
perception that Stanford does
not participate in ranking sur
veys, the University does, in
fact, participate in order to
disseminate information to as
many potential applicants as
possible, officials say.

"Stanford answers U.S.
News and just about every
other survey, regardless of
whether or not they rank, be
cause we want to be of service
to prospective students and
their families," Chesley wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily.
College rankings have
blossomed into a massive in
dustry in the past 20 years.
Each publication, seeking to
differentiate itself, puts a twist
on its grading different cat
egories for schools here, differ
ent weights for admissions and
yield rates there.

U.S. News, for example,
weights 25 percent of its final
rankings based on subjective
"reputational" surveys, in
which officers at different col
leges and universities rank
other schools.
Therein lies one of the main
problems for many at Stanford.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman is in
charge of filling out the reputational
peer evaluation that U.S. News sends
to the Office of the Provost each
year. He does not complete the sur
vey with relish.
"I get this huge list of undergrad
uate institutions," Bravman said.
"About most, I have no personal
knowledge at all, and the rest are
notional at best. I try to be conscien
tious about it, but it's hard to see
where the value-added is from this."
Former University President
Gerhard Casper did not see the
value either.
During his tenure, Casper was at
the front of a campaign against col
lege rankings. Deeming U.S. News
overly subjective and arbitrary,
Casper declined to submit the repu
tational peer evaluation for U.S.
News in 1997, returning only objec
tive data about Stanford that was
also made publicly available on the
University's official Web site.
"Many colleges and universities,
including Stanford, have begun to
consider withdrawing from the
annual U.S. News survey on the
grounds that its methods of ranking
institutions are misleading and inac
curate," Casper said in a statement
that year. "No standardized lists of
'best colleges' can begin to do justice
to what is best for a given student."
Stanford now participates in both
parts, subjective and objective, of the
survey. Bravman marks "not appli
cable" or the U.S. News equivalent
for those schools he feels unable to
rank properly.
But the weight of those subjec
tive surveys, coupled with problems
like ranking different types of col
leges against each other and algo
rithm changes that cause yearly fluc
tuations, causes Bravman "discom
fort."
"How is it possible to capture
everything that Stanford is, and is
not, via a ranking system?" Bravman
asked, adding, "I feel for smaller
schools for which the U.S. News
rankings play a huge role in yield
rates."
James Fallows, currently a nation
al correspondent for The Atlantic
Monthly, was the editor of U.S. News

during Casper's anti-rankings
efforts. Like Casper, he is "not a fan"
of the magazine's system for ranking
colleges, but he thinks there have
been some improvements in the
rankings system, specifically con
cerning what Bravman called unin
formative, "uni-axial" rankings that
pit all schools against each other.
"There simply was and is no
prospect of the magazine abandon
ing its ranking plans," given the pop
ularity of the service, Fallows said in
an e-mail to The Daily. "During the
two years I was at U.S. News, I think
we improved the rankings in a num
ber of ways ... a 'best' colleges rank
ing that ranges from Cal Tech to
Notre Dame to Harvard is like try
ing to [rank] basketball, swimming
and football teams together on the
same list."
Fallows has company from the
Farm in his belief that rankings are
here to stay and that reform is a
more productive option than boy
cott. Rana Glasgal, Stanford's asso
ciate vice provost for institutional
research and decision support, sits
on the U.S. News Advisory
Committee of the Association of
Institutional Research.
"We can rail against it all we
want, but [subjective rankings]
aren't going anywhere," Glasgal
said.
In response, she and institutional
researchers from other colleges
counsel the magazine on what ques
tions it should use in its surveys.
"If they want to change their sur
vey, we serve as a sounding board to
say, 'lf you ask that question, you
might get bad data,"' Glasgal said.
"We try to advise the editors on
what would work and what would
n't."
For the most part, however,
Stanford has responded to the vari
ous problems with college rankings

by backing away from them.
In addition to the admission
office, neither the Law School nor
the Graduate School of Business
publicizes or even comments on its
ranking, according to spokeswomen
from both schools. According to
Chesley, Stanford's inclusion in the
top-10 greenest colleges by
Discovery Communications is one
of the only rankings the University
actually touts.
Gus Horwith 'lO, a Stanford tour
guide, says the issue of college rank
ings never appears in the volumi
nous manual the University's guides
memorize to answer potential ques
tions on their tours. Horwith did
have an idea of how he would
respond if someone asked him about
Stanford's U.S. News ranking,
though.
"I would tell them that I don't
know where we are exactly, that
we're somewhere in the top five, but
that the rankings change each year
and we don't think they matter that
much," he said.
Robert Morse, the director of
data research for U.S. News, said
Stanford's indifferent approach to
college rankings is common among
the nation's elite schools.
"It's certainly typical that schools
near the top are quite dismissive of
the rankings," Morse said. "They
understand their position is secure,
so they can have it both ways and be
critical of the process."
According to Bravman, Stanford
would rather have it no way than
both ways.
"We just do it and we move on,"
he said. "The students who choose to
come here, for them Stanford was
number one, and that's all we care
about."

Stanford, confident in its
reputation as an elite universi
ty, never makes a big deal about
college rankings. None of the
promotional material from the
Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission, for example, makes
any mention of U.S. News &
World Report, the best-known
college ranking service.
But behind the noncha
lance, the University has wres
tled for years with the difficult
questions posed by ranking in
stitutions of higher learning.
The number of problems
that Stanford administrators
see with college rankings, in
cluding subjectivity, over-sim
plicity and year-to-year vari
ability, might only be out
weighed by the quantity of
ranking surveys out there. The
University has responded to
these issues by backing away
from rankings in general, but
despite the concerns, Stanford
remains involved with them to
some degree.
Stanford gets "dozens upon
dozens" of information re
quests from college ranking
services each year, according to

Kate Chesley, the University's
associate director of communi
cations. Despite a common
perception that Stanford does
not participate in ranking sur
veys, the University does, in
fact, participate in order to
disseminate information to as
many potential applicants as
