# RANKINGS RANKLE ADMINS
## Relationship with ranking agencies is marked largely by indifference 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
Stanford, confident in its
reputation as an elite universi
ty, never makes a big deal about
college rankings. None of the
promotional material from the
Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission, for example, makes
any mention of U.S. News &
World Report, the best-known
college ranking service.
But behind the noncha
lance, the University has wres
tled for years with the difficult
questions posed by ranking in
stitutions of higher learning.
The number of problems
that Stanford administrators
see with college rankings, in
cluding subjectivity, over-sim
plicity and year-to-year vari
ability, might only be out
weighed by the quantity of
ranking surveys out there. The
University has responded to
these issues by backing away
from rankings in general, but
despite the concerns, Stanford
remains involved with them to
some degree.
Stanford gets "dozens upon
dozens" of information re
quests from college ranking
services each year, according to

Kate Chesley, the University's
associate director of communi
cations. Despite a common
perception that Stanford does
not participate in ranking sur
veys, the University does, in
fact, participate in order to
disseminate information to as
many potential applicants as
possible, officials say.

"Stanford answers U.S.
News and just about every
other survey, regardless of
whether or not they rank, be
cause we want to be of service
to prospective students and
their families," Chesley wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily.
College rankings have
blossomed into a massive in
dustry in the past 20 years.
Each publication, seeking to
differentiate itself, puts a twist
on its grading different cat
egories for schools here, differ
ent weights for admissions and
yield rates there.

U.S. News, for example,
weights 25 percent of its final
rankings based on subjective
"reputational" surveys, in
which officers at different col
leges and universities rank
other schools.
