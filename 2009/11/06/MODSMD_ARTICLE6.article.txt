## H1N1 vaccine delayed No timetable for arrival of H1N1 influenza vaccines on campus 
### RYAN MAYFIELD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While HINI influenza vaccines have been
expected on campus for some time officials
had expected the vaccine by late October
Stanford will have to wait a bit longer before
receiving its first shipments.
There have been problems with delivering
the vaccine a nasal spray on campus,
even though it has already been shipped and
administered in communities surrounding the
University.
"Vaden registered with the State of
California to administer HINI vaccine," said
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Flealth
Center. "We have not received a shipment yet."
Despite earlier estimates, officials could not
provide a schedule for when the vaccines
would arrive. With deliveries arriving in other
areas, there has been frustration on campus,
particularly among some Peer Flealth
Educators (PHEs).
"[The distribution of the vaccine] to other
counties or other places over college campuses
[is frustrating], considering the virus hits our
age bracket the hardest and considering we live
in such close quarters," said Julia Feinberg 'll,
PHE for East Florence Moore Hall. "My con
stant worry is that [if] one or two people have
it, it's going to be very difficult to stop it from

spreading."
Despite the delays, there are still hopes to
vaccinate as many members of the student
body as possible, Friedman said. Vaden has said
the vaccine will be offered free of charge.
While the HINI vaccine is developed much
like the seasonal flu vaccine, its distribution has
been hindered by a complicated system of
delivery.
"The delay is compounded by a distribution
system that no one has been able to figure out,"

Friedman said, "resulting in adequate FIINI
vaccine supplies in some locations and non
existent supplies in others."
Deliveries have begun to trickle into the
county, but even these have been difficult to
track, due to direct shipments to providers.
During October, at least 14,000 dosages were
received by Santa Clara County's Public
Health Department; last week, an additional
26,000 doses were delivered to the county.
However, the majority of these were not
kept in the hands of the county, due to short
ages elsewhere.
"Last week, Public Health ... redistributed
22,000 [doses]," said Joy Alexiou, public infor
mation officer for the Santa Clara County
Public Health Department. "Other than Kaiser
[Hospital], no one had vaccines."
The policy of redistribution has been intro
duced to help vaccinate those most at risk and
extend the value of limited supplies. More
doses from the state are expected shortly in an
unknown number, and additional shipments
are being made weekly. However, these will
most likely be limited and will not necessarily
come to Stanford.

"We haven't gotten much information,"
Friedman said. "It has been very frustrating."
