## Misdiagnosed: Student ordeals at Vaden 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
For one senior, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity due to the sensitivity of her ill
ness, a narrowly avoided misdiagnosis made by
Vaden Health Center could have been serious.
During her freshman year, she was told she had
pink eye by Vaden doctors and was given med
icine to treat it.

"I started using the medicine that afternoon
and night, as was recommended, and woke up
the next morning with my eye even worse than
before," she wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "I
went back to Vaden and they sent me to the
E.R., where it turned out I had something
much, much more serious."
After a CAT scan, the student was immedi
ately put on antibiotics to prevent her from
going blind.
"There was a pretty big pink eye problem
going around when I went in, and I think they
were a little too quick with my diagnosis and
just assumed it was pink eye," she said.
While she trusts Vaden for most things, espe
cially in their decision to send her to the emer
gency room, she claims she was "definitely
almost greatly wronged by them."
As the closest health center on campus, stu
dents rely heavily on Vaden to diagnose and
treat their illnesses. However, Vaden is not
always correct in their diagnoses, yielding con
fusing and sometimes dangerous medical
situations in many cases.
Ranging from incorrect assumptions of

irregular herpes to mistaking menstrual cramps
for a pulled groin, students have experienced a
wide range of medical blunders.
Vaden Director Dr. Ira Friedman, however,
maintains that the hospital's diagnostic accura
cy is "actually quite good," according to their
standards.

A number of students have reported Vaden
missing the serious viral infection mononucleo
sis ("mono"), being told by doctors that they
had less serious medical problems. Due to their
illnesses, most students spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
"Last spring, I went in with super puffy eyes
and they [Vaden] told me I just had allergies ..
. it didn't go away, so I went back and had them
do a blood test," wrote one male sophomore in
an e-mail to The Daily.

The student was never told that mononucle
osis was even a possibility. According to him,
the doctors seemed genuinely surprised when
the results came in.
"Another doctor whom I talked to said the
puffiness was a telltale sign of mono and that
they should have caught it on my first visit," he
said. "[l] definitely wouldn't use Vaden in the
future if I can avoid it."
"Last year I had a really bad cough, so I went
into Vaden and they prescribed me [codeine]
cough syrup," wrote another sophomore in an
e-mail to The Daily. "After a week of it not
going away, even with the [codeine], I went to
sports med and they did blood tests and found
out I had mono."
Friedman pointed out that some diseases,

such as mononucleosis, are known among med
icine to be "great masqueraders," often proving
easy to miss or sometimes resulting in a delayed
diagnosis.
"We have seen thousands of 'mono' cases at
Vaden over the years, so we are alert to this
problem," the director wrote in an e-mail to the
Daily. "If 'mono' shows up with a typical pattern
of signs and symptoms, the diagnosis is simple.
"But it can look exactly like many other con
ditions, especially early on," he continued. "The
remedy is patience and persistence on the part
of both patient and clinician."
Students have also experienced misdiag
noses on a number of other ailments. Ryan Mac
'll, a news editor at The Daily, thought he had
dislocated his shoulder last month and visited
Vaden at 5:05 p.m. to have it examined. But,
because the facility closed at 5 p.m., he was
given a bag of Tylenol as a temporary painkiller
and sent to the E.R.
"I went to the emergency room and they
[Vaden] called in a panic saying, 'Don't take the
medicine we gave you,"' Mac said. "Instead of
giving me Tylenol, they gave me a bag of
Benadryl."
One Stanford alumna who graduated last
year experienced a misdiagnosis scare when
Vaden workers assumed she had irregular her
pes during her junior year.
"I went to Vaden and they seemed to really
be looking hard for an STD," she said.
"I told them that I didn't think that was very

Vaden has been criticized by students for a number of misdiagnoses in recent years. Some students believe doctors completely missed signs of mononucleosis,
while others were given the wrong treatments for ailments. Officials at Vaden maintain that diagnosis accuracy is "actually quite good."
