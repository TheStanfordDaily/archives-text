# FACULTY SENATE
## Powers briefs Senate on Univ. endowment Faculty also discuss sustainable energy plans 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Since the announcement two
months ago of a nearly 26 percent
decline in the University endowment,
Stanford Management Company
(SMC) CEO John Powers, who also
manages the majority of Stanford's
$12.2 billion endowment, has been
fielding questions regarding the state of
the endowment and the prospects of
recovery. Thursday, he explained the
endowment investment situation once
again, this time to a different audience:
the Faculty Senate.
Powers summarized the workings of
the SMC and the endowment results of
the past year, and addressed a number
of potential concerns regarding the per
formance and management of the
endowment.

"We are a fund of funds," Powers
said. "We don't pick stocks; we pick
managers who run portfolios for us."

He said the investment model the
University had been following, which
capitalized partially on illiquid assets to
achieve higher returns, provided better
returns than most equity indexes and
the 10-year Treasury over the long
term.

However, part of the liquidity risk of
investing in higher-returning illiquid
assets is the uncertain timing of capital
calls the legal right of an investment
firm to demand a portion of the money
promised to it by an investor.
"When you commit to a private
equity manager say you commit
$lOO that money gets drawn over
time," Powers said. "You may have put
in $25, but you still have the obligation
of satisfying the remaining $75, and that
may be called anytime. It's a tricky lia
bility because we don't know when it'll
be called."

Powers, however, dismissed some
media reports that have interpreted
Stanford's exploration of an illiquid
assets sale to mean the University does

not have adequate liquidity or cash;
Powers assured that the University had
ample liquidity reserves and was
exploring the option from a position of
strength, "not [as] a distressed seller."
When questioned about the underly
ing goal of the endowment managers,
Powers replied that it was to achieve
the best and highest returns on the
endowment at tolerable levels of risk.

"Excellence is a luxury; you have to
pay for it," Powers said, explaining that
the endowment is meant to maintain
the long-term purchasing power of the
University and has to balance today's
spending and endowment payout with
investment for tomorrow.

Powers also recognizes the obstacles
that remain ahead, saying that "climb
ing up the hill is not as easy as sliding
down the hill," as an endowment
decline of 26 percent would require
returns to be up 33 percent before
breaking even. Echoing Provost John
Etchemendy's comments at a Faculty
Senate meeting last month. Powers said
the University will be taking a sober
approach to endowment growth and
will not expect an immediate recovery.

Sustainable Energy
Sustainability and Energy
Management Director Joseph Stagner
presented a report on the energy con
sumption situation at the University,
addressed the increasing demand for
energy and water, and explained poten
tial long-term energy strategies, which
he called "the perfect storm."
Currently, most of Stanford campus'
energy is supplied by the co-genera
tional plant Cardinal Cogen, whose
contract expires in 2015.
The current energy plan is fueled all
by natural gas, which is expected to start
rising rapidly in price and take up more
of the operating budget. It also has a
high carbon cost.
Stagner also mentioned water as an
issue. Although Stanford continues to
pursue water conservation, it is estimat
ed that in 20 years, water requirements
may start exceeding allocations.
