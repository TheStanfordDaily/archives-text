# STUDENT HOUSING
## Access limited for handicapped 
### VIVIANA ARCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford has a reputation for a
progressive mindset, both inside and
outside the classroom. Yet, in a sig
nificant number of cases, this school
of thought has failed students with
disabilities, a visible minority group
on campus.

While academic buildings are
required by the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 to be acces
sible to disabled students, some loca
tions have been less than accommo
dating for disabled students
among them, some dorms. Nicole
Torcolini 'l2, a blind student in
Branner, has often had trouble navi
gating the layout of the place she
calls home. She's had particular
trouble with dorm access and dou
ble doors.

"Only one door can be opened
from the outside sometimes, and
sometimes it is the left door rather
than the right door," Torcolini said.
"This is problematic for two main
reasons. First, it encourages people .
.. not following the usual pattern of
traffic of traveling on the right, caus
ing more confusion. Second, doors
opening on the left do not work well
for my guide dog."
While the indoor layout has been
frustrating for disabled students like
Torcolini, the outside environment
hasn't been kind either.

"Sometimes the only way to get
somewhere requires walking in or
across a bike lane, which can be
rather dangerous, particularly for
my guide dog," Torcolini said.
"Furthermore, I have found that
most bikers do not take precautions
to watch for pedestrians."
Student ignorance toward dis
abled students' needs has also made
traveling from one place to another
a liability.
"People either leave their bikes
unlocked in the middle of the path
way or locked to inappropriate
structures all over campus,"
Torcolini said. "I believe that this is
done because there is not a bike
rack within proximity, or the closest
bike rack is for another purpose."
When taking her complaints to
her fellow dorm mates, Torcolini
found little support.
"One of the [Resident Fellows
(RFs)] has sent out repeated e
mails, but to no avail," Torcolini said.
"He has decided to take more seri
ous steps and has contacted P&TS
[Parking & Transportation Services]
to deal with the individuals who per
sist in causing problems with the
bikes."

Clyde Moneyhun, an RF in
Branner Hall, considers Branner
"almost as accessible as it can get,"
but also acknowledges Torcolini's
struggles.
"The trouble is that it takes only
one thoughtless act one bike left
in front of the stairs, one big empty

box left in a hallway, one couch left
in the walkway in the lounge to
create accessibility problems,"
Moneyhun said. "What we need is
more diligence on the part of all the
residents in making sure that every
body who lives here has equal access
to all parts of the building."
Accessibility in off-central cam
pus residences doesn't fare very well
either. Graduate student Erik
Corona is affected by the lack of
access his disabled girlfriend Stacy
Bennett, a Stanford alumna, has at
the couple's housing on Hoskins
Court.

"We were told we were getting a
wheelchair-accessible apartment,"
Corona said. "Unfortunately, it must
have been built a long time ago
because accessibility remains
extremely low."
Corona's housing has a number
of inaccessible features, including
both on the outside and inside of the
apartment.

"There are stairs leading to the
lobby. We did not find this out until
the day we moved in, as nobody
bothered to tell us," Corona said.
"This means that my girlfriend can
never participate in the events ...
taking place in the lobby, watch TV
there or even get the mail."
Bennett's struggle with the hous
ing's inaccessibility has forced her to
leave scratch marks on the wall with
her wheelchair and has left her
unable to situate her powerchair in
the apartment's bathroom, which
Housing assured the couple would
be accessible.

"The bathroom is tiny and the
door won't even shut with her
power wheelchair in there," Corona
said. "This creates a very problemat
ic situation when we have guests
involving her having to wait to use
the bathroom or having people tem
porarily leave the apartment when
she simply cannot wait."
The University's assurances of
these accessible apartments have
left Corona and Bennett feeling
more than a bit deceived.

"There are problems around
campus as well, but we did at least
expect it to be accessible where we
have to live and spend the majority
of our time," Corona said.
Further grievance of their hous
ing situation has not been helped by
an employee in Corona and
Bennett's housing complex, who has
allegedly repeatedly refused many
of their most basic accessibility
needs.

"This one individual, who was
not nice, has been very reluctant to
do even minor modifications to our
apartment, like moving grip bars in
the bathroom so my girlfriend can
use the restroom and shower on her
own," Corona said. "She has com
plained that we require too much
and that my girlfriend would just
have to wait for modifications she
needed to even leave the apartment

in case of a fire."
Yet, disabled students have not
let the accessibility issues hinder
their ability to organize and voice
their opinions. Recently, the ASSU
created the Disabilities and
Accessible Education Committee to
discuss the needs of handicapped
students.
"We are trying to make disability
resources more cohesive for stu
dents so that campus is easier to
access," said committee Co-chair
Julia Feinberg, a disabled student
with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. "We
are also trying for more contact with
Housing and Admission."
Housing, on the other hand,
maintains that it has remained com
mitted to meeting disabled students'
needs, according to Executive
Director of Student Housing
Rodger Whitney.
"Student Housing has been pro
viding accessible living accommoda
tions for many years and certainly
following the adoption of the
Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) in 1990," Whitney said. "One
major effort in this regard is Student
Housing's multi-million dollar
Capital Improvement Program
(CIP), which just completed its 17th
year of renovations to our resi
dences renovations that have
touched almost every student hous
ing facility during this time."
Efforts through the CIP include
ensuring adequate access to build
ings as well as to all common areas
such as lounges, computer clusters
and laundry rooms. It is also dedicat
ed to ensuring that students have
the capability to properly maneuver
these spaces. According to Whitney,
many of these efforts are done
through cooperation between his
office and groups on campus sup
porting disabled students.
"We also hold meetings every
year to customize student assign
ments and make sure that students
have the technology and living situ
ations they require to be successful
at Stanford," Whitney said.
Yet, Whitney found that many of
the conflicts encountered by dis
abled students were due to their fail
ure to disclose details of their condi
tion before coming to Stanford, thus
leading to delays in building neces
sary appliances.
"We find we are making last
minute building modifications to
meet these new needs, even though
we may have the necessary elements
elsewhere, but the rooms have
already been assigned," Whitney
said. "Also, even when a building
does meet ADA requirements, stu
dents sometimes discover that they
have additional needs after they
move in. When they share these con
cerns with us, we work together to
resolve them."

unlocked in the middle of the path
way or locked to inappropriate
structures all over campus,"
Torcolini said. "I believe that this is
done because there is not a bike
rack within proximity, or the closest
bike rack is for another purpose."
When taking her complaints to
her fellow dorm mates, Torcolini
found little support.
"One of the [Resident Fellows
(RFs)] has sent out repeated e
mails, but to no avail," Torcolini said.
"He has decided to take more seri
ous steps and has contacted P&TS
[Parking & Transportation Services]
to deal with the individuals who per
sist in causing problems with the
bikes."

Clyde Moneyhun, an RF in
Branner Hall, considers Branner
"almost as accessible as it can get,"
but also acknowledges Torcolini's
struggles.
"The trouble is that it takes only
one thoughtless act one bike left
in front of the stairs, one big empty

box left in a hallway, one couch left
in the walkway in the lounge to
create accessibility problems,"
Moneyhun said. "What we need is
more diligence on the part of all the
residents in making sure that every
body who lives here has equal access
to all parts of the building."
Accessibility in off-central cam
pus residences doesn't fare very well
either. Graduate student Erik
Corona is affected by the lack of
access his disabled girlfriend Stacy
Bennett, a Stanford alumna, has at
the couple's housing on Hoskins
Court.

"We were told we were getting a
wheelchair-accessible apartment,"
Corona said. "Unfortunately, it must
have been built a long time ago
because accessibility remains
extremely low."
Corona's housing has a number
of inaccessible features, including
both on the outside and inside of the
apartment.

"There are stairs leading to the
lobby. We did not find this out until
the day we moved in, as nobody
bothered to tell us," Corona said.
"This means that my girlfriend can
never participate in the events ...
taking place in the lobby, watch TV
there or even get the mail."
Bennett's struggle with the hous
ing's inaccessibility has forced her to
leave scratch marks on the wall with
her wheelchair and has left her
unable to situate her powerchair in
the apartment's bathroom, which
Housing assured the couple would
be accessible.

"The bathroom is tiny and the
door won't even shut with her
power wheelchair in there," Corona
said. "This creates a very problemat
ic situation when we have guests
involving her having to wait to use
the bathroom or having people tem
porarily leave the apartment when
she simply cannot wait."
The University's assurances of
these accessible apartments have
left Corona and Bennett feeling
more than a bit deceived.

"There are problems around
campus as well, but we did at least
expect it to be accessible where we
have to live and spend the majority
of our time," Corona said.
Further grievance of their hous
ing situation has not been helped by
an employee in Corona and
Bennett's housing complex, who has
allegedly repeatedly refused many
of their most basic accessibility
needs.

"This one individual, who was
not nice, has been very reluctant to
do even minor modifications to our
apartment, like moving grip bars in
the bathroom so my girlfriend can
use the restroom and shower on her
own," Corona said. "She has com
plained that we require too much
and that my girlfriend would just
have to wait for modifications she
needed to even leave the apartment

in case of a fire."
Yet, disabled students have not
let the accessibility issues hinder
their ability to organize and voice
their opinions. Recently, the ASSU
created the Disabilities and
Accessible Education Committee to
discuss the needs of handicapped
students.
"We are trying to make disability
resources more cohesive for stu
dents so that campus is easier to
access," said committee Co-chair
Julia Feinberg, a disabled student
with Spinal Muscular Atrophy. "We
are also trying for more contact with
Housing and Admission."
Housing, on the other hand,
maintains that it has remained com
mitted to meeting disabled students'
needs, according to Executive
Director of Student Housing
Rodger Whitney.
"Student Housing has been pro
viding accessible living accommoda
tions for many years and certainly
following the adoption of the
Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) in 1990," Whitney said. "One
major effort in this regard is Student
Housing's multi-million dollar
Capital Improvement Program
(CIP), which just completed its 17th
year of renovations to our resi
dences renovations that have
touched almost every student hous
ing facility during this time."
Efforts through the CIP include
ensuring adequate access to build
ings as well as to all common areas
such as lounges, computer clusters
and laundry rooms. It is also dedicat
ed to ensuring that students have
the capability to properly maneuver
these spaces. According to Whitney,
many of these efforts are done
through cooperation between his
office and groups on campus sup
porting disabled students.
"We also hold meetings every
year to customize student assign
ments and make sure that students
have the technology and living situ
ations they require to be successful
at Stanford," Whitney said.
Yet, Whitney found that many of
the conflicts encountered by dis
abled students were due to their fail
ure to disclose details of their condi
tion before coming to Stanford, thus
leading to delays in building neces
sary appliances.
"We find we are making last
minute building modifications to
meet these new needs, even though
we may have the necessary elements
elsewhere, but the rooms have
already been assigned," Whitney
said. "Also, even when a building
does meet ADA requirements, stu
dents sometimes discover that they
have additional needs after they
move in. When they share these con
cerns with us, we work together to
resolve them."

Stanford has a reputation for a
progressive mindset, both inside and
outside the classroom. Yet, in a sig
nificant number of cases, this school
of thought has failed students with
disabilities, a visible minority group
on campus.

While academic buildings are
required by the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 to be acces
sible to disabled students, some loca
tions have been less than accommo
dating for disabled students
among them, some dorms. Nicole
Torcolini 'l2, a blind student in
Branner, has often had trouble navi
gating the layout of the place she
calls home. She's had particular
trouble with dorm access and dou
ble doors.

"Only one door can be opened
from the outside sometimes, and
sometimes it is the left door rather
than the right door," Torcolini said.
"This is problematic for two main
reasons. First, it encourages people .
.. not following the usual pattern of
traffic of traveling on the right, caus
ing more confusion. Second, doors
opening on the left do not work well
for my guide dog."
While the indoor layout has been
frustrating for disabled students like
Torcolini, the outside environment
hasn't been kind either.

"Sometimes the only way to get
somewhere requires walking in or
across a bike lane, which can be
rather dangerous, particularly for
my guide dog," Torcolini said.
"Furthermore, I have found that
most bikers do not take precautions
to watch for pedestrians."
Student ignorance toward dis
abled students' needs has also made
traveling from one place to another
a liability.
"People either leave their bikes
unlocked in the middle of the path
way or locked to inappropriate
structures all over campus,"
Torcolini said. "I believe that this is
done because there is not a bike
rack within proximity, or the closest
bike rack is for another purpose."
