# TONIGHT'S SPECIAL: DINNER AND A COSTUME
##

William Thackeray said that
dinner was made for eat
ing, not talking. Clearly
Thackeray hadn't been to
a Special Dinner at
Stanford.
"[Special Dinners began] largely as an
opportunity for chefs to showcase their
culinary abilities in a manner more inter
esting or challenging than usual," said
Row Associate Director Nate Boswell.
But the tradition soon became about
much more than a meal it became a
glorified social-calendar worthy event.
Special Dinners are now a Stanford tra

dition where chefs pull out all the stops
and whip up gourmet dishes in a themed
dinner party for most non-freshmen stu
dents. Special Dinners put on by Row
Houses are held in the house, usually on a
weekend night, and feature interesting
gourmet foods prepared by the house's
own chef, accompanied by a theme.
From the biblical Noah's Ark theme at
Jerry last year to the naughtier Playbob
Mansion at Bob, houses are decorated
wall-to-wall and residents dine in full cos
tume.
"They're the successor to hall dinners
in freshman dorms," said Chris Lowman
'lO, the social manager for 717, a house on
the Row that hosts a Special Dinner every
quarter. "The dinners are a chance for res
idents to bond and get to know each other

and dress up."
Special Dinners were first put on in the
eating clubs of Toyon and Suites, Boswell
said. And they have become a part of the
unique residential culture of Stanford.
"Since the student-managed houses
and kitchens at Stanford are fairly unique,
I imagine so too are the Special Dinners,"
Boswell said.

"It's the adult version of dress-up," said
Elise Lopez 'lO, who has lived in Jerry and
Bob. She said that students' commitment
to their themed costumes has produced
some incredibly creative and elaborate
results.

"We have a picture of people on the
fire escape at Slav dressed as the seven
plagues of Egypt," Lowman remembered
about the Ancient Civilization-themed
dinner in Slavianskii Dom.

But for others, the in-house cama
raderie that Special Dinners afford is what
makes the tradition worthwhile.

"It's house bonding over good food
and liquor," said Maggie Anchondo 'lO, a
Row resident. An advantage to living on
the Row is that alcohol is allowed in the
dorms for students over 21. Houses use
Special Dinner as an opportunity to offer
their residents mixed beverages on the
house.

The exact nature of Special Dinner dif-

fers amongst houses. For many Row hous
es, the fall and winter quarter dinners are
only for in-house residents. In the spring,
students are allowed to bring a date to
Special Dinner.

Some houses like 717 have their own

traditions to accompany Special Dinner.
"For the fall dinner, residents are
matched with a date and they dress up in
pairs," Lowman explained. The social
manager picks the pairs and informs resi
dents of their partner a few weeks prior to
Special dinner.

"It was another staff member who was
also on [7l7] staff last year that told me
about the tradition," he added.

True to the purpose of kinship and rev
elry, other organizations have hopped
onto the Special Dinner bandwagon and
incorporated the uniquely-Stanford tradi
tion into their event calendars. Many of
the un-housed fraternities and sororities
hold Special Dinners Chi Omega had a
"PsyChiOdelyic" '7os-themed dinner last
weekend.

"We do it for group bonding, to cele
brate the people we like being around, and
eat good food," said Claire Menke 'lO, the
social director for Chi Omega.
So, after you go steam tunneling, and
before you graduate, eat dinner in cos
tume. Whether it's at a Haus Mittle Ages
dinner or a Speakeasy at ZAP, Special
Dinner is a tradition at Stanford that
everyone should get a taste of.
