## CCSRE announces new director 
### BRIANNA PANG 
The Center for Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity (CCSRE) has named Elizabeth Wahl Ph.D.
'96 as its new executive director.

Started in f996, the CCSRE provides opportunities
for research and teaching related to race and ethnic
issues across campus. It also houses the undergraduate
program in comparative studies in race and ethnicity
(CSRE), the program in African & African American
studies and a dedicated research division.

"It really is a unique place on campus in terms of its
support for interdisciplinary work," wrote Emily Ryo,
a CCSRE fellow and a doctoral candidate in sociolo
gy, in an e-mail to The Daily.

Wahl worked extensively within the Stanford com
munity before being selected for the position. Except
for a two-year teaching stint at New Mexico
University, Wahl has been at Stanford since 1996, when
she earned her Ph.D. in comparative literature.
For five years, Wahl served as a visiting scholar and
lecturer, and was then named Associate Director of
the Stanford Humanities Center, a post she held until
2006.

When asked about the direction that CCSRE is
heading, Wahl excitedly outlined her plans for several
new projects.

Some highlights include plans to create a more
comfortable atmosphere for student mothers writing
dissertations, research writing workshops for students
to get feedback on their dissertations and future
careers and open talks and panels between faculty and
students about race and ethnicity issues.
However, Wahl's main interest remains developing
the teaching component of the center.
"The Center offered some amazing courses on
Katrina and on Presidential Politics that were open
not only to Stanford students but also to the public,"
Wahl said. "As funding becomes available, I definitely
want to see if we can offer these kinds of topical class
es again in conjunction with Continuing Studies.
"1 want more outreach to the faculty new facul
ty are hired, but I want to bring back faculty who
aren't as involved anymore too," Wahl added.
Wahl also has plans to develop the Center's pres
ence both on- and off-campus.

"I am very interested in raising the profile of the
Center within the Stanford community and surround
ing communities in the Bay Area," Wahl said. "1 also
want to see if we can extend service learning opportu
nities to Stanford students generally and to alumni
who want to participate."

Traditionally, CCSRE has strongly developed its
research component, an aspect its fellows appreciate.
"These programs are important because in society,
you have people of different races interacting," said
Luis Poza, a first-year doctoral candidate in education
al linguistics. "It's important to acknowledge what dif
ferences are present, and examine how they affect our
daily lives."

However, Wahl seeks to strengthen the teaching
and service learning components as well.
"I want to increase the strength of the fellowships
offered here at CCSRE," Wahl said. "I want to bridge
the research side and the undergraduate side [of] the
program."

CCSRE Service Learning Director Tania Mitchell
plans to work with Wahl in developing the community
outreach of CCSRE.

"The community experience is an additional text,"
Mitchell said. "You can learn a lot about immigration
in books, but you can also add to this experience to
enrich [students'] thinking of the issue."
An ongoing project of CCSRE has been the
Faculty Development Initiative, which aims to hire a
more diverse faculty, from all different backgrounds,
and is another focus for Wahl.

"This effort is to expose students to thinking about
race and ethnicity, even if they aren't necessarily
choosing classes specifically in CSRE," Wahl said. "We
have underrepresentation issues and pipeline issues,
and it's really important for students who come to
Stanford to see people of color in different positions."
Rather than just pushing diversity for diversity's
sake, Wahl believed faculty diversity is necessary to
give students a positive example.

"It's to make sure that they're not just paying lip
service to diversity," Wahl said, "and to show that
diverse faculty are actually out there in the different
schools and departments."
