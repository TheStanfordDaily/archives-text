## Health conference supports pre-med minority students 
### JOSEPH LEVENSON 
Applying to medical school is daunting to all students,
but it may be even more so to students from minority
backgrounds. This is recognized by the Stanford chapter of
Chicanos in Health Education (CHE), who hosted the
17th annual Dia de Los Muertos Pre-Health Conference
on Saturday.

"[Medical school is] frightening because there is a large
applicant pool, and it makes people feel that the odds are
against them," said Ulysses Rosas 'lO, who co-organized
the event with Lucy Martinez 'll.

The goal of the event was to supply pre-medical and
pre-health students of minority groups with information
about the application processes for medical school, public
health school and dental school.

"We want to get info out there to traditionally under
represented students and give them the resources to take
their undergraduate education and translate that into a
career in medicine," said Mariana Barraza 'l2, a member
of CHE.

The conference included medical school admission
workshops, anatomy lab demonstrations, a financial aid
workshop and motivational speakers. Pre-medical and pre
health students of color also had an opportunity to meet
each other, share ideas and motivate each other to work
hard and keep pursuing their goals.

The keynote speaker of the conference was Dr. Roland
Torres, chief of neurosurgery at Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center. He gave the audience of about 200 insight into his
difficult path to becoming a doctor.

Torres was born and raised in Lima, Peru, until the age
of 6. He then moved to Brooklyn, New York, because his
father saw greater opportunities in America.
The first year of school in the United States was a diffi
cult trial for Torres because of the formidable language bar
rier. Resolute and determined, he learned English by
watching television shows, specifically "The Three Stooges."
"I never adopted the victim's mentality," he said.
Torres soon gravitated toward reading books in his free
time outside of class.

"As I began to read between the covers of those
books, I could be anybody, I could do anything," he told
the audience.

It is with this strong self-belief that Torres imagined he
could one day be a doctor. He affirms that the "yes, I can"
mentality is critical to fomenting belief in the Latino pop
ulation that they can become doctors.
He ended his presentation with an inspiring yet sober
ing message. "I'm sure that there are a lot of guys out there
that are smarter than me. So, I just worked even harder to
keep up with them," he said.

While Torres gave a personal look into his path to med
ical school, Arturo R. Herrera, an M.D. admission coun
selor for Stanford University School of Medicine, painted
a picture of the medical school application process.
Herrera prefaced his presentation by saying that,
"although MCAT test scores are important, we look at
that in the context of your profile."
The audience was also presented with a breakdown of
the percentage of U.S. medical school applicants by race
and ethnicity.

The current demographic of medical schools in the
United States is 57.07 percent white, 19.8 percent Asian,
7.4 percent black or African American, and 7.1 percent
Hispanic Latino. This highlighted the disparity that cur
rently exists for Latinos in health professions.
Herrera's final note in the presentation was about how
applicants should talk not only about the road they trav
eled to get to the point of applying to medical school, but
also about the distance.

"We must get a sense of where you came from the
obstacles you've overcome and those early experiences
should be put in context to where you are now: your volun
teer experience, your academic strength, etcetera" he said.
