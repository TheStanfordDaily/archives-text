## Free shuttle gets facelift New Marguerite management changes internal operations 
### SAMANTHA LASAROW 
The Marguerite shuttle service will under
go changes in driver training and supervision
as part of a switch in management to Veolia
Transportation.

Stanford Parking and Transportation
Services (P&TS) is not expecting noticeable
expansions for the Marguerite fleet in the
near future, but is anticipating internal opera
tion changes due to the change in service
provider.

When its contract with SFO Shuttle Bus
Company expired, P&TS searched for an
operations vendor that could provide the
Marguerite service at the most reasonable
price. Regional Vice President of Veolia
Transportation Ron Bushman announced the
three-year contract and optional one-year
extension on Sept. 30. Veolia Transportation is
"the largest private provider of multiple
modes of transportation in North America,"
according to its Web site.

PT&S Director Brodie Hamilton said
internal operation changes are in the works.
However, "not much will be noticed by the
riders," he added.

Some of the behind-the-scenes changes
that Hamilton has already seen implemented
include new uniforms for drivers and more
full-time shifts. Drivers are also now expected
to take on multiple routes per week, rather
than a single route as in the past.
Veolia Transportation Director of
Corporate Communications Valerie Michael
explained that other changes "should impact
the riding experience of the passengers."
Efforts towards further improvements
include a four-hour class, known as "Going for
Green," for drivers. These classes are expect
ed to improve customer service and to cut
down on potentially stressful situations.
"Our divisions that have gone through the
'Going for Green' training experienced dras

tic improvements in customer service almost
immediately," Michael said.

Hamilton mentioned that Veolia is also
helping P&TS reduce its carbon footprint by
implementing a procedure to significantly
reduce the time the buses spend idling at the
beginning of each business day.
Furthermore, Veolia trained all drivers in
the operation of hybrid vehicles earlier this
year when two new hybrid buses were added
to the fleet, as previously reported in The
Daily. No additional hybrid buses have been
ordered yet, but the company hopes to phase
out older buses with hybrids in the future.
"We will purchase additional hybrids in a
few years when some of the older buses reach
the point where replacement is necessary,"
Hamilton said.

In the meantime, Veolia will rely on pre
ventative maintenance for its vehicles. A
reserve fleet is also available if more buses
become needed.

"We are regularly monitoring the
Marguerite ridership levels, especially during
the peak commute times," Hamilton said. "If
additional buses are needed during peak
times to meet increases in Caltrain ridership,
buses will be added from our reserve fleet."

Another goal for Veolia is to have a larger
contingency of road supervisors out at a single
time. These supervisors will assist both drivers
and passengers by checking on system opera
tion in the field.

"Those passengers taking Caltrain in the
morning have seen our supervisors, as well as
the general manager, aligning the buses and
making sure the proper signage is displayed
for easy boarding," Michael said.
The Marguerite serves approximately
140,000 passengers per month (close to 6,000
per weekday) with 43 buses making up the
fleet.

Speaking about Veolia in an e-mail to The
Daily, Bushman said that through the compa
ny's partnership with PT&S, "we've been able
to provide an increased level of service that is
safe and efficient and consumer-friendly."
