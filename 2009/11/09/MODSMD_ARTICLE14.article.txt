## EDITORIAL Extend energy incentives to student residences 
### 
By unveiling a vast $250 million Energy
and Climate Plan, Stanford has
demonstrated a firm commitment to
sniffing out any way possible to reduce its
carbon footprint. The path mapped out by
the Sustainability and Energy Management
Department includes such complex actions
as altering the power grid and using excess
heat from cooling certain buildings to heat
others simultaneously. With a 173-page plan
detailing its remarkably meticulous plan
ning, it seems as though the University has
thought of everything.
The Editorial Board has one more sug
gestion: away to incentivize energy conser
vation in dorms. Allowing students or dorm
communities to keep a share of the money
they save from reducing energy use would
be a powerful new tool to curb wasteful be
haviors.

versity is faced with the bills. In economics,
this situation constitutes a textbook example
of the "tragedy of the commons." The effects
of this imbalance are plainly evident all over
campus lights left on in empty rooms, un
used appliances needlessly plugged in and
various other forms of waste continue freely
and, more importantly, without notice. If stu
dents, like academic departments, were paid
to end these habits, we have no doubt they
would stop.
To keep the plan politically feasible, we
recommend keeping only the positive half of
the incentives allowing students to keep
some of the savings from reducing energy use
without making them pay for increases. With
the costs of attending Stanford already so
high, we do not think it would be a good idea
to add another one. However, simply reward
ing students for their conservation efforts
ought to be enough to prod them into action.
Logistically, the actions necessary to make
this idea a reality might present a challenge.
But if a plan to implement the program in
one area has already succeeded, it might be
possible to extend the effort to dorms.

Such a program would come straight out
of the existing Energy Conservation Incen
tive Program, which has given academic de
partments cash incentive to monitor their en
ergy use since 2004. The concept for the pro
gram is simple: Academic departments are
given an annual electricity budget based on
past consumption. Those departments that
exceed their target must pay the extra cost,
while those that reduce their usage keep the
savings. Thus, the costs of electricity fall upon
the people who use it.
Unfortunately, the same cannot currently
be said of student dorms and residences. With
no individual costs connected to energy use,
every student can consume as much as they
want with no consequences while the Uni-

With the tireless stream of environmental
efforts currently at work throughout the
Stanford community, the persistent apathy
towards simple conservation actions in
dorms represents an incongruity that must be
addressed. It is sad to see the commendable
work of so many students needlessly undone
by a few. Ideally, the motivation would come
from within each individual, but in the ab
sence of universal conscientiousness, energy
conservation incentives must be provided.
