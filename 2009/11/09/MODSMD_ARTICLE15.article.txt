# THE 						DUDE ABIDES
## "That's just, like, your opinion, man" 
### Zack Warma 
A column published in the Oct. 26 Daily
Princetonian titled "Welcome to
Princeford" has been making the
rounds virally. Anthony Grafton, a Princeton
history professor and author of the piece, ex
tols the values of our humble institution and
goes so far to declare that Stanford is "the
model others [read: preeminent American
privates] are trying to emulate." Citing the
emphasis on entrepreneurship, innovation
and their resulting positive effects on the hu
manities, Grafton brushes aside decades of in
feriority in the college rankings, and gives us
the lusted-after top spot in high education.
Did you hear that folks? According to
Grafton, it's time to bust out the bubbly we
won!

Unfortunately, I am not going to jump on
the victory float quite yet. There are a variety
of points that as a Stanford student (and a his
tory major to boot!), I would like to discuss a
wee further. But first, I must concede there
are a few insights Grafton nails. The weather:
Of all the major educational institutions in
the U.S., we have the best climate. I'm still
wearing my beat-up Reef sandals in Novem
ber and will continue to wear them through
out the year.
Regarding innovation in the humanities,
Stanford's history department is replete with
examples of this. The Spatial History Project
combines cutting-edge technology and metic
ulous research to present historical develop
ments and trends in formats more familiar to
CS majors than us history nerds. Grafton is
absolutely correct in pointing out that Stan
ford is home to structures within the humani
ties that foster levels of innovation. Oh, and
the "California kludge": Yeah ... not sure
what we were thinking when we built Terman.
I have grown to love the Law School, but
man, we got some ugly-ass buildings here.
And this is the part where the roads start
to diverge. According to Grafton, our culture
is "relaxed and laid-back." While Admit
Weekend, guided tours and those damn sexy
pamphlets like to present our wholesome
ness, Stanford students are shown to be equal
ly, if not more so, nuts than the rest of our
brethren in the Ivies. Putting aside the un
wieldy 'OB Mental Health Report Card, it
takes maybe a few weeks on campus to real
ize the absurdly unhealthy levels of stress and
questionable habits we subject ourselves to.
Couple that with this facade of tranquility and
BAM! you've got 6,000 under-slept crazies
running around in an insulated crazy house.
But instead of padded walls, we have $20,000
palm trees!
Grafton praises "problem sets and engi
neering projects" being discussed at lunch,
the entrepreneurial spirit inculcated by our
bedfellow status with Silicon Valley, and the
billions of capital lining Sand Hill Road. Yes,
the large-scale presence of "techies" (the
beloved moniker whose dreaded doppel

ganger is the "fuzzie") does provide the Uni
versity with unique perspectives that in ways
improve the vision of the academy. And while
our alums and current students that matter
have a sterling reputation for innovation
(Google, Yahoo, Sun Microsystems, iStanford
iPhone app, etc.), the structure of the Univer
sity runs counter to this stylized vision. The
expansive and labyrinthine bureaucracy that
governs this school really could only be re
ferred to as "progressive" if you also happen
to apply that term to the Luddites. Like any
multi-billion dollar operation that employs,
educates and cares for tens of thousand of
people, Stanford is one hot bureaucratic mess.
Two simplistic anecdotes: The only place for
non-Stanford folk to access wireless Internet
is Green Library, where they have to fill out a
one-day visitor access form to enter. In addi
tion, there is one department for the physical
residential buildings and janitorial staff
(Housing), and another to manage student
staff, programming and the like (Residential
Education). Generally speaking, what the
hell???

Let's put all of this aside, however, and
focus on one of Grafton's final lines in which
he discusses Princeton's future: "We have to
find ways to preserve and value the old-fash
ioned, one-on-one ways of doing things as
well as the hip new ones." So Stanford is hip,
eh? That's a phrase I NEVER thought I could
be associated with, even tangentially. Regard
less, Grafton is actually more correct than he
knows. At the Farm, we do "hip" (in educa
tion-chic, not American Apparel). What we
don't do nearly enough of is the "old-fash
ioned."

This is a school that reeks of pre-profes
sionalism, of a debauched launch pad to big
ger and better things. Some have gone so far
to label the undergraduate body as being
"anti-intellectual," because as a student it
often feels that discourse and debate ends at
the classroom door. And while I cannot speak
for other institutions, what I can say is this: For
Stanford to truly be the greatest university in
the nation, it must balance the "hip" with the
classical pillars of humanistic learning and
discourse. Also, USC sucks.

If you are reading this, it means that Zack man
aged to submit his column before midnight of
his 21st birthday. Care to see if the poor schlub
is still alive and kicking? Drop Zack a line at
