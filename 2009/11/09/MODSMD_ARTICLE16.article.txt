## Welcome to Princeford

The following was published in The Daily
Princetonian, Princeton's daily student-run
newspaper, on Oct. 26,2009. It is re-published
here with the permission of The Princetonian.
The author is a professor of history at the
university.

Ratings can fool you, and university
ratings often do. Read U.S. News &
World Report, and you find Prince
ton, Harvard and Yale nestled comfortably
on top: check out Forbes, and you find
Princeton, Caltech and Harvard there. But
if you listen to the presidents of the great
American private universities, follow their
policy decisions and their big investment
plans (now mostly on hold, but they'll be
back), they seem to work from different
criteria. Stanford the Farm looks
like the model that the others are trying to
emulate.

And why not? Stanford's campus is a glo
rious, unashamedly American mix of Bay
Area Romanesque, California kludge and
glorious nature. Its culture, so far as I've ex
perienced it, is cheerful and laid back a
nice contrast to Princeton, the place where
everyone knows that he or she has just been
marginalized. Like Princeton, Stanford is
chiefly famous for its scientists, but it does so
cial sciences and humanities really well, too.
But Stanford does have a certain profile.
It's not just that the webpage tells you that
the university is "in the heart of Silicon Val
ley," or that the presence of science and tech
nology on campus is architecturally over
whelming, or that the venture capital compa
nies glitter along Sand Hill Road, very close
to the campus, suggesting in the most vividly
material way that investors and researchers
live and work in a pretty tight symbiosis.
Everywhere on campus, you feel the
dominance of science and technology, from
the magnificent labs that seem to run 24

hours per day to the conversations about
problem sets and engineering projects that
you overhear if you eat your sandwich out
side (as you can, through most of the year).
And that's the Stanford that Yale and
Princeton and Harvard look at with admira
tion. This situation isn't always comfortable
for humanists in Palo Alto. A friend and for
mer student with whom I wrote a book dou
ble-majored in molecular biology and clas
sics —in order to refute accusations of
"fuzziness" (not a compliment in the Stan
ford dialect).
In most ways, though, the results have
been strikingly positive. Humanities at Stan
ford nurtures both great scholars pounding
keyboards in their offices and research
groups in which undergraduate and graduate
students, faculty and technical experts work
together. Many of Stanford's humanities fac
ulty — to say nothing of their students
have developed comfort with and expertise
in new information technologies and wield
them in original ways, to shed light on every
thing from the ways in which societies have
divided and used space to the movement of
words and ideas. Collaboration, they find, has
many virtues: It gets students involved in dis
covery, enables scholars to work on projects
that they couldn't carry off on their own and,
when it's properly organized, makes the
whole enterprise of scholarship more hu
mane and less melancholy.
Princeton has long had humanists who
grasped the potential of teamwork, informa
tion science and the internet. Robert Hol
lander, our great teacher and scholar of
Dante, was a digital pioneer when stick-in
the-muds like me urged him to get a horse.
My colleague John Haldon and his collabo
rators are steadily teaching us to see the his
tory of warfare and politics in the Middle
Ages in radically new ways. But the atmos
phere is different. On the whole, we sit in our

offices and type. And I'm pretty sure we
would profit by coming out, letting our eyes
adjust to the sun and trying things the Stan
ford way.
I'm all for Princeford, then but with
two provisos. The first is that Princeton
should emulate Stanford in encouraging and
rewarding entrepreneurial flair and innova
tion in the humanities, as well as in other
fields. Most of the lucre at Stanford natural
ly goes to the fields pursued in the big glass
labs. But Stanford also showers modest
amounts of gold on humanists and, by
doing so, helps them bring in their share of
outside largesse. Not surprisingly, this keeps
the humanists apple-cheeked, cheerful and
astonishingly productive.

The second is that all involved should
bear in mind that the humanities have a dis
tinctive relation to tradition one very dif
ferent from that of the sciences and social
sciences. Humanists professors and stu
dents alike go lots of places. But they start
by mastering languages and using them to
interpret documents, works of art and music,
poems, plays and novels. That's old-fash
ioned, Slow Food work, accessed by old
fashioned ways of learning. Princeton has al
ways valued these old-fashioned crafts, and
it's by combining them with new technolo
gies that we will get the richest results. If
Princeton really wants to be Princeford
and not just a smaller, less attractive Stan
ford in New Jersey we have to find ways
to preserve and value the old-fashioned,
one-on-one ways of doing things as well as
the hip new ones. It's a challenge. For hu
manists, it's probably the challenge of the
century.
