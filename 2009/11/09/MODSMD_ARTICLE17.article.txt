Dear Stanford community,

The Stanford Review's Nov. 6 article ex
amining the discretionary expenditures
made under the Avula/Jones Executive
echoes a series of long-standing ASSU delib
erations regarding the limitations that should
be placed upon discretionary expenditures.
Rightfully so, this issue has been one that
has absorbed much of my time and the time
of two Executives (Dorsey/Harris and Gob
aud/de la Torre). In numerous conversations,
several ASSU officials (including myself)
have reiterated that there are too few con
trols on discretionary expenditures. And
while policy changes are always a work in
progress, I believe that the past ten months
has shown the ASSU to be an organization
strongly capable of self-policing and self-reg
ulating itself.
ASSU discussions about discretionary ex
penditures extend back more than ten months
ago when Jonny, Fagan and I initially became
aware that some of the discretionary expendi
tures in the Avula/Jones Executive might have
violated the ASSU's bylaws. Although none of
us owed any political allegiance to the
Avula/Jones administration (none of us had
served in any substantial administrative capac
ity during their tenure), we felt that the gravity
of the accusations required us to trend smartly.
After reviewing two internal reports devel
oped by then-Operations Manager David
Gobaud and then-Capital Group Director
Matt Sprague, Jonny, Fagan and I informed
the office of Internal Audit that there was a
possibility of a bylaw violation. Soon there
after, the Office of General Counsel was in
formed. Consultations with those offices soon
followed.

The ASSU had no qualms about self-re
porting potential abuses, and I consider our
reaction as proof that the ASSU can act with
the utmost professional decor.
Following our consultations with Universi
ty members, it quickly became clear that the
bylaw rules regarding discretionary expendi
tures were so broad that any attempt to bring
a case against the Avula/Jones administration
would have a near impossible chance of suc
ceeding.
The Review may actually have come to
providing the extra level of evidence we

lacked so many months ago, but at the time of
this writing, even the Review seems to have
tiptoed around this issue carefully in the ad
vanced copy provided to me. Testimony from
cabinet members would have made any case
against the Avula/Jones administration much
stronger, but when the claim was first report
ed to the University, there seemed to be no
such testimony.
One Review source mentions that "[F]ood
was very often purchased for events that had
little relation to official ASSU matters." How
ever, the source goes unnamed and without
linking a particular charge to this claim. With
no one willing to come forward and connect
his or her experience with the cabinet to spe
cific expenditures, we as a community are left
in the same position in which the ASSU found
itself several months ago. We remain absent
the necessary evidence to know absolutely
what happened within the Avula/Jones Exec
utive and, more importantly, unable to say be
yond reasonable doubt that discretionary ex
penditures were inappropriate or against
ASSU bylaws.
As the investigation came to a standstill,
Jonny, Fagan and I refocused on our efforts.
The ASSU had to create stronger internal

mechanisms to prevent even the appearance
of abuse in the future. It was not enough that
we had reacted; we needed proactive enough
policies to aid us in prevention.
Since the close of the investigation, there
has been a substantial reform implemented
that has and will continue to ensure best prac
tices within the ASSU. The ASSU will no
longer adopt a passive policy of releasing in
formation. Instead, the organization will make
the commitment to publicize the details of its
political expenditures, thereby making close
scrutiny of the political bodies' expenditures
easier and more frequent.
There are obviously quite a few more reg
ulations needed to shore up our ability to suf
ficiently self-regulate.There need to be discus
sions about the ethical rules surrounding dis
cretionary funds. There need to be changes to
documentation requirement. These changes
will most certainly be ratified in the ASSU by
laws over the coming months, and with those
changes, the ASSU will have comprehensive
ly addressed this issue.
