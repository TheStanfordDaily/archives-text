Perfection.
The Cardinal women concluded their re
markable 2009 regular season Sunday afternoon
with a 4-1 victory over cross-bay rival California,
cementing Stanford's first-ever flawless record
at 20-0-0. Senior Kelley O'Hara, honored along
side her classmates prior to the game as part of
the Cardinal's Senior Day, recorded her second
hat trick of the season and shattered Stanford's
single-season goals record in the process. The
win secures the Cardinal's sole possession of the
Pacific-10 Conference championship for the first
time since 2002, and all but guarantees that Stan
ford will receive the top seed and home field ad
vantage for the first two rounds of the upcoming
NCAA tournament.

Both teams came out with high intensity and
it was the Golden Bears who got the first shot
off, with Cal redshirt junior forward Lisa
Kevorkian forcing a save from junior Kira
Maker not even two minutes in.

Seeking his 22nd consecutive regular season
win, Stanford Head Coach Paul Ratcliffe was
somewhat frustrated with how the match started.

"I wasn't very happy with the first five min
utes," Ratcliffe said. "There's always a lot of
emotion with the cross-town rivalry, and I
thought we were a little nervous, a little edgy.
But that's going to happen in these rivalry
matches."

Junior forward Christen Press saw two shots
stopped by Cal senior keeper Gina Pellegrin,
and sophomore Lindsay Taylor once again
playing in an attacking midfield role rather
than her usual forward position forced a
corner kick with a low shot in the 14th minute.
The ensuing corner was cleared, but only as far
as Stanford forward O'Hara. The senior lofted
a header back toward goal, and the ball sailed
over a diving Pellegrini to not only give Stan
ford the lead, but also give O'Hara her record
breaking 21st goal of the year.
"Our first goal came on a corner kick
Press kind of whipped it in and it popped up,"
O'Hara recalled. "It was pretty high in the air,
and we always try to attack that kind of ball and
keep it moving, so I was on the outside of the
box and I just went for it, and it went in."
The goal cemented O'Hara's place among
the true Cardinal greats, as it gave her the edge
over Sarah Rafanelli's 1993 effort for Stan
ford's single-season goals record. Despite the
long-term impact of such a feat, the senior co
captain was more concerned with her goal's im
mediate consequences.

"It wasn't about breaking the record at first,
it was just a relief that we had a 1-0 lead, and
that we could sit back and play our game and
knock it around and not worry quite so much,"
O'Hara said. "Every time we score the first
goal, I think it gives us confidence, so if we can
get that goal it really gets things moving for us."

O'Hara was far from done. In the 33rd
minute,Taylor found herself in traffic at the top

GAME NOTES: Stanford was led (against Cal and through
out the season) by forward Kelley O'Hara. The Cardinal
stayed perfect (20-0) thanks to the senior's second hat
trick of the season (which also broke Stanford's single
season record for number of goals, now set at 23). The
top-ranked Card now moves onto NCAA Tournament
play, more than likely a No. 1 seed, but Stanford's full
play schedule will not be announced until today at 5 p.m

of the box, but managed to twist and turn past
multiple defenders before spreading the ball
out wide right to freshman fullback Rachel
Quon. Quon crossed to the back post where
O'Hara had timed her run perfectly, and the
striker powered a header into the net to make
it 2-0.

The Card was close again before halftime,
with junior Morgan Redman heading just wide
off of a corner kick in the 42nd minute, leaving
the difference 2-0 at the break. Yet it was only
seven minutes into the second half before it was
3-0.
Senior center back Alicia Jenkins who,
along with the rest of the defenders, did a mas

terful job on Cal's forward line sent a long
ball down the middle of the field and into the
box. It looked as though it was heading right to
a Cal defender, but O'Hara came out of
nowhere to sneak in front and one-touch it into
the net. It was a goal worthy of capping off any
hat trick, and although O'Hara already record
ed the feat earlier this year, she realized how
special her second career hat trick was.
"Til definitely remember this senior day
it's pretty exciting," O'Hara said. "I'm just
happy we won. I mean, we just went undefeat
ed and I'm not sure that Stanford has ever done
that before. So we're going to celebrate at least
for tonight and enjoy it."

Cal managed to pull one goal back in the
59th minute, after a penalty kick was awarded
following a pile up in the Stanford penalty area.
Maker did well to save the spot kick from Cal
junior Alex Morgan, but the rebound came
right back to the forward, who buried her sec
ond chance.

"I couldn't see much of that play â€”it
looked just like a huge scrum," Ratcliffe com
mented. "I didn't think they were calling a
penalty kick at first, I thought they were giving
us a free kick instead, so I really couldn't see
from my angle what happened, just a lot of bod
ies going for the ball and somehow they got a
PK. Kira made a great first save, and unfortu
nately we didn't follow up."

Just four minutes later, the three-goal cushion
was restored. Taylor collected the ball about 30
yards out on the right side and decided to have a
go her confidence was validated as the ball
dipped over Pellegrini and into the top corner of
the goal. It was the final goal of the match, as the
Cardinal clinched its first outright conference
championship since 2002 with an emphatic 4-1
victory.

Following the game, the commissioner of the
Pac-10 presented the conference trophy to Stan
ford's trio of co-captains.

"It feels great [to lift the Pac-10 trophy],"
O'Hara said after winning her first conference
championship. "I'm so pleased with this team
and so happy for us, definitely, with this being
senior year, and not having won it to finally
get it and having it be all ours, I'm glad we got a
taste of that... but we're looking to hoist one
more trophy in a few weeks, so hopefully we can
get there, too."

Stanford now awaits word on its starting po
sition in the upcoming national tournament. The
Cardinal's seeding along with its possible
duty as host for the first two rounds will be an
nounced on the National Selection Show at 5
p.m. this evening (Monday) on ESPNEWS.
