## Teams win at regionals Stanford programmers qualify for 'Battle of the Brains' World Finals 
### SAHAR KHAN 
While crowds rushed the football field after the
Cardinal beat the Ducks, three Stanford teams took
Northern California by storm in the Pacific Northwest
Regional preliminaries of the 34th annual IBM-spon
sored "Battle of the Brains."

Hosted at University of the Pacific on Nov. 7, the
Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)
International Collegiate Programming Contest
(ICPC) determines which regional teams qualify for
the World Finals.

Stanford Cardinal, area champions and qualifiers
for the World Finals, is comprised of Jae Hyun Park
'l2, Jeffrey Wang 'lO and computer science graduate
student Philipp Krahenbuhl. The team will head to
Harbin, China in February 2010 to showcase their
programming firepower on the international stage.
Regional teams included the University of British
Columbia (ÜBC), UC-Berkeley and University of
Washington. Two of the three Stanford teams,
Stanford Cardinal and Stanford Red, placed second
and third, respectively, ceding first place to ÜBC.
At the World Finals, 88 of the top teams chosen
from regionals across the globe will be challenged
in a grueling five-hour-long contest during which
competitors tackle nine to 15 computer program
ming problems.

Other Stanford students competing at regionals
includes first year graduate student in mathematics
Fernando Shao, Seok Hyeong Lee 'l2 and Andrew
Chien 'll for Stanford Red, and Deyan Simeonov
'l2, David Wu 'l3 and Phumchanit
Watanaprakornkul 'l2 for Stanford White. The stu
dents were selected from a pool of about 40 students
who had participated in the local Stanford contest.
Computer Science Prof. Jerry Cain, one of the
Stanford coaches and a competition judge, spoke to
the competitiveness of the Pacific Northwest region.
"We are certainly qualified to make it to the
finals," Cain said before regionals. "However, it
would be arrogant and erroneous for me to think
that our chances are 100 percent, simply because of
the region and how strong it is."
Cain also added that "students gain a lot of noto
riety" from the competition, and "every single one of
the 350 brilliant students in the room would qualify
for an interview."

Doug Heintzman, director of strategy for IBM
Software Group and sponsorship executive of the
ICPC, echoed Cain's positive assessment.
"All big industry titans aggressively recruit from
the competitions," he said. "And if
you've got the fact that you were in
the competition, especially if you
were a world finalist, that is a golden
ticket."

Stanford participants are also part
of an IBM initiative that enables
them to deploy their technological
skills to potentially effect societal
change.
"The problems we put in front of
the students are all dressed up as
real-world problems," Heintzman
added.

He hoped students would use
their skills to "tackle issues of trans
portation, congestion, energy effi
ciency, routing and modeling human
genomes."
"These are all disciplines that
employees of my company work at
on a daily basis," Heintzman said.
"We hope that many of the students
would join the workforce and go to

work on these pressing problems."
Stanford Cardinal has a hard act
to follow, as Stanford is one of two
universities that has clinched three
world championships —in 1985,
1987 and 1991 and has earned a
silver medal twice in this decade. The
other three-time winner is the St.
Petersburg Institute of Fine
Mechanics and Optics.
"We're going to need an
American standard-bearer, and with
Stanford's rich tradition, hopefully
your team will be able to step up to
that and into the limelight,"
Heintzman said. "I look forward to
welcoming them in China."
MIT, another "perennial favorite,"
according to Heintzman, and
Stanford's rival in the U.S. computer
programming arena, did not advance
to its customary first place in the East
Coast Regionals.
When asked what he gained from
the competition, Park's mind was
teeming, but he offered a single word:
"Fun!"
