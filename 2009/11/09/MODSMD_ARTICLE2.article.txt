While crowds rushed the football field after the
Cardinal beat the Ducks, three Stanford teams took
Northern California by storm in the Pacific Northwest
Regional preliminaries of the 34th annual IBM-spon
sored "Battle of the Brains."

Hosted at University of the Pacific on Nov. 7, the
Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)
International Collegiate Programming Contest
(ICPC) determines which regional teams qualify for
the World Finals.

Stanford Cardinal, area champions and qualifiers
for the World Finals, is comprised of Jae Hyun Park
'l2, Jeffrey Wang 'lO and computer science graduate
student Philipp Krahenbuhl. The team will head to
Harbin, China in February 2010 to showcase their
programming firepower on the international stage.
Regional teams included the University of British
Columbia (ÜBC), UC-Berkeley and University of
Washington. Two of the three Stanford teams,
Stanford Cardinal and Stanford Red, placed second
and third, respectively, ceding first place to ÜBC.
At the World Finals, 88 of the top teams chosen
from regionals across the globe will be challenged
in a grueling five-hour-long contest during which
competitors tackle nine to 15 computer program
ming problems.

Other Stanford students competing at regionals
includes first year graduate student in mathematics
Fernando Shao, Seok Hyeong Lee 'l2 and Andrew
Chien 'll for Stanford Red, and Deyan Simeonov
'l2, David Wu 'l3 and Phumchanit
Watanaprakornkul 'l2 for Stanford White. The stu
dents were selected from a pool of about 40 students
who had participated in the local Stanford contest.
Computer Science Prof. Jerry Cain, one of the
Stanford coaches and a competition judge, spoke to
the competitiveness of the Pacific Northwest region.
"We are certainly qualified to make it to the
finals," Cain said before regionals. "However, it
would be arrogant and erroneous for me to think
that our chances are 100 percent, simply because of
the region and how strong it is."
Cain also added that "students gain a lot of noto
riety" from the competition, and "every single one of
the 350 brilliant students in the room would qualify
for an interview."

Doug Heintzman, director of strategy for IBM
Software Group and sponsorship executive of the
ICPC, echoed Cain's positive assessment.
"All big industry titans aggressively recruit from
