# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Card goes one-and-one at Washingtons 
### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's vol
leyball team took its game up to
Washington last weekend for some
more Pacific-10 Conference action.
The Cardinal (16-7 overall, 9-4 con
ference) faced the No. 4 University
of Washington Huskies (20-2 over
all, 10-2 conference) and the No. 24
Washington State Cougars (16-8
overall, 5-8 conference) and is look
ing to bounce back from last week
end's tough loss to UCLA.
"We talked a lot this past week
about minimizing the other team's
runs," said junior Cassidy Lichtman.
"We had a couple big leads against
UCLA that we allowed them to
come back from and we know we
just can't let that happen."
Unfortunately, the Huskies
proved a difficult opponent and the
Card did let up some big runs, falling
in three sets (21-25,23-25,19-25) on
Lriday before rebounding to sweep
Washington State (25-17, 25-20, 25-
22) Saturday night.
Against Washington, Lichtman
and junior libera Gabi Ailes led the
way for Stanford, with Lichtman
recording 14 kills and nine assists
and Ailes contributing 29 digs in the
losing effort.
The Card came out strong in the
first set, jumping out to a 5-1 lead off
of two kills by Lichtman. However,
Washington fought back to take the
lead, 7-6 and after three quick attack
errors by Stanford, built a 10-16 lead
over the Card. Lollowing some back
and forth play, three kills by junior
Alix Klineman cut the Washington

lead to 16-20, but the Card couldn't
overcome the deficit and lost the set,
21-25.

"A couple of long rallies went
their way, but we fought hard," said
sophomore Stephanie Browne.
"Every play counts and we could
have done a better job of treating
each play like a match point."
Looking to tie it up in the second
set, the Cardinal found itself down 8-
3, before a kill and a block by Licht
man cut the lead to two. However,
Washington responded with a 10-4
run to take the lead, 16-20. Stanford
didn't give up though and two kills
by senior Janet Okogbaa helped tie
the score at 22-all, before a quick 3-1
run by the Huskies gave them the
set, 23-25.
Once again in the third set, with
the score tied at seven, Washington
went on a run, scoring eight points to
Stanford's three and taking the lead,
10-15. After gaining the advantage,
Washington never looked back and
won the third set and the match,
marking the first time since 2006
that Stanford has been swept by an
other Pac-10 team.

"Although we played well in the
Washington match, we did not play
quite well enough," Browne said.
"The loss provided extra motivation
to really come out strong and have a
great match against Washington
State."

This sentiment was echoed by
Okogbaa.
"After losing two matches in a
row it was important for our team to
win the match against Washington
State and build confidence as we
move toward the end of conference
play," she said.
Stanford certainly looked confi
dent Saturday night, as it dispatched
Washington State in straight sets.
The Card jumped out to a 7-4 lead
over the Cougars on two kills by
Browne and a solo block by Okog
baa.Two more kills by Klineman and
a service ace by Ailes helped build the
lead to 14-7, but Washington State re
sponded with a 4-1 run to cut the lead
to four, 20-16. However, Stanford
then shut the Cougars down to win
the first set, 25-17, while holding
WSU to a .059 hitting percentage in
the set.

Looking to capitalize on its mo
mentum from the first set, the Cardi
nal started out the second set on top
before a 5-0 Washington State run put
them down, 1-5. A quick 3-0 run, in
cluding kills by Okogbaa and Licht
man, brought Stanford within one
and kills by senior Alex Fisher and
Klineman put the team up 14-12.
After trading points for a while, a 4-1
run by the Card, punctuated by a
Klineman kill, gave Stanford the sec
ond set, 25-20.

Washington State opened up an
early 3-8 lead in the third set, but a 5-
0 run by the Card, following a time
out by Coach John Dunning, led to an
8-8 tie. Back and forth play kept the
set close before a Browne kill gave
Stanford a 19-17 lead. Two straight
blocks by the Card put the team up
23-19 and Browne's ninth kill of the
night would seal the set and the
match for Stanford.
"We knew as soon as the Wash
ington match ended that the Wash
ington State match was now even
more important," Lichtman said.
"We passed much better against
Washington State which allowed us
to run a more balanced and more ef
fective offense."

The win was a big one for the
Card, allowing it to remain in a tie for
second place in the Pac-10 with
UCLA.

Next week, Stanford looks to con
tinue its dominance in league play
with matches at home against No. 14

set, 23-25.
Once again in the third set, with
the score tied at seven, Washington
went on a run, scoring eight points to
Stanford's three and taking the lead,
10-15. After gaining the advantage,
Washington never looked back and
won the third set and the match,
marking the first time since 2006
that Stanford has been swept by an
other Pac-10 team.

"Although we played well in the
Washington match, we did not play
quite well enough," Browne said.
"The loss provided extra motivation
to really come out strong and have a
great match against Washington
State."

This sentiment was echoed by
Okogbaa.
"After losing two matches in a
row it was important for our team to
win the match against Washington
State and build confidence as we
move toward the end of conference
play," she said.
Stanford certainly looked confi
dent Saturday night, as it dispatched
Washington State in straight sets.
The Card jumped out to a 7-4 lead
over the Cougars on two kills by
Browne and a solo block by Okog
baa.Two more kills by Klineman and
a service ace by Ailes helped build the
lead to 14-7, but Washington State re
sponded with a 4-1 run to cut the lead
to four, 20-16. However, Stanford
then shut the Cougars down to win
the first set, 25-17, while holding
WSU to a .059 hitting percentage in
the set.

Looking to capitalize on its mo
mentum from the first set, the Cardi
nal started out the second set on top
before a 5-0 Washington State run put
them down, 1-5. A quick 3-0 run, in
cluding kills by Okogbaa and Licht
man, brought Stanford within one
and kills by senior Alex Fisher and
Klineman put the team up 14-12.
After trading points for a while, a 4-1
run by the Card, punctuated by a
Klineman kill, gave Stanford the sec
ond set, 25-20.

Washington State opened up an
early 3-8 lead in the third set, but a 5-
0 run by the Card, following a time
out by Coach John Dunning, led to an
8-8 tie. Back and forth play kept the
set close before a Browne kill gave
Stanford a 19-17 lead. Two straight
blocks by the Card put the team up
23-19 and Browne's ninth kill of the
night would seal the set and the
match for Stanford.
"We knew as soon as the Wash
ington match ended that the Wash
ington State match was now even
more important," Lichtman said.
"We passed much better against
Washington State which allowed us
to run a more balanced and more ef
fective offense."

The win was a big one for the
Card, allowing it to remain in a tie for
second place in the Pac-10 with
UCLA.

Next week, Stanford looks to con
tinue its dominance in league play
with matches at home against No. 14
Oregon on Friday and Oregon State
on Saturday.
