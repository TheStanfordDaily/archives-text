## Card goes one-and-one at Washingtons 
### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's vol
leyball team took its game up to
Washington last weekend for some
more Pacific-10 Conference action.
The Cardinal (16-7 overall, 9-4 con
ference) faced the No. 4 University
of Washington Huskies (20-2 over
all, 10-2 conference) and the No. 24
Washington State Cougars (16-8
overall, 5-8 conference) and is look
ing to bounce back from last week
end's tough loss to UCLA.
"We talked a lot this past week
about minimizing the other team's
runs," said junior Cassidy Lichtman.
"We had a couple big leads against
UCLA that we allowed them to
come back from and we know we
just can't let that happen."
Unfortunately, the Huskies
proved a difficult opponent and the
Card did let up some big runs, falling
in three sets (21-25,23-25,19-25) on
Lriday before rebounding to sweep
Washington State (25-17, 25-20, 25-
22) Saturday night.
Against Washington, Lichtman
and junior libera Gabi Ailes led the
way for Stanford, with Lichtman
recording 14 kills and nine assists
and Ailes contributing 29 digs in the
losing effort.
The Card came out strong in the
first set, jumping out to a 5-1 lead off
of two kills by Lichtman. However,
Washington fought back to take the
lead, 7-6 and after three quick attack
errors by Stanford, built a 10-16 lead
over the Card. Lollowing some back
and forth play, three kills by junior
Alix Klineman cut the Washington

lead to 16-20, but the Card couldn't
overcome the deficit and lost the set,
21-25.

"A couple of long rallies went
their way, but we fought hard," said
sophomore Stephanie Browne.
"Every play counts and we could
have done a better job of treating
each play like a match point."
Looking to tie it up in the second
set, the Cardinal found itself down 8-
3, before a kill and a block by Licht
man cut the lead to two. However,
Washington responded with a 10-4
run to take the lead, 16-20. Stanford
didn't give up though and two kills
by senior Janet Okogbaa helped tie
the score at 22-all, before a quick 3-1
run by the Huskies gave them the
set, 23-25.
Once again in the third set, with
the score tied at seven, Washington
went on a run, scoring eight points to
Stanford's three and taking the lead,
10-15. After gaining the advantage,
Washington never looked back and
won the third set and the match,
marking the first time since 2006
that Stanford has been swept by an
other Pac-10 team.

"Although we played well in the
Washington match, we did not play
quite well enough," Browne said.
"The loss provided extra motivation
to really come out strong and have a
great match against Washington
State."

This sentiment was echoed by
Okogbaa.
"After losing two matches in a
row it was important for our team to
