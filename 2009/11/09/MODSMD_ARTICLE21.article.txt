# Starting off fresh
## Basketball silences Sonoma in home opener 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford men's basketball indeed made an exhibition of
Division II Sonoma State on Friday night, 82-61. All 12 Cardi
nal players made appearances against the Seawolves, helping
Stanford start the season right with a victory.
Stanford opened scoring in the contest with a three-point
er by junior Da'Veed Dildy, and though a three by Sonoma
State forward Mike Nelson tied the teams early, the Cardinal
never trailed the Seawolves. By 12 minutes, 49 seconds, a lay
up by Jarrett Mann put Stanford up 20-10 and the lead hov
ered around 10 for the next five minutes of play.
At 5:59, though, Sonoma's Steven Pratt earned three the
old-school way, sinking his and-one to pull the Seawolves with
in five, 28-23. Stanford responded with senior guard Drew
Shiller and sophomore forward Andrew Zimmermann hitting
back-to-back threes, while forcing turnovers by Pratt and
Sonoma's Chris Weber to extend the lead to 11.
With 3:12 left before the break, senior Emmanuel Igbinosa
hit the team's sixth and final first-half long ball to put Stanford
up 18 and the Card rode its offensive momentum into the
break, still leading 47-30.
Overall, Stanford shot 60 percent in the half, under the
leadership of senior Landry Fields, who posted 11 of his game
high 15 points before halftime.
Stanford, though, hit its real groove when it took the floor
for the second period with another three ball from Dildy (nine
points) to start off the scoring. The Card took over, and Fields
and Dildy punctuated 13-2 run with emphatic back-to-back
dunks that rallied the crowd and pushed the margin to 25. Zim
mermann â€” who finished the night as Stanford's second
leading scorer with 13 points and 10 rebounds added an
other two inside to make it 59-32 with 16:14 to go, but Sono
ma's press gave Stanford increasing trouble, keeping the Car
dinal quiet for the next four minutes.
At 12:47, a three by Igbinosa and a dunk by Zimmermann
resparked the Card offense, and Stanford went on another 10-4
run, finished by a lay-up and three-pointer on consecutive pos-

Senior Landry Fields led all scorers with 15 points
(and eight boards) in Stanford's win over the Sea-wolves on Friday. Fields is the Card's leading returning scorer and will likely be its go-to guy this year.
