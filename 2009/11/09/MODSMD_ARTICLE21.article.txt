# Starting off fresh
## Basketball silences Sonoma in home opener 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford men's basketball indeed made an exhibition of
Division II Sonoma State on Friday night, 82-61. All 12 Cardi
nal players made appearances against the Seawolves, helping
Stanford start the season right with a victory.
Stanford opened scoring in the contest with a three-point
er by junior Da'Veed Dildy, and though a three by Sonoma
State forward Mike Nelson tied the teams early, the Cardinal
never trailed the Seawolves. By 12 minutes, 49 seconds, a lay
up by Jarrett Mann put Stanford up 20-10 and the lead hov
ered around 10 for the next five minutes of play.
At 5:59, though, Sonoma's Steven Pratt earned three the
old-school way, sinking his and-one to pull the Seawolves with
in five, 28-23. Stanford responded with senior guard Drew
Shiller and sophomore forward Andrew Zimmermann hitting
back-to-back threes, while forcing turnovers by Pratt and
Sonoma's Chris Weber to extend the lead to 11.
With 3:12 left before the break, senior Emmanuel Igbinosa
hit the team's sixth and final first-half long ball to put Stanford
up 18 and the Card rode its offensive momentum into the
break, still leading 47-30.
Overall, Stanford shot 60 percent in the half, under the
leadership of senior Landry Fields, who posted 11 of his game
high 15 points before halftime.
Stanford, though, hit its real groove when it took the floor
for the second period with another three ball from Dildy (nine
points) to start off the scoring. The Card took over, and Fields
and Dildy punctuated 13-2 run with emphatic back-to-back
dunks that rallied the crowd and pushed the margin to 25. Zim
mermann — who finished the night as Stanford's second
leading scorer with 13 points and 10 rebounds added an
other two inside to make it 59-32 with 16:14 to go, but Sono
ma's press gave Stanford increasing trouble, keeping the Car
dinal quiet for the next four minutes.
At 12:47, a three by Igbinosa and a dunk by Zimmermann
resparked the Card offense, and Stanford went on another 10-4
run, finished by a lay-up and three-pointer on consecutive pos-

sessions by sophomore guard Jarett
Mann, which gave Stanford its biggest
lead at 35. Sophomore Matei Daian
earned his first bucket of the season at
8:01, making it 76-42.
Two minutes later, with Maples
Pavilion pulling for him, freshman
walk-on Peter Abraham blocked a
three-point attempt by Seawolves'
guard lan Larsson. Abraham snagged
his own block and ran the length of
the floor, but missed the dunk at the
other end and thus delayed his first
collegiate scoring until at least the
Card's next outing.
Regardless, Stanford's established
lead allowed 11 players to earn dou
ble digits in minutes and contribu
tions from nearly all of them. Behind
Fields (who also had eight boards)
and Zimmerman, Igbinosa and Mann
added 11 points each, and sophomore
Jack Trotter put up another 10.
The Cardinal shot 50 percent on
the game, holding to that at 10-20
from behind the arc. Stanford also
out-edged Sonoma 43-22 in re
bounds. However, the Card strug
gled with the press, and was forced
into 16 turnovers by some combina

tion of youth, rustiness and fluster.
While the team got away with some
early-season sloppiness against the
Seawolves, it will catch few such
breaks once regular season play
kicks off on Nov. 13.

Stanford next meets San Diego
away on Friday at 7 p.m. Head Coach
Johnny Dawkins will likely stick with
his starting lineup of Fields, Zimmer
man, sophomore center Elliot Bul
lock, Shiller and Dildy. The Toreros
will likely play a pretty guard-heavy
lineup, so Stanford's small size still
shouldn't be overly exploited. But
San Diego's De'Jon Jackson will test
the Cardinal backcourt more than
any of the Seawolves did and Stan
ford as a whole will need crisper pass
ing (and fewer turnovers), better
handling of a press defense and
roughly 200 collective pounds pri
marily put on its "big" men.
But the Card's opener bodes well
for potential improvement, as young
players proved themselves capable of
sharing the offensive burden and
Fields proved himself ready to lead. In
the week of rest, Stanford will see if it
can take play to the next level against
a Division I opponent, and hopes to
earn another win that this time will
appear on its record.
