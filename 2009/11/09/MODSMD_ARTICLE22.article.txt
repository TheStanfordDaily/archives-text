# Football is going BOWLING
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
The waiting is over, finally. If
you don't have winter break
plans, don't make any yet, be
cause Stanford football will
be headed to one of a few beautiful
destinations San Diego, San Fran
cisco, Las Vegas, Hawaii, El Paso, or, if
a few things fall into place, Pasadena.
Stanford football is officially going
bowling. With Saturday's shootout
victory over Oregon, the Cardinal
clinched its first bowl appearance
since a disappointing Seattle Bowl
loss to Georgia Tech in 2001.

Here are seven reasons this Stan
ford team is going BOWLING:

B is for Beast: As in the 237-pound
bull of a running back, Toby Gerhart.
Stanford's success ultimately comes
down to Gerhart. Not only is he sec
ond in the nation in rushing yards and
rushing touchdown, but he also leads
the country in carries with 233, 24
more than the runner-up. That means
the Cardinal leans on Gerhart who
doesn't seem to mind one bit (see 38
carries, 223 yards on Saturday)
more than any other team leans on
any other running back.

Gerhart is a workhorse and a load
to bring down, but his presence also
opens up the passing game for redshirt
freshman quarterback Andrew Luck,
who consequently has been one of the
most efficient passers in the nation.
Opponents have to game-plan to stop
Gerhart and Luck now, which, as Ore
gon demonstrated, is not an easy task.

O is for O-Line: Is there a better one
around than Stanford's? The Cardinal
offensive line (along with fullback
Owen Marecic), have routinely out
worked and out-muscled opposing
defensive lines, paving the way for
Gerhart and keeping Luck's jersey
clean.

The Stanford offensive line is so
good that when it is 4th and 1 with 5:48
left in the game, Stanford can bring in
two extra offensive lineman, James
McGillicuddy and Bert Mcßride, and
do exactly what everybody watching
the game knew it was going to do: run
the ball right at Oregon and get the
first down.

The unit boasts two very impres
sive redshirt freshmen in right guard
David DeCastro and left tackle
Jonathan Martin, but is ultimately
anchored by the experience of red
shirt juniors left guard Andrew
Phillips and center Chase Beeler, as
well as fifth-year senior right tackle
Chris Marinelli.

W is for Winning: As in figuring out
how to. For years, Stanford football
had an uncanny knack at snatching
defeat from the hands of victory. Not
this team. Sure, it lost close games at
Wake Forest and Arizona, but it has
impressively held off late charges by
both UCLA and Oregon in ways that
former Stanford teams wouldn't
have. (If you need reference, see the
2005 Stanford-UCLA game in which
the Cardinal blew a three-touch
down lead with five minutes to go in
the game).
Head Coach Jim Harbaugh has in
stilled a winning attitude and culture
in which players expect to win week in
and week out. Harbaugh doesn't play
to be competitive, like some former
Stanford coaches he plays to win
and Stanford is winning.
L is for Luck: Not the kind that
stopped Oregon running back
LaMichael James from catching a
cold, let alone the football. I mean An
drew Luck, who is quickly becoming
one of the best quarterbacks in the na
tion — and is only 19! If you want
your kid to be a quarterback, have
him watch Andrew Luck throw a
deep ball, because he has a rare gift.
Stanford receivers routinely catch
balls completely in stride, right in the
bread basket, after Luck makes a
tremendous play-action fake and fires
a laser down the field.
Sure, he makes the occasional
rookie mistake, although he hasn't in
a few weeks. He is essentially devel
oping right before our eyes and if he
continues at this rate, he going to be
scary-good before he leaves the Farm
for the NFL.

I is for Intensity: As in the intensity of
Stanford coaches. If you hadn't no
