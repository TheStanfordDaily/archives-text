## Star LB Snyder sidelined for season with knee injury 
### â€“ By Wyndarm Makowsky 
Fifth-year senior middle line
backer Clinton Snyder is out for the
season with a knee injury he suffered
in practice this week.
"What happened with Clinton was
just awful," said Head Coach Jim Har
baugh. "There wasn't even much of a
contact on the play, but our heart goes
out to Clinton."

On a defense that has experienced
a tremendous amount of turnover and
rotation, Snyder has been a constant,
and arguably the Cardinal's best de
fensive player this season. He leads
the team with 61 tackles, and had start
ed all eight of Stanford's games. This
was his last season of eligibility.
"Everybody was sad for Clinton
and it's a huge loss," said junior run
ning back Toby Gerhart. "He's a
leader that's been a rock on our de
fense and everybody was a little bit

sad, but at the same time we knew we
had to step up and play for him."
According to the San Francisco
Chronicle, Snyder hyperextended his
left knee and tore his lateral cruciate
ligament when dropping back to de
fend a pass during a scrimmage.
Junior Owen Marecic, the Cardi
nal's star fullback, will take over Sny
der's starting spot. Marecic has been
playing both ways since the spring. Fie
has been utilized almost exclusively in
goal line packages since the beginning
of the season, and has yet to register a
tackle, Redshirt junior Nick Macaluso,
who saw considerable time in the mid
dle last year, will be Marecic's backup.
Due to his heightened number of total
plays, Marecic will be spelled on of
fense by fifth-year senior Josh Catron,
a reliable reserve in his own right.
Stanford takes on No. 8 Oregon at
home this Saturday at 12:30 p.m.
