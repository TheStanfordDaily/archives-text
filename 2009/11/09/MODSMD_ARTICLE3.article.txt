## Card ends Oregon's seven-game streak

Stanford football is going bowling.
Check that: No. 25 Stanford football is
going bowling.

In Jim Harbaugh's team's most defining
win to date, the Cardinal (6-3, 5-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) topped No. 7 Oregon (7-2,
5-1 Pac-10), 51-42, at home to reach the
postseason for the first time since 2001.
The win also placed Stanford back in the
rankings after an eight-year absence,
"This was the best opportunity in the
last 10 years to express who this team is as
a football team," Harbaugh said.
Unlike the USC upset two years ago,
when a squad in its first stages of rebuild
ing pulled out a miraculous win, Saturday's
victory was an emphatic, 60-minute state
ment that Stanford has a high-quality foot
ball program. Simply put, there was noth
ing miraculous about it.

In a contest where few gave the

Cardinal much of a chance, Stanford con
trolled the game throughout. From sopho
more Chris Owusu's 77-yard kickoff
return on the first play of the game, to jun
ior Nate Whitaker's field goal with 11 sec
onds left, it was a dominant offensive and
special teams performance, with the
defense doing just enough to keep the
highly dangerous, quick-strike Oregon
attack at bay.

The Cardinal scored on nine of its 14
possessions, including an opening field
goal by Whitaker to give Stanford a 3-0
lead that it would never relinquish. Then,
in one of the more impressive, yet under
rated sequences of the game, the Cardinal
defense held Oregon, fresh off one of the
most impressive offensive outbursts in
recent program history, to a three-and-out
on its first drive. Stanford's offense got the
ball back and soon after, the Cardinal
opened up a 10-0 advantage.
