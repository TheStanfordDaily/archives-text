## Card ends Oregon's seven-game streak 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford football is going bowling.
Check that: No. 25 Stanford football is
going bowling.

In Jim Harbaugh's team's most defining
win to date, the Cardinal (6-3, 5-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) topped No. 7 Oregon (7-2,
5-1 Pac-10), 51-42, at home to reach the
postseason for the first time since 2001.
The win also placed Stanford back in the
rankings after an eight-year absence,
"This was the best opportunity in the
last 10 years to express who this team is as
a football team," Harbaugh said.
Unlike the USC upset two years ago,
when a squad in its first stages of rebuild
ing pulled out a miraculous win, Saturday's
victory was an emphatic, 60-minute state
ment that Stanford has a high-quality foot
ball program. Simply put, there was noth
ing miraculous about it.

In a contest where few gave the

Cardinal much of a chance, Stanford con
trolled the game throughout. From sopho
more Chris Owusu's 77-yard kickoff
return on the first play of the game, to jun
ior Nate Whitaker's field goal with 11 sec
onds left, it was a dominant offensive and
special teams performance, with the
defense doing just enough to keep the
highly dangerous, quick-strike Oregon
attack at bay.

The Cardinal scored on nine of its 14
possessions, including an opening field
goal by Whitaker to give Stanford a 3-0
lead that it would never relinquish. Then,
in one of the more impressive, yet under
rated sequences of the game, the Cardinal
defense held Oregon, fresh off one of the
most impressive offensive outbursts in
recent program history, to a three-and-out
on its first drive. Stanford's offense got the
ball back and soon after, the Cardinal
opened up a 10-0 advantage.

Seemingly unstoppable, Toby Gerhart rushed for a school-record 233 yards (and season-record 1,217 yards) while on his way to three touchdowns against the Ducks.

Students and fans rushed the field after the win to celebrate with Stanford team
members like cornerback Michael Thomas, who led the band's final 'All Right Now.'
"We weren't trying to think about
anything else but scoring," Harbaugh
said.

Much of the offensive output
came from three men: redshirt fresh
man quarterback Andrew Luck, sen
ior running back Toby Gerhart and
sophomore wide receiver Chris
Owusu.

Luck was eerily efficient: He com
pleted just 12 passes (on 20 throws),
but passed for 251 yards and two
touchdowns. Harbaugh and offensive
coordinator David Shaw identified
openings deep in the secondary early
in the game and Luck spent the rest
of the afternoon exploiting them. He
hit Owusu four times for at least 15
yards on each throw that included
a 31-yard touchdown and a 40-yard
post play made possible by an immac
ulately thrown ball.
"Those throws were nothing short
of incredible," Harbaugh said. "How
do you play better as a quarterback?
Who could have done better?"

But the star of the day was Ger
hart, who broke the school rushing
record with 223 yards on the ground.
He also tacked on three touchdowns.

"That's something I'll be able to
look at the rest of my life," Gerhart
said. "It's a team game. It's an honor
and I think everybody takes pride in
it."

Indeed, one of Stanford's biggest
advantages coming in was the physi
cality of its offensive attack versus the
swift but not terribly big Oregon de
fense. Gerhart, on 38 rushes, set the
tone and the Cardinal's traditional
power running plays, including pack
ages featuring as many as seven of
fensive linemen, worked to perfec
tion.

"Like a young Mike Tyson said,
'Your plan is only good until you get
hit in the mouth.' And that hap
pened out there today, but that's
where you go back and credit the

players," Harbaugh said.
"I think we got after them a little
bit," Gerhart said. "I think we just got
the better half of them today."
That being said, the game was still
a nail biter. After sophomore corner
back Michael Thomas sacked Ore
gon junior quarterback Jeremiah
Masoli on 4th down to end the third
quarter, Stanford appeared to enter
the final 15-minute period with a
commanding 17-point lead. But Ma
soli and the Ducks' offense refused to
acquiesce. He led two touchdown
drives in the final quarter and with
just under three minutes left, the Car
dinal's lead was cut to six.
But Stanford was able to drive
downfield and, with 15 seconds left,
Whitaker came in to attempt a 48-
yard field goal. He had missed from
closer in earlier in the fourth and the
coaching staff took some time to de
cide the right course of action. Even
tually, Harbaugh showed faith and
sent Whitaker out. His booming kick
split the uprights and iced the game
he was practically carried off the

field by his teammates.
"The offense got me into a posi
tion to do that and it gave me a sec
ond chance," Whitaker said. "That
was the most important kick I've ever
made by far."
"I just had a good feeling about
Whitaker and I just felt like he was
going to make it," Harbaugh said. "I
knew that was going to seal it and
make it a nine-point game so I just
went with that feeling."
Gerhart echoed these feelings on
a more general level.
"People were out there saying, 'I
can't believe you won.' But I told
them, 'you got to have faith,' you
know? We were confident there
was definitely never any fear going
into this game," he said.
That mentality will certainly per
sist into next week, when the Cardi
nal travels south to face No. 9 USC (7-
2,4-2 Pac-10).The Trojans have strug
gled lately they lost to Oregon and
barely beat Arizona State, a team
Stanford dominated. But USC is al
ways one of the most dangerous

schools in the conference and poses a
major roadblock in the Cardinal's
Rose Bowl hopes.
"Our goal is to win the Pac-10
championship and we are still alive
for that. We'll go next week down to
USC and play a great football team
on the road to keep those hopes
alive," Harbaugh said. "They can
spend 24 hours feeling good about
this, but then come back and get
ready for USC."

NOTES: Fullback Owen Marecic also
started at linebacker in place of the in
jured Clinton Snyder, but he was re
placed on defense by Nick Macaluso in
the first quarter... Luck is now first in
the nation in yards per attempt... Ger
hart is second in the country in rushing
yards and touchdowns... Stanford's
special teams held the dangerous Kenjon
Barrier to under 20 yards, on average, per
return. Owusu, by contrast, had just
under 40 yards per return.

GAME NOTES: After upsetting then-No. 8 Oregon
to end the Ducks' seven-game winning streak
last weekend, Stanford is riding a huge wave of
momentum (including a national ranking) going
into the meeting with the No. 11 Trojans. USC
lost to Oregon on Oct. 31, and the closest thing
they'll get to revenge is a win against the Cardi
nal. Stanford will look to pull off another upset,
but doing so in Los Angeles won't be easy.

Cornerback Michael Thomas sacked Ducks' QB Jeremiah Masoli, giving Thomas
reason to celebrate. The Card defense held the Ducks at bay, including standout
LaMichael James , who still managed 125 yards, but only one touchdown.
