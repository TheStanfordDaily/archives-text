# Sharks tracked off CA
## Researchers study great white migration patterns 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford scientists are learning a
great deal about great white sharks.
Scientists at the Hopkins Marine
Station have concluded that great white
sharks, like salmon, have a specific
migratory pattern. Their research, pub
lished in the scientific journal
Proceedings of the Royal Society B on
Nov. 4, also found that Pacific white
sharks, genetically distinct from other
great whites, are swimming in the San
Francisco Bay.

Prof. Barbara Block, who facilitated
and co-authored the study in collabora

tion with scientists from UC-Davis,
among others, compared the decade
long observation of great whites in the
Pacific Ocean to studies of lions and
tigers in Africa.
"We're doing [the study] on the
largest ocean in the planet it was a tall
task," Block said. She and other marine
scientists tagged a total of 179 great
white sharks using Pop Up Satellite
Archival Tags (PATs) and monitored
their swimming in the Pacific.
The PATs, according to doctoral stu
dent in biology, field project leader and
co-author Chris Perle, allowed for the
sharks to be tracked via satellite. Perle,
who helped attach approximately 20

tags to the sharks,
explained in an e-mail to
The Daily that each tag is
pre-programmed to "pop
off' the shark and send

data back for analysis. The sharks' travel
is then measured by the light and sea
surface temperature data.
Researchers found that great white
sharks travel from the central California
coast out into the open ocean to Hawai'i
and a nearby popular location dubbed
the "White Shark Cafe."
"What we learned the most about the
white sharks was that they were making
round trips 4,000 nautical mile trips,"
Block said. "But they were coming back

with precision to the
place we let them go."

In an e-mail to The Daily,
Bing Director in Human Biology Carol
Boggs said the research offered a clearer
conception of the relationship of sharks
to their environment.
"It is cool that we're discovering that
large marine organisms behave more
like what we're used to thinking of as
standard for large terrestrial animals,
