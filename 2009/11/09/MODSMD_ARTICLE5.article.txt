# Sharks tracked off CA
## Researchers study great white migration patterns 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford scientists are learning a
great deal about great white sharks.
Scientists at the Hopkins Marine
Station have concluded that great white
sharks, like salmon, have a specific
migratory pattern. Their research, pub
lished in the scientific journal
Proceedings of the Royal Society B on
Nov. 4, also found that Pacific white
sharks, genetically distinct from other
great whites, are swimming in the San
Francisco Bay.

Prof. Barbara Block, who facilitated
and co-authored the study in collabora

tion with scientists from UC-Davis,
among others, compared the decade
long observation of great whites in the
Pacific Ocean to studies of lions and
tigers in Africa.
"We're doing [the study] on the
largest ocean in the planet it was a tall
task," Block said. She and other marine
scientists tagged a total of 179 great
white sharks using Pop Up Satellite
Archival Tags (PATs) and monitored
their swimming in the Pacific.
The PATs, according to doctoral stu
dent in biology, field project leader and
co-author Chris Perle, allowed for the
sharks to be tracked via satellite. Perle,
who helped attach approximately 20

tags to the sharks,
explained in an e-mail to
The Daily that each tag is
pre-programmed to "pop
off' the shark and send

data back for analysis. The sharks' travel
is then measured by the light and sea
surface temperature data.
Researchers found that great white
sharks travel from the central California
coast out into the open ocean to Hawai'i
and a nearby popular location dubbed
the "White Shark Cafe."
"What we learned the most about the
white sharks was that they were making
round trips 4,000 nautical mile trips,"
Block said. "But they were coming back

with precision to the
place we let them go."

In an e-mail to The Daily,
Bing Director in Human Biology Carol
Boggs said the research offered a clearer
conception of the relationship of sharks
to their environment.
"It is cool that we're discovering that
large marine organisms behave more
like what we're used to thinking of as
standard for large terrestrial animals,

with defined geography for the popu
lation, and even something resem
bling individual 'home ranges,"' Boggs
said.

"This blows the idea out of the
water that the ocean is a vast, trackless
melting pot," she added.

Great white sharks leave from "hot
spots" on the shore around where sea
lions and elephant seals gather to
feed. Using additional acoustic tags
acting as a microchip that can be
transmitted from 300 meters away, the
sharks' shore movements were
tracked by receivers sunk at the bot
tom of the ocean.

"We call it 'homing infidelity,'"
Block added. "Just like a salmon going
up the stream, we didn't know white
sharks had a home spot."
According to postdoctoral fellow
and co-author Salvador Jorgensen, sci
entists were already familiar with the
fact that white sharks migrate. The
main discovery is the consistency in
these migratory routes, which
Jorgensen called "a virtual highway,"
and that the sharks did not venture on
to other areas of the Pacific.
"This was further confirmed with
genetics data based on maternally
inherited mtDNA markers, suggesting
that we are looking at a distinct popu
lation that is demographically isolated
from other known populations of
white sharks in the Indo-Pacific (i.e.
South Africa and Australia/New
Zealand)," Jorgensen wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.

Geneticist Carol Reeb, a research
associate in biology and co-author,
also determined that Pacific white
sharks are genetically distinct within
their species. She found the difference
by comparing a previous study of
great white shark genetic sequences
from South Africa and New Zealand
with the data Jorgensen collected.
The population of white sharks off
of the California coast has a 200,000
year-old ancestry with Australian

sharks, migrating during the
Pleistocene epoch period at the same
time humans migrated out of Africa.
"[The Pacific white sharks] didn't
really go anywhere else which was
interesting because these are highly
migratory animals and they have the
potential to go anywhere in theory,"
Reeb said.

Male sharks were previously con
sidered to be free-roaming.
Conversely, female sharks, according
to Reeb, are known to be philopatric,
meaning they return to their original
birthplaces. This study refutes the
original behavioral predictions and
confirms a pattern among both sexes.
Reeb is currently working on a
similar study with Mexican sharks to
determine if they display distinct
behaviors and potentially different
genes as well. Boggs, who works in
population dynamics, finds the poten
tial for further species conservation
in this genetic discovery.
"The result that the 'local' popula
tion is genetically distinct, with a very
old separation date from other popu
lations of the same species, is both
interesting and surprising," Boggs
said. "It indicates that these sharks
may be adapted to the environment
of the northeastern Pacific, which has
implications for conservation
efforts."

The tracking devices made an
additional observation that many
found to be more surprising. Great
white sharks were detected swim
ming as far in the San Francisco Bay
as the Golden Gate Bridge.
However, many of the scientists
working on the study were not at all
astonished with this finding.
"We learned this only because a
row of sensors set up by our col
leagues to detect salmon migrations
was compatible with our tags,"
Jorgensen wrote. "So it was unantici
pated but not entirely surprising."
Five out of 75 great white sharks
were detected up to one mile inside
the Bay, chalking up to 0.07 percent of
the total tag detections in the study.
