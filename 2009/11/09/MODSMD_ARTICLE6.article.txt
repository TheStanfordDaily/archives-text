### VIVIANA ARCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Main Quad was abuzz this
weekend with over 500 high school stu
dents participating in the 2009 Model
United Nations (MUN) Conference at
Stanford.

The conference, which began
Friday afternoon and ended on
Sunday, was staffed by more than 80
Stanford students, according to event

organizer and MUN Secretary-
General Peter Davis 'll.
The conference had 22 different com
mittees, each with two to three Stanford
students serving as staff members. Davis
said that each committee also conferred
awards to its best delegates.
Although a plethora of other
schools organize and invite student del
egates to their respective MUN events,
Stanford's conference incorporates a
variety of unique features to its event.

"Stanford Model UN Conference is
unique because of its small committees
and creative crises that integrate both
live action, like kidnappings, speeches,
assassinations, with other crises dealing
with videos, radio recordings and news
articles," Davis said.

Stanford's conference places a par
ticular emphasis on the small commit
tee size, which organizers believe
allows for a more personal atmosphere
and more time for the participants to

interact with Stanford students.
"We have 22 committees for 550
delegates. This means that each com
mittee is far smaller than most MUN
conferences," Davis said. "Schools like
Harvard have committees of 200-plus
people whereas the largest Stanford
committee has 50 people and most
have around 20."

Spanning three days, the conference
