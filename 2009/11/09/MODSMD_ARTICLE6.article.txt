## University hosts Model United Nations Conference 
### VIVIANA ARCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Main Quad was abuzz this
weekend with over 500 high school stu
dents participating in the 2009 Model
United Nations (MUN) Conference at
Stanford.

The conference, which began
Friday afternoon and ended on
Sunday, was staffed by more than 80
Stanford students, according to event

organizer and MUN Secretary-
General Peter Davis 'll.
The conference had 22 different com
mittees, each with two to three Stanford
students serving as staff members. Davis
said that each committee also conferred
awards to its best delegates.
Although a plethora of other
schools organize and invite student del
egates to their respective MUN events,
Stanford's conference incorporates a
variety of unique features to its event.

"Stanford Model UN Conference is
unique because of its small committees
and creative crises that integrate both
live action, like kidnappings, speeches,
assassinations, with other crises dealing
with videos, radio recordings and news
articles," Davis said.

Stanford's conference places a par
ticular emphasis on the small commit
tee size, which organizers believe
allows for a more personal atmosphere
and more time for the participants to

interact with Stanford students.
"We have 22 committees for 550
delegates. This means that each com
mittee is far smaller than most MUN
conferences," Davis said. "Schools like
Harvard have committees of 200-plus
people whereas the largest Stanford
committee has 50 people and most
have around 20."

Spanning three days, the conference
situated delegates in the various
rooms of the Main Quad's History
Corner, where anxious and formally
dressed high school students from
across the country prepared speech
es and arguments with their respec
tive teams.

For one group of students from
Mills High School in Millbrae, Calif.,
the experience was overwhelming but
positive.

"It's really nerve-wrecking in the
beginning, but it usually gets better
once you attend a couple of commit
tee sessions," said high school stu
dent Sunny Chung. "Our team
talked a lot about tensions between
Syria and Lebanon and the death of
Lebanon's Prime Minister."

Jenny Chin, also from Mills High,
enjoyed the interactions with students
from other high schools.
"It's nice seeing other kids from
different states," Chin said.
"Everybody seems really nice and
very smart."
Although a large portion of stu
dents attending came from California
schools, Stanford's conference was
able to attract not only schools from
across the country but international
ones as well.

"A majority of schools are from
California, but schools travel from
Boston, Texas, New Mexico, Nevada,
Arizona and other states as well. We
have several international schools,
one from Mexico City, one from
South Korea and one from Nigeria,"
Davis said. "We also have several
schools from Canada."

While the students had long days,
with committee sessions usually
averaging more than three hours,

more relaxed events included a dele
gate reception on Saturday night
which included music from Stanford
groups and food.
"I love the atmosphere that
Stanford MUN was able to provide,"
said Garim Qu, another student from
Mills High. "It makes the event less
stressful."
And the fact that the conference
took place in one of the country's
leading institutions wasn't lost on
some of the student delegates.
"I love that it's at Stanford,"
Chung said. "I love this school."
The conference's Closing
Ceremonies, aside from formally
ending a weekend spent conversing
on the conflicts, events and principal
actors of the international arena,
provided awards to the highest-scor
ing individuals and delegations.
