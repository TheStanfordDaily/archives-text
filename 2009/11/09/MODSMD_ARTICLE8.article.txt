## FAKES & PAINS 
### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG 
It happens to the best of us. You hear about an assign
ment in advance, promise yourself you'll prepare early
and then spend a week griping about what you know
you should be doing. But come exam day or paper
deadline, all you have is a blank Microsoft Word docu
ment and a vitamin B-enriched energy shot.
What do you do?
A. this never happens to you (don't lie)
B. nothing
C. cram
D. fake sick
To those of you who chose option D, you're not alone. As
the quarter enters its eighth week, lecture attendance across
campus has experienced a visible decline, especially for class
es before noon. Even in discussion-based seminars, it is not
uncommon for one or two students to be missing at a given
time.
One freshman who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
explained why students might use this year's swine flu para
noia to their advantage in order to stay home "sick."
"I don't believe in skipping class unless you really, really
have to do work for other classes," she said. "[But] if you
were to, say, fake that you had swine flu because you had a
paper to do and then you had a reason not to go to class, then
that would be fine."
Another freshman who also spoke on the condition of
anonymity, was quick to point out the fine line between fak
ing sick and simply not going to class.
"What if you just didn't wake up? Does that count?" he
asked. "I mean, it's not like I chose to not wake up, it's just I
was asleep."
Despite this omnipresent flippancy toward attendance,
not all students agree that it is okay to skip classes. One fresh
man described faking sick as "almost stupid." Other under
graduates vowed that they had never lied to get out of assign
ments, even in high school.
"I feel like if people lean on [faking sick] as away to get
out of assignments just because they didn't manage their
time well, then I don't think it's necessarily a great strategy in
order to succeed," said Morgan Baskett 'll, Peer Health
Educator. "In the end, it's going to come back to bite them."
Clearly, there's a split between students on the trend of
faking sick. But what do the administration and faculty have
to say?

Earlier this year, Stanford University Provost John
Etchemendy sent an e-mail to professors telling them to be
flexible and to trust their students. He expounded on his e
mail in an interview with The Daily.

"Given that students (or their parents) are paying so
much for a Stanford education, I can't imagine why they
would be tempted to skip the very same classes they are pay
ing so dearly for, unless they have a legitimate reason to,"
Etchemendy wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "Of course, stu
dents might be tempted to miss class if, say, they are unpre
pared for an exam or have not completed an assignment
which are not legitimate reasons. To those students, I would
simply point out that it is a violation of the fundamental stan
dard not to go to class and then to lie about the reason for the
absence."

In spite of this, some professors have made a case that
additional attendance policies would not be worth enforcing.
One such example is English Prof. Chris Rovee,
"Probably deep down inside we all think it's a big deal,
but as professors, we're pretty powerless," Rovee said. "It's
just not our job to read students' minds and determine
whether they're lying or not."

Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) Postdoctoral
Teaching Fellow Dan Contreras agreed that it is not his pri
ority to monitor why people play hooky.
"I'm not very interested in knowing if they're lying,"
Contreras said. "You're all grown-ups. If you want to skip
class, skip class."

This does not mean that Stanford professors don't
care about class attendance. In fact, the
opposite is true. .
According to Rovee, absenteeism
can negatively affect a class
dynamic not just for those who
are absent, but also for the devot
ed attendees. While this has been
an issue only once in his

nine years of teaching, he still warned against the temptation
to skip classes.
"The hard part about it is that with the quarter system, we
have a very small number of class meetings each term, com
pared with schools that are on the semester system," Rovee
said. "Each class meeting is important and, especially in a
seminar, you can't replace that kind of experience."
Contreras also insisted that students who choose to miss
class, for whatever the reason, "will suffer the consequences
at some level." He remains optimistic, however, that at some
point, nearly all students will learn how to manage college
life so as to avoid having to fake sick.
"When I was an undergrad, I think I missed a lot of class
es, especially the fall of my freshman year," Contreras remi
nisced. "Then at some point I figured out that it was kind of
dumb to be in college if I wasn't going to class, because you're
there because you're interested at some level. I barely missed
a class after that. People will figure it out."
