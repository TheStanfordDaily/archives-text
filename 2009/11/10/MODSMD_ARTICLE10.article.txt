## Senators argue over food funding for meeting 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
Food for all, including President Hennessy.

That was the decision this weekend from
ASSU Undergraduate Senate members, who
agreed via e-mail to contribute $l5O to cater a
meeting Wednesday with the University presi
dent, ASSU executives, the Graduate Student
Council, senators and the public.
Internally, however, there is some dispute
among senators over whether the move aligns
with the body's new rules on student groups'
food spending.

Alex Katz 'l2, a member of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, which authorizes
student groups' line-item funding, said that
under the new policy, food must be "necessary or
especially relevant for an event's success" in
order to be funded.

That policy is in addition to a long-standing
rule prohibiting regular meeting food expendi
tures for student groups, Katz said.
Since August, the committee has recommend
ed about 35 percent, or $30,000, of the total
money that student groups have requested for
event food, according to Appropriations Chair
Anton Zietsman 'l2.

During the previous fiscal year, the commit
tee recommended about 73 percent, or $95,000.

Late last week, Senate Chair Varun Sivaram
'll asked senators via e-mail whether they
would agree to foot half the catering bill from
the Senate discretionary fund. The GSC had
already budgeted $l5O for food, as it does for its
regular weekly meetings.

Some, like Michael Cruz 'l2, were amenable
to the idea.

"Seeing as this joint meeting happens only
once a year, I see no reason why we shouldn't
pitch in for meeting food," Cruz said.
"Furthermore, in my view, this expenditure does
not contradict our current funding policies."
Zachary Warma 'll, also opinions editor for
The Daily, agreed, saying, "a small meal at the
formal joint legislative session with the presi
dent, I believe, is not a flagrant expenditure of
our funds."

But other senators disagreed.
"I do not view meeting food as the best way
to use discretionary funds to benefit the student
body," Katz said. "Feeding ourselves doesn't
strike me as one of the roles that we were elect
ed to perform ... [a]nd yes, I'd say it does con
tradict current policies. We do not fund meeting
food. This is a meeting."

Adam Creasman 'll dissented, too.
"While I am sorely tempted to eat delicious
Treehouse fare on the student body's dime, I
think it's pretty clear that we should not,"

Creasman said. (The Senate discretionary budg
et is funded by the ASSU endowment payout,
not student fees, according to Katz.)

Lee Jackson 'l2 added: "I think we need to
consider the message we're sending when we
fund our own food and turn down everyone
else's."

GSC Co-Chair Eric Osborne, a third-year law
student, chimed in, noting that the GSC would
pay for food at Wednesday's meeting regardless
of the senators' decision.

"The question is whether the Senate wants to
have food, too," Osborne said. "I think it would
be bizarre to have food at the meeting but to say
that only GSC members can eat it. Hence, the
recommendation that the Senate join us for this
one-time, special meeting and have food for its
members, too."

Sivaram announced Sunday afternoon that
he would transfer the money to the GSC from
the Senate's $4,500 discretionary fund. The
GSC's food money comes from its political
budget, also funded by the ASSU endowment
payout.

The joint legislative meeting with President
Hennessy is set for Wednesday at 6 p.m. in the
Black Community Services Center community
room.
