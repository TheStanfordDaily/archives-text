## Prof. Church co-publishes study supporting cosmological model 
### ANN TYLER MOSES 
A study co-led by physics Prof. Sarah
Church has provided some of the best evi
dence yet gathered about the structure of
the universe. Published in The
Astrophysical Journal on Nov. 1, the article
presents data making compelling support
for the accuracy of today's standard cos
mological model, which states that the uni
verse is composed of 95 percent dark ener
gy and five percent ordinary matter.
Church, who is also a professor by cour
tesy of particle physics and astrophysics,
teamed up with Prof. Walter Gear of
Cardiff University in the United Kingdom
for the project. Researchers in the U.K.
built the telescope, while Stanford's Kavli

Institute for Particle Astrophysics and
Cosmology (KIPAC) provided a camera
sensitive to millimeter waves of radiation.
Church serves as deputy director at
KIPAC.
The device amassed data at the South
Pole from 2005 to 2007, revealing radiation
left over from the Big Bang that has since
been polarized (had its light scattered by
electrons). This landscape of radiation is
called the cosmic microwave background
(CMB).
The patterns made by the CMB's polar
ization show the distribution of matter in
the early universe. Their results supported
the expectation that approximately 70 per
cent of the universe is made up of dark
energy, approximately 25 percent of dark

matter and only approximately five per
cent is "normal" matter.
"There's a very specific prediction of
what the polarization should look like, and
what our experiment did was verify that
prediction," Church said. "So, we didn't
make a new discovery in the sense of find
ing something unexpected, but we did
another very important check of the stan
dard model, and this was the first time that
check has been done in that much detail."
Dark energy and dark matter are con
tinued objects of study for scientists, with
many competing hypotheses and models to
explain their nature.
Church became interested in her cur
rent work as a graduate student at
Cambridge in the late 'Bos.

"People were very adamant that they
understood the concepts of the universe
that it was flat, that it contained just ordi
nary matter and dark matter," Church said.
"Dark energy came as a surprise."
Roger Blandford, director of KIPAC,
applauded the accuracy of the measure
ments, since microwave background obser
vations require more technical expertise
than almost any others in the field of astro
physics and cosmology.

"We at KIPAC are thrilled by the quali
ty of the results and very excited for Sarah
and her colleagues in being able to pull off
this exquisite set of measurements," he
said.

The experiment is rife with implications
for astrophysics and cosmology. For one, it

has allowed for the possibility of studying
inflation the theory of the exponential
expansion of the universe soon after the
Big Bang in greater detail. Church and
others in the physics department are work
ing on a new generation of experiments,
which study CMB polarization in even
greater depth, to learn more about infla
tion.

"Had this experiment not worked, it
would not have been possible to go to the
next level, but now I think it is," Blandford
said. "And now we've opened the door
toward investigations of very much earlier
times in the expanding universe."
