## EDITORIAL Bailed-out CEOs cannot expect bonuses or awards 
### 
For the first time this year, our economy
has started to show signs of recovery.
For millions of people nationwide, the
recession has been a dark, hopeless time.
Americans have fallen behind in obligations
and sacrificed many comforts in life, but signs
are finally starting to point up. Yesterday, the
Dow reached its highest point this year. Over
the past few weeks, the earnings reports have
been providing mainly positive news like
profitability in the sectors that were affected
the most by the recession. Thus, the signs that
have been coming from Wall Street provide
substantial hope for those individuals waiting
for a break.

But some events on the horizon do not in
spire hope, or confidence, at all. As major cor
porations begin to see profits for the first time
in several quarters, so, too, will the executives
of these companies. To these individuals, the
windfall compensation that they receive in
yearly bonuses is a just compensation for
their performance. But to the average Amer
ican, this compensation is far too excessive.

The Obama administration has taken
steps to ensure that the executives of those
companies that accepted bailout money will
not receive bonuses like those that corporate
America was notorious for prior to this reces
sion. Some will argue that this is a good deci
sion, and some will clearly question it, but it is
certainly an unprecedented decision for the
government to attempt to fairly value the
work of executives in private companies. Ex
ecutives are obviously not happy about this
kind of intrusion by the government, and
have attempted to draw attention away from
this issue, understandably pleased with the
system that was in place before the recession.
The Editorial Board recognizes that this
economic recession has irrevocably changed
the way in which we judge economic institu
tions. This recession has demonstrated to us
just how dangerously personal greed can af

feet the greater economy. In this economic re
covery, it is necessary to emphatically say that
the American economy is not driven forward
by executives of companies, but by each indi
vidual worker's output. In the pre-recession
economy, many executives were paid exorbi
tant amounts of money to do sub-par work, to
put it mildly. Many of the policies and actions
of banking executives, in fact, helped trigger
the credit collapse that has put America is this
predicament. Naturally, there should exist a
difference in compensation for individuals at
different levels and responsibilities, but when
an individual is drastically overcompensated,
it is inefficient and harmful to the economy.
Those financial and corporate institutions
that have received bailout money have been
granted an unprecedented second chance fi
nanced by tax-payers. To accept bailout fund
ing from the American public and then use
that money to finance lifestyles far surpassing
the luxury of the average American is a gross
injustice. Having been saved from disaster
and bankruptcy, bailed-out CEOs must un
derstand that they cannot expect to be heavi
ly rewarded.

Many members of the Stanford community
aspire to build a significant amount of wealth
during their professional careers, and expect to
be compensated fairly. We do not want any
thing to interfere with that fair compensation.
But we do feel that today is an important time
for every business in our country to examine
the compensation schemes within their busi
ness and evaluate its efficiency and fairness.
This recession was largely a result of greed
at the highest levels of the economy and wors
ened by the already poor distribution of
wealth in the United States. If the goal is to
make our economy better than it was before
this recession and not just return it to pre
recession levels we must understand that
great wealth is a reward and luxury, not an en
titlement.
