# A 						BROAD ABROAD
## The 						Search for Sauerkraut and an Ethnic Identity 
### Molly Spaeth 
£ £ I would literally pay seven
L-'curo for sauerkraut right now." Al-
A though at first glance seven euro
may not seem like a high price to pay, when
you factor in the fact that I had spent only
two euros on basic sustenance the entire
weekend I was in Grenada (I'm on a budget),
a willingness to pay seven euros for sauer
kraut basically meant we were in love.

Sauerkraut. I have been in Berlin for the
last four days and still have yet to find it. The
seemingly-disgusting, delicious, pale pickled
cabbage that has brought me so much joy on so
many occasions in the beloved home state of
North Dakota has been nowhere to be found
in Germany, the beloved home country.
I am 50 percent German, so hopefully this
explains my torrid love affair with sauer
kraut. However, if you had asked me to de
fine my ethnicity five months ago, I wouldn't
have been able to stutter out any intelligible
response other than, "Well, I'm white, I was
confirmed Catholic and I don't tan very easi
ly, so I think I'm like one-sixteenth Irish. Or,
at least that's what my mom used to tell me
when she wanted me to put on more SPF."
Then, last spring quarter, I took a class by
Tomas Jimenez entitled "Immigration in a
Changing United States." In this class, we fo
cused on how immigration has affected un
derstandings and definitions of race, ethnici
ty and nation. In lecture, Jimenez defined an
ethnic group as "a collective within a larger
society having real or putative common an
cestry, memories of a shared historical past,
and a cultural focus on one or more symbol
ic elements defined as the epitome of their
peoplehood."
Our in-class discussions were fascinating.
Jimenez would propose open-ended ques
tions, inviting my classmates to explain how
their ethnic background has shaped their in
teractions with other people. There were
some Persians who had been labeled Mexi
can, and there were some Mexicans who had
been discriminated against as a result of their
less-than-fluent Spanish. Although every
one's story was different, a common thread
running throughout each person's testimony
was a firmly-rooted understanding of their
respective ethnic background.
I, on the other hand, felt like a minority. Al
though yes, I am technically a member of the
white majority, in that class I had no idea who
I was. During the first discussion, Jimenez
asked all of us to define our ethnicity. While
some of my classmates could spit out exact
percentages comprising their whole, all I
could muster out was "I'm from North Dako
ta, and I think I'm either German or Irish. But
I'm DEFINITELY North Dakotan."
Sweet, Molly.That's a state, not an ethnicity.

Although I know it sounds ludicrous, my
ethnicity had never been a defining factor for
me. Looking back, you'd think that my "real
or putative common ancestry" would have
been one of the only ways to define myself
among the mass of other white, Christian,
middle-class kids I went to school with in the
upper Midwest. But for some reason, per
haps because we were practically all white,
Christian, middle-class kids, I took the im
portance of understanding the "cultural
focus defining the epitome of my people
hood" for granted.

It wasn't until I arrived at Stanford that I
started to yearn for some kind of cultural
identity. This was the first time I had been in
situations where I wasn't in the majority, the
first time I had been in situations where peo
ple didn't know exactly where I was came
from, and the first time I had met people had
never tasted sauerkraut.

It wasn't until I came to the Farm that I re
alized that I had a responsibility to represent
not only my state, but my ethnic group. For
one of the first times in my life, my half-Ger
man, Midwest blood actually made me
unique, and it was only then that I realized its
importance in defining who I was.
Granted, although I have at least now rec
ognized its importance, a basic understand
ing of some of the more rudimentary compo
nents of my heritage still elude me. As Pamon
and I had breakfast with his German host
mom the other day, I mentioned to her in
passing that I was half-German.
"Oh, so then you know the language,
right?"

I looked down ashamedly at my croissant
and nutella and replied that no, I only knew
about five words and how much I love
sauerkraut.

"Ah, that's alright," she said. And with
that, she and her two sons proceeded to teach
Pamon and me the words for the breakfast
foods spread out on the table.
Alright, so maybe my ethnic identity has
eluded me for the past 20 years. But I guaran
tee you I'm going to make up for it in the next
20, even if it's just over vocab lessons at
breakfast. And mark my words, Germany,
even if you have to drag me kicking and
screaming across the border, I'm not leaving
the motherland until I find myself some
sauerkraut.

BOSP's Stanford in Berlin program and hap
pen to know the best place to get sauerkraut in
Germany? Or ANY place to get sauerkraut in
Germany? Please, e-mail mspaeth@stanford.

Pamon and me the words for the breakfast
foods spread out on the table.
Alright, so maybe my ethnic identity has
eluded me for the past 20 years. But I guaran
tee you I'm going to make up for it in the next
20, even if it's just over vocab lessons at
breakfast. And mark my words, Germany,
even if you have to drag me kicking and
screaming across the border, I'm not leaving
the motherland until I find myself some
sauerkraut.

Have you been a program participant in
BOSP's Stanford in Berlin program and hap
pen to know the best place to get sauerkraut in
Germany? Or ANY place to get sauerkraut in
Germany? Please, e-mail mspaeth@stanford.
edu to receive infinite thanks and a nuanced de
scription of its deliciousness.
