# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Why a Male Community Center is not so outlandish 
### Danny Crichton 
They represent 40 percent of today's col
lege graduates (and only 44 percent of
incoming students). They will soon
hold a minority of the nation's jobs a de
velopment that has already taken place in
many urban cities. Future job growth is tak
ing place in health care and education not
construction.
Men are living in a world far different
from the one that existed just a few decades
ago. The nation has finally moved toward a
more equal coexistence of the genders, but in
the process, it has transformed gender roles.
From the breadwinner of the family to the
parent who tucks in the kids at night, roles
are amorphous like they have never been be
fore.
Unfortunately, Stanford and most univer
sities do not provide an outlet to ask ques
tions from a male perspective. We have six
community centers on campus, but none of
them have the defined mission to address the
issues that men are likely to face. In response,
I urge Stanford to establish a male communi
ty center.
According to Stanford's Undergraduate
Life page, "Stanford Community Centers
provide a gateway to intellectual, cultural
and leadership opportunities for all Stanford
students." In pursuit of these missions, com
munity centers hold programming events
and provide advising resources to ask ques
tions related to different identified groups.
These centers are not zero sum. The exis
tence of another community center should
only enhance current ones by covering an
other demographic group (and a large one at
that). The beauty of the community centers is
their synergistic nature, and a male commu
nity center will not undermine this system.
A male community center would enhance
the University community first and foremost
by planning programmatic initiatives. Soci
ety's perceptions of men are inconsistent
with reality, yet society's image follows all
men. How do men handle the situation and
improve it?
Another set of topics would be relation
ships and their long-term issues. How should
men approach dating, marriage and parent
ing? What constitutes a wholesome relation
ship versus one that is exploitive? Similar to
events held at the Women's and LGBT Cen
ter, a male community center could ask diffi
cult but important questions that affect all of
us.
In addition to programming, community
centers provide a safe place for open dia
logue on sensitive issues. At a male commu

nity center, such issues may range from men
tal health and sexuality to relationships and
sexual relations. An open forum for these is
sues would be a strong asset for the Stanford
community.
I understand that there are many who dis
agree with me about the need for this kind of
center. It is easy to stereotype such a center
as a football-watching, beer-drinking, burger
eating male kingdom. But such stereotypes
can equally be applied to other community
centers does the Women's Community
Center sponsor make-up days or the LGBT
Center talk about the latest fashions? Such
stereotypes are equally repugnant across all
groups.
Another argument I have heard is that
such a community center would really be a
"White Male Community Center" as a recent
Stanford Flipside article headlined. Such a
case could also be used with the Women's
Community Center is it really a "White
Women's Community Center?" No, it is not,
and such an argument is insensitive at best to
minority males and females.
A strong argument against a male com
munity center is that fraternities provide sim
ilar programming and community opportu
nities for males. Since there are already living
spaces for those looking for male communi

ty, what is the point of having a dedicated
center? If this were a concern, why do any of
the community centers exist? Ujamaa, Casa
Zapata, Okada, Muwekma-tah-ruk, Roth
and (unofficially) Terra can certainly be the
home of their respective communities.
The reason centers exist is to create a ve
hicle outside of student residences to find
support on very personal and oftentimes un
comfortable situations. There has to be a
place in between friends and CAPS for this,
and community centers offer that environ
ment. One should not have to live in a frater
nity anymore than one should have to live in
Roth to discuss gender issues.
Financing will be difficult. Community
centers were certainly not spared from the
budget cuts last spring, and there is little ex
cess money lying around. I do not imply that
a male community center can be built in the
next few months it is certainly a long-term
goal. But to argue against equality because of
money smacks of hypocrisy.
Stanford's community centers provide a
wealth of resources for their respective
groups. A male community center would be a
tremendous addition to this already strong
system, providing mental health resources
through discussion and programmatic events
that can enliven the lives of half of campus. It
is time the University support equal access,
and it is time the University support the cre
ation of a male community center.
