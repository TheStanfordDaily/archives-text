Re: "VSO funding plea divides U. G. senators,"
Nov. 4,2009
Dear Editor,
I certainly did not intend to become a cen
ter of contention on campus. I disagree with
Ms. Richard's description of my request as
"pleading."
That said, mistakes were indeed made re
garding our funding on both sides. Our
group made some errors in budgeting. The
Web site resources were broken and inacces
sible. Additionally, three weeks past from our
request submission and a response from Ap

propriations. These joint contributions com
pounded to make our situation quite rough.
I disagree with the antagonistic frame of
the article. Instead, we hope to take a joint
problem-solving approach and secure the
funding we need through future requests
with the Appropriations Committee.
I'm glad our situation could serve to illus
trate current issues with the system such that
other groups will not face similar circum
stances.
Sincerely,
TOMMY TOBIN
Co-Director, Stanford Project on Hunger (SPOON)
