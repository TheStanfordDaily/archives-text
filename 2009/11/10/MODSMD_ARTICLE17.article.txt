## Head-to-Head: Can the MLS popularize soccer in America? Pro soccer can change America's mind 
### Sam Svoboda 
After trading in my (unpaid)
Daily column for (paid) beat
writing two years ago, I have to
say I thought my column-writ
ing days were over what can I say, I'm
too lazy to even come up with column
ideas on a weekly basis. But when my fel
low staffer Kabir "Smiles" Sahwney chal
lenged me to a head-to-head on MLS, as
the Daily's resident soccer connoisseur
(sounds classier than fanatic, right?) I had
no choice. In the sage words of Andy
Bernard, it was on like a prawn that yawns
at dawn.

From what I gather, "Smiles" has a few
main points: that the "Beckham
experiment" was a failure,
that MLS needs to stop
expanding and that the
people in charge of
growing the sport
need to focus more
on European soc
cer than the do
mestic league.
Now, I don't want
to call him a hater,
but the state of \
soccer in the Unit
ed States is certainly
nowhere near as trou
bled as he makes it out
to be.
On the first count, I'm no

Beckham fan, but it's hard to call his
time in MLS a failure, if only because his
time here is not over. Yes, it's true that his
performance, both on and off the field,
has been far from inspiring at times. But
this year, he has seemingly gelled with his
teammates and, lo and behold, the
Galaxy are one of the favorites to win the
MLS Cup.
Even if he is ultimately unable to earn a
trophy for the Galaxy, his time here has
certainly been a boost both economically
and promotionally. He has put MLS in the
headlines, opened the door for other tal
ented Designated Players to come in and
has been a huge sell for both merchandise
and for seats wherever the Galaxy play
(more on that later). If anyone was looking
for him to single-handedly put soccer into
the American mainstream overnight, they
might be disappointed with the Beckham
experiment. But you can't really call it a
failure quite yet.
On the point of expansion being the
wrong move right now, let's look at the
league's newest expansion team, Seattle
Sounders FC (note: we'll save the debate
about franchise names for another time).
The Sounders have been a huge success,
averaging over 30,000 fans per home
game, more than a whole lot of teams in
Europe. This is almost double the league
average of 16,037. The next teams in terms
of home attendance are more than 10,000
fans below Seattle that would be Beck
ham's Galaxy (who incidentally have the
highest away match attendance) and
Toronto FC, another recent expansion
club. On the field, Seattle won the US
Open Cup this year and is still in the MLS
Cup Playoffs. Now I'm not saying that all
future expansion teams will definitely be
this successful, but looking at the
Sounders, it's tough to say expansion is
