## Head-to-Head: Can the MLS popularize soccer in America? Pro soccer can change America's mind 
### Sam Svoboda 
After trading in my (unpaid)
Daily column for (paid) beat
writing two years ago, I have to
say I thought my column-writ
ing days were over what can I say, I'm
too lazy to even come up with column
ideas on a weekly basis. But when my fel
low staffer Kabir "Smiles" Sahwney chal
lenged me to a head-to-head on MLS, as
the Daily's resident soccer connoisseur
(sounds classier than fanatic, right?) I had
no choice. In the sage words of Andy
Bernard, it was on like a prawn that yawns
at dawn.

From what I gather, "Smiles" has a few
main points: that the "Beckham
experiment" was a failure,
that MLS needs to stop
expanding and that the
people in charge of
growing the sport
need to focus more
on European soc
cer than the do
mestic league.
Now, I don't want
to call him a hater,
but the state of \
soccer in the Unit
ed States is certainly
nowhere near as trou
bled as he makes it out
to be.
On the first count, I'm no

Beckham fan, but it's hard to call his
time in MLS a failure, if only because his
time here is not over. Yes, it's true that his
performance, both on and off the field,
has been far from inspiring at times. But
this year, he has seemingly gelled with his
teammates and, lo and behold, the
Galaxy are one of the favorites to win the
MLS Cup.
Even if he is ultimately unable to earn a
trophy for the Galaxy, his time here has
certainly been a boost both economically
and promotionally. He has put MLS in the
headlines, opened the door for other tal
ented Designated Players to come in and
has been a huge sell for both merchandise
and for seats wherever the Galaxy play
(more on that later). If anyone was looking
for him to single-handedly put soccer into
the American mainstream overnight, they
might be disappointed with the Beckham
experiment. But you can't really call it a
failure quite yet.
On the point of expansion being the
wrong move right now, let's look at the
league's newest expansion team, Seattle
Sounders FC (note: we'll save the debate
about franchise names for another time).
The Sounders have been a huge success,
averaging over 30,000 fans per home
game, more than a whole lot of teams in
Europe. This is almost double the league
average of 16,037. The next teams in terms
of home attendance are more than 10,000
fans below Seattle that would be Beck
ham's Galaxy (who incidentally have the
highest away match attendance) and
Toronto FC, another recent expansion
club. On the field, Seattle won the US
Open Cup this year and is still in the MLS
Cup Playoffs. Now I'm not saying that all
future expansion teams will definitely be
this successful, but looking at the
Sounders, it's tough to say expansion is

killing the league.
As for the final point, I'd argue that
Americans already have a large and
growing amount of access to top-level
European and international soccer.
Now I'll admit, I'm a bit biased here.
I'm an American who has watched far
too much European soccer. How do I
know? For example, my hurling team
mates made fun of me last week for
calling my cleats "boots" and count
less "Britishisms" in my women's soc
cer articles over the past few years
have been Americanized by other ed
itors at the Daily. (As a side note, if
there is a single team that proves that

Americans can play beautiful soccer,
it is our women's soccer team. You
don't have to read one of my articles
on them, but just watch them play
trust me, they're that good.)

Still, I think even an American who
doesn't live and breathe soccer could
tell you that foreign soccer coverage
here has been growing immensely in
the past few years. Just look at the titan
of the American sports landscape,
ESPN, which grabbed UEFA Champi
ons League rights for a few years and
now is broadcasting England's Pre
mier League and Spain's La Liga on
weekends, in addition to other interna
tional leagues. And while it did involve
the US national team, let's not forget
that the Confederations Cup the
Confederations Cup was the top
sports story in the country back in June,
This exposure to top-level interna

tional soccer can certainly help the
sport grow in the US, but it's also im
portant not to discount MLS to say
that the USSF should not focus on im
proving MLS just because it is not one
of the world's elite leagues is harsh.
Developing a bigger and stronger do
mestic league can only help the sport's
status in America.

I'm not saying that soccer will ever
overtake (American) football here,
nor am I saying that MLS will soon
find itself employing the best players
in the world. I do believe that soccer in
the US is on the right track, though,
and it getting much, much closer to
breaking into the mainstream.
Now if only I could say the same
for hurling.
