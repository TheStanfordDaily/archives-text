# Beckham, MLS hype is a lost cause in U.S.A.

The name "David Beckham" brings
up a lot of associations. For some,
Beckham is a celebrity who makes
the front page of the tabloids
alongside wife Posh Spice. Among soccer
fans, the legendary midfielder also brings
up mixed reactions. English fans look favor
ably on Beckham and his many exploits for
the English national team; Manchester
United supporters reminisce about the
glory days when Beckham led the team to
multiple Premier League championships
and FA Cups.
In America, Beck-mania landed in 2007

when Beckham signed with the Los Ange-

'es Galaxy of MLS. Soccer pundits
(who magically sprung up on
ESPN overnight) made
varied proclamations.
Some even suggested
the move indicated
that Beckham no
longer had the skills
to play in Europe
and was moving to
expand his celebrity
profile in Holly
wood.
Others said that
Beckham's arrival her
alded the explosion of
soccer interest in the U.S.
Never mind that this explo
aon has been predicted multiple

times since America hosted the FIFA
World Cup in 1994 we were assured that
now, with soccer's biggest global star com
ing across the pond, everyone would sud
denly switch from watching football to fol
lowing futbol.
Beckham's arrival coincided with a big
shift in the thinking of Major League Soc
cer, the top professional American soccer
league. U.S. clubs started bringing big
names into the league, though these play
ers were admittedly past their primes.
These changes were made under the Des
ignated Player Rule, which allows MLS
teams to go over their salary cap restric
tions to sign a single player.
The league also moved forward with
big expansion plans, adding teams in San
Jose in 2008 and Seattle in 2009. Three
more expansion teams are planned for the
next few years in Philadelphia, Vancouver
and Portland.
These changes were aimed at improving
the quality of play in MLS. The hope was
that high-profile international stars, led by
Beckham, would generate a lot of interest
in soccer among Americans, leading to both
a bigger audience and a bigger talent pool
of young American players.
Two and a half years later, there is only
one word to describe the Beckham experi
ment: failure. Beckham played fairly little
for the LA Galaxy in 2007 and 2008, miss
ing significant time both due to injury and
to English national team commitments.The
buzz surrounding Beckham's arrival quick
ly disappeared, as he was unable to make a
significant on-the-field impact for his team.
It seemed that Beckham was not really in
terested in American soccer and that he re
served his best play for his national team.
While Beckham's weak play certainly
didn't help his attempt to raise the profile of
U.S. soccer, his effort was pretty much
