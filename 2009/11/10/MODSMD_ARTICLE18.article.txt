# Beckham, MLS hype is a lost cause in U.S.A.
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
The name "David Beckham" brings
up a lot of associations. For some,
Beckham is a celebrity who makes
the front page of the tabloids
alongside wife Posh Spice. Among soccer
fans, the legendary midfielder also brings
up mixed reactions. English fans look favor
ably on Beckham and his many exploits for
the English national team; Manchester
United supporters reminisce about the
glory days when Beckham led the team to
multiple Premier League championships
and FA Cups.
In America, Beck-mania landed in 2007

when Beckham signed with the Los Ange-

'es Galaxy of MLS. Soccer pundits
(who magically sprung up on
ESPN overnight) made
varied proclamations.
Some even suggested
the move indicated
that Beckham no
longer had the skills
to play in Europe
and was moving to
expand his celebrity
profile in Holly
wood.
Others said that
Beckham's arrival her
alded the explosion of
soccer interest in the U.S.
Never mind that this explo
aon has been predicted multiple

times since America hosted the FIFA
World Cup in 1994 we were assured that
now, with soccer's biggest global star com
ing across the pond, everyone would sud
denly switch from watching football to fol
lowing futbol.
Beckham's arrival coincided with a big
shift in the thinking of Major League Soc
cer, the top professional American soccer
league. U.S. clubs started bringing big
names into the league, though these play
ers were admittedly past their primes.
These changes were made under the Des
ignated Player Rule, which allows MLS
teams to go over their salary cap restric
tions to sign a single player.
The league also moved forward with
big expansion plans, adding teams in San
Jose in 2008 and Seattle in 2009. Three
more expansion teams are planned for the
next few years in Philadelphia, Vancouver
and Portland.
These changes were aimed at improving
the quality of play in MLS. The hope was
that high-profile international stars, led by
Beckham, would generate a lot of interest
in soccer among Americans, leading to both
a bigger audience and a bigger talent pool
of young American players.
Two and a half years later, there is only
one word to describe the Beckham experi
ment: failure. Beckham played fairly little
for the LA Galaxy in 2007 and 2008, miss
ing significant time both due to injury and
to English national team commitments.The
buzz surrounding Beckham's arrival quick
ly disappeared, as he was unable to make a
significant on-the-field impact for his team.
It seemed that Beckham was not really in
terested in American soccer and that he re
served his best play for his national team.
While Beckham's weak play certainly
didn't help his attempt to raise the profile of
U.S. soccer, his effort was pretty much
doomed from the start. A single play
er, even of Beckham's caliber, simply
can't single-handedly raise up a sport:
witness Pele's inability to do the same
in the 19705. The pundits who heralded
a new age of American soccer have
been proven absolutely wrong.

Soccer has not been transformed in
the US like we were promised. But it's
not only the Beckham experiment that
has failed; MLS has been unable to
make significant gains, either. The
league has generated a little more buzz
with its new stars and big plans, but
soccer remains relegated to the back
of the American sports consciousness.
Much like Olympic sports, it surfaces
every four years for the World Cup
and makes occasional appearances on
ESPN, but exists mostly on niche chan

nets that one can get only on premium
cable.

The expansion plans of MLS are
also the wrong way to go about im
proving soccer interest and involve
ment in the U.S. The league overall is
unprofitable, as are a majority of its
teams; adding new costs is definitely
not the right way for the league to place
itself in a better long-term position, es
pecially when there are few indicators
that the predicted explosion of Ameri
can soccer is actually taking place.
Expansion of the MLS also dilutes
the talent pool for teams to pick from.
To put it simply, more teams means
that each team gets a smaller slice of
the available talent, which means a
lower overall quality of play. Since one
of MLS's stated goals is improvement
in quality, its expansion plans only
make sense (once again) if the number
of talented players increases dramati
cally, a scenario that does not look
achievable in the near future.

Instead of trying to expand soccer's

profile through MLS, the U.S. Soccer
Federation needs to follow the exam
ple set by the NBA in terms of foreign
expansion. Basketball faces the oppo
site problem of soccer: the sport is well
established in America but needs to
expand its profile in other countries.
The NBA has taken the path of ag
gressively marketing its biggest stars,
like Kobe Bryant and Yao Ming, to for
eign audiences. Its main target is
China. While there is a Chinese do
mestic league, the NBA has managed
to generate significant increases in in
terest among the Chinese audience
through their strategy. Yao is marketed
especially aggressively, since he is orig
inally from China.
Rather than focusing on making
the MLS better, the American soccer
federation must recognize that it will
never progress far beyond a develop
ment league for sending players to the
top clubs in Europe. The federation
should team with high-profile Euro
pean clubs to market soccer in the U.S.

The higher quality of play in Europe
would draw more fans and there is
much more star power in Europe than
in the U.S.

There also isn't a shortage of Amer
ican players in European clubs that
can be used to market soccer to Amer
ican fans. Top American players like
DaMarcus Beasley, Tim Howard and
Onguchi Onyewu all play for high
level European clubs and could im
prove soccer's American audience
much better than importing European
players.

There are still huge opportunities for
soccer expansion in the US. MLS is try
ing to achieve this expansion in the
wrong way, albeit away that ensures all
the fruits of an expansion accrue to
them. If the U.S. Soccer Federation real
ly cares about expanding love of futbol,
then it needs to abandon its American
centric vie w for a more global approach.

The name "David Beckham" brings
up a lot of associations. For some,
Beckham is a celebrity who makes
the front page of the tabloids
alongside wife Posh Spice. Among soccer
fans, the legendary midfielder also brings
up mixed reactions. English fans look favor
ably on Beckham and his many exploits for
the English national team; Manchester
United supporters reminisce about the
glory days when Beckham led the team to
multiple Premier League championships
and FA Cups.
In America, Beck-mania landed in 2007

when Beckham signed with the Los Ange-

'es Galaxy of MLS. Soccer pundits
(who magically sprung up on
ESPN overnight) made
varied proclamations.
Some even suggested
the move indicated
that Beckham no
longer had the skills
to play in Europe
and was moving to
expand his celebrity
profile in Holly
wood.
Others said that
Beckham's arrival her
alded the explosion of
soccer interest in the U.S.
Never mind that this explo
aon has been predicted multiple

times since America hosted the FIFA
World Cup in 1994 we were assured that
now, with soccer's biggest global star com
ing across the pond, everyone would sud
denly switch from watching football to fol
lowing futbol.
Beckham's arrival coincided with a big
shift in the thinking of Major League Soc
cer, the top professional American soccer
league. U.S. clubs started bringing big
names into the league, though these play
ers were admittedly past their primes.
These changes were made under the Des
ignated Player Rule, which allows MLS
teams to go over their salary cap restric
tions to sign a single player.
The league also moved forward with
big expansion plans, adding teams in San
Jose in 2008 and Seattle in 2009. Three
more expansion teams are planned for the
next few years in Philadelphia, Vancouver
and Portland.
These changes were aimed at improving
the quality of play in MLS. The hope was
that high-profile international stars, led by
Beckham, would generate a lot of interest
in soccer among Americans, leading to both
a bigger audience and a bigger talent pool
of young American players.
Two and a half years later, there is only
one word to describe the Beckham experi
ment: failure. Beckham played fairly little
for the LA Galaxy in 2007 and 2008, miss
ing significant time both due to injury and
to English national team commitments.The
buzz surrounding Beckham's arrival quick
ly disappeared, as he was unable to make a
significant on-the-field impact for his team.
It seemed that Beckham was not really in
terested in American soccer and that he re
served his best play for his national team.
While Beckham's weak play certainly
didn't help his attempt to raise the profile of
U.S. soccer, his effort was pretty much
doomed from the start. A single play
er, even of Beckham's caliber, simply
can't single-handedly raise up a sport:
witness Pele's inability to do the same
in the 19705. The pundits who heralded
a new age of American soccer have
been proven absolutely wrong.

Soccer has not been transformed in
the US like we were promised. But it's
not only the Beckham experiment that
has failed; MLS has been unable to
make significant gains, either. The
league has generated a little more buzz
with its new stars and big plans, but
soccer remains relegated to the back
of the American sports consciousness.
Much like Olympic sports, it surfaces
every four years for the World Cup
and makes occasional appearances on
ESPN, but exists mostly on niche chan

nets that one can get only on premium
cable.

The expansion plans of MLS are
also the wrong way to go about im
proving soccer interest and involve
ment in the U.S. The league overall is
unprofitable, as are a majority of its
teams; adding new costs is definitely
not the right way for the league to place
itself in a better long-term position, es
pecially when there are few indicators
that the predicted explosion of Ameri
can soccer is actually taking place.
Expansion of the MLS also dilutes
the talent pool for teams to pick from.
To put it simply, more teams means
that each team gets a smaller slice of
the available talent, which means a
lower overall quality of play. Since one
of MLS's stated goals is improvement
in quality, its expansion plans only
make sense (once again) if the number
of talented players increases dramati
cally, a scenario that does not look
achievable in the near future.

Instead of trying to expand soccer's

profile through MLS, the U.S. Soccer
Federation needs to follow the exam
ple set by the NBA in terms of foreign
expansion. Basketball faces the oppo
site problem of soccer: the sport is well
established in America but needs to
expand its profile in other countries.
The NBA has taken the path of ag
gressively marketing its biggest stars,
like Kobe Bryant and Yao Ming, to for
eign audiences. Its main target is
China. While there is a Chinese do
mestic league, the NBA has managed
to generate significant increases in in
terest among the Chinese audience
through their strategy. Yao is marketed
especially aggressively, since he is orig
inally from China.
Rather than focusing on making
the MLS better, the American soccer
federation must recognize that it will
never progress far beyond a develop
ment league for sending players to the
top clubs in Europe. The federation
should team with high-profile Euro
pean clubs to market soccer in the U.S.

The higher quality of play in Europe
would draw more fans and there is
much more star power in Europe than
in the U.S.

There also isn't a shortage of Amer
ican players in European clubs that
can be used to market soccer to Amer
ican fans. Top American players like
DaMarcus Beasley, Tim Howard and
Onguchi Onyewu all play for high
level European clubs and could im
prove soccer's American audience
much better than importing European
players.

There are still huge opportunities for
soccer expansion in the US. MLS is try
ing to achieve this expansion in the
wrong way, albeit away that ensures all
the fruits of an expansion accrue to
them. If the U.S. Soccer Federation real
ly cares about expanding love of futbol,
then it needs to abandon its American
centric vie w for a more global approach.
