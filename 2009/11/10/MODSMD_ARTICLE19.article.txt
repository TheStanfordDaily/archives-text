# CARD TAKES NORPAC
## Stanford dominates conference tournament 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's field hockey team contin
ues to set the bar and tear up the competition, mak
ing their mark on school history and hoping to have
an impact on a national scale. Having established
themselves as the No. 1 team in the NorPac this past
weekend by defeating Appalachian State, Long
wood and Cal, the women will next face their
biggest challenge yet: obtaining a spot in the NCAA

Tournament. With a record of 16-4 (5-1 NorPac), the
No. 15 Stanford women set a school record for the
winningest season in program history.
Garnering recognition for its success, the team
was well-represented at the annual awards ban
quet. Junior Xanthe Travlos led the way with a
Player of the Year award, the second consecutive
year Stanford has taken this prestigious title. Trav
los is second on the team with 22 points after
recording 10 goals, 49 shots and two assists. Fresh
man Becky Dru notched the seventh Rookie of the
Year award for the Cardinal after an incredible
first collegiate season, leading the team with 27
points on 10 goals and seven assists.
Travlos followed her fellow Englander on the
team, junior Camille Gandhi, as Player of the Year,
while Dru followed a long line of Cardinal Rook
ies of the Year, including her current teammates,
sophomore Stephanie Byrne, Gandhi and senior
Nora Soza.

Joining Travlos and Dru were Gandhi and
sophomore goalie Alessandra Moss, both named
first team All-NorPac players. Senior Midori Ue
hara was named second team All-NorPac after
leading the team in scoring with 11 goals. Redshirt

freshman goalie Beth Ridley was honored with the
Julie Nagle Extraordinary Teammate Award for
her care and support of her teammates.
Head Coach Lesley Irvine also secured a top
honor, winning the much-coveted Coach of the
Year title. This was the second time Irvine has won
the award in three seasons.

"I am thrilled for the team," said Irvine. "They
have all worked so hard this season. I was particu
larly happy for the senior class. They have been
tremendous leaders, so to get this win on their last
career home game was special."
After raking in the awards, the Stanford women
had added pressure to show exactly why they were
such a top team. Nevertheless, the women had no
trouble proving this point during the NorPac Tour
nament, which kicked off with a match against Ap
palachian State. Proving why she was worthy of the
Player of the Year award, Travlos lead the team to
a 9-0 win last Thursday, recording her second hat
trick of the season and the third of her career.

The Cardinal was ruthless, dominating the field
throughout the game. Aside from Travlos' hat

On a weekend when it outscored its opponents by a cumulative 1 8-1 over three games, the Cardinal convincingly
defended its conference crown. Four Stanford players were named to the AII-NorPac Tournament team.

trick, the other goals for Stanford
were notched by junior Katherine
Donner, Dru, junior Jaimee Erick
son, Byrne and freshman Aysha
Sekhon.

After the massacre of Appalachian
State, the women faced Longwood on
Friday in the semifinals of the tourna
ment. Longwood was the second re
cipient of a Cardinal lashing, losing by
a score of 6-1. Travlos scored twice, fol
lowed by goals from Uehara, Dru, sen
ior Rachel Mozenter and sophomore
Katie Mitchell. Additionally, Moss
made seven saves in goal.
"The wins this weekend really
showcased our team's offense and just
how dangerous we can be," said senior
Rachel Bush.
The final game for the Cardinal was
the match that would determine the
NorPac Champion, the match that
would dictate who had a shot at the
NCAA Tournament, the match that
was against a team that had already
beaten Stanford and the match that
featured the biggest rivalry within the
league: a battle with Cal. Despite the
pressure, the women performed and
shut down Cal 3-0.

Stanford dominated the game from
the start, holding a 14-3 shooting edge
over the Golden Bears in the first 35
minutes and outshooting Cal 21-11
throughout the game. Dru scored the

first goal of the match with help from
Erickson and Soza. Travlos found the
goal two minutes later, her 16th of the
year. Byrne scored the final goal, with
help from Mozenter, providing a se
cure lead for the Cardinal.

Cal stepped up its game a bit during
the second half, outshooting the Cardi
nal 8-7. However, they were still un
able to find the goal thanks to the
strong Stanford defense along with
Moss's nine saves. Following the final

match, Travlos was named tourna
ment MVP, deservingly so, with her six

goals in the three matches of the com
petition.
"To win three conference tourna
ments in a row is something we are
very proud of as a program," added
Irvine.
Next up for the Cardinal will be the
NCAA Play-In game, where Stanford
will face the America East Conference
champion, Boston University, in
Boston on Tuesday.
