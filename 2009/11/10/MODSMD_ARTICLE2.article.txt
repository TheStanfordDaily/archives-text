## Early action apps up four percent Some international applications not yet received 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This year, 5,583 students
applied to Stanford University
during the restrictive early action
round, representing an approxi
mate four percent increase from
the previous year.

This number is expected to
climb higher as the Office of
Undergraduate Admission
receives the last of its internation
al applications.

"A few students abroad
where Internet access is spotty
were given permission to
apply using a paper application,"
explained Director of Admission
Shawn Abbott in an e-mail to
The Daily. To accommodate for
the delay of snail mail, the
University allowed these appli
cations to trickle in after the
Nov. 1 restrictive early action
deadline.

While early applicants may
feel the relief of accomplishing a
colossal task, the Office of
Undergraduate Admission is just
gearing up for its busiest period
the office started reading
applications last week.
Abbott acknowledged that
the greatest challenge for admis
sion officers is the fact that they
can only accept 1,700 or so hope
fuls for next year's freshman
class, and a consequently smaller
number of early applicants.
"As a result, we're charged
with making extraordinarily fine
distinctions between perfectly
capable, deserving and desirable
candidates," Abbott said. "There
simply isn't enough space in each
year's entering class to admit all
of the students we want to admit.
"Processing nearly a quarter

of a million credentials asso
ciated with an expected 30,000
or so applications —is a close
second, in terms of the chal
lenges that we face," he added.
At Stanford, the restrictive
early action round is intended
for students who have decided
that Stanford is their first choice.
These students will receive their
admission decision by mid-
December, when they will be
admitted, rejected or deferred to
the regular decisions round.
Regardless of the deadline
differences, Abbott insists the
early action and regular decision
options share the same stan
dards for assessing applicants.
"As we read applications for
admission, readers are guided by
several ideas, most notably aca
demic achievement, intellectual
vitality, extracurricular impact
and the notion of understanding
a student's life circumstances
within his or her individual con
text," Abbott said.
Furthermore, since restrictive
early action is a non-binding
option, admitted students will
have until May 15 to respond to
the University's offer of admis
sion. This flexibility is especially
important as prospective fresh
men review financial aid pack
ages from various universities.
Much to the dismay of
Stanford hopefuls and admissions
officers alike, the application
process is not without pitfalls.
Last year, almost 1,000 students
completed their applications
electronically and paid their
application fees, but ultimately
failed to submit these materials
by the deadline. Their applica
tions were not considered.

In an effort to curtail a repeat
of this mishap, Abbott cautioned
this year's crop of early appli
cants to turn in their applications
well in advance of the deadline.
