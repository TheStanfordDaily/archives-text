## CARD CLICKS ON OFFENSE 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
We all knew how good Toby Ger
hart was and we all heard about how
good Andrew Luck could be. But most
Cardinal fans had no clue they would
be this good in leading a Stanford of
fense that might be the best if not, at
least the most balanced in the Pac
-10 Conference.
The balance of production on Sat
urday was probably the most impres
sive thing about the win over the
Ducks. Stanford drove the ball at will
against Oregon, whether it was
through persistent pounding by the
senior tailback or precision passing
from the freshman quarterback. While
Gerhart was his usual workhorse self
(you know a running back is something
special when a 223-yard, three touch
down performance seems common
place), Luck has continued to show im
provement as the season goes on.
The redshirt freshman completed
12-of-20 passes for 251 yards and two
touchdowns, certainly a solid showing.
But the numbers don't tell the whole

story. Luck showed rare poise for a
freshman, or any quarterback for that
matter, whether he was evading the
rush to find freshman running back
Stephan Taylor in the flat or throwing
balls right on the money to sopho
more wideout Chris Owusu. Not to
mention, he didn't turn the ball over
once to a hungry Duck offense look
ing to get back in the game after falling
down by 17.
"Our running game, our passing
game complement each other and I
think we're a tough offense to stop,"
Gerhart said after the game.
Gerhart and Luck weren't the only
ones making big plays, though. The re
ceiving corps was as consistent as its
ever been, with sophomore Ryan
Whalen being a dependable target as
always and Owusu showing why, de
spite a few crucial drops this season, he
is an invaluable playmaker for the
Card. His 77-yard kick return to start
the game instantly electrified the stadi
um and Stanford wouldn't look back
from thereon out.
"It's like Christmas," Luck said of
Owusu's return. "You can't ask for any

thing more. It's such a momentum
swinger and takes so much pressure off
us. It's almost like we expect it now."
It would be a shame to leave out the
often-unheralded offensive line
though, which opened up holes for
Gerhart and kept Luck on his feet most
of the day. After being informed that he
had broken Stanford's single-game
rushing record, Gerhart had nothing
but praise for his linemen.
"It's something I owe to these guys,"
he said.
Oregon actually outgained Stan
ford — 570 total yards to 505 but
the Cardinal's balance and execution
on every facet of offense gave it a 15-
minute advantage when it came to time
of possession, preventing the Ducks
from ever making a serious comeback
attempt. While Oregon was frenetic
with its scoring, Stanford was a well
oiled machine, scoring on 10 of its 13
possessions. It's always a good sign
when sophomore punter David Green
only has to step on the field twice in a
60-minute game.

The Cardinal shocked the Oregon Ducks last weekend in a 51 -42
shootout, earning their way to a likely bowl game and a top-25 AP
ranking in the process. Senior running back Toby Gerhart led the
Stanford offense with 223 rushing yards and three touchdowns.
Saturday's game stood as an almost
impeccable performance by the Cardi
nal offense, even numerically: Stan
ford passed for 251 yards and rushed
for 254. As impressive as the offensive
balance was, Luck was not surprised
by his team's showing.

"We believe in ourselves as an of
fense and we know we can play with
anybody," he said. "They're a great de
fense but we weren't intimidated by
any means. If anything, we were more
fired up to play them."

The Cardinal will have to be even
more fired up next week if it is going to
upset the Trojans in the Coliseum
again. The offense and the defense
for that matter hasn't played nearly
as well on the road, but with Luck
seemingly coming into his own and the
rest of the offense rolling along, the
Cardinal have more than a fighting
chance this coming Saturday.
Last Saturday, though, Gerhart and
Co. were simply content to savor their
all-important win over the Ducks.
"I'm excited," the running back
said. "It's my senior year and I finally
get to go to a bowl game."
