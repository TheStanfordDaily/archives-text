# Today's athletes lack class
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
When I was trying to fig
ure out what to write
my column on this
week (I figured that I'd
give the Daily a break from reveling
in our football team's amazingness,
at least for a day), I decided to pe
ruse ESPN.com, as I do so often.
The top three stories today are
Larry Johnson being released (after
making several offensive com
ments), LeGarrette Blount being re
instated (after punching a Boise
State player in frustration and at
tempting to take on the entire Boise
State crowd in group MMA) and
Allen Iverson's discussions with the
Grizzlies' owner (after walking out
on the Grizzlies because he didn't
get enough playing time in his three
games with the team). Others in the
top 10 included Joey Porter's trash
talking, Michael Vick's prospects
and Tom Cable getting counseling
for his anger management issues.
Remember when sports consist
ed of athletes playing games against
each other?

Obviously, athletes have been
doing less than commendable things
for as long as sports have been
around. I'm sure there were some
ancient Olympians who beat their
wives or cheated in their events
2,500 years ago and athletes have
done awful things since then. But I
doubt there has ever been a time in
sports where athletes have reached
this level of obnoxious immaturity.
Anyone who knows me or has
ever read my columns knows that I
love sports and that I know more
about Obama's NCAA tournament
bracket than his foreign policy (let's
just say both are better than mine).
The actions of athletes on the field
(or court or ice or whatever it may
be) have a huge impact on my life
and I wouldn't have it any other way.
Unfortunately, though, my life is
now filled to the brim with the ar
rests and suspensions and inexcus
able actions of the very athletes I
cheer for and follow closely. For
every shotgun formation, there's a
star NFL player caught with a shot
gun in his trunk. For every broken
tackle, there's a broken jaw mysteri
ously showing up on a prostitute the
night after she was with an athlete,
who also happens to be married with
kids. For every unbelievable play,
there's enough unbelievable stupidi
ty to last sports fans a lifetime.

Now, it's no coincidence that this
increase of immaturity has accom
panied an enormous increase in
publicity, fame and wealth for ath
letes. These days, players are all over
the news while they're still in puber
ty and they can make CEO money
before they know what CEO stands
for. Greg Oden appeared in more
commercials than NBA games his
rookie season and he made millions
for it. Washington Nationals' pitcher
Stephen Strasburg and his infamous
agent, Scott Boras, haggled publicly
over his eight-figure salary while
Strasburg was a junior in college.
The media and the public tell ath
letes that they can do no wrong, and
then the athletes do wrong and get
punished for it. The media and the
public, which includes all of us who
love sports, deserve some blame. But
I, for one, am not ready to excuse
athletes for their errors.

It is one thing to be pampered for
your whole life, but it's another thing
entirely to try to beat up fans, let
alone to run an underground dog
fighting ring. No amount of media
pressure excuses Donte Stallworth
for being high, let alone for killing a
man while he was.

And it's not just the athletes. How
are Jamarcus Russell and Co. sup
posed to pry themselves from the pit
of quicksand that is the Raiders
franchise when their coach, Tom
Cable, uses his assistants as punch
ing bags? How can USC players
avoid being illegally paid if Tim
Floyd is forcing it on them? Okay,
maybe that's just USC, but still,
coaches don't always set the best ex
amples.

I'm tired of this. When I turn on
sports, I want to see the sports. I want
to see athletes handcuff defenders
with their moves, not get handcuffed
for driving under the influence.
Of course, there are many ath
