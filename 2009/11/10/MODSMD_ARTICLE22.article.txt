# Card swims to sweep
## 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's water
polo team swept its two conference
road games this weekend, setting the
stage for a proverbial clash of the Ti
tans with No. 1 USC this coming Sat
urday.
On Saturday, the Cardinal defeat
ed No. 8 Long Beach State 11-6 and on
Sunday took care of business against
No. 7 UC-Irvine, winning 12-5.
Fresh off a victory over UC-Davis
on Nov. 4, Stanford entered the week
end carrying a six-game winning
streak into the two matches. Against
Long Beach, senior driver Drac Wigo
did his best to keep the streak alive.
Wigo led all players with five goals,
including two in the first period. The
49ers hung close early, only trailing 3-
2 at the end of the first. However in
the second period, Stanford imposed
its will, outscoring Long Beach 3-0.
"They weren't pressing me, they
were just letting me shoot," Wigo said.
"A lot of my scoring chances were gen
erated by strong 2-meter play, which al
lowed me to get open on the outside."
Leading 6-2 at halftime, the Cardi
nal kept up its pace of play in the sec
ond half, finalizing the score at 11-6.
"One thing our coach preaches
when we're on the road is that you
have to be three or four goals better
to beat the team because they have a
natural advantage being at home,"
said senior goalie Jimmie Sandman.
In addition to Wigo's five goals,
freshman Paul Rudolph, redshirt
freshman Travis Noll, sophomores
Ryan Kent and Peter Sefton and jun
iors Alex Pulido and Jeffrey
Schwimer all contributed one score
apiece.

Against Irvine, Stanford showed
no signs of fatigue in the final game of
its three-game week.
Hat tricks by senior Ryan Mc-
Carthy and sophomore Jacob Smith

allowed Stanford to simply dominate
the Anteaters. Irvine did score the
first goal of the game, but the Cardi
nal responded with three unanswered
scores to close out the first period.
"They scored the first goal, but we
never got too worried," Sandman
said. "We pretty much handled them
for all four quarters."
Another 3-1 period ended the first
half with Stanford comfortably lead
ing 6-2. The Cardinal never slowed
down, outscoring Irvine 6-3 in the sec
ond half. Wigo continued his hot
streak, adding two more goals to his
weekend total. Two more scores from
Rudolph and one each from Noll and
Pulido rounded out the scoring.
"Our game plan the entire week
was to focus on Irvine and Long
Beach and not to think about the up
coming games," Wigo said. "We really
wanted to avoid the upset."
The two victories improved Stan
ford's record to 19-1 overall and 6-0
in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration. More importantly, the wins
kept Stanford's national title hopes
alive as it once again heads down to
Southern California to face the top-

ranked Trojans.

If Stanford defeats USC this
weekend and Cal the next, it will all
but assure itself a bid into the NCAA
Championship tournament. Lose
one, especially to Cal and the Cardi
nal will have to receive some help in
the form of an at-large bid.
Last year, Stanford lost to USC
four times, including in the national
title game. This meeting will be the
first of the season.

"It's a different feel (not having
played them this year)," Sandman
said. "It may be better,because before
we played them last year we had two
losses under our belt and guys may
have been a little more timid. This
year we're more confident and we all
have a gut feeling we can beat USC.
They're not that strong this year."
If one thing is for certain, this Stan
ford team does not lack confidence.

"If we just play an 'A' game and
play solid defense we can beat USC
by two goals, not one, maybe three,"
Wigo said.
