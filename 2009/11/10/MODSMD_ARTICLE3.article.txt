## Haas reevaluates strategic plan To engage students, Haas will hold town hall meeting tonight 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the Haas Center for Public
Service turns 25 this year, it is
beginning an extensive check-up
that includes creating a five-year
strategic plan to reevaluate its
role both in Stanford education
and in community outreach.

Haas intends to work on the
plan through this academic year
and is now embarking on the first
stage of evaluating where it cur
rently stands.
"It starts with taking stock,"
said Thomas Schnaubelt, associ
ate vice provost and executive
director of the Haas Center.

To assess the current situation,
the Haas Center has involved
multiple stakeholders in the
process, including Haas staff,
alumni, faculty and students. And,
as part of the outreach, the Haas
Center and the ASSU are holding

a town hall this evening to gauge
student reaction.

"The success of the strategic
plan really depends on the ability
to engage students," said Salone
Kapur 'lO, public service chair for
the ASSU. "[The town hall] is a
great way for students to have
their voices heard in an effective
way."

A group of eight Graduate
School of Business (GSB) alumni
are donating their time as consult
ants to gather data and assess
options for improvement. At the
town hall, the GSB team will be
leading focus groups and facilitat
ing discussion of how students
think the Haas Center is doing
and where it could head in the
future.

"The GSB alumni consulting
team ... is serving as objective
facilitators of this dialogue,"
Schnaubelt said.

The focus groups will ask stu
dents about their perceptions of
Haas and of public service in gen
eral, how the individual programs
are working and where students
feel the center is concentrating its
energy. The conversation will also
cover future public service at
Stanford and how students think
public service fits into education.

The focus is on "how we want to
make our center," Kapur said. "We
want to come out with data we can
use for the plan."

The aim is also to draw students
from across campus to the town hall
meeting instead of only those stu
dents already involved in public
service.

"[The town hall can] better
engage students from across the
community. It brings all together in a
very structured way to determine the
way we are now, and where we want
to be," Kapur added.
As to the longer-term results of
these outreach efforts, Schnaubelt is
not yet sure of what precisely the
strategic plan will change.
"It could be that everything is going
well. Our programs may not change
but we'll be doing a lot more of evalu
ating," Schnaubelt said. "Are there
times when we're doing more damage
than good in the community? We want
to find out where those points are."
Two key metrics central to the
strategic plan are the Haas Center's

effectiveness in promoting student
development and community devel
opment. These two measures will
determine how effective Haas is at
serving Stanford students as they
engage in public service and also
how capably the center's programs
are at engaging the community local
ly and globally.
"The thing that's new is the bal
ance of student and community
development," Schnaubelt said.
After the assessment, the plan is
to take the information gathered and
compile it into a plan of what the
overarching goals of the Haas
Center are and what changes should
be made, if any.
As far as how budget cuts could
affect the program, Schnaubelt said
the strategic plan is good for times of
cuts to ensure that the program has
clear priorities and that the plan con
tributes to diversifying funding for
new and better-defined projects.
"[The plan will] help guide other
plans and decisions in a crunch ...
and help us become more focused in
fundraising and development,"
Schnaubelt said.

The town hall will take place this
evening from 7 to 8:30 p.m. in Old
Union Room 200. Look for further
