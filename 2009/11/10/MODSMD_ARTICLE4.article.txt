On the upswing of senior Arty Rivera's
hammer stroke, bits of spray-painted sheet
rock flew into the crowd surging around
him. Simulating the fall of the Berlin Wall
exactly two decades years prior, students
smashed through their concrete replica,
transporting White Plaza back to East
Germany in 1989.

For Monday's "Fall of the Berlin Wall"
event, about 30 students tore down a small
size reproduction, complete with graffiti
and German phrases, of the infamous wall
that physically divided Berlin between
1961 and 1989.

During the height of the Cold War, the
German Democratic Republic (GDR)
built the Berlin Wall to stop the massive
tide of East German emigration. The wall
came to symbolize the divide between
Western Europe and the Communist Bloc.

"The fall of the wall is one of the most
recognized symbols of enduring free
speech," Rivera said. "In the very broad
sense, it's a very powerful symbol for free
dom over tyranny."

Rivera and Molly Pam 'lO, both coordi
nators for the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP) in Berlin, organized the
commemorative event with the assistance
of BOSP Director of Stanford in Berlin
Karen Kramer. Other sponsors were the
Stanford German Student Association
(SGSA) and the Krupp Internship
Program.

"It's a very nice symbolism of tearing

down the Iron Curtain and oppression...
I think it's a good memory and helps renew
that history," said participant Angela
Hayes 'l2.

Red Ransil 'lO and Juan Batiz-Benet
'lO designed and built the miniature Berlin
Wall replica, made out of sheet rock
affixed to a wood frame. To add a sense of
realism, students were invited to decorate
the wall on Friday. Batiz-Benet even
donned a hammer and sickle T-shirt and
Russian communist hat for the demonstra
tion.

Before the wall was destroyed, students
picketed and shouted the chant, "Wir sind
das volk," German for "We are the peo
ple!"

'Everyone was celebrating'
For older generations, the anniversary
of the Berlin Wall brings back vivid memo
ries.

Kramer, who has run the Berlin BOSP
for over 40 years, was in Germany at the
time of the wall's fall.

"I went to bed and woke up in the
morning, and the entire city of West Berlin
was full of East Berlin," she said. "It was
just incredible. You couldn't even move in
the city. Everyone was celebrating."
Several Stanford students participating
in BOSP at the time rushed out to jump on
the wall after news first broke.

"Some of the photos that are still on the
Internet have pictures of Stanford students
standing on top of the wall," Kramer said.
