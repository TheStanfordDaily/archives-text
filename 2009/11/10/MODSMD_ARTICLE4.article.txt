### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
On the upswing of senior Arty Rivera's
hammer stroke, bits of spray-painted sheet
rock flew into the crowd surging around
him. Simulating the fall of the Berlin Wall
exactly two decades years prior, students
smashed through their concrete replica,
transporting White Plaza back to East
Germany in 1989.

For Monday's "Fall of the Berlin Wall"
event, about 30 students tore down a small
size reproduction, complete with graffiti
and German phrases, of the infamous wall
that physically divided Berlin between
1961 and 1989.

During the height of the Cold War, the
German Democratic Republic (GDR)
built the Berlin Wall to stop the massive
tide of East German emigration. The wall
came to symbolize the divide between
Western Europe and the Communist Bloc.

"The fall of the wall is one of the most
recognized symbols of enduring free
speech," Rivera said. "In the very broad
sense, it's a very powerful symbol for free
dom over tyranny."

Rivera and Molly Pam 'lO, both coordi
nators for the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP) in Berlin, organized the
commemorative event with the assistance
of BOSP Director of Stanford in Berlin
Karen Kramer. Other sponsors were the
Stanford German Student Association
(SGSA) and the Krupp Internship
Program.

"It's a very nice symbolism of tearing

down the Iron Curtain and oppression...
I think it's a good memory and helps renew
that history," said participant Angela
Hayes 'l2.

Red Ransil 'lO and Juan Batiz-Benet
'lO designed and built the miniature Berlin
Wall replica, made out of sheet rock
affixed to a wood frame. To add a sense of
realism, students were invited to decorate
the wall on Friday. Batiz-Benet even
donned a hammer and sickle T-shirt and
Russian communist hat for the demonstra
tion.

Before the wall was destroyed, students
picketed and shouted the chant, "Wir sind
das volk," German for "We are the peo
ple!"

'Everyone was celebrating'
For older generations, the anniversary
of the Berlin Wall brings back vivid memo
ries.

Kramer, who has run the Berlin BOSP
for over 40 years, was in Germany at the
time of the wall's fall.

"I went to bed and woke up in the
morning, and the entire city of West Berlin
was full of East Berlin," she said. "It was
just incredible. You couldn't even move in
the city. Everyone was celebrating."
Several Stanford students participating
in BOSP at the time rushed out to jump on
the wall after news first broke.

"Some of the photos that are still on the
Internet have pictures of Stanford students
standing on top of the wall," Kramer said.

Stanford in Berlin's internship coordinator captured the over 1,000
oversized dominos set up from Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer
Platz in Berlin, the original route of the wall, Monday morning.
In 1989, German studies Prof.
Marton Dornbach was a high school
student in Hungary and was trans
fixed at the rapid nature of the trans
formation. Three months before the
Berlin Wall was toppled, Hungary
opened its borders to Austria, allow
ing tens of thousands of East
Germans to escape the restricted bor
ders of the former Eastern Bloc.
"It was a pretty heady, exhilarating
time, because after years and years of
stasis really the kind of stasis in
which I grew up everyone thought
that it was really never going to
change," Dornbach said.
People in Germany and around
the world viewed the swift chain of
events in 1989 in a state of "fascinat
ing disbelief," wrote Josef Joffe, senior
fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute
for International Studies, in an e-mail
to The Daily.
Both Dornbach and Joffe also
mentioned the fear and anxiety that
accompanied the end of the GDR.
"Most everybody, including the
principals in Bonn, London,
Washington, Paris and Moscow, were
afraid of uncontrollable dynamics,"
Joffe said, "and so everybody tried to
restore control, which was like trying
to build dikes against the deluge."
A "Terrible Time"
While students may recall the
GDR from history textbooks, Joffe,
who also publishes the weekly
German newspaper Die Zeit, has
firsthand experience of life with the
Berlin Wall.
"It was not pleasant to live in West
Berlin, as I did, and not [be] able to go
to East Berlin," he said. "It was easier
to go to Beijing, in fact."
Stanford students studying abroad
prior to the wall's fall were able to
travel freely across the wall, and every
quarter would have a three-day
excursion into East Germany, accord
ing to Kramer.
But East Germans had to receive
special permission to enter Western
territories, access that was granted
very rarely.
Director of International Student
Christian Outreach Johannes
Rusckow, who has spent 35 years at
Stanford, was born and raised in com
munist East Germany. After being
denied permission to do missionary
work in Japan, Rusckow left the GDR
anyway.

"I left the GDR, East Germany,
illegally through the minefields over
the Iron Curtain in '52," he said. "If
they would have caught me, it would
have meant three and a half years in a
labor camp, but I made it."
Though East Berlin has "changed
tremendously" in the last 50 years.

Rusckow remembered the difficulties
of life in East Germany and the relief
after the wall finally fell.
"It was really a terrible time," he
said. "The Stasi [GDR secret police]
was so terrible. They called the chil
dren in to spy on their fathers."

Straggles with Unification
The anniversary was a time for
celebration, as well as evaluation of
how far Germany has come in uniting
its East and West halves.

Germany may be one nation
today, but German studies Chair
Russell Berman said there is still
work to be done in erasing the differ
ences between West and East
Germany.

"There is no doubt... that there
are imbalances between East and
West as a legacy of the four decades
of Communist rule," Berman said.
"That part of Germany was subject to
ecological devastation, economic
underdevelopment and a repressive
political culture. Those things don't
disappear overnight."
The unemployment rate in what
was once East Germany is double
that of its western counterpart, and
since 1989,1.7 million East Germans
have migrated to West Germany,
according to Joffe.

Senior fellow at Freeman
Spogli Institute

"Give it another 20 years before
the two countries will become one,"
he said.
But Kramer pointed to the young
generation as a marker of German
reunification. "I think that young
people are not nearly as aware of it
as they used to be," she said. "At all
of the universities, whether they are
sitting in what used to be the East or

sitting in what used to be the West of
Berlin, the populations are com
pletely mixed in those universities."
German youth, though raised
without the divisions of East and
West, still recognize the significance
of the anniversary.
"The changes for the world that
came with [the fall of the Berlin Wall]
are so immense that I don't think it
can be overemphasized," said Fabian
Sahl, a German graduate student in
international policy studies. "For
Germans, certainly, that is the most
important event since the Second
World War."

"Not only for Germany, but for all
of Europe," added Andreas Zoellner,
a graduate student in aeronautics and
astronautics.

Though 20 years have passed since
the fall of the Berlin Wall, the events
of 1989 are still very much relevant
today.
"This is a very important example
of how unexpectedly the world sur
rounding us can change very unex
pectedly," Dornbach said. "No
amount of education or information
can prepare one for this kind of
change."

have meant three and a half years in a
labor camp, but I made it."
Though East Berlin has "changed
tremendously" in the last 50 years.

Rusckow remembered the difficulties
of life in East Germany and the relief
after the wall finally fell.
"It was really a terrible time," he
said. "The Stasi [GDR secret police]
was so terrible. They called the chil
dren in to spy on their fathers."

Straggles with Unification
The anniversary was a time for
celebration, as well as evaluation of
how far Germany has come in uniting
its East and West halves.

Germany may be one nation
today, but German studies Chair
Russell Berman said there is still
work to be done in erasing the differ
ences between West and East
Germany.

"There is no doubt... that there
are imbalances between East and
West as a legacy of the four decades
of Communist rule," Berman said.
"That part of Germany was subject to
ecological devastation, economic
underdevelopment and a repressive
political culture. Those things don't
disappear overnight."
The unemployment rate in what
was once East Germany is double
that of its western counterpart, and
since 1989,1.7 million East Germans
have migrated to West Germany,
according to Joffe.

"Give it another 20 years before
the two countries will become one,"
he said.
But Kramer pointed to the young
generation as a marker of German
reunification. "I think that young
people are not nearly as aware of it
as they used to be," she said. "At all
of the universities, whether they are
sitting in what used to be the East or

sitting in what used to be the West of
Berlin, the populations are com
pletely mixed in those universities."
German youth, though raised
without the divisions of East and
West, still recognize the significance
of the anniversary.
"The changes for the world that
came with [the fall of the Berlin Wall]
are so immense that I don't think it
can be overemphasized," said Fabian
Sahl, a German graduate student in
international policy studies. "For
Germans, certainly, that is the most
important event since the Second
World War."

"Not only for Germany, but for all
of Europe," added Andreas Zoellner,
a graduate student in aeronautics and
astronautics.

Though 20 years have passed since
the fall of the Berlin Wall, the events
of 1989 are still very much relevant
today.
"This is a very important example
of how unexpectedly the world sur
rounding us can change very unex
pectedly," Dornbach said. "No
amount of education or information
can prepare one for this kind of
change."

The dominos were toppled later Monday night as a symbol of the Berlin Wall's collapse 20 years ago. The walls
were decorated by Berlin youth as the project encouraged Berliners to reflect on what the fall of the Wall meant.
On the upswing of senior Arty Rivera's
hammer stroke, bits of spray-painted sheet
rock flew into the crowd surging around
him. Simulating the fall of the Berlin Wall
exactly two decades years prior, students
smashed through their concrete replica,
transporting White Plaza back to East
Germany in 1989.

For Monday's "Fall of the Berlin Wall"
event, about 30 students tore down a small
size reproduction, complete with graffiti
and German phrases, of the infamous wall
that physically divided Berlin between
1961 and 1989.

During the height of the Cold War, the
German Democratic Republic (GDR)
built the Berlin Wall to stop the massive
tide of East German emigration. The wall
came to symbolize the divide between
Western Europe and the Communist Bloc.

"The fall of the wall is one of the most
recognized symbols of enduring free
speech," Rivera said. "In the very broad
sense, it's a very powerful symbol for free
dom over tyranny."

Rivera and Molly Pam 'lO, both coordi
nators for the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP) in Berlin, organized the
commemorative event with the assistance
of BOSP Director of Stanford in Berlin
Karen Kramer. Other sponsors were the
Stanford German Student Association
(SGSA) and the Krupp Internship
Program.

"It's a very nice symbolism of tearing

down the Iron Curtain and oppression...
I think it's a good memory and helps renew
that history," said participant Angela
Hayes 'l2.

Red Ransil 'lO and Juan Batiz-Benet
'lO designed and built the miniature Berlin
Wall replica, made out of sheet rock
affixed to a wood frame. To add a sense of
realism, students were invited to decorate
the wall on Friday. Batiz-Benet even
donned a hammer and sickle T-shirt and
Russian communist hat for the demonstra
tion.

Before the wall was destroyed, students
picketed and shouted the chant, "Wir sind
das volk," German for "We are the peo
ple!"

'Everyone was celebrating'
For older generations, the anniversary
of the Berlin Wall brings back vivid memo
ries.

Kramer, who has run the Berlin BOSP
for over 40 years, was in Germany at the
time of the wall's fall.

"I went to bed and woke up in the
morning, and the entire city of West Berlin
was full of East Berlin," she said. "It was
just incredible. You couldn't even move in
the city. Everyone was celebrating."
Several Stanford students participating
in BOSP at the time rushed out to jump on
the wall after news first broke.

"Some of the photos that are still on the
Internet have pictures of Stanford students
standing on top of the wall," Kramer said.

Stanford in Berlin's internship coordinator captured the over 1,000
oversized dominos set up from Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer
Platz in Berlin, the original route of the wall, Monday morning.
In 1989, German studies Prof.
Marton Dornbach was a high school
student in Hungary and was trans
fixed at the rapid nature of the trans
formation. Three months before the
Berlin Wall was toppled, Hungary
opened its borders to Austria, allow
ing tens of thousands of East
Germans to escape the restricted bor
ders of the former Eastern Bloc.
"It was a pretty heady, exhilarating
time, because after years and years of
stasis really the kind of stasis in
which I grew up everyone thought
that it was really never going to
change," Dornbach said.
People in Germany and around
the world viewed the swift chain of
events in 1989 in a state of "fascinat
ing disbelief," wrote Josef Joffe, senior
fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute
for International Studies, in an e-mail
to The Daily.
Both Dornbach and Joffe also
mentioned the fear and anxiety that
accompanied the end of the GDR.
"Most everybody, including the
principals in Bonn, London,
Washington, Paris and Moscow, were
afraid of uncontrollable dynamics,"
Joffe said, "and so everybody tried to
restore control, which was like trying
to build dikes against the deluge."
A "Terrible Time"
While students may recall the
GDR from history textbooks, Joffe,
who also publishes the weekly
German newspaper Die Zeit, has
firsthand experience of life with the
Berlin Wall.
"It was not pleasant to live in West
Berlin, as I did, and not [be] able to go
to East Berlin," he said. "It was easier
to go to Beijing, in fact."
Stanford students studying abroad
prior to the wall's fall were able to
travel freely across the wall, and every
quarter would have a three-day
excursion into East Germany, accord
ing to Kramer.
But East Germans had to receive
special permission to enter Western
territories, access that was granted
very rarely.
Director of International Student
Christian Outreach Johannes
Rusckow, who has spent 35 years at
Stanford, was born and raised in com
munist East Germany. After being
denied permission to do missionary
work in Japan, Rusckow left the GDR
anyway.

"I left the GDR, East Germany,
illegally through the minefields over
the Iron Curtain in '52," he said. "If
they would have caught me, it would
have meant three and a half years in a
labor camp, but I made it."
Though East Berlin has "changed
tremendously" in the last 50 years.

of life in East Germany and the relief
