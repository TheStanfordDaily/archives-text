## 50.000 WORDS Student-initiated course designed to help participants complete novels for Natio|nal Novel Writing Month 
### CATTY MONROE 
It's a Friday night at Nexus Cafe in the
Stanford Medical Center. The cafete
ria-style tables are fairly empty; clank
ing dishes and faintly playing oldies
provide a backdrop for the tapping
keys of 10 laptops in the process of produc
ing 10 different novels in the next 24 days.
"Ten thousand, thirty five words," one typist
announces with a tone of pride and simultane
ous relief.

A supportive round of applause and a few
congratulatory remarks answer her as she
intently continues typing. She has 39,965 to go.

This November marks the start of National
Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), a now
international effort that has been met with
enthusiasm and dedication here on campus.
NaNoWriMo started in 1999 in the Bay Area
with 21 writers and has grown each year, with
more than 120,000 participants in 2008. The goal
is to write an entire novel (50,000 words or
roughly 175 pages) before midnight on Nov. 30.
Hari Rai Khalsa 'll, an anthropology major,
has been participating in NaNoWriMo for the
past five years. At six days into her novel, she
was optimistic and excited about the next 24
days.

"The two times I've done contemporary nov
els, they've turned out to be a disaster, which is
why I have high hopes for this one," Khalsa said.
She has the fall of her senior year in high
school when the heat in her house wasn't
working —to thank for a career as a
NaNoWriMo writer. Her family had a large pile
of newspapers by their fire, and the newspaper
lying on top happened to have a big headline
about National Novel Writing Month.
"I thought, 'Whoa, this sounds awesome,'
opened up the article [which] had the Web site
and got so excited instantly," she recalled.
Even though it was already Nov. 15, she
started writing that very night. She's been par
ticipating every year since.

After having spent her first November here
at Stanford holed away in her dorm experienc
ing what she described as a "sad and secluded
novel writing experience," Khalsa decided to
start the student-initiated class here at Stanford
for NaNoWriMo. Now in its second year, the
class spends September and October doing
writing exercises and preparing for a month of
frenzied word production.

Atticus Lee 'lO is one of the twelve ambi
tious students in the class.

"It's sort of like this thing I've wanted to do
it since I was really young," Lee explained. "But
I've never had the time ... and I always pro
crastinated."

This ambitious strategy of attacking an
entire novel in one month removes the daunt
ing threat of having a book hanging over your
head for years. Lee, who as of Nov. 5 was 5,000
words into her novel, explained that the process
is a personal challenge.

"This kind of forces you to confront your
demons," she said.

NaNoWriMo's Web site
(www.nanowrimo.org) explains that this "seat
of your pants" approach to novel writing helps
aspiring novelists to "put away all those self
defeating worries and START."

Khalsa admits that outside of November it's
hard to fit novel writing into a busy schedule
NaNoWriMo provides the necessary incentive
to find time for it.

"Amongst all the other school work it's hard

for me to justify taking the time out of my day
to write if it's not 'for' something," she said.
Given the average Stanford student's busy
daily schedule, this is hardly surprising.
Emily Rials 'll, an English major with a
creative writing emphasis who has written for
The Daily, is co-leading the class with Khalsa.
She was first told about NaNoWriMo as a sen
ior in high school in her creative writing club
and has been participating every year since
that time.

"I liked the idea of writing something long
and having it be legitimized," she explained,
adding, "It was amazing."

Yet while compressing this process into one
single month frees up a year or two in the long
run, it makes for a hectic 30 days. Moshe Zadka,
a Palo Alto software engineer who came to the
write-in at Nexus cafe, explained how he finds
the time to participate in the event.
"Basically in November I cut down on my
social engagements and a little bit on sleep,"
Zadka said.

Khalsa came up with a more innovative

technique her freshman year. In an attempt to
maximize writing time without sacrificing
schoolwork, she introduced a crazy philoso
pher into her novel. Her philosophy IHUM
notes doubled as the dialogue for this new
character.

This is the ultimate embodiment of

the quantity-over-quality mentality.

Students will revise their novels in
December, but for now these novels progress
uninhibited by any sort of editing process.
Zadka acknowledged the hardest part of
NaNoWriMo: "to keep writing even when
you're sure your novel sucks," he said.
Lee agreed, but added that, for now, the
word count is all that matters.

"It's okay to be mediocre in this class
unlike all the rest of Stanford," she joked.
Khalsa admitted to coming up with fairly
obscure plotlines to keep the novel moving
and to boost word count, such as mafia men
trying to make the perfect souffle and hit men
walking in the door.

"I always think about this quote that says, 'if
your characters aren't doing anything, have
someone walk in the door with a gun and
something will happen,'" she said.
Though she usually doesn't take this tip on
progressing a stagnated plot quite so literally,
one year she did.

"I decided, 'l'm going to have this guy be a
hit man and try and kill her. That will be more
interesting,"' she added.

One hundred and seventy-five pages filled
with typos, wrong verb tenses and desperately
obscure plot developments seem to be a per
vasive theme among these developing novels.
Given that those 50,000 words spread out over
30 days comes to a daily average of 1,667
words, this haphazard approach seems entirely
understandable and reasonable.

Most importantly though, while the time
pressure elicits many mistakes, it also allows for
unrestrained creativity. Khalsa explains that
while the hit man was definitely a "disaster," she
doesn't think with due editing and elabora
tion that "it was an unsalvageable one. I can
tell you I would never come up with anything of
that sort if I had had the time to reconsider that
decision," Khalsa said.

"Oftentimes that's when the best parts come
out the parts you never saw coming," she
added.

run, it makes for a hectic 30 days. Moshe Zadka,
a Palo Alto software engineer who came to the
write-in at Nexus cafe, explained how he finds
the time to participate in the event.
"Basically in November I cut down on my
social engagements and a little bit on sleep,"
Zadka said.

Khalsa came up with a more innovative

technique her freshman year. In an attempt to
maximize writing time without sacrificing
schoolwork, she introduced a crazy philoso
pher into her novel. Her philosophy IHUM
notes doubled as the dialogue for this new
character.

This is the ultimate embodiment of

the quantity-over-quality mentality.

Students will revise their novels in
December, but for now these novels progress
uninhibited by any sort of editing process.
Zadka acknowledged the hardest part of
NaNoWriMo: "to keep writing even when
you're sure your novel sucks," he said.
Lee agreed, but added that, for now, the
word count is all that matters.

"It's okay to be mediocre in this class
unlike all the rest of Stanford," she joked.
Khalsa admitted to coming up with fairly
obscure plotlines to keep the novel moving
and to boost word count, such as mafia men
trying to make the perfect souffle and hit men
walking in the door.

"I always think about this quote that says, 'if
your characters aren't doing anything, have
someone walk in the door with a gun and
something will happen,'" she said.
Though she usually doesn't take this tip on
progressing a stagnated plot quite so literally,
one year she did.

"I decided, 'l'm going to have this guy be a
hit man and try and kill her. That will be more
interesting,"' she added.

One hundred and seventy-five pages filled
with typos, wrong verb tenses and desperately
obscure plot developments seem to be a per
vasive theme among these developing novels.
Given that those 50,000 words spread out over
30 days comes to a daily average of 1,667
words, this haphazard approach seems entirely
understandable and reasonable.

Most importantly though, while the time
pressure elicits many mistakes, it also allows for
unrestrained creativity. Khalsa explains that
while the hit man was definitely a "disaster," she
doesn't think with due editing and elabora
tion that "it was an unsalvageable one. I can
tell you I would never come up with anything of
that sort if I had had the time to reconsider that
decision," Khalsa said.

"Oftentimes that's when the best parts come
out the parts you never saw coming," she
added.

It's a Friday night at Nexus Cafe in the
Stanford Medical Center. The cafete
ria-style tables are fairly empty; clank
ing dishes and faintly playing oldies
provide a backdrop for the tapping
keys of 10 laptops in the process of produc
ing 10 different novels in the next 24 days.
"Ten thousand, thirty five words," one typist
announces with a tone of pride and simultane
ous relief.

A supportive round of applause and a few
congratulatory remarks answer her as she
intently continues typing. She has 39,965 to go.

This November marks the start of National
Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), a now
international effort that has been met with
enthusiasm and dedication here on campus.
NaNoWriMo started in 1999 in the Bay Area
with 21 writers and has grown each year, with
more than 120,000 participants in 2008. The goal
is to write an entire novel (50,000 words or
roughly 175 pages) before midnight on Nov. 30.
Hari Rai Khalsa 'll, an anthropology major,
has been participating in NaNoWriMo for the
past five years. At six days into her novel, she
was optimistic and excited about the next 24
days.

"The two times I've done contemporary nov
els, they've turned out to be a disaster, which is
why I have high hopes for this one," Khalsa said.
She has the fall of her senior year in high
school when the heat in her house wasn't
working —to thank for a career as a
NaNoWriMo writer. Her family had a large pile
of newspapers by their fire, and the newspaper
lying on top happened to have a big headline
about National Novel Writing Month.
"I thought, 'Whoa, this sounds awesome,'
opened up the article [which] had the Web site
and got so excited instantly," she recalled.
Even though it was already Nov. 15, she
started writing that very night. She's been par
ticipating every year since.

After having spent her first November here
at Stanford holed away in her dorm experienc
ing what she described as a "sad and secluded
novel writing experience," Khalsa decided to
start the student-initiated class here at Stanford
for NaNoWriMo. Now in its second year, the
class spends September and October doing
writing exercises and preparing for a month of
frenzied word production.

Atticus Lee 'lO is one of the twelve ambi
tious students in the class.

"It's sort of like this thing I've wanted to do
it since I was really young," Lee explained. "But
I've never had the time ... and I always pro
crastinated."

This ambitious strategy of attacking an
entire novel in one month removes the daunt
ing threat of having a book hanging over your
head for years. Lee, who as of Nov. 5 was 5,000
words into her novel, explained that the process
is a personal challenge.

"This kind of forces you to confront your
demons," she said.

NaNoWriMo's Web site
(www.nanowrimo.org) explains that this "seat
of your pants" approach to novel writing helps
aspiring novelists to "put away all those self
defeating worries and START."

Khalsa admits that outside of November it's
hard to fit novel writing into a busy schedule
NaNoWriMo provides the necessary incentive
to find time for it.

"Amongst all the other school work it's hard

for me to justify taking the time out of my day
to write if it's not 'for' something," she said.
Given the average Stanford student's busy
daily schedule, this is hardly surprising.
Emily Rials 'll, an English major with a
creative writing emphasis who has written for
The Daily, is co-leading the class with Khalsa.
She was first told about NaNoWriMo as a sen
ior in high school in her creative writing club
and has been participating every year since
that time.

"I liked the idea of writing something long
and having it be legitimized," she explained,
adding, "It was amazing."

Yet while compressing this process into one
single month frees up a year or two in the long
run, it makes for a hectic 30 days. Moshe Zadka,
a Palo Alto software engineer who came to the
