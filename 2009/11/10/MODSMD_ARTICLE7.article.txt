# SEEING RUSSIA FROM THE FARM
## In its second year, the Stanford U.S.-Russia Forum promotes dialogue between American and Russian students via conferences, virtual seminars 
### KRISTENLEE 
While well-known
leaders, experi
enced politicians
and expert advis
ers meet to shape
the path of the United States and
Russia's relationship and future, a
group of college students from
around the world are engaging in
their own conferences and policy
making.

The Stanford U.S.-Russia Forum
(SURF), headed by co-presidents
Anda Gansca 'll and Sam Stone 'lO,
consists of teams of undergraduate
students at Stanford and in Moscow
and an advisory board made up of
faculty, businessmen and ex-policy
makers.

The organization was founded in
the fall of 2008 by Gansca and Stone
who were studying in Moscow for
the quarter along with two of
their Russian university colleagues
as away to promote interest among
fellow college students about the
issues facing the United States and

Russia.
"In the wake of that summer's
Georgian War, we felt that U.S.-
Russian relations had reached a
crossroads," Stone said. "We were
dismayed to see anti-American sen
timent growing across Russia, but
also troubled by America's persist
ent ignorance of Russia since the
end of the Cold War."

SURF seeks to not only help stu
dents delve further into the two
countries' relationship, but also
come up with ideas on how the vari
ous issues might be solved through
discussion of many different view
points.

"During our first few weeks
there, [Sam and I] interacted with a
lot of Russian students and were
surprised to hear their perspec
tives," Gansca said. "Their ideas
were very different from ours but in
away we had never anticipated. It

was not that we had opposing per
spectives on the same issue —we
simply regarded different issues as
being important to the development
of our respective countries."
"So we decided that dialogue was
vital," she added.
Dialogue is indeed a key part of
SURF last year, it hosted a stu
dent conference on foreign policy at
Moscow State University, covering
topics from the NATO expansion to
oil and gas line politics. lire confer
ence was made up of just under 50
delegates from four different
Russian universities, Stanford
University, Yale University,
University of Pennsylvania and
University of California at San
Diego.

This year, SURF is implementing
a new program consisting of three
parts, the first being a series of 10
virtual seminars held over the
course of five weeks. During winter
quarter, delegates in small groups
will write a short policy paper and
will then finish the program in a
four-day conference at Stanford in
the spring.
According to Stone, the dele
gates' findings will then be put
together and published in a journal
format to be presented to policy
makers in the United States and
Russia.

During the virtual seminars, stu
dents from Stanford and other uni
versities across the United States
and Russia discuss an assigned topic,
interacting live through free
Internet videoconferencing technol
ogy-

Each seminar is led by a guest
speaker; the cast of experts include
Vladimir Putin's former economic
adviser, the editor of Science maga
zine and the director of Moscow's
largest foreign policy think tank.
Although the virtual seminars
have only just recently begun, they
seem to be getting a good response,
"It's a great opportunity to actu

ally sit down with Russian youth and
see what they think about these
issues," said Amir Ravandoust 'lO.
The diversity in perspectives, not
only between Russia and the United
States but between the individual
universities as well, has certainly
made the seminars a refreshing
experience.

"There is a very large gap
between the academic methodology
here at Stanford and across the
globe," Ravandoust said. "It's very
eye-opening."
William Ko, a recent Yale gradu
ate who has participated in SURF,
shared a similar opinion.
"These concerns and opinions
sometimes differ radically from
what we are used to hearing in
American universities, but they are
often legitimate concerns that are
overlooked or understudied," Ko
said.

"Although all leading institu
tions in the United States will gen
erally highlight the main chal
lenges in the countries' bilateral
relations, each school tends to have
its own epistemic conception about
these said challenges in terms of
origin or cause, contemporary
manifestation and future resolu
tion," Ko added.
It is clear that SURF is quickly
gaining popularity. The organization
received 250 applications this year
for 40 delegate positions. The final
pool of delegates is composed of 20
Russian students and 20 students
hailing from Stanford, Harvard,
Princeton, Yale, University of
Indiana, Georgetown and Georgia
Tech.

"The program was highly com
petitive," Stone said.
Ko said the application process
consisted of two essays and a follow
up interview, testing candidates'
knowledge of international relations
and politics and critical reasoning
and analytical skills, as well as their
passion and motivation for the sub

ject.
Taylor Dewey, a graduate student
in International Policy Studies,
decided to become part of SURF
because he "wanted to learn more
about U.S.-Russian foreign policy
and research areas for mutually ben
eficial policy development," specifi
cally, "sustainable energy policy
development and security coopera
tion."
"I think this a terrific idea and
[Gansca and Stone] have done a
great job putting this forum togeth
er," Dewey said.

There is no doubt that SURF is a
significant presence and will contin
ue to be so.

"These students represent
tomorrow's leaders," Gansca said.
"By putting them in contact, we
inevitably start a very important cul
tural and intellectual exchange that
we hope will affect the way they
make decisions in the future,
whether it is at a personal level or a
national one,"

a new program consisting of three
parts, the first being a series of 10
virtual seminars held over the
course of five weeks. During winter
quarter, delegates in small groups
will write a short policy paper and
will then finish the program in a
four-day conference at Stanford in
the spring.
According to Stone, the dele
gates' findings will then be put
together and published in a journal
format to be presented to policy
makers in the United States and
Russia.

During the virtual seminars, stu
dents from Stanford and other uni
versities across the United States
and Russia discuss an assigned topic,
interacting live through free
Internet videoconferencing technol
ogy-

Each seminar is led by a guest
speaker; the cast of experts include
Vladimir Putin's former economic
adviser, the editor of Science maga
zine and the director of Moscow's
largest foreign policy think tank.
Although the virtual seminars
have only just recently begun, they
seem to be getting a good response,
"It's a great opportunity to actu

ally sit down with Russian youth and
see what they think about these
issues," said Amir Ravandoust 'lO.
The diversity in perspectives, not
only between Russia and the United
States but between the individual
universities as well, has certainly
made the seminars a refreshing
experience.

"There is a very large gap
between the academic methodology
here at Stanford and across the
globe," Ravandoust said. "It's very
eye-opening."
William Ko, a recent Yale gradu
ate who has participated in SURF,
shared a similar opinion.
"These concerns and opinions
sometimes differ radically from
what we are used to hearing in
American universities, but they are
often legitimate concerns that are
overlooked or understudied," Ko
said.

"Although all leading institu
tions in the United States will gen
erally highlight the main chal
lenges in the countries' bilateral
relations, each school tends to have
its own epistemic conception about
these said challenges in terms of
origin or cause, contemporary
manifestation and future resolu
tion," Ko added.
It is clear that SURF is quickly
gaining popularity. The organization
received 250 applications this year
for 40 delegate positions. The final
pool of delegates is composed of 20
Russian students and 20 students
hailing from Stanford, Harvard,
Princeton, Yale, University of
Indiana, Georgetown and Georgia
Tech.

"The program was highly com
petitive," Stone said.
Ko said the application process
consisted of two essays and a follow
up interview, testing candidates'
knowledge of international relations
and politics and critical reasoning
and analytical skills, as well as their
passion and motivation for the sub

ject.
Taylor Dewey, a graduate student
in International Policy Studies,
decided to become part of SURF
because he "wanted to learn more
about U.S.-Russian foreign policy
and research areas for mutually ben
eficial policy development," specifi
cally, "sustainable energy policy
development and security coopera
tion."
"I think this a terrific idea and
[Gansca and Stone] have done a
great job putting this forum togeth
er," Dewey said.

There is no doubt that SURF is a
significant presence and will contin
ue to be so.

"These students represent
tomorrow's leaders," Gansca said.
"By putting them in contact, we
inevitably start a very important cul
tural and intellectual exchange that
we hope will affect the way they
make decisions in the future,
whether it is at a personal level or a
national one,"
