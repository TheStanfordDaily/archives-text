## Senate considers GEC applicability to groups 
### MILES UNTERREINER 
Members of the Undergraduate
Senate drafted legislation last
month designed to promote the use
of eco-friendly materials by student
groups. But the future of the bill,
and whether or not its provisions
will become mandatory, remains
uncertain.

The Green Events Checklist
(GEC), originally proposed last
spring and formally implemented
Oct. 19, lays out a list of "the most
economical and best sustainable
practices" for student-organized
events practices ranging from
conventional strategies like buying
recyclable cups and plates to less
orthodox approaches like refraining
from the use of tablecloths and dec
orations.

Accumulated from what Senator
Dean Young 'll called "a collection
of suggestions from various dining
sustainability posters and research,
collective student knowledge and
several hours of deliberation
among the subcommittee mem
bers," the GEC's recommendations
largely represent the work of the
Senate's Sustainability

Subcommittee, chaired by Young
and operating under the auspices of
the broader Student Housing, Life,
and Education Committee
(SHL&E).
According to SHL&E Chair
Zachary Warma 'll, also opinions
editor at The Daily, who helped form
the subcommittee, its "most direct
purpose was to create the Green
Events Checklist" in an attempt to
address ongoing sustainability issues.

Once the subcommittee was
formed, it immediately went to
work, soliciting recommendations
from as many sources as possible in
order to compile "a list of best prac
tices the ASSU can use to make itself
more sustainable," according to
Warma.

At that point, however, debates
arose as to if, and for whom, the
GEC should become compulsory.
Options ranged from adherence
only at ASSU Senate and
Executive functions to mandatory
observance by a broader range of
events held by voluntary student
organizations (VSOs). Eventually, a
tentative consensus emerged: the
GEC's provisions should be fol
lowed for internal ASSU events as
a test run, then potentially extend
ed to other VSOs' events should

the results prove positive.

Senator Michael Cruz 'l2,
involved in drafting the bill that creat
ed the Sustainability Subcommittee
last spring, was part of that consensus
and viewed the GEC's application to
ASSU programming "as a template
for other groups to follow," though he
also envisioned extending it to the
rest of the student body after a cer
tain test period.
Warma, however, though agreeing
with the conception of the GEC as a
pilot, was more skeptical of the idea
of mandates, especially those "self
policing" measures designed to apply
to the Senate itself. Concerned that
the GEC hasn't had the chance to be
tested, Warma warned that although
"potentially in the long term, we
could tie the GEC to funding for stu
dent groups," no practicable meas
ures for enforcing the policy current
ly exist.

The GEC has nevertheless elicit
ed applause from many Stanford stu
dents outside of the Undergraduate
Senate, including members of groups
unaffiliated with environmental
causes and some who say they
already comply with many of the
GEC's requirements.
"The plates, cups and silverware
at Hillel have always been com
postable," explained Jewish Student
Association board member and
Stanford Israel Alliance activist
Ruthie Arbeiter 'l2. "[The GEC]
should be important to all of campus,
and every student group should use
it."

"It makes sustainable event and
party planning easier and more
accessible," said Susie Choi 'l2, direc
tor of the Stanford Green Store.
Choi, who already offers the recycla
ble and compostable materials rec
ommended by the GEC at the Green
Store, encouraged the expansion of
GEC protocols.
Choi added that, after the GEC's
current test run in the Senate, she'd
like to see all student groups that
receive ASSU funding eventually fol
low the sustainable standards out
lined in the bill.

Angela Kwok 'l3, a member of
the Green Living Council (GLC),
agreed, emphasizing the importance
of environmentally conscious deci
sions across campus. "I feel like all
students should support green prac
tices," she said.
