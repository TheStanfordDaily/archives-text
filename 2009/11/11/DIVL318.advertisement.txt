The Prokofiev Project:
Interpreting Prokofiev
"If you really play it the way it should be played, Prokofiev is physically damaging.
I mean, after a performance I can't touch my fingertips because they're hurting, and
my wrists are going crazy. " Alexander Toradze
Joined by Stanford pianists Kumaran Arul and George Barth, Alexander Toradze
and Joseph Horowitz explore Prokofiev, the man and artist. What can be learned
from Prokofiev's own recordings of his piano music—including the Visions Fugitive,
which Arul will also offer in live performance, and the Piano Concerto No. 3, of
which Toradze's recording was once voted "the best of all time" in International
Piano Quarterly.
