# Is THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?
## 
### JENNIFER LEE 
With the end of autumn
quarter in sight, many
seniors are already
looking ahead to
graduation. Some
may be dreading the prospect of get
ting jobs in the "real world." Others are
counting down the days to the eventu
al end of their lengthy academic
careers.
Pre-med students fit neither cate
gory.
Rachel Ny 'lO, Juliet Idiga TO and
Anthony Essilfie 'lO are three current
seniors who have sent in their medical
school applications and are now wait
ing to hear the admissions decisions.
Ny applied to twenty medical schools.
Idiga and Essilfie applied to fifteen.
Despite the mentally and finan
cially draining process of applying to
medical schools, Ny expressed confi
dence in her longtime dream of
becoming a doctor.
"I was in the pre-med track since I
came here pretty much," Ny said.
"Probably even prior to coming to
college."
She understands that it's common
to have second thoughts about
becoming a doctor.
"It's easy to have doubts about
being pre-med because you find so
many people who are very passionate
about what they study," she said. "It's
easy to be fooled into wondering, 'ls
my passion stronger than theirs?' or,
'ls this really what I'm meant to do?"'
Idiga's hesitation toward becoming
a physician was motivated by the rigor
of her courses. Idiga had aspired to
become a physician since her child
hood, but began to question that

dream when taking the biology core in
her sophomore year.
"I think the thing to remember is
that a lot of the classes you're taking
are not necessarily reflective of what
you'll be doing as a physician," Idiga
said. "And that was what bio core was
for me. It's important to get the foun
dations of what you need to be a doc
tor, but it's not what you're going to be
practicing every day."
It was not until Idiga participated
in the Stanford Immersion in
Medicine Series (SIMS) that she
became fully confident in her goal of
becoming a doctor. Through the SIMS
program, Idiga was able to shadow a
doctor in a hospital. Being surrounded
by a medical environment in which
she was able to visit clinics, operation
rooms and staff meetings motivated
her to fully commit to the medical
track.
"That essentially reinvigorated
me," Idiga said. "Actually getting to
work next to a doctor was what
cemented it it confirmed exactly
what I wanted to do."
Similarly, Essilfie began to have
doubts in his goal of becoming a doc
tor because of the difficulty of the
courses necessary for medical school.
He, too, was able to reconcile his fears
by realizing that pre-med courses do
not translate to the exact work he
would be doing as a doctor.
"Knowing that this course isn't
what the day-to-day entails and that it's
not necessarily the material of the
course that's being tested right now, but
your creative thinking and your dedi
cation that's being tested was the line
of thought that helped me overcome
that doubt," Essilfie said.
Despite the exhausting process of

applying to medical schools a
process that many save until after grad
uation — Essilfie has chosen not to
take a gap year.
"Why shouldn't I apply right now?"
Essilfie questioned. "Why not get to
where I want to be now?"
For Essilfie, the most troubling
aspect of the process is no longer his
courses or completing his applications,
but rather waiting to find out where
hell be headed next fall.
"Once you put in your materials
and once you send in your secondaries,
it's really up to the other schools to get
back to you," Essilfie said. "And it's
hard to have things out of your control
like that."
Ny also expressed her anxiety in
waiting for the admissions decisions. As
a precaution, Ny is coming up with a
backup plan and is in search of options
other than medical school.
"This process is definitely very
nerve-racking," she said.
Though it is still early to hear deci
sions from medical schools, Idiga has
already been accepted to
Northwestern University Medical
School. She expressed comfort in
knowing that she will definitely be at a
medical school this fall.
"It's a relief knowing that next year
I'm not going home," she said. "I'm
going to medical school."
And despite the difficult academic
journey thus far and the rigorous years
of medical training that she will face
starting this fall, Idiga is confident that
she has made the right choice.
"It's what I want to do," she said.
"There's no question about it."
