## EDITORIAL Courts must lead the way on gay marriage ban 
### 
Last week, Maine became the 31st state
to reject same-sex marriage at the bal
lot box by a narrow margin of 52.8 per
cent to 47.2 percent. Many gay rights activists
mark the vote as a setback to the growing gay
and lesbian civil rights movement. It must be
noted that, despite the fact that gay marriage
continues to be struck down again and again
when put to a vote, the courts continue to up
hold the constitutionality of same-sex mar
riage. Much of the progress made toward le
galizing gay marriage has been made at the
judicial level, often in spite of majority public
opinion. And with such an explicit dichotomy
of decisions, the same-sex marriage issue
begs us to ask the question of whether the
courts or the people should make the final
decision on same-sex marriage.
The road to gay rights has hit a roadblock
of voter opinion just as the civil rights move
ment did in the 19605. From this point on,
every major gain began with a grassroots
movement but was solidified by the courts
the desegregation of public schools and even
interracial marriage had to be defended by
the courts against the tide of public opinion.
Popular sentiment ran against the courts in
each of these cases. But the body with the
power then, and now, to interpret constitu
tionality was and continues to be the court.
When fundamental rights are at stake,
should we not give the issue more preference
than a proposition on state spending? The
level of human importance, as well as degree
of constitutional analysis, in the case of gay
rights calls for higher precedence in the ears
of the government through the voice of the
courts. For the courts to stand by the ruling
that same-sex marriage is constitutional yet
allow those rights to be trampled upon is as
useless as Stephen Douglas in the 1850s

claiming states and territories should decide
slavery for themselves. The current pattern
echoes the civil rights issues of the past, with
the courts setting a radical precedent against
the cries of a reluctant majority opinion.
But why, some would ask, should the will
of the majority be overpowered in a govern
ment of the people, by the people and for the
people? As seen in the latest campaigns to
vote down same-sex marriage laws, interest
groups played a crucial role in swaying popu
lar opinion. Is it too much to ask that an issue
as important as gay marriage not be left up to
a battle pitting the better-funded advertising
campaigns against the under-funded voices
of those whose rights are at stake? The prece
dence of the courts serving the role of deci
sion-maker in past civil rights movements
should not end. Just as James Madison point
ed out, the courts must be able to defend the
constitutional rights of a minority group even
when public sentiment is aligned against it.
It is easy to sit back and ask those who
have lost these recent rights battles to "re
member how far we've come." Yes, the
progress in the gay rights movement has been
tremendous in the past decade, but we cannot
ignore the fundamental divide between the
public and the courts, between majority opin
ion and the constitution. We must remember
the importance of court decisions in the past
and extend this same attention to the gay
population in their fight for legal rights. At
times, the road of civil rights comes to an in
surmountable cliff, most often the change of
law itself. With a divided public, the courts
cannot allow their decisions and the law to be
divided as well. Resolution will only be found
when the courts solidify their role in this civil
rights movement and the individual's fate is
not left to pencil marks on paper.
