# GET IT RIGHT
## 'Public option' has a nice ring to it, is less threatening than 'socialism' 
### Erica Morgan 
I had the great pleasure of witnessing the
SPU-SIG Debate on healthcare last
week. This high-energy discourse be
tween advocates and opponents of the
"public option" component of the impend
ing healthcare legislation was engaging,
highly informative and well worth attend
ing. For those members of the student body
not fortunate enough to have experienced
the showdown, I offer a summary of the
events:

Peter Hong, a supporter of the public op
tion, launched the debate with a surprising
ly strong case for his opposition. Peter in
formed the audience that there is not, nor
has there been, a free market in the health
care system. True! Since the 19305, the gov
ernment has stepped in with regulation
upon regulation in the healthcare system.
Peter argued that this lack of a free market
and the absence of competition have led to
the problems we are facing today. Another
excellent point. He then proceeded to point
out that the government's public option is
the surefire way to bring competition to the
system. False! But we'll return to that in a
moment...

Matt Cook stepped up next to deliver an
eloquent breakdown of the myths propagat
ed by the pro-public proponents. The myths:
1) Current problems with healthcare prove
that the free market has failed. 2) The public
option will encourage competition 3) Amer
icans will be able to retain their current plans.
Cook systematically destroyed this drivel
with irrefutable logic.
First, as both the pro and con debaters ac
knowledge: There is no free market in the
American healthcare system. There can be no
market failure if there is no market to begin
with. Consider, for instance, that there are
1,300 insurance providers in the United
States, yet government regulations only
allow Californians to access the six compa
nies within state lines. There is your lack of
competition, my friends. The government
wants to "give" us competition with one pub
lic option? Deregulate state limitations on
health insurance and they'll "give" us 1,294
more options.

Second, a public option will not encour
age competition, but rather act as a govern
mental price control mechanism. The pro
side acknowledged this fact but attempted to
argue that this would encourage competi
tion. How is government regulation that sets
insurance rates artificially low to drive down
prices competitive?
Finally, healthcare projections predict
that 120 million Americans will be forced
onto the government's plan. American earn
ings will be seized to cover the cost of the
public "option," doctors will be government
employees and, as both Barney Frank and

beloved Obama have openly stated, this is
just the first step on the road to a single payer
system more honestly known as socialized
healthcare.
Jason Bade did not contribute much in the
way of new argumentation. He honed in on
wishful notion of the public option increasing
competition, reiterating that the option is a
"base-line competitor" that will keep prices
down and private insurers honest, thereby al
lowing the free market to do "the right
thing." However, this argument holds no
water, because, as Bade himself admitted, the
free market has yet to be tried.
Dakin Sloss (after nicely summarizing
Bade's arguments as "Orwellian doubles
peak") took a step back to examine the
moral foundations of a government plan.
Sloss emphasized the primary foundation of
human life as reason, with the prerequisite of
individual freedom. The government's role
should be the protection of this freedom.
Therefore, one must conclude that health
care is not a basic right and that the govern
ment is actually violating the rights of its citi
zens when it extorts money from them to
provide healthcare for others.
Bryce Kam, the last in the pro side lineup,
certainly spoke with a great deal of righteous
fervor, but was actually quite instrumental in
debunking the arguments for a public option.
His contributions consisted of one-liners
such as, "We have a heart on this side of the
house."

The grand finale of the debate came in
the form of Adam Creasman, registered De
mocrat, who beautifully illustrated that the
public option is a formula for economic fail
ure. Both sides of the debate accepted that
the public option can and will lose money.
This means that it will fail in the long term.
How can any company that operates at a loss
be sustained? Private insurers cannot com
pete with an option that doesn't have to be
profitable. Creasman offered a private solu
tion: free the market and abolish the ability
of insurance companies to collude. What
about people who can't afford healthcare in
a free market? Money currently spent on
Medicare and CHIP would cover the entire
population.

The New York Times observed that
"Obama has staked his domestic agenda on
passing comprehensive health legislation."
Some may applaud this bold step, but I inter
pret the sentiment as dire warning that
healthcare reform will be shoved down our
throats whether we want it or not. And while
Democrats make "grave concessions" on
abortion coverage, we'll all end up conceding
quality healthcare at the end of the day.
