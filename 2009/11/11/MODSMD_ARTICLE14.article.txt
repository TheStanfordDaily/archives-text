"If you want to know what a man's like, take a
good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his
equals."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, p. 525
On Stanford students' list of things to do,
cleaning our rooms can sink to the bottom.
As usual, the wizarding world has this one
solved with awkward pillow-case-wearing,
chore-doing creatures known as house-elves
whose existence unfortunately consists sole
ly of obeying their masters' every command.
Despite their poor living conditions and
treatment, essentially no one in the wizard
ing world gives their plight a second thought;
it is assumed that they are inferior beings left
to do menial work for wizards.
Hermione is particularly disturbed by
house-elves' plight and constantly advocates
for reformation of their treatment. At one
point, when she gets on her usual soapbox
about house-elves, specifically high-ranking
government official Barty Crouch's mistreat
ment of his house-elf Winky, Harry's mildly
reckless godfather Sirius surprisingly sides
with her. Sirius looks beyond wizarding soci
ety's built-in assumptions about status and
offers a radical lens through which people
might best be examined and perhaps through
which we might find advantageous to exam
ine ourselves.
Given that we Stanford students are al
ready doing the whole tutoring-save-the
world-from-poverty-travel-to-underdevel-
oped-nations thing, one might wonder if Sir
ius is prescribing that we do anything more
radical than that. After all, on a campus with
a center, various organizations and numer
ous workshops devoted to public service, it
looks like we treat those who might be la
beled as "less fortunate" quite well. There
hardly seems to be an issue with Stanford stu
dents' moral fiber, let alone our treatment of
others.

However, it seems Sirius' statement is less
about Crouch's actual treatment of his so
called elfish inferiors and more about his at
titude toward them. What both Sirius and
Hermione find appalling is Crouch's imme
diate assumption not only that he has much
more to contribute to the greater wizarding

world than his house-elf does, but also that he
has infinitely more to bestow upon Winky
than she does upon him.
Here at Stanford, we are just as suscepti
ble to falling victim to these same harmful at
titudes that we direct toward those around
us. Oftentimes, the constant pressure for us to
make use of our education to better the
world has the potential to unintentionally
foster the development of a sort of Crouch

self-importance, or at least the romantic no
tion that we are destined to follow a higher
life calling than others. Because we do not, by
any means, develop these attitudes intention
ally, they are even more damaging than they
might be if we did. It is not until close inspec
tion that it becomes clear that a lack of basic
respect for those who might be deemed polit
ically, economically and socially inferior does
pervade our campus to some degree.
Like Crouch, it is the nuances in our be
havior and words that reveal this dangerous
attitude. For example, a careless disregard for
our facilities and for the work of non-faculty
staff might suggest a burgeoning Crouch-it
tude. Even more subtle are instances when
we blurt statements like, "If I can't do this, I'll
have to be a bus driver!" without thinking
critically about how these statements can de
mean others. Because less prestigious and
profitable professions are not the end goal
for so many of us, and understandably so, we
can easily be influenced to view those who
hold such professions not only as inferior in a
purely wealth and power sense but also as
people with less to contribute and somehow
less to be proud of.
Setting aside for a moment the drive to go
and fix the world and serve the underprivi
leged, a serious-Sirius character examination
might be a worthwhile way to reorient us
with the purpose and motivation behind such
aspirations. Sirius reminds us that our char
acter is simply reflected in how we are able to
appreciate each person as, well, a person.
Who we are, then, is not defined by our deal
ings with those whom we have every worldly
reason to treat well, but rather by how in
tune we actually are with the belief that every
human being has something equally worth
while to offer.
Yet another reason not to be like Crouch?
His son later kills him and transfigures him
into a bone. Not that that necessarily relates
to his quality of character. Just saying, that re
ally sucks.
