Dear Editor:

In Danny Crichton's column this week, he
cited the declining numbers of male college
students as cause to open a discussion about a
male community center. However, these sta
tistics poorly reflect what is actually happen
ing at Stanford. As an elite university, Stanford
has maintained gender balance because it
draws from a different demographic than the
"average" university. While I agree that the
declining numbers of men attending college
are deeply disturbing, the reality is that these
numbers are consistently used by the upper
and middle classes to fight for resources for
demographics that are not struggling.
If one looks at the percentages of males
going to college broken down by class and eth
nic background, one will see that it is a very
specific demographic that is responsible for
skewing those numbers working-class
males of all ethnic backgrounds. At the high
est levels of income, males attend college at a
slightly higher rate than women. In the middle
classes, gender balance is almost equal. Yet, at
the working-class level, the rates of men at
tending college plummet far below the rates
of women.

This happens within the context of signif
icant under-representation of working class
people, especially at the elite level. To turn
this into a discussion about how middle- and
upper-class males are being unfairly treated
diverts attention, energy and resources away
from confronting the real problems in low
income communities regarding college ac
cess and retention. We do not need a male
community center to fix declining male at
tendance; we need access to better education
at the primary and secondary levels for all
people, regardless of their socio-economic
background something we are currently
failing to provide.

Dear Editor:
What fun the theme for the 2009
Gaieties is "Apocalyse Cal," playing off
the famous Coppola film, photoshopping
its graphics of napalm blazing and helicop
ters strafing the campus (wait, shouldn't it
be a scene of the Campanile getting
torched? Doesn't bode well for the out
come of the Game, guys. Besides, we lost
that war, remember?). The Vietnam War,
which saw the deaths of at least three mil
lion Vietnamese, 1.5 Cambodians and Lao
tians, and sixty thousand U.S. soldiers, not

to mention those maimed, wounded, incar
cerated, tortured, and the tremendous cost
on American society, has been appropriat
ed to give color and humor to the Big
Game. I vote for next year's theme to be
"Terrorize Cal," with a nice shot of the
twin towers, bodies falling and all. Whoev
er thought of this, and whoever approved
it, should be ashamed.
