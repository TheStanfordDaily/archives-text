## How can a team win in the Pac-10? In the words of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly, "get Toby Gerhart and Andrew Luck to transfer to their school" Gerhart should be Heisman frontrunner

Stanford senior running back Toby
Gerhart should not be "bursting
onto the scene," and he should not
be a "dark horse" Heisman Trophy
candidate.
Toby Gerhart deserves to win the Heis
man Trophy. Seriously.
Let's just start with some basic infor
mation. Gerhart is second in the nation
with 1,217 rushing yards in nine games, for
an average of just over 135 yards per game.
He is also second in the nation (and first
among running backs) in scoring with 16
rushing touchdowns, along with two two
point conversions.
That right there is enough to put him
squarely in the Heisman race. But looking
deeper, his performance is even more im
pressive.
Some argue (fairly or unfairly) that the
Heisman Trophy is more of a Most Valu
able Player award, rather than an award
honoring the best player. Well, Gerhart fits
the bill for that too.
Gerhart has carried the ball an as
tounding 233 times in nine games this sea
son (about 26 carries per game), which is
easily the most in the country and more
than some entire teams. Clearly, he carries
the load for Stanford more than any other
back does for a program.
Stanford's star tailback unsurprisingly
also has an enormous impact on his team's
success. When Gerhart receives more than
20 carries, Stanford is 6-1, while the Cardi
nal is 0-2 when he does not eclipse 20 car
ries. So the secret to Stanford's success is
not much of a secret.
And the defenses against Stanford
clearly know this, so one would assume
that good defenses find away of shutting
him down. One would be wrong making
this assumption. Despite receiving so
many carries and being the undeniable
focal point of Stanford's offense, Gerhart
has averaged at least 4.4 yards per carry in
every game so far this season, making him
the most consistently dominant runner in
the nation. Don't believe me? Find me an
other runner that averages even 20 carries
per game and hasn't had a game under 4
yards per carry.
You can't, because Gerhart is the only
one in the Football Bowl Subdivision (Di
vision I-A to most people).
Despite his unbelievable numbers,
some stubborn people think that numbers
lie and only the eye test can show a player's
true value, which is why a Texas Tech quar
terback hasn't won the Heisman each of
the last five years. Anyone who has
watched Gerhart play knows what a bruis
ing workhorse he is and it is fair to say that
he breaks tackles that would take down
anyone else in the nation. In particular,
Gerhart stepped up when his team needed
him the most, racking up an absurd 223
yards (a Stanford record) and three touch
downs on 38 carries in Stanford's impres
sive dismantling of the vaunted Oregon
defense on Saturday.
As ESPN.com Pac-10 blogger Ted
Miller succinctly put it: "1. Are rushing
yards and touchdowns important for a
running back? 2. If so, why isn't Gerhart on
