## How can a team win in the Pac-10? In the words of Oregon head coach Chip Kelly, "get Toby Gerhart and Andrew Luck to transfer to their school" Gerhart should be Heisman frontrunner 
### Jacob Jaffe 
Stanford senior running back Toby
Gerhart should not be "bursting
onto the scene," and he should not
be a "dark horse" Heisman Trophy
candidate.
Toby Gerhart deserves to win the Heis
man Trophy. Seriously.
Let's just start with some basic infor
mation. Gerhart is second in the nation
with 1,217 rushing yards in nine games, for
an average of just over 135 yards per game.
He is also second in the nation (and first
among running backs) in scoring with 16
rushing touchdowns, along with two two
point conversions.
That right there is enough to put him
squarely in the Heisman race. But looking
deeper, his performance is even more im
pressive.
Some argue (fairly or unfairly) that the
Heisman Trophy is more of a Most Valu
able Player award, rather than an award
honoring the best player. Well, Gerhart fits
the bill for that too.
Gerhart has carried the ball an as
tounding 233 times in nine games this sea
son (about 26 carries per game), which is
easily the most in the country and more
than some entire teams. Clearly, he carries
the load for Stanford more than any other
back does for a program.
Stanford's star tailback unsurprisingly
also has an enormous impact on his team's
success. When Gerhart receives more than
20 carries, Stanford is 6-1, while the Cardi
nal is 0-2 when he does not eclipse 20 car
ries. So the secret to Stanford's success is
not much of a secret.
And the defenses against Stanford
clearly know this, so one would assume
that good defenses find away of shutting
him down. One would be wrong making
this assumption. Despite receiving so
many carries and being the undeniable
focal point of Stanford's offense, Gerhart
has averaged at least 4.4 yards per carry in
every game so far this season, making him
the most consistently dominant runner in
the nation. Don't believe me? Find me an
other runner that averages even 20 carries
per game and hasn't had a game under 4
yards per carry.
You can't, because Gerhart is the only
one in the Football Bowl Subdivision (Di
vision I-A to most people).
Despite his unbelievable numbers,
some stubborn people think that numbers
lie and only the eye test can show a player's
true value, which is why a Texas Tech quar
terback hasn't won the Heisman each of
the last five years. Anyone who has
watched Gerhart play knows what a bruis
ing workhorse he is and it is fair to say that
he breaks tackles that would take down
anyone else in the nation. In particular,
Gerhart stepped up when his team needed
him the most, racking up an absurd 223
yards (a Stanford record) and three touch
downs on 38 carries in Stanford's impres
sive dismantling of the vaunted Oregon
defense on Saturday.
As ESPN.com Pac-10 blogger Ted
Miller succinctly put it: "1. Are rushing
yards and touchdowns important for a
running back? 2. If so, why isn't Gerhart on

every Heisman Trophy list?"
Well, if you haven't noticed, Ger
hart isn't on everyone's lists yet and
he's certainly not on the top of many.
On ESPN.com, he received only four
fifth-place votes out of 15 voters and
no one voted him higher than fifth. If
Gerhart isn't garnering national re
spect, who is?
The biggest competition, by far, for
Gerhart is Alabama sophomore run
ning back Mark Ingram, who is first
on ESPN.com's ballot, receiving 10 of
the 15 first place votes. Is Ingram that
much better than Gerhart?
Quite simply, no. Ingram averages
127 yards per game to Gerhart's 135
and Gerhart has twice as many touch
downs (16) as Ingram (8). Just think
about that, the most important thing a
running back can do is to score and
Gerhart scores twice as often as In
gram.
Normally, an Ingram supporter
would point out that Ingram faces
much more difficult competition than
Gerhart, because Ingram is in the
SEC. This year, though, the SEC has
some abysmal defenses and the Pac
-10 is actually better in terms of rush
ing defense, allowing 133 yards per
game (122 not counting Washington
State), compared to 136 yards per
game in the SEC (132 not counting
Kentucky).
In particular, Ingram has played
against much poorer competition
than Gerhart Ingram has not
played any team ranked higher than
39th in rush defense and three of his
opponents are ranked worse than
100 th in rush defense. Gerhart, on the
other hand, has played three of the
top 15 rush defenses and has played
only one opponent worse than 100 th
(San Jose State).
Every statistic favors Gerhart, so it
is tough to see why he should be
ranked below Mark Ingram.
The only player with more rushing
yards than Gerhart, Fresno State's
Ryan Mathews, plays in the WAC, so
he has played four of the 13 worst rush
defenses in the nation and has not
played any of the top 15 rush defens
es.
No running back can put up num
bers comparable to Toby Gerhart and
few players in other positions can
compete.
Clemson's C.J. Spiller, despite his

explosiveness, is primarily a running
back, yet is not even on pace to run for
a thousand yards this season.
Media favorites Florida quarter
back Tim Tebow and Texas quarter
back Colt McCoy have comparable
numbers to Andrew Luck, yet no one
puts him anywhere near Heisman dis
cussion.
The only player who has numbers
as impressive as Gerhart is Houston
quarterback Case Keenum, but his
performance is oddly reminiscent of
Graham Harrell (Texas Tech) and
Colt Brennan (Hawai'i). All three
light up the scoreboard for wide
open, pass-happy teams with subpar
defenses. Like Brennan, Keenum
plays for a team in a non-automatic
qualifying conference, so the quality
of his competition is constantly ques
tioned. Like Harrell, Keenum con
stantly plays in shootouts that en
hance his statistics without impressing
voters. In case you didn't notice, nei
ther Harrell nor Brennan won the
Heisman and every Heisman winner
since 1990 has been from a BCS-con
ference team.
Quite frankly, no player in college
football can match the level of Toby
Gerhart's production against his level
of competition.
Luckily for Gerhart and anyone
who likes watching the best football
players play, the workhorse back has
three more chances to show what an
unstoppable force he is.
Hopefully Heisman voters start
taking notice.
