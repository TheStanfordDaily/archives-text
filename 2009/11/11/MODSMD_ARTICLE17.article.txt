# Luck finds himself among nation's best
##

Jim Harbaugh is not afraid of mak
ing bold statements and two weeks
ago, he offered one of his most pub
licized comments to date,
"I think Andrew is the best quarter
back in the country. I have not seen a bet
ter one," he said.
Andrew, of course, is Andrew Luck,
the Cardinal's redshirt freshman signal
caller, who, at that point, had led Stanford
to a 5-3 record in his first season as a
starter. The quote made the national
rounds and while most were quick to
point out Luck's talent, the consensus
was that Harbaugh, a notoriously enthu
siastic coach, had lost perspective while
hyping up his young phenom.
Or not.
Here is what's certain: Luck is the best
freshman quarterback in the country and
he's performing as well any passer in the
Pac-10 he is smack in the hunt for first
team conference honors. He is among the
top, nationally, in a number of statistical
categories and in terms of talent, intelli
gence and leadership, few compare.
He may not be the best yet but
he's making a case with each passing
week.
Statistically, Luck is ninth, 11th and
27th nationally in passing efficiency, pass
er rating and total offense, respectively.
In perhaps the most important metric of
quarterback performance yards per
attempt Luck is first in the country.
You read that right: not the conference,
the entirety of Division 1. Remember,
this is a freshman.
But merely examining a box score is
not enough to appreciate Luck's talent.
While we could point to a 423-yard out
burst against a highly regarded Arizona
secondary or any number of highlights
throughout the year, let's look at one play
from Saturday's game in particular, a 40-
yard completion to sophomore receiver
Chris Owusu.
Owusu ran a post across the middle
and was blanketed by Talmadge Jackson
111, Oregon's top cornerback. Still, Owusu
led by half a step and Luck decided to go
to him. Only there was a problem: Owusu
didn't have his eyes on the ball.
He turned at quite literally the last
millisecond and had to do little more
than clasp his hands Luck had pinned
the ball between the "8" and the "1" on
Owusu's jersey from over 40 yards away.
"I wasn't even looking and the ball
was right there," Owusu said. "I think we
have a great quarterback who is a great
leader and has great accuracy."
"It's one thing to place the ball on a
10-yard route or 15-yard route," said
Harbaugh, a formerly elite quarterback
himself. "But when you start placing
them on 50,55 and 45-yard routes, those
are great throws."
And that was just one toss amongst
many. He went for Owusu deep again
and, despite quadruple coverage, Luck
hit his man right on the hands the only
thing preventing a catch was a jarring hit
from an Oregon defender.
His maturation has been impressive
