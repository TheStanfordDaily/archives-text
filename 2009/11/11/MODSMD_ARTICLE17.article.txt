# Luck finds himself among nation's best
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky 
Jim Harbaugh is not afraid of mak
ing bold statements and two weeks
ago, he offered one of his most pub
licized comments to date,
"I think Andrew is the best quarter
back in the country. I have not seen a bet
ter one," he said.
Andrew, of course, is Andrew Luck,
the Cardinal's redshirt freshman signal
caller, who, at that point, had led Stanford
to a 5-3 record in his first season as a
starter. The quote made the national
rounds and while most were quick to
point out Luck's talent, the consensus
was that Harbaugh, a notoriously enthu
siastic coach, had lost perspective while
hyping up his young phenom.
Or not.
Here is what's certain: Luck is the best
freshman quarterback in the country and
he's performing as well any passer in the
Pac-10 he is smack in the hunt for first
team conference honors. He is among the
top, nationally, in a number of statistical
categories and in terms of talent, intelli
gence and leadership, few compare.
He may not be the best yet but
he's making a case with each passing
week.
Statistically, Luck is ninth, 11th and
27th nationally in passing efficiency, pass
er rating and total offense, respectively.
In perhaps the most important metric of
quarterback performance yards per
attempt Luck is first in the country.
You read that right: not the conference,
the entirety of Division 1. Remember,
this is a freshman.
But merely examining a box score is
not enough to appreciate Luck's talent.
While we could point to a 423-yard out
burst against a highly regarded Arizona
secondary or any number of highlights
throughout the year, let's look at one play
from Saturday's game in particular, a 40-
yard completion to sophomore receiver
Chris Owusu.
Owusu ran a post across the middle
and was blanketed by Talmadge Jackson
111, Oregon's top cornerback. Still, Owusu
led by half a step and Luck decided to go
to him. Only there was a problem: Owusu
didn't have his eyes on the ball.
He turned at quite literally the last
millisecond and had to do little more
than clasp his hands Luck had pinned
the ball between the "8" and the "1" on
Owusu's jersey from over 40 yards away.
"I wasn't even looking and the ball
was right there," Owusu said. "I think we
have a great quarterback who is a great
leader and has great accuracy."
"It's one thing to place the ball on a
10-yard route or 15-yard route," said
Harbaugh, a formerly elite quarterback
himself. "But when you start placing
them on 50,55 and 45-yard routes, those
are great throws."
And that was just one toss amongst
many. He went for Owusu deep again
and, despite quadruple coverage, Luck
hit his man right on the hands the only
thing preventing a catch was a jarring hit
from an Oregon defender.
His maturation has been impressive


JONATHAN YORK/Staff Photographer
though he was effective from his
first start, he was susceptible to the
occasional rookie error. But he has
rectified such mistakes and his per
formance thus far has been so out
standing that the names Elway and
Plunkett have started to enter more
and more conversations about the
young passer a spot in the pan
theon of elite Cardinal quarterbacks
is his for the taking.
While Luck himself would be the
first to admit that there's still room
for improvement, he possesses liter
ally every desirable quarterback
trait. His arm is both strong and ac
curate; he has good pocket presence,
but is a fine runner; and his leader
ship skills, intelligence and football
IQ are all tremendously high.
The comparisons at the collegiate
level are fleeting, given that the top
quarterbacks play out of either pass
happy systems (Boise State Kellen
Moore and Houston's Case
Keenum) or a version of the spread
(Florida's Tim Tebow and Colt
McCoy of Texas), while Luck oper
ates out of a balanced, pro-style of
fense. As a result, Luck is not just

displaying skills effective at the col
legiate level, but at the professional
one, too. Oklahoma's Sam Bradford
may be most similar to Luck and
even then, Bradford works out of
the shotgun much of the time, while
Luck is constantly under center.
Given his natural gifts and the
scheme he works in, it is no surprise
that Luck is considered a top
prospect and potential No. 1
overall pick for whichever draft
he decides to enter (he's eligible be
ginning in 2011).
In the meantime, he has a colle
giate career to tackle. His stellar

play has elevated him above the
likes of USC's Matt Barkley and
Michigan's Tate Forcier (both re
markably average after fast starts)
as the best freshman quarterback in
the nation. In the Pac-10, he can
make an impenetrable case for first
team honors if he maintains his per
formance over the last three weeks
doing so would elevate him to
the national conversation on best
passers in the game. Given the im
pending graduation of collegiate
stalwarts like Tebow and McCoy,
the debate becomes all the more le
gitimate.

Ultimately, it appears that Har
baugh may get the last laugh. After
defeating the No. 8 Ducks, he went
home to watch the game tape. It did
n't take long for him to post a re
sponse to those who had ridiculed
his early assertions. He tweeted,
with appropriate sarcasm:
"I guess I was wrong and all the
experts were right: Andrew Luck
clearly needs three more years of
seasoning. There are better QBs out
there."

the ball between the "8" and the "1" on
Owusu's jersey from over 40 yards away.
"I wasn't even looking and the ball
was right there," Owusu said. "I think we
have a great quarterback who is a great
leader and has great accuracy."
"It's one thing to place the ball on a
10-yard route or 15-yard route," said
Harbaugh, a formerly elite quarterback
himself. "But when you start placing
them on 50,55 and 45-yard routes, those
are great throws."
And that was just one toss amongst
many. He went for Owusu deep again
and, despite quadruple coverage, Luck
hit his man right on the hands the only
thing preventing a catch was a jarring hit
from an Oregon defender.
His maturation has been impressive


JONATHAN YORK/Staff Photographer
though he was effective from his
first start, he was susceptible to the
occasional rookie error. But he has
rectified such mistakes and his per
formance thus far has been so out
standing that the names Elway and
Plunkett have started to enter more
and more conversations about the
young passer a spot in the pan
theon of elite Cardinal quarterbacks
is his for the taking.
While Luck himself would be the
first to admit that there's still room
for improvement, he possesses liter
ally every desirable quarterback
trait. His arm is both strong and ac
curate; he has good pocket presence,
but is a fine runner; and his leader
ship skills, intelligence and football
IQ are all tremendously high.
The comparisons at the collegiate
level are fleeting, given that the top
quarterbacks play out of either pass
happy systems (Boise State Kellen
Moore and Houston's Case
Keenum) or a version of the spread
(Florida's Tim Tebow and Colt
McCoy of Texas), while Luck oper
ates out of a balanced, pro-style of
fense. As a result, Luck is not just

displaying skills effective at the col
legiate level, but at the professional
one, too. Oklahoma's Sam Bradford
may be most similar to Luck and
even then, Bradford works out of
the shotgun much of the time, while
Luck is constantly under center.
Given his natural gifts and the
scheme he works in, it is no surprise
that Luck is considered a top
prospect and potential No. 1
overall pick for whichever draft
he decides to enter (he's eligible be
ginning in 2011).
In the meantime, he has a colle
giate career to tackle. His stellar

play has elevated him above the
likes of USC's Matt Barkley and
Michigan's Tate Forcier (both re
markably average after fast starts)
as the best freshman quarterback in
the nation. In the Pac-10, he can
make an impenetrable case for first
team honors if he maintains his per
formance over the last three weeks
doing so would elevate him to
the national conversation on best
passers in the game. Given the im
pending graduation of collegiate
stalwarts like Tebow and McCoy,
the debate becomes all the more le
gitimate.

Ultimately, it appears that Har
baugh may get the last laugh. After
defeating the No. 8 Ducks, he went
home to watch the game tape. It did
n't take long for him to post a re
sponse to those who had ridiculed
his early assertions. He tweeted,
with appropriate sarcasm:
"I guess I was wrong and all the
experts were right: Andrew Luck
clearly needs three more years of
seasoning. There are better QBs out
there."
