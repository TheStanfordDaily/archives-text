# DIGGING FOR
## HISTORY 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO 
It's been two years since junior libera Gabi
Ailes first experienced a breakout per
formance playing Stanford volleyball and
she is currently on track to be better than
any libero that has come before her on The
Farm.

Ailes sits at a close second to the career digs
record holder Kristin Richards, who played at
Stanford from 2003 to 2006. Richards holds the
career digs record with 1,597. Ailes, not quite
finished with her junior season, currently has
1,493. She has already taken three other Stan
ford records: most digs in a season (533) in
2007, most digs per set (4.26) in 2007 and most
digs in a single match (33) in 2009.

Her role on the team has transformed from
a rookie standout in her freshman year, when
she earned the Pac-10 All-Freshmen Honor
able Mention, to her sophomore year, when she
captured her I,oooth career dig and also earned
the Pac-10 All-Academic Honorable Mention.

This season alone, Ailes has tallied more
than 30 digs three times: against USC (Oct. 3),
Oregon State (Oct. 16) and UCLA (Oct. 31).
She has registered more than 20 a total of 11
times this season thus far.

And while the record-breaking keeps com
ing up in Ailes' career, she keeps a level head
about it all.
"I don't focus on it. I'd rather win as a team
than get personal records," Ailes said. "It's a
team sport, so it's not like track or swimming
when you go after your own record or someone
else's record."

The Nebraska native comes from a family of
volleyball players, including older sister Tatum,
a former libero for the University of Missouri.
After her sister received much recognition for
her stellar career at Mizzou, Ailes acknowl
edges the slightly easier transition to recogni
tion in the volleyball world.

"It's been a little easier on me," Ailes admit
ted. "Having her do really well in the volleyball
world kind of put my name out there."
While her name is now a formidable pres
ence, especially playing in one of the more
charged conferences in the nation, Ailes re

mains family-oriented. Her most memorable
moments include times when her family was
around to share her love of volleyball.
"I would say playing in front of my family
back in Nebraska for the semifinal match
against Texas was probably my favorite volley
ball moment," she said.
Not only is her favorite volleyball moment
family oriented, but even her "volleyball ori
gins" revolve around her relatives.
"My family has played my whole life," she
explained. "The earliest memory I have was
when I was four during the national champi
onship football game for Nebraska, during the
halftime my parents would play with me. I was
n't much into watching football at that age."
Evidently family and volleyball are Ailes'
most treasured aspects of life; without the two, she
says, she doesn't know what she would be doing.
However, volleyball has also led Ailes and
her teammates to another hobby: eating.
"The team favorite this year seems to be
anything with honey on it: English muffins with
butter and honey or strawberries with honey,"
said Ailes. "Honey is the favorite spread this
year. Last year it was peanut butter."
This competitive, yet lighthearted player

loves being around her team and plans to be
around her teammates in the future as well.
"I would like to play for as long as I can. I
joke around with Cassidy [Lichtman] and we
say we're going to play for as long as we can,
until we're like 70," said Ailes.
While Ailes has primarily focused on volley
ball at Stanford, the Science, Technology and
Society major's favorite thing on The Farm
and one of the most interesting, she claims
has been being a TA for American Sign Lan
guage. Ailes is almost fluent in it.
Among the academic opportunities Stan
ford has offered her, she will always remember
it for the quirky traditions she experienced her
freshmen year.
"The first night on campus with everyone
here for Band Run was a pretty eye-opening
experience," she said.
In the end, being at Stanford is much more
than keeping the traditions, learning new lan
guages and breaking records for Ailes it is
about contributing to the community by doing
what she loves and what makes her happiest.
