# RECREATION HITS THE WEB

### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
Everyone, their mothers and even their
grandmothers have logged on to Face
book by now and Stanford has never
been one to let a trend pass it by. With
the creation of a Facebook page and Twitter
account, accompanied by the integration of
several other new technological aids, the Stan
ford recreational facilities hope to improve
their student and faculty outreach this year.
"We're trying to get with the twenty-first
century," said Coordinator of Marketing
Steven DiPaolo.
In the name of modernity, the Stanford
recreation Twitter account went live last week.
So far boasting two tweets and seven follow
ers, @Stanfordrec will provide the Stanford
community with information on upcoming
events and programs offered by the gyms. The
Rivals for Life Blood Drive against Berkeley
is the current hot topic.
Assisted by a team of student interns who
help in generating ideas, the recreational facil
ities will also create a Facebook page in order
to foster greater student involvement.
"Students don't want to get saddled with
loads of paper," DiPaolo said. "It's such an on
line and computer-driven culture,"

"Facebook and Twitter has been on our
minds for the last six months to a year, but now
that we have some extra hands we're able to

make it more of a reality," he added.
As more and more companies and profes
sional corporations as well as university
programs and faculty departments inte
grate Facebook into their operations, the moti
vation to add Stanford Rec to the list in
creased. The Intramural sports program al
ready has a Facebook page, with which the Rec
program hopes to connect.
"We're trying to get more in touch, espe
cially with the students. They might not spend
time on our department Web site or reading
our quarterly newsletter," DiPaolo said. "Face
book is a great way to get directly into their in
boxes."
Attracting Stanford students to work out
has rarely been a problem. Last year, the recre
ational facilities around campus, including the
Arrillaga gym, the Tressider gym and the
aquatic center, logged approximately 2000 vis
its per day. That's over 362,000 per year. Stan
ford has one fit campus. But the facility staff al
ways continues working to listen to sugges
tions and adapt to the student body's needs.
"We're open to solicitation to any or all
ideas," said Eric Stein, senior associate athletic
director for physical education, recreation and
wellness.
Their innovative approaches paid off, as
Stanford University recently achieved victory
in the annual Pac-10 Fitness Challenge for the
third year in a row, as many years as the Chal
lenge has been in existence. Intensive campus
email campaigns and encouragement by

ASSU Executive David Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO
helped push Stanford to log 697,882 minutes of
physical activity in five days.
All these pushes for online publicity have
also helped the Rec program in other ways.
"With the budget crunch, our paper mar
keting has gone right out the window," DiPao
lo said. "We're moving as much as we can to an
online platform."
Stein also mentioned that the environment
can appreciate these technological efforts.
"We're being as green as possible," he com
mented.
The Rec facilities have also implemented a
third technological approach to encourage
student and faculty relations, one that has not
received much publicity thus far. Last year
Stanford partnered with the Hothand Wireless
program, a service that keeps people updated
about gym openings and closings, signup dead
lines for tournaments or programs and what
ever other fitness related news people want,
through texts, emails, or both.
Hothand Wireless partnered with the Pac
-10 schools in 2008 to help promote the second
annual Pac-10 Fitness Challenge. Now, a year
later, Stanford's program has only about 100
users.
"It's still pretty fresh," DiPaolo said, "[but]
we will integrate it with Facebook and Twitter.
The ease of it puts such value in it and it's free.
It will make things as convenient as possible, so
we offer it for those who want to
take advantage."
Those who sign up for Hothand
can choose what specifics they
would like to be notified about,
choosing from a long list including
basketball, dodgeball, employment
opportunities, ultimate Frisbee, field
updates, special events and many
more.
With Facebook, Twitter and Flot
hand, the Stanford recreational fa
cilities hope to create greater aware
ness throughout campus of the ac
tive programming and opportuni
ties they offer.
"We're trying to remain as non
stagnant and exciting as possible,"
DiPaolo said.
