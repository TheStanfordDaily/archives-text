## Haas to reevaluate effectiveness Meeting gauges student opinion to generate five-year plan 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
The Haas Center in the first stages of
reevaluating its outreach toward Stanford stu
dents and the community in the public service
arena hosted a town hall meeting last night
in conjunction with the ASSU Executive
Service Team to gauge students' opinions on
its overall effectiveness.
The meeting was the first step of creating a
five-year plan for a reevaluation of the center
on the eve of its 25th anniversary. According
to Haas Center Executive Director Tom
Schnaubelt, no concrete plan could have been
put into action until students were surveyed.
"Students are among the first people for us
to go out and talk to, and there really isn't a
plan yet," Schnaubelt said at the meeting.
"This is a process for us to get feedback to
begin the planning process."
He emphasized the important role stu
dents can play in developing the new direc
tion for the Haas Center, which was founded
in 1984 by students who were hoping to take
action in the public service arena.
"It is essential to have student voices
because [service] happens all across campus;
it doesn't just happen at the Haas Center,"
Schnaubelt said. "We're hoping to broaden
the concept for what we think about when we
think of public service."
Defining what kinds of outreach are avail
able from Haas was a major topic of the
evening, as well as how to make participating
more appealing.
"Public service doesn't need to be on the
side," said Philippe de Koning 'lO. "The vari
ety of public service and community service
groups is astounding here already. The diver
sity shows me that people with very funda
mentally different interests can find their
niche in public service."
Carolyn Simmons 'l3 echoed concerns of a
typical Stanford student's available time to
commit to public service. "There is a huge
emphasis on direct service, especially geared
toward freshmen," she said. "If I was not on
the service committee of the ASSU, then I
probably wouldn't be aware of opportunities
other than direct service."
Simmons added that a remedy to this
might be to emphasize one-time commit
ments, such as participating in Dance
Marathon.
ASSU President David Gobaud 'OB, M.S.
'lO also said the ASSU executive team is
looking to promote more "nontraditional"
events incorporating engineering and com
puter science majors. Among these would be
Dance Marathon's "Hackathon," a
24-hour programming challenge
benefitting nonprofit social projects.
The Haas Center has also
recruited an alumni team, com
posed of eight Graduate School of
Business (GSB) students who will
assess data and consider options for
potential changes. Gobaud also
noted that associating the ASSU
executive branch with the meeting
allowed for graduate students to be
involved in the discussions.
"We're trying to get the student
body to know about different branch
es, because people get confused,"
Gobaud said. "The strategic plan is a
very significant, very large project,
and it is very important to have stu
dent input in the planning process."

The meeting was broken up into
several small focus groups, led by
ASSU executive facilitators.
Groups were created from the 60
students who attended the meeting,
some of whom already had already
been involved with the center.
"When I think of Haas, I think of
teaching kids to read and things that
are really hands-on and helping the
community," said political science
graduate student Danielle Harlan.
"I guess it's vague as to what 'direct
service' is in terms of Haas."
Schnaubelt expressed hope after
receiving feedback from students.
"It's not enough to study or just
think about [public service], but to
actually take the theory and put it
into practice," he said. "We're begin
ning to articulate that conversation
of what does Stanford do well and
where can it improve."
