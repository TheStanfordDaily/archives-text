# Parity runs amok in Pac-10
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
It has become almost cliche in college football
to rag on the Big Ten. You can practically
guarantee that a Big Ten team will get blown
out in the Rose Bowl every New Year's Day.
Now that Stanford football is ranked No. 25 in
the nation in the Associated Press (AP) Poll, it
seems logical that the Pac-10 Conference has en
trenched itself in the upper echelon of collegiate
football. After all, the Pac-10 boasts four teams
ranked in the AP Poll, tied for most in the nation
But look at the actual numbers.
The SEC and Big 12, perceived by most ex
perts as the top two conferences in the nation, at
least at the beginning of the season, each only
have three teams ranked in the Top 25. The Big
East, a solid but unspectacular member of the
"Big Six" conferences, also has three teams
ranked.

The Pac-10 has four: USC, Oregon, Arizona
and Stanford. Which conference is tied with the
Pac-10 with four other ranked teams?
Yep, you guessed it. The Big Ten.
Stanford cracking into the rankings for the
first time since 2001 may cause the Pac-10 to enter
the dreaded Big Ten Zone.
What is the Big Ten Zone? It's a conference

that fails to establish any elite team and feasts
upon itself with the alleged top teams routinely
suffering "upsets" to the bottom feeders of the
conference.
Sounds a lot like the Pac-10. USC annihilates
Cal in Berkeley, only to have its ego checked by
Oregon.The Ducks respond by letting Toby Ger
hart and the rest of the Cardinal run right down
its throat. Washington beats USC, but loses to
lowly Arizona State and UCLA. Oregon State
imposes its will on Stanford, only to lose at home
to Arizona.
There is no clarity, no order and no sense to the
inner workings of the Pac-10.
The SEC is much more orderly. Only three
teams are ranked, but Florida is No. 1, Alabama
No. 3 and LSU No. 9. The conference doesn't fall
prey to any Pac-10-esque upsets, either. LSU lost
to Florida 13-3 and Alabama 24-15.
It is clear who runs the conference and as a re
sult, an SEC team will almost undoubtedly be
playing in the national championship game.
The same cannot be said for the Pac-10 or the
Big Ten, as neither conference, barring a miracle,
will send a team to the title game.
The parity in the Pac-10 and Big Ten is not nec

essarily a bad thing. Something about guessing
whether Florida is going to blow out Kentucky by
30 or 35 gets a little old.
Any game in the Pac-10 can be a good game
(except for one featuring Washington State).
Week in and week out, there's always a legitimate
chance for an upset. Tennessee pulling off an
upset over 'Bama doesn't seem nearly as plausi
ble as, say, UCLA over USC.
What the parity does mean, however, is that it
will be tough for the Pac-10 to establish itself as
the premier conference in football. USC may end
up playing in the Sun Bowl this year in El Paso.
Having the flag bearer of your conference play
ing in Middle of Nowhere, Texas during bowl sea
son will not help the public perception of the con
ference.

The only thing saving the Pac-10 from official
ly entering the Big Ten Zone is its bowl record
Pac-10 teams went a combined 5-0 last year in
bowl games. If the Pac-10 continues to play well in
bowls, it can still be thought of as a top-tier confer
ence. But there's only so much Oregon State's 3-
0 victory over Pittsburgh in the Sun Bowl last sea-
son can do to help a conference's
cache.

With all that being said, the rest of
the Pac-10 can kiss our ranked Cardi
nal ass. Stanford is going bowling. Cal
isn't ranked. We just beat the No. 7
team in the nation and have an actual
ly meaningful game against USC this
weekend. It doesn't get much better
than that.

Mike Lazarus just found something to
be upset about now that Stanford is
ranked. Tell him to relax at
