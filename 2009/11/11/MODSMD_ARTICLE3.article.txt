# Uncertainty Overseas
## Overseas programs face major fiscal questions over next five years 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's overseas programs are facing a
period of deep fiscal uncertainty expected to last
for the next three to five years, and cuts have
been made across the globe in an effort to ensure
stability.
The Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP)
has reduced its spending by approximately $1
million for this year, according to BOSP
Director Norman Naimark. Naimark said the
cuts have focused on the administrative end of
the program.
"We have substantially reduced discretionary
spending in the home office and abroad,
including such things as travel, technology refresh

and other non-academic office expenses,"
Naimark wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman said BOSP administration has
been pared "to the bone" with the cuts. BOSP has
also put a hold on its overseas seminars program,
saving the program an expected half-million dol
lars, and the program did not replace one depart
ed staff member.
Two Fiscal Challenges
Bravman cited two central challenges to
BOSP's fiscal health: crucial endowments that
are "underwater" and therefore not paying out
viable amounts of money, and potentially
enormous fluctuations in the strength of the
dollar.

"I personally anticipate three to five years of
uncertainty here where we're constantly monitor
ing this," Bravman said. "It's not a yearly thing; it's
a constant thing."
The resources for individual overseas campus
es comes from a collective pool, and with that in
mind, Naimark stated that "the cuts were gener
ally spread evenly over the overseas centers
abroad, and the home office took a substantial
cut as well."
Overseas campuses are also sharing a concern
of fluctuations in the strength of the dollar the
largest uncertainty and perhaps the greatest chal
lenge for BOSP in upcoming years.
"No one knows what's going to happen, but

million-dollar-plus fluctuations in the
dollar, meaning a million dollar hit
on the BOSP budget, are possible,"
Bravman said. "This year, it saved us
about over a million dollars; the year
before it cost us over a million. So,
the swings as a function of our budg
et there are large, potentially, or have
been, but no one knows where it's
going."
The economic climate in the U.S.
and the continued decline of the dol
lar are also sources of concern, in
addition to the dollar's worrying
unpredictability.
"We cover our own currency
costs, and the projected continuing
weakening of the dollar versus
almost all of the currencies abroad
puts us in a very difficult position,"
Naimark said.
"The fall of the dollar versus the
euro is our biggest concern at the
moment," he added.
The dollar's potential decline
could also impact students' personal
budgets when abroad, another con
cern for program directors.
"If the dollar were to depreciate
further against the euro, this would
pose some problems both in terms of
the program's budget but also and
most importantly, in terms of our stu
dents' own personal budgets," wrote
Stanford in Florence Director Linda
Campani in an e-mail to The Daily.
"With a euro that is too strong, it
might get very expensive for students
to live in Europe."
Changes in the European econo
my, in particular, which houses
Oxford and Moscow in addition to
its four campuses in countries that
use the euro, are also a concern.
"If, for instance, right now, the
European economy, which is also
stumbling, if it was roaring along, I'm
sure the dollar would be much weak
er and we'd be in big trouble,"
Bravman said.
Building Reserves
The depletion of BOSP resources
as a result of underwater endow
ments, combined with the fiscal
uncertainty, comes at a time when
BOSP reserves are greatly dimin
ished, in what Bravman calls a "per
fect storm" and one that will
necessitate caution.
"We have to build our reserves
back up," Bravman said. "This is a
cycle. This is going to happen again ..
. Prudence suggests that there has to
be some kind of reasonable reserve
when the fluctuations are this large."
After a period of expansion,
including the recent additions of pro
grams in Beijing, Australia, Madrid
and Cape Town, Stanford's overseas
efforts also seem likely to turn away
from adding the fixed costs associat
ed with a new center. Bravman
pointed to the possibility of develop
ing a "significant international
internship program" instead, which
would avoid problems of fixed costs
while continuing the University's
emphasis on internationalization.
Bravman emphasized that the
long-term outlook for BOSP funding
is sound. "Long term, there's no
question here at all," he said. "This
program has tremendous funding.
But we need the endowment to grow
again."
Effects across the Globe
For now, despite medium-term
concerns, overseas program directors
are working within the reality of
tighter administrative budgets.
Directors reported, however, that for
the most part, students have been

shielded from the cuts.
"We in Santiago have indeed suf
fered some cuts, but fortunately they
have been in the administrative
rather than in the academic and cul
tural areas, which matter the most
insofar as the students' experience is
concerned," said Stanford in
Santiago Program Director Ivan
Jaksic in an e-mail to The Daily. "The
good news is that we will be able to
sustain all our Bing trips and cultural
events for the year, though we will
have to tighten our belts in just about
everything related to the office's
management."
Writing by e-mail, Stanford in
Madrid Director Santiago Tejerina-
Canal and Stanford in Florence
Director Linda Campani said the
impact on students at their programs
was also minimal. Stanford in
Moscow Director Alexander
Abashkin was also optimistic about
the impact on students, beyond a

reduction in museum visits, saying
the core academic experience was
safe.
"The least affected part is our cur
riculum," Abashkin wrote to The
Daily by e-mail. "This year, we can
offer our students the same academ
ic courses by the same excellent fac
ulty. The cuts mostly affected the
administrative side of our opera
tion."
Stanford in Oxford Director
Geoffrey Tyack added, in an e-mail
to The Daily, that he believes the cuts
haven't "materially affected the stu
dents' experiences, except perhaps
by giving them shorter and less ambi
tious Bing trips." Tyack said the pro
gram's core relationships with col
leges, access to facilities and course
and tutorial offerings were not
adversely affected.
Stanford's new program in Cape
Town also has to exercise caution.
"As we are a new program ... it

is hard to characterize limited fund
ing as 'cuts,'" wrote Stanford in
Cape Town Director Timothy
Stanton in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Rather, in preparing the budget for
the coming year, we have been
mindful of reduced resources avail
able to BOSP overall and have
made a strong effort to plan for a
program that is efficient and effec
tive in meeting its goals."

Overseas directors are united in
concern for the future, but also
accommodating to the cuts and
upbeat about their programs.
"It's a rough year, but I think it's
an exceptional one," Jaksic said. "I
have no concerns about the Santiago
program's future, though as an aca
demic citizen, I must worry about the
overall situation of the University
and its international programs."

abroad, and the home office took a substantial
cut as well."
Overseas campuses are also sharing a concern
of fluctuations in the strength of the dollar the
largest uncertainty and perhaps the greatest chal
lenge for BOSP in upcoming years.
"No one knows what's going to happen, but

million-dollar-plus fluctuations in the
dollar, meaning a million dollar hit
on the BOSP budget, are possible,"
Bravman said. "This year, it saved us
about over a million dollars; the year
before it cost us over a million. So,
the swings as a function of our budg
et there are large, potentially, or have
been, but no one knows where it's
going."
The economic climate in the U.S.
and the continued decline of the dol
lar are also sources of concern, in
addition to the dollar's worrying
unpredictability.
"We cover our own currency
costs, and the projected continuing
weakening of the dollar versus
almost all of the currencies abroad
puts us in a very difficult position,"
Naimark said.
"The fall of the dollar versus the
euro is our biggest concern at the
moment," he added.
The dollar's potential decline
could also impact students' personal
budgets when abroad, another con
cern for program directors.
"If the dollar were to depreciate
further against the euro, this would
pose some problems both in terms of
the program's budget but also and
most importantly, in terms of our stu
dents' own personal budgets," wrote
Stanford in Florence Director Linda
Campani in an e-mail to The Daily.
"With a euro that is too strong, it
might get very expensive for students
to live in Europe."
Changes in the European econo
my, in particular, which houses
Oxford and Moscow in addition to
its four campuses in countries that
use the euro, are also a concern.
"If, for instance, right now, the
European economy, which is also
stumbling, if it was roaring along, I'm
sure the dollar would be much weak
er and we'd be in big trouble,"
Bravman said.
Building Reserves
The depletion of BOSP resources
as a result of underwater endow
ments, combined with the fiscal
uncertainty, comes at a time when
BOSP reserves are greatly dimin
ished, in what Bravman calls a "per
fect storm" and one that will
necessitate caution.
"We have to build our reserves
back up," Bravman said. "This is a
cycle. This is going to happen again ..
. Prudence suggests that there has to
be some kind of reasonable reserve
when the fluctuations are this large."
After a period of expansion,
including the recent additions of pro
grams in Beijing, Australia, Madrid
and Cape Town, Stanford's overseas
efforts also seem likely to turn away
from adding the fixed costs associat
ed with a new center. Bravman
pointed to the possibility of develop
ing a "significant international
internship program" instead, which
would avoid problems of fixed costs
while continuing the University's
emphasis on internationalization.
Bravman emphasized that the
long-term outlook for BOSP funding
is sound. "Long term, there's no
question here at all," he said. "This
program has tremendous funding.
But we need the endowment to grow
again."
Effects across the Globe
For now, despite medium-term
concerns, overseas program directors
are working within the reality of
tighter administrative budgets.
Directors reported, however, that for
the most part, students have been

shielded from the cuts.
"We in Santiago have indeed suf
fered some cuts, but fortunately they
have been in the administrative
rather than in the academic and cul
tural areas, which matter the most
insofar as the students' experience is
concerned," said Stanford in
Santiago Program Director Ivan
Jaksic in an e-mail to The Daily. "The
good news is that we will be able to
sustain all our Bing trips and cultural
events for the year, though we will
have to tighten our belts in just about
everything related to the office's
management."
Writing by e-mail, Stanford in
Madrid Director Santiago Tejerina-
Canal and Stanford in Florence
Director Linda Campani said the
impact on students at their programs
was also minimal. Stanford in
Moscow Director Alexander
Abashkin was also optimistic about
the impact on students, beyond a

reduction in museum visits, saying
the core academic experience was
safe.
"The least affected part is our cur
riculum," Abashkin wrote to The
Daily by e-mail. "This year, we can
offer our students the same academ
ic courses by the same excellent fac
ulty. The cuts mostly affected the
administrative side of our opera
tion."
Stanford in Oxford Director
Geoffrey Tyack added, in an e-mail
to The Daily, that he believes the cuts
haven't "materially affected the stu
dents' experiences, except perhaps
by giving them shorter and less ambi
tious Bing trips." Tyack said the pro
gram's core relationships with col
leges, access to facilities and course
and tutorial offerings were not
adversely affected.
Stanford's new program in Cape
Town also has to exercise caution.
"As we are a new program ... it

is hard to characterize limited fund
ing as 'cuts,'" wrote Stanford in
Cape Town Director Timothy
Stanton in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Rather, in preparing the budget for
the coming year, we have been
mindful of reduced resources avail
able to BOSP overall and have
made a strong effort to plan for a
program that is efficient and effec
tive in meeting its goals."

Overseas directors are united in
concern for the future, but also
accommodating to the cuts and
upbeat about their programs.
"It's a rough year, but I think it's
an exceptional one," Jaksic said. "I
have no concerns about the Santiago
program's future, though as an aca
demic citizen, I must worry about the
overall situation of the University
and its international programs."

Stanford's overseas programs are facing a
period of deep fiscal uncertainty expected to last
for the next three to five years, and cuts have
been made across the globe in an effort to ensure
stability.
The Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP)
has reduced its spending by approximately $1
million for this year, according to BOSP
Director Norman Naimark. Naimark said the
cuts have focused on the administrative end of
the program.
"We have substantially reduced discretionary
spending in the home office and abroad,
including such things as travel, technology refresh

and other non-academic office expenses,"
Naimark wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman said BOSP administration has
been pared "to the bone" with the cuts. BOSP has
also put a hold on its overseas seminars program,
saving the program an expected half-million dol
lars, and the program did not replace one depart
ed staff member.
Two Fiscal Challenges
Bravman cited two central challenges to
BOSP's fiscal health: crucial endowments that
are "underwater" and therefore not paying out
viable amounts of money, and potentially
enormous fluctuations in the strength of the
dollar.

"I personally anticipate three to five years of
uncertainty here where we're constantly monitor
ing this," Bravman said. "It's not a yearly thing; it's
a constant thing."
The resources for individual overseas campus
es comes from a collective pool, and with that in
mind, Naimark stated that "the cuts were gener
ally spread evenly over the overseas centers
abroad, and the home office took a substantial
cut as well."
Overseas campuses are also sharing a concern
of fluctuations in the strength of the dollar the
largest uncertainty and perhaps the greatest chal
