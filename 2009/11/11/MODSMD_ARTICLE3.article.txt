## Overseas programs face major fiscal questions over next five years 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's overseas programs are facing a
period of deep fiscal uncertainty expected to last
for the next three to five years, and cuts have
been made across the globe in an effort to ensure
stability.
The Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP)
has reduced its spending by approximately $1
million for this year, according to BOSP
Director Norman Naimark. Naimark said the

spending in the home office and abroad,
including such things as travel, technology refresh

saving the program an expected half-million dol
lars, and the program did not replace one depart
ed staff member.
Two Fiscal Challenges
Bravman cited two central challenges to
BOSP's fiscal health: crucial endowments that
are "underwater" and therefore not paying out
viable amounts of money, and potentially
enormous fluctuations in the strength of the
dollar.

"I personally anticipate three to five years of
uncertainty here where we're constantly monitor

a constant thing."
The resources for individual overseas campus
es comes from a collective pool, and with that in
mind, Naimark stated that "the cuts were gener
ally spread evenly over the overseas centers
abroad, and the home office took a substantial
cut as well."
Overseas campuses are also sharing a concern
of fluctuations in the strength of the dollar the
largest uncertainty and perhaps the greatest chal
