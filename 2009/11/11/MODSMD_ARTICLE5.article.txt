Fred Hampton, Jr.,son of former Black Panther Party deputy Fred Hampton, Sr. and chairman of the Prisoners of Conscience Committee (POCC), spoke Tuesday at the Black
Community Center. Introduced by black-and-white videos of his father, he described how
Hampton, Sr. was assassinated by the Chicago Police Department while a gun was held
to the belly of his eight-months-pregnant mother. "I didn't have prenatal care," Hamtpon
said. "The first piece of metal I ever came into contact with was a Chicago Police
Department revolver." The POCC works to expose the oppression blacks still face. "We
are the great-grandchildren of Garvey, the offspring of Malcolm and the cubs of the Black
Panther Party," Hampton said. "We fight for self-determination."
