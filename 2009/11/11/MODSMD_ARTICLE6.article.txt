## Senate debates fiscal policies Confusion over fiscal approval reveals need to clarify VSO funding 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
What first appeared to be an isolated incident of
funding policy confusion at Tuesday's Undergraduate
Senate meeting quickly snowballed into a much larger
conversation on increasing transparency for volunteer
student organizations (VSOs) and applications for
appropriations funding.
Communications Chair Lee Jackson 'l2 delivered a
speech that expressed his "deep concern" for the misun
derstanding between the Undergraduate Senate as a
whole and a "frustrated VSO leader," namely Tommy
Tobin 'lO, who was denied additional funding last week
for travel expenses.
"There is a clear disconnect in communication
between the Senate and [Student Activities and
Leadership] and the Haas Center funding advisers,"
Jackson said. "[Tobin] had not one or two, but three dif
ferent versions of funding rules being thrown at him."
While Jackson agreed that the Appropriations
Committee was justified in only approving one-third of
Tobin's funding request for SPOON last week, he
demanded future transparency of funding policies.
According to Deputy Chair Kelsei Wharton 'l2, last
week's confusion about special fees funding for travel
costs was not the first, nor was it an isolated example of
miscommunication about funding guidelines. He
recounted an encounter he had with a student group
leader who was confused about Web sites listing differ
ent spending caps for event food.
