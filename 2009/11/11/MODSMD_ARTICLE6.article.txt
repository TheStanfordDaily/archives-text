## Senate debates fiscal policies Confusion over fiscal approval reveals need to clarify VSO funding 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
What first appeared to be an isolated incident of
funding policy confusion at Tuesday's Undergraduate
Senate meeting quickly snowballed into a much larger
conversation on increasing transparency for volunteer
student organizations (VSOs) and applications for
appropriations funding.
Communications Chair Lee Jackson 'l2 delivered a
speech that expressed his "deep concern" for the misun
derstanding between the Undergraduate Senate as a
whole and a "frustrated VSO leader," namely Tommy
Tobin 'lO, who was denied additional funding last week
for travel expenses.
"There is a clear disconnect in communication
between the Senate and [Student Activities and
Leadership] and the Haas Center funding advisers,"
Jackson said. "[Tobin] had not one or two, but three dif
ferent versions of funding rules being thrown at him."
While Jackson agreed that the Appropriations
Committee was justified in only approving one-third of
Tobin's funding request for SPOON last week, he
demanded future transparency of funding policies.
According to Deputy Chair Kelsei Wharton 'l2, last
week's confusion about special fees funding for travel
costs was not the first, nor was it an isolated example of
miscommunication about funding guidelines. He
recounted an encounter he had with a student group
leader who was confused about Web sites listing differ
ent spending caps for event food.
"When people come into appro
priations meetings, they end up leav
ing sometimes pretty upset,"
Wharton said.
"While sticking to our funding
policies, we should also meet them
halfway with an explanation or
rationale as to why this is going on,"
he added, suggesting an open forum
for senators to address student con
cerns and explain why certain fund
ing decisions are made based on
budgeting.
Appropriations Chair Anton
Zietsman 'l2 suggested that part of
the problem the committee is experi
encing can be traced back to a shaky
transition and a "lack of institutional
knowledge" passed on from previous
chairs to current Appropriations
Committee members.
Nanci Howe, director of Student
Activities and Leadership (SAL),
suggested both starting a training ses
sion for VSO leaders on appropria
tions guidelines and SAL Web site
navigation as well as creating a sur
vey for group leaders to pinpoint
"what is working and what is not
working" with the funding applica
tion process.
"I think there's a fair amount of
information available," Howe said.
She also addressed a need to arrive at
a "collective understanding" of poli
cies and needs to be clearly addressed
on the Web.
In line with the trend of student

groups approaching the Senate for
financial support during the
University's financial downturn,
Tom Kozlowski 'll approached the
Senate with a SSE Capital
Improvement Proposal. SSE's
request solicited joint funding from
the Senate, Graduate Student
Council (GSC) and its own body
$1,200 each, for new computers. The
collective $3,600 would replace nine
"outdated computers" currently
used by financial officers, bank asso
ciates and managers.
Although the proposal offered

three increments of funding $4OO,
$BOO and $1,200 the Senate moved

to vote on a drafted bill to fund the
full $1,200 portion at next week's
meeting.
The Senate also confirmed to their
positions by unanimous vote Senior
Class President Aria Florant 'lO, as
well as Executive Sustainability Co-
Chairs Leslie Cachola 'll and Sonali
Chopra 'll. Tommy Tobin 'lO and
Matthew "Mateo" Willmott 'll were
also confirmed as appointees to the
Constitutional Council, and Leonard
Parker 'lO was formally recognized as
Senate Webmaster.
