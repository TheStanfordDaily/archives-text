With students rushing to the gym and a frenzy of
last minute jogging, walking and weightlifting,
Stanford pulled ahead to beat Washington State and
take the Pac-10 Fitness Challenge Championship for
the third year in a row. The competition, which took
place between Oct. 26 and 30, pitted Pac-10 colleges
against one another to see which school had the most
active students and faculty.
