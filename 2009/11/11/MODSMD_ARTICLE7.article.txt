### ANNIE PROSSNITZ 
With students rushing to the gym and a frenzy of
last minute jogging, walking and weightlifting,
Stanford pulled ahead to beat Washington State and
take the Pac-10 Fitness Challenge Championship for
the third year in a row. The competition, which took
place between Oct. 26 and 30, pitted Pac-10 colleges
against one another to see which school had the most
active students and faculty.

Stanford won its third consecutive Pac-10 Fitness Challenge, a competition which pits conference schools against each other to see which has the most active students and faculty.
The contest, held for the past
three years, ranks schools based on
most minutes of workout time, most
participants, most improved minutes
and most improved number of par
ticipants. Schools were also ranked
based on "weighted minutes" which
accounted for faculty and staff par
ticipation along with student activity.
While Stanford was neck and
neck with Washington State during
the week of the challenge, Stanford
was able to clinch the most minutes
and most weighted minutes cate
gories on the last day, thereby clinch
ing the championship. According to
Recreation Programs Administrative
Associate Danielle Burks, the
Challenge Walk played a crucial role
in the win. Hosted on Friday, the
walk allowed everyone who partici
pated to log their minutes after com
pleting a 1.5-mile promenade around
the Stanford athletic buildings.
"I think the competition helped
out because we love to win every
thing," said Arrillaga staff member
Alyssa Reyes 'l2.
Some also attributed the victory
to the accessibility of Stanford's ath
letic facilities and the complimentary
use of the facilities for faculty mem
bers and their spouses.
"Our gym is open most of the
time, so that probably had something
to do with it," said Arrillaga staff
member Paola Kim 'O9. Gym mem
bership is free for all faculty mem
bers and dependents, which is not

true of all Pac-10 schools, including
Cal.

Additionally, the Recreation and
Wellness staff offered incentives for
students to participate, including free
water bottles, t-shirts, energy bars
and Livestrong Pac-10 Challenge
bracelets. Every student who logged
in minutes was also entered in a
sweepstakes to win a free iPod.
Another incentive this year was the
promise of an inter-dorm root beer
float party for the hall that logged
the most minutes.

"It was really energizing to see
the students pumped up like that,"
Burks said, in reference to students'
reactions to the Pac-10 Challenge
and root beer float competition.
Organization, as well as incentive,
played a crucial role in Stanford's
results. Club sports members ran
computers, placed at both the
entrance to the gym and workout
room for gym-goers to conveniently
log minutes before or after working
out.

Peer Health Educators also publi
cized the Pac-10 Fitness Challenge
within their respective dorms.
"[We] encouraged people in our
dorm to promote wellness,"

explained Peer Health Educator
Kate Frelinger. In addition to adver
tising the Challenge through a dorm
wide e-mail, Frelinger announced the
Challenge during the weekly house
meeting.

While organization and incentive
played a hand in Stanford's success,
many recognized physical energy as
something that set Stanford students
apart from their Pac-10 peers.

"I think the difference is that we
care, adding physical activity to your
daily routine is second nature,"
Burks said.

Others accounted for the physical
environment and sheer size of the
campus as factors that encourage a
healthy lifestyle.

"The whole environment of our
campus and being outdoors and the
great weather, I think it encourages
people to be outside and work out or
go to the gym to relieve stress," said
Melina Lopez 'l3.
"If you look around, everyone
bikes to class, that counts as physical
fitness," Frelinger said. "It's impossi
ble not to get exercise here."
