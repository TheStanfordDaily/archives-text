## Stanford gets shacked Surf Club celebrates one-year anniversary 
### SUSANNA KIM 
This quarter, the Stanford
Surf Club is celebrating its
one-year anniversary as
an official student club.
Co-presidents Lane
Hartman 'l2 and Chris Burniske 'l2
hope to share their love of the sport
with the Stanford community and
also practice environmental stew
ardship. In the winter, Surf Club will
aspire to realize this goal by partner
ing with Stanford Outdoors Gear
(SOG) to provide beginner surfing
lessons.
"We're working with them to cre
ate the curriculum, find lifeguards,
places to go out and people who
want to learn," Hartman said.
"We've had a lot of interest so far."
The lessons will take place at a
nearby beach. SOG will provide most
of the wetsuits and soft-top surf
boards and students will pay a fee
that is to be determined. Burniske is
not sure if the lessons will be stand
alone or part of a series, but that they
will begin with teaching technique
and surf etiquette on land first.
Hartman is eager to build the
community of surfers at Stanford.
"It's away for surfers to get
together," he said. "Barbecues, beach
cleanups, movie nights projected on
a wall, people to go to the beach with
whenever we want and to share
those moments with people as into it
as you. I've made some really good
friends from Surf Club."
Burniske hopes to add an envi
ronmental component to the surf
lessons, specifically by educating
people about the Great Pacific
Garbage Patch. The Garbage Patch
is said to be a collection of trash the
size of Texas in the Pacific Ocean.
"I want to talk a little bit about
conservation because it's an impor
tant part of surfing which is depend
ent upon natural events," Burniske
said. "I know every time I surf, a lot
of members will take some trash and
put it in our car. If we can at least do
that in a sense of gratitude for what
nature has given us when these new
surfers come, we can make sure we'll
have spots to surf in the future,"
Stanford surfers may not be
aware of the Surf Club's growing
presence on campus.
"I didn't even know there was a
surf club," said Robby Zeller, a grad
uate student in civil and environ
mental engineering. "But I would
join especially if they had that envi
ronmental aspect."

The Surf Club currently has
about 32 members on its e-mail list,
with a majority of them from the
fraternity Kappa Sigma and resi
dence Chi Theta Chi, where
Burniske is the Green Living
Counselor. Burniske is helping to
lead Surf Club's first beach cleanup
on November 14.
"We want to be stewards of the
ocean. Hopefully in the future we'll
work with Surfrider Foundation,"
Burniske said. "It's an environmen
tal organization focused on protect
ing our coastal ecosystem."
Surf Club's vision has evolved
since its founding. The idea for the
club emerged three years ago from
Dan Settel 'lO, Molly Ashkenas 'lO
and Brendan Appold 'lO. The three
founders met when they were fresh
men.
When Settel first came to the
Farm in 2006 from Cambridge,
Massachusetts, he assumed that stu
dents had regular access to the
California coastline,
"We arrived at Stanford and were
shocked there was no surf club,"
Settel said. "We were so excited to
get out and go to the beach, but we
had no way to get there because
freshmen can't have cars."
Settel met fellow surfers
Ashkenas and Appold during their
first year and learned that each had
hopes for the sport's growth at
Stanford. They applied to establish a
surf club for the Spring 2007 New
Student Group application deadline.
"We kind of worked together to
come up with a collective vision,"
Settel said. "The primary goal was to
bring together the Stanford surf
community to maybe pool gas
money to pay for trips and to organ
ize cars. The long term vision was to
rent a beach house for Stanford stu
dents, kind of how the ski team has a
house they rent out every year."
They were rejected their fresh
men year. The group applied again
during spring of 2008, but was reject
ed for liability reasons.
"The school was concerned that
we would be driving to and from the
beach in the middle of the night with
surfboards and that the boards
would be falling off of the cars,"
Settel said.
Yet when the situation seemed
bleak, the students were met with a
stroke of luck: Andy Fields. Fields is
the Coordinator of Outdoor
Education at Stanford and also helps
with Stanford Outdoor Gear
(SOG). He became the Surf Club's

informal advisor.
"The school knew that Andy
knew a lot of the risks," Settel said.
"He had worked with a similar
organization at the University of the
Pacific."
After Settel and the others
applied again during the fall of 2008
to establish Surf Club this time
with Fields' guidance they
received official approval.
"The Office of Student Activities
was very helpful and knew we had
spent a year thinking about the
issues," Settel said.
Now that Settel, Ashkenas and
Appold are seniors, they're eager to
see Burniske, Hartman and the
other undergraduates lead the
future of Surf Club. They also hope
that the campus community will
engage more actively in the sport.
"It's hard for people to get off of
campus," Ashkenas said, a Berkeley
native. "Freshmen not having cars is
one thing. And a lot of times, people
will get so stressed out about home
work, they don't want to spend a
chunk of the day away. Surfing is a
good four-hour chunk of free time
an hour each way for driving and
two hours of surfing."
Ashkenas, who first learned to
surf at age 12 and has competed in
six surf competitions, still manages
to surf two to three times each week.
She drives alone about half of the
time and enjoys going to her favorite
surf spot, Ocean Beach in San
Francisco.
"It's really big so if it's crowded,
it's spread out and you can always
find a break to yourself," Ashkenas
said, describing how a surfer catches,
or rides, a wave that "breaks" against
the ocean.
Hartman tried to dispel concerns
of cold temperatures during this
winter's upcoming surf lessons. He
explained that the Stanford Outdoor
Gear has "4/3 wetsuits," which
describes their thickness in millime
ters.
"It will be low 50s on average," he
explained. "We won't be going to the
cold spots. Plus, there's no cold
water, only bad wetsuits."

and Brendan Appold 'lO. The three
founders met when they were fresh
men.
When Settel first came to the
Farm in 2006 from Cambridge,
Massachusetts, he assumed that stu
dents had regular access to the
California coastline,
"We arrived at Stanford and were
shocked there was no surf club,"
Settel said. "We were so excited to
get out and go to the beach, but we
had no way to get there because
freshmen can't have cars."
Settel met fellow surfers
Ashkenas and Appold during their
first year and learned that each had
hopes for the sport's growth at
Stanford. They applied to establish a
surf club for the Spring 2007 New
Student Group application deadline.
"We kind of worked together to
come up with a collective vision,"
Settel said. "The primary goal was to
bring together the Stanford surf
community to maybe pool gas
money to pay for trips and to organ
ize cars. The long term vision was to
rent a beach house for Stanford stu
dents, kind of how the ski team has a
house they rent out every year."
They were rejected their fresh
men year. The group applied again
during spring of 2008, but was reject
ed for liability reasons.
"The school was concerned that
we would be driving to and from the
beach in the middle of the night with
surfboards and that the boards
would be falling off of the cars,"
Settel said.
Yet when the situation seemed
bleak, the students were met with a
stroke of luck: Andy Fields. Fields is
the Coordinator of Outdoor
Education at Stanford and also helps
with Stanford Outdoor Gear
(SOG). He became the Surf Club's

informal advisor.
"The school knew that Andy
knew a lot of the risks," Settel said.
"He had worked with a similar
organization at the University of the
Pacific."
After Settel and the others
applied again during the fall of 2008
to establish Surf Club this time
with Fields' guidance they
received official approval.
"The Office of Student Activities
was very helpful and knew we had
spent a year thinking about the
issues," Settel said.
Now that Settel, Ashkenas and
Appold are seniors, they're eager to
see Burniske, Hartman and the
other undergraduates lead the
future of Surf Club. They also hope
that the campus community will
engage more actively in the sport.
"It's hard for people to get off of
campus," Ashkenas said, a Berkeley
native. "Freshmen not having cars is
one thing. And a lot of times, people
will get so stressed out about home
work, they don't want to spend a
chunk of the day away. Surfing is a
good four-hour chunk of free time
an hour each way for driving and
two hours of surfing."
Ashkenas, who first learned to
surf at age 12 and has competed in
six surf competitions, still manages
to surf two to three times each week.
She drives alone about half of the
time and enjoys going to her favorite
surf spot, Ocean Beach in San
Francisco.
"It's really big so if it's crowded,
it's spread out and you can always
find a break to yourself," Ashkenas
said, describing how a surfer catches,
or rides, a wave that "breaks" against
the ocean.
Hartman tried to dispel concerns
of cold temperatures during this
winter's upcoming surf lessons. He
explained that the Stanford Outdoor
Gear has "4/3 wetsuits," which
describes their thickness in millime
ters.
"It will be low 50s on average," he
explained. "We won't be going to the
cold spots. Plus, there's no cold
water, only bad wetsuits."

Dan Settel '10 was one of Surf Club's
three founders and original members. The
idea for the club surfaced three years ago,
when the founders were freshmen. This
winter, Surf Club will partner with Stanford
Outdoors Gear to offer surfing lessons.
This quarter, the Stanford
Surf Club is celebrating its
one-year anniversary as
an official student club.
Co-presidents Lane
Hartman 'l2 and Chris Burniske 'l2
hope to share their love of the sport
with the Stanford community and
also practice environmental stew
ardship. In the winter, Surf Club will
aspire to realize this goal by partner
ing with Stanford Outdoors Gear
(SOG) to provide beginner surfing
lessons.
"We're working with them to cre
ate the curriculum, find lifeguards,
places to go out and people who
want to learn," Hartman said.
"We've had a lot of interest so far."
The lessons will take place at a
nearby beach. SOG will provide most
of the wetsuits and soft-top surf
boards and students will pay a fee
that is to be determined. Burniske is
not sure if the lessons will be stand
alone or part of a series, but that they
will begin with teaching technique
and surf etiquette on land first.
Hartman is eager to build the
community of surfers at Stanford.
"It's away for surfers to get
together," he said. "Barbecues, beach
cleanups, movie nights projected on
a wall, people to go to the beach with
whenever we want and to share
those moments with people as into it
as you. I've made some really good
friends from Surf Club."
Burniske hopes to add an envi
ronmental component to the surf
lessons, specifically by educating
people about the Great Pacific
Garbage Patch. The Garbage Patch
is said to be a collection of trash the
size of Texas in the Pacific Ocean.
"I want to talk a little bit about
conservation because it's an impor
tant part of surfing which is depend
ent upon natural events," Burniske
said. "I know every time I surf, a lot
of members will take some trash and
put it in our car. If we can at least do
that in a sense of gratitude for what
nature has given us when these new
surfers come, we can make sure we'll
have spots to surf in the future,"
Stanford surfers may not be
aware of the Surf Club's growing
presence on campus.
"I didn't even know there was a
surf club," said Robby Zeller, a grad
uate student in civil and environ
mental engineering. "But I would
join especially if they had that envi
ronmental aspect."

The Surf Club currently has
about 32 members on its e-mail list,
with a majority of them from the
fraternity Kappa Sigma and resi
dence Chi Theta Chi, where
Burniske is the Green Living
Counselor. Burniske is helping to
lead Surf Club's first beach cleanup
on November 14.
"We want to be stewards of the
ocean. Hopefully in the future we'll
work with Surfrider Foundation,"
Burniske said. "It's an environmen
tal organization focused on protect
ing our coastal ecosystem."
