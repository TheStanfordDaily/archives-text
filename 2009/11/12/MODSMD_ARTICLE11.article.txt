## Sapolsky discusses stress research 
### MILING YAN 
Robert Sapolsky is no stranger to stress, having
spent his career examining its effects on entities rang
ing from single neurons to colonies of baboons in the
Serengeti.
The biological sciences and neuroscience profes
sor shared some of his insights on stress and its con
sequences in an hour-long lecture as part of the
monthly Stanford Breakfast Briefings.
In his talk, Sapolsky explained how the stress
response is a biological mechanism intended to
address any threat to ideal equilibrium conditions, or
homeostasis. A stressor triggers the secretion of a
suite of hormones, notably adrenaline, resulting in a
whole cascade of physiological changes: increased
heart rate, rapid breathing and heightened senses, to
name a few.

In the wild, 99 percent of stress responses never
exceed three minutes, after which Sapolsky said, "either
it's over with or you're over with." In humans, the
response is often mounted in anticipation of an assault
on homeostasis rather than an actual perturbation.
"We're having these anticipatory psychological
stressors, [and] we turn on the exact same stress
response as every other beast out there, and we use it
for all the wrong reasons," said Sapolsky. "If you do it
chronically, you're going to get sick, because that's
not what the stress response evolved for."
In the Westernized lifestyle, many of the leading
causes of death such as heart disease or adult onset
diabetes are stress-associated diseases. The immuno
suppressive properties of prolonged stress are now
being examined in the burgeoning field of psy
choneuroimmunology.

As for the classic stress-related illness of peptic
ulcers, now shown to be caused by the bacteria
Helicobacter pylori, stress remains culpable. Only 10
percent of individuals harboring H. pylori have
ulcers, likely a result of the stress response suspend
ing early ulcer repair.

More surprising were the manifestations of chron
ic, traumatic stress on children, resulting in a rare
condition known as stress dwarfism. Although no
nutritional deficiencies are present, growth is tern

porarily stunted until the stressor is removed.
Sapolsky suggests that there is increasing evidence of
more widespread stress dwarfism, particularly among
children in areas of civil strife. The phenomenon may
have been mildly present among Japanese-American
children in World War II internment camps.
Sapolsky, who spoke Wednesday morning, has
garnered numerous accolades, including the Alfred P.
Sloan Fellowship and the Mac Arthur Fellowship,
also known as the "Genius Award." Recently, his
work was profiled for the National Geographic doc
umentary "Stress: Portrait of a Killer."
Sapolsky's own lab on campus has been studying
how chronic stress damages the neurons in the hip
pocampus, an area in the brain responsible for learn
ing and memory. Their results are frightening: the
damage appears akin to effects of chronic depression
and post-traumatic stress disorder.
So how does one effectively cope with stress, mit
igating any long-term damage? Experiments con
ducted as early as the 1930s by endocrinologist Hans
Selye attempted to address this question by continu
ally shocking rats in empty cages and examining sub
sequent ulcer formation.

Rats given hobbies (wood-gnawing), predictive
information (a blinking red light) or a sense of con
trol (disconnected lever), were ulcer free.
Additionally, in the presence of another friendly rat,
the shocked animal also developed no ulcers.
"Friends are good for your health big time,"
Sapolsky said. "Social isolation is a huge health risk
factor for every primate out there, including us."
The objective of Sapolsky's presentation, like oth
ers in the Stanford Breakfast Series, is to impart use
ful management and leadership skills. The audience
was comprised of upper-level executives and
Stanford affiliated professionals, and totaled approx
imately 230.
"I think it's not only useful for your job, it's useful
for living," said Lori Pirri, a SLAC employee, of
Sapolsky's presentation.
"I definitely plan on revisiting the taped presenta
tion," said Ron Boring MBA '78.
