## Lab invents mind reading system Machine reads electric signals, aids communication for paralyzed 
### IVY NGUYEN 
The Neural Prosthetic Systems
(NPS) Laboratory at Stanford has
developed a system that enables users
to type 15 words a minute using their
minds. Though this communication
prosthesis technology is still in its trial
stages, researchers behind the system
hope to one day use it to aid severely
paralyzed patients in communication.
Communication prosthesis works
by reading electrical signals in the
brain associated with movement,
interpreting those neural signals with
statistics and mathematical algo
rithms on custom-designed chips. The
computer signals then tap out a mes
sage on a keyboard.
This method bypasses injured
spinal cords and can one day enable
paralyzed patients to guide a comput
er cursor, move a prosthetic arm or
even stimulate the muscles them
selves.
"We take sensory information into
the brain, the brain does some pro
cessing, and then it is shipped onto
the motor output stages," said electri
cal engineering Prof. Krishna Shenoy
in a presentation available on
Stanford University's You Tube chan
nel. Shenoy leads the lab that con
ducts this research.
"If that last link is broken, we
might build effectively a bypass," he
continued.
The neural signals are read using a
4 mm x 4 mm silicon-based electrode
array surgically implanted into the
premotor or motor cortex areas of
the brain that control movement
that is comprised of 100 1-mm long
electrodes that penetrate only the
outermost layer of the brain, called
the cerebral cortex. Each electrode
allows the communication prosthesis
system to read the neural signal com
ing from the tip of the electrode, sim
ilar to what a neurosurgeon does
when he probes surrounding areas of
a brain tumor before removing it.
"Take those neural signals out,
and if you're looking at a keyboard,
we can predict in real time, very rap
idly— in fact, beat your own single
finger typing speed exactly the let
ters you would like to type and hit,"
Shenoy explained.
While the research in communica
tion prosthesis is promising, many
questions still need to be resolved
before it can improve the system.
One such question is how to interpret
the signals recorded in the brain.
Though some research teams argue
that the signals relate directly to mus
cle contractions, others believe that

these signals are more abstract
parameters that outline the direction
of the reach of the velocity of the
movement.
"Until that controversy is
resolved, we're fairly sure we're not
doing the best job we can in interpret
ing neurological signals," said
Research Associate Mark
Churchland.
Human Applications
Most of the trials with invasive
communication prostheses have been
performed on rhesus monkeys, with
only a small number of tests using
human subjects. In the studies per
formed on human subjects, patients
were able to perform tasks such as
move a cursor on a computer screen
to open an e-mail, play a computer
game and drive a wheelchair up to 20
feet.
"These things are real, and they do
work, but they're very experimental,"
Churchland said. "None of these
patients got any real benefits."
No patients were able to use their
prosthesis without the supervision of
a doctor and the research team, espe
cially because they needed to be con
nected via cable to a computer. Still,
the researchers of the NPS Lab
express hope that the technology can
one day aid severely disabled individ
uals.
"Other patients suffering from
Lou Gehrig's disease and so forth are
not even able to blink their eyes to
communicate," Shenoy explained.
"We aim to try to help provide new
treatment options for these most
severely disabled patients with it also
being in mind that we could help less
disabled people still severely dis
abled, perhaps with an arm amputa-

tion, but less so."
"It's great we're doing devices
from a basic science perspective, but
it would be really nice to translate
that into a clinical benefit for
patients," said fellow researcher and
computer science graduate student
Vikash Gilja.
Worth the Wait
If the system becomes more
robust, it may also benefit less severe
ly disabled individuals. Mechanical
engineering graduate student Angelo
Szychowski, who suffers from Spinal
Muscular Atrophy that leaves him
unable to type, said this system has
potential features that the voice
detection system he uses currently
lacks.
"The problem the voice detection
system I use is it has poor recogni
tion," Szychowski said. "My biggest
frustration has been with doing math.
Voice detection does not do that well,
so I have difficulties doing my p-sets
as a result."
Though Szychowski is not com
pletely paralyzed like the patients the
research team had in mind, he under
stands the importance of having the
ability to communicate.
"I know I would not be going to
Stanford right now if I weren't able to
interact with my computer and type
out my assignments and talk to peo
ple," Szychowski said. "It's a huge lim
itation to someone if they don't have
that ability. Even imperfect technolo
gy that only offers 15 words per
minute would still be a huge benefit
for someone who could not commu
nicate at all."
