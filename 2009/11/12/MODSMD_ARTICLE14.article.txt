# OPINIONS
## EDITORIAL Campus information needs to be centralized 
### 
Opportunities abound here at Stanford.
Students are inundated with e-mails re
garding everything ranging from
events and internship opportunities, to fellow
ship applications and classes being offered in
the coming quarter. Navigating the volume of
flyers that cover campus and the e-mails that
fill our inboxes in order to find what is mean
ingful is a challenge all are faced with. Unfor
tunately, the discussion of how information is
disseminated through the student population
is rarely entertained.
Finding ourselves situated in the heart of
the Silicon Valley, a deep understanding of the
power of access to information surrounds us.
Flowever, on campus we face not explicit bar
riers to access, but a disorganized array of in
formation channels that leaves many students
unaware of enriching and potentially life
changing resources.
The mission of Google the archetypal
Valley company is to organize the world's
information and make it universally accessible
and useful. Asking merely if all information re
garding campus resources is easily accessible
to students and the resounding "no" that
question must be answered with begins to
frame the state of affairs regarding informa
tion on campus.
Students search principally for academic,
extra-curricular and professional resources
and events on campus. Many events are adver
tised through peer e-mails and, to a lesser de
gree, paper flyers and word of mouth. We on
the Editorial Board believe it is quite unfortu
nate that student's knowledge of events, in
ternships and fellowships stems largely from
how much e-mail spam they expose them
selves to. Students new to campus are the most
observable examples of the inability many
have in finding their bearings in our environ
ment of disparate information. Too often,
searches for jobs, programming or support
begin and end with similarly unconnected
peers.
Pockets of information ranging from
my Groups and Resource 25, to the Web sites
of the Undergraduate Advising and Research

and Flaas Center begin to organize and
make available sought-after data. A calendar
of events open to the public and Coursework
are illustrations of University attempts to
share information. Substantially more power
ful endeavors include the ASSU Events Cal
endar and Courseßank.

Though the aforementioned sites, along
with overzealous e-mail campaigns and inten
tional Facebooking, can be powerful and ben
eficial, the Editorial Board challenges our
peers to conceive alternate models of sharing
knowledge. Changing outcomes through in
creased opportunity through models or
tools that would demand less student initiative
in order to more readily access relevant infor
mation should be the aspiration.
One potential model for a tool that could
enhance awareness of campus opportunities
would be a Bloomberg software-type model.
This business software aggregates countless
news source streams, along with real-time mar
ket tracking and company- and executive-spe
cific data. A Web site or tool built for campus
could gather and organize date from e-flyers
and published calendars, as well as content
from campus publications and departments.
Student group and resource center streams
could be made available, along with a search
able tool for fellowships and other scarcely
known niche grants. Though difficult to engage
and align, matching students who have re
ceived a grant or been a part of a program with
that specific grant's or program's information
would be greatly beneficial.
Though a difficult undertaking, the student
and administrative knowledge-sharing that
would occur, even in preliminary discussions
of such a venture, would go a long way toward
helping students understand all that is avail
able to us on campus. Many university and stu
dent resources strive to help students develop
themselves and build skills to be able to con
tribute to our campus and broader society.
Through more powerful and effective forms of
information distribution and communication,
we believe these goals can be met more consis
tently and significantly.
