# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Utopias and a Transformative Aetiology of Quantum Gravity 
### Emily Hulme 
April probably is the cruelest month, but
November is certainly the most tiring.
After all, it starts with a hangover from
Halloween and features a holiday meal de
signed to put you to sleep.
As the weather slowly cools and fallen
leaves litter paths, the once vibrant dream that
HIS 113: Contemporary Issues in the Political
Economy of Belarus might become some
thing more than an unwelcome chore collaps
es under the weight of inordinate expecta
tions. In September, Vollhardt and Schore's
Organic Chemistry: sth Ed. seems potentially
interesting, but once you've bought into its
premise that your value as a human being is
dependent on your ability to memorize its
contents, it is a cruel master. The bookstore
sells many good things, but happiness is not
found on its shelves, pre-packaged and only
requiring some at-home assembly.
Between following elections filled with ap
athetic candidates and preparing for my quad
rennial Winter Olympics Ice Luge-a-thon, I
feel a certain kinship with the weary souls
haunting the warehouse of human misery
known as Meyer Library. The mythological
Cumaean Sibyl, who asked for eternal life but
forgot to make it eternal youth, I think, is their
leader a voice without form, melting away
into the din of the centuries.

I humbly posit an elegant solution to this
ordeal. Remember when in high school you
told everyone you were so "over" it? And, be
tween figuring out who was going with whom
to prom and how to tactfully brag about get
ting into Stanford, you would dream about
college and how you would go to spoken
word performances and speak some rare and
beautiful tongue with your multicultural
group of friends and debate the ideas of
Rousseau with your well-versed and caring
professor? Well, after making dutiful obser
vations for a few years, I have a conclusion: no
one does this, chiefly because you still only
have 24 hours in a day. The obvious fix is to
add more hours to the day so you can accom
plish all these things, and even get enough
sleep for your liver to recover.
The first route to this promised land of 30-
hour days, thought I, was via that nifty theory
of relativity. Unfortunately, it requires speeds
at something like 99 percent of the speed of
light to change the passage of time percepti
bly, and since CERN keeps getting shut down
by some intrigue involving secret societies,
Renaissance paintings and bad acting, it might

be a lengthy wait before scientists can develop
the necessary equipment. I have been told,
though, that my plan is in the queue for con
sideration, and will be looked at as soon as
they have finished developing a weapon for a
truly casualty-free war: catfishes outfitted
with lasers to cripple the enemy's supply chain
(banks, generators, Starbucks, etc.) You heard
it first here.
In light of this, I crunched the numbers and
realized you can't really buy 24 hours and get
one free. However, you can take out an hour
on loan and pay a fee of less than three min
utes during each hour the rest of the day.Three
minutes! Check your Facebook less often and
quit waiting for your coffee to cool before you
drink it, and there's your three minutes. Or
don't make awkward eye contact with your ex
on the way to class. Or just cut the line at
Pluto's.
I can guarantee you won't miss these things
when you have, at the end of the day, a freshly
minted hour to spend doing whatever you
like. Take a nap. Read The New York Times
Style section and learn about a world in which
people who actually keep those collectors
cups that come filled with a liter of soda at
amusement parks don't exist. Finally install
that Berlitz program and, if you want to be re
ally cheeky, use it for the next two weeks dur
ing your bonus hour.
Life, indeed, is better with a spare hour to
spend how you fancy, even during the dread
ful ides of November. One can put things in
perspective. Once, I was angstily lamenting
how complicated my life was. The solution, my
illustrious friend said, was to "simplicate" it.
