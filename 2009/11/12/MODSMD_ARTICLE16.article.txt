## Healthcare: A Religious View 
### 
In the wake of President Obama's speech on
healthcare, the raucous town hall meetings
of August and the sausage-factory that is
the Senate Finance Committee, we hear al
most nothing about those who are suffering
without access to health insurance or are de
nied care even when they have insurance. The
current debate is about more than healthcare
reform; it is a debate over what kind of future
we want our country to have. As people of faith
and Christian ministers, we believe that this is
an issue of justice and morality, about which we
in the religious community, and all people of
good will, must not remain silent.

THE SYMPTOMS: In the weathiest coun
try in the history of the world, 46 million of our
citizens do not have access to health insurance.
And for nearly 45,000 e very year, that's a dead
ly reality. One of the 45,000 was Laura, a 49-
year-old nurse in Minneapolis. She had been
laid off and did not have access to health insur
ance when she began to have health problems
of her own: increased heart-rate and trouble
breathing. She feared the cost of a doctor or
hospital visit until, finally, her family prevailed
upon her to go to the hospital. She was relieved
when they informed her that her condition was
caused by a hyperthyroid condition and easily
treatable. But she had waited too long to seek
treatment. Tragically, she succumbed to a
blood infection within 18 hours of arriving at
the hospital.
In 2007 (the latest year for which statistics
are available), 62 percent of all bankruptcies
were caused by medical costs. Three-quarters
of those people were middle class and had
health insurance ! Our healthcare system is
pushing people into bankruptcy and poverty.
Many people cannot get health insurance
because they have a '"pre-existing condition,"
which means they will cost the insurance com
pany too much money. A pre-existing condi
tion can be almost anything the insurance
company deems, such as pregnancy or, in one
case, a 4-month-old baby that was not covered
because he was in the 98th percentile of weight
and size; in other words, too healthy.

Recission: when a healthcare insurance
company drops a patient because the patient is
costing them too much money. If a patient is
costing the company money, the company can
search the patient's medical history for an ex

cuse to drop coverage. It is alleged that Blue
Cross gave higher performance ratings to
workers who recinded the policies of patients
that were costing them too much.
Denial of coverage is a common prac
tice among insurance companies. One
study of health insurance companies in
California found that the percentage of de
nied claims for some companies has risen
to almost 40 percent! Some of these denials
push people into bankruptcy. They push
others into the grave.
In 2007, CIGNA denied the request of 17-
year-old Nataline Sarkisyan for a liver trans
plant. Her parents and friends spent weeks ap
pealing and eventually protesting the decision
at the company headquarters. An overwhelm
ing public outcry and support for Nataline
caused the company to reverse its decision and
approve her request. But the decision came
too late. Nataline died while waiting for her
(approved) operation.
THE PATHOGEN: Our healthcare sys
tem is sick, compromised by the profit motive.
Making a profit off of other people's illness or
misfortune is wrong and it should be abol
ished. As public for-profit companies, insur
ance company's profits are supposed to in
crease quarter over quarter, year over year.
This can only be achieved looking for ways to
simultaneously raise premiums and deny
claims. The result is that over the last several
years, premiums have outpaced inflation and
wages, with denied claims for some companies,
as noted earlier, rising to almost 40 percent.
These are people's lives we're talking about.
THE DRAIN: Why is there always enough
for warfare but never enough for healthcare?
Although spending for just the war in Iraq will
surpass the $1 trillion mark in the next fiscal
year, this doesn't account for the collateral
costs to our nation, estimated to be an addi
tional $2 trillion. Nor does this even begin to
account for the cost to Iraqis for their de
stroyed country and loss of life! The money
spent on war passes congress with little or no
debate on the efficacy of these policies or the
burden these fiscal decisions will place on fu
ture generations.

And yet, when it comes to possible expen
ditures on healthcare that can save the lives of
865 people who die every week, 3,750 every

month or 45,000 every year, suddenly our con
gress men and women are concerned about
the deficit!

Why do we allow enormous sums of money
to be used to decimate the land and lives of
millions, while we will not allocate what is
needed to provide for the health of our citi
zens? This should outrage all people of con
science, provoking confession and repentance.
The unabashed pursuit of such folly reveals a
great deal about the state of our civilization.

THE REMEDY: There are two humaniz
ing teachings that are part of almost every faith
tradition: "Love your neighbor as yourself"
and "Do unto others as you would have them
do unto you."
Neither of these teachings is simply quaint
folklore; they are the substance of what it
means to live in community, showing us how to
sustain our humanity even in the midst of
chaos. Without them, our communities, cities,
countries and world disintegrate into thuggery
and gang warfare where might makes right.
With them, we are given a vision of a global
community based in mutual love, respect and
responsibility.
Healthcare reform is not just a debate
about reform, but about what kind of future we
want for our our sisters and brothers, our chil
dren and grandchildren. Will it be a dystopic
future where fewer and fewer people of means
squabble and fight over fewer and fewer re
sources? The anti-reform protestors aren't just
protesting healthcare reform; they are protest
ing the vision of our common future, our sense
of community and care for one another, our in
terconnectedness. Fear and misinformation
feed the paranoia and xenophobia that lie just
beneath the surface of our society, which has
produced such violence as racism, sexism, clas
sism and even genocide.

This is not the first time that we who are on
the threshold of change have been challenged
to choose carefully. We read inTorah,"This day
I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you
that I have set before you life and death, bless
ings and curses. Now choose life, so that you
and your children may live," (Deuteronomy
30:19)
Make your voice heard by calling your con
gressional representatives. The choice is ours.
May we choose wisely.
