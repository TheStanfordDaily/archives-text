# FLECHAS Y PEDRADAS
## Suiza, Blackberries and Canadians, eh? 
### Patrick Kozey 
I finally did it. I have finally been to a coun
try that is neither the U.S. nor Spain. I rec
ognize that this probably doesn't sound
like much of an accomplishment, but I assure
you, dear reader, it is. If you ask my friends,
they'll definitely grant me a certain air of
worldliness (read: pretension). Until last Fri
day, sad to say, that was all just a front. But
now? Now I have been to Switzerland.
I went on this Swiss sojourn with my room
mate, a guy from our program, and a girl from
down the hall, with their goal being a jump
from a plane with parachute in tow (i.e. skydiv
ing), and mine being a change of scenery.
Though I did not gain a stamp in my passport, I
gained a bit more insight into what it is we
Americans seem to do while we study in for
eign countries.
First, a brief aside about the country I visit
ed: Switzerland is beautiful, cold and expensive
not unlike a fancy prostitute. Also like a
classy call girl, the country is multilingual.
The French in Geneva meant we tried to
order food from a man in a bar who, it turns out,
was not our waiter, but rather a fellow client
who enjoyed screwing with us. In Interlaken,
their very own kind of German provided us
with some choice signage, like the one reading
"Einfahrt" in large letters. Sadly we didn't visit
the Italian-inclined part of the country, so we
missed a chance to hit the ignorance trifecta by
striking out for the third time on the "commu
nicating with the locals" front.
Ladies of the evening also enjoy the finer
things, and the Swiss seem no different, what
with the übiquity of watches, knives and choco
late. They also host a great deal of shady bank
dealings and corresponding goofy paper
money that manages to make the Euro's carni
val color scheme look classy.
All that said, it was a beautiful place. The wa

terfront on Lake Geneva and the old city as the
light left it, the mountains of Interlaken and the
winding journey up to them between that city's
two lakes both were the sorts of vistas that
return some luster to the word "awesome." All
of it spectacular, and all of it missed.
My traveling companions (minus my room
mate, bless his non-smart-phone-corrupted
soul) probably didn't notice most of those
sights, because if they took a look up form the
screens of their Blackberries, it was only long
enough to snap a picture before turning back to
the world of BBMs and Facebook statuses.

When the weather didn't cooperate and the
skydiving got called off, they did spend some of
those obnoxiously colorful Swiss francs on
paragliding. It didn't seem to leave them very
content. Tlie girl on the trip was more con
cerned with what she'd tell her friends on Face
book now that her status ("Skydiving in Inter
laken, jealous?") was wrong? Tough call, I
know. Even though we repeatedly told her that
saying, "the weather was bad, we couldn't do
it," was a remarkably valid excuse, the "prob
lem" kept coming up. Blackberries are like
hand tumors malignant growths that, if not
cut out at the source, will suck up all the atten
tion the user has to give.
Later that night, we met some real live
Canadians in our hostel. The group, five or six
girls studying in Amsterdam, had come down
to see the country, and they invited us out to a
bar later that night. We went, and I learned that
Canadians say "eh?" instead of "right?" and
"pardon me?" instead of "what?" Really

they do. You could ask the Blackberry duo
about them, and the night in general, but I don't
know what kind of answer you'd get. The girl
spent the time we were out, surprise, surprise,
checking her phone.

Countries are not boxes to be checked off

on a list. That's what I learned this weekend. As
long as we treat them that way, as long as we
float through life, only looking around to docu
ment it for Facebook and our friends, we will
have lived nothing. So, put down the damned
Blackberry. Do that, and maybe you'll notice
well anything. I promise it'll be worth
your time.
