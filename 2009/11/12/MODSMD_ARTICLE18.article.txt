# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
Dear Daily Editor,

We here at the Gaieties writers' room
hear Professor Palumbo-Liu's palpable ex
citement in support of next year's possible
title, "Terrorize Cal," with its terribly clever
wordplay. However, we regret to inform the
professor that we must decline his sugges
tion. Sure, all of us would love to see shows
tearing into edgy subject matter and shed
ding light on the ills of society through the
humanity of humor. But there are certain
very clear lines that humor cannot cross.
These lines include aquatic natural disasters,
Patrick Swayze, the Native American com
munity, harm to kittens, puppies, turtles or
bunnies, and, per the professor's suggestion,
September 11th. So, while I'm sure Professor
Palumbo-Liu is dying to watch "Hurricane
Caltrina," understand it's probably not going
to happen. In the future, we ask that he please
try to be a bit more sensitive toward the com
munity of Politically Correct Complainers
With Too Much Time On Their Hands (PC
CWTMTOTH). See you at the show!

Unabashedly,
NICK DEWILDE 'lO
Gaieties Writer
