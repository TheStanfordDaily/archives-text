## A 						Literary Education for Sports 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
I went to my first ever book signing
last week. Before you jump to the
conclusion that I am a voracious
and cultured reader, please take
the author into account. Bill Simmons,
ESPN's famous funny-guy columnist,
was making his rounds on a nation
wide tour promoting his new, Bible
esque book on basketball. Also known
as "The Sports Guy," Simmons has es
sentially become the Hannah Mon
tana of the 18-45 year-old male demo
graphic.
Fellow editor Wyndam Makowsky
and I made the journey into San Fran
cisco without any idea of what to ex
pect. The signing was on a Thursday
night and the city seemed as alive as
Larry Johnson's career in Kansas City.
Although it is impossible to deny Sim
mons' popularity, we assumed that
Borders wouldn't be too crowded.
After all, there was no way there could
be that many other sports nerds who
would attend something as embarrass
ing as a book signing.
The event was scheduled to begin
at seven, but we decided to "beat the
crowd" and made it through the doors
at six. To be honest, I planned to walk
in to find Bill at a large conference
table, drinking coffee and exchanging
pleasantries with a group of college
kids (i.e. myself and Wyndam). How
ever, Borders provided me with one
hell of an unexpected sight.
Fve seen pictures of Spock
groupies at Star Trek conventions.
They have nothing on Bill Simmons
fans.
An hour before a book signing was
set to commence, there were hundreds
of guys sitting awkwardly close togeth
er on the floor of the King Street Bor
ders. It looked remarkably similar to a
preschool class during story time, ex
cept many of these preschoolers were
wearing ties.
A female usher quickly instructed
Wyndam and I to go purchase the
book before lining up to receive our
wristbands. Uh oh. There were literally
nine or ten different colors of wrist
bands, with each respective color signi
fying a place in the inevitably long line.
We repped turquoise and were thrilled
to see that we were in the third group
of 50 or so fans.
Staffers also debriefed the crowd
with instructions for how to interact
with Bill. They gave us a small sheet
with a few bullet points, including the

polite request to avoid asking Sim
mons to sign your body parts. A sports
writer who has rules for interaction?
Tight.

I'd be lying if I said that we both
hadn't somewhat planned what we
were going to do and/or say when we
saw Bill. I was busy deciding which
quip about the Magic beating the
Celtics Simmons is an obnoxiously
huge Boston sports fan I would
dish out. Wyndam, in his dire attempt
to be cute and stand out, decided to
wear his Yankees shirt. The Yankees
had just won sorry, purchased
the World Series. Wyndam stood out,
all right along with the 255 other
funny guys in A-Rod jerseys.
The wait in line wasn't terribly long.
We had time to discuss things that we
believed could get us escorted off by
security. One unanimous winner was
presenting Simmons with a tube of lip
stick and asking him to passionately
leave the print of his lips on the inner
cover of the book. Ok, yeah, the wait in

line was way too long.
When the turquoise brothers final
ly had their shot to hang out with their
idol, Wyndam and I were unbelievably
giddy. Bill told me the Magic would do
well in the first 10 games and gave
Wyndam a "Go Sox" in his signature.
For the shockingly high level of
celebrity status Simmons has attained
over his career, it was surprising just
how cool he actually was. Although we
spent a combined 15 seconds with the
guy, he shook our hands and appeared
to be genuinely appreciative of our
support. Here is a guy who writes hu
morous, free flowing sports columns in
return for what is most likely a seven
figure salary. He has garnered an enor
mous following of people who would
give up their first-born child to be in his
shoes.
All this got me wondering: does Bill
Simmons have the best job on the
planet?
In a short response: Yes. In my very
limited experience in thinking about
careers, Simmons' occupation is leaps
and bounds ahead of the rest. It is
every sports fan's dream to be able to
comically analyze not only the players
on the field, but the people, places and
events they encounter. I would, quite

frankly, do this for the mere amount of
money that it would take for me to sus
tain a healthy life.
But even more so, I can't imagine a
better feeling in the world than wit
nessing a diverse group of individuals
connecting, joyfully, over pieces of
writing that I created. What Simmons
and the rest of our favorite writers do
has an immeasurable positive impact.
Sports writers are far too often criti
cized for their lack of meaningful con
tribution to the world. It's a tough oc
cupation to defend on that level, but it
brings us right back to the age-old ar
guments regarding the benefits of
sports.
We watch, discuss and write about
sports because they make us happy
it's that simple. I honestly can't imag
ine how my life would be without
sports and quite frankly, I don't want
to. I for one am fully supportive of Bill
Simmons and all other columnists that
discuss sports with us for a living.
Even if that places me in the same
category as the Spock groupies.

stick and asking him to passionately
leave the print of his lips on the inner
cover of the book. Ok, yeah, the wait in

line was way too long.
When the turquoise brothers final
ly had their shot to hang out with their
idol, Wyndam and I were unbelievably
giddy. Bill told me the Magic would do
well in the first 10 games and gave
Wyndam a "Go Sox" in his signature.
For the shockingly high level of
celebrity status Simmons has attained
over his career, it was surprising just
how cool he actually was. Although we
spent a combined 15 seconds with the
guy, he shook our hands and appeared
to be genuinely appreciative of our
support. Here is a guy who writes hu
morous, free flowing sports columns in
return for what is most likely a seven
figure salary. He has garnered an enor
mous following of people who would
give up their first-born child to be in his
shoes.
All this got me wondering: does Bill
Simmons have the best job on the
planet?
In a short response: Yes. In my very
limited experience in thinking about
careers, Simmons' occupation is leaps
and bounds ahead of the rest. It is
every sports fan's dream to be able to
comically analyze not only the players
on the field, but the people, places and
events they encounter. I would, quite

frankly, do this for the mere amount of
money that it would take for me to sus
tain a healthy life.
But even more so, I can't imagine a
better feeling in the world than wit
nessing a diverse group of individuals
connecting, joyfully, over pieces of
writing that I created. What Simmons
and the rest of our favorite writers do
has an immeasurable positive impact.
Sports writers are far too often criti
cized for their lack of meaningful con
tribution to the world. It's a tough oc
cupation to defend on that level, but it
brings us right back to the age-old ar
guments regarding the benefits of
sports.
We watch, discuss and write about
sports because they make us happy
it's that simple. I honestly can't imag
ine how my life would be without
sports and quite frankly, I don't want
to. I for one am fully supportive of Bill
Simmons and all other columnists that
discuss sports with us for a living.
Even if that places me in the same
category as the Spock groupies.
