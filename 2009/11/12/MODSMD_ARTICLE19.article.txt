I went to my first ever book signing
last week. Before you jump to the
conclusion that I am a voracious
and cultured reader, please take
the author into account. Bill Simmons,
ESPN's famous funny-guy columnist,
was making his rounds on a nation
wide tour promoting his new, Bible
esque book on basketball. Also known
as "The Sports Guy," Simmons has es

graphic.
Fellow editor Wyndam Makowsky
and I made the journey into San Fran

of guys sitting awkwardly close togeth
er on the floor of the King Street Bor
ders. It looked remarkably similar to a
preschool class during story time, ex
cept many of these preschoolers were
wearing ties.
A female usher quickly instructed
Wyndam and I to go purchase the
book before lining up to receive our
wristbands. Uh oh. There were literally
nine or ten different colors of wrist
bands, with each respective color signi
fying a place in the inevitably long line.
We repped turquoise and were thrilled
to see that we were in the third group
of 50 or so fans.
Staffers also debriefed the crowd
with instructions for how to interact
with Bill. They gave us a small sheet
with a few bullet points, including the
