## Jay de la Torre resigns vice presidency Co-Chief of Staff Andy Parker to assume position 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Jay de la Torre 'lO has resigned from
his position as ASSU vice president,
effective Wednesday night.
De la Torre resigned at the ASSU's
joint legislative meeting of the
Undergraduate Senate and the
Graduate Student Council (GSC).
Speaking to The Daily after the meeting,
ASSU President David Gobaud 'OB,
M.S. 'lO praised de la Torre's work.
"Jay has made a significant contribu
tion to the executive team and will be
greatly missed," Gobaud said. "His work
has made Stanford better, and it's very
unfortunate that this has happened."
De la Torre declined to comment on
the resignation for the time being, both
at the meeting and in speaking with The
Daily, but said he will provide a state
ment to The Daily today.
Gobaud is seeking to appoint cur
rent Co-Chief of Staff Andy Parker
'll to vice president, pending legisla
tive confirmation, and asked both the
GSC and Senate to confirm him
quickly.
"Given his current position, he will
be able to assume the role of vice
president and quickly get up to
speed," Gobaud said.
Parker cited his own preparedness
for the position. "I think it's going to
be a challenge to replace Jay because
he's been a tremendous leader,"
Parker said, "but I think that, given
my work on the team [and] the fact
that I've been working closely with
Jay and David, I'll be able to easily
transition to the role.
"I'll bring my own leadership style
and personality to the job, but the
agenda will remain the same," he
added.
Gobaud aims to appoint Farah
Abuzeid 'lO as a replacement co-chief
of staff if Parker is approved, which
would also require legislative confir
mation.
"Farah is incredibly qualified and
has experience leading teams and

managing projects," Gobaud said. "I
have no doubt in her ability to quick
ly get up to speed."
Unlike Parker, Abuzeid currently
does not hold a position in student
government, a potential source of
contention in upcoming Senate and
GSC debate.

GSC Secretary Crystal Yin spoke
with regret about de la Torre 's depar
ture. "I feel like it's a big loss to the
leadership team," she said. "I have
seen him working very well with the
ASSU and the GSC. I feel sorry."
Second-year biochemistry gradu
ate student Krystel St. Julien also had
praise for de la Torre. "I could see on
the looks on everyone's faces he
was really important to a lot of people
in the room," St. Julien said. "It's sad
that he had to resign."
In his resignation letter, addressed
to the Senate and the GSC, de la
Torre offered "thanks for the honor
of working with all of you thus far."
He closed by stating, "Best of luck to
you all, and I hope you continue to do
well in your duties serving the
Stanford student body."
The Daily will have continued cov
erage of the resignation in tomor
row's issue.
