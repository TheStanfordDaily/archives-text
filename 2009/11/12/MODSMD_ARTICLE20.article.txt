# PERFECTION ON THE FARM
## The 						Cardinal hosts Cal for regular season's final game 
### TOM TAYLOR 
On Saturday, the Stanford men's soccer
team plays its final game of the regular season
at home against Cal. The Pac-10 title might
have already gone to UCLA, but this will still
be a very Big Game,
After an eight-year streak in the NCAAs,
Cal's hopes of making it to nine are now hang
ing by a thread.The Bears (8-8-1, Pac-10 2-6-1)
have had a tough time in the conference this
year, as the fortunes of the team that seemed in
great form in September have changed drasti
cally. In stark comparison, the Cardinal (10-4-
2, Pac-10 4-3-2) has converted its strong start
into a continually great run and could very well
secure second spot with a win this weekend.
Now ranked No. 17, the Card also looks like
a strong contender for the NCAA's, as the
team hopes to end a six-season absence in the
tournament. The last time Stanford made it
into the postseason tournament was in 2002,
when the team reached the final game before
dropping it to UCLA.The current squad holds
little memory of that success.
"I'm glad it all came together my last year,"
said senior Evan Morgan, the longest serving
member of the team, whose career here has
been delayed twice by injury.
Though Berkeley has dropped out of the
top 25 rankings, the Bears may still have a
chance. But to keep these hopes alive, the
Bears must defeat Stanford on Saturday.
"I think they have to go at it with the idea
that there 's still a chance," said head coach Bret
Simon. "It might be a slim chance, but I'm sure
they're looking at it like there's still a chance."
Though the Cardinal might feel like it has to
keep one eye on events next week, it also

knows it must take this season one game at a
time. Until the final teams are chosen and the
draw announced on Monday, nothing is cer
tain, and even those that feel confident of a
spot should be cautious of where they might
get seeded.
A total of 48 teams will be selected, and the
top 16 of those given byes into the second
round. Those in the first round will either get
drawn to host a game, or will be sent out on the
road.
"There is a very good chance we'll get in,
but we can't guarantee that," said Simon,"...
so there's still a lot to play for."
"We don't even know if we're playing on
Thursday, on Sunday or at all," he added.
A win on Saturday might be vital for both
sides. The game could seal the fate of the losing
team, adding even more spice to this contest, if
that's possible. Though the last five games be
tween these two teams might have been settled
by 1-0 score-lines, this belies both the attacking
and aggressive style of the two squads and the
intense rivalry felt by both fans and players
alike.

"Everybody comes out very passionate
and fired up, so it usually takes a while for the

Seniors will be honored before the last game in the regular season this Saturday, when No.
17 Stanford will strive for second place in the Pac-10 and try to increase its NCAA chances.

game to actually settle down," Mor
gan said. "It's gonna be hard fought."
"I wouldn't expect that one team
will run away with the game," Simon
said. "Both teams know each other
very well, so I guess it's not surprising
that the games are tight... I hope it
will be a skillful, fast-paced game that
will be enjoyable for the crowd, en
joyable for the players, because that's
typically how our games are."
Saturday will also be senior day,
marking perhaps the last home game
for four members of the team:
Michael Strickland, Evan Morgan,
T.J. Novak and John Moore.

"This group will be difficult to re
place, they've had a big influence on
the game by their talents, and more
than anything by their leadership,"
Simon said of the seniors. "They're a
very good group, very confident
group, very hard working group and
they set the tone for what we do, so
there'll be a big gap there to fill."
Before that happens, however
before the players go their separate
ways and the team starts the long
process of rebuilding in January
they still have some unfinished
business.

"We have the talent, and I think
its ultimately kind of up to us to live
up to our expectation of making it to
the finals," Morgan said, "but we
definitely have enough talent and
potential."
The road to that final game, the Col

lege Cup, in Cary, N.C., will be a tough
one. Maybe, just maybe, it will start
with a win at Cagan Stadium this Satur
day.
