# Undefeated women start NCAA tournament as first seed
## 
### SAM SVOBODA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend, the Stanford women's soccer
team completed a perfect regular season, the
first ever in program history. If the team can con
tinue its perfection for six more games, it will
record another milestone the school's first
ever national championship.
The Cardinal begins its postseason quest
tonight as it hosts Northern Arizona at Cagan
Stadium. The Lumberjacks finished in a tie for
third in the Big Sky conference, but won the Big
Sky tournament title to claim an automatic
berth in the NCAA tournament. NAU has only
played two common opponents with Stanford,
and they didn't fare particularly well against ei
ther, drawing against Pac-10 bottom feeder Ari
zona 2-2 and losing 4-0 to Arizona State.
Still, Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe
claims that these facts will have no effect on the
Card's mindset.

"It's all in the day," Ratcliffe said. "It's a later
part in the season now for them, as it is for us, so
we need to come to play and get after them."
If the Cardinal gets by NAU, its second
round match would be on Saturday afternoon
against the winner of BYU-UC-Santa Bar
bara. A match against UCSB would be a re
match from the first round of last year's
NCAA tournament, when the Gauchos hung
close with Stanford before losing 2-0, courtesy
of goals by Christen Press and Allison Falk.
However, BYU will be the favorites to go
through. The Cougars were ranked No. 20 in the
final regular season poll, and have a record of
17-3-2 on the year. The Mountain West regular
season champions also have a good record
against Pac-10 teams, beating both Oregon State
(2-1,2 OTs) and Arizona (1-0) on the year. Yet
as it proved by running the table in conference,
Stanford is no ordinary Pac-10 team.
It is difficult to speculate further into the
tournament, but the later rounds could throw up

some enticing matchups. In the Sweet Sixteen,
Stanford could possibly face conference rival
USC or local rival Santa Clara, the fourth seed in
the region. The two-seed in the region and
therefore a possible Elite 8 opponent for the
Card is Boston College, a team from the very
competitive ACC that went an impressive 15-3-
2.
Looking ahead toward the College Cup,
which will take place in College Station, Texas
this year, many predict that Stanford will be fac
ing either UCLA (another 1-seed) or Portland
(two-seed) in the national semi-finals. The other
side of the bracket features Florida State and
defending national champions North Carolina,
who round out the No. 1 seeds, along with last
year's runner-up, Notre Dame, a two-seed in
Florida State's region.
It was the Irish who knocked the Cardinal
out of last year's tournament, eking out a 1-0 vic
tory in the semifinals despite Stanford dominat
ing for large stretches of the match. This year,
however, the Card will enter as pre-tournament
favorites, having earned the number one overall
seed. Still, Ratcliffe sees no added pressure from
being the No. 1 seed and being undefeated, apart

from the pressure that already exists
in a playoff setting.
"Whenever you get to the play
offs, you feel a little more pressure,
because if you win, you go on, and if
you lose you go home," Ratcliffe
said. "Every team that plays has that
pressure. I don't think there's any
added pressure for us, I think we just
gotta play with confidence and get
after it and try to keep our season
going as long as we can."
If this year's Cardinal can with
stand the pressure, it certainly has
more than enough talent to win the
school's first national title. And not
only that, but as Ratlciffe always
stresses, the talent is all coming to
gether at the perfect time of the
season.
"I think the team is getting better
and better with each game ... I
think we're peaking at the right
time," he said. "Individual players
are getting better, especially the
freshmen, but all the players are get
ting better throughout the season.
Given what this Stanford team
has already accomplished, that's a
scary thought for the other 63 teams
still playing.
Tonight's match is scheduled to
kick off at 7 p.m., while Saturday's
match also at Cagan Stadium
will kick off at 1 p.m.
