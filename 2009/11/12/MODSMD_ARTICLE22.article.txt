# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Diving into tricky Trojan waters 
### CLAUDIA LOPEZ 
Bright, sunny skies and a riveting
water polo game are in store for this up
coming Saturday, when No. 1 USC men's
water polo hosts No. 3 Stanford on No
vember 14th at the McDonald's Swim
Stadium in Los Angeles.
Stanford had a fantastic weekend, re
turning to The Farm with two more wins
under its belt. On November 7th, the Car

dinal achieved an 11-6 victory against No.
8 Long Beach State. Stanford started the
game with terrific play on both sides of
the ball and ended the first period with a
3-2 lead.

Senior driver Draco Wigo had a total
of five scores, providing the Cardinal with
the upper hand. Senior goalkeeper Jim
mie Sandman had a total of seven impres
sive saves. However, the Cardinal did not
stop there: Sophomore driver Ryan Kent,

freshman driver Travis Noll, freshman
driver Paul Rudolph, junior driver Alex
Pullido, junior utility Jeffrey Schwimer
and sophomore utility Peter Sefton each
netted a shot of their own, contributing to
the outstanding Stanford win, 11-6.
On Sunday, Stanford continued its
winning streak, earning another victory
against No. 7 UC-lrvine. In the first three
periods, the Cardinal outscored the
Anteaters in a 12-5 victory.

During the match, senior 2-m Ryan
McCarthy smashed three scores into the
net; sophomore driver Jacob Smith added
an impressive three goals; Wigo and

Rudolph each skipped in two
scores; Noll and Pulido each snuck
in a single goal, helping Stanford
win its eighth game in a row, and giv
ing fans confidence that this week
end the Cardinal will win its ninth
straight game.
This Saturday, Stanford will go
head to head with No. 1 USC, who
comes off a close win over No. 4
UCLA. USC trailed 6-5 going into
the fourth quarter, but pulled ahead
and defended its nearly flawless
record. So far, USC is 20-1 overall
and has an MPSF record of 6-0, al
most mirroring Stanford's record
19-1,6-0 in MPSF.
Last year, the Trojans stole the
game from the Cardinal at the Avery
Aquatic Center, making USC the
NCAA champions with a 7-5 win.
This year, Stanford hopes to smear
the current Trojan winning streak
and earn revenge in one fell swoop.
"I would really like to beat
them," freshman driver Paul
Rudolph said. "I think we just need
to keep playing good defense."
If Stanford wins this match, they
will have a perfect MPSF record
thus far and be unstoppable.
"I think that will give us some
confidence going into the later part
of the season and it will confirm the
fact that we can beat any team in the
nation," said senior goalkeeper Jim
mie Sandman.
This year, the Cardinal's main

goal seems not to be redemption
from last year, but the loftier dream
of becoming the best in the nation.
"We want to be conference
champions," Sandman said. "We
want to win out the season and the
place where we start is winning
against USC this Saturday."
In order to win this weekend, the
Cardinal needs to make sure that
the recent wins don't make them
overly confident.
"We need to make sure we are
stepping things up and are ready for
a more intense battle," Sandman
said.
USC's J.W. Krumpholz earned a
silver medal at the 2008 Olympics in
Beijing. At 21 years old, he is the
youngest member of the team. Yet
this impressive resume does not
seem to have the Cardinal men's
water polo team too worried. If the
Cardinal can keep up the intense of
fense and impressive defense that it
has demonstrated throughout its
undefeated 6-0 MPSF sesason. Car
dinal fans can expect a win this
weekend.
No. 1 USC presents a very diffi
cult challenge for Stanford, but if
the Cardinal returns to the Bay with
another win, the team is sure it will
only continue adding to the long line
of victories.
"We have a good shot at national
title," Sandman said.
The men's water polo game will
be held at the McDonald's Swim
Stadium in Los Angeles at 11:00
a.m.
