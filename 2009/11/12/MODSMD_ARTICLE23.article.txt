5-1 NorPac) has been enjoying its most successful season
in school history breaking one record after another with
every win.
Now, as the Cardinal travels to Princeton for the first
round of the NCAA tournament, it is looking to set an
other precedent its first tournament win in program
history.
Although this is Stanford's ninth appearance, the Car
dinal has a 0-8 all-time record in the NCAA tournament.
Stanford received a spot in the bracket when it defeat
ed Boston University in a play-in game on Tuesday in a
thrilling 3-2 overtime victory.
In a complete effort from both the offense and de
fense, the Cardinal bested the Terriers in the seventh
minute of overtime when sophomore Stephanie Byrne
scored the game-winning goal.
Junior Xanthe Travlos and senior Rachel Mozenter
also recorded goals for the Cardinal.
Sophomore goalkeeper Alessandra Moss shined for

Stanford. Although the Cardinal was outshot in the first
half, Moss held the Terrier offense to only one goal in the
first thirty-five minutes. Her five saves on the match in
cluded two key stops during the overtime period.
This win marks the fifth straight overtime victory for
the Cardinal, a streak that dates back to 2008. The last
overtime victory came back in September, when the
then-unranked Cardinal upset No. 17 lowa in lowa City,
a win that propelled Stanford into the national rankings
for the rest of the season.
The Cardinal is now matched up against N0.4 Prince
ton in the first round. On the other side of the bracket

last time these two teams met was last year, when host
Princeton defeated Stanford 8-2 in an NCAA play-in
game.
The Tigers are ranked No. 4 in the tournament, match
ing their No. 4 ranking in the national poll and RPI. Re
ceiving an automatic bid into the tournament as champi
ons of the Ivy League, the Tigers are making their four
teenth appearance in the NCAA tournament.
But the Cardinal should not be intimidated by the
Tiger's resume, as Stanford is having its best season in
school history. The Cardinal has a program best 17 wins.

The team recently defended its third consecutive NorPac
title, and currently boasts the fourth best offense in the
nation.
This is the Cardinal's first appearance in the NCAA
tournament since 2007, in which Stanford suffered a loss
in the first round to North Carolina.
