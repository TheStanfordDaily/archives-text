# CROSS COUNTRY
## Running to Regional, beyond 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA JULIA BROWNELL 
The Stanford cross country teams are off to Eugene,
Ore. for the NCAA West Regional Championships on
Saturday.
For the women, this meet is an important step in qual
ifying for nationals. After placing fourth in the Pac-10
Championships, the Cardinal women will once more
face the teams that beat them at Pac-10's: Washington,
Oregon and Arizona State. However, this time, the
women hope to paint a different picture, having regained
some of their top runners.
"This weekend we have a great opportunity to com
pete with the best in the country and qualify for nation
als," said freshman Kathy Kroeger.
After very successful early season performances,
Kroeger had to sit out at the Pac-10's due to injury, along
with teammate senior Kate Niehaus. On an individual
level, Kroeger hopes to contribute greatly to the team at
NCAA West Regionals and help the team place in the
top three.
Unfortunately, the entire season has been riddled
with injuries for the women, preventing the team from
fully displaying their excellence on the course. For the
upcoming NCAA West Regionals, however, the whole
team is back in action and looking forward to the oppor
tunity to show the other teams their total capability.
"1 think we are going to 'shock the world,' as my coach
puts it," said junior Alex Gits. "We have some incredible
girls coming back for the meet, and some equally amaz
ing stars toeing the line yet again."
With the promise of returning runners, and those re
covered from injuries, the Cardinal looks to exercise
some vengeance on the other teams out on the course,
"Our team is looking forward to putting forth a
strong showing this Saturday," Niehaus said. "While we
have been a little less than lucky on the injury front, we
are not letting this compromise our goals for the season."
