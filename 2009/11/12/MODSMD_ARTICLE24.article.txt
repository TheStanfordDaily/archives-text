# CROSS COUNTRY
## Running to Regional, beyond 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA JULIA BROWNELL 
The Stanford cross country teams are off to Eugene,
Ore. for the NCAA West Regional Championships on
Saturday.
For the women, this meet is an important step in qual
ifying for nationals. After placing fourth in the Pac-10
Championships, the Cardinal women will once more
face the teams that beat them at Pac-10's: Washington,
Oregon and Arizona State. However, this time, the
women hope to paint a different picture, having regained
some of their top runners.
"This weekend we have a great opportunity to com
pete with the best in the country and qualify for nation
als," said freshman Kathy Kroeger.
After very successful early season performances,
Kroeger had to sit out at the Pac-10's due to injury, along
with teammate senior Kate Niehaus. On an individual
level, Kroeger hopes to contribute greatly to the team at
NCAA West Regionals and help the team place in the
top three.
Unfortunately, the entire season has been riddled
with injuries for the women, preventing the team from
fully displaying their excellence on the course. For the
upcoming NCAA West Regionals, however, the whole
team is back in action and looking forward to the oppor
tunity to show the other teams their total capability.
"1 think we are going to 'shock the world,' as my coach
puts it," said junior Alex Gits. "We have some incredible
girls coming back for the meet, and some equally amaz
ing stars toeing the line yet again."
With the promise of returning runners, and those re
covered from injuries, the Cardinal looks to exercise
some vengeance on the other teams out on the course,
"Our team is looking forward to putting forth a
strong showing this Saturday," Niehaus said. "While we
have been a little less than lucky on the injury front, we
are not letting this compromise our goals for the season."
The results of this weekend will
determine the teams that compete
at the NCAA National Champi
onships. "We're excited to run tough
this weekend and win a berth to na
tionals," asserted Niehaus.
According to the NCAA cross
country handbook, the first two fin
ishers in the meet automatically ad
vance. The NCAA then selects 13
more teams based on performance
throughout the season. Since they
normally consider the 3rd and 4th
place finishers at Regionals, it's
very important for the women's
team to have a better showing at
this meet than at Pac-10's to ensure
that they qualify.
For the No. 1 ranked men, how
ever, the stakes are not so high. Just
two weeks ago, the men won the
Pac-10 championships against many
of the other competitive teams who
will run against them again this Sat
urday. Encouraged by their previous
dominance, the team is treating the
meet more like a practice 10K be
fore the national meet on November
23rd in Terre Haute, Ind.
"[Regional's] is pretty much just
a really good opportunity to prepare
for nationals by running a 10K,"
head coach Jason Dunn said.
Since other Pac-10 competitors
will make up a large portion of the

field, there is no reason to believe
the men won't have an equally
strong performance this weekend.
It is essentially a foregone conclu
sion that the team will be heading to
the national meet, and they look to
be one of the top competitors for
the title.
The men's team has not been

struck by injuries yet this season,
and this good fortune that has
helped their standout performances
at pre-nationals and Pac-10's. How
ever, Coach Dunn hinted that one
runner may be sitting out from Re
gional due to injuries.
"One guy is a little banged up, we
may not run him this weekend and
wait for nationals," Dunn said.
However, the injury doesn't look
to be a problem for the team placing
and heading to Indiana with the
strength they've shown all season.
"I don't expect [us] to miss a
beat," Dunn said. "That's the nice
thing about depth. Any of these
eight or nine guys can score."
The men have their eyes on a big
ger prize than this weekend the
national title. Ranked number one
in the nation, they look to have a
strong chance to claim it. The Cardi
nal has not been shy about saying it's
been their goal all season.
"We're a very young team, and
we all came here to try to win a na
tional championship together. We
want to get that started now," soph
omore and lead runner Chris Der
rick said in an earlier interview this
year.
If they do indeed qualify at this
meet, both men's and women's
teams will head to Terra Haute, Ind.
for the NCAA national champi
onship meet on November 23rd.
