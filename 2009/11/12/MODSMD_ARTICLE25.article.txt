# HAPPILY JIM HARBAUGH
## 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
I'd like to take this opportunity to
profess my undying adoration for
Head Coach Jim Harbaugh.
As many of you remember, there
once, from 2005-2006, was a coach by
the name of Walt Harris. Coach Harris
was a rigid disciplinarian who, in the
words of the Associated Press,
"clashed with some players," and was
fired after two short seasons in which
the team went for a combined 6-17.

So and this is a gross understate
ment Stanford and I welcomed the
arrival of, well, any coach. Fortunately,
any coach turned out to be Jim Har
baugh: the then-head coach of the Uni
versity of San Diego, former Oakland
Raiders offensive assistant and quar
terbacks coach, and former Chicago
Bears, Indianapolis Colts, Baltimore
Ravens and San Diego Chargers quar
terback.
At Division I-A A USD from 2004-
2006, Harbaugh was 29-6 (.829), a
record that included two 11-1 seasons
and two Pioneer League conference ti
tles.

Nearly 20 years prior, Harbaugh
had embarked on what would become
an impressive NFL career. In 1987, the
Chicago Bears drafted him in the first
round. In 1990, Harbaugh was named
starting quarterback, and led the Bears
to their sixth NFC Central Champi
onship in seven years. In the following
season, Harbaugh's Bears came in sec
ond in the NFC Central, while Har
baugh himself passed for a career-high
3,121 yards and rushed for a career
high 338 yards.
In 1994, Harbaugh signed with the
Indianapolis Colts. With Harbaugh at
starting quarterback, the Colts im
proved from 4-12 to 8-8, placing them
second in the AFC East but beyond
the reach of a playoff game. The next

season, Harbaugh beat out Craig Er
ickson for the starting position, and it
paid off: The Colts ended the season
with a 9-7 record, landing them in the
playoffs for the first time in eight years.
After defeating the defending AFC
champions, the San Diego Chargers,
then the No. 1-seeded Kansas City
Chiefs, the Colts fell to the No. 2-seed
ed Pittsburgh Steelers. Harbaugh,
however, ended the season with a
100.7 passer rating, the NFL's highest.

Due to his contributions to the Indi
anapolis Colts' program, Harbaugh
was later inducted into their "Ring of
Honor."

"Jim Harbaugh was a scrapper and
never-say-die fighter who endeared
himself to this city and franchise," said
Colts owner Jim Irsay at USCD. "He
was a great ambassador of the horse
shoe, on and off the field."

So we were excited about Jim Har
baugh. He had the toughness, smarts
and competitive edge. And he won
football games.
The players felt it too. Last year,
then-senior co-captain Alex Fletcher,
who had played under former coaches
Buddy Teevens and Walt Harris, re
flected on his arrival.

"Coach Harbaugh came in, and the
first thing he gave us was hope," Harris
said.

Then-senior Thaddeus Chase had
similar sentiments. "The coaches came,
and they changed everything. You
push people in a different way, you give
them goals, you tell them, you show
them what they can accomplish, and
you'll change them for the better."
Beyond making players believe in
their potential, Harbaugh shows it to
them. He works hard, and works the
team hard. He is always looking for
ways to improve.

"We're not looking for pats on the
back or compliments," Harbaugh said
at a press conference following the

Arizona State University win. "Tell us
how we can improve, if you got an area
that we can improve in, or a solution.
Us seeing where we can improve and
attacking that is our only focus and
mentality."
He refused to call a bye week a bye
week. "It's an Improvement Week".

The enthusiasm lends itself well to
Saturday nights, when Harbaugh's
competitiveness comes out in full
force. He is a true competitor: He sees
opportunities, and takes risks. Some
times the play calls are questionable.
Against Arizona, Stanford was up 38-
36 with 5:30 left on the clock, and at
4th and 1 on its own 8, Harbaugh
opted for the pass to Chris Owusu in
the endzone not for Nate Whitaker
and the easy field goal, not for Toby
Gerhart and the first down. He want
ed the touchdown. Owusu dropped
the pass, Arizona got the ball on
downs, the momentum and ultimately,
the win.

But it was also this rogue confi
dence, this Brett Favre-esque risk-tak
ing, that secured the win over Oregon.
Stanford was up 48-42 with just 0:15 to
play, facing 4th and long just inside
Ducks territory. To turn the ball over
on downs would have been to give the
fast-firing Ducks a shot at a touch
down, extra point and one-point win.
Wake Forest again. Instead, Harbaugh
sent out the Whitaker, who, despite
missing a 44-yarder on the last posses
sion, shot a 48-yarder straight through
the outstretched yellow metal arms. A
52-41 win. A bowl berth.
I will forever be enamored with Jim
Harbaugh his energy, enthusiasm,
dedication, will, love of the game, I
hope this profession doesn't make
things weird between us at press con
ferences.

season, Harbaugh's Bears came in sec
ond in the NFC Central, while Har
baugh himself passed for a career-high
3,121 yards and rushed for a career
high 338 yards.
In 1994, Harbaugh signed with the
Indianapolis Colts. With Harbaugh at
starting quarterback, the Colts im
proved from 4-12 to 8-8, placing them
second in the AFC East but beyond
the reach of a playoff game. The next

season, Harbaugh beat out Craig Er
ickson for the starting position, and it
paid off: The Colts ended the season
with a 9-7 record, landing them in the
playoffs for the first time in eight years.
After defeating the defending AFC
champions, the San Diego Chargers,
then the No. 1-seeded Kansas City
Chiefs, the Colts fell to the No. 2-seed
ed Pittsburgh Steelers. Harbaugh,
however, ended the season with a
100.7 passer rating, the NFL's highest.

Due to his contributions to the Indi
anapolis Colts' program, Harbaugh
was later inducted into their "Ring of
Honor."

"Jim Harbaugh was a scrapper and
never-say-die fighter who endeared
himself to this city and franchise," said
Colts owner Jim Irsay at USCD. "He
was a great ambassador of the horse
shoe, on and off the field."

So we were excited about Jim Har
baugh. He had the toughness, smarts
and competitive edge. And he won
football games.
The players felt it too. Last year,
then-senior co-captain Alex Fletcher,
who had played under former coaches
Buddy Teevens and Walt Harris, re
flected on his arrival.

"Coach Harbaugh came in, and the
first thing he gave us was hope," Harris
said.

Then-senior Thaddeus Chase had
similar sentiments. "The coaches came,
and they changed everything. You
push people in a different way, you give
them goals, you tell them, you show
them what they can accomplish, and
you'll change them for the better."
Beyond making players believe in
their potential, Harbaugh shows it to
them. He works hard, and works the
team hard. He is always looking for
ways to improve.

"We're not looking for pats on the
back or compliments," Harbaugh said
at a press conference following the

Arizona State University win. "Tell us
how we can improve, if you got an area
that we can improve in, or a solution.
Us seeing where we can improve and
attacking that is our only focus and
mentality."
He refused to call a bye week a bye
week. "It's an Improvement Week".

The enthusiasm lends itself well to
Saturday nights, when Harbaugh's
competitiveness comes out in full
force. He is a true competitor: He sees
opportunities, and takes risks. Some
times the play calls are questionable.
Against Arizona, Stanford was up 38-
36 with 5:30 left on the clock, and at
4th and 1 on its own 8, Harbaugh
opted for the pass to Chris Owusu in
the endzone not for Nate Whitaker
and the easy field goal, not for Toby
Gerhart and the first down. He want
ed the touchdown. Owusu dropped
the pass, Arizona got the ball on
downs, the momentum and ultimately,
the win.

But it was also this rogue confi
dence, this Brett Favre-esque risk-tak
ing, that secured the win over Oregon.
Stanford was up 48-42 with just 0:15 to
play, facing 4th and long just inside
Ducks territory. To turn the ball over
on downs would have been to give the
fast-firing Ducks a shot at a touch
down, extra point and one-point win.
Wake Forest again. Instead, Harbaugh
sent out the Whitaker, who, despite
missing a 44-yarder on the last posses
sion, shot a 48-yarder straight through
the outstretched yellow metal arms. A
52-41 win. A bowl berth.
I will forever be enamored with Jim
Harbaugh his energy, enthusiasm,
dedication, will, love of the game, I
hope this profession doesn't make
things weird between us at press con
ferences.
