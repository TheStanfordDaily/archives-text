# Hennessy, Gobaud talk funds
## Gov't unites at joint legislative meeting 
### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At an ASSU joint legislative meeting last
night, the Undergraduate Senate and the
Graduate Student Council (GSC) came
together to hear from University President
John Hennessy and ASSU President David
Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO.
Hennessy and Gobaud spoke about a
number of campus issues and concerns, and
the GSC met after the joint session.
President Hennessy
Hennessy touched on a number of campus
topics in his address to the meeting, but began
by outlining cuts that were made to the
University's budget. He emphasized that he
remains firmly committed to not cutting
undergraduate financial aid, but noted that
additional funds will be necessary to support
financial aid.
"We have to look for gifts to rebuild
endowment losses and expendable gifts to
patch it up," Hennessy said.
Hennessy added later that there might be a
possibility of not being able to sustain the
financial aid plan in the event of another
financial downturn. But he remains optimistic,

and said scaling down undergraduate
financial aid is a "last resort."
After explaining his commitment
to undergraduate financial aid,
Hennessy moved to graduate and
international financial aid.
"We have no ambition to replace
federal funding for graduate financial
aid," the president said. "Our goal is to
boost the funding in particular areas
where it's hard to get federal funding,
like in interdisciplinary research. We
have to stabilize the University fund
ing in areas where we do not receive
aid."
When asked about international
financial aid, Hennessy said plans to
move to need-blind admission in five
years are likely no longer feasible.
"We had hoped to make more
progress on undergraduate financial
aid because of the financial crisis,"
Hennessy said. "I wish that were not
the case, but it's likely to be the case.
We are asking our international alums
for help on the international financial
aid."
When the issue of graduate finan
cial aid was raised, Hennessy said
undergraduate aid is much easier to
raise, for complicated reasons.
On a more optimistic note,
Hennessy explained that endowment
performance is not yet at its worst
period.
"The worst was in the 19705, when
the endowment over the 10-year peri
od lost money compared to inflation,"
Hennessy said. "Our 10-year period
return is probably still six points over
inflation. Hopefully, the economy
won't turn so that we have a long-term
downturn."

During a Q&A period, Hennessy
also weighed in on the potential of
graduating law and Ph.D. students to
find employment. Flennessy acknowl
edged that structural transitions in the
economy could eventually force
smaller class sizes in graduate schools,
but he said the meaning of a Stanford
degree will remain unchanged.
"Overproduction of Ph.D.s and
professionals are not from Stanford,
Berkeley, MIT or Yales of the world,"
Flennessy said.
Gobaud
After Hennessy made his remarks,
Gobaud outlined three projects that
he has planned for the year: a sustain
ability effort, a campaign to stop sexu
al assault and relationship abuse, and
student involvement in policy and
advocacy.
Gobaud said Stanford is likely to
play a key role in developing new
technologies for sustainability. He
added that the ASSU is working on a
spring Sustainability Symposium that
will be a student, administration and
faculty partnership.
"We're going to highlight the glob
al challenges and use Stanford as a
case study how we can address sus
tainability," Gobaud said. "We plan to
focus on academic teaching and
research, infrastructure and opera
tions, and community engagement."
On his campaign to stop sexual
assault and relationship abuse,
Gobaud said, "We do think it's a prob
lem on campus, but it's not just a
Stanford problem. It's not an easy
thing to talk about."
Because of this, Gobaud plans to
work on a massive education cam
paign around the issue. Gobaud said
he wants to spread the campaign
around the country to create an anti
sexual assault and relationship abuse
movement, similar to the anti-drunk

driving campaign of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving and other student
groups.
Gobaud closed his segment with
an emphasis on creating ties between
the student body, student government
and issues beyond the campus.
"We want to get the ASSU and stu
dents more involved in advocacy and
policy making at the local, state and
national levels," he said.
GSC Meeting
Immediately after the joint legisla
tive meeting, as non-GSC members
left the room, the GSC moved to deal
with additional funding requests.
The GSC approved $468 for the
Hindi Film Dance Team, for food and
snacks for their friends and family
event as well as upcoming workshops.
Fielding a request for the Materials
Science Research Society (MSRS),
GSC members were skeptical of the
amount of money requested, but
approvals from other members out
weighed the concerns.
One concern included an overesti
mation of the number of attendees to
events. Another was that materials
science, given its interdisciplinary
nature, may already be well-represent
ed by several departments.
Tlie GSC eventually approved
$3,600 for outreach and events for the
MSRS.
The meeting concluded with the
approval and confirmation of two con
stitutional council members and two
new sustainability co-chairs. Matthew
Willmott 'll and Tommy Tobin 'lO
were confirmed as additions to the
constitutional council, while Sonali
Chopra 'll and Leslie Cachola 'll
were confirmed as sustainability co
chairs.

During a Q&A period, Hennessy
also weighed in on the potential of
graduating law and Ph.D. students to
find employment. Flennessy acknowl
edged that structural transitions in the
economy could eventually force
smaller class sizes in graduate schools,
but he said the meaning of a Stanford
degree will remain unchanged.
"Overproduction of Ph.D.s and
professionals are not from Stanford,
Berkeley, MIT or Yales of the world,"
Flennessy said.
Gobaud
After Hennessy made his remarks,
Gobaud outlined three projects that
he has planned for the year: a sustain
ability effort, a campaign to stop sexu
al assault and relationship abuse, and
student involvement in policy and
advocacy.
Gobaud said Stanford is likely to
play a key role in developing new
technologies for sustainability. He
added that the ASSU is working on a
spring Sustainability Symposium that
will be a student, administration and
faculty partnership.
"We're going to highlight the glob
al challenges and use Stanford as a
case study how we can address sus
tainability," Gobaud said. "We plan to
focus on academic teaching and
research, infrastructure and opera
tions, and community engagement."
On his campaign to stop sexual
assault and relationship abuse,
Gobaud said, "We do think it's a prob
lem on campus, but it's not just a
Stanford problem. It's not an easy
thing to talk about."
Because of this, Gobaud plans to
work on a massive education cam
paign around the issue. Gobaud said
he wants to spread the campaign
around the country to create an anti
sexual assault and relationship abuse
movement, similar to the anti-drunk

driving campaign of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving and other student
groups.
Gobaud closed his segment with
an emphasis on creating ties between
the student body, student government
and issues beyond the campus.
"We want to get the ASSU and stu
dents more involved in advocacy and
policy making at the local, state and
national levels," he said.
GSC Meeting
Immediately after the joint legisla
tive meeting, as non-GSC members
left the room, the GSC moved to deal
with additional funding requests.
The GSC approved $468 for the
Hindi Film Dance Team, for food and
snacks for their friends and family
event as well as upcoming workshops.
Fielding a request for the Materials
Science Research Society (MSRS),
GSC members were skeptical of the
amount of money requested, but
approvals from other members out
weighed the concerns.
One concern included an overesti
mation of the number of attendees to
events. Another was that materials
science, given its interdisciplinary
nature, may already be well-represent
ed by several departments.
Tlie GSC eventually approved
$3,600 for outreach and events for the
MSRS.
The meeting concluded with the
approval and confirmation of two con
stitutional council members and two
new sustainability co-chairs. Matthew
Willmott 'll and Tommy Tobin 'lO
were confirmed as additions to the
constitutional council, while Sonali
Chopra 'll and Leslie Cachola 'll
were confirmed as sustainability co
chairs.
