## Fair Use attorneys withdraw from case 
### AIMEE MILES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Fair Use Project attorneys repre
senting Shepard Fairey, the artist who designed
the iconic "FIOPE" campaign portrait of
President Barack Obama, have been granted
permission to withdraw from Fairey's copy
right lawsuit against the Associated Press
(AP).
Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern
District of New York delivered his ruling
Tuesday morning, a day after the AP filed
papers asking him to deny the request.

Anthony Falzone, executive director of the
Stanford Fair Use Project and the head of
Fairey's former legal team, declined to com
ment directly on the case, but confirmed the
details of Flellerstein's ruling in favor of the
team's withdrawal as counsel.
The AP claimed that Fairey's former attor
neys had "unique knowledge" of Fairey's trans
gression, and further argued that "having new
counsel start fresh nine months into the case
after extensive discovery has already occurred
would cause additional prejudice and undue
delay to the AP."

Fairey has been embroiled in a legal battle

with the AP since February, when he filed a
declaratory judgment against the news agency
as a preemptive response to allegations of
copyright infringement. In March, the AP
responded with a countersuit, seeking damages
for Fairey's unlicensed use of a photograph
taken by Mannie Garcia.
Fairey's admission in mid-October that he
had lied in court about which image he used as
a design reference led to reports that his attor
neys had immediately withdrawn from the case
a claim that prompted them to release a


BECKY WRIGHT/The Stanford Daily
statement clarifying their position.
"We have not withdrawn as coun
sel for Shepard Fairey, and none of
his other lawyers have, either," the
statement read. "We have expressed
our intention to do so at the appro
priate time,"
The statement went on to stress
that the decision had nothing to do
with the "underlying merits" of the
case.
However, papers subsequently
filed by Fairey's former legal team on
Oct. 29 cited Fairey's deception as a
contributing factor in the decision to
request substitution of counsel.
"Mr. Fairey was apparently mis
taken about the photograph he used
when his original complaint for

declaratory relief was filed on
February 9, 2009," the motion read.
"After the original complaint was
filed, Mr. Fairey realized his mistake.
Instead of acknowledging that mis
take, Mr. Fairey attempted to delete
the electronic files he had used in
creating the illustration at issue. He
also created, and delivered to present
counsel for production, new docu
ments to make it appear as though
he had used the Clooney Photograph
as his reference."
The motion went on to recount
the events following Fairey's admis
sion of wrongdoing. According to the
papers, Fairey's former counsel
moved to amend the Plaintiffs
pleadings on Oct. 16 with respect to
Fairey's new position. On Oct. 20, the
AP moved to amend its own plead
ings and to add a new party to the
case, One Three Two, Inc. d/b/a Obey
Clothing an apparel company fea
turing Fairey's designs.

"Given the events set forth above,
present counsel have concluded that
it is no longer prudent or feasible for
present counsel to represent
Plaintiffs in this matter, because
these events present a potential for
conflicts of interest between counsel
and client," the motion read.
Calling the AP's grounds for
opposing withdrawal "unpersua
sive," the statement assured the court
that "present counsel will work dili
gently with substitute counsel to
assist in their transition into the
case."
Under Hellerstein's ruling, law
firm Jones Day and Harvard law
Profs. William W. Fisher 111 and John
Palfrey have effectively replaced
Durie Tangri, LLP and Stanford Law
School's Center for Internet and
Society as present counsel.
