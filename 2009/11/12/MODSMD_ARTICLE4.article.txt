## Fair Use attorneys withdraw from case

Stanford Fair Use Project attorneys repre

the iconic "FIOPE" campaign portrait of
President Barack Obama, have been granted
permission to withdraw from Fairey's copy

papers asking him to deny the request.

Anthony Falzone, executive director of the
Stanford Fair Use Project and the head of
Fairey's former legal team, declined to com

details of Flellerstein's ruling in favor of the
team's withdrawal as counsel.

neys had "unique knowledge" of Fairey's trans
gression, and further argued that "having new
counsel start fresh nine months into the case
after extensive discovery has already occurred
would cause additional prejudice and undue
delay to the AP."

Fairey has been embroiled in a legal battle

with the AP since February, when he filed a
declaratory judgment against the news agency
as a preemptive response to allegations of
copyright infringement. In March, the AP
responded with a countersuit, seeking damages
for Fairey's unlicensed use of a photograph
taken by Mannie Garcia.
Fairey's admission in mid-October that he
had lied in court about which image he used as
a design reference led to reports that his attor
neys had immediately withdrawn from the case
a claim that prompted them to release a
