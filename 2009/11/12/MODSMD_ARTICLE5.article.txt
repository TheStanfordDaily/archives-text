## Thomsen on school board Director of the Stanford IRiSS wins Sequoia District position 
### JANE LEPHAM STAFF WRITER 
Tuesday of last week, Chris Thomsen
'77, director of the Stanford Institute for
Research in the Social Sciences (IRiSS),
was elected to the school board of the
Sequoia Union High School District.
Since graduating in 1977, Thomsen
served as the business manager of the
Alumni Association, ran Stanford Sierra
Camp for 10 years and, in 1995, was given
the opportunity by now-Provost John
Etchemendy to run the President's
Commission on Technology, Teaching and
Learning, where he researched the rela
tionship between technology and the core
mission of the University. Thomsen briefly
left Stanford in 2000 to head a biotech
startup, before returning in 2004 to do a
study for the Humanities & Sciences
Dean's Office from which IRiSS
emerged.
A week after his election, Thomsen sat
down for an interview with The Daily. He
touched on a variety of issues currently
facing the nation's public school system,
his support for charter schools, his back
ground in education and the goals he
hopes to accomplish as a school board
member.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why did you
decide to run for the school board?

Chris Thomsen (CT): A lot of things.

Probably the most important, I think, is
that this is a time of great change and big
challenges, particularly in California, but
also nationally, for our public school sys
tem. Funding issues are really dire for the
school districts in our state. And yet, it
also seems like a time for great opportuni
ty. Every day, you read the paper about
different innovations, new schools pop
ping up, attention to pedagogical concern
and how schools should be organized. It's
a lead priority for the president [Obama],
which is really exciting. Just last week, for
example, he used the anniversary of his
election to focus on educational issues.
He's got a lot on his plate, but I think this
is awfully important. So, this is a time of
great opportunity because the needs are
great and things are changing quickly.
In addition, we're engaged in high
schools my wife and I have two boys of
high school age, so we see their experi
ences up close, and I think it's fundamen
tally important. My career has been spent
in education, so it's the most important
thing for me personally.
TSD: How will your work at Stanford
influence your role as a school board
member?
CT:lndirectly, in many ways. IRiSS focus
es on providing an empirical foundation,
data upon which policy can be developed
and promulgated. One of our centers, the
Center for the Study of Poverty and
Inequality, wants to re-think the poverty
index. Much like that, there's a huge trend
in public education toward collecting data
