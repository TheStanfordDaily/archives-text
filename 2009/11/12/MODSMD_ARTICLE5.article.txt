## Thomsen on school board Director of the Stanford IRiSS wins Sequoia District position 
### JANE LEPHAM STAFF WRITER 
Tuesday of last week, Chris Thomsen
'77, director of the Stanford Institute for
Research in the Social Sciences (IRiSS),
was elected to the school board of the
Sequoia Union High School District.
Since graduating in 1977, Thomsen
served as the business manager of the
Alumni Association, ran Stanford Sierra
Camp for 10 years and, in 1995, was given
the opportunity by now-Provost John
Etchemendy to run the President's
Commission on Technology, Teaching and
Learning, where he researched the rela
tionship between technology and the core
mission of the University. Thomsen briefly
left Stanford in 2000 to head a biotech
startup, before returning in 2004 to do a
study for the Humanities & Sciences
Dean's Office from which IRiSS
emerged.
A week after his election, Thomsen sat
down for an interview with The Daily. He
touched on a variety of issues currently
facing the nation's public school system,
his support for charter schools, his back
ground in education and the goals he
hopes to accomplish as a school board
member.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why did you
decide to run for the school board?

Chris Thomsen (CT): A lot of things.

Probably the most important, I think, is
that this is a time of great change and big
challenges, particularly in California, but
also nationally, for our public school sys
tem. Funding issues are really dire for the
school districts in our state. And yet, it
also seems like a time for great opportuni
ty. Every day, you read the paper about
different innovations, new schools pop
ping up, attention to pedagogical concern
and how schools should be organized. It's
a lead priority for the president [Obama],
which is really exciting. Just last week, for
example, he used the anniversary of his
election to focus on educational issues.
He's got a lot on his plate, but I think this
is awfully important. So, this is a time of
great opportunity because the needs are
great and things are changing quickly.
In addition, we're engaged in high
schools my wife and I have two boys of
high school age, so we see their experi
ences up close, and I think it's fundamen
tally important. My career has been spent
in education, so it's the most important
thing for me personally.
TSD: How will your work at Stanford
influence your role as a school board
member?
CT:lndirectly, in many ways. IRiSS focus
es on providing an empirical foundation,
data upon which policy can be developed
and promulgated. One of our centers, the
Center for the Study of Poverty and
Inequality, wants to re-think the poverty
index. Much like that, there's a huge trend
in public education toward collecting data

and making sure we make smart
decisions based upon that data. I'm
at the center of a center that focuses
on the use of data to support smart
policy decisions.

TSD: Why have you spoken in such
favor of Everest High School
becoming chartered? And what crit
icism do you have for the district's
opposition against this charter?
CT:Everest is basically a duplication
of the model for Summit Prep it's
patterned after Summit. One of our
boys has been in Summit Prep, and
I've seen extraordinary results from
Summit. When you apply for a char
ter, essentially you're describing
what the educational program is
going to be and how you're going to
build the school. The charter for
Everest is based upon Summit, and
Summit has been very successful.
The other thing we see is that
there's demand within the district
for more schools like Summit. The
pieces of that include the benefits
that small schools have, including
very attentive counseling. One of
the problems that I think our larger
schools struggle with is the fact that
there isn't a teacher or a counselor
who's closely connected to the kids

and can look after the students and
help them through, whereas the
Summit model does that. The
Summit model also uses differenti
ated instruction, so they're quite
attentive to the different learning
styles that the students have. It's
important to say that many of these
pieces are picked up and used in
parts of the district, but Summit has
brought them together in a really
exciting way that effectively serves
the students that are there. Summit
also has a 97 percent graduation
rate, which is measured by the num
ber of students that enter freshman
year, not just senior year.
What I found on the campaign
trail in talking to people, the most
common message I picked up was
that members of the district wanted
to get beyond the fight and move to
collaboration and a better relation
ship between the charter schools
and the district. I'm very sympathet
ic to that, even though I did speak
out for the Everest Charter and am
a strong supporter of the work being
done at Summit and Everest. I also
hope that, as a board member, I can
engender a good working relation
ship between the charter schools
and the district.
TSD: What are your budget priori
ties, and in terms of what you just
talked about, bringing together all
the information?
CTflhat's how to organize all the

information, and what I'd argue is
that it's hard to make the decisions
you're talking about, until you can
see the data in ways that are going
to help you with that. The other
challenge with the district budget at
this time is that most of it is in per
sonnel costs I think 84 or 85 per
cent of it is in salary and benefits.
Most of it is union-based, and so
negotiating union contracts [is] real
ly important.

TSD: Do you have any other goals
for your time as a board member?
CT:The key goals are boosting grad
uation rates, reducing drop-out rates
and preparing more students for
college. There is a debate about
preparing students for college:
Should it be the goal of every school
district to prepare all students for
college? And quite frankly, I think
that's what it should be.

TSD: Do you ever feel that in trying
to endorse this "every student goes
college" policy, that some students
fall through the cracks? For exam
ple, there might be more elite stu
dents, and because you're trying to
address a more general population,
some students might not get the
counseling that they need.
CT:lt's a great question, and to me,
it's the key question here. What I'd
argue is that if you don't set that as
a goal you want as many people
as possible to aspire for that then

you lose even more. But also in set
ting a goal, it puts pressure on us to
make sure we have the resources to
help everybody to reach their
potential. You want to make sure
that you're a gateway rather than a
gatekeeper. The role of the school
district is to open up the opportuni
ties and not to limit the opportuni
ties, and I'm concerned about the
limiting of opportunities.
We should be aspiring for college
education for everyone and commit
resources to do our best to get peo
ple there,
TSD: When will you be sworn in,
and when is your first meeting as a
board member?
CT:Dec. 16 for both.
For me, charters are agents of
change. I worked for the Obama
campaign, and I'm really excited
about that, to see his commitment to
education. The amount of money
Arne Duncan, the secretary of edu
cation, is putting into education is
larger than ever before, and yet
they're issuing some requirements
to get the funding. The funding is in
the tens of billions of dollars, but the
amount gets smaller once you get
down to the district level. The bigger
impact is the changes they are
requiring in conjunction with that,
which I'm really excited about.
