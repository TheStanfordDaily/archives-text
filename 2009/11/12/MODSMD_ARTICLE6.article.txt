## Students cope with Gunn High suicides Gunn graduates at Stanford reach out to each other for comfort 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI 
There is an old saying that it takes a village to
raise a child, but it is another feat to part with
one. The recent deaths of four Gunn high school
students who took their lives on the Caltrain
tracks have left a community in need of healing.
Suicide is currently the third leading cause of
death for young people ages 15 to 24, and the
cluster of deaths by suicide has left many con
fused and in search of an answer. For Gunn Fligh
School and the surrounding Palo Alto area, the
deaths, which all occurred between May and
October, represent much more that startling sta
tistics.
"The whole feeling of the school is complete
ly different when somebody has committed sui
cide," said Alix Farhat 'l3, a Gunn graduate. "It's
a completely different sensation. You walk onto
campus and you know something's different."
Several professionals from the community,
including a Gunn guidance counselor and a Palo
Alto Schools psychologist, declined to comment
for this article. The Daily spoke to four Stanford
freshmen who graduated from Gunn this spring
Farhat, Maya Talbott 'l3, Monica Alcazar 'l3
and Nate Levine 'l3 to learn more about how
they and their community are struggling to make
sense of the deaths.
"I think people are just in a state of shock,"
Levine explained. "It will be a while before it
sinks in. Then there will be questions."
In response to the incidents, Gunn ramped up
efforts to reach out to its students by making
counseling services more available. Teachers told
their classes that they were there for their stu
dents, and counseling actively sought to identify
students who might be particularly affected.
In some cases, students were given opportuni
ties for quiet reflection in the Green room, the
school's outdoor amphitheater. After the second
death, a Gunn parent came and played cello for
a group of students comforting each other in the
quad.
Talbott said Gunn has responded to the chal
lenge in a variety of methods.
"They were really trying hard to network with
the student body," Talbott said. "They've definite-
ly upped the advertisements for the
different counseling ... different
kinds of hotlines, through announce
ments, through the Web site. It's kind
of community-wide .. . showing
people resources that they can reach
out to, because they can't physically
reach out to every student."
Gunn created memorials after
the first two deaths, but decided
against commemorating the third
and fourth deaths in order to avoid
glorifying or romanticizing the act
of suicide.
Talbott felt conflicted about
Gunn's lack of acknowledgment of
the deaths. "I remember feeling
really frustrated at graduation when
we didn't even have a moment of
silence or anything," Talbott said. "I
mean, the second suicide was a week
before she was going to graduate.
It's so frustrating because I'm the
kind of person who wanted them to
be recognized. It was a struggle for
me to accept that that was the right
thing to do."
Many of the students made their
own gestures to recognize the senior
who took her life about a week
before graduation.
"She did costume design; she was
amazing," Alcazar said. "She always
carried around a safety pin or two. A
lot of us made a faux tassel of safety
pins. We wanted [her] to be there
somehow."
Farhat thinks the problem of sui
cide can be partially attributed to
society's lack of understanding that
mental illness is a prevalent and sig
nificant issue.

"I never really believed in the
whole depression thing," Farhat
said. "It was a hard thing for me to
believe in. I just found different
excuses for everything."
The Gunn tragedy has made the
community more aware that mental
health needs more attention.
"I think suicide has become
much more real to people now,"
Talbott said. "I think it's a stigma
that people are trying to eliminate,
that the school is trying to eliminate.
"Suicide is making people realize

that depression is not rare," Talbott
added.

Students say the deaths have
affected their everyday perspectives
and habits. "Whenever I approach a
train track, subconsciously I'll be
looking down, and all of the sudden
my body will get goose bumps or
something," Farhat said. "Something
will go weird and I'll look up and
recognize that I'm next to train
tracks. I know I don't drive on the
East Meadow Alma intersection
anymore."

The recent deaths have demon
strated how difficult it can be to rec
ognize when others desperately
need help.
"Maya [Talbott] and I really
struggled with the idea that we're
walking around campus, looking
around, and you don't know who is
thinking, 'I don't want to be here
tomorrow,"' Farhat said. "Now,
wherever I'm going, if I just see
someone, I'll give them a smile,
because it's true: a single smile can
brighten someone's day."
Levine expressed this concern
with specific reference to the second
death. "On the surface, there was no
sign that she was at risk," he said.
"That's troubling for a lot of rea
sons, if someone can be that inter
nally damaged and not show it at
all."

Although the community is with
out a definitive explanation for the
suicides, students believe some of
the pressure likely comes from aca
demic expectations.
"One of them occurred during
APs [advanced placement exams],"
Farhat said. "I don't know if they
just couldn't take it anymore.
Growing up here, it's a stressful
environment. You're right next to
Stanford. You're in Silicon Valley."
The recent Gunn grads attested
that healing is on its way in the Palo
Alto area, but that it will be a grad
ual and complex process.
"People seem to cope by remind
ing themselves of how much they
liked that person and of the good
qualities of that person," Levine
said. "You see a lot of memorials
where people bring objects that the
person made or gave to them, or a
photo of them. It's almost like by
doing this they're reminding them
selves that this person still exists in

some form, somewhere. I think
that's the first stage that people are
going through."
Many students have found writ
ing to be a beneficial therapeutic
outlet.

"Writing is definitely a big help,"
Alcazar said. "I wrote something at
one of the spoken word writing
workshops."

Alcazar added that she also
wrote to the first student, who was
her next-door neighbor, a week or
two after he took his life.

"I texted him a letter on my
phone," she said. "I've never written
a letter to a deceased person, but
writing the letter was very helpful to
me in dealing with it."
On campus, the Stanford fresh
men have been helping each other

cope with the deaths.
"A group of four of us just had
dinner here at Stern Hall," Talbott
said. "Instead of crying about it or
being depressed about it, we ended
up only talking about it after. It was
really just a time to be together and
reminisce and laugh and know how
much we had in our lives. For me, it
has been knowing the times to talk
about it, knowing the times to be sad
about it, and knowing when to move
on with your life."
Many current Gunn students
who were close to the victims have
felt the need to take time off from
school, according to Talbott.
"[School] has been a reminder for
them," she said. "It's a place where
there are too many faces to meet,
too many hugs to meet, too many

smiles to meet."
Talbott said high schools should
approach the topic of teen depres
sion in line with other diseases. "It's
a reality, like any other disease. I
think that's what schools really need
to get across that it's like any
other disease: a mental disease, or a
physical disease ... anything that
affects the brain at all," she said. "It
should be treated like that."
The Gunn alums are also
employing different positive strate
gies to help look out for their friends
and be more aware of the emotion
al well-being of others.
"I'm more careful with my
friends," Alcazar noted. "And when
I ask them how they're doing, I actu
ally listen. It's social convention,
asking someone how they're doing,

but not actually wanting to know. So
I've become more careful about
actually meaning what I say."
Farhat says she looks out for the
classmates in her dorm, and she can
often tell by someone's body lan
guage if he or she is having a rough
day.
"Depression should not be a
taboo subject," Farhat said. "I think
that it should be open to talk
about."
Alcazar said the events have also
led her to a new outlook. "I've start
ed believing in happy endings," she
said. "I believe that there's always a
happy ending. And if it's not happy,
then it's not yet the ending."

Students say the deaths have
affected their everyday perspectives
and habits. "Whenever I approach a
train track, subconsciously I'll be
looking down, and all of the sudden
my body will get goose bumps or
something," Farhat said. "Something
will go weird and I'll look up and
recognize that I'm next to train
tracks. I know I don't drive on the
East Meadow Alma intersection
anymore."

The recent deaths have demon
strated how difficult it can be to rec
ognize when others desperately
need help.
"Maya [Talbott] and I really
struggled with the idea that we're
walking around campus, looking
around, and you don't know who is
thinking, 'I don't want to be here
tomorrow,"' Farhat said. "Now,
wherever I'm going, if I just see
someone, I'll give them a smile,
because it's true: a single smile can
brighten someone's day."
Levine expressed this concern
with specific reference to the second
death. "On the surface, there was no
sign that she was at risk," he said.
"That's troubling for a lot of rea
sons, if someone can be that inter
nally damaged and not show it at
all."

Although the community is with
out a definitive explanation for the
suicides, students believe some of
the pressure likely comes from aca
demic expectations.
"One of them occurred during
APs [advanced placement exams],"
Farhat said. "I don't know if they
just couldn't take it anymore.
Growing up here, it's a stressful
environment. You're right next to
Stanford. You're in Silicon Valley."
The recent Gunn grads attested
that healing is on its way in the Palo
Alto area, but that it will be a grad
ual and complex process.
"People seem to cope by remind
ing themselves of how much they
liked that person and of the good
qualities of that person," Levine
said. "You see a lot of memorials
where people bring objects that the
person made or gave to them, or a
photo of them. It's almost like by
doing this they're reminding them
selves that this person still exists in

some form, somewhere. I think
that's the first stage that people are
going through."
Many students have found writ
ing to be a beneficial therapeutic
outlet.

"Writing is definitely a big help,"
Alcazar said. "I wrote something at
one of the spoken word writing
workshops."

Alcazar added that she also
wrote to the first student, who was
her next-door neighbor, a week or
two after he took his life.

"I texted him a letter on my
phone," she said. "I've never written
a letter to a deceased person, but
writing the letter was very helpful to
me in dealing with it."
On campus, the Stanford fresh
men have been helping each other

cope with the deaths.
"A group of four of us just had
dinner here at Stern Hall," Talbott
said. "Instead of crying about it or
being depressed about it, we ended
up only talking about it after. It was
really just a time to be together and
reminisce and laugh and know how
much we had in our lives. For me, it
has been knowing the times to talk
about it, knowing the times to be sad
about it, and knowing when to move
on with your life."
Many current Gunn students
who were close to the victims have
felt the need to take time off from
school, according to Talbott.
"[School] has been a reminder for
them," she said. "It's a place where
there are too many faces to meet,
too many hugs to meet, too many

smiles to meet."
Talbott said high schools should
approach the topic of teen depres
sion in line with other diseases. "It's
a reality, like any other disease. I
think that's what schools really need
to get across that it's like any
other disease: a mental disease, or a
physical disease ... anything that
affects the brain at all," she said. "It
should be treated like that."
The Gunn alums are also
employing different positive strate
gies to help look out for their friends
and be more aware of the emotion
al well-being of others.
"I'm more careful with my
friends," Alcazar noted. "And when
I ask them how they're doing, I actu
ally listen. It's social convention,
asking someone how they're doing,

but not actually wanting to know. So
I've become more careful about
actually meaning what I say."
Farhat says she looks out for the
classmates in her dorm, and she can
often tell by someone's body lan
guage if he or she is having a rough
day.
"Depression should not be a
taboo subject," Farhat said. "I think
that it should be open to talk
about."
Alcazar said the events have also
led her to a new outlook. "I've start
ed believing in happy endings," she
said. "I believe that there's always a
happy ending. And if it's not happy,
then it's not yet the ending."

There is an old saying that it takes a village to
raise a child, but it is another feat to part with
one. The recent deaths of four Gunn high school
students who took their lives on the Caltrain
tracks have left a community in need of healing.
Suicide is currently the third leading cause of
death for young people ages 15 to 24, and the
cluster of deaths by suicide has left many con
fused and in search of an answer. For Gunn Fligh
School and the surrounding Palo Alto area, the
deaths, which all occurred between May and
October, represent much more that startling sta
tistics.
"The whole feeling of the school is complete
ly different when somebody has committed sui
cide," said Alix Farhat 'l3, a Gunn graduate. "It's
a completely different sensation. You walk onto
campus and you know something's different."
Several professionals from the community,
including a Gunn guidance counselor and a Palo
Alto Schools psychologist, declined to comment
for this article. The Daily spoke to four Stanford
freshmen who graduated from Gunn this spring
Farhat, Maya Talbott 'l3, Monica Alcazar 'l3
and Nate Levine 'l3 to learn more about how
they and their community are struggling to make
sense of the deaths.
"I think people are just in a state of shock,"
Levine explained. "It will be a while before it
sinks in. Then there will be questions."
In response to the incidents, Gunn ramped up
efforts to reach out to its students by making
counseling services more available. Teachers told
their classes that they were there for their stu
dents, and counseling actively sought to identify
students who might be particularly affected.
In some cases, students were given opportuni
ties for quiet reflection in the Green room, the
school's outdoor amphitheater. After the second
death, a Gunn parent came and played cello for
a group of students comforting each other in the
quad.
Talbott said Gunn has responded to the chal
lenge in a variety of methods.
"They were really trying hard to network with
the student body," Talbott said. "They've definite-
ly upped the advertisements for the
different counseling ... different
kinds of hotlines, through announce
ments, through the Web site. It's kind
of community-wide .. . showing
people resources that they can reach
out to, because they can't physically
reach out to every student."
Gunn created memorials after
the first two deaths, but decided
against commemorating the third
and fourth deaths in order to avoid
glorifying or romanticizing the act
of suicide.
Talbott felt conflicted about
Gunn's lack of acknowledgment of
the deaths. "I remember feeling
really frustrated at graduation when
we didn't even have a moment of
silence or anything," Talbott said. "I
mean, the second suicide was a week
before she was going to graduate.
It's so frustrating because I'm the
kind of person who wanted them to
be recognized. It was a struggle for
me to accept that that was the right
thing to do."
Many of the students made their
own gestures to recognize the senior
who took her life about a week
before graduation.
"She did costume design; she was
amazing," Alcazar said. "She always
carried around a safety pin or two. A
lot of us made a faux tassel of safety
pins. We wanted [her] to be there
somehow."
Farhat thinks the problem of sui
cide can be partially attributed to
society's lack of understanding that
mental illness is a prevalent and sig
nificant issue.

"I never really believed in the
whole depression thing," Farhat
said. "It was a hard thing for me to
believe in. I just found different
excuses for everything."
The Gunn tragedy has made the
community more aware that mental
health needs more attention.
"I think suicide has become
much more real to people now,"
Talbott said. "I think it's a stigma
that people are trying to eliminate,
that the school is trying to eliminate.
"Suicide is making people realize

that depression is not rare," Talbott
added.

Students say the deaths have
affected their everyday perspectives
and habits. "Whenever I approach a
train track, subconsciously I'll be
looking down, and all of the sudden
my body will get goose bumps or
something," Farhat said. "Something
will go weird and I'll look up and
