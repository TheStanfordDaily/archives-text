## SPAM, A LOT 
### BRIANNA PANG 
Trash x one are the days when the computer's automat
es m 'ed chime of "You've got mail!" elicited excite
miets I ment. It seems that on Cardinal territory, one no
% V longer receives just the occasional piece of mean
ingful mail. Rather, Tiphanie Gammon 'l3
describes how each time she checks her e-mail a task she
completes every few hours a flurry of new messages has
appeared.
E-mail has taken on a major role in college life, and
Stanford's no exception. Students and professors now practi
cally live logged onto their e-mail accounts, using the technol
ogy in a variety of ways.
"I use e-mail for everything to schedule appointments,
to catch up with people, to advertise for groups and so on,"
said Woubzena Jifar 'lO.
However, it's not a surprise that e-mail has grown so pop
ular. E-mail allows people to communicate at all times of the
day, advertise more extensively and keep in touch with peo
ple all around the world.
"I do think it's very effective," said Per Enge, professor of
aeronautics and astronautics. "I can contact my colleagues
around the world. We can complete communication, even if
they're not available immediately."
Being a member of several mailing lists has become an
integral part of the Stanford experience. Through these lists,
students can connect to multiple communities who share
their interests, from fellow dorm residents to members of a
sorority.
"The mailing list I'm in that has a whole range of things is
the Diaspora," Jifar said. "There tends to be a lot of relevant
information. I enjoy being on it and being in the loop about
what's going on in the community."
At the same time, students can also receive seemingly
random or irrelevant e-mails through these lists, from politi
cal opinions to off-campus event invitations. And while mail
ing lists have the capacity to become a forum for long but
open conversation and debate, sometimes the "Reply All"
button can be abused.

"When it comes to drama, a mailing list can be just as bad or
worse than high school," Gammon said. "This weekend, there
was pretty much a flame war on the Diaspora mailing list."
The "flame war" that Gammon refers to was an extensive
list discussion that arose from comments about an article
sent to the list by one student. A whirlwind of responses and
opinions some angry followed.
E-mail use has grown so rampant that going a day with
out e-mail might require a bit of time to catch up on missed
information. And a week without e-mail? Unheard of.
"If I don't check e-mail for a whole day, it takes forever to
get through it all," Gammon said.
Since she receives so many e-mails, Gammon has become
accustomed to checking her inbox every morning. In a typical
morning upon waking, she receives anywhere from 5 to 30 e
mails.
Throughout the day, she continues to check her e-mail in
two to three hour intervals. Each time, she receives 10 to 20
new messages. By the end of the day, she has received at least
70 e-mails.
"And this is 0n1y... my Stanford account," Gammon
said. "A lot of people send the same thing out to the same
list, so I get the same e-mail like five times."
Enge said a Stanford professor receives around the same
amount. He explained his e-mail routine.
"I'll read my e-mails at breakfast I get about 15," he
says. "And then I'll read them midday. I get about another 15.
And then late in the afternoon, I get around another 15. In
total, I get more than 50 e-mails a day."
So has e-mail use on the Stanford campus evolved so
much that it's grossly overused? Are students and professors
simply receiving too many e-mails?
"I think that e-mails are grossly overused but necessary,"
Jifar said. "We have to use e-mail to contact professors, we
have to use e-mail to advertise. It's overused, but effective
and entirely necessary."
Jifar, Enge and Gammon all share one common charac
teristic all of them scan their e-mails for important
announcements. If they believe a message is irrelevant to
them, they delete it instantly.
"I usually read the first line," Jifar explained. "If the first

line isn't pertinent to me, then I usually I
don't check it." V
Thus, list spamming has become
thing of an art. On the Diaspora
list, for example, Justin Key 'O9 is known
send several e-mails per day to get people to
vote for him in a contest to become the new
Good Mood Blogger at www.sam-e.com.
In an e-mail to the Daily, Key explained
the method to his e-mail madness and the
various techniques that he uses to grab peo
ple's attention.
"If I sent the same e-mail with the same
title every day, I think that I would not get
so many people's attention," Key wrote. V
"You have to keep it fresh, engaging. And if
I were to bombard the lists with e-mails, peo
pie would get annoyed and just start ignoring
me altogether."
Key claims to use humor as his main tech
nique.
"I never like when people have deceiving
titles where the subject line is 'Obama to be
impeached!' and then inside, 'SIKE! But
come to our dance marathon!' or some
thing like that," Key wrote. "But I know
that the method is somewhat effective."
Key explained that his main technique
for grabbing readers' attention is to try to
make e-mail subject lines that are enter
taining and enticing to the receiver.
"I'm a fan of catchy titles," Key added.
"Also, having something different every time
makes people begin to look forward to what you
can come up with next."
Key's attempts in campaigning through e-mail have *
been effective, he said.
"I made the top 20," Key wrote. "I don't think I would
have if it weren't for e-mail."
