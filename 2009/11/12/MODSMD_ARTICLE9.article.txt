# SUIT UP OR DRESS DOWN?

### JACOB JOLIS 
rofessors, it has been said, are
I ■ the worst-dressed middle-class
occupational group in North
America." So starts Erik
Jensen's column, titled "A Call
for Professional Attire," published last year in
"Inside Fligher Ed," an online publication cover
ing college and university issues. In the article,
Jensen, professor of sociology at the University
of Idaho, goes on to propose a "Uniform
Uniform Code," a treaty meant to uphold guide
lines for proper academic attire across American
college campuses.
But do professors actually dress that badly?
And does it even matter?
Teaching fellows in the philosophy depart
ment come to class in jeans and a hoodie with
a big red "S" in the middle. Some younger
female teachers dress suggestively in knee
length skirts and tight T-shirts. Prof. Shafiq
Shamel in the comparative literature depart
ment, on the other hand, doesn't come to I
class unless he's in a full suit.
"[Dressing up] lends some level of seri
ousness to what I do," Shamel said. "This is
not a weekend. I am not on vacation."
Shamel can be seen strolling up and
down the corridors of Piggott Hall in one of \
three suits that he pairs with shirts of "darker
color or lighter color, gray or black or brown"
that go well with his suits.
But Shamel didn't always dress this way.
"I didn't have to really pay attention to
what I wore," he said, remembering his days
as a graduate student. "Ninety percent of the
time that I was a graduate student, I had my
Birkenstocks on. Most of the months we have
here are warm, so I had shorts and a T-shirt."
Even though Shamel did teach courses as a
graduate student, his mindset regarding his per
sonal dress code changed with the completion of
his doctorate degree.
"Only after I finished my Ph.D. did I realize I
wanted to make that transition," he said. Shamel
threw his Birkenstocks out and opted for cloth
ing that commanded more respect.
So was Shamel's switch from sandals to suits
his sacrifice for modern academia? Not exactly.

"I actually enjoy [dressing up]," he says.
Shamel is not alone in this feeling. Stanford's
Oral Communication Program, which offers
courses and workshops on speech communica
tion, has observed this particular positive effect
of formal attire. Riah Forbes 'lO, an Oral
Communication tutor, works with students to
improve their public speaking skills.
"I tend to recommend that they just dress a
little nicer than they would normally ... a little
bit nicer typically because it makes you more
confident," Forbes said. Clothing comes up as an
issue more often when students prepare for job
interviews, because when time is more limited,
Forbes says, "everything counts."
But a semester-long course isn't the same as a rofessors,

20-minute interview. It seems that the value of a
professor's personal dress code declines once
the first impression has been made. And that's
fine with many students.
"Formal attire makes a person a little less
approachable," said Angelica Acosta 'l3. "My
introsem professor wears really casual attire, but
he's really interesting."
Jose Valdez 'lO, however, doesn't think that a
laid-back style necessarily connotes approacha
bility. "I don't think it makes them more

approachable, nor does it affect how I interact
with them," he said.
"But I appreciate professors who dress
appropriately," Valdez added.
The academic attire of Dean Bravman and
President Hennessy, two good examples, says
Valdez, "shows how seriously they take their
positions." He acknowledged, though, that he is
probably in the minority in assigning value to
the way professors dress.
Prof. Tobias Wolff goes for an air of familiari
ty with his students, regularly taking swigs from
a flask with unknown contents in front of his
entire IHUM "Journeys" class, one student said.
But other professors like to maintain a more
traditional professor-student relationship.

"I have been told that I'm a minor
ity and that the way you dress will
affect students' perception of your
teaching ability," said a Hispanic lec
turer who wished to remain anony
mous. She said she doesn't have a vari
ety of nice clothes, but those she has,
she tries to match well to set a profes
sional wardrobe tone. She told the
story of an African-American teacher
who always used to wear a suit
because of students' perceptions.
"He felt that students would
respect him more [if he dressed for
mally] and see him through a differ
ent lens," she said.
Different departments also
assign different values to wardrobe
choices. Forbes talked about "depart
ment norms," which she believes sig
nificantly contribute to the varying
degree of formality in different pro
fessors' apparel.

"Econ professors are not 'dressed up' but
'nicely dressed,'" Forbes said. "Some of them
wear jeans but not a lot. PoliSci is more formal.
My PoliSci professors were always really well
dressed."
Faculty in the Math and Computer Science
departments, however, don't dress in suits. As if
this distinction was obvious, Forbes added: "You
know — they're dressing in jeans and T-shirts."
