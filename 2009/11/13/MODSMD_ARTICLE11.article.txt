## Palo Alto Bowl set to close Students rally to save alley before lease expires 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
A 10-minute drive from campus on
El Camino, Palo Alto Bowl has served
as the destination for student group
retreats, mixers and awkward "Screw
Your Roommate" dorm functions for
the past 55 years.
But the multicolored disco ball at
Palo Alto Bowl will stop spinning in
April, unless owner and Stanford alum
Rex Golobic '45 can find "some magic
place" to relocate the area's last
remaining bowling alley.
The building's lease is set to expire
next spring, at which point developers
have plans to replace Golobic's bowl
ing alley with a four-story hotel and 26
condominiums.
"I don't understand," Palo Alto
native Mohammed Abid 'l2 said.
"There are already a ton of hotels and
motels on El Camino, so I don't know
why they need that."
News of the business' closure first
spread in May 2007 when Barry
Swenson Builders purchased the 3.6-
acre parcel on which the building sits.
The standing lease guaranteed Palo
Alto Bowl's protection from redevel
opment plans, but now the lease, and
that security, is coming to an end.
"The only thing that we are sure of
right now is that our lease runs out
next April," Golobic said.
Golobic believes relocation is
unlikely.
"We don't know if we can find a
piece of property the size that we need
in the City of Palo Alto," he added.
Neighborhood supporters of the
bowling alley will make their final
appeals to the Palo Alto City Council
at a public hearing scheduled for the
evening of Nov. 18.
The group is led by Mountain View
resident Daniel Mart, who manages
the "Save the Palo Alto Bowl"
Facebook group. As of Wednesday
night, Mart's Facebook group num
bered 2,364 members and his petition
had 729 signatures.
Whether the petition or the public
hearing will have any effect on the
development plans is questioned even
by Mart.
"Public hearings on housing and
hotel developments are a joke, as the

developer already knows that they've
won," he wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily.

Nevertheless, Mart intends to show
support of the bowling alley in force.
"At the hearing, we are expecting
hundreds of supporters... everybody
from very young kids to high school
[and] college students to members of
Google's bowling league," he said.

Ariana Hoyt 'l2, who also grew up
in the area, noted the lack of recre
ational activities for teenagers in Palo
Alto.
"[Palo Alto Bowl] is one of those
things that was part of Palo Alto," she
said. "It was the one interesting thing
about Palo Alto and now we don't

even have that."
Abid, a member of the Facebook
group, was also disappointed at the
possible loss of what he called a "Palo
Alto landmark."
"Honestly, there is not much to do
in Palo Alto other than eat down
town, go to Da Hookah Spot and go
to Palo Alto Bowl," he said.
Golobic, who remembers a time
when Stanford had a 16-lane bowling
alley in the campus student center
basement, has seen many Stanford
students roll a frame over the years.
Daniel Bohm 'lO, former president of
the Stanford Bowling Club, said stu
dents still attend in force.
"Every time I've been there, there
are a lot of Stanford students there,"
Bohm said. "Especially on Thursday
nights because they have a good deal."
If the closure comes to pass, stu
dents will have to arrange their group
outings and dorm functions else
where.
Lily Saadat 'l2 organized Roble's
"Screw Your Roomate" event at Palo
Alto Bowl last spring and praised the
disco lights and "cool atmosphere."
"I don't go all that often I've
maybe been two to three times
but there's something about having a
bowling alley for the community," she
said.
