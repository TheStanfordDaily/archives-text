## Engineering library buys Kindles in digital effort 
### TYLER BROWN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's engineering library is scal
ing down its paper content as it prepares
to move into a 6,000-square foot space
on the second floor of "the Octagon,"
the centerpiece of the University's new
science and engineering quad, upon the
building's completion in June 2010.
Library officials say they are reor
ganizing its content and its services so it
can become more flexible and accessi
ble in the digital age. The initiative
includes the purchase of four of
Amazon.com, Inc.'s, Kindle 2 e-readers
for student use, the launch of xSearch,
an online journal search tool and the
development of a completely electronic
reference desk.
"We have to think about what the
libraries are going to be like in two years
and five years and 10 years," said Helen
Josephine, head librarian for the engi
neering library. "What are students
going to be using to do their research?"

Already, 99 percent of the engineer
ing library's journal content is online.
Josephine says electronic books have
been more cumbersome to acquire,
since the library is still puzzling out the
best file formats to use. According to
Josephine, the library is wrestling with
publishing companies that offer their
electronic content only through propri
etary software, in limited quantities or
not at all.
"It's still in an evolutionary stage,"
she added.
Josephine commented that one pub
lisher has allowed the library to buy all
of its content in electronic versions. The
deal allows the library to offer unlimited
downloads to students and professors
for personal use or for distribution on
Course Work. In addition, she said, print
copies are available to students for less
than $3O, as opposed to the $2OO-plus
cost of typical archival books.
New Kindles
Approximately 30 electronic books

will be on each of the engineering
library's four Kindle e-readers at a time,
and titles will change based on demand
from students and professors. The two
devices loaded with course reserve titles
have been available for nearly three
weeks now and can be checked out for
24 hour's at a time.
Engineering Librarian for Outreach
Instruction and Electronic Resources
Kathleen Gust expects the other two
Kindles, which are loaded with circulat
ing science titles, such as Malcolm
Gladwell's "Outliers" and Steven Levitt
and Stephen Dubner's
"SuperFreakonomics," will be obtain
able by early next week. The library will
offer them for 28-day checkout periods.
All four Kindles will also perma
nently include books on technical writ
ing and presentations, including Strunk
and White's "The Elements of Style,"
and a dictionary.
Gust said the Kindles will be helpful
to people with poor eyesight, as they can
enlarge text and read aloud. She added

that the devices' screens are also easily
photocopied, which makes it easy to
print a reference copy of a few pages of
a book without having to search for it in
the stacks. As a last benefit, the Kindles
weigh substantially less than 30 hard
cover books, and therefore offer a more
convenient way to carry around multi
ple titles.
Drawbacks that the library is still
sorting out include the Kindle's difficul
ty with accurately displaying charts and
graphs and its reliance on a proprietary
format, which restricts the titles that can
be loaded on the machine.
If funding is available, Gust hopes to
experiment with Sony Readers, which
are open-format, meaning they will read
more than one file type and theoretical
ly be open to more content than the
Kindle.
Gust predicted that the most signifi
cant difficulties with e-readers would
arise from managing the libraries' e
reader content in the future because
neither device is optimized for an insti

tutional setting.
"The big problem with the Kindle
and with the Sony Reader right now is
they're really designed to be either an
individual device or maybe a family
device," Gust said.
Josephine said the School of Law
and the Graduate School of Business
libraries are also experimenting with
Kindles as a medium to distribute con
tent.
xSearch
xSearch, the engineering library's
new journal search tool, was launched in
late September. It searches 28 online
databases and over 12,000 scientific
journals. In addition, it searches a grant
directory and some e-books.
Grace Baysinger, head librarian and
bibliographer of the Swain Library of
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering,
said, "It's a nice cross section of materi
als, slightly stronger in science and engi
neering. I anticipate [in the future]...
we'll expand out to more sources and
more subjects."
The xSearch Web site, at
xsearch.stanford.edu, contains a list of
all the available databases and includes
links to what Baysinger calls "compan
ion pages" that display check-box lists
of searchable subjects or courses.
Searches can be limited to specific
groups of sources, and search results
are ranked by relevancy and catego
rized in the left column by topic,
author, source publication, publisher
and date.
Baysinger said these features will
make interdisciplinary research in sci
ence and engineering especially effi
cient compared with older search tools.
She added that the library is ironing

out remaining glitches this week in the
interest of having a polished version
available by the end of November.
"We're still working some of the
kinks out of it," Josephine said.
Josephine and Baysinger expect to
officially unveil the finalized edition of
xSearch at the start of winter quarter.
Meanwhile, the engineering library is
soliciting feedback on the tool.
Electronic Reference Desk
The engineering library is also work
ing on an instant and text message
based service to make it easier for stu
dents to connect to its reference desk.
The library already has a reference
phone number and an e-mail service.
Josephine said a Stanford Libraries
iPhone application is also under devel
opment.
"Historically... we were getting ref
erence questions via e-mail, rather than
at the desk, so we're trying to extend
that and do away with our reference
desk altogether," Josephine said.

As the engineering library moves
from a large, mostly paper-based library
to one with a smaller physical footprint
and less shelf space, it is prioritizing
what needs to be available in paper
copies on the stacks or in storage versus
what can be online or on a Kindle, and
what new services it should offer given
its changing approach. The end goal is
to make material available on as many
electronic devices as possible.
"We're trying to understand the
library's services and figure out what
the library will do if it's not just a book
warehouse," Josephine said. "Does a
library equal books? Not necessarily."
