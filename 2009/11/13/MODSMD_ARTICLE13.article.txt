## EDITORIAL Faculty-student barriers 
### 
It is no secret that one of the advantages of
attending Stanford is that students have
access to world-renowned faculty. From
groundbreaking mathematicians to award
winning writers and critics, Stanford profes
sors are among the most influential in the
country, if not the world. Most students
would like to think the faculty and depart
ments are open and responsive to their con
cerns; it has often been said that, unlike some
elite universities on the East Coast, Stanford
faculty are approachable and take the time
to learn the names of their students. That is
the case, some of the time.
The reality of the situation across cam
pus is more complex, as massive lecture
courses of a hundred students or more make
it necessary to delegate many responsibili
ties to TAs, who act as intermediaries be
tween the professor or, in some cases,
professors and the students. Most stu
dents understand the necessity of a course
structured this way; not every class can be a
nice, small seminar with as few as fifteen
students. One of the current disadvantages
of the current system, however, is that it
tends to distance tenured faculty from the
students in away that seems to make it dif
ficult for faculty to understand the real con
cerns and questions students have about a
particular course.
The Editorial Board would like to see
more of an effort made on the part of de
partments and faculty to gauge the concerns
of students, whether through professors
making themselves more accessible or de
partments making more of an effort to sur
vey the moods of their students, or both.
Academic departments in general bene
fit from being able to correctly base deci
sions on what students think, want and
would prefer. Similarly, misunderstanding or
failing to gauge student opinion could result
in problems for a course or academic depart
ment. Hypothetically, if a mathematics
course is being taken by upward of a hun
dred students, and half of those students feel

that the lectures and sections are poorly in
tegrated, or that the lectures do not ade
quately cover the information necessary for
the midterm, what is the students' recourse?
Some will say this is why course evaluations
exist. But evaluations at the end of the quar
ter are of little help, or concern, for a student
who is considering whether or not to drop
the course altogether. In this case, student
retention is only possible if the professors
and TAs are willing to think on their feet and
make changes. First, however, they must be
attentive to the needs of students.
TAs are often the student's first resource
for questions and concerns in a class; more
often then not, they are also the student's
only real resource. TAs act as middle-people
between students and professors, and it
would seem, from the point of view of the
Editorial Board, that many TAs are skilled
in pacifying both groups. Many professors
must be commended for being available to
students directly through e-mail and office
hours. The reality, however, is that a stu
dent's main day-to-day interactions in a
given lecture course will be with his or her
TA. The TA, in turn, can attempt to learn
from the students as well and let the profes
sor know which aspects of the course are
working and which could use improvement.
Or the TA can simply try to make sure the
students keep soldiering on, addressing con
cerns as they come up while keeping the
professor in self-contented darkness.
The Editorial Board feels that, historical
ly, one of Stanford's most appealing aspects
has been that it carries the prestige and re
sources of an elite university without bring
ing along the academic rigidness and dis
tance of much older elite universities. Facul
ty and departments should keep this in mind,
and should make every effort to open de
partments and courses to input from stu
dents, whether that means through depart
mental town hall meetings, midterm course
evaluations or simply better communication
within large courses.
