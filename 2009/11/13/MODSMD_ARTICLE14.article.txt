# THE 						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## Why I Write ... 
### Shelley Gao 
This eighth piece marks the halfway point
of my tenure as a columnist for Vol. 236
of The Daily. In our applications to be
columnists, we were requested to submit per
sonal statements highlighting our motivations
and perspectives, sample opinion pieces and
an overriding theme.The theme is intended to
offer some structure and coherence to our
writing a narrative of sorts. Among the dis
tractions associated with the end of summer
research, returning from an overseas seminar,
jetlagged while settling into an internship and
studies in D.C. (first time living in an Ameri
can city is quite a shock!), I have neglected to
provide a framework for this column.
Well, better late than never! Continuing
the glorious tradition of the columns penned
by my predecessors and dear friends, "Stu's
Views" and "lives Lives!," "The GAO Re
port" seeks to promote student voice in Uni
versity decision making. The past seven weeks
consisted of pieces that present critical analy
sis of campus life and proposals for improve
ments â€” for example, international need
blind admissions and developing a program
that helps Stanford women to advance in pol
itics. Flowe ver, there is still so much more to be
said and done.
Now is the time to offer an input in the fu
ture direction of our University. A new dean
of residential education should herald a fresh
look at dorm life, hopefully investigating the
possibility of balancing individuality and au
tonomy in over-programmed freshman dorms
that can become rather collectivist and con
formist. The strategic planning in honor of the
Haas Center for Public Service's 25th anniver
sary in 2010 needs to incorporate an examina
tion of how government service can become
just as important in the discourse as the wor
shipped NGOs, among other issues.
At the Faculty Senate meeting on Oct. 22,
Vice Provost John Bravman announced a pro
posal to convene a commission to examine the
current state of undergraduate education. The
previous study of the kind was conducted 15
years ago with a report released by the Com
mission on Undergraduate Education. Some
recommendations have been achieved for
instance, strengthening foreign language im
mersion through overseas centers. Others, like
reforms to correct the "disturbing unevenness"
in faculty advising have yet to materialize.
The establishment of a new task force sug
gests that a process of consistent review and
renewal is essential to ensure that Stanford re
mains one of the leading institutions of higher
learning. However, the administrators cannot
do it alone. Students need to raise their voices.
Whether it is the overflowing classes, poorly
trained TAs or the labyrinth party-planning
restrictions, there are various aspects of Stan
ford that can and should be bettered.

Stanford provides various avenues for stu
dent input. There are over 40 University com
mittees appointed by the Nominations Com
mission covering wide array of issues, ranging
from Judicial Affairs to Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid. Yet, after reading evaluations by
student representatives who served on those
committees last year, it is questionable how
much impact they really have. Indeed, some
respondents sounded rather demoralized
after their experiences.
Another visible channel for representing
student interest is running for the ASSU.
Once elected, a whole new series of challenges
become manifest: learning how to be effective
in a culture of institutional inertia, vocal inter
est groups, bureaucratic barriers and an ab
sence of oversight resulting, in part, from a
constituency that struggles to take it seriously.
For those of you crying for the need to reform
campaigns that are decided by catchiness of
slogans, think about changing the mentality of
voters as well.
Stanford students demonstrate incredible
passion in all fields except the governance of
their University. General apathy is the norm
here. Few students in the laid-back paradise of
palm trees get worked up. When reaction is
stirred against University decisions, the ad
ministration's damage control mechanisms
involving PR tactics and vague promises seem
to do the trick. Why should they be worried?
Professors and administrators have the stay
ing power, decades compared to our four
years. Even we in student government tend to
grovel, engaging in empty rhetoric of "advo
cating" and "facilitating." What happened to
fighting for students' rights?
I love the Farm. Coming here is the pivotal
point in my life and, indeed, many of our lives.
Our love for Stanford means that we have to
take responsibility to ensure the continuous
improvements of this institution. Good stew
ardship involves leaving Stanford in a better
state than we found it.

Rather than succumbing to a sense of pow
erlessness, we need to remain optimistic and
hopeful. Each of us has the tremendous po
tential to have a positive role on the direction
of the University. Ideas matter just as much as
action. We need to look beyond the formal
mechanisms of influence. Whether it is writing
provocative columns that will stimulate dis
cussion or debating about things at Stanford
that irk you in dining halls, conversations are
powerful first steps toward action.

Just like the Government Accountability Office,
"The GAO Report" stands for accountability
and transparency. Although (approximately)
2,B4omiles away in the nations capitol, Shelley's
heart lies at the Farm. Contact Shelley at
