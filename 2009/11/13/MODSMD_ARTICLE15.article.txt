## "The Plight of Pure Genius" 
### R.G. Mann 
People often ask me how I got to be so
smart. That's why I carry a briefcase full
of photocopies of the second chapter of
Friedrich Nietzsche's Ecce Homo, "Why I
Am So Wise," his last moment of lucidity be
fore the spirochetes churned his brain to but
ter. I find it suitable to let Nietzsche do my
talking for me since I'm usually too busy phi
losophizing to answer people's questions. For
example, just yesterday at the cafe I was lec
turing a peasant on how best to raise his un
ruly children, whose horseplay was disturb
ing my moment of intense contemplation
(whether to have crumb cake or lemon
poppy seed loaf). The dim fellow asked me,
"What makes you so goddamn smart, ass
hole?" At which point I plucked Nietzsche
out of my satchel and said, "So glad you
asked, dear man. Here, read this!" He men
tioned something about joining him outside,
perhaps for an al fresco reading, but I had al
ready returned to my lofty meditations.
Of course, I've never read Nietzsche. I
wouldn't want to contaminate the originality
of my ideas. But I'm confident we're on the
same page, since Nietzsche, like me, was a mis
understood genius. Contrary to what most
people think, being a misunderstood genius is
not all free meals and hot oil rubdowns. Nor
mally, I would just hand you the Nietzsche
printout to explain my point, but I've run out
of copies and Kinko's has banned me from all
California locations for Xeroxing my anus
one too many times. So now I shall conde
scend to you, public, to share the plight of my
prodigious intelligence.
I was bred to be a genius. That's why my
parents named me P.G. Pure Genius. Well,
technically, I was christened as Ralph. But
after a year of witnessing my superior mind,
and from the stories they tell, my amazing tal
ent for eating nails, rubber bands and other
household detritus, Mom and Dad had it
legally changed. This new name was, for
them, an endless source of pride and enjoy
ment. "Hey, Pure Genius," they would shout,
"Come open Daddy's beer with your teeth."
Or, "Pure Genius, I bet you can't drink a
whole jug of anti-freeze," Given my preco
cious intellect, I instantly mastered such ac
tivities.

The trouble started when I came of
schooling age. Unlike my parents, who ac
cepted my talents as a natural emanation of
their own brilliance, the base and conformist
world tried to break me. An incompetent
doctor diagnosed me as a low-grade cretin.
Clearly, the man could not see past superfi
cial appearances, basing his diagnosis solely
on my goiter, my lucky propeller beanie and
my sardine-can shoes.
Back in those days, they tried to cure cre
tinism with corporal punishment. Here
again, my learning prowess was apparent, as I
quickly mastered how to take a lashing like a
veteran sailor. I absorbed blows with the
same zest I had for absorbing vocabulary
words. Some geniuses, the slower ones, read
widely; I read the thesaurus. It had all the

good words in it, as well as the high quality,
excellent, first-class, virtuous, noble, satisfac
tory and advantageous words. Pretty soon, I
had traded up my vulgar colloquialisms for a
mellifluous lexical arsenal, spoken in a
cheeky East Midland accent. Needless to say,
this led to only more beatings. At the age of
16,1 decided to leave the third grade and light
out on my own intrepid quest for knowledge.
After years of wandering, I arrived at Har
vard. I had followed a frail-looking old man
from the bus station onto campus, hoping to
overcome him with my intellect and steal his
wallet. But he was not as weak as he looked,
and after considerable tussle, I retracted my
claim to mental superiority and limped away.
Nursing my wounds, I had a revelation. This
man must be a genius, too. That was the only

possible way he could have out-wrestled me.
I realized this was where I belonged.
The Harvard admission director seemed
shocked when I made my customary offer of
sexual favors. 1 explained to him that this was
how 1 had risen through the ranks of the mer
chant marines, how I had traveled the world
and how I opened my first checking account.
"But anyone can open a checking ac
count," he said.
Flustered by this affront to my intelli
gence, 1 frantically displayed further evi
dence of my genius. I recited the thesaurus. I
drew a really cool, but scary clown. 1 even
strapped on my sardine cans and did a shuf
fle. Again, my genius went unrecognized.
So I came to Stanford. Here, I decided to
forego the whole admission process. Instead,
I have erected a perfectly habitable ivory
tower of my own made from driftwood and
coffee cups, right next to the Hoover Insti
tute. It's a one-man think tank called the P.G.
Institute, and it's open for business. Current
projects include publishing an "Idiot's Guide
to Understanding My Genius in Three Easy
Step" and trying to recruit Condi Rice to
come for a yearlong fellowship.
