## ANOTHER TITLE RUN Women start journey toward third-straight Final Four 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal women have their eyes fixed on this season's na
tional title, and their season-long trek begins this weekend.
Stanford women's basketball heads east to start its season with a
pair of games against nonconference foes Old Dominion and No. 25
Rutgers. After earning a
No. 2 ranking to start the
. . ui/Miriitr n ir urn* A i a

year only behind last
year's champion, Con
necticut, who eliminated
the Cardinal in the Final
Four Stanford will be
looking to meet and ex
ceed some very high ex
pectations.

If the Cardinal's show
ing in its brief stretch of
exhibition games is any indication of things to come, Stanford has
plenty of reason to be confident as the 2009-10 season begins. The
Cardinal trounced Vanguard University 107-49, then continued its
strong play a week later against UC-San Diego, which it defeated
107-55. In all, Stanford outscored the two teams more than two-to
one.

Leading the Cardinal in the preseason was Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike. After a head-turning freshman season, Ogwumike led the
Cardinal with 23.0 points per game in the team's two exhibition con
tests. Also impressive was junior Kayla Pedersen, who averaged bet
ter than a double-double at forward. Senior center Jayne Appel, an
early favorite for Player of the Year, played just over 30 minutes be
tween the two games, but averaged 10 points per game.
The Cardinal's opening night is set for Friday in Norfolk, Va.,
where it will face off against the Lady Monarchs of Old Dominion.
In an exhibition stint that rivaled the Cardinal's, the Lady Monarchs
soared past Chowan last Friday by a score of 85-52, then soundly de
feated Shaw on Tuesday, 82-48. In the game against Shaw, senior and
Virginia native Jessica Canady put up 15 points and five rebounds.
Not surprisingly, it isn't often that Stanford and Old Dominion
have found themselves on the same court. In their five meetings to
date, the Lady Monarchs have managed to take three games, but
lost their most recent meeting with Stanford as the Cardinal edged
them out 69-61 in November 2007. Long-time fans of the Cardinal
may also recall a memorable confrontation of the two schools 10
years prior to that, in the 1997 Final Four. The Lady Monarchs
forced that game into overtime, then eked out an 83-82 victory.
After getting the season started at Old Dominion, the Cardinal
will head north to do battle with No. 25 Rutgers.The Scarlet Knights
are beginning a season with a top-25 national ranking for the sev
enth consecutive time, and with good reason last season, Rutgers
started off with a bang and won 10 of its first 12 contests.
One of their only two the losses in that stretch, however, came
against Stanford. The Scarlet Knights' last trip to Maples Pavilion
left them with a humbling 81-47 loss. Appel put up some great num
bers in that contest, 19 points and 14 rebounds, while Pedersen
added 17 of her own. The game also played a key role in the ascent
of then-rookie Nnemkadi Ogwumike to a cornerstone of the cur
rent Cardinal squad she posted 10 points, four assists, six re
bounds and a steal in just 30 minutes.

This weekend also marks the much-anticipated return of point
guard JJ Hones, who missed nearly all of last season with an ACL in
jury that required surgery. In the Cardinal's two exhibition games,
Hones looked to be in fine form as she nailed four of five three
pointers and dished out four assists.

The Cardinal's 2009 season will officially be underway this Fri
day at Old Dominion at 4 p.m. PST. The game with Rutgers will be
played on Sunday 11 a.m. PST in Piscataway, N.J.
