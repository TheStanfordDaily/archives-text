# Staying in the title race
## 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The second time through the Pac-10 round robin
has drastically changed from the first and for the first
time in years, the top-seeded team has more than two
losses on the season.
What does this mean for Stanford volleyball? The
Cardinal is still in the race.
"We hope to come out of this weekend with two
solid victories under our belt and growing confidence
as we move toward the end of conference play," said
senior middle blocker Janet Okogbaa.
While Washington is still at the top of the confer
ence at 10-3 in Pac-10 play with UCLA right behind at
9-3, the two have yet to face each other in the second
half of conference play. This weekend could shake
things up in the Pac-10, depending on who takes home
two wins. Stanford sits in third place at 9-4 with neither
of these teams left on the schedule.
Although Stanford (16-7,9-4 Pac-10) lost last week
end to Washington and the weekend before to UCLA,
the schedule only gets easier for the rest of the season.
At Washington, junior Cassidy Lichtman hit 14
kills, nine assists and six digs. Junior Gabi Ailes contin
ued to climb her way to the top of Stanford's career list
with 29 digs in the loss. In the win over Washington
State, junior Alix Klineman stepped it up, registering
18 kills and nine digs.
Even with a loss last weekend, the team looks to
this weekend with a new attitude.
"I feel really good about [this weekend]," said
Head Coach John Dunning. "We've had a good week
at practice and we know both teams are really good.
There's a lot on the line and we're going to be really
motivated."
No. 7 Stanford faces off against the Oregon schools
this weekend, starting with No. 16 Oregon (16-6, 6-6
Pac-10). In its last meeting against the Card, Oregon
eked out a five-set victory, becoming one of only four
teams to defeat Stanford. This time, Stanford has the
home court advantage and looks to benefit from it.

Junior Cassidy Lichtman and the Cardinal still
have a chance at a Pac-10 title despite having four
conference losses. To continue its title dreams,
Stanford must win its home matches this weekend
against No. 16 Oregon and Oregon State.
"Oregon plays very fast, almost a
frantic pace you have to get your
self acclimated quickly," Dunning
said. "You have to make good deci
sions and be smart and be ahead of
them. If you're always catching up to
them, it's just going to be worse."
After allowing the Ducks to come
back and defeat the Cardinal, Dun
ning emphasized that Stanford will
not allow a repeat performance.
"I think that the team is prepared
more than we were the first time be
cause now we know what it feels
like," he said.
On Saturday, Stanford will take
on the Oregon State Beavers. Ore
gon State is 3-9 in the conference and

12-12 overall. Ranked ninth in the
Pac-10, the last meeting against the
Beavers proved triumphant for the
Card. Klineman and Ailes were
forceful weapons against the
Beavers, as Klineman recorded 20
kills and Ailes registered 32 digs.
Stanford has never lost to OSU, win
ning all 49 matchups.
"Oregon State is one of those
teams where you look at their record
and you wonder about them," Dun
ning said. "They're dangerous.
They're really a good team."
While their record is unimpres
sive, the Beavers come off a weekend
where they upset Arizona with a 3-1
win. Senior outside hitter Rachel
Rourke led the team with an impres
sive 31 kills and 12 digs.
"They have a great hitter on the
outside Rachel Rourke. She's re
ally physical and senior-motivated,"
Dunning said.

While the Card faces challenging
opponents in both Oregon teams, the
unpredictability of the Pac-10 contin
ues to prove true week in and week out.
"Everything is up for grabs. I
think our team knows that this is re
ally an important week," Dunning
said. "The Pac-10 has been amazing
this year and there's no question
that it's preparing everyone for the
playoffs."
Stanford's home court advantage
could change things up this time
around against the Oregon schools
and make the Pac-10 even harder to
pinpoint for the remainder of confer
ence play.
Game time is set for 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion on Friday against
Oregon and again at 7 p.m. on Satur
day against Oregon State.
