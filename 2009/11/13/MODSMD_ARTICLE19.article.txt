# Staying in the title race

### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The second time through the Pac-10 round robin
has drastically changed from the first and for the first
time in years, the top-seeded team has more than two
losses on the season.
What does this mean for Stanford volleyball? The
Cardinal is still in the race.
"We hope to come out of this weekend with two
solid victories under our belt and growing confidence
as we move toward the end of conference play," said
senior middle blocker Janet Okogbaa.
While Washington is still at the top of the confer
ence at 10-3 in Pac-10 play with UCLA right behind at
9-3, the two have yet to face each other in the second
half of conference play. This weekend could shake
things up in the Pac-10, depending on who takes home
two wins. Stanford sits in third place at 9-4 with neither
of these teams left on the schedule.
Although Stanford (16-7,9-4 Pac-10) lost last week
end to Washington and the weekend before to UCLA,
the schedule only gets easier for the rest of the season.
At Washington, junior Cassidy Lichtman hit 14
kills, nine assists and six digs. Junior Gabi Ailes contin
ued to climb her way to the top of Stanford's career list
with 29 digs in the loss. In the win over Washington
State, junior Alix Klineman stepped it up, registering
18 kills and nine digs.
Even with a loss last weekend, the team looks to
this weekend with a new attitude.
"I feel really good about [this weekend]," said
Head Coach John Dunning. "We've had a good week
at practice and we know both teams are really good.
There's a lot on the line and we're going to be really
motivated."
No. 7 Stanford faces off against the Oregon schools
this weekend, starting with No. 16 Oregon (16-6, 6-6
Pac-10). In its last meeting against the Card, Oregon
eked out a five-set victory, becoming one of only four
teams to defeat Stanford. This time, Stanford has the
home court advantage and looks to benefit from it.

Junior Cassidy Lichtman and the Cardinal still
have a chance at a Pac-10 title despite having four
conference losses. To continue its title dreams,
Stanford must win its home matches this weekend
against No. 16 Oregon and Oregon State.
