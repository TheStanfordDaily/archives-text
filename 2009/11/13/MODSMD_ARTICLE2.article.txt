## DE LA TORRE RESIGNS OVER HONOR CODE VIOLATION Will spend winter at home in L.A. 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Devin Banerjee 
Editor's Note: In a sudden and unexpected announce
ment Wednesday evening, ASSU Vice President Jay de la
Torre resigned from Stanford student government a
move we reported in Thursday's newspaper.
Speaking to me after the announcement, both Jay and
President David Gobaud insisted that Jay have a day to
prepare a statement regarding the reason behind the deci
sion. Jay then sat down with me Thursday afternoon to
present his statement and answer questions.
He resigned, he said, because he was recently found to
have violated the University Honor Code by copying
computer code in Computer Science 106A: Programming
Methodology, in fall 2008.
I asked Jay why he ran for the number-two position in
student government when he knew he had violated Stan
ford's honor code. His response: "I thought if I made my
case expressed my remorse well enough to the judi
cial affairs panel, I could mitigate the consequences. I was
very optimistic."
Jay will be pursuing community service "I'm look
ing at opportunities in education," he said —at home in
L.A. during winter quarter. He's on track to graduate in
June with a bachelor's degree in urban studies.
Below is Jay's full statement in its original form.

By Jayde la Torre
Two days ago at the joint leg
islative meeting with the Under
graduate Senate and the Graduate
Student Council, I announced my
resignation from my position as
AS SU Vice President, effective im
mediately. I took no questions, and
instead hoped to address the entire
student body later as to why I
stepped down. As promised, I want
to let the Stanford community
know the reasons for my resigna
tion.

Almost a year ago, I enrolled in
CSIO6A for a second time after receiving an "Incom
plete" the first time I took the course. Late in the quarter,


Jay was elected
V.P. in April
