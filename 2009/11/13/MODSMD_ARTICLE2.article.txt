## DE LA TORRE RESIGNS OVER HONOR CODE VIOLATION Will spend winter at home in L.A. 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Devin Banerjee 
Editor's Note: In a sudden and unexpected announce
ment Wednesday evening, ASSU Vice President Jay de la
Torre resigned from Stanford student government a
move we reported in Thursday's newspaper.
Speaking to me after the announcement, both Jay and
President David Gobaud insisted that Jay have a day to
prepare a statement regarding the reason behind the deci
sion. Jay then sat down with me Thursday afternoon to
present his statement and answer questions.
He resigned, he said, because he was recently found to
have violated the University Honor Code by copying
computer code in Computer Science 106A: Programming
Methodology, in fall 2008.
I asked Jay why he ran for the number-two position in
student government when he knew he had violated Stan
ford's honor code. His response: "I thought if I made my
case expressed my remorse well enough to the judi
cial affairs panel, I could mitigate the consequences. I was
very optimistic."
Jay will be pursuing community service "I'm look
ing at opportunities in education," he said —at home in
L.A. during winter quarter. He's on track to graduate in
June with a bachelor's degree in urban studies.
Below is Jay's full statement in its original form.

By Jayde la Torre
Two days ago at the joint leg
islative meeting with the Under
graduate Senate and the Graduate
Student Council, I announced my
resignation from my position as
AS SU Vice President, effective im
mediately. I took no questions, and
instead hoped to address the entire
student body later as to why I
stepped down. As promised, I want
to let the Stanford community
know the reasons for my resigna
tion.

Almost a year ago, I enrolled in
CSIO6A for a second time after receiving an "Incom
plete" the first time I took the course. Late in the quarter,


Jay was elected
V.P. in April
I had fallen behind in the class and on an as
signment, ran out of late days, and was ap
proaching the deadline to turn in said assign
ment. Fearful that I would fail the class if I did
n't turn in the assignment, I copied code from a
friend who had taken the class the year before
and turned in the assignment with the code as
if it were my own, violating the Honor Code.
After a year of being charged with a pla
giarism complaint, trying to schedule a panel
hearing, and me admitting responsibility for
my actions, a decision was reached. As per
the penalty code found in the Judicial Char
ter, I will have to take a quarter leave of ab
sence next quarter and will engage in 40
hours of community service to be completed
by the end of Spring Quarter 2010.
I decided to disclose my reason for resign
ing to the student body because I believe that
I have a political and moral obligation to do
so; the students elected me and I am account
able in my actions to them.

In addition, I hope that in revealing my sit
uation I will help at least one individual make
the decision not to engage in academic dis
honesty. My political and academic situation
aside, it has been a very difficult year for me
personally in dealing with the guilt I felt in
cheating. I am grateful for this experience in
at least one way, however: it has allowed me
to put my personal integrity in perspective,
and I value it now even more so now than I
did in the past, and have come to realization
that there are few things more important in
this world than honesty and a clear con
science.

I want to apologize first and foremost to
the student body; I ran last spring with the
full intention of completing my term. I truly
love this community and the people who
comprise it, and I wanted to give back in a
meaningful way to those who have given me
so much during my time here. Unfortunately,
as a result of my sanction, I will not be able to

fully follow through on my goals.
I would like to thank all of you for the
honor of serving as Vice President; it has
been such a meaningful experience. I have
had the privilege of meeting so many dedi
cated and inspiring individuals who have
changed my life for the better, and who will
go on to serve our communities in positive
ways.

I would also like to thank the faculty, staff,
and administration with whom I have been
able to work. They have been more than just
partners in serving the student body, but wise
and trustworthy mentors who are dedicated
to serving Stanford's student population.
I hope that you will join me in continuing
to support the work of the ASSU. I have
strong hope that the hard work of our stu
dent government officials, the student body,
and university administration, faculty, and
staff will lead to significant, positive change
for all students.
