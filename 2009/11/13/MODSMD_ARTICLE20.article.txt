## Cardinal dominates awards 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
Senior forward Kelley O'Hara has
been named the Pac-10's women's soc
cer player of the year, leading a Stan
ford sweep of the conference's end of
season individual awards.
Freshman midfielder Mariah
Noguiera won Pac-10 Newcomer of
the Year and head coach Paul Ratcliffe
won conference Coach of the Year for
the second season in a row. Aside
from these awards, the Cardinal also
had a dominating presence on the all
conference teams, placing five players
on the conference first team, two on
the second team, two honorable men
tions and four on the all-freshman
team.
O'Hara, though, is the headliner,
becoming the first Stanford player to
win player of the year since Marcia
Wallis in 2002. With the NCAA Tour
nament just beginning, O'Hara has al
ready eclipsed the school record for
goals in a season, with 23 so far in 21
matches. She has also recorded 11 as
sists, giving her 57 points on the year,
another single-season record.
"It's definitely an honor [to be
named Pac-10 player of the year],"
O'Hara said. "I'm excited, but in terms
of individual honors you only get there
with a great team. We've had a great
team, Paul got Coach of the Year,
Mariah got Freshman of the Year... I
couldn't have done it without a great
team."
O'Hara is also a finalist for the Her
mann award and the Lowe's Senior
CLASS Award. She has already been
named National Co-Player of the Year
by Top Drawer Soccer; an award she
shared with junior strike partner
Christen Press (16 goals, 13 assists).
Noguiera walked into the team's
starting lineup from day one, an im
pressive feat considering that Stanford
returned almost all of its midfielders
from last year's Final Four team. The
freshman has been a ball-winning ma
chine at her defensive midfield spot
and has also contributed on offense
(five goals, five assists), mainly through
set pieces. She becomes the third con
secutive Cardinal player to win the
Freshman of the Year, following for
ward Lindsay Taylor (2008) and Press
(2007).
Ratcliffe's honor was perhaps least

surprising after winning the award
last year, his team did even better this
year, sweeping its competition to its
first Pac-10 championship since 2002
while playing some of the best attack

ing soccer in the country.
Along with O'Hara and Nogueira,
senior fullback Ali Riley, freshman
fullback Rachel Quon, and Press were
all named to the All-Pac-10 first team.
Taylor and freshman center back
Alina Garciamendez were named to
the second team, while senior center
back Alicia Jenkins and sophomore
midfielder/utility player Cami Levin
were honorable mention. Nogueira,
Quon, Garciamendez and forward
Courtney Verloo made the All-Fresh
man team.

O'Hara says that although the indi
vidual awards are certainly something
to be proud of, the focus is still 100 per
cent on the team's goals.
"I didn't even think about [winning
individual awards] as a goal," she said.
"For me, it's a team goal and that's a
national championship. If I can do well
and get honors like this, then that's
great as long as the team is benefit
ing from it as well."
