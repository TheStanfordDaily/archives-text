# TIPPING OFF THE SEASON
## Men open at San Diego tonight 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With scrimmages and an exhibition
game over, the Stanford men's basket
ball team will open its regular season
against the University of San Diego
tonight at Jenny Craig Pavilion. The
Cardinal will then travel back to
Maples Pavilion to take on the Cal Poly
Mustangs on Sunday.
It will be the fifth meeting between
the Cardinal and the Toreros Stan
ford leads the series 3-1 and should
act as an early season test for coach
Johnny Dawkins's young squad. San
Diego finished 16-16 and fifth in the
tough West Coast Conference last sea
son, but is just two seasons removed
from upsetting Connecticut in the first
round of the 2008 NCAA Tournament.
"We'll hopefully send a big message
with this first game on the road against
San Diego," said redshirt junior guard
Da'Veed Dildy. "They're a really good
team in a really good conference and
they're good at home,"
San Diego is a smaller team that
uses a number of guards; in their exhi
bition victory over Occidental, they
started just one forward. They will trot
out a lineup that includes Matt Door,
De'Jon Johnson and Brandon John
son, among others. Johnson, the
Toreros' second leading scorer last
year, was granted an extra season of el
igibility over the summer. Together, the
trio accounted for nearly half of San
Diego's per game offensive input in the
2008-09 season.
Stanford will counter with a heavy
rotation that should extend deep into
the Cardinal's bench, which is limited.
However, the team received a major
boost when sophomore guard Jeremy
Green, who was suspended indefinite
ly last month, was reinstated; he will be
able to play against the Toreros. Addi
tionally, Stanford announced Thursday
that freshman Peter Abraham, a walk
on who played against Sonoma State in
the Cardinal's exhibition game, had
been added to the roster.
"A lot of people are going to have to
step up because we don't have a lot of
bodies," said senior swingman Landry
Fields. "You'll see a lot of players out
there."
Given the team's youth eight of
the players making the trip are either
freshmen or sophomores the
depth chart, including a regular start
ing five, has yet to be completely final
ized. Fields indicated that the first unit
from the Sonoma State game would
likely be similar to the starters sent
out against San Diego. Those five
players were Fields, Dildy, senior
guard Drew Shiller, redshirt sopho
more forward Andrew Zimmermann
and true sophomore forward Elliott
Bullock. Green, who was expected to
start at shooting guard this year, will

likely factor in as well.
Both Fields and Dildy emphasized
that the starters don't particularly mat
ter and that everyone will have to get
involved.
"The whole team has to be ready to
step in. That's something that Coach
Dawkins has been stressing every day
in practice. Everyone has to be ready to
play," Dildy said. "It will be a huge rota
tion and a lot of guys will get a lot of op
portunities."
"Eight or nine guys could probably
start on this team," he added.
Players will likely rotate positions as
well. Dildy noted that he would see
time at point guard as well as small for
ward; Dawkins hinted earlier that most
of the backcourt players are combo
guards without true positions.
Regardless of who sees the most
time and at what position, Fields will
likely be a constant for the Cardinal, as
he is the leading returner in literally
every possible statistical category.
"We've got a lot of young guys, so I
have to bring them along. Hopefully
they follow my lead," he said. "I'm the
primary scorer. It's got to be done. I'm
at this level in my college career, so it's
something I've fallen into. I have to do
that."
The offense, however, may not be
the main focus of the Cardinal this year,
as both Fields and Dildy highlighted
defense as the key going into the sea
son. Certainly, placing Dildy, a player
known more for his ability to guard the
perimeter than his scoring touch, at the
top of the rotation indicates the prima
cy of protecting the basket.
Part of this defensive emphasis
comes from a realistic view of the envi
ronment. Given the Cardinal's inexpe
rience and arduous schedule, minimiz
ing opponents' scoring opportunities
becomes crucial.
"We can achieve a lot of things, but
our margin of error is very small. We
can't have a lot of slipups or make
many mistakes," Fields said. "It all
starts on defense, you can't win any
thing without defense."
Indeed, despite being picked last in
the Pac-10 media poll, expectations re

Senior point guard Drew Shiller and the Stanford men's basketball team
hope to start out the season strong, as they open at San Diego tonight.
The Cardinal plays its home opener Sunday against Cal Poly.

main high for the year Dildy said
that the entire team carries a chip on its
shoulder. San Diego, then, provides an
early proving ground and the Cardinal
recognizes that: the players refuse to
even consider Sunday's match up with
Cal Poly before facing the Toreros.
"It's going to be a mental game,"
Fields said. "Big crowd not a home
crowd a lot of guys are going to see
a lot of playing time they haven't seen
before and it will all be on the road."
