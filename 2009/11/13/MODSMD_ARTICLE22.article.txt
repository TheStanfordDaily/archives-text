## Women's basketball signs nation's top recruit 
### 
The Stanford women's basketball
team is arguably the most talented
squad in the nation and yet Thursday,
it still found away to improve.
Chiney Ogwumike, the consensus
top recruit in the country, signed with
the Cardinal and will join her sister
Nnemkadi, a sophomore, on The
Farm next year. A 6-foot-3 power
forward, Ogwumike was choosing
between No. 2 Stanford, No. 1 Con
necticut and No. 4 Notre Dame. She
eventually eliminated the Irish, say
ing that her final choice was based on
both the academic and athletic offer
ings of the schools and that Stanford
gave her the best combination of the
two.

Ogwumike averaged 21.4 points
and 12.6 rebounds per game as a jun
ior for Cy-Fair High School and
began her senior year by dropping 28
points in Tuesday's opener.
She joins shooting guards Toni
Kokenis and Sara James in the Cardi
nal's 2010 recruiting class, which is
currently ranked No. 4 in the nation
by ESPN. James is the No. 18
prospect overall and No. 3 shooting
guard, while Kokenis is No. 60 over
all and the No. 15 shooting guard.
Both are viewed as physical players:
James averaged 10.6 rebounds per
game last year and Kokenis has a
good handle to go along with nice
foot speed.

Stanford begins its season today
against Old Dominion.
