# Gerhart named Doak Walker semifinalist
## 
### â€“ By Wyndam Makowsky 
Another day, another honor for
Toby Gerhart.
Stanford's senior running back
was chosen as a Doak Walker Award
semifinalist on Thursday, along with
nine other players across the nation.
The trophy, named in honor of South
ern Methodist University's former
Heisman winner, is given to the best
running back in the country. Oregon
State's Jacquizz Rodgers is the only
other Pac-10 ball carrier up for the
award. Fresno State's Ryan Mathews,
the top rusher in the country, rounds
out the West Coast delegation.
The other semifinalists are
UTEP's Donald Buckram, Georgia
Tech's Jonathan Dwyer, Alabama's
Mark Ingram, Pittsburgh's Dion
Lewis, Clemson's C.J. Spiller,
Auburn's Ben Tate and Virginia
Tech's Ryan Williams.
Gerhart is second in the nation
and first in the BCS in yards on the
ground and second in the country
and first among running backs in
rushing touchdowns.
Since its inception in 1990, no
Stanford player has won the award.
USC's Reggie Bush was the last Pac
-10 player to claim the trophy, in 2005.
The list will be cut down to three
finalists on Nov. 23 and the winner
will be chosen on Dec, 10.
