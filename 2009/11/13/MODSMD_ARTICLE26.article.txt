## EVEN INTERMISSION IS A TWI-HARD

Upon arriving at the Stonestown Galleria in San
Francisco on Monday night, the first thing I see
are hundreds of tween girls and their mothers
standing in the parking lots, buzzing excitedly to one
another. Death Cab For Cutie's "Meet Me On The
Equinox," the single from the "New Moon" sound
track, is blaring over the top of the audience and the
Hot Topic logo is splashed everywhere. One 14-year
old girl turns to me and says, "1 have been waiting out
here for six hours!"
Affectionately called "Twi-Hards," these diehard
fans have been standing outside in the cold all day in
anticipation of seeing two stars from the hit franchise
of the "Twilight Saga." Kellan Lutz, who plays mus
cled vampire Emmett Cullen, and Ashley Greene, who
brings omniscient vampire Alice Cullen to life, would
be arriving in a mere matter of minutes and these girls,
with the occasional and very rare male, were giddy

with anticipation.
It was complete pandemonium when the movie stars finally made it out onto the stage in the middle of
the parking lot. It literally hurt my ears the screaming was so high-pitched and loud. Lutz and Greene, however,
looked completely used to it. They were all smiles as they waved to the crowd, and it was apparent that hoards
of screaming fans were all in a day's work for them. After a minute of chaos mixed with admiration for the
sheer gorgeousness of Kellan Lutz, the emcee moved onto the question and answer session with the crowd.
While most of the questions were certainly not intelligent or even worth printing, a few moments were
particularly notable. One question asked Lutz if he would show the audience his famous abs, and after more
deafening shrieks from the audience, Emmett Cullen grabbed his shirt and quickly turned around and flashed
the back of the stage, causing moaning and uproar. However, there was no such excitement as when Lutz asked
the audience if they were "Team Edward" or "Team Jacob." Check out next week's issue to discover who
Intermission is loyal to . . .
