# GAIE TIES: UNPLUGED

It is that time of year
again, the time when cam
pus is plastered with the
same inexplicable posters,
The Daily is flooded with
offended letters to the editor
and Oski the Bear has been
impaled on the very tip of the
Claw.
This year's cryptic
poster advertises "Apocalypse
Cal: Gaieties 2009" and just
like every year before it, most
of the campus has virtually
no idea what is in store for
them, besides the inevitable
roasting of Cal and, more
importantly, the standard
group of naked people.
Despite the fact that
Gaieties is traditionally
shrouded in secrecy,
Intermission got a sneak pre
view at one of the last
rehearsals for this year's
show. Practicing in the
always glamorous Wilbur
Dining, many of Stanford's
finest thespians were warm
ing up in completely ridicu
lous clothing most of it
highlighter neon, with the

occasional onesie and Batman
suit thrown in. These aren't
their actual costumes, just
like Wilbur Dining isn't actu
ally their venue, but they
were determined to work with
what they have got to make
even rehearsal a wild experi
ence.
After multiple ridicu
lous warm-ups and a unifying
cheer of "1, 2, 3, Gaieties!"
everybody took the "stage."
The show opens on a narrator
laying out the scene of the
annual Activities Fair, which

is prime fodder for Gaieties,
as it allows every student
group to be made fun of,
whether it be fraternities,
robotics, Synergy or the
ASSU. The writers even trash
talk The Daily, hounding a
freshman with "Please write
for the Daily, none of us
know how!"
Don't worry, various
student groups. Gaieties
know that they aren't even
they exempt from the
ridicule. One hounds the
freshman with, "Can you
sing? Can you act? Can you
dance?"
The freshman says,
"No."
"Are you willing to
show your titties onstage?
Join Gaieties!"
Throughout the show,
it is clear that the writers
understood that the cast
would not necessarily bring
with them an arsenal of musi
cal theater skills. When asked
if singing and dancing were
part of the audition form, one
actor responded, "I'm not

sure, but they did ask what
porn best represents my life."
While the show is not
completely reliant upon sexu
al humor, the script has some
of its best moments steeped
in dirty jokes, most too
raunchy to be printed. One of
the most hysterical segments
is found in watching Chico
State and Duke exemplify
their respective stereotypes
by sexing up with each other
for virtually the entire show.
But it's not just Chico
State, Duke and, of course,

Cal that are eviscerated
throughout the play. Perhaps
the most wonderful thing
about the play is the taunting
of the nation's other best
schools, all the while reiter
ating that Stanford has the
"happiest students in the
world and is the campus
most photographed by Asian
tourists!" The show is rife
with Stanford pride, going so
far as to declare in song,
"Hogwarts isn't half as
nice."
For those of you con
cerned about a wobbly plot
line, subpar singing and
dancing, and general chaos
on stage, your fears are like
ly to be validated. But for
those of you looking for a
great time, you will not be
disappointed. If one actor is
just not doing it for you, the
beauty of this production is
that there will always be
somebody on stage to make
you laugh, whether or not it's
the focal point of the show.
The entire play is one big
inside joke and the audience

will laugh together with
reflections on IHUM, a com
plete roasting of the Greek
system and most importantly,
a pervading hatred of Cal. As
a girl in the show says, "Let's
do the Stanford-iest thing we
can do ... go to Gaieties!"
