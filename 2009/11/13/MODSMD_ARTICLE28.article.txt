# Robber Barons: Stealing the show?

If you're looking for a bit of fun this week
end, check out Campbell Recital Hall this
Friday or Saturday. The Robber Barons,
Stanford's only sketch comedy group, are
holding their fall quarter show. Although it's
called "The Robber Barons Expose
Themselves," there is relatively no nudity.
Instead, the group exposes themselves artisti
cally as they start to take on the more obscure
in their quest for comedy. In this particular
showcase, sometimes it works and sometimes
the comedy mark is missed.
Some of the edgier sketches include
"The Lord Ford." It has laugh potential, but
fails to overcome the obscurity of its plot.
Similarly, several sketches like "The

Courtroom" have good acting and comedic
moments, but ultimately fall short in coher
ence it's funny, it just doesn't make sense.
The Robber Barons rally with their uncanny
ability to put together witty, well-rounded
relationship sketches. "The Baby Shower,"
my favorite of the night, also helps pull the
show together. Julia Meltzer plays her usual
over-enthused, erratic character flawlessly.
She also begs the point that the Robber
Barons may still have to rely a little too much
on the strength of their stock characters and
plots to get a good laugh in. The finale fol
lows suit: it is an equally funny sketch once it
pulls the "awww, family! Look what you've
done now!" card.
Although they flaunt their proficiency
in creating funny sketches about everyday
persons and situations, the Robber Barons'
ability to master more atypical comedy still
eludes them. "The Shoes Show," for example,
is a funny sketch played by talented and com
mitted actors. It also seems to resemble too
many of the mock talk shows you can see in
old episodes of SNL. The Robber Barons are
starting to master the basic art of comedy in
their second year of existence. One sketch,

which is revisited several times throughout
the show, gets significantly funnier and more
creative each time it appears. They just need
to work on making their eccentric sketches
also carry weight.
Ultimately, the Robber Barons present
a mixed bag, which is ideal for a comedy
show. Every sketch has its funny moments.
Some follow through, others don't. But in the
end, it works. The show gets funnier as it pro
gresses. The variety of sketches ensures that
there is at least something for every comedic
fan. Old and new Robber Barons fans alike
can find something to laugh about. Whether
you prefer crude jokes, celebrity impressions
or witty ironic reflections of relationships, I

guarantee that you'll love at least some of the
sketches. Overall, the show is definitely enter
taining.
Get ready to sit for about an hour, as
the 18 sketches last anywhere from 35 sec
onds to a few minutes. Although the pieces
seem short, they help the show move along
rather quickly. As a result, the show never
drags, which helps keep the audience capti
vated in light of the fact that there is no inter
mission. This is aided by the music chosen to
fill the interludes between sketches, which is,
as always, well chosen.
