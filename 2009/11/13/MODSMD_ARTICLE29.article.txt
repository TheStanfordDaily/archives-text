# GIVING THE CROWD SOMETHING TO SINK THEIR TEETH INTO

Five years ago in the
heat of summer, Ezra
Koenig sat in the base
ment of his parents' New
Jersey home contemplating,
among other things, an 'Bos
vampire flick. Having just
finished the cult classic "The
Lost Boys," he was intrigued
by the harrowing plot, Kiefer
Sutherland's role as lead
vampire and, in particular, the
movie's locale.
Set in the fictional
coastal California town of
Santa Carla, the movie caught
the imagination of Koenig,
who vowed that one day he
would visit Santa Carla and
its vampire population. So
logically, he formed a band
with some friends and called
it Vampire Weekend, released
a wildly successful self-titled

album and finally made the
long trek out to the supposed
ly fictional place.
Sunday's show was a
vision five years in the mak
ing.
On Sunday night,
Vampire Weekend played a
sold-out show at The Catalyst
in Santa Cruz, or the real-life
equivalent of Santa Carla. It
was Santa Cruz where the
movie for the band's inspira
tion was filmed and it was
Santa Cruz that Koenig had
dreamed about.
If anything, it was an
awkward "homecoming," as
the quartet was returning to
their place of origin without
ever having visited in the first
place. Still, they made them
selves at home. Drummer
Chris Tomson sported a

throwback San Jose Sharks T
shirt, while Koenig managed
to turn on the charm and woo
the balconies with a smile
that read, "Hey guys, remem
ber us?"
The Catalyst wel
comed the boys with arms
wide open. A narrow venue,
The Catalyst was more auto
garage than concert venue,
with stereos hung haphazard
from the ceilings and multi
color spotlights shining in
every direction. And while it
took some time to get into the
venue due to some shoddy
security procedures, which
forced many to miss openers
Pocahaunted, once inside, the
crowd was treated to an inti
mate setting that Vampire
Weekend would thrive in.
The band took the

stage shortly after 9 p.m. and
in quick succession fired off
two songs, "White Sky" and
"Holiday" off their up-com
ing release "Contra". While it
took the crowd some time to
get acclimated to the new
songs, they realized that the
tracks were much in the same
mold of the band's earlier
releases and were obliged to
at least bob their heads and
clap hands. But if there were
any doubts, they were erased
by the familiar guitar twang
of "Cape Cod Kwassa
Kwassa," which brought
about massive cheers for the
first recognized track of the
night.
And for most of the
set, that's just about how it
went, with the band using the
show as a platform to exhibit
their new album. Among the

particularly impressive songs
was "Cousins," an up-tempo
track featuring a Mexican
mariachi-like base line and a
surf rock guitar scale, paced
by Koenig's fast, yodeling
voice. "California English"
also provided a unique look
into the band's experimenta
tion, featuring auto-tuned
vocals a la keyboardist's
Rostam Batamnglij's side
project, Discovery.
Yet, despite the new
ness of it all, the band still
managed to placate the
crowd, and Koenig kept the
interest by employing a call
and response in "One," and
pumping out "Campus" and
"Oxford Comma" before
leaving the stage pre-encore.
Yet interestingly enough,
even with new music fodder,
Vampire Weekend managed

to play a relatively short set,
one of the most common crit
icisms of a band that, before
"Contra," had simply been
working off one album.
The band, returned
nonetheless, to play a three
song encore, ending with
what else, but "Walcott."
"One of our first orders of
business [after establishing
this band] was this song,"
Koenig explained. A song
about a vampire escaping the
confines of Cape Cod, there
was no better way to end
Vampire Weekend's return
"home".
