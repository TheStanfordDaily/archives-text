The self-proclaimed
lone black kid in
Malibu is back and the
follow-up to his eponymous
debut album is exactly what
any Shwayze fan has come to
expect from the talented 24-
year-old hip hop artist.
Shwayze became an
overnight sensation last year
by utilizing a simple yet
effective method: rap over a
relaxed guitar and drum beat
and have a rock front man,
Cisco Adler, provide the
hooks. The result was some
thing generally unforeseen in
hip-hop, easy listening.
Shwayze's surprising
ly witty and relatable lyrics
and impressive flow only
aided his advancement.

Among mainstream rappers,
he stands out because his life
story is so dramatically dif
ferent than most. He didn't
grow up in the hood, so he
doesn't talk about the proj
ects. Although not rich, he
was raised in an affluent city
and doesn't sing about vio
lence or pushing drugs to sur
vive. Instead, he raps about
situations most college kids
can understand: partying,
hanging out, first love, hook
ing up, getting rejected and,
of course, staying inebriated.
Therein lies his niche and he
exploits it.
"Let It Beat," which
dropped on Nov. 3, does not
deviate far from the norm.
There are slight evolutions in

style, but for the most part,
the album continues to follow
the established formula, simi
lar subject matter with
Shwayze on the verses and
Adler on the chorus.
The main progression
is with the instrumentals,
which can best be described
as a souped-up version of the
basic guitar and drums from
"Shwayze." Those are
omnipresent and songs like
"Crazy For You" could easily
be off of the first album, but
there are additions. "Daze
Like This," for example, adds
brass to the equation, while
the first single, "Get U
Home," heavily uses drum
machines and synthesizers.
Yet while electronics

find a home on "Let It Beat,"
they are often subdued. The
songs aren't about the beat;
they're about Shwayze's story
du jour. "Sally Is a . . . ," for
example, uses a drum
machine, but it is but one part
of a larger musical compo
nent that is, on the whole,
subservient to Shwayze and
Adler's vocals.
Lyrically, "Let It
Beat" is similar to "Shwayze"
in that it presents a dichoto
my of unadulterated fun and
wishful nostalgia of days and
girls past. But on "Let It
Beat," Shwayze appears even
more enthusiastic about the
former. The fast-paced,
almost eager "Down At The
Motel," for example, is a

blunt description of a typical
Shwayze party explained
through audience-appropriate
lyrics: "It's BYOB, so it don't
matter if you ain't got a fake
ID. " There's simply a higher
concentration of fun; even
"Maneatrr," a tune about
scary encounters with the
opposite sex, is relentless in
its energy.
Also adding a twist:
more guest stars. Whereas
"Shwayze" had one feature,
Dave Navarro, "Let It Beat"
has numerous appearances
from both vocalists and musi
cians. Snoop Dogg lends his
voice to "Livin It Up" and
The E Street Band's pianist
Roy Bittan can be heard on
"Heart and Soul."

"Let It Beat" isn't
transcendent, but the combi
nation of these modifications
with Shwayze's established
style makes for an album that
advances slightly while
remaining happily familiar.
