£ £Mad Men" has never
been one to stoop to the
cliffhanger level in its
season finales it doesn't
have to but this week's
Season Three finale solidified
"Mad Men's" ability to defy
TV conventions and our juve
nile viewer expectations.
This season, "Mad
Men" covered a lot of the
same cultural material that
was handled in the first sea
son of my first TV love,
NBC's "American Dreams."
Specifically, both shows had
the suburban housewife read
Mary McCarthy's "The
Group" and foreshadowed the

Vietnam War (Joan's husband
and JJ both enlist as an
answer to, what happens to a
dream deferred) as only liber
al TV shows can. The treat
ment of the Kennedy assassi
nation, however, distinguish
es the boys from the men, or
in this case distinguishes the
Emmy-winning drama from
the primetime soap opera air
ing before "The West Wing."
While "American
Dreams" milked the events
and stereotypes of the era to
make us invest in the charac
ters through pathos, "Mad
Men" examines the 1960s
through the lens of its charac

ters. On "Mad Men," the
Kennedy assassination ruined
Margaret's wedding and gave
Roger some perspective; it
gave Pete Campbell an
excuse to be self-indulgent
and to distance himself from
SC, and effectively broke the
Draper marriage. On
"American Dreams," the
Pryor family and the world
wallowed; on "Mad Men,"
the characters, looking
inward in a different way,
gained self-awareness.
If, historically, the
Kennedy assassination is the
end of Camelot for America,
then Don Draper saw his

expulsion from his own two
Camelots: his home in
Ossining with Betty and his
office in Manhattan with
Sterling Cooper. Betty, Don's
Lady Guinevere, puts an end
to the Hamlet-like indecision
of their marriage when she
announces her plans for
divorce. The Dick Whitman

American Dream of having a
happy home has died.
This is what I mean
when I talk about Mad Men
defying convention. Matt
Weiner, the show's creator, is
fond of the last moment
magician's reveal, such as
Peggy's pregnancy to end
Season One and the sale of
SC to PPL to end Season
Two. The formation of Don's
new agency and the abandon
ment of the two familiar
backdrops for his life, how
ever, occur early in this
episode; we know the plan
won't be thwarted and we
know there's no hope for
Betty and Don.
The beauty of this
episode as a season finale,
then, lies in the hope and the
complete unknown, much the
opposite of what America
faced at the end of 1963.1
don't anticipate a fast-for
ward a la Season One to
Season Two, because we as
an audience enjoy the build
ing of the new company far
too much. If this was an
episode about Don's relation
ships and his honest con
frontation of all of them, then
Season Four and SCDP will

force the other characters to
do the same.
Season Three was not
about a unified Sterling
Cooper team. Roger and Don
fought, Peggy went out in
search of herself, Lane Pryce
was alone and British, Pete
and Ken sparred, and Joan
started wearing pants when
she left the workplace. The
finale has brought the
Sterling Cooper core that we
love so much back together.
In a time in American history
when the American family
dynamic was changing, it
seems appropriate for Weiner
to anchor his show in the
individual, Don Draper, and a
family built around ideals and
hope Sterling Cooper
Draper Pryce. If only they
needed interns.
