# TROJAN WAR
## Stanford, USC square off in L.A. 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Oct. 6, 2007, Stanford shocked the world with ar
guably the greatest upset in the modern era of college foot
ball, beating USC 24-23 at the Los Angeles Coliseum. But
an upset this Saturday against the Trojans wouldn't ruffle
too many feathers, which is a testament to the strides that
Coach Jim Harbaugh's program has made the last three
years.
Stanford (6-3,5-2 Pac-10) comes into Saturday's match
up with the Trojans (7-2,4-2 Pac-10) riding higher than it
has in nearly a decade after taking out then-No. 7 Oregon.
That said, beating the Trojans in the Coliseum again is not
going to be an easy feat and the Cardinal knows it.
"It's USC," said redshirt freshman quarterback Andrew
Luck. "They've got one of the best programs in college
football the past 10 years. We don't need any extra motiva
tion to play this team. It's going to be a challenge; it's not
going to be a walk in the park by any means. We're going to
have to bring our A-game or they're going to exploit us."
"Coach [Pete] Carroll is going to have a team that's
going to be ready to play," said senior linebacker Will Pow
ers. "We're expecting their best. We expect them to play up
to their ability."
Stanford comes into Saturday's game ranked for the
first time since 2001, as the Associated Press took note of
last week's win over the Ducks by awarding the Cardinal
with its No. 25 ranking.
"I think it's nice to get a little recognition, but we're not
too caught up with that," Luck said. "We've still got our
eyes set on trying to beat USC in the next week."
The Trojans may be having a down year by their stan
dards, but that still equates them to being one of the top
teams in the conference. Led by true freshman Matt
Barkley at quarterback, USC is chock-full of athletes on
both sides of the ball, such as running back Joe McKnight
and safety Taylor Mays.
Despite all their talent, though, the Trojans are in seri
ous jeopardy of not winning the Pac-10 title for the first
time in eight years. USC first stumbled against Washington
in its Pac-10 opener, losing 16-13, before being embar
rassed by Oregon 47-20 on Halloween. Many have specu
lated that departures from Carroll's previously elite staff
which used to boast names such as Norm Chow, Steve
Sarkisian and Lane Kiffin have been behind the Tro
jans' fall, especially on the offensive side of the ball.

NOTES: No. 25 Stanford looks to keep its
Rose Bowl hopes alive when it travels to
Los Angeles to take on perennial power
house No. 11 USC. The Cardinal
clinched bowl eligibility last Saturday
with a win over then-No. 7 Oregon.
Stanford has won only two of its past 11
road games, but the Cardinal did win its
last game at the Coliseum, the so-called
"Biggest Upset Ever" in 2007.
