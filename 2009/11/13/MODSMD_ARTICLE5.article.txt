## Stanford guard Jeremy Green reinstated after indefinite suspension 
### â€“ By Wyndam Makowsky 
Just a day before kicking off its
regular season, the men's basket
ball team reinstated sophomore
Jeremy Green, who was suspend
ed indefinitely in late October
after being arrested on suspicion
of felony domestic violence.
Green has yet to be charged
and Head Coach Johnny
Dawkins indicated that the lack
of a formal accusation of guilt led
to his decision that is to say,
punishing Green preemptively
and so extensively did not sit right
with him.
Green will be eligible to play
against San Diego tonight. A po
tent scorer, especially from three
point range, Green has the sec
ond-highest points per game av
erage of any returning Cardinal
player. After finishing strong last
season, he was expected to as
sume the starting shooting guard
role this year. The suspension put
those plans on hold, but now, an
offensively inexperienced Stan
ford team regains one of its
biggest threats.
The Cardinal begins its 2009-
10 season on the road tonight
against the Toreros at 7 p.m.
