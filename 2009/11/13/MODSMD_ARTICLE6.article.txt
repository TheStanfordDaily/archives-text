# Give the points system the axe
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Dear Bob Bowlsby, members of
the athletics support staffs di
rectors of football operations
and season ticket holders,
It is my intention to write to you to
discuss a very important issue concern
ing our football team and the Red Zone
student section.
According to the current "points"
system, only students who have eight or
more points will be admitted to the Cal
game next Saturday and all other stu
dents will be on "standby." In order to
have at least eight points, a student must
have attended at least three of the first
five home games, most likely four of
them.
This letter's intention is for the
"points" system to be axed (yes, pun in
tended) , so that all students who want to
go to Big Game can go to Big Game
without having to wait to see if the stu

dent section fills up or not.
I don't care that the loyal students
who attended all the games may not be
rewarded by guaranteed seating. I don't
care that in order for this to happen the
student section may be crammed. I also
don't care about the result at USC this
weekend. At least as far as our crowd is
concerned, win or lose in L.A. tomor
row, the game on Nov. 21 against Cal is
a huge one.

Students will want to come to the
game against Cal and the Red Zone
section could be full a win tomorrow
almost guarantees this. I say, let it get
full. Let it get over capacity so that stu
dents are on top of each other, extend
ing into the regular admission seating.
Let every student who wants to get in,
get in and not have to wait with the pos
sibility of not getting in. I think it will
make the Big Game atmosphere that
much better. I don't know a coach or a
player on the football team that would
disagree with me wanting as many stu
dents as possible in the game.
Why would we possibly turn away
fans when we have not filled up the sta
dium once this year? Why would we
turn away students, some of the best
fans we've got? Do we want our home
field advantage to evaporate in a sea of
blue and gold? I know students are ex
tremely lucky to have "free" admission
into the games, something almost no
other school has. But given this fact, we

should not consider turning students
away. Every student who wants to go
should be in that stadium next Satur
day. If the Red Zone does not get to full
capacity, fine but at least everyone
who wanted to go to the game was able
to go.

Stanford football is at an eight-year
high right now and limiting student en
trance into the games could ruin all the
momentum that this campus has going
right now. You can't be serious when
you want to potentially limit student en
trance to the game based on prior atten
dance. We should welcome the students
who may be showing up for the first
time. We want them in the stadium, in
creasing the number of fans in cardinal
and white. If more than 3,500 students,
the Red Zone capacity, want to come
out for the game, let them be able to get
in without waiting in a separate line.
If you really want to break this down
economically, there might even be a
higher return to the athletic depart
ment by letting more students in for the
Cal game. More students at the Cal
game means a possible overflow of the
Red Zone into general admission seats
into the south end zone. Having more
students at the Cal game gives Stanford
a better chance to win the game and im
prove our record. The money that
would be lost from these general admis
sion seats (say, 500 seats at $65 a seat,
$32,500) could be made up by a higher
payout from a better bowl game be
cause of our better record. The differ
ence between bowl payouts with one
more win could be huge; after splitting
with all other teams in the Pac-10, it
could be $50,000 or more. As an eco

nomics major, I say letting all students
in could definitely be worth it.
So please, Mr. Bowlsby or whoever
is making this decision, let any student
who wants to come to Big Game be al
lowed into Big Game. Don't make any
one wait in a separate line. The people
who have come in the past will be there
and it won't matter that they have "pri
ority points" because they will probably
be there early enough that it won't mat
ter. Let the momentum of an exciting
time on the Farm continue. Don't stifle
it by giving students a hint of uncertain
ty because they may not have enough
points. It would be a shame if even one
student stayed in the dorms next Satur
day because he or she thought it would
be too much of a hassle to get into the
game.

I hope the athletic department will
take all this into consideration and re
visit the "points" policy. The campus is
abuzz. The fans are abuzz. The team is
fired up.The students want to come and
support their bowl-bound football
team. Against Cal, the team will need
everyone behind it. I hope that every
student who wants to go to Big Game
will be in that stadium next Saturday. I
hope the only line I see at Gate 3 is the
one line to enter, miles long because
thousands of students want to cheer
and rally and help the team beat Cal.
Do it for the students, the campus and
the team. Do it because that is how this
program will make its mark.

Danny Belch swears he's got enough
points to get into Big Game anyway. Ask
him to lend you a few at dbelchl@stan

field advantage to evaporate in a sea of
blue and gold? I know students are ex
tremely lucky to have "free" admission
into the games, something almost no
other school has. But given this fact, we

should not consider turning students
away. Every student who wants to go
should be in that stadium next Satur
day. If the Red Zone does not get to full
capacity, fine but at least everyone
who wanted to go to the game was able
to go.

Stanford football is at an eight-year
high right now and limiting student en
trance into the games could ruin all the
momentum that this campus has going
right now. You can't be serious when
you want to potentially limit student en
trance to the game based on prior atten
dance. We should welcome the students
who may be showing up for the first
time. We want them in the stadium, in
creasing the number of fans in cardinal
and white. If more than 3,500 students,
the Red Zone capacity, want to come
out for the game, let them be able to get
in without waiting in a separate line.
If you really want to break this down
economically, there might even be a
higher return to the athletic depart
ment by letting more students in for the
Cal game. More students at the Cal
game means a possible overflow of the
Red Zone into general admission seats
into the south end zone. Having more
students at the Cal game gives Stanford
a better chance to win the game and im
prove our record. The money that
would be lost from these general admis
sion seats (say, 500 seats at $65 a seat,
$32,500) could be made up by a higher
payout from a better bowl game be
cause of our better record. The differ
ence between bowl payouts with one
more win could be huge; after splitting
with all other teams in the Pac-10, it
could be $50,000 or more. As an eco

nomics major, I say letting all students
in could definitely be worth it.
So please, Mr. Bowlsby or whoever
is making this decision, let any student
who wants to come to Big Game be al
lowed into Big Game. Don't make any
one wait in a separate line. The people
who have come in the past will be there
and it won't matter that they have "pri
ority points" because they will probably
be there early enough that it won't mat
ter. Let the momentum of an exciting
time on the Farm continue. Don't stifle
it by giving students a hint of uncertain
ty because they may not have enough
points. It would be a shame if even one
student stayed in the dorms next Satur
day because he or she thought it would
be too much of a hassle to get into the
game.

I hope the athletic department will
take all this into consideration and re
visit the "points" policy. The campus is
abuzz. The fans are abuzz. The team is
fired up.The students want to come and
support their bowl-bound football
team. Against Cal, the team will need
everyone behind it. I hope that every
student who wants to go to Big Game
will be in that stadium next Saturday. I
hope the only line I see at Gate 3 is the
one line to enter, miles long because
thousands of students want to cheer
and rally and help the team beat Cal.
Do it for the students, the campus and
the team. Do it because that is how this
program will make its mark.

Danny Belch swears he's got enough
points to get into Big Game anyway. Ask
him to lend you a few at dbelchl@stan
ford.edu.

At Big Game 2007, the last time Stanford hosted Cal, Stanford Stadium hosted an enormous crowd, seen here celebrating
after the victory. This year, student attendance may be limited based on a points system rewarding attendance at prior games.
