## Buddy Brown is in the barn University asks longtime trainer Nancy Hey to leave, seeks new level' for equestrian team 
### RYAN MAC ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITORS 
Nancy Hey has been at Stanford longer
than some of the buildings on West Campus.
Having ridden horses here since 1971 and
run a horse-training business out of the
Stanford Red Barn since 1980, she remem
bers when most of the land around the barn
was just open space.
"All of this was pastures," she said, waving
her hand toward Lyman Graduate
Residence. "All of this part, and there were
no buildings there, of course,"
Hey, who once worked with the Stanford
equestrian team and runs her company,
Strideaway Farms, out of the barn that
Leland Stanford built in 1878, continued:

"In the mornings," she said, "they'd let out
the school horses, they'd just let them loose
and they would run down the road and they
knew right where to go and they'd stand in
their little places. And in the afternoon,
they'd turn around and run back and they'd
go right into their pasture."
"Lots of great memories," Hey said. "So
I'll be sad to leave that."

But come January, Hey will leave
Stanford not to retire, but to make way
for new trainer and former Olympic eques
trian William "Buddy" Brown. Stanford
recruited him late last month to move his rid
ing business here and, as Stanford's head
equestrian coach, Vanessa Bartsch '99 hopes,
"take our training to the next level."
Bartsch, also the barn's executive direc
tor, explained that the sea change was

intended to address "critical needs" in the
riding community here, where the number of
students competing has quadrupled since the
University took over barn management in
2004.
"The critical need at Stanford is for
Olympic-caliber training so that our students
can make that next jump into national and
international competition," Bartsch said in a
statement released Nov. 5.
Later, Bartsch told The Daily that the
change is "like going from my high school
gym teacher to Tiger Woods teaching me
how to play golf."
Brown is set to be joined in January by his
wife, Vanessa Tuss Brown, and another pro
fessional trainer, Mandy Porter. The trio is
expected to work with private riders and the
Stanford equestrian team, currently ranked
third in the nation, as well as to oversee a rid
ing academy beginning next summer.
Their arrival, however, calls for the Red
Barn stalls where Hey and her clients keep
their horses. Currently, Hey has no formal
affiliation with the equestrian team, and
rents stalls to house her and her clients' hors
es 25 in total.
"Unfortunately, we are unable to support
two trainers at the Red Barn because of the
severe space restrictions," Athletics officials
wrote to the Red Barn community in an Oct.
21 e-mail, which Hey said was sent just hours
after she learned the news.
"Nancy's private clients are not being
asked to leave and are welcome to remain at
the Red Barn," the e-mail said.
Hey, who estimated that 85 to 90 percent
of her clients have been alumni or immedi

ate family of alumni, said that despite the
University's offer, all of them are following
her off campus at the end of the year. Some
of them were disappointed with how they
heard the news and how much time Hey was
given to relocate too little time, according
to one client.
Jill Layman and her three children have
been riding with Hey at Stanford Red Barn
for five years.
"As a client of Nancy's, I'm saddened to
leave Stanford, but will follow Nancy wher
ever she can find space for her program,"
Layman wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"While I respect the University's right to
make any changes it deems necessary to
improve its program, I'm disappointed in the
way Nancy has been treated (given only 60
days to relocate 25 horses over the
Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays) as
well as the attempt to woo Nancy's clients
away from her."
But Athletics officials insist they have
handled the transition as fairly as possible,
and emphasize the positive impact they
believe Brown will have here.
"Stanford's interest was in communicat
ing with all of our boarders and students at
the same time, in the same way so we could
minimize rumors and be fair to everyone,"
Deputy Director of Athletics Ray Purpur
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily, explaining
the Oct. 21 announcement.
As for the transition, "it seems to be going
very smooth," Purpur said. "We are looking

Nancy Hey has given riding lessons at Stanford's Red Barn since 1980. She and her clients
will move 25 horses off campus by year's end. Being asked to leave was "a complete shock."

Claudius and 24 other horses owned by Nancy Hey and her clients will leave Stanford in December. Officials called the decision to remove
Hey "a difficult one," but said it would ultimately create opportunities for an equestrian program that has quadrupled in four years.
