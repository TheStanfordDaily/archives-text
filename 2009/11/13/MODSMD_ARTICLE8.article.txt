## Buddy Brown is in the barn University asks longtime trainer Nancy Hey to leave, seeks new level' for equestrian team 
### RYAN MAC ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITORS 
Nancy Hey has been at Stanford longer
than some of the buildings on West Campus.
Having ridden horses here since 1971 and
run a horse-training business out of the
Stanford Red Barn since 1980, she remem
bers when most of the land around the barn
was just open space.
"All of this was pastures," she said, waving
her hand toward Lyman Graduate
Residence. "All of this part, and there were
no buildings there, of course,"
Hey, who once worked with the Stanford
equestrian team and runs her company,
Strideaway Farms, out of the barn that
Leland Stanford built in 1878, continued:

"In the mornings," she said, "they'd let out
the school horses, they'd just let them loose
and they would run down the road and they
knew right where to go and they'd stand in
their little places. And in the afternoon,
they'd turn around and run back and they'd
go right into their pasture."
"Lots of great memories," Hey said. "So
I'll be sad to leave that."

But come January, Hey will leave
Stanford not to retire, but to make way
for new trainer and former Olympic eques
trian William "Buddy" Brown. Stanford
recruited him late last month to move his rid
ing business here and, as Stanford's head
equestrian coach, Vanessa Bartsch '99 hopes,
"take our training to the next level."
Bartsch, also the barn's executive direc
tor, explained that the sea change was

intended to address "critical needs" in the
riding community here, where the number of
students competing has quadrupled since the
University took over barn management in
2004.
"The critical need at Stanford is for
Olympic-caliber training so that our students
can make that next jump into national and
international competition," Bartsch said in a
statement released Nov. 5.
Later, Bartsch told The Daily that the
change is "like going from my high school
gym teacher to Tiger Woods teaching me
how to play golf."
Brown is set to be joined in January by his
wife, Vanessa Tuss Brown, and another pro
fessional trainer, Mandy Porter. The trio is
expected to work with private riders and the
Stanford equestrian team, currently ranked
third in the nation, as well as to oversee a rid
ing academy beginning next summer.
Their arrival, however, calls for the Red
Barn stalls where Hey and her clients keep
their horses. Currently, Hey has no formal
affiliation with the equestrian team, and
rents stalls to house her and her clients' hors
es 25 in total.
"Unfortunately, we are unable to support
two trainers at the Red Barn because of the
severe space restrictions," Athletics officials
wrote to the Red Barn community in an Oct.
21 e-mail, which Hey said was sent just hours
after she learned the news.
"Nancy's private clients are not being
asked to leave and are welcome to remain at
the Red Barn," the e-mail said.
Hey, who estimated that 85 to 90 percent
of her clients have been alumni or immedi

ate family of alumni, said that despite the
University's offer, all of them are following
her off campus at the end of the year. Some
of them were disappointed with how they
heard the news and how much time Hey was
given to relocate too little time, according
to one client.
Jill Layman and her three children have
been riding with Hey at Stanford Red Barn
for five years.
"As a client of Nancy's, I'm saddened to
leave Stanford, but will follow Nancy wher
ever she can find space for her program,"
Layman wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"While I respect the University's right to
make any changes it deems necessary to
improve its program, I'm disappointed in the
way Nancy has been treated (given only 60
days to relocate 25 horses over the
Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays) as
well as the attempt to woo Nancy's clients
away from her."
But Athletics officials insist they have
handled the transition as fairly as possible,
and emphasize the positive impact they
believe Brown will have here.
"Stanford's interest was in communicat
ing with all of our boarders and students at
the same time, in the same way so we could
minimize rumors and be fair to everyone,"
Deputy Director of Athletics Ray Purpur
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily, explaining
the Oct. 21 announcement.
As for the transition, "it seems to be going
very smooth," Purpur said. "We are looking

Nancy Hey has given riding lessons at Stanford's Red Barn since 1980. She and her clients
will move 25 horses off campus by year's end. Being asked to leave was "a complete shock."

Claudius and 24 other horses owned by Nancy Hey and her clients will leave Stanford in December. Officials called the decision to remove
Hey "a difficult one," but said it would ultimately create opportunities for an equestrian program that has quadrupled in four years.

Buddy Brown shows at Spruce Meadows in 2005. He will move his training business to
Stanford in January. Officials said he can take the equestrian program "to the next level."
forward to making things better for
the students at Stanford."
Brown, for his part, shares that
sentiment.
"I'm excited about the move," he
said in an interview with The Daily.
"I'm looking forward to working
with people who are there to learn."
Touting his credentials. Brown
said he has been a rider "most of my
life," but that "the twilight years of
my riding are coming together
now."
"I've done a lot of good stuff as a
rider," he added. "I think I'm quite a
good teacher... I just hope to be
another stepping stone for some of
these kids."
Brown, 53, was a member of the
1976 U.S. Olympic team and
remains the youngest person to ever
win the Grand Prix of Dublin. He
has owned and trained show horses
for years and most recently trained
the top horse at the Grand Prix of
Indio. He and his wife now run
Derby Hill Farm in Livermore,
Calif., and said that they will com
mute to Stanford.
Brown's name was familiar to
some locals who remember a far
reaching FBI investigation in the
19905, during which his then-wife,
Donna Brown, and dozens of other
equestrians were accused of partici
pating in schemes to kill show hors
es in order to collect insurance
money.
Buddy and Donna Brown later
divorced, and he was never charged
during the decade or more that the
plots made headlines. He added that
he was never questioned by the FBI
or accused "by anybody" of being
involved.
"It really was never who I am,"
Brown told The Daily. "People who
know me know I would never be
involved in anything like that."
To the contrary, he said, "I would
like in my own way to pass some of
[my career experience] on not only
for the education of people but the
welfare and the good of the horses."
Meanwhile, students on the
Stanford equestrian team echoed
the excitement of their coach,
Vanessa Bartsch, and Athletics offi
cials.
"This change will definitely ben
efit the equestrian team," wrote
Jane Sunde 'O9, co-president of the
equestrian team, in an e-mail to The
Daily. "It is a huge opportunity to
both improve the quality of services
offered to students who want to
bring their horses to Stanford and
the diversity of instruction available
to the team on a regular basis."
While the students played no
active role in the decision-making
process, Sunde stated that the team
had been hoping for a new trainer
for some time.
"This very active and competi
tive group of students has been
voicing to the [Red Barn] Advisory
Board their hope that a Stanford
could find a trainer in residence
able to provide high level training
and grooming services," she added.
Bartsch detailed in an e-mail to
The Daily what Brown's arrival
means to the program.
When the University resumed
management of the barn in 2004,
she said, officials promised "that if
the Red Barn was allowed to be a
home for students, student-based
programs would flourish." Since
then, she said, student interest
surged and with it came the need for
"access to professionals at the top of
the sport, stalls for horses and time
in the arenas."
"Several" Stanford equestrians,
she said, have Olympic potential.
According to Bartsch, the Red
Barn Advisory Board determined
that the barn wasn't big enough for
both Hey and Brown, which is still
proving to be a sore spot for some.
In the Oct. 21 announcement.
Athletics officials wrote that
"Stanford, Stanford Athletics and
the Red Barn have profound
respect for Nancy, her many years at
Stanford and her commitment to
the children of the area ... this was
a difficult decision."
Still, Hey said, "I don't know why
[I was asked to leave]... what they
said was that they wanted to make
room for another trainer and I think
they maybe had another vision that
didn't include my kind of program."
"It was a complete shock, a com
plete surprise," she added.
She has a new location, however,
and said she will continue to run the
business she started with only one
horse and one pony. Seven minutes
away, a Rancho Viejo stable off
Alpine Road will house the 25 hors
es belonging to Hey and her clients
beginning Nov. 30.
Still, she will miss the Red Barn
and the 38 years of accumulated
memories.
"I've spent more than half my
life at Stanford Red Barn and it's
very sad to me not to be there
everyday, five to six days a week
during that time," she said.
"I'm leaving where my children
grew up and where I've had so
much history," she added.
