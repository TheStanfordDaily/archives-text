## Compostable foodware? Not so fast, some say 
### ADAM COLE 
Students and administrators are raising doubts
about the effectiveness of compostable silverware in
reducing campus waste in advance of an ASSU
Executive push to increase its use.
Out at Newby Island Organics Compost Facility,
microbes are hard at work on Stanford's com
postable waste. In long compost piles called
"windrows," the microbes chew away at materials that
include the grass clippings from campus lawns and the
spinach leaves from that salad you couldn't finish.
More and more frequently, compostable cutlery, dishes
and bags are showing up in these piles.
ASSU President David Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO has
said University administrators hope to replace service
ware at Tresidder Union and Old Union with com
postable alternatives by winter quarter, but doubts
remain among administrators and even among student
leaders.
Julie Muir, the manager of Peninsula Sanitary
Service, Inc. (PSSI), which handles Stanford's waste,
agrees wholeheartedly with the University's zero
waste goal, but wonders if compostable dishware is the
right way to achieve it. She said she wonders whether
compostable serviceware creates more problems than
it solves.
ASSU Green Store Manager Susan Choi 'l2 also
said the store has been "wary" of offering compostable
products.
"We haven't really figured out away to ensure that
students dispose of compostables properly," Choi
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily, because even when
bins are provided, they are easily contaminated with
non-compostable items.
Lauren Kubiak 'lO, who journeyed around the
country this summer investigating food waste, said
many restaurants she visited "had [disposable] cutlery
and cups, but they didn't have a compost bin." If com
postable products are used without easy access to a
compost receptacle, she said, they are thrown away.
Then there's the challenge of a successful compost

process, as Muir and others explained.
Compost from campus, including Tresidder, is driv
en to the Newby Island Organics Compost Facility.
There, large contaminants, like bags of garbage, are
removed by workers, and the rest is sent through a
chipper and then piled into the windrows. The compost
matures and then is sold back to the University, or to
local landscapers and gardeners.
Remaining waste in the compost is removed by a
machine called a trummel screen, then sent to a land
fill.
At the nearby Sonoma Compost Company, a more
rigorous sorting process takes place before compost
piles are formed. Owner Alan Siegle said their organic
certification forbids the inclusion of most biocom
postable products. The compost must be sorted by
hand.
According to Will Bakx, co-owner and soil scientist,
even if biocompostables were allowed, they would be
impossible to sort because they are nearly indistin
guishable from plastic.
Biocompostibles are carefully designed to seem
very similar to the disposable silverware most con
sumers are used to. Kimberly Pointer, marketing man
ager for World Centric, a Palo Alto-based company
that sells biocompostables, says their major selling
point is that they are made from corn and wheat straw,
not fossil fuels.
Despite their agricultural origins, some compostable
cutlery sold by World Centric can withstand tempera
tures of up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
"We want them to be both durable and renewable,"
Pointer said.
This durability can make compostables difficult to
degrade. World Centric's Web site estimates that it may
take six months in a commercial facility for these prod
ucts to be processed, and up to two years in a backyard
pile.
That's too long, Bakx said, as his piles only develop
for 10 to 14 weeks.
Muir said that even at Newby Island, where
windrows decompose for six months, some utensils

might remain.
"Composting is a science, but it's also a natural
process," she said. "If a fork ends up in the middle of
the windrow, it will decompose. But what happens to
the fork that's only an inch under the surface? It

might not."
Muir estimated that only a small fraction of Newby
Island's compost is removed through this process
two percent by weight or 10 percent by volume and
only a portion of this is made up of biocompostables.
Still, she finds compostables a less desirable option
than recyclable or reusable cutlery.
Siegle agrees that one-use products are inherently
wasteful.
"It's misleading to think that switching from one
non-reusable bag to another throw-away product [will
help]," he said.
Bakx added that compostable and biodegradable
products might have value, if only "to increase organic
diversion out of the waste stream."
He explained that having large compostable bags
might make it easier for people to manage their food
waste.
Meanwhile, back at Stanford, some are taking the
compostable question into their own hands.
After returning from her cross-country food-waste
investigation, Kubiak decided to test the compostabili
ty of several "compostable" products in a garden com
post pile. Working with Stanford Farm Educator Sarah
Wiederkehr, Kubiak placed a biodegradable plastic
bag, cup, fork, knife and paper cup in one of the
Stanford Community Farm's compost piles. They plan
to check the pile periodically in the coming months, but
both women are sure they'll find everything just as it
was.
"The utensils are the ones I am most suspicious of,"
Wiederkehr said. "Those things never break down."
Wiederkehr said she has picked out intact forks by
hand from her compost pile in the past.
For now, Muir said that contained anaerobic com
posting units may be better at processing compostables
in the future because their conditions are more easily
controlled than outdoor windrows.
Until then, not every compostable knife and spoon
can end up in someone's flowerbed.
