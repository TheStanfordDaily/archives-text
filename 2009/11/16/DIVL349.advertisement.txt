Sir Geoffrey Lloyd will review recent developments in the study of
science, medicine and religion in ancient Greece, China and
Mesopotamia. Focusing on the social and intellectual institutions

understanding the past is an exercise in understanding others and
that nothing could be more vital in the world we live in today.
