## Students crack Microsoft puzzles 
### TYLER BROWN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford was one of 20 locations for this weekend's
Microsoft College Puzzle Challenge (CPC), a 12-hour
logic competition in the United States and Canada spon
sored by the recruiting department of Microsoft
Corporation.
At 9 a.m. sharp on Saturday morning, 22 four-person
teams made up of current students and recent alumni
scattered themselves throughout the rooms in Packard
101 to crack puzzles until the deadline 12 hours later.
Participants were not just competing with other teams
at Stanford CPC organizer Alex Selig 'OB M.S. 'OB said
the overall competition included 536 teams based at a
number of North American universities.
The highest-scoring Stanford team, "Carbuncle
Recoloration and Novella Enthusiast Assn.," placed sec
ond overall in the national challenge.
Teams were given 36 puzzles over the course of the
day, most of which were in paper booklets handed out to
participants.
But not all puzzles were as orthodox. One problem
was on the back of the T-shirt handed out at the event
and two more were "live puzzles" which required partic

ipants to respond to cue cards presented by organizers to
find the information necessary to solve the puzzle.
The final "meta-puzzle," which played a huge factor in
selecting the winning groups, was not explicit and
required clues from the answers to other puzzles to
solve.
Teams submitted answers over the Internet to
"Puzzle Central," where scores were tallied. In addition,
participants could electronically submit clarification
questions to a group of roughly 40 people at Microsoft
who were familiar with the puzzles.
The competition was targeted toward science and
engineering students, but CPC organizer Forum Parmar
'O7 M.S. 'O7 said that such a background was not
absolutely necessary.
"[The puzzles] are kind of technical sometimes ...
but if you can Google it, you can do it," she said.
CPC administrators did not comment directly on
whether or not Microsoft uses the event as a proactive
recruiting exercise, but did admit that winning an award
is an excellent resume boost for prospective Microsoft
employees.
"[lf participants win a prize] they'll definitely be in
