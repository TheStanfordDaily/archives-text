The political discourse in American cul
ture over the last few months has shed
light on one indisputable fact: the ex
treme right in this country has been blessed with
remarkably powerful vocal cords. Glenn Beck,
Rush Limbaugh and the Tea Party Express have
thrust themselves into the middle of seemingly
every conversation and commandeered the
voice of the Republican Party. The result has
been a lot of anger and a lot of shouting.
With this relentless push of harsh negativity,
frustration has mounted on the left. Shouting
tends to breed more shouting, and in this case it
has brought widespread exasperation and occa
sionally acerbic backlash. When the radical right
seems to have adopted Limbaugh's sentiment
—"I hope [Obama] fails" —as its political
strategy, cooperation seems hopeless. The loud
est voices are not interested in constructive con
versation, and thus the conversation has largely
come to a halt.

plan proposed by House Republicans contains
clear overlaps with Democratic visions. For ex
ample, the Republican plan would provide tax
credits to low- and middle-income Americans to
help them buy health insurance an idea not
too different from the subsidies included in the
Democratic plan. Even if the details differ, this
fact ought to have been trumpeted for its com
monality of purpose. Instead, it has been over
looked in favor of the prevailing storyline of in
tractable disagreement.
Elsewhere in national politics, several Re
publican leaders have shown initiative in tack
ling climate change. Governors Jon Huntsman
of Utah and Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota have
joined California's Arnold Schwarzenegger in
committing their states to aggressive green
house gas reductions. And while Congressional
Republicans have largely been steadfastly op
posed to cap-and-trade legislation, South Car
olina Senator Lindsey Graham recently
bucked this trend by joining John Kerry in the
call for climate legislation. The appeal from
Senator Graham has been strong and un
abashed, despite his party's predominant
stance. Graham's departure from the main
stream earned him an official censure from the
Republican Party of South Carolina and dis
played the kind of moxie that ought to be ap
plauded.
Yet, the voices of moderates like Senator
Graham are, for the most part, lost in the collec
tive buzz of American politics. The loudest and
most virulent voices in the mix are, time and
time again, the pundits and commentators of
Fox News. This phenomenon exists because we
feed into it. Railing against the latest absurdi
ties of Glenn Beck is the easy way out for liber
als. Even President Obama has fallen into this
trap, regularly deriding Fox News while largely
failing to capitalize on the efforts of Senator
Graham to coax Republicans into joining the
fight against climate change.
Directing our attention to the loudest voic
es on TV just because they incite controversy
has set off a vicious cycle in American politics.
These loud voices have created the largest sway
of public opinion, which has moved candidates
in that direction and pulled the Republican
Party even further right. Polls show decreasing
numbers of Republicans concerned about
global warming while more and more fear
Obama's "socialism," indicating the dangerous
direction in which the party is headed. Democ
rats, with their congressional majorities, cannot
rely on conservatives without help from the
moderate right. Republicans will find electoral
success sooner or later. And, when that day
comes, the Editorial Board would rather it not
bring forth the Palin Administration.

But as the conservative opposition veers to
ward the extreme, the need grows, more than
ever, for liberal Democrats to reach across the po
litical spectrum and engage with voices of reason.
The American left must fight with all its might
against the temptation to get discouraged from bi
partisanship. One party will never hold enough
political power to make things happen by them
selves, and delusions to this end will make that
power disappear. Democrats must find those Re
publicans willing to compromise, seek them out
and work together to make progress. This must
happen in red states and blue states, in cities and
towns, and right here at Stanford.
The politics of extremism has obscured the
fact that most of conservative America does not
view the Obama Administration as a socialistic
apocalypse. There are people on the right trying
to compromise, people trying to do good things,
and it is imperative that they not get lost in the
shuffle.

The healthcare debate put on by the Stanford
Political Union provided a good example of this
phenomenon. Two of the speakers on the con
servative side took views so radically opposed to
government that they later admitted seeing pub
licly-funded fire departments as a bad idea. In
the midst of their powerful rhetorical flourishes
and the controversy they provoked, it was easy
to miss the appealing ideas of the third speaker,
who simply thought universal healthcare could
be more economically achieved by methods be
sides a public option. His ideas held clear merit
and deserve serious scrutiny perhaps work
ing well in tandem with existing Democratic
ideas but one would never know from the
emotional lather that evolved in response to his
radical predecessors.
Similarly, in the U.S. Congress, the healthcare
