# GIRL, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## How to Kill a Pirate 
### Jordan Carr 
Congratulations to East Germany for 20
years of freedom. The traditional gift
for a 20th anniversary is china, so per
haps a chunk of the Great Wall would be ap
propriate, especially since the Germans still
haven't gotten around to fixing their own
wall, 20 years later German unions are no
toriously powerful. While the Germans have
made questionable choices embracing
David Hasselhoff so enthusiastically they
have dealt with freedom quite ably. Freedom
demands responsibility, so I want to focus
here on an egregiously irresponsible use of
freedom: file pirating.
I could tell you how file pirates work, but it
seems pointless. Everyone knows that if you
wanted to, you could just go on Google, look
up the artist name, their latest CD and anoth
er word that would guide you to a file sharing
Web site (e.g. "Girl, You Know It's True by
Milli Vanilli + mediafire"). Everyone knows
that if you were going to do that, you should
go to unrarx.com to download Un√üarX so
that you can open the .rar files that pirated
CDs often come in. Everyone knows that you
could also use the uTorrent program from
utorrent.com and download .torrent files
from sites such as The Pirate Bay or De
monoid, or download a file sharing program
such as Lime Wire, Kazaa or Morpheus.
Everyone knows that if you want to steal
any television show, you can just go to freeon
lineepisodes.net, click on the "TV Shows"
link at the top and then browse by show, sea
son and episode. Everyone knows that if you
want to steal movies, you can go to nin
javideo.net and then either search for or click
on a link to whatever movie you want to
watch.
And, of course, everyone knows that the

ResComp Web site reveals that while Stan
ford students have received Digital Millenni
um Copyright Act (DMCA) complaints and
pre-litigation letters intended to trick the
accused of revealing their identity (which
would otherwise require the complainant to
subpoena Stanford University) and force a
settlement none had actually been
charged with anything or sued.
Everyone knows all this, yet file pirating is
confined only to the most savage individuals;
i.e. You Tube commenters. Hedonists argue
that black markets such as the file stealing
one expose policy that is inconsistent with re
ality. They point to drug dealers and pimps
and say that if only we legalized things that
people are doing illegally crime would plum
met. Pshaw! If I wanted to live in Sodom, I
could move to Italy; in America we have
morals.
This means that when there is an over
whelming demand for something evil (e.g. co
caine, premarital sex, Harry Potter), we do
not meagerly try to make those things less
dangerous; we eliminate them completely
through the entirely successful War on Drugs,
abstinence-only education and book burning.
Anything less would be letting the terrorists
win. A war on piracy is in order. We need to
stop at nothing less than ending all illegal
downloading, no matter the cost.
Despite the morals of the American peo
ple, record companies are in trouble. Consid
ering that record companies do not, you
know, actually do anything useful, it makes
sense that they sue thieving 12-year-olds.
Record companies do not produce content;
they do not put on concerts. Their primary
function is to pay radio stations to play "It's
Too Late to Pologize" and whatever godawful

mess the Black Eyed Peas have just created
"I Gotta Feeling" popping up on the radio
was almost certainly the result of a Trading
Places-style bet between two rich guys over
whether or not they could convince people
that it was a good song.
Without the record industry, who will make
CDs? It's easier to drive to a store and pay $l2
rather than paying $1 for blank CDs (avail
able at Meyer), then burning them at home.
As an aside, CDs and DVDs are often used as
"loss leaders," meaning they are intended to
lure you into the store at a loss to the seller. So,
unless you buy a 64" plasma TV as well, you're
responsible for every giant plug-shaped shell
that used to be a Circuit City.
My proposal is one that has been floated
regarding the floundering newspaper indus
try, and to a lesser extent the floundering porn
magazine industry: bailout! Have you ever
been bailed out of a situation and not felt
great about it? Don't you feel good when
someone says, "Man, you really bailed me out
there"? Yes, in fact you do. And that feeling
can be yours again for a fraction of whatever
it cost to bail out those chumps in Detroit. I
mean, cars, what were they thinking? Nobody
wants those; they create so much pollution.
That's why I only travel by rickshaw. CDs, on
the other hand, are forever.
