# THE 						DUDE ABIDES
## "Strikes and Gutters, Ups and Down" 
### Zack Warma 
Whereas last week I had a few neces
sary mea culpas to declare, this is a
week for giving thanks. First, I am so
deeply appreciative of the wonderful individ
uals who made my birthday week nothing
short of remarkable. Also, bless you Arizona
for finding away to choke wonderfully Satur
day night against Cal. And to the love of my
life, USC seeing that you were systemati
cally torn apart by Toby "Silicon Valley Jesus"
Gerhart and Co. wow, I don't actually
know what to say. Other than while you are
down in SD for the Poinsettia Bowl, I would
be delighted to give good restaurant sugges
tions.

Earlier today, I sat freezing my sandal
wearing tuches off in front of Memorial
Church, selling tickets for a Music Depart
ment show (who knew organ concerts be
came more popular in a shitty economy?).
Outside the refrain of "senior discount,
please," the most frequent occurrence of the
afternoon was scores of confused tourists try
ing to enter the Church while the perform
ance was transpiring. Nearly all failed to
grasp the fact that Jane's stain-glassed gem is
not simply a gaudy monument to dead Lath
rops (and the Masons), but rather a vibrant
venue for discussions, services ... and organ
music. Perhaps scratch the "vibrant."
I wish I could tell you this is the first time I
have seen this sort of incident occur, whereby
a treasured aspect of campus is relegated to a
brief "wow" and a few shoddy photographs.
But we all know that is not the case. The sight
of faces lighting up as the arcades are tra
versed is beyond commonplace. When biking
to and from class, it is damn easy to be get lost
in the expansive beauty of the Quad, to feel
almost as if you are ensconced in some pala
tial (and organ-music playing) estate, re
moved from reality and the present day.
Two "Dude Abides" back, I babbled on
about the Stanford obsession with "progress"
and "innovation." While I still stand by my re
marks, there is a secondary level on which the
Farm's propaganda ministers operate. The
emphasis on freshness, entrepreneurialism
and damn sexy new buildings is brilliantly
coupled with sweeping panoramas of the
Oval, Palm Drive and Quad images that

convey a majestic sense of timelessness and
constancy.
While this is all well and good for tour
guides and pamphlets (and organ music?), I
still simply cannot abide. Unquestionably ac
cepting, consciously or otherwise, a binary
distinction between constant change and
palm-lined stasis largely misses the point of
the school. Why I have unequivocally fallen in
love with Stan is the fluidity and dynamism
that has enveloped this place long before I
got here, and that will be here long after I am
gone.
Any of you ever had class in Encina Hall?
That was a men's dormitory, the one where

Hewlett and Packard met. No big deal. The
snake sculpture dug into the ground in front
of Cantor? It's made of sandstone piled up by
the Farm from previous buildings. Ever gone
jogging down Salvatierra Street in the Facul
ty Ghetto and notice houses that have a cer
tain Greek flavor to them? In the early days
of the University, frats lined the road.
On the topic of Greeks, and why I have
been thinking on this topic recently: as of
three weeks ago, I am now working within the
University Archives. My current project is
archiving the newly acquired records of
Sigma Chi. Yes, our very own Sigma Chi,
Alpha Omega Chapter, founded right after
the opening of the school and located in its
current location since 1936.
Why the hell does any of this matter for
the 99.9 percent of us who aren't Sigma Chi
members? Well, in 1965, the very fraternity
recently lampooned by the Flipside as the lo
cation for the "White Male Community Cen
ter" and seen re-enacting the battle of Iwo
Jima in the Intersection of Death, was actual
ly taking a national stand for civil rights. That
year, the national organization of Sigma Chi
suspended the Stanford chapter for pledging
a black student. Buoyed by support from
alums, University President Sterling, Gover
nor Brown (here's to us getting another one
in a year!) and Stanford EX alum Lee Met
calf, U.S. Senator, the house deactivated for
five years to protest the archaic and discrimi
natory strains within the National Sigma Chi
organization.
When I found this story buried in dusty
folders and correspondence, I was forced to
entirely reshape my conception of an organi
zation that I largely judged off its "Let's Get
Physical" party two years ago. But the more I
read, both about Sigma Chi and the eras of
Stanford student life, I was presented with ir
refutable evidence that just because we act
like we "know" this place after three years of
tromping about, Stanford will always be more
interesting and dynamic than we ever know.
But there will always be organ music. And
USC will always suck.

Zach, though now older, is still an idiot. Agree
with him at zwarma@stanford.edu.
