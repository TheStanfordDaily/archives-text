## Art and art history Prof. Wanda Corn honored at two-day symposium 
### VIVIANA ARCIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Department of Art and Art History
recognized the achievements of art history
Prof, emeritus Wanda Corn this weekend at a
symposium titled "Great American Thing."
The former director of both the Stanford
Humanities Center and the Cantor Arts
Center was honored by a variety of col
leagues and former students at the two-day
event.
Corn, a professor since 1980, became one
of the leading scholars of American art histo
ry, a discipline which, until her contributions,
was considered obscure and primitive com
pared to that of European art.
"The field was nonexistent, even a laugh
ing stock," said UC-Irvine Prof. Cecile

Whiting, a former student of Corn. "The field
had no significant faculty or fellowships."
Corn instead encouraged the discipline
and spent years building the Stanford Art
and Art History Department by seeking
financial contributors and supporting gradu
ate student fellowships.
"She has encouraged her students to find
their own voices," Whiting said. "In doing so
she has opened our eyes to American art."
The event, which began Friday afternoon
and ended Saturday evening with Corn's
presentation and speech, delved into not only
Corn's achievements and legacy at Stanford,
but in a variety of art disciplines.
Both colleagues and students joined the
symposium as presenters and guests, with
each retelling Corn's influence on their aca
demic trajectory.

"Wanda's scholarship has served as a
model in the field of American art history,"
said art history Ph.D. candidate Annelise
Madsen. "At Stanford, Wanda has been a
generous, spirited and accessible teacher."
Corn's presentation was preceded by
Whiting and fellow former student Ellen
Todd Ph.D. 'B7, who both discussed Corn's
influence and mentorship.
"Most of us know her as Wanda," Todd
said. "She became a friend and mentor, tak
ing me under her wing."
Both spoke of Wanda as not only a profes
sional mentor but as a close friend, and
enlarged personal pictures of them with Corn
adorned the large projector screen through
out their presentation.
"Here we are getting ready to run a race,"
Todd said as she showed a picture to the audi

ence of her and Corn at a marathon race in
the 19705. "We also spent the day discussing
my dissertation."
The event culminated with Corn's presen
tation, which was separated into two parts: a
reading of her upcoming book "Mary and
Me: Modern Woman, Modern Women" and a
more personal summary of her life both in
and outside of the classroom.
"I've had more than my 15 minutes these
past two days," Corn said.
The second half of Corn's presentation
took on a more personal note as she shared
stories of her mother and father's influence
on her life, particularly her father's love for
photography and images.
"His love of images informed my pleas
ures with photography," Corn said.
Corn also emphasized issues of gender,

stating that she never once thought she
would end up at the head of a college depart
ment because she had seen so few women
accomplish such a feat when she was growing
up.
"It never occurred to me that I would
obtain a Ph.D. and teach at the university
level," Corn said.
And while her passion for American art
led her from professorships at small colleges
to leading scholar status in American art,
Corn remains humble. She added that not
once did she take for granted the relation
ships she cultivated throughout her career.
"It's not my work, it's our work we've
been celebrating for the past 48 hours," Corn
said.
