## County drops charges against three Cal fans Stanford issues stayaway letters for tree incident 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The Alameda County District
Attorney's office has declined to
pursue charges against three men
arrested in September outside a
Stanford-UC-Berkeley volleyball
game.
Stanford, however, has barred at
least one person from campus in
connection with the incident, which
took place Sept. 25 outside
Berkeley's Haas Pavilion amid a
post-game performance by the
Stanford band.
Eyewitnesses from that night said
Cal fans stole leaves from the cos
tume of the band's tree mascot
before fleeing.
Will Allanson, 24, a Cal senior;
Erick Karlen, 23, a 2007 Cal gradu
ate; and Derrick Gillan, 22, were
arrested just after the scuffle. They
and many other Cal fans were
reportedly dressed as lumberjacks.
Allanson was arrested for battery,
resisting arrest and possession of a
locking blade knife longer than 2.5
inches. Gillan and Karlen were arrest
ed for battery and excluded from
Berkeley's campus for seven days.

The three men maintained that
they were not involved in the leaf
grab, but were simply bystanders
who were improperly arrested.

The Alameda District Attorney's
office eventually agreed, dropping
the charges on Oct. 27, but not
before Stanford's lawyers sent
Karlen a letter barring him from this
campus, including for sporting
events.
Allanson and Gillan said they did
not receive stayaway letters. Lauren
Schoenthaler of Stanford's general
counsel office indicated, however,
that more than one person did
receive stayaway orders.
"The letters were issued to indi
viduals the university identified as
having participated in efforts to take
parts of the Stanford tree costume
and/or individuals interfering in
efforts by Stanford staff and band
members to protect the tree,"
Schoenthaler wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
She added that the University
reconsiders bans at the request of a
recipient "after some time has
passed," generally around two years
later.
Karlen said he was "dismayed" to
receive the letter and has asked
Senior Assistant to the President
Jeffrey Wachtel to reconsider it now.
"Stanford is a university that
exercises influence in the world
hosting events and seminars I would
like the privilege of attending
throughout my professional life,"
Karlen told Wachtel in an e-mail
shared with The Daily.
Schoenthaler declined to com
ment on the status of Karlen's
appeal.
