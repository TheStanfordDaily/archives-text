## A
						VIEW FROM THE TOP Card goes to Sweet 16 after weekend wins 
### NATE ADAMS SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITORS 
The Cardinal, after being named the na
tion's top overall seed last Monday, ultimately
lived up to its billing last weekend as it hosted
the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament.
Despite being severely tested by both North
ern Arizona (10-9-2) and Brigham Young Uni
versity (18-4-2), Stanford prevailed with a pair
of hard-fought 2-0 wins and advanced to the
Sweet 16. Junior forward Christen Press led the
Cardinal in scoring with three goals over the

weekend, while senior Kelley O'Hara posted
four assists.
On a chilly Thursday night, the Cardinal
(22-0) took a little while to get warm against
NAU through the first 14 minutes, the
teams had three shots apiece, with sophomore
Lindsay Taylor accounting for all of Stanford's
three.
"I thought at the beginning of the game we
were a little nervous, a little tight," said Stan
ford Head Coach Paul Ratcliffe. "I prefer to
see us enjoying it out there a little more, to be a
little more loose than we were."
The Card attack soon began to heat up,
however, with O'Hara, Press and freshman
Courtney Verloo also forcing fine saves from
Lumberjacks goalkeeper Tori Rocke.
In the final 10 minutes of the half, Stanford
began to get even closer. Substitute sopho
more Teresa Noyola made an immediate im
pact, curling a shot over the goalkeeper only to
see it bounce back off the crossbar. A minute
later, O'Hara hit the post with a low shot and
Noyola struck the woodwork once again on a
free kick, denying her the opening goal. Final
ly, junior forward Morgan Redman hit the bar
with a header from a corner kick with just 10
seconds left in the half no matter what, the
ball just would not cross the goal line.
"I think that was definitely their game plan,
to keep everyone behind the ball and force us
away from crashing [the net]," Noyola com
mented on NAU's stubborn defense. "I think
we got a little unlucky and you can only hit the
post so many times."
The breakthrough ultimately arrived in the

55th minute. O'Hara fed the ball to Press at the
top of the box and the junior who rarely
shoots with her weaker left foot turned and
curled a beautiful left-footed shot into the top
corner to give Stanford the lead.
"I think the first goal just came about with
our composure we had a lot of great oppor
tunities," Press said. "I [was thinking] 'you need
to line up your shot, don't blast it, take your
time,' and so that was really on my mind the
whole half."

Northern Arizona was still fighting hard,
but the Lumberjacks were effectively knocked
out 12 minutes later, again by the O'Hara-
Press combination. O'Hara crossed low from
the left and Press had her shot blocked from
close range, but the ball came right back to
O'Hara. The senior tried her luck again, cross
ing high instead of low, and this time Press
buried a low header to the near post. That was
all the offense that Stanford would need and
the match ended 2-0.

"Overall, it was a good performance and a
good start to the playoffs for us," Ratcliffe said.

"l thought Northern Arizona played well and I
give them a lot of credit they were getting in
front of the ball and their goalie was making
great saves and it took two really good goals to
come away with this big victory."
In the second round on Saturday, the Cardi
nal took on BYU, who had defeated UC-Santa
Barbara 2-0 on Thursday afternoon. Unlike
the match against NAU, Stanford got off to a
dream start in fact, the team scored the
quickest goal in school history. The Card
charged forward right from the opening kick
off with Press sending a ball to O'Hara, who
was flying down the right side. O'Hara
streaked forward and sent in a hard cross that
took a deflection off a BYU player and found
its way to Press in the middle. The junior slot
ted it in under the keeper's legs from close
range and, just like that, it was 1-0. Twenty
three seconds had elapsed.
"It happened so fast that we didn't know
what hit us," said BYU Coach Jennifer Rock
wood.
The tone was set for a blowout, but that was

far from the case instead of being demoral
ized by the quick goal, the Cougars played ag
gressively and physically, and came within
inches of an equalizer in the 30th minute. BYU
freshman Carlee Payne struck a shot from out
side the box that beat Cardinal junior keeper
Kira Maker, but the ball rattled off the crossbar
and sophomore Jennie Marshall's follow-up
header was high.
"I was very impressed with BYU and how
they countered that [early goal]," Ratcliffe
said. "Most teams drop a little bit when they
concede a goal that early and I give them cred
it for fighting hard and having a really good
mentality about it. I was impressed."
Stanford came close before the end of the
half as well Press saw a goal-bound shot de
flected just wide and senior Kristin Stannard
nearly tapped in a loose ball in the box, but the
half would end 1-0. Surprisingly, the Cougars
were outshooting the Card at that point, 7-6.
