### CHRIS JUHNKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
is hitting its stride at the perfect time, just as
the regular season winds down and the
NCAA tournament looms in the near fu
ture. The Cardinal swept both No. 16 Ore
gon (16-7, 6-7 Pacific-10 Conference) and
Oregon State (12-14,3-11) this weekend at
home, bringing its streak of straight-set
wins to three and conference record to an
impressive 11-4, good enough for a first
place tie with Washington and UCLA.
"Both matches this weekend helped
our team build even more confidence
nearing the end of the regular season and
closing on the playoffs," said freshman set
ter Karissa Cook.
Junior Cassidy Lichtman led the way
for the Card recording 16 kills, 14 assists
and seven digs on the way to a 25-23,25-16,
25-23 victory for Stanford against Oregon
Friday night. The double-double was
Lichtman's 17th of the season. She re
ceived solid help from junior Alix Kline
man and senior Janet Okogbaa, who con
tributed 14 kills with 10 digs and 11 kills
with three blocks, respectively. The match
started out in a deadlock, as the teams trad-

Senior Janet Okogbaa contributed 11 and nine kills, respectively, in Stanford's wins over Oregon and Oregon State. Strong showings by juniors Cassidy Lichtman and Alix Klineman also helped the Card edge its northern opponents and bring the team's conference record to 11-4 (tied for best in the Pac-10).
Ed points and opened in an 8-8 tie, be
fore Stanford jumped out first with a
4-0 run. After a run by Oregon cut
the Cardinal lead to 14-13, a Kline
man kill put Stanford up by two, a
lead which it never relinquished, as it
won the first set, 25-23.
The Card carried its momentum
from the first set into the second,
jumping out to a 5-1 lead and forcing
Oregon to call a quick time out. The
Ducks came back with a 4-1 run, but
Stanford responded with a kill by
sophomore Stephanie Browne and a
block and kill by Okogbaa to put the
Card up 17-11. A balanced offensive
attack helped the Card close out the
set, 25-16, with seven different play
ers contributing kills.
In the third set, the Cardinal
found itself down early, before two
kills by Klineman tied it up 7-7. Fol
lowing a 3-1 run by Stanford, Oregon
bounced back to take the lead, 15-16,
but it wouldn't last. Lichtman
smashed a kill and Okogbaa pound
ed two straight of her own to give
Stanford the set and the sweep.
"Getting revenge against the
Ducks was especially sweet for our
team since we all remembered how
the loss to them earlier this year felt,"
Cook said, referring to the five-set
loss in Eugene earlier this year. "I
think one of the major keys this
weekend was getting everyone in
volved our entire team con
tributed to our success."

On Saturday, Stanford continued
its dominance over Oregon State, a
team it has never lost to, with a 25-18,
25-18,25-19 sweep. Klineman led the
team with 13 kills and junior libero
Gabi Ailes contributed 15 digs in the
victory for the Card.
Stanford opened the first set
strong, with five different players get
ting kills, but with the score at eight
all, Oregon State went on a 4-1 run to
make it 9-12.The Card bounced back
with kills from redshirt freshman Jes
sica Walker and Browne and tied it at
12 all. Following some back and forth
play, the Card went on a 9-2 run, in
cluding kills by Klineman and senior
Alex Fisher, to win the set, 25-18.
The Card jumped out on top in
the second set against the Beavers,
using kills by Lichtman and Browne
to open up a 9-1 lead. Following a

service ace by sophomore Kather
ine Sebastian and a kill by Okog
baa, Stanford found itself up 15-2,
but Oregon State didn't give up eas
ily. The Beavers went on several
runs including a 6-0 to bring the
score to 22-14, but the Card was
able to hang on as kills by Lichtman
and Klineman gave Stanford the
set, 25-18.
In the third set, Stanford used two
kills by Klineman and a block by
Okogbaa to pull out to a 5-2 lead.
Using the momentum from its home
crowd, the Cardinal increased its
lead to 19-11 before a 4-1 OSU run
made it 20-15. Another 4-2 run by the
Beavers made it 22-19, but Stanford
would hold on to win the set, 25-19.
"Since our team, like every team
at this point in the season, is so beat
up, finishing games in straight sets
helps keep injuries down and spirits
up," Cook said. "This was a very good
weekend in that regard."
The wins this weekend, combined
with a Washington loss to Southern
California on Friday and a Washing
ton win over UCLA on Saturday,
puts Stanford in a three-way tie for
first place in the conference with an
11-4 record.
Next week, the Cardinal hopes to
continue its winning streak as it trav
els to Arizona to play the Arizona
Wildcats on Friday and the Arizona
State Sun Devils on Saturday.
