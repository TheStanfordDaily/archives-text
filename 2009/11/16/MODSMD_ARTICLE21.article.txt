# Too much swag in Harbaugh

/' Ml just honestly thought there
was an opportunity coming
off the ball, the way our
backs were running and the
way we were playing."
That was Jim Harbaugh's explana
tion as to why the Cardinal went for a
two-point conversion when leading 48-
21 over Southern California with just 6
minutes, 47 seconds left in the game.
And if you believe it, I've got a
bridge to sell you in Brooklyn.
You wanted to embarrass the Tro
jans, Jimmy. Admit it. What could be
better than hanging half-a-hundred at
the Coliseum against the Pacific-10's
perennial bully, USC?
Luckily for Harbaugh, Matt
Barkley (who has been proclaimed by
his coach, Pete Carroll, as the best quar
terback he has ever coached never
mind Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart or
Mark Sanchez) continued his pattern
of finding open Stanford defensive
players and threw his third interception
of the game. This subsequently set up
the Cardinal's eighth touchdown of the
game and cemented Saturday as the
worst defensive performance in USC
history.
What the two-point conversion re
ally symbolized, however, is Har
baugh's unbridled arrogance.
My feelings about Harbaugh's ele
vated confidence, to put it nicely, are
mixed. In case you need a reference, see
my Oct. 19 column. I still firmly believe
that Harbaugh's cockiness may have
cost Stanford a win at Arizona. I don't
want to get into the particulars, but if
the Cardinal won that game, it would
control its own Rose Bowl destiny
heading into Big Game.
That said, by going for two on Satur
day, Harbaugh wasn't putting his ego in
front of the team. He was trying to es
tablish Stanford as a bully and himself
as one of the nation's preeminent
coaches.
Sometimes it takes having a bit of a
swagger to reach that echelon.
Take Steve Spurrier, for example.
Sure, he has toiled in mediocrity at
South Carolina, but back when he was
at Florida in the late 90s, there was no
one with a bigger ego in the South East
ern Conference or feared more than
Spurrier.
It was Spurrier, after all, who made
comments like "you can't spell Citrus
without U-T" in response to rival Ten
nessee, led by Peyton Manning, chok
ing and going to the Citrus bowl instead
of the National Championship game.
Spurrier was subsequently in the head
of Tennessee Coach Phil Fullmer for
years and it looks as if Harbaugh is
similarly burrowing his way into Car
roll's brain.
Having that swagger is what makes
your program noticeable on a national
stage, which is what Harbaugh is trying
to do for Stanford football. It sounds
menial, but 50-21 looks a hell-of-a-lot
better to the casual east coast observer
than 49-21.
Moves like that that can help solidi
fy a legacy. Look at Les Miles at
Louisiana State: in 2007, en route to the
National Championship, Miles' Tigers
trailed Auburn 24-23 and had the ball
on Auburn's 22-yard line with less than
10 seconds remaining. Instead of kick
ing the field goal, Miles had his quarter
back throw the ball to the end zone,
where it was caught for a touchdown
with a second to play.
The clock easily could have run out
or if his kicker attempted the field
goal, he could have missed. Either way,
Miles showed a rare confidence in his
players and his team subsequently
rolled to a National title.
Stanford won't be playing for a Na
tional Championship this year, but a
Rose Bowl berth is very feasible (with
a little help from some friends) and
competing for a National title in years
to come doesn't seem out of the ques
tion assuming Harbaugh is still here.
As the San Jose Mercury News re
ported Saturday, Harbaugh's contract
extension is almost finalized. However,
coaches with his kind of confidence are
often coveted by lots of places, many of
which make recruiting far less difficult
than academically-inclined Stanford.
Harbaugh would seem to be a pop
ular candidate despite his disparag
ing comments about them two years
ago at his alma mater, the Universi
ty of Michigan, if the Wolverines decide
to fire the controversial and unsuccess
ful Rich Rodriguez.
Harbaugh's name will also un
