## Card starts season with East Coast sweep Ogwumike lights up Stanford scoring 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal women started their
season right last weekend, living up
to their preseason billing as the na
tion's No. 2 team with a pair of victo
ries on the East Coast. Stanford
began with a convincing 89-56 victo
ry over Old Dominion on Friday,
then headed north for a tough battle
with No. 25 Rutgers, ultimately de
feating the Scarlet Knights, 81-66.
Sophomore Nnemkadi Ogwumike
posted a team-best 46 points on the
weekend, while junior forward Kayla
Pederson added 36 of her own.
Opening night saw the Cardinal
(2-0) face off against Old Domin
ion's Lady Monarch's in Norfolk, Va.
Stanford was explosive out of the
gate, opening the contest by outscor
ing Old Dominion 29-4 in just over
six minutes. Senior Jayne Appel
an early front-runner for National
Player of the Year accounted for
seven of those points.
Point guard JJ Hones posted six
points of her own during that run
a great sign for the Cardinal. Hones,
a redshirt junior this season, missed
nearly all of last season with a torn
ACL. The Cardinal undoubtedly
missed her presence and if she con
tinues to perform well, she could be
an enormous difference-maker for
Stanford this season.
While the Lady Monarchs man
aged to counter Stanford's early out
burst with an 8-0 run of their own, the
Cardinal was quick to establish an all
but insurmountable lead soon after
ward. Pederson scored six points in
the midst of a 19-5 run, while Ogwu
mike scored seven of her own as the
Cardinal stretched the lead out to 48-
17.
"I just tried to do what I need to
do for my team," Ogwumike said of

her performance. "Whatever they
need me to do rebound, pass, any
thingâ€” I just do it."
While Stanford fans that are unfa
miliar with Old Dominion might
conclude from Friday's final score
that the Lady Monarchs are a
pushover, they are anything but. Old
Dominion's eventual 89-56 loss was
only its 16th in 108 games at its cur
rent home arena.
Stanford Head Coach Tara Van-
Derveer made it a point to schedule
tough nonconference games for the
Cardinal this season, including even
tual matchups with Duke, Tennesee
and defending champion Connecti
cut.
"I've really challenged our team
with our schedule," she said. "We
have really high expectations."
With Friday's healthy start to the
season secure, the Cardinal headed
to New Jersey to face No. 25 Rutgers
on Sunday afternoon. The Scarlet
Knights, losers at Maples Pavilion
last season, proved to be a stiff oppo
nent and matched Stanford shot-for
