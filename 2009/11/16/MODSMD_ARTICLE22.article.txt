## Card starts season with East Coast sweep Ogwumike lights up Stanford scoring 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal women started their
season right last weekend, living up
to their preseason billing as the na
tion's No. 2 team with a pair of victo
ries on the East Coast. Stanford
began with a convincing 89-56 victo
ry over Old Dominion on Friday,
then headed north for a tough battle
with No. 25 Rutgers, ultimately de
feating the Scarlet Knights, 81-66.
Sophomore Nnemkadi Ogwumike
posted a team-best 46 points on the
weekend, while junior forward Kayla
Pederson added 36 of her own.
Opening night saw the Cardinal
(2-0) face off against Old Domin
ion's Lady Monarch's in Norfolk, Va.
Stanford was explosive out of the
gate, opening the contest by outscor
ing Old Dominion 29-4 in just over
six minutes. Senior Jayne Appel
an early front-runner for National
Player of the Year accounted for
seven of those points.
Point guard JJ Hones posted six
points of her own during that run
a great sign for the Cardinal. Hones,
a redshirt junior this season, missed
nearly all of last season with a torn
ACL. The Cardinal undoubtedly
missed her presence and if she con
tinues to perform well, she could be
an enormous difference-maker for
Stanford this season.
While the Lady Monarchs man
aged to counter Stanford's early out
burst with an 8-0 run of their own, the
Cardinal was quick to establish an all
but insurmountable lead soon after
ward. Pederson scored six points in
the midst of a 19-5 run, while Ogwu
mike scored seven of her own as the
Cardinal stretched the lead out to 48-
17.
"I just tried to do what I need to
do for my team," Ogwumike said of

her performance. "Whatever they
need me to do rebound, pass, any
thingâ€” I just do it."
While Stanford fans that are unfa
miliar with Old Dominion might
conclude from Friday's final score
that the Lady Monarchs are a
pushover, they are anything but. Old
Dominion's eventual 89-56 loss was
only its 16th in 108 games at its cur
rent home arena.
Stanford Head Coach Tara Van-
Derveer made it a point to schedule
tough nonconference games for the
Cardinal this season, including even
tual matchups with Duke, Tennesee
and defending champion Connecti
cut.
"I've really challenged our team
with our schedule," she said. "We
have really high expectations."
With Friday's healthy start to the
season secure, the Cardinal headed
to New Jersey to face No. 25 Rutgers
on Sunday afternoon. The Scarlet
Knights, losers at Maples Pavilion
last season, proved to be a stiff oppo
nent and matched Stanford shot-for

GAME NOTES: Stanford sophomore Nnemka
di Ogwumike scored a combined 46 points
for the Cardinal in the team's two games
over the weekend. Old Dominion lost for
just the 16th time in 108 games played at its
current home arena. Stanford out-rebound
ed Rutgers by a whopping 50-33 margin.

shot to open the game.
After a pair of free throws from
senior guard Brittany Ray, Rutgers
was holding the game in a dead
heat at 22-22 with just under seven
minutes remaining in the first half.
Ray finished the game with a team
high 17 points.
It didn't take long for Stanford
to take over, however. Ogwumike
scored four points to begin a 15-0
run that also saw big contributions
from Hones, who sunk a pair of
three-pointers en route to a total of
15 points on the afternoon.
"She brings so much confidence
to our team," Pederson said, happy
to see Hones playing well. "She's
our rock and makes sure everyone
is composed and she did a great job
today."
While Stanford's 15-0 scoring
run led to a 10-point lead at half
time, the Cardinal was hardly able
to run away with the game. Ray led
a 14-1 outburst in the second half
with six points, pulling the Scarlet
Knights within 50-45. Appel, Og
wumike and junior guard Jeanette
Pohlen countered with six quick
points, however, as the Cardinal
went up by 11 and held on to win.
"This is a tough road trip and
I'm really proud of how our team
battled," VanDerveer said. "Rut
gers always has a great team, they
gave us an excellent game and we
will get better from playing them. I
thought Rutgers played very well. I
am proud of our team and how
many different people con
tributed."
As a team, Stanford out-re
bounded the Scarlet Knights by an
impressive 50-33 margin and stole
the ball six times. Rutgers had bet
ter accuracy from the field, shoot
ing 47.4 percent compared to the
Cardinal's 38 percent. Behind the
arc, however, Stanford dominated
at 34.6 percent to just 9.1 percent
for Rutgers.
Stanford next plays this Thurs
day, hosting Pepperdine in its home
opener at 7 p.m. Next up is UC-
Davis on Sunday the 22nd at 2 p.m.
Both games are at Maples Pavilion.
