## Palo Alto housing project approved City Council accepts project proposal in 7-2 vote despite neighborhood criticisms 
### CHRIS HART 
Palo Alto's seven-year journey to construct affordable,
high-density housing in the downtown area has taken a deci
sive turn after approval by the Palo Alto City Council.
The proposed four-story housing complex at 801 Alma
Street will consist of 50 units for very low-income families.
The project is a joint venture between the City of Palo Alto,
the nonprofit organizations Eden Housing Inc. and the
Community Housing Alliance (CHA).
The Council voted 7-2 in favor of the development
Monday night. The two dissenting members of the City
Council, Larry Klein and Pat Burt, though satisfied with the
general trajectory of the project, argued that it should be
brought before the City's Planning and Transportation
Committee before being given the Council's final stamp of
approval.
Supporting Council members responded by citing the
adequacy of the environmental impact report commissioned
by Eden Housing and carried out by the city's Architectural
Review Board.
The report, released in Sept. 2009, unanimously recom-
mended the project be approved by
the City Council, citing the project's
consistency with Palo Alto's urban
"Comprehensive Plan" and its com
patibility with the "immediate envi
ronment" surrounding the proposed
construction site.

At last Monday's City Council
meeting, however, Klein argued that
further study by the Planning and
Transportation Commission would
"only add to the credibility of the
project" and that the reluctance to
do so is reflective of supporters'
reservations regarding the likeli
hood of obtaining the commission's
approval.
But Pediatrics Prof. Don Barr,
also president of the CHA, advised
that any further delay would most
likely undermine the financial via
bility of the entire project.
Part of the funding for the devel
opment of the site is derived from
two $1 million state grants, but for
the two non-profits to be eligible for

the money, the housing develop
ment must be completed by
October 2011.
The four- to five-month delay
required for the commission's
analysis could render the entire
project fiscally unfeasible, Barr said.
The project has not escaped crit
icism, the brunt of which has come
from residents of a nearby condo
minium complex at 800 High Street,
which itself had to overcome signif
icant community opposition before
earning the city's approval in 2003.
The development's opposition,
which formed the group Neighbors
for Livable SOFA-2, had argued that
the project is too large for the down
town area and that there is not suffi
cient parking. Their criticism
prompted the developers to cut the
size of housing complex by half,
reducing the proposal from an initial
96 units for both seniors and low
income families to the current 50.

Joseph Mallon, co-chair of
Neighbors for a Livable SOFA-2
and resident of 800 High Street,
emphasized that his group supports
the addition of low-income housing
in the downtown area, just not in the
proposed form. He argued that were

the proposal brought before the
Planning and Transportation
Commission, further traffic mitiga
tion, density reduction and fiscal
responsibility would be requested.
"Projects take time and funding
opportunities come and go," Mallon
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. He
argued that the grant deadline was
used to precipitate a decision and
did not, in fact, amount to an end-all
condition for the eventual success of
the project.
On Monday night, however, the
collective City Council disagreed.
On voting to proceed with the
development. Major Peter
Drekmeier spoke of the city's
responsibility to provide affordable
housing for workers who have to
commute to Palo Alto because of
the area's high housing prices.
As to the residents of 800 High
Street, Mallon promised that,
despite logistical differences over
the projects particulars, the commu
nity would "welcome our new
neighbors and make them welcome
in Palo Alto."
