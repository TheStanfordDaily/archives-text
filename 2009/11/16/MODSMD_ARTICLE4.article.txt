Speaking through a translator, Ingrid
Inema 'll, the king said that Europeans
brought hate to a country that had
known peace and coexistence for most of
its history.
"The genocide was not brought by
Rwandans, it was brought by foreigners,"
Kigeli said, adding that the circumstances
of his exile told the same story.

The exiled King Kigeli V of Rwanda
came to Stanford Friday night with his
thoughts on his country's troubled histo
ry and its hopes for the future.
Kigeli V Ndahindurwa ruled as king
of Rwanda for two years, from 1959 to
1961. Kigeli, a member of the minority
Tutsi ethnic group, assumed the throne
after the death of his older brother.
But in 1961, the Belgian colonial gov
ernment and the Flutu ethnic majority
combined to take power in Rwanda
while Kigeli was out of the country on a
diplomatic mission.
Kigeli steadfastly refused, however, to
blame any of his countrymen for either
his exile or the 1994 Rwandan genocide,

"The genocide was not brought by
Rwandans; it was brought by foreigners."

Ed immediately by the king once he
took the microphone. Roberts how
ever, was diplomatic about it after the
event.
"There's never only one history,"
Roberts said, "and history is never
neutral. There's always a reason to
present things a certain way. There
are so many variants of the truth."
Kigeli's talk focused mostly on his
recollections of his story, rather than
the advertised discussion of a king's
potential role in Rwandan democra
cy. The king did stress his intense
desire to go back to Rwanda as a con
stitutional monarch, noting that the
Rwandan government must first sign
off on his return.
"When you know your country
and you cannot be in your country,"
Kigeli said through another transla
tor in an interview after his speech,
"you never have peace."
Kigeli remains involved in
Rwanda through his charitable
organization, the King Kigeli V
Foundation, which provides money
for education, medicine and other
support for orphans in Rwanda.
However, he is dissatisfied with the
amount of work he can do in the
country without greater financial
backing.
"I would love to get more income
for the foundation," Kigeli said after
the speech, "ft is not a strong, strong
foundation, so that's why I'm telling
more people about it."
The king mostly sidestepped ques
tions about Rwandan politics, saying
only that he was not in the country
and was not a politician, so he could
not comment.
The event was no disappointment
though, especially not for the approx
imate 100 people who attended late
on a Friday evening. Nana Kwadwo
Osei-Opare 'll, co-president of the
Stanford African Student
Association, said that King Kigeli's
talk fulfilled the group's goal in bring
ing him to the Farm.
"There are not that many exiled
kings around," Osei-Opare said. "We
thought it would be a very teachable
moment if he could come and say his
story and what happened and why he
was exiled."
