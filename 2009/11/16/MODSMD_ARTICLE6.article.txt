### KABIRS AWHNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday night, hun
dreds of Stanford stu
dents packed the side
walk in front of Maples
Pavilion to celebrate
Stanford's big win over No. 9
Southern California. In preparation
for the team's arrival, traffic was redi
rected from Campus Drive and Axe
Committee members organized the
crowd and transmitted updates on the
team's travel status. Earlier that day,
behind emphatic performances by
running back Toby Gerhart 'lO and
the Cardinal defense, Stanford had
dismantled USC by a final score of 55
to 21. The Stanford point total was the
most points ever given up by a USC

football team.
During the game, students filled
the skybox at Stanford Stadium to
watch the action on the skybox's TVs.
Fans started chants, cheered lustily
and did the wave as Stanford piled up
points on USC in the fourth quarter.
As the game ended and the fans
counted down the final seconds, a
number of students rushed onto the
field and spelled out "Toby" at the 50-
yard line before being chased off by
the groundskeepers.
Students started arriving at Maples
Pavilion for a rally to welcome the
team back to the Farm at 7:30 p.m.
They talked about their reactions to
Stanford's victory.

"I wouldn't call it so much of an
upset as the climax of what we've
been building up to," Daniel Jacobson

'l2 said. "We're really peaking at the
right time. It was great it's always
good to beat USC."
Some students were less measured
in their reactions. Hannah Varnell 'l3
exclaimed, "It was like Christmas,
Hanukkah and Kwanzaa all at the
same time!"
Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9, dean of
freshmen and undergraduate advis
ing, compared this year's victory to
Stanford's shocking upset of USC in
2007.
"In 2007 we were a 40-point under
dog going up against the number one
team in the nation and that victory
was an epic upset," she said.
"Yesterday, we were a bowl-contend
ing team who went into the game
expecting to win. So the surprise was
not that we beat them, but that we

crushed them. We continue to be writ
ten in USC's history books in ways
that make them cringe. Stanford foot
ball has arrived."
After the game, USC Head Coach
Pete Carroll had difficulty expressing
his feelings.
"I'm not sure I have the right
words to describe being humbled like
this," he said to a post-game press con
ference. "I don't really know where to
put it... We have fallen apart and
given our opponents the opportunity
to do whatever they want, but you
have to give Stanford a lot of credit."
Students talked about their experi
ence watching the game and their
emotions in the immediate aftermath
of the victory.
"I was freaking out. It was one of
the best games ever. I lost my voice
cheering at the skybox!" Aleena Syed
'l2 commented.
Others were even more emphatic.
"It was the happiest moment of my
Stanford experience," Kamil Saeid 'l3
said. "I think I was happier today than
when I got my acceptance."
Saeid went on to talk about how he
rushed the field at Stanford Stadium
after the clock ran out. "I was part of
the 'Y' [in Toby]," he added.
As the arrival of the team
approached, the crowd gathered near
the buses' stopping point and began

the celebration. Students roared when
the buses descended Campus Drive
and parked in front of Maples
Pavilion and cheered each one of the
exiting coaches and players.

The arrivals of Gerhart and Head
Coach Jim Harbaugh elicited espe
cially loud reactions, as did that of
defensive back Richard Sherman 'lO.
Sherman's fourth quarter interception
return for a touchdown essentially
sealed the game for Stanford, giving
them a 42-21 lead with 11 minutes, 41
seconds remaining in the fourth quar
ter, and all the remaining fight taken
from Trojans.
After the team emerged from the
buses, Gerhart took up the mega
phone and shouted to the crowd,
"We'll have the Axe in one more
week!"

Coach Harbaugh also addressed
the students: "Let's handle this with
humility and respect. And let's get Cal
next week!" As he finished, the crowd
roared in response.
At the end of the rally, students
commented on the experience.
"It was inspiring and unifying to
see the way the students pulled

together to show what Stanford has to
offer to the Pac-10 Conference," Pat
Kennedy 'l3 said.
Fausto Bustos 'll agreed.
"We had some good times cheer
ing for our team in anticipation of fur
ther victory next week," he said.

After the celebrations ended and
the students began to disperse,
Gerhart commented on the emotion
al aftermath of the game.
"It was some kind of exciting," he
said. "When there are 90,000 people
there and after the Sherman intercep
tion you see them giving up and leav
ing, it was a good feeling... It was
great to see how all of our hard work
paid off."
But despite celebrations immedi
ately following the victory, Harbaugh
emphasized that the team would
remain focused for next week's Big
Game against California.
"I trust our players. They're great
players they have character and
integrity. I trust that it won't affect our
preparation."
