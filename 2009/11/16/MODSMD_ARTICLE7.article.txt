Post-game: We just scored 55 on USC I don't
really care what I do. I can drink alcohol, I can
drink water, I can drink alcohol mixed with water. It
doesn't matter we just beat USC I do what I
want!"

Upperclassman girls, Stats 60 Lecture:
Professor Switzer, wearing a shirt that says "Switzer
land"
Girl 1: "How old do you think he is?"
Girl 2: "Well, if he's been a professor for 40 years,
it seems like he must be about 70."

Girl 1: "Yeah, but he doesn't look 70 that's why
I'm confused."
Girl 2: "Maybe it's all that time he spends in
'Switzer-land.' It looks really nice on his shirt . . .
like it has mountains and fish and stuff."
Girl 1: " . . . Wait . . . you know that it's supposed
to be a play on words for 'Switzerland' . . . right?"
Girl 2: ". . . FML."
