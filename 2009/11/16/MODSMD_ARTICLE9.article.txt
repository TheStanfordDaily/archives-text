## Group tutors campus workers' children Tutoring for Community program strengthens bonds

Every Saturday afternoon, with the
school week over, Tutoring for Community
(TFC) Program Coordinator Adrienne
Pon 'l2 and Stanford students gather at the
Haas Center for Public Service to tutor the
children of Stanford employees.
This past Saturday was no exception.
While Stanford tore down Southern
California in an epic football victory, 31
tutor and "tutee" pairs filled every corner
of the Haas Center to explore math, sci
ence, reading and writing.
For an hour and a half, the Center was
filled with a whirlwind of noises, ranging
from the children's' "ohh"s of understand
ing to the tutors' encouraging remarks.

"I love the feeling when my kid finally
reaches that point of understanding," said
tutor Owen Falk 'l3. "The look on their
faces and the excitement they exude is so
inspiring to me."
A pilot TFC program was launched in
spring 2009 in a collaborative effort by the
ASSU, Residential and Dining
Enterprises' (R&DE) Stepping Stones to
Success program and the Haas Center for
Public Service. This fall, the program
became an official Voluntary Student
Organization (VSO).
Isela Chavez, a Stanford Dining
employee, takes her five-year-old daughter
Abrise Chavez to the Haas Center every
weekend.
"It's a great opportunity," Chavez said.
"It's great for me to get help for my kid
because I sometimes don't have the time or
the right knowledge. I don't know English
very well."
Her daughter smiled and added to her
mother's comments. "I've learned a lot!"
she said.

According to Juanita Vazquez, a
Childcare Center of Stanford Community
employee, this program is beneficial to
Stanford employees. She also brings her
five children, ranging from five to 12 years
old, for tutoring every week.
"My kids are doing much better in
school," Vazquez said. "Tutors here help a
lot since they can understand subjects a lot
better than I do."
A group of three friends enrolled in the
TFC program commented together about
how the program has impacted them.
"So far, I've learned a lot of math and
my math skills have improved," said 13-
year-old Demond Williams.
His friends, Geovani Salto, 11, and
Emmanuel Salceo, 12, chimed in together.
"It's fun and it's helped us a lot!" they
said in unison.
Besides academic support, the tutors
and their students have the chance to form
close friendships.
