# STUDENT GROUPS
## Group tutors campus workers' children Tutoring for Community program strengthens bonds 
### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every Saturday afternoon, with the
school week over, Tutoring for Community
(TFC) Program Coordinator Adrienne
Pon 'l2 and Stanford students gather at the
Haas Center for Public Service to tutor the
children of Stanford employees.
This past Saturday was no exception.
While Stanford tore down Southern
California in an epic football victory, 31
tutor and "tutee" pairs filled every corner
of the Haas Center to explore math, sci
ence, reading and writing.
For an hour and a half, the Center was
filled with a whirlwind of noises, ranging
from the children's' "ohh"s of understand
ing to the tutors' encouraging remarks.

"I love the feeling when my kid finally
reaches that point of understanding," said
tutor Owen Falk 'l3. "The look on their
faces and the excitement they exude is so
inspiring to me."
A pilot TFC program was launched in
spring 2009 in a collaborative effort by the
ASSU, Residential and Dining
Enterprises' (R&DE) Stepping Stones to
Success program and the Haas Center for
Public Service. This fall, the program
became an official Voluntary Student
Organization (VSO).
Isela Chavez, a Stanford Dining
employee, takes her five-year-old daughter
Abrise Chavez to the Haas Center every
weekend.
"It's a great opportunity," Chavez said.
"It's great for me to get help for my kid
because I sometimes don't have the time or
the right knowledge. I don't know English
very well."
Her daughter smiled and added to her
mother's comments. "I've learned a lot!"
she said.

According to Juanita Vazquez, a
Childcare Center of Stanford Community
employee, this program is beneficial to
Stanford employees. She also brings her
five children, ranging from five to 12 years
old, for tutoring every week.
"My kids are doing much better in
school," Vazquez said. "Tutors here help a
lot since they can understand subjects a lot
better than I do."
A group of three friends enrolled in the
TFC program commented together about
how the program has impacted them.
"So far, I've learned a lot of math and
my math skills have improved," said 13-
year-old Demond Williams.
His friends, Geovani Salto, 11, and
Emmanuel Salceo, 12, chimed in together.
"It's fun and it's helped us a lot!" they
said in unison.
Besides academic support, the tutors
and their students have the chance to form
close friendships.

Every Satuday afternoon at the Haas Center for Public Service, Stanford students pair
up with campus employees' children as part of the Tutoring for Community program.
One pair took a break halfway
through the session and talked ani
matedly to each other about the
Pacific-10 Conference. Outside on
the patio, some pairs taught each
other how to dance.

"I can really identify with my
kid," said Jennifer Telschow 'l3.
"Because I saw how much of an
impact other people had on me to
get to Stanford, I want to make the
same impact."
According to Pon, TFC is struc
tured so that children can meet with
the same tutor every Saturday in
order to receive more individual
ized attention, stimulating more
academic growth.
"Tutoring is much better one-on
one because they have your full
attention and can ask us questions,"
said tutor Kee Wui Huang 'l3. "It's
more direct and effective than mas
sive tutoring."
Christine Gabali, R&DE
Stepping Stones to Success program
manager, said TFC is also strongly
focused on local community build
ing.

"We are providing help for our
own community rather than going

to EPA [East Palo Alto] or San
Jose," she said. "It's a beautiful way
of the Stanford community coming
together.
"We have the students, the
employer, the employees, the public
service center and the student body
organization," she added. "You have
everyone together in this program."
Andy Parker 'll, current ASSU
co-chief of staff and nominee for the
vacant position of ASSU vice presi
dent, explained that the ASSU plans
to incorporate the program into the
Student Services Division.
"Jonny [Dorsey 'o9] and Fagan
[Harris 'o9], last year's ASSU Execs,
had tried to institutionalize it to
make sure the project would be per
manent," Parker said. "This year,
our plan is to continue their work
and really help it grow and develop
to the point where it can be run in a
very sustainable way."
Plans to develop the program are
also on the horizon, but only after
all current elements are perfected.
"The program is seeking to make
sure that the program is the best it
can be for the current families and
tutors before opening it to more
people," Pon said. "We need to build
and tailor the program first, but in
the future, we do hope to expand."
