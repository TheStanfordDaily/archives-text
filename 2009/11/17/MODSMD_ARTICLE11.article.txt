## Early oceans cooler than originally thought 
### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two graduates from the School of
Earth Sciences have discovered infor
mation about early oceans that may
affect the understanding of early life on
earth.
Michael Hren Ph.D. 'O7 and Mike
Tice Ph.D. 'O6 found that 3.4 billion
years ago, the oceans had been cooler
than previously thought.
Their findings show the temperature
of early oceans to be at most 40 degrees
Celsius, contrary to the popular belief
that the ocean temperatures were in the
70-85-degree Celsius range.
"We're really putting an upper limit
on the temperature," Hren said. "What
we're saying is that the temperature
was significantly lower than what other
scientists thought, allowing us to reex
amine early life,"
According to Hren, the team exam
ined 3.4-billion-year-old rocks from the
ocean floor. While forming, the rocks
collected hydrogen and oxygen iso
topes from the ocean floor, and the
amounts varied depending on the tem
perature.
"Using this idea, we can measure
the rocks compositions now to con
strain the range of the ocean's temper
ature," Hren said. "By measuring the
distribution of isotopes in these 3.4-bil
lion-years-old rocks, you can deter
mine the composition and temperature
of the ocean."
The proportion of hydrogen with
the element deuterium, for instance,
can provide significant information.
This study's conclusion suggests
that early life was more diverse than
originally thought, because, according
to Tice, microorganisms are often more
comfortable at lower temperatures
than the originally hypothesized higher
temperatures.
Tice and Hren both brought up the
example of the Yellowstone hot springs
and the organisms that live there. The

temperatures at the Yellowstone hot
springs are similar to the previously
hypothesized ocean temperatures.
"The bottoms of the hot springs are
pretty bare," Tice said.
"Microorganisms can grow at this tem
perature but not happily or comfort
ably. It takes some adapting before it
can become productive,"
"There's life there but they have to
be uniquely adapted," Hren added.
"Only certain specialized organisms
can live."
This research will change some
assumptions about what happened in
the early formation of the earth, the
researchers say.
"We're saying that early in the
earth's history, the ocean was cool
enough to support all types of organ
isms, even though it's been argued that
all life was evolved and radiated from
the similar types of creatures we get in
hot springs," Hren said.
"It opens up new possibilities of
organisms we think of when we think
of early life," Tice added.
Tice's and Hren's research took
approximately nine years. The rocks
used in the study were collected from
2000 to 2004, and analysis began in
2005.
"It definitely has me thinking very
differently from when I first started the
project," Tice said. "But this might not
be the last word on the question
someone may even come up with
something different; but for now, this is
what we have found."
Hren plans to continue investigat
ing more geological formations over
time.
"This is a topic that will be debated
for scientists for years to come," he said.
"So we will need to find similar patterns
from other really old rocks from differ
ent locations on the globe to see if we
get the same answer."
