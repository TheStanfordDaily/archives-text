## Hatoyama greets Obama 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
President Barack Obama began
his multi-stop Asia tour in Japan,
arriving last Friday to the welcome of
recently installed Japanese Prime
Minister and Stanford alumnus Yukio
Flatoyama M.S. '72, Ph.D. '76.

Obama marked his first trip to
Asia since his election by highlight
ing the 50-year alliance between the
two nations while acknowledging the
calls for a more "equal partnership."
"Each country brings specific
assets and strengths to the relation
ship, but we proceed based on mutu
al interest and mutual respect and
that will continue," Obama said,
according to the press briefing tran
script by the Los Angeles Times.
Preceding the visit, Hatoyama's
government had pushed for more
independence from Washington and
the review of the continued U.S. mil

itary presence on the island of
Okinawa.
But talks between the two leaders
were amicable, and Hatoyama said
the two heads of state were on a first
name basis. Topics discussed includ
ed Afghanistan, nuclear prolifera
tion, climate change and the econo
my.

"Naturally, we have to cooperate
in proliferation deterrence, on infor
mation protection, missile defense
and the use of other states [among]
others," Hatoyama said at the brief
ing. "We need to consider these new
systems for issuing security."
