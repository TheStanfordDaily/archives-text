## A
						BROAD ABROAD Closeted Conservatism 
### Molly Spaeth 
Let's get one thing straight: I'm a liberal.
Or, as my father likes to introduce me to
his poker buddies (affectionately, I like
to think), "This is my daughter. She's a lib
tard."
For those of you who are unfamiliar with
that phrase (as was I), it is derived from its
original version, Paultard, as a word describ
ing a strange, nebulotic fantasy land in which
everything Ron Paul says is true, correct and
can even balance the federal budget! A libtard
is very similar to a Paultard, although replace
libertarian with liberal and Ron Paul with
Dennis Kucinich. Or, as Urban Dictionary so
eloquently defines it, "The result when a tree
hugger successfully mates with a tree and the
offspring is born with an extra chromosome."
Alas, all social stratifications set aside, one
of my inherent duties as a libtard is champi
oning first-amendment rights and the impor
tance of being open-minded to anyone and
everyone who will hear it. After high school, I
found myself snuggled quite comfortably
among fellow libtards at Stanford University,
where we could all merrily engage in vigorous
debate about politics, the economy, abortion
and gay rights.
Oh, right. I guess I had forgotten that little
detail. That is, when you all agree with each
other, it isn't really debate so much as congrat
ulating yourselves on your own intellectual
superiority for being able to outwit and out
think those dirty Republicans.
Nonetheless, I enjoyed the political land
scape of Stanford even more after Jonny
Dorsey and Fagan Flarris endorsed the No on
8 campaign and the ASSU set up a calling
bank for the cause. When Gavin Newsom
came to campus to support No on 8,1 remem
ber biking through White Plaza with an over
whelming sense of pride at my university, as
purple shirts and rainbow flags abounded.
"Look at how open, accepting and loving we
are!" I thought. "If only everyone in the world
could be as tolerant as us, the world would be
a better place."
But as I biked about 20 feet further, I saw
something that I hadn't seen publicly or
prominently displayed on campus since the
"No on 8" campaign had begun.
There they were, the 20 or so brave souls
who had taken to the middle of White Plaza,
clad in yellow shirts while silently clutching
their yellow and blue "Yes on 8!" signs for
dear life,
I stopped and stared. And initially, I be
came quite upset.
There were people at STANFORD who
supported the Yes on 8 campaign? There were
students at one of the most liberal, open
minded institutions in the world, promoting
political propaganda for one of the grossest
human rights violations of our generation?!
Didn't they KNOW how close-minded they
were being?!
As I biked past these close-minded reac
tionaries, the smooth and steady pedaling of
my pink-and-green bike, Giselle, gave my
brain some space to evaluate the situation

Let's try not to keep
the conservatives
locked in the closet,
Stanford.

from a more even perspective. I recognized
that, just by sheer probability, there had to
have been some gay marriage opponents on
campus. But in the flurry and excitement of
the political activity of the previous few weeks,
I realized that I hadn't encountered a single
Stanford student who had openly voiced their
support for the ballot measure.
The more I thought about it, I realized that
perhaps the greater injustice was not that
these 20 people supported Proposition 8, but
the fact that for the past few weeks, I hadn't
seen, heard or even contributed to any sort of
student debate on the issue at Stanford. Just as
we were campaigning to make gay marriages
more accepted in California, these "Yes-on-8"
protestors were campaigning to make hetero
sexual-only marriages more accepted at Stan
ford.
These brave souls exercised that day their
freedom of speech, a fundamental human
right, to campaign against the adoption of
what I believed should be a fundamental
human right: gay marriage. And although I
didn't agree with them, I found myself re
specting their courage to voice their beliefs on
a campus that, as a whole, was and still is vehe
mently opposed to anything and everything
"Yes on 8."
Let's try not to keep the conservatives
locked in the closet, Stanford. Although you
may not agree with their ideas or principles, it
wouldn't hurt any of us to stop congratulating
ourselves on how open-minded we are, and
start actually being open-minded. Aside from
the fact that understanding and accepting con
trasting political opinions is probably essential
for that far-off land known as Life After Stan
ford, it will probably be more fun, too. What
kind of self-respecting libtard is going to turn
down a healthy political debate with a
Paultard at Kairos' Wine and Cheese night
every other Wednesday?!
And that, ladies and gentleman, is why we
love democracy.

If you were one of those ?Yes on 8? advocates
that fateful day in White Plaza and want to dis
cuss the advantages and disadvantages of gay
marriage, holla at mspaeth@stanford.edu.
