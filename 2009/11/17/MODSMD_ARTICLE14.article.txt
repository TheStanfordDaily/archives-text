# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Why I Left Science 
### Danny Crichton 
Last week, I had the pleasure of hearing
from Bruce Alberts, former head of the
National Academy of Sciences and the
current editor of the journal Science, discuss
science education and his own path in gradu
ate school.

After years of arduous work, he became
the first person in the history of his depart
ment at Harvard to fail a dissertation de
fense. For most, their careers would be fin
ished. Over the course of the next year, how
ever, he found new mentors and new mean
ing in his work, and Alberts managed to earn
his doctorate and eventually discover many
of the proteins behind DNA replication.
Today, his textbook is the "Bible" of the field.
It is a wonderful success story, but few stu
dents manage to fail at the dissertation stage.
They abandon science far earlier, when they
are in grade school or when they take their
first introductory university class. They leave
before anyone knew they were there in the
first place. How many students abandon the
sciences like Alberts, but never had a mentor
to bring them back?

Allow me to speak from experience. I
came to Stanford with two potential majors
checked on the new student adviser sheet: bi
ology and political science. I have managed
to cover those areas well, but something
changed over the past two years.
I started taking political science classes
when I arrived at Stanford, but by winter
quarter, I had rekindled my interests in the
life sciences. I had no idea that it was already
too late chemistry is only offered once a
year. While it did not help that my adviser
was a political science professor, I had no one
to blame but myself. Chemistry is simply not
a subject I will be exposed to during my time
at Stanford.

I decided to change my academic plans,
enrolling in the Human Biology core.

Hum√üio was the first exposure to science I
had at Stanford. In previous courses, I had an
average class size of 16; now I was taking a
class with more than 300 other students.
Simultaneously that year, I talked with
several faculty members in different science
fields, asking questions about science and
how I could be a part of it. Some were enthu
siastic, but none ever encouraged me to con
tinue my studies.
I looked at the equation before me: large
lecture classes with memorization-intensive
coursework plus little support, plus little op
portunity to be involved in science, equals
bad Stanford education. So, I left.
I grew up watching Star Trek, the last bas
tion of philosophical television before the re
ality revolution. I grew up with the passion to
explore new frontiers, to discover the un
known, to boldly go where no one has gone
before. I would never have thought that such
a background would be so incompatible with
my undergraduate science experience, nor
would I have guessed that the professor who
has taught me more about evidence and data
would be a member of the History Depart
ment and not one of biology.
Open inquiry is the very value that seems
most lacking in Stanford's science classes.
Everything is so certain, the answers known,
the work predictable. Kudos to the Biology
Department for experimenting with its lab
sequence this year. However, one course se

quence among many just does not change the
underlying dogma. As someone who wanted
to know the laws of the world, I have come up
just a little bit short.
President Barack Obama has called for
thousands of more students to enter STEM
fields and become the innovative vanguard
in the 21st century. He is up against enor
mous obstacles, but perhaps Stanford and
other schools can start to make the process
just a little easier. Here are some suggestions:
First, create science classes for non-sci
ence majors. Berkeley has "Physics for Presi
dents," a popular class that was recently pub
lished in book format. Stanford offers
physics at different levels, but the value of
mechanics equations is lost on most other
majors. Focus instead on the big questions
and the process of science.
Second, increase support for students by
increasing faculty interaction early on, re
ducing freshman year requirements and in
creasing the frequency of the courses of
fered. Having a little more flexibility coupled
with the courses described above may actual
ly attract new students to science fields.
Finally, courses should build the scientific
method into the curriculum and deempha
size rote memorization. There have been too
many Academy reports about the quality of
science education in this country. The prob
lem is obvious; the solutions are known.
There are no excuses now.
I commend Bruce Alberts and other sci
entists who are trying to bring back the pri
macy of science education to our nation's
universities. Perhaps we will do right by the
next generation. For me, I will boldly go in a
different direction.
