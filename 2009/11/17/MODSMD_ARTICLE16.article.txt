## CARD CRUISES PAST CAL POLY Men win home opener 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
Last Thursday, Stanford men's basketball
found something worth hanging onto: news
that sophomore guard Jeremy Green would be
reinstated in time for the team's opener against
San Diego. The guard averaged 6.4 points per
game in 2008-09 and was Stanford's second
leading shooter from long range, shooting 45.6
percent from behind the arc.
In short, his return offered a much-needed
offensive sidekick to Fields before Stanford
took on San Diego away on Friday and Cal
Poly at home on Sunday.
But Green's 13 points and senior Fields'
career-high 25 weren't enough to lift the Card
(1-1) over the Toreros (2-0), and Stanford fell,
77-64.
The game stayed close throughout the first
half, but with 2:28 to go, San Diego had earned
the biggest advantage of the night at eight
points. The Cardinal responded quickly,
though, and a three-pointer by senior guard
Emmanuel Igbinosa, followed by free throws, a
block, and a jumper all made by Fields
cut the margin to 35-32 before the break.
Stanford shot 47.8 percent in the opening
period, including four of eight threes, but scor
ing was far from shared, as Fields put up 14 of
his own, followed next by senior guard Drew
Shiller with six and Green with five.
The Cardinal jumped to a 6-0 run to start
the second half, taking a 38-35 lead at 17:19.
San Diego then found a run of its own, silenc
ing Stanford for the next three minutes of play
and going ahead once again at 40-38.
Although Stanford managed to hang on
until the five-minute mark, defensive struggles
plagued the Card and finally caused a collapse
during the final minutes of play. Torero seniors
De'Jon Jackson and Brandon Johnson each
put up 18 points, and guard Chris Lewis added
another 15. They helped San Diego shoot 52.6
percent on the game, while Stanford's own
shooting fell to 30.3 percent in the half and 37.5
for the game.
Stanford failed to capitalize on other offen
sive opportunities as well the Toreros
earned 13 points to Stanford's six off turnovers,
and while Fields pulled down nine boards, the
Card was outrebounded 40-33, contributing to
an 11-6 disadvantage in second-chance scoring.
Though the team struggled overall, Fields
hopes that his continued production will soon
offer a spark to the rest of the team.
"Obviously, [my biggest adjustment this
season has been] leadership," Fields said. "We
have a lot of inexperienced guys on the team,
and I feel like if they can feed off me, it's going
to bring their games to a higher level. So, you
know, it's all about bringing them in each day in
practice, every day of a game."
After the disappointing loss to start the sea
son, the Cardinal came home looking to earn

its first win for the season against the Mustangs
(0-2). Improve it did, and Coach Johnny
Dawkins was especially happy that the team
found the defensive stride that it had lacked in
San Diego.
"I thought we played really well defensive
ly," Dawkins said. "That's something we tried
to work after we played at San Diego was our
overall defense, rotations and on-ball defense,
and our guys did a good job ... I think our
guys are coming together. Communication's
getting better and our defense is getting bet
ter."
The defensive effort for Stanford seemed to
be the difference-maker against Cal Poly,
which was held to 53 points in the Card's 70-53
victory.
Fields kicked things off by drawing a charge
roughly a minute into the game, and then
nailed a three to start the Cardinal offense.
From there, Stanford jumped to an early 10-
point lead that lingered throughout the first
half, thanks to scoring by Fields, Shiller and
Green, with seven, eight and five points, re
spectively.
But the rest of the team chipped in other
ways, especially sophomore forward Andrew
Zimmerman, who had two points and five re
bounds before the break.
Stanford tore open its lead halfway through
the second period with a three by Jarrett Mann,
a jumper by Elliott Bullock and free throws by
Fields, which made the lead 18. With that, Stan
ford put the game out of reach for the Mus
tangs and never looked back.
By the end of the contest, nine Cardinal
players had the chance to play 10 minutes or
more, and all of them added to Stanford's of
fensive production. But it was Fields (per
usual) out front for the Card again with 22
points and seven boards, and in doing so, the
senior again hoped to raise the play of his
teammates.
"I want to go out there and help everybody
out as well as myself," Fields said. "It's about

leading them in the right direction and in the
right ways."
In reply, Shiller and sophomores Jack Trot
ter and Mann offered another 11, 10 and 10
points, respectively, and Dawkins commended
their efforts after the game,
"Drew played with a lot of poise," Dawkins
said. "He had opportunities to run our team,
and he did a good job when he was in there.
Jack played strong for us. [He] finished around
the basket, he made his open looks and he got
a few rebounds for us, so I thought both of the
guys gave us good contributions."
But a win against Cal Poly is by no means
the end of the road for Stanford. In fact,
Dawkins already sees room for progress.

"I didn't think we executed as well offen
sively as I would like to have seen us do," he
said. "Our spacing wasn't where I wanted it. I
didn't think we hit guys on time offensively;
things that we have to do to become a very
good basketball team... I thought we left
points on the table from the standpoint of how
we can run our offense more efficiently."
This early in the season, the Card has plenty
of chances to improve this efficiency. The first
one arrives on Wednesday as Stanford looks to
make this a streak of home wins against Oral
Roberts at 7 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.

overall defense, rotations and on-ball defense,
and our guys did a good job ... I think our
guys are coming together. Communication's
getting better and our defense is getting bet
ter."
The defensive effort for Stanford seemed to
be the difference-maker against Cal Poly,
which was held to 53 points in the Card's 70-53
victory.
Fields kicked things off by drawing a charge
roughly a minute into the game, and then
nailed a three to start the Cardinal offense.
From there, Stanford jumped to an early 10-
point lead that lingered throughout the first
half, thanks to scoring by Fields, Shiller and
Green, with seven, eight and five points, re
spectively.
But the rest of the team chipped in other
ways, especially sophomore forward Andrew
Zimmerman, who had two points and five re
bounds before the break.
Stanford tore open its lead halfway through
the second period with a three by Jarrett Mann,
a jumper by Elliott Bullock and free throws by
Fields, which made the lead 18. With that, Stan
ford put the game out of reach for the Mus
tangs and never looked back.
By the end of the contest, nine Cardinal
players had the chance to play 10 minutes or
more, and all of them added to Stanford's of
fensive production. But it was Fields (per
usual) out front for the Card again with 22
points and seven boards, and in doing so, the
senior again hoped to raise the play of his
teammates.
"I want to go out there and help everybody
out as well as myself," Fields said. "It's about

leading them in the right direction and in the
right ways."
In reply, Shiller and sophomores Jack Trot
ter and Mann offered another 11, 10 and 10
points, respectively, and Dawkins commended
their efforts after the game,
"Drew played with a lot of poise," Dawkins
said. "He had opportunities to run our team,
and he did a good job when he was in there.
Jack played strong for us. [He] finished around
the basket, he made his open looks and he got
a few rebounds for us, so I thought both of the
guys gave us good contributions."
But a win against Cal Poly is by no means
the end of the road for Stanford. In fact,
Dawkins already sees room for progress.

"I didn't think we executed as well offen
sively as I would like to have seen us do," he
said. "Our spacing wasn't where I wanted it. I
didn't think we hit guys on time offensively;
things that we have to do to become a very
good basketball team... I thought we left
points on the table from the standpoint of how
we can run our offense more efficiently."
This early in the season, the Card has plenty
of chances to improve this efficiency. The first
one arrives on Wednesday as Stanford looks to
make this a streak of home wins against Oral
Roberts at 7 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.

While many are skeptical that the Cardinal will be a competitive force this season, the
team certainly gave fans something to cheer for in their first game at Maples Pavilion.
Behind a 22-point effort from Landry Fields, the Card earned a solid victory over Cal Poly.
Last Thursday, Stanford men's basketball
found something worth hanging onto: news
that sophomore guard Jeremy Green would be
reinstated in time for the team's opener against
San Diego. The guard averaged 6.4 points per
game in 2008-09 and was Stanford's second
leading shooter from long range, shooting 45.6
percent from behind the arc.
In short, his return offered a much-needed
offensive sidekick to Fields before Stanford
took on San Diego away on Friday and Cal
Poly at home on Sunday.
But Green's 13 points and senior Fields'
career-high 25 weren't enough to lift the Card
(1-1) over the Toreros (2-0), and Stanford fell,
77-64.
The game stayed close throughout the first
half, but with 2:28 to go, San Diego had earned
the biggest advantage of the night at eight
points. The Cardinal responded quickly,
though, and a three-pointer by senior guard
Emmanuel Igbinosa, followed by free throws, a
block, and a jumper all made by Fields
cut the margin to 35-32 before the break.
Stanford shot 47.8 percent in the opening
period, including four of eight threes, but scor
ing was far from shared, as Fields put up 14 of
his own, followed next by senior guard Drew
Shiller with six and Green with five.
The Cardinal jumped to a 6-0 run to start
the second half, taking a 38-35 lead at 17:19.
San Diego then found a run of its own, silenc
ing Stanford for the next three minutes of play
and going ahead once again at 40-38.
Although Stanford managed to hang on
until the five-minute mark, defensive struggles
plagued the Card and finally caused a collapse
during the final minutes of play. Torero seniors
De'Jon Jackson and Brandon Johnson each
put up 18 points, and guard Chris Lewis added
another 15. They helped San Diego shoot 52.6
percent on the game, while Stanford's own
shooting fell to 30.3 percent in the half and 37.5
for the game.
Stanford failed to capitalize on other offen
sive opportunities as well the Toreros
earned 13 points to Stanford's six off turnovers,
and while Fields pulled down nine boards, the
Card was outrebounded 40-33, contributing to
an 11-6 disadvantage in second-chance scoring.
Though the team struggled overall, Fields
hopes that his continued production will soon
offer a spark to the rest of the team.
"Obviously, [my biggest adjustment this
season has been] leadership," Fields said. "We
have a lot of inexperienced guys on the team,
and I feel like if they can feed off me, it's going
to bring their games to a higher level. So, you
know, it's all about bringing them in each day in
practice, every day of a game."
After the disappointing loss to start the sea
son, the Cardinal came home looking to earn

its first win for the season against the Mustangs
(0-2). Improve it did, and Coach Johnny
Dawkins was especially happy that the team
found the defensive stride that it had lacked in
San Diego.
"I thought we played really well defensive
ly," Dawkins said. "That's something we tried
to work after we played at San Diego was our
overall defense, rotations and on-ball defense,
and our guys did a good job ... I think our
guys are coming together. Communication's
getting better and our defense is getting bet
