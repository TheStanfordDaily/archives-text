## Card takes tough OT loss to Trojans 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
It's only one loss, but this one hurts.
The No. 3 Stanford men's water polo team
(19-1,6-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
fell in overtime to No. IUSCI3-12 Saturday af
ternoon in Los Angeles, failing to wash away the
sour taste left in its mouth after losing to the Tro
jans last year in the national title game.
"Overall we played a solid game; nothing
great," said senior goalkeeper Jimmie Sand
man.
Against the defending national champions,
anything less than great doesn't cut it.
"We had too many defensive breakdowns,"

said sophomore driver Travis Noll. "We let them
score way too many goals."
For one of the few times all season, the Car
dinal had to play from behind. USC scored be
fore and after a goal from Stanford senior Jan
son Wigo to take a 2-1 lead at the end of the first
period.
Janson Wigo scored once again to momen
tarily tie the game, but the Trojans quickly
tacked on two more goals to reclaim the lead.
"It was kind of getting out the jitters early
on," Sandman said. "We made a few mistakes
early in the first quarter and ended up getting
down big. It's definitely a testament to our
toughness getting back into the game."
The Cardinal fought back to close the gap to

5-4 at halftime thanks to goals from senior Drac
Wigo and freshman Paul Rudolph.
In the third period, Sandman gave Stanford
the opportunity it needed to knot up the game
as the All-American goalie made seven of his 12
total saves in the period. Two more goals from
Rudolph and one from redshirt freshman Travis
Noll evened things up at seven heading into the
final period.
Neither team would budge in the fourth.
The Trojans scored the first two goals of the
period, and with the Cardinal defense looking
tired and overworked, the game seemed to be
slipping away. But Stanford came roaring back
with three unanswered goals from Janson Wigo
and Rudolph.

Within the final four minutes of regulation,
Stanford blew two separate one-goal leads, only
to find itself down one with 10 seconds left to
play. That's when sophomore Jacob Smith was
able to find the back of the net to send the game
into overtime.
In the two three-minute overtime periods,
the Cardinal could not capitalize.
"In overtime, you basically get six posses
sions and you have to make the most of them,"

Sandman said. "We didn't."
USC scored the lone goal in over
time, securing its 13-12 victory.
The silver lining in the defeat is
that Stanford knows it can play with
the top-ranked Trojans. It's simply a
matter of eliminating unnecessary er
rors.
"We didn't execute well," Noll
said. "We have to work on getting
back and just play fundamental water
polo."
While the loss obviously does not
help Stanford's chances at winning a
national championship, it does not
hurt them too badly, either. Stanford
will finish its regular season this Satur
day against Cal and then head into the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
tournament the following weekend.
If the Cardinal loses to Berkeley, it
will have to win the MPSF tourna
ment to advance into the champi
onship tournament. If Stanford wins,
a loss in the tournament may not be
deadly.
The Stanford players are not
thinking of the different playoff sce
narios, though.
"All we can do is control how we
play," Sandman said. "We've got six
games left and we want to go on a six
game winning streak."
The Cardinal will do its best to for
get this game and prepare for Berke
ley, but with local and national media
in a frenzy over Stanford football's
performance in the Coliseum, it will
be tough to totally move on.
Even with the constant reminders
on the game that could have been,
Stanford must focus on the season
that can still be.
