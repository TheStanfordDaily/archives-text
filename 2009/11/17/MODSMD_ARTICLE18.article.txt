# Routes to the Roses
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
After impressive victories
over powerhouses Oregon
and USC, Stanford football
can still make the Rose Bowl
if things fall into place correctly.
You'd have to be more clueless
than Titans owner Bud Adams to not
have heard this at some point in the
post-USC mayhem. Most people,
though, don't know what has to hap
pen for Stanford to make the Rose
Bowl, or who would make it if Stanford
does not.
Currently, four Pac-10 teams are
still alive for the coveted spot in The
Granddaddy of Them All, and all have
a reasonable chance at representing
the Pac-10 against Ohio State on New
Year's Day. Surprisingly, for those on
the East Coast who think the Pac-10 is
USC and the Pac-9, Southern Cal is not
among the aforementioned con
tenders. With the loss to Stanford or
should I say the embarrassing blowout
to Stanford the Trojans have been
mathematically eliminated from con
tention for the Rose Bowl, so they will
be hoping for the Sun Bowl this year.
Instead, I'll focus on those four
teams with plans for Pasadena over the
holidays. Let's start with the Pac-10's
hottest team, a team that jumped from
unranked to 17th in the BCS Stand
ings.
Stanford
Despite its recent surge, Stanford
still needs the most help of the four
contenders to get to the Rose Bowl.
First and foremost, though, the Car
dinal must beat Cal this Saturday, or
everything else becomes meaningless.
This cannot be stressed enough, be
cause for the first time this season,
Stanford is gaining media attention
and Cal is far too good a team to over
look. And in case there's someone in
Antarctica that doesn't know, it's a ri
valry game, so anything can happen.
Big Game always means a lot to
both teams, but the Rose Bowl impli
cations will only make the atmosphere
that much more heated. Stanford is at
home and favored by eight points and
Cal is missing its Best player. Shane
Vereen has been a very effective re
placement for Jahvid Best, though, so
Stanford will still be playing against a
legitimate top-25 team. If Stanford can
keep its momentum from winning
three straight games and continue its
home dominance (10 wins in its last 11
home games), the Cardinal should be
able to put away the Golden Bears.

Assuming Stanford regains the Axe,
which again is not a trivial assumption,
Stanford will finish 7-2 in Pac-10 play.
After Big Game, the Cardinal will
need to do its best "Take Me Out to the
Ball Game" impression and root, root,
root for the home team.That's because
Stanford needs three other teams to
win in order to clinch a Rose Bowl
berth and all three will be playing at
home.
First of all, the top two teams in the
Pac-10 at the moment, Oregon and
Arizona, will face off in Tucson with
ESPN's College Gameday on hand.
Stanford's only realistic shot at going
to the Rose Bowl is for Arizona to beat
Oregon at home. This result seemed a
lot more likely before Arizona lost at
Cal, but Arizona has a high-powered
offense and should have a great home
field advantage. Currently, Oregon is

favored by about five on the road, but
the Ducks were also favored by five
against Stanford on the road and we
all remember how that turned out.
If Stanford and Arizona take care
of business this week, the Cardinal will
have to wait nearly two weeks to find
out its Rose Bowl chances (Stanford's
only other regular season game is
against Notre Dame, which does not
count in the Pac-10 standings). On
Dec. 3, a Thursday night, Oregon and
Oregon State will battle in the Civil
War at Autzen Stadium in Eugene.
Stanford needs Oregon to beat Ore
gon State to stay alive in the Rose Bowl
race. Then, Stanford needs USC to
beat Arizona on the fifth, unless Ari
zona State pulls the upset over Arizona
the week beforehand.
The Cardinal needs all these results
to clinch a Rose Bowl bid, unless
Washington State pulls the new
biggest upset ever and defeats Oregon
State this Saturday. Seeing as how the
Cougars have not led in regulation this
entire year (their only win was in triple
overtime over SMU), I'm not count
ing on help from them.
In summary, Stanford needs to beat
Cal and have Arizona beat Oregon,
Oregon beat Oregon State, and either
USC or Arizona State beat Arizona.
That is a lot that needs to go right for
Stanford, but each matchup is reason
able, and again, every team Stanford
needs to win is a home team. If Stan
ford beats Cal and everything else
doesn't quite work out, the Cardinal is
likely looking at the Holiday Bowl,
where it would likely take on Nebras
ka or Oklahoma State,
The other teams have much sim
pler scenarios to make the Rose Bowl.

Oregon
Oregon is in first place in the Pac
-10 and controls its own destiny. The
Ducks simply need to win their final
two games, at Arizona and vs. Oregon
State, and they will head to Pasadena.
Oregon could also win in a tiebreaker
if it loses to Arizona or Oregon State,
but those scenarios involve Arizona
and Stanford losing or Washington
State beating Oregon State, which are
both unlikely.
Arizona
Arizona also has a clear run at the
Rose Bowl. The Wildcats need to win
their final three games, vs. Oregon, at
Arizona State and at USC, and they
will make their first ever Rose Bowl
appearance.
Oregon State
Oregon State, despite starting out
slowly again, has a very good chance at
sneaking to the top of the Rose Bowl
standings. Oregon State needs to win
its final two games, at Washington
State and at Oregon, and have Ari
zona lose one of its final three games.
This result is very possible, and due to
Oregon State's tiebreaker over Stan
ford, the Beavers would represent the
Pac-10.
My personal feeling is that this race
could really go any of the four ways.
Stanford definitely has a lot to be ex
cited about, but its come-from-ahead
loss against Arizona exactly one
month ago might prevent the Cardinal
from reaching its first Rose Bowl in a
decade.
First things first, though, Stanford
needs to regain the Axe before it can
dream of roses.

My personal feeling is that this race
could really go any of the four ways.
Stanford definitely has a lot to be ex
cited about, but its come-from-ahead
loss against Arizona exactly one
month ago might prevent the Cardinal
from reaching its first Rose Bowl in a
decade.
First things first, though, Stanford
needs to regain the Axe before it can
dream of roses.

After impressive victories
over powerhouses Oregon
and USC, Stanford football
can still make the Rose Bowl
if things fall into place correctly.
You'd have to be more clueless
than Titans owner Bud Adams to not
have heard this at some point in the
post-USC mayhem. Most people,
though, don't know what has to hap
pen for Stanford to make the Rose
Bowl, or who would make it if Stanford
does not.
Currently, four Pac-10 teams are
still alive for the coveted spot in The
Granddaddy of Them All, and all have
a reasonable chance at representing
the Pac-10 against Ohio State on New
Year's Day. Surprisingly, for those on
the East Coast who think the Pac-10 is
USC and the Pac-9, Southern Cal is not
among the aforementioned con
tenders. With the loss to Stanford or
should I say the embarrassing blowout
to Stanford the Trojans have been
mathematically eliminated from con
tention for the Rose Bowl, so they will
be hoping for the Sun Bowl this year.
Instead, I'll focus on those four
teams with plans for Pasadena over the
holidays. Let's start with the Pac-10's
hottest team, a team that jumped from
unranked to 17th in the BCS Stand
ings.
Stanford
Despite its recent surge, Stanford
still needs the most help of the four
contenders to get to the Rose Bowl.
First and foremost, though, the Car
dinal must beat Cal this Saturday, or
everything else becomes meaningless.
This cannot be stressed enough, be
cause for the first time this season,
Stanford is gaining media attention
and Cal is far too good a team to over
look. And in case there's someone in
Antarctica that doesn't know, it's a ri
valry game, so anything can happen.
Big Game always means a lot to
both teams, but the Rose Bowl impli
cations will only make the atmosphere
that much more heated. Stanford is at
home and favored by eight points and
Cal is missing its Best player. Shane
Vereen has been a very effective re
placement for Jahvid Best, though, so
Stanford will still be playing against a
legitimate top-25 team. If Stanford can
keep its momentum from winning
three straight games and continue its
home dominance (10 wins in its last 11
home games), the Cardinal should be
able to put away the Golden Bears.

Assuming Stanford regains the Axe,
which again is not a trivial assumption,
Stanford will finish 7-2 in Pac-10 play.
After Big Game, the Cardinal will
need to do its best "Take Me Out to the
Ball Game" impression and root, root,
root for the home team.That's because
Stanford needs three other teams to
win in order to clinch a Rose Bowl
berth and all three will be playing at
home.
First of all, the top two teams in the
Pac-10 at the moment, Oregon and
Arizona, will face off in Tucson with
ESPN's College Gameday on hand.
Stanford's only realistic shot at going
to the Rose Bowl is for Arizona to beat
Oregon at home. This result seemed a
lot more likely before Arizona lost at
Cal, but Arizona has a high-powered
offense and should have a great home
field advantage. Currently, Oregon is

favored by about five on the road, but
the Ducks were also favored by five
against Stanford on the road and we
all remember how that turned out.
If Stanford and Arizona take care
of business this week, the Cardinal will
have to wait nearly two weeks to find
out its Rose Bowl chances (Stanford's
only other regular season game is
against Notre Dame, which does not
count in the Pac-10 standings). On
Dec. 3, a Thursday night, Oregon and
Oregon State will battle in the Civil
War at Autzen Stadium in Eugene.
Stanford needs Oregon to beat Ore
gon State to stay alive in the Rose Bowl
race. Then, Stanford needs USC to
beat Arizona on the fifth, unless Ari
zona State pulls the upset over Arizona
the week beforehand.
The Cardinal needs all these results
to clinch a Rose Bowl bid, unless
Washington State pulls the new
biggest upset ever and defeats Oregon
State this Saturday. Seeing as how the
Cougars have not led in regulation this
entire year (their only win was in triple
overtime over SMU), I'm not count
ing on help from them.
In summary, Stanford needs to beat
Cal and have Arizona beat Oregon,
Oregon beat Oregon State, and either
USC or Arizona State beat Arizona.
That is a lot that needs to go right for
Stanford, but each matchup is reason
able, and again, every team Stanford
needs to win is a home team. If Stan
ford beats Cal and everything else
doesn't quite work out, the Cardinal is
likely looking at the Holiday Bowl,
where it would likely take on Nebras
ka or Oklahoma State,
The other teams have much sim
pler scenarios to make the Rose Bowl.

Oregon
Oregon is in first place in the Pac
-10 and controls its own destiny. The
Ducks simply need to win their final
two games, at Arizona and vs. Oregon
State, and they will head to Pasadena.
Oregon could also win in a tiebreaker
if it loses to Arizona or Oregon State,
but those scenarios involve Arizona
and Stanford losing or Washington
State beating Oregon State, which are
both unlikely.
Arizona
Arizona also has a clear run at the
Rose Bowl. The Wildcats need to win
their final three games, vs. Oregon, at
Arizona State and at USC, and they
will make their first ever Rose Bowl
appearance.
Oregon State
Oregon State, despite starting out
slowly again, has a very good chance at
sneaking to the top of the Rose Bowl
standings. Oregon State needs to win
its final two games, at Washington
State and at Oregon, and have Ari
zona lose one of its final three games.
This result is very possible, and due to
Oregon State's tiebreaker over Stan
ford, the Beavers would represent the
Pac-10.
My personal feeling is that this race
could really go any of the four ways.
Stanford definitely has a lot to be ex
cited about, but its come-from-ahead
loss against Arizona exactly one
month ago might prevent the Cardinal
from reaching its first Rose Bowl in a
decade.
First things first, though, Stanford
needs to regain the Axe before it can
dream of roses.
