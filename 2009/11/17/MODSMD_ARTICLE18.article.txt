# Routes to the Roses
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
After impressive victories
over powerhouses Oregon
and USC, Stanford football
can still make the Rose Bowl
if things fall into place correctly.
You'd have to be more clueless
than Titans owner Bud Adams to not
have heard this at some point in the
post-USC mayhem. Most people,
though, don't know what has to hap
pen for Stanford to make the Rose
Bowl, or who would make it if Stanford
does not.
Currently, four Pac-10 teams are
still alive for the coveted spot in The
Granddaddy of Them All, and all have
a reasonable chance at representing
the Pac-10 against Ohio State on New
Year's Day. Surprisingly, for those on
the East Coast who think the Pac-10 is
USC and the Pac-9, Southern Cal is not
among the aforementioned con
tenders. With the loss to Stanford or
should I say the embarrassing blowout
to Stanford the Trojans have been
mathematically eliminated from con
tention for the Rose Bowl, so they will
be hoping for the Sun Bowl this year.
Instead, I'll focus on those four
teams with plans for Pasadena over the
holidays. Let's start with the Pac-10's
hottest team, a team that jumped from
unranked to 17th in the BCS Stand
ings.
Stanford
Despite its recent surge, Stanford
still needs the most help of the four
contenders to get to the Rose Bowl.
First and foremost, though, the Car
dinal must beat Cal this Saturday, or
everything else becomes meaningless.
This cannot be stressed enough, be
cause for the first time this season,
Stanford is gaining media attention
and Cal is far too good a team to over
look. And in case there's someone in
Antarctica that doesn't know, it's a ri
valry game, so anything can happen.
Big Game always means a lot to
both teams, but the Rose Bowl impli
cations will only make the atmosphere
that much more heated. Stanford is at
home and favored by eight points and
Cal is missing its Best player. Shane
Vereen has been a very effective re
placement for Jahvid Best, though, so
Stanford will still be playing against a
legitimate top-25 team. If Stanford can
keep its momentum from winning
three straight games and continue its
home dominance (10 wins in its last 11
home games), the Cardinal should be
able to put away the Golden Bears.

Assuming Stanford regains the Axe,
which again is not a trivial assumption,
Stanford will finish 7-2 in Pac-10 play.
After Big Game, the Cardinal will
need to do its best "Take Me Out to the
Ball Game" impression and root, root,
root for the home team.That's because
Stanford needs three other teams to
win in order to clinch a Rose Bowl
berth and all three will be playing at
home.
First of all, the top two teams in the
Pac-10 at the moment, Oregon and
Arizona, will face off in Tucson with
ESPN's College Gameday on hand.
Stanford's only realistic shot at going
to the Rose Bowl is for Arizona to beat
Oregon at home. This result seemed a
lot more likely before Arizona lost at
Cal, but Arizona has a high-powered
offense and should have a great home
field advantage. Currently, Oregon is
