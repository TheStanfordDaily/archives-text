# Card edged by Cal, looks to NCAAs
## 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
A positive regular season for the
Stanford Cardinal (10-5-2,4-4-2 Pac-10)
came to a bittersweet ending when the
team dropped a hard-fought loss to the
California Golden Bears on Saturday
night by a final score of 1-0.
With a physical style of play befitting
any Stanford/Cal game, blows were
given and received by both sides. Thirty
two fouls were called and five yellow
cards were passed out as players on both
sides of the field fought for possession.
"I think it was more than normal,but
it wasn't out of control, said Stanford
Head Coach Brett Simon. "It was a very
competitive game, although Stanford
and Cal are typically on the low end of
yellow cards during the season."

Cal (9-8-1, 3-6-1 Pac-10) exerted
pressure early with high, deep balls into
the Stanford end that forced defenders
to make frequent clears. When they set
tled down, the game ended up being a
fight for possession between the two
teams.

"Both Cal and Stanford are typically
possession-oriented teams," Simon said.
"They made it difficult for us to keep the
ball. I think we had more possession, a
few more shots, especially in the second
half but the game was very even."
The lone goal of the game came
when Cal senior defender Jacob Wilson
received a pass from Cal junior forward
Andrew Wiedeman. Wilson then beat a
Stanford defender and shot past senior
goalkeeper John Moore for the score at
the 21st minute. It was Wilson's first goal
of the season.
"Our game plan changed a little bit
after the goal," said senior Captain
Michael Strickland. "We man-marked
everyone across the field because we felt
like we were better than them man-to
man and just pressured them every
where. If everyone beats their player,

then we can create chances."
The strategy seemed to work. Stan
ford managed several strong opportuni
ties on goal, especially in the second half
Stanford forward Adam Jahn had an
early chance at a header, but Cal keeper
David Bingham was there for the save.
Stanford outshot Cal 7-3 in the second
half but Bingham played too well. He
had five saves for the day to record his
fourth shutout of the season.
In a final push toward the end of reg
ulation, Strickland passed across the
goal to find Stanford midfielder/for
ward Dersu Abolfathi. His shot was de
flected right at Bingham, who was able
to make the save.
"Losing to Cal is always rough," says

GARNER KROPP/The Stanford Daily
The Cardinal's solid season - a big turnaround from last year - concluded with
a frustrating loss to rival Cal last weekend. Spirits remain high, however, as Stanford is set to play in its first NCAA Tournament game since 2002 on Thursday.

Strickland. "We were asleep for the first
20 minutes and they rushed the game.
Of course it hurts."
The disappointment of the loss
doesn't take away any of the credit that
is due to this year's team. The Cardinal
reached a double-digit win total for the
first time since 2002.The team leads the
conference in shutout percentage
(0.44) and achieved a season-high rank
ing of 17 in the NSCAA poll.
Saturday was Senior Night for four
important players on the team. Michael
Strickland, John Moore, Evan Morgan
and T.J. Novak all played their last reg
ular season game and will be graduat
ing after this season.
"I think the guys have fought so
hard every game, and every game has
been so challenging," Simon said.
"I don't want to look back yet,"
Strickland said. "We still have the most
important part of the season coming up.
So far, it's been a great ride. In the mid
dle of the stretch, when we went on a
five-game winning streak, it really set us
up for a tough Pac-10 schedule. Hope
fully all that preparation will show in
the postseason."
Stanford was chosen to play Saint
Mary's this Thursday at 7 p.m. at Cagan
Stadium in the first round of NCAA play.
