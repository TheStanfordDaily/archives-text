## Bike sharing implemented in Santa Clara 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Santa Clara County's Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) is speeding past the city of
San Francisco in implementing the first public
bike share program in the Bay Area. One push
of the pedal or rather, two pushes away
from joining the host of European cities that
already have such a program, the VTA has
already completed a third of the planning
process for a projected pilot date in 2010.
Research for the pilot program, which con
nects the cities of Mountain View, Palo Alto
and San Jose via their respective Caltrain sta
tions, began early last April with a market
research plan to conduct over 1,200 surveys at
target areas. An initial $75,000 was devoted to
hiring market and financial consulting groups
for this portion of planning the program.
Completion of the project's business model
and release of its final analysis report remain.
The VTA has applied for a $500,000 Safe
Rotes to Transit grant to execute the pilot pro
gram, which will feature 'pods' at the three sta
tions and at destinations points around those
areas, such as Stanford and San Jose State
Universities as well as job centers. Though the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission
(MTC), the committee that will fund the grant,
will not release decisions until the end of this
year, Aiko Cuenco, project manager for the
Bike Share Pilot Program, says the VTA "has
the highest ranked project" and is confident
that they will get the necessary financial
resources.
"We researched all the existing programs to
see what people are doing and how it's work
ing for them and what things can be improved
upon," Cuenco said. "We do think that we can
address some of the problems that are present
in Santa Clara County."
One of the main hindrances to commuting
that has emerged in the past year,
according to Cuenco, stems from
overcrowding of cyclists on the
Caltrains. Since only one car is
reserved for commuters who plan to
bring a bicycle onto the train, limited
space means some bikers often get
"bumped" and have to wait for the
next train.
"I'm sure it's discouraged some
people ... because they would have
to show up really early or push
through to make their way on board
and make sure that their bike is on
board with them," Cuenco said.
Additionally, bike sharing can
also alleviate the parking difficulties.
According to Cuenco, many bikers
usually take their bikes with them in
order to prevent stealing, vandalism
and damage, as well as out of com
muting necessity. However, Caltrain
stations also have an inadequate
number of bike lockers and bike sta
tions, the safest places to park bikes.
"[With bike sharing], there's no
need to think about parking or
bringing a bike on board or how to
complete that trip on the other end
'the first and last mile problem'
people have with commuting,"
Cuenco said.
To further assure bike security,
the VTA headed a technology
review of existing programs' tracking
software and systems to employ the
most advanced locking and tracking
systems for the program's bicycles,
which will be tied to the customers'
credit card information.
Costs to residents partaking in
this "rent-a-bike" program will fol

low precedents set by pre-existing
bike share programs in Europe,
which offer customers a range of dif
ferent options from daily passes with
prices between $1 and $5, to annual
ones between $7O and $l2O. The first
half hour of use will be free, a time
frame that was determined by stud
ies to be the average length of a typ
ical commute by bike.
While Stanford is part of the proj
ect consulting group that the VTA
established last April, the impact that
this bike share program will have on
the University is still uncertain.
"At this point, we need to wait
and see what VTA is proposing," said
Brodie Hamilton, Director of
Parking & Transportation Services.
"Stanford is in an interesting posi
tion where we already have so many
bikes and many people already com
mute by bike,"
A number of similar bike share
programs are already available at the
campus bike shop, alumni center and
certain academic departments for
students, visiting alumni and faculty,
respectively.
Despite complications presented
by the campus' bike-heavy charac
ter, Cuenco still believes the bike
share program can provide some
benefits to students "who wanted to
venture out."
"If they want to go shopping or
eat out or go to the movies or some
place outside of campus and don't
really know where they could place
their bike, then bike share can open
up the city of Palo Alto and a little
bit beyond," Cuenco said. "That
could open up the world that they
travel in because I know they're kind
of enclosed and limited on campus."
