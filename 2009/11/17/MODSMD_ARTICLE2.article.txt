## Bike sharing implemented in Santa Clara 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Santa Clara County's Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) is speeding past the city of
San Francisco in implementing the first public
bike share program in the Bay Area. One push
of the pedal or rather, two pushes away
from joining the host of European cities that
already have such a program, the VTA has
already completed a third of the planning
process for a projected pilot date in 2010.
Research for the pilot program, which con
nects the cities of Mountain View, Palo Alto
and San Jose via their respective Caltrain sta
tions, began early last April with a market
research plan to conduct over 1,200 surveys at
target areas. An initial $75,000 was devoted to
hiring market and financial consulting groups
for this portion of planning the program.
Completion of the project's business model
and release of its final analysis report remain.
The VTA has applied for a $500,000 Safe
Rotes to Transit grant to execute the pilot pro
gram, which will feature 'pods' at the three sta
tions and at destinations points around those
areas, such as Stanford and San Jose State
Universities as well as job centers. Though the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission
(MTC), the committee that will fund the grant,
will not release decisions until the end of this
year, Aiko Cuenco, project manager for the
Bike Share Pilot Program, says the VTA "has
the highest ranked project" and is confident
that they will get the necessary financial
resources.
"We researched all the existing programs to
see what people are doing and how it's work
ing for them and what things can be improved
upon," Cuenco said. "We do think that we can
address some of the problems that are present
in Santa Clara County."
