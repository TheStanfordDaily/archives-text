# Field hockey's dream season ends
## 
### ALISSA HABER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 14 Stanford women's field hockey
team ended its season this past weekend with a
loss to Princeton in the first round of the NCAA
tournament.
The loss, however, does not take away from
what has proven to be the Cardinal's best season in
school history (17-5,5-1 NorPac).
The club's 17 wins on the season was a school
record. The Cardinal also captured its third
straight NorPac Conference crown and was a
mainstay in the national rankings for over two
months.
After a thrilling overtime victory against
Boston University in a play-in game last Tuesday,
Stanford had plenty of momentum going into the
first round of the tournament as it met up with
Princeton over the weekend. However, the Cardi
nal's luck ran out against the Tigers the tourna
ment's No. 4 overall seed as they shut out Stan
ford 4-0, marking the first time the Cardinal had
been shut out the entire season.
Stanford is now 0-9 in the NCAA tournament.
This record is independent of the Cardinal's 2-1
record in play-in games.
Stanford's normally high-powered offense, a
major contribution to the Cardinal's success the
entire season, was stifled by the Tigers' tough de
fense. Stanford was held to only four shots for the
entire match, and the Princeton defense was able
to neutralize two of Stanford's largest offense
threats, as junior Xanthe Travlos and freshman
Becky Dru the NorPac Player of the Year and
Rookie of the Year, respectively did not record
a shot attempt during the entire match.
Along with the 25-4 shot advantage on the
match, the Tigers also edged the Cardinal 5-2 in
penalty corners.
The teams were locked in a scoreless tie for the
majority of the first half. Princeton finally scored
its first goal in the 30th minute when sophomore
Katie Reinprecht found the back of the cage. Se

nior Christina Bortz would score a quick goal with
17 seconds left in the first half to give the Tigers a
commanding 2-0 lead after the first 35 minutes.
The Tigers would add on two more goals in the
second half, while the Cardinal would only record
one shot attempt in the final 35 minutes.
Stanford was lead by senior Midori Uehara,
who recorded two shot attempts. Juniors Jaimee
Erickson and Camille Ghandi each recorded a
shot as well.
Sophomore goalkeeper Alessandra Moss also
had an impressive last outing, despite allowing the
four Tiger goals. In the first half, Moss recorded 10
saves to keep the Cardinal in the game. She also
denied Princeton's shot on a penalty stroke in the
second half, making her five for nine in penalty
stroke chances in her first two years, one of the
best marks in the nation.
Despite the loss, the Cardinal has a lot of posi
tives to consider at season's end. Head Coach Les
ley Irvine, the NorPac Coach of the Year for the
second time in three years, noted her team's ac
complishments this season.
"I am very proud of the way the team per
formed this season," Irvine said. "The level of
focus, hard work, talent and leadership was the
key."
Stanford's nationally ranked offense set single
season school records in goals (87), assists (60),
points (234) and shots (410). The Cardinal
outscored its opponents 87-36 on the season and
out shot them 410-220.
Travlos, the NorPac offensive player of the
year, led the Cardinal offense with 17 goals on the
year, the most goals scored by a Stanford player
since Sara Hallock's 25 goals in 1993.
Becky Dru also had an impressive season with
13 goals, 7 assists and 67 shots, numbers that gar
nered NorPac Rookie of the Year honors.
Senior Nora Soza and Erickson both ended the
season among the nation's leaders in assists with
17 and 14 respectively.
Saturday's contest was the final game in Cardi
nal red for seniors Soza, Uehara, Rachel Bush,

Jennifer Luther, Mariana Shile and Rachel
Mozenter. But their efforts, and the success of the
2009 campaign as a whole, will not be soon forgot
ten by the Cardinal as it looks to 2010.
"They have helped to raise the bar for future
teams," Irvine said.

postives. The team broke the school record for wins and
