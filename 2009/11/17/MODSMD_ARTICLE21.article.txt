# Both squads running strong
## Men take West women place third 
### JULIA BROWNELL ANARGHYA VARDHANA 
The Stanford cross country teams
came out with strong performances at
the NCAA West Regionals on Satur
day, with the men and women taking
first and third, respectively.
The men continued their season
long dominance with a huge win. The
Cardinal claimed the top three finishing
spots as Chris Derrick and Elliott
Heath crossed the line with near identi
cal times of 30 minutes, 38 seconds, fol
lowed closely by Justin Maripole-Bird
at 30:42. Brendan Gregg in 10th and
Miles Unterriener in 13th rounded out
the scoring for Stanford.
The Cardinal recorded a stunning
27 points to University of Portland's 84
and Oregon's 109, completely blowing
out the competition.
The team didn't attribute this domi
nance to an outlandish run on its part,
but rather attributed the extent of the
victory to the lackluster performance of
its competitors.
"I don't feel like we ran out of our
minds, or something we couldn't repli
cate," Derrick said. "Some people just
faded down the stretch."
The men ran with apparent ease,
with Derrick and Heath breaking away
from the pack down the stretch and
Maripole-Bird edging out UCSB and
University of Portland's top runners
near the finish line. The runners took
this as a fun 10,000 meters in prepara
tion for their national championship
run in Indiana on Monday.
"[lt was] pretty relaxed," Derrick
said. "It's not often you get to enjoy the
10K in cross country. Most of the time it
hurts too much, but this time we did."
Even in the win, the men were down
one runner as season-long scorer Jake
Riley sat the race out due to injury in
order to prepare for nationals. Howev
er, the team still performed in top form
due to the incredible depth of scorers.
"We're confident with the depth of
our team this year," Heath said. "We
weren't worried."
The men's team clinched an auto
matic bid to nationals with this win and
look to be riding a smooth record of
wins this season into the champi
onships. Stanford, ranked No. 1 in the
nation, will be the outright co-favorite
for a national title alongside Oklahoma
State.
"We're riding a really good momen
tum train thus far," Derrick said.
The women had a successful meet as
well, placing third with 94 points, right
behind No. 1 Washington and No. 5
Oregon. With two of their top runners,
freshman Kathy Kroeger and senior
Kate Niehaus, back and healthy, the
women were able to show their
prowess as a top running program.
The Cardinal women were led by
sophomore Stephanie Marcy, who has
been enjoying a consistently great sea
son. Marcy is currently the team's No. 1
runner, a first time for the Washington
native. Marcy completed the course
with a time of 21:09.67.
Freshman Alex Dunne was the next
runner to earn points for the team, fin
ishing in 15th place with a time of
21:21.08. Dunne was followed by
Niehaus in 17th with a time of 21:24.65,
and Kroeger in 19th with a time of
21:27.74. The last person to score for

Stanford was sophomore Georgia Grif
fin, who placed 34th with a time of
21:55.18.
Alex Gits, a season-longer scorer on
the team, was a last minute scratch and
did not run. Kristin Reese ran in her
place and finished 102 nd.
The meet was successful because
the Stanford women were able to uti
lize each other for support throughout
the race.
"Many of us were able to run to
gether in pairs and help motivate one
another as the race progressed," Dunne
said. "Not only is this form of pack run
ning intimidating, but it also demoral
izes other runners when they are passed

by two girls in the same uniform."
Next up for the team will be the final
competition of the season, the NCAA
Cross Country Championships in Terra
Haute, Ind., on Nov. 23. Currently
ranked No. 14 in the nation, the women
have a lot to prove at the champi
onships.
However, Dunne asserts, "an arbi
trary number determined by a group of
cross country 'experts' will never define
the team," and "only the team knows
how talented we truly are."

runner to earn points for the team, fin
ishing in 15th place with a time of
21:21.08. Dunne was followed by
Niehaus in 17th with a time of 21:24.65,
and Kroeger in 19th with a time of
21:27.74. The last person to score for

Stanford was sophomore Georgia Grif
fin, who placed 34th with a time of
21:55.18.
Alex Gits, a season-longer scorer on
the team, was a last minute scratch and
did not run. Kristin Reese ran in her
place and finished 102 nd.
The meet was successful because
the Stanford women were able to uti
lize each other for support throughout
the race.
"Many of us were able to run to
gether in pairs and help motivate one
another as the race progressed," Dunne
said. "Not only is this form of pack run
ning intimidating, but it also demoral
izes other runners when they are passed

by two girls in the same uniform."
Next up for the team will be the final
competition of the season, the NCAA
Cross Country Championships in Terra
Haute, Ind., on Nov. 23. Currently
ranked No. 14 in the nation, the women
have a lot to prove at the champi
onships.
However, Dunne asserts, "an arbi
trary number determined by a group of
cross country 'experts' will never define
the team," and "only the team knows
how talented we truly are."
