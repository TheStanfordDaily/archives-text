Harbaugh, Stanford close to deal
After mutually agreeing to post
pone contract extension negotiations
at the end of the last season due to the
economy. Athletic Director Bob
Bowlsby and Jim Harbaugh appear
close to a deal that would keep the
third-year football coach on the Farm
through the 2014 season.
Harbaugh is currently in the third
season of a five-year deal, but his early
success and rapid turn-around of the
No. 14 Stanford football program has,
in the eyes of Bowlsby if not the Car
dinal community at large, deemed him
worthy of a new contract.
The terms agreed to last winter
would give Harbaugh the most lucra
tive per-annum contract in Stanford
history. If those specifics hold, then he
would make $1.25 million per year.
While Harbaugh shrugged off
questions about contract negotiations
immediately after the Cardinal's 55-21
win over USC, he was more candid at
Monday's Big Game press conference.
"I believe Mr. Bowlsby and I will
have an announcement about [a new
contract] in the not-too-distant fu
ture," said Harbaugh.
Harbaugh has also been the
source of rumors since last winter, as
both NFL franchises and traditional
collegiate powerhouses have report
edly been interested in him; a new
contract would theoretically improve
Stanford's chances of retaining his
services.
However, Harbaugh has expressed
nothing but affection for the Universi
ty, often reiterating his commitment to
his players and the school's academic
mission, all while keeping his primary
goal to build a national title con
tender in mind.
"I love Stanford. I love Stanford
football. I love the stadium, our tradi
tion, our players, our coaches," Har
baugh said Monday. "I hope I have the
honor of coaching at Stanford for a
very long time."
