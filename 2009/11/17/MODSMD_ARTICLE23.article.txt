# Offensive line, instincts keep Luck on his feet
## 
### 
Among the Cardinal's many im
pressive offensive statistics, few are
more buried than sacks allowed per
game. Currently, Stanford ranks sec
ond in the nation in that category, giv
ing up just 0.6 sacks per contest. The
two main reasons: stellar offensive line
play and the football intelligence of
quarterback Andrew Luck.
There is no better example than
the recent victory over then-No. 11
USC. Against an aggressive offensive
front, the relatively young Cardinal
line, which counts two redshirt fresh
men among its starters, persevered for
the entire 60 minutes. From Jonathan
Martin pulling from his left tackle slot
to Andrew Phillips mauling defenders
at left guard, Stanford's blockers kept
Luck on his feet. Though not highly
touted at the beginning of the year, the
line has embodied Harbaugh's blue
collar work ethic they dubbed
themselves the TWU, or the Tunnel
Workers Union and has emerged
as clearly the best unit in the confer
ence. It's deep, too, as reserves Bert

Mc√üride and James McGillicuddy
often come in for the seven-man diesel
packages.
"It's hard to give them too much
love or too much respect," Harbaugh
said. "They're playing physically and
with confidence. Everyone benefits
from the way they're playing."
One of those benefactors is Luck,
who rushed for 61 yards on seven car
ries: one went for a touchdown, four
went for first downs. Only one, a zone
read on the scoring scamper, was de
signed. The rest were the result of
good blocking and heads up play by
the young signal caller. Luck's inter
nal clock is almost visible. His recog
nition of the defensive schemes and
ability to step up in the pocket puts
both run and pass on the table and is a
talent generally unforeseen in fresh
man quarterbacks. Though certainly a
drop-back passer, Luck is conscious
enough to see when he has an oppor
tunity to make a play with his feet
simply put, he's opportunistic. This,
combined with his mobility and
speed, makes him remarkably tough
to bring down.
Luck seems to take sacks only when
the pocket collapses from the snap and
there is little else he can do, but given
how the offensive line has played this
year, such instances are rare.
