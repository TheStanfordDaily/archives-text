## Medical School joins Research Match 
### TROY YANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford researchers will now benefit from a
unique Internet matchmaking service, which will
connect them with volunteers for their often
hard-to-fill studies.
ResearchMatch.org is a secure online tool
that brings together two groups of people: vol
unteers who are interested in research studies
and researchers who are looking for volunteers

to participate in their studies.
As a member of the Clinical and
Translational Science Awards Consortium
(CTSA), Stanford University School of
Medicine is one of 46 medical research institu
tions participating in the service.
Led by the National Center for Research
Resources of the National Institutes of Health,
the consortium's new program is the first of its
kind in the United States. At Stanford,
Research Match is being coordinated by

Spectrum, an interdisciplinary group formed to
bridge the gap between medical research and
patient care that has been expanding since its
foundation in 2005.
"More studies in pediatrics fail because of
inadequate enrollment than because of any
other reason," said pediatric nephrology Prof.
Steven Alexander, Spectrum's medical direc
tor.
Under this program, people inter
ested in volunteering in studies will no
longer have to dig through the
Internet to find specific studies to par
ticipate in. Instead, by signing up as a
member on Research Match, volun
teers will be matched with both local
and nationwide research studies that
they are interested in and qualified for.
At Stanford, anywhere from 800
to 1,000 active clinical studies on
diverse subjects ranging from pancre
atic cancer in adults to obesity in ado
lescents are going on at any one time.
About 250 to 300 new clinical studies
begin each year. In order to reach a
statistically significant conclusion, vol
unteers are needed for each of these
studies.
"Personally, you're fortunate if
you can reach 50 percent of your
enrollment targets in a study involv
ing children," Alexander said.
"Recently Spectrum looked at
Stanford, and 50 percent enrollment
was a successful study. Enrollment
targets are very hard to meet."
At the University, the chief liaisons
for this program are Alexander and

Jennifer Brown, Spectrum's manager
of regulatory services and education.
Both coordinators are excited about
prospects for this program, which
they believe will facilitate clinical
research in a groundbreaking way.
"Finding patients to participate in
studies is typically a very difficult
process," Brown said. "Any tool like
this that will help our researchers at
Stanford have access to more poten
tial participants is very important."
In the future, connecting clinical
researchers to volunteers may not be
the only function of Research Match;
according to Alexander, it may also
serve as away for researchers nation
wide to collaborate.
Brown also said other depart
ments, such as sociology and psychol
ogy, and any researchers who require
human volunteers may eventually
take advantage of the service.
"[ResearchMatch] will bring the
opportunity to participate in research
to more people," said Alexander, who
believes volunteers gain more than a
small sum of money from participat
ing in research. "I think there are
many willing volunteers out there
who just don't know how to get
involved."
