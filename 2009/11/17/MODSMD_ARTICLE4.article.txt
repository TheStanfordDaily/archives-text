## Medical School joins Research Match 
### TROY YANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford researchers will now benefit from a
unique Internet matchmaking service, which will
connect them with volunteers for their often
hard-to-fill studies.
ResearchMatch.org is a secure online tool
that brings together two groups of people: vol
unteers who are interested in research studies
and researchers who are looking for volunteers

to participate in their studies.
As a member of the Clinical and
Translational Science Awards Consortium
(CTSA), Stanford University School of
Medicine is one of 46 medical research institu
tions participating in the service.
Led by the National Center for Research
Resources of the National Institutes of Health,
the consortium's new program is the first of its
kind in the United States. At Stanford,
Research Match is being coordinated by

Spectrum, an interdisciplinary group formed to
bridge the gap between medical research and
patient care that has been expanding since its
foundation in 2005.
"More studies in pediatrics fail because of
inadequate enrollment than because of any
other reason," said pediatric nephrology Prof.
Steven Alexander, Spectrum's medical direc
tor.
