# Veterans on the Farm
## Small, tight-knit veterans community discuss military experience and future 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Stanford students have a range of
unique experiences, and campus veterans
are no exception.
According to Assistant University
Registrar Celeste Fowles, 36 students,
either veterans or their dependents, are
receiving veterans' benefits, including 26
on the Chapter 33 Post 9/11 G.I. Bill and,
among those, 19 on the Yellow Ribbon
Program.
The majority of veteran students are in
Stanford's graduate programs, with the
highest concentration in the Graduate
School of Business (GSB). Only seven
undergraduates are veterans.
Most students who are veterans cite the
military as a defining experience in their
life that, in some form, has shaped their
career aspirations and academic goals at
Stanford.
"I had multiple reasons for joining the
army, aside from wanting to do my part,"
said Jeffrey Arnold 'lO, who may be taking
an extra year at Stanford. "I wanted to go
back to school, and the educational bene
fits of the military are pretty good."
Arnold graduated from high school in
1995 and joined the military when he was
25 years old. He attributes his current edu
cation to his time in the military, saying, "If
it were not for the time I spent in the army,
I wouldn't be at Stanford."
Considering the unique experience that
is enlisting and being deployed with the
military, student veterans are a tight-knit
group.
"As far as the undergraduates go, we
[veterans] pretty much all know each
other," Arnold said.
While they don't cite major difficulties
adjusting back to student life, they have
made a clear distinction between skills
needed and developed in the military ver
sus those used at school.
"The skill sets that are in the military
are completely different from what I use in
academics for the most part," Arnold said.
"But there are times when it's come in
handy," Arnold added. "I'm a physics
major, so some of the work I've been
doing research on requires knowledge
about machines and knowing how to build
and repair things. I was a mechanic in the
army, so I've got hands-on experience."
William Treseder 'lO, a Marine who is
currently majoring in Science, Technology
and Society, agrees that the skills learned
in the military are not easily adaptable to

the academy. However, he has found one
skill from his military background useful at
school.
"You learn in the military to think one
or two echelons above where you are,"
Treseder said. "So a lot of the time when
I'm in class, I'm often thinking about how
the professor is thinking about the materi
al — what are they really trying to teach
us?"
A veteran and current student at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB) who
spoke on the condition of anonymity also
looks back fondly on his experience in the
military.
"Military guys tend to be really humble
about their service and their leadership,"
the veteran said. "In school, there's more
of this sense of entitlement, sometimes
even disrespect toward professors."
"Being in the military has shaped the
way I see my future career," the veteran
added. "I'll never be able to do a job that
doesn't serve my countiy. Right now, I'm
looking into energy, biotech or infrastruc
ture,"
With positive reflections on their mili
tary experience, most veteran students
lament the lack of Reserve Officers'
Training Corp. (ROTC) and knowledge
about career options in the military on
campus.
"It's disgraceful that Stanford doesn't
have ROTC," the anonymous veteran
said. "All military service has Enlisted
Commission Programs, which give stu
dents the opportunity to go to college."
The veteran pointed out three specific
ways Stanford could improve its support
of the veteran community: lending greater
support to the Yellow Ribbon Program,
letting ROTC back on campus and granti
ng admission to more veteran applicants.
Treseder agrees that Stanford could do
more to admit veterans.
"I hear from people in admission, pro
fessors; they all tend to say, transfer veter
an students are so interesting, they have
very interesting perspectives," said
Treseder, who is forming a group for
admitted veterans. "I think each additional
person that comes from a nontraditional
background will add a lot to the diversity
of the University, just like I think the inter
national students add a lot."
Gabriel Zamora 'll, who finished his
third tour in Iraq in 2005 and transferred
to Stanford this quarter from community
college, also believes Stanford could bene-
fit from more veterans on campus.
"One of the things that Stanford
preaches and talks about is diversity
on campus," Zamora said. "A veteran
group should definitely be a part of
that; veterans are exposed to different
experiences.
"A veteran is like a student from
another culture," Zamora added.
"The military is another culture,"
Still, veterans give credit to
Stanford for being supportive toward
the existing veteran student commu
nity.
"During NSO, the University
comes to the veterans and asks what
they can do to help improve what
they're trying to do for veterans. They

ask us for feedback on how to make it
better and improve the information
that veterans can receive if they're
looking to apply to Stanford,"
Zamora said.
Arnold said the Stanford adminis
tration "goes out of its way" to accom
modate the veteran community.
"William [Treseder]'s efforts with
the students veterans group, getting
guest speakers, having events and
holding talks we've never met any
sort of resistance from the University
at all," Arnold said. "Everyone reg
istrar's office, admission will do
everything they can to help or accom
modate us."

One such veteran's group event,
called "Military 101," was held
Thursday, Nov. 12. The 90-minute
presentation was conducted by the
Truman National Security Project, a
national leadership institute aiming to
inform a new generation of students

about national security issues.
"We're basically trying to get folks
at schools to understand the military,"
said Paul Clarke, the regional Bay
Area director for Truman Fellows.
"We're not trying to recruit and we're
not a military group per se, though the
people who teach the 'class' are veter
ans."
The Truman project staff is com
posed of members of the military, aid
workers and human rights activists,
among others. Truman project organ
izers decided to come to Stanford to
talk about "Military 101" because,
according to Clarke, "very few stu
dents at elite universities go on to
have experience with the military,"
and because Stanford's connection
with the military has decreased over
time.
"There used to be a time when
almost every male student would be
in ROTC and could have gone off to

war," Clarke said. "We're trying to
make up for some of that. A lot of
people don't understand the military
anymore,"

dents the opportunity to go to college."
The veteran pointed out three specific
ways Stanford could improve its support
of the veteran community: lending greater
support to the Yellow Ribbon Program,
letting ROTC back on campus and granti
ng admission to more veteran applicants.
Treseder agrees that Stanford could do
more to admit veterans.
"I hear from people in admission, pro
fessors; they all tend to say, transfer veter
an students are so interesting, they have
very interesting perspectives," said
Treseder, who is forming a group for
admitted veterans. "I think each additional
person that comes from a nontraditional
background will add a lot to the diversity
of the University, just like I think the inter
national students add a lot."
Gabriel Zamora 'll, who finished his
third tour in Iraq in 2005 and transferred
to Stanford this quarter from community
college, also believes Stanford could bene-
fit from more veterans on campus.
"One of the things that Stanford
preaches and talks about is diversity
on campus," Zamora said. "A veteran
group should definitely be a part of
that; veterans are exposed to different
experiences.
"A veteran is like a student from
another culture," Zamora added.
"The military is another culture,"
Still, veterans give credit to
Stanford for being supportive toward
the existing veteran student commu
nity.
"During NSO, the University
comes to the veterans and asks what
they can do to help improve what
they're trying to do for veterans. They

ask us for feedback on how to make it
better and improve the information
that veterans can receive if they're
looking to apply to Stanford,"
Zamora said.
Arnold said the Stanford adminis
tration "goes out of its way" to accom
modate the veteran community.
"William [Treseder]'s efforts with
the students veterans group, getting
guest speakers, having events and
holding talks we've never met any
sort of resistance from the University
at all," Arnold said. "Everyone reg
istrar's office, admission will do
everything they can to help or accom
modate us."

One such veteran's group event,
called "Military 101," was held
Thursday, Nov. 12. The 90-minute
presentation was conducted by the
Truman National Security Project, a
national leadership institute aiming to
inform a new generation of students

about national security issues.
"We're basically trying to get folks
at schools to understand the military,"
said Paul Clarke, the regional Bay
Area director for Truman Fellows.
"We're not trying to recruit and we're
not a military group per se, though the
people who teach the 'class' are veter
ans."
The Truman project staff is com
posed of members of the military, aid
workers and human rights activists,
among others. Truman project organ
izers decided to come to Stanford to
talk about "Military 101" because,
according to Clarke, "very few stu
dents at elite universities go on to
have experience with the military,"
and because Stanford's connection
with the military has decreased over
time.
"There used to be a time when
almost every male student would be
in ROTC and could have gone off to

war," Clarke said. "We're trying to
make up for some of that. A lot of
people don't understand the military
anymore,"

Stanford students have a range of
unique experiences, and campus veterans
are no exception.
According to Assistant University
Registrar Celeste Fowles, 36 students,
either veterans or their dependents, are
receiving veterans' benefits, including 26
on the Chapter 33 Post 9/11 G.I. Bill and,
among those, 19 on the Yellow Ribbon
Program.
The majority of veteran students are in
Stanford's graduate programs, with the
highest concentration in the Graduate
School of Business (GSB). Only seven
undergraduates are veterans.
Most students who are veterans cite the
military as a defining experience in their
life that, in some form, has shaped their
career aspirations and academic goals at
Stanford.
"I had multiple reasons for joining the
army, aside from wanting to do my part,"
said Jeffrey Arnold 'lO, who may be taking
an extra year at Stanford. "I wanted to go
back to school, and the educational bene
fits of the military are pretty good."
Arnold graduated from high school in
1995 and joined the military when he was
25 years old. He attributes his current edu
cation to his time in the military, saying, "If
it were not for the time I spent in the army,
I wouldn't be at Stanford."
Considering the unique experience that
is enlisting and being deployed with the
military, student veterans are a tight-knit
group.
"As far as the undergraduates go, we
[veterans] pretty much all know each
other," Arnold said.
While they don't cite major difficulties
adjusting back to student life, they have
made a clear distinction between skills
needed and developed in the military ver
sus those used at school.
"The skill sets that are in the military
are completely different from what I use in
academics for the most part," Arnold said.
"But there are times when it's come in
handy," Arnold added. "I'm a physics
major, so some of the work I've been
doing research on requires knowledge
about machines and knowing how to build
and repair things. I was a mechanic in the
army, so I've got hands-on experience."
William Treseder 'lO, a Marine who is
currently majoring in Science, Technology
and Society, agrees that the skills learned
in the military are not easily adaptable to

the academy. However, he has found one
skill from his military background useful at
school.
"You learn in the military to think one
or two echelons above where you are,"
Treseder said. "So a lot of the time when
I'm in class, I'm often thinking about how
the professor is thinking about the materi
al — what are they really trying to teach
us?"
A veteran and current student at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB) who
spoke on the condition of anonymity also
looks back fondly on his experience in the
military.
"Military guys tend to be really humble
about their service and their leadership,"
the veteran said. "In school, there's more
of this sense of entitlement, sometimes
even disrespect toward professors."
"Being in the military has shaped the
way I see my future career," the veteran
added. "I'll never be able to do a job that
doesn't serve my countiy. Right now, I'm
looking into energy, biotech or infrastruc
ture,"
With positive reflections on their mili
tary experience, most veteran students
lament the lack of Reserve Officers'
Training Corp. (ROTC) and knowledge
about career options in the military on
campus.
"It's disgraceful that Stanford doesn't
have ROTC," the anonymous veteran
said. "All military service has Enlisted
Commission Programs, which give stu
dents the opportunity to go to college."
The veteran pointed out three specific

of the veteran community: lending greater
support to the Yellow Ribbon Program,
