# Veterans on the Farm
## Small, tight-knit veterans community discuss military experience and future 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Stanford students have a range of
unique experiences, and campus veterans
are no exception.
According to Assistant University
Registrar Celeste Fowles, 36 students,
either veterans or their dependents, are
receiving veterans' benefits, including 26
on the Chapter 33 Post 9/11 G.I. Bill and,
among those, 19 on the Yellow Ribbon
Program.
The majority of veteran students are in
Stanford's graduate programs, with the
highest concentration in the Graduate
School of Business (GSB). Only seven
undergraduates are veterans.
Most students who are veterans cite the
military as a defining experience in their
life that, in some form, has shaped their
career aspirations and academic goals at
Stanford.
"I had multiple reasons for joining the
army, aside from wanting to do my part,"
said Jeffrey Arnold 'lO, who may be taking
an extra year at Stanford. "I wanted to go
back to school, and the educational bene
fits of the military are pretty good."
Arnold graduated from high school in
1995 and joined the military when he was
25 years old. He attributes his current edu
cation to his time in the military, saying, "If
it were not for the time I spent in the army,
I wouldn't be at Stanford."
Considering the unique experience that
is enlisting and being deployed with the
military, student veterans are a tight-knit
group.
"As far as the undergraduates go, we
[veterans] pretty much all know each
other," Arnold said.
While they don't cite major difficulties
adjusting back to student life, they have
made a clear distinction between skills
needed and developed in the military ver
sus those used at school.
"The skill sets that are in the military
are completely different from what I use in
academics for the most part," Arnold said.
"But there are times when it's come in
handy," Arnold added. "I'm a physics
major, so some of the work I've been
doing research on requires knowledge
about machines and knowing how to build
and repair things. I was a mechanic in the
army, so I've got hands-on experience."
William Treseder 'lO, a Marine who is
currently majoring in Science, Technology
and Society, agrees that the skills learned
in the military are not easily adaptable to

the academy. However, he has found one
skill from his military background useful at
school.
"You learn in the military to think one
or two echelons above where you are,"
Treseder said. "So a lot of the time when
I'm in class, I'm often thinking about how
the professor is thinking about the materi
al â€” what are they really trying to teach
us?"
A veteran and current student at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB) who
spoke on the condition of anonymity also
looks back fondly on his experience in the
military.
"Military guys tend to be really humble
about their service and their leadership,"
the veteran said. "In school, there's more
of this sense of entitlement, sometimes
even disrespect toward professors."
"Being in the military has shaped the
way I see my future career," the veteran
added. "I'll never be able to do a job that
doesn't serve my countiy. Right now, I'm
looking into energy, biotech or infrastruc
ture,"
With positive reflections on their mili
tary experience, most veteran students
lament the lack of Reserve Officers'
Training Corp. (ROTC) and knowledge
about career options in the military on
campus.
"It's disgraceful that Stanford doesn't
have ROTC," the anonymous veteran
said. "All military service has Enlisted
Commission Programs, which give stu
dents the opportunity to go to college."
The veteran pointed out three specific
ways Stanford could improve its support
of the veteran community: lending greater
support to the Yellow Ribbon Program,
letting ROTC back on campus and granti
ng admission to more veteran applicants.
Treseder agrees that Stanford could do
more to admit veterans.
"I hear from people in admission, pro
fessors; they all tend to say, transfer veter
an students are so interesting, they have
very interesting perspectives," said
Treseder, who is forming a group for
admitted veterans. "I think each additional
person that comes from a nontraditional
background will add a lot to the diversity
of the University, just like I think the inter
national students add a lot."
Gabriel Zamora 'll, who finished his
third tour in Iraq in 2005 and transferred
to Stanford this quarter from community
college, also believes Stanford could bene-
