## Athletics cuts may endanger teams Budgets down $8 million means tight financial belt 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
As a Pac-10 powerhouse, Stanford
athletics has been able to boast that it has
both quantity and quality in its athletics
department. But with the economy in a
nosedive, Athletics Director Bob
Bowlsby isn't ruling out the possibility
that that might have to change.
"We've made reductions in all kinds
of different areas, from the way we trav
el to the number of people who travel, to
the frequency of mowing and marking
the fields, turning down thermostats to
reducing water consumption," Bowlsby
said. "We have reduced squad sizes
through management attrition. It's been
a hundred small things that have added

up."
According to Bowlsby, Stanford's ath
letic department sustained $8 million in
reductions last year and has had to
absorb five to six million dollars in cuts
this fiscal year.
To trim costs, the Athletics depart
ment implemented a broad series of lay
offs last March and has restructured the
agreements for 35 of its employees, said
Deputy Athletic Director Ray Purpur in
an e-mail to The Daily.
The department is doing everything it
can to tighten its financial belt, but
Bowlsby says all options are on the table,
including the possibility of pulling the
plug on some of Stanford's 35 athletic
teams.
"Cutting teams is the absolute course
of last resort," Bowlsby said. "We're
doing all the trimming we can in order to
avoid that."
Stanford's annual operating budget
$75 million for 35 athletics teams is

the second largest in the NCAA's
Division 1 grouping. It is surpassed only
by Ohio State, which fields 36 sports
teams and has a budget north of $lOO
million dollars. Cardinal athletes and
teams have raked in 409 individual titles,
the most of any program in the country,
and 97 NCAA team championships.
Bowlsby declined to comment on
which teams would get the axe if the
economy does not pick up, but said the
department will not eliminate any sports
that make money for the University.
Currently, Stanford spends the most
money on football, women's and men's
basketball, baseball and volleyball.
The athletic department's endowment
was valued at $4lO million in December
of 2008, down $lOO million from 2007.
The department's $8 million cut is part of
the 15 percent reduction each depart
ment was asked to sustain as a result of

the 27 percent decrease in the
University's endowment last year.
Despite the significant drop-off,
however, Stanford Athletics'
endowment is still the most affluent
in the country.
But Bowlsby is looking at every
alternative option, from revenue
enhancements to increased
fundraising, before pulling the plug
on any of Stanford's teams.
"Fundraising was down $2.3 mil
lion last year, and if it rebounds,
that will help," he said. "But we
have to look at all eventualities and,
as I say, reduction of sports offer
ings is one of those options. I can't
completely rule that out."
Bowlsby and Assistant Associate
Director of Budget Brian Talbott
was in Chicago this past weekend to
discuss athletic number-crunching
with other private schools also
weathering budget shortfalls.
