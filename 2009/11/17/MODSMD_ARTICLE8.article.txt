## DAILY DEVOTION Despite production nights that extend well into the a.m., editors, writers find community at The Daily 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI Editing by Chelsea Ma 
It's 10:46 p.m. at the Lorry I. Lokey Stanford Daily
building. Editors are seated around a common
table with laptops, reviewing content, editing for
mechanics and form, and preparing tomorrow's
issue for print. The Stanford Daily is bustling with
conversations about stories that need to come in
"ASAP" and the sound of ringing phones. But there's
also a surprising amount of laughter.
Every once in a while, an editor will take a break
from her or his work to contribute to the quote board, a
quirky white board that gives humorous glimpses into
the random conversations of sleep-deprived and highly
caffeinated college students who have been stuck in the
same room for far too long.
It's easy to take for granted that our student body has
its very own sophisticated, central news source. But
behind the scenes, writers and editors are up until as late
as 3:30 a.m. to produce the paper each day.
Working at The Daily often means accepting an alter
native, admittedly bizarre lifestyle that implies sacrifice
in all aspects of what it means to be a Stanford student.
Eric Messinger 'lO, managing editor of news,
described one of the ways The Daily has changed his
everyday life as a student. "I really appreciate and love
the times when I see my roommate," Messinger said.
"But they are very rare. The Daily is not really totally
compatible with my friends' schedules or my room
mate's schedule."

Working at The Daily can also make it more difficult
to have a normal social life.
"My nights are pretty much owned by The Daily,
except for Friday and Saturday," Messinger added.
Devin Banerjee 'll, editor in chief and president of
The Daily, similarly has anything but a typical dorm
experience late nights of putting out the paper often
mean crashing in the office.

"If I have schoolwork to do after a production, I'll
often sleep there," Banerjee admitted. "It's a comfort
able couch, it really is. And if you close the windows, it's
not cold at all. We have pillows there and we have a
blanket... It's actually a really great place to sleep."
For Banerjee, involvement in The Daily has also
impacted his academic options. As a student in the man
agement science and engineering department who also
has had significant nightly responsibilities at The Daily
for about a year, Banerjee has had to construct a very

rigid course schedule.
"I have a very strict four-year plan," Banerjee said.
"It's a big tradeoff, deciding to take on the editor posi
tion. I had to think about what I was giving up at the
time... I have to take fewer classes while editor in
chief, and I also did when I was deputy editor and man
aging editor."
Emma Trotter 'lO, managing editor of features,
described the day-to-day life of being an editor. "Figure
out what came in from the previous night and, if what I
was counting on coming in came in, e-mail the people
who dropped the ball, try to confirm that photos have
been taken, check in with the editors about whether the
stories are good or not that's all in the morning or
afternoon," Trotter said. "Once I come in, it's just a quick
matter of editing stories, hanging out with people and
then leaving."
Editors also often connect their day-to-day experi
ences to ideas for new stories. "I'll just be in the shower,
or biking around campus, or somebody mentions some
thing," Trotter explained. "You can turn almost anything
into a feature ... Features consumes my life. Whatever I
do, wherever I go, is a potential story idea."
Zach Zimmerman 'l2, managing editor of sports,
summed up how all of the editors seem to feel about
their commitment. "All in all, the benefits completely
outweigh the costs in this situation," he said.
Editors describe The Daily environment as a dynam
ic place to work.

"Everyone's pretty close because we're here so
much," Zimmerman said. "We laugh together and we
fight together, so it's kind of like a family in away. For

how much fun we have, I'm always surprised by how
well things run and how good the end product looks."
Messinger joked that The Daily office is a world of its
own. "It's a strange environment at The Daily," he said.
"Everyone here really cares about what they're doing ..
. We're probably sort of strange people, but we enjoy it
a lot."
Trotter describes how The Daily culture has changed
from previous years. "When I first started working as a
news desk editor, people didn't talk to each other as
much," Trotter said. "Some people hung out outside of
the office, but it definitely wasn't as inclusive as it is
now."
Trotter added that there are moments of tension, but
humor overrides it. "There are times when people snipe
at each other, people get on each other's nerves," she
said. "But in general, there's a lot of camaraderie and
inside jokes and essentially laughter that happens every
night."
Banerjee explained that although The Daily is fun, it
still is a professional organization at its core.
"It's fun, but at the same time we understand that we
are professional, and we are doing really important
work," Banerjee said. "It takes a lot for me to always
keep that in mind so that I don't lose track of our real
mission every night.
"If it weren't fun, I think it would really negatively
affect the work that we do," he added.
Staff members have found The Daily to be an excel
lent way to become deeply immersed in both the

"It's a comfortable
couch, it really is."
