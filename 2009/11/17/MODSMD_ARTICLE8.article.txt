## DAILY DEVOTION Despite production nights that extend well into the a.m., editors, writers find community at The Daily 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI Editing by Chelsea Ma 
It's 10:46 p.m. at the Lorry I. Lokey Stanford Daily
building. Editors are seated around a common
table with laptops, reviewing content, editing for
mechanics and form, and preparing tomorrow's
issue for print. The Stanford Daily is bustling with
conversations about stories that need to come in
"ASAP" and the sound of ringing phones. But there's
also a surprising amount of laughter.
Every once in a while, an editor will take a break
from her or his work to contribute to the quote board, a
quirky white board that gives humorous glimpses into
the random conversations of sleep-deprived and highly
caffeinated college students who have been stuck in the
same room for far too long.
It's easy to take for granted that our student body has
its very own sophisticated, central news source. But
behind the scenes, writers and editors are up until as late
as 3:30 a.m. to produce the paper each day.
Working at The Daily often means accepting an alter
native, admittedly bizarre lifestyle that implies sacrifice
in all aspects of what it means to be a Stanford student.
Eric Messinger 'lO, managing editor of news,
described one of the ways The Daily has changed his
everyday life as a student. "I really appreciate and love
the times when I see my roommate," Messinger said.
"But they are very rare. The Daily is not really totally
compatible with my friends' schedules or my room
mate's schedule."

Working at The Daily can also make it more difficult
to have a normal social life.
"My nights are pretty much owned by The Daily,
except for Friday and Saturday," Messinger added.
Devin Banerjee 'll, editor in chief and president of
The Daily, similarly has anything but a typical dorm
experience late nights of putting out the paper often
mean crashing in the office.

"If I have schoolwork to do after a production, I'll
often sleep there," Banerjee admitted. "It's a comfort
able couch, it really is. And if you close the windows, it's
not cold at all. We have pillows there and we have a
blanket... It's actually a really great place to sleep."
For Banerjee, involvement in The Daily has also
impacted his academic options. As a student in the man
agement science and engineering department who also
has had significant nightly responsibilities at The Daily
for about a year, Banerjee has had to construct a very

rigid course schedule.
"I have a very strict four-year plan," Banerjee said.
"It's a big tradeoff, deciding to take on the editor posi
tion. I had to think about what I was giving up at the
time... I have to take fewer classes while editor in
chief, and I also did when I was deputy editor and man
aging editor."
Emma Trotter 'lO, managing editor of features,
described the day-to-day life of being an editor. "Figure
out what came in from the previous night and, if what I
was counting on coming in came in, e-mail the people
who dropped the ball, try to confirm that photos have
been taken, check in with the editors about whether the
stories are good or not that's all in the morning or
afternoon," Trotter said. "Once I come in, it's just a quick
matter of editing stories, hanging out with people and
then leaving."
Editors also often connect their day-to-day experi
ences to ideas for new stories. "I'll just be in the shower,
or biking around campus, or somebody mentions some
thing," Trotter explained. "You can turn almost anything
into a feature ... Features consumes my life. Whatever I
do, wherever I go, is a potential story idea."
Zach Zimmerman 'l2, managing editor of sports,
summed up how all of the editors seem to feel about
their commitment. "All in all, the benefits completely
outweigh the costs in this situation," he said.
Editors describe The Daily environment as a dynam
ic place to work.

"Everyone's pretty close because we're here so
much," Zimmerman said. "We laugh together and we
fight together, so it's kind of like a family in away. For

how much fun we have, I'm always surprised by how
well things run and how good the end product looks."
Messinger joked that The Daily office is a world of its
own. "It's a strange environment at The Daily," he said.
"Everyone here really cares about what they're doing ..
. We're probably sort of strange people, but we enjoy it
a lot."
Trotter describes how The Daily culture has changed
from previous years. "When I first started working as a
news desk editor, people didn't talk to each other as
much," Trotter said. "Some people hung out outside of
the office, but it definitely wasn't as inclusive as it is
now."
Trotter added that there are moments of tension, but
humor overrides it. "There are times when people snipe
at each other, people get on each other's nerves," she
said. "But in general, there's a lot of camaraderie and
inside jokes and essentially laughter that happens every
night."
Banerjee explained that although The Daily is fun, it
still is a professional organization at its core.
"It's fun, but at the same time we understand that we
are professional, and we are doing really important
work," Banerjee said. "It takes a lot for me to always
keep that in mind so that I don't lose track of our real
mission every night.
"If it weren't fun, I think it would really negatively
affect the work that we do," he added.
Staff members have found The Daily to be an excel
lent way to become deeply immersed in both the

couch, it really is."

Stanford community and world
affairs. Ellie Titus 'll, the Tuesday
night news desk editor, described
her experience.
"I feel more engaged with
Stanford as a student than before,"
Titus said. "And I feel more aware
of what's going on around me...
I'm paying closer attention to our
community, and that enhances my
life as a student."
However, some aspects of pro
ducing the paper are less appealing
than others.
"There's a lot of technical nitty
gritty for editing that can get really
tedious, but it's just part of the job,"
Messinger said. "And when you see
stories the next day and you're
proud of how they read and look,
you realize it's worth it."
Sometimes, a frustrating aspect
of being an editor is keeping every
one in the section organized and on
track.
"There is one thing that I like
and hate at the same time, which is
sending nasty e-mails," Trotter said.
"Sometimes, I have to e-mail [writ
ers] five times before they respond."
Trotter described the art of send
ing reminder e-mails: start out
polite and crescendo to hostility as
writers go MIA.
"The desk editors appreciate my
nasty e-mail sending skill," she said.
"It's not something that I necessari
ly enjoy, but I have cultivated it and
I'm good at it at this point. I feel like
I'm doing it correctly."
Leaders in each of the editorial
sections all have their own vision of
how to improve the quality of the
paper and maintain its high stan
dards.
The Features section, for exam
ple, started out as 'Page 2,' only run
ning once a week. After Trotter
became managing editor, the sec
tion expanded to four days a week,
focusing on trends, profiles and nar
ratives.
"I took it and made it Features
and started the desk editors system
and just tried to make it more legit
imate," Trotter said. "I want to leave
something in place that will not just
collapse when I'm gone."
Messinger also has specific goals
for News. "One thing I was setting
out to do was make student govern
ment coverage a little less focused
on contention and bickering and
more about the substance of what
student government does,"
Messinger said. "Another thing I've
been trying to do is connect more

campus stories to national issues."
Zimmerman has been working
to broaden possibilities for writers
to develop their voices in sports
writing by increasing opportunities
for student columns.
Annika Heinle 'l2, managing
editor of fntermission, wants to
make the arts and entertainment
insert something that people look
forward to reading on Fridays. "A
lot of people complain about
always being in the Stanford bub
ble," she said. "1 think it's cool that
Stanford has the opportunity to
make sure everyone knows what's
going on in the entertainment
scene outside of Stanford."
When Banerjee ran to be editor
in chief, he wrote a 32-page plat
form outlining his plans for specif
ic areas of the paper which he con
tinues to translate into action. One
of his main goals is to nurture the
connection between The Daily and
its readers.
"A huge thematic change that I
wanted to implement was being
much more open with our readers
and our community," Banerjee
said. "The Daily was becoming
independent in a bad sense, in that
we were becoming more isolated
from the readers. That's why I'm
open to op-eds, letters to the edi
tor, just a lot of discussion."
This connection is in part being
developed through multimedia
tools such as Facebook, Twitter,
iPhone applications, online polls
and surveys, and also more tradi
tional methods such as lunch dis
cussions with the community.
"All of this is getting our con
tent out in new ways, which is sort
of what the entire industry is trying
to do," Banerjee added.
Trotter pointed out that effec
tive journalism is critical to build
ing community. "The point of a
long story is that it really takes you
in-depth into an issue or a person
so that you feel more connected
with people around you," Trotter
said. "We are trying to publish sto
ries that unite Stanford as a com
munity and bring people closer to
each other."
Titus described the personal
satisfaction she gets from working
with The Daily community. "You
get to see these writers go from
being brand new to taking stories,
sometimes having trouble with
them, but bouncing back," Titus
explained. "I just really like watch
ing them do that. It's all of the
good things about The Daily multi
plied through all these new peo
ple."

It's easy to take for granted that our student body has
its very own sophisticated, central news source. But
behind the scenes, writers and editors are up until as late
as 3:30 a.m. to produce the paper each day.
Working at The Daily often means accepting an alter
native, admittedly bizarre lifestyle that implies sacrifice
in all aspects of what it means to be a Stanford student.
Eric Messinger 'lO, managing editor of news,
described one of the ways The Daily has changed his
everyday life as a student. "I really appreciate and love
the times when I see my roommate," Messinger said.
"But they are very rare. The Daily is not really totally
compatible with my friends' schedules or my room
mate's schedule."

Working at The Daily can also make it more difficult
to have a normal social life.
"My nights are pretty much owned by The Daily,
except for Friday and Saturday," Messinger added.
Devin Banerjee 'll, editor in chief and president of
The Daily, similarly has anything but a typical dorm
experience late nights of putting out the paper often
mean crashing in the office.

"If I have schoolwork to do after a production, I'll
often sleep there," Banerjee admitted. "It's a comfort
able couch, it really is. And if you close the windows, it's
not cold at all. We have pillows there and we have a
blanket... It's actually a really great place to sleep."
For Banerjee, involvement in The Daily has also
impacted his academic options. As a student in the man
agement science and engineering department who also
has had significant nightly responsibilities at The Daily
for about a year, Banerjee has had to construct a very

rigid course schedule.
"I have a very strict four-year plan," Banerjee said.
"It's a big tradeoff, deciding to take on the editor posi
tion. I had to think about what I was giving up at the
time... I have to take fewer classes while editor in
chief, and I also did when I was deputy editor and man
aging editor."
Emma Trotter 'lO, managing editor of features,
described the day-to-day life of being an editor. "Figure
out what came in from the previous night and, if what I
was counting on coming in came in, e-mail the people
who dropped the ball, try to confirm that photos have
been taken, check in with the editors about whether the
stories are good or not that's all in the morning or
afternoon," Trotter said. "Once I come in, it's just a quick
matter of editing stories, hanging out with people and
then leaving."
Editors also often connect their day-to-day experi
ences to ideas for new stories. "I'll just be in the shower,
or biking around campus, or somebody mentions some
thing," Trotter explained. "You can turn almost anything
into a feature ... Features consumes my life. Whatever I
do, wherever I go, is a potential story idea."
Zach Zimmerman 'l2, managing editor of sports,
summed up how all of the editors seem to feel about
their commitment. "All in all, the benefits completely
outweigh the costs in this situation," he said.
Editors describe The Daily environment as a dynam
ic place to work.

"Everyone's pretty close because we're here so
much," Zimmerman said. "We laugh together and we
fight together, so it's kind of like a family in away. For

how much fun we have, I'm always surprised by how
well things run and how good the end product looks."
Messinger joked that The Daily office is a world of its
own. "It's a strange environment at The Daily," he said.
"Everyone here really cares about what they're doing ..
. We're probably sort of strange people, but we enjoy it
a lot."
Trotter describes how The Daily culture has changed
from previous years. "When I first started working as a
news desk editor, people didn't talk to each other as
much," Trotter said. "Some people hung out outside of
the office, but it definitely wasn't as inclusive as it is
now."
Trotter added that there are moments of tension, but
humor overrides it. "There are times when people snipe
at each other, people get on each other's nerves," she
said. "But in general, there's a lot of camaraderie and
inside jokes and essentially laughter that happens every
night."
Banerjee explained that although The Daily is fun, it
still is a professional organization at its core.
"It's fun, but at the same time we understand that we
are professional, and we are doing really important
work," Banerjee said. "It takes a lot for me to always
keep that in mind so that I don't lose track of our real
mission every night.
"If it weren't fun, I think it would really negatively
affect the work that we do," he added.
Staff members have found The Daily to be an excel
lent way to become deeply immersed in both the

Stanford community and world
affairs. Ellie Titus 'll, the Tuesday
night news desk editor, described
her experience.
"I feel more engaged with
Stanford as a student than before,"
Titus said. "And I feel more aware
of what's going on around me...
I'm paying closer attention to our
community, and that enhances my
life as a student."
However, some aspects of pro
ducing the paper are less appealing
than others.
"There's a lot of technical nitty
gritty for editing that can get really
tedious, but it's just part of the job,"
Messinger said. "And when you see
stories the next day and you're
proud of how they read and look,
you realize it's worth it."
Sometimes, a frustrating aspect
of being an editor is keeping every
one in the section organized and on
track.
"There is one thing that I like
and hate at the same time, which is
sending nasty e-mails," Trotter said.
"Sometimes, I have to e-mail [writ
ers] five times before they respond."
Trotter described the art of send
ing reminder e-mails: start out
polite and crescendo to hostility as
writers go MIA.
"The desk editors appreciate my
nasty e-mail sending skill," she said.
"It's not something that I necessari
ly enjoy, but I have cultivated it and
I'm good at it at this point. I feel like
I'm doing it correctly."
Leaders in each of the editorial
sections all have their own vision of
how to improve the quality of the
paper and maintain its high stan
dards.
The Features section, for exam
ple, started out as 'Page 2,' only run
ning once a week. After Trotter
became managing editor, the sec
tion expanded to four days a week,
focusing on trends, profiles and nar
ratives.
"I took it and made it Features
and started the desk editors system
and just tried to make it more legit
imate," Trotter said. "I want to leave
something in place that will not just
collapse when I'm gone."
Messinger also has specific goals
for News. "One thing I was setting
out to do was make student govern
ment coverage a little less focused
on contention and bickering and
more about the substance of what
student government does,"
Messinger said. "Another thing I've
been trying to do is connect more

campus stories to national issues."
Zimmerman has been working
to broaden possibilities for writers
to develop their voices in sports
writing by increasing opportunities
for student columns.
Annika Heinle 'l2, managing
editor of fntermission, wants to
make the arts and entertainment
insert something that people look
forward to reading on Fridays. "A
lot of people complain about
always being in the Stanford bub
ble," she said. "1 think it's cool that
Stanford has the opportunity to
make sure everyone knows what's
going on in the entertainment
scene outside of Stanford."
When Banerjee ran to be editor
in chief, he wrote a 32-page plat
form outlining his plans for specif
ic areas of the paper which he con
tinues to translate into action. One
of his main goals is to nurture the
connection between The Daily and
its readers.
"A huge thematic change that I
wanted to implement was being
much more open with our readers
and our community," Banerjee
said. "The Daily was becoming
independent in a bad sense, in that
we were becoming more isolated
from the readers. That's why I'm
open to op-eds, letters to the edi
tor, just a lot of discussion."
This connection is in part being
developed through multimedia
tools such as Facebook, Twitter,
iPhone applications, online polls
and surveys, and also more tradi
tional methods such as lunch dis
cussions with the community.
"All of this is getting our con
tent out in new ways, which is sort
of what the entire industry is trying
to do," Banerjee added.
Trotter pointed out that effec
tive journalism is critical to build
ing community. "The point of a
long story is that it really takes you
in-depth into an issue or a person
so that you feel more connected
with people around you," Trotter
said. "We are trying to publish sto
ries that unite Stanford as a com
munity and bring people closer to
each other."
Titus described the personal
satisfaction she gets from working
with The Daily community. "You
get to see these writers go from
being brand new to taking stories,
sometimes having trouble with
them, but bouncing back," Titus
explained. "I just really like watch
ing them do that. It's all of the
good things about The Daily multi
plied through all these new peo
ple."

It's 10:46 p.m. at the Lorry I. Lokey Stanford Daily
building. Editors are seated around a common
table with laptops, reviewing content, editing for
mechanics and form, and preparing tomorrow's
issue for print. The Stanford Daily is bustling with
conversations about stories that need to come in
"ASAP" and the sound of ringing phones. But there's
also a surprising amount of laughter.
Every once in a while, an editor will take a break
from her or his work to contribute to the quote board, a
quirky white board that gives humorous glimpses into
the random conversations of sleep-deprived and highly
caffeinated college students who have been stuck in the
same room for far too long.
