# LET IT GROW
## Graduate students volunteer at local garden to support food banks 
### 
Like many Americans taking part
in food drives this month, 13
Stanford graduate students set
out to support local peninsula
food banks. But they had more
than ramen noodles and canned corn in
mind. Instead, they helped provide under
privileged residents with something they
don't often get fresh, organic produce.
On Saturday, Nov. 7, the students vol
unteered to harvest 51 pounds of peppers,
Swiss chard and tomatoes grown at the
Almost Eden volunteer-run garden in
Palo Alto.
Garden Co-Manager Shellie Sanchez
then drove the vegetables straight to St.
Anthony's, a soup kitchen in Menlo Park
that serves 600 hot meals per week. It is
one of four Palo Alto area food banks
Almost Eden provides with organic pro
duce.
"Going to the food banks is the best
part," Sanchez said. "Families see the
fresh food as we bring it in, and they start
grabbing each other's arms and pointing.
They're pretty excited about what we
grew. It's not the kind of stuff [food
banks] usually get donated."
When Almost Eden staff asked Kate
Church, director of the Palo Alto Food
Closet, whether they could donate their
produce, her response was, "Can we give
you a hug?"
The Food Closet offers needy families
and seniors food baskets that they can
take home and prepare for themselves.
Church estimates they serve 55 families
each week, up 35 percent from this time
last year.
"Sometimes a few people donate fruit
from their backyard fruit trees, but we
never get very much in the way of vegeta
bles," Church said. "Almost Eden [volun
teers] are very nice people, and their work
is very important to us."
Joanna Lankester, a fourth year gradu
ate student in electrical engineering,
organized the volunteer outing at Almost
Eden for fellow residents of the Rains
housing complex and other grad students.
"I was looking for an opportunity that
would let students volunteer together,"
she said. "I stumbled upon this garden last
year, and the event was a big hit. It's
amazing that [Almost Eden] serves such a
need in the community depending entire
ly on volunteers."
Founded in 1998, Almost Eden didn't
always rely completely on donations of
time and money. It began with grant fund
ing from Palo Alto's Urban Ministries
and hired homeless and low-income
employees to maintain the garden and
deliver the produce to food banks.
Budget constraints forced Urban

Ministries to cut funding a few years after
the program began, turning Almost Eden
into a true labor of love. The Central
Coast Baptist Association was still willing
to donate the land for Almost Eden, but
garden managers suddenly had to find
creative ways to maintain the garden
without paid staff or supplies.
"This year, we started leasing one
third of the garden plots to community
members who wanted their own gar
dens," said Co-Manager Pam Chesavage
'92. "Combined with donations, it's
enough to buy seedlings, tools and sup
plies and pay our water bill each month.
Plus, it gives the community some pride in
the garden."
Chesavage started co-managing
Almost Eden in 2003, shortly after she got
married and moved into the garden's
neighborhood. She was interested in help
ing for many of the same reasons today's
Stanford graduate students are.
"I was a Stanford student and needed
something to do other than homework,"
she said. "I used to garden with my dad
and always lived in houses where I started
gardens. I studied human biology with a
focus on community environmental
health. This seemed like a natural fit. It's a
great way to spend a Saturday morning."
Today, Chesavage admits, she spends
a lot more time at the garden than mere
ly Saturday mornings. During peak gar
dening times the fall and spring the
mother of four is there up to 20 hours
per week, organizing volunteers and
coordinating planting, harvesting and
composting.
"It's like small-scale farming," she said.
"We grow and donate about 2,000 pounds
of produce per year."
Ashish Goel, a first year graduate stu
dent working on his master's in aeronau
tics and astronautics, was one of the grad
students who donated a portion of his
weekend to Almost Eden. A first-time
volunteer, he helped plant beds of broc
coli and collard greens and prepared out
of-season plants for composting.
"I'm a vegetarian, and I appreciated
the idea of growing vegetables," Goel
said. "I remember, when I was little, there
used to be guava and tamarind trees at
my elementary school. We used to throw
sticks at the trees to get the fruit to fall
off."
Goel added that he frequents the Palo
Alto farmers markets for his vegetables
today and was happy to volunteer to help
others who can't afford the same fresh
produce, especially produce that's been
harvested the same day.
"Whenever you pluck stuff right off
the trees, it always tastes better," he said.
