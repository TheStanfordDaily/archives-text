Thanksgiving Harvest Reading
with David Mas Masumoto
Please join us on the Thursday before Thanksgiving for a
reading by the much-admired writer, popular columnist,
and organic peach farmer David Mas Masumoto.
Masumoto is the award-winning author of nine books
including Epitaph for a Peach, Harvest Son, Four Seasons
in Five Senses, Letters to the Valley, Heirlooms and the
newly published memoir entitled Wisdom of the Last Farmer.
Hailed by The New York Times as "a poet of farming,"
and by the Los Angeles Times as a "Rockstar Farmer"
who "uses his farm as Thoreau did his Walden Pond,"
Masumoto weaves together stories of family and farming,
and life and death, to reveal age-old wisdom that is fast
disappearing—and urgently needed. A third-generation
farmer, Masumoto grows certified organic peaches,
nectarines, grapes, and raisins.
Thursday, November 19
7:30 pm
Geology Corner (Bldg 320), Room 105
