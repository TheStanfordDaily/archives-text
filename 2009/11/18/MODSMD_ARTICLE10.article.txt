# STEINBECKS TO BE
## Student authors discuss their current writing projects 
### MIRANDA SIMON 
By the time Miles Osgood 'll
graduates next year, he may
have a novel published and
he's only 20 years old.
Osgood, an English major, read
Baudelaire's Painter of Modern Life and
decided to go to Paris for two months to
write a novel about what art should strive
to be. He workshopped it with faculty
mentors in creative writing classes,
received a crash course in art history
from his girlfriend and flew across the
globe to see the Louvre, the Musee
d'Orsay and the Pompidou.
While some Stanford students crouch
under a pile of books, gasping frantically
for a gust of free time, others have man
aged to fit writing a novel into their
schedules. And while some students use
summer break to disconnect from all
things intellectual, others are penning
books about French Neo-Classicists and
the valleys of Michoacan.
Others simply reminisce about home
in a faraway place.
"My parents used to own a grocery
store back home, and when no one was
coming into the store, I would just write
on the back of cigarette cartons," remem
bers Ze Xiao 'll. "It was cheap paper
back then."
She always envisioned herself as a
novel writer and the wife of a National
Geographic photographer. She doesn't
want to be the one taking the photos; she
just wants to go for the ride.
"Ideally, if supporting myself and
money didn't matter, I would love to go
to different countries and different small
er cities," she said. "I'm not a big fan of
big cities. I would love to live there for
like a year or two, digest what's going on
and then write about it."
In 2007, before she was enveloped by
Stanford's heavy workload, she printed

Tutuila, a collection of seven short stories
inspired by her life in American Samoa.
Tutuila is the largest of the Samoan
Islands.
Xiao's cousin designed the art of the
book, and she took the photo of water
lilies that decorates the front page.
Osgood and Max McClure 'll, a biol
ogy major and creative writing minor,
were each given the Chapell Lougee
grant, a grant for sophomores who want
to perform research full time in the
humanities, creative arts and social sci
ences. This enabled them to spend their
summers working on their novels.
Osgood wrote his first novel when he
was 12 years old and living in Paris dur
ing his father's sabbatical (his father is
an electrical engineering professor at
Stanford). He missed the Bay Area
while in Paris, and his novel is a collec
tion of reminiscences.
Paris was an obvious and personal
choice for the setting of his current novel.
This time around, however, it was Paris
that he yearned for.
McClure chose southwest Mexico to
set his novel. He had been there before
with Amigos, a nonprofit that operates in
the Americas, and stayed in a community
called El Quemado in Michoacan.
McClure envisioned his novel's main
character, Cheese, as a second-generation
immigrant wandering Michoacan's arid
sierra in search of his father's hometown.
Cheese finds that it has moved itself
entirely to Nebraska, and in its place he
finds a valley infested with dead and
dying beetles.
The main character of Unframed,
Osgood's novel, is an art history professor
in his 40s who decides, after a divorce and
a mid-life crisis, to become a painter.
"He is trying to divorce himself from
studying the French Neo-Classicists and
trying to create a new art of his own, but
finds he has to use everything he knows
when he's painting his own stuff,"
Osgood explained. "The question is

whether it detracts him from being an
individual painter on his own, or if he
can build upon it."
As an English major, Osgood often
examined other writers' pieces and had
always wondered what it would be like to
write a novel of his own. Sans the mid-life
crisis and divorce, Osgood, like his main
character, set out on a daring and creative
writing project.
"This is not necessarily what will hap
pen to me, but it could be a path my life
would go through if I devoted myself
completely to studying literature," he
said. "It was kind of funny to see that
potential older version of myself play out
and fix his life."
McClure finds a parallel between him
self and the narrator of his novel,
Yanquilandia. This character is a chem
istry student at Berkeley who meets
Cheese on his high school soccer team,
finds him again at a bar and then tells him
the story of his travels. The narrator is
from Marin, California, McClure's home
town, and like the writer, places a high
value on education.
Osgood still has six chapters to go and
plans to take advantage of the structure
that a class will provide as well as the
advice of faculty. He wants to write for a
few years and then maybe pursue a Ph.D.
Xiao is still writing short stories when
ever she feels inspired and may submit
her book to a publisher after she has
reviewed and updated it. Meanwhile, she
will continue in whatever path computer
science may take her.
McClure still has some polishing to do
before he sends Yanquilandia off to be
published. Meanwhile, he's fulfilling pre
med requirements without really know
ing if he wants to be a doctor.
Doctor by day, writer by night?
"I really like the idea of having a dou
ble life," he laughs.
