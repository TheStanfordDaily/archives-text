## GET IT RIGHT Fox News is a convenient scapegoat for Stanford Democrats 
### Erica Morgan 
I was amused by The Stanford Daily Edito
rial Board's portrayal of popular conser
vative media sources in the article "De
mocrats must keep reaching out to moder
ates." The authors struggle to provide a plau
sible strategy for the Democratic Party to
magnanimously reach out with voices of rea
son to the fire-breathing conservative fac
tions of America. The piece failed in this re
spect, but nicely captured the kind of conceit
ed self-righteousness exhibited by liberals at
Stanford on a regular basis.
The article points out that "railing against
the latest absurdities of Glenn Beck is the
easy way out for liberals. Even President
Obama has fallen into this trap, regularly de
riding Fox News..." I am in complete
agreement with this sentiment. Surely, demo
nizing the political commentators on Fox
News accomplishes very little. What confuses
me is why, after making this sage observation,
the editorial attempts to discredit and deride
Fox News and its conservative pundits
throughout the article: "When the radical
right seems to have adopted Limbaugh's sen
timent 'I hope [Obama] fails' as its po
litical strategy, cooperation seems hopeless."
The authors blame the "radicals" of Fox
News for halting cooperation and "construc
tive conversation" with blind opposition to
the President. Of course, there is no possibil
ity that conservatives actually think for
themselves and challenge Obama based on
his policy. The kind of over-generalization
presented in this article is a classic ploy to dis
credit political opposition. The Editorial
Board doesn't address conservative political
concerns, choosing instead to blame Fox
News and its mindless audience for halting
Democratic progress.
I am a conservative and yes, I hope that
Obama fails. By this I do not mean that I want
the nation to dissolve into chaos under his
administration. Nor do I mean that his every
initiative is evil. What I do mean is that I op
pose his policies in the realms of healthcare,
education, climate change and government
intervention in the private sector. I am not
willing to compromise my fundamental be
liefs, as the Editorial Board suggests I should,
to appease my political opponents. The fact
that I disagree with a great deal of liberals in

these political arenas creates discourse and
adds to the spectrum of political knowledge.
While accusing Glenn Beck and Rush
Limbaugh of thrusting "themselves into the
middle of seemingly every conversation"
and commandeering "the voice of the Re
publican Party," the article claims that "polls
show decreasing numbers of Republicans
concerned about global warming while more
and more fear Obama's 'socialism.'" Of
course, this shift in the concerns of Republi
cans can only be the result of the conserva
tive media sources. It can't have anything to
do with Obama's intention to implement a
single-payer healthcare system, the fact that
the government took over General Motors
and the video encouraging American
schoolchildren to pay homage to Obama's
eminent personage.
The White House communications direc
tor let loose in a New York Times interview:
"We're going to treat [Fox News] the way we
would treat an opponent... They are under
taking a war against Barack Obama and the
White House. We don't need to pretend that
this is the way legitimate news organizations
behave." While I'm sure the Obama adminis
tration would appreciate it if Fox News rolled
over and publicly condoned its every maneu
ver, I am personally grateful for a news source
that questions the major decisions being
made in our country. Consequently, viewing
numbers indicate that I am not alone in this
view. Fox News "averaged 1.2 million viewers
at any given time this year" according to The
New York Times and beats out CNN and
MSNBC as the number-one news channel in
the U.S. in terms of regular viewers.
While I appreciate the kind intentions of
the The Daily's Editorial Board to reason
with me and convince me of the errors of my
ways, I don't think I'll take the advice of
someone whose idea of a reasonable conser
vative is one who supports cap-and-trade.
"Democrats must keep reaching 0ut..."
was not written to encourage balanced dis
cussion, but to discredit Republican plat
forms and praise those Republicans who sup
port liberal initiatives.

Comments? Careful, I might forward them to
Rush Limbaugh: emorganl@stanford.edu.
