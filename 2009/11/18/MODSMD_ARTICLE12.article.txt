## Manage risks of climate change immediately 
### 
Twenty days remain until the COP 15
conference at Copenhagen. For bet
ter or worse, voices from both sides of
the climate change debate are getting loud
er. Climate skeptics have some of the rowdi
er ones. They claim to be the last bastion of
reason soldiers defending the Alamo of
free market society, resisting the assault of
the possible Copenhagen Protocol. What
skeptics must understand is that their denial
and fear mongering blinds themselves from
their own individualist tenets. The only ra
tional, self-interested option for dealing
with climate change is to manage its risks,
immediately.
Skeptics say that the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change does not hold a
scientific consensus since 31,478 scientists
signed a petition against the conclusion that
rises in CO2 concentration are anthro
pogenic that it is a "Man-Made Myth."
Many organizations have responded to the
false trends and selective data disseminated
by cherry-picked scientists who receive
funding from the fossil fuel industry. The
fact that they continuously rely on unapolo
getic think tanks known to use policy to in
form science not the converse speaks
to their fallacy.
They assert that the greenhouse gas
emissions since the industrial revolution
have afforded our high quality of life, and
should rightfully continue to do so. But most
interestingly, they argue that climate action
is an affront to their personal freedoms and
liberties. Specifically, attempts to mitigate
emissions curtail their right to drive a gas
guzzling SUV, take long showers and have
one's steak and eat it too. Consider one stu
dent's praise for an "Objectivist" piece in
The Stanford Review: "I'm gonna enjoy liv
ing out my days the way I want to, the way I
know won't harm any one else because of
my carbon output or some other crazy no
tion."
How can one be certain that their emis
sions will not harm others? Or that others'
emissions will not be harmful?
I am no philosopher. But, since appeals
to the scientific method are ineffectual, I

will appeal to reason. Classical philosopher
J.S. Mill postulated with The Harm Principle
that "the sole end for which mankind are
warranted, individually or collectively, in in
terfering with the liberty of action of any ..
.is self-protection ... The only purpose for
which power can be rightfully exercised
over any member of a civilized community,
against his will, is to prevent harm to others.
His own good, either physical or moral, is
not sufficient warrant."
Mill acknowledges that many "crazy no
tions" exist and that a discourse between
them will yield the truth. Unfortunately,
since skeptics tenaciously uphold their val
ues regardless of whether they have been
disproved by science, both perspectives
stand to remain in perpetual conflict.
While catastrophic climate change has a
small probability, the magnitude of harm to
one's own and others' economies, environ
ments and societies is too great to ignore. If
risk equals probability times consequence,
and cities expect to face flood, famine and
flight, then skeptics can no longer reason
that rights outweigh responsibilities. In the
spirit of self-preservation, one cannot en
sure freedom with philosophies that rely on
an unregulated market guided by individu
alistic motives. The drivers of demand and
supply, in the face of grave global climate
change, parallel the opposing forces of liber
ty and scarcity.
Consider your right to gasoline, water or
meat. If society consumes them at an unsus
tainable rate, with growing global demand,
resources will become increasingly con
strained, and with an altered climate pro
duction will become increasingly difficult.
This claim to liberty increases scarcity,
harms yourself and others and, worse, com
promises your ability to meet your own
needs. It is illogical to disregard climate ac
tion.
Not even Fortune 50 companies like
Hewlett-Packard and Wal-Mart take such
an uncompromising stance. Instead, they
recognize that reducing their emissions
