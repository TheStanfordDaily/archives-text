"And now, Harry, let us step out into the night
and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,
p. 56

The question, "What do you want to be
when you grow up?" is definitely not
unique to the Stanford chapter of our
lives. It is a question we have been asked from
the moment we could walk and talk. Giving
our time turners a go, a lot of us would proba
bly sheepishly admit that we wanted to be as
tronauts, singers or President of the United
States. While these answers seem childish
now as we pursue degrees in areas unbe
knownst to even the brightest of 5-year-olds
"management science and engineering"
and "symbolic systems" do not sound nearly
as good as being a princess what we each
sought was the excitement and grand adven
ture of it all.
Harry and Dumbledore are no different
from our childhood selves in many respects.
Despite their apparent differences, they are
united by their addiction to fighting evil and
landing themselves in mind-blowing situa
tions. Throughout the series, they embark on
numerous escapades and take enormous
risks without any safety nets in sight. Al
though their apparent obsession with adven
ture might seem reckless and untenable, why
and how they act upon it provides us with a
striking picture of what it truly means and
looks like to take risks that lead to the most
fulfilling form of exploration.
Upon first glance, Stanford students don't
seem to be lacking in the "risk-taking" parts
of our lives. Looking at our summer experi
ences alone, it is obvious that many of us push
the envelope by pursuing cutting edge re
search in every area imaginable and by ven
turing boldly to every corner of the world.
While in a context outside of Stanford, our ex
plorations appear quite daring and perilous,
within the Stanford community these types of
investigations are the norm, lacking the sheen
of a "flighty temptress."The things we involve
ourselves in can melt down into a formula of
expectations and planned spontaneity. Sud
denly, we recognize that our pursuits lack the
mystique that so captivates Harry and Dum
bledore.

It is precisely this captivation that empow
ers Harry to follow Dumbledore blindly into
the night. He is able to launch himself out of
the usual regularity and calm of his summer
months into a full-scale adventure because of
an insatiable drive a drive not necessarily
to prove himself or to fulfill what others ex
pect of him, as is often the case with the so
called risks that we take. Rather, he has a
commitment to seemingly lofty ideals, ideals
so insanely unachievable even to him that

they are but fleeting glimmers of hope. Still,
something about these insane possibilities are
so mesmerizing that both Harry and Dumble
dore must move beyond simply flirting with
them to taking a risk by fully engaging with
such transient goals.
Surely we Stanford students are no
strangers to possibilities that sound similarly
tempting and just so good. However, often
times these suppressed desires come out in
half-joking statements about dropping our
minors, doing something absolutely out
landish during our precious summers and
chasing that kindergarten dream. Yet, once
we gain a glimpse of the true essence of a risk
that puts us in a place to lose more than we
might be willing, we instinctively run away
from the possibilities that make our hearts
beat the fastest. Instead of stepping into the
night and into the unknown with a Harry-
Dumbledore confidence and our eyes fo
cused on the elusive prize, we allow our fears
of becoming less of "Stanford students" to
stop our adventures before they even start.
Admittedly, it will not always be wise or
even possible to pursue each ephemeral aspi
ration that passes through our minds. Still,
rather than ashamedly tossing aside what we
may initially deem foolish wishes, we must
recognize that there is a reason why they
tempt us so strongly. Hence, it might be ad
vantageous for us to carefully craft different
ways to actualize the true yearnings behind
these objectives. As Dumbledore and Harry
understand so well, adventure and chasing
after what tempts us does not have to look
thoughtless and fruitless. On the other hand,
it has the potential to be more meaningful
than anything else we might pursue because it
comes from a place of knowing what we right
ly want. Thus, much to our surprise, while
chasing our childish wishes, we might find that
we become immeasurably more mature.
Of course, it might still be a good idea to
drop your wish to pursue a career in Magical
Law Enforcement. From what Hermione's
told us, they don't do much good in the world.
