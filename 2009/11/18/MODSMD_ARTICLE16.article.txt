# OP-ED
## De la Torre shouldn't have run 
### JOSHUA FALK Class of 2012 
On Friday, The Daily reported that ASSU Vice Pres
ident Jay de la Torre had resigned due to an Honor
Code violation that occurred in a Computer Sci
ence 106A: Programming Methodology in fall of 2008.
After reading de la Torre's statement, I cannot help but
wonder: What was he thinking?
To begin with, copying a computer science assignment
is never a good idea regardless of how dire a student's
academic situation might be. As any Stanford computer
science student knows, the computer science department
employs an Internet service to check for plagiarism that
makes cheating nearly impossible to get away with.
According to a handout from Professor Mehran Saha
mi's current CSIO6A course, this system is "amazingly ef
fective at detecting unusual resemblances in programs."
Plagiarizing a computer science assignment is asking for
an Honor Code violation.
Mr. de la Torre's most careless judgment call, howev
er, was not his decision to copy a friend's computer sci
ence code. Instead, it was his decision to run for ASSU ex
ecutive despite the likelihood that he would be unable to
complete his term due to his Honor Code violation a
decision that was downright reckless.
"I thought if I made my case expressed my remorse
well enough to the judicial affairs panel, I could miti
gate the consequences," Mr. de la Torre told The Daily. "I
was very optimistic."
But Mr. de la Torre had little reason to be optimistic.
According to Greg Boardman, vice provost for stu
dent affairs, "a one quarter suspension and forty hours of
community service is the standard sanction for a first

time violation of the Honor Code and that includes pla
giarism."
Vice Provost Boardman noted that judicial panels take
into account "aggravating and mitigating circumstances in
their deliberations." But according to a judicial panelist
who wished to remain anonymous, a student would have to
"provide significant mitigating factors to deviate from the
standard sanction."
Remorse alone is unlikely to get even a first-time of
fender off the hook. It is certainly not enough for an
ASSU executive candidate to bank on, especially given
that the standard sanction for a first-time violation of the
Honor Code has included a one-quarter suspension since
at least the 1970s (see Guide to the Penalty Code and to
Judicial Sanctions).
Mr. de la Torre was correct that he had the "moral and
political obligation" to disclose his reason for resigna
tion, but he should have made public his Honor Code vi
olation during the campaign, not after his judicial panel
forced him to take a leave of absence. Admitting his mis
take during the campaign would have shown political
courage and transparency while allowing students to con
sider the possibility that Mr. de la Torre would not be able
to complete his term as ASSU vice president.
Instead, Jay de la Torre put his political ambitions
ahead of the best interests of the student body, running
for a term in office that he should have known he would
not be able to complete.
