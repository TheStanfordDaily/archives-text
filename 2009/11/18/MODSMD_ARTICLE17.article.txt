## CHALLENGE BEGINS Cancun Challenge opens at Maples 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford will kick off the Cancun Chal
lenge at home today against Oral Roberts. The
eight-team tournament begins with two
games each at four host sites including
Maples Pavilion with no elimination until
all the schools travel to Cancun, Mexico next
week. The field includes No. 4 Kentucky and
Cleveland State, who won an NCAA Tourna
ment game last year as a No. 13 seed.
The Cardinal (1-1,0-0 Pac-10) takes on the
Golden Eagles (1-1, 0-0 Summit) after split
ting its opening games last weekend. Stanford
lost 77-64 at San Diego last Friday before
beating the Cal Poly Mustangs 70-53 in the
hope opener on Sunday.
Coach Johnny Dawkins, who leads a young
squad, saw marked improvement between the
two contests, particularly on the defensive
front. The Cardinal held the Mustangs to 38.6
percent shooting against the Toreros' torrid
rate of 52.6 percent.

"Our guys are coming together, our com
munication is getting better and our defense is
getting better," he said.
The first two points are particularly key for
the relatively inexperienced group simply
put, the Cardinal is using a number of players
who have seen limited collegiate action. Thus,
cohesion is key and Dawkins emphasizes it,
particularly in light of both injuries and off
the-court incidents.
"We have to be a close-knit group," he said.
"We faced some adversity early on and we're
working our way out of it. You're going to
have adversity from time to time. It's all about
how you work your way through it."
That said, Stanford still has to establish an
upward trajectory. The Cardinal was outre
bounded by the Mustangs and shot decently
but not particularly well, especially from out
side the post.
"There's always room for improvement,"
said senior Landry Fields. "A lot of it is expe
rience, that can only come with time."
As expected, Fields has been the early star
for the Cardinal. Fie has averaged 23.5 points
and eight rebounds per contest over the first
two games, including a career high 25 points
against San Diego.
But, he'll need help if Stanford is to suc
ceed against Oral Roberts, a Christian univer
sity in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Golden Eagles
opened their season by losing on the road to a
good Wake Forest squad in a closer than antic
ipated game the Demon Deacons main
tained just a ten point lead with five minutes
to play. Oral Roberts then came home to crush
Northwest Oklahoma State and even their
record.
They are led by senior forward/center

Kevin Ford and freshman guard Warren Niles.
Ford is best on the team, averaging 17 points
per game on 72.7 percent shooting.
Ford will likely do battle with sophomore
forward Jack Trotter, who scored 10 points
against the Mustangs, a career high. Dawkins
singled out Trotter and senior guard Drew
Shiller, the only other Stanford player besides
Fields averaging double digits in scoring, as
two early successes.
"Both guys have given good contribu

tions," Dawkins said.
They have had to, particularly because
sophomore guard Jeremy Green, expected to
be a potent scoring threat, has struggled thus
far. He is just 5-24 from the field, including 3-
11 from behind the arc. Green returned from
an indefinite suspension before the San
Diego game, but the effects of his absence are
showing.

Senior Landry Fields and the rest of the men's basketball team will host two games in the
Cancun Challenge this week. Fields has been on fire this season, averaging 23.5 points
through two games.
"With him, it's rust. Fie has not
played any exhibition game and
has not been with us more than
two or three weeks in the past two
months," Dawkins said. "He's ad
justing, he has to learn on the fly."
But, it's not just Green
Dawkins has indicated that the of
fense is not where he wants it to
be. The Cardinal will aim to rectify
those problems against Oral
Roberts, but the Golden Eagles

are tough defensively they've
held opponents to 39.1 percent
shooting so far this year and their
perimeter containment has been
particularly effective. Wake For
est's starting guards, L.D. Williams
and Ishmael Smith, were held to a
combined 6-22 from the field,
while Northwest Oklahoma
State's guard trio shot 7-24.
Stanford will try to succeed
where others have not tonight at 7
p.m. The Cancun Challenge con
tinues Saturday when Florida
A&M comes to the Farm.
