# The 						age-old debate: Is golf actually a sport?
## Golf does not require enough physical exertion 
### Tom Taylor 
Golf is not a sport. Sorry, it's
just not. Yes, it requires a lot
of skill, is very competitive
and the top players are in
credibly talented at what they do
but that doesn't make them sportsmen
and sportswomen.
The Oxford English Dictionary de
fines a sport as "An activity involving
physical exertion and skill... one regu
lated by set rules or customs in which an
individual or team competes against an
other or others." Golf almost ticks all
the boxes, except physical exertion.
It's a game and that's not an insult.
There are many great games out there
that really test people to their limits.
Some require great hand-eye coordina
tion and intelligence, but what they
don't need is real athleticism.

You don't have to spend
hours in the gym honing
your body to shoot pool,
to bluff someone at
Texas Hold'Em, or to
hit under par on an 18-
hole course. A basic
level of fitness cer
tainly helps, but
that has little to
do with the
game being
played. Healthy
people can con
centrate longer and
think clearer and sim
ply aren't as likely to keel
over and die.
Algebra requires con
centration, but that
doesn't mean it's a j
sport. People don't
pack a stadium to
watch people do
math.
Mark Twain fa- Â»
mously said, "Golf is a \
good walk, ruined." If
only.
Players used to have to
walk reasonable distances
around a course, carrying
a bulky golf bag. Even this
was deemed too taxing,
too physical, so they in
vented caddies (someone
else to carry their stuff)
and even motorized
wheeled bags. Oh and the
eponymous golf cart, for
those for whom even
walking was a chore.
This is a long way from
shepherds knocking
stones into rabbit holes in
the wild highlands of
Scotland, but even those
origins don't really qual
ify it as a sport. These
peasants would have I
certainly been much I
fitter than the average I
modern golfer, but
their physical
shape, a result s
of a hard life


AVERY WEIDMAN/The
Stanford Daily
driving livestock across barren hill
tops, was purely coincidental to the
game they were playing.
When compared to real, certified
sports, the physical tests of golf pale
to nothing.
Rugby players need around 700
calories an hour, basketball maybe
550, but golf barely 300 and that as
sumes the person is walking and car
rying their own bag. Just to break
even the average adult male needs
2500 calories a day and if you sub
tract the time and calories burnt,
spent asleep, that's 130 an hour. The
energy requirements of golf are clos
er to doing nothing than to playing a
real sport.
In football everyone on the team
runs the risk of being hit hard, real
hard. Helmets and shoulder-pads
mediate the danger, but there are
still some horrific injuries. Boxers

must fight at 100%, round after
round, with barely a few seconds
rest, no matter how bruised and bat
tered they feel. Track and field ath
letes train their bodies to push back
the very limits of human physical
abilities. MotoGP riders and F1 driv
ers have to contend with extreme G
forces and know that one mistake, or
a momentary lapse in concentration,
could spell the end.
Golfers are barely likely to
even break a sweat, unless it's a
particularly nice sunny day out on
the course. No player struggles to
the 18th hole and then collapses to
the ground, pulse racing, from ex
haustion.
The worst injury they are likely to
endure might be some kind of sprain
or repetitive strain injury. I can get
that typing on a computer.
Even the relatively safe sport of
tennis, where there is no physical
contact between the battling play
ers, is a whole different level to golf.
Crashing into the net-posts or sides
of the court and even leaping to re
turn a ball can tear tendons and

break bones.
The first stop for golfers after
playing a game is the 19th hole, the
bar. It's not the physiotherapist,
masseur or even, in the worst cases,
the hospital.
No one tailgates a major.There is
no tribal adrenaline rush that comes
with stepping onto a golf course.
Fans don't strip and paint their bod
ies in Tiger's colors. Golf tourna
ments don't pack 100,000-seat stadi
ums and they don't draw TV audi
ences measured in billions.
The rich and the corporate world
bankroll the game of golf. It's not a
sport but a handy way to socialize
with clients and to show off your
power and wealth through both the
clubs you own and the clubs you're a
member of.
It might be a huge money earner
and highly entertaining for its fol
lowers, but Hollywood earns a lot of
money and Brad Pitt is no athlete.
It's just not a sport.
