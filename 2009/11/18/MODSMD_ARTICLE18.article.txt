# The
						age-old debate: Is golf actually a sport?
## Golf does not require enough physical exertion 
### Tom Taylor 
Golf is not a sport. Sorry, it's
just not. Yes, it requires a lot
of skill, is very competitive
and the top players are in
credibly talented at what they do
but that doesn't make them sportsmen
and sportswomen.
The Oxford English Dictionary de
fines a sport as "An activity involving
physical exertion and skill... one regu
lated by set rules or customs in which an
individual or team competes against an
other or others." Golf almost ticks all
the boxes, except physical exertion.
It's a game and that's not an insult.
There are many great games out there
that really test people to their limits.
Some require great hand-eye coordina
tion and intelligence, but what they
don't need is real athleticism.

You don't have to spend
hours in the gym honing
your body to shoot pool,
to bluff someone at
Texas Hold'Em, or to
hit under par on an 18-
hole course. A basic
level of fitness cer
tainly helps, but
that has little to
do with the
game being
played. Healthy
people can con
centrate longer and
think clearer and sim
ply aren't as likely to keel
over and die.
Algebra requires con
centration, but that
doesn't mean it's a j
sport. People don't
pack a stadium to
watch people do
math.
Mark Twain fa- Â»
mously said, "Golf is a \
good walk, ruined." If
only.
Players used to have to
walk reasonable distances
around a course, carrying
a bulky golf bag. Even this
was deemed too taxing,
too physical, so they in
vented caddies (someone
else to carry their stuff)
and even motorized
wheeled bags. Oh and the
eponymous golf cart, for
those for whom even
walking was a chore.
This is a long way from
shepherds knocking
stones into rabbit holes in
the wild highlands of
Scotland, but even those
origins don't really qual
ify it as a sport. These
peasants would have I
certainly been much I
fitter than the average I
modern golfer, but
their physical
shape, a result s
of a hard life
