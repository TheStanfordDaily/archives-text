# Golf demands plenty of athleticism
## 
### Danny Belch 
Golf is in the dictionary defini
tion of sport. Definition #1 for
"sport" is "an athletic activity
requiring skill or physical
prowess and often of a competitive na
ture, as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowl
ing, wrestling, etc." So while I could end
my argument right here, I will continue.
First let me address the counterargu
ments of why people think golf is not a
sport. One who believes golf is not a sport
including my colleague Tom over
there probably uses many of these
reasons: requires minimal physical exer
tion, you walk or even ride in a cart while
playing, the pros have someone carry
their bag for them, does not require fit
ness (i.e. John Daly), you deal with a ball
that is not moving, you can drink or
smoke while you play and even 80-year
olds can play.

These claims are erro
neous, of course. While
0 people who want to
believe these things can
believe them, they proba
bly have not played golf
or been on a golf course
or maybe even touched a
golf club in their life. Or,
they may just suck at it.
They do not know or do not
vant to believe (because they
>uck at it) that golf is actually
a sport, just like football,
baseball and basketball.
The Professional Golf
Association (PGA) is a
sports organization like
I the NFL, NBA, MLB
I and NFIL. The players
1 compete in matches
J and tournaments.
Scores are kept. There
_ are clearly defined rules,
f You have to perform
some task that requires
skill and technique. Some
one comes out a winner.
Golf is also one of the
hardest sports out there. The
critics who think golf is not
as sport often call it a game
or a hobby. Hitting a 250+
1 yard straight shot, putting
1 spin on the ball, hitting low
shots, draws and fades,
bunker shots and long
putts hardly falls under
the "hobby" category. A
hobby is stamp collect-
L ing or model car kits.
You don't go out and
practice six hours a day,
hitting thousands of balls,
for your hobby. A simple
game or hobby does not
have four prestigious
tournaments that are
some of the most identi
fiable and hallowed in
all athletics. A simple
game or hobby does not
