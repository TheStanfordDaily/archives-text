# Golf demands plenty of athleticism
## 
### Danny Belch 
Golf is in the dictionary defini
tion of sport. Definition #1 for
"sport" is "an athletic activity
requiring skill or physical
prowess and often of a competitive na
ture, as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowl
ing, wrestling, etc." So while I could end
my argument right here, I will continue.
First let me address the counterargu
ments of why people think golf is not a
sport. One who believes golf is not a sport
including my colleague Tom over
there probably uses many of these
reasons: requires minimal physical exer
tion, you walk or even ride in a cart while
playing, the pros have someone carry
their bag for them, does not require fit
ness (i.e. John Daly), you deal with a ball
that is not moving, you can drink or
smoke while you play and even 80-year
olds can play.

These claims are erro
neous, of course. While
0 people who want to
believe these things can
believe them, they proba
bly have not played golf
or been on a golf course
or maybe even touched a
golf club in their life. Or,
they may just suck at it.
They do not know or do not
vant to believe (because they
>uck at it) that golf is actually
a sport, just like football,
baseball and basketball.
The Professional Golf
Association (PGA) is a
sports organization like
I the NFL, NBA, MLB
I and NFIL. The players
1 compete in matches
J and tournaments.
Scores are kept. There
_ are clearly defined rules,
f You have to perform
some task that requires
skill and technique. Some
one comes out a winner.
Golf is also one of the
hardest sports out there. The
critics who think golf is not
as sport often call it a game
or a hobby. Hitting a 250+
1 yard straight shot, putting
1 spin on the ball, hitting low
shots, draws and fades,
bunker shots and long
putts hardly falls under
the "hobby" category. A
hobby is stamp collect-
L ing or model car kits.
You don't go out and
practice six hours a day,
hitting thousands of balls,
for your hobby. A simple
game or hobby does not
have four prestigious
tournaments that are
some of the most identi
fiable and hallowed in
all athletics. A simple
game or hobby does not
i demand a round of 18
I holes, where I will as
| sume over 80% of
golfers cannot even perform what
the course says they should per
form.
What my colleague Tom here
and several others do not quite un
derstand is that golf is one of the
most mentally taxing sports there is.
If you want to be good at golf, you
have to have one of the most solid
and unyielding heads around. You
have to be consistent over the
course of the entire round, hitting
each shot with a perfect swing, each
a carbon copy of the previous one.
Your swing mechanics have to be
perfect, otherwise your ball goes left
or right and you are screwed. You
have to hit a ball that is 1.68 inches in
diameter on the exact sweet spot of
your club and get it into a hole with
a diameter of 4.25 inches in the des
ignated amount of shots. A 300-yard
shot is worth the same as a one-inch
one. All of this, my friends, defines
golf as a sport.
And how can you argue that golf
is not a sport, when probably the
world's most identifiable athlete
Tiger Woods —is a golfer? How
can a multiple time winner of the
ESPY for Athlete of the Year not
play real sport? How about Nike
and Adidas, the world's leading
sportswear and athletic shoes sup
pliers? Nike and Adidas and many
other athletic companies are all
over golf, from balls to bags to shoes
to player endorsements. Woods has
been one of Nike's gems and one of
the figureheads of the Nike sport
brand. You don't see Nike sponsor
ing chess, backgammon, or Go Fish,
do you? I'd argue that the largest
sports companies pouring in mil
lions of dollars to golf and golfers le
gitimizes it as a sport.
I understand why you may not
consider golf a sport if you don't
play it. All you probably see is old
guys walking around hitting a sta
tionary ball, yelling and screaming,
smoking a cigar, riding in a cart in
between holes. You probably think
that golf is on the same level as fish
ing or chess, an activity that is in
comparable to tennis or soccer,
where people are running all over
the place. To the non-informed fan.

golf looks merely like a leisurely
walk in a grassy field. I will admit
golf does not require near the phys
ical exertion as running or basket
ball does. But how about a little hard
evidence to show that golf actually
requires some work?

Neil Wolkodoff, director of the
Rose Center for Health and Sports
Sciences in Denver, has data to back
me up. He took eight better-than
average golfers and tracked their
heart rate, oxygen consumption,
carbon dioxide production and how
far they were walking during a few
rounds of golf. The study's results
proved that there is significant ener
gy expenditure in golf, more than
bowling, fishing, curling and other
sports it has been compared to. Sub
jects walking and carrying their
clubs burned 721 calories per round,
while cart riders burned 411. The
data also suggested that players
"felt the burn" after walking two up
hill holes. Wolkodoff proved that
golf burns more calories than an
hour of billiards (216), fishing (302),
or even a canoe trip (345).
However, I am not saying that
sports are only sports if they burn
lots of energy. Curling was found to
burn 345 calories during an hour of
competition, but it is one of the
biggest sports in Canada, if not the
national pastime. The bottom line is
that golf is not a lazy man's sport.
You come home from a round tired.
If you are not in any sort of physical
shape you will struggle —just like
other real sports out there.
So is golf a sport? I say absolute
ly-
But I do have a set of clubs in my
garage.
