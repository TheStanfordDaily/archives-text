# Gobaud's nominees challenged
## Senate declines to confirm V.P. replacement for now 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate last
night began what will likely be a series of
damage control meetings to address two
back-to-back blights to the ASSU's credibil
ity as a governing body: former ASSU Vice
President Jay de la Torre 'lo's resignation
from his post last week and a Stanford
Review report alleging egregious discre
tionary spending by former ASSU
Executives Hershey Avula 'OB and
Mondaire Jones 'O9.

Following de la Torre's resignation,
ASSU President David Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO
said he would appoint current Co-Chief of
Staff Andy Parker 'll to the office of vice

president and appoint ASSU outsider Farah
Abuzeid 'lO to Parker's seat, asking for a
quick confirmation by the Senate and the
Graduate Student Council (GSC).
On Tuesday, ASSU Financial Manager
Matt McLaughlin 'OB advised the Senate to
confirm Parker but to work vigilantly to
restore the student body's confidence in its
governing bodies.
"I do think there is a bit of a credibility
crisis," McLaughlin said. "What Pm really
suggesting here is a broad, sweeping attempt
to revise your ethical standards and imple
ment them actually have them, imple
ment them and hold ourselves accountable."

After meeting with Parker and Co-Chief
Bennett Hauser 'lO, as well as with de la
Torre, Gobaud said Parker was the man for

the job.
"There's only two people on this campus
that can do it," Gobaud said. He said Hauser
was not interested in filling the spot.
While the ASSU constitution does not
explicitly give Gobaud the power to appoint
a vice president in this situation, he believes
that by extrapolation of some of its guide
lines specifically, those applicable when a
vice president replaces a president it can
be interpreted as granting him that ability
now.
The Senate also discussed drafting a code
of conduct with the GSC, modeled after the
University's own code, that would outline
expectations for elected student officials and
