# GYM POLICY
## WAITING TO WORKOUT 
### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
Students looking for excuses to avoid
working out may have one less complaint
to rely on this year. A new system for
keeping the lines for cardiovascular ma
chines moving seems to have eliminated many of
the clogging problems of previous years, though
according to some it remains far from perfect.
The cardiovascular machines at Arrillaga gym
including ellipticals, treadmills and cycling ma
chines often attract too many people hoping to
use them at the same time. Backlogs at peak work
out times can keep students frustrated, waiting by
the water fountains and glaring at the others get
ting their sweaty groove on as they hope for a
treadmill or elliptical machine to open up.
Approximately 1200 people walk through the
gym's doors each day. The gym holds 60 cardio
vascular machines, a number that seems large, but
often pales in comparison to the demand, espe
cially between 4 and 7 p.m., the gym's craziest
hours.
"It's definitely not enough to serve all the peo
ple who want it right when they want it," said
Wendy Fortino, assistant coordinator of Recre
ational Fitness and Wellness.

In the past, Arrillaga had employed a loud
speaker system, in which exercisers signed up on
a clipboard with what machines they hoped to
use and the gym workers at the desk would call
out the next name in line when a machine opened
up. This system frequently failed.
"The cardio paging rested all the cardio peo
ple on the shoulders of whoever was on staff at
the time for four hours they would be running
around like a person with her or his head cut off,"
Fortino said.'Tf they had to go to the bathroom or
anything that would hold everything up for like
five minutes, the person [who was waiting] could
leave or another person could get on."
Furthermore, people often couldn't hear their
names when called because of problems with the
speaker system, the announcer found themselves
unable to read the names on the signup sheet be
cause of messy handwriting, or people took mat
ters into their own hands and hopped right on the
machines, bypassing the signup system. Fortino
realized that something needed to change.
Visitors to the gym this year may notice a

pleasant absence of the crackly name
reading over the loudspeakers that
ruptured the mood music repeatedly
last year. Instead, an unobtrusive
signup sheet hangs on the wall above
the water fountains. When people get
on a machine, they can sign their
names next to the number of the ma
chine they are using, along with the
time they get on and the time they ex
pect to finish and when they get off
they erase their name.
This system not only frees up the
people working at the desk to focus on
other issues at the gym, it allows peo
ple to feel they have more control over
their workout destinies.

"It's self-regulated, so people can
walk up and know when a piece of
equipment is going to be free," Fortino
said. "It's so much nicer to be able to
do that rather than be put on a list and
not know if and when it's going to be
free in the next thirty minutes."

Jennifer Sexton, the coordinator of
gym programming, agrees that this
system makes more sense than paging.
"From our standpoint, it's easier to
manage because it kind of manages it
self, rather than having two staff peo
ple down there," Sexton said.
Many students find this year's sys
tem more constructive than last year's,
despite the slightly greater effort re
quired to sign up.
"This system might be better be
cause you can keep people account
able," said Carolina Zubiri 'l2. "Like, if
you go to treadmill number three and
supposedly it's been empty for two
hours but someone is using it, you can
ask them what they're doing."
Students working at the gym still
face complaints from exercisers, but
according to Fortino and other gym
workers, the numbers of complaints
seem much lower than last year.
One way in which the new system
regresses is that last year, students
could sign in and then go stretch or lift
weights as they waited to hear their
name, while with this sign up board,
people must still wait in line for ma
chines to free up.

According to a student who mans
the desk at Arrillaga who spoke
anonymously, budget cuts may be an
other factor in changing systems. Last
year, two people worked at the desk
during peak gym hours, while this year
the gym only fields one. This cut in
manpower would make the paging
system unfeasible.
However, the student said, "there
have been very few complaints ...
This system is almost based on the
honor system, it will work when peo
ple know there's a system and stick to
it."
Working out therefore joins the
ranks of test taking and CS-coding in
the realms of honor-based Stanford
activities. While the new sign up sys
tem has still garnered some com
plaints, there may be no completely
right answer aside from doubling the
size of the gym.
"Once people see how little time it
takes and how much easier it is in the
long run, people will like it," Fortino
said.
