# GYM POLICY
## WAITING TO WORKOUT 
### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
Students looking for excuses to avoid
working out may have one less complaint
to rely on this year. A new system for
keeping the lines for cardiovascular ma
chines moving seems to have eliminated many of
the clogging problems of previous years, though
according to some it remains far from perfect.
The cardiovascular machines at Arrillaga gym
including ellipticals, treadmills and cycling ma
chines often attract too many people hoping to
use them at the same time. Backlogs at peak work
out times can keep students frustrated, waiting by
the water fountains and glaring at the others get
ting their sweaty groove on as they hope for a
treadmill or elliptical machine to open up.
Approximately 1200 people walk through the
gym's doors each day. The gym holds 60 cardio
vascular machines, a number that seems large, but
often pales in comparison to the demand, espe
cially between 4 and 7 p.m., the gym's craziest
hours.
"It's definitely not enough to serve all the peo
ple who want it right when they want it," said
Wendy Fortino, assistant coordinator of Recre
ational Fitness and Wellness.

In the past, Arrillaga had employed a loud
speaker system, in which exercisers signed up on
a clipboard with what machines they hoped to
use and the gym workers at the desk would call
out the next name in line when a machine opened
up. This system frequently failed.
"The cardio paging rested all the cardio peo
ple on the shoulders of whoever was on staff at
the time for four hours they would be running
around like a person with her or his head cut off,"
Fortino said.'Tf they had to go to the bathroom or
anything that would hold everything up for like
five minutes, the person [who was waiting] could
leave or another person could get on."
Furthermore, people often couldn't hear their
names when called because of problems with the
speaker system, the announcer found themselves
unable to read the names on the signup sheet be
cause of messy handwriting, or people took mat
ters into their own hands and hopped right on the
machines, bypassing the signup system. Fortino
realized that something needed to change.

Stanford students exercise at the Arrillaga Center for Sports and Recreation. Arrillaga implemented a new system for reducing
wait times for the gym's cardiovascular machines, and the new policy has generally seen approval from exercisers on campus.
