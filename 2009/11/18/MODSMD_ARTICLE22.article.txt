# MEN'S TENNIS
## Not your average exhibition match 
### JACK DUANE 
At the first practice of the sea
son, Stanford men's tennis head
coach John Whitlinger asked his
team if they would be interested in
playing tennis against the inmates
of the notorious San Quentin State
Prison.
"We thought he was kidding at
first," remembers freshman Matt
Kandath. "At least half of the team
was laughing."
Whitlinger was not kidding and
six players eventually agreed to join
him at San Quentin this past Satur
day. Kandath, juniors Alex Clayton
and Greg Hirshman, sophomores
Ryan Thacher and Bradley Klahn
and freshman Dennis Lin woke up
at 6 a.m. and made the drive to
Marin County to play tennis inside
the famous prison.
San Quentin is best known as
the subject of Johnny Cash's song,
"San Quentin" and as the home of
all of California's death row in
mates. The prison is also home to a
tennis team that has been playing
visitors since 2005.
"I was definitely a little wor
ried," Hirshman said. "It's a very
strange feeling to enter a prison like
that."
San Quentin's "no hostage" pol
icy, which states that guards will not
negotiate with prisoners if hostages
are taken, did little to assuage the
anxieties of the players. Kandath
recalled his nerves upon entering
San Quentin.
"We walked around a corner and
could see all the prisoners out on the
yard," he said. "We were decked out
in our red Stanford jumpsuits, with
no idea what all these criminals are
thinking about us."
The players walked down to a
single, beat up tennis court and in

troduced themselves to the guards
and the San Quentin tennis team.
"They were very appreciative
that we had come to play with
them," Whitlinger noted. "Their
graciousness affected all of us."
Clayton and Thacher started the
day off with a four game doubles
match against two inmates.
"The inmates were trying like
hell to beat us it was really fun
tennis," Whitlinger said. "Lots of in
mates were watching and there was
constant chatter."
After three doubles matches,
Whitlinger led a "King of the Hill"
drill, with each Stanford player
partnered with an inmate.
"By that point in the day, the fact
the guy next to you is a criminal
wasn't scary anymore," Hirshman
commented.
When the tennis was over, the
inmates and guards led the Stan
ford team on a tour of the facility.
The team saw San Quentin's four
by-twelve foot two-man cells and
the death chamber.
"The atmosphere inside the
prison was very different than the
movies portray," Thacher said. "All
of the inmates were joking with
each other and the guards."
The team left the prison around
noon, but the memories of the day
will not soon fade,
"I think it's safe to say it was a
day I will never forget for the rest of
my life," Hirshman said.
"It was so strange to leave San
Quentin and realize that many of
those guys will never go outside
those walls ever again," he contin
ued. "We came home to arguably
the best place on earth and got to
watch Stanford beat USC."
