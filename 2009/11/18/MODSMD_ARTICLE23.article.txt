# Harbaugh will be here to stay
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Jim Harbaugh will be the long
time coach of Stanford foot
ball. If you're a student, he'll be
here after you graduate; if
you're a professor, he'll be here after
you get tenure.
Of this, I am confident.
Rumors last year about the New
York Jets opening? Meh.
Current speculation about Notre
Dame and Michigan? Hah!
At the risk of tempting fate
(knock on wood?), let me explain:
he's committed. He's committed to
the football program, to his players
and to the University.
We know this because Harbaugh's
filter is close to nonexistent. It's one
of his most prevailing traits that
and unbridled enthusiasm.
"We bow to no man, we bow to no
program here at Stanford Universi
ty"
He said that before he even
coached a game; it's since become a
mantra for the Cardinal faithful. That
is just one example amongst many.
Which isn't to say that he doesn't play
coy with the press â€”he certainly
does but when he has something
to say, he says it, regardless of the con
sequences or what others may think.
He is not a snake oil salesman; he's
blunt.
So, when Harbaugh sits down and
says that he wants to stay at Stanford
for 15-20 years, as he did this off-sea
son, I'm inclined to believe him. He
wants to build a perennial power
house, overcome the unique chal
lenges faced by Stanford, create a cul
ture and nail down a legacy.
But perhaps most telling about
Harbaugh's motivation is his out
ward feelings about his players. He
gushes about them. Harbaugh, a for
mer NFL star and Heisman con
tender at quarterback, said that
Owen Marecic embodies everything
he ever wanted to be as a football
player; he called Andrew Luck the
best passer in the nation and didn't
back down even after national scruti
ny; and he consistently refers to play
ers of all talent and skill levels as
"mighty men."
It's not just talk. When players are
injured on the field, Harbaugh helps
them off. At the Big Game media
luncheon, he arrived, ate and left
with Toby Gerhart; Cal coach Jeff
Tedford, by contrast, arrived after his
players, did not eat with them and
left early. Without presuming too
much about Tedford, given that there
were surely other scheduling vari
ables at play, that contrast encapsu
lates Harbaugh's inclination toward
his players.
But it's not just about the athletes.
Harbaugh simply gets Stanford. The
academic restrictions placed on his
recruiting are stricter than at any
other BCS school, but Harbaugh,
whose emphasis on blue-collar work
ethic is omnipresent, simply views it
as another challenge that must be
overcome. Given his success on the
trail thus far, the impediment hasn't
seemed to have stopped Stanford's
development.
In other words, he's committed to
the scholastic mission of the Univer
sity. How many other Division I
coaches post top ten lists of the play
ers with the most units and highest
GPAs? Don't worry, I'll wait. He
called out Michigan, his alma mater,
an excellent scholastic institution, for
lowering its standards for athletes.
He was flamed for his comments
until people looked and saw that he
was right.
That's one hurdle to keeping him
that we can knock down. We can do
the same with finances. Stanford can
not offer him the same contract that
other schools can; the University is
strapped for cash and there are per
sistent concerns about giving a mas
sive sum to someone outside the
realm of academia. Harbaugh could
get far more than the $1.25 million
he's due to receive in his soon-to
come contract extension, but in talk
ing about it, he seems perfectly con
tent. He'll also likely receive some of
the amenities that many other colle
giate coaches get the $50,000
bathroom, for example and other
"gifts" to keep him satisfied.
But at a certain point, it's not
about money as much as it is comfort
he has stated, on multiple occa
sions, how much he and his family
love Palo Alto. That won't necessari
ly override an eight-figure contract,
but it does go a long way. He grew up
here; it's familiar.
There is, as always, a caveat: fan
support. No, this column was not a
ruse to get more people out to games.
But Harbaugh has long bemoaned
