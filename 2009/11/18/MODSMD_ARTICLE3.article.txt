## 'Making headway' in tsunami prep U.N. awards prize to Engineers for Sustainable World team 
### TYLER BROWN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The student-founded Engineers for a
Sustainable World has received a 10,000
euro Mondialogo Engineering Award from
the United Nations Educational Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and
Daimler AG for its work on tsunami readi
ness and reactions in Indonesia.
The group announced its award Tuesday
and shared the results of its summer 2009
study on the tsunami readiness of Padang
City, Indonesia, as well as observations of the
accuracy and effectiveness of the survey fol
lowing a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in
September 2009.
In summer 2009, ESW partnered with
GeoHazards International (GHI) to send
Stanford students to Padang City to evaluate
tsunami readiness and suggest potential
improvements to the current state of pre
paredness.
ESW intern and civil and environmental
engineering graduate student Kelly Wood
M.S. 'lO, who went to Padang City in summer
2009, said it is in one of the highest-risk loca
tions in the world for tsunamis, as it sits in
one of the most active earthquake zones in
the world. She said there are 20 minutes
between when an earthquake hits and a
tsunami reaches shore.
Most of Padang City is less than 10
meters above sea level, making it extremely
susceptible to water-related natural disas
ters. Engineering researcher Scott
Henderson, who also traveled to Padang
City this summer, said the students evaluat
ed the evacuation structures available to res
idents and explored different options avail
able for easier evacuation in the event of a
tsunami.
They found that evacuation solutions are
extremely site-specific and depend on the
terrain and available infrastructure. In some
places, such as within the city, Henderson
said, "vertical evacuation" into stable build
ings is a better option, while closer to the
countryside, "horizontal evacuation" would
be more practical.
They also found that earthquake studies
as of summer 2009 were misinformed.
"Our key conclusion was that the current
surveys don't adequately consider the suit
ability of current structures from a structur
al engineering perspective," Henderson said.
Within the city, they evaluated potential
buildings for use during an earthquake for
clear potential hazards, researched the social
and cultural implications of their use and
scrutinized the structural integrity.
The effects of "transient drifts" on build-
ing damage were also tested using
small-scale replicas.
"You build a structural model
and . . . essentially you push the
building a certain distance and try
to see how much the building's
going to move when subjected to
the earthquake," Henderson said.
In the end, they found several
buildings that they thought were
earthquake-resistant and concluded
that reinforcing them would proba
bly be less expensive than creating
new structures.
A likely inexpensive and durable
option the team found for tsunami
evacuations sites were raised dirt
mounds where buildings or sports
fields could be constructed.
Earthquake-resistant buildings are
more expensive and require expert
ise that most coastal communities
in developing countries do not
have.
Most of Padang City is separated

from higher ground by a river, so
the team also created a standard
method to determine whether or
not its bridges would survive a high
magnitude earthquake.
As another part of the initiative,
the group determined the public
tsunami preparedness efforts in
place and researched the feasibility
of better ways of preparing resi
dents. At the time, Henderson said,
50,000 people would be unable to
evacuate within 30 minutes of a
tsunami's striking.
The team focused on developing
early warning systems, planning
evacuation routes, conducting evac
uation drills and educating people
about the tsunami risk.
Henderson and Wood returned
to Padang City in October after a
7.6 magnitude earthquake, which
did not cause a tsunami, rocked the
Indonesian coast. They wanted to
see how to evaluate the accuracy of
their predictions.
One building they mentioned, a
mosque, generally performed how
they had expected: a few tiles fell
from the ceiling and some partition
walls crumbled, but the building

overall remained intact.
There are still some problems
remaining. During the most recent
earthquake, people were still run
ning out of buildings and jumping
on their bikes and in their cars, as
opposed to entering designated safe
areas.
"Awareness and education are
very, very good, but people don't
evacuate the way they're supposed
to," said Veronica Cedillos M.S. 'OB,
project manager for GHI. "It brings
up the second issue: [a building]
needs to survive so well that people
aren't afraid to go into it."
ESW was one of 30 organiza
tions worldwide to receive a
Mondialogo Award, intended for
groups with project proposals
designed to improve the quality of
life in developing countries.
Despite the work that remains,
the ESW group believes its efforts
have been successful.
"I think we made a lot of head
way over the summer," Henderson
said.
