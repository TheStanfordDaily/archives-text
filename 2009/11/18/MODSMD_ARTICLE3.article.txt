The student-founded Engineers for a
Sustainable World has received a 10,000
euro Mondialogo Engineering Award from
the United Nations Educational Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and
Daimler AG for its work on tsunami readi
ness and reactions in Indonesia.
The group announced its award Tuesday
and shared the results of its summer 2009
study on the tsunami readiness of Padang
City, Indonesia, as well as observations of the
accuracy and effectiveness of the survey fol
lowing a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in
September 2009.
In summer 2009, ESW partnered with
GeoHazards International (GHI) to send
Stanford students to Padang City to evaluate
tsunami readiness and suggest potential
improvements to the current state of pre
paredness.
ESW intern and civil and environmental
engineering graduate student Kelly Wood
M.S. 'lO, who went to Padang City in summer
2009, said it is in one of the highest-risk loca
tions in the world for tsunamis, as it sits in
one of the most active earthquake zones in
the world. She said there are 20 minutes
between when an earthquake hits and a
tsunami reaches shore.
Most of Padang City is less than 10
meters above sea level, making it extremely
susceptible to water-related natural disas
ters. Engineering researcher Scott
Henderson, who also traveled to Padang
City this summer, said the students evaluat
ed the evacuation structures available to res
idents and explored different options avail
able for easier evacuation in the event of a
tsunami.
They found that evacuation solutions are
extremely site-specific and depend on the
terrain and available infrastructure. In some
places, such as within the city, Henderson
said, "vertical evacuation" into stable build
ings is a better option, while closer to the
countryside, "horizontal evacuation" would
be more practical.
They also found that earthquake studies
as of summer 2009 were misinformed.
"Our key conclusion was that the current
surveys don't adequately consider the suit
ability of current structures from a structur
al engineering perspective," Henderson said.
Within the city, they evaluated potential
buildings for use during an earthquake for
clear potential hazards, researched the social
and cultural implications of their use and
scrutinized the structural integrity.
The effects of "transient drifts" on build-
