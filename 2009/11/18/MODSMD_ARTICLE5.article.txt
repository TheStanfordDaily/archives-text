## Fewer students opt for three-year plan Early grad rates down from five-year average 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
According to data from the Office of the
Registrar, just seven students in 2009 fin
ished their undergraduate studies after three
years down from 21 five years ago and an
average of 16 in each year since then.
Why the decline?
Students and advisers can only guess,
explaining that the University generally
frowns on the fast track and that a stronger
financial aid program may also be a factor.

But some early graduates say they had
other reasons, and two shared with The Daily
that, for the most part, they feel they made
the right choice,
Ty McCormick 'lO entered Stanford in
the fall of 2007 with some credit from
Advanced Placement tests and said he decid
ed to finish in three years to "save time and
money."
"Technically, you can [graduate early] by
taking 20 units every quarter," McCormick
said. "It's certainly feasible to do. I'm going
to either co-term or get a master's, and I
might as well do it in four years instead of
five."
Dan Blocksom 'OB, currently a second
year law student here, graduated from
Stanford in two years and two quarters with
a degree in economics. He graduated early

because he entered college with 40 units of
transferable credit, but always planned on
attending graduate school.
"I was pretty sure I was going to law
school, so I might as well get out as quickly as
possible," Blocksom said.
He added that graduating early depends
heavily on the type of degree pursued.
McCormick, a political science major, also
had time to both declare a minor in Arabic
and study abroad with the Oxford program.
But, from Blocksom's experience, "students
who are engineering majors probably can't
do it because there's too many [prerequi
sites]."
According to Assistant Registrar Celeste
Fowles, the process of graduating is exactly
the same regardless of the amount of
time spent at the University. Students
must still apply in Axess and have to
meet all department requirements.
"From [the registrar's] perspec
tive, the procedures are the same
whether a student graduates in three
years or four," Fowles said in an e
mail to The Daily.
But while the logistics of the
process may be simple, Andrew
Dimock, an Undergraduate Advising
and Research adviser and former
academic director, explained that the
University's philosophy on graduat
ing early is more complex.

"So much of the educational
experience at Stanford comes from
ranging widely, from exploring
everything the University offers,
beyond the simple fulfillment of
major and degree requirements,"
Dimock said in an e-mail to The

Daily. "Institutionally, we have a
strong preference that students make
the most of their opportunities and
take the four years."
When counseling students who
are considering the three-year
option, he said, "I don't try to dis
suade them from their three-year
goal. Instead, I ask them to consider
what they're willing to give up,
because there will be trade-offs."
Dimock said many freshmen in
fall quarter talk about graduating
early, but few follow through. He
added that he's only worked with "a
handful" of such students.
"With Stanford's heightened level
of commitment to financial aid over
the past two years, my sense is that
fewer students coming from a back
ground of economic hardships feel
pressure to graduate in three as a
means of saving on tuition," he
explained, "but that's anecdotal."
Other students who become
interested, he said, are pre-meds
"daunted" by the many years of
school ahead, international students
who want to pursue other interests

while in the U.S., and athletes who
may pursue careers in professional
sports.

Whatever the reason, Blocksom
and McCormick offered evidence
that there are, as Dimock said, trade
offs.

"I've been able to have a pretty
normal experience, but it's been very
complicated trying to take advantage
of the abroad programs because
they're not geared toward students in
unique situations," McCormick said.

Blocksom said that as an under
graduate, he sometimes "missed
out."

"I had a part-time job while in
school, and I was pretty busy most of

the time, so I guess I missed out on
most of the social stuff, but... I was
n't heartbroken enough to stay
longer," he said.
In that regard, McCormick and
Blocksom, as early graduates, may be
part of a dying breed and perhaps
that's for the better, explained
Dimock.

"The degree of freedom you have
at this time of your life is really
unparalleled, though that's hard to
see when you have three problem
sets due," Dimock said. "Don't rush
through it."
