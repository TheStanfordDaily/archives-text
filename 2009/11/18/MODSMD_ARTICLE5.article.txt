## Fewer students opt for three-year plan Early grad rates down from five-year average 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
According to data from the Office of the
Registrar, just seven students in 2009 fin
ished their undergraduate studies after three
years down from 21 five years ago and an
average of 16 in each year since then.
Why the decline?
Students and advisers can only guess,
explaining that the University generally
frowns on the fast track and that a stronger
financial aid program may also be a factor.

But some early graduates say they had
other reasons, and two shared with The Daily
that, for the most part, they feel they made
the right choice,
Ty McCormick 'lO entered Stanford in
the fall of 2007 with some credit from
Advanced Placement tests and said he decid

money."

said. "It's certainly feasible to do. I'm going
to either co-term or get a master's, and I
might as well do it in four years instead of
five."
Dan Blocksom 'OB, currently a second
year law student here, graduated from
Stanford in two years and two quarters with
a degree in economics. He graduated early

because he entered college with 40 units of
transferable credit, but always planned on
attending graduate school.
"I was pretty sure I was going to law
school, so I might as well get out as quickly as
possible," Blocksom said.
He added that graduating early depends
heavily on the type of degree pursued.
McCormick, a political science major, also
had time to both declare a minor in Arabic
and study abroad with the Oxford program.
But, from Blocksom's experience, "students
who are engineering majors probably can't
do it because there's too many [prerequi
sites]."
According to Assistant Registrar Celeste
Fowles, the process of graduating is exactly
