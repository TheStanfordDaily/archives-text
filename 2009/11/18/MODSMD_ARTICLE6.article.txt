"Smart on crime."
That's how San Francisco District
Attorney Kamala Flarris described her
tenure and labeled her run for state
attorney general last night at a full-house
talk sponsored by the Stanford Black
Pre-Law Society.
"We have been given false choices, the
choice that you can be either soft on
crime or tough on crime," Flarris said.
"We need to be smart on crime."
Harris, 45, is in her second term as
D.A. and has thrown her hat in the ring
for the 2010 state attorney general race.
The audience pressed her lightly on her
stance against the death penalty, but she
spent most of the evening touting her
accomplishments as D.A.
The jail re-entry rate for 18- to 24-
year-olds has dropped from 54 percent to
less than 10 percent, she said. Harris also
cited improved attendance in elementary
schools, a doubling in trial conviction
rates for gun felonies, an 85 percent con
viction rate for homicides and the cre
ation of the nation's first Human
Trafficking Unit in a local prosecutor's
office.
On truancy, Harris explained specific
measures she has implemented to pre

Noting that truancy strongly predicts the
likelihood to commit a crime in the
future, she said that before she entered
office, 5,500 students fell into the "habit
ually truant" category, missing up to a
third of all school days. 2,400 were ele
mentary school students.
But the problem is overlooked, she
said.
"If you did a survey of people and
asked them what were the four or five
biggest problems in the community, per
sonal safety would probably be on top,
and if you waited for truancy, it would
come up on one, maybe," Harris said.
"But 50 percent of black and Hispanic
ninth graders will not graduate high
school. If you walk into a jail in any coun
ty, you will see those numbers reflected."
"A child going without an education is
tantamount to a crime, so I'm going to
start prosecuting parents for truancy,"
Harris said of her thought process.
Threatening parents with jail time if
their children missed school paid off, she
said, both in reduced truancy rates and in
increased help for struggling families, as
prosecution investigations brought their
