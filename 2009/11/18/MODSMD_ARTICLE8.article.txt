## Swept Away 
### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG 
It was 10 p.m. on a Saturday /J
night and rather than
partying it up at frat row,
30 freshmen from Serra House were
courageously venturing into the
world of broomball.
Often described as hockey on ice,
broomball consists of two teams compet
ing to score more goals than the other. The
sport's name comes from the broom-like
sticks that players use to hit the five-inch
round ball. Broomball's distinguishing
characteristic â€”no skating skills neces
sary.
"Picture yourself playing ice hockey,
then take away the ice skates and wear ten
nis shoes," explained Hilary Stone 'l3,
social co-chair for Serra House. "Then take
away the hockey puck, put in a foam ball
and then make the goals three times small
er. That's basically broomball."

W "It's kind of like ice hockey, except you
f don't have skates and there's no puck,"
added Kevin Le 'l3. "Instead of a puck
there's a ball and you're basically running
on ice trying to score a goal."
The term "running," however, is some
what of a misnomer. Shuffling, skidding
and sliding more appropriately describe
the happenings at the Belmont Iceland ice
rink that night. No one returned to the
dorm without having fallen at least once.
"About two minutes within getting onto
the ice, I slipped and fell really, really
hard," said Alicia Triana 'l3. "Luckily I did
n't fall for the rest of the game, except for
once."
Santiago Ibarra 'l3 shared his own
experience.
"We're not allowed to hit people, so it's
only dangerous if you fall over," he said. "It
hurts, but it's not deadly."
As it happens, broomball evolved from
a rather life-threatening tenth century
Icelandic game known as Knattleikr.

According to the Australian broomball I
league Web site, Knattleikr "was one of |
the roughest games invented and often
deaths were reported from the games."
Little else is known about the origins of
broomball. There are generally five theo
ries surrounding the sport's existence.
Perhaps the most peculiar of the five spec
ulates that soccer players were inspired by
a group of small boys swatting a ball with
toy brooms.
Broomball as we know it first appeared
in Canada in the early 1900s and in the
United States in the 19305. Modern broom
ball has since spread to Australia, Japan,
Sweden, Germany and Switzerland, to
name a few. The sport continues to expand
its global presence, with the International
Federation of Broomball Associations
(IFBA) pushing to add broomball to next
year's Winter Olympics.
In the Stanford community, the level of
competitiveness surrounding broomball
nowhere near rivals that of the ancient

[i Icelanders or the
IFBA. Despite general
good opinions of the sport,
broomball has yet to claim a
place in campus intramurals or in the club
community. Usually it's the occasional
freshman dorm that plans and sponsors
broomball outings for its residents.
"[lt's] a fun event to do on a Saturday
night when the parties aren't exactly the
best," Stone said, who organized the event.
"With everyone going out and doing their
own stuff, it was nice to have an experience
that brought the dorm together for one
night."
Triana echoed Stone's sentiment, insist
ing that an evening of broomball was
worth the inevitable aches and pains.
"I was sore for a couple of days after
ward, but it was so much fun," she said. "I
would do it again a thousand times."
