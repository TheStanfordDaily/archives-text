## Chemo undeterred by fertility treatment 
### MILING YAN 
For younger women, the devasta
tion of a cancer diagnosis is often com
pounded by the stress of potential
infertility. Many are deterred from
undergoing procedures to preserve
their fertility due to the fear that they
would have to delay crucial
chemotherapy treatments.
Stanford physicians, however,
published a reassuring study last
week in the "Journal of American
College Surgeons" revealing that
breast cancer patients under the age
of 40 do not have to significantly
postpone chemo in order to have fer
tility treatments.
Dr. Irene Wapnir, the chief of breast
surgery in the surgical oncology
department, and Dr. Lynn Westphal, a
reproductive endocrinologist, led the
physicians in examining the time
lapsed between diagnosis and adjuvant
chemotherapy.
The average lapsed time to treat
ment was 71 days for a group of 19
women who underwent fertility
preservation, as opposed to 67 days for
a control group of 63 who did not
undergo fertility preservation. The
median lag times were also similar at
30 days and 29 days, respectively.
Neither difference was statistically sig
nificant.

"Bias in the surgical and medical
community is [that if] you have cancer,
don't think about these other things.
The most important thing is to cure
you of your cancer," Wapnir said.
Breast cancer survivors may experi
ence infertility for many reasons. Some
fear the reoccurrence of cancer during
the hormonal fluctuations of pregnan
cy. Others undergo early menopause as
a result of the chemotherapy.
"If you're a woman who hasn't had
kids or [is] a little bit on the older side
and you're talking about treatments
that go on five or six years, when you
come out of this dark tunnel you may
have lost the opportunity to have a
child," Wapnir said.
To provide a new chance at fertility,
Westphal has been extracting and
freezing the eggs of breast cancer

patients since 1998. The process
involves treatment with Tamoxifen, an
estrogen suppressor and the follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH) for 10-12
days. A needle is then used to aspirate
the egg-containing follicles during a 15-
minute procedure. The recovery time is
two weeks at most. Meanwhile, the
eggs or embryos are frozen, to be
implanted at a later date.
The entire process requires a coor
dinated effort by a surgeon, reproduc
tive endocrinologist and medical
oncologist.
"The only way to make this work is
to have good communication,"
Westphal said. "If you act expeditious
ly and you have a good team working
together, you can provide this service
without compromising the care of the
patient."
Nancy Magee, a lab manager in the
department of Microbiology and
Immunology, was diagnosed with
breast cancer eight years ago at the age
of 34 and subsequently underwent a
double mastectomy. Magee said that
advances in treatment have a signifi
cant impact.
"If, back then, I had the opportuni
ty to have my eggs harvested, I would,
in a heartbeat," said Magee, who
already had a child at the time of diag
nosis. "[The treatment] gives a woman
hope too. If a woman thinks: "x' years
down the line, when my body's ready,
let's go for it," she's got something to
look forward to."
Wapnir and Westphal already have
anecdotal evidence of these positive
emotional and psychological effects
and plan to systematically examine
them in the future.
"What women want, if they're
unlucky enough to have breast cancer,
is to be cured of the disease and to get
back to normal lives," Dr. Wapnir said.
"People want to be survivors and
healthy survivors, not maimed, not psy
chologically scarred."
"This is an example of something
that brings us one step closer to making
that happen for patients," she added.
