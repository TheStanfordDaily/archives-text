## Students fast for Darfur fundraising 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Tuesday, 450 students pledged to
fast or give up a luxury and then
donate that money to the Darfur
Stoves project, an effort that "works
to create sustainable solutions to
humanitarian problems in Darfur
by utilizing technology that is
respectful of the culture and envi
ronment."
STAND: A Student Anti-
Genocide Coalition was the lead
sponsor of the event. According to
STAND President Angie McPhaul
'lO, enough funds have been raised
for 200 to 300 stoves and counting.
The project's centerpiece, the
Berkeley Darfur Stove, is signifi
cantly more efficient than other, tra
ditional stoves. The project aims to
reduce extended trips for firewood,
a danger for women in Darfur, and
to save labor time that can be put to
use in seeking out other opportuni
ties.
UC-Berkeley held a fast of its
own on the same day, in a spirit of
cooperation before Big Game.
"It's been a joint project from
the beginning between Stanford
and Cal, so we thought we might as
well fundraise together," McPhaul
said.
STAND will continue to collect
donations through Friday and will
be in White Plaza that day from
11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The organiza
tion Humanity United will also
match donations through Friday.
