## Humanist author gives perspective 
### ANN TYLER MOSES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Harvard's Humanist Chaplain,
Greg Epstein, the one billion people
in this world who do not embrace a
specific religion still have the ability
and thus the responsibility, to do
good and effect change.
Epstein's shared his humanist
philosophies and his new book,
"Good Without God: What a Billion
Nonreligious People Do Believe,"
last night in front of an audience of
around 150 community members
and Stanford students gathered at
Cubberley Auditorium.
Epstein's goal for his visit was to
encourage more people at Stanford
to be involved in Humanism, which,
according to Stanford's Atheists,
Humanists and Agnostics (AHA!) is
an inclusive, ethical philosophy,
focused on rational thought and sci
entific knowledge, that transcends
denominational religions.
Humanists typically identify as
atheists or agnostics, but Epstein
stresses that the philosophy encom
passes much more.
"Atheist or agnostic refers to a
god that is at the center of other peo
ple's point of view, but it's not the
center of my point of view," Epstein
said in an interview with The Daily.
"The center of my worldview is not
anyone's god, but it is this world, it's
this life. It's making this world and
this life, though they will never be
perfect, as good as they can be for all
human beings."
At Stanford, Epstein spoke about
the necessity of constructive dia-

logue and cooperation between reli
gious and secular groups to solve
urgent problems.
"Global warming doesn't care
whether we believe in God or not,"
Epstein reminded the audience.
Genetics graduate student Joe
Foley, the president of AHA!,
agrees.
"Without including theology or
the supernatural, we can still come
together with like-minded people,"
Foley said. "Atheists and Christians
can come together and work for
social justice, setting aside our theo
logical differences."
After Epstein finished speaking,
attendees were invited to ask ques
tions, facilitating their own dialogue
with him about issues facing both the

Humanist community and the world
at large.
Epstein was grateful to see the
Stanford community's interest in his
work, but he believes that an even
greater Humanist presence on cam
pus is needed.
"My role at Harvard is really in
helping students to think through
questions of meaning and purpose in
life together," he said. "I look for
ward to helping people in the
Stanford community in the future to
organize something like that."
According to Epstein, Humanism
hopes to provide to the non-religious
some of the benefits of religion that
he says have little to do with actual
belief the fellowship, discussion,
community, memories and music.
The event was sponsored by the
ASSU Speakers Bureau and by the
Silicon Valley Coalition of Reason, a
regional union of non-religious
organizations that AHA! has recent
ly joined.
Epstein's motivation in writing his
book was to emphasize that goodness,
too, can come without faith.
"There are a billion people in this
world who define themselves as non
religious, and I wanted to help those
people understand that they are not
just against religion, they are for
something," he said.
"Most of them, I think, really
believe in doing good and living the
best lives that they can here in this
world, and that's what they stand
for," he added.
