## EDITORIAL Move back the Study List deadline 
### 
In an undergraduate education that Stan
ford promotes as a process of dynamic ex
ploration that allows students to "discov
er intellectual and personal passions," flexi
bility of academic planning plays a crucial
role. Stanford students are encouraged to de
liberate and fluctuate over their choice of
major, take classes for no reason other than
sheer interest and dive into new ideas and in
terests without worrying that they might fail.
In this course of discovery, some paths will
lead to remarkable successes, and others will
inevitably dead-end. But these dead-ends
should not be cause for grief, and students
must not be punished for changing their
minds.
It is for these reasons that the Editorial
Board places a high value on the "shopping"
period during which students may add or
drop classes, and the Board urges the Univer
sity to restore a sufficient amount of time for
this process.
For the 2009-2010 school year, the Regis
trar requires students to submit a Final
Study List meaning no classes can be
added or dropped about a week and a
half earlier than the drop deadline has been
in years past. While this change might not
seem like much, in the compressed timeline
of the quarter system, a week and a half can
certainly be felt.
The biggest constraint occurs for students
wishing to drop a course because of a failing
midterm grade, which can often indicate a
level of material too advanced to be current
ly undertaken. On the old academic sched
ule, grades from initial midterms were often
returned before the drop deadline, giving
students the option of lightening their loads

if problems arose. Now, however, almost no
classes are able to administer tests or even
move into more complex material before stu
dents have to decide whether to stay.
At a school where students experience so
much success, expectations often soar ahead
of academic development, and students chal
lenge themselves with classes beyond their
level. When this realization hits home, it
often comes as a rude shock. But the conse
quences of unforeseen letdowns need not be
dire if students are allowed to escape classes
for which they are unprepared.
Overloaded academic schedules present
another hurdle for many students, taking a
long list with the intention of dropping the
one they find least important if the workload
proves unbearable. Most exertions, however,
do not occur right at the beginning of the
quarter, and students need time to assess the
feasibility of their plans.
Stanford students often aim for astro
nomical achievements way off the charts. At
the same time, one of the greatest strengths
of this University is that those students often
succeed. Toby Gerhart, for instance, has
spent this quarter as one of the nation's lead
ing contenders for the Heisman Trophy while
taking 21 units for his MS&E major. With
such an ambitious undertaking, it seems only
fair to provide enough time to decide
whether successful completion can even be
possible.
One of the last things Stanford wants its
students to develop is a fear of failure, and
people who remain in their comfort zones
can be a detriment to the University. The
ability to drop classes represents a vital safe
ty net, and it ought to be restored to its fullest.
