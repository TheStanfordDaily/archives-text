# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## The
						Art of Love, Revised 2009 Edition with Interactive CD-ROM So, given the choice between cleaning your room and cleaning your Facebook, I highly recommend the latter. 
### Emily Hulme 
Sometimes, guys ask me how to impress
women, as if women were complicated.
Truth is, there is one way, and one way
only it's called Facebook. You might
protest that you don't even need a Facebook.
Sure. I guess you don't need to shower either,
but Fm not trying to help the helpless; Fm
trying to augment the chances of misguided
souls.

You might wonder why your Facebook is
so important. I think the reasoning goes
something like this: Hollywood, performing
its didactic function, has taught girls they
have approximately seven years to find a
man after they turn 18. After that, the coach
turns back into a pumpkin, the horses go
back to rats and Cinderella becomes the bit
ter old hag youth has hidden under layers of
hopes and dreams. Thus, women will quickly
assess value based on the tried and true sys
tem of What Do My Friends Think. Menfolk
don't realize how much this matters, and,
frankly, her friends haven't met you while
punchdrunk from Cupid's arrows, or even
just plain drunk from Sigma Who's punch.
They're going to judge you based on whatev
er your Facebook says, and harshly.
So, given the choice between cleaning
your room and cleaning your Facebook, I
highly recommend the latter. If that special
girl sees your room, she's already swallowed
your lines, hook, bait and sinker, and it will
take either a roommate or truly terrible
music (Creed comes to mind) for you to blow
it. On the other hand, if, say, she goes scam
pering into her friend's room to show off her
coming date's Facebook, and during the
course of stalking they discover you're the ne
plus ultra douchebag extraordinaire, you can
expect a text canceling your Friday night
plans due to a forgotten problem set, "sry."
I've been conducting a highly scientific
study on how to make your Facebook look
less tool-y to the average Stanford dame for
some time now by analyzing over 300,000
AA-grade tooltastic Facebook profiles,
along with videos, pictures, pick-up lines and
fur lined coats gleaned by a few hundred of
my closest friends. Although I'm still playing
around with the numbers with the help of
Peter Orszag to enhance my story, I have
some preliminary conclusions you might find
of interest.

Admitting anything about yourself is a
precarious venture. Facebook, capitalizing
on human vanity, has somehow managed to
make it seem desirable to admit your favorite
books to people who presumably have never
met you and don't necessarily understand
the intended irony of listing Jodi Picoult as
your favorite writer. Unless you're either a
Buddhist monk or Justin Bobby, though, you
probs can't get away with not listing any-

thing, so it's best to stick with something re
tard-proof. There are all the typical ones to
choose from, like "Catcher in the Rye" if you
want to seem angsty, "1984" if you are an in
dependent-minded rebel, and "The
Stranger" if you'd like to show how well
versed you are in existential literature and
philosophy. If you're after an average girl,
there's no need to reach for the stars, but
make sure you spell the name correctly. Seri
ously.
But, you're better than all these. I'd even
dare say you're too sexy for all these. Make it
something fresher, hipper, more poetic and
less cliche. Perhaps the key is to still pick a
recognizable title that won't pigeonhole you
at all. Maybe Proust. I don't think it's legal to
buy "Swann's Way" if you're under 18, so you
should be safely able to claim it as a favorite
without knowing any plot details, and it got a
shout-out in "Little Miss Sunshine," which is
just kitschy enough to make it legit.
Turning to music, the task is less difficult,
in my opinion. Just put Johnny Cash.
Finally, selecting a picture need not be a
perilous endeavor. Forget the propaganda
pushed by Abercrombie. A recent study con
cluded that most women found scruff, pot
bellies, and eau du beer attractive, and I can't
tell you how many times I've listened to a
friend complain about how her boyfriend
wasn't nearly unwashed enough. Actually, I
can, as it is precisely zero times, but I'm sure
they'll reorient their preferences around this
study. So feature these qualities of yourself,
and, if necessary, airbrush to this effect.
This exhausts my research, and for the
rest, as the great philosopher Bon Qui Qui
once said, "Do it your way, but don't get
crazy."

Emily would like to thank all the little people
who made this possible, but, unfortunately,
they're all taller than she is. Criticize her genet
ic shortness at ehulme@stanford.edu.
