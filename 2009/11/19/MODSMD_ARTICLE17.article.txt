# FLECHAS Y PEDRADAS
## The 						turkey makes me reconsider... 
### Patrick Kozey 
One day, a few weeks ago, I exited the
metro. After leaving the mouth of the
underground tunnels, the air by the
bus station always feels crisp. The feeling
fades a bit after you walk by the ever-present,
slowly-circulating river of cabs winding by the
bus station the smell coming off in waves
from the fish-filled dumpsters behind the
market is too strong. But that day, I rounded
the corner and smiled anyway. They were
stringing up the lights.
The Christmas lights are already up here
in Barcelona. Why so soon? No Thanksgiving
to serve as a culturally-approved marker to
open the decoration season. It was a couple of
weeks ago that I first noticed the lights on the
main city streets, suspended between trees
over the pedestrian walkways in the middle
of las Ramblas or on Diagonal. I can honestly
say I didn't think much of them. Then my res
idencies followed suit. Now, when I need to di
rect a cab to the doorstep I just give a vague
address and then point out the lights up on
the right.There are strands hanging three feet
down from the overhang of the awning, and
more still trace the six stories from the roof to
the ground. And yes, these are Christmas
lights. Not holiday lights. Christmas lights, be
cause here no one had the inconvenient idea
of allowing for a difference in religious views.
Like I said, the light displays have started
popping up so "early," from my perspective,
because Spain lacks the easy benchmark of
Thanksgiving to demarcate their appropri
ateness. Thanksgiving itself is seemingly more
important to me now than I would have liked
being away from it certainly adds to its ap
peal. Odd that it would be some strategically
placed, celebratory electric lighting that
would make that dawn on me, but it was all
the same. These past weeks have, accordingly,
been the only time I really felt any genuine
pangs of homesickness. Being homesick is
more, after all, than just wishing yourself clos
er to certain people or things. To be homesick
is to really feel the other world that's moving
on without you. It just hurts all the more when
you remember that it's that world where
things are the way you expect them to be, and
that world has no trouble going on in your ab
sence.

So, what's an American in Barcelona to
do? Since we have no ovens in our "kitchens"
in the residencia, cooking is mostly off the
table. Whole turkeys are, after all, pretty hard

to deal with on the stovetop. Certainly
enough to increase the appeal of a slice or two
of turkey followed by the right sorts of pie. In
response, Irish pubs the city over have been
trotting out special notices of menus served
on the day of, even if that's the only acknowl
edgement of the holiday anywhere. It looks
like for the first time, I can remember some
one will be making my Thanksgiving dinner
in a restaurant.
Why does it really matter? It's odd, but
thinking of the brief respite from work and
stress the holiday weekend offers to family
and friends is a reminder as to how pleasant
ly adrift I've been these past months. What we
might only feel for a week each fall for the
rest of our lives, my friends and I in Spain
have felt for months. Not through purposeful
avoidance or neglect of our duties, but be-

cause here, there is always an excuse. If we
want to take the easy way out, we can. Alfin y
al cabo , no one expects much out of people
who aren't really from here, who don't really
know what they're doing or how to navigate
in a new culture and a different language.
So, we laugh about it. Then, we crack a few
more beers or another bottle of wine that we
couldn't have bought in America, and we try
to shrug it off. Like it's normal. Like there's
nothing wrong. Eventually, we won't get to do
that anymore. Eventually, the excuses will dry
up, run out, evaporate we'll be back home,
and ?que nos quedara? Huellas , tracks, noth
ing else. We should be ready for that.
