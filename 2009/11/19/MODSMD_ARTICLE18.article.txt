## SPORTS BRIEFS Women's basketball takes on Pepperdine 
### 
No. 2 Stanford Women's
Basketball (2-0) will duke it out
on home floor today against
Pepperdine University.
The Cardinal's early victo
ries against solid teams like
Rutgers and Old Dominion
bodes well for the upcoming
game against the Waves, a team
that was dominated by the Car
dinal at Maples Pavilion the last
time the two teams met, in De
cember 2004 (85-49).
However, this year, Pepper
dine heads to the Farm with an
undefeated record (2-0). Miran
dam Ayim, who has averaged
15.5 points per game in two
games this season, leads the
Waves offensively.
Nnemkadi Ogwumike has
been the spark on offense this
season for the Card, averaging
23.0 points over the course of
last weekend's East Coast trip.
She has also been a factor on
the boards, reeling in 9.5 boards
per game. Preseason All-Amer
ican senior center Jayne Appel
continues to be a force in the
paint, averaging 15 points and
11.5 rebounds per game.
The Cardinal travels down
to Davis on Nov. 22 before be
ginning a five-game home stand
on Nov. 27.
Tipoff is tonight at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
