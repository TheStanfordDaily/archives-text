# Surviving November Madness
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
here's no reason I should have
been watching a college bas
ketball game between Cal
State Fullerton and UCLA on
a Monday in mid-November. Normal
ly, I get into this-is-why-the-NBA-is
better mode until the "elite teams,"
like said Bruins, complete the cupcake
start to their schedules against the
mid-conference, talent-deprived
teams, like said Titans. Nonetheless,
ESPN was just kicking off its 24-hour
marathon of overhyped, overwatched
games and the lure of listening to
Rece Davis for the duration of an en
tire planetary revolution was just too
much to resist.
As I sporadically paid attention to
the game, I began to realize that the
Bruins weren't pulling ahead, and in
fact, appeared to be struggling. Now
before you go stash Fullerton away as
your 2010 tournament sleeper, it's im
portant to know that the Titans played
as I expected: erratic, unorganized and
reckless. They played offense with an
Allen Iverson mentality and aimlessly
wandered on defense as if they were
mentored by Eddy Curry.
By game's end, the Bruins had, ex
pectedly, hoisted 19 more shot at
tempts (84 to 65), had seven fewer
turnovers (11 to 18), had eight more
assists (19 to 11) and more than twice
as many offensive rebounds (18 to 7).

In nearly every statistical category
that dictates the outcome of a game,
UCLA dominated.
The final score: Titans 68, Bruins 65
in a double-overtime thriller. Oh, this
is awkward.
College basketball is in a rebuild
ing year and there's nothing we can do
about it.
The one little stat I forgot to men
tion was field goal percentage. With
the departure of key players like Dar
ren Collison and Jrue Holiday, U CLA
was left to fend for itself on offense.
Naturally, the Bruins turned to peren
nial superstars Malcom Lee and Jer
ime Anderson (yeah, I had no idea
who they were either) for offensive
firepower and in return gained a com
bined shooting performance of 8 for
34, roughly 23.5% from the field.
And although I am picking on
UCLA, the Bruins are just a minor ex
ample of a team displaying the prob
lems that will plague all of college bas
ketball for the duration of the season.
Perhaps it's that this season, unlike
most of the campaigns in recent mem
ory, lacks any significant storylines or
superstars. In the 2003-04 season, I
passionately followed a St. Joe's team
that was making a run at perfection.
And although I never really bought
into the whole "Tyler Hansbrough is
America's Godchild" nonsense, I
most certainly tuned in to watch
Carmelo Anthony light it up, the epic
battles between Acie Law IV and
Kevin Durant and the 20-20 machine
that was Michael Beasley.
You could try and bring up Ken
tucky superfrosh point guard John
Wall who will all but certainly be
the No. 1 pick in next year's NBA
Draft but he is just an anomaly.
Nice, Wall hit a game-winning shot just
a few nights ago against Miami of
Ohio but he did just that, hit a
game-winning shot against Miami of
Ohio. Do you think Anthony, Durant
or Beasley would ever let their teams
win by less than 15 points against
Wally Szczerbiak's alma mater, let
alone have the game come down to a
last-second shot?
Even the so-called favorites to win
it all looked far from dominant in
their early games. Gonzaga, looking
(miraculously) more Caucasian and
awkward than usual, gave No. 2
Michigan State all it could handle in
East Lansing, despite the fantastic
play of Big Ten Player of the Year
Kalin Lucas. No. 1 Kansas, who boasts
two Preseason Ail-Americans in
guard Sherron Collins and center
Cole Aldrich, took on Memphis and
also had its hands full. Aldrich, who
looks like he is spoon fed 6000 calories
worth of corn per day, was Herculean
in the paint, yet the Jayhawks still
managed to allow the game to come
down to a potential game-winning
shot by newly-transferred Tigers'
guard Elliot Williams.
This isn't to say that I'm opposed
to an early-season upset it's just
that I'm not sold that either of these
examples would have actually been an
upset. There isn't a single team in the
nation that has looked particularly su
perior and although I completely un
derstand that making these types of
judgments this early in the season is
borderline insane, it's hard for me to
believe that we haven't already wit
nessed what could realistically be a
season-long trend.

But this may not be such a bad
thing for us after all. See, the best thing
for a rebuilding team is a universal re
building season. Stanford is one of
these teams and performances from
conference rivals like UCLA can, at
least momentarily, silence the talk that
the Cardinal's season was finished be
fore it started. If Cal State Fullerton
can beat the Bruins, Landry Fields and
Co. sure as hell can do the same.

A season-opening loss to San
Diego wasn't pretty, agreed, but I see
no reason to jump ship just yet. Will
this team contend for a national title?
No way. Could this highly doubted
group of guys shock the Pac-10 and
the nation with a win over Washing
ton or Cal? I truly believe so and this
is coming from a guy that had the low
est of expectations just days ago.
So before you choose to spend
your 35 dollars on weed instead of a
Sixth Man membership, just remem
ber that UCLA has as many losses as
Stanford and that the Cardinal is still
undefeated in conference play.
College basketball. Get some.
