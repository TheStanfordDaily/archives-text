# Surviving November Madness

### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
here's no reason I should have
been watching a college bas
ketball game between Cal
State Fullerton and UCLA on
a Monday in mid-November. Normal
ly, I get into this-is-why-the-NBA-is
better mode until the "elite teams,"
like said Bruins, complete the cupcake
start to their schedules against the
mid-conference, talent-deprived
teams, like said Titans. Nonetheless,
ESPN was just kicking off its 24-hour
marathon of overhyped, overwatched
games and the lure of listening to
Rece Davis for the duration of an en
tire planetary revolution was just too
much to resist.
As I sporadically paid attention to
the game, I began to realize that the
Bruins weren't pulling ahead, and in
fact, appeared to be struggling. Now
before you go stash Fullerton away as
your 2010 tournament sleeper, it's im
portant to know that the Titans played
as I expected: erratic, unorganized and
reckless. They played offense with an
Allen Iverson mentality and aimlessly
wandered on defense as if they were
mentored by Eddy Curry.
By game's end, the Bruins had, ex
pectedly, hoisted 19 more shot at
tempts (84 to 65), had seven fewer
turnovers (11 to 18), had eight more
assists (19 to 11) and more than twice
as many offensive rebounds (18 to 7).
