# A 						LAST-SECOND MAULING
## Stanford falls to Golden Eagles in final minute of close game 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Oral Roberts guard Roderick Pearson may have
had a mediocre game by the numbers with just nine
points and five turnovers, but he will surely remember
last night's game at Maples Pavilion for a long time to
come.
Pearson drove the length of the court with less than
five seconds on the clock to sink a running 18-footer as
time expired, handing the Golden Eagles (2-1) an 83-
81 victory over Stanford (1-2) in the preliminary round
of the Cancun Challenge. The basket was in direct re
sponse to a Landry Fields lay-up off an inbounds pass
that tied the game at 81.
"We'll give them credit first and foremost," said
Coach Johnny Dawkins after the game, "That's why
you don't put yourself in that position because any
thing can happen."
Once again, senior Fields carried the brunt of the
scoring on offense, using his size, strength and shoot
ing touch to put up a career-high 28 points in 39 min
utes of play. He also tallied six rebounds and five as
sists to go with zero turnovers.
"Landry is our leader," Dawkins said.'T thought he
played well. He pretty much did everything for us on
the floor."
Fields was not nearly as satisfied with either his
own performance or the performance of the team.
"I think we came out terrible," Fields said. "1 liked
our fight at the end of the first half, but toward the end
of the game we can't trade buckets. I've got to lock
down better. My man just tore me up."
The senior forward's opponent did indeed have a
field day Golden Eagles' forward Dominique
Morrison one-upped Fields' performance with 31
points and nine rebounds. Morrison made a crucial
three-point shot with Oral Roberts down five and just
two minutes remaining on the clock, although there
was a questionable no-call on the play after he ap
peared to push off to create room for the shot.
Despite not starting, recently reinstated sopho
more guard Jeremy Green had his best game of the
young season with 20 points and six rebounds on 6-of
-11 shooting.
Stanford fell behind early in the first half, trailing
17-4 after the game's opening moments. The team
rallied to tie the game at 35 before halftime, howev
er, and from there on out, it would be an even battle
with the Golden Eagles. The team saw 17 lead

changes and 16 ties between the two squads as the
game went on.
The Cardinal gained a chance to tie the game out
right when sophomore forward Jack Trotter went to
the free-throw line with 10 seconds remaining in the
game. He missed the first shot, however, before mak
ing the second to bring Stanford within one point.
After the Golden Eagles made two free throws to
stretch their lead out to three, sophomore point guard
Jarrett Mann stepped up to the line after Oral Roberts
fouled him 40 feet away from the basket to prevent a
three-point shot. Mann made the first shot and missed
the second to himself He immediately called time
out, setting up Fields' cut to the basket, which briefly
had the Maples Pavilion crowd thinking the game was
headed to overtime.
Despite the devastating loss, Coach Dawkins
seemed to keep his spirits up.
"I felt good about our effort, our energy," he said.
"Our guys really played some good basketball. They
hung in there, they dug deep and they showed what
they were made of. We had our chances down the
stretch and they had theirs."
He has good reason not to be disappointed with his
players' progress, as it is clear that this Cardinal team
is still in the rebuilding process and may remain there
for another year or two. Oral Roberts, while not strik
ing fear into the hearts of basketball fans with its
name,is still a solid mid-major program that has pulled
off upsets against major programs in the past.
That said, Maples Pavilion was anything but a par
adise for the Cardinal Wednesday night. Stanford
emerges 1-2 with games against Virginia and possibly
No. 4 Kentucky looming ahead in the Cancun Chal
lenge.

game went on.
The Cardinal gained a chance to tie the game out
right when sophomore forward Jack Trotter went to
the free-throw line with 10 seconds remaining in the
game. He missed the first shot, however, before mak
ing the second to bring Stanford within one point.
After the Golden Eagles made two free throws to
stretch their lead out to three, sophomore point guard
Jarrett Mann stepped up to the line after Oral Roberts
fouled him 40 feet away from the basket to prevent a
three-point shot. Mann made the first shot and missed
the second to himself He immediately called time
out, setting up Fields' cut to the basket, which briefly
had the Maples Pavilion crowd thinking the game was
headed to overtime.
Despite the devastating loss, Coach Dawkins
seemed to keep his spirits up.
"I felt good about our effort, our energy," he said.
"Our guys really played some good basketball. They
hung in there, they dug deep and they showed what
they were made of. We had our chances down the
stretch and they had theirs."
He has good reason not to be disappointed with his
players' progress, as it is clear that this Cardinal team
is still in the rebuilding process and may remain there
for another year or two. Oral Roberts, while not strik
ing fear into the hearts of basketball fans with its
name,is still a solid mid-major program that has pulled
off upsets against major programs in the past.
That said, Maples Pavilion was anything but a par
adise for the Cardinal Wednesday night. Stanford
emerges 1-2 with games against Virginia and possibly
No. 4 Kentucky looming ahead in the Cancun Chal
lenge.

Johnny Dawkins announced the signing of five play
