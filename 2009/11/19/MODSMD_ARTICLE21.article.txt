# MEN'S SOCCER
## Taking on the Tournament 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal is going back to the NCAA
tournament. The Stanford men's soccer team
will make its first appearance in the NCAA's
since 2002 when it hosts Saint Mary's College
tonight.
Stanford (10-5-2, 4-4-2 Pac-10) is back
after a strong turn-around from last year
the team managed only four wins in 2008. Fol
lowing several key changes, including moving
star forward junior Bobby Warshaw to de
fense, the team has managed to regain its
standing as a nationally competitive program.
"We knew we had the talent and thought
we should be here the whole time," Warshaw
said. "We knew we had the skill, but we've also
put in a lot of work and effort to get here and
overcome a lot of obstacles. It feels really grat
ifying."
All this success came under the strong
hand of coach Bret Simon, who was recently
named the 2009 Pac-10 Coach of the Year, the
second time he has earned such an honor.
Simon's first Pac-10 Coach of the Year award
came in 2002, also the last time Stanford com
peted in the NCAA's. Simon's overall record
at Stanford now stands at 78-68-28.
Saint Mary's, Stanford's first opponent in
the tournament, also has reason to be excited
about its invitation to the NCAA's, as this is
the first year the team has ever been selected
to appear in the tournament. The Gaels fin
ished second in the West Coast Conference

this year, racking up the best season in Saint
Mary's history with a regular season record of
10-4-5,6-3-3 WCC.
"WCC teams are extremely physical," said
Stanford senior keeper John Moore. "They're
a big team and that's something that we have
a few strategies to work through. It's nothing
we haven't dealt with before."
For the Cardinal, Warshaw leads the team
with 13 points and 6 goals. Senior attacker
Evan Morgan is second in points (12), with 4
goals and 4 assists. Overall, 10 players have
scored for the Cardinal this season. Defending
the goal is Moore, who played every minute
for Stanford and averaged 0.90 goals allowed
against and made 61 saves.
"We've had a lot of different people find
the back of the net this year," Moore said. "I
think the way our offense works is very dy
namic and fluid. At any time, we can have an
outside back or a defensive central midfielder
score. It's really up to the situation and it's one
of those things we focus on, having a balanced
attack."
Freshman Trevor Newquist leads the Saint
Mary's squad with four goals and he also pro
vides a strong offensive threat from his posi
tion as defender. Redshirt junior Dylan Leslie
leads the team in overall points, with 3 goals
and 9 assists. In goal, sophomore keeper Doug
Herrick has averaged 0.93 goals against and
has made 63 saves while also playing every
minute of the season.
"We know Saint Mary's is extremely good
on set pieces," Moore said. "They've scored

the majority of their goals on those kind of
plays this season and that's something that
we've practiced for and something we have
strategies to defend against."
Key games for Saint Mary's this season
have come in a victory over then-No. 16 UC-
Irvine (2-1) and two ties with then-No. 18 Port
land (1-1) and then-No. 14 San Diego (0-0).
The Gaels are one of four WCC teams select
ed to compete in the NCAA's.
Stanford's bracket looks favorable up to a
point. If the Card can advance past Saint
Mary's, it will then face No. 16 seed UC-
Irvine. Stanford came very close to playing
from this seeded position itself and the two
teams seem evenly matched. A win over
Irvine would put the Cardinal in contention
with No. 1 seeded Akron, who will prove a
