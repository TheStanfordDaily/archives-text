## BEYOND THE SCOREBOARD 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the Cardinal faithful will
remember last weekend's
win at USC for the mind
blowing margin of victory
and the record-breaking number of points
Stanford put on the board, they would be
remiss to forget how differently the game
could have gone if a particular play didn't
happen the way it did.
Facing a crowd 0f90,000 during Home
coming Weekend, the Stanford offense
looked shaky and unsure of itself on its
first drive of the game, going three-and-out
after three incomplete passes by redshirt
freshman Andrew Luck.TheTroj an crowd
was on its feet and the USC players
seemed to have the same goal on their
minds: striking first blood.
Trojan quarterback Matt Barkley
drove his team down the field and after

just four plays USC was already inside the
Stanford 20, poised to jump out to a 7-0
lead. But then the Trojan offensive line
made a mistake it would pay for dearly for
the rest of the game.
"For some strange reason they decided
not to block me," said senior linebacker
Will Powers.
Powers headed straight for Barkley on
a blitz a play which apparently hadn't
worked much all season until Saturday's
game and stripped the ball from the
Trojans' freshman quarterback. Twelve
yards later, fellow linebacker Clinton Sny
der had recovered the ball, giving Stanford
all the momentum it would need for the
rest of the game. It is easy to simply give the
game ball to the offense, in particular the
backfield duo of Toby Gerhart and An
drew Luck. But without that opening
turnover and later turnovers throughout
the game forced by the defense, Saturday's
55-21 blowout may have been a whole dif
ferent story.

"It was huge," said defensive tackle
Matt Masifilo, who also forced a crucial
turnover of his own, of Powers' play.
"Will's a phenomenal athlete ... It defi
nitely set the tone for the rest of the game,"
"I saw the opportunity and just took it,"
Powers said.
Taking advantage of the opportunities
he's had on the Farm has been the trade
mark of Powers' career with the Cardinal.
Whether suiting up for the historically bad
Walt Harris team in 2006, or presently
starting at the strong side linebacker posi
tion for the best Stanford team in years,
Powers has simply done what he could for
the team.
"I've changed positions to fulfill a need
the team had. I'm happy with a victory,
bottom line," he said. "To do whatever it
takes to achieve that has always been my
M.0."
Most of the assignments Powers has
