# CROSS COUNTRY
## Striving toward NCAAs 
### JULIA BROWNELL ANARGHYA VARDHANA 
The men's and women's cross country teams will
head to Terre Haute, Ind. on Monday for the NCAA na
tional championships.
For the No. 1 men, the meet is a culmination of their
season-long winning streak. Last year, the team finished
third in the nation, but this year the goal has always been
to take the title.
"Last year the goal was to at least get back on the
podium," said junior Elliott Heath. "This year since the
start of the season it's been nothing but getting the
NCAA title."
The team's competitors will consist of the scorers
from this year, including Chris Derrick, Heath, Justin
Maripole-Bird, Brendan Gregg, Miles Unterreiner and
Jacob Riley, who comes off of an injury from last week.
These men have won all their meets this season, includ
ing the Stanford Invitational, the Pac-10 championships
and NCAA West Regionals last weekend. The team
doesn't think there is any reason to doubt these runners'
ability to perform.
"I feel supremely confident that our team's going to
run the way we've been running," said sophomore Chris
Derrick. "I'm not worried about us beating ourselves."
Last weekend at Regionals, the team ran in muddy
conditions for its first 10K of the season and finished in
top form. The men swept the first three spots and fin
ished with an astonishingly low 27 points. The meet
showed their confidence running the longer race and
their ability to run in any conditions.
Going into Terre Haute, the team will face the best
competitors from around the nation, including No. 2 Ok
lahoma State. However, Stanford has a deep line-up of
the fastest runners in the country and looks to be the one
to beat.
The team doesn't appear to be too nervous about the
upcoming meet, but they are definitely anxious to put it
all on the line in their attempt to claim the title.
"We're starting to get pretty excited and not too nerv
ous," Heath said. "I'm going to start having trouble focus
ing in class soon though."
Derrick has led the team all season, winning every
meet that the Cardinal has competed in thus far. At na
tionals, Derrick is one of the favorites to win the race
overall, like he did at pre-nationals in October.
He also won the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Coun
try Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) Western Ath
lete of the Year award, while Coach Jason Dunn earned
the title of Western Coach of the Year.
However, the focus of the team rests wholeheartedly
on reclaiming the title for the Cardinal for the first time
since 2003.
"We've got to lay it all on the line," Derrick said.
"Right now we're really confident. It feels really good
where we're at."
After a third place finish at the NCAA West Region
als, the women received an At-Large bid to compete in
the NCAA National Cross Country Championships.The
No. 1 and 2 teams were Oregon and Washington, who re-
ceived automatic qualification to na
tionals.

The Stanford women will once
again face these western region pow
erhouses, as well as additional top
teams and individuals in the nation.
The meet features 31 teams, as well as
several individual qualifiers. The Car
dinal's top runners competing at the
national level include sophomore
Stephanie Marcy currently
ranked first on the team freshman
Alex Dunne, senior Kate Niehaus,
freshman Kathy Kroeger, sopho
more Georgia Griffin, senior
Madeleine O'Meara and potentially,
sophomore Alex Gits.
"Personally, I am going to focus on
getting solid rest between now and
nationals in order to ensure I am

completely rested and recovered for
the race," Dunne said. "I hope to be a
top scorer for our team and earn All-
American honors."
Dunne finished in 15th at West
Regionals with a time of 21:21.08 and
looks to improve that this weekend.
Her goal for the team is to podium,
and to, as she put it, "kick the quack
out of Oregon."
Niehaus, who had to sit out for
most of this season due to injury, is ex
cited to be back for nationals. She ran
well at West Regionals, finishing 17th
and scoring for the team.
"We are definitely hungry to im
prove for Nationals," Niehaus said. "I
think that West Regionals has given
us an added boost of confidence and
I'd say that we are very positive about
what we are capable of achieving as a
group."
