## Good time for a Stanford fan 
### 
It doesn't get much better than this
as a Stanford sports fan. Rivalry
games, playoffs, new seasons start
ing up it's a busy time of the
year on The Farm. Here are the top ten
Stanford sports events I am looking
forward to over the final month of the
quarter.
10. Men's soccer back in the
N CAA Tournament
After a bit of a letdown season last
year, the men's soccer program is
back. The Cardinal, which has been
bouncing in and out of the rankings all
season long, earned an at-large bid
into the NCAA tournament. Its first
game will be tomorrow at 7 p.m.
against St. Mary's at Laird Q. Cagan
Stadium.
9. Water polo going for revenge
against Cal
Before Toby Gerhart and co. take on
the Golden Bears this Saturday after
noon, the No. 3 Stanford men's water
polo team will rematch No. 2 Cal earli
er in the day. The Cardinal lost to
Berkeley 10-8 in early October, suffer
ing its first loss of the season. Besides
playing for pride, the game will have
serious national title implications. If
Stanford defeats Cal, it all but ensures
itself a spot in the NCAA Tournament.
If the Cardinal loses, it will most likely
have to win the MPSF Tournament.
Game time is set for 2 p.m.
8. Women's volleyball making an
other run at a national championship
Last season, women's volleyball came
within one win of its seventh national
championship, losing to Penn State in
the title game.This year, the No. 6 Car
dinal looks to atone for the missed op
portunity. Stanford has three more
regular season games to play before
the NCAA Championships. Barring
an upset, the Cardinal will be playing
at home in the NCAA Regionals on
Dec. 11 and 12.
7. Men's basketball season start
ing up

Say what you want about the talent
of this year's men's basketball team,
but Maples Pavilion is still one of the
premiere venues in college to watch
a game. Even though expectations

aren't high for this year's squad (to
put it mildly), Johnny Dawkins went
Urban Meyer on his schedule and
put some very winnable games in the
beginning. The Cardinal could boast
an All-Pac-10 player in senior
Landry Fields and sophomores Jere
my Green and Jarrett Mann could
provide a glimmer of hope for Stan
ford hoops fans.
6. IM Flag Football Playoffs
Theta Delt has the dynasty. Sigma Chi
has the rugby attitude. SAE has the of
fensive firepower. The Business
School has the experience. Who's
going to take home the most coveted
intramural championship? My predic
tion: it will all be decided by a horren
dous call by an overpaid, under-trained
referee.

5. Women's soccer keeping perfect
record intact
Women's soccer is on the brink of an
unforgettable season. The only thing
left to do is not to lose, which hasn't
been a problem all season for the un
defeated Cardinal. Stanford will face
Santa Clara in the third round of the
NCAA Tournament this Friday at 7
p.m. at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
4. Women's basketball gearing up
for a national title run

Stanford put up 107 points in each of
first two games. The combined score of
its opponents? 104. This could be the
year Stanford finally reclaims the na
tional championship. Led by All-
Everything Jayne Appel, there is no
team in the country the Cardinal can't
beat.

3. Stanford football vs. Notre Dame
I can only think of a few things that
would make me happier than seeing
defensive ends Chase Thomas and
Thomas Keiser routinely sack, hit,
shove, or tackle Notre Dame QB
Jimmy Claussen. A victory over the
Fighting Irish is a close second.
2. A Big Game victory
If I need to explain this, I'm praying
I'm not going to be sitting next to you
in the student section.

1. A (Rose) Bowl victory
I wouldn't be ecstatic to make the trip
to El Paso, Texas if Stanford ends up in
the Sun Bowl, but any bowl game vic
tory would be the highlight of the year.
For the seniors who endured the 1-11
2006 season, the thought of Stanford
winning a bowl game is unfathomable.
A Rose Bowl victory may cause them
to go into shock.

Mike Lazarus is planning a separate tail
gate for each event. Let him know if you're
interested at mlazarus@stanford. edu.
