# Full financial aid picture released
## Majority of freshman class receives need-based aid 
### JANE LEPHAM STAFF WRITER 
When the University announced earlier this year that the
endowment had fallen 27 percent for the fiscal year ending Aug.
31, administrators vowed to uphold student financial aid policies
despite the fact that the endowment payout supporting finan
cial aid was decreasing while a greater number of students were
applying for financial aid.
At the peak of the economic downturn last year, administrators
worried about the toll that the economy would take on families
paying for tuition, anticipating an increase in the number of finan
cial aid applications. According to new data released by the Office
of Development, the amount of financial aid applications for the
incoming freshman Class of 2013 increased by 25 percent over the
previous class, while an "unusually high number" of upperclass

men also qualified for scholarship support.
The official release also indicates that nearly 80 percent of the
Stanford undergraduate population is on some form of financial
aid, a five-percent increase from the previous year. Of this number,
48 percent of undergraduates receive need-based aid directly from
the University, up from 41 percent in recent years.
According to Karen Cooper, director of financial aid, the
University has been able to keep a strong commitment to its finan
cial aid program.
"We are actually giving out significantly more aid this year than
last year, despite the reduction to the endowment funding avail
able," Cooper wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"We have stood by that commitment by using other institution
al sources of funding such as The Stanford Fund (annual gift
funds) more heavily than we would have if the endowment funds
were available," she added.
Aside from the scholarship endowment, the University relies
on three other sources to provide aid to students: The Stanford
Fund, University general funds and reserves, and expendable gift
funds.
While the University's financial aid budget has swelled 50 per
cent since the 2007-08 academic year the amount of total aid
given increased from $75.2 million to $112.5 million scholarship
endowment now only meets 63 percent of Stanford's current
financial aid budget, a decrease from 90 percent two years ago.
After tapping into outside grants available to students from
state, federal and private agencies, the shortfall between scholar
ship endowment funding and student need is projected to be more
than $4O million for the 2009-10 academic year, according to the
Office of Development. This year, the University expects to allo
cate 75 percent of The Stanford Fund $l5 million toward
financial aid. It will also dip into its general funds and reserves
an increase from $3 million last year to $24.7 million this year
to meet the remainder of student need.
Cooper expects the amount of students applying for aid, and
the number who will receive need-based aid directly from the
University, to increase in the current economic environment.

"Currently, 51 percent of the freshman class is receiving need
based aid from the University," she added. "This percentage has
been growing steadily for several years."
While families are still feeling the shocks of the economic
downturn, financial aid packages will not likely reflect students'
current financial situation until the next academic year, as aid is
determined by W-2 forms that report parental income from more
than one year ago.
While some students have seen no changes in their financial aid
packages, they remain appreciative of the University's efforts to
accommodate families' increasing financial pressures.
"I receive a tiny bit of aid from the University, and although the
University has not expanded my aid options this year, I understand
that the University is going through the same economic crisis that

my family is experiencing," said Brady
Hamed 'l2. "I think every family would
appreciate some sort of help, though."
"Obviously, [the financial aid] was a signif
icant part of my decision to come here,"
added Alex Churchill 'l2. "The cost of a place
like Stanford is high for middle-class families,
but I think they've made significant strides in
trying to make it easier for people to come
here."
Hamed added that he felt the University
should use its resources to maintain a strong
focus on its aid efforts in upcoming years.
"Despite the endowment drop, we still
have the third-largest endowment in the
nation, so it's not like there's an absence of
money," Hamed added. "I think the
University should still have room to give aid
to students that need it, and I think, especially
in this economic environment, the University
should make financial aid to students one of
its top priorities."
According to data published by Common
Data Set Initiative for the 2009-10 academic
year, of Stanford's 6,185 undergrads, 3,761
applied for aid, 3,291 were determined to have
financial need, 3,268 received any financial aid
and 3,207 were awarded aid in terms of schol
arships and grants. The average financial aid
package, according to this release, is $38,419.
