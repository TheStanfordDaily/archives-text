## Judicial office adopts fall pilot program New Early Resolution Option offered for students 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
To speed up a lengthy and often stress
ful process, the Office of Judicial Affairs is
now offering a new Early Resolution
Option (ERO) to students going through
the University's judicial system.
A normal hearing process takes 14 to
16 weeks on average, even when the stu
dent is willing to take responsibility for his
or her actions. In a survey of the students
who went through the system last year,
the Office of Judicial Affairs found that a
great majority thought their cases took
longer than necessary to resolve.
The ERO option will speed up that
process if a student does not contest the
allegations and is a first-time offender. In
that case, the student must be wilting
bypass the hearing and accept the given
sanction.
"I think the benefit of the ERO is that
it allows students to accept responsibility
and resolve outstanding issues, by offering
a process that can be more expeditious,"
said Assistant Dean of Student Life and
Judicial Advisor Jamie Pontius-Hogan.
A number of other universities
already have such a process in place,
including Northwestern, Duke, Princeton,
Yale and Harvard.
According to a press release from the
Office of Judicial Affairs, the change will
not alter the kind of sanctions offered to
students. The panels that decide sanctions
follow precedent and some basic guide
lines like 40 hours of community service
for a first-time honor code violation.
ERO candidates will be offered the same
protocol regarding sanctions.
The process does, however, skip the
lengthy hearing process, which can often
become more conflict-intensive and
painful.
"The literature within the field of
Judicial Affairs indicates that the longer
student conduct processes take, the more
the focus turns adversarial, instead of
maintaining an educational focus,"
Pontius-Hogan said.
