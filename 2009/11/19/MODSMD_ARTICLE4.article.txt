## Judicial office adopts fall pilot program New Early Resolution Option offered for students 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
To speed up a lengthy and often stress
ful process, the Office of Judicial Affairs is
now offering a new Early Resolution
Option (ERO) to students going through
the University's judicial system.
A normal hearing process takes 14 to
16 weeks on average, even when the stu
dent is willing to take responsibility for his
or her actions. In a survey of the students
who went through the system last year,
the Office of Judicial Affairs found that a
great majority thought their cases took
longer than necessary to resolve.
The ERO option will speed up that
process if a student does not contest the
allegations and is a first-time offender. In
that case, the student must be wilting
bypass the hearing and accept the given
sanction.
"I think the benefit of the ERO is that
it allows students to accept responsibility
and resolve outstanding issues, by offering
a process that can be more expeditious,"
said Assistant Dean of Student Life and
Judicial Advisor Jamie Pontius-Hogan.
A number of other universities
already have such a process in place,
including Northwestern, Duke, Princeton,
Yale and Harvard.
According to a press release from the
Office of Judicial Affairs, the change will
not alter the kind of sanctions offered to
students. The panels that decide sanctions
follow precedent and some basic guide
lines like 40 hours of community service
for a first-time honor code violation.
ERO candidates will be offered the same
protocol regarding sanctions.
The process does, however, skip the
lengthy hearing process, which can often
become more conflict-intensive and
painful.
"The literature within the field of
Judicial Affairs indicates that the longer
student conduct processes take, the more
the focus turns adversarial, instead of
maintaining an educational focus,"
Pontius-Hogan said.
The normal process includes a
number of steps beginning with a filed
complaint. A judicial officer then
investigates the complaint, while a
judicial adviser works with the student
and advises him or her of his or her
rights. The complaint is sometimes dis
missed or referred elsewhere, but if
facts are sufficient and it is a relevant

issue, charges will be filed.
Following the filing of charges, a
judicial panel hearing is held, which
can either find that no violation
occurred, dismiss the case or find that
a violation occurred and impose sanc
tions. Sanctions are reviewed, and the
student is then notified.
In light of former ASSU Vice
President Jay de la Torre's resignation
due to an honor code violation a full
year ago, the length of the process is
currently in the spotlight, though the
program was announced prior to his
resignation and has no relation. Not

many students ever go through the
process, and most proceedings are
kept rather quiet, making the system
not well known across campus.
At the University level, judicial
affairs will review each case that qual
ifies for ERO. There will be time built
into the process for a student to reflect
and make the decision of whether he
or she wants to pursue ERO or go
through the hearing process.

If a student does want to contest
their allegation, he or she still has
access to the hearing process already
in place.

Some students are in favor of the
new idea because of its efficiency. "I
think it's a good idea," said Eric Tran
'l3. "I think it's faster, and it provides
the students an opportunity to own up
to their own mistakes."
The ERO program is currently in
its pilot phase. Judicial Affairs will be
assessing the process throughout the
year and, in the spring, will assess the
program's progress going into the next
academic year.
