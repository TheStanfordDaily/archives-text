## GSC approves Parker as V.P. nominee 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) approved Andy Parker 'll for
ASSU vice president and Farah
Abuzeid 'lO for co-joint chief of staff at
its Wednesday night meeting, potential
ly reshuffling the cabinet in an unprece
dented situation not addressed in the
ASSU Constitution.
The two nominees await approval
from the Undergraduate Senate in the
first week of December in order to
secure their positions.
Parker was approved to replace for
mer Vice President Jay de la Torre 'lO,
who resigned last week. Abuzeid was
approved to fill Parker's co-joint chief
of staff position, which he would vacate.
The GSC additionally discussed the
concerns of doctoral students about the
indexing of electronically submitted
dissertations by Google.

Cabinet Replacements Approved
De la Torre's resignation leaves two
holes in the ASSU cabinet: the office of
the vice presidency and the office of his
replacement. ASSU President David
Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO explained to the
Council his decision process in choos
ing Parker as de la Torre's replacement.
According to Gobaud, the two cur

rent executive co-joint chiefs of staff,
Andy Parker and Bennett Hauser 'lO,
are experienced enough with ASSU
teams, projects, procedure and legisla
tive issues, as well as other campus
organizations, to quickly assume the
vice presidency.
"While Andy and Bennett are
equally qualified, Andy is able to dedi
cate the required amount of time to the
position," Gobaud told The Daily.
"Andy is a junior and simply has more
time to finish his academics, and there
fore has more time to commit to the
ASSU [than Bennett]."
Gobaud explained that by some past
oversight, the ASSU Constitution has
no provisions for this unprecedented
situation. He perceived no problem in
the Undergraduate Senate with his
appointing a new V.P., but said senators
had questions about how Parker was
chosen and how to respond to the
Constitution's lack of explicit proce
dure, The GSC unanimously approved
Parker's confirmation as ASSU vice
president.
Abuzeid, the nominee to replace
Parker as a new co-joint chief of staff,
was also present at the GSC meeting.
Gobaud addressed questions about
Abuzeid's lack of ASSU experience,
saying it's unnecessary for the position

of joint chief of staff, who is primarily a
team leader and project manager. He
also said it didn't make sense to hire
internally because it would remove cab
inet members from their team leader
positions and be disruptive.
Abuzeid's appointment was unani
mously approved.
The GSC also confirmed William
Slikker, a fourth-year medical student,
as the chair of graduate health and well
ness.
Two other positions the chair of
graduate life, academics, cost of living
and equality, and a co-chair of market
ing and human computer interaction
remain unfilled.
Electronic Dissertation Process
Concerns
When the GSC moved on to new
business, Aleksandra Korolova, a Ph.D.
candidate in computer science, intro
duced concerns with the electronic dis
sertation process.
After submission, all electronic dis
sertations are given to Google to index
automatically, and students have no
power to indefinitely postpone the
indexing. Doctoral students currently
have the option to turn in hard copies
of their dissertations, to which Google index
ing doesn't apply, but many think that eventu
ally, the submission process will be entirely
electronic.

No particularly strong opinions on the sub
ject emerged during the meeting most
council members seemed to agree that the
rights of Google to publish Stanford students'
dissertations should be further discussed and
followed in its development.
"We would love to see the ability to opt
out. It's a choice you should be able to make,"
said Eric Osborne M.S. 'lO, GSC co-chair.
The GSC then addressed the more regular
aspects of their agenda.
They unanimously approved the allotment
of $1,500 to fund three dim-sum lunch study
breaks, one during each Dead Week, hosted
by the Asian American Graduate Student
Association. They also unanimously approved
$7OO to fund the Islamic Society of Stanford
University and their weekly TGIJ (Thank
Goodness It's Jum'ah) intellectual and theo
logical discussions.
On Friday, a committee will interview
applicants for the position of assistant com
missioner for graduate elections.
April 8 and 9 were unanimously approved
as the dates for the 2010 ASSU Spring
Quarter General Elections, the same week as
in past years.
The 12th Annual GSC Thanksgiving
Dinner, for which 929 adults and 67 students
are currently registered, will take place next
Thursday at the Graduate Community
Center.
This year's Hacienda Party will take place
on Dec. 4. The GSC approved $5OO from dis
cretionary programming funds for food and
drink.
Anticipating a 10.9 percent take back rate
of money given to volunteer student organiza
tions (VSOs), the GSC approved adding an

additional $lB,OOO to the VSO fund for next
year.
The last GSC meeting of fall quarter will
be Wednesday, Dec. 2. GSC meetings will
resume winter quarter on Jan. 6.
