### ANNIE PROSSNITZ 
In an e-mail sent last
Thursday to both this year's and
last year's resident assistants
(RAs), Associate Director of
Residential Education Josh
Schiller announced that he will
be leaving Stanford at the end of
fall quarter. The departure is
final after the denial of Schiller's
bid to obtain the new associate
dean position, which will be
replacing his position as associ
ate director of Residential
Education.
In that capacity, Schiller was
responsible for selecting and train
ing RAs as well as dealing with the
RA program responsibilities dur
ing the year. Additionally, Schiller
worked as a non-live-in resident fel
low at Suites, and organized the
Crossing the Line program through
the Multicultural Educators
Training Organization.
Schiller, who graduated as a
sociology coterm in 1998, has
been on the campus for 16 years.
The elimination of the associ
ate director position is part of
the administration's efforts to
rework the Residential
Education program.
"I had to take the current
positions and rework them, and
that resulted very unfortunately
in layoffs," said Dean of
Residential Education Deborah
Golder, in reference to the alter
ations in the Residential
Education department.
"There is change that is also
about loss, and there is loss in
this," she added.
According to Golder, three
associate deans will replace the
three associate director posi
tions in winter quarter. Their
new offices will be located in the
Taper Center and the Elliot
Program Center.

While the associate deans
will retain Schiller's duties of
RA selection and training,
Golder argued that the associate
dean positions will benefit the
Residential Education Program.
"We can be more effective in
our advocacy, whereas now
we're set up in away that only
allows us to see one piece of the
puzzle," Golder said, saying the
move will integrate the depart
ment and discourage "fief
doms."
Students will have the oppor
tunity to input their opinions
during the interview process of
the new associate deans. The
night before the job interview,
the associate dean applicants
will meet with a group of stu
dent staff for dinner.
"We're trying to have diverse
perspectives there to help evalu
ate the quality of our candi
dates. They [the students] are a
critical piece of the process,"
Golder said.
While Golder explained that
no other positions would be
affected at this point in time, she
maintained that this is only step
one in the reorganization
process.
"The desire is to start at this
kind of senior level and then
start another round of dia
logue," Golder said. "I want to
make our organization more
accessible to students and more
accessible to ourselves."
As for Schiller, he plans to
spend his time post-Stanford
writing, skiing, playing music
and relaxing.
"I've been on campus for 16
years," Schiller said. "I think I'm
going to do some traveling."
However, Schiller did not
dismiss the idea of ever return
ing to Stanford in the future,
"I'm an alum. I love this
place." Schiller said. "I'm going
to miss being here, but I could
see coming back."
