## CATCH A FALLING STAR 
### ERIKAKOSKI 
Throughout time, shooting stars have
sparked the imagination and cap
tured the fancy of humans. Stanford
was no exception as this year's
Leonid Meteor Shower flashed
across Earth's skies this week, peaking early
Tuesday morning.
Students gathered at Lake Lagunita, the
Observatory, Roble Field, the Oval any
where that escaped the scrutiny of dorm and
dining hall lights to gaze up at the stars
sprinkled across the dark sky, huddling for
warmth and straining their vision in the hopes
that one of the tiny sequins would suddenly
plummet. The event was broadcasted on
Facebook and had a fair turnout of stargazers.
Debates circled over the best methods to
catch a glimpse of these faint star trails was
it better to stare patiently at one constant area
or to scan your eyes across the sky for a more
panoramic view? Were they seen better
through the periphery or straight-ahead?
Excitement would ignite as something bright
moved in the fathomless velvet expanse of
space above, and then would be doused in dis
appointment with the flashing red realization
that it was a plane.
The heavens decided to grace Stanford
with a few particularly spectacular shooting
stars at about 2 a.m. Gasps and whoops
resounded around Lake Lagunita as a blazing
white-green serpent shot across the sky in a
burst of energy.
"It was a memorable experience and a
great moment of social bonding for me and
my friends," said Leah Thomas 'l3. Thomas
was huddled with a group of other freshmen
in a mass bundle of blankets and jackets to
ward off the chilly night air.
Most of the meteors were merely faint
chicken tracks of light tattooed lightly across
the sky and barely visible. It was difficult to

distinguish whether these slight gossamers
trailing down from previously stationary stars
were present in reality or simply the imagina
tion.

Meteor showers are not in fact stars that
choose to race across the sky for the benefit of
Earthlings, but actually the entrails of a prior
comet that lie in Earth's path, the excesses
shaved off when the huge ball of fire whizzes
through space. The frequency of meteor sight
ings depends on the congestion of the rock
clumps through which we orbit. Rock clumps
are dispensed because as a comet nears the
sun, the comet's melting ice releases dust, and
these dust particles burn in the atmosphere.
So, the "great balls of fire" we see racing across
the sky are often no more than tiny grains of
debris.

The Leonids, so-called because they appear
to fan out from the Leo constellation, follow in
the wake of their mother comet Tempel-

Tuttle. Tempel-Tuttle approaches the sun
every 33 years. More recently, laid meteor
tracks result in a torrent of "shooting stars"
from the perspective of Earth in 1833, the
planet passed through a particularly fresh trail
and spectators had the privilege of viewing
meteors flash down at a rate of 30 meteors a
second. The average meteor shower, however,
mellows down at about 15 meteors an hour.

The meteor shower was reported to be vis
ible, if not as clear, late Tuesday night. The
overcast sky obscured most of the potential
for any sightings, however. The few exception
al light displays on Monday night made up for
the lack the following night.
"It was freezing, and most of the meteors
were hard to see," said Roger Yang 'l3, anoth
er freshman in Thomas' group. "But the big
one was worth it!"

STARRY NIGHT: Students bundled up and looked to the skies late Monday night to
witness the Leonid Meteor shower on the dry lakebed at Lake Lag.
