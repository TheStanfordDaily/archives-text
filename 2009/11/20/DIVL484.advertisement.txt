Dear Members and Friends of the Berkeley and Stanford Communities:
On November 21, 2009, Cal and Stanford will square off in the 112 th annual Big Game at
Memorial Stadium, an event that has been a Bay Area tradition. Our two universities share a
strong football and academic heritage, as well as a spirited and storied rivalry.
It is important that the traditional goal of the Big Game be reinforced this year: a spirited
competition on the field and an enjoyable experience for those in the stands.
Unfortunately, in the past years, the spirit of the Big Game has been dampened by the
irresponsible behavior of some that resulted in fracas and property damage.
We again ask this year that you refrain from engaging in "pranks" and other activities that
may draw law enforcement and security personnel and resources away from responding to more
pressing matters.
We feel that those attending the Big Game should not have to fear for their safety; therefore,
we must emphasize that fans who engage in incidents of field trespass, physical assault and/or
property damage will be ejected from the stadium. Students found responsible for these types of
activities will face disciplinary action at their respective institutions; such action may include
suspension or dismissal.
Please respect more than a century of Big Game tradition and celebrate your school spirit,
pride, and sportsmanship in a safe, positive and friendly manner. Enjoy the game!
Yours sincerely,
Robert J. Birgeneau
Chancellor
University of California, Berkeley
John L. Hennessy
President
Stanford University
