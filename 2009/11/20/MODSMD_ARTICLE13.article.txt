## THE 						DAY THE MUSIC DIED The 						man. The trombone. The legend. 
### ANNEKE NELSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Many know the tale of the trampled
trombone player from The Play of
'B2. Few know the man behind the
fall: Gary Tyrrell 'B3.
I first met Tyrrell, a college friend of my uncle's,
at Risotti's (Zot's) in Portola Valley last spring. At
first glance, Tyrrell was just a regular Silicon Valley
CFO. As the night progressed and the three of us
went from Zot's to a Grateful Dead concert, I dis
covered that he was anything but.
But first, The Play.
On Nov. 20, 1982, the Stanford Band rushed
the field after thinking that Stanford had won the
game. Five lateral passes and much confusion
later, Cal football player Kevin Moen knocked
over trombonist Tyrrell, an industrial engineering
major (now management science and engineer
ing), en route to the end zone.
Since that fateful play in 'B2, Tyrrell has been
the subject of "close to 200" interviews.
He and Moen make joint appearances at func
tions "if not every year, just about every other
year," Tyrrell said. "He's a very gracious man and
he's a Big Game hero any way you look at it.
Tyrrell suffered few minor bodily injuries, hav
ing seen Moen approach him before they collided.
He was also wearing a hard hat and focused his
energy on curling around his trombone.
"The trombone was okay too," he said. "You
naturally learned to protect that."
His trombone is currently on display in the
"Great Rivalries" section in the College Football
Hall of Fame in South Bend, Ind.
"Cal tried to buy the instrument," Tyrrell said.
"They offered me maybe $lOO-150 for it and my
counter-offer was that I'd trade it even up for the
Stanford Axe."
Cal did not accept his counter-offer.
The year after Stanford's defeat, Tyrrell had
the opportunity to join the Band again for a reen
actment of The Play. This time, he came out victo
rious.
Band members wheeled him out in a wheel
chair during halftime. However, instead of Cal
winning, Tyrrell leapt from his wheelchair,
attacked the "Cal player" with his trombone and
scored the winning touchdown.
"It was the most fun I've had on a football
field," he said.
He joined the Stanford Band during the spring

quarter of his freshman year, toting the same horn
he played when he first picked up the instrument
in fifth grade.
"I haven't played the trombone in a few years,"
Tyrrell said, although he joined the Band at the
Rose Bowl in 2000.
"That was great, great fun," he added.
At his Admit Weekend, Tyrrell received his
first exposure to the Band during an all-campus
rally.
"They didn't know I was watching them," he
said. "I was just enamored of their spirit and
thought it would be so much fun to play rock and
roll with these folks."
This year's Big Game will be the 31st consecu
tive Big Game that he has attended.
"It is such a treat to watch this team," Tyrrell
said. "Win or lose, they're entertaining. I am a
fired-up fan!"
What many don't know about this fired-up fan
is his devotion to music, particularly the Grateful
Dead. Gary has attended "approximately 112"
Grateful Dead concerts. Although he has lost
count of the exact number, "it is definitely some
where in the hundred and teens."
Based on the multitude of previous Grateful
Dead shows he's attended, Tyrrell had correctly
calculated the Dead's playlist for the spring 2009
show that we attended at Shoreline
Amphitheater. Despite this, the concert had an
unexpected element.
"They've never done that before," he leaned
over and said in response to an intermission of fire
dancing.
Tyrrell's appreciation for the Dead developed
around the same time that he was at Stanford. He
was attracted to the music at first and then the
scene.
"It was a very free community that was really
open to anybody who was open to the music," he
said.
Then, on Oct. 9,1982, he had the opportunity
to see the Dead play at Frost Amphitheater on the
Stanford campus, the "best" show he's seen yet.
He had remarked at his Admit Weekend that
Frost would have been a perfect place for the
Dead to play. Then, four years later, they did.
"It was almost a culmination," Tyrrell said.
When I asked Tyrrell whether he had any clos
ing remarks, I heard him grin on the other end of
the phone.
"Beat Cal!" he said.
