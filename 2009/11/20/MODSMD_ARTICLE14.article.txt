# RIVALS WITH A CAUSE

### STEPHANIE LIOU 
Bashing Cal is a staple of Big Game Week, but in
true Cardinal fashion, students also choose to
Despite this being the 112 th year of Big Game rivalry,
new events tapping into the Beat Cal spirit have only
increased with time, growing significantly over the past few
years.
A "Big Drive" canned food collection competition
between the Athletic Departments of Stanford and Cal has
traditionally taken place each year in conjunction with Big

Game, but it has been opened up to campus-wide participa
tion this year.
"We are trying to get as much participation from the stu
dent body as possible," said Sarah Flynn 'l2. From Nov. 16-
21, cans may be dropped off at various sporting events and
at the Recreation Center, and donations will be given to the
Flarvest Food Bank. The winner of Big Drive will be
announced during halftime at Big Game, Flynn said.
On the other hand, the paper that you are currently read
ing is a participant in one of the oldest "untraditional rival
ries" which exist during Big Game week.
"Each year, the Daily staff gets together with the Daily
Californian Staff before the Big Game for a heated flag foot
ball battle," said Zach Zimmerman 'l2, managing editor of
sports. "Last year, we were pummeled by The Daily

Californian. However we've revamped our team and are
completely confident that we will take it down this year."
This epic encounter, commonly referred to as "Ink
Bowl," is a great chance for members of both newspaper
staffs to have some good-natured competition accompanied
by free-flowing cheering and mingling with an emphasis
on the "free-flowing."
Another new event, the brainchild of the freshman
interns of the Business Association of Stanford
Entrepreneurial Students (BASES), is "Beat Cal for
Poverty." As part of their entry for the Gumball Challenge,
the BASES students designed this event to support microfi
nance organization Kiva.org, which funds loans to entrepre
neurs in developing countries.
"We're having a water balloon extravaganza in White

Plaza, when anyone can "beat up" some Cal students (or
rather, our team dressed up like Cal students), get their pic
ture taken, donate money and tell everyone 'I Beat Cal for
Poverty!'" said Ruby Lee 'l3. "We're hoping that everyone
will be pumped up from the rivalry spirit this week and feel
generous enough to donate a dollar to an extremely mean
ingful cause,"
Originally designed to be a one-day event, "Beat Cal for
Poverty" was extremely successful on Tuesday and has been
extended throughout the week as well.
"Most undergraduate students were really supportive
and excited about it and some graduate students, while ini
tially confused about what was going on, were also very
enthusiastic," Lee said. "Tapping into the rivalry was defi
nitely a great idea."
Two other highly beneficial competitions taking place
during Big Game week are "Ambition," a bone marrow typ
ing drive, and the "Beat Cal" blood drive organized by the
Stanford Blood Center.
"All 49 Chapters of Lambda Phi Epsilon across the
nation have been working with the National Marrow Donor
Program (NMDP) since 1993," said Andrew Dao 'lO.
Inspired by the underrepresentation of Asians and
minorities in the national registry, as well as having a deep
personal connection through brother Evan Chen '97 who
passed away from leukemia and was the original motivation
for collaboration with the NMDP, Lambda Phi Epsilon has
held bone marrow typing drives yearly on campus.
"In 2008, we decided to start working with the Berkeley
chapter, with whom we are actually very close, in order to
play up the rivalry and make it a more fun competition,"
Dao recalled.
The results were astounding.
"We got a lot more publicity because of Big Game week
previously, we typed maybe 90 people maximum, but last
year we got over 500 participants."
Despite losing narrowly to Cal last year, Dao is confident
that the Cardinal will come out on top this year.
Similarly, the Stanford Blood Center has noticed great
success since they started integrating rivalry competition
into blood drives eight years ago. This is the second year that
the "Rivals for Life" blood drive has been hyped up as part
of Big Game week and held at Arrillaga.
"Cal has three times our student body, so we really want
ed to find away to make the contest fairer," said coordina
tor Elisa Manzanares. "We decided to make it a one-day
competition and since making that change, Stanford has won
every time. Last year, we broke the blood center record, col
lecting 234 units to their 171!"
Student response has been overwhelming, for which
Manzanares credits the addition of good-natured anti-Cal
sentiments.

The staffs of The Stanford Daily and The Daily Californian face off before the 2008 Big Game in the annual Ink Bowl. Stanford and Cal have a variety of
untraditional rivalries in the lead-up to Big Game.
"Our 'There will be blood' posters
were so popular that many got stolen,
which was hilarious but the motiva
tion of rivalry has been lots of fun and
has really helped us raise awareness,"
she said. "And the real winners are the
patients."
So, if you really support the
Cardinal, "Can the Bears," spare some
blood or shell out a few bucks. Show
that we aren't just superior at athletics
and academics, but as creative and con

scious citizens.
"Instead of just celebrating our
football success, I think it's really awe
some that we're spreading our enthusi
asm into supporting the community,"
said Brie Bunge 'l3.
After all, as Manzanares quipped,
"It only takes one hour to save a life
and to beat Call"
