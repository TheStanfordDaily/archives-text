Big Game Week is meant to remind stu
dents of the pride we have in our
school and our athletic program.
Events ranging from the impaling of the Bear
in the claw to the Big Game Hourly
Countdown and Rally bring students togeth
er across disciplines and dorms to support
our football team. The Axe Committee and
the students with the points to gain priority
seating into Big Game seem excited through
the first game week in recent memory that
finds Stanford favored. However, our quick
ascendancy seems to be lost on many stu
dents on the Farm.
Current seniors on the Cardinal football
team will still recall the abysmal 1-11 they
were forced to endure as freshmen. From the
student perspective, many underclassmen
attended Big Game simply because engage
ment in the rivalry is a Stanford tradition, not
because they actually believed Stanford
could win. In 2007, when we upset Cal here at
home, the victory sent Shockwaves through
campus. The mere consideration of the tear
ing down of goalposts here at Stanford is a
foreign one, but such sheer displays of exalta
tion were on the minds of many. Our upset of
formerly perennial power USC that same
year prompted a Maples Pavilion courtyard
filling rally, greeting players upon their
return, and a large Quad bonfire.
This year, as the Cardinal team enjoys its
most extraordinary season in recent memory,
a similar outpouring of camaraderie seems to
be missing from campus. Currently ranked
number 14 in the nation with a plausible
chance at the Rose Bowl we seem to have
been unable to muster the same kind of cam
pus-wide vigor as when we were less than
impressive and surprised everyone. Though
many students made the trek to USC and
proudly stormed the field after our victory,
little of that energy translated to campus
enthusiasm later that night. The crowd that
met the returning players at Maples Pavilion

was meager compared to the one from two
years ago, even though the Cardinal com
pletely trounced USC this time around. Only
a few seasons ago, we celebrated small victo
ries against Pac-10 powerhouses as if we had
won the conference. Now, when we actually
have the chance to be conference champions,
our expression of support seems to be lack
ing.
The team's success in Big Game, and
through the coming weeks, has positive
repercussions not only for our football pro
gram, but also for the whole institution.
Highly respected academically and for our
Director's Cup-winning athletics depart
ment, our football success helps focus even
more attention on our campus and communi
ty. A recent New York Times piece on
Heisman hopeful Toby Gerhart is just one of
the lights currently being shined on the
Cardinal football team, and thus on Stanford
as well. The article noted we have seen four
alumni become Supreme Court justices since
our last Heisman winner in 1970. The
Editorial Board hopes our continued success
on the football field will help hasten the day
when Stanford is envied as much for its foot
ball program as for its academic departments
and faculty.
While Big Game week invokes feelings of
nostalgic pride regarding our recent upset of
Cal and of "The Play," our increasing fervor
for our team should also stem from an under
standing of how far we have come in such a
short time. Coach Harbaugh sent coaches
and assistants to every house meeting his first
year on campus as one of his many efforts to
remind students of our program's storied his
tory. The Editorial Board hopes all who are
part of our campus community reach back to
the program and find away to support our
team this weekend. Whether you are at the
game or not, have pride in the Stanford foot
ball team, and remember how far we have
come.
