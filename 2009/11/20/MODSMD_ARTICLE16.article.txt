# THE 						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## Urgent Ethical Reforms for the ASSU 
### Shelley Gao 
r I The ASSU is suffering from a credibility cri
sis. Trust in the Association has been
A. severely eroded as a result of the resigna
tion of the vice president and allegations of dis
cretionary spending abuse by former executives.
These controversies cannot go ignored. Urgent
reforms must be implemented to restore confi
dence in the institution. The student body
deserves better. You deserve better.
In order to move forward, the ASSU needs
to undertake a comprehensive examination of
its conduct, implement measures to deter future
wrongdoings and establish thorough discipli
nary procedures. A commission on ethical
reform should be created immediately. It should
include representatives from all ASSU bodies.
To ensure both the unrestricted evaluation of
ASSU activities and officials and the legitimacy
of the findings, the commission should be
chaired by an independent "prosecutor."
The commission's charge should encompass
two folds. Fir st, investigate the depth of decep
tion and potential ethical violations involved in
the circumstances surrounding the recent
ASSU executive scandals. Second, recommend
and establish longer-term institutional reforms.
Most of the attention in the confirmation
process has been focused on the qualifications
of the nominees. The real unresolved issue con
cerns the complicity, and possible misconduct, of
current office holders. Is it appropriate for the
president, who learned of the Judicial Affairs
sentence and the inevitable resignation in the
summer, to allow his V.P. to continue serving and
perhaps even receive a salary?
As stipulated in the ASSU Constitution, the
Senate and the GSC are responsible for per
forming rigorous oversight of the executives.
The Association's legislative bodies have the
power to remove the president and/or vice pres
ident by a four-fifths vote each. But, in practice,
there are inherent limitations in peer-to-peer
oversight. It can be hard to question your
friend's competence and character. The Daily
has also been disappointingly negligent of its
duty to exercise scrutiny of student government
and pursue the truth of recent controversies.
After a comprehensive investigation of the
past violations, the Commission should move on
to its second charge: prescribing stronger ethical
guidelines. All elected and appointed ASSU
officials should adopt a code of conduct. The
governing documents state that an elected offi
cer can be dismissed as a result of "consistent
failure to attend regular meetings," "actions
clearly violating the intent of this Constitution"
and actions that are "unbecoming." Coupled
with the lack of political will that unfortunately
tends to characterize most ASSU representa
tives and the vagueness of the language, this pro
vision is basically inconsequential.
Hence, a pledge of ethics needs to be estab
lished. It should be administered at the same

time as the Oath of Office, during the swearing
in ceremony for newly elected officials. The
pledge should provide an interpretation of
"unbecoming" behavior and clear expectations
of ASSU officials during their terms of service.
The letter and the spirit of the principles govern
ing conduct should be equally important.
Student government officers need to recognize
that their decisions have far-reaching impacts
that extend beyond their private lives.
This ethical code serves as a powerful sym
bolic way of enhancing the integrity of the insti
tution. But, absent of enforcement mechanisms,
it is merely empty rhetoric. A second recom
mendation should focus on improving trans
parency of discretionary spending, thus elimi
nating the potential for improper use of public
funds for personal expenditures. There are
numerous ASSU officials with $l,OOO discre
tionary accounts and almost no rules regulating
their spending. This is unacceptable.
Every expense incurred by any ASSU offi
cial submitted for reimbursement should be
posted publicly online and in real-time , not just
at the end of the quarter as promised by the cur
rent executive. This functions as a self-checking
device, reducing wasteful spending in a time of
economic hardship.
In addition to the series of steps outlined
above, the commission needs to assess the effec
tiveness of the punitive process outlined in the
joint bylaws. While the legislative bodies should
maintain their right to overturn any disciplinary
measures by a two-thirds vote, the
Constitutional Council should be further
empowered to impeach ASSU officials.
By running for office, we forgo our lives as
private citizens to enter the public arena. We
need to hold ourselves to higher standards. Yes,
we are humans. We make mistakes. What's dan
gerous, however, is not realizing our mistakes.
The challenge is to leam from the past and start
professionalizing the ASSU. It is imperative that
we start a broader conversation and move
toward a culture of transparency and accounta
bility.
Why does it matter? It matters because it is
your money. You are being robbed of effective
representation. A more reputable ASSU means
a stronger student government advocating on
your behalf It means an ASSU having more
sway when negotiating with University adminis
trators regarding students' priorities in budget
cuts. If you don't care about ethics for ethics'
sake, care because you are missing out on better
parties and variety of academic opportunities.
You should demand more from us.
