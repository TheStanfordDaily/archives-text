## 'Pump kin Pie Famine' 
### R.G. Mann 
"There is definitely a shortage of pumpkins,
and it's really due to a smaller yield this year.
The pumpkin yield nationwide was down 70
percent, so that's a huge reduction in what
we're used to," said Vivian King of Roundy's
Supermarkets.
This is potentially bad news for pumpkin
pie lovers like Pat Moore. Moore said that he
just had pumpkin pie at his niece's birthday
and will be disappointed if the shortage pre
vents him from having more.
"We like pumpkin pie, and everyone was
commenting on how delicious it was, so it
would be missed if there's a shortage," Moore
said.

Sweet Jesus, hide your children. Lock the
door. Good. Now lock it again. If Pat
Moore smells pumpkin anywhere near
your family, he will eat them.
I don't mean to be an alarmist, but I used
to work with Pat Moore. He had the cubicle
next to mine. Seemed like nice enough guy
was into golf and boats, that sort of thing. We
used to take smoke breaks together. But one
time, I remember, we walked down to
Roundy's to pick up a pack of cigs, and while
we're walking through the store, Pat stops
dead in his tracks and just stares at this bin of
pumpkins. His eyes go all googly and he starts
muttering to himself. Something about ample
harvests, sweet round lovelies, and all of a sud
den he raises his arms and screams, "All my
crusts shall be filled!"
I didn't think anything of it at the time.
Someone's always flipping out at Roundy's,
it's just that kind of place. Besides, Pat seemed
totally normal otherwise.
The next year, Pat's wife left him right at

the end of October, so we decided to invite
him over to our place for Thanksgiving, you
know, to cheer him up. We figured if he got a
load of my family, then he might not mind
being divorced and completely alone.
Now, this was back in 2002, year of the
Great Pumpkin Famine. As you well remem
ber, it devastated everyone's dessert plans.
The cans of filling disappeared from store
shelves in September, the pumpkin bin at
Roundy's stayed empty through October and
many pumpkin farmers jumped out their win
dows. Fortunately, most of them lived in
ranch-style homes. But their state of despera
tion was not lost on us. Come the week of
Thanksgiving, we thought long and hard
about how we were going to get by. We had
heard reports of people making pie with net
tles and shoe leather, but we swallowed our
dignity and settled for blueberry filling.
Sometimes, we must be thankful for very little.
The day of Thanksgiving, my extended
family rolled in. I say rolled because my Aunt
Blanche, in the years prior to her stomach sta
pling, had to be wheeled in on a dolly, while
cousin Elmer had taken to wearing roller
skates to family events ever since his head
injury. Uncle Poot arrived true to form, farting
the national anthem and in his customary
overalls whose baggy depths concealed
loaded firearms.
Then Pat Moore showed up. He had a
crazed look. He said he had just come from
his niece's birthday. "Guess what? They had
pie there. It was pumpkin pie. I ate it. Little
girls don't deserve pumpkin pie. Pat Moore
deserves pumpkin pie. We will be very disap
pointed if something prevents us from having
more pie."
Sure, I was a little unnerved, but I felt sorry
for the guy. Everyone was hard hit by the
pumpkin famine, I told him. It was only natu-

ral to be upset. And here, I gently inserted that
this Thanksgiving, given such dire circum
stances, we would be concluding the meal with
blueberry pie.
At that moment, I saw the switch flip in Pat
Moore.
We tried to proceed with the meal like
everything was normal. But Pat just stared at
his plate; not even Uncle Foot's racist jokes
could trigger a reaction. Cousin Elmer, oblivi
ous to the tension, chirped, "Hey, Pat doesn't
eat turkey. Just like Elmer. Elmer only eats
ham!" Pat slowly looked up, his eyes swelling
as they took in cousin Elmer's orange protec
tive helmet. "Pumpkin?" Pat intoned, raising
his finger to Elmer's head. "Pumpkin." And
with that, he dove across the table and, with a
gruesome efficiency, tore poor cousin Elmer's
head clean from its shoulders and devoured it
whole. By the time Uncle Poot had fetched his
gun from his overalls, Pat Moore was gone.
In the days following Thanksgiving, brig
ands could be seen roaming the suburbs.
Looting the wilting jack-o-lanterns from their
neighbors' doorsteps, lopping the hands off
homeowners clinging to their gourds, plunder
ing autumnal cornucopias in window displays,
the pumpkin gangs ravaged the Midwest on
their campaign of terror. Their leader: a man
named Pat Moore, a savage man, a man like
you and me, a lover of pumpkin pie. Give
thanks that he doesn't find you.
