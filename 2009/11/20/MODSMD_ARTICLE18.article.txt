# CAMPUS CONVERSATION
## 'Resignations, ASSU Shenanigans and Daily Coverage' 
### 
Zack Warma: JCarr: Since you are most
certainly not a man to beat around the
bush, let's have at it, shall we? Ten days ago,
Jay de la Torre shocked the University by
resigning as vice president of the ASSU,
admitting that his decision was a result of
his violation of the Honor Code in CSIO6A
last fall, and the subsequent verdict of
Judicial Affairs. I know you have some
issues you want hashed out, and imma let
you finish, but I first want to pick your
brain about what struck me about this
messy affair:
1) Judicial Affairs process is broken:
You, a Daily op-ed and no doubt others
have all been asking the same question: "If
Jay knew this was a possibility, then why did

he even run?" I see the validity in that argu
ment. However, that should have never
even been an option. As things went down,
Jay was caught at the end of fall and kept in
limbo until summer. That is frankly inex
cusable. Judicial Affairs should be able to
produce verdicts the very next quarter, and
hopeful dispense sentences for the quarter
after that. Jay should have been able to
know his fate before even thinking of run
ning.
2) ASSU Accountability: Right now, we
have literally nothing on the books about
ethical standards, much less a means of
enforcement, for folks in student govern
ment. Going forward, there's rightfully a
bunch of talk about how we make ASSU

leaders more accountable to the student
body. Be it creating a watch dog unit or
some other vehicle, what can be done to
increase awareness of an organization that
largely the campus does not give a hoot
about?
You're up, paco ...
Jordan Carr: Mr. Warma,
About the judicial system, I agree. From
what I understand, jurors were canceling or
not showing up, causing a massive backlog.
Considering that the Board of Judicial
Affairs refuses some applicants, one might
think that they could expand the pool of
