# CAMPUS CONVERSATION
## 'Resignations, ASSU Shenanigans and Daily Coverage' 
### 
Zack Warma: JCarr: Since you are most
certainly not a man to beat around the
bush, let's have at it, shall we? Ten days ago,
Jay de la Torre shocked the University by
resigning as vice president of the ASSU,
admitting that his decision was a result of
his violation of the Honor Code in CSIO6A
last fall, and the subsequent verdict of
Judicial Affairs. I know you have some
issues you want hashed out, and imma let
you finish, but I first want to pick your
brain about what struck me about this
messy affair:
1) Judicial Affairs process is broken:
You, a Daily op-ed and no doubt others
have all been asking the same question: "If
Jay knew this was a possibility, then why did

he even run?" I see the validity in that argu
ment. However, that should have never
even been an option. As things went down,
Jay was caught at the end of fall and kept in
limbo until summer. That is frankly inex
cusable. Judicial Affairs should be able to
produce verdicts the very next quarter, and
hopeful dispense sentences for the quarter
after that. Jay should have been able to
know his fate before even thinking of run
ning.
2) ASSU Accountability: Right now, we
have literally nothing on the books about
ethical standards, much less a means of
enforcement, for folks in student govern
ment. Going forward, there's rightfully a
bunch of talk about how we make ASSU

leaders more accountable to the student
body. Be it creating a watch dog unit or
some other vehicle, what can be done to
increase awareness of an organization that
largely the campus does not give a hoot
about?
You're up, paco ...
Jordan Carr: Mr. Warma,
About the judicial system, I agree. From
what I understand, jurors were canceling or
not showing up, causing a massive backlog.
Considering that the Board of Judicial
Affairs refuses some applicants, one might
think that they could expand the pool of
jurors and expel those who are not
up to the task. Another option
might be to introduce an option to
plead guilty, which could expedite
trials where the evidence is incon
trovertible. I don't think the ASSU
needs to do anything in response to
this case; it seems like an aberra
tion. Mr. de la Torre knew he was
accused of an Honor Code viola
tion he committed and still ran; I
find it hard to believe he did that, or
that someone else would, especially
now that we know public figures
will not receive special treatment.
He should have been allowed to
run and had no obligation to dis
close his situation so long as there
had been no conviction. Unpleasant

as allowing his candidacy is, disal
lowing it is much worse.
There absolutely should be a
watchdog to prevent this type of
behavior: The Stanford Daily. Yet,
The Daily has unequivocally shirked
its responsibility. There has been no
comment from the Daily Editorial
Board and no reporting on the topic.
The second highest official in student
government resigned, and the cam
pus paper has nothing to say. It's cow
ardly and embarrassing; the biggest
campus story of the year has been
swept under the rug. All there's been
is one unsolicited op-ed, a brief state
ment atop Mr. de la Torre's resigna
tion statement, and now this debate.
An adequate response might
discourage wrongdoers from seek
ing positions of power. Good
reporting holds public figures not
to a higher standard, but to a public
version of the same standard as the
rest of us, hopefully raising the

costs of misbehavior. So far, it has
not even been that. Instead, The
Daily has sent the message that we
protect our own, which is either
corrupt, lazy or both.
What do you think? Am I out of
line, or did The Daily fail its reader
ship?
Warma: It's a quality point, JCarr.
And you, out of line? Never! I
wouldn't go so far to say that The
Daily failed us the resignation
hit like the campus like a ton of
bricks, this paper included. Even
we within ASSU are still honestly
trying to piece everything together.
And this may sound hokey, but for
pressing campus concerns, it can't
be a one way street —journalists
and, of equal (if not of greater)
importance, the students, need to
find away to push the issues that
we think need to be addressed.
Until next time, peace out, brah.
