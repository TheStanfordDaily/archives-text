# OP-ED
## Band Gone Wild? Hardly. 
### 
Five and a half years ago, one of the biggest
reasons I came to Stanford was that no
other university has a band quite like ours.
I grew up on their "Controversial Actions"
Wikipedia page, and when I found out my
HPAC had been one of the brides in the band's
infamous marriage gag at BYU, I gained an
admiration for her that no transcript could ever
provide. And although many of the Band's
actions may have been tasteless (see: Notre
Dame, Oregon, USC), each has stemmed from
a legitimate, socially conscious stance (opposing
bigotry, environmental destruction and murder
and excessive media attention).
It is thus with a huge amount of pride that, as
of the ASU field shows, I am now a band writer.
The Band comes up with the shows they want
to perform, and writers come up with material
to bridge the formations and inspire others.
I am also proud to say that I wrote much of
this past weekend's Girls Gone Wild show at

USC. The show, which dug into sleazebag
GGW founder and USC alum Joe Francis,
included entirely factual lines like this:

"USC can't take all the credit for the suc
cesses of its students. After all, it takes a special
kind of man to be wanted for sexual harass
ment, drug trafficking, tax evasion, prostitution,
child abuse and disruptive flatulence, but that's
just the kind of captain of industry Joe Francis
is."
But a few things led this show to draw atten
tion across the Internet (Huffington Post,
Twitter, etc.) and in our own administration.
First of all, there was the fact that god-among
men Jim Harbaugh orchestrated an utter, 55-21
shaming of USC. Confused and distraught, sev
eral SC fans then complained about the Band
show they booed through.
Their most frequent qualm was that the
band formed a soap-on-a-rope in reference to
Francis's prison stays. While the Stanford athlet

ic department approved this formation, during
the show the complex arrangement got mud
died, and USC fans misinterpreted it. As one
USC fan tweeted: "Stanford marching band
makes an ejaculating penis." The Twitter name
of that reliable witness? @emmadoes69.
I wish I were making that up. I also wish that
her opinion hadn't mattered, but the USC fans'
inaccurate, angry tweets, combined with their e
mails and phone calls (one man called in saying
he somehow saw a formation where a father
was having sex with his daughter), have forced
our athletic department to pay heed.
I certainly do not envy our administrators
who end up having to placate upset audience
members any time the band does something
offensive (which, if Band had its way, would be
pretty often). At the same time, though, 1 wish
they had said, "We truly are sorry you saw a
