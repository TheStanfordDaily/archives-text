# OP-ED
## Band Gone Wild? Hardly. 
### 
Five and a half years ago, one of the biggest
reasons I came to Stanford was that no
other university has a band quite like ours.
I grew up on their "Controversial Actions"
Wikipedia page, and when I found out my
HPAC had been one of the brides in the band's
infamous marriage gag at BYU, I gained an
admiration for her that no transcript could ever
provide. And although many of the Band's
actions may have been tasteless (see: Notre
Dame, Oregon, USC), each has stemmed from
a legitimate, socially conscious stance (opposing
bigotry, environmental destruction and murder
and excessive media attention).
It is thus with a huge amount of pride that, as
of the ASU field shows, I am now a band writer.
The Band comes up with the shows they want
to perform, and writers come up with material
to bridge the formations and inspire others.
I am also proud to say that I wrote much of
this past weekend's Girls Gone Wild show at

USC. The show, which dug into sleazebag
GGW founder and USC alum Joe Francis,
included entirely factual lines like this:

"USC can't take all the credit for the suc
cesses of its students. After all, it takes a special
kind of man to be wanted for sexual harass
ment, drug trafficking, tax evasion, prostitution,
child abuse and disruptive flatulence, but that's
just the kind of captain of industry Joe Francis
is."
But a few things led this show to draw atten
tion across the Internet (Huffington Post,
Twitter, etc.) and in our own administration.
First of all, there was the fact that god-among
men Jim Harbaugh orchestrated an utter, 55-21
shaming of USC. Confused and distraught, sev
eral SC fans then complained about the Band
show they booed through.
Their most frequent qualm was that the
band formed a soap-on-a-rope in reference to
Francis's prison stays. While the Stanford athlet

ic department approved this formation, during
the show the complex arrangement got mud
died, and USC fans misinterpreted it. As one
USC fan tweeted: "Stanford marching band
makes an ejaculating penis." The Twitter name
of that reliable witness? @emmadoes69.
I wish I were making that up. I also wish that
her opinion hadn't mattered, but the USC fans'
inaccurate, angry tweets, combined with their e
mails and phone calls (one man called in saying
he somehow saw a formation where a father
was having sex with his daughter), have forced
our athletic department to pay heed.
I certainly do not envy our administrators
who end up having to placate upset audience
members any time the band does something
offensive (which, if Band had its way, would be
pretty often). At the same time, though, 1 wish
they had said, "We truly are sorry you saw a
penis (or a man having sex with his
daughter) while the formation was
unclear, having talked to band mem
bers and seen the footage and forma
tion charts, we trust that they did try to
form a soap-on-a-rope."
At the very least, I wish they had
said, "Dudes. It wasn't a penis. The
band's made penises before, and that
was definitely not one." Or even: "You
know what? Joe Francis is, truthfully,
kind of a douche. The band has every
right to criticize him." It's frustrating
seeing the representatives for our
school having to bend over backward
to apologize for things the band didn't
even do, when the majority of blogs,
videos and comments on the Internet
have been overwhelmingly support

ive, often calling the show funny, time
ly and poignant.
Perhaps it would help if band sup
porters called in as often as its detrac
tors. Maybe then we would be able to
write the Big Game show we wanted
to. Instead, we've had to remove
cheap digs at Cal (example: that their
hippies smell bad. It's such an old, clas
sic, harmless joke that I would be
shocked if anyone still found it offen
sive), as well as our substantial jabs
(we had a joke about their athletic
department siphoning funds from
their academic budget.
Problematically, band sided with Cal's
furious professors).
It's a shame because these cuts are
unnecessary, but it's even more disap
pointing because tomorrow is the
most important Big Game in decades.
If not even band can mock Cal for fear
of upsetting their fans, who can?
That is, aside from the football
team. I hope we go for two every

chance we get.
Apart from the Band, one of the
biggest reasons I came to Stanford
was the rivalry; during Princeton's
admit weekend, I once asked my
RoHo if they had one. His response:
"Well, Penn kinda thinks we're rivals
with them, but I mean, there's just no
way they're on our level."
The second we stop throwing mud
is the second we cease to be rivals with
Cal and start thinking we're too good
for them. Our rivalry is fun because in
most ways, Stanford and Cal are pret
ty equal. They can handle jokes at
their expense just as we should be able
to tolerate ones at ours. It's college. It's
fun. It's necessary.

Kevin's going to Big Game on Saturday
so he can watch Stanford dominate.

ones! He loves those) to Kevin at
