# IT'S GO TIME
## Cardinal looks to take the Axe back from Cal 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Big Game is here.
The Stanford-Cal rivalry commenced
with the first Big Game on March 19,1892
in San Francisco's Haight Street Grounds.
Stanford holds a slight lead in the series,
55-45-11. In recent years, however, the ri
valry has been dominated by Cal: the
Golden Bears have won six of the past
seven Big Games, including a resounding
37-16 win last year.
This year's Stanford team, however, is

not the Stanford team of years past.
No. 14 Stanford (7-3,6-2 Pac-10) is bowl
eligible and ranked in the top 15 for the
first time since 2001. Additionally, the
team is coming off a trio of huge wins:
against Arizona State, following a pair of
momentum-halting losses against Oregon
State and Arizona; against then-No. 7 Ore
gon, making Stanford bowl-eligible for the
first time since 2001 and keeping the Car
dinal in the race for a Rose Bowl appear
ance; and finally, against then-No. 11USC,
racking up the most points ever scored
against the Trojans in a 55-21 massacre at

the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Stanford, however, is not ready to bask
in its past achievements.
"We know who we are," said Head
Coach Jim Harbaugh at Monday's pre-Big
Game press conference. "We're a blue col
lar team that's gotta prepare, gotta study,
gotta practice with great intensity .. .
[Ojur guys, they have the ability to handle
tough times and they have the ability to
handle more rewarding times ... We're al
ready back to work."

NOTES ! No. 14 Stanford looks to regain the Axe from its
biggest rival, No. 25 Cal, in this year's Big Game. The Cardi
nal needs to beat Cal in order to keep its dreams of a Rose
Bowl alive. The Golden Bears have won four of their past five
games despite losing star running back Jahvid Best to a violent
concussion. Cal has won six of the past seven Big Games, but
Stanford won the last matchup at Stanford Stadium in 2007.
