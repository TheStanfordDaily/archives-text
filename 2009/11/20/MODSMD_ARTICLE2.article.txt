# IT'S GO TIME
## Cardinal looks to take the Axe back from Cal 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Big Game is here.
The Stanford-Cal rivalry commenced
with the first Big Game on March 19,1892
in San Francisco's Haight Street Grounds.
Stanford holds a slight lead in the series,
55-45-11. In recent years, however, the ri
valry has been dominated by Cal: the
Golden Bears have won six of the past
seven Big Games, including a resounding
37-16 win last year.
This year's Stanford team, however, is

not the Stanford team of years past.
No. 14 Stanford (7-3,6-2 Pac-10) is bowl
eligible and ranked in the top 15 for the
first time since 2001. Additionally, the
team is coming off a trio of huge wins:
against Arizona State, following a pair of
momentum-halting losses against Oregon
State and Arizona; against then-No. 7 Ore
gon, making Stanford bowl-eligible for the
first time since 2001 and keeping the Car
dinal in the race for a Rose Bowl appear
ance; and finally, against then-No. 11USC,
racking up the most points ever scored
against the Trojans in a 55-21 massacre at

the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Stanford, however, is not ready to bask
in its past achievements.
"We know who we are," said Head
Coach Jim Harbaugh at Monday's pre-Big
Game press conference. "We're a blue col
lar team that's gotta prepare, gotta study,
gotta practice with great intensity .. .
[Ojur guys, they have the ability to handle
tough times and they have the ability to
handle more rewarding times ... We're al
ready back to work."

NOTES ! No. 14 Stanford looks to regain the Axe from its
biggest rival, No. 25 Cal, in this year's Big Game. The Cardi
nal needs to beat Cal in order to keep its dreams of a Rose
Bowl alive. The Golden Bears have won four of their past five
games despite losing star running back Jahvid Best to a violent
concussion. Cal has won six of the past seven Big Games, but
Stanford won the last matchup at Stanford Stadium in 2007.

The Cardinal will need to be on its
game, as Cal has been gaining some
momentum of its own. Cal (7-3, 4-3
Pac-10) was ranked No. 12 in both
the AP and USA Today polls in the
preseason, and after starting off the
season with a series of decisive wins,
jumped to No. 6 in both polls. A pair
of losses to Oregon and USC in the
following weeks dropped the Golden
Bears out of the top 25 in both polls,
but they have recovered, winning
four of their past five games.
Last week, the Golden Bears de
feated then-No. 18 Arizona, 24-16.
Shane Vereen, playing in place of star
tailback Jahvid Best, who is recover
ing from a serious concussion he sus
tained against Oregon State, posted a
career-high 159 rushing yards on 30
carries and a touchdown. The Cal de
fense held the Wildcats to 274 yards
of total offense, an average of only
four yards per play and intercepted
Arizona sophomore quarterback
Nick Foles twice.

Overall, Cal is ranked first in the
Pac-10 in rush defense, allowing only

3.1 yards per carry. Junior linebacker
Mike Mohamed leads the confer
ence in tackles.

"Right now it looks like we're
gonna have our hands full and a great
challenge with this Cal team," Har
baugh said. "They have an identity on
both sides of the ball, offensively and
defensively, special teams, they're
very impressive to watch, ft will be a
big challenge for our offense."
"I think Cal has got the best de
fensive front that we've faced all
year," he added. "Tyson Alualu is the
best defensive lineman in the Pac-10,
they've got great linebackers,
[Devin] Bishop, [Mike] Mohamed,
[Mychal] Kendrix all those guys,
they've got an identity defensively."
The Cal defense will have a tough
test when it faces Stanford's prolific
offense, which leads the Pac-10 with
almost 450 total yards per game.
Much of that success is due to senior
tailback Toby Gerhart, who is cur
rently third in the nation in rushing
yards with 1,395 yards in 10 games.
He averages 5.3 yards per carry and
leads all running backs with 19 rush
ing touchdowns.
"I personally think that not only
should he be in the [Heisman] discus
sion," Harbaugh said, "but based on
what he's accomplishing and what

he's accomplished up until this point,
he should win it."
Luck is ranked 13th in the nation
in passing efficiency with a rating of
151.84 and fourth in the nation in
yards per attempt with 9.3. On top of
that, he's Stanford's second-leading
rusher with 288 rushing yards, 5.6
yards per carry and 2 rushing touch
downs.
"There have been some really
good quarterbacks at Stanford since
John Elway," ESPN broadcaster
David Norrie told the San Jose Mer
cury News. "But this is the first Stan
ford quarterback since Elway where
you go,' Wow.'"
A win would keep the Cardinal
alive in the race for the Pac-10 title
and a Rose Bowl berth, not to men
tion bringing the Axe back to Stan
ford.The Cardinal knows the Golden
Bears will provide a steep challenge,
though.
"In a rivalry game," Gerhart
warns, "teams bring their A-game.
Everything's above and beyond
records, or what's happened in the
past. For that one weekend, anything
goes."
"This week, this game, is huge."

almost 450 total yards per game.
Much of that success is due to senior
tailback Toby Gerhart, who is cur
rently third in the nation in rushing
yards with 1,395 yards in 10 games.
He averages 5.3 yards per carry and
leads all running backs with 19 rush
ing touchdowns.
"I personally think that not only
should he be in the [Heisman] discus
sion," Harbaugh said, "but based on
what he's accomplishing and what

he's accomplished up until this point,
he should win it."
Luck is ranked 13th in the nation
in passing efficiency with a rating of
151.84 and fourth in the nation in
yards per attempt with 9.3. On top of
that, he's Stanford's second-leading
rusher with 288 rushing yards, 5.6
yards per carry and 2 rushing touch
downs.
"There have been some really
good quarterbacks at Stanford since
John Elway," ESPN broadcaster
David Norrie told the San Jose Mer
cury News. "But this is the first Stan
ford quarterback since Elway where
you go,' Wow.'"
A win would keep the Cardinal
alive in the race for the Pac-10 title
and a Rose Bowl berth, not to men

ford.The Cardinal knows the Golden
Bears will provide a steep challenge,
though.
"In a rivalry game," Gerhart
warns, "teams bring their A-game.
Everything's above and beyond
records, or what's happened in the
past. For that one weekend, anything
goes."
"This week, this game, is huge."

Senior running back Toby Gerhart hurdles would-be tacklers on his way to another 100-yard performance. Gerhart will look to help his team and his Heisman Trophy candidacy when he takes on the Cal defense tomorrow
night.
Big Game is here.
The Stanford-Cal rivalry commenced
with the first Big Game on March 19,1892
in San Francisco's Haight Street Grounds.
Stanford holds a slight lead in the series,
55-45-11. In recent years, however, the ri
valry has been dominated by Cal: the
Golden Bears have won six of the past
seven Big Games, including a resounding
37-16 win last year.
This year's Stanford team, however, is

not the Stanford team of years past.
No. 14 Stanford (7-3,6-2 Pac-10) is bowl
eligible and ranked in the top 15 for the
first time since 2001. Additionally, the
team is coming off a trio of huge wins:
against Arizona State, following a pair of
momentum-halting losses against Oregon
State and Arizona; against then-No. 7 Ore
gon, making Stanford bowl-eligible for the
first time since 2001 and keeping the Car
dinal in the race for a Rose Bowl appear
ance; and finally, against then-No. 11USC,
racking up the most points ever scored
against the Trojans in a 55-21 massacre at

the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Stanford, however, is not ready to bask
in its past achievements.
"We know who we are," said Head
Coach Jim Harbaugh at Monday's pre-Big
Game press conference. "We're a blue col
lar team that's gotta prepare, gotta study,
gotta practice with great intensity .. .
[Ojur guys, they have the ability to handle
tough times and they have the ability to
handle more rewarding times ... We're al
ready back to work."

NOTES ! No. 14 Stanford looks to regain the Axe from its
biggest rival, No. 25 Cal, in this year's Big Game. The Cardi
nal needs to beat Cal in order to keep its dreams of a Rose
Bowl alive. The Golden Bears have won four of their past five
games despite losing star running back Jahvid Best to a violent
concussion. Cal has won six of the past seven Big Games, but
Stanford won the last matchup at Stanford Stadium in 2007.

The Cardinal will need to be on its
game, as Cal has been gaining some
momentum of its own. Cal (7-3, 4-3
Pac-10) was ranked No. 12 in both
the AP and USA Today polls in the
preseason, and after starting off the
season with a series of decisive wins,
jumped to No. 6 in both polls. A pair
of losses to Oregon and USC in the
following weeks dropped the Golden
Bears out of the top 25 in both polls,
but they have recovered, winning
four of their past five games.
Last week, the Golden Bears de
feated then-No. 18 Arizona, 24-16.
Shane Vereen, playing in place of star
tailback Jahvid Best, who is recover
ing from a serious concussion he sus
tained against Oregon State, posted a
career-high 159 rushing yards on 30
carries and a touchdown. The Cal de
fense held the Wildcats to 274 yards
of total offense, an average of only
four yards per play and intercepted
Arizona sophomore quarterback
Nick Foles twice.

Overall, Cal is ranked first in the
Pac-10 in rush defense, allowing only

3.1 yards per carry. Junior linebacker
Mike Mohamed leads the confer
ence in tackles.

"Right now it looks like we're
gonna have our hands full and a great
challenge with this Cal team," Har
baugh said. "They have an identity on
both sides of the ball, offensively and
defensively, special teams, they're
very impressive to watch, ft will be a
big challenge for our offense."
"I think Cal has got the best de
fensive front that we've faced all
year," he added. "Tyson Alualu is the
best defensive lineman in the Pac-10,
they've got great linebackers,
[Devin] Bishop, [Mike] Mohamed,
[Mychal] Kendrix all those guys,
they've got an identity defensively."
The Cal defense will have a tough
test when it faces Stanford's prolific
offense, which leads the Pac-10 with
almost 450 total yards per game.
Much of that success is due to senior
tailback Toby Gerhart, who is cur
rently third in the nation in rushing
yards with 1,395 yards in 10 games.
He averages 5.3 yards per carry and
leads all running backs with 19 rush
