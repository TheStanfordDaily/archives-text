# A 						House Divided

### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG 
Given that the tree and the bear are nat
ural enemies, what happens when the
two are bred of the same blood? As
Big Game day nears, such is the dilem
ma of families across the country.
Despite the irony of the situation, it is not uncom
mon for families to boast split allegiances to
Stanford and Cal, especially in the Bay Area.
Charbel Farhat, professor and chairman of
Stanford's Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics, graduated from UC-Berkeley and
married a Cal alumna. To further complicate mat
ters, his daughter Alix Farhat 'l3 is a freshman on
the Stanford cheer squad.
"As much as I speak very favorably of Cal, I
have to say that my allegiances are with Stanford
now," Charbel said. "I'm a faculty here, I work with
the students here, I'll be sitting in the Stanford sec
tion, and now my daughter is on the cheerleading
team, so you can't expect me to be cheering for
Cal."
This year, Charbel and his wife intend to find an
alternative solution to their family's unique schisms
designing their very own Big Game attire.
"They're going to be making two shirts," Alix
explained. "On one of them, it's going to say 'my
money, my education, etc.' and the other is going to
have a Stanford-Cal checklist, so it'll be like, 'I grad
uated from: Cal. My husband teaches at: Stanford.
Our money went to: Cal and Stanford. My daugh
ter cheers at: Stanford.'"
The clash of the primary colors Stanford car-

dinal red versus Cal blue and yellow plays out
not only in parent-offspring relationships, but also
between siblings.
According to sisters Tamara Alexander 'lO and
Taleen Alexander, who graduated from Cal in 2007,
Stanford-Cal competition hardly afflicts their rela
tionship. Even so, Big Game introduces minor
logistical issues.
"When it's Big Game week, we're always like,
'Where are our parents going to sit?"' Tamara
laughed. "Before, when Cal was better at football,
[our parents] were like, 'We're going to sit on the
Cal side,' and this year they're like, 'We're going to
sit on the Stanford side.'"
"I don't think there's much tension between us,"
she continued. "It's more of a joke, but I do have a
'Cal Sucks' shirt and [Taleen] gets mad when I wear
it."
The dividing line between Stanford and Cal is
not so clear-cut in all families. Sometimes, Big
Game rivalry extends beyond the immediate fami
ly of parents, children and siblings.
Take Matt Caselli 'O7. Almost everyone in his
family belongs to either the tree or bear lineage.
His mom, sister (Features desk editor Caroline
Caselli), aunt, uncle and several cousins attended
Stanford. His dad, uncle and two great-grandpar
ents graduated from Cal. His grandmother is an
alumna at both schools.
What's more, Matt lived in Alameda throughout
his childhood, a 15-minute drive from Berkeley.
"I more or less grew up a Cal fan," he recalled.
"I remember sort of being confused as a kid, more
at basketball games than at football games, because

[my parents] would dress me up, and I'd be wearing
a Stanford sweatshirt and a Cal hat. All sorts of
people would be yelling at me, but it was a healthy
competition and a healthy rivalry. It never got
nasty."
Now two years out of college, Matt looks for
ward to avenging Stanford's six losses out of the
past seven Big Games.
"During my four years at Stanford, I never got
to see us win Big Game, so I'm glad to see the suc
cesses right now," he said. "I can finally rub it into
all of those Cal family members' faces."
Brittany Margot 'l3 also grew up surrounded by
Stanford-Cal rivalry. This year, her family is divided
by gender; she and her mom will be rooting for
Stanford while her stepdad and brother will cheer
for Cal.
"We have a huge flag in our living room that
says 'House Divided,' and it is half Stanford, half
Cal," she described. "I'd say it's much more of a
topic to poke fun of one another, so when the other
team loses really badly, then they deserve to have
some dirt thrown their way."
Even though the collegiate conflict within her
family remains fairly lighthearted, Brittany doesn't
imagine the rivalry will dissipate anytime soon.
"No matter where my brother goes to graduate
school, he will hold onto that undergraduate Cal
pride until the day he dies," she said, nodding
assuredly. "He's definitely a bear, and I'm definite
ly a color and a tree."
