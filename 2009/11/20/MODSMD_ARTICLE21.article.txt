## JOURNEY TO THE DESERT Cardinal faces Arizona schools in final road trip 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
After hosting the Oregon
schools, the No. 6 Stanford
women's volleyball team travels
south to Arizona to take on No. 18
Arizona and unranked Arizona
State. The Cardinal enters the
weekend in a three-way tie for first
place in the Pac-10, so this weekend
will be crucial for the conference
title race.
"We had a great weekend, we
worked very hard for two wins and
improved a lot throughout the
whole week," said Head Coach
John Dunning.
Last weekend, the Card sought
revenge on Oregon for the Ducks'
five-set victory over Stanford last
month. The second time around
was much more successful for the
Cardinal, who swept the Ducks Fri
day night at Maples Pavilion. Ju
nior hitter/setter Cassidy Lichtman
dominated with 16 kills, 14 assists
and seven digs while junior outside
hitter Alix Klineman added 14 kills
and 10 digs. Still chasing the record
books, junior libera Gabi Ailes
contributed 22 digs.
The following night, Stanford
trumped Oregon State 3-0, holding
the Beavers under 20 points in each
set: 25-18, 25-18, 25-19. Stanford
has now won all 50 meetings with
Oregon State. Klineman was a
force with 13 kills, five digs and two
aces. Lichtman had a double-dou
ble with 14 kills and 10 digs while
Janet Okogbaa hit .429 that night.
Early leads in each set helped
the Card jump to quick victories
and finish the weekend on top.
"Everyone is excited to be in
control of our own destiny in terms
of the Pac-10," Dunning said. "We
worked hard this week and are
ready to go on the road."
Around the Pac-10, UCLA's
loss to Washington also helped
keep Stanford in the race, as the
Huskies and Bruins join the Cardi
nal with four conference losses.
Washington, 11-4 in the confer
ence, still has to face Washington
State and the Oregon Schools.

UCLA, 10-4, will see the Oregon
and Arizona schools over the next
two weekends.
Stanford, 11-4 in the conference,
still has to face off against the Ari
zona schools and California.
Last weekend, Arizona capital
ized over Arizona State in a 3-0
win. While they sit in the middle of
the Pac-10, the Wildcats have hard
hitters in Whitney Dosty, Courtney
Karst and Tiffany Owens. The trio
registered 14, 11 and 11 kills, re
spectively, last weekend.
'Arizona is a very tough team to
beat at home," Dunning said. "They
also have a lot at stake in terms of
the playoffs. This will be a great
match, exciting and hard fought by
both teams."
Arizona has only two losses at
home this season to UCLA and
Washington so the Cardinal will
have its work cut out.
In its last meeting against the
Wildcats, Stanford was similarly
the sixth-ranked team and tied for
first place in the Pac-10 with Wash
ington. Stanford swept Arizona 3-
0, with Klineman and Okogbaa
leading the offensive drive.

also beat the Sun Devils 3-0. While
Arizona State has not had quite the
consistency that Arizona does, the
team has pulled off upset victories.
"Arizona State beat UCLA on
their home court earlier this season
that means they are capable of
beating anyone," Dunning said. "We
will expect them to play great de

fense as they always do and we need
to stop Sarah Reaves better than the
last time."
While ASU's Reaves was shut
down by Arizona last weekend, she
still led her team offensively with
eight kills and nine digs. Teammate
Cat Highmark boasted 27 assists
against the Wildcats.
Opening serves are set for 7 p.m.
