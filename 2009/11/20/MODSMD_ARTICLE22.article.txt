# RIDING THE WAVES
## Stanford women punish Pepperdine in home opener 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off a pair of solid victories on the
East Coast to start the season, the Cardinal re
turned to the Farm in top form Thursday night,
kicking off its home season with a 99-50 win
over Pepperdine. Five players posted double
digit point totals for the No. 2 Cardinal (3-0),
led by junior forward Kayla Pedersen's game
high 22 and junior guard Jeanette Pohlen's 20.
Despite the lopsided final score, the game's
first few minutes were characterized by an
even, back-and-forth style of play. Stanford
exchanged the lead with the Waves (2-1) four
times in as many minutes to begin the game,
but it didn't take much longer for the Cardinal
offense to take control of the tempo.
After going down 13-11 on an Alex Jarrell
lay-up, the Cardinal attack came on strong as
Stanford took off on a 31-3 run to make the
score 42-16. Pohlen had five straight points in
the midst of the outburst, while Pederson
added seven of her own during the run.
Stanford Head Coach Tara VanDerveer,
getting her 24th season at the Farm underway,
was pleased with the contributions from all
around the court.
"Overall, our starting rotation played real
ly well," VanDerveer said. "Kayla [Pedersen]
came out and she's been playing great, knock
ing down perimeter shots and playing defense,
Jayne [Appel] has been doing great for us,
Jeanette [Pohlen] has been stepping up big
and making big shots, and JJ [Hones] came in
and played well for us too."
As Stanford's offense set the tone for the
game, Pepperdine could do little to stop the
bleeding. The Waves had zero blocked shots
compared to Stanford's eight, 33 rebounds
compared to Stanford's 50, and had four play-

ers with three personal fouls, all drawn on Car
dinal scoring opportunities.
It didn't help that Stanford was on top of its
shooting game, making 63.5 percent of its at
tempts on the night. JJ Hones was a perfect
six-for-six from the field, while Pedersen and
Pohlen were a combined 16-for-22 inside the
arc and 7-for-ll on three-pointers. Nnemkadi
Ogwumike added 14 points of her own with a
6-for-9 night.
"I think we were just hitting the open per
son tonight," Pedersen said. "My teammates
found me, and there were a lot of easy baskets.
We had 22 assists, we all had a lot of assists and
I think we all worked in the flow of the offense
and looked for each other."
Pepperdine, meanwhile, was held to rela
tively low-percentage shots by a stubborn
Cardinal defense and an ever-increasing point
deficit. By game's end, the Waves had shot a
combined 25.3 percent from the field.
"Stanford's so big, and they use that
they clog up the middle," said Pepperdine
