## Men cruise in first round, face UC-Irvine next 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On a freezing-cold night at Cagan Stadium,
Stanford beat Saint Mary's in the opening round of
the NCAA Tournament in its first appearance since
2002.
Both teams came into this match looking strik
ingly similar in their statistics. They had each
notched 10 wins over the regular season, had scored
some important wins over highly ranked opposi
tion, and their head coaches, Bret Simon for the
Cardinal and Adam Cooper for the Gaels, had won
Coach of the Year in their respective conferences,
the Pac-10 and the West Coast Conference.
But perhaps most importantly, both Stanford
(11-5-2,4-4-2 Pac-10,1-0 NCAA) and Saint Mary's
(10-4-5, 6-3-3 WCC) were playing their first-ever
games in the NCAAs.
Yes, Stanford has been here before, and yes,
Simon even took the Cardinal to the College Cup
six years ago, but not one single player on either
squad has made it this far before. The Gaels were
obviously pleased, and perhaps a little nervous, to
make it to the first NCAA game in their history, but
even the experienced coaching staff of the Cardinal
approached this as a new proposition.
"We weren't sure how we would react as a
group," Simon said. "We were trying to look for

things in the last training sessions and the warm-up
and the pre-game meal to gauge whether the team
was nervous or was approaching it in a different
way."
Perhaps this explains the first few minutes of the
game. Neither team took any hold on the match,
with scrappy passes that hung in the air, allowing
possession to change constantly.
High, long balls do not suit the style of Stanford's
players, and once the nerves had begun to settle,
they started passing quickly and accurately along
the ground, keeping possession and eventually out
shooting the Gaels 12-3 in the first half.
Recently nominated to national first team all
rookie by TopDrawerSoccer.com, freshman Adam
Jahn was the first on the score sheet with a stunning
left-footed volley, and further made his mark on the
match by setting up junior Dominique Yahyavi for
the second. True to the team ethic, though, he re
fused to take the credit.
"We just work for each other," Jahn said. "No
one's more important than the other, and we will
not succeed if we don't stay as a team."
The final score line, which included sophomore
Adoni Levine's first goal this year in the 81st
minute, shows how far the Cardinal has come this
year. In fact, the game itself offers a snapshot of
the season so far: a slightly shaky start gave way to
a steady progress and now a prospect for future

success.
"We had a little rocky start, pre-season," Jahn
said. "I think we all just bounced back and we just
realized we had the potential to be a great team, and
once we started getting wins the confidence kept
going up.
"We're peaking right at the right time now," he
added.
Saint Mary's battled hard, especially after the
first goal, but could not wrestle itself back into the
game. Although the Card deserves credit for keep
ing the Gaels out of contention for much of the
match, playing without the experience and leader
ship of possibly their best player, junior Jordan
Rider, WCC Defensive Player of the Year, certainly
had an impact on Saint Mary's.
"Technically, we weren't as sharp on the ball as
we have been," Cooper said. "Part of that was some
nerves, part of that was Stanford doing a good job

GAME NOTES: Stanford easily defeated Saint Mary's in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament. The Cardinal must now
travel to Irvine to play the No. 1 7 Anteaters, who had a bye
in the first round. If Stanford pulls the upset, it will likely
match up with No. 1 overall seed Akron in the next round.

disrupting our rhythm."
After a strong year, the Gaels can
return home with their heads held
high.
"Even though we didn't win
today, it gave all of our guys a taste of
the tournament and a hunger for
them to get back next year."
Meanwhile, the Cardinal now
must look forward to Sunday's game
against No. 16 seed UC-Irvine in
Irvine. A win there would put them
through to face undefeated. No. 1
seed Akron in the third round. But
Irvine will not be a pushover.
In their last regular season game,
the Anteaters defeated UC-Santa
Barbara, ranked No. 10 by the
NSCAA, 4-1 on the road to take the
Big West Tournament title.
Sunday's game will kick off at 6
p.m.
