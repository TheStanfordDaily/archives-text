### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It will be a Cardinal-Golden Bear
showdown this weekend at the Avery
Aquatic Center as No. 2 Cal takes on
No. 3 Stanford. Cal is currently on a
nine-game winning streak, while Stan
ford is emerging from a bitter loss last
weekend against No. 1 USC.
The Trojans edged out an overtime
win over Stanford last Saturday in Los
Angeles. Now the Cardinal needs to
defeat the Golden Bears this weekend
in order to solidify its spot in the na
tional championship tournament.
However, if the Cardinal loses this Sat
urday, it will need a strong showing in

GAME NOTES: No. 3 Stanford will try to end its
season on a positive note when it takes on
No. 2 Cal in the Big Splash. The Cardinal is
coming off a tough 13-12 overtime loss at
No. 1 USC. Stanford's only loss before the
USC game was to the Golden Bears last
month as part of the UCI Invitational.

on to the national championship
tournament.
Since 2004, the Cardinal has not
won the MPSF Championship, but
has been forced to watch its Califor
nia neighbors steal the title. Since
then, USC has won three MPSF
Championships in 2005, 2007 and
2008, and UCLA changed the pace
by winning the MPSF Champi
onship in 2006.
Right now, the Cardinal seems to
be determined to win the MPSF
Championship and even the NCAA
Championship.
"If we win this weekend, it will
put us in second place," said senior
utility Janson Wigo.
Stanford has not won the NCAA
Championship since 2002 and its
main goal is to bring the title back to
The Farm.
"Getting second place in MPSF
will help us a lot in the long run,"
Wigo said.
First, however, the Cardinal will
have to do well this weekend
against Cal, who is coming to The
Farm after an astonishing 15-4 beat
down against No. 13 Santa Clara.
The Bears scored 12 straight goals
against the Broncos to secure the
victory. Senior captain Spencer
Warden scored three goals in a row
during the first period and six over
all. He currently has 132 career
goals in 108 career matches, so the

Cardinal needs to watch out for
him.
Currently, the home team seems
to be focused on defending the op
posing attack.
"We need to work on our five
on-six defense," Wigo said.
Although the Cardinal lost in
Los Angeles this past weekend,
players such as senior goalkeeper
Jimmie Sandman played extremely
well and will hopefully keep it up
for the Big Splash on Saturday.
Also, freshman driver Paul
Rudolph and Wigo each scored an
impressive four goals.
Last year, the Cardinal was vic
torious over its rival, defeating Cal
9-8 in a tight game.
"Last time we played them, they
scored a lot of goals from the two
meter man and we are working real
ly hard with our two-meter guard to
prevent that this year," Wigo said.
With the Big Game around the
corner and Stanford students ready
to beat Cal in just about every
event, from blood drives to canned
food drives to sporting events, the
Cardinal should be receiving im
mense support.
The hype throughout campus
and Stanford's home court advan
tage should set the Cardinal up for a
win.
"We know we are better than
Cal already, so we know this will
only help us," Wigo said.
The Big Splash will begin at 2
p.m. at the Avery Aquatic Center.
