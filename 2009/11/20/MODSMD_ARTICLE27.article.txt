Admit it although life here at Stanford is pretty sweet, you can't deny that you miss the
comforts of home. Even if you only mildly enjoy it, being home with friends and family
while stuffing your face with turkey and other goodies is undeniably a much-needed treat.
Since the coming week is supposed to be a time of appreciation and thanks, we here at
Intermission thought we would share some reasons why we are thankful to be at Stanford, this
year in particular.

Unless you were living under a rock last week, I'm sure you heard that we beat USC. Can
we just collectively reflect on that for a minute? We kicked their ass, 55-21! Beyond simply beat
ing them, that is the highest amount of points USC has ever surrendered in its entire history. With
this win, we remain contenders for the Pac-10 title. Stanford pride is now abundant; you can feel
it in the air. Thanks to Luck, Gerhart and our incredible offensive line, we, the Cardinal, can
approach Big Game with overwhelming confidence. Watch out Golden Bears . . . it's hunting sea
son.

Let me explain this one before you get all freaked out and stop reading Intermission.
Because we are on the quarter system, it works out at Stanford that we complete all of our exams
prior to leaving for winter break. This setup means that we are able to entirely enjoy the break,
free from the stress of oncoming examinations. Our friends at other universities with semesters,
such as Harvard, take their exams and finish classes after they return from winter break. How
much does that suck? Can you imagine studying for an exam and finishing papers while you
party it up with friends and family? Well, you don't need to.

Believe it or not, I have a lot of friends who are thankful for the outbreak of swine flu. If
you stayed up too late the night before or you simply need a day off, just write an e-mail claiming
you feel ill. I swear I don't support this deceit, but it is now easier than ever to skip class.
Everyone is so afraid of getting sick that they don't want to risk it. Because everyone is so para
noid, less people are coming to class sick, which results in less spreading of illness all around.
And for those of us who have actually yet to get sick, be thankful for that too!
