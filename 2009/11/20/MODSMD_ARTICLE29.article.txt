# Phenomenal Phish

How many bands can put on a multi-day festival in the
middle of nowhere, with no other bands playing and
have tens of thousands show up anyway? Not many,
but there's only one band that would Phish. So on
Halloween weekend, a horde 40,000 strong descended on the
Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif, to spend three glorious days
with the benevolent rulers of improvisational rock.
Anticipation was running high; the band just reunited
in March after breaking up in 2004. Festival 8 would feature
eight sets of Phish, including a revival of the Halloween
"musical costume" tradition, in which Phish covers an entire
album by another band. Past musical costumes have paid trib
ute to The Beatles ("White Album"), The Who
("Quadrophenia"), The Talking Heads ("Remain in Light")
and The Velvet Underground ("Loaded"). This time, Phish
released a list of 99 possible albums, which they gradually
killed off in the weeks leading up to Halloween, until eight
remained.

f he Halloween Set
Before Phish took the stage on Saturday night, the
enormous screens on either side of the stage prefaced the set
with an audiovisual mash-up of all 99 albums that had been
considered. Near the end, the appearance of a smirking Mick
Jagger confirmed that Phish would be treating us to The
Rolling Stones' "Exile on Main Street." Trey Anastasio (gui
tar), Mike Gordon (bass), Page McConnell (keys) and Jon
Fishman (drums) enlisted the aid of a hom section and back
up singers to help preserve the feel of the Stones' classic,
although superior musicianship allowed them to breathe new
life into the tracks and take them to places the Stones never
could. Chris Kuroda, Phish's longtime lighting guru, took the
experience to the next level. Not content with his impressive
array of stage lights, Kuroda rigged up 140 palm trees that
encircled the concert field and incorporated them into the light
show.

Highlights of the set included "Tumbling Dice," "Torn
and Frayed" and "Loving Cup." "Dice" opened up into an
ecstatic jam and during "Loving Cup," the crowd responded to
the line "what a beautiful buzz" with an unprecedented flurry
of glowsticks. Many are calling this "Loving Cup" one of the
best versions ever played by any band, Rolling Stones includ
ed. Anastasio and Co. finished strong with "Soul Survivor."

The album's final cut featured great vocals from McConnell,
who simultaneously attended to his fortress of keyboards and
Jones, who brought a bit of gospel to the California desert.

It would have been easy for the eighth and final set of
the weekend to disappoint demanding phans (when possible,
Phish fans replace "f' with "ph"). The masterful cover of
"Exile" and the well-executed third set that extended the
Halloween revelry set the bar high for Sunday's festival-clos
er. Anastasio unleashed the opening riff of an expansive
"Tweezer" in a fitting beginning to the hardest-rocking set of
the weekend. Lighting man Kuroda bathed the crowd in a
bright menagerie of color and fire blasted forth from the blow
torch-like structures behind us. Gordon's slinky bass line and
Fishman's relentless hi-hat signaled the onset of "Maze," and
their patient build-up propelled us into the frenetic chorus.
The boys blew the set wide open with "Mike's Song," which
lit a fire under the bobbing masses. Phish might be the best
band ever at creating tension and release in the live setting
and the monstrous jam that followed was compelling enough
to disrupt control over bodily functions. After the intergalactic
funk of "2001," they brought it all back home with "Slave to
the Traffic Light," a dynamic song that captures the essence of
Phish as well as any one song could. During the encore, the
band sent everyone home with an infectious "Tweezer
Reprise."
Phish represents the pinnacle of ambition in live
music. Like the Grand Canyon, everyone should see them at
least once.
