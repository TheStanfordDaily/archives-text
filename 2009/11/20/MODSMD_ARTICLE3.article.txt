# BAY BATTLE, TAKE TWO
## Cardinal has rematch with local rival Santa Clara in playoffs 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford women's soccer
team may be playing in the national
championship tournament, but
tonight's Sweet Sixteen match will be a
local affair, as the Card takes on
Peninsula rival Santa Clara University
for a spot in the national quarterfinals.
The game is a rematch of this sea
son's earlier South Bay derby, which
took place at Santa Clara's Buck Shaw
Stadium back on Oct. 1. Although the

Broncos took the lead early in that
game, the Cardinal ended up with a
dominating 6-2 victory, with forwards
Kelley O'Hara and Christen Press
each notching two goals and an assist.
The rout was eerily similar to the 2008
matchup between the two teams, also
at Buck Shaw Stadium, in which Stan
ford stormed to a 5-0 win.
Despite his team's recent success
against SCU, however, Stanford Head
Coach Paul Ratcliffe knows that this

will be a completely new challenge.
"I've seen them play [since the
match in October], and I think, like
us, they've grown as a team," Rat
cliffe said. "[Santa Clara Head
Coach] Jerry Smith is a good coach,
and they're playing good soccer, so it
should be a really competitive
match"
The Cardinal (22-0-0, 9-0-0 Pac
-10) comes into the match on the
strength of back-to-back 2-0 victo
ries, although neither match in the
first two rounds was easy. Last Thurs
day, Stanford beat Northern Arizona
despite a frustrating first half in
which it did not score. On Saturday, it
faced a nervous second half against a
physical BYU team before finally
putting the game away in the 89th
minute.
BYU in particular seemed to
knock Stanford off its usual rhythm,
with the Card struggling to keep pos
session and resorting to long ball tac
tics. While Ratcliffe and the players
emphasized how important it was to
be able to win in a different style, it is
clear that they would like to be able
to use the game plan they have relied
upon throughout the season and in
seasons past.
"We definitely want to play pos
session soccer," Ratcliffe said. "The
BYU [match] was a real physical
battle ... I think in the playoffs
things get a little tense, so we've got
to settle down, play with confidence
and enjoy it and open up the game."

Santa Clara (14-6-2) the four
seed in Stanford's region by no
means had an easy road to the Sweet
Sixteen either. After a 0-0 draw for
90 minutes against Michigan State, it
took an overtime goal to get the
Broncos out of the first round, and
their second round matchup with
Oklahoma State saw them go
through on penalty kicks after regu
lation and two overtimes failed to
separate the teams at one goal
apiece.
Still, Santa Clara can be very
tough to beat; in a narrow 1-0 loss to
No. 2 Portland at the beginning of
November, SCU actually outshot
the Pilots 14-7. Interestingly, Port
land is the only team averaging more
goals per game than Stanford this
year, so the Bronco backline certain
ly seems to have improved since the
6-2 thrashing by the Cardinal.
Stanford's defense has also im
proved immensely throughout the
year and could get another boost this
weekend. Senior fullback Ali Riley,
who missed last weekend's matches
with an ankle injury, and sophomore
defensive midfielder/utility player
Cami Levin, who had to leave the
BYU game after a crunching tackle,
could both be ready for tonight's
clash.
"They're both talented players,
but [on game day we have to ask] are
they healthy enough and physically
prepared?" Ratcliffe said. "And if
they're not, we have other great op
tions."
The Cardinal does indeed have
great depth, and all of those players
must be ready to play a role during
this do-or-die stretch run. Even so,
Ratcliffe says he does not believe his

team is feeling the pressure as it pre
pares to put its season on the line
once again.
"We're just excited to be able to
continue to train," he said. "We're
working hard to just take care of
business and have fun."
The match is scheduled to kick off
at 7 p.m. at Cagan Stadium.
