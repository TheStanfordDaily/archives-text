One hour north of The
Farm is a small gem
with a big sound. On
a hilltop overlooking the
Golden Gate Bridge and the
Pacific Ocean is the
California Palace of the
Legion of Honor museum. If
you drive up the hilltop, amid
the stunning views, at 4 p.m.
on a Saturday or Sunday, you
will likely hear the thunder
ing sound of a Cesar Franck
masterwork or George
Gershwin show tune.
If you forego the exhi
bition of fine Carrier jewelry
and instead travel inside the
museum's Rodin Gallery,
there stands an 85 year-old
organ.
The Skinner Organ is
not just any organ, however.
The Ernest M. Skinner Organ
Company in Boston con
structed its 4,500 pipes in
conjunction with the architec
ture of the Legion of Honor
museum in 1924. The pipes
were built through the walls
of the museum and reach
through its untraveled attic
spaces.
"I've worked here for
two years and I've never been
up here!" said one Legion of
Honor employee, as we
crawled through along the
attic walkway, ducking under
arched stairways.
In the attic, you can
see the metal tops of what

look like a garden of pipes.
The smallest pipe is one-half
of an inch and the longest is
32 feet. Nearby are cymbals,

snare drums and other unusu
al instruments that are at the
control of the organist, seated
dozens of feet below in the
Rodin Gallery.

On Saturdays and
Sundays, music lovers can
enjoy a free 45-minute con
cert in the museum's outdoor
Court of Honor or pay admis

sion and enjoy the music
while perusing the exhibits.
When one of the
museum's organists, Robert
Gurney, 57, played a

Gershwin piece, the sound
exploded alive in the outdoor
courtyard. At least three high
pressure turbines are the soul
of the organ's loud acoustic

sound.
"One, the big one, is
behind these chambers over
here," said Ed Stout. "It
stands six feet tall and the

total horse power is about 45
horse power to provide the
wind for this organ."
Stout, 75, is the organ
curator at the museum and is

in responsible for maintaining
and tuning the organ. He
explains that the museum's
Skinner organ was carefully
and theatrically built to play a

versatile range of music.
Stout says that the original
intention of building the
organ in the museum was to
constantly have music play

ing while visitors enjoyed the
art.
It was an early win
dow-shopping music loop, if
you will, but it wasn't stale
and unoriginal like the eleva
tor music one might associate
with the background noise we
hear today. This background
music was intended to be
grand and dramatic, like the
organ itself.
Stout hopes that visi
tors can enjoy the range of
music that the museum organ
can display in the large
acoustic heaven that is the
Rodin Gallery.
"I think that a great
deal of damage has been done
to the popularity of the organ
over the last 40 years by it
being so limited," Stout said.
"Because the organ, let's face
it. . . the organ is not consid
ered an essential part or piece
of equipment for a church
these days."
Stout has also worked
with churches to help main
tain their traditional organs
and was the curator of the
organ at Grace Cathedral in
San Francisco before coming
to the Legion of Honor muse
um. He said, "I'm in my 76th
year and have no intentions
of retiring. There are too
many people to annoy."
