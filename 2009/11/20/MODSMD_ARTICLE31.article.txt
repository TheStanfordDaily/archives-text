Eight strong actors managed
to transform the Nitery
Theater into a prison cell
last weekend with STAMP'S fall
performance of "The
Exonerated."
The show, put on by the

Stanford Theatre Activist
Mobilization Project (STAMP),
focused on the stories of six men
and women who were sentenced
to death row and later exonerated.
Each narrative is a powerful tes
tament to the inadequacy of our
criminal justice system, as well
as the blatant racism and classism
that prevent innocent men and
women from being free. The
audience members were given

pamphlets providing a history of
the death penalty, as well as argu
ments for and against it, and each
performance was followed by a
discussion with various local
death penalty experts.
This brand of student the
ater is typical for the Stanford
Theatre Activist Mobilization
Project, a group whose mission is
"to create theatre to educate and

mobilize people for progressive
and social change."
Founded in 2006, STAMP'S work
has been seen across the campus,
from promoting various student
groups' causes to putting on per
formances with political themes,

such as last weekend's show.
STAMP was recently featured on
National Public Radio's
"Morning Edition" for last year's
performance of "Out of Sight,
Out of Mind," based on several
anonymous monologues about
Stanford students' struggle with

various mental health issues.
Since STAMP perform
ances are often free, the audience
for last weekend's performance
got a lot of bang for literally no
buck. Directed by Kate Hyder
and Liesl Spitz, the show was
extremely engaging and also
quite moving. A bare light bulb
hung above each of the vignettes
as they were being performed,

lending a prisonlike quality to the
sparse set, an effective way to
instill empathy in the hearts of
the viewers. Although the block
ing at times made the storyline
hard to follow the script
bounces from one person's story

to the next rapidly the acting
was strong enough that the stories
were ultimately cohesive.
The most impressive per
formances of the night came from
Raine Hoover and Michael Vang.
Hoover portrayed the one woman
whose tale of death row was

included in the script, but she
outshined her male counterparts
with her ability to convey the
pain of being locked in a solitary
cell, waiting defenselessly and
hopelessly for her innocence to
be revealed.
Freshman Michael Vang's
STAMP debut was especially
strong. Each actor played several
roles, but Vang was most adept at

vacillating between a sadistic,
bigoted prosecutor and a soft
spoken religious teenager who
has been wrongly convicted of
killing a police officer. His per
formance as David Keaton was
particularly memorable, although

each character's story provided
much-needed insight into the
lives of the men and women sen
tenced to death row.
If you missed "The
Exonerated," but are intrigued by
the fusion of social activism and
good theater, you can see

STAMP'S next performance, "My
Name is Rachel Corrie," in the
Nitery this weekend.
