# MODERN WARFARE 5: IT'S LIKE THE FIRST ONE, ONLY BETTER

To put it simply, "Call of Duty: Modern
Warfare 2" is fantastic. Sure, the single
player could be longer and the graphics
could have been improved from the first one,
but as a whole, there is so much that this game
offers that the little issues just lose their signif
icance after the 10th straight hour of multiplay
er.
The plot revolves around a terrorist plot
to spark World War 111 between the United
States and Russia. As a result, half of the mis
sions in the game take place in suburbia, with
Russian artillery barreling through cookie-cut
ter houses and perfectly manicured houses. A
series of later missions in the middle of a war
field in Washington, D.C. sent chills down my
spine. While the plot twists usually don't make
much sense and character motivations are fick
le at best, the set pieces are even more impres
sive than the first game and, clearly, it doesn't
rest on the laurels of what made the first one
popular.
Unfortunately, the single player does
have its fair share of problems. First off, it is
ridiculously short. I beat it over the course of
two nights and that's only because I had to
stop to work on homework. It is a tiny mode
for such a blockbuster production. It also does
n't have the same level of immersion as the
last game. Because of this, the player doesn't
grow as attached to what is happening as in the
first game.
To counter this, the multiplayer and
Special Ops modes more than live up to expec
tations. Special Ops is a new co-op mode that
presents the player with one of 23 different
scenarios independent of the main campaign.
These range from escort missions to defending
a position to disarming bombs. These missions
are some of the highlights of the game and
with three different difficulty levels, offer plen
ty of replay value. There are also the unmatch

able multiplayer offerings. The set-up is sim
ilar to the last game, but with new tweaks to
guns and kill-streak rewards to make the
matches fairer. It isn't revolutionary, but with
such a strong foundation, there really wasn't
a need to be revolutionary with this iteration.
Regardless, you will be playing these modes
for months, if not years, to come.
From a technical perspective,
"Modern Warfare 2" is impeccable. The
sound, in particular, is absolutely fantastic.
Gunfire and grenades are appropriately
weighty, making you feel like you're actual
ly firing weapons. Character chatter during
missions is varied, entertaining and a wel
come relief from most games where you hear
the same five lines of dialogue over and over
again. The graphics could have used a bit of
an update though. While they are better than
"Modern Warfare" and are by no means
shoddy, they don't impress in the same way
as the first one did.
All in all, "Modern Warfare 2" is an
amazing package. It isn't perfect and may
not blaze a path like the first one did, but it
is one of the finest, most polished games you
will ever play in this console generation.
