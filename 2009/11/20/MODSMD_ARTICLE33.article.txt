For the average TV con
sumer (i.e. not me),
Thanksgiving Break
presents the perfect opportu
nity for catching up on all the
TV you've abandoned in
favor of frat parties and
MS&E problem sets. This
also applies to the person
who wants to protest Macy's
Day Parade without the cast
of Glee (i.e. me). You might
be surprised to learn that I, in
fact, love watching sports on
TV and fully support those
who choose to wear body
paint in their own homes and
watch athletes get paid mil
lions to work on holidays.
But, let's be honest, is there a
better way to bask in your
tryptophan high than lying in
your bed with your comput
er? No.
With all this in mind,
I offer you a list of the five
things you should be catching
up on this break:

. Parks and Recreation
This show has had a
Renaissance that would make
even Leonardo da Vinci jeal
ous. The writers have found a
way to develop the support
ing cast for Amy Poehler's
Leslie even stronger than that
of "The Office." Nick
Offerman as Ron is THE
highlight, but Aziz Ansari as
Tom dominates whatever
scene he's in. This is a show
where you're not catching up
for continuity going forward;
you're catching up because
you don't want to miss a sin
gle episode. You'll probably
get addicted to this one, as
Poehler's real life husband
Will Arnett of "Arrested
Development" fame has
signed on to guest star in
early 2010. He and Poehler
didn't get nearly enough
screen time on "Arrested
Development" when she
guest starred, so here's hop-

ing "Parks and Rec" gets it
right.
Ugly Betty
I know, I know, it's
"Ugly Betty" and you're
bored already. To be honest,
though, this season has so
much good stuff going on
that I think we should give it
a chance. Each character
finally has a sustainable and
mostly interesting character
arc; for example, I love Betty
pining after Matt, Matt being
kind of into Amanda and I'm
actually interested in what
happens to Daniel now that
cancer chick is dead!
Wilhelmina and YaYa
DaCosta of ANTM Cycle 3
fame are kind of a force as a
recast for Willy's daughter
and as a filial-duty-gone-awry
plot, to be sure. Betty, the
character and the show, are
maturing a lot, since episodes
can no longer revolve around
Betty being the butt of the
joke. I don't actually like
Betty's "pretty" makeover
because her glasses are kind
of too wide, but I'm certainly
intrigued.

Another groan from
the TV peanut gallery on this
one. Yes, "Dexter" kind of
shot itself in the foot last sea
son when Dexter married and
knocked up Rita. That aspect
of the show is still frustrating

and she's the second most
annoying wife on television
after Mrs. Shuester on "Glee"
(although she's five times
hotter and goes to Yoga on
Tuesday nights!). At work,
however, I like the parallel of
Dexter's search for the inner
Trinity, a serial killer played
by John Lithgow and the
homicide department's search
for plain old Trinity. I don't
like the former, because the
best part of the show has
always been Dexter's rela
tionship to the ritual and the
act, but the latter has provid
ed some good material for
Debra Morgan, Dexter's sis
ter who is played by his real
life wife. Deb freed herself of
that deadbeat informant, and
I, like her, miss Lundy a lot
since Trinity shot him. The
looming confrontation of the
two killers promises major
drama for the season finale,
so catch up to watch it almost
live!
Friday Night Lights
Stanford football has
compelled me to invest in this
show, which is in its fourth
season on HDTV right now
and will come to NBC in the
middle of next year. I'm only
halfway through the first sea
son, but damn it makes me
think twice about living in

Texas! The beauty of the
show and the people provide
a visual satisfaction that's
almost unique on television.
What's even more original is
the show's experimentation
with the narrative format.
Basically, Season One is near
perfection and pairs nicely
with the Stanford football
season. GO CARD!

. Top Chef
I vaguely remember
that last year there was a
great Thanksgiving episode
of "Top Chef," and I mean,
why wouldn't there be? I'm
not sure how that will work
with the small number of
contestants left, which sad
dens me deeply. The Las
Vegas setting has attracted
lots of famous names to this
season, much as a surprise as
that is to me. Although the
names don't mean anything
to me, they create a lot of
agony and stress for the one
remaining female contestant,
Jennifer, and thus make her
even more of the loveable
underdog. At the same time,
however, Kevin is a southern
comfort and Eli is the awk
ward and overconfident new
bie. And then there are the
Voltaggios: good cop and bad

cop; a black and white cook
ie; sweet and sour pork.
Michael swears and uses a lot
of Asian inspiration, while
Bryan is the boy you bring
home to dinner and then take
upstairs . . . But they never
made incestuous polygamy
look so good. And, to boot,
they're all talented chefs. The
legacy of Hosea will be
destroyed!
