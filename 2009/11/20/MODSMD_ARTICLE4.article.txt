## LEARNING FROM PAPA 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The 112 th Big Game will be quite a spectacle.
Both Cal and Stanford are well regarded, the
stakes are as high as the Rose Bowl and there's
a legitimate Heisman contender involved.
Cue the media invasion.
As reporters from across the nation descend on
the Farm, Greg Papa and his local Comcast TV show
Chronicle Live will move out of the studio and broad
cast their Friday episode live from Stanford's football
practice field at 5 p.m. in a rare, open-to-the-public
event.
Prior to sitting down with Cardinal legends Darrin
Nelson and Bob Murphy today on air, Papa spoke
with The Daily about the keys to Saturday's game.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What does each team
need to do in order to win?
Greg Papa (GP): The most important player in the
game is Kevin Riley, the Cal quarterback. He's got to
play at the high level he's played at early in the year
and in four of the last five when he's won, and not the
way he played against Oregon and USC back-to
back. When he plays well, they're typically a very
good offensive team, and when he doesn't, they strug
gle. So he's got to be on point because obviously Stan
ford's offense is state of the art and they're going to
score.
Cal can be up-and-down defensively, but they've
got some good corners. Syd'Quan Thompson is a
tremendous player. Even though he's a small guy, he'll
have a chance to play in the NFL and be a pretty good
player. He's a great tackier and a tough guy. Darian
Hagan on the other side is good, too, so it will depend
on what Cal defense shows up.
Stanford defensively has gotten much better as the
season has progressed. They were very poor early.
That loss to Arizona was a tough one, but I
think Riley is the key he has to be accurate
with the ball.

TSD: Jahvid Best has been declared out for
this game. Shane Vereen had a good game
against Arizona, but Jeff Tedford said that he
didn't want to overwork him and that would
be something they'd look at in practice.
Where do you see the Cal running game fac
toring in?
GP: They run the ball. Coach Tedford, even
though he's known for developing his quar
terbacks, runs the ball. Vereen is a tremen
dous back. Jahvid Best is special, he has a spe
cial skill with his breakaway speed and elu
siveness, but Vereen is almost as fast. They did
the 100 meters in high school, and they were
one and two. Jahvid was one-tenth of a second
faster. Vereen is an underrated back just be
cause Jahvid is so exciting, but Vereen is a
tremendous player. You'd like to have them
both because formationally, you could really
screw with people.
Whereas with Jahvid you can motion him
around, Vereen is really best in between the
tackles. He has breakaway speed and I think
they'll be fine in the short term with just one
back. Vereen is a guy who can carry it 25-30
times per game. So I think their running game
will be fine. Again, I think it comes down to
Cal being able to match Stanford offensively.
If the quarterback is on target, and Stanford
gives it up defensively, then it could go back
and forth and be a pretty exciting, high-scor
ing shootout.

TSD: Let's talk Cal's defense. They run a 3-4,
which is unusual at the collegiate level. Where
do you think that factors in, in terms of stop
ping Toby Gerhart?
GP: Typically, a 3-4 is not a great rush defense,
it's more a pressure-oriented defense. But Cal
has a lot of good linebackers. I think Stanford
will be able to run the ball. Their offensive line
is powerful and what they did against USC
was pretty impressive they ran over them
obviously, but they also ran right through
them. They'll be able to move it, they'll be
able to run it and they'll be able to throw it.
Stanford's offense is as good as any I've seen
at any level of football, college or pro. The
way they're humming right now and what
they do formationally, is so diverse. Everyone
wants to pigeonhole them as a power running
team and they can be. You can bring the full
back in and run the power play, or they can
spread it out and run it out of the gun with
Toby, or they can play action out of the Power-

I and this quarterback can throw it 60 yards
down field on point. Luck is a tremendous
player. He's the best pro prospect on the field.
Andrew Luck, he's just stupendous.

TSD: Elaborate a bit on Andrew Luck.Talk a
little bit about his progression throughout the
year and his standing both within the confer
ence, within the context of Stanford's offense
and nationally.
GP: He's fantastic. I think he's the best pro
prospect in college football. From what the
pro scouts tell me, whenever he comes out, he
will be the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, be it
after his sophomore year, junior year, senior
year it doesn't matter. If you went into a
laboratory to create a quarterback, you'd cre
ate him. He's 6'4", 235. He's smart not just
book smart, but football smart. He grew up
around his dad, who was a very good player.
You see it in the other sports and it really does
translate: if you're a second-generation ath
lete, you're born with a kiss of God that others
aren't, not just physically, but growing up
around it. This guy is one of the best quarter
back prospects in years. You can't even believe
he's a freshman. His body, his poise, his accu
racy both short and long he throws the post
as well as any quarterback in pro football.Tom
Brady probably throws it better, but there
aren't too many guys who can throw the deep
ball like he can. The footwork they ask him to
do he does not have a weakness that I have
seen. He is just a great player. Now, he is only
a freshman and the enormity of this game may
get to him a little bit, but he looks like he's too
good for it. He has too much skill. He's just a
tremendous prospect. Without question, the
NFL people are all over him.

TSD: A lot of the controversy this week was
centered around Coach Harbaugh and his de
cision to go for two. What do you foresee in
the coaching aspects for the game, from both
Jim Harbaugh and Jeff Tedford?
GP: They're both great coaches. They're dif
ferent. Tedford is an absolutely brilliant of
fensive mind. He can jump on a chalkboard
and captivate a room for a half hour. There's
nobody who knows more about offensive
football, from the passing game to the run
ning game. He's a football genius, he knows it
all. Jim is a bit more from the gut. He played
the position at a high level; he has a feistiness
in him. I would never see Coach Tedford go
for two at the end of the game, but that's Har
baugh's personality. He's not there to win a
popularity contest. He wanted to make a
statement to USC, and in particular, their

head coach, and he's made that statement
right from the start when he arrived. He stuck
his chest out and said that we're not bowing
down to anyone. I think he's backed it up. It
really meant that they weren't bowing to any
oneâ€” not today, not tomorrow, not in re
cruiting. You can make the argument that it
wasn't the classy Stanford thing to do, but I
don't think he was motivated by that. I think
he was there to stomp on them to the nth de
gree and keep stomping until he was done,
and you don't get a chance to do that too
often. He didn't know that they would score
the last touchdown to get to 55, so he wanted
to get to 50. That was the goal in his mind.

TSD: Stanford has been a great kickoff return
team, but has also been fantastic in kick cov
erage they're first in the conference, Cal,

by contrast, is not the best return team, nor
the best coverage team. Given Harbaugh's
emphasis on special teams and certainly D.J.
Durkin's emphasis on special teams, how
much of a role do you see that playing in Sat
urday's contest?
GP: That's potentially huge. That comes from
Harbaugh's background, not just his father,
but his brother was a tremendous special
teams coach in the NFL with the Eagles for
years. Even now in the NFL as a head coach,
he runs that side more than anything, so it's
not a surprise, Cal's punter is pretty damn
good, though. He hasn't had the year he want
ed to have, but he's got a powerful leg, so it's
tough to say that he won't just control the
game with his foot he is that good. But
Owusu is special. You saw the way the Ore
gon game started, with a big kick-off return. If

you give that offense room to start, you give it
a huge advantage. If you're Cal, you want to
pin them back and have them play a bit clos
er to the vest. But if they're out there at their
40, or your 40, you're in trouble.Then they can
give you everything. They may go the post im
mediately and try to score on the first play.
There are no limitations, so the combination
of Owusu and that offense is a deadly one.

TSD: Any sort of prediction? How's it going
to go? Can Stanford's defense continue to
force turnovers? Will Kevin Riley have a big
day?
GP: I think it's going to be high scoring. Stan
ford 42, Cal 35 is my bet.

GIULIO GRATTA/The Stanford Daily
Greg Papa of Chronicle Live believes Stanford redshirt freshman quarterback Andrew Luck will be the No. 1 overall pick whenever he leaves the Farm.
Papa also believes that the key to this year's Big Game will be not Luck, but Cal quarterback Kevin Riley, who will need a big game to beat the Cardinal.
