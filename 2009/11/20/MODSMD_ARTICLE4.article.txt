## LEARNING FROM PAPA 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The 112 th Big Game will be quite a spectacle.
Both Cal and Stanford are well regarded, the
stakes are as high as the Rose Bowl and there's
a legitimate Heisman contender involved.
Cue the media invasion.
As reporters from across the nation descend on
the Farm, Greg Papa and his local Comcast TV show
Chronicle Live will move out of the studio and broad
cast their Friday episode live from Stanford's football
practice field at 5 p.m. in a rare, open-to-the-public
event.
Prior to sitting down with Cardinal legends Darrin
Nelson and Bob Murphy today on air, Papa spoke
with The Daily about the keys to Saturday's game.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What does each team
need to do in order to win?
Greg Papa (GP): The most important player in the
game is Kevin Riley, the Cal quarterback. He's got to
play at the high level he's played at early in the year
and in four of the last five when he's won, and not the
way he played against Oregon and USC back-to
back. When he plays well, they're typically a very
good offensive team, and when he doesn't, they strug
gle. So he's got to be on point because obviously Stan
ford's offense is state of the art and they're going to
score.
Cal can be up-and-down defensively, but they've
got some good corners. Syd'Quan Thompson is a
tremendous player. Even though he's a small guy, he'll
have a chance to play in the NFL and be a pretty good
player. He's a great tackier and a tough guy. Darian
Hagan on the other side is good, too, so it will depend
on what Cal defense shows up.
Stanford defensively has gotten much better as the
season has progressed. They were very poor early.
