## More women go abroad Bing Overseas Studies Program admins can't pin-point exact cause for gender differences overseas 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
National averages show that more women
study abroad than their male peers, and
Stanford's Bing Overseas Studies Programs
(BOSP) has been no exception.
"Stanford reflects a national trend in study
abroad that has been this way for some time,"
said David Boyer, BOSP associate director.
The trend has long puzzled higher education
scholars seeking to balance numbers and get
more men overseas. But efforts to do so may be
futile before understanding the underlying
causes, say program administrators.
More Students Going Abroad
A record number of American students are
choosing to study abroad, and this number has
been on the rise over the past decade at the
University.
According to Boyer, Stanford sends about 50
percent of each graduating class overseas.
"Overall, we have more students going abroad
than just about any of our peers," he said.
In the 2005-06 academic year, 567 students
travelled to study in other parts of the world, yet
in 2008-09, administrators estimate that the
number has been significantly higher 907 stu
dents. In a national survey conducted by Open
Doors, an organization that reports on interna
tional education exchange, the University
ranked 16th in the country for the number of
students it sent abroad, higher than Brown and
Harvard.
Despite these rising numbers of students
going abroad, the percentage of female BOSP
participants still tips the scale and ratios have
remained consistent: approximately 59 percent
of those abroad at BOSP centers last year were
women.
Gender Imbalance Abroad a Symptom, Not a
Cause
BOSP Director Norman Naimark suggested
that no single factor could explain why more
women were traveling overseas during their
undergraduate careers.
"It's not an issue of women like to go abroad
and men don't, or women are more adventur
ous," he said. "It's a symptom of a whole series
of five or six other things."
But just what these unseen factors are
remains a puzzle in higher education research.
According to Naimark, the relatively limited
participation of males in overseas programming
is linked to the number of men in engineering
and sciences, and the tendency of these pro
grams to undervalue the merits of a quarter
abroad.

"Engineers and scientists think I don't
agree with them that they don't need to go
abroad and that's not important to their educa
tion," Naimark said.
Others have pegged the gender discrepancy
on the types of classes offered at many of the
University's centers abroad. BOSP's Paris and
Florence programs in particular offer curricu
lums saturated with arts and history classes,
which have largely attracted women.
International relations major Avery Brown 'll,

who is currently studying in Paris, noted in an e
mail to The Daily that there are not many classes
geared toward engineering and pre-med students.
"The classes are definitely not techy," she
wrote. "I think the pre-med and engineering stu
dents who are here are using this quarter as a
break from those classes."
Sara Cendejas 'll, also an international rela
tions major, is spending the quarter in Florence.
In an e-mail to The Daily, she said the program
is particularly appealing to "artistically-inclined
students."
"Florence has historically been an artistic
hub," Cendejas said. "As such, the classes defi
nitely have a more humanities and historic feel.
"Classes offered here are definitely more
suited for students in the social sciences," she
added.
If other programs throughout Europe do not
emphasize the needs of male engineers and sci
entists, the Berlin program, which has more men
than its counterparts, demonstrates a significant
contrast. Berlin offers paid internships in engi
neering as well as the option to take some core
engineering classes while abroad. This may be
better meeting the needs of male science and
engineering students, said Stanford in Berlin
Program Director Karen Kramer.
The Kyoto program, which was originally
designed for engineering students, also has a
larger portion of male students traveling
abroad.
"Perhaps it is not surprising that of the 35
students heading for Kyoto in spring 2010, 21
are males," Stanford in Kyoto Program Director
Andrew Horvat wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Plans to Drive Up Male Numbers Abroad?
National debates cited by The Chronicle of
Higher Education have made much wider
claims on how men and women respond differ
ently to their peers, parents and professors
when making decisions to study abroad.
Still, BOSP does not have plans to overhaul
its marketing strategies anytime soon, or to use
affirmative action for male students in its admis
sion process. In fact, Heidi Schuman, BOSP pro
gram and administrative associate, emphasized
the importance of driving up other types of
numbers that of athletes, scientists and engi
neers, for instance before addressing gender
discrepancy.
"Gender is not a big concern for us whatso
ever," Schuman said.
"There are so many things out of our con
trol," she added, suggesting that many of the dif
ferences seen between men and women in col
lege settings begin early on.
Nonetheless, Linda Campani, Stanford in
Florence program director, wrote in an e-mail
to The Daily that uncovering the reasons for the
lack of male participation in overseas studies
will be crucial toward bettering overseas pro
grams.
"It is only when we fully understand [gender
based differences] that we will be able to make
the changes necessary to turn study abroad into
an academic adventure equally attractive for
men and women alike," she said.

Still, BOSP does not have plans to overhaul
its marketing strategies anytime soon, or to use
affirmative action for male students in its admis
sion process. In fact, Heidi Schuman, BOSP pro
gram and administrative associate, emphasized
the importance of driving up other types of
numbers that of athletes, scientists and engi
neers, for instance before addressing gender
discrepancy.
"Gender is not a big concern for us whatso
ever," Schuman said.
"There are so many things out of our con
trol," she added, suggesting that many of the dif
ferences seen between men and women in col
lege settings begin early on.
Nonetheless, Linda Campani, Stanford in
Florence program director, wrote in an e-mail
to The Daily that uncovering the reasons for the
lack of male participation in overseas studies
will be crucial toward bettering overseas pro
grams.
"It is only when we fully understand [gender
based differences] that we will be able to make
the changes necessary to turn study abroad into
an academic adventure equally attractive for
men and women alike," she said.
