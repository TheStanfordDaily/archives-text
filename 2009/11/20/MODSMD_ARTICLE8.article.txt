# CAMPUS LIFE
## Free books ignite Darwin debate 
### ADAM COLE 
Hundreds of students, faculty and
staff were surprised Wednesday as
they were handed a free copy of
Charles Darwin's "The Origin of
Species." Opening the book, they
found an even bigger surprise: a new
forward written by Evangelical
Christian minister Ray Comfort that
attempts to refute the central tenets of
evolution.
Darwin's book, which outlines the
foundational ideas of evolution, was
first published in 1859. Over 150 years
later, Comfort and an organization of
1,200 volunteers distributed 170,000
books with the new forward at 100
American universities, including Yale,
UC-Berkeley and Harvard.
Bart McCurdy traveled from
Shasta County to distribute books on
campus. "There is really no proof of
Darwinian evolution as it is
explained, that something came from
nothing," he said. "It's a fairy tale,
"It almost takes more faith to
believe in evolution than it does to
believe that there is a God," McCurdy
added.
Thomas Hayden, a journalist and
lecturer in the earth sciences depart
ment, picked up a copy in the court
yard of the Jerry Yang and Akiko
Yamazaki Environment and Energy
Building. Hayden has lectured and
written widely on the evolution
debate and believed that the book
distribution was a publicity stunt.
"Opinions differ on whether
something like this is wrong and
goofy, or wrong and dangerous," he
said. "I think this is wrong and goofy."
"Comfort's writing is riddled with
numerous untruths, leaps of logic and
even plagiarism," claimed Lewis
Marshall, a graduate student in chem
ical engineering and the public rela
tions coordinator for Atheists,
Humanists and Agnostics at Stanford.
"It appears that he didn't even do
cursory research."
Marshall had planned to distribute
fliers alongside the books to provide
a counterpoint to Comfort's argu
ment, but book-distributing organiz
ers moved distribution up a day in

order to avoid conflict.
Still, McCurdy claims that he and
the 11 other volunteers who were on
campus welcome discussion on the
topic. "I look at both sides," he said. "I
hope others do, too.
"All I hope is that people at least
read it and at least they think about
it," McCurdy added. "We want to get
these books into the hands of people
who are going to be doctors, scien
tists, lawyers and politicians."
McCurdy said Comfort's Christian
message is more important than his
anti-evolution one. "The whole point
is to make God known," he said.
Meanwhile, Marshall thought
McCurdy and his volunteers should
have been open about this religious
message, "ft wasn't about having an
intellectual discussion about evolu
tion," Marshall said. "I think they
were deceptive in that sense."
Still, Marshall says the Comfort
introduction of the book has value.
"It's educational to see their point of
view," he said.
Hayden called the added introduc
tion "boring," claiming Comfort
rehashes arguments that have been
made for decades. Many of these argu
ments were made while Darwin was
alive, and the author addressed them
directly in his 150-year-old work.
"The most elegant refutations of
intelligent design are actually in 'The
Origin of Species,'" said microbiology
and immunology Prof. Robert Siegel.
At the same time, both men think
the book will have little impact on the
beliefs of Stanford students.
"The chance that [Comfort's intro
duction] survives the natural selec
tion of critical-thinking Stanford stu
dents is next to zero," Siegel said. "I
think Comfort knows full well it
won't go anywhere."
McCurdy said most students were
open-minded about receiving the
book. However, he said one student
who posed as a Comfort supporter
collected several books for himself,
then revealed himself as an atheist.
Marshall didn't support that kind of
response. "These people are entitled to
their freedom of speech; we're enti
tled to give our opposing view," he
said. "People can read both the
introduction and Darwin's work to
see which makes more sense."
Siegel agreed. "The key is not to
get people to believe," he said. "It's
to get people to think critically."
