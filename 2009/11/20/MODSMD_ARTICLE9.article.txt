# PALO ALTO
## New council members eye city debt 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Palo Alto City Council, the nine-mem
ber governing body of Stanford's neigh
boring suburb, added four non-incumbents
to its ranks in the November elections.
Among them were two UC-Berkeley
alumni, an accounting consultant and a
former transportation and planning com
missioner.
On Nov. 3, the citizens of Palo Alto
elected council newcomers Karen
Holman, Gail Price, Greg Scharff and
Nancy Shepherd, along with incumbent
and former Palo Alto Mayor Larry Klein.
These five beat out nine other candidates
for five open positions. They will be replac
ing Mayor Peter Drekmeier and John
Barton, who did not run for reelection, and
Vice Mayor Jack Morton and Yoriko
Kishimoto, who both termed out.
The highest vote earners, Klein and
Price, each won 13 percent of the vote. They
billed eliminating the budget deficit and fis
cal responsibility as their top priorities. In
their campaign platforms, the remaining
three elected candidates also highlighted
dealing with the tough economy.
When the candidates take office for
their two-year terms in January, the coun
cil's first agenda item will be dealing with
Palo Alto's large debt.
"We're looking at what we think is a $lO
million structural deficit, structural mean
ing long term," Klein said.
A graduate of Harvard Law School and
Cornell, Klein has served on the City
Council from 1981 to 1989 and 2005 to
present. He has been mayor in 1984, 1989
and 2008, and is married to Stanford educa
tion Prof. Milbrey McLaughlin.
To close the seven-percent deficit, Klein
originally proposed cutting the number of
city employees, reducing employee com
pensation and lastly, the passage of the
business license tax, Measure A.
"Another possibility, which we haven't
really focused on, and which I want to
avoid, is to reduce the amount of spending
on capital improvements and infrastructure
repair," he said.
The City Council may well have to
explore this option after 56 percent of vot
ers rejected Measure A, eliminating the
potential source of government revenue.
Price, also a supporter of the business
license tax, has emphasized practical eco
nomic development as the solution to the
city's financial woes.
"I think that economic development is a
key component of fiscal responsibility in
an economic recessionary period," she
said, "which is now."
Her focus on development is a logical
extension of her career in local and region
al planning. Price is the executive director
of the American Institute of Architects in
Santa Clara Valley and a member of the
American Institute of Certified Planners.
She has also served eight years on the Palo
Alto School Board.
Price and Scharff have expressed inter
est in exploring several new hotel propos
als for the area, such as the hotel develop
ment planned for the plot where Palo Alto
Bowl is located.
"It looks like Palo Alto will be getting
some new hotels, which plays a role in
stimulating local economy and creating a
new business climate," Scharff said.
But Scharff, unlike Price and Klein, was
against Measure A because he claimed the
tax would disproportionately harm small
businesses. Holman, on the Palo Alto
Planning and Transportation Commission
for eight years, also opposed the business
license tax.
Part of "restoring the public trust," one
of Holman's main priorities, was not
adding further strain on the retail commu
nity, according to an interview with the
Palo Alto Voice.
All candidates, however, shared similar
skepticism over the high-speed rail (HSR)
transportation plan.
"I think we need to have a vital trans
portation system, which means we need to
work closely with the Valley
Transportation Authority and the
Caltrain," Price said. "I'm a proponent of
high speed rail," but she added she had
some concerns with the engineering and
design of the project.
The rest of the candidates were more
opposed to the HSR project, particularly
its current planning state as an elevated
train system running through Palo Alto.
"I think an elevated train running
through the center of Palo Alto would be a
disaster for Palo Alto," Scharff said, tying
the HSR issue into the notions of preserv
ing a sense of community. "It would cut off
two parts of Palo Alto and be unattractive
and bad for the city."
Scharff and Klein, though against the
elevated plan, said they would still consid-
era below-ground HSR tunnel.
Closer to campus, the new City
Council members will work with
Stanford University on the hospital
expansion project for the Stanford
Medical Center. Price expects the
proposal to go through the council
next year.
In the nearer future, the council
members-elect will be focused on a
different aspect of Stanford life:

watching Big Game.
While Klein called the game 34-
17 Stanford, Price favored her alma
mater this Saturday. "Absolutely no
question," she said. "Go Bears."
But Scharff, who attended
Berkeley for one semester and is
married to a Cal alumna, admitted
Stanford would probably pull out a
win. "I have to tell the truth I
think Stanford [will win]," he said.
"Having lived in Palo Alto for 20
years, I must say I'm a Stanford
supporter at this time."
