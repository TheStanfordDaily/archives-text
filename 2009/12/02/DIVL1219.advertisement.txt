Stanford Continuing Studies presents
I am a writer who came from a
sheltered life. A sheltered life can he
a daring one as well. For all serious
daring comes from within.
Eudora Welty
Eudora Welty at 100
This year marks the 100 th anniversary of the birth of one
of America's finest prose writers, the incomparable Eudora
sVelty, a native and life-long resident of Jackson, Mississippi.
Welty's beautifully crafted, joyous, and wise stories, often
set in the South, cross the lines of color and class, offering
unforgettable portraits of a region and its people. She was
the author of ten collections of short stories, six novels,
and five books of literary criticism. Her many awards
include the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1973.
To celebrate, Continuing Studies has invited her biographer
and friend Suzanne Adarrs to talk about Welty and her
legacy. Marrs' 2005 biography, entitled simply Eudora
Welty , is regarded as the definitive life story.
Our evening celebration also features readings of some of
"Welty's most popular short stories ("Why I Five at the
P. 0.," "A Worn Path," ""Where Is the Voice Coming From?").
Special performances by Courtney Walsh, Aleta Hayes,
and Rush Rehm.
