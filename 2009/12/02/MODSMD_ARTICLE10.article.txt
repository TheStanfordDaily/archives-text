# HOUSING
## Greek life at Stanford largely unhoused 
### RYAN MAYFIELD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the majority of fraternities and
sororities operating without houses,
Greek life at Stanford refutes the stereo
type of purely residence-based Greek
organizations. While some un-housed
organizations hope to move toward
their own housing in the future, others
are content to remain in their current
un-housed state.

Of the 28 frats and sororities recog
nized by Stanford, only 10 chapters are
housed. The housing situation is by no
means permanent, however, and there
has been some fluidity in Greek housing
in the past.
"There was significant fraternity
turnover during the 1990s and early
2000s," wrote Nate Boswell, associate di
rector of Residential Education
(ResEd), in an e-mail to The Daily. "I be
lieve Theta Xi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Phi
Delta Theta, and Delta Tau Delta all lost
their houses."

According to Boswell, the University
treats housing as a "profound privilege"
that must be earned.

"In recent years, in the absence of a
robust review process, adherence to
housed Greek criteria has varied widely
from chapter to chapter," Boswell said.
"Moving forward [Greek organiza
tions] will need to regularly and actively
demonstrate their leadership and posi

tive campus contributions in order to re
tain housing," he added.
To enter the process for housing,
Greek organizations must submit pro
posals to ResEd and the Office of Stu
dent Activities and Leadership (SAL).
Boswell said housed criteria include "ef
fective stewardship," "student leader
ship plans," "contribution to the Resi
dential Education Mission," "adherence
to Student Housing policies" and "cam
pus service contribution."

There has been some interest ex
pressed by more fraternities and sorori
ties to have housing, according to
Boswell, although he did not specifically
indicate which groups these are.
Housing status has an effect on group
dynamics, and housed and un-housed
organizations appeal to different groups.
"All the girls that are in those houses
seem to love it," said Merit Webster 'lO,
president of the housed sorority Pi Beta
Phi. "To be in an organization where we
have a home base and a place of belong
ing, it's a nice thing. You get to know the
girls in the house by going to events to
gether, you see them, their good times
and their bad times when people are
stressed out and when they're celebrat
ing."

Another advantage of separate hous
ing is readily available meeting space. By
having their own space, housed Greek
organizations do not have to worry
about finding meeting locations.

Laura Hansen 'l2, a member of the
un-housed Chi Omega sorority, said the
lack of a single space can make planning
events challenging.
"It's probably harder to plan meet
ings and events logistically because we
have to reserve a room either in the
Quad (for meetings) or in one of the
girls' houses," she wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
On the other hand, having a resi
dence can restrict the size of the rush
class for housed Greek organizations, as
there are only so many spaces within a
fraternity or sorority house.
Not every member of a housed or
ganization is able to live in her or his re
spective Greek house due to capacity:
generally, sophomores are given prefer
ence as new arrivals, while juniors live
elsewhere.

Seniors, too, have preference in order
to spend their last year on campus with
in the house, but there are occasionally
conflicts over living arrangements.
In Pi Beta Phi, the solution is a points
system to help choose between the sen
iors, and also to act as an incentive.

"It's a bummer we can't have all the
seniors in the house," Webster said. "In a
lot of Greek systems, it's only sopho
mores that live in the house ... some
times the presidents have to have a fake
room because they are required to live
in the house but it's not cool to if you're
the only upperclassman."
While un-housed groups do not need
to worry about fitting everyone into a
house, this can sometimes lead to dis
agreements between housed and un
housed frats and sororities.

"As I understand it, in the past the
housed sororities have tried to force the
un-housed sororities to take more girls
during rush because they don't have to
worry about a space crunch," Hansen
said. "This is fine with me as long as
all the girls we are taking are girls that
truly fit with Chi Omega's values."
Despite the differences in housing
situation, Anthony Bestafka Cruz, vice
president and dean of membership in
take for the un-housed fraternity
Gamma Zeta Alpha, argued that a
house is not necessary to build commu-

nity. For example, he said the six
chapters that belong to the Multi
cultural Greek Council (MGC) and
the five chapters of the African
American Fraternal and Sororal
Association (AAFSA) build a fam
ily that is not just focused on hous
ing.
"Because we are un-housed, our
brotherhood (or sisterhood) is real
ly focused in the time we spend to
gether," Bestafka Cruz 'lO wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.
"We take vacations together, we
visit each other's homes and know
each other's families," he added.
"We are each other's friends and
family at Stanford, and I can't say
I've ever heard members of organi
zations that are housed say the
same,"
