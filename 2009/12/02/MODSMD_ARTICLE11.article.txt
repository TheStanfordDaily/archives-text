# ADMISSION
## Legacies a fifth of the Class of 2013 
### ALEX YU 
Stanford ranks as one of the most selec
tive four-year universities in the United
States and as such, its rigorous admissions
process often undergoes heavy scrutiny.
As the admission rate decreases year after
year, the qualifications distinguishing
those students who are admitted from
those who are rejected are blurred, and
every aspect of the application becomes
more important. What role does "legacy"
status play in this application?
According to Dean of Admission and
Financial Aid Richard Shaw, 18.8 percent
of the Class of 2013 had a legacy at Stan
ford. Legacies at Princeton, by compari
son, composed a comparatively lower pro
portion of the Class of 2013 at only 12.7
percent of the total class.

Stanford does not release the rate of
legacy admissions overall. Nevertheless,
Director of Admission Shawn Abbott, af

firmed, "The majority of legacy applicants
who apply for admission are actually not
admitted."

The University Undergraduate Ad
mission Web site defines an applicant as a
legacy "if at least one parent or stepparent
received an undergraduate and/or gradu
ate degree from Stanford."

Abbott confirmed this definition. He
further emphasized that having a sibling
who attended Stanford does not con
tribute to having a legacy status. Abbott
stated, "While we certainly take such in
formation into consideration, we have no
special preferences in our admission
process for students who have siblings
who have attended Stanford."

Robin Mamlet, Stanford's dean of ad
mission and financial aid from 2000 to
2005,alsoassertedthata sibling legacy pol
icy did not exist during her stint as Dean.
"There was no official sibling prefer
ence," Mamlet said. "It seemed wrong for

birth order to play a role in the admission
decisions."

Although legacy clearly plays a role in
admissions, its exact impact on admissions
is debatable.

A study in 2004 led by Princeton Uni
versity sociology Prof. Thomas Espen
shade claimed that having a legacy at a uni
versity gives an applicant an advantage
equivalent to an extra 160 points on the
SAT.

Mamlet stressed that having a legacy
alone cannot serve as grounds for admis
sion.

"When I was there, for a student who
was already high admissible, a legacy con
nection might have contributed to that
person's admission," Mamlet said. "It
would be rare, however, that legacy alone
tipped someone in."
