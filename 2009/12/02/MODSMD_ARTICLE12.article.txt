## Climate Conference attracts Farm 
### TROY YANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford students, faculty and staff will be
among an estimated 15,000 participants from 192
countries attending the 15th United Nations Cli
mate Conference (COPIS) in Copenhagen, Den
mark, this month.

The Conference will work toward the goal set
by over 180 nations in the Bali Road Map of 2007,
which called for the international community to
agree by 2009 on a binding framework for future
climate change mitigation.

Among those attending the event, which takes
place Dec. 7 to 18, will be at least 33 students as
well as 13 University faculty and staff. While del
egates from participating countries are at the ne
gotiating table ironing out the specifics of the ac
cord, these faculty, staff and students from a vari
ety of departments at the University will be in
volved in other aspects of the conference.
As part of a non-governmental organization
(NGO), members from the University have ob
server status at the conference. This gives repre
sentatives the opportunity to speak with delegates,
network with other policymakers and scientists,
and discuss problems and possible solutions with
like-minded individuals.

"It's a huge opportunity for faculty and stu
dents to network with people in the community
they are interested in continuing research with,
and also it's a great education opportunity for all
those involved," said Sarah Jo Chadwick, a staff
member in the department of biological sciences
who helped organize the trip to Copenhagen.
Side events such as panels and talks will be
held by many NGOs, including Stanford's repre
sentation, for those interested.

"There will be many side events ... on human
health, on economic risk, agricultural risk and
human disease risk associated with different ele
ments of climate change," said Robert Dunbar,
professor in the School of Earth Sciences and
senior fellow at the Woods Institute for the Envi
ronment.

Dunbar, who is also part of the management
committee at the Center for Ocean Solutions,
will present at a panel entitled "Ocean Acidifi
cation: The Other CO2 Problem," in which he
hopes to raise awareness of a lesser-known
problem stemming from carbon emissions.

"Because of ocean acidification, we have a
very good reason to think oceans will be impact
ed [by carbon emissions], and it's going to be a
completely separate impact from global warm

ing," Dunbar said. "I'm hoping that thinking
about the oceanic involvement will help convince
people that this is an urgent issue that needs to be
dealt with now."

Stephen Schneider, professor of interdiscipli
nary environmental studies and a well-known ex
pert in the field of climate change, will also give
talks about his latest book, "Science as a Contact
Sport," which covers the four decades he spent in
the "climate change battle."

Schneider, who is currently teaching a course
called "Copenhagen Climate Protocol: Interpret
ing the Chaos," is also responsible for bringing
many students to Denmark by offering those en
rolled in his class the opportunity to go with him
to the conference. The opportunity to attend the
conference was not limited to students who took
Schneider's class, however. In early September,
both undergraduate and graduate students had
the opportunity to apply for COPIS.
In general, students heading to Denmark have
a special interest in some aspect of climate
change, Ansu Sahoo, a Ph.D. student in manage
ment science and engineering, for example, hopes
to learn more about energy technology research
and development at the conference.
"I'm interested in talking to delegates in both
the United States and China to understand what
their perspectives are on the potential for re
search and development that can accelerate the
development and deployment of carbon capture
and sequestration technology," Sahoo said.
Students interested in public policy also look
forward to gaining something from the experi
ence.

"I'll be volunteering with a couple of different
organizations," said law student Bruce Ho.
"There will be a delegation representing the in
terests of the California government, so I'll be
working with them, and I'm also likely to work
with a couple of nonprofits involved with the
state."

Regardless of the outcome of the negotia
tions, both students and faculty seem to believe
they will benefit from the networking and learn
ing experience offered by the conference. At the
same time, delegates and other attendees will
benefit from the research and ideas that these
members of the Stanford community will bring.
"This attempt at making binding international
commitments is pretty tough and fascinating to
watch," Dunbar said. "I'm excited to go see the
process."
