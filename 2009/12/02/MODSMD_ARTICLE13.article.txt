## A 						graduation, 60 years overdue 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
Hundreds of former UC-Berkeley Japanese-
American students whose educations were interrupt
ed by World War II and Japanese internment will grad
uate this month alongside current students.
The product of Assemblymember Warren Furu
tani's Assembly Bill 37, signed into law by Governor
Schwarzenegger last October, the legislation calls
upon University of California schools, California State
Universities and California Community Colleges to
issue degrees to anyone whose education was inter
rupted by Japanese incarceration.
"The main motivation is that it's under the heading
of 'unfinished business,' tying up loose ends," Furutani
said. The Japanese assemblymember has been work
ing toward granting degrees to the former students for
decades.

Serving on the Los Angeles Board of Education
before being elected to the State Assembly, Furutani
organized a high school cap and gown graduation for
hundreds of Nisei the children of emigrants from
Japan, in this case second-generation Japanese Amer
icansâ€” who similarly had their high school educa
tions interrupted.

"I've always thought: 'what about those folks who
were in college and then they got pulled out of college
by Executive Order 9066 and were not given the op
portunity to finish?'" he said. "For me, the motivation
is that our Nisei are almost gone, and this was some
thing to correct past wrongs."

Legislation Long Overdue
Duncan Williams, who serves as associate professor
of Japanese Buddhism and chair of the Center for
Japanese Studies at UC-Berkeley, believes the legisla
tion is long overdue.

"Of course I think it [AB 37] should've come a long
time ago," Williams said. "In my opinion, I would have
hoped and thought that the UC system... would be a
leader, but it seems like we're at the tail-end."
However, Williams points out that the UC system
has a history of abstaining from issuing honorary de
grees of any kind. In order to issue said degrees, the UC
regions had to additionally vote to suspend the regula
tions. With the degrees approved, approximately 400
former students or families of students UC-Berke
ley had the largest population of Japanese students
pre-WWII will be among the first people in
decades to be issued honorary UC degrees.
The ceremony will run jointly with the regular un
dergraduate graduation; Williams, who serves on the
ceremony's campus planning committee and who will
be reading the names of the Japanese graduates, hopes
the university's undergraduates will be able to learn
something from the Nisei.

According to Williams, a number of private schools
on the West Coast have already issued similar degrees.
However, Furutani states that private schools, not
falling under governmental jurisdiction, cannot be
mandated to do so.

It is Stanford's policy not to issue honorary degrees.
Japanese students who formerly attended Stanford
during WWII and were forced to leave were honored
at a ceremony in fall of 1993, but no honorary degrees
were given.

"I can't recall having received such an honorary de
gree," said former Stanford student Eric Andow ('4B),
who was forced to leave campus when he was incarcer
ated in Colorado and subsequently sent overseas as
part of the Japanese-American 442 nd Regimental
Combat Team.

The ceremony was "just to reunite some people

that were at Stanford at the time," Andow said, and
was attended by then-University President Gerhard
Casper. Although a much larger population of stu
dents were forced to leave Stanford, only nine made it
to the ceremony. Among the nine, several were able to
re-matriculate post-war and finish their degrees a
course that UC-Berkeley students were unable to
take.

"I was taking an engineering course, so it's hard to
try to continue from that point when you left... but I
managed somehow because I was interested in getting
the degree more than anything else," Andow said. He
returned to achieve a degree in engineering.

Mixed Emotions from Former Berkeley Students
For former UC-Berkeley freshman Jim Yamasaki,
the honorary degree he will receive this winter is worth
less than the hardships he overcame by having his ed
ucation interrupted.

"Having received my B.S. degree in engineering at
Northwestern in 1949, the honorary degree for my
freshman year is nice PR for somebody and is appreci
ated as a gesture but really... why bother?" he said.
Originally from San Joaquin County-Tracy, Ya
masaki was an excellent student, receiving nearly all As
in school and working toward becoming the breadwin
ner of his family. His studies were interrupted, howev
er, when his father's liquor license was suspended, dis
abling the family business of running a tavern in Tracy.
Curfew restrictions then forced him to return home.

"There were bigger problems than [the] interrup
tion of my education... I had no time to worry about
school," he wrote in an e-mail. Shortly after returning
home, Executive Order 9066 uprooted his family and
relocated his life to the horse stables of the Turlock
county fair grounds, and eventually to Gila Rivers Re
location Center in Arizona.

Yamasaki was unable to return to UC-Berkeley
but found other methods of finishing his education. He
emphasizes there were many, such as himself, who
overcame them and found different paths to success.

From inside Gila Rivers Relocation Center, Ya
masaki applied for a scholarship to leave camp and re
sume his studies else where. He was accepted on a schol
arship to the University of Utah, where he was subse
quently drafted despite boasting the best grades in his
classes among white students who were allowed to
defer.

He became a 2nd Lieutenant and was transferred
to military intelligence, ending up in Japan on occupa
tion duty in counter intelligence. He spent the next
year writing secret reports from field information for
General Mac Arthur's staff

When Yamasaki returned to the states, he struggled
to find a school that wasn't already packed with Gls
from the GI Bill or that would accept Nisei students in
the post-war prejudice.

Yamasaki managed to matriculate into Northwest
ern University in Evanston, 111., thanks to the admis
sion interviewer, who graduated from UC-Berkeley
the same year he was forced to leave. He became the
first Japanese American to go to Northwestern tech
school and earned a B.S. in 1949 in Electrical Engineer
ing.

Cedrick Shimo was faced with numerous chal
lenges as well, but unlike Yamasaki, had his graduate
education at UC-Berkeley interrupted by the draft.
Shimo received his Los Angeles draft notice the day
after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but was ironically
refused passage on the train to L. A. because he looked
like the enemy.

Shimo eventually volunteered for the Military In
telligence Service (MIS) and was trans
ferred to Camp Savage in Minnesota.
Just before graduating from the MIS
language school, he was expelled for
protesting a rejected furlough. He had
asked for one in order to say goodbye
to his mother before being sent to the
Pacific Front, since no Japanese Amer
icans were allowed on the West Coast.
He was transferred to the 525 th, a
special unit for "troublemakers," de-

moted to the rank of a private, and
eventually was reorganized into the
1800 th, a similar unit for "malcon
tents." When the war ended, he re
ceived an honorable discharge.
Shimo has spoken about his experi
ences of defying authority at the Smith
sonian in Washington, D.C. and
UCLA, where he previously earned
his undergraduate degree.
Though he is unable to attend the
Berkeley graduation ceremony, he ap
preciates the degree.
"At least I got proof that I was in
graduate school in case somebody
doubts it," he said.

While there is no deadline for Cali

fornia public institutions included in
AB 37 to issue the degrees, Furutani
stressed that time is of the essence.

"As you know, the average age [of
Niseis] is 86 or 88 there's no dead
line, but literally they're passing away,
and if we don't get this done right away,
more and more are going to have to be
given away posthumously."

The first of the ceremonies will be
held by UC-San Francisco on Dec. 4,
followed by UC-Davis onDec. 12,UC-
Berkeley on Dec. 13 and UCLA in the
spring.
