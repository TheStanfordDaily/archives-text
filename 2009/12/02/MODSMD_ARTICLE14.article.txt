V V said Collin
Culbertson 'lO. "Our whole suite
normally goes together."
Culbertson attended the most
recent Senior Night at the British
Banker's Club (BBC) in Menlo
Park with a group of guy friends,
including suitemate Adam
Dunbar 'lO.
"I liked the atmosphere at the
BBC, although it was not the
usual Stanford crew," Dunbar
said.
"There were not as many peo
ple as at other pub nights,"

Culbertson agreed

While students like Culbertson
and Dunbar, who have attended
the majority of Senior Nights,
might have noticed a difference in
attendance at this one. Senior
Night newbie Manus McCaffery
'lO didn't haven't any preconcep
tions.

"I figured I might as well try it
once," McCaffery said. "I ran into
people I hadn't spoken to since
freshman year. I just hung out with
people."

Running into long-lost class
mates seems to be a theme at

Senior Night.
"It's fun to go and see a lot of
people that I've had classes with,
acquaintances that I don't get to
see," said Midori Uehara 'lO. "You
go and realize you actually know a
lot of people in the senior class."

This was Uehara's second
Senior Night of the quarter and
the first one she was fully able to
participate in, having just finished
her field hockey season.
"I pregamed a little bit, then I
went over to Theta to meet up
with friends," Uehara said. "At the
bar, we mostly just danced."
This particular Senior Night
was interesting because when
early students like Lynn Ngai 'lO
arrived at the bar, there was an
adult salsa class being held on the
dance floor.

"When we got there at 11, we
were literally the only Stanford
students there," Ngai said. "There
was a salsa class going on down
stairs [and] we thought we went to
the wrong place since no other stu
dents were there."

Eventually other students
showed up, and Ngai and her
friends ended up having a fun
night.

"The BBC was interesting.
They had good music," Ngai said.
"It was my third pub night not
as fun as the other two."

After Senior Night students
usually catch the bus back to cam
pus and head home or hang out
with their friends. Culbertson,
Dunbar and their rowdy group
managed to find away to entertain
themselves until early morning.
"We went home and played
Madden for three hours."
