# a 						hairy situation.
## The 						month when you run into stubble 
### FEDERICO DE LA BALZE 
The Spartans disciplined cowards by shaving off their
beards. This past month, dozens of Stanford students
have bravely forgone shaving in the annual tradition
of "No Shave November." Why would anyone do
that? Well, it depends on whom you ask.
Austin Keeley 'll, a prominent veteran of No Shave
November, explained the old-school rationale for "this won
derful occasion."
"I do it because I think beards are cool everyone should
take a time in their lives to grow a beard," Keeley said. "No
Shave November is about celebrating what you can do in a
month. I see lots of guys walking around with scraggly beards,
and it warms my heart."
This year, an outbreak of No Shave November among fresh
men has turned a few heads around with over 60 freshmen say
ing they'd partake in the event. Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, who ral
lied freshmen to join through Facebook, explained that part of
the reason for the success lies in an expansion of the motiva
tions behind No Shave November.

"We decided that as an incentive you could say you're doing
[No Shave November] for peace by tying it to 'Beards for
Peace,' an organization which began during the Vietnam War
that promotes not shaving as a means of protest against war,"
Vaid-Menon said.

Indeed, across campus people have proposed that No Shave
November addresses, practically and symbolically, a variety of
personal and global issues.

"It's a rough economy; not shaving saves me a fort une on
shaving supplies," Keeley said with a smile. "There are so many
good things about it: peace, saving money and saving water."
Despite the good-natured and joking character of No Shave
November, it is still about facing fears and overcoming obsta
cles. Chase Ishii 'l3, a three-year veteran of the event, stresses
the difficulties that accompany participation.
"It is always a good test of self-discipline," Ishii said. "It's
almost like a dating sabbatical for one month. The danger zone
is the neck beard, which is itchy as whatnot. I'm blessed to not
have to deal with that situation."

Keeley agreed with Ishii, but also stressed the importance of
perseverance.

"A week or two in, you start getting an itchy face," Keeley
said. "It doesn't really fill up in spots. That's really a dark peri
od. But once you get past the first two weeks, the sky's the limit.
Or rather, the ground."

For girls, social convention offers a particularly strong deter
rent from participating. Holly Fetter 'l3, who abstained from
shaving for three weeks and stands as one of the sole examples
of women attempting No Shave November, decries the lack of
female participation.

"I think it's a shame that I was one of the only girls who
observed this sacred holiday, especially since I failed," Fetter
said. "The double standard of men's and women's expected
shaving habits is absolutely ridiculous, and I think more women
need to stand up for the rights of their hairy limbs and
crevices."

Some girls, on the other hand, think that No Shave
November is just another justification males use to excuse their
laziness, and they strongly reject the practice.
"Guys created No Shave November as an almost-clever near
alliteration that marks their laziness about shaving all the time,"

said Emily Pollock 'l3. "I choose not
to be lazy, and I dislike being hairy."
There may be some truth to that
statement, as some guys have
moved beyond No Shave
November, seeking to expand it
throughout the year.

"Sometimes I'll observe differ
ent events like Manuary or
Febearduary or Marchstash,"
Keeley said. "This past summer, I
rode my bike across the country
and I let it grow. We came up with
July-to-your-girlfriend-and-tell-her-

you-lost-a-bet, which is a bit too
long. We're still looking for more

concise, short names for months."
Joseph Victor 'l3, a proud owner
and lover of beards, explained that
for people who grow beards almost
all year long, No Shave November
is really for amateurs.

"When someone asked me if I
would do No Shave November, I
said sure it would be the perfect
follow-up to No Shave October and
No Shave August," he said. "It's not
a big deal for someone like me. I
already have the beard."

No Shave November is one of
those good-natured college eccen
tricities that defy simple explana
tions. Yet, whatever the reason for
it, one thing is certain: the Spartans
would be proud.
