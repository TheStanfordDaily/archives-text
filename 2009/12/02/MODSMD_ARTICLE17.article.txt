# GET WITH THE PROGRAM
## 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Located in the heart of Silicon Valley,
it is no surprise that Stanford is
home to many brilliant emerging
minds in computer science (CS).
However, within this group of tal
ented students, there is an even more distin
guished group those who make it into the
CS section leading program.
Computer science section leading has not
always been a competitive job to land. When
Eric Ruth 'O9, currently a first-year computer
science graduate student, applied in the win
ter of 2006-07, he did not have to face the
extra stage that current candidates must
potentially deal with.

Now a co-coordinator of the CS section
leaders, Ruth commented on how the process
has changed in the years since he applied.
"The program has been growing more
popular," Ruth said. "It became more compet
itive as there are now more applicants and less
spots, so we need more ways to differentiate
the applicants."

Today's applicants need to first submit an
online application, Ruth said. Then, the appli
cants must do a 30-minute interview, which
includes teaching a mock CS session and
debugging code. If there are still too many
qualified candidates, there is a tiebreaker
stage in which applicants are presented with
difficult questions to make sure that they have

a solid grasp on the information.
Thomas Medina 'll had to apply several
times before finally getting in.
"It became more competitive last year
because of the influx of people who want to
become section leaders," Medina said. "It's a
fairly secure job once you get in. It's almost
impossible to lose except for gross negli
gence."

Alex Churchill 'l2 applied last year and
made it to the final round, but didn't land the
job. Reflecting on his disappointing experi
ence, he feels that he is a more prepared appli
cant now.

"I just recently applied again," he said.
"After taking CS 107,1 think that I'm much
more qualified to be a section leader than I
was before."

Of course, not all advanced CS students
want the position. There are many students
who take CS 106A, CS 1068 and CS 106 X
and still do not want to become section lead
ers.

"I chose not to apply because it's a very
large commitment," said Suril Shah 'l3.
"There are just so many things you have to do.
It's freshman year, so I want to explore more
courses first before settling into the job."
The selected section leaders have many
responsibilities. Though the pay is competitive
and there are perks, the commitment can be
several hours per week.

According to Mehran Sahami, a professor
of computer science, section leading responsi

bilities include teaching a weekly 50-minute
section, grading assignments and exams, hold
ing helper hours at the computer cluster at
Tresidder (the Lair) and attending weekly
staff meetings to review and standardize grad
ing rubrics. In addition, students are required
to take an additional teaching-oriented
course, CS 198, during their first quarter of
section leading.

So why would students want to commit
that many hours of their time to section lead
ing?

Current section leaders pointed out the
benefits of teaching a subject in terms of their
own knowledge.

"It gives you a solid foundation of comput
er science and teaching," said Dan Robinson
'll. "You understand CS with great depth
after teaching it, since you have to communi
cate it to people who don't understand imme
diately what you're talking about."
Other students referred to the social perks
that come along with the job. Sahami
explained that section leader coordinators
organize a fun activity every week to build
community.

"We sometimes have Human Mario Kart,"
Sahami said. "They get to go down the ramps
of a parking structure in a big wheel and they
have races. Also, there's Four Square on
Fridays and sometimes, we have some puzzle
solving games. They're all voluntary but in
good fun."
In addition, many tech companies provide
benefits to the section leaders.
"We had a Microsoft section leader event
a couple weeks ago," Robinson said.
"Microsoft took 30 section leaders to go to
Sky High for free and then they took us out to
In-n-Out and paid for our food."
Others point to the fact that section lead
ing provides a community, both during school
years and post-graduation.
"We have a pretty tight-knit community,"
Ruth said. "It's a nice way for computer sci
ence people to meet other omputer science
people."
Sahami explained the benefits of knowing
other talented computer science undergradu
ates.
"It's a good way to find project partners,"
