# STUDENT MASTERPIECES: EXHIBIT A
## 
### IAN MONTGOMERY 
What happens when engineers and
artists combine science, technolo
gy and aesthetics? The answer: a
playground that would make your
inner 9-year-old drool with slap
happy wonder. And what's more: you can now
take a design class here at Stanford from the artist
and professor who created one such playground
masterpiece.

John Edmark, lecturer in the Art and Art
History Department, recently completed a three
month residency at the Exploratorium Museum of
Science, Art and Human Perception in San
Francisco in which he co-designed the exhibit
"Geometry Playground," a play structure housing
mirrors and video imaging to create a kaleido
scope-like experience. Edmark, refreshed and
enthused from his time away from the Farm, has
returned this year to instruct a class called
"Design for Exploration" for students to design
their own interactive museum exhibits for the
Exploratorium.

"I have loved the opportunity to collaborate
between Stanford and the Exploratorium,"
Edmark said.

"Professor Edmark is very excited about the
class and sharing his experience with the
Exploratorium," said Jason Chua 'll, a student in
the class. "He is pushing us hard."
The weekly class, taught by Edmark and his co
instructor, Exploratorium scientist Sebastian
Martin, consists of workshops on topics such as
mirrors, mechanical motion and color. Students
roughly evenly divided between graduate students
and undergrads were assigned to create an
actual exhibit for the Exploratorium museum
incorporating elements of science in a playful and
interactive manner.

Ben Halpern 'll designed an exhibit entitled
"How do movies move?" showcasing the mechan
ics of early 1900s film projectors called Geneva

drives. Instead of letting the film canister roll con
tinuously, the mechanism actually pauses on each
individual frame for l/24th of a second before
switching to the next frame.

"I came up with the idea after reading the
Wikipedia entry for Geneva drive during an earli
er mechanical motion assignment," Halpern said.
Purin Phanichphant, a graduate student in art,
took a more interactive approach with his piece.
Participants in Phanichphant's exhibit,
Video Echo, play with their shadow as it is project
ed onto a dark screen by live video feed. The effect
is much like seeing your image infinitely multi
plied by two inward facing mirrors, but with a
delay that causes a gradual rippling effect to trail
from your shadow.

"One of the biggest challenges occurred when
I realized that the camera needed to be easily
adjusted and not fixed to the armature,"
Phanichphant said. "I dealt with this by loosely
attaching a makeshift tripod to the projector."

Edmark credited much of the success of the
class to Martin, his co-instructor.
"Without him, the class would not be possible,"
Edmark said.

Martin was trained in seismology and also
teaches a course on Physics and Music at UC-
Berkeley.

"I enjoy introducing a creative process based
on engagement in play and experimentation"
Martin said of his teaching style for the class.
Edmark's Geometry Playground is currently
on display at Cantor Arts Center. The exhibit will
be on loan to Cantor until the entire Playground is
completed and ready to go on nationwide tour.
Edmark encourages students to take advantage of
the generous Stanford Institute for the Creativity
and the Arts (SICA) grant available to them.
The students' exhibits will be on display at the
Exploratorium all day Friday, Dec. 4.
