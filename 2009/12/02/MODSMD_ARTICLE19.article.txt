# FLY AWAY HOME, SLOWLY
## 
### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every time Pakistani students Asfandyar
Ali Mir 'l2 and Shahryar Kamal Malik 'l2
enter the United States, they are detoured to
a separate room for questioning.
"They ask you questions about where you
are from, where you are going to and what
college you attend," Mir said.
As winter break approaches, finals are
not the only worries for international stu
dents like Mir and Malik. In addition to
pricey plane tickets and multi-hour trips, a
few have to deal with visa issue delays and
extensive airport security procedures.
Despite estimates by John Pearson, direc
tor of the Bechtel International Center, that
the number of students who experience
delays is decreasing, a few of Stanford's 462
international undergraduates are still antici
pating a long trip home next week and
perhaps a longer trip back to Stanford.
According to Pearson, there is usually no
problem with students returning to their
home country. The main concern is students
reentering the United States after winter
break.
The first possible delay, he explained, usu
ally occurs due to visa problems. When stu
dents have current visas and the necessary

documents, there is little con
cern with re-entry. But visa
delays are problematic,
"Some countries can take

some time to issue a new

visa," Pearson wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "We
have seen issues with
students from China,
Iran and Pakistan in the
past few years."
"Delays in obtaining
new visas caused stu
dents to miss the begin
ning of winter quarter,"
he continued, something
that has happened "in
the past few years" to an
unspecified number of

students.
Pearson suggested that
there might be proposed

changes at the federal level to the regula
tions for J-l visas, the type required for many
students, and the Student and Exchange
Visitor Information System, which is admin
istered by the Department of Homeland
Security.
"Once we know more, we will be moving
ahead with considerable outreach to stu
dents," Pearson said.

In addition to

possible visa delays, stu
dents also have to deal
with immigration. While

Mir, a sophomore
from Pakistan,
1 said he has only
been asked "basic
questions," Malik
I said he has
I encountered
more persistent
interviewers.
According to
I Malik, question
ers became suspi
cious when he
" returned to the
U.S. this fall from a

Stanford overseas
seminar in Turkey.
"They seemed to

want to imply something bad because they
wanted to know more that time," Malik said.
"They don't understand that I'm in America
to just study at a very prestigious university
and not anything else like meeting up with
terrorists.
"I'm positive that if I say that I study any
thing to do with explosives and chemicals,
they would question me even more," Malik,

who studies history and economics, added. "I
think it's unfair I have to go through this. It's
not right that carrying a Pakistani passport
signals a red flag at any American airport."
Airport troubles sometimes weigh into a
student's decision to go home.
"I'm usually hesitant about going to air
ports now," Mir said. "The extra procedure
takes me an extra hour or so ... sometimes,
it can take even more than an hour when
there are too many people.
"But I don't have any other option to go
home even though the questioning is irritat
ing," he said.
After undergoing it every time, Malik and
Mir have both accepted the procedure as
routine for air travel.
"I respect and appreciate the Department
of Homeland Security despite the meticu
lous investigations I have to encounter whilst
entering and exiting the country," Malik said.
"I understand that increased security meas
ures are used to assist rather than antagonize
us."
Other Factors
Besides visa and airport problems, time
and money also factor into students' deci
sions whether or not to go home for break.
"A ticket back home [to Malaysia] costs
nearly $2,000," said Stephanie Siow 'll. "And

the plane trip generally takes about 24 hours,
including layovers."
Stoica Cristinel Popa 'll, a student from
Romania, commented that his trips to and
from his home could take up to three days.
"There are usually only flights to
Bucharest, but I live four hours away from
Bucharest," Popa said. "Even though it takes
several days, I still try to go home every win
ter and summer."
According to Pearson, most international
graduate students stay for the break because
their dorms are open, while international
undergraduate students often leave either
for home or elsewhere in the U.S. because
the dorms are closed.
For students who decide to stay, Stanford
accommodates these students and allows
alternate options, Pearson said.
"The Stanford Guest House is available
for undergraduate students who decide to
stay," he wrote. "Bechtel also offers pro
grams during the break for the students who
do stay."
Still, both Malik and Mir are Pakistan
bound this winter break.
"It's a hassle," Mir said. "But it's become
normal now."
