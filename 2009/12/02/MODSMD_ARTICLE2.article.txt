## 30k soldiers will deploy to Afghanistan President announces decision in major speech at West Point 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
President Barack Obama announced Tues
day night that he will send 30,000 additional
troops to Afghanistan, escalating the United
States' eight-year military operation in the re
gion.

The soldiers will deploy in early 2010, bring
ing the total number of American soldiers in
Afghanistan to approximately 100,000.
The speech ends weeks of speculation
about the precise decision President Obama
would reach regarding strategy in Afghanistan
for 2010 and beyond. The President argued for
the deployment's representing "the resources
that we need to seize the initiative while build
ing the Afghan capacity that can allow for a re
sponsible transition of our forces out of
Afghanistan."

Obama announced the increase in front of
4,000 cadets at the United States Military
Academy in West Point, New York. His speech

also outlined and defined objectives
for what the White House is calling
"a new way forward."

The decision raises the likeli
hood that the war in Afghanistan
will be as defining to the Obama
presidency as the Iraq War was to
the terms of President George W.
Bush. Conscious of this and the
gravity of the increase, the President
used much of the speech to explain
the urgent necessity he saw for the
move.

"I do not make this decision
lightly," he said. "I make this deci
sion because I am convinced that
our security is at stake in
Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is
the epicenter of the violent extrem
ism practiced by al-Qaeda. It is from
here that we were attacked on 9/11,
and it is from here that new attacks
are being plotted as I speak. This is
no idle danger, no hypothetical
threat.

"This danger will only grow if the
region slides backwards and al-
Qaeda can operate with impunity,"
he added. "We must keep the pres
sure on al-Qaeda, and to do that, we
must increase the stability and
capacity of our partners in the
region."

The President also used the
speech to clarify military strategy in
Afghanistan, and said the United
States' "overarching goal" remains
constant: "to disrupt, dismantle and
defeat al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and
Pakistan, and to prevent its capacity
to threaten America and our allies
in the future."

Obama explicitly listed three

main objectives that will define
achieving that goal.
"We must deny al-Qaeda a safe
haven," he said. "We must reverse
the Taliban's momentum and deny
it the ability to overthrow the gov
ernment. And we must strengthen
the capacity of Afghanistan's securi
ty forces and government so that
they can take lead responsibility for
Afghanistan's future."
The President said the newly
deploying troops will return home
beginning in 18 months.
Saying that the price of two
ongoing wars can no longer be
ignored, Obama also said he will
work to monitor and control the
costs of the increase and the contin
ued conflict. Funding the new
approach in Afghanistan will cost
$3O billion in 2010, he said.

At the start of the President's
term, 32,000 American troops were
deployed in Afghanistan. Earlier in
the year, Obama also approved a
longstanding troop increase
request, but Tuesday's announced
increase emerges from an entirely
new strategic review.

Obama closed his half-hour
speech with a direct address to the
American people.
"America, we are passing
through a time of great trial," he
said. "And the message that we send
in the midst of these storms must be
clear: that our cause is just, our
resolve unwavering. We will go for
ward with the confidence that right
makes might, and with the commit
ment to forge an America that is
safer, a world that is more secure
and a future that represents not the
deepest of fears but the highest of
hopes."
