# HARVESTING THANKSGIVING SPIRIT ON THE FARM
## 
### KATHERINE ROBERTSON 
For most, Thanksgiving
means traveling home and
spending time with family.
But for hundreds of stu
dents, this year it meant
staying right here on campus.
Their reasons are many. For
some, home is too far; others had
athletic events. Some just wanted
to stick around and get work
done. Yet all had the opportunity
to celebrate together in a casual
setting or organized event.
As one might expect, the
ambiance on campus over
Thanksgiving is quiet. Most build
ings are closed, and the streets are
devoid of cars and students.

"There are not that many peo
ple," said Rajendra Kumar 'lO.
"When I stayed, it was quiet.
[There was] like one cafeteria
open in Stern and one in
Lagunita. It was empty."
But many students found ways
to embrace their peaceful dorms
and still have a good time. Some
used their empty dorm rooms for
get-togethers and parties. Those
who found the scene to be too
quiet ventured off campus.
Groups of students took road trips

to visit friends and explore Palo
Alto and the greater Bay Area.
"I love having a social life
it's where I get my energy from,"
Kumar said. "All my friends were
like, 'Let's do something, guys: We
went to Santa Cruz and took a
camping trip."
On Thanksgiving Day, a holi
day often celebrated in part
around the dinner table, students
on campus had various options.
Some students went to local
restaurants for an unconventional
Thanksgiving meal. In the past,
others have attempted to make
dinner in the dorm kitchen.
"We invite students to make
dinner if they wish," said Twain
Resident Fellow (RF) Arcadio
Morales. "The first time we hosted
Thanksgiving, the students agreed
they were going to make pumpkin
pies. They had seen it done before,
but had never done it themselves.
They never quite finished and
ended up running to Safeway."
Students staying on campus this
year had a number of opportunities
to enjoy traditional Thanksgiving
food at University events. The
Bechtel International Center host
ed a Thanksgiving dessert night
Wednesday at 7 p.m., where all stu
dents both international and
American were invited to min-

gle and enjoy pumpkin pie.

Graduate students and their
families were invited to attend a
Thanksgiving dinner hosted by
the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) and held at the Graduate
Community Center. Traditional
Thanksgiving turkey and vegetari
an options were offered for free.
"This is the 12th year that the
GSC has hosted this event," said
GSC Co-Chair Nanna Notthoff.
"We are very grateful that the
President's Office is sponsoring
[it], with some supplemental funds
from GSC."

Finally, students who hoped to
celebrate Thanksgiving in a home
like environment were able to
share dinner with a local Stanford
family through the Stanford
Parents' Club.

Despite the diminished num
ber of students and the lacking
comforts of home, students who
remain on campus for
Thanksgiving can beat the bore
dom and enjoy the week by stay
ing active, creative and involved.

"It comes down to what kind of
person you are ," Kumar said,
"whether you like excitement or
you like calmness for a week."
