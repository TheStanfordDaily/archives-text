## EDITORIAL On climate change, stay rational, get serious 
### 
Rumor has it that we are not the ones to
blame for climate change the
human race, that is. Scientists of the Cli
mate Research Unit at the University of East
Anglia were recently found to have manipu
lated data in order to support preordained
conclusions about mankind's responsibility
for climate change, and climate change skep
tics have come out in full force to cite this one
example as proof of man's innocence when it
comes to global warming.
While the misconduct of the CRU may
puff up the skeptics' sails, the Editorial Board
hopes that this one unfortunate example will
not lead the public to abandon its concern
about climate change. The fact is that
mankind's climate change culpability is
backed by strong scientific evidence and the
majority of scientific opinion. All that is need
ed to continue progress at combating climate
change is further support from policymakers
and the media. Climate change skeptics, for
the most part, are doing everything they can to
hamper this support.
The turn of the century witnessed a change
in humanity's consciousness about our effects
on the environment. A1 Gore's An Inconve
nient Truth, the damaging effects of Hurricane
Katrina and the 2004 tsunami at last drew the
public's eye toward the Earth and its changing
environment. Whether or not the tsunami or
Katrina was directly influenced by global
warming, these catastrophic events neverthe
less changed how we view our environment
and our impact on the planet. So, now that
naysayers of global warming have the floor
once more, is it time to turn our backs on the
wisdom painfully acquired over the past
decade?

The planet and people feel the effects of
our changing environment no matter how
many seek to crowd out scientific proof of cli
mate change. There is solid evidence that car
bon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap

heat in our atmosphere. There is solid evi
dence that burning fossil fuels is not only un
sustainable, but that fossil fuel consumption
adds 27 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere each year. There is solid
evidence that temperatures are increasing and
the environment is changing, in many cases,
for the worse. There will always be time to
argue about what the cause of climate change
is with those who dispute scientific evidence.
But there will not always be an equal chance
to prevent its occurrence and limit its effects.
To concede ground to skeptics at this time
will only halt needed efforts at reducing the
future impacts of the changing climate. With
the Copenhagen Climate Conference quickly
approaching, this is not the time to feed into a
fringe, anti-science group of right-wing ex
tremists who are opposing virtually indis
putable scientific evidence by giving these
skeptics media attention. Our minds and
media should focus on further progress now
that our current climate wisdom shows us the
need for policy action on the global and per
sonal scales.

The Editorial Board believes that, while
the conduct of the CRU is less than ethical and
unjustified, this scandal and others like it
should not fuel the fire that threatens environ
mental consciousness and efforts to protect
our planet. The growing momentum of con
servation and protection is one that should
continue into the next decade and beyond.
Progress may be questioned by the fringe
their voices seemingly the only ones we hear
at times but progress toward a greener and
cleaner planet has begun and should not be
displaced. We can only hope that environmen
talism will not evaporate, even if the ethics of
scientists and politicians do. A focus on effec
tive climate change policy should remain at
the top of policymakers' lists, hopefully with a
louder and more resounding voice than the
small cries of skeptics.
