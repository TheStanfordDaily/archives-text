## "My Gentleman's Library" 
### P.G. Mann 
Please, step into my gentleman's library. I
don't leave its leather-bound confines
these days, and to receive a visitor is a
rare treat indeed. Please, please, don't be shy.
Wipe your boots on the sable fur mat, set your
cane in the well and cross the threshold to my
kingdom.
Pray, sit down. Make yourself at home.
Hang your hat on the elk antlers, the bronzed
rhino horn, wherever you like. My gentle
man's library is your gentleman's library. Only
I must ask that you not remove the laminate
on the sofa. We've been told it's not gentle
manly. Don't mind that shriveled woman
there. She's sound asleep. Simply pretend
she's not there. Instead, turn your gaze upon
the marvels of my collection. What you see be
fore you are the spoils of lifelong travel and
the learned discernments of a private scholar.
These mounted heads are trophies from my
big game hunts on the Dark Continent. That
folio there is the erotic diary of a 17th-century
courtesan in the sultan of Brunei's harem, a
gift from the sultan himself. And here, adja
cent to the wonder cabinet, betwixt my astro
labe and the collected works of Hume, is an
original medical prescription written for John
Milton's gout.
For these treasures, I entangled myself in in
numerable romances and intrigues round the

globe. But I eventually grew weary of the world
of men and retreated to the sanctuary of this li
brary. Like the immortal Montaigne, I have
consecrated the rest of my days to a life of the
mind. If you look at the mantel, above the busts
of Plutarch and Carlyle,you'll see that I have in
scribed for all posterity my vow to pursue
knowledge strictly within these hallowed walls.

This vow has been notarized and carries
with it the authority of the state of Indiana.
Impressive, you say? Well, not only did the
local government endorse my scholarly reclu
sion, they even honored me with a flashing
jeweled bracelet to commemorate the deed. I
have been instructed to wear it here, just
below my sock garter and directly above my
spats, and never to remove it. Fetching, isn't it?
Behold, next to the fireplace, a complete
collection of all knowledge, bound in gilded
leather, befitting of a man of my station. Every
luminous pearl of wisdom from Heraclitus to
Hegel oh, forgive me. How rude I have
been. I entirely forgot to offer you a beverage.
And you must be terribly thirsty. I believe we
have some claret in the cellar. Just a moment.

"Grandma, wake up! He-110, Grandma! Up
and at 'em! Can't you see I have a guest and that
we're both beyond parched? Be a dear and
fetch us some claret from the cellar."

"Now, Clarence, you know you're not sup-

posed to have visitors.The judge was very clear
about that."

"Grandma, please don't tell me what to do
when you're in my gentleman's library. That's
one of the rules."
"Well, I thought we also agreed you weren't
going to fuss with my Reader's Digests. Please
put them back next to the fireplace before they
get bent. Also, what did I tell you about putting
your rocks in the linen closet?"
"You mean the wonder cabinet."
"Sure. And, for the last time, stop writing
'Collected Works of Hume' on my Dan Koontz
books."
"Grandma! Just fetch the claret, would
you?"
I'm sorry. She's totally senile. I tried barri
cading her in the bedroom, but then I realized
there would be no one to cook and tend to the
scullery. After all, a gentleman must have his
victuals. Now let me show you my volumes of
Voltaire.
"Clarence, I didn't see any drink called
claret in the fridge. Just your usual Grape Tang.
Now, make sure your friend doesn't spill any on
the sofa. That laminate is hard to clean."
"I know, Grandma! Now would you mind
we're trying to have an intellectual conver-
sation about Voltaire."
"Clarence, you know what the psy
chiatrist said. That Voltaire is what got
you into all this mess in the first place,"
"I was just fighting for enlighten-

ment against the blackguard clergy."
"You exposed yourself to a nun,
while shouting lewdly in French."
"There's nothing lewd about

'ecrasez l'infame,' Grandma."
"There is when your wiener is
hanging out."
"Grandma, go to your room!
You're embarrassing me in my gentle
man's library!"
"You and your friend can visit until
four, Clarence. Then my programs
come on. Make sure you un-tape those
cardboard animal heads from the TV
by then."

"Fine, Grandma, whatever. Just
leave us alone."

"Oh, one more thing, Clarence.
Have you seen my gout prescription

from Dr. Milton? I can't find it any
where."
"I have no idea where it is. Grand
ma."
I really must apologize. She's quite
the philistine. What's that? You have to
go? What a shame. Now, what was that
you mentioned at the door about sell
ing cookies? Never mind? Oh well,
you can tell me about it next time.
