# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Coming Soon to an Armchair Near You! 
### Emily Hulme 
Another quarter down and another
break is nearly upon us. During these
breaks, I always set my sights upon
the same goal and I must admit, I've never
quite achieved it. Maybe some people catch
up on sleep or read for pleasure, but I find
neither of these diversions particularly allur
ing. Instead, I try to watch enough television
to catch my yearly average up with the aver
age American. I don't do this for the honor or
the money, but simply for that indescribable
elation I feel for fitting in with my kin, even in
this small way. But this is not an easy goal,
since I'm usually behind by break and this
year in particular has snuck up on me. In
order to make my yearly tally, I'll have to
watch about 78 hours of television each day
and, frankly, after factoring in the time it
takes me to amble from my bedroom and
open the kitchen cabinet on six separate oc
casions only to be disappointed, I'm going to
be pretty busy.
Even though I don't watch that much at
school, TV does satisfy me, in its way. The
Food Network tells me what to eat,TLC tells
me how to dress and the History Channel
teaches me about UFO cults and feral chil
dren. This season, though, I won't be watch
ing nearly as many Gilmore Girls reruns be
cause some especially promising political is
sues are on tap for nuanced debate over the
next few weeks on FOX and MSNBC. I'll be
tuning into the following, in hopes that some
one wins, someone loses and someone goes
home crying to their mom when Nancy
Pelosi shoots them "the look":

Health care: After six months of watching
this slow-motion car crash, will the President
finally get the Christmas/Hannukah/Kwan
zaa/Festivus gift under the metaphorical tree,
or will the Blue Dog scrooges deny him re
form in a direct affront both to Democratic
leadership and the spirit of the season? Will
the public option be in the stocking? And will
it be the robust Godiva option, or the crappy
Russel Stover version that gets thrown away
as useless on the 26th?

Afghanistan: The commander-in-chief
(also known as ditherer-in-chief in Cheney
parlance) made an announcement this Tues
day, but we still have all of December to hand
wring over Europe's commitment to the war
before the international conference in Lon
don. Since there are approximately zero
"good" options and a lot of "sort of OK"
ones, perhaps the only guarantee is that

rhetoricians will have a heyday. Predicted
frequently used terms: "throwing our allies
under the bus," "dither" (seriously, you could
play a drinking game take a shot for every
op-ed you read on Afghanistan with this
word in it), "back his oratory with a stick," "a
million dollars per troop per year," and "what
would Sarah Palin do? Gosh darn that she's
not in office." OK, maybe not that last one.
Marijuana: Attorney General Eric Hold
er, relieving the anxieties of those who smoke
pot to relieve their anxieties (and sundry
other ailments), has declared an armistice, if
you will, in the "War on Drugs," insofar as the
feds will no longer use random and irrational
terror as a method of controlling marijuana
distribution. While you might suspect the
raids became prohibitively expensive after
Southwest jacked up their Fun Fares from
D.C. to California, it's most likely because
Miss New Jersey "outed herself as a stealth
marijuana user to treat her asthma." Ac
tivists, reasonably, are interpreting this as a
call to fight for full legalization so we can tax
it and, in turn, have enough money for our
school systems to start teaching students
about the respiratory system again.
Gitmo: Looks like Obama reduced, recy
cled and reused his 2009 New Year's Resolu
tion into being his 2010 Resolution. How fun!
Global Warming: Speaking of recycling,
just when it seemed like things would go
swimmingly with Mr. Obama traveling to
Copenhagen on a mission to save the world
from carbon emissions, some hackers fished
up thousands of e-mails and documents from
a environmental research center purportedly
filled with titillating stories of lies, damn lies
and statistics engineered by scientists to
make warming seem more urgent. Putting
aside what seems to be the Republican
Party's new penchant for information ac
quired through morally questionable
schemes, on-the-fence Democrats can't be
too enthused about supporting still stagnant
legislation designed to cut domestic emis
sions. It might just take divine intervention to
snatch this bill from the jaws of death, but, in
a pinch, maybe A1 Gore will do.
A packed schedule to be sure and I hope
you'll join me in watching other people pro
crastinate. It's one of the few times I don't
feel guilty about procrastinating myself.
