Despite the steady stream of columns
I've been writing, life in Barcelona has
been a bit more complicated than one
easily reduced, column-ready anecdote per
week. Now, in a month it will all be over, and
I've thought of one last topic about which I
never quite got around to writing about: end
ings. About coming home.
I remember it was one of the first long
weekends in September or October, and peo
ple from the program had scattered to the
four winds, or rather the winds going to Ams
terdam, Oktoberfest and Rome. I stayed
back. I felt like I barely knew where I was in
Barcelona. I didn't feel much up to hopping
on a plane bound for another country.
The first night, I was cooking in my room.
More specifically, I was washing potatoes in
the sink and heating oil on the stove while I
watched television on my computer. I had
the door open and the windows cracked,
hoping to avoid the guy at reception calling
to ask if I was dying in a blaze, since it
seemed like every time the stove was on it
tripped the fire alarm. I was so engrossed in
my multitasking that when I registered that

the open door creaking, a girl I had met but
barely ever spoken to was already sitting on
my bed and striking up conversation.
I was drying the potatoes and beginning to
attempt to peel them with a knife while I eval
uated the situation. This girl was in the pro
gram, but she'd maybe been in my room
once? After that, I'd only noticed her because
of how hung over she always seemed in our
nine o' clock class. She was very short, so I
worried about it less. After all, if she did fall
asleep in class, her head would not have far to
fall to the desk.

That night she was drinking a beer, and
having that special sort of "conversation" that
amounts to a monologue with pauses for
breathing which an interlocutor might misin
terpret as an invitation to participate. Her
topic? She'd been scheduled to stay a year
and was seeking some justification for cutting
her stay here short.
"It's just, I know I could make a life for my
self here," she said, and paused, taking a sip
from her Heineken, "but why bother when
I'm just going to rip it all up in eight months
time?"

At first I tried to give her real advice. I
talked about how connections made had their
own intrinsic worth, how the focus on a rela
tionship couldn't be the end date, whether it
was with a person or a city. Blah, blah, blah.
She didn't care much for what I said though,
of course. Finishing her beer, she looked up
and asked me if I'd like one. I said sure, and
she went off to her room to fetch it. I walked
out into the hallway and realized my door had
probably been the only open one she'd found
on all three floors. There wasn't anyone else
to listen.

Of course, I had been having the opposite
debate with myself whether or not to ex
tend my stay. I'd avoid spending a painful
five-month stretch before my 21st birthday
in the States, for one, but it was more than
that. More than anything, it was that I love
this place. Unlike the girl in my room, I
would have loved more time here, no matter
how much harder it would have been to
leave it in the end. There was a variety of rea
sons why I ended up deciding not to stay
