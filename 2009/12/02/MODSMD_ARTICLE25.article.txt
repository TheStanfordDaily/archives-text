## Dead Week Sweeps 
### Kevin Webb 
Welcome, freshmen, to Dead Week.
Your friends from other universities
may have told you about an incred
ible week where they have literally nothing
to do but study for their finals. As of this
week, those people are no longer your
friends. They aren't liars, but they may as well
be, because Dead Week is anything but.
While it isn't dead, it's pretty close. Teach
ers will sometimes (not always) reduce work
loads, which means more time to study for re
sponsible students. For the rest of us, it means
more time for, again, anything but.
When it comes to procrastination, I am a
Viking. I've Photoshopped myself kicking
Oski into the pit from "300," I've morphed
friends' faces together to envision their hy
pothetical children, I've written columns
about TV under the guise of Dead Week ad
vice.

As of late, though, none of that has been
necessary. Why? TTiis fall season, television

has done it all for me.

I know TV traditionally has a pretty bad
reputation, especially among academics. It's
shocking how many students on this very
campus grew up without knowing that power
coins can summon huge transforming robots
called Zords, or that when Tim the Tool Man
Taylor grunts, you had best duck for cover.
I also vaguely recall seeing commercials
comparing a brain watching TV to an egg
being scrambled, which was ironic given the
advert's medium, as well as the fact that eggs
are way more delicious when scrambled.
As a lifelong TV watcher, though, I think
we're entering a new golden age, where even
average shows are smarter and faster than
their counterparts a decade ago. Yes, I am
only going to be talking about sitcoms in this
column (if you only watch TV for the reality
shows, you really have no business reading,
anyway).
I've been reflecting on how shows like "30

Rock," "The Office," "Curb Your Enthusi
asm" and, my new favorite, "Community"
can exist when only a few years ago we were
stuck with formulaic programs like "Dharma
and Greg," "Everybody Loves Raymond"
and the countless sitcoms set in a magazine
office/radio station/TV newsroom.

First of all, comedies today have room to
develop. Unlike their forebears which tradi
tionally started and ended in the same place
every week, comedies today can have charac
ters, plots and settings that change from
episode to episode, and with online distribu
tion, DVRs and the availability of relatively
cheap DVDs, audiences can be trusted to get
jokes that build on old ones.
A show just on the cusp of this phenome
non was "Arrested Development," a series
that arguably remains unsurpassed in clever
ness. If you haven't seen it, please stop read-
