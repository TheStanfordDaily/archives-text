Finally, Winter Break is really close! Not only does this period off mean relaxation and time with friends and family, but also it signals the culmination
of holiday cheer. I can already picture all the angry kids who didn't get a Zhu Zhu Pet Hamster for Christmas. This season offers lots of excuses to
celebrate just a little more vigorously and to act just a tad bit crazier. It's all in the spirit of the holidays, right? However, on the flipside, this time of
the year also presents a chance to reflect on the past year and what we can do to better the one approaching. That's right, I'm talking about New Year's reso
lutions. Here are some to consider in your attempt to make next year better than ever.

. Less Vomit
Whether you yourself did the vomiting or you helped out a friend in need, we've all unfortunately been exposed to a little vomit this year. It's just
disgusting. Last year, my dorm considered making vomit perpetrators wear a scarlet V for the day, which I actually think most people around here would
wear with pride, because it was just getting out of hand. It's fine to continue drinking, but we should just start learning our limit. Or, if this resolution seems
impossible, how about just promise to always make it to the toilet? It's time for us to stop sleeping in our own throw up! . . . metaphorically, of course.

2 "
Maybe if we got stuff done earlier, we would have more time to sleep. I know it's a crazy concept, but perhaps this plan would reduce your number
of all-nighters. We should all make a pledge together to read the chapters, finish the p-sets and write the papers with enough time to get an acceptable
night's rest. I find it funny that an antonym for "procrastinate" doesn't even exist. Stop procrastinating and become more acquainted with your pillow.
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

I had to block Farmville from my feed because it just got out of control. I'm sorry, but I don't really care about your sheep. I think we could all use a little less Facebook in our
lives next year. It's sad when you know all about a person before you even meet them I quote, "I've seen you on Facebook. You look like you have a lot of fun." Stalking people is fun
and entertaining, but there are more productive, less creepy activities we could all be doing. Start by limiting the number of statuses per week or maybe profile pictures, and eventually

move to the number of hours a day. Take it nice and slow, and if necessary, get help addictions are hard to break.
