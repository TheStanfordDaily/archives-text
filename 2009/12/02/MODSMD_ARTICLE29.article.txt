The Big Game wasn't
the only event that had
certain Bay Area resi
dents riled up during
Thanksgiving break.
That same weekend,
the Stanford Theatre Activist
Mobilization Project
(STAMP) performed the San
Francisco Bay Area premiere
of "My Name Is Rachel
Corrie," a staged reading
based on the diaries and e
mails of Rachel Corrie, an
American college student
killed while working for
social justice and peace in the
Gaza Strip six years ago.
This controversial
one-woman show starred
Amanda Gelender 'lO as
Rachel Corrie. As a young
Jewish-American activist,
Gelender had an incredibly
personal connection with the
life of her character.
"In 2007,1 started
writing op-eds about the
Israeli occupation," Gelender
said. "I received negative and
positive responses from
around the world. One of the
people that contacted me was
Rachel Corrie's father, who
said that I spoke with the
spirit of Rachel."

Because of this
exchange, Gelender was
inspired to read the play,
which, in turn, inspired her.
"I read the play and
fell in love with it," Gelender
said, "because of its originali-

ty, soul, message and
potential to bring peo
ple together."
For two years,
she sought the rights
to the play, but each
request was denied.
Yet she refused to give
up the fight.
"As a Jewish
American, I feel a
heightened culpability
for the human rights
abuses occurring by
Israel," Gelender said.
"Chiefly because
Israel is the only
Jewish state and sec
ondly because the
Israeli military is so
heavily funded by the
United States. This is
why I felt particularly

compelled to bring 'My
Name Is Rachel Come' to
Stanford. There aren't enough
projects on campus that speak
to the Palestinian experience
in an occupied land and this

play eloquently portrays an
aspect of that struggle
through an American lens."
But not everyone on
the Stanford campus shared
Gelender's passion for the
play. There were protesters at

each performance, picketing
outside the theater and hand
ing out leaflets. At first,
Gelender was worried.
"I believe that the pro
testers had a right to picket

and hand out leaflets,"
Gelender said. "But I was
extremely concerned that the
protesters were going to
vocally or physically interrupt
the performances. Most of the
protestors had also reserved

tickets to the show and as the
only performer, I was con
cerned for my safety."
Fortunately, the pro
testers were as respectful of
Gelender's message as she

was of theirs.
"There were no dis
ruptions to the performance
and many of the protesters
stayed to participate in the
post-show discussion,"
Gelender said. "The Drama

Department strongly
supported the play
even through difficult
protesting, and all of
our crew stayed on
board as well, which
really speaks to the
tenacity of the people
involved with the proj
ect. I think the protest
ing may have strength
ened our sense of pur
pose and our team's
mission to stage an
incredible perform
ance."
Some performers in
Gelender's situation
might have regretted
bringing such a contro
versial play to campus.
But she says it was
absolutely worth it to

show "My Name Is Rachel
Come" to the Stanford com
munity.
"The performances
raised awareness for much
needed justice and peace ini

tiatives in the Middle East,"
Gelender said. "Additionally,
the play has been censored
across the country, and our
performances were successful
demonstrations of artistic free
speech."

STAMP'S next major
performance will be a play
about body image on
Stanford's campus. The group
is currently collecting anony
mous monologues from stu
dents about their struggles
with body image and will cre
ate a monologue and scene
series from those submis
sions. They are patterning
with the Peer Health Educator
program to stage the show,
and will be performing it in
dorms and in a theatre space
in late February during
National Eating Disorder
Awareness Week. If you
haven't yet seen a STAMP
show, make sure to stay tuned
for more information about
this performance.
