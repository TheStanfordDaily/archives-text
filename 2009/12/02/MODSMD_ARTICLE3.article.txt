# V.P'.s case file subject of error
## Gobaud learned of violation through clerical mishap 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
In an incident called "profoundly regrettable" by
the vice provost for student affairs, student body
president David Gobaud learned that his running
mate, former vice president Jay de la Torre, faced
possible suspension for a suspected Honor Code vi
olation only after he was mistakenly handed de la
Torre's case file late this summer in the Judicial Af
fairs office, where he was serving as a panelist on an
other case.

The claim, confirmed by top University officials
and de la Torre 'lO, has raised questions about how
the Office of Judicial Affairs protects students' pri
vacy, as well as communication between de la Torre
and Gobaud 'OB, M.S.' 10 before and after their elec
tion, and Gobaud's efforts as president to encourage
reform to parts of the judicial process efforts that
he says were appropriate even after he learned that
his vice president was in the Judicial Affairs process.
Gobaud offered the explanation last Friday in re
sponse to questions about when he learned that his
vice president was alleged to have plagiarized code
in a computer science class last fall an Honor
Code violation whose standard penalty is a quarter
long suspension and 40 hours of community service.
De la Torre was found responsible of the violation
by a Judicial Affairs panel, received the standard
penalty, appealed it and was denied at a final hearing
earlier this quarter. He resigned at a Nov. 11 meeting
with student leaders and President Hennessy, and

explained his suspension in a public statement the
next day.

"I was shocked," Gobaud said about the day in
late summer when, he said, a Judicial Affairs staff
member mistakenly handed him the wrong case file.
He said when he opened it and saw de la Torre's
name on the paperwork, "my jaw dropped. The per
son who handed it to me, it was obviously like, 'Wait
a minute.' I was like,'l don't think I should have this.'
She took it back."

Several top University officials have responded
to the mistake that apparently tipped Gobaud off to
his vice president's case, which, like all Judicial Af
fairs cases, is promised in the University's 1997 stu
dent judicial charter to be kept confidential by the
office.

"It is clear that multiple parties made mistakes,"
said University President John Hennessy in an e
mail to The Daily, although he stopped short of nam
ing those parties.

Provost John Etchemendy called it "a less serious
mistake than if [the office] lost the file, handed it to
somebody who wasn't on a panel," but said the inci
dent was still "a serious mistake."

"I am aware that an extremely unfortunate error
occurred when David, as a judicial affairs panelist,
was given the wrong file in preparation for a hearing
during the summer," said Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman in an e-mail to The Daily.
"As you know, confidentiality in the judicial process
is, and always has been, of utmost im
portance, and this mistake, while clear
ly unintentional, is profoundly regret
table,"

Gobaud has gone to lengths to ex
plain the constraints he faced after
learning about the case, noting that
when he became a judicial affairs pan
elist last fall, he signed the standard
confidentiality agreement saying that
"information regarding any student's
disciplinary status is not to be discussed
with anyone ... outside the judicial
hearing without the written authoriza
tion of the student."

Gobaud said that agreement meant
he could only seek advice about the in
cident from Judicial Affairs staff mem
bers and the associate vice provost who
oversees Judicial Affairs, Christine
Griffith. Griffith told The Daily that
panelists are expected to take their
concerns to office staff. Gobaud said he
believed he could not take the issue to
any other administrators.
The day he saw the case file, Gob
aud said, "Jay and I talked, and he told
me about his case."
"David sat down with me because
he was suspicious something was up,
and I told him about my situation," de
la Torre said in an e-mail to The Daily.
The two said they then started plan
ning a transition for after de la Torre's
resignation, which took place some
two months later.

"[Gobaud] was a good friend and
respected my privacy, so he didn't dis
cuss the situation with anyone I wasn't
comfortable sharing it with," de la
Torre said. Gobaud maintains he
would have faced a Fundamental Stan
dard violation charge if he told anyone
else about the case.

He resigned as a Judicial Affairs
panelist to avoid a conflict of interest.

Confidentiality, Reexamined
Griffith sat down with The Daily
and acknowledged that the mistake
has prompted a review of confidential
ity protocol in the Office of Judicial Af
fairs.

"I think given the weight of that re
sponsibility that we feel in terms of
confidentiality that's the highest
charge we have in the office, no ques
tion," she said. "Given how seriously
we take that responsibility, sure, it's
huge when there's a human error."
She described the review process
prompted by this summer's incident,
the likes of which have never, to her
knowledge, happened before,
"We review what our protocols are,
we try to determine, are there ways we
can implement better protocols? And
then we just reiterate the need [to staff]
to continue to be as committed to that
part of our work as we always have
been," Griffith said.

She said there have been no major
protocol changes, but two practices
have been reemphasized. One is re
quiring panelists to sign a confidential
ity agreement, as Gobaud did.
"The fact that they agree when they
volunteer to serve in this capacity to
keep all information confidential is a
big part of what we do," Griffith said.
The second practice is the electron
ic document system the office switched
to earlier this summer, which allows
panelists to access case files on a secure

server. Griffith said the system "serves
us well." Panelists can still request hard
copies of case files, as Gobaud did for
the case file he was supposed to pick up
that day.
Jamie Pontius-Hogan, a judicial ad
viser who works in the office, explained
the protocol for picking up file in per
son.

"We provided a kind of sealed en
velope and they [the panelist] would
walk into the front desk," she said. "The
person sitting at the front desk would
say, you know, 'I need to see your ID,'
and they'd sign the little sign-out form
and sign out the form and take the
packet."
Despite the fact that someone ap
parently gave Gobaud the wrong case
file that day, Griffith said she is confi
dent about efforts to protect students'
privacy as promised in the judicial
charter.

"No, I don't have concerns about
students' privacy being at risk," Griffith
said. "I have all the confidence that
we're doing everything we possibly can
to ensure that we don't have a repeat."
Yetting de la Torre
Gobaud and de la Torre have both
offered descriptions of their communi
cation before and after their election,
and de la Torre has explained why, de
spite facing a possible suspension be
cause of the plagiarism claim against
him, he still ran.
"At the end of the day, I just wanted
to help people," de la Torre wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "I always saw Stan
ford as this safe, perfect space. The sto
ries I heard about students with mental
health challenges feeling alone and sto
ries [of] girls getting raped really got to
me, and I wanted to do something
about it.

"I've sat down and thought about
whether or not running and staying de
spite everything I was going through
was the right decision," he added, "and
I'm still struggling with that."
He told The Daily three weeks ago,
"I thought if I made my case ex
pressed my remorse well enough to
the judicial affairs panel, I could miti
gate the consequences. I was very opti
mistic."

Gobaud said that when he was eval
uating de la Torre as a running mate
last year, he did not ask him if he had
any "outstanding judicial affairs." Gob
aud said he did, however, talk exten
sively with de la Torre about the time
commitment necessary for student
body executives, and "nothing ever
came up that caused me to have any
doubt that he would be able to fulfill his
duty."

At Tuesday's ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate meeting, Gobaud also
pointed to the Judicial Affairs language
that indicated to him it was possible for
de la Torre to delay a suspension.
According to the Judicial Affairs
Penalty Code, "responding students
are responsible for providing convinc
ing evidence that a suspension would
have an unduly harsh impact for in
stance, intense and unavoidable public
attention for the Panel's considera
tion. In rare instances, a quarter of sus
pension may be postponed for a quar
ter, or at the most, two quarters."
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 asked,"ls this
the reason, the sole reason, the an
nouncement didn't happen earlier?"
"This is one of the reasons," Gob
aud said. "He might have received an
alternate sanction."

"Did you really not advise him

against that, telling him that was prob
ably not a reasonable expectation?"
Katz asked.

"I actually did tell him 1 didn't think
it was possible," Gobaud said.
After an appeal this fall, de la
Torre's suspension remained set for
winter quarter.
Of the 367 cases brought to Judicial
Affairs between 2004 and 2007

most of which were heard, though
some were dropped one has ended
with a reduced penalty after an appeal,
according to statistics on the office's
Web site.

Gobaud's Judicial Reform

Meanwhile, students at Tuesday's
Senate meeting pressed Gobaud on his
efforts as president to encourage re
form to parts of the judicial process, ef
forts that he says were appropriate
even after he learned that his vice pres
ident faced suspension.
Gobaud said he wasn't ready to
specify what those efforts were, but
later outlined them to The Daily.
He said he had begun talking to ad
ministrators who work in or oversee
the Office of Judicial Affairs since the
spring and continued after learning
about de la Torre's case regarding
ideas to modify the judicial process.
One, he said, is to change the cur
rent practice of assigning the same ju
dicial adviser to the "complaining
party" say, a professor or T.A.—
and the responding student, which, he
said, risks confidentiality breaches.
The other idea, he said, is creating a
resource outside of the office to help
students through the "inherently
stressful" judicial process.

Gobaud said he sent an e-mail to
President Hennessy, Provost
Etchemendy and Vice Provost Board
man shortly after de la Torre's public
announcement, both explaining the sit
uation and discussing his ideas.
"Seeing Jay go through the process
helped shed light on the Judicial Af
fairs process" for him, he told The
Daily.
He also called a meeting in early fall
between some Senate and Graduate
Student Council (GSC) members at
his Munger apartment to discuss the
Board of Judicial Affairs nominee
issue that spurred weeks of disagree
ment in student government. JJiere,
too, he said he discussed his ideas for ju
dicial changes.
At Tuesday's meeting, Senator
Zachary Warma 'll, who is also The
Daily's columns editor, asked Gobaud,
"You did not see how involving legisla
tive bodies in a push against the Office
of Judicial Affairs just as your number
two is being reviewed under Judicial
Affairs, how that comes off as circum
spect?"

Gobaud said the meeting was to
discuss the board matter, not the office.

The Senate unanimously approved
Andy Parker 'll as Gobaud's nominee
to replace de la Torre as vice president.
The group also voted 8-5 to approve
Farah Abuzeid 'lO as co-chief of the ex
ecutive staff, formerly Parker's posi
tion. Appointments, however, require a
two-thirds vote, so Abuzeid remains
unconfirmed by the Undergraduate
Senate. She was approved by the GSC
two weeks ago.

about it.

He told The Daily three weeks ago,
"I thought if I made my case ex

Gobaud said that when he was eval

any "outstanding judicial affairs." Gob

commitment necessary for student
body executives, and "nothing ever
came up that caused me to have any
doubt that he would be able to fulfill his
duty."

At Tuesday's ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate meeting, Gobaud also
pointed to the Judicial Affairs language
that indicated to him it was possible for
de la Torre to delay a suspension.
According to the Judicial Affairs
Penalty Code, "responding students
are responsible for providing convinc
ing evidence that a suspension would
have an unduly harsh impact for in
stance, intense and unavoidable public
attention for the Panel's considera
tion. In rare instances, a quarter of sus
pension may be postponed for a quar
ter, or at the most, two quarters."
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 asked,"ls this
the reason, the sole reason, the an
nouncement didn't happen earlier?"
"This is one of the reasons," Gob
aud said. "He might have received an
alternate sanction."

"Did you really not advise him

against that, telling him that was prob
ably not a reasonable expectation?"
Katz asked.

"I actually did tell him 1 didn't think
it was possible," Gobaud said.
After an appeal this fall, de la
Torre's suspension remained set for
winter quarter.
Of the 367 cases brought to Judicial
Affairs between 2004 and 2007

most of which were heard, though
some were dropped one has ended
with a reduced penalty after an appeal,
according to statistics on the office's
Web site.

Gobaud's Judicial Reform

Meanwhile, students at Tuesday's
Senate meeting pressed Gobaud on his
efforts as president to encourage re
form to parts of the judicial process, ef
forts that he says were appropriate
even after he learned that his vice pres
ident faced suspension.
Gobaud said he wasn't ready to
specify what those efforts were, but
later outlined them to The Daily.
He said he had begun talking to ad
ministrators who work in or oversee
the Office of Judicial Affairs since the
spring and continued after learning
about de la Torre's case regarding
ideas to modify the judicial process.
One, he said, is to change the cur
rent practice of assigning the same ju
dicial adviser to the "complaining
party" say, a professor or T.A.—
and the responding student, which, he
said, risks confidentiality breaches.
The other idea, he said, is creating a
resource outside of the office to help
students through the "inherently
stressful" judicial process.

Gobaud said he sent an e-mail to
President Hennessy, Provost
Etchemendy and Vice Provost Board
man shortly after de la Torre's public
announcement, both explaining the sit
uation and discussing his ideas.
"Seeing Jay go through the process
helped shed light on the Judicial Af
fairs process" for him, he told The
Daily.
He also called a meeting in early fall
between some Senate and Graduate
Student Council (GSC) members at
his Munger apartment to discuss the
Board of Judicial Affairs nominee
issue that spurred weeks of disagree
ment in student government. JJiere,
too, he said he discussed his ideas for ju
dicial changes.
At Tuesday's meeting, Senator
Zachary Warma 'll, who is also The
Daily's columns editor, asked Gobaud,
"You did not see how involving legisla
tive bodies in a push against the Office
of Judicial Affairs just as your number
two is being reviewed under Judicial
Affairs, how that comes off as circum
spect?"

Gobaud said the meeting was to
discuss the board matter, not the office.

The Senate unanimously approved
Andy Parker 'll as Gobaud's nominee
to replace de la Torre as vice president.
The group also voted 8-5 to approve
Farah Abuzeid 'lO as co-chief of the ex
ecutive staff, formerly Parker's posi
tion. Appointments, however, require a
two-thirds vote, so Abuzeid remains
unconfirmed by the Undergraduate
Senate. She was approved by the GSC
two weeks ago.

In an incident called "profoundly regrettable" by
the vice provost for student affairs, student body
president David Gobaud learned that his running
mate, former vice president Jay de la Torre, faced
possible suspension for a suspected Honor Code vi
olation only after he was mistakenly handed de la
Torre's case file late this summer in the Judicial Af
fairs office, where he was serving as a panelist on an
other case.

The claim, confirmed by top University officials
and de la Torre 'lO, has raised questions about how
the Office of Judicial Affairs protects students' pri
vacy, as well as communication between de la Torre
and Gobaud 'OB, M.S.' 10 before and after their elec
tion, and Gobaud's efforts as president to encourage
reform to parts of the judicial process efforts that
he says were appropriate even after he learned that
his vice president was in the Judicial Affairs process.
Gobaud offered the explanation last Friday in re
sponse to questions about when he learned that his
vice president was alleged to have plagiarized code
in a computer science class last fall an Honor
Code violation whose standard penalty is a quarter
long suspension and 40 hours of community service.
De la Torre was found responsible of the violation
by a Judicial Affairs panel, received the standard
penalty, appealed it and was denied at a final hearing
earlier this quarter. He resigned at a Nov. 11 meeting
with student leaders and President Hennessy, and

explained his suspension in a public statement the
next day.

"I was shocked," Gobaud said about the day in
late summer when, he said, a Judicial Affairs staff
member mistakenly handed him the wrong case file.
He said when he opened it and saw de la Torre's
name on the paperwork, "my jaw dropped. The per
son who handed it to me, it was obviously like, 'Wait
a minute.' I was like,'l don't think I should have this.'
She took it back."

Several top University officials have responded
to the mistake that apparently tipped Gobaud off to
his vice president's case, which, like all Judicial Af
fairs cases, is promised in the University's 1997 stu
dent judicial charter to be kept confidential by the
office.

"It is clear that multiple parties made mistakes,"
said University President John Hennessy in an e
mail to The Daily, although he stopped short of nam
ing those parties.

Provost John Etchemendy called it "a less serious
mistake than if [the office] lost the file, handed it to
somebody who wasn't on a panel," but said the inci
dent was still "a serious mistake."

"I am aware that an extremely unfortunate error
occurred when David, as a judicial affairs panelist,
was given the wrong file in preparation for a hearing
during the summer," said Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman in an e-mail to The Daily.
"As you know, confidentiality in the judicial process
is, and always has been, of utmost im
portance, and this mistake, while clear
ly unintentional, is profoundly regret
table,"

Gobaud has gone to lengths to ex
plain the constraints he faced after
learning about the case, noting that
when he became a judicial affairs pan
elist last fall, he signed the standard
confidentiality agreement saying that
"information regarding any student's
disciplinary status is not to be discussed
with anyone ... outside the judicial
hearing without the written authoriza
tion of the student."

Gobaud said that agreement meant
he could only seek advice about the in
cident from Judicial Affairs staff mem
bers and the associate vice provost who
oversees Judicial Affairs, Christine
Griffith. Griffith told The Daily that
panelists are expected to take their
concerns to office staff. Gobaud said he
believed he could not take the issue to
any other administrators.
The day he saw the case file, Gob
aud said, "Jay and I talked, and he told
me about his case."
"David sat down with me because
he was suspicious something was up,
and I told him about my situation," de
la Torre said in an e-mail to The Daily.
The two said they then started plan
ning a transition for after de la Torre's
resignation, which took place some
two months later.

"[Gobaud] was a good friend and
respected my privacy, so he didn't dis
cuss the situation with anyone I wasn't
comfortable sharing it with," de la
Torre said. Gobaud maintains he
would have faced a Fundamental Stan
dard violation charge if he told anyone
else about the case.

He resigned as a Judicial Affairs
panelist to avoid a conflict of interest.

Confidentiality, Reexamined
Griffith sat down with The Daily
and acknowledged that the mistake
has prompted a review of confidential
ity protocol in the Office of Judicial Af
fairs.

"I think given the weight of that re
sponsibility that we feel in terms of
confidentiality that's the highest
charge we have in the office, no ques
tion," she said. "Given how seriously
we take that responsibility, sure, it's
huge when there's a human error."
She described the review process
prompted by this summer's incident,
the likes of which have never, to her
knowledge, happened before,
"We review what our protocols are,
we try to determine, are there ways we
can implement better protocols? And
then we just reiterate the need [to staff]
to continue to be as committed to that
part of our work as we always have
been," Griffith said.

She said there have been no major
protocol changes, but two practices
have been reemphasized. One is re
quiring panelists to sign a confidential
ity agreement, as Gobaud did.
"The fact that they agree when they
volunteer to serve in this capacity to
keep all information confidential is a
big part of what we do," Griffith said.
The second practice is the electron
ic document system the office switched
to earlier this summer, which allows
panelists to access case files on a secure

server. Griffith said the system "serves
us well." Panelists can still request hard
copies of case files, as Gobaud did for
the case file he was supposed to pick up
that day.
Jamie Pontius-Hogan, a judicial ad
viser who works in the office, explained
the protocol for picking up file in per
son.

"We provided a kind of sealed en
velope and they [the panelist] would
walk into the front desk," she said. "The
person sitting at the front desk would
say, you know, 'I need to see your ID,'
and they'd sign the little sign-out form
and sign out the form and take the
packet."
Despite the fact that someone ap
parently gave Gobaud the wrong case
file that day, Griffith said she is confi
dent about efforts to protect students'
privacy as promised in the judicial
charter.

"No, I don't have concerns about
students' privacy being at risk," Griffith
said. "I have all the confidence that
we're doing everything we possibly can
to ensure that we don't have a repeat."
Yetting de la Torre
Gobaud and de la Torre have both
offered descriptions of their communi
cation before and after their election,
and de la Torre has explained why, de
spite facing a possible suspension be
cause of the plagiarism claim against
him, he still ran.
"At the end of the day, I just wanted
to help people," de la Torre wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "I always saw Stan
ford as this safe, perfect space. The sto
ries I heard about students with mental
health challenges feeling alone and sto
ries [of] girls getting raped really got to
me, and I wanted to do something
about it.

"I've sat down and thought about
whether or not running and staying de

"I am aware that an extremely unfortunate error
occurred when David, as a judicial affairs panelist,
was given the wrong file in preparation for a hearing
during the summer," said Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman in an e-mail to The Daily.
"As you know, confidentiality in the judicial process
is, and always has been, of utmost im
portance, and this mistake, while clear
ly unintentional, is profoundly regret
table,"

Gobaud has gone to lengths to ex
plain the constraints he faced after
learning about the case, noting that
when he became a judicial affairs pan
elist last fall, he signed the standard
confidentiality agreement saying that
"information regarding any student's
disciplinary status is not to be discussed
with anyone ... outside the judicial
hearing without the written authoriza
tion of the student."

Gobaud said that agreement meant
he could only seek advice about the in
cident from Judicial Affairs staff mem
bers and the associate vice provost who
oversees Judicial Affairs, Christine
Griffith. Griffith told The Daily that
panelists are expected to take their
concerns to office staff. Gobaud said he
believed he could not take the issue to
any other administrators.
The day he saw the case file, Gob
aud said, "Jay and I talked, and he told
me about his case."
"David sat down with me because
he was suspicious something was up,
and I told him about my situation," de
la Torre said in an e-mail to The Daily.
The two said they then started plan
ning a transition for after de la Torre's
resignation, which took place some
two months later.

"[Gobaud] was a good friend and
respected my privacy, so he didn't dis
cuss the situation with anyone I wasn't
comfortable sharing it with," de la
Torre said. Gobaud maintains he
would have faced a Fundamental Stan
dard violation charge if he told anyone
else about the case.

He resigned as a Judicial Affairs
panelist to avoid a conflict of interest.

Confidentiality, Reexamined
Griffith sat down with The Daily
and acknowledged that the mistake
has prompted a review of confidential
ity protocol in the Office of Judicial Af
fairs.

"I think given the weight of that re
sponsibility that we feel in terms of
confidentiality that's the highest
charge we have in the office, no ques
tion," she said. "Given how seriously
we take that responsibility, sure, it's
huge when there's a human error."
She described the review process
prompted by this summer's incident,
the likes of which have never, to her
knowledge, happened before,
"We review what our protocols are,
we try to determine, are there ways we
can implement better protocols? And
then we just reiterate the need [to staff]
to continue to be as committed to that
part of our work as we always have
been," Griffith said.

She said there have been no major
protocol changes, but two practices
have been reemphasized. One is re
quiring panelists to sign a confidential
ity agreement, as Gobaud did.
"The fact that they agree when they
volunteer to serve in this capacity to
keep all information confidential is a
big part of what we do," Griffith said.
The second practice is the electron
ic document system the office switched
to earlier this summer, which allows
panelists to access case files on a secure

server. Griffith said the system "serves
us well." Panelists can still request hard
copies of case files, as Gobaud did for
the case file he was supposed to pick up
that day.
Jamie Pontius-Hogan, a judicial ad
viser who works in the office, explained
the protocol for picking up file in per
son.

"We provided a kind of sealed en
velope and they [the panelist] would
walk into the front desk," she said. "The
person sitting at the front desk would
say, you know, 'I need to see your ID,'
and they'd sign the little sign-out form
and sign out the form and take the
packet."
Despite the fact that someone ap
parently gave Gobaud the wrong case
file that day, Griffith said she is confi
dent about efforts to protect students'
privacy as promised in the judicial
charter.

"No, I don't have concerns about
students' privacy being at risk," Griffith
said. "I have all the confidence that
we're doing everything we possibly can
to ensure that we don't have a repeat."
Yetting de la Torre
Gobaud and de la Torre have both
offered descriptions of their communi
cation before and after their election,
and de la Torre has explained why, de
spite facing a possible suspension be
cause of the plagiarism claim against
him, he still ran.
"At the end of the day, I just wanted
to help people," de la Torre wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "I always saw Stan
ford as this safe, perfect space. The sto
ries I heard about students with mental
health challenges feeling alone and sto
ries [of] girls getting raped really got to
me, and I wanted to do something
about it.

"I've sat down and thought about
whether or not running and staying de
spite everything I was going through
was the right decision," he added, "and
I'm still struggling with that."
He told The Daily three weeks ago,
"I thought if I made my case ex
pressed my remorse well enough to
the judicial affairs panel, I could miti
gate the consequences. I was very opti
mistic."

Gobaud said that when he was eval
uating de la Torre as a running mate
last year, he did not ask him if he had
any "outstanding judicial affairs." Gob
aud said he did, however, talk exten
sively with de la Torre about the time
commitment necessary for student
body executives, and "nothing ever
came up that caused me to have any
doubt that he would be able to fulfill his
duty."

At Tuesday's ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate meeting, Gobaud also
pointed to the Judicial Affairs language
that indicated to him it was possible for
de la Torre to delay a suspension.
According to the Judicial Affairs
Penalty Code, "responding students
are responsible for providing convinc
ing evidence that a suspension would
have an unduly harsh impact for in
stance, intense and unavoidable public
attention for the Panel's considera
tion. In rare instances, a quarter of sus
pension may be postponed for a quar
ter, or at the most, two quarters."
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 asked,"ls this
the reason, the sole reason, the an
nouncement didn't happen earlier?"
"This is one of the reasons," Gob
aud said. "He might have received an
alternate sanction."

"Did you really not advise him

against that, telling him that was prob
ably not a reasonable expectation?"
Katz asked.

"I actually did tell him 1 didn't think
it was possible," Gobaud said.
After an appeal this fall, de la
Torre's suspension remained set for
winter quarter.
Of the 367 cases brought to Judicial
Affairs between 2004 and 2007

most of which were heard, though
some were dropped one has ended
with a reduced penalty after an appeal,
according to statistics on the office's
Web site.

Gobaud's Judicial Reform

Meanwhile, students at Tuesday's
Senate meeting pressed Gobaud on his
efforts as president to encourage re
form to parts of the judicial process, ef
forts that he says were appropriate
even after he learned that his vice pres
ident faced suspension.
Gobaud said he wasn't ready to
specify what those efforts were, but
later outlined them to The Daily.
He said he had begun talking to ad
ministrators who work in or oversee
the Office of Judicial Affairs since the
spring and continued after learning
about de la Torre's case regarding
ideas to modify the judicial process.
One, he said, is to change the cur
rent practice of assigning the same ju
dicial adviser to the "complaining
party" say, a professor or T.A.—
and the responding student, which, he
said, risks confidentiality breaches.
The other idea, he said, is creating a
resource outside of the office to help
students through the "inherently
stressful" judicial process.

Gobaud said he sent an e-mail to
President Hennessy, Provost
Etchemendy and Vice Provost Board
man shortly after de la Torre's public
announcement, both explaining the sit
uation and discussing his ideas.
"Seeing Jay go through the process
helped shed light on the Judicial Af
fairs process" for him, he told The
Daily.
He also called a meeting in early fall
between some Senate and Graduate
Student Council (GSC) members at
his Munger apartment to discuss the
Board of Judicial Affairs nominee
issue that spurred weeks of disagree
ment in student government. JJiere,
too, he said he discussed his ideas for ju
dicial changes.
At Tuesday's meeting, Senator
Zachary Warma 'll, who is also The
Daily's columns editor, asked Gobaud,
"You did not see how involving legisla
tive bodies in a push against the Office
of Judicial Affairs just as your number
two is being reviewed under Judicial
Affairs, how that comes off as circum
spect?"

Gobaud said the meeting was to
discuss the board matter, not the office.

The Senate unanimously approved
Andy Parker 'll as Gobaud's nominee
to replace de la Torre as vice president.
The group also voted 8-5 to approve
Farah Abuzeid 'lO as co-chief of the ex
ecutive staff, formerly Parker's posi
tion. Appointments, however, require a
two-thirds vote, so Abuzeid remains
unconfirmed by the Undergraduate
Senate. She was approved by the GSC
two weeks ago.
