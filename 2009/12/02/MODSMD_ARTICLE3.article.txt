# V.P'.s case file subject of error
## Gobaud learned of violation through clerical mishap 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
In an incident called "profoundly regrettable" by
the vice provost for student affairs, student body
president David Gobaud learned that his running
mate, former vice president Jay de la Torre, faced
possible suspension for a suspected Honor Code vi
olation only after he was mistakenly handed de la
Torre's case file late this summer in the Judicial Af
fairs office, where he was serving as a panelist on an
other case.

The claim, confirmed by top University officials
and de la Torre 'lO, has raised questions about how
the Office of Judicial Affairs protects students' pri
vacy, as well as communication between de la Torre
and Gobaud 'OB, M.S.' 10 before and after their elec
tion, and Gobaud's efforts as president to encourage
reform to parts of the judicial process efforts that
he says were appropriate even after he learned that
his vice president was in the Judicial Affairs process.
Gobaud offered the explanation last Friday in re
sponse to questions about when he learned that his
vice president was alleged to have plagiarized code
in a computer science class last fall an Honor
Code violation whose standard penalty is a quarter
long suspension and 40 hours of community service.
De la Torre was found responsible of the violation
by a Judicial Affairs panel, received the standard
penalty, appealed it and was denied at a final hearing
earlier this quarter. He resigned at a Nov. 11 meeting
with student leaders and President Hennessy, and

explained his suspension in a public statement the
next day.

"I was shocked," Gobaud said about the day in
late summer when, he said, a Judicial Affairs staff
member mistakenly handed him the wrong case file.
He said when he opened it and saw de la Torre's
name on the paperwork, "my jaw dropped. The per
son who handed it to me, it was obviously like, 'Wait
a minute.' I was like,'l don't think I should have this.'
She took it back."

Several top University officials have responded
to the mistake that apparently tipped Gobaud off to
his vice president's case, which, like all Judicial Af
fairs cases, is promised in the University's 1997 stu
dent judicial charter to be kept confidential by the
office.

"It is clear that multiple parties made mistakes,"
said University President John Hennessy in an e
mail to The Daily, although he stopped short of nam
ing those parties.

Provost John Etchemendy called it "a less serious
mistake than if [the office] lost the file, handed it to
somebody who wasn't on a panel," but said the inci
dent was still "a serious mistake."

"I am aware that an extremely unfortunate error
occurred when David, as a judicial affairs panelist,
was given the wrong file in preparation for a hearing
during the summer," said Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman in an e-mail to The Daily.
"As you know, confidentiality in the judicial process
