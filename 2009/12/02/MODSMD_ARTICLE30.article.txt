The Road: Viggo Mortensen and Charlize
Theron star in this thriller about a man and his
son trying to survive in post-apocalyptic
America. With nothing but the clothes on
their backs and a pistol, they have to learn to
survive by any means necessary. Based on the
best-selling book, this movie is already gar
nering Oscar buzz, (opens Nov. 25)
Sherlock Holmes: Elementary, my dear
Watson. Robert Downey, Jr. stars as every
body's favorite detective, with Jude Law as
the legendary sidekick. Many are concerned
that director Guy Ritchie may be too heavy
handed to handle this literary classic, but our
hopes are high. It doesn't hurt that this brand
new take is filled with enough eye-candy for
everyone, with hottie Rachel McAdams added
to the already dynamic duo. (opens Dec. 25)

Avatar: One of the most anticipated films of
all time, super-director James Cameron
brings to life a science fiction epic for the
ages. "Avatar" tells the story of a paraplegic
Marine who is sent to the moon Pandora.
There, he encounters the tribal Na'vi (yes, the
blue creatures you see in the commercials)
and falls in love with a Na'vi princess.
Whether a political, environmental or societal
commentary, "Avatar" promises to be a huge
blockbuster, so buy your midnight tickets now
it is definitely going to sell out fast.

"J" f you love romantic comedies . . .
Did You Hear About The Morgans?: In the
past year or so, this genre has been in a seri-

ous slump. Every movie has followed a simi
lar formula with predictable characters.
Hopefully, "The Morgans" will be different.
Starring rom-com king Hugh Grant and Sarah
Jessica Parker, this movie tells the tale of an
unhappy marriage between two very wealthy
workaholics. Things take a turn when they
witness a murder and are relocated from NYC
to podunk Wyoming. It seems potentially
stale, but also potentially very funny, (opens

It's Complicated: From the director of
"Something's Gotta Give" comes almost the
exact same movie. Luckily, there is an all-star
cast to give the senior citizen romance anoth
er go-around. Starring Meryl Streep, Alec
Baldwin and Steve Martin, "It's Complicated"
provides a love triangle and lots of laughs.

This would definitely be one to take your
mother, grandmother or older sister to and
earn a lot of points, (opens Dec. 25)

Nine: With the help of the director of
"Chicago," this Tony Award-winning musical
is coming to the silver screen. With perform
ances from Daniel Day Lewis, Nicole
Kidman, Penelope Cruz and Judy Dench, just
to name a few, this movie is short on anything
but star power. Singing, dancing and fishnets
will be out in full-force, as Daniel Day Lewis
stars as a director dealing with multiple rela
tionships with very sexy women, (opens Dec.

The Lovely Bones: Based on the bestselling
novel, this movie tells the story of a young
girl who was raped and murdered, and is
telling her story from heaven. Directed by the
critically lauded Peter Jackson and starring
Oscar-nominee Saiorse Ronan, this movie is
expected to perform very well at the box
office. While quite different from "The Lord
of the Rings" trilogy, Jackson is expected to
bring a tragic tale to the screen in a surreal
and beautiful way. Just watching the trailer
made us cry. (opens Dec. 25)
