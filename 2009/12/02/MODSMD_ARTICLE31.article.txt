As students head home this holiday season, you may
get bored without the myriad of things to do on cam
pus. So instead of watching the ball drop on TV or
seeing fireworks in your hometown, why don't you try
something new? All across the country, people will be bring
ing in 2010 with flair. Here are some ideas on how to shake
up your New Years.

Watch an odd ball drop

Forget the ball drop in New York City. People across
the country drop all kinds of things on New Years, and
Florida has some crazy traditions. In Key West, Sloppy Joe's
Bar drops a conch shell at midnight. Also on Duval Street,
Bourbon St. Pub will celebrate their 13th year of the notori
ous Red High Heel Drop. Local drag queen Sushi is lowered
down from the roof of the bar on the stroke of midnight in a
giant rouge pump. You could head on over to the Schooner
Wharf Bar, where a pirate wench is lowered from the mast
of a tall ship while cannons are blasted.
Florida too far? In Elmore, Ohio they lower an 18-
foot sausage to celebrate the New Year. Making you hungry?
In Lebanon, Penn. they lower bologna that is actually edible.
The bologna gets bigger and bigger each year. In 2008, it
was a 150 pounds and 12-feet long. Of course, we can't for
get the sweetest drop of them all. The "Peach Drop" takes
place annually in Atlanta, Ga. at Underground Atlanta it's
the second largest New Years event in the country!

v™
Some societies let you re-live the past before bring
ing in the New Year. In Rhode Island, Astors' Beechwood

Mansion is holding a New Year's Eve Murder Mystery party.
The Web site suggests that guests sit down to watch a per
formance of "Romeo and Juliet," which is interrupted midway
by the death of a guest. Guests will spend the night searching
the premises for clues as everybody tries to find out the mur
derer. If that seems too tame, you can always head out to a
club for a Roaring '2os party. They're happening all over the
country, including Bourbon and Branch in San Francisco and
Lumen in Chicago, which will include prohibition posters,
speakeasy-style gambling and a live three-piece brass band
among other '2os necessities.

Practice some wacky worldly traditions
Whether you're willing to travel or wanting to stay at
home, you can still celebrate New Year's Eve in a worldly
way. Go Dutch! Jump off a chair at midnight like they do in
Denmark in an effort to expel evil spirits. If you'd rather be
close to the dead at the stroke of 12 visit Talca, Chile. For the
past decade, people there have been going to the town ceme
tery to celebrate the New Year with their deceased relatives
and friends. People in Mexico also like to reconnect with spir
its on New Year's. Too morbid? Do as the Germans do and

watch "Dinner for One," a British TV skit that Germans watch
every New Year which, ironically enough, has never been
aired in an English-speaking country.

Have fun this New Year's Eve and don't be afraid to
get a little crazy. After your night of revelry, you're going to
want to cool off — so take a Polar Bear Plunge. All across the
country on New Year's Day, people run into the freezing

waters of local lakes, rivers and oceans. It's the perfect way to
wear off your hangover, and many polar bear dips are done to
raise money for charities and causes. Think of it as your first
good deed of the New Year you've just celebrated.
