# Remote Nomad's Top 10 Shows of the Decade

### – liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
In less than a month, we
will have entered the
decade Y2K+lO. While
many respectable TV journal
ists are writing lists of the
best shows of the decade, I'd
like to give a shout out to the
then-shows that influenced
my sufficiently emotional and
TV-centered youth from ages
10 to 19. Time Magazine may
tell you that this decade was
"The Decade From Hell" in a
most histrionic of fashions,
but at least there was some
equally histrionic TV to dis
tract us.

10 • Lizzie McGuire,

Disney Channel 2001-2004
You could say that
Lizzie, Gordo and Miranda
were the triumvirate for the
new ages, fulfilling the void
left by the dissolution of

Augustus, Marc Antony and
that rando Lepidus. The
McGuire family dynamic res
onated with me in the tumult
of middle school, so much so

that my screenname was for a

time LizzieMcStark. My sev
enth-grade English teacher
also signed my middle school
yearbook with a quotation
from the ever articulate
Ethan, "You rock. Don't ever
change." A fitting anthem for
the standout in a field of
excellent Disney Channel
programming ("Proud
Family," "Even Stevens").

9 • As Told By Ginger,
Nickelodeon 2000-2004
Another great show
about middle school angst
and residual class conflict in
the 21st century. Ginger was
the Daria of middle school
(another great show that
began in 1997 and ended in
2002), and what show is
more 2000s than a Macy
Gray theme song?

Arrested Development,
Fox 2003-2006

Technically, I didn't

watch this show when it aired
on Fox, so I fueled its
untimely demise while alter
nating between channels 24
(Disney) and 25
(Nickelodeon). Its legacy,
which has lived on so gener
ously through Flulu longer
than any other show, ushered
in a defining characteristic of
the second half of the decade:
awkward humor. "The
Office," which began in 2005
as a humble adaptation of a
British TV show, certainly
helped, but you can't top the
audacity of "Arrested
Development" and Tobias
Funke.

7 • American Dreams,
NBC 2002-2005
This show began my
addiction to TV, so, mom, if
you have to blame someone,
blame Brittany Snow and this
"soap opera" about the '6os.
If you're not smart enough
for "Mad Men," as I wasn't
in middle school and
arguably still am not,

"American Dreams" is like
"19605: 101, " with all those
civil rights, Beatles and short
skirts. "American Dreams"
was a great family tale of
beautiful children and trou
bled parents. Plus, the show's
format around "American
Bandstand" could be
described as a precursor to
"Glee." Meg, Brittany Snow's
high school character, was the
big sister I never got to have
and the blonde dancer I never
turned into.
Joe Millionaire, Fox
2003
Before those readers
with standards start to groan,
know that I chose this show
because it was the first time I
experienced a full-on obses
sion with a reality TV show.
The format of "The
Bachelor" never appealed to
me, but the deceit, sex and
tall women of "Joe
Millionaire" distill the
essence of Fox reality pro
gramming perfectly. I'm
shocked that, according to
Wikipedia, the first season
lasted only six episodes
because I was riveted. The
failure of the second season
also epitomizes the TV indus
try mercurial and heart
less.
5 • Sex and The City, HBO
1998-2004
I think this one is fair
game because, even though it
started in the '9os, it became
an obsession of my genera
tion in the early 'oos. My
best friend and I rented the
DVDs from the video store
against her mom's wishes (we
WALKED to the video store
to get it, we were so curious)

and forgot to return them.
When the video store called
to ask her where they had
gone, she berated them for
suggesting that she would
rent something that promoted
promiscuity and moral
depravity. And yet, that was
always the appeal. My insa
tiable curiosity about "Sex
and The City" also introduced
me to the world of illegal
video streaming on the
Internet.
4 • Gilmore Girls, WB
2000-2007
A more age-appropri
ate version of "Sex and the
City," with the maternal and
fdial duty angle to suppress
any need for onscreen sex.
The consummate MILF,
Lorelai, and her doe-eyed

daughter, also Lorelai, never
made teenage pregnancy look
so appealing. The show is cri
tiqued for the distorted reality
of its light-speed dialogue,
but that is another trait of TV
humor for the decade. As a
private school girl my whole
life, the world of Chilton,
Paris Geller and Harvard/Yale
admissions convinced me that
I would become a prep school
student and love it. Although
California ultimately seduced
me from the Rory path . . .
think of how Yale's admis
sions numbers must have
gone up when she chose the
school. Yes, the show started
to flail when Rory cut her
hair and went to college;
however, I think this show
defines my generation of
women more effectively than
any other.
