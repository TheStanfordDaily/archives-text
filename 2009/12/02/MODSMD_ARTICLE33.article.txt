## WOMEN ADVANCE TO FINAL FOUR 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
After its most convincing display in the
NCAA Tournament thus far, the No. 1 Stanford
women's soccer team is back in the College Cup
for the second consecutive year.
The Card (24-0-0) swept aside a talented
Boston College team the two seed in the re
gion Friday night at Cagan Stadium, winning
3-1 with a controlled possession style that kept
Stanford in the driver's seat all match. It was a
far cry from the team's first three tournament
matches, in which the Cardinal looked uncom
fortable and off its game for large stretches.
"This was our best performance of the tour
nament," said Stanford Head Coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "We played great possession soccer and
scored three great goals."

You couldn't have blamed the team for los
ing its composure when Boston College (18-4-
2) got off to a dream start not even two minutes
into the match. BC's sophomore Julia
Bouchelle received a pass near the top of the
box before dribbling to her left and unleashing
a low shot with her left foot. Stanford junior
goalkeeper Kira Maker flung herself to the left,
but could only watch as the ball caromed off the
far post and into the net to give the Eagles a
shock lead. Just one minute and 35 seconds had
ticked off the clock.

Despite giving up its first goal in NCAA
tournament play, however, Stanford was not
rattled. The team went right back on the offen
sive and equalized play just 50 seconds later. Ju
nior forward Christen Press saw her long range
effort hit the crossbar, but senior Kelley O'Hara
was in perfect position to tap in the rebound and
make it 1-1 less than three minutes into the
match. Surprisingly, it was the first goal of the
postseason for the record-setting forward
but it would not be her last.

The teams were back at level pegging, but
it was the Cardinal that looked likely to grab
the lead. O'Hara nearly added another in the
23rd minute, but was narrowly beaten to a
loose ball by Eagles' sophomore keeper Jil
lian Mastroianni, and Press shot just wide
after cutting between three defenders in the

box two minutes later.
The pressure paid off in the 27th minute,
though, when sophomore Lindsay Taylor
flicked on a long ball and Press slipped it past
the backline to O'Hara, who was making the
run. The senior outraced the BC defenders and
blasted a shot over the on-rushing Mastroianni
to make the score 2-1. The goal pushed her sin
gle-season goals record to 25 and also gave
Press the single-season mark for assists with 15
on the year.
Press came close to getting a goal of her own
numerous times before the end of the half, but
was unable to find the back of the net. Still, Stan
ford was dominating the match, outshooting BC
18-3 in the first half. The Eagles weren't com
pletely out of the game Maker had to make a
fine one-on-one stop on BC's freshman Victoria
DiMartino in the 43rd minute but the Stan
ford backline kept the Eagles' opportunities to
a minimum.
Boston College fired another warning shot
to begin the second half In the 49th minute, Ea
gles freshman fullback Kristen Mewis swung in
a cross from the left that found senior Gina Di-
Martino Victoria's sister at the top of the
box. The midfielder sent her shot toward the
upper corner of the goal, but once again Maker
was there for the save.

The remainder of the match was all Stanford,
as the Card outshot BC 12-1 over the final 40
minutes. O'Hara came close to completing a hat
trick multiple times, but it was Press who would
finish off the scoring, providing the knockout
punch in the 85th minute.
Senior defender Alicia Jenkins played a long
ball out of the back and Press used a burst of
speed to charge past the BC backline before
calmly slotting low past Mastroianni. The goal
her 20th of the year made it 3-1 and effec
tively punched Stanford's ticket to College Sta
tion.Texas for next weekend's College Cup.

Much of the attention afterward was on
Stanford's two goal scorers, but O'Hara was
quick to credit the defensive effort as well.
"Boston College is an amazing team and our
defense held them to five shots [for the entire
match]," O'Hara said, who along with the
rest of the senior class played her final match

on the Farm. "Everyone did their jobs tonight."
Ratcliffe echoed his star's comments after
the comprehensive victory.
"This was a really strong performance
against a good BC team," he said. "I'm very
proud."
The Cardinal will now face conference
rival UCLA on Friday, since the Bruins (21-2-
1) defeated Portland 2-1 to claim their seventh
consecutive College Cup berth. The game will
be a rematch of the Oct. 18 conference match,
which Stanford won 2-0 at home. That match
was the key as the Card ended UCLA's run of
six straight Pacific-10 Conference champi
onships and the Bruins are sure to be out for
revenge.
UCLA and Stanford will be joined in Texas
by defending national champions North Caroli

na (21-3-1) and last year's runners up Notre
Dame (21-3-1), which makes this year's final
four the exact same as last year's. Last year's
Cardinal team Stanford's first to make the
College Cup since 1993 lost 1-0 to Notre
Dame in the semifinals, but the 2009 version is
confident that this year will be different.
"We've been there before we have expe
rience," O'Hara said. "Hopefully [that experi
ence] will lead us to two wins next weekend."
Friday's semifinal match will kick off at 2:30
p.m. PT and will be broadcast by ESPN2 and
ESPNU.The national championship match will
be played at 10 a.m. on Sunday and will be
shown on ESPN2 and ESPN36O.com.
