# CARDINAL ROLLS
## Women's basketball perfect heading into toughest stretch of the season 
### NATE ADAMS TOM TAYLOR 
As the referee threw the ball up into the air at tip-oft all the statistics
looked to be in favor of a dominant Cardinal weekend. While there were
rough spots on the way, that is exactly what Stanford fans got as the Car
dinal battled its way to a 60-41 win against Utah last Friday and a 105-74
victory over Gonzaga on Sunday.
Stanford came into the Utah game riding its best start in five years,
with four straight wins to open the regular season (plus two wins in pre
season) and with an unbeaten record (then 10-0) against the Utes.The
Cardinal is currently ranked No. 2 in the nation in both the Associated
Press Poll and the ESPN/USAToday Poll. Stanford has at least shared the
Pacific-10 Conference title for nine straight years and consistently per
formed well in the postseason, leading the team to have high hopes of
challenging for another NCAA trophy in March.
But a closer look at the Cardinal's last meeting with the Utes, in 2007,
tells a different story; that day, it took double overtime to separate the two
teams. Stanford eventually eked it out 81-77 after junior Melanie Murphy
kept the game alive with a three-pointer to tie the game in the last seconds
of regulation.
This time around the Cardinal finished slightly more comfortably
with a 19-point win, but it was still a tough, hard-fought game.
Early on, both teams struggled with shot accuracy but as the game
progressed, Stanford (6-0) pulled in front, ending the first half up 24-11. It
might not have been pretty, but the No. 2 Cardinal showed its strength in
the first half, playing swarming defense and effectively stifling the Utah
offense.

Undeterred, the Utes (2-3) came out much stronger after the break,
doubling their first half score in the first five minutes to close within seven
points. With the momentum firmly in Utah's court, someone needed to
step up for the Card to put the game away.
Several players answered the call. Junior forward Kayla Pedersen
scored three baskets in just two minutes to turn the game back in the Car
dinal's favor, eventually achieving her second consecutive double-dou
ble. Sophomore forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike and junior guard
Jeanette Pohlen both made crucial steals, rebounds and buckets.

Despite seeing her team take command again as time wound down,
Stanford Head Coach Tara VanDerveer was somewhat underwhelmed

with her team's performance.
"That wasn't a game that I'm really excited about," VanDerveer said.
"I don't think we played real inspired, but we got some really good effort
from some of our team."
Any team can beat any other on its day, but only the very best, the
championship contenders, can have a bad day and still come away with a
win.
"I just think that we just had a rough day and I think every team is
going to have one of those days," Pedersen said. "As long as we stay and
encourage each other and know that we have a lot more that we can give,
I think that that's the main thing that we take away from this game."
"We just stuck after it and I'm proud of our team for doing that," she
added.
Highly rated senior center Jayne Appel exemplified this attitude, as
she recovered from a bad flu enough to play 21 minutes, grabbing six re
bounds in the process.
