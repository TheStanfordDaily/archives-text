# MEN'S SOCCER
## Stanford falls in Sweet Sixteen 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Having beaten St. Mary's in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament, the men's
soccer team went into the Thanksgiving
break set to play UC-Irvine on Nov. 22, the
first Sunday of the break, with a possible en
counter with Akron on Nov. 29.

While most students were heading
home, the Cardinal traveled to the
Anteaters' home needing a victory to keep
the season going and continue their run in
the NCAA tournament. With Daniel

Leon's first-half goal and a very solid effort
by the Stanford defense against a team
seeded 16th and ranked No. 17 by the
NSCAA, the team made it to the Sweet Six
teen in its first trip to the postseason tourna
ment in six years.
It was a great 1-0 victory for the Card,
but lined up what was probably going to be
the toughest day all year.
The third round match against Akron
was never going to be easy. The Zips came
into the match unbeaten in 21 games this
season, having registered 15 shutouts, con
ceded only seven goals and scored an as

tounding 45. There's a very good reason
they're currently ranked No. 1 in every poll
across the nation.
Statistics like those made even the
Card's rather solid season statistics with
28 goals in 19 games, a total of nine shutouts
and a complete turnaround from the frus
trating 2008 season look below par.
Stanford was the underdog, the outside
chance.

"First and foremost, I think Akron is a
legitimate No. 1 team in the country," said
Stanford Head Coach Bret Simon.
"They're as good as any team I've
seen in many, many years of college
coaching."
In the first half, the game certainly
seemed to mirror Simon's pinion.
Akron had the lion's share of the pos
session, while Stanford's few attack
ing opportunities were thwarted by
intercepted passes. The Zips' efforts
were rewarded with two goals from
re-starts, while the Cardinal strug
gled. By game's end, the score was 2-
0 Akron.
"The energy we had to expend
trying to hold on to a 1-0 lead on the
road was tremendous and I think

playing a second game against an
even better team was just too much,"
Simon explained. "I don't think we
were as sharp as we were a week
ago."

Statistically, the second half was
much better for the Card. Good saves
by senior goalkeeper John Moore
kept out further scores by the Zips,
while the team opened up the game.
"We just went for broke a little bit
and we just pressured higher up the
field and the guys just wouldn't give
in," Simon said. "[But] ultimately, we
had to score a goal to get back into it
and we couldn't quite do that."
Akron may now go on to win the
national title, and it may be a consola
tion to the Stanford team if it lost to the
eventual NCAA champions. Howev
er, the most important thing for the
team should be its marked improve
ment from the frustrating 2008 season.
"I think the players worked very
hard, and they made a big commit
ment in the off-season and during the
summer," Simon said. "They contin
ued their commitment during the fall
and that helped turn around some
very, very close difficult losses from
last year and changed those into
close challenging wins this year."

Last year, they posted a losing 4-
11-3 record, including a total of nine
1-0 loses. Now they are sitting on a
winning 12-6-2 and will hope to take
the momentum and experiences of
this year forward.
"First of all, we've tasted success,"
Simon said, "a good regular season
and winning a couple of games in the
NCAA tournament, so that's impor
tant for the program.
"If anything beyond that, we were
able to play the best team in college
soccer right now," he added, "and
they do some things very we 11...

their defensive commitment is fan
tastic, their composure on the ball is
exceptional. We can take things like
that and emulate them, and that can
help us in our out-of-season training
to take the team to a higher level."
Though this season might have fi
nally ended in disappointment, the
players will soon be looking forward:
January will bring a new training
regime, and redemption may well lie
in 2010. Pre-season games begin in
mid-August, and the next season
starts Sept. 1, just nine months away.
