## Stanford falls in Sweet Sixteen 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Having beaten St. Mary's in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament, the men's
soccer team went into the Thanksgiving
break set to play UC-Irvine on Nov. 22, the
first Sunday of the break, with a possible en
counter with Akron on Nov. 29.

While most students were heading
home, the Cardinal traveled to the
Anteaters' home needing a victory to keep
the season going and continue their run in
the NCAA tournament. With Daniel

Leon's first-half goal and a very solid effort
by the Stanford defense against a team
seeded 16th and ranked No. 17 by the
NSCAA, the team made it to the Sweet Six
teen in its first trip to the postseason tourna
ment in six years.
It was a great 1-0 victory for the Card,
but lined up what was probably going to be
the toughest day all year.
The third round match against Akron
was never going to be easy. The Zips came
into the match unbeaten in 21 games this
season, having registered 15 shutouts, con
ceded only seven goals and scored an as

tounding 45. There's a very good reason
they're currently ranked No. 1 in every poll
across the nation.
Statistics like those made even the
Card's rather solid season statistics with
28 goals in 19 games, a total of nine shutouts
and a complete turnaround from the frus
trating 2008 season look below par.
Stanford was the underdog, the outside
chance.

"First and foremost, I think Akron is a
legitimate No. 1 team in the country," said
