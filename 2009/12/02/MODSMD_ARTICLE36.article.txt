## Men lose overtime war with Kentucky Missed free throws doom the Cardinal in Cancun Challenge 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
After falling at the buzzer to Oral Roberts on Nov. 18,
Stanford men's basketball knew that Thanksgiving would
bring anything but a "break" for the team. In fact, the Car
dinal was in for a series of battles not the least of which
was against the football team for fan turnout on the day of
Big Game, plus the battles on the court with Florida
A&M, Virginia, No. 5 Kentucky and Portland State be
fore classes resumed.

So, Stanford (4-3) went to work, notching a 30-point
win over the Rattlers of Florida A&M (0-7) on Nov. 21, de
spite losing fans at the half to a less successful appearance
by the football team at Big Game. Sophomore guard Jere
my Green led all scorers with a season-high 21 points,
while senior Landry Fields earned his first double-double
of the season with 15 points and 11 rebounds along with a
season-high six assists.
Sophomore forward Jack Trotter and guards Drew
Shiller, Jarrett Mann and Emmanuel Igbinosa all reached
double figures in scoring as well, helping the Cardinal to
lead by as much as 34 partway through the second half and
to earn an eventual 99-69 victory.
Fields believes that the shared scoring in the Card's
most dominant win to date is a sign of Stanford's contin
ued improvement as individual players and as a group.
"Playing with each guy, I think the rotation is starting
to really set in," Fields, Stanford's team captain, said.' A lot
of guys are really starting to find their identity out there..
. I feel like everyone's getting comfortable with their
roles."

Coach Johnny Dawkins agreed, noting that he's seen
the most improvement this season in Stanford's young
players.

"Some guys ducked into the lineup when they proba
bly weren't expecting it with Josh [Owens] around,"
Dawkins said. "To see those guys really step up and com
pete for us at a really good level and to see those guys con
tinuing to get better when I'm speaking of those guys
I'm speaking of the Zimmermanns, the Trotters, the Matei
Daians those guys at every practice have really come
and battled, you can see the improvement in them."
Stanford rode the momentum from the win all the way
to Cancun, Mexico, where it met the University of Virginia
(4-2) in the Cancun Challenge on Nov. 24. The matchup
was fairly even, with six ties and 13 lead changes over the
course of the contest. Both teams struggled in shooting
the Cardinal shot 38.9 percent from the floor to UVA's
37.8 but Fields lifted the Stanford offense with 25
points and 13 boards and found some help from Green,
the only other Cardinal player to contribute in double dig
its, who added 10 points. Half of Green's points came in
the final 5 minutes of play, helping Stanford to pull away
from the Cavaliers after being down 47-
46 with 4:52 remaining.
At 4:42, Mann scored on a lay-up and
Green followed with a lay-up of his own
and then a long ball, along with a lay-up
and two made foul shots by Fields to fin
ish the 11-5 run by the Cardinal to win
the game by the score 0f57-52.
The win against Virginia placed
Stanford in the tournament's champi
onship game against the fifth-ranked
University of Kentucky (5-o).lhe Wild
cats jumped out to what would be their
largest lead of the meeting, holding a
19-11 advantage eight and a half min
utes into the game. However, the sec
ond of Green's five three-pointers at
12:21 jumpstarted an 11-0 ran by the
Card to give Stanford a three-point
edge.

By the hall, the teams had already
seen six ties, but a final burst by the Car
dinal earned the team a 38-32 buffer at
halftime.

With Kentucky expected to domi
nate Stanford, Dawkins said that his
team's confidence in itself allowed
Stanford to hang with one of the na
tion's top teams.

"I think our kids believe that we can
be competitive and that's the first step
believing," he said.
Throughout the second half, that be
lief and the Cardinal's play, hung tough.
Despite shooting only 31.8 percent,
Stanford maintained a slight lead until
6:42, when a lay-up by Kentucky for
ward Patrick Patterson put the Wild
cats up by one.
In the final three minutes, the teams
tied four more times, but with nine sec
onds left, the Cardinal held a two-point
lead. A pair of missed free throws by
Mann failed to clinch the victory for
Stanford and a foul by sophomore An
drew Zimmermann gave Kentucky the
chance to make everything even.
Clutch conversions by guard John Wall
—he went eight-for-eight from the
stripe on the night to help earn his
game-high 26 points made it 63-all
and the teams went to overtime.

In the extra period, however, the
young Stanford team crumbled under a
combination of inexperience and fa
tigue. The Cardinal did not score a sin
gle field goal in the remaining five min
utes and the team was outscored 10-2 in
overtime, falling 73-65.
Stanford was led by Fields's third
consecutive double-double with 23
points and 13 rebounds and Green
added another 18 in the loss. No other
Stanford players reached double digits.

Dawkins blames some of Stanford's
shortcomings thus far on youth. But he
also acknowledges that this team has
more potential than it has yet reached.
"We're not exactly an old team,"
Dawkins said. "There are a few things
that we're still trying to see with our
guys. We do have an idea of what our
guys can do. That's what this time of the
season is about for us it's a growth
period. I think we're learning more ...
and there are a few things that we need

to clean up, but I think we're moving in
the right direction."
Back on campus, Stanford looked to
rebound against Portland State (1-4) on
Nov. 29. Again, play stayed relatively
close throughout the first half and the
Vikings' eight-of-13 threes and 65
percent overall shooting certainly
helped keep it that way. In fact, Stan
ford only had a two-point lead until
Fields stepped up and hit a three of his
own with one second left to close the
period, 43-38.

Dawkins was less-than-thrilled with
the Cardinal's performance, though he
gave credit to Portland State for its of
fensive success in the first half.

"They made us play the way they
wanted to play," he said." We didn't play
as well as I would've liked to see us play
in the first half. I thought our second
half defense was better... and that's a
credit to our guys in making some ad
justments and being really focused.
[But] this is one of the best shooting
teams that I've seen in the last couple
years. They really shot the ball well."
Luckily for the Card, the Vikings'
shooting fell to 37.9 percent after the
break and the team went only 2-for-ll
from long range. Meanwhile, Stanford's
shooting jumped to 69.6 percent and
the game became increasingly one
sided.

The Cardinal finished with an 83-64
victory and was again led in scoring by
Fields with 25 points. Green, Shiller and
Trotter added 19,11 and 10 points, re

spectively. Despite the improved scor
ing, though, Dawkins saw room for im
provement and he hopes that the next
two weeks when the team breaks for
finals will give Stanford some time
to prepare.

"I think we have to continue to get
better defensively," he said.' 'We have to
get better on the boards —we battle
pretty good, but I think we can battle
even better there, so those are areas I
think that need to be cleaned up the
most. Offensively, we're still working on
our spacing and some timing issues and
you know we've got to clean that up. So,
I'm definitely not satisfied with where
we are. I think there's a lot of room for
us to improve some of the intangibles of
the game really. And I think if we make
those improvements, we can be a better
ball club."

"Like coach said, there's a lot to im
prove on," Fields agreed. "I think we are
improving and I feel like these next two
weeks we'll get better in a lot of aspects
of the game, in a lot of our deficiencies.
But I'm liking how it's going right now,
but we can't be satisfied with anything,
especially with this team because our
margin for error is so small. We just
have to keep getting better."

Stanford will have a chance to test
these improvements when it returns on
Dec. 13 to take on UC-Davis at Maples
Pavilion at 7 p.m.

Despite leading a very strong Kentucky Wildcats team with just seconds
remaining in regulation, the Stanford men's basketball team was unable
to hang on, missing clutch free throws down the stretch and failing to
find its offense in the overttime period.
