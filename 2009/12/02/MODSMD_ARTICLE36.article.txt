### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
After falling at the buzzer to Oral Roberts on Nov. 18,
Stanford men's basketball knew that Thanksgiving would
bring anything but a "break" for the team. In fact, the Car
dinal was in for a series of battles not the least of which
was against the football team for fan turnout on the day of
Big Game, plus the battles on the court with Florida
A&M, Virginia, No. 5 Kentucky and Portland State be
fore classes resumed.

So, Stanford (4-3) went to work, notching a 30-point
win over the Rattlers of Florida A&M (0-7) on Nov. 21, de
spite losing fans at the half to a less successful appearance
by the football team at Big Game. Sophomore guard Jere
my Green led all scorers with a season-high 21 points,
while senior Landry Fields earned his first double-double
of the season with 15 points and 11 rebounds along with a
season-high six assists.
Sophomore forward Jack Trotter and guards Drew
Shiller, Jarrett Mann and Emmanuel Igbinosa all reached
double figures in scoring as well, helping the Cardinal to
lead by as much as 34 partway through the second half and
to earn an eventual 99-69 victory.
Fields believes that the shared scoring in the Card's
most dominant win to date is a sign of Stanford's contin
ued improvement as individual players and as a group.
"Playing with each guy, I think the rotation is starting
to really set in," Fields, Stanford's team captain, said.' A lot
of guys are really starting to find their identity out there..
. I feel like everyone's getting comfortable with their
roles."

Coach Johnny Dawkins agreed, noting that he's seen
the most improvement this season in Stanford's young
players.

"Some guys ducked into the lineup when they proba
bly weren't expecting it with Josh [Owens] around,"
Dawkins said. "To see those guys really step up and com
pete for us at a really good level and to see those guys con
tinuing to get better when I'm speaking of those guys
I'm speaking of the Zimmermanns, the Trotters, the Matei
Daians those guys at every practice have really come
and battled, you can see the improvement in them."
Stanford rode the momentum from the win all the way
to Cancun, Mexico, where it met the University of Virginia
(4-2) in the Cancun Challenge on Nov. 24. The matchup
was fairly even, with six ties and 13 lead changes over the
course of the contest. Both teams struggled in shooting
the Cardinal shot 38.9 percent from the floor to UVA's
37.8 but Fields lifted the Stanford offense with 25
points and 13 boards and found some help from Green,
the only other Cardinal player to contribute in double dig
its, who added 10 points. Half of Green's points came in
the final 5 minutes of play, helping Stanford to pull away
