# Toby the Terrific
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Toby Gerhart once was a talent
ed player on the Stanford foot
ball team. After 12 games, he is a
name and a player that no Stan
ford fan will forget.
Stanford has not had many players
like Toby Gerhart, and he has rightfully
surpassed all the great Stanford run
ning backs this year after three months
of running, gunning, leg-churning, pow
erful football. His record-breaking,
award-winning season has been special
for him and for all Stanford fans. It was
exciting to follow his season this year
the Cardinal faithful enjoyed having
him on their side, following and relish
ing in his success week after week.
Toby is a breath of fresh air in an at
mosphere of many overzealous, atten
tion-loving, "me"-type players. He has
had an outstanding season and what is
even more satisfying is the way he did it
with a no-nonsense, classy, shut-up
and-play attitude. He just rolled along,
ran hard, played tough and didn't com
plain. His reward is a place atop the
Stanford and Pac-10 record books, ap
pearances in college football highlight
reels, and a true legacy on the Farm.
I believe I speak for all Stanford
fans when I say that Toby has been the
man for Stanford football this year. It
has been remarkable to see him rise up
and achieve so much after struggling
through the first part of his Stanford ca
reer. His freshman year he started once
and ran for 375 yards on the year.
Sophomore year he suffered a season
ending knee injury in the first game of
the season. After a tough first two sea
sons in which the team's combined
record was 5-19, Gerhart only got
stronger. Junior year was his coming
out year with 1,136 yards and 15 touch
downs. We all know what happened
this year. He came to play from day one
and four years later, he is still running as
hard as he was the first day of his Stan
ford career.

Although I cannot forget to men
tion the players around him that were
vital to his success this year I'm
looking at the offensive line and quar
terback here it was Toby who hit the
holes this year as hard as anyone, with
physicality, resolve and confidence. He
refused to go down at first contact and
refused to capitulate, making the de
fense swarm him to get him down. The
offensive line or quarterback can't real
ly help you with that. It came from in
side his mind and his heart no de
fender was too big or too strong or too
tough for him.
Gerhart's stats might have been
even better were it not for what I be
lieve was panic play-calling in the Wake
Forest and Cal games. He only carried
the ball six times in the second half at
Wake Forest in a game where the
Demon Deacons scored 21 second-half
points and Stanford none. And just two
weeks ago against Cal, when Stanford
had first-and-10 from the 13-yard line
with under two minutes left and a
chance to win the game, a play to the
All-American bruiser was not called.
But it was the games where he carried
the team on his back that made his sea
son. He torched possible Rose Bowl
participant Oregon for 223 yards and
three touchdowns. He ran over USC
for 178 and three. Notre Dame
watched him go for 205 and three. He
met pay dirt four times against Cal.
When called upon, he took the team in
his hands and he never failed to deliver.

Toby has also been a victim of East
Coast-biased sports reporters and
media that have not given him the cred
it he deserves and a real chance in the
Heisman race. It seems like it pains
broadcasters and sportswriters, save a
few, to put Toby in the Heisman discus
sion with stats that would virtually lock
the Heisman for anyone from the SEC,
USC, Ohio State or Texas.

Today, Gerhart is better known
throughout the nation than he was at
the beginning of the year, but in the
world of college football and all the
media coverage, he still lagged. He
dominated the Pac-10 this year and was
one of the nation's biggest playmakers.
He should have been elevated earlier
in the year by the media like they did
Tim Tebow, Mark Ingram and Colt
McCoy. Instead of hearing more about
Gerhart's numbers and ability, we
watched 20 interviews of Florida's
Tebow. More people should have seen
and appreciated the kind of player and

person Toby really was. He was the
beating heart of the Stanford offense:
rushing, gushing through all aspects of
the offense, giving it life and zest. With
out him, Stanford's season probably
would have been a lot different. He
may very well have been the single
most important player for a team this
season.

Toby will be a finalist for the Heis
man trophy. It is unfortunate that it
took 12 games for the nation to finally
realize what kind of player he was this
year and how valuable he was to the
Stanford team. Becoming a Heisman
finalist is an honorable and memorable
accomplishment for Gerhart and the
Stanford program. Toby deserves that
ticket to New York and to be in the dis
cussion of the nation's best players.
Plain and simple, the guy deserves
some limelight and should absolutely
be recognized for the complete player
he was this year.
But a testament to Toby's character

is how the disappointing lack of hype
and credit fazed him throughout the
year: not one bit. The guy still went out
and played hard every game, every
down, even if he didn't get the ball.
When he scored a touchdown the ball
did not go flying and he did not break
into dance. If he ever thought he should
have gotten the ball in any particular
moment, you would never have known
it. He ran hard and got up when he was
hit down. He was a strong competitor
and a punishing runner, but was gra
cious in defeat. He had the great with
out the glamour. It was a pleasure to
watch such a player achieve so much
success with so much humility. It's a big
part of why we rooted for him.
So thank you, Toby, for making this
a season to remember for Stanford
football. Thank you for your passion,
drive, competitiveness and tenacity.
You were a huge reason that Stanford
emerged from the doldrums this sea
son and regained respect. All your ac
colades are well-deserve, and the hon
ors couldn't be bestowed upon a better
person. Thank you for giving Cardinal
fans the thrills without the frills. You
deserve everything you get from here
on out. which will only be good. Be

cause of you, it has been great to be a
Stanford fan.

Regardless of how everything pans
out the rest of the way, Toby has had a
season for the records and for the
memories. Stanford students and Stan
ford fans will remember this season as
the one where Gerhart dominated
whenever he stepped on the field, no
matter who lined up across from him.
Fans will remember the "Toby" chants
as he powered his way through the line.
The extra cheers when he was hit but
carried multiple defenders a few more
yards. The short yardage plays when
everyone in the stadium knew who the
ball was going to. The "I Heart Ger
Heart" sign in the south end zone. The
big runs and catches. The 27 touch
downs (don't forget about that passing
one). The man he was on the field. The
man he was off the field. Stanford foot
ball in 2009 was the season of Toby
Gerhart. For the Cardinal and for Toby,
it was a season to remember, and a sea
son unlike any other.

tears while he reminisces about Toby.
