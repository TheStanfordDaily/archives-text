# Toby the Terrific
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Toby Gerhart once was a talent
ed player on the Stanford foot
ball team. After 12 games, he is a
name and a player that no Stan
ford fan will forget.
Stanford has not had many players
like Toby Gerhart, and he has rightfully
surpassed all the great Stanford run
ning backs this year after three months
of running, gunning, leg-churning, pow
erful football. His record-breaking,
award-winning season has been special
for him and for all Stanford fans. It was
exciting to follow his season this year
the Cardinal faithful enjoyed having
him on their side, following and relish
ing in his success week after week.
Toby is a breath of fresh air in an at
mosphere of many overzealous, atten
tion-loving, "me"-type players. He has
had an outstanding season and what is
even more satisfying is the way he did it
with a no-nonsense, classy, shut-up
and-play attitude. He just rolled along,
ran hard, played tough and didn't com
plain. His reward is a place atop the
Stanford and Pac-10 record books, ap
pearances in college football highlight
reels, and a true legacy on the Farm.
I believe I speak for all Stanford
fans when I say that Toby has been the
man for Stanford football this year. It
has been remarkable to see him rise up
and achieve so much after struggling
through the first part of his Stanford ca
reer. His freshman year he started once
and ran for 375 yards on the year.
Sophomore year he suffered a season
ending knee injury in the first game of
the season. After a tough first two sea
sons in which the team's combined
record was 5-19, Gerhart only got
stronger. Junior year was his coming
out year with 1,136 yards and 15 touch
downs. We all know what happened
this year. He came to play from day one
and four years later, he is still running as
hard as he was the first day of his Stan
ford career.

Although I cannot forget to men
tion the players around him that were
vital to his success this year I'm
looking at the offensive line and quar
terback here it was Toby who hit the
holes this year as hard as anyone, with
physicality, resolve and confidence. He
refused to go down at first contact and
refused to capitulate, making the de
fense swarm him to get him down. The
offensive line or quarterback can't real
ly help you with that. It came from in
side his mind and his heart no de
fender was too big or too strong or too
tough for him.
Gerhart's stats might have been
even better were it not for what I be
lieve was panic play-calling in the Wake
Forest and Cal games. He only carried
the ball six times in the second half at
Wake Forest in a game where the
Demon Deacons scored 21 second-half
points and Stanford none. And just two
weeks ago against Cal, when Stanford
had first-and-10 from the 13-yard line
with under two minutes left and a
chance to win the game, a play to the
All-American bruiser was not called.
But it was the games where he carried
the team on his back that made his sea
son. He torched possible Rose Bowl
participant Oregon for 223 yards and
three touchdowns. He ran over USC
for 178 and three. Notre Dame
watched him go for 205 and three. He
met pay dirt four times against Cal.
When called upon, he took the team in
his hands and he never failed to deliver.

Toby has also been a victim of East
Coast-biased sports reporters and
media that have not given him the cred
it he deserves and a real chance in the
Heisman race. It seems like it pains
broadcasters and sportswriters, save a
few, to put Toby in the Heisman discus
sion with stats that would virtually lock
the Heisman for anyone from the SEC,
USC, Ohio State or Texas.

Today, Gerhart is better known
throughout the nation than he was at
the beginning of the year, but in the
world of college football and all the
media coverage, he still lagged. He
dominated the Pac-10 this year and was
one of the nation's biggest playmakers.
He should have been elevated earlier
in the year by the media like they did
Tim Tebow, Mark Ingram and Colt
McCoy. Instead of hearing more about
Gerhart's numbers and ability, we
watched 20 interviews of Florida's
Tebow. More people should have seen
and appreciated the kind of player and
