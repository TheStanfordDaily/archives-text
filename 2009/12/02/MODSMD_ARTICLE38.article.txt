# Volleyball wins Big Spike, Pac-10
## 
### CHRIS JUHNKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team is on
roll and it couldn't have come at a better time.
Heading into the NCAA tournament, where it
is the No. 4 overall seed, Stanford (21-7,14-4 Pa
cific-10) has won its last six matches, including a
thrilling five-set win over Cal on Friday in the
"Big Spike."
Playing in front of a home crowd of more
than 5,000 people on Friday in Maples Pavilion,
the Card engineered an amazing come-from
behind victory to beat the Golden Bears (18-10,
11-7 Pac-10) in five sets, 23-25,18-25,25-23,25-
20,15-4. The win gave Stanford its fourth con
secutive Pac-10 championship and boosted the
team's momentum heading into the NCAA
tournament.

"I think it was extra special winning it this
year just because nobody expected it from us,"
said junior outside hitter Alix Klineman. "How
ever, making it to the Final Four and winning a
national championship is our ultimate goal and
we knew that, to be really feeling confident
going into the playoffs, we needed to win this
match."

Klineman led the team in kills in the match,
setting a new career high with 33. The team also
got strong contributions from junior Cassidy
Lichtman, who recorded her ninth triple dou
ble of the year with 13 kills, 18 assists and 10 digs
and senior Janet Okogbaa, who had 12 kills on
Senior Night.
"Winning the Pac-10 for the fourth time in a
row was huge for us," said senior outside hitter
Alex Fisher. "In the beginning of the preseason,
we made a list of team goals. It's nice to be able
to check this one off the list." Fisher also added
that she was voting "Klineman for Heisman"
after her performance on Friday.
Although the Cardinal got the final result it
wanted, the start of the match was a different
story. Stanford came out on top backed by the

raucous Maples crowd and took a 4-1 lead. Cal
cut the lead to one with a quick run, but the
Card responded and stayed on top, 9-5. Stan
ford continued to maintain its lead before a 4-0
run by the Bears cut the Stanford lead to one,
19-18 and resulted in a timeout by Stanford
head coach John Dunning. Another 4-0 run by
Cal would give the Bears the set, 23-25 and put
a damper on the excitement of the Cardinal
fans.

In the second set, Cal used its momentum to
take an early 4-1 lead. The Card went on a run,
including a kill by Fisher, which tied the score at
eight all, but found itself down again after a 6-1
run by the Bears. After Stanford cut the lead to
one on a kill by Lichtman and an ace by fresh
man Karissa Cook, Cal posted seven straight
points to take a 21-13 lead. The Bears took the
second set 18-25, leaving the Card in a tough
position in its last game of the season.
"Coming back into the locker room after
losing the first two sets was tough," Fisher said.
"Rather than talking about technical elements
of the fix, we talked about what this match
meant to us. [Sophomore] Katherine Sebastian
said it best: 'We are not going to let Cal stop us
from winning the Pac-10. Not Cal. And not in
three [games].'"
Additionally, the Card shifted its lineup
slightly heading into the third set, putting soph
omore Stephanie Browne in as a middle. The
third set started with back and forth play, as the
teams traded points on the way to a seven all tie.
The Bears pulled ahead on a 4-0 run, but two
kills by Okogbaa and a block by Klineman and
Browne reduced Cal's lead to two. Following a
run by the Bears, which put them up 16-21, the
match was almost out of reach. However, feed
ing off the energy of the crowd, the Card went
on a 5-1 run, including a kill by Browne, cutting
the lead to one and forcing Cal to call a timeout.
Out of the timeout, a kill by Klineman led to a
set point for Stanford and Cook served anoth
er ace to give the Card the set, 25-23, to avoid

the sweep.
"I think the comeback at the end of the third
game is what turned it around for us," Lichtman
said. "We just kept fighting in that game and the
adrenaline and momentum from it carried over
into the rest of the match."
Using the third set win as the turning point,
the Card took a 7-4 lead to open the fourth set.
Following a Cal run, the lead switched back and
forth until a 6-3 Bears run gave them a 16-19
lead. However, three kills by Klineman and one
apiece by Lichtman and freshman Hayley Spel
man, put Stanford back on top 21-19. Behind
two more Lichtman kills, the Cardinal would
even the match at two sets apiece, taking the
fourth 25-20.

In the fifth set, Stanford carried its momen
tum to an early 5-2 lead and never relinquished
it. Klineman recorded seven kills in the set and
Stanford won the set, 15-4 and the match, cap
turing its fourth Pac-10 championship.
"I think each of our last six wins are really
important because we got them in different
ways," Klineman said. "Some matches we dom
inated, others we struggled and in all of them
we won. We really learned to fight no matter
what the circumstances were and find away to

win, which will be really important come tour
nament time."
Now the Cardinal heads into the NCAA
tournament where the team will be playing at
home for the first and second rounds as the No.
1 seed in the Stanford regional. Stanford will
head to the tournament for the 29th straight
time, joining Penn State as the only two teams
to have made it to all 29 NCAA Women's Vol
leyball tournaments.

"The NCAA tournament is do or die so we
just want to keep winning," Lichstman said. "I
think we are hitting our stride at the right time
and we just need to play each match as it comes.
At this point there are not many easy wins so
we are going to have to fight for everyone."
The Cardinal will face Long Island (21-13)
on Friday at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion, with the
winner of that match facing the winner of a
match between Saint Mary's (22-4) and UC
Santa Barbara (22-7) on Saturday at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion. Stanford will be looking to
claim its seventh NCAA title and 15th appear
ance in the national title match when play be

losing the first two sets was tough," Fisher said.
"Rather than talking about technical elements
of the fix, we talked about what this match
meant to us. [Sophomore] Katherine Sebastian
said it best: 'We are not going to let Cal stop us
from winning the Pac-10. Not Cal. And not in
three [games].'"
Additionally, the Card shifted its lineup
slightly heading into the third set, putting soph
omore Stephanie Browne in as a middle. The
third set started with back and forth play, as the
teams traded points on the way to a seven all tie.
The Bears pulled ahead on a 4-0 run, but two
kills by Okogbaa and a block by Klineman and
Browne reduced Cal's lead to two. Following a
run by the Bears, which put them up 16-21, the
match was almost out of reach. However, feed
ing off the energy of the crowd, the Card went
on a 5-1 run, including a kill by Browne, cutting
the lead to one and forcing Cal to call a timeout.
Out of the timeout, a kill by Klineman led to a
set point for Stanford and Cook served anoth
er ace to give the Card the set, 25-23, to avoid

the sweep.
"I think the comeback at the end of the third
game is what turned it around for us," Lichtman
said. "We just kept fighting in that game and the
adrenaline and momentum from it carried over
into the rest of the match."
Using the third set win as the turning point,
the Card took a 7-4 lead to open the fourth set.
Following a Cal run, the lead switched back and
forth until a 6-3 Bears run gave them a 16-19
lead. However, three kills by Klineman and one
apiece by Lichtman and freshman Hayley Spel
man, put Stanford back on top 21-19. Behind
two more Lichtman kills, the Cardinal would
even the match at two sets apiece, taking the
fourth 25-20.

In the fifth set, Stanford carried its momen
tum to an early 5-2 lead and never relinquished
it. Klineman recorded seven kills in the set and
Stanford won the set, 15-4 and the match, cap
turing its fourth Pac-10 championship.
"I think each of our last six wins are really
important because we got them in different
ways," Klineman said. "Some matches we dom
inated, others we struggled and in all of them
we won. We really learned to fight no matter
what the circumstances were and find away to

win, which will be really important come tour
nament time."
Now the Cardinal heads into the NCAA
tournament where the team will be playing at
home for the first and second rounds as the No.
1 seed in the Stanford regional. Stanford will
head to the tournament for the 29th straight
time, joining Penn State as the only two teams
to have made it to all 29 NCAA Women's Vol
leyball tournaments.

"The NCAA tournament is do or die so we
just want to keep winning," Lichstman said. "I
think we are hitting our stride at the right time
and we just need to play each match as it comes.
At this point there are not many easy wins so
we are going to have to fight for everyone."
The Cardinal will face Long Island (21-13)
on Friday at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion, with the
winner of that match facing the winner of a
match between Saint Mary's (22-4) and UC
Santa Barbara (22-7) on Saturday at 7 p.m. at

The Stanford women's volleyball team executed a thrilling comeback against Cal in this
year's Big Spike, coming from two sets down to win both the match and the Pac-10 title.
The Stanford women's volleyball team is on
roll and it couldn't have come at a better time.
Heading into the NCAA tournament, where it
is the No. 4 overall seed, Stanford (21-7,14-4 Pa
cific-10) has won its last six matches, including a
thrilling five-set win over Cal on Friday in the
"Big Spike."
Playing in front of a home crowd of more
than 5,000 people on Friday in Maples Pavilion,
the Card engineered an amazing come-from
behind victory to beat the Golden Bears (18-10,
11-7 Pac-10) in five sets, 23-25,18-25,25-23,25-
20,15-4. The win gave Stanford its fourth con
secutive Pac-10 championship and boosted the
team's momentum heading into the NCAA
tournament.

"I think it was extra special winning it this
year just because nobody expected it from us,"
said junior outside hitter Alix Klineman. "How
ever, making it to the Final Four and winning a
national championship is our ultimate goal and
we knew that, to be really feeling confident
going into the playoffs, we needed to win this
match."

Klineman led the team in kills in the match,
setting a new career high with 33. The team also
got strong contributions from junior Cassidy
Lichtman, who recorded her ninth triple dou
ble of the year with 13 kills, 18 assists and 10 digs
and senior Janet Okogbaa, who had 12 kills on
Senior Night.
"Winning the Pac-10 for the fourth time in a
row was huge for us," said senior outside hitter
Alex Fisher. "In the beginning of the preseason,
we made a list of team goals. It's nice to be able
to check this one off the list." Fisher also added
that she was voting "Klineman for Heisman"
after her performance on Friday.
Although the Cardinal got the final result it
wanted, the start of the match was a different
story. Stanford came out on top backed by the

raucous Maples crowd and took a 4-1 lead. Cal
cut the lead to one with a quick run, but the
Card responded and stayed on top, 9-5. Stan
ford continued to maintain its lead before a 4-0
run by the Bears cut the Stanford lead to one,
19-18 and resulted in a timeout by Stanford
head coach John Dunning. Another 4-0 run by
Cal would give the Bears the set, 23-25 and put
a damper on the excitement of the Cardinal
fans.

In the second set, Cal used its momentum to
take an early 4-1 lead. The Card went on a run,
including a kill by Fisher, which tied the score at
eight all, but found itself down again after a 6-1
run by the Bears. After Stanford cut the lead to
one on a kill by Lichtman and an ace by fresh
man Karissa Cook, Cal posted seven straight
points to take a 21-13 lead. The Bears took the
second set 18-25, leaving the Card in a tough
position in its last game of the season.
"Coming back into the locker room after
losing the first two sets was tough," Fisher said.
"Rather than talking about technical elements
