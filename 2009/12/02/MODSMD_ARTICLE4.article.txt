## University will maintain international student aid 
### JANE LEPHAM STAFF WRITER 
As the endowment tumbled by 27
percent, University officials vowed to
maintain Stanford's current financial
aid system. Lesser known, however,
was their promise to uphold the same
policies for international students on
financial aid.
According to Director of Finan
cial Aid Karen Cooper, the Univer
sity will uphold the same pledge in fi
nancial aid security to international
students, who comprise approxi
mately seven percent of the total un
dergraduate population.
The actual percentage of interna

tional students on aid is nearly half
that of the total undergrads ap
proximately 25 percent of interna
tional students receive need-based
aid directly from the University,
compared to 48 percent of all under
graduates.

Resident vs. Nonresident Aid
The difference in financial aid
distribution results from the lack of a
need-blind admissions policy for in
ternational students.

Unlike for students holding U.S.
Citizen or Permanent Resident sta
tus, admission officers must consider
an international student's ability to
pay when making admission deci
sions.

According to Cooper, internation
al students must indicate during the
admissions process whether or not
they will be applying for aid.

"If international students do not
apply for aid at the time of admission,
they do so with the understanding that
they will not be considered for assis
tance from the University throughout
their undergraduate career," she
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.

Yet once international students do
decide to apply for aid, they provide
family financial data to the University,
much as domestic students do.

According to the University's fi
nancial aid Web site, both groups must
fill out the CSS Profile when applying
for aid. And while domestic students
submit the Free Application for Fed
eral Student Aid (FAFSA), interna
tional students submit the Interna
tional Student Certification of Fi
nances in the FAFSA's place.
"We [then] attempt to make a sim
ilar analysis of the student's family's fi
nancial strength in order to determine
eligibility for aid as we do with domes
tic students," Cooper said.

Increasing Aid Numbers
Due to increased funding and do
nations over the past several years, the
University has been able to admit an
increasing number of international
students with financial need.

"Over the last five to 10 years, we
have steadily been increasing the
number of international students ad
mitted with aid eligibility each year, as
funding from our very generous
donors has increased for this pur
pose," Cooper said.
While the University financial
budget has swelled 85 percent since
the 2005-06 academic year the
amount of total aid increased from
$60.8 million to $112.5 million the
amount of institutional aid awarded to
international students has also seen a
64 percent increase, from $5.5 million
to $9.1 million, over this four-year pe
riod.

And just as it does with domestic
students, the University relies on a
combination of the endowment in
come, annual gift funds (The Stanford
Fund) and general University funds to

provide aid to international students
who have demonstrated need.

One key difference in funding,
however, is that the University does
not receive any federal or state grant
funds to pay for international student
aid.

"Checking the Box"

Director of Admission Shawn Ab
bott maintained that the admissions
process is not much different for inter
national students than it is for domes
tic students.

"They still move through the same
exact evaluation and selection process
as all students," Abbott wrote in an e
mail to The Daily, although he ac
knowledged that it is more competi
tive for international students who
need aid to be admitted.

Many international applicants
therefore do not apply for aid out of
fear that it will affect their chances of
admission into the University.
"With the need-blind financial aid,
I would probably be somewhat un
willing to check that box [requesting
aid] because I feel that might affect my
admission," said Fon Kulalert 'l2, who
attends Stanford on a Thai govern
ment scholarship. "I would think that
as an international student, I would
have to be super extraordinary for top
American schools, like Stanford, to ac
cept me and even pay for me to come
here."

Similarly, Kin Fucharoen 'l2, who
is on scholarship from the Aeronauti
cal Radio of Thailand, an air traffic
service provider for Thailand's air
space, believes that his admission
would have been affected had he re
quested aid.

"Given that Stanford cannot be
need-blind for international stu
dents," he said, "I would have felt re
luctant to check the box requesting
the aid because I would have felt that
my application did not stand out
enough for the admissions team to ig
nore my financial background."
However, Pak Hin Lee 'l2, an in
ternational student from Hong Kong,
chose to apply for aid due to his finan
cial need, even though he understood
that his decision would increase the
competition he faced in the applicant
pool.

"It wasn't at all a hard decision for
me to apply for aid even though I
knew it would affect my admission
because it was basically impossible for
my family to afford my studies here
without any forms of aid or scholar
ship," Lee said. "I was fortunate
enough to be admitted, and Stanford
guaranteed to provide me with finan
cial aid that would meet my need."

Strings Attached

International students who did not
apply for University-funded financial
aid, meanwhile, pay their University
bill one of two ways: through outside
scholarships or out of their own ex
penses.

Kulalert and Fucharoen had the
privilege of receiving full scholarships
from the Thai government, which al
lowed them to pay for Stanford with
out worrying about the financial aid
application.
Many of the scholarships available
for international students, however,
come with constraints.

Although Kulalert's scholarship
covers her undergraduate and post

graduate tuition in full, she is required
to return to Thailand for the same
amount of time spent studying
abroad. Likewise, Fucharoen had his
major predetermined and must work
at least 14 years for his sponsor.
Despite the many conditions of
his contract, Fucharoen maintains
that he may have abandoned the op
portunity to leave Thailand for col
lege if he did not have the scholar
ship, as the cost of attending Stanford
is roughly six to seven times that of
Thai universities.

"Some people may think 14 years
is a lot, but I like [the] aviation indus
try, so getting to work in the air traffic
service sector is more than I can ask
for, hence I'm really happy with this
deal," Fucharoen said.

"Again, some people don't like the
life-bonding contract, but I think it's a
very good deal as long as you choose
to apply for the sponsor that you real
ly want to work for," he added.

Other students in the international
community rely on their parents to
fund their education or find work to
pay their own way through school.
"My parents paid for my tuition

actually, my mom pays the bulk of it,"
said Shine Zaw-Aung 'll.

Some students also work while at
Stanford.
"Many of us find various on-cam
pus jobs to relieve the burden on liv
ing expenses," Lee added. "After all,
sometimes we may want to eat outside
or watch a movie, and those cost
money."
What the Future Holds
Although Martha Trujillo, director
of financial aid for the School of Med
icine, indicated that the medical
school had once discussed extending
its need-blind financial aid policy to
include international students, both
she and Cooper cited the fallen en
dowment and current economic state
as reasons why the University cannot
do so at this time.
"There are no immediate plans to
extend our need-blind admission poli
cies to international students," Coop
er said. "The cost is prohibitive at this
time."

"There are no immediate plans to
extend our need-blind admission poli

As the endowment tumbled by 27
percent, University officials vowed to
maintain Stanford's current financial
aid system. Lesser known, however,
was their promise to uphold the same
policies for international students on
financial aid.
According to Director of Finan
cial Aid Karen Cooper, the Univer
sity will uphold the same pledge in fi
nancial aid security to international
students, who comprise approxi
mately seven percent of the total un
dergraduate population.
The actual percentage of interna

tional students on aid is nearly half
that of the total undergrads ap
proximately 25 percent of interna
tional students receive need-based
aid directly from the University,
compared to 48 percent of all under
graduates.

Resident vs. Nonresident Aid
The difference in financial aid
distribution results from the lack of a
need-blind admissions policy for in
ternational students.

Unlike for students holding U.S.
Citizen or Permanent Resident sta
tus, admission officers must consider
an international student's ability to
pay when making admission deci
sions.

According to Cooper, internation
al students must indicate during the
admissions process whether or not
they will be applying for aid.

"If international students do not
apply for aid at the time of admission,
they do so with the understanding that
they will not be considered for assis
tance from the University throughout
their undergraduate career," she
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.

Yet once international students do
decide to apply for aid, they provide
family financial data to the University,
much as domestic students do.

According to the University's fi
nancial aid Web site, both groups must
fill out the CSS Profile when applying
for aid. And while domestic students
submit the Free Application for Fed
eral Student Aid (FAFSA), interna
tional students submit the Interna
tional Student Certification of Fi
nances in the FAFSA's place.
"We [then] attempt to make a sim
ilar analysis of the student's family's fi
nancial strength in order to determine
eligibility for aid as we do with domes
tic students," Cooper said.

Increasing Aid Numbers
Due to increased funding and do
nations over the past several years, the
University has been able to admit an
increasing number of international
students with financial need.

"Over the last five to 10 years, we
have steadily been increasing the
number of international students ad
mitted with aid eligibility each year, as
funding from our very generous
donors has increased for this pur
pose," Cooper said.
While the University financial
budget has swelled 85 percent since
the 2005-06 academic year the
amount of total aid increased from
$60.8 million to $112.5 million the
amount of institutional aid awarded to
international students has also seen a
64 percent increase, from $5.5 million
to $9.1 million, over this four-year pe
riod.

And just as it does with domestic
students, the University relies on a
combination of the endowment in
come, annual gift funds (The Stanford
Fund) and general University funds to

provide aid to international students
who have demonstrated need.

One key difference in funding,
however, is that the University does
not receive any federal or state grant
funds to pay for international student
aid.

"Checking the Box"

Director of Admission Shawn Ab
bott maintained that the admissions
process is not much different for inter
national students than it is for domes
tic students.

"They still move through the same
exact evaluation and selection process
as all students," Abbott wrote in an e
mail to The Daily, although he ac
knowledged that it is more competi
tive for international students who
need aid to be admitted.

Many international applicants
therefore do not apply for aid out of
fear that it will affect their chances of
admission into the University.
"With the need-blind financial aid,
I would probably be somewhat un
willing to check that box [requesting
aid] because I feel that might affect my
admission," said Fon Kulalert 'l2, who
attends Stanford on a Thai govern
ment scholarship. "I would think that
as an international student, I would
have to be super extraordinary for top
American schools, like Stanford, to ac
cept me and even pay for me to come
here."

Similarly, Kin Fucharoen 'l2, who
is on scholarship from the Aeronauti
cal Radio of Thailand, an air traffic
service provider for Thailand's air
space, believes that his admission
would have been affected had he re
quested aid.

"Given that Stanford cannot be
need-blind for international stu
dents," he said, "I would have felt re
luctant to check the box requesting
the aid because I would have felt that
my application did not stand out
enough for the admissions team to ig
nore my financial background."
However, Pak Hin Lee 'l2, an in
ternational student from Hong Kong,
chose to apply for aid due to his finan
cial need, even though he understood
that his decision would increase the
competition he faced in the applicant
pool.

"It wasn't at all a hard decision for
me to apply for aid even though I
knew it would affect my admission
because it was basically impossible for
my family to afford my studies here
without any forms of aid or scholar
ship," Lee said. "I was fortunate
enough to be admitted, and Stanford
guaranteed to provide me with finan
cial aid that would meet my need."

Strings Attached

International students who did not
apply for University-funded financial
aid, meanwhile, pay their University
bill one of two ways: through outside
scholarships or out of their own ex
penses.

Kulalert and Fucharoen had the
privilege of receiving full scholarships
from the Thai government, which al
lowed them to pay for Stanford with
out worrying about the financial aid
application.
Many of the scholarships available
for international students, however,
come with constraints.

Although Kulalert's scholarship
covers her undergraduate and post

graduate tuition in full, she is required
to return to Thailand for the same
amount of time spent studying
abroad. Likewise, Fucharoen had his
major predetermined and must work
at least 14 years for his sponsor.
Despite the many conditions of
his contract, Fucharoen maintains
that he may have abandoned the op
portunity to leave Thailand for col
lege if he did not have the scholar
ship, as the cost of attending Stanford
is roughly six to seven times that of
Thai universities.

"Some people may think 14 years
is a lot, but I like [the] aviation indus
try, so getting to work in the air traffic
service sector is more than I can ask
for, hence I'm really happy with this
deal," Fucharoen said.

"Again, some people don't like the
life-bonding contract, but I think it's a
very good deal as long as you choose
to apply for the sponsor that you real
ly want to work for," he added.

Other students in the international
community rely on their parents to
fund their education or find work to
pay their own way through school.
"My parents paid for my tuition

actually, my mom pays the bulk of it,"
said Shine Zaw-Aung 'll.

Some students also work while at
Stanford.
"Many of us find various on-cam
pus jobs to relieve the burden on liv
ing expenses," Lee added. "After all,
sometimes we may want to eat outside
or watch a movie, and those cost
money."
What the Future Holds
Although Martha Trujillo, director
of financial aid for the School of Med
icine, indicated that the medical
school had once discussed extending
its need-blind financial aid policy to
include international students, both
she and Cooper cited the fallen en
dowment and current economic state
as reasons why the University cannot
do so at this time.
"There are no immediate plans to
extend our need-blind admission poli
cies to international students," Coop
er said. "The cost is prohibitive at this
time."
