# GERHART NOT A DARK HORSE
## 
### JACK SALISBURY 
Toby Gerhart just might deserve
the Heisman Trophy and for the
first time this season, the Cardinal
faithful aren't the only people
who think so.

"With the stamina, toughness and
competitiveness he's shown, I think he's
been the most outstanding player," said
ESPN analyst Todd McShay after slating
Gerhart as his No. 1 pick.
His partner Brock Huard, a former
quarterback at the University of Wash
ington, essentially agreed.
"I think this a two-horse race," Huard
said. "And Toby Gerhart better be well up
there. He defined and turned around
Stanford all by himself this season."
When you consider the season he's
had, Gerhart's 205-yard and four-touch
down (three rushing, one passing) per
formance against the Notre Dame Fight
ing Irish this Saturday wasn't all that ex
traordinary. The future Stanford legend
has been racking up these kinds of games
all season, especially down the stretch.
Likewise, Saturday's win fell short of
the Cardinal's best performance this sea
son: the three-headed spear of quarter
back Jimmy Clausen and receivers Gold
en Tate and Michael Floyd embarrassed
the Stanford secondary at times and the
Irish held a 10-point lead well into the see

ond half.
But even without top-notch perform
ances from either Gerhart or his team,
Saturday's win over Notre Dame was
ever-important for one simple reason: it
was on national television. After all, a win
is only as good as the viewers perceive it to
be.
Gerhart has been a dark horse candi
date most of this season, falling behind Al
abama tailback Mark Ingram and golden
boy quarterbacks Tim Tebow of Florida
and Colt McCoy of Texas on most ana
lysts' lists. Saturday's game served to re
verse that trend, as the nation finally got
to see what the bruising back is all about.
"He's made that statement the entire
year," said Stanford's Head Coach Jim
Harbaugh. "He was incredible to watch.
He said it all by the way he's played. He's
been about it and not talked about it. He
just kept going at it week after week."
Perception is king in the world of col
lege football, a sport which crowns its na
tional champion largely based on who
people think the best team is. Saturday's
game was the best possible regular-season
ending for the image of a Cardinal team
that has become a media darling of sorts
in recent weeks.
For one, as said before, it was on na
tional television. Even on top of that, un
usual attention focused on Saturday's
contest as many around the country ex
pected the game to be the last for Fighting

Irish Coach Charlie Weis. Last and most
simply, it was a good game. The Cardinal's
45-38 win was a back-and-forth shootout
with plenty of offensive talent on both
sides of the ball and it didn't hurt that Ger
hart threw a touchdown on fourth-and
four to tie that game with just minutes re
maining.
That said, just because a few analysts
have Gerhart at the top of their lists does
not necessarily mean he will win the
award. McCoy and Tebow are two of the
best college quarterbacks of this genera
tion, let alone this year, and the media has
had its eye on them for four years now.
They will both have national audiences
for their games this weekend and their
teams are playing for stakes Stanford has
n't touched in decades. Gerhart winning
the Heisman would probably still be a sur
prise at this point.
Whether he wins the award or not,
Cardinal fans and players alike can rest
assured that both Gerhart and this team
are getting the credit they deserve for the
season they have had. Saturday's win over
the Irish, more than anything else, was a
showcase for a program that has "bowed
to no man" since Coach Harbaugh ar
rived on campus three years ago. And it
doesn't look like it will be doing so any
time soon.
