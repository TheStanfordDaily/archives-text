### â€“ By Wyndam Makowsky 
There is always room in the trophy
case, particularly when the prize is of the
national variety.
Senior running back Toby Gerhart is
one of four finalists for AT&T ESPN All-
America Player of the Week honors, an
award decided by fans.
Gerhart, tabbed for his impressive,
four touchdown performance in a 45-38
win over Notre Dame, joins Tennessee's
Montario Hardesty, Missouri's Danario
Alexander and Colt McCoy of Texas in
the contest. Although ESPN analysts
chose the players, fans determine the
winner.

Voting is open until 9 p.m. on Wednes
day and the winner will be named during
the national broadcast of the Civil War
Game Oregon State vs. Oregon on
Thursday night.
Fans can vote for Gerhart, who is a

likely candidate for AT&T ESPN All-
America Player of the Year honors as
well, by texting "vote" to 345345. Once
fans receive a response, they can text
back "B" as a vote for Gerhart. There is
no voting limit; each person can text as
much as they please.
