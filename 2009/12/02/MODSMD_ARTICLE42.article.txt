# Another conference honor for Gerhart
## 
### 
Toby Gerhart has, once again, been
named the Pac-10 Player of the Week.
In what has almost become routine,
Stanford's senior running back was hon
ored for the third time in four weeks as
the conference's top offensive performer.
Gerhart did it all against Notre Dame: he
ran for 205 yards and three touchdowns,
threw for a score and had a big 33-yard
reception, too. On the Cardinal's final
drive, Gerhart carried on seven of ten
plays, including the game-winning 4-yard
scoring dash. Gerhart's three rushing
touchdowns gave him 26 on the year,

which breaks both a school and Pac-10
record.
Junior kicker Nate Whitaker, who ac
cumulated 13 points and was perfect on
points after and field goals, was nominat
ed for the special teams award but was
beaten out by Arizona's Alex Zendejas.
Whitaker has won once already this year.
USC linebacker Malcolm Smith won
the defensive nod this week.
