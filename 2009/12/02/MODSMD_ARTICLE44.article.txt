# Enlightening the ignorant

I can anticipate the comments to
this column already. Something
like, "Jeez Dan, you really have
a knack for finding the bad in
good situations," or even more like
ly, "Way to be a party-pooper,
Oh well, I'm going to say it any
way.
WHAT THE !@#s WERE YOU
DOING RUSHING THE FIELD
ON SATURDAY, STANFORD
FANS?
I've spent the last few days toss
ing around possibilities for the best
adjective to describe the way fans
ran out onto the field on Saturday
after Stanford's 45-38 win over
Notre Dame, I've considered "pa
thetic," which arguments could
probably support and "sad," which I
believe the act was. I have, however,
settled on ignorant, which I believe
is a great word for summing up
Stanford football fans in general.
Let's walk through Saturday's
events: The Cardinal beat a team
whose record is now 6-6, whose
coach had been publicly tarred-and
feathered and had resigned himself
to being fired even prior to the Stan
ford game, and whose players are so
burnt out on football that they met
yesterday to decide whether they
wanted to accept an invitation to a
bowl game. The highlight of Satur
day's game for the Fighting Irish
must have been Stanford fans mak
ing them feel important by rushing
the field after the game. Ignorant.

So what if their name is Notre
Dame and the game was exciting?
They suck, period. Their defense
couldn't stop Paly High's powder
puff team and they have less heart
than that girl in the Kanye song.
Plus, their fans beat up their own
quarterback last week.
In fact, Stanford didn't even
cover the spread, which was any
where between nine and 10 points,
depending on where you placed
your bets. Yet the fans still rushed
the field. So ignorant.

There are unwritten rules about
rushing the field. I will now do
everyone a favor and write them
down now, so as to avoid any future
confusion. They are fairly simple:
1. You rush the field (or court, as
this applies to basketball as well)
when your team beats a team
ranked in the top 10 and your team
is not ranked in the top 10. Hence,
the rushing of the field after Stan
ford beat Oregon was appropriate.
2. You rush the field if your team
wins after being the underdog by 20
or more points.

3. Lastly, you rush the field if you
win your rivalry game. Rushing the
field after winning Big Game will al
ways be appropriate. (Note: Rule
No. 3 does not apply to basketball ri
valries like Stanford-California, in
which Cal has been Stanford's
perennial punching bag for years).
If you have any further questions
regarding field rushing etiquette,
feel free to contact me and I'd be
more than happy to make sure
atrocities like Saturday aren't re
peated ever.
As a senior, the ignorance of
Stanford and Stanford fans should
n't be surprising to me in the least at
this point.
After all, Stanford's "biggest
fans" are 70-year-olds that sit out
side the stadium sipping their
Napoleon Brandies and berating
students for playing music while
they tailgate. No wonder the stadi
um sounds like a church service dur
ing the game the season ticket
holders like it that way!

On the occasion that the students
actually do make noise during the
game (notice I said students, not
fans, because the rest of the fans are
either rooting for the other team or
fit in the category described above),
at least half the time it is when Stan
ford has the football. So, so igno
rant.

This brings me to my next point:
cheer as loud as you can when the
other team has the ball and shut the
heck up when Stanford has the ball
so they players can focus on actual
ly doing their job. The fact that I
have to put this in writing is ap
palling.
In fact, Stanford actually realized
the ignorance of its fans and gave
that Axe Committee guy a micro
phone on the field to lead the
crowd's cheering. First off, it's pa
thetic that the school deemed that
necessary, and second, in a awk
wardly ironic yet fitting way, Mr. Ax
eComm cheers at the wrong time
fairly regularly, which seems about

right for Stanford fans.
Blaming the fans for all this
would be cruel, however, because it
wouldn't get at one of the roots of
the problem Stanford itself and
its stadium security (or the S.S. for
short, as some fans have cleverly
dubbed them).
Stanford has a new policy that
students can't loan their student
IDs to other people when they can't
get to a game. That means when

there are home games like Satur
day's, which fell over a break in
school, students who are away from
campus can't give their IDs to
friends to go to a game that was sold
out. This policy sends the message
that Stanford would rather force
people to buy scalped tickets or dis
play a half-empty student section on
national television than actually fill
up the stadium in support of the
team. Again, very ignorant.
Then there is stadium security.
Reserved for recruits and special
people (maybe other athletes, I'm
not sure) are the first five or so rows
in front of the student section. These
rows are comically empty week in

and week out, but if students try to
sit in them, redcoats like Tom Chase
(I am a man of my word, buddy)
that enjoy their power a little too
much will kick them out of the seats
and, if you protest, out of the sta
dium.
I know it looks great on televi
sion ,and really impressive to re
cruits, to have the first five rows of
the stadium empty, but hell, why
should the students actually be al
lowed to have fun? Now that would
be ignorant, right Stanford?

Dan Bohm is just bitter that he could
n't touch Toby. Give him your sympa
thies at bohmd@stanford.edu.
