# Swimming's Swantson earns Canadian honor
## 
### 
Even as his Stanford career is in
its infancy, freshman swimmer
Matthew Swantson has already
picked up national honors in his
home country.
A native of Newmarket, Ontario,
Swantson was named the 2009 Male
Junior Swimmer of the Year. Even
more impressive is the fact that it was
the second straight time that
Swantson has received the award.
Total points determine the winner
and Swantson was honored in large

part because of the 918 points he ac
cumulated at this summer's British
Tri-Nations Meet in London.

Swantson, who swims backstroke,
was presented with the trophy at the
Canada Cup, where he also swam in
the 200 and 50-meter races, placing
second in both. In the 200 meter
backstroke, he was second only to
Matt Hawes, who holds the Canadian
record in the event.

Swantson has already seen action
for Stanford in the fall section of the
team's schedule. The Cardinal is cur
rently ranked No. 2 in the nation and
will not be back in action until it faces
Pacific on Jan. 9.
