## Daniel Shih'10 named 2010 Rhodes Scholar Grassroots activist will begin studies next fall 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Political science student Daniel
Shih 'lO last week was named one
of 32 American 2010 Rhodes
Scholars heading to Oxford Uni
versity. Shih will begin studying
there next fall.
Shih, who was born and raised in
Naperville, 111., is also a 2009 Tru
man Scholar.
"I'm still figuring out exactly
what I'm going to study. I'm inter
ested in a few things, mainly the in
tersection between grassroots ac
tivism and government," Shih said.
"I'm interested in how we can cre
ate space for grassroots activists

and allow peo
ple's voices to
be heard with
out having to
be elected to
government.
"I think I
might be study
ing compara
tive govern
ment and polit
ical science,"
Shih added.

"Something in the Department of
Politics and International Rela
tions."
Shih has taken significant time
off from Stanford to pursue both
field research interests and to work
on the campaign trail. He took over
a year off school to work for the
Obama campaign, eventually

working as a field organizer in five
states and, during the general elec
tion, becoming the regional field di
rector in Albuquerque.
"It's really important for me to
take charge of my own education, to
pursue opportunities that will help
me grow as an individual, help me
grow as an activist and a scholar," he
said. "With that belief in taking some
risks and trying new things, graduat
ing in four straight years was not the
most important thing to me."
Shih received a Chappell Lougee
grant his freshman year to research
the social programs of Hugo Chavez.
He continued the research into this
quarter, which he took off to conduct
field research on the Sino-Venezue
lan political and economic relation
ship.

On campus, Shih is involved with
the Stanford Progressive Associa
tion and helped launched the Stan
ford Sweat-Free Campaign to get
Stanford to join the Worker Rights
Consortium.

As for his future after Oxford,
Shih admitted that he's long flirted
with the idea of becoming an aca
demic.
"But I want to consider the social
impact that my work as an academic
could have as well," he said. "I've al
ways thought about how to make my
work relevant to the people that I
want to help the people marginal
ized by government and by society."
Shih applied to the Rhodes Schol
arship at the encouragement of a col
league that he worked with at the
Obama campaign.

"She talked about her experi-
ences in Oxford, and it made a big
difference in my deciding to apply
for the Rhodes Scholarship," Shih
said. "I wasn't aware that I even had
a legitimate shot in any way.

"You never see yourself as a
Rhodes Scholar," he added. "It's a
little scary."
