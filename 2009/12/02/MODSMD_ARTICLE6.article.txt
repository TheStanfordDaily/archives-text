## Alcohol citations on the rise Minor in Possession cases nearly double from last fall 
### TYLER BROWN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fall quarter, 114 Minor in Possession of Alco
hol (MIP) citations were issued, up by nearly dou
ble from last year, according to a report from the
Department of Public Safety (DPS). In contrast,
alcohol-related medical emergencies during New
Student Orientation (NSO) declined compared
to last year.
DPS issued 62 MIP citations last fall quarter

and 81 the year before last.
"The increase in citations in 2009 to date can be
partially attributed to increased staffing during
nights when parties are held, [when] alcohol viola
tions and other incidents such as burglaries, thefts
and assaults are more likely to occur," DPS
spokesman Bill Larson wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily.
Upperclassmen were issued the majority of
Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and Drunk in
Public tickets. The vast majority of MIP tickets
were issued on the Row.
According to Ralph Castro, associate dean of
substance abuse prevention at Vaden Health Cen
ter, the relative number of freshmen transported

to emergency rooms for alcohol poi
soning declined to 40 percent of all
students transported to the ER for al
cohol-related reasons. In previous
years, they were the majority.

Castro believes the later fall move
in date for Row houses and revised
University party-planning guidelines,
both of which went into effect this
summer, were instrumental in the de
cline of early-quarter emergency
room transports. He sees the later
move-in date as a "protective factor"
that gives upperclassmen less idle
time before classes start.

With those policies in place, Castro
doesn't see the need for additional
changes in the near future.
"At this time, I believe that the
policies we have in place are work
ing," Castro wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "We have a solid social contract
with students. The University as
sumes that students will make re
sponsible and healthy decisions, and
this assumption guides all of our poli
cy decisions."
In Castro's opinion, the primary
cause of unhealthy decisions is stu
dents' poor ability to distinguish be
tween the alcohol contents of differ
ent drinks, resulting in excessive con
sumption of hard liquor.

"Some students think they can
drink hard liquor in volume quantities
similar to beer, and this leads to trou
bling outcomes," Castro said. "We
continue to stress the dangers of hard
liquor in our education efforts."

When students are ticketed for al
cohol violations, they are required to
enter the Alcohol Education Semi
nar at Vaden's Substance Abuse Pre
vention Program. Castro says the
program has been successful since
the rate of repeat offense is only four
percent.

As alcohol education has become
more pervasive, high-risk drinking
has declined across campus, especial
ly among freshmen. Castro indicated
that while AlcoholEdu, the online al
cohol education seminar required for
freshmen, cannot be correlated to de
clining alcohol-related incidents at
Stanford, there has been a marked
decrease in high-risk drinking since
the program was introduced four
years ago.

"We continue to enforce the prohi
bition against Minors in Possession of
alcohol," Larson said. "Also, our sworn
personnel work closely with our col
leagues at Student Affairs to promote
alcohol awareness and education."
There were no violent crimes com
mitted on campus this quarter where
alcohol was implicated as a contribut
ing factor.
