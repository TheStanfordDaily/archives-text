## Gerhart's four touchdowns secure Card win 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
"This is the guy," said Head Coach Jim Har
baugh following Saturday night's game.
He was talking, of course, about Toby Gerhart,
who recorded an impressive 205 rushing yards and
scored four touchdowns including the game
winning touchdown as Stanford defeated Notre
Dame, 45-38, in its final game of the regular season.
Gerhart all but completed the game-winning
drive solo in the final minutes of the fourth quarter.
With 5:03 on the clock, second-and-four on the
Stanford 24-yard line, he broke a pair of tackles be
fore being brought down at the Stanford 47-yard
line for a gain of 13 yards. At 3:04, freshman quar
terback Andrew Luck connected with wide receiv
er Coby Fleener on a 14-yarder that brought the
ball to the Notre Dame 35-yard line but then it
was all Gerhart.

At first-and-10 at the Notre Dame 35, he took
the ball seven, two, then three yards to bring it to
the Notre Dame 23-yard line. With 1:03 left in the
game, it was all Gerhart again this time, he
found a seam up the middle for a spectacular 19-
yard gain. It was then 0:59, first-and-goal on the

Notre Dame 4. Sensing the inevitable touchdown,
Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis parted the
Fighting Irish sea and Gerhart cruised past.
"We had to score," Gerhart said. "We had six
minutes, five minutes, we wanted to end the game
with the ball in our hands and when we had an op

portunity like that, we did not want to be denied. It
was a good drive all around. The offensive line got
after them. I was dying. I couldn't breathe, but we
finished in the end zone."

Toby Gerhart performed like a Heisman Trophy finalist on Saturday in front of a national television audience,
scoring three touchdowns on the ground and passing for another en route to a Stanford victory. The
Cardinal overcame a big performance by Notre Dame, winning the game 45-38.
