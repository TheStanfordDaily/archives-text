## Gerhart's four touchdowns secure Card win 
### CHRISTINA NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
"This is the guy," said Head Coach Jim Har
baugh following Saturday night's game.
He was talking, of course, about Toby Gerhart,
who recorded an impressive 205 rushing yards and
scored four touchdowns including the game
winning touchdown as Stanford defeated Notre
Dame, 45-38, in its final game of the regular season.
Gerhart all but completed the game-winning
drive solo in the final minutes of the fourth quarter.
With 5:03 on the clock, second-and-four on the
Stanford 24-yard line, he broke a pair of tackles be
fore being brought down at the Stanford 47-yard
line for a gain of 13 yards. At 3:04, freshman quar
terback Andrew Luck connected with wide receiv
er Coby Fleener on a 14-yarder that brought the
ball to the Notre Dame 35-yard line but then it
was all Gerhart.

At first-and-10 at the Notre Dame 35, he took
the ball seven, two, then three yards to bring it to
the Notre Dame 23-yard line. With 1:03 left in the
game, it was all Gerhart again this time, he
found a seam up the middle for a spectacular 19-
yard gain. It was then 0:59, first-and-goal on the

Notre Dame 4. Sensing the inevitable touchdown,
Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis parted the
Fighting Irish sea and Gerhart cruised past.
"We had to score," Gerhart said. "We had six
minutes, five minutes, we wanted to end the game
with the ball in our hands and when we had an op

portunity like that, we did not want to be denied. It
was a good drive all around. The offensive line got
after them. I was dying. I couldn't breathe, but we
finished in the end zone."

Toby Gerhart performed like a Heisman Trophy finalist on Saturday in front of a national television audience,
scoring three touchdowns on the ground and passing for another en route to a Stanford victory. The
Cardinal overcame a big performance by Notre Dame, winning the game 45-38.
Altogether, the Stanford offense
posted 496 total offensive yards, to
Notre Dame's 447. Stanford was
able to establish a balanced attack,
with 280 yards on the ground and
216 through the air. In contrast,
Notre Dame was largely restricted
to its passing game, recording 340
passing yards.
But the Fighting Irish actually led
the Cardinal for the better part of
the game, twice by 11 points.
The opening minutes saw Stan
ford linebacker Nick Macaluso force
a Notre Dame fumble at their own
15-yard line, which Stanford safety
Delano Howell was able to recover.
The Cardinal capitalized with the
first seven points. On the very next
Stanford possession, however, Notre
Dame safety Sergio Brown stripped
running back Tyler Gaffney on a
punt return and Notre Dame recov
ered the ball. A few plays later, the
Irish pulled even at 7-7.
At the end of the first quarter,
Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy
Clausen engineered a 10-play, 78-
yard drive that showcased the team's
offensive variety. With 3:07 left in the
quarter, at second-and-6 on the
Notre Dame 40-yard line, Clausen
connected with wide receiver Gold
en Tate for a 9-yard gain. Later in the
drive, Clausen handed off to running
back Robert Hughes for a gain of 8
yards. Then Clausen handed off to
running back Theo Riddick, who
rushed for another gain of 24 yards.
At 0:40, Clausen launched a pass

on first-and-10 to Hughes, 18 yards
off in the end zone and Hughes man
aged to keep his left toes inbound
long enough to earn the touchdown
and give the Irish a 14-10 lead.
Later in the second quarter, at
first-and-10 on the Stanford 22-yard
line, Clausen found a wide-open
Tate in the flat, who cruised down
field for a 78-yard touchdown. With
the score, Notre Dame shot ahead,
24-13.

Stanford responded with a strong
offensive drive of its own. At 4:13,
first-and-10 on his own 39-yard line,
Luck connected with wide receiver
Ryan Whalen for a 23-yard gain. A
few plays later, Luck found tight end
Jim Dray on a 12-yarder, then Coby
Fleener on a 23-yard bullet up the
middle, to bring the ball to first-and
goal on the Notre Dame 2-yard line.
Fullback Owen Marecic punched in
the score.

After halftime, though, Notre
Dame took to its secret weaponry.
At first-and-10 on the Stanford 46-
yard line, Hughes took a direct snap,
reversed to Tate, who re-reversed to
Clausen â€”at that point the Stan
ford defense was sufficiently con
fused to leave Floyd open deep
downfield. Clausen pitched it to
Floyd for a 46-yard touchdown re
ception. The Notre Dame lead was
again 11, the score 31-20.
Into the fourth quarter, a touch
down tradeoff and Stanford kicker
Nate Whitaker's field goal had
brought the score to 30-38. With 8:59

left in the game, Stanford faced
fourth-and-4 on the Notre Dame 18-
yard line. On the next play, Stanford
kept its offensive unit on the field
and introduced some secret
weaponry of its own. Luck handed
off to Gerhart, who rushed right be
fore stepping up and pitching a
floater to Whalen in the end zone.
Whalen, fighting through pass inter
ference, dove and caught the ball.
The ensuing 2-point conversion tied
the game at 38 all.
"Pretty much all year we've been
practicing that," Harbaugh said of
the play. "Sometimes it's looked
good, sometimes it hasn't. [Coach
Willie Taggart] suggested it and we
went with it. It was covered well it
was a perfectly thrown ball. I think
Toby was kind of just throwing it up
and putting it over the defender's
head and then Ryan made an incred
ible play."

The win over Notre Dame rounds
out the regular season, with the Car
dinal improving to 8-4 (7-3 Pac-10)
and again securing top 25 rankings
in both national polls: 23rd in the AP
and 24th in the USA Today Coaches'
Poll.

"[l'm] really proud of our guys,"
Harbaugh said, reflecting on the sea
son. "They've fueled this. It was their
fire that fueled this. I'm proud of
them. 8-4 is a heck of a season and
we've got another game to go."

running back Theo Riddick, who
rushed for another gain of 24 yards.
At 0:40, Clausen launched a pass

on first-and-10 to Hughes, 18 yards
off in the end zone and Hughes man
aged to keep his left toes inbound
long enough to earn the touchdown
and give the Irish a 14-10 lead.
Later in the second quarter, at
first-and-10 on the Stanford 22-yard
line, Clausen found a wide-open
Tate in the flat, who cruised down
field for a 78-yard touchdown. With
the score, Notre Dame shot ahead,
24-13.

Stanford responded with a strong
offensive drive of its own. At 4:13,
first-and-10 on his own 39-yard line,
Luck connected with wide receiver
Ryan Whalen for a 23-yard gain. A
few plays later, Luck found tight end
Jim Dray on a 12-yarder, then Coby
Fleener on a 23-yard bullet up the
middle, to bring the ball to first-and
goal on the Notre Dame 2-yard line.
Fullback Owen Marecic punched in
the score.

After halftime, though, Notre
Dame took to its secret weaponry.
At first-and-10 on the Stanford 46-
yard line, Hughes took a direct snap,
reversed to Tate, who re-reversed to
Clausen â€”at that point the Stan
ford defense was sufficiently con
fused to leave Floyd open deep
downfield. Clausen pitched it to
Floyd for a 46-yard touchdown re
ception. The Notre Dame lead was
again 11, the score 31-20.
Into the fourth quarter, a touch
down tradeoff and Stanford kicker
Nate Whitaker's field goal had
brought the score to 30-38. With 8:59

left in the game, Stanford faced
fourth-and-4 on the Notre Dame 18-
yard line. On the next play, Stanford
kept its offensive unit on the field
and introduced some secret
weaponry of its own. Luck handed
off to Gerhart, who rushed right be
fore stepping up and pitching a
floater to Whalen in the end zone.
Whalen, fighting through pass inter
ference, dove and caught the ball.
The ensuing 2-point conversion tied
the game at 38 all.
"Pretty much all year we've been
practicing that," Harbaugh said of
the play. "Sometimes it's looked
good, sometimes it hasn't. [Coach
Willie Taggart] suggested it and we
went with it. It was covered well it
was a perfectly thrown ball. I think
Toby was kind of just throwing it up
and putting it over the defender's
head and then Ryan made an incred
ible play."

The win over Notre Dame rounds
out the regular season, with the Car
dinal improving to 8-4 (7-3 Pac-10)
and again securing top 25 rankings
in both national polls: 23rd in the AP
and 24th in the USA Today Coaches'
Poll.

"[l'm] really proud of our guys,"
Harbaugh said, reflecting on the sea
son. "They've fueled this. It was their
fire that fueled this. I'm proud of
them. 8-4 is a heck of a season and
we've got another game to go."

"This is the guy," said Head Coach Jim Har
baugh following Saturday night's game.
He was talking, of course, about Toby Gerhart,
who recorded an impressive 205 rushing yards and
scored four touchdowns including the game
winning touchdown as Stanford defeated Notre
Dame, 45-38, in its final game of the regular season.
Gerhart all but completed the game-winning
drive solo in the final minutes of the fourth quarter.
With 5:03 on the clock, second-and-four on the
Stanford 24-yard line, he broke a pair of tackles be
fore being brought down at the Stanford 47-yard
line for a gain of 13 yards. At 3:04, freshman quar
terback Andrew Luck connected with wide receiv
er Coby Fleener on a 14-yarder that brought the
ball to the Notre Dame 35-yard line but then it
was all Gerhart.

At first-and-10 at the Notre Dame 35, he took
the ball seven, two, then three yards to bring it to
the Notre Dame 23-yard line. With 1:03 left in the
game, it was all Gerhart again this time, he
found a seam up the middle for a spectacular 19-
yard gain. It was then 0:59, first-and-goal on the

Notre Dame 4. Sensing the inevitable touchdown,
Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis parted the
Fighting Irish sea and Gerhart cruised past.
"We had to score," Gerhart said. "We had six
minutes, five minutes, we wanted to end the game
with the ball in our hands and when we had an op

portunity like that, we did not want to be denied. It
was a good drive all around. The offensive line got
after them. I was dying. I couldn't breathe, but we
finished in the end zone."

Toby Gerhart performed like a Heisman Trophy finalist on Saturday in front of a national television audience,
scoring three touchdowns on the ground and passing for another en route to a Stanford victory. The
Cardinal overcame a big performance by Notre Dame, winning the game 45-38.
Altogether, the Stanford offense
posted 496 total offensive yards, to
Notre Dame's 447. Stanford was
able to establish a balanced attack,
with 280 yards on the ground and
216 through the air. In contrast,
Notre Dame was largely restricted
to its passing game, recording 340
passing yards.
But the Fighting Irish actually led
the Cardinal for the better part of
the game, twice by 11 points.
The opening minutes saw Stan
ford linebacker Nick Macaluso force
a Notre Dame fumble at their own
15-yard line, which Stanford safety
Delano Howell was able to recover.
The Cardinal capitalized with the
first seven points. On the very next
Stanford possession, however, Notre
Dame safety Sergio Brown stripped
running back Tyler Gaffney on a
punt return and Notre Dame recov
ered the ball. A few plays later, the
Irish pulled even at 7-7.
At the end of the first quarter,
Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy
Clausen engineered a 10-play, 78-
yard drive that showcased the team's
offensive variety. With 3:07 left in the
quarter, at second-and-6 on the
Notre Dame 40-yard line, Clausen
connected with wide receiver Gold
en Tate for a 9-yard gain. Later in the
drive, Clausen handed off to running
back Robert Hughes for a gain of 8
yards. Then Clausen handed off to
running back Theo Riddick, who
rushed for another gain of 24 yards.
At 0:40, Clausen launched a pass

on first-and-10 to Hughes, 18 yards
off in the end zone and Hughes man
aged to keep his left toes inbound
long enough to earn the touchdown
and give the Irish a 14-10 lead.
Later in the second quarter, at
first-and-10 on the Stanford 22-yard
line, Clausen found a wide-open
Tate in the flat, who cruised down
field for a 78-yard touchdown. With
the score, Notre Dame shot ahead,
24-13.

Stanford responded with a strong
offensive drive of its own. At 4:13,
