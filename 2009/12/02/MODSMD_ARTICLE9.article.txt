## Professor and Big Tobacco clash 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
In a series of long and embittered fights
in the Florida court system, a judge's recent
ruling may prove vital for smokers' lawsuits
against the tobacco industry. Yet for a Stan
ford professor who has been at the center of
more than one case against big tobacco, the
decision may have greater implications in
preserving his work and academic free
dom.

Last month, in the case of Castleman v.
R.J. Reynolds Co., Judge Charles Mitchell
of the Fourth Judicial Circuit Court in
Duval County ruled that Prof Robert Proc
tor, a key witness for the plaintiffs, did not
have to turn over a manuscript of his un
published book to R.J. Reynolds' lawyers
for the purpose of cross-examination. Proc
tor, who has appeared as an expert witness
in lawsuits against tobacco companies since
1995, is only one of two historians to regu
larly testify against the industry.
However, this ruling reveals a number
of legal disparities and uncertainties, as a
judge presiding over an earlier case
Koballa v. Philip Morris U.S.A. —had
come to the exact opposite conclusion: In
October, Seventh District Court Judge
William A. Parsons approved defense
lawyers' requests for a subpoena of the pro
fessor's unfinished work, entitled "Golden
Holocaust: A History of Global Tobacco."
At the time of that decision, the plain
tiffs immediately reacted, arguing that a
court-backed seizure of any unpublished
work was a direct violation of First Amend
ment rights. Developing an argument
against a ruling that they believed would
have a "chilling effect on academia," Proc

tor and a team of lawyers filed a motion to
block the subpoena.
The University also filed an amicus
curae brief in support of Proctor's motion,
the first time it has ever done so to protect a
professor's unpublished research.

"For them to have access to notes before
they are finished impairs ability to conduct
research," Proctor told The Daily for an ear
lier article.

The decision in Castleman, however, will
give some support to the professor's argu
ments. And while it is still uncertain how the
recent Fourth Circuit decision will apply to
other smoking lawsuits, Proctor and repre
sentatives of the plaintiffs claim it is a step
forward in their cases against a multi-billion
dollar industry.
"It is a big victory for academic freedom,
but it remains to be seen how it will be ap
plied in other counties... and how this ar
gument is carried over in other cases," Proc
tor said. "I'm hoping it will establish a cer
tain protection for these manuscripts."

Florida up in smoke
The case of Castleman v. R.J. Reynolds
Co. is just one of hundreds of Florida smok
er lawsuits that Prof Proctor could become
embroiled in. Even he has lost count.

"It's all confused in my mind, with the
same defendants in every case making this
argument," he said of the lawsuits he's cur
rently involved in. "It's several [cases] I
don't know how many."

In the Sunshine State, these individual
lawsuits brought against big tobacco are the
result of a 1994 class action lawsuit, Engle v.
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. .Arguing that the
industry had knowingly sold a product that
caused injury to consumers, former smoker

and pediatrician
Howard Engle sued
on behalf of more
than 500,000 state

smokers for punitive damages of nearly
$145 billion.
While the case was originally decided in
favor of the plaintiffs, higher state appeals
courts later overturned the decision on the
basis that the state smokers were too dis
similar to constitute a class for a class action
lawsuit. The Florida Supreme Court, how
ever, ruled that smokers could try their
cases on an individual basis.

This has prompted the emergence of
thousands of tobacco lawsuits, known as
"Engle Progeny," the first of which are com
ing to a head now.
"There are 8,000 potential plaintiffs that
have to be tried one by one," Proctor said. "I
testified in the very first Engle case in De
cember of 2008, and ever since then, I've
been called in a couple of other cases."
Since September, nine Engle cases have
been tried with seven judgments in favor of
smokers and their families, and the others
ruled for the tobacco industry.
"We thank the jury for taking the time to
consider all of the evidence presented and
for making the right decision," said J. Jeffery
Raborn, vice president and assistant gener
al counsel for RJ. Reynolds, in a statement
following a March2oo9 ruling for big tobac
co. "Their verdict demonstrates that despite
the flawed decision of the Florida Supreme
Court to allow these cases to proceed in this
fashion, we have strong defenses to them,
and we will continue to defend ourselves
vigorously."


Robert Proctor
Proctor and the 'Engle Progeny'
As Engle cases begin to materialize
15 years after the original lawsuit, Prof.
Proctor can expect to be more heavily
involved in tobacco lawsuits.

Attorney C.K. Hoffler, who repre
sents the plaintiffs in Castleman, stated
that her law firm will pursue 420 other
smoking cases in the state. She hopes to
use the professor's statements in each

of these lawsuits.

"Dr. Proctor is testifying as an ex
pert," she said. "He will be giving gener
ic testimony that is not case-specific."
Proctor and lawyers for the plain
tiffs can take confidence in the Fourth
District Court's ruling in Castleman,
which prevents the professor from
turning over his work, and allows him to
testify freely as a witness in the case,
"Hopefully [other counties] will fol
low suit and will deny the disingenuous
attempts [of tobacco companies]," Hof
fler said. "Other judges, if it comes up in
other counties, may follow suit or may
make their own ruling."
Yet, as confirmed by Hoffler, the

issue surrounding the subpoena is by no
means settled, and, according to lawyer
Bill Ogle, will remain a point of con
tention in Florida smoking cases.

"There are tobacco cases that are
spread throughout the different coun
ties, and the issue will probably come up
again and again and again," he said.
"Tobacco companies could raise it
again in another court system and could
be decided by appellate courts, the
Florida Supreme Court, then the U.S.
Supreme Court.These are constitution
al issues."

In a series of long and embittered fights
in the Florida court system, a judge's recent
ruling may prove vital for smokers' lawsuits
against the tobacco industry. Yet for a Stan
ford professor who has been at the center of
more than one case against big tobacco, the
decision may have greater implications in
preserving his work and academic free
dom.

Last month, in the case of Castleman v.
R.J. Reynolds Co., Judge Charles Mitchell
of the Fourth Judicial Circuit Court in
Duval County ruled that Prof Robert Proc
tor, a key witness for the plaintiffs, did not
have to turn over a manuscript of his un
published book to R.J. Reynolds' lawyers
for the purpose of cross-examination. Proc
tor, who has appeared as an expert witness
in lawsuits against tobacco companies since
1995, is only one of two historians to regu
larly testify against the industry.
However, this ruling reveals a number
of legal disparities and uncertainties, as a
judge presiding over an earlier case
Koballa v. Philip Morris U.S.A. —had
come to the exact opposite conclusion: In
October, Seventh District Court Judge
William A. Parsons approved defense
lawyers' requests for a subpoena of the pro
fessor's unfinished work, entitled "Golden
Holocaust: A History of Global Tobacco."
At the time of that decision, the plain
tiffs immediately reacted, arguing that a
court-backed seizure of any unpublished
work was a direct violation of First Amend
ment rights. Developing an argument
against a ruling that they believed would
have a "chilling effect on academia," Proc

tor and a team of lawyers filed a motion to
block the subpoena.
The University also filed an amicus
curae brief in support of Proctor's motion,
the first time it has ever done so to protect a
professor's unpublished research.

"For them to have access to notes before
they are finished impairs ability to conduct
research," Proctor told The Daily for an ear
lier article.

The decision in Castleman, however, will
give some support to the professor's argu
ments. And while it is still uncertain how the
recent Fourth Circuit decision will apply to
other smoking lawsuits, Proctor and repre
sentatives of the plaintiffs claim it is a step
forward in their cases against a multi-billion
dollar industry.
"It is a big victory for academic freedom,
but it remains to be seen how it will be ap
plied in other counties... and how this ar
gument is carried over in other cases," Proc
tor said. "I'm hoping it will establish a cer
tain protection for these manuscripts."

Florida up in smoke
The case of Castleman v. R.J. Reynolds
Co. is just one of hundreds of Florida smok
er lawsuits that Prof Proctor could become
embroiled in. Even he has lost count.

"It's all confused in my mind, with the
same defendants in every case making this
argument," he said of the lawsuits he's cur
rently involved in. "It's several [cases] I
don't know how many."

In the Sunshine State, these individual
lawsuits brought against big tobacco are the
result of a 1994 class action lawsuit, Engle v.
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. .Arguing that the
industry had knowingly sold a product that
caused injury to consumers, former smoker

and pediatrician
Howard Engle sued
on behalf of more
than 500,000 state

smokers for punitive damages of nearly
$145 billion.
While the case was originally decided in
favor of the plaintiffs, higher state appeals
courts later overturned the decision on the
basis that the state smokers were too dis
similar to constitute a class for a class action
lawsuit. The Florida Supreme Court, how
ever, ruled that smokers could try their
cases on an individual basis.

This has prompted the emergence of
thousands of tobacco lawsuits, known as
"Engle Progeny," the first of which are com
ing to a head now.
"There are 8,000 potential plaintiffs that
have to be tried one by one," Proctor said. "I
testified in the very first Engle case in De
cember of 2008, and ever since then, I've
been called in a couple of other cases."
Since September, nine Engle cases have
been tried with seven judgments in favor of
smokers and their families, and the others
ruled for the tobacco industry.
"We thank the jury for taking the time to
consider all of the evidence presented and
for making the right decision," said J. Jeffery
Raborn, vice president and assistant gener
al counsel for RJ. Reynolds, in a statement
following a March2oo9 ruling for big tobac
co. "Their verdict demonstrates that despite
the flawed decision of the Florida Supreme
Court to allow these cases to proceed in this
fashion, we have strong defenses to them,
and we will continue to defend ourselves
vigorously."


Robert Proctor
Proctor and the 'Engle Progeny'
As Engle cases begin to materialize
15 years after the original lawsuit, Prof.
Proctor can expect to be more heavily
involved in tobacco lawsuits.

Attorney C.K. Hoffler, who repre
sents the plaintiffs in Castleman, stated
that her law firm will pursue 420 other
smoking cases in the state. She hopes to
use the professor's statements in each

of these lawsuits.

"Dr. Proctor is testifying as an ex
pert," she said. "He will be giving gener
ic testimony that is not case-specific."
Proctor and lawyers for the plain
tiffs can take confidence in the Fourth
District Court's ruling in Castleman,
which prevents the professor from
turning over his work, and allows him to
testify freely as a witness in the case,
"Hopefully [other counties] will fol
low suit and will deny the disingenuous
attempts [of tobacco companies]," Hof
fler said. "Other judges, if it comes up in
other counties, may follow suit or may
make their own ruling."
Yet, as confirmed by Hoffler, the

issue surrounding the subpoena is by no
means settled, and, according to lawyer
Bill Ogle, will remain a point of con
tention in Florida smoking cases.

"There are tobacco cases that are
spread throughout the different coun
ties, and the issue will probably come up
again and again and again," he said.
"Tobacco companies could raise it
again in another court system and could
be decided by appellate courts, the
Florida Supreme Court, then the U.S.
Supreme Court.These are constitution
al issues."
