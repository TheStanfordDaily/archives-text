IT DOESN'T
Multiple sclerosis interrupts the flow of
information between the brain and the
body and stops people from moving.
With the help of people like you, the
National MS Society addresses the
challenges of each person whose
life is affected by MS and helps
them stay connected to the
great big moving world.
