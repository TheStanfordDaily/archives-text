Winter Quarter 200Q-10
Explore the historically contingent development of economic, social, and political
behaviors at micro and macro levels through an introduction to appropriate tools
of analysis and historical case studies of legislative and administrative actions
that have shaped the workings of the US economy. When can extraneous events
have persisting effects upon the form and functioning of public institutions,
private organizations, and government agencies? The effects of positive feedback
dynamics, self-organization and emergent properties in complex systems, the
conditions for "lock-in" to sub-optimal equilibria - and escapes from such traps
in economic and social arrangements all are illustrated by, and in turn can
illuminate the dynamics of public policy-formation. Same as ECON 151.
Prerequisite: ECON 50, 51, & completion of at least one upper level economics
course. Prior work relating to public policy is strongly recommended.
