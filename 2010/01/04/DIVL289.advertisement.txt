Madison - Arthur Stanley Goldberger
died on Friday, December 11,2009 at
Select Specialty Hospital in Madison,
Wl just after his 79th birthday. Art was a
preeminent economist who taught at
the University of Wisconsin and at
Stanford University from 1960-1999.
His academic prominence was primari
ly in the technical field of econometrics,
and his research often used advanced
statistical methods, but he was widely
noted and praised for his clarity of writ
ing and for his pedagogic skills. He
won numerous teaching awards. A
leading journal in econometrics re
ferred to his graduate-level text book,
Econometric Theory, as a "landmark
that set a new standard of rigor in
econometrics." His research often dealt
with controversial public issues such as
the measurement of race and sex dis
crimination in labor markets, the heri
tability of intelligence, and the compar
ative effectiveness of public and private
schooling at primary and secondary
levels. His research in statistical meth
ods and in the analysis of public poli
cies were influential across the social
sciences-economics, sociology, psy
chology, and the overlap between sta
tistics and genetics.
The breadth of his achievements was
recognized in his many and diverse
professional honors. He was a Fellow
of the Econometric Society, the Ameri
can Statistical Association, the Acade
my of Arts and Sciences, and the
American Association for the Advance
ment of Science, and twice was a
Guggenheim Fellow. He is a Distin
guished Fellow of the American Eco
nomic Association and a member of
the National Academy of Sciences. In
1985, he gave the Woytinsky Lecture at
the University of Michigan.
The citation of all of Art's achievements
cannot however begin to express the
extent of the admiration and affection
for him by his students and colleagues,
across many departments. Through
out his career he expressed a generos
ity, a commitment to integrity, and infor
mality in the service of his family,
friends, community, and profession.
As for his personal life, Art was born on
November 20,1930 in Brooklyn, New
York to David and Martha Goldberger.
He loved to play tennis and volleyball,
enjoyed gardening, crossword puzzles -
specifically the cryptic puzzles, reading,
listening to music, his friendships, daily
trips to the coffee shop, and his cat,
Plum. His quick wit, good nature,
warmth, thoughtful, and easy-going per
sonality created many life-long friends.
