## THE
						DUDE ABIDES "Did you ever go to College?" 
### Zack Warma 
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old time is
still a-flying: And this same flower that smiles
to-day, To-morrow will be dying.

Damnit all to hell, Bobby Herrick, you
sure write purdy. As I sit in my room
after watching the most recent
episode of "Jersey Shore" (best show...
ever?) with my sister, a mere eight hours
away from my drive up to the Farm, I find
myself looking back on what has been, and
eyeing the now fast-developing year.
The entire concept of new year's resolu
tions, of squaring upon a single windmill or
two to fruitlessly charge, much less toss aside
by second week of February, is simply a waste
of time. But what the annual playing of "Auld
Lang Syne" (amazing lyrics, by the way
Robert Burns was down to rage) does insti
gate it a much-needed period of contempla
tion and reflection, which we as insanely busy
characters never spare enough time to do
well.
Predicted by some to begin with global
mayhem, the 2000s wrapped up for me in a
Sooners-filled Howard Johnson motel room
in El Paso, Texas, literally a mile and half
away from scenic Juarez, Mexico, and right
across the street from the classiest of estab
lishments, the Prince Machiavelli Lounge.
An unexpected, but nonetheless fitting
(question mark???) end to a long, strange
trip of a decade.
Like many of you, the 'oos encapsulated
my adolescence and over half of my eventual
(knock on wood) undergraduate career,
among so many other strange and wonderful
and painful events that no college paper col
umn could ever do even a shred of justice.
But there is absolutely no need to devote
yet another column to looking back at what
transpired in 2009, because "The Dude
Abides" has been for 10 months now just
that, a semi-coherent record of bygone insan
ity. Rather, even in spite of my history major
obsession with the past, I find the focus being
directed toward 2010 and beyond.
As a junior, there are casts of thousands of
my classmates and friends returning from all
corners of the globe after spending the fall im
mersed in either a Bing Overseas Drinking ..
. er, Studies campus or some other study
abroad program. There exists within the
ranks of my esteemed class a creeping realiza
tion of the transiency that marks our time at
the Stan.The graduation of many dear friends
in 2009 proved to me what many of my friends
who were formerly abroad are now experi
encing: the Farm goes on without you, and al
most as if you never were here at all.

This will be my last hurrah on the Farm for
this school year. I am getting a chance to
hightail to D.C. for the Stanford in Washing
ton program during spring, which I am all a
titter about. But as of March 19, what stands
between me and the Real World are only
three debauched quarters of frolicking
among the palm fronds in this sandstone
lined Xanadu (the Samuel Coleridge one, not
the house. I have already come clean about
my love of the Upper Row). I am neither re
gretful of my past quarters nor fearful of the
future, but this ever-narrowing window of
time does force me to pause a bit.
The fact that a winter-quarter junior is
getting antsy in the pantsy by the prospect of
his final departure from the House That Le
land Built is of absolutely no consequence or
relevance, much less a new development in
the greater history of Stanford students
clinging dearly to the University. Not to
worry I got the memo. However, when
mulling the undoubted absurdity that will
consume my 2010, wherever I may be, the im
portance of time stands out starkly.
The clock is quite clearly ticking away on
my Stanford experience, and having largely
found a wonderful little realm (a Warmdom,
perhaps?) within the Farm after two-plus
years of searching and stumbling, I intend to
do everything in my power to see that my re
maining days and months are filled with what
I actually want to be doing.

All of us at Stanford have our lives to
some degree punctuated with inane crap,
some of it necessary, but most of it not. We
take classes for the simple sake we see others
doing the same. We tepidly continue in stu
dent groups that have burned us out. Too fre
quently, we live by standards and ideals laid
down by forces other than ourselves.
Forget 'em, I say. If it's starting a student
group, pursuing an internship/cute internist,
or just planning a gnarly wine social, for god's
sake, do it. Our time is too precious here to be
wasted on trifling nonsense. Like this col
umn, for instance. Happy 2010, folks.

Zack had a hoot at the Sun Bowl, but hopes to ac
tively avoid West Texas for as long as possible.
Have any darkly hilarious new year's resolu
tions? Let Zack know at zwarma@stanford. edu.
