# GIRL, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## The 						Tiger Woods Column 
### Jordan Carr 
This break, we learned that unlike Santa
Claus, Tiger Woods doesn't stop at
three hos. None of Woods' 16 or so al
leged mistresses have been confirmed, but
let's just assume for a second that all these
mistresses are in fact telling the truth and
Tiger had literally dozens of women waiting
for him to bring the ruckus.
If so, Woods is more ruthlessly efficient off
the golf course than on it at least until al
legations of a romp in a sand trap surface. His
diligence in keeping many affairs secret for
so long while simultaneously being the most
dominant athlete in the world is an achieve
ment worthy of recognition.

Best (Alleged) Mistress: Holly Sampson
Needless to say, there's a lot of competi
tion here. There's the prostitute who was en
gaged to someone else. The one a British
tabloid called a "sex-addicted cougar." The
one who has appeared in four films whose ti
tles included the word "MILF."The Playmate
and prostitute. The former Miss Universe,
Jessica Simpson. The one who appeared on
VHl's "Tool Academy." Tiger's women come
from all walks of life, from Vegas cocktail
waitresses to prostitutes to nightclub man
agers to porn stars to ... 0.K., maybe not all
walks of life, but a lot of them.
The best is Holly Sampson, an actress who
appeared on "The Wonder Years" with Stan
ford alum Fred Savage, Later, she'd be in
over 80 porn movies, including an upcoming
one based on her night with Woods. A topless
Sampson alleged an affair with Woods,
adding "he has talent on field and he has tal
ent in the bedroom."
Sampson, like many of Woods' women,
was blond and blue-eyed, making some call
him a self-hating Cablinasian. Those people
underestimated Woods' Rain Man-like ge
nius. With mistresses who looked vaguely
like his wife, Woods was able to travel freely.
If you saw him out at a restaurant with a blue
eyed blonde woman, you would just assume
it was his wife. Do you really know what his
wife looks like well enough to call him out on
it? Nobody wants to pull an Austin Powers,
insisting that "it's a man, baby!"

The Mark Sanford Award for Best Electron
ic Message: "I will wear you out."
Was this in an ad touting Woods' incredi
ble work ethic that allowed him to outlast
other golfers physically and mentally, or was
it a text message he sent to cocktail waitress
Jaimee Grubbs? Parents: when you name
your daughter "Jaimee," this will happen.
Best Advertising Campaign: Accenture
Accenture had a good run with Tiger
Woods, including such slogans as "The road
to high performance isn't always paved," "It's
what you do next that counts," and of course,
"Strategy 80%. Exit Strategy 80%."

Best Career Move: Turn Evil
Woods should stop trying to market him

self as a suave good guy and embrace his role
as a villainous playboy. In short, less Gillette,
more Axe, Specifically, a brand of Axe guar
anteed to get the stripper glitter out. Also, he
should do Viagra ads that are basically reen
actments of Jay-Z's "Big Pimpin'" video.
Woods should leave his wife, start hanging
out with Charlie Sheen and bring at least two
scantily-clad women everywhere. He should
refer to other golfers as "cracka-ass crackas,"
grow cornrows and put out a rap CD. He
would be a mature, responsible family man
who ditched his wife to become a selfish, child
ish jerk with immature friends. It would be like
watching a romantic comedy in reverse.
Best Rumors: All
The car accident was a fraud to cover the
damage Nordegren did to Woods' face.
Woods is in Phoenix having facial recon
struction surgery. Nordegren fled to a private
Swedish island. Woods paid women to say he
was good in bed. Woods had "crazy Ambien
sex." Nordegren will sign with Puma to spite
Woods. Nordegren chased him down the
driveway with a golf club, causing the crash.
Woods was high when he crashed. Woods has
a pill/sex addiction.
Woods' marriage was a sham. Woods
funded his mistress' liposuction. Woods used
bribery and threats to keep his mistresses
quiet. He watched "Desperate Housewives"
with one mistress. Tiger Woods spiked a story
about his affairs by agreeing to appear on the
cover of Men's Health. Woods appeared
standing behind Barack Obama as his caddy
next to the headline "10 Tips Obama Can
Take From Tiger" in the January 2010 issue of
Golf Digest (0.K., that happened).
I can't say whether these rumors are true
or false the debate never ends. The most
private and famous athlete went from no
body knowing anything about him and as
suming he is boring to nobody knowing any
thing about him and assuming that he is an
Ambien-fueled sex monster whose wife left
him looking like Harvey Dent.
