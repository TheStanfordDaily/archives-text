## CARD GOES COLD Men struggle, go 2-4 over winter break 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In what has become a recurring
trend for Stanford men's basketball,
the winter break slate featured a
number of near misses against promi
nent opponents, coupled with only a
smattering of wins. Its conclusion
a 92-66 slaughtering at the hands of
rival California was the most dis
heartening loss to date.
The Cardinal came out of finals
week in impressive fashion. UC-
Davis' (5-8,1-0 Big West) trip to the
Farm was an unsuccessful one
Stanford (6-7, 0-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) rolled, 85-69. All five starters
finished in double figures and sopho
more Jack Trotter notched the best
performance of his young career, reg
istering a double-double with 14
points and 11 rebounds.
"I wanted to come out aggressive
and get on them before they could get
on us," Trotter said.
Senior Landry Fields, per the
usual, tallied 21 points to lead the
Cardinal. Through 13 games he is
10th in the country and second in the
conference with a 23.2 points per
game average. He did not drop below
20 points in any of the winter break
games.
That included a heartbreaking 71-
70 defeat at the hands of a one-loss
Oklahoma State team (11-2, 0-0 Big
12) at Maples in the Cardinal's next
contest. Stanford played one of its
better games, particularly late in the
second half, but could not overcome a
12-24 performance from the free
throw line. Despite a double-digit
deficit at the midway point of the half,
the Cardinal closed the gap to one
with seven seconds left. Fields, playing
with four fouls and sophomore An
drew Zimmermann, whose 14 points
were a career high, led the resurgence.
With Fields feeding Zimmermann,
the duo established a presence in the
post that Oklahoma State had a hard
time thwarting.
It seemed natural that the game's
final play would be designed for
Fields, with Zimmermann playing a
role, but it did not seem to go as
planned Zimmermann wound up
with the ball and looked for Fields,

who was fairly well defended. He
chose instead to drive, with his shot
falling innocently off the backboard.
"There was so much going in the
last seconds," Fields said. "It just
shook out that I couldn't get the ball."
Stanford's next contest was nearly
as close. The Cardinal traveled to Illi
nois to take on a surprising one-loss
Northwestern squad. Senior Drew
Shiller, who netted 12 points on 4-5
shooting from beyond the arc, led the
Cardinal early. Though tied at the
half, the Wildcats (10-3, 0-2 Big 10)
created a 10-point lead with under six
minutes to play, but nine straight
points from Stanford sharpshooter
sophomore Jeremy Green cut that
gap to one with under two minutes
left.
But further success was fleeting
Northwestern hit their shots and
Stanford did not. The Wildcats
emerged victorious, 70-62. It was an
other attainable win that fell out of
the Cardinal's grasp the team was
not helped by its 28 team fouls, as op
posed to Northwestern's 13. Free
throws continued to be an issue, as
Stanford again shot just 50 percent
from the charity stripe.
Fields and Green continued to im
press against Texas Tech (12-2,0-0 Big
12), combining for 51 points and 19
rebounds, but the Cardinal, despite
just a four point halftime deficit, fell
behind early in the second period and
could not recover the Red
Raiders maintained a steady lead
throughout and won 100-87.
There were silver linings in the
three losses to teams with a combined
three defeats at the time. Among
them were Fields's continued domi
nance and Green's development into
one of the nation's best three-point
threats.
But the shortcomings were also
evident. Sophomore Jarrett Mann
took over point guard duties early in
the year, but he turned the ball over a
combined 16 times over the first two
losses. Outside of Zimmermann
against Oklahoma State, there was
practically no post presence.
The Cardinal did pick up a win
against James Madison (6-6, 0-2

After climbing to a 4-3 record with a convincing win over Portland State in late November, the Stanford men seemed to
have lost some of their swagger when winter break rolled around. The Card dropped four of six games, including a 92-66
drubbing by cross-bay rival California.
CAA) in a harder-than-expected
game. The Dukes led early and pre
vented Stanford from pulling away,
even at home. Still, the Cardinal was
able to create a large enough gap
later and led by nine with 14 seconds
left; it took two desperation three
pointers by James Madison to bring
the final score to 80-76.
But the victory was only a brief
respite Stanford's foray into Pac
-10 competition began with a drub
bing in Berkeley. The Bears (9-4,1-0
Pac-10) led by 20 at the half and had
no answer for senior Jerome Randle,
one of the main contenders (along

with Fields) for conference Player of
the Year.

"Offensively, we wanted to run
our offense. We thought that we've
been doing that pretty efficiently all
year long and we wanted to continue
to try to come down and play with
some poise, keep good spacing, move
the basketball and share it," said
Head Coach Johnny Dawkins. "At
times, we were able to do it well, but
we weren't able to consistently do it
well enough."
The road does not get any easier,
as Stanford will host USC, one of the
best defensive teams in the country,
on Wednesday, as the Cardinal
delves deeper into Pac-10 play, with a
2-4 winter break record in hand.
