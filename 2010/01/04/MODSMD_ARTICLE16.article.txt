# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Playoff push, positive season cut short by Michigan 
### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team's
NCAA tournament run and season
came to an end on Friday, Dec. 11, with a loss to
the Michigan Wolverines in the regional semifi
nals. After dispatching Long Island easily in the
first round and battling to a second-round five
set victory against St. Mary's, the Cardinal fell
to Michigan, 18-25,25-23,22-25,11-25.

Stanford was led in its first-round victory
by senior Janet Okogbaa's 13 kills and junior
libera Gabi Ailes 11 digs, which gave her Stan
ford's career record. After rolling through
their first-round match against Long Island,
Stanford knew it would face a tough opponent
in Saint Mary's, but the Cardinal was up to the
challenge and pulled out an intense five-set
victory, 21-25, 25-21, 25-22, 24-26, 15-13. Ju
niors Alix Klineman and Cassidy Lichtman,
who posted 28 kills and 17 digs and 11 kills, 19

assists and 17 digs, respectively, led Stanford,
who advanced to the regional semifinal with
the win.
"We played a very good St. Mary's team in
the round of 32 and had to fight our way into
the next round," Lichtman said. "I really be
lieve it was sheer will to win that got us
through that match."
In the regional semifinal, the Cardinal
faced a tough Michigan team, and couldn't
pull out the victory. The Cardinal fell behind in

the first set after a 6-1 Michigan run and was
unable to come back. Michigan hit .545 in the
opening set to Stanford's .258 hitting percent
age. After dropping the first set 18-25, Stan
ford found itself down 2-5 to start the second
set. Following a kill and a block by Okogbaa,
Stanford tied the score at seven-all.
More kills by freshman Jessica Walker,
Klineman and Lichtman put Stan
ford up 15-12 before a Michigan run
tied the set at 23-23. A kill by Licht
man and an ace by Walker gave the
Card the second set, 25-23, and tied
up the match.
But the Cardinal couldn't carry
its momentum over to the third set
and fell behind 3-8 early. Stanford
remained down the entire set, rally
ing to within one point at 19-20 after
two aces by Ailes and a kill by Kline
man. It wouldn't be enough, howev
er, and Michigan would take the set,
22-25. In the fourth set, Stanford was
unable to find its offense and lost
the set, 11-25, and the match. Kline
man led the Cardinal with 18 kills
and eight digs, while Okogbaa
ended her Stanford career with nine
kills and five blocks.
"Against Michigan, our passing
broke down a little, we had some
last-minute injuries and our offense
was not balanced enough," Licht
man said. "They were a great team
and they deserved the win."
However, the team remained
positive about the season as a whole
and continued its tradition as a pow
erhouse program. The Cardinal
recorded its ninth consecutive 20-
win season, won its fourth consecu
tive Pacific-10 Conference champi
onship (16th overall) and advanced

to its 29th straight NCAA tourna
ment. Additionally, four members of
the team were named All-Ameri
cans, with Lichtman on the first
team, Klineman and Okogbaa on
the second team and Ailes as an
honorable mention.
"Our team undoubtedly im
proved dramatically from the start
of our season," Okogbaa said.
"There were moments in the begin
ning when just about everybody was
uncertain about how successful we
would be. Our hard work and deter
mination, however, proved to us and
everyone else that we were a good
team and, contrary to poll predic
tions, capable of attaining another
Pac-10 title."
The Cardinal, picked to finish
third in the Pac-10 Coaches Presea
son Poll, exceeded expectations this
year and ended with an overall
record of 23-8.
"The beginning was a bit frus
trating when we were trying to fig
ure out who we were and how to
make our system work but we ended
up with some great high points,"
Lichtman added. "We handed
Washington their first loss of the
season when everyone thought they
were invincible, we beat both
UCLA and USC on the road, and
we had one of the greatest come
backs ever against California to
clinch the Pac-10 title for the fourth
straight year."
