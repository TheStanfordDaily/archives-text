### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team's
NCAA tournament run and season
came to an end on Friday, Dec. 11, with a loss to
the Michigan Wolverines in the regional semifi
nals. After dispatching Long Island easily in the
first round and battling to a second-round five
set victory against St. Mary's, the Cardinal fell
to Michigan, 18-25,25-23,22-25,11-25.

Stanford was led in its first-round victory
by senior Janet Okogbaa's 13 kills and junior
libera Gabi Ailes 11 digs, which gave her Stan
ford's career record. After rolling through
their first-round match against Long Island,
Stanford knew it would face a tough opponent
in Saint Mary's, but the Cardinal was up to the
challenge and pulled out an intense five-set
victory, 21-25, 25-21, 25-22, 24-26, 15-13. Ju
niors Alix Klineman and Cassidy Lichtman,
who posted 28 kills and 17 digs and 11 kills, 19

assists and 17 digs, respectively, led Stanford,
who advanced to the regional semifinal with
the win.
"We played a very good St. Mary's team in
the round of 32 and had to fight our way into
the next round," Lichtman said. "I really be
lieve it was sheer will to win that got us
through that match."
In the regional semifinal, the Cardinal
faced a tough Michigan team, and couldn't
pull out the victory. The Cardinal fell behind in

the first set after a 6-1 Michigan run and was
unable to come back. Michigan hit .545 in the
opening set to Stanford's .258 hitting percent
age. After dropping the first set 18-25, Stan
ford found itself down 2-5 to start the second
set. Following a kill and a block by Okogbaa,
Stanford tied the score at seven-all.
