# WINTER WARRIORS
## 
### NATE ADAMS TOM TAYLOR 
With final exams over, it was time for the
women's basketball team to get back down to
business. The holiday season may have been a nice,
relaxing break for most students, but it was far
from that for this team, with six grueling fixtures
over three weeks.
"I've never played a stretch of games like these
games," said senior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. "I like
the way [Head Coach] Tara [VanDeveer] puts it..
. it's like the [NCAA] Tournament in December."
Half of the Cardinal's games were against top
-10 teams. Stanford went 5-1 over the stretch, losing
only to No. 1 Connecticut.
To kick off their "break," Stanford faced the
DePaul Blue Demons, followed by the No. 7/8
Duke Blue Devils. These ominously hellish
sounding teams could not, however, break the
Cardinal's unbeaten 8-0 run this season, losing 96-
60 and 71-55 respectively.
The Cardinal continued with a tough stretch
against Tennessee (67-52 win), Connecticut (80-68
loss), and a non-conference season finish at Fres
no State (68-46 win). It then began Pacific-10 Con
ference play against rival California (79-58 win).
The first two games were physical challenges
for Stanford, with DePaul and Duke recording 20
and 23 team fouls, respectively the team had to
battle for possession all over the court.
The DePaul game saw senior Jayne Appel pass
the 1,000 rebound mark, becoming only the third
Stanford player to do so. With 22 games left in the

regular season, she is well on target to break the
1,143 record, but it's not what she, or the team, re
ally cares about.
"I think it's cool, but I'd rather win a national
championship," Appel said. "[This statistic] does
n't really have any big reference, kinda in and out
of my head."
The Cardinal continued its solid play against
Duke, It was not a flawless performance, and
though both teams had periods where they
seemed to be gaining the momentum and outplay
ing their opposition, the Cardinal grinded out the
win.
"[We] just stayed with things," said CoachTara
Van Derveer, "even though sometimes it wasn't
pretty.To me it was a heavyweight fight and I'm re
ally proud of how our team did."
The Blue Devils were nothing if not physical
perhaps too physical. One player fouled out, and
several others came close.
But at times this aggression seemed to be hav
ing the desired effect on Stanford, forcing careless
mistakes.
"I really have higher expectations for our
guard play," VanDerveer said. "We broke their
press and then we would throw shots up that
looked like they were gonna break the back
board."
Stanford's next two opponents, like Duke, were
top-10 teams that intended to serve intense com
petition. The Cardinal faced No. 3 Tennessee on

The No. 2 Cardinal women continued their impressive season over winter break, winning
five of six games. Kayla Pedersen, above, averaged 15.5 points per game over the stretch.
