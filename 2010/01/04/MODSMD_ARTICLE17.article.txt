# WINTER WARRIORS
## 
### NATE ADAMS TOM TAYLOR 
With final exams over, it was time for the
women's basketball team to get back down to
business. The holiday season may have been a nice,
relaxing break for most students, but it was far
from that for this team, with six grueling fixtures
over three weeks.
"I've never played a stretch of games like these
games," said senior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. "I like
the way [Head Coach] Tara [VanDeveer] puts it..
. it's like the [NCAA] Tournament in December."
Half of the Cardinal's games were against top
-10 teams. Stanford went 5-1 over the stretch, losing
only to No. 1 Connecticut.
To kick off their "break," Stanford faced the
DePaul Blue Demons, followed by the No. 7/8
Duke Blue Devils. These ominously hellish
sounding teams could not, however, break the
Cardinal's unbeaten 8-0 run this season, losing 96-
60 and 71-55 respectively.
The Cardinal continued with a tough stretch
against Tennessee (67-52 win), Connecticut (80-68
loss), and a non-conference season finish at Fres
no State (68-46 win). It then began Pacific-10 Con
ference play against rival California (79-58 win).
The first two games were physical challenges
for Stanford, with DePaul and Duke recording 20
and 23 team fouls, respectively the team had to
battle for possession all over the court.
The DePaul game saw senior Jayne Appel pass
the 1,000 rebound mark, becoming only the third
Stanford player to do so. With 22 games left in the

regular season, she is well on target to break the
1,143 record, but it's not what she, or the team, re
ally cares about.
"I think it's cool, but I'd rather win a national
championship," Appel said. "[This statistic] does
n't really have any big reference, kinda in and out
of my head."
The Cardinal continued its solid play against
Duke, It was not a flawless performance, and
though both teams had periods where they
seemed to be gaining the momentum and outplay
ing their opposition, the Cardinal grinded out the
win.
"[We] just stayed with things," said CoachTara
Van Derveer, "even though sometimes it wasn't
pretty.To me it was a heavyweight fight and I'm re
ally proud of how our team did."
The Blue Devils were nothing if not physical
perhaps too physical. One player fouled out, and
several others came close.
But at times this aggression seemed to be hav
ing the desired effect on Stanford, forcing careless
mistakes.
"I really have higher expectations for our
guard play," VanDerveer said. "We broke their
press and then we would throw shots up that
looked like they were gonna break the back
board."
Stanford's next two opponents, like Duke, were
top-10 teams that intended to serve intense com
petition. The Cardinal faced No. 3 Tennessee on

The No. 2 Cardinal women continued their impressive season over winter break, winning
five of six games. Kayla Pedersen, above, averaged 15.5 points per game over the stretch.
the 19th, and undefeated No. 1 Con
necticut just four days later. Stanford
fended off a talented Lady Vol squad
en route to a 67-52 victory, but then
faded late against the Huskies as it
fell 80-68 in a rematch of last year's
national semifinals.
The Cardinal's game against Ten
nessee started off with a bang, as both
teams exchanged the lead amid alter
nating offensive spurts.
The Lady Vols put the Cardinal
down 11-4 in the first eight minutes,
thanks to scoring drives led by red
shirt sophomore Kelley Cain and
junior Angie Bjorklund. Stanford
would respond, however, with a big
run of its own.
Over a dominant eight-minute
stretch, the Cardinal outscored Ten
nessee by 18-4. Seven different Stan
ford players scored during the out
burst, and the Cardinal would not sur
render the lead for the rest of the game.
The run ended emphatically on a
three-point basket by Gold-Onwude.
The Stanford guard found the hoop
with another shot from beyond the
arc soon afterward, and added a layup
to give the Cardinal a 30-18 lead at
halftime.

"I'm really proud of how Ros came
in and really helped us," VanDerveer
said. "She had some big shots and
played really hard defensively."

The Cardinal went on to beat the
Vols 67-52, handing Tennessee its
first loss of the season. Junior Kayla
Pedersen led both teams with 16
points, while sophomore Nnemkadi
Ogwumike added 14 of her own.
"They exposed their game to all of
women's basketball today, and it was
n't pretty," said Tennessee Head
Coach Pat Summitt. "They were the
best team today in all aspects of the
game. We've got to get a whole lot
better. We fell apart. Sometimes that
happens."
After besting Tennessee, the Car
dinal headed north for a much-antici
pated matchup with Connecticut.
Going into the contest, Coach Geno
Auriemma's No. 1 Huskies were un
defeated after nine games and hadn't
lost in their last 48 contests.
For the second time in as many
games, the opening 20 minutes were
characterized by alternating bursts of
strong offense. Connecticut took off
to a quick 19-10 lead, led by reigning
Player of the junior Year Maya
Moore.
As in the Tennessee game before
it, however, Stanford was able to re
spond. Pedersen and Ogwumike led a
15-2 run, scoring a combined 11
points as the Cardinal seemed to take
control of the game. Stanford led 25-
21 at the end of the spurt, posting the
biggest lead that any team has held
over UConn this season, and went on
to lead 40-38 at the half.
The Huskies were completely
dominant in the second frame, at one
point going on a 30-6 run. Despite

making only one three-pointer and
shooting 50 percent from the field,
Connecticut managed to take advan
tage of Cardinal turnovers and run
away with the game.
"They came out and were more
aggressive definitely [in the second
half]," said Ogwumike. "What it felt
like for me is that we were kind of
slow to react to what was going on,
and they just went after it. It is hard to
compensate for such aggressive play
and I think that is what really got us."
Stanford, meanwhile, posted less
than half as many points as they did
in their impressive first half. They
were outrebounded 43-29 and out
shot 73-56 from the field, and gave up
17 turnovers during the game before
losing 80-68.
"They didn't care if you got in the
way or not, they are just going in
there," VanDerveer said. "We need
people to step up and take charges in
that situation. They are definitely
head and shoulders above us, and
they just play at a different pace than
anybody. They are moving the ball
and their players are moving and
screening. They played very well to
gether."
Stanford was quick to bounce
back, however, with a dominant 68-
46 victory at Fresno State. Appel led
both teams with 20 points and 18 re
bounds, while Pedersen added 14
points of her own. The Cardinal's
push to victory, though, was kick
started by a Gold-Onwude three
pointer four minutes in. They were
the first points of the game.
Stanford had another slow start
before it bested rival Cal 79-58 to
begin its conference season. The Car
dinal missed 21 of its first 25 shots.
"In the first half, we weren't hit
ting layups and were really lethargic
and slow," Ogwumike said.
Ogwumike would go on to lead
her team to an explosive second half,
scoring 24 points and posting 16 re
bounds, a career high. Pedersen post
ed a double-double as well, with 16
points and 10 rebounds.
With the 5-1 break, Stanford im
proves to 11-1 and maintains its No. 2
national ranking. The Cardinal con
tinues its season this weekend in Los
Angeles, playing USC on Friday at 7
p.m. and UCLA on Sunday at 2 p.m.
