# The 						biggest Bowl of them all
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
Just as ESPN's "most wonderful
week of the year" ends, so be
gins the NFL playoffs and the
lead-up to the most important
bowl of all the Super Bowl.
NFL playoff matchups are set, and
yes, I, too, am appalled that the Jets
a team whose quarterback has
thrown almost twice as many inter
ceptions as touchdowns made it.
Given my success at predicting the
World Series champion back in Octo
ber, I figured I'd take a crack at the
NFL playoffs.
But first, here are some storylines
to watch as the NFL goes bowling.
A Repeat Affair?
No, not you. Pittsburgh. There will
be no repeat Super Bowl champions
this year, as the Pittsburgh Steelers
nose-dived their way out of the play
off arena.
That doesn't mean things won't be
repeating themselves, however. This
wild-card weekend, three of the four
games will feature rematches of week
17 blowouts as Philadelphia takes on
Dallas, Green Bay battles Arizona
and the New York Jets travel to
Cincinnati.
The Eagles, Cardinals and Ben
gals were all victims of thorough
beat-downs on Sunday (in Arizona's
defense, they rested their starters for
most of the game). How they respond
when taking on the same opponent
just a week later could go a long way
in determining which teams advance
to the divisional round.
Arizona and Cincinnati will have
the luxury of playing at home, while
Philadelphia will be in Dallas. It is
hard to beat a team two weeks in a
row, but it is also hard to beat a team
that recently embarrassed you, so all
three match ups are intriguing.
My predictions for Wild Card
weekend: the schizophrenic Eagles'
good side will show up and Philadel
phia will take down Tony Romo and
the Cowboys in Dallas; Green Bay
will have a repeat pounding in Ari
zona; Cincinnati will wake up, realize
Mark Sanchez is terribly unprepared,
and beat the Jets; and New England,
a shell of the pre-spygate franchise,
will lose at home to the fighting John
Harbaughs (aka the Baltimore
Ravens).
Will Lightning Strike Again in San
Diego?
The Chargers have become
perennial powers in the AFC, waltz
ing their way to playoff appearance
after playoff appearance.
But just as reliable as the sun ris
ing in the East is the Chargers laying
an egg come playoff time.
San Diego is unquestionably the
hottest team in the NFL right now,
having won 11 consecutive games,
but four out of the last five years they
have managed to find ways to lose at
the end of otherwise bright seasons.
To say that there is something hang
ing over their heads is an understate
ment.
My predictions for the Divisional
Round: San Diego (temporarily)
overcomes its propensity for postsea
son failure and beats Cincinnati; Indi
anapolis overwhelms Baltimore;
Philadelphia stays hot and takes
down the recently-reeling and over
ly-rested Saints; and in the Brett
Favre bowl (you're welcome for not
writing about it), Favre continues to
exact his revenge against the Packers
by leading the Vikings to victory.
Uh-Oh, Donovan is in the NFC Cham
pionship Again...
Almost as reliable as a Chargers'
postseason choke is an Eagles' loss in
the NFC Championship.
To be more specific, four out of
their last six times in the playoffs
Philadelphia has lost in the NFC
Championship game.
A matchup with mistake-prone
Brett Favre and the Vikings would be
an especially entertaining war of at
trition given Favre's penchant for
throwing crippling postseason inter
ceptions and Donovan McNabb's in
clination to disappear in big games.
That said, it would be a showdown
of some of the best (mostly) young
athletes in football: Desean Jackson,
Jeremy Maclin, Michael Vick, Percy
Harvin and Sidney Rice, to name a
few.
My predictions for Conference

Championships: you can exhale,
Packers fans Favre will melt down
and the Eagles will win in Minnesota
to go to the Super Bowl; and San
Diego's postseason comedy of errors

will return as the Chargers drop a
sloppy one in Indianapolis.

Rest for the Wicked
One lingering question heading
into the postseason is how teams
that rested their starters in the wan
ing weeks of the regular season will
perform come playoff time. (That's
you, Indianapolis and New Or
leans).

History says that resting starters is
foolish, although the New England
Patriots learned this week why it
might make sense when their leading
receiver (Wes Welker) tore his ACL
and MCL in a week 17 loss to Hous
ton.
If the Colts make it to Super Bowl
Sunday, the rest question is moot,
however. But if they don't, Jim Cald
well will be second-guessed more

than anyone this side of Grady Little.
Super Bowl prediction: although I
am vehemently against resting
starters at the end of the season, the
Colts will overcome it because they
are the best team. Indianapolis 31,
Philadelphia 17.
