### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a year-long battle with colon
cancer, Medical School Prof. Geoffrey
Brant Walton died peacefully in his
home on Dec. 17, at the age of 34.
The anesthesia department at the
School of Medicine will rename its
annual teaching excellence award in
memory of Walton, a clinical instructor

in anesthesia.
Walton came to Stanford in 2003 for
a surgery internship at the Stanford
University Medical Center, then stayed
on for his residency prior to joining the
School of Medicine faculty in July 2007.
"Brant was smart, confident and
creative," wrote anesthesia Prof.
Andrew J. Patterson, his former men
tor, in an e-mail to The Daily. "He
liked to figure out better ways of doing

things, both clinically and in the labo
ratory."

An Exceptional Teacher
Ronald Pearl, chairman of the anes
thesia department, said Walton was both
passionate and skilled at teaching. "I
think that had he not died, he would
have become a national leader in teach-

"His ability to teach, invent and develop all
made him a huge asset to academic medicine."
