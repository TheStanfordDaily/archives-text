### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a year-long battle with colon
cancer, Medical School Prof. Geoffrey
Brant Walton died peacefully in his
home on Dec. 17, at the age of 34.
The anesthesia department at the
School of Medicine will rename its
annual teaching excellence award in
memory of Walton, a clinical instructor

in anesthesia.
Walton came to Stanford in 2003 for
a surgery internship at the Stanford
University Medical Center, then stayed
on for his residency prior to joining the
School of Medicine faculty in July 2007.
"Brant was smart, confident and
creative," wrote anesthesia Prof.
Andrew J. Patterson, his former men
tor, in an e-mail to The Daily. "He
liked to figure out better ways of doing

things, both clinically and in the labo
ratory."

An Exceptional Teacher
Ronald Pearl, chairman of the anes
thesia department, said Walton was both
passionate and skilled at teaching. "I
think that had he not died, he would
have become a national leader in teach-

"His ability to teach, invent and develop all
made him a huge asset to academic medicine."

ing," Pearl said.
To pay tribute to Walton, a teach
ing honor will now be named the
Geoffrey Brant Walton Resident
Award for Excellence in Teaching.
The recipient is determined by med
ical students.
Brooks Rohlen, a senior resident
in anesthesia, fondly recalled his
experiences under Walton's supervi
sion for the first year of his residency.
On Rohlen's first day, Walton
showed up with a cup of coffee and
insisted on getting Rohlen one, too.
"Instead of a superior-inferior
relationship, he treated me as an
equal," Rohlen said. "It was a beauti
ful way of approaching a student. He
didn't blow me off, and made sure to
take care of me."
According to Rohlen, when he
shared ideas and concepts about
medical technology over breakfast,
Walton remained supportive. "He's
one of those guys in the world who
everyone tells you 'no,' but he tells
you 'maybe.'" Rohlen said.
Rohlen also highlighted Walton's
teaching methods. "Everyone thinks
they're a good teacher, but his teach
ing was that he identified weakness
es," he said. "He took complex sub
jects and he taught in a simple but
complete way so that it becomes
your strength."
Urologist Tatum Tarin, who com
pleted his residency while Walton
was on staff, agreed. "He could really
break things down for his anesthesi
ology residents," Tarin said. "He was
an exceptional teacher."

"'Golden Hands"

In addition to exceptional teach
ing, Walton will be remembered as
an accomplished researcher.
An emerging mind in modern
medicine, Walton won various

awards including the Anesthesia
Department's Resident Research
Award in 2007 and a prize from the
California Society of
Anesthesiologists.
"Medicine has suffered a huge
loss to lose a mind like that," Rohlen
said. "His ability to teach, invent and
develop all made him a huge asset to
academic medicine."
In 2000, Walton was named a
Howard Hughes scholar. Recipients
of the prestigious fellowship are up
and coming thinkers in the country
who can make a difference on a glob
al scale, according to Rohlen. Using
this scholarship, Walton worked
closely with Dr. Wally Koch at Duke
University, investigating cardiovas
cular physiology and adrenergic
receptor biology.
After completing the fellowship,
Walton came to Stanford to further
his research in cardiovascular physi
ology. Patterson mentored Walton
during his fellowship at the Stanford
Medical Center.
According to Patterson, Walton
taught several members of his labo
ratory team how to perform the
microsurgery techniques that he had
developed in the Koch lab.
"Brant was a phenomenal
researcher," Patterson wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
"[Walton] was known to have
'golden hands' in the laboratory," he
added. "He quickly showed us why
when he started to work in my labo
ratory."
Walton's work on gene expres
sion profiling, done in Patterson's
lab, will be published in Critical
Care Medicine in January 2010.
Prior to his diagnosis of cancer,
Walton also co-authored 10 publica
tions.
"Unfortunately, Brant [Walton]
developed cancer before he could
realize his full potential with regard
to research," Patterson wrote. "He
would likely have developed novel
means of monitoring the cardiovas
cular system his talent was excep-

tional.
"[He] would have invented some
thing to save lives, and he would have
contributed to a better understand
ing of heart disease," Patterson
added. "He was just reaching a point
in his life where he could make a sig
nificant difference."
A Renaissance Man
To his friends and family, Walton
was recognized as an extroverted
Renaissance man. He was a musi
cian, scholar, cook, photographer,
nature enthusiast, builder, traveler
and wine connoisseur.
"He knew so much about history
and literature, and he was an accom
plished musician," Tarin said. "He
was a national champion jazz drum
mer. He was a phenomenal cook and
father."
"He just enjoyed life," added
Brenda Walton, his mother.
Walton valued learning and really
wanted his son to love learning too,
according to Rohlen.
"His biggest concern as a dying
father was that his son got to go to
college and learn," he said. "The fact
that he wasn't going to be around for
his family was really on his mind
he was such a caring guy."
"He loved his son and wife,"
added his younger brother, Zaak
Walton.
Walton also kept an online jour
nal of his fight with cancer in order to
keep his family and friends updated
about his status.
"Everyone loved him and every
body loved being around him," Tarin
said. "He will be missed."
A memorial service will be held
on campus later this month.

After a year-long battle with colon
cancer, Medical School Prof. Geoffrey
Brant Walton died peacefully in his
home on Dec. 17, at the age of 34.
The anesthesia department at the
School of Medicine will rename its
annual teaching excellence award in
memory of Walton, a clinical instructor

in anesthesia.
Walton came to Stanford in 2003 for
a surgery internship at the Stanford
University Medical Center, then stayed
on for his residency prior to joining the
School of Medicine faculty in July 2007.
"Brant was smart, confident and
creative," wrote anesthesia Prof.
Andrew J. Patterson, his former men
tor, in an e-mail to The Daily. "He
liked to figure out better ways of doing

things, both clinically and in the labo
ratory."

An Exceptional Teacher
Ronald Pearl, chairman of the anes
thesia department, said Walton was both
passionate and skilled at teaching. "I
think that had he not died, he would
have become a national leader in teach-

"His ability to teach, invent and develop all
made him a huge asset to academic medicine."

ing," Pearl said.
To pay tribute to Walton, a teach
ing honor will now be named the
Geoffrey Brant Walton Resident
Award for Excellence in Teaching.
The recipient is determined by med
ical students.
Brooks Rohlen, a senior resident
in anesthesia, fondly recalled his
experiences under Walton's supervi
sion for the first year of his residency.
On Rohlen's first day, Walton
showed up with a cup of coffee and
insisted on getting Rohlen one, too.
"Instead of a superior-inferior
relationship, he treated me as an
equal," Rohlen said. "It was a beauti
ful way of approaching a student. He
didn't blow me off, and made sure to
take care of me."
According to Rohlen, when he
shared ideas and concepts about
medical technology over breakfast,
Walton remained supportive. "He's
one of those guys in the world who
everyone tells you 'no,' but he tells
you 'maybe.'" Rohlen said.
Rohlen also highlighted Walton's
teaching methods. "Everyone thinks
they're a good teacher, but his teach
ing was that he identified weakness
es," he said. "He took complex sub
jects and he taught in a simple but
complete way so that it becomes
your strength."
Urologist Tatum Tarin, who com
pleted his residency while Walton
was on staff, agreed. "He could really
break things down for his anesthesi
ology residents," Tarin said. "He was
an exceptional teacher."

"'Golden Hands"

In addition to exceptional teach
ing, Walton will be remembered as
an accomplished researcher.
An emerging mind in modern
medicine, Walton won various

awards including the Anesthesia
Department's Resident Research
Award in 2007 and a prize from the
California Society of
Anesthesiologists.
"Medicine has suffered a huge
loss to lose a mind like that," Rohlen
said. "His ability to teach, invent and
develop all made him a huge asset to
academic medicine."
In 2000, Walton was named a
Howard Hughes scholar. Recipients
of the prestigious fellowship are up
and coming thinkers in the country
who can make a difference on a glob
al scale, according to Rohlen. Using
this scholarship, Walton worked
closely with Dr. Wally Koch at Duke
University, investigating cardiovas
cular physiology and adrenergic
receptor biology.
After completing the fellowship,
Walton came to Stanford to further
his research in cardiovascular physi
ology. Patterson mentored Walton
during his fellowship at the Stanford
Medical Center.
According to Patterson, Walton
taught several members of his labo
ratory team how to perform the
microsurgery techniques that he had
developed in the Koch lab.
"Brant was a phenomenal
researcher," Patterson wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
"[Walton] was known to have
'golden hands' in the laboratory," he
added. "He quickly showed us why
when he started to work in my labo
ratory."
Walton's work on gene expres
sion profiling, done in Patterson's
lab, will be published in Critical
Care Medicine in January 2010.
Prior to his diagnosis of cancer,
Walton also co-authored 10 publica
tions.
"Unfortunately, Brant [Walton]
developed cancer before he could
realize his full potential with regard
to research," Patterson wrote. "He
would likely have developed novel
means of monitoring the cardiovas
cular system his talent was excep-

tional.
"[He] would have invented some
thing to save lives, and he would have
contributed to a better understand
ing of heart disease," Patterson
added. "He was just reaching a point
in his life where he could make a sig
nificant difference."
A Renaissance Man
To his friends and family, Walton
was recognized as an extroverted
Renaissance man. He was a musi
cian, scholar, cook, photographer,
nature enthusiast, builder, traveler
and wine connoisseur.
"He knew so much about history
and literature, and he was an accom
plished musician," Tarin said. "He
was a national champion jazz drum
mer. He was a phenomenal cook and
father."
"He just enjoyed life," added
Brenda Walton, his mother.
Walton valued learning and really
wanted his son to love learning too,
according to Rohlen.
"His biggest concern as a dying
father was that his son got to go to
college and learn," he said. "The fact
that he wasn't going to be around for
his family was really on his mind
he was such a caring guy."
"He loved his son and wife,"
added his younger brother, Zaak
Walton.
Walton also kept an online jour
nal of his fight with cancer in order to
keep his family and friends updated
about his status.
"Everyone loved him and every
body loved being around him," Tarin
said. "He will be missed."
A memorial service will be held
on campus later this month.
