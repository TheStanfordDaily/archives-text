## Research links aircraft flights with warming Air travel responsible for 4-8 percent of global climate change, says study

That flight back to Stanford may have had a
bigger impact on climate change than previous
ly thought.
According to a study by civil and environ
mental engineering Prof. Mark Jacobson, com
mercial aircraft flights have contributed four to
eight percent of global surface warming since air
temperature records began in 1850.
The first study of its kind analyzing commer
cial airlines, the results also showed that aircraft
flights are responsible for an estimated 15 to 20
percent of warming in the Arctic.
Jacobson ran simulations using the aircraft
emissions data for every commercial flight in
the year 2004 and repeated the process for data
from 2006. These numbers were entered into a
computer model that also analyzed background
pollution, clouds and radiation fields to predict
how the emitted particles interacted chemically
with atmospheric gases and aerosols.
"It's a really complex soup of interactions
occurring, but in the end it's pretty relatively
organized," Jacobson said.
"We can then look at differences between
running simulations with and without aircraft to
see the changes in temperature and atmospher
ic composition of the clouds that result," he
added.
Aircraft engines emit particles that serve as
sites on which clouds condense, forming the trail
of vapor, known as "contrails," that are some
times seen behind planes. These contrails reflect
sunlight but also absorb infrared radiation
due to the black carbon found in emitted soot
which changes atmospheric radiation balance.
Once contrails dissipate they also affect larg
er-scale cloud formation because the remnants
of the contrails serve as nuclei on which other
clouds form.
