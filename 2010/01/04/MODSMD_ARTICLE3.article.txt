## Research links aircraft flights with warming Air travel responsible for 4-8 percent of global climate change, says study

That flight back to Stanford may have had a
bigger impact on climate change than previous
ly thought.
According to a study by civil and environ
mental engineering Prof. Mark Jacobson, com
mercial aircraft flights have contributed four to
eight percent of global surface warming since air
temperature records began in 1850.
The first study of its kind analyzing commer
cial airlines, the results also showed that aircraft
flights are responsible for an estimated 15 to 20
percent of warming in the Arctic.
Jacobson ran simulations using the aircraft
emissions data for every commercial flight in
the year 2004 and repeated the process for data
from 2006. These numbers were entered into a
computer model that also analyzed background
pollution, clouds and radiation fields to predict
how the emitted particles interacted chemically
with atmospheric gases and aerosols.
"It's a really complex soup of interactions
occurring, but in the end it's pretty relatively
organized," Jacobson said.
"We can then look at differences between
running simulations with and without aircraft to
see the changes in temperature and atmospher
ic composition of the clouds that result," he
added.
Aircraft engines emit particles that serve as
sites on which clouds condense, forming the trail
of vapor, known as "contrails," that are some
times seen behind planes. These contrails reflect
sunlight but also absorb infrared radiation
due to the black carbon found in emitted soot
which changes atmospheric radiation balance.
Once contrails dissipate they also affect larg
er-scale cloud formation because the remnants
of the contrails serve as nuclei on which other
clouds form.

The impact of these emissions is
magnified in the Arctic, where con
trails absorb infrared radiation from
both direct sunlight and light reflect
ed back upward by the highly reflec
tive snow and ice. Once the edges of
the ice melt to reveal the water
below, the ocean absorbs even more
radiation, accelerating climate
change.
Aircraft emission pollutants are
short-lived, but they can still have a
significant effect on the environ
ment, Jacobson explained.
"You can ramp up those temper
ature changes with short-lived pollu
tants," he said. "I mean, you can have
that temperature effect due to brief
periods of emissions you don't
need hundred-year emissions to get

that temperature change," he added.
World airline passenger traffic
fell 3.1 percent amid last year's glob
al financial crisis, the biggest drop in
aviation industry history, according
to figures from the International
Civil Aviation Organization. Even
so, black carbon emissions would
have to be reduced 20-fold to halt
Arctic warming, Jacobson said.
"There's a general statement that
can be made about all pollution
sources we should take action to
reduce all pollution," Jacobson
explained. "All combustion causes
some kind of air pollution or climate
problem, so we should always be
aggressively trying to reduce com
bustion toward alternatives that
don't combust or combust much
cleaner materials."
To meet this challenge, airplane
manufacturer Boeing recently
designed a lighter-weight, more
energy efficient plane, according to
Jacobson. The company is also

developing lower sulfur emission
fuels.

Still, even cleaner-burning fuel is
possible, Jacobson said.
"If you really were to take it to

the next level, you would want to go
to maybe liquid hydrogen air
planes," he said.
Studies from the European
Commission have shown that a
hydrogen-fueled airplane is possible,
but the technology must still under
go rigorous safety tests, Jacobson
said. Though hydrogen fuel has been
used for the space shuttle, Jacobson
predicts that hydrogen-fueled planes
are still 10 to 20 years away.
"We have plenty of examples of
hydrogen being used, but it's a ques
tion of whether you can do it at low
cost or not," he said. "There's also
transforming the whole fleet it's a
long process."
Jacobson presented his study at
the Geophysical Union's annual
meeting in December. The paper is
currently being peer reviewed and is
awaiting publication.
