# EARLY ACTION
## During holidays, Univ. gives gift of admission to 753 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
The Office of Undergraduate Admission
announced Monday that 753 restrictive
early action applicants, or 13.5 percent of
the 5,566 early applicants, were accepted to
Stanford. Almost as many early applicants
were deferred to the regular decision cycle
as accepted via early action.
"We deferred just over 700 students to
regular decision," Director of

Undergraduate Admission Shawn Abbott
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Approximately 87 percent of students who
applied for admission, however, received a
final (admit or deny) admission decision."
The 13.5 percent admit rate for early
action applications represents an increase
from the early action cycle in 2008, when
Stanford accepted 12.8 percent of early
action applications, or 689 early applicants
from a pool of 5,363 applications.
This year's total of 5,566 early action

applications is the highest in the
University's history and represents an
increase of almost 3.8 percent from last
year's previous record of 5,363 early appli
cations.
While the date for announcement of
early action admission results is Dec. 15, the
admission office this year notified appli
cants of their admission statuses at 3 p.m. on
Dec. 11, four days ahead of schedule.
"The admission committee finalized its
selection process earlier than anticipated,

and in an effort to quell anxiety among
applicants, parents, counselors and alumni,
[Admission and Financial Aid] Dean
[Richard] Shaw made the executive deci
sion to release decisions today, December
11," the office announced on its Web site,
"Well over 90 percent of students
opened their e-mail decisions within 72
hours, even though they were not expecting
to receive their decision e-mails until
December 15," Abbott said.
In November, The Daily reported
that 5,583 students had applied early
action to Stanford. The discrepancy
in the final tally results from the fact
that the admission office allowed
some students to change their appli
cation statuses from restrictive early
action to regular decision.
Because restrictive early action is
a non-binding option, admitted stu
dents will have until May 1 to
respond to the University's offer of
admission.
