## Card falls to Oklahoma in long-awaited bowl game 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford football team waited eight
years to play in a bowl game, but it will
have to wait longer to achieve its first bowl
win since 1996. The Cardinal (8-5, 6-3
Pacific-10 Conference) fell to the
Oklahoma Sooners (8-5, 5-3 Big 12) 31-27
on New Year's Eve at the Sun Bowl, which

happens to be the site of Stanford's last
bowl win.
Stanford came into the game at a large
disadvantage due to redshirt freshman
quarterback Andrew Luck's finger injury,
which was expected to severely limit his
ability to play against Oklahoma. Despite
numerous reports during the week of the
game that his finger was improving, Luck
did not dress for the game. The Cardinal

instead had to rely on fifth-year senior
Tavita Pritchard to lead the offense.
Although Pritchard has a great deal of
starting experience, including the famous
24-23 upset of USC in 2007, he seemed
overmatched by the Sooner defense, which
ranks in the national top 10 in overall scor
ing, red zone, total and rushing defense.

Though they led at halftime, the Cardinal couldn't hold on long enough for victory at last Thursday's Sun Bowl against
Oklahoma. Heisman runner-up Toby Gerhart posted 135 rushing yards and two touchdowns in the close contest, which
may prove to be the running back's last game in the Cardinal uniform.
Pritchard had not started a game
in over a year, and his rust showed
early on when he threw an intercep
tion on the third play of the game.
The Sooners wasted little time in
cashing in Stanford's mistake, as red
shirt freshman quarterback Landry
Jones threw a 30-yard strike to soph
omore Ryan Broyles for the first
score of the game.
Jones quickly returned the favor,
though, throwing an interception to
senior safety Bo McNally, who re
turned the ball 55 yards to the Okla
homa 14. Stanford likewise cashed in
that turnover as well, scoring on a
one-yard run by junior fullback
Owen Marecic.
Oklahoma then drove the length
of the field, picking up 73 yards on 11
plays. Despite Jones completing all
seven of his passes on the drive, Ok
lahoma was forced to settle for a field
goal. On the attempt, freshman kick
er Patrick O 'Hara hit the upright, but
the play was blown dead for a false
start, and O'Hara converted his sec
ond chance.
Following another interception
by Pritchard and a punt by Okla
homa, Stanford converted its best of
fensive play of the game. Pritchard
rolled out from his own 39-yard line,
avoiding the rush of Ail-American
junior defensive tackle Gerald
McCoy, and heaved a prayer upfield.
Junior wide receiver Ryan Whalen
adjusted to the severely under
thrown pass and caught it in triple
coverage, breaking multiple tackles
and taking the ball all the way to the
Oklahoma 19. Heisman runner-up
and Doak Walker winner senior
Toby Gerhart punched in the next
play for a 19-yard touchdown, put
ting Stanford ahead for the first time

in the game, 14-10.
The lead did not last long, though,
because Jones and Broyles connect
ed four times on the next drive,
capped by a 13-yard touchdown.
Stanford then responded with a 79-
yard drive that ended with another
impressive run by Gerhart, who
evaded several tacklers, only to fum
ble into the end zone. Multiple Soon
ers had a chance to recover the fum
ble for a touchback, but Gerhart
dove into the pile and found the ball
to score the touchdown.
Up 21-17, Stanford held Okla
homa deep in Sooner territory, and
senior cornerback Richard Sherman
came in untouched to block the punt.
Stanford took over at the Oklahoma
11, but was forced to settle for a field
goal by junior kicker Nate Whitaker
after a clipping penalty put the of
fense in a whole. The Cardinal held
the Sooners scoreless on their final
drive of the half to go into halftime
leading 24-17.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
though, the lead at halftime was the
last of the game for the Cardinal. Ok
lahoma scored on the first drive of
the second half when Jones hit
Broyles for a third touchdown, and
the Sooners never looked back.
The Cardinal could not manage

any offense in the third quarter, and
the Sooners scored another touch
down on a one-yard run by junior
running back DeMarco Murray.
Stanford received an enormous
break when sophomore cornerback
Johnson Bademosi appeared to in
terfere with Broyles on a punt re
turn, causing a fumble, but the refer
ees picked up the flag and awarded
the ball to Stanford. Despite the
break and a crucial personal foul
penalty against Oklahoma, Stanford
could only manage a field goal by
Whitaker two minutes into the
fourth quarter, making the score 31-
27.
After both teams exchanged
punts, Oklahoma embarked on a 17-
play, 75-yard drive that used up over
six minutes. O'Hara missed a 32-yard
field goal, though, allowing Stanford
one final drive with a chance to win
the game.
The Cardinal could not even man
age a first down, however, as
Pritchard threw into coverage multi
ple times and Stanford could not
convert on fourth down. Oklahoma
ran the rest of the clock out to secure
the victory.
Stanford's disadvantage on the
scoreboard was minuscule compared
to its deficit on the stat sheets. Okla

homa outgained Stanford All yards
to 262 yards for the game, converting
28 first downs to Stanford's 13.
The Cardinal's biggest disadvan
tage was in the passing game, where
it could not stop the Sooners. Jones
finished the game completing 30 of
51 passes for 418 yards and three
touchdowns with one interception.
On the other hand, Pritchard only
completed eight of 19 passes for 117
yards with no touchdowns and two
interceptions.
"That was the difference in the
game, really, because our defense
shut down the run," said Stanford
Head Coach Jim Harbaugh. "[We
gave up] too many big plays, too
many easy plays, too many yards in
the passing game."
Broyles caught a team-record 13
passes for 156 yards with a Sun Bowl
record three receiving touchdowns,
and was named the Sun Bowl Most
Valuable Player. Gerhart had a good
day on the ground for the Cardinal,
rushing 32 times for 135 yards and
two touchdowns.
After the game, Gerhart was am
biguous about his future plans.
"I'm not sure yet. I'll talk about it
with the coaches and my family and
decide where to go from there,"
Most expect Gerhart to enter the
NFL Draft this year, but whether or
not he stays at school, Stanford is op
timistic about its future.
"Our guys fought as hard as they
could," Harbaugh said. "They've
been to the top of the mountain,
looked over and seen what's on the
other side and said, 'This is where we
want to be.'"
