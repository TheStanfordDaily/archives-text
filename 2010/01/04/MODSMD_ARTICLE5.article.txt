## Card falls to Oklahoma in long-awaited bowl game 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford football team waited eight
years to play in a bowl game, but it will
have to wait longer to achieve its first bowl
win since 1996. The Cardinal (8-5, 6-3
Pacific-10 Conference) fell to the
Oklahoma Sooners (8-5, 5-3 Big 12) 31-27
on New Year's Eve at the Sun Bowl, which

happens to be the site of Stanford's last
bowl win.
Stanford came into the game at a large
disadvantage due to redshirt freshman
quarterback Andrew Luck's finger injury,
which was expected to severely limit his
ability to play against Oklahoma. Despite
numerous reports during the week of the
game that his finger was improving, Luck
did not dress for the game. The Cardinal

instead had to rely on fifth-year senior
Tavita Pritchard to lead the offense.
Although Pritchard has a great deal of
starting experience, including the famous
24-23 upset of USC in 2007, he seemed
overmatched by the Sooner defense, which
ranks in the national top 10 in overall scor
ing, red zone, total and rushing defense.

Though they led at halftime, the Cardinal couldn't hold on long enough for victory at last Thursday's Sun Bowl against
Oklahoma. Heisman runner-up Toby Gerhart posted 135 rushing yards and two touchdowns in the close contest, which
may prove to be the running back's last game in the Cardinal uniform.
