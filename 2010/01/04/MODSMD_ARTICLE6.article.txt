## Opening of Coupa Cafe pushed back Site of former MoonBean's may remain vacant until Feb. 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Coupa Cafe will not be open for the
start of winter quarter, and the kiosk that
once held Moonßean's Coffee will remain
empty until mid-February at the earli
est.
The site remains vacant due to continu
ing negotiations over the building permit.
Accommodating Coupa's food service
required retrofitting the Moonßean's site,
as well as meeting county regulations for
food preparation.
"The permitting business all has to do
with expanding the food service at the
kiosk," said Andrew Herkovic, director of
communications and development for
Stanford Libraries.
Stanford is currently awaiting word on
its latest permit application. When a build
ing permit is issued, contractors are then
expected to take five weeks for construc
tion at the site. Coupa Cafe will then need
time to dress and finalize the site following
construction.
"Assuming that the latest negotiation
will satisfy the county, we are looking at
mid-February [for an opening]," Herkovic
said.
If permit negotiations extend longer,
the Coupa opening could be delayed even
further.
According to Herkovic, as of Jan. 5 an
automated espresso machine will be avail
able in Meyer Library. Herkovic said the
machine was "not a solution," but that its
presence would serve some of the needs of
students, particularly during late-night
hours.
