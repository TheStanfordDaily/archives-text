## CROSS BORDER AWARENESS STUDENTS WORK FOR IMMIGRATION JUSTICE 
### SUSANNA KIM 
""W~uan Manuel, a burly 31-year-old day worker
I from Mexico, received the nickname
I "Conan" during his first week at the Day
I Worker Center of Mountain View.
I arrived, a coworker said that Conan
is the name of a wrestler in Mexico," Manuel said.
"He said, 'you look like him. Do you mind if I call
you that here?"'
For three years, Manuel has been coming to
the Day Worker Center, a central place for labor
ers to connect with employers who need tempo
rary work in jobs like carpentry and landscaping.
Students from the Stanford Immigrant Rights
Project (SIRP), an undergraduate organization
spreading awareness about immigration justice,
have been collaborating with day workers like
Manuel each Saturday since last quarter.
"Day laborers can come here and work out a
fair wage," said SIRP member Lauren Swartz 'll.
"Otherwise, there's the danger that an employer
could drop off workers on the street without pay
after they've been landscaping all day."
A group of 15 SIRP members come weekly to
offer English as a Second Language (ESL) tutor
ing and build relationships with the workers.
"I think we all would like to see our broken
immigration system being repaired, as it affects
human lives and neighbors in all our communities
every day," said Minh Dan Vuong 'll, one of the
founding members.
The idea of SIRP originated during the popu
lar Alternative Spring Break (ASB) trips last
spring quarter. Many of the SIRP volunteers par
ticipated in the Arizona or San Diego programs.
SIRP President Sharada Jambulapati 'l2, an
Arizona ASB alumna, commented on the great
resulting influence of her trip.
"After our Arizona trip, our group felt really
stirred by what we saw at the border in terms of
border patrol, vigilantes, human rights issues and
in terms of what
these immi
grants face,"

she said. "We had a lot of questions. How do we
not make one service trip temporary? How do we
make it so that it can contribute to change?"
Swartz took part in the week-long San Diego
trip entitled "Crossing the Line(s): Immigration
in San Diego" in which students got a first-hand
look at immigrant communities along the border.
She, too, noted the impact she felt after directly
witnessing border crossing experiences.
"We learned that people are human beings
and shouldn't die when crossing," Swartz said.
Executive Director of the Day Worker Center
Maria Marroquin sympathized with the chal
lenges of day workers, having immigrated from
Mexico in 1996. The hardships she saw inspired
her to create the Center as a resource for the
workers.
"I came here 17 years ago as a former teacher
without any English," she explained. "I had a very
hard time finding employment, so I did house
cleaning. These day workers have children in uni
versities in Mexico or elsewhere and this is the
only way for them to provide for them."
SIRP members and other volunteers also offer
lunches and workshops on topics like CPR train
ing or computer skills.
"Conan" Manuel said he comes to the Center
every day and signs up on a daily list to get tem
porary work in the neighboring community.
"Today there are two lists on the wall with 88
men on one list and 17 women on the other list,"
he said in Spanish and English. "It depends who
can do a good job and who has experience."
When asked what he enjoys about the Center,
Manuel said the community aspect was key.
"I like the family of friends," he said. "We
share the food from 11 to 11:30, and then have
EST classes for three hours. Meanwhile, you wait
for work."
Marroquin said she appreciates the Center's
relationship with SIRP.
"I'm very excited honestly about this,"
Marroquin said. "It was sort
of my dream to have
youth involved with the
Day Worker Center

because I had an assumption that many people in
this area really believed life is easy and take many
things for granted."
Marroquin believes that SIRP students offer a
vital perspective in addition to English tutoring
and skills training.
"English is important, but all the different
experiences that the students bring are highly
appreciated," she said. "It's very important to
have the workers and students learn about their
different cultures from each other."
Jambulapati believes the Stanford community
can learn from the Center amid prevailing mis
conceptions about immigration.
"The media often portrays immigrants as
stealing our jobs or wanting economic gains for
themselves, but the reality is that they have no
options in most of their countries," she said.
"They want to provide for their families and the
media doesn't put a human face on them."
Jambulapati and the other SIRP members are
planning a number of events to raise awareness
about immigrants' rights issues this year. They
have also worked with the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) to assure that campus land
scaping workers receive fair treatment.
SIRP member Justine Corella 'll hopes to
bring other student organizations to the Center.
"Although SIRP is a new group, I feel that it
has great potential to raise awareness at Stanford
in the future, especially through the outreaches to
the Day Worker Center," she said.
To foster discussion about immigration issues,
SIRP hosted a screening of "Rabbit Proof Fence"
about Australian border fences on Nov. 19.

"I encourage people to [watch it] because bor
der issues are important to immigrant rights,"
Jambulapati said. "The movie will open people's
eyes to seeing that fences are not the best solu
tions since people will risk everything, including
their lives, to cross the border. Instead of milita
rization, we need more policy and humane solu
tions for the problem."
