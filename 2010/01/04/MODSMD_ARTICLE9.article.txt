Watching the Rose Parade
Little cousin passes gas
Little cousin (embarrassed):
Sorry...
Uncle Jeff: You know son, all
odors are particulate.
Aunt Carol: Hahahahahaha. Oh,
god. Why did I laugh at that.
Little cousin: ... What? I don't
get it.
... A minute passes ...
Little cousin: No, really, I don't
get it. What do you mean?
Aunt Carol: HE MEANS that
there are LITTLE PIECES OF
POOP from your behind flying
everywhere around this room
right now.
Overheard at a family holiday
party
Uncle Bob: If I'm going to play
Santa, I need at least another two
drinks.
Aunt: What's your girlfriend's
name?
Nephew: Emma.
Aunt: Hey, wow! Our dog is
named Emma.
Nephew: Oh.
Them: Why are you back so
soon?
Us: We were about to go into the
movie, but then we thought to
ourselves, "It's the holidays. We
only get to see our family all
together like this once a year,
and it would be a shame to waste
that precious time sitting in a
theater rather than with those we
love most. So we came back to
spend time with you.
Them: Avatar was sold out, was
n't it?
Us: GodDAMN it.

Cousin: I can think of no better
way to celebrate Jesus' birthday
than by taking a tequila shot
right now.

Aunt: What's your girlfriend's
name again?
Nephew: Emma.
Aunt: Oh right. Hey, did you

know that's our dog's name?
Nephew: Yeah, you mentioned
that.
Overheard in line at the grocery
store
"Why would you throw a snow
ball at a cop car!?"
At a party
Friend 1: You don't have the
palate for shortbread.
... Later on ...
Friend 1: My parents have this
$6,000 bottle of scotch want to
try some?
Friend 2: Ewww, no! It's smoky!
Ewww, that'll taste like Chipotle.
Dad, racing into the living room
"Hon, where did you put my
back scratcher-slash-hairbrush?"
At a family party
Family is engaged in a heated
debate over immigration in a
restaurant. The debate-ending
comment:
Dad: If you don't have strong bor
ders, you have Barnes and Noble.
Whispered at cousin's house
"The mother was worried that it
might not be big enough ..."
Overheard at a Clippers 76ers
game
"76ers? More like Seventy-duck
my-dicksers."
"Allan Iverson? More like
Barely Aliverson."
Post-holiday phone conversation
between two friends
Friend 1: How was your
Christmas?
Friend 2: Well, my dad burnt the
lamb, but only on the outside. So
my little brother had to
microwave his because it was so
pink, it was basically still
BAAAH-ing. And the house got
all smoky, so we had to open the
door even though it was freezing
outside. And then the cat ran out.
Friend 1: Wow, sounds terrible.
Friend 2: The saddest part is that
the same thing happens every
year. My dad should really cook
lamb more often, or not at a11...
