## EDITORIAL For the community, a new quarter and a new decade 
### ANDREW VALENCIA Editorial Board Chair 
On behalf of the Stanford Daily Vol. 236
Editorial Board, I would like to wel
come the Stanford community back
to campus for the start of the winter quarter,
and the beginning of a brand new decade. In
September, at the onset of the volume, the
current Edit Board had yet to be assembled;
we were hitting the ground running from the
first week on, unsure of how the quarter
would unfold. Now, as a new quarter begins
and a new volume lies just over a month
away, I can say in earnest that I am thrilled to
be rejoined with my colleagues on the Board
and at The Daily for the first volume of the
second decade of the century.
At the closing of the decade of the
"zeros," "aughts" or "thousands," the feeling
across America was an understandable mix
ture of relief and anxiety relief that one of
the most disappointing decades in its history
was finally at an end, and anxiety over what
the future may hold. While its body is not
even cold in the ground, journalists have al
ready begun labeling the past 10 years as a
lost decade. And it is not hard to see why
with the shock of September 11 on one end
and the collapse of our financial and eco
nomic security on the other, the decade's en
trance and exit were both defined by panic,
fear and uncertainty. In between these two
major shocks, the country waged two wars in
the Middle East, at least one of which still
threatens to lumber on well into the new
decade. Less discussed in the media was the
plight of the American working people,
whose average salaries and range of opportu
nities stagnated throughout the decade while
CEOs made billions, culminating in the first
decade in 70 years during which there was no
overall job growth in America.
Here at Stanford, 10 classes of students

have graduated since the start of the century,
with the Class of'lo being the first of the new
decade. Since we arrived on campus in 2006
or earlier, some of the major events we have
seen have been, as is often case, a combina
tion or synthesis of local happenings here on
campus and the larger goings on of the wider
world. In November of 2008, the world wit
nessed two major events on the same day
that affected many people on campus differ
ently: the election of Barack Obama and the
passage of Proposition 8. More recently, the
troubles of the global economy touched
Stanford's endowment, leading to cuts in
budget expenses and staff positions. For the
individual gay or lesbian student on campus,
or the individual staff member who lost his or
her job, the boundary between the nice and
private world they enjoyed on campus and
the rhythms of the larger world suddenly fell
away. These examples serve as cold reminder
that, even amid the sunny glow of the Stan
ford bubble, we all are, as individuals,
touched by the larger world.
This lesson applicable for both Stan
ford and America as a whole may go down
in history as the great lesson of the last
decade. Here on the Editorial Board, we
have committed ourselves to reaching a bal
ance between addressing the issues of the
day here on campus from scheduling poli
cies to Full Moon on the Quad and
greater issues of the world at large. Coming
into the new quarter, we will remain commit
ted to looking beyond our own daily world
view to the policies and practices that touch
us all, not just as members of the Stanford
community, but as citizens of the world.
