# A 						BROAD ABROAD
## Broadly Speaking: The Language of the Business World 
### Molly Spaeth 
I spent three months in Spain, and let me
tell you, I learned a lot.
I mastered enough Spanish to justify the
"working fluency" currently listed under the
"Skills" section on my resume. I learned
enough about olive oil and Spanish cuisine to
make tortilla de patata. And I learned proba
bly more than I ever cared to know about
how to get your severely dehydrated room
mate into a hospital and hooked up to an IV
on a Spanish national holiday whilst you both
suffer from food poisoning. But oddly
enough, one of the most important lessons I
learned wasn't some great domestic, political
or cultural phenomenon.
No; the most important lesson I learned
came from a 10-minute conversation with a
30-year-old Spanish entrepreneur.
I had the opportunity while studying in
Madrid to intern for a technology start-up
called Opinno, Open Innovation. Our team
in the Madrid office was small but tight-knit,
and one of our larger responsibilities this fall
was organizing the first annual "Competi
tion de los Emprendedores," an event aimed
at developing relationships between Spanish
technology start-ups and Silicon Valley
angel investors.
The design of the competition was pretty
simple. Forty-eight different Spanish entre
preneurs submitted 90-second elevator
pitches to our company, which were then
evaluated by a variety of pre-selected Amer
ican judges. The top ten ideas were then se
lected to compete in the final round of judg
ing held in Madrid, complete with five new
American judges, an investment forum and a
ten-minute question-and-answer session.
The only catch? Everything had to be in
English.
For most of the competition, each finalist
demonstrated a relatively high proficiency
in English, and both judges and finalists
could understand each other well enough.
But when Cesar Marco, the CEO of Rhyth
mography, a teaching tool geared toward
helping the hearing-impaired learn to read
music, came to the podium and asked for a
translator, we [the Opinno team] all looked
at each other frantically. We didn't HAVE a
professional translator.
Eventually, our CFO, Tomas Baylac,
stepped up to the plate and began to trans
late. But because he wasn't a professional, a
large part of Marco's presentation was (ex
cuse the pun) lost in translation, and the evi
dence of this confusion was clearly visible on
the judges' faces.
An hour later, I took a seat next to Marco

and asked him to explain his product and
business model to me, in his native Spanish.
Ten minutes into our conversation, there
wasn't a doubt in my mind that his product
and passion were the most impressive I had
seen that day. But because of Marco's inabil
ity to communicate in the "language of the
business world," Rhythmography didn't
even place.
I'm the first to admit that I don't have an
MBA, and the extent of my experience
working with entrepreneurs and business
models has been exactly three months. But I
will say that I understand people, and I un
derstand passion, and Cesar Marco had
more belief and conviction in his idea than a
great many people have in themselves.
I went home that night with Marco's bur
den on my shoulders. What he had finally
made clear to me was that there are individ
uals all over the world with great ideas. Some
of them may be as innovative as away to help
the deaf understand music whereas others
may be as simple as a new way to take out the
garbage. In any case, whether we like it or
not, without a connection to resources or ad
equate means of communication, these great
ideas never make it past the theoretical stage.
But I have those resources. I study at one
of the greatest research institutions in the
world, in the middle of one of the most inno
vative environments in the United States,
and I'm fluent enough in English that some
fool on The Daily's editorial staff lets me
publish 800 words every week. But instead
of creating great ideas, I'm too focused on
the immediate terror of finding a PoliSci ad
viser.
They say studying abroad changes you,
shapes you and makes you never want to
come back. I disagree. I learned more than
anything from my time abroad that I am an
American, through and through, and that my
jokes in Spanish, although still pretty terri
ble, will never be as terrible as my jokes in
English [Editor's Note: True]. But what I
have gained is an appreciation and a new
found sense of social responsibility. Cesar
Marco's conviction in his idea and to Spain's
20-percent unemployment rate demonstrat
ed the need for my maximum contributions
to both society and the marketplace. Above
all, however, I gained a responsibility to be
passionate.
And that is a responsibility I have only to
myself.
