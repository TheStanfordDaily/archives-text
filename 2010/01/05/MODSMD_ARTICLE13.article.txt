# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Ten Predictions for the Awkward Teens 
### Danny Crichton 
Introspection is an important trait, but
how can one write an obituary for the past
decade? The typical lament that comes
with eulogizing the end of something dear
tends to be positive, but really, the first 10
years of the new millennia was a real loser in
the span of American history.
So, instead of looking backward at the
hellish morass we just discarded, I am seizing
the opportunity to play Miss Cleo and identi
fy the top 10 news stories of the coming
decade. Events abound a couple more
presidential elections, another season of
American Idol, the end of the world perhaps.
The true stories of change in the coming
decade are going to be subtler, but far more
important.
In higher education, the tuition bubble of
the past two decades will crash, beginning a
second wave of realignments across universi
ties. In the process, the core mission of uni
versities will become more specialized as un
popular programs and tenure lines are cut.
Long term, a renaissance of higher education
is in order, focusing on more interdisciplinary
skills and higher standards.
Students entering universities will be bet
ter prepared than their predecessors due to
the new K-12 Core Standards currently close
to implementation. As teachers begin to
teach math and science skills again in Amer
ican public schools, the country will note a
general improvement in international test
scores and an influx of new STEM majors in
universities.

Those STEM majors will continue devel
oping automated systems that replace hu
mans in more and more industries. First it
was the cashiers at Wal-Mart, but soon it will
be your local lawyer. The bread-and-butter
cases of law are simple matters trusts, wills
and estates that will slowly be replaced
with intelligent computer programs that can

write legitimate and legal text. This
change, coupled with the opening of addi
tional law schools, will lead to a major glut in
lawyers that could make law school quite un
attractive for all but the best students.
In California politics, the state will reach
an untenable level of dysfunction, driving up
support for a new constitution. Whether the
constitution is replaced or significantly re
vised remains an open question, but it will be
a good bet that direct democracy provisions
will be curtailed.
Dysfunction will also come to a head at
the national level, where the U.S. Senate will
vote to end the filibuster, either replacing it
with one more sane and robust or eliminating
it completely. As legislation from both par
ties continues to be stopped by the minority
faction, the Senate will be left with little
choice but to change the current system or
risk a severe response at the ballot box.
The rancorous partisanship and extreme
positions of both parties leaves a gaping hole
in the moderate middle, and I believe a small
but influential third party will fill that hole.
That party will begin at the state level, but
will pick off just enough seats in the House to
be the balance of power. If history is any suit
able indication, it will not last long, but will be
a spark for change in its brief existence.
The major issues facing the legislature will
continue to be jobs and the economy for the
foreseeable future. Structural unemploy

ment incongruity between the skills of
job-seekers and the skills needed by employ
ers is the central issue. While it will take
most of the decade to transfer people from
dying to growth industries, America will
reach a strong level of economic competi
tiveness by 2020.
At the international level, the biggest
story of the next decade will be the climax to
the Taiwan question, which will finally be an
swered (what way is unclear). The forces
pulling Taiwan into the mainland's orbit and
the reactionary forces that will attempt to
stop it are gathering in strength.The battle of
the two sides will be surprisingly swift and
final.
Despite the prominence of Copenhagen,
climate change will not be the primary moti
vator of international discussion next
decade. Instead, tightening supplies of oil will
be the crisis of the moment. Whether peak oil
has happened or will shortly, supply will
never match the growth in demand from de
veloping countries. As the world responds to
this new energy situation, it will largely elim
inate the climate problems in the process.
Finally, despite that new California consti
tution, the legislature will finally eliminate
UC-Berkeley from its budget. Maybe it is my
inner Stanford talking, but I just cannot see
that other Bay Area institution making it
through another decade.
The 2010s may not be rosy, but it will be a
vast improvement over the one we have just
finished. A decade of renewal is also a decade
of dynamism, and the changes that are
wrought will strengthen the nation and the
world.

Will Danny Crichton one day be referenced
like that patent inspector from the 1800s who
said everything has been invented? Tell him at
