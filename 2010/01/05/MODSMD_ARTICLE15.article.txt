## NOTHIN' BUT LUCK Freshman QB is key for Card offense 
### JACK SALISBURY MANAGING EDITOR 
Toby Gerhart may have been the figurehead
of the 2009 Stanford football team, but the most
important piece to the Cardinal puzzle this season
just might have been filled by his backfield coun
terpart, redshirt freshman quarterback Andrew
Luck.
Just a quick look at the numbers suggests this.
Gerhart had a spectacular season in 2008, break
ing Stanford's single-season rushing record with
1,136 yards and 15 touchdowns. Yet the Cardinal
still went 5-7 and was never truly a force on the of
fensive side of the ball.
Gerhart's numbers jumped dramatically this
season, nearly doubling to an astronomical 1,871
yards and 27 touchdowns. But throughout all of it,
Gerhart was essentially the same player doing
what he's always done. Running back is a position
where success is largely based on size and speed,
not experience. Even further, it's a position where
success is predicated on what is going on with the
rest of the football team. If a team falls behind
consistently, it will be forced to play catch-up and
won't run the ball much. If the offensive line expe
riences trouble, then the running back probably
won't be making an appearance at the Downtown
Athletic Club in Manhattan come early Decem
ber. And so on and so forth.
The difference in Gerhart's numbers this sea
son is explained by the fact that his team was sim
ply better this season. It possessed the ball longer
(leading to more carry attempts) and was in posi
tion to score more often (leading to more touch
downs).
Luck's play at quarterback had a lot to do with
that and this was evidenced by his absence in the
Sun Bowl on New Year's Eve. Senior quarterback
Tavita Pritchard, who will be forever enshrined in
Stanford football lore after leading the Cardinal
to a 24-23 victory over No. 2 US C two years ago,
just couldn't match up against the Sooner de
fense. Although Gerhart tallied 135 yards and two
touchdowns, it was an uphill battle for him all
game, as the Sooners were able to put nine de

fenders in the box without having to pay for it.
"I thought our football team played as well as
it possibly could," said Coach Jim Harbaugh after
the game.
With Luck out of the lineup, Stanford's best
wasn't good enough.
In any case, the point of this article isn't to harp
on Pritchard for his performance or to downplay
the numbers of Gerhart, who easily had the best
season for a running back in Stanford football his
tory and probably should have won the Heis
man Trophy. The point is to highlight the signifi
cance of Luck, a player who will be the team's
starting quarterback for what should be at least
another two years.
Many Cardinal fans may be inclined to think
Coach Harbaugh's program has reached its apex,
with Gerhart likely forgoing a possible fifth year
of eligibility to take his shot at the NFL. But that
just isn't the case as long as Luck is at the helm.
Gerhart's numbers will be nearly impossible to
replace, but freshman running backs Stepfan Tay
lor and Tyler Gaffney will relish the opportunity
for more playing time in his absence and fill the
vacancy to the best of their abilities. Taylor has al
ready shown himself to be a shifty back with ade
quate power and speed.
That said, the Stanford program is in Luck's
hands, even though the humble quarterback
would deny such a designation without second
thought.
"There have been some really good quarter
backs at Stanford since John Elway," ESPN
broadcaster David Norrie told the San Jose Mer
cury News back in November. "But this is the first
Stanford quarterback since Elway where you go,
'Wow.'"
Harbaugh, known for his hyperbolic state
ments and his lofty ambitions, even called Luck
"the country's best quarterback." The rising red
shirt sophomore might not be that at this particu
lar moment in time, but he has a great chance to
put his naturally memorable name in the same
conversation as the likes of Elway and Plunkett.

After a stellar season, Stanford football had no such Luck against Oklahoma in the Sun Bowl. The Card offense struggled without its young quarterback, who was sidelined with a broken finger.
