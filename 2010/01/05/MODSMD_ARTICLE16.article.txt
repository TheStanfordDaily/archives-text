# Card basketball could be short on talent and long on fun
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
Being a Stanford sports fan just got
harder. A lot harder. Gone are the
days of being able to sit in the Red
Zone chanting "Toby, Toby!" over
and over while Cardinal football steamrolls
opponents. Gone are the days of watching All-
Americans Kelly O'Hara and Christen Press
lead Stanford women's soccer to an undefeat
ed regular season and a berth in the National
Championship.
Gone are the days of women's volleyball
winning its 16th conference title and making its
29th consecutive NCAA Tournament appear
ance. Gone are the days of men's soccer re
claiming national prominence. Gone are the
days of seeing men's water polo atop the na
tional rankings.
Now? Our 'welcome back to campus' gift
this quarter was a game in which Jerome Ran

dle and the rest of the California Golden Bears
crushed a woefully overmatched Stanford
squad, 92-66.
Yep, the good-ol' days are definitely gone.
To compensate for the drop-off of talent
and success, here are seven promotions, give
aways and gimmicks that would give the men's
basketball season the amusement it so desper
ately needs.
1. Bring a keg to the game. The first 50 stu
dents (21 and older, of course) in the game are
allowed to buy a $lO seat in the student section
for their kegs. This one will take care of three
problems. First, it encourages students to arrive
early. Second, it will all but force fans to stay to
the end of the game, no matter the score, be-

cause who wants to lug a half-full keg back out
of the arena? Third, it will raise some much
needed revenue for the Athletic Department.
2. Golf Cart Giveaway. All students who at
tend the game will automatically be entered
into a halftime raffle to win a golf cart, com

plete with an all-access parking pass. One
caveat: winning fan must hop into the cart and
ghost ride all around the court a la Marshawn
Lynch.
3. Borat Night. In honor of 6'10" sopho
more center Matei Daian, a native of Romania,
all students will receive a neon-green Borat
swimsuit and fake moustache. As frivolous and
ridiculous as the giveaway may sound, can you
think of a more surefire way for Stanford to get
on Sports Center? I didn't think so. (And yes,
I'm aware Borat is from Kazakhstan, but I
don't think Stuart Scott and Scott Van Pelt
would mind.)
4. Taunt the Tree at Halftime. The Leland
Stanford Jr. University Marching Band's mas
cot has gained notoriety for being cited for
public drunkenness at a game after blowing a

Yep,
the good-ol' days
are definitely
gone.
