# A 						Poor Showing for Pac-10
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
Bowl season a time to reach
elite status or salvage a sea
son. A time to knock off the
big boys or cement your
team's success. A time to prove how
competitive your conference is.
Someone forgot to tell the Pac-10.
After the regular season, many
people, including yours truly, thought
that the Pac-10 was the best and
certainly deepest conference in all
of college football. Seven of the 10
teams made bowl games. Five teams
finished the regular season in the BCS
Top 25, more than any other confer
ence.
The Pac-10's juggernaut USC had
not just been dethroned the Tro
jans were embarrassed, falling to fifth
in a conference they once dominated.
What some would call parity was
thought to be depth. Six Pac-10 teams
won eight or more games in the regu
lar season and five of the six were in
contention for a Rose Bowl berth in
the final weeks.
This, combined with the Pac-10's
success in previous bowl seasons (5-0
last year and 4-2 two years ago), made
fans excited about this year's bowl
games. Finally, a chance to show East
Coasters that the best football in the
nation is played out west. A chance to
prove the doubters from the SEC
wrong and to further legitimize the
protests that Toby Gerhart is the true
Fleisman Trophy winner.
Whoops.
You might have heard what hap
pened to Stanford. Losing 31-27
against perennial powerhouse Okla
homa when the Cardinal was missing
its starting quarterback, redshirt fresh
man Andrew Luck, is certainly noth
ing to hang your head about partic
ularly for a program coming off seven
consecutive losing seasons.
Of course, detractors like to point
out that Oklahoma was missing its
starting quarterback as well, former
Heisman Trophy winner Sam Brad
ford. Clearly this was an enormous
loss, especially combined with the loss
of All-American tight end Jermaine
Gresham, but the Sooners have been
playing nearly all year with backup
quarterback Landry Jones this was
not as big of adjustment as it was for
Stanford to miss Luck.
Stanford was an underdog by just
over a touchdown, thus it's no shock
that it fell short. Still though, the Car
dinal had an experienced backup Tavi
ta Pritchard filling in and Stanford led
at halftime, so there isn't much of a
sense of a moral victory. At least the
Cardinal did not disappoint as much
as the rest of the conference, though.
Of the six other Pac-10 teams, only
two won their bowl games, while three
lost by double digits. The games went
as follows: Oregon State looked out
matched against B YU 44-20 in a game
that was expected to be nearly a dead
heat; Cal was dominated by Utah, 37-
27, in a game Cal led 14-0; USC over
came a lackluster first half to outlast
offensively-challenged Boston Col
lege, 24-13; UCLA came back from a
halftime deficit to defeat Temple
(which hadn't been to a bowl game in
30 years), 30-21; Arizona got flat-out
embarrassed by Nebraska 33-0; and
Oregon laid an egg against Ohio State
26-17 in the Granddaddy of Them All.
What makes this 2-4 bowl record even
worse is that all six of these Pac-10
teams were favored to win their games
by the oddsmakers.
As a Pac-10 fan and a hater of East
Coast bias, this bowl season really
hurt. I knew the Mountain West teams
were very talented, so I thought BYU
and Utah had a chance against Ore
gon State and Cal, but I expected the
Beavers and Golden Bears to at least
put up respectable performances. The
wins by the L.A. schools were dull and
expected, but at least they won. I can
not believe how poorly Arizona
played against Nebraska I would
never have thought the Cornhuskers
could score 33 points, not to mention
hold Arizona scoreless.
Despite all these embarrassing per
formances, the toughest to handle for
me was Oregon losing in the Rose
Bowl. For once, all the experts predict
ed a win for the Pac-10 and Oregon
seemed to finally be getting its share of
hype. There seemed to be no way the
Buckeyes could stop the high-pow
ered Ducks offense, yet that's exactly
what they did.

Conferences are judged by their
best teams and the Pac-10's best
teams could not deliver. The top four
teams in the Pac-10 were outscored a
combined 134-64 in the most impor
tant games of their seasons, which is
frankly unacceptable.
I still believe the Pac-10 is one of
the toughest conferences in the na
tion, but it's hard to make a very com
pelling argument to support that now.
Instead, Pac-10 fans have to resort to
one of the most common cliches in
sports.
There's always next year.

Jacob Jaffe feels incredibly guilty about
rooting for USC. Give him some joy by
discussing the Trojans' latest NCAA in
fractions at jwjaffe@stanford.edu.
