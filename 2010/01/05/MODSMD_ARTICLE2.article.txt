## Solar power may empower new sight Researchers find energy source for retinal implants 
### VIVIANA ARCIA 
The sun isn't supposed to help
your vision, but for patients suffer
ing from blindness, solar power
may be the key to restored sight,
according to Stanford researchers.
Ophthalmology Prof. Daniel
Palanker, along with a team of
researchers, has created a new arti
ficial retinal implant that uses pho
tovoltaic power to provide power
to a chip implanted at the back of
the eye. The discovery is particu
larly significant because previous
implants had no way to send
power to the chip in order to
process light and data inside the
eye.
Development of these new reti
nal implants used electronic reti
nal prostheses in order to restore
sight to patients suffering from
degenerative retinal diseases such
as Retinitis Pigmentosa and Age-
Related Macular Degeneration.
While normal vision may be
out of reach for many patients, the
implants could nonetheless offer
dramatic vision improvements.
"We hope to be able to restore
visual acuity up to the level of
20/100 because while 20/20 is nor
mal vision, people with retinal
degeneration may lose sight to the
levels of 20/400 or below,"
Palanker said.
According to neurobiology
Prof. Stephen Baccus, a member of
the research team behind the
implant, the goal is to produce an
electronic device that allows peo
ple to naturally perceive visual

images, objects and motion.
Currently, the research team is
studying how the retina processes
visual information as away to
understand how neural circuits in
the brain function.
"A natural use of this research
is to construct an electronic device
to replace part of the function of
the retina in cases of retinal degen
eration," Baccus said.
Unlike similar methods, the
Stanford system uses "real-time
computer processing to transform
visual images in away that approx
imates the real neural code used
by the retina," Baccus added.
This particular research project
also mirrors the well-known
Stanford tradition of interdiscipli
nary collaboration.
"Due to [the] highly interdisci
plinary nature of this project, our
group includes specialists from
four departments at Stanford:
Ophthalmology, Hansen
Experimental Physics Lab,
Electrical Engineering and
Neurobiology," Palanker said.
Currently in the basic research
state, Palanker's team is using both
in vitro methods and in vivo
using small animals in order to
better understand the implants.
Further development, including
the change from lab animals to
humans, will depend on funding
and perfecting the current method
of research. The team aims to
design systems that transmit visu
als more naturally.
"By making the electronic stim
ulation as natural as possible, we
hope that learning process will be
easier," Baccus said.
