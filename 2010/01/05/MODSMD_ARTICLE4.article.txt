# A 						Fiscal Year in Review
## Report: 'Economic turmoil' struck hard, but slow progress has begun

What a difference a year makes.
Financial results from Stanford's fiscal year
2009 (FYO9) have made clear the extent of losses
incurred by the University over 12 months of "eco
nomic turmoil."
FYO9 lasted from Sept. 1,2008 to Aug. 31,2009.
During that time, Stanford's surplus from opera
tions actually increased $62 million as compared to
fiscal year 2008 (FY08), to $362 million. This posi
tive result, however, was achieved largely through
reaction to expected financial challenges and
investment losses losses that "overshadowed"
the operating results, according to the 2009
Financial Review, a summary presented to the
Board of Trustees in December.
Over FYO9, the University sustained losses
across a range of categories in comparison to
FYOB. In addition to the widely-reported endow
ment loss of 27 percent, or $4.6 billion, the
University's net assets also declined 21 percent, or
$4.7 billion. Investments as a whole declined $5.3
billion, or 24 percent.
To address many of its needs, particularly for
facilities and infrastructure projects, and to meet
liquidity standards, Stanford also had to dramati
cally increase its debt. Stanford's borrowings
increased by $984 million, raising its total borrow
ings to $2.5 billion as of Aug. 31,2009.
The University's operating revenues also
declined across a number of areas, necessitating an
increased draw upon resources from the
University endowment, in the form of a 34 percent
payout up from 31 percent in FYOB.
Student income, which represents 11 percent of
University operating revenues, is a particular area
for concern. Despite increases in tuition, overall
revenue from students dropped one percent in
FYO9 to a total of $4Ol million. Tuition rates
increased 3.5 percent for undergraduates and an
average 4.5 percent for graduate students.
The decrease in revenue from students was due
to increased financial need, which has increased

the demands placed upon the University's finan
cial aid commitments. Expenditures on financial
aid rose 19 percent to a total of $2lO million, and
the Financial Review states that the University
expects "families of University students will con
tinue to need increased financial assistance in the
years to come."
Sponsored research support, which makes up
fully 30 percent of University operating revenues,
also declined by four percent, or $45 million, to a
total of $1 billion. This decrease was due primarily
to a decrease in federal funding for facility con
struction at the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory.
Special program fees and other income, which
represent 10 percent of University operating rev
enues, also declined by a modest four percent, to
$341 million. The financial report cited reduced
participation in "travel study programs, profession
al education programs, other special programs and
conferences" likely a symptom of tighter budg
ets among those who pay for these offerings.

Gifts and pledges to the University decreased
by $384 million, a significant drop-off from FYOB
levels. Still, the University received more than
104,000 individual gifts for a total reported amount
of $542 million. The Financial Review states that
the University anticipates "that gifts will not return
to the strong levels of the past few years in the near
term, as donors also feel the strain of declining
investment portfolios."
In more positive news, the Stanford Challenge
fundraising campaign has continued to achieve
gains for the University, surpassing its $4.3 billion
milestone. Over the course of FYO9, Stanford
established 11 new endowed professorships, 66
new funds for graduate fellowships and 30 new
undergraduate scholarship funds, among other
gains. The Financial Review states, however, that
"many priority areas included in the original goal
have not yet been funded, and new needs have
been identified since the campaign began."

Health care service and hospital
revenues were a bright spot for operat
ing revenue, increasing by $57 million
to a total of $429 million —l2 percent
of the University's operating rev
enues. These results were due to the
addition of MediCal Disproportion
ate Share Hospital (DSH) revenue,fa
vorable contract rate increases, in
creased outpatient activity and other
factors in FYO9. From a long-term
standpoint, the Hospitals are facing a
significant need for expansion, with
the Financial Review stating that "the
Hospitals continue to be constrained
by inpatient capacity, along with esca
lating costs. Construction of new facil
ities to meet community health care
needs continues to be a priority. These
new facilities are projected to cost
more than $3 billion, representing the
largest capital projects ever undertak
en by the Hospitals."
On the expenditures side, Stan
ford also faced significant challenges.
Staff layoffs, which exceeded 400 per
sons, had associated costs that re
duced their positive impact on FYO9
finances. The Financial Review states
that "most of the staff reductions oc
curred during the second half of
FYO9, and the University incurred
one-time severance expenses for ter
minated employees. In addition,
health care costs and expenses asso

ciated with retirement plans drove
FYO9 benefit costs higher."
The cancellation or suspension of
construction projects drove a four per
cent decrease in depreciation expens
es. University budget cuts allowed for
a decrease in other operating expens
es by 14 percent, to $920 million. Final
ly, lower interest rates decreased inter
est expenses by $2O million.
The results, related in a summary
presented to the Board of Trustees,
state that a return to full financial

health for the University will be a
long process, and that "it will take
years of economic gains and contin
ued vigilance of expenditure levels to
restore the University and Hospital
investment balances to the 2008 lev
els." More detailed results for fiscal
year 2009 are scheduled for distribu
tion this month through the Universi
ty's annual report.

University's net assets also declined 21 percent, or
$4.7 billion. Investments as a whole declined $5.3
billion, or 24 percent.
To address many of its needs, particularly for
facilities and infrastructure projects, and to meet
liquidity standards, Stanford also had to dramati
cally increase its debt. Stanford's borrowings
increased by $984 million, raising its total borrow
ings to $2.5 billion as of Aug. 31,2009.
The University's operating revenues also
declined across a number of areas, necessitating an
increased draw upon resources from the
University endowment, in the form of a 34 percent
payout up from 31 percent in FYOB.
Student income, which represents 11 percent of
University operating revenues, is a particular area
for concern. Despite increases in tuition, overall
revenue from students dropped one percent in
FYO9 to a total of $4Ol million. Tuition rates
increased 3.5 percent for undergraduates and an
average 4.5 percent for graduate students.
The decrease in revenue from students was due
to increased financial need, which has increased

the demands placed upon the University's finan
cial aid commitments. Expenditures on financial
aid rose 19 percent to a total of $2lO million, and
the Financial Review states that the University
expects "families of University students will con
tinue to need increased financial assistance in the
years to come."
Sponsored research support, which makes up
fully 30 percent of University operating revenues,
also declined by four percent, or $45 million, to a
total of $1 billion. This decrease was due primarily
to a decrease in federal funding for facility con
struction at the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory.
Special program fees and other income, which
represent 10 percent of University operating rev
enues, also declined by a modest four percent, to
$341 million. The financial report cited reduced
participation in "travel study programs, profession
al education programs, other special programs and
conferences" likely a symptom of tighter budg
ets among those who pay for these offerings.

Gifts and pledges to the University decreased
by $384 million, a significant drop-off from FYOB
levels. Still, the University received more than
104,000 individual gifts for a total reported amount
of $542 million. The Financial Review states that
the University anticipates "that gifts will not return
to the strong levels of the past few years in the near
term, as donors also feel the strain of declining
investment portfolios."
In more positive news, the Stanford Challenge
fundraising campaign has continued to achieve
gains for the University, surpassing its $4.3 billion
milestone. Over the course of FYO9, Stanford
established 11 new endowed professorships, 66
new funds for graduate fellowships and 30 new
undergraduate scholarship funds, among other
gains. The Financial Review states, however, that
"many priority areas included in the original goal
have not yet been funded, and new needs have
been identified since the campaign began."

Health care service and hospital
revenues were a bright spot for operat
ing revenue, increasing by $57 million
to a total of $429 million —l2 percent
of the University's operating rev
enues. These results were due to the
addition of MediCal Disproportion
ate Share Hospital (DSH) revenue,fa
vorable contract rate increases, in
creased outpatient activity and other
factors in FYO9. From a long-term
standpoint, the Hospitals are facing a
significant need for expansion, with
the Financial Review stating that "the
Hospitals continue to be constrained
by inpatient capacity, along with esca
lating costs. Construction of new facil
ities to meet community health care
needs continues to be a priority. These
new facilities are projected to cost
more than $3 billion, representing the
largest capital projects ever undertak
en by the Hospitals."
On the expenditures side, Stan
ford also faced significant challenges.
Staff layoffs, which exceeded 400 per
sons, had associated costs that re
duced their positive impact on FYO9
finances. The Financial Review states
that "most of the staff reductions oc
curred during the second half of
FYO9, and the University incurred
one-time severance expenses for ter
minated employees. In addition,
health care costs and expenses asso

ciated with retirement plans drove
FYO9 benefit costs higher."
The cancellation or suspension of
construction projects drove a four per
cent decrease in depreciation expens
es. University budget cuts allowed for
a decrease in other operating expens
es by 14 percent, to $920 million. Final
ly, lower interest rates decreased inter
est expenses by $2O million.
The results, related in a summary
presented to the Board of Trustees,
state that a return to full financial

health for the University will be a
long process, and that "it will take
years of economic gains and contin
ued vigilance of expenditure levels to
restore the University and Hospital
investment balances to the 2008 lev
els." More detailed results for fiscal
year 2009 are scheduled for distribu
tion this month through the Universi
ty's annual report.
