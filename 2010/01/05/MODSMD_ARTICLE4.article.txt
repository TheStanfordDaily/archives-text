						Fiscal Year in Review
## Report: 'Economic turmoil' struck hard, but slow progress has begun

What a difference a year makes.
Financial results from Stanford's fiscal year
2009 (FYO9) have made clear the extent of losses
incurred by the University over 12 months of "eco
nomic turmoil."
FYO9 lasted from Sept. 1,2008 to Aug. 31,2009.
During that time, Stanford's surplus from opera
tions actually increased $62 million as compared to
fiscal year 2008 (FY08), to $362 million. This posi
tive result, however, was achieved largely through
reaction to expected financial challenges and
investment losses losses that "overshadowed"
the operating results, according to the 2009
Financial Review, a summary presented to the
Board of Trustees in December.
Over FYO9, the University sustained losses
across a range of categories in comparison to
FYOB. In addition to the widely-reported endow
ment loss of 27 percent, or $4.6 billion, the
University's net assets also declined 21 percent, or
$4.7 billion. Investments as a whole declined $5.3
billion, or 24 percent.
To address many of its needs, particularly for
facilities and infrastructure projects, and to meet
liquidity standards, Stanford also had to dramati
cally increase its debt. Stanford's borrowings
increased by $984 million, raising its total borrow
ings to $2.5 billion as of Aug. 31,2009.
The University's operating revenues also
declined across a number of areas, necessitating an
increased draw upon resources from the
University endowment, in the form of a 34 percent
payout up from 31 percent in FYOB.
Student income, which represents 11 percent of
University operating revenues, is a particular area
for concern. Despite increases in tuition, overall
revenue from students dropped one percent in
FYO9 to a total of $4Ol million. Tuition rates
increased 3.5 percent for undergraduates and an
average 4.5 percent for graduate students.
The decrease in revenue from students was due
to increased financial need, which has increased

the demands placed upon the University's finan
cial aid commitments. Expenditures on financial
aid rose 19 percent to a total of $2lO million, and
the Financial Review states that the University
expects "families of University students will con
tinue to need increased financial assistance in the
years to come."
Sponsored research support, which makes up
fully 30 percent of University operating revenues,
also declined by four percent, or $45 million, to a
total of $1 billion. This decrease was due primarily
to a decrease in federal funding for facility con
struction at the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory.
Special program fees and other income, which
represent 10 percent of University operating rev
enues, also declined by a modest four percent, to
$341 million. The financial report cited reduced
participation in "travel study programs, profession
al education programs, other special programs and
conferences" likely a symptom of tighter budg
ets among those who pay for these offerings.

Gifts and pledges to the University decreased
by $384 million, a significant drop-off from FYOB
levels. Still, the University received more than
104,000 individual gifts for a total reported amount
of $542 million. The Financial Review states that
the University anticipates "that gifts will not return
to the strong levels of the past few years in the near
term, as donors also feel the strain of declining
investment portfolios."
In more positive news, the Stanford Challenge
fundraising campaign has continued to achieve
gains for the University, surpassing its $4.3 billion
milestone. Over the course of FYO9, Stanford
established 11 new endowed professorships, 66
new funds for graduate fellowships and 30 new
undergraduate scholarship funds, among other
gains. The Financial Review states, however, that
"many priority areas included in the original goal
have not yet been funded, and new needs have
been identified since the campaign began."
