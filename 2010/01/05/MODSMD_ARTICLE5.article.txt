# All-Around CHANGES
## Gerhart not the only one questionable for return 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
With its year now completed, Stanford football begins the
process of establishing its roster and coaching staff for
the coming season. The off-season prompts significant
turnover: Players will be lost to attrition, graduation
and the NFL Draft: recruits will hit The Farm in the summer; and
coaches will move on to other pastures and will be replaced in kind.
The question of the off season, until he says anything declarative,
will focus on senior running back Toby Gerhart's draft intentions.
But actually, it is at the coaching level where most of the immediate
changes have been made.
Stanford may be less than a week removed from the Sun Bowl,
but it has already seen movement in the ranks. Special teams and
defensive ends coach DJ Durkin, one of the country's top young
assistant coaches, has left the Cardinal for Florida, where he will
coach special teams and linebackers. Durkin was a graduate assis
tant at Bowling Green under current Florida head coach Urban
Meyer.
He will be replaced, at least on special teams, by Brian Polian,
who previously coached in the same position at Notre Dame he
was not retained by new Fighting Irish head man Brian Kelly, but he
is regarded as a fairly good coach and an excellent recruiter.
Polian also has experience working with linebackers and may be
able to work with the Cardinal there, as the current position coach,
Andy Buh, is widely believed to be headed to Western Kentucky to
serve as the Hilltoppers' defensive coordinator. However, WKU

emphasized, "nothing has been accepted at
this point." Western Kentucky's new head
coach is Willie Taggart, who served as Stan
ford's running backs coach for three years
and was named to his current job in Novem
ber.
The changes don't stop there. Defensive
backs coach Clayton White is also expected
to leave Stanford for Western Kentucky,
along with Buh and Taggart, to coach the
Hilltoppers' defensive backs. The Athletics
Department would not confirm or deny the
move. The Cardinal was able to hold onto
offensive coordinator David Shaw, who was
a finalist for the San Jose State head-coach
ing gig (the job eventually went to Duke de
fensive coordinator Mike Maclntyre).
Coach Jim Harbaugh, always at the cen
ter of speculation himself, now has a number
of vacancies to fill. His father, Jack, was the
running backs coach during the Sun Bowl,
and Harbaugh has expressed interest in
keeping him on staff, if he is willing.
But it's not just the coaches who will ex
perience change; the players will, too. Stan
ford has a number of key contributors who
have now exhausted their eligibility. Chris
Marinelli anchored the Cardinal's superb
offensive line from his right tackle spot,
where he earned first-team conference hon
ors. Jim Dray, perhaps the best blocking
tight end in the country and a red zone
threat, was a second-team All Pac-10 selec
tion. Long time defensive starters Bo Mc-
Nally, Ekom Udofia and Clint Snyder are
also done, as well as impact players like Will
Powers and Kris Evans and valuable re
serves such as Tom McAndrew and Josh
Catron. Tavita Pritchard, who manned the
Cardinal offense in 20 starts, is gone, as is
Allen Smith, the team's most senior mem
ber.

However, that's not all of the Stanford
seniors: Richard Sherman and Matt Kopa

have both applied for medical redshirts due
to injuries that sidelined them in 2008 and
2009, respectively. Jim Young, director of
media relations, said that there's "nothing
definitive yet, although [he's] optimistic on
both." Joining Sherman and Kopa as med
ical redshirts could be Brian Bulcke and
James McGillicuddy, both of whom have ex
pressed interest in playing another year;
Erik Lorig may have missed enough time in
2009 to qualify, but he is not expected to
apply.
And then, of course, there's Toby Ger
hart. Although denoted as a senior, he
would almost certainly gain an extra year of
eligibility if he wanted it he missed all but
a few minutes of 2007. The will-he-or-won't
he saga will not end until Gerhart makes a
final statement either way, but the possibili
ty that he will enter for the NFL Draft is con
sidered very strong. He has requested an
evaluation from the NFL, which will tell him
a projected round he has indicated that if
he is graded out at a first round level, he will
leave, but has not said that he would neces
sarily return if he's seen as less than that. He
has made no secret of his desire to play in
the NFL, and though Gerhart could not be
reached for comment, numerous quotes on
the subject indicate a strong preference to
ward the professional ranks.
Further attrition is also expected â€”in
past years, early retirements for medical
purposes or otherwise, along with transfers,
have led to a handful of players leaving the
team.
Whatever the reasons, turnover is a per
petual part of football, particularly at the
collegiate level. What it means, though, is
that the off-season's hunt for replacements
leads to hardly any break at all.
