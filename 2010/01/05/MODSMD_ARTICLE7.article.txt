## Arranged, but not Loveless 
### PERI UNVER 
Western notions of love and mar
riage are filled with acts of passion
and fuzzy feelings. Yet, the divorce
rate in the U.S. averages 60%,
according to www.divorcerate.org.
Instead, arranged marriages continue to be
practical solutions in various cultural traditions.
Some critics say that there is a disconnect between
arranged matches and current concepts of love.
Others cite lower divorce rates, but even this statis
tic is disputed.
The prevalence of students in or heading
toward arranged marriages on the Stanford cam
pus proved nonexistent but that doesn't stop
students from having opinions.
Many students at Stanford find arranged mar
riage to be an outdated concept.
"I do not believe arranged marriage is necessar

ily bad," said Nishant Jacob 'l3. "However, it was
more effective before, like in the time of my par
ents. Now it seems a bit redundant, what with all
the ways to socially network. It also seems a little
restrictive."
Some, however, were entirely against arranged
marriage, expressing that it limited personal free
dom.
"I think arranged marriage is one of the most
oppressive institutions," said Dakin Sloss 'l2. "One
of the most significant choices we make is choos
ing who we want to be with. No one should force it
on you."
Quite a few students said that their grandpar
ents, and even some parents, had arranged mar
riages that ended up quite well. This used to be
considered fairly common across many cultural
lines.
Nupur Kantamneni 'l3 pointed out that
arranged marriages have evolved over the years
and do not deserve the archaic, oppressive reputa

tion that they are so often given.
"Arranged marriages today are not the same
as they used to be," she explained. "Now it is
more like parents know other parents, etc. It is
not so different from introducing friends to each
other."
Irteza Binte-Farid 'l3 explained that her par
ents met via this loose definition.
"My parents had an arranged marriage," she
said. "They were both in medical school in
Bangladesh and my father liked my mother. They
did not know each other too well, but their fami
lies arranged for them to go to a movie together.
"They have been married for twenty three
years and they may have their ups and downs,
but they're happy," Binte-Farid continued. "I'm
not saying that arranged marriage is for every
one, but it is not the evil that people make it out
to be."

In the long run, how different are relation
ships now from arranged marriages? Really, the

difference may just be in the "courting" period.
And perhaps that courting period is where the
height of romance is seen.
Maria Del Carmen Barrios 'l3 explained her
grandparents' fairytale love story.
"My grandparents were not arranged but they
went through the courting period . .. They liked
each other right away but my grandfather did not
speak Spanish and my grandmother did not
speak Italian," she said. "They learned English
for each other and my family still has the tapes
that they used. They kept in contact through a
series of letters and then got married after only
seeing each other a few times."
Our ideas of love may have changed over the
years, but the effort that goes into making love
work has not. It is not an easy road and it is never
perfect. And this uncertainty might be what
makes it so bewildering and enchanting.

The bride and groom in this modern Indian wedding exchange rings halfway through the ceremony. Although the couple met on their own, their marriage is considered arranged because their
parents organized the wedding.
