## Univ. joins complaint against Comcast's sports network 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
San Jose's hockey team isn't the
only shark in the Bay Area, according
to a complaint filed against Comcast
Cable by Stanford University, the city
of San Bruno and two local cable
providers.
The Dec. 23 Federal
Communications complaint filed
jointly by Horizon Cable TV,
Wave Division Holdings, the city of
San Bruno and Stanford University
alleges that Comcast, the nation's
largest cable operator, unfairly com
bined its Sacramento and Bay Area
regional sports networks, forcing
cable competitors wanting to broad
cast Comcast's programming to pur
chase both CSN Bay Area and CSN
California (Sacramento).
Comcast reassigned its game cov
erage of MLB Baseball's Oakland A's
and the NHL's San Jose Sharks from
its San Francisco network (CSN Bay
Area) to its Sacramento network
(CSN California), raising the price of
both networks, even though CSN Bay
Area lost coverage of its headlining
teams. Competing cable companies
that wanted to run coverage of those
teams had to pay more for two
Regional Sports Networks (RSNs)
and non-Comcast subscribers were
landed with increased rates.
What's more, the complaint says,
Comcast raised prices for its own
combined sports network package
without increasing "major league
sports programming."

Comcast maintains that it reas
signed its game programming to
reduce scheduling conflicts and
increase local sports coverage. For
instance, according to CED
Magazine, CSN Bay Area used to
run games of both the A's and San
Francisco Giants, whose extra-long
major league seasons would conflict
with The Sharks' and NBA Golden
State Warriors' games. Comcast says
offering games on the Sacramento
network eliminates any overlaps.
The allegations come at a bad
time for Comcast, which is in the
process of buying NBC Universal.
The petitioners, backed by the
American Cable Association, which
represents small and medium-sized
cable operators like Florizon and
Wave Division, slapped Comcast
with the FCC complaint now to
ensure that Comcast does not dis
criminate prices with NBC content.
"The complaint highlights the
need for additional safeguards and
remedies to prevent Comcast Corp.
from abusing its market power to
harm consumers, competitors, and
the public interest in the distribution
of 'must have' regional sports net
works under its control," said
American Cable Association
President Matt Polka in a statement.
"Regulators must be certain that if
Comcast takes control of NBC
Universal, it can't engage in unfair
methods of competition and decep
tive practices when competitors seek
access to NBC broadcast signals,
Comcast-NBCU national cable net
works, and various Internet-content
services, such as live streaming of the
Olympics."
Stanford University, the city of San
Bruno and Wave Division and
Horizon are asking for the FCC to
sanction Comcast, restore the previ
ous major league content arrange
ments and award damages to the peti
tioners.
