## Gettin' Swole 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN MANAGING EDITOR 
It's 4:23 p.m. on a dull Thursday afternoon and
I'm staring at an untouched problem set due
in less than 24 hours. Meandering into the
common room, I contemplate turning on
ESPN, the typical immediate remedy to my
procrastination, but today I can't afford to waste
away on the couch.
There's only one solution: it's time to get my
swell on.
The bike ride to the Tresidder Fitness Center
elapses like the minutes before midnight on New
Year's Eve, and unachievable workout goals are
made like ludicrous New Year's Resolutions.
As I make my grand entrance into the workout
facility, I swipe my card, give a little "what up" head
nod to the cute girl at the front desk and put down
my red bookstore bag in a Kindergarten-like
cubby. Gathering my iPod and water bottle, I go
through a quick, preliminary scouting of the gym.
The small cardio section is halfway full, occu
pied by two Kappas on the elliptical machines, a 60-
something-year-old professor on a treadmill and

two freshmen in "Stanford Beirut" shirts talking
about the upcoming weekend's ragers while biking
next to each other.
"It's gonna be fucking sick!" one says to the
other.
He's the man.
As I walk over to the stationary bicycles on the
opposite side of the gym, I recall one of my afore
mentioned lofty goals: a solid cardio workout for
30 minutes.
Did I say 30? Let's aim for 10.
After giving a half-assed effort on the bike while
listening to Kid Cudi, I decide that it's go time and
head over to the free weight section.
Two fairly thin Asian pals are spotting each
other on the bench, both attempting what appears
to be an impossible rep of 150 pounds.
"Come on man, you got this," the taller of the
two says to his friend. As he helps his friend unrack
the bar, I watch in disbelief as the lifter's face turns
a shade of red that belittles the "Asian glow." He
struggles with the bar on his chest and, with obvi
ous assistance from his spotter, re-racks the weights
with a tremendous exhale.
"Damn, I was so close!"

No. No, you weren't.
I regain focus after unknowingly staring at these
two for about five minutes and decide to get
involved in a little dumbbell press action. 1 pick up
45-pound weights for a warm-up set, when, out of
nowhere, one of the giant regulars comes and starts
curling the 50s.
So, that's how it's going to be?
With a quick and awkward exchange of subtle
snarls in the mirror, the game of dumbbell chicken
is on. I do a quick set and go for the 555. He imme
diately grabs the 60s.
Come on, bro; throw me a goddamn bone.
I can still lift the 555, but I know that I am head
ed for trouble. Grabbing for the 655, 1 see that he
goes for the 70s. I struggle through a small set and
pick up the 755, praying for surrender. He glances
at the weight in my hands, gives a bull-like huff and
walks with a little swag over to the rowing machine.
Can I comfortably chest press 150 pounds? You
bet your sweet ass I can't. Did 1 win? Absolutely.
As I move onto a new exercise, I spot two more
frequenters. As I discreetly turn down the volume
of my music, 1 hear them discuss, what else? Lifting
weights.

"I maxed 300 the other day," one says. "I'm
pumped."
This means one of two things: He's either really
excited to have accomplished a significant workout
milestone, or he's geeked up after snorting a line of
creatine. My money is on the second, as the veins in
his right forearm are bigger than my biceps.
As I chuckle to myself about the douchiness of
many of the gym rats, I get caught in a swarm of
hypocrisy. After a set of triceps pushdowns, I catch
myself flexing to the beat of Alice Deejay's techno
anthem, "Better Off Alone."
Shit, I am such a tool.
After pumping a little more iron and undergo
ing several more moments of awkward mirror eye
contact, I decide that my work here is done, I gath
er my things and give yet another head nod if
only my game with the ladies were as strong as my
dumbbell chicken skills.
As I'm exiting the gym, I overhear a conversa
tion between the Asian pair.
"I just wanna get big."
Don't we all?
