# THE 						GOOD DEATH
## PART 1 IN A SERIES OF 2 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
On a Sunday afternoon, Heida Earnest
sank into her living room couch at
her home in Mountain View, Calif.,
counting down the days when she
would see her father again.
She remembered the last time she saw him, in
April at Gulfside Regional Hospice in Florida,
fixed to his hospital bed with his muscles eaten
away. At 79 years old, he could barely speak, but
he was still awake and alert.
It was late June now, and in two days, she
would be back at his bedside. She and her hus
band, lan, had already booked their plane tickets,
and she had scheduled a few days off from work.
But Heida and her husband never boarded
their Tuesday flight.
The shrill ring of the telephone pierced the
afternoon silence, Heida picked up, and a nurse
from her father's hospice quickly identified herself.
"It's your dad," said the nurse. "He wants to
talk to you."
Heida was immediately concerned, wondering
why this nurse was talking for her dad, especially
after holding a seemingly normal conversation
with him the day before.
"Hello, Dad?" she said.
No response.
"Dad, hang on," Heida said. "Lan and I will be
there on Tuesday."
Again, nothing.


RYAN MAC/The Stanford Daily
Mountain View resident Heida Earnest and decedent care chaplain Reverend Susan Scott volunteer their time for Stanford
Hospital's No One Dies Alone program.
"Everything's going to be 0.K.,"
she finished. "I love you."
The rustling and crackling of the
phone on the other side interrupted
the conversation.
"Your father just passed," the
nurse said and hung up, leaving Heida
to the monotonous dial tone.
She sat on her couch perplexed
and, after waiting 10 minutes, called
back.
"This is James Hall's daughter,"
Heida said calmly. "Did he just die?"
"Yes, he did, and he heard your
voice," the nurse responded. "Your
voice was the last thing he heard."

A year and a half later, sitting in
the basement offices of Stanford
Hospital's Spiritual Care Services,
Heida Earnest still finds that call hard
to accept. She is a soft-spoken woman
with large, bright eyes. As she speaks,
her voice barely rises above a whis
per, and she pauses occasionally to
collect herself.
"It's a funny kind of a thing,
because in your mind you know it's
coming," she said. "You know it's
coming, but when it happens, it's
always disbelief. It's very strange."
After she hung up the phone, it
took a few hours for the pain to hit.
Then it came in waves an "unbe
lievably profound sadness." Still, she
is thankful she was able to talk to her
father in his last moments and that he
was not alone, but surrounded by
nurses and doctors.
At Stanford Hospital, 600 to 700
people die every year. Of those, about
five percent die alone some 40
people left to face death in their hos
pital beds by themselves.
Sometimes, they are the sick and
elderly who no longer have families.
Other times, they are like Heida's
father patients whose families are
in some other part of the country and
can't make it to their loved ones in
time. Whatever the reason, the
patients are left in the care of the hos
pital, where the hustle and bustle of
staff duties can prevent someone
from being at their bedside at all
times.

So, when Heida uncovered a
binder with a new program in the
Spiritual Care offices last February,
she was immediately intrigued. "No
One Dies Alone," she read, flipping
through the hodgepodge of papers on

"the dying process" and "providing a
caring presence."
She asked the Reverend Susan
Scott, the decedent care chaplain,
what it was all about. No One Dies
Alone would be a volunteer program
launched by Spiritual Care Services
in April, she was told, to provide com
pany for patients who didn't want to
face the end of their lives alone.
Heida joined immediately.

In the same binder that Heida
found on Reverend Scott's desk was
"The Dying Person's Bill of Rights."
Created by a Michigan nurse more
than 30 years ago, it outlines 16 rights
that an individual should be afforded
while dying. Right #7, printed in bold,
is the foundation of Stanford's new
volunteer program: "I have the right
not to die alone."
This idea sat in the back of Sandra
Clarke's mind for 16 years, after she
left the side of a dying man as a nurse
at Sacred Heart Hospital in Eugene,
Ore. The man had asked her to sit
with him in the Intensive Care Unit in
his last moments, and she promised
him that she would, just as soon as she
finished checking on other patients.
He died before she returned an hour
and a half later.
Now retired, Sandra remembers
the burden she carried after that night
in 1986.
"He asked for dignity and respect...
and the simple fact that a nurse on
duty could not be there for him I
thought this was just wrong," she said.
"If he had needed machines or med
ication, that would have happened."
She vowed to ensure that this same
situation would never happen again,
and in 2001, she launched the first No
One Dies Alone program with Sacred
Heart. From the start, Sandra never
intended the program to provide
medical attention to its patients.
Instead, she focused on the basic
human needs of individual patients,
with care as simple as waiting at the
bedside or providing a hand to hold.
After establishing the first No One
Dies Alone organization, Sandra
developed an extensive manual,
teaching other hospital staffs how to
start programs of their own. She did
not copyright the material and name
in order to allow for open dissemina
tion, and she has shipped more than
1,500 copies around the world

from Alaska to France to Singapore,
Seven years later, a copy found its
way into the hands of Susan Scott.
After receiving approval and struc
turing a program around Clarke's
manual, Scott began Stanford
Hospital's No One Dies Alone pro
gram in April.

No One Dies Alone volunteers
are strictly on call they sign up for
two-hour shifts in which they are
available during the week and are
only called if the program receives a
patient. Heida signed up for any open
3 p.m. shift on weekdays, so that if she
were called, she could make her way
to the hospital quickly from her job at
Stanford's medical library. She didn't
expect that she would be phoned
within weeks of signing up.
On a late April afternoon, she
entered a first-floor hospital room to
find a woman, eyes shut, propped up
in a hospital bed. Light flowed in
through an open window, basking her
in a warm light as she lay peacefully.
A woman singing and playing a Celtic
harp accompanied the patient.
Heida placed down her things,
including a program-provided bag
filled with poetry books and a music
player, and glanced at the patient
with whom she would be spending
the next two hours. Remembering her
training, Heida introduced herself
even though the patient kept her eyes
closed she never opened them in
those two hours.
Penny Barrett, a long-time volun
teer with Spiritual Care Services, had
sat with the patient some eight hours
before Heida on the inaugural shift of
the program, and had given the
woman a nickname.
"There was nothing scary about it,
the patient had a great sense of peace
and innocence and there was a child
like characteristic for a person in her
905," Barrett said. "Her hair was short
and... I thought of Peter Pan."
Gathering herself, Heida read
through Peter Pan Lady's files, recit
ing her name and diagnosis. There
was nobody in the area to look after
her because her family lived on the
East Coast.
Heida sat in a bedside chair next to
the woman and clasped the woman's
hand in her own. As doctors moved in
an out of the room, and the Celtic
harp player left for other duties, Heida

remained the one constant.

Since Peter Pan Lady, Heida has
sat with three other patients, each with
a unique nickname and experience.
There was Mr. Verbal, a man transi
tioning to hospice care, who couldn't
stop talking a rarity given that most
of the patients in the program no
longer have the capacity to speak.
An atheist, Mr. Verbal questioned
Heida, a devout Catholic, about her
religion. He wanted to know where
she had traveled and what she did for
a living. But their conversations were
broken by bouts of sleep that over
came the patient.
"I don't know why I keep falling
asleep the way I do," he said before
nodding off.
Then there was Thirsty Woman,
hospitalized in Stanford's ICU. Heida
spent two hours with her on a
Saturday night holding a pink sponge
that she used to soak in water and dab
the mouth of the patient. Thirsty
Woman could barely speak.
"For the whole time, I just gave
her water," Heida said. "She just
drank and drank and drank."
Her most recent patient was Big
Man, an unresponsive man suffering
from heart disease. She spent most of
that time working with a new volun
teer who had just joined the program.
It's been a month since Heida sat
with her last patient, and she doesn't
often think about any of the patients
she's been with. The volunteers are
not expected to dwell on the subject
of their previous patient's conditions
and are not usually notified if a
patient they had been with has died
on a later shift. Despite the intimate
nature of the program, volunteers are
expected to maintain a certain emo
tional distance from their patients,
especially after leaving the room.
But by sitting with fellow human
beings in their last moments of life, how
could one not develop a personal con
nection to the dying? Isn't there at least
a sense of wanting to know? Heida only
heard of Thirsty Woman's death through
Reverend Scott. When asked if she
knew whether Mr. Verbal or Big Man
had died, she whispered, "I don't know."

Part two will run in tomorrow's
issue of The Daily.
