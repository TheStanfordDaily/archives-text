# THE
						GOOD DEATH
## PART 1 IN A SERIES OF 2 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
On a Sunday afternoon, Heida Earnest
sank into her living room couch at
her home in Mountain View, Calif.,
counting down the days when she
would see her father again.
She remembered the last time she saw him, in
April at Gulfside Regional Hospice in Florida,
fixed to his hospital bed with his muscles eaten
away. At 79 years old, he could barely speak, but
he was still awake and alert.
It was late June now, and in two days, she
would be back at his bedside. She and her hus
band, lan, had already booked their plane tickets,
and she had scheduled a few days off from work.
But Heida and her husband never boarded
their Tuesday flight.
The shrill ring of the telephone pierced the
afternoon silence, Heida picked up, and a nurse
from her father's hospice quickly identified herself.
"It's your dad," said the nurse. "He wants to
talk to you."
Heida was immediately concerned, wondering
why this nurse was talking for her dad, especially
after holding a seemingly normal conversation
with him the day before.
"Hello, Dad?" she said.
No response.
"Dad, hang on," Heida said. "Lan and I will be
there on Tuesday."
Again, nothing.
