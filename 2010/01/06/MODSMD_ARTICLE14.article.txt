## Iran lists Stanford as "subversive" 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford University has been list
ed as a "subversive" international
organization by the government in
Iran, according to news reports.
Iran's Intelligence Ministry issued
a list of 60 international organizations
that it accuses of inciting last sum
mer's protests in the post-election
season. Stanford joins Yale University
and think tanks such as the
Washington Institute for Near East
Policy and the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace that have also
been accused of being part of a "soft
war" waged against Iran.
Many of the people arrested in
the post-election crackdown were
accused of being involved in a "soft
coup" against the Iranian clerical
establishment. The latest additions
appear to indicate that Iran is trying
to isolate critics inside Iran by pre
venting them from having any con
tact with the outside world.
A number of other institutions
that try to promote democracy
abroad, including the Soros
Foundation, the National
Democratic Institute, the
International Republican Institute,
the Foundation for Democracy in
Iran and the Ford Foundation, were
also included on the list.
