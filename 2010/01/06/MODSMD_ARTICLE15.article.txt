## EDITORIAL Look past career goals when approaching college 
### 
The annual UCLA survey of over
400,000 incoming college freshmen
found a striking difference in their per
sonal goals coming into college. Less than 50
percent cited "developing a meaningful phi
losophy of life" as essential or very important
as an outcome of their college experience,
whereas wealth was cited by 78 percent. In
comparison to results from 1971, the change
over time underscores a growing concern
about careers in college over a college educa
tion unto itself. Four decades ago, 37 percent
responded that wealth was a driving goal
whereas 73 percent sought a meaningful life
philosophy.
In our current economic climate, it may
seem natural for students to put more stress
on how their major will translate into a lu
crative career. Such careerism, however,
cannot only have negative consequences for
individual students later on in life, but may
also come to define the American higher ed
ucation systems. Some schools, due to de
creasing or nonexistent enrollment, have
begun to cut majors such as philosophy and
classics. Some students may see these majors
as dead-ends rather than as launching points
to further education or employment. Yet, the
value of a liberal education cannot be for
gotten. Amid the declining value of the dol
lar, the value of a broad education still exists.
The danger here is that a humanities ed
ucation reaches beyond the short-term goal
of financial stability into a long-term life ed
ucation in thought and ethics. While Stan
ford students may feel mired in IHUM
reading and discussion sections, we must
also remember that we are among the peo
ple who will shape what our world will be.

As such, we must be able to make difficult
ethical choices and, hopefully, contribute
more to society than the twin materialist
goals of wealth and production.
Not only does an education in the hu
manities have great value on a personal
level, students often forget that employers
look for skills beyond the limits of specific
majors. The Association of American Col
leges and Universities recently found that
employers of recent college graduates value
the following skills most highly: communi
cation, critical thinking and creativity.
The Editorial Board believes that stu
dents everywhere should remember the
value of their college education not simply
in terms of the dollar. Increasing tuition
prices and the economy may be dark clouds
on the horizon, but a comprehensive educa
tion in the humanities may be the silver lin
ing. With many new sectors of our economy
coming to the forefront, we cannot always
predict what the job market will look like
upon graduation. In such an ever-changing,
globalized world, one cannot forget that
communication and critical thinking are
what break down cultural barriers and
launch new ideas into the conversation.
Colleges and universities should be sensi
tive to concerns about careers, but ensure
that a broad education in humanities is not
left in the past if students begin to move
away from it. Just as emerging fields build
upon prior research, the foundation of a uni
versity education should not be cast aside at
the desire for the all-mighty dollar. In fact,
building a college career on these corner
stones may be a better launching point into
the real job market.
