# GET IT RIGHT
## Merry Christmas! 
### Erica Morgan 
Well, if I didn't have a chance to offer
you a "Merry Christmas" in person,
I am hereby extending my very best
(belated) wishes to you for a very happy
Christmas. I offer my benevolence to each of
you, regardless of your religious beliefs, polit
ical platforms, philosophical tendencies, eth
nic origins, or gender.
I am always amazed come Christmas
time that this jolly phrase manages to of
fend certain factions of society. "I do not
celebrate Christmas," sniff the killjoys. "Not
only do I reject your Christmassy inclina
tions, I take umbrage at the fact that you did
not find out my holiday habits (or lack
thereof) and personalize your sentiments
accordingly."
Apparently the problems with a casual
"Merry Christmas" range from the presump
tion that Christianity is the predominate
American religion (... which it is, by the
way) to a sort of inherent insult to all other
religions/holidays by neglecting to mention
them.
When I experience this negative reaction
to my Christmas wishes, I am almost para
lyzed by the flurry of responses that occur to
me. I suppose I must start with the obvious
fact that Christmas, though a holiday of reli
gious origin, is hardly an exclusively religious
holiday. As a non-Christian celebrator of
Christmas, I assert that my enjoyment of
Christmas trees, boisterous holiday music,
stocking stuffers and fat men in red suits has
absolutely nothing to do with the birth of our
"savior," baby Jesus. However, even if I were
the most devout of Bible brandishers, I am
thankfully guaranteed the right to celebrate
my religion in any way I choose, provided it
causes no harm to others nor prevents others
from celebrating their own religions. I hon
estly cannot see how wishing you enjoyment
of the holiday I celebrate causes you any
harm or prevents you from getting on with
your own celebrations.
Furthermore, whether you like it or not,
Christmas is an American holiday. You do
not have to observe it, but it is recognized by
the American government, just as Memorial
Day and Thanksgiving are. These days are
not celebrated übiquitously or unanimously,
but they are official American holidays. In
other words, my acknowledgement that
Christmas is occurring and my wishing you a
merry one should not be taken as attack or
indoctrination.
"Merry Christmas" does not carry weight
ed implications that everyone must cele
brate. It does not mock other holidays, or
imply that Christmas is superior. It does not
prevent someone from replying with "Happy
Hanukkah." In fact, I am grateful when I am
wished happiness at any time of the year, re
gardless of the religious context. I find it

pleasant that someone is wishing me well.
Why does our society demand that I address
each individual with the holiday wish best
suited to that person's particular beliefs? Or
that, if I am unwilling to learn each individ
ual's particular beliefs, that I degrade my
phrase to a generic hallmark "Happy Holi
days?" And really, in that vein, shouldn't
"Happy Holidays" be forbidden for fear of
offending those who choose not to celebrate
any holiday?
In this beautiful world of political correct
ness that we have constructed, the only in
nocuous phrase we should utter is a banal "I
wish you the best this winter season." Of
course, should I like to bestow good will to
my friends abroad in Australia, I would have
to cut out "winter" as it is not winter in that
region of the globe and I might offend the
Australians. And possibly the koalas.
I have a few theories on the possible de
velopment of this phenomenon. Firstly, basic
jealousy may the explanation. Let's face it:
Christmas is a fantastic holiday. Whether or
not you believe in baby Jesus, a holiday that
emphasizes love, family, food, sales, gift-giv
ing and candy canes is an enviable holiday in
deed. I respect the right of various friends
and family members to choose not to ac
knowledge Christmas, but I confess I do pity
them. Perhaps they reject my Christmas
wishes because of sheer holiday envy. I think
the more likely explanation is that some peo
ple grow bored with the daily routine and, in
desperation, they subsequently search out
methods of creating excitement and drama in
their humdrum lives. Displays of outrage and
indignation serve this purpose well, but I re
fuse to apologize and will continue to offer a
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to
you all.
