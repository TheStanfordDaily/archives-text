"Numbing the pain for a while will only make
it worse when you finally feel it."
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,
p. 695

As we greet Winter Quarter after three
weeks of eggnog-sloshing, snow-re
lated shenanigans and other holiday
festivities, it is likely that most of us have
boxed up all of our less-than-pleasant Fall
Quarter memories and sent them to the Azk
aban. Nobody wants to remember that week
that we thought would never end, the sour
note that that one class ended on, or the mini
panic attack we had back in Week Six. While
it makes sense to package these unseemly
items away and to move ahead with the fresh
start that is the new quarter, Harry's own
dealings with the struggles in his life suggest
an interesting approach to these issues.
After getting thrown in some Triwizard
Tournament deal, scraping through three
tasks, watching Voldemort return to power
and kill Robert Pattinson oh wait, Cedric
Diggory right in front of him, one could
only imagine how physically and emotional
ly exhausted Harry was. With both Harry's
mind and body aching for dreamless sleep
and an escape from inquiring minds, the last
thing he wanted to confront was Dumble
dore telling him to engage with his pain. Al
though Harry's instincts screamed for him to
flee from the horror of the present, Dumble
dore wisely recognized that there is immense
power and healing in openly acknowledging
and sharing agonizing feelings.
Like Harry, we can all recall a time when
sharing the truth about our emotional state
was supremely difficult. Taking a Portkey
back to Freshman Year, after the NSO-fueled
dream of consistently happy students dies
with Autumn Quarter finals, the administra
tion auto-corrects with Mid-Year Convoca
tion's warnings of impending nervous break
downs. Suddenly, "Stanford Duck Syn
drome" (SDS) goes into full effect. Any signs
of actual problems or stress must be kept hid
den in the cupboard underneath the stairs,
easily ignored as busy schedules, piles of
work and friendships demand our attention.
Herein lies the problem. We may readily
admit that mental health is an issue that af-

fects us all, but it is much harder to realize, as
Dumbledore does, that it is an issue that de
mands action from us all. Because we are
constantly made aware of the resources
available to those who may need emotional
support, we tell ourselves people will get help
if they need it or make false assumptions
about the well being of others just because
they do not outwardly display signs of dis
tress. By even tacitly buying into the idea of
SDS, a facade is created that not only allows
a person to be dishonest with themselves
about what they are truly experiencing, but
that also prevents others from perceiving
these struggles and taking them seriously.

Looking back at Dumbledore's interac
tions with Harry, it is clear that he was careful
not to let Harry make excuses or avoid con
fronting the issue at hand. As Dumbledore so
astutely points out, by ignoring the problem
at that moment, Harry would have only been
allowing it to eat away at him and manifest it
self in a much more damaging fashion later.
On our campus, busyness and quick reassur
ances from our peers that they're "fine" are
just two Harry-esque distractions that soothe
our consciences and that allow a few emo
tional struggles to fester and escalate into
something more serious. Even though Sirius'
belief that such things can be managed later
maybe more appealing and practical to us, it
is imperative to acknowledge that we must
be persistent and timely in dealing with these
problems.
The real Stanford syndrome is the one
that allows us to fountain hop at obscene
hours of the day, cheer on the "truly incom
parable" LSJUMB's clothing (or lack there
of) and believe in the entrepreneurial way.
What "SDS" or any mental health issue does
is rob individuals of what a Stanford life
should be about. As we are constantly re
minded of the stigma of seeking help, it natu
rally follows that an absence of much-needed
encouragement and support makes getting
help that much harder. Even Harry, the Cho
sen One, needed a "soft" cry from Fawkes the
phoenix and a hand on the shoulder from Sir
ius to share his struggles. Thus, we are all
called upon to actively check in on the well
being of those around us and to adopt a
lifestyle of open-mindedness. Ultimately, we
all need a group of peers to support us and re
sources to help us if we are, in fact, suffering
from mental health issues. While it is the Uni
versity's responsibility to provide the latter, it
is all of our responsibilities to ensure the for
mer.
Of course, there's nothing wrong with
eggnog or snow either. From what we hear,
Dumbledore is a pretty big fan of lemon
drops and tenpin bowling himself.

Like Harry, we can
all recall a time
when sharing our
emotional state was
supremely difficult.
