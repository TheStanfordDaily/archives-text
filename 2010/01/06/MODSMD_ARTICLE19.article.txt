## TIME TO RISE UP Basketball must bounce back from painful loss to Cal 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford (6-7,0-1 Pac-10) faces a
team Wednesday that won't make
the NCAA Tournament, the NIT or
even the Pac-10 Tournament this
season. Yet USC (10-4, 2-0 Pac-10)
is probably one of the best teams in
the Pac-10 and presents a great
challenge when it comes to Maples
Pavilion tonight.
The shocking news of its post
season nullification came Sunday
for the Trojans, when the school an
nounced it was sanctioning the pro
gram by forfeiting victories and
money, reducing scholarships and
forbidding postseason play this sea
son. The sanctions arose from a
scandal surrounding former USC
star O.J. Mayo, who allegedly re
ceived more than $200,000 in bene
fits from L.A. promoter Rodney
Guillory.
Tonight's game at Maples Pavil
ion will be the first time USC has
taken the court since the punish
ment was announced. The Trojans
were on a roll before Sunday, win
ning eight games (including a 22-
point victory over then-No. 8 Ten
nessee). The 7 p.m. Pac-10 home
opener for the Cardinal will be an
important game for both teams, as
Stanford will try to get on track
after a 26-point loss at Cal to start
conference play, while the Trojans
will try to play through the pain of
having their budding postseason
hopes shot down prematurely.
The Trojans were clearly rattled
by the massive punishment, which
had little or nothing to do with any
of the current players or the current
head coach Kevin O'Neill. How
they are able to recuperate after
taking such a blow will go a long
way in determining the outcome of
Wednesday's game.
"It was the hardest thing I've had
to do," O'Neill said to the Los An
geles Times. "You're talking to a guy
who's been fired four or five times
and you're not really a coach in
this business until you've been fired
but telling our team that yester-

day was much harder than ever get
ting fired.
"I hope I don't ever have to do
that again, because when you break
young people's dreams and hearts,
that's hard to do," he added.
That said, Stanford has plenty of
issues of its own to still work out,
though most of those have taken
place on the court. The Cardinal
had a rough winter break, going 1-4
over that period. The team gave up
an average of 89 points in its last
three games, with its only win over
the break coming against James
Madison at home by the score of 80-
76. In its Pac-10 opener, Stanford
was trounced by the rival Golden
Bears, 92-66.
If anything, the Cardinal could
take its cue from the Trojans when it
comes to defense. USC has the best
team defense by far in the Pac-10, as
its opponents average only 54.5
points a game. The Trojans allowed
just 50 points to Arizona while lock
ing Arizona State down to a measly
37, so Stanford will have its hands
full when it comes to putting the
ball in the basket.

GAME NOTES: The Stanford men's basketball
team opens up its home conference slate
tonight as it hosts Pac-10-leading USC.
The Cardinal is looking to bounce back
from a disappointing loss to rival Cal on
Saturday and claim its first conference win.
The Trojans, meanwhile, won their first two
Pac-10 games by sweeping the Arizona
schools at home. However, this will be their
first game after receiving news that they
would be ineligible for postseason play due
to sanctions over illegal player payment.

Senior Landry Fields has been carrying the Cardinal on his back throughout the season, averaging 23.2 points
and 9.1 rebounds per game. Fields will be looking to lead Stanford to its first Pac-10 win of the season tonight.
will have to work out is finding pro
duction from players other than sen
ior forward Landry Fields and soph
omore guard Jeremy Green. Fields
and Green have both been stellar so
far this season Fields will proba
bly be named First-Team All Pac-10
the way his season has been going, as
he is averaging 23.2 points and 9.1
rebounds a game. Green, who was
suspended briefly for an offseason

incident before rejoining the team
for its game against Oral Roberts,
has been averaging 16.7 points and 4
rebounds a game.
Both get a large percentage of
their points from their jump shot, so
if either of the two has an off night
shooting the ball it could get ugly for
the Cardinal. In any case, though,
Stanford still has something to play
for this season. Players on the USC
basketball team, guilty of no wrong
doing, are not blessed with the privi
lege of saying that for themselves.
