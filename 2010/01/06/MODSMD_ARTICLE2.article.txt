## For 50 from Farm,CoP15 is a wrap Schneider reports 'deep engagement' by students 
### TROY YANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As Stanford students and faculty
flood back onto campus after break, a
particular group of about 50 students
and faculty are cooling off from the 15th
United Nations Climate Conference
(COPIS) in Copenhagen, Denmark.
While representatives from partici
pating countries attempted to devise
guidelines for future climate change mit
igation, the Stanford group, led by inter
disciplinary environmental studies Prof.
Stephen Schneider, received "observer"
status. They participated in side events,
spoke with delegates and networked
with policymakers and scientists.
"We said nobody was going to be an
accidental tourist," Schneider said.
"Everybody there had an obligation, and
their obligation was that they needed to
be an intern or a helper or something at
one of the nongovernment organiza
tions, at one of the start-up energy com
panies.
"We were thrilled at how deeply
engaged the Stanford students were," he
added.
Both undergraduate and graduate
students attended the conference. They
came from various departments and usu
ally had a special interest in the debate
on climate change mitigation. Many, like
Ansu Sahoo, a second-year Ph.D. stu
dent in management science and engi
neering, came away with their interests
furthered.
Sahoo was interested in how the U.S.
government should time and budget its
investments in energy technologies,
especially carbon capture and sequestra
tion technology.
"What I came away with was a num
ber of contacts that would actually help
me take my research a step forward, so
that was really exciting," Sahoo said.
"One of the things I'm looking at is to
what degree we learn from our invest-
ments. It turns out that they had
begun researching this exact question
and that's something I should be able
to access shortly."
Meanwhile, faculty members
such as Schneider; Robert Dunbar, a
professor in earth sciences; and Terry
Root, a senior fellow at the Woods
Institute for the Environment
held panels, talks and press confer
ences that addressed issues surround
ing climate change mitigation and
carbon emissions.
Schneider also held a press con
ference introducing his newest book,
"Science as a Contact Sport," where
he was criticized by filmmaker
Phelim McAleer, who produced the
documentary Not Evil Just Wrong to
challenge A1 Gore's An Inconvenient
Truth. McAleer stood up and asked
Schneider a question about climatol
ogist Phillip Jones's alleged deletion
of "inconvenient" scientific data.
After a verbal altercation, police
escorted McAleer out of the room
for disrupting the press conference.
The agreement reached by the
delegates at the conference, the
Copenhagen Accord, was drafted by
the U.S., China, India, Brazil and

South Africa, but was not unani
mously agreed upon by all represent
ed nations.
While the document recognized
that climate change was a pressing
challenge and that actions should be
taken to prevent the climate from
increasing by more than two degrees
Celsius, it was not legally binding for
any of the signatories, a result that
some smaller countries found dissat
isfying. The document also did not set
any specific actions that should be
taken by signatories to accomplish
this goal.
There were some positive devel
opments, said Stanford participants,
like Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton's pledge to help raise $lOO
billion to assist developing nations in
coping with climate change problems.
"It was much less than I wanted
and much more than I expected,"
Schneider said.
The specifics of the framework for
future mitigation remain to be
resolved in the anticipated 2010 cli
mate conference in Mexico City, set
for late November.
"I have to say, from the perspec
tive of 35 years, this is progress in the
right direction," Schneider said.
"From the perspective of what we
need, we're only 25 years too late,"
