# Men's tennis set to build on 2009 success

You hear stories of the Stanford men's ten
nis team traveling to Hawaii over Thanksgiv
ing break and you invariably become jealous.
You see tennis players wearing their free

Nike shorts, shirts, sweats and shoes and you
say to yourself, damn, I wish I were on the
team.
You watch the team steamroll over oppo
nents in the Taube Tennis Center, arguably the
premiere collegiate stadium in the nation and
become even more envious.

Then you sit in class and overhear a player
discussing the twice-weekly 7:00 a.m. work
outs and you forget why you ever wanted to
play on the team.
That is the life of a Stanford men's tennis
player.
The Cardinal, returning its top four players,

enters the 2010 season with lofty expectations.
Last season, Stanford had its national title
dream dashed by a loss to USC in the Round
of 16 at the NCAA Tournament.
This season, Stanford does not plan on
changing much. Sophomores Bradley Klahn
and Ryan Thacher, junior Alex Clayton and
senior Richard Wire, the team's top ranked
players, lead the charge for the Cardinal's 19th
national championship.
Four new freshmen will also enter the fray:
Matt Kandath, Denis Lin, Sam Ecker and
Walker Kehrer.
Stanford only loses three players from last
year's squad: Matt Bruch, Blake Muller and
Jeff Zeller. Bruch, the Pac-10 singles champi
on his freshman and senior year, is an especial
ly big loss.
Clayton is excited about the combination
of new talent and experienced veterans.
"We have a few new freshmen who are going
to make an impact immediately," he said. "We
had a really young team last year. Everyone
comes in a year older and year more mature,"
As of now most of the roster is set. Klahn,
Clayton, Thacher, Wire, Kandath and Lin will
most likely be the singles lineup.
Doubles is a little more wide-open. Klahn
and Thacher, the No. 1 ranked doubles team in
the nation and winners of the National Indoor
Championships, will assuredly be the No. 1 for
Stanford. After that, there are five players
Clayton, Wire, Kandath, Lin and junior Ted
Kelly competing for the four spots on the
two other doubles team.
Whatever the lineups end up being, the
Cardinal will not have an easy road to the
NCAA Championships. Standing in the way
of a dream season for Stanford are the peren
nial powers: USC, UCLA, Baylor,Texas, Ohio
State, Mississippi and Virginia.
Stanford gets it first test of the season Jan.
15-19 at the Sherwood Cup, which features
some of the best teams in the nation, including
USC and UCLA. While the tournament does
not matter in terms of conference play, the

Sophomore Bradley Klahn will be an instrumental part of the 2010 men's tennis team, likely playing singles and number one doubles.
Klahn and the Card have high hopes for this year after losing in the Round of 16 in last year's NCAA Tournament.
