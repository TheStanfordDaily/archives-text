# The
						plays that defined a season

### Wyndam Makowsky Between the Lines 
Football is a game of momen
tum. Even in a blowout, a few
plays can dictate the out
come. It's with that in mind
that we look at the six turning points
of Stanford's season that is, the
plays or sequences that dictated the
course of a single game or beyond
and ultimately, the Cardinal's final 8-
5 standing.
1. The Phantom Clip (at Wake Forest)
Background: Despite an offensively
anemic second half, Stanford was
driving with the score tied at the mid
way point of the fourth quarter. It was
third-and-2 from the Cardinal 45-
yard line.
The Play: Toby Gerhart, who was un
derutilized throughout the final 30
minutes, ran right and broke off a
long, 39-yard run that would have
given Stanford the ball at the Wake
Forest 16-yard line with about four
minutes to play. But a flag came out
and Chris Marinelli was whistled for
clipping, which brought the play
back.
Aftermath: The problem? There was
no evidence of such a penalty. None.
Stanford could not convert third
and-long and had to punt; Wake For
est subsequently drove the length of
the field and scored with two seconds
left. The Cardinal left North Carolina
with a 24-17 loss and an awful taste in
their mouths. Marinelli called the flag
"horrendous" and it was national
analysts were still talking about it
weeks later which, given the relative
ly low stature of the game, was both
surprising and telling.
2. The Drop (at Oregon State)
Background: After the Wake Forest
loss, Stanford tore off three wins
against San Jose State, a ranked
Washington squad and an upstart
UCLA team. The Cardinal entered
Corvallis as the top team in the con
ference and an emphatic road win
over the always-difficult Beavers
could have added further legitimacy
to their season.
The Play: Stanford started with the
ball and on the initial play from
scrimmage Andrew Luck ran a play
action pass and found a wide open,
streaking Chris Owusu over the mid
dle for what would have been a sure
touchdown. Only Owusu dropped
the pass.
Aftermath: Stanford punted five
plays later and Oregon State opened
the floodgates. By halftime, the
Beavers were leading 31-7 and were
never seriously threatened. Owusu's
touchdown wouldn't have cured
Stanford's porous defense, but it
would have been a dramatic offen
sive statement out of the gate, which
goes a long way toward establishing a
presence, if not a swagger. Instead,
the Cardinal attack didn't really get
going until the second half.
3. Fourth Down (at Arizona)
Background: In a wild match up,
Stanford had the ball with under six
minutes left in the fourth quarter,
leading by two. It was fourth down
and two from the Arizona 8 yard line.
The Play: Instead of kicking a field
goal to go up by a full score, coach Jim
Harbaugh elected to go for it. Luck's
pass to Owusu fell incomplete and
the Wildcats took over.
Aftermath: Arizona scored on their
next possession. Stanford still had
one more chance to win, but in
stead of needing just a field goal,
they had to score a touchdown. The
Cardinal turned it over on downs in
the red zone and the Wildacts pre
vailed, 43-38.
4. The Sack (vs. No. 8 Oregon)
Background: Stanford controlled
much of the game through three quar
ters. A Nate Whitaker field goal ex
tended the Cardinal lead to 17 with
three minutes to play in the third, but
