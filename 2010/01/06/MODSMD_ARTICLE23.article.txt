# Gymnasts looking to fly
## Cardinal hopes to erase pain of last year's near miss 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the members of the 2009
Stanford women's gymnastics team,
0.075 is not a lucky number. It was by
this very narrow margin, 0.075 of a
point, that the squad missed qualify
ing at last year's NCAA preliminar
ies, thus losing a spot in the Super Six
team finals. A fraction of a point had
stood between them and their goal
of reaching the championship, yet
failure to come through in the clutch
resigned the disheartened Cardinal
athletes to seats in the bleachers, as
they watched the top six teams com
pete on the floor below.
It was this frustrating finale to last
year's season, however, that has so
far proven to be the best thing that
could have happened to the Farm's
gymnastics program. This year's
team knows exactly what is at stake
and the gymnasts are back with an
intense fire and optimistic outlook
on the road ahead. Their motivation
to realize their full potential is
stronger than ever and their goal is
clear: be one of the six teams that
competes on the last day of the sea
son.
First, however, the team plans to
focus on what head coach Kristen
Smyth calls a "meet-by-meet basis."
This will require clean execution of
all 24 routines per meet, as well as a
strong focus on the aspects of the
competition that the gymnasts can
control.

And the team has no time to
waste, as the first meet of the season
will undoubtedly be the most signif
icant. This coming weekend, it will
head to Georgia to face the five-time
defending national champions in a
stadium filled with 10,000 fans.
Though the competition will certain
ly be a challenge, Coach Smyth sees
it as the perfect opportunity to im
mediately "test ourselves against the
best." Because of grueling preseason
workouts and contributions from
several key returning team mem
bers, the girls can definitely show
Georgia how it's done on the Farm.
Senior co-captain Carly Janiga is
one such critical returner, who her
coach deems "one of the top all
rounders in the nation." Janiga is a
not only a six-time All-American,
but also the reigning Pac-10 confer
ence balance beam champion. Her
new floor routine will tremendously
contribute to the team's efforts this
year, but more importantly, so will
her strong leadership skills. Smyth
describes Janiga's presence to her
teammates as "calming," which sets
the tone for workouts and the team's
overall mentality.
Junior Shelley Alexander and
senior Allyse Ishino are the two re
maining co-captains and Smyth has
high expectations for both, noting
Alexander's remarkable work ethic
and passion, as well as Ishino's
"show-stopping" floor routines. Ash
ley Morgan, a standout freshman, is
also expected to create a serious im
pact on the team with her spectacular
talents on the beam and solid vault
and floor performances.
But as the entire team acknowl
edges, their success this year will not
be a product of individual efforts.
Rather, they will utilize what Janiga
calls their "unique team chemistry"
to earn each win.

"We have a special ability to give
and receive constructive criticism
that most other teams do not have,"
Janiga said. "We are able to listen to
what our teammates have to say and
we can feel comfortable saying any
thing to each other without getting a
negative response."
In fact, team bonding has been an
important aspect of this season, as
the coaches and the players treat
each other as members of a close
knit family. This is consistently em
phasized by Smyth, who always tries
to ensure that a fun and comfortable
energy is being maintained in the
gym. Her success is certainly evident
as she enters her ninth season as
head coach: she has been named Pac
-10 Coach of the Year four times.
Yet this year in particular is spe
cial, because never before has a class
made three Super Sixes in its four
years at Stanford. This year's seniors
could be the first. Furthermore, as a
whole, the team is younger than in
past years, including several sopho
mores who were unable to compete
last season due to injuries, as well as
three freshmen who are entirely new
to the realm of collegiate gymnastics.
Yet Coach Smyth sees the team's
youth as a strong suit; it will be hard
for competing teams to keep up with
the Cardinal spirit and enthusiasm.
Thus, looking forward, the 2010
team is well deserving of four sold
out home meets in Burnham Pavil
ion. It is an exciting time to be a part
of the up and coming program and
with dynamic performances and no
shortage of all-around talent, it does
n't seem that 0.075 points will stand
in the way of anything that Stanford
women's gymnastics sets out to ac
complish.
