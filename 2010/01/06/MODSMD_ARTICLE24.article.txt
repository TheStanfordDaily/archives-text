# Card ready to run
## Track and field begins with high expectations 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
After a season of shattering records and further de
veloping the indoor program, the Stanford track and
field team is geared up and ready to attack another
season.
With a successful season in which every single Car
dinal athlete who competed at NCAA Indoor Nation
als earned All-American honors, the team will hope to
do so once more, in addition to securing top positions
in all events. The women captured the MPSF title last
season, the first time since 2006. As a testament to the
depth of the women's team, they placed in nearly
every single event. Following this spectacular per
formance, the women proceeded to continue their
success with numerous top finishes at the NCAA In
door National Championships.
The Cardinal will definitely miss some of last year's
seniors, including Lauren Centrowitz, Alicia Follmar,
Idara Otu and Claire Cormier-Thielke, However, the
returners for the Stanford women form an intimidat
ing force. The group consists of, but is not limited to,
junior Arantxa King, sophomore Mia Lattanzi, sopho
more Laurynne Chetelat and junior Whitney Liehr.
"I am very excited and anxious for this upcoming
indoor season," King said. "The team is heading into
the season with a strong freshman class, a tough quar
ter of preseason training and an overall new positive
and competitive mentality."
With a massive recruiting class of 14 freshmen
women, the team will certainly pose a stiff threat to the
competition.
"The freshmen girls will help the team win the
MPSF title this year," said freshman Karynn Dunn,
whose individual goal is to qualify for the NCAA
Championships in long jump and the 100-meter
hurdles.

"The women's team has an enormous amount of
potential," King added. "I am confident that we will do
well this season. We are focused and are really looking
forward to bringing home a team title."
This will be King's first completely healthy season
since her freshman year.
"Personally, I am looking to have a breakthrough
season," she affirmed. "I am concentrated on jumping
consistently for the ultimate goal of performing well at
NCAAs."
The men will be returning some top performers
from last year, including sophomore Chris Derrick,
who placed fourth at Nationals last year in the 5,000
meters with a time of 13:48.26. Derrick will be joined
by teammate Elliott Heath, a redshirt sophomore who
placed third in the 3,000 meters at Nationals with a
time of 7:54.59.
The men's team will miss the leadership and domi
nance in the hurdles of 2009 graduate Myles Bradley.
However, the team boasts a large class of 17 recruits,
providing great depth for the Cardinal men.
"The track team has a lot of young talent this year
looking to do big things in NCAAs," said senior Justin
Reed.
Other top returners for the men include sopho
more Amaechi Morton, who had an incredible out
door season last year, as well as senior Ryan Fisicaro.
With a strong foundation of seniors and leaders on the
team, built upon with the fresh energy of the fresh
men, the men will prove a dominant force in the
league and have their eyes set on a championship title.
The men and women will go into action for the in
door season on the weekend of Jan. 16, competing in
Seattle at the University of Washington Indoor Pre
view.
