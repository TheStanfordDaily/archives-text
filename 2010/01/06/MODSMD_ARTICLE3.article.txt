# STUDENT LIFE
## 'Luck has nothing to do with it' Counsel abounds at frosh mid-year talk 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI 
The spirit of Tuesday's mid-year
freshman convocation was embodied in
the class T-shirts that were summarily
distributed after the event, which read,
"Stanford 'l3: Luck has nothing to do
with it."
The Class of 2013 packed Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last night for what Dean of
Freshmen Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9
described as the largest convocation
turnout Stanford has ever seen. The
class gathered to reflect on its first three
months of Stanford and hear words of
wisdom from people who have "been
there,"
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman '79 began by
welcoming the freshmen and asking
them to reflect on how they have
changed in their first 111 days as under-
graduates.
"Do you remember what I asked
you on the Quad during orientation
week?" Bravman said. A few hands
shot up in the audience.
A student responded, "Who are
you becoming?"
The student was rewarded with
an iPod, which Bravman tossed from
stage. A fellow "thirteener" could be
heard: "This definitely wouldn't hap
pen at Berkeley."
Lythcott-Haims followed
Bravman, communicating a desire
on behalf of the entire University
that each member of the Class of
2013 finds his or her home on cam
pus.
"I follow you on Facebook I
know many of you call Stanford
home," she said. "We want you to
love this place and feel you belong
here so you feel fully vested in our
opportunities, our resources and the

help we have to give."
A panel discussion with current
Stanford upperclassmen followed.
Panelists shared highlights of their
time at Stanford, but also significant
moments of failure and self-discov
ery.
"I had a pretty bad freshman
year," said Henry Tsai 'lO. "I called
first quarter the worst three months
of my life."
Tsai said he later found his aca
demic niche in comparative studies
in race and ethnicity and was recent
ly accepted to Harvard Business
School.
Peter Chadri 'lO, an international
relations major from Nairobi, also
encouraged the freshmen. "All of
you guys are really bright. Don't
think you're not supposed to be
here," he said.
Lythcott-Haims said the event
was organized such that, instead of
comprising of a series of administra
tors, students had the chance to hear
the stories of peers who have been in
their shoes.

She emphasized how critical it is
that Stanford undergraduates lean

on one another as they make their
way through college.
"One of the goals of this event is
to show students that things like
tutoring and getting advice or coun
seling are not things to be ashamed
of," she said. "Very often, students try
to do it alone and they think seeking
help is a weakness. We see it as a sign
of great strength."
Freshman Karen Shen said after
ward, "I like the stuff about it taking
a little bit of time to find your place
at Stanford and that it's normal and
understandable."
