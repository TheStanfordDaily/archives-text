She's back in the classroom. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice faced countless "Challenges and Dilemmas in American Foreign
Policy" of her own last decade, and that's exactly what she's tackling
in Political Science 214R this quarter. The class meets Tuesday afternoons
for three hours in the Lou Henry Hoover Building. Twenty students,
who were admitted through an application process, and three
Knight Fellows of Journalism join Prof. Rice in the course, according
to one enrolled student. Rice, who served as Stanford's provost from
1993 to 1999, took leave from her position as Stanford professor of
political science when she joined the Bush administration in 2001, first
as National Security Advisor and later as Secretary of State.
