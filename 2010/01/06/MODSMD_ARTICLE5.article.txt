# Drinking rules revisited
## Will county continue to exempt Stanford from social host policy? 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's one-year exemption
from Santa Clara County's social host
ordinance to crack down on underage
drinking is up for re-evaluation by
county officials later this month.
The ordinance, which went into
effect in January 2009 and applies to
unincorporated areas of the county
such as the University, holds account
able parents and those over 21 who
host parties where underage drinking
occurs. The penalties are civil, not
criminal, and one warning can be
issued before violators are fined.
Because of Stanford's pre-existing
"extensive" program to curtail under

age drinking, the University was
granted a one-year exemption from
the ordinance to continue efforts free
from the county's new regulation. The
results of the past year will be pre
sented to the county's board of super
visors for evaluation at its board
meeting on Jan. 26.
Stanford officials suggested that
the language changes they will pro
pose would make the exemption
more permanent; the past year's
exemption, they said, was successful.
"[The current set-up] has worked
very well this past year," said Jean
McCown, Stanford's director of com
munity relations. "Obviously we have
an extensive set of alcohol policies on
campus, and the original intent [of the

ordinance] was already being upheld
by Stanford."
Liz Kniss, president of the county
board of supervisors, whose district
includes Stanford, said as much. "As
far as I can say, there haven't been
any incidents that show a problem
with the current exemption Stanford
has from the ordinance," she said.
"We've worked well with them in the
past, and I have faith we'll find an
agreement for the future."
McCown said that this time, how
ever, Stanford isn't hoping for an
extension of the exemption, but
would rather have the language of the
ordinance changed to accommodate
Stanford's unique situation in a
more permanent way a change
she said was very "technical."
"Our suggestion [a year ago] was
for a change in the ordinance lan
guage," she said. "[The county]
found it simpler to just exempt us,
but it never quite felt like the best
way."
Both McCown and Substance
Abuse Prevention Program
Manager Ralph Castro said the
University is planning to meet with
county staff to sketch out possible
language changes for the next year.
But supervisors say they are not sure
what the outcome will be.
"It's too early to say," Kniss said.
"Stanford is a particular aspect of
dealing with this, and it needs to be
dealt with as a particular segment."
Kniss echoed McCown in

emphasizing that no matter the out
come of the meeting, the goals of the
county and the University are the
same: to reduce underage drinking.
Stanford's exemption was sched
uled to be considered at the Dec. 15
supervisors' meeting, but was post
poned because Stanford spokespeo
ple weren't yet ready to present
their case.
