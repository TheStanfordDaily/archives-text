# Drinking rules revisited
## Will county continue to exempt Stanford from social host policy? 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's one-year exemption
from Santa Clara County's social host
ordinance to crack down on underage
drinking is up for re-evaluation by
county officials later this month.
The ordinance, which went into
effect in January 2009 and applies to
unincorporated areas of the county
such as the University, holds account
able parents and those over 21 who
host parties where underage drinking
occurs. The penalties are civil, not
criminal, and one warning can be
issued before violators are fined.
Because of Stanford's pre-existing
"extensive" program to curtail under

age drinking, the University was
granted a one-year exemption from
the ordinance to continue efforts free
from the county's new regulation. The
results of the past year will be pre
sented to the county's board of super
visors for evaluation at its board
meeting on Jan. 26.
Stanford officials suggested that
the language changes they will pro
pose would make the exemption
more permanent; the past year's
exemption, they said, was successful.
"[The current set-up] has worked
very well this past year," said Jean
McCown, Stanford's director of com
munity relations. "Obviously we have
an extensive set of alcohol policies on
campus, and the original intent [of the

ordinance] was already being upheld
by Stanford."
Liz Kniss, president of the county
board of supervisors, whose district
includes Stanford, said as much. "As
far as I can say, there haven't been
any incidents that show a problem
with the current exemption Stanford
has from the ordinance," she said.
"We've worked well with them in the
past, and I have faith we'll find an
agreement for the future."
McCown said that this time, how
ever, Stanford isn't hoping for an
extension of the exemption, but
would rather have the language of the
ordinance changed to accommodate
