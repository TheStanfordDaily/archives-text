## Senate, 15 strong, hear executives' plan 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Andy Parker 'lO, newly-appointed ASSU
vice president, will maintain his position as
executive chief of staff while juggling his
new appointment as right-hand man for
President David Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO.
That was the announcement at last
night's Undergraduate Senate meeting,
where Senator Shelley Gao 'll returned
after a quarter in Washington, D.C. and
Daniel Limon 'l2 from a fall quarter leave of
absence.
Parker announced that he and Gobaud
made the decision during winter break
based on the time constraints of the term
and a need to move quickly this quarter. At
the end of fall quarter, Gobaud was still try
ing to get an earlier nominee, Farah Abuzeid
'lO, approved by the Senate.
"It's not an ideal situation, but
right now we don't feel that we have
the time to get someone new up to
speed," Parker said Tuesday.
Gobaud will now shoulder much
of the executive team's spring sustain
ability event as the pair continue to
adjust to the sudden resignation of
former Vice President Jay de la Torre
'lO in November.
Gobaud's handling of de la Torre's
resignation drew fire in December.
Last night, senators pushed forward
talks on ASSU ethics reforms.
Gao suggested forming a task
force to address ASSU integrity as
well as the potential for a conflict of
interest or bias for officials who serve
on judicial panels, as Gobaud was at
the time of de la Torre's case.
(Gobaud was involved in hearing
other students' cases, not de la
Torre's.)
Lee Jackson 'l2 announced that he
and Adam Creasman 'll may co
author a conflict of interest bill that
would prohibit dual service on the
ASSU and Judicial Affairs panels or
the Constitutional Council.
A similar plan to ease potential
biases was considered by the 10th
Undergraduate Senate last year, Gao
reported, but was ultimately shot
down.
"Some senators felt very strongly
about how ASSU senators are in very
good positions to make a very sub
stantial contribution to those commit
tees," she said.
Gao suggested the formation of a
task force or a brainstorming session,
at the very least.
"I think that we need to take some
steps into investigating and construct
ing positive measures in terms of the
ethical conduct of ASSU officials,"
she said.
With winter quarter's start.
Elections Commissioner Quinn Slack
'll is in the midst of setting up the
elections Web site for this spring. With
three months until elections, Slack on
Tuesday announced a trial version.
"The main change is that it will
show candidate profiles on the bal
lot," he said.

Two bills to confirm funding for
publications Vox Clara and The Claw
were unanimously passed at last
night's meeting. A bill to confirm co
chairs of marketing and chair of

health and wellness will be put to vote
next week.
