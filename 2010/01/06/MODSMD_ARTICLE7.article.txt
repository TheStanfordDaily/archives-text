### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Last night's Senate ethics dis
cussion followed a flurry of pro
posed changes that made the
rounds on the group's public e
mail list last month, prompting a
rare response from head of
Student Activities and
Leadership Nanci Howe as the
group broke for finals.
At the undergraduates' Dec.
1 meeting, several senators
grilled ASSU President David
Gobaud on how he handled the
fallout from his former vice

president's resignation, Jay de la
Torre 'lO. After the meeting,
Senator Lee Jackson 'l2 said he
wanted help writing a bill that
would bar elected ASSU offi
cials from serving as judicial
affairs panelists.
Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO was
serving as a panelist last summer
when he said he was accidental
ly handed the case file of his vice
president, who happened to be
responding to a plagiarism accu
sation at the time.
