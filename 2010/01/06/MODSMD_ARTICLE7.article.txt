# ASSU ethics reform ideas pitched; little consensus on avoiding judicial surprises
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Last night's Senate ethics dis
cussion followed a flurry of pro
posed changes that made the
rounds on the group's public e
mail list last month, prompting a
rare response from head of
Student Activities and
Leadership Nanci Howe as the
group broke for finals.
At the undergraduates' Dec.
1 meeting, several senators
grilled ASSU President David
Gobaud on how he handled the
fallout from his former vice

president's resignation, Jay de la
Torre 'lO. After the meeting,
Senator Lee Jackson 'l2 said he
wanted help writing a bill that
would bar elected ASSU offi
cials from serving as judicial
affairs panelists.
Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO was
serving as a panelist last summer
when he said he was accidental
ly handed the case file of his vice
president, who happened to be
responding to a plagiarism accu
sation at the time.
In response to Jackson,
Senator Adam Creasman 'll
offered another idea: to allow
elected ASSU officials to be noti
fied if an official is found respon
sible of a Fundamental Standard
or Honor Code violation by
Judicial Affairs.
"What if the charges are without
basis?" asked Senator Michael
Cruz 'l2. "Should we strip someone
of their ability to run for office just
because they are under review,
whether or not those charges are
verified?"
Current judicial panelist Thorn
Scher 'll chimed in, noting that "to
notify after guilt, but before sanc
tioning isn't entirely feasible"
because of the timing of the judi
cial affairs process.

Howe added her two cents Dec.
4 in a self-described "rare" moment
of e-mail list participation. She said
she wanted to emphasize the rights
of accused students.

"A key part of the ASSU consti
tution includes the 'rights of the
accused,' which discusses issues of
confidentiality and the concept of
students are considered innocent
until proved guilty beyond a rea
sonable doubt," Howe wrote.
"I believe that decisions regard
ing leader conduct would have to
be in keeping with the rights of the
accused for all students, including
ASSU leaders," she said. "Changes
to this [system] would have to be
approved as an amendment to the
constitution in a student body elec
tion and then approved by the
University president."
She advised student leaders to
refer to the University's code of
conduct for an example as they
move ahead with ethics reforms
discussions.
