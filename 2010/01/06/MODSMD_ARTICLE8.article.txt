## State Supreme Court hears Stanford trail dispute 
### ADAM COLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ten years ago, Stanford started designing
two pedestrian trails that would extend a
growing web of pathways spanning the penin
sula.
Nearly a decade later, bulldozers, environ
mentalists and the boards of supervisors from
two counties await a California Supreme
Court decision that could alter the fate of
these trails.
The trails fulfill part of a deal made
between Santa Clara County and Stanford in
2000. Stanford started construction of the first
trail, located south of Page Mill Road, but
when the University tried to move the second
trail across Alpine Road into San Mateo
County, local environmentalists raised con
cerns about the effect on land near a local
creek.
"There is not enough road on that side, so
that means they'll have to intrude into the
riparian area of San Francisquito Creek," said
Brian Schmidt J.D. '99, a legislative advocate
for the Committee for Green Foothills, a
watchdog group that has been looking over
Stanford's shoulder since 1962.
"Stanford got the county to move the trails
without an assessment of the environmental
impact," Schmidt added.
Debra Zumwalt, Stanford vice president
and general counsel, said such an assessment
would be done after the San Mateo County
Board of Supervisors approved construction,
which they have not yet done.
Now, the Supreme Court must decide if the
Committee for Green Foothills filed its
protest in time to delay the project. The court
heard the case on Dec. 8.
Stanford decided to halt construction on
both trails until a ruling is announced.
"I expect a decision within the next
month," Zumwalt said. "If we prevail on this,
as we hope to, we can go ahead and start
building these trails."

TIMING IS EVERYTHING: Trails that Stanford proposed expanding in 2000, including one along Alpine Road, top, have drawn scrutiny
from the locally-based Committee for Green Foothills. The state Supreme Court is deciding the fate of the committee's protest against the plan.
