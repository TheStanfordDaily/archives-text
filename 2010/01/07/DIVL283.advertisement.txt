This national best-seller, Farm Sanctuary: Changing Hearts and Minds About Animals and Food
(Touchstone/Simon & Schuster; Nov. 4, 2008; $l5/paperback; 0-7432-9159-X) is a thought provoking
investigation of the ethical questions involved in the production of beef, poultry, pork, milk, and eggs -
and what each of us can do to promote compassion and help stop the systematic mistreatment of the
ten billion farm animals who are exploited specifically for food in the United States every year.
