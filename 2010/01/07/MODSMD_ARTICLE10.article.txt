## EDITORIAL Part 1: In climate talks, it's time for a paradigm shift 
### 
This December, environmentalists
around the world pinned their hopes
on the greatly anticipated U.N. Climate
Change Conference in Copenhagen; an at
tempt to reach a binding international treaty
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But
even before the talks started, enthusiasm
waned as countries quibbled over a series of
underwhelming promises. Sure enough, dis
appointment reigned when the outcome
yielded scant progress: a vague, 12-paragraph
accord that reiterated a set of goals with no
real plans to achieve them.
Domestically, the prospects of combating
climate change look no better. The Senate
seems poised to tie President Obama's hands
by forming a brick wall of resistance against
the cap-and-trade bill up for vote this year,
even though it offers only a paltry three per
cent cut in carbon dioxide emissions from
1990 levels by 2020 (the European Union
was willing to go as high as 30 percent). Even
Democratic senators have lined up in oppo
sition to the President, with their sentiments
summed up by Sen. Kent Conrad: "Climate
change in an election year has very poor
prospects."
Indeed, with an economy only barely
reemerging from disaster, opponents of the
legislation are sure to lambaste any form of
carbon taxation for costing jobs and stifling
growth. But in reality, the economic crisis is
nothing but a smokescreen for the actual po
litical reason causing Congress to keep whiff
ing on this issue: only 36 percent of Ameri
cans attribute global warming to humans.
The natural instinct this statistic brings
out in climate policy advocates is a corrective

one teach the science better and teach it
more but unfortunately, such efforts have
proven inadequate. It is time for environ
mentalists to come to grips with the deeply
rooted intractability of the public's view of
climate change. After years of scientific con
sensus on virtually indisputable evidence,
scores of publicity campaigns and a president
who proclaimed the dangers of global warm
ing while riding a wave of popularity into the
White House, the American public still does
not get it.
And it never will. Environmentalists can
never convince the public of the exigency of
reducing emissions because, at its core, this
debate is not about the facts. British colum
nist George Monbiot called the Copenhagen
conference "a battle between two world
views," and a person's world view is a difficult
thing to change. Certain political factions
have made it clear that they cherish indis
criminate pollution as an unalienable right.
No amount of physics and chemistry and
data will change that. And by excoriating en
vironmentalists for conspiring to trample
freedoms and smother economies, they have
drawn enough support to pose an indelible
obstruction, stopping climate progress in its
tracks.

That is why it is time for a paradigm shift
in the climate change conversation an en
vironmental audible. If the American people
will not make economic sacrifices to hedge
against global warming, they must be con
vinced that they will not have to, or better
yet, that actions will reap benefits.
