# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## The 						Much-Awaited Jersey Shore Column 
### Emily Hulme 
Ovid's number one rule of poetry is that
the material must fit the meter. Since
this is a college paper in the Land of
the Free, I took a little poll and direct democ
racy has prevailed in providing me a fitting
topic, just in time for the forthcoming
episode tonight: Jersey Shore.
For those living in a dungeon, Jersey
Shore putatively follows the lives, loves, hot
tub sessions (no bathing suit needed!) and al
cohol-fueled rages of token natives of the
Italian-American seaboard. The cast of char
acters is a motley crew. JWOWW, an orange
toned beauty, exclusively wears those shirts
with the claw marks in the back. Snooki, or
ange-toned and shorter, I find the most fasci
nating, as the most self-aware: she declared
on one episode: she is not "mature" enough
for the program. Also, she was punched in the
face by some dude, leading to an impromptu
heart to heart with the entire cast. Angelina,
an orange-toned girl of average height, was
kicked off after she fell into a painful depres
sion related to her boyfriend getting a di
vorce from his wife that was not her. Sammi
"Sweetheart," also an orange-toned girl of
average height, is mainly notable for not get
ting punched in the face or having a married
boyfriend. Also, her poofs (or is it pooves?)
are not nearly as intimidating as Snooki's;
since the NY Times recently ran an article as
serting that Stanford students use bikes as
machines to assert our distinct identities, I
feel reasonably confident about the validity
of asserting that truly, the poof is what deter
mines the character of the Jersey Girl. On the
Shore, pooves and relationships are compli
cated, but skin tone is not.
I should also mention that there are boys,
or "guidos," on the program. Ronnie seems
nice. One male cast member, according to my
Wikipedia research, was once a male exotic
dancer. That probably summarizes the mat
ters of interest, since, should you ever meet a
cast member, I am unconvinced that they
would be particularly interesting. I have en
countered washing machines that seem
deeper. Indeed, the situations defying cus
tom or common sense are the real meat of
the show and the relationships that evolve
during the most emotionally thrilling sum
mer since Laguna Beach. In some sense,
Jonah Goldberg says this better, though, than
I. In his critique/diatribe about the show, he
admits, "don't get me wrong; it's great televi
sion. But gladiatorial games would be great
TV, too." Of course, it's neither here nor there
that any particular gladiator be in the arena.
It's the fight that matters; and so it goes on
the Shore. Ultimately, it's absurd to ask
where Snooki came from or is going; the nar
rative is all about the here and now. None are
particularly colorful characters, but none
need be.

Perhaps this is why Jersey Shore does best
with people who, frankly, we perceive to have
little direction in life. Anyone want to take a
guess on where Snooki will be in five years?
Working at a tanning salon? Picking up
phones? Hosting her own reality spin-off?
And, probably more fantastically for me and
anyone I've ever watched it with, they don't
seem to feel obligated to think about their
own lives this way. It's an exotic land in which
the word "career" would sound as foreign as
"IHUM." There is a delightful logical consis
tency to their concerns, insofar as they are
principally short-sighted. Neither the charac
ters nor MTV feel obliged to keep the word
"planned" in their vocabulary. Planning, very
well, could spell the end of the uncontrolled
energy propelling the whole carnival of vices.
Untouched by rational thought, this wild
man isn't found in the forest, but on the
boardwalk. National Geographic, take note:
developing a program featuring this foreign
culture could prove quite lucrative.
Until then, we'll have to rely on MTV to
shock with their latest. The bizarre will al
ways entertain and for the network that pro
duces such masterpieces as "16 and Preg
nant," this is just another chapter in their
Bible of popular diversions. Sarah Palin,take
note.

Emily Hulme's Internet is no longer controlled
by the gypsy hordes, and/or Silvio Berlusconi.
