# FLECHAS Y PEDRADAS
## Peter, Paul & Mary 
### Patrick Kozey 
So, I'm back from Spain byway of Indiana
and the cold (at least in Indiana) harsh
reality of my return is setting in: not
much is different . Sure, the songs I hear on the
radio or drifting out from open dorm doors
aren't acoustic covers of "Ayo Technology,"
an erstwhile number-one-hit in Spain, but I
can handle that. I may not be able to handle
the reemergence of that Imogen Heap song
that refuses to die, now as the hook of a
mediocre R&B song thank you Andy
Samberg and Jason Derulo or Britney's
newest effort to stay shocking with her, "look
at me! I want to fuck two guys!" anthem that
is "3". Also Kesha. I can't handle that.
Let me revise my previous assertion: not
much is different, but what is different refus
es to leave me alone. It's the minute changes
that fight what otherwise might be an all-too
easy fall back into familiarity. Stern Late
Night has a new name that's almost as hip as
its new tables and dimly lit atmosphere, which
is either there to encourage the ambience of
slick night spot or to reduce the obviousness
of how drunk/high its patrons are. I live on the
other side of campus from my old "home(s)"
of Wilbur and Stern and so everything I walk
to, I must walk to backward. What is really dif
ferent? There are 1600 more people on this

campus since the last time I was here, none of
whom I have ever had the chance to meet.
1600 others, some of whom I knew, are gone.
Both those numbers will only grow in the
years to come. And that matters. Because
with those leaving goes their knowledge of
this place the good and the bad.
Institutional memory is short in a place
with a rapid turnover. At businesses short on
employee training, say Wal-Mart or Mcdon
ald's, that doesn't matter much. Little conti
nuity means less chance that a sense of be
longing will develop, which in turn makes any
sort of organized effort to maintain traditions
or fix apparent issues much less likely. That's
fine for a place concerned solely with contin
uing to exist, but Stanford ought to be more
than that. We learn things here and in four
years, we as students ought to feel like we be
long here, like we are a part of something that
is bigger than just us, bigger than just our
classes. If there are things we want to stay the
same, we should conserve them. If there are
things that need changing, we should do that
too.
If we don't, someone else will. A place
short on institutional memory is a place with
an identity vulnerable to assault. Be it by mis
guided attempts at radical reform or close-

minded attempts to push conformity, all it
takes are small, gradual steps that add up
slowly until the place we know now disap
pears. How much of what I thought was nor
mal will be gone by the time I graduate? How
long would it take to make this place feel un
recognizable enough that finding my old
haunts will be like sifting through a recon
structed archeological dig site?
In the coming weeks, in this space, I'll be
looking for things about this place I love,
things that I want to stay the same no matter
how many years pass after I leave and for
things I see now and wish were different. As
the weather turns "bad" and pushes us to
ward introspection, I hope you'll do the same.
While you do, please find something better to
listen to than innuendo so obvious it would
make Madonna cry foul. And Kesha. Don't
listen to her. You'll already have made Stan
ford and the world, a better place.

James managed to turn in his first column since
arriving in the U.S. later than anything he sub
mitted while debauching in Spain. His editor is
not pleased, but wants you to take heed of what
the schmuck says. Enjoy this glorious morsel of
pretentious opining and then tell James to shape
up atpkozey@stanford.edu.
