## Stephen Colbert... on ice? 
### Kabir Sawhney 
Stephen Colbert, host of Com
edy Central's The Colbert
Report, has become one of
the most famous and influen
tial figures in America since his show
first aired in October 2005. His show
parodies the style of conservative TV
talk show hosts, and his egomaniacal
bluster has gained him a significant
following, known as "Colbert Na
tion."
Since his meteoric rise, Colbert
has come to wield an influence far
beyond his late-night TV show. He
has appeared at the White House,
been called the "Voice of a Genera
tion," and even has a treadmill
named after him at the International
Space Station. However, until now,
Colbert has mostly stayed out of the
sports world, mainly confining him
self to political satire and fake pun
ditry.
However, when the U.S. Speed
skating team lost its chief sponsor,
the defunct Dutch bank DSB, Col
bert stepped in. Though now the
team's principal sponsor, Colbert
himself didn't forward the $300,000
needed for the team to attend the
Vancouver Olympic Games in Feb
ruary; the team will be financed by
donations from Colbert Nation, and
the money has already been raised.
The team's uniforms will feature the
Colbert Nation logo.
Colbert's decision to sponsor the
team has generated a significant re
action. U.S. Speedskating has been
enthusiastic about the initiative. Its
executive director appeared on The
Report to encourage Colbert Nation
to donate to the team, and short
track star Apolo Anton Ohno has
also sounded his approval about the
idea. Announcing the initiative, Col
bert said, "On their enormous, bill
board thighs, it will say, 'Colbert Na
tion' ... Be looking for that logo as it
comes around the final turn. It will be
easy to see because it will be in first
place."
While most of the skaters seem
amenable to the Colbert Nation
sponsorship, Shani Davis, one of the
U.S.'s top stars, called Colbert a
"jerk" in an interview with a Canadi
an newspaper. Davis' comments
came in response to a question about
Colbert's criticism of Canadians on
his show, which included an attack on
Vancouver officials for denying in
ternational athletes access to
Olympic venues. Colbert has called
Canadians "syrup-suckers" and "ice
holes" on his show.
Colbert's sponsorship has also
drawn a great deal of attention to
speedskating, historically America's
best sport in the Winter Olympics.
Colbert recently appeared on the
cover of Sports Illustrated and dis
cussed in the magazine how his TV
persona views the Olympics. He said,
"It's away to prove who's got the
best country. Only nobody gets
