# TROJANS TRAMPLED
## Cardinal defeats USC by one point in final seconds 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
Whether it was the free Chipotle for the
6th Man section, the prospect of seeing LiP
Romeo or merely the excitement of a Pac-10
home opener, Stanford men's basketball
played to a full house at Maples Pavilion last
night with 6,520 fans in attendance. Romeo
didn't show for the Trojans' 54-53 loss, but
the Cardinal combo of sophomore Jeremy
Green and senior Landry Fields did and
they put on a better show than most expect
ed after Stanford went 1-4 during winter
break.
While the win, which pushed the Cardinal
to 1-1 in conference play (7-7 overall), was
by no means a runaway full of glitz and glam
our, Stanford finally earned a victory in a
meeting that came down to the final posses
sions a much needed statement after the
team lost two games this year by two points
or fewer.
Coach Johnny Dawkins said the ball just
bounced in Stanford's favor during this trip
down the stretch, while Fields offered a dif
ferent explanation: sheer resolve.
When asked what was going through his
mind as Stanford's seven-point lead evapo
rated in the final minute, Fields simply said,
"We're not losing this game. Not this time."
The Trojans were expected to be formida
ble opponents at 2-0 in the Pac-10 (10-4 over
all), but this proved only partially true. USC
came out flat offensively in the first half
falling to an early 11-3 deficit and shooting
42.3 percent to Stanford's 48.1 and hung
back on defense, leading to what head coach
Kevin O'Neill called "a complete lack of ef
fort." Still, with only two major producers for
each team (guard Dwight Lewis and forward
Alex Stephenson for USC, with 13 and nine
points, respectively, and Fields and Green for
Stanford with 12 and seven), the margin was
only 31-28 at the break.
USC pulled things together defensively
after halftime and was able to keep Fields
without a field goal in the second half. But
the Trojans couldn't contain Green, who
eventually led Stanford with 17 points.
With 3:48 to go, Green hit a three from
deep in the corner, putting Stanford back up
by seven. USC senior Mike Gerrity respond
ed with a long ball of his own to make it 52-
46 before Green hit another jumper 20 sec
onds later at 2:01.
In the end, though, it wasn't Green's or
Fields' scoring that put the nails in USC's
coffin, as their combined 31 was outdone by

Stephenson's and Lewis' 35. Instead, it was
contributions from sophomore big men An
drew Zimmerman and Jack Trotter with
10 and six, respectively that gave the Car
dinal the edge.
"In a game where the final score is 54-53,
10 points is a heck of a lot of points,"
Dawkins said.
Dawkins was pleased with the balance of
the team, especially among the young play
ers.
"I think some guys did some growing up
tonight on our team by being put in that po
sition," Dawkins said. "For sophomores that
never really played a lot of minutes, playing
at this level is an adjustment. But they're ad
justing to the level of competition ... They
compete, they work hard for us and they
come out every game and they give us what
they have."
As sophomore Jarrett Mann stepped up
to have the final chance, he was, in fact, ad
justing. With 10 seconds to go, after class
mate Zimmerman had failed to convert ei
ther free throw at the 32-second mark, Mann
took his own spot on the line on a reaching
foul by Trojan forward Leonard Washington.
Mann, who had missed back-to-back free
throws at the same mark on Nov. 25 to send
the game with then-No. 5 Kentucky to over
time in which Stanford eventually fell 73-
65 missed the front end. Flowever, his sec
ond fell and USC missed a jumper and its
put-back at the other end, leaving Stanford
on top.
In a season when a single conference win
sometimes seemed like a stretch for the
Card, this victory over USC will be a big mo
mentum booster, especially going into Satur
day's 3 p.m. matchup against UCLA.
Dawkins said he was proud of the team
and of the win, but that it hardly came as a
surprise: "I think we can be as competitive as
any team in the conference, and we have to
believe that."
