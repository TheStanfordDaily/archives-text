## 2010 Football Outlook 
### Wyndam Makowsky 
Stanford football released its 2010 schedule
Monday, as the Cardinal looks to improve
upon a successful 2009 season.
Stanford will open on The Farm against
Sacramento State the Hornets are a Foot
ball Championship Subdivision team that re
places San Jose State on the Cardinal's non

conference slate.
But while Stanford may start off easy, their
schedule will immediately step up in both
toughness and importance the Cardinal will
travel south the next weekend to face UCLA
to open Pac-10 play. The Bruins, an up-and
coming program in its own right, pose a diffi
cult test, but a win would not simply have con
ference implications the game will be na

tionally broadcast, giving the Cardinal an early
opportunity to make a countrywide statement.
Stanford will then wrap up its non-confer
ence schedule at home against Wake Forest
and then in South Bend against Notre Dame.
In a reversal from this year, the Cardinal will
face two of its toughest tests early in the year
it heads to Eugene to take on Oregon be
fore returning to Stanford to host USC.

The Cardinal will then have a bye before
homecoming against Washington State. The
next week prompts a trip to Seattle to take on
Washington, before coming home again to face
Arizona. Stanford has Arizona State on the
road before another bye, after which it will face
Oregon State on The Farm and Cal in Berkeley.
