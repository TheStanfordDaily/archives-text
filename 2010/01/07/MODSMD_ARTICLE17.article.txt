# CRUISING INTO SPRING
## 
### CLAUDIA LOPEZ 
The Stanford men's swimming and div
ing team has been whizzing past competi
tors, earning the title as one of the top swim
and dive teams in the nation.
The Cardinal has the No. 1 ranked re
cruiting class, including a total of 16 All-
American swimmers. Stanford looks to
ratchet up its training in the coming weeks
in order to prepare for the more competi
tive spring season.
"The first part of the season is being
more focused on the spring. It's not about
how fast you can swim in the fall but how
fast you can swim in the spring," said junior
swimmer David Mosko. "We don't have to
do a whole lot of qualifying in the begin
ning of the year."
Many of the major competitions occur
in the spring, including the NCAA champi
onship and Pac-10 championship. But
while its focus lies forward, the Cardinal al
ready has built up an extremely impressive
record so far this year.
"We are right there," said Coach Skip
Kenney. "We are going to battle for the
Pac-10 championship and the NCAA
championship. We don't know what kind of
teams we'll be facing."

In the Stanford swim team's first meet
in September against the University of
New Orleans, the Cardinal men swept
UNO and took first place in almost every
event.
In the beginning of October, the Cardi
nal hosted its first meet of the 09-10 season
against the University of Hawaii. The
men's swim team was stacked with a total
of sixteen All-American swimmers and
senior Dwight Dumais was victorious at
both diving events. At the Pacific Invita
tional in Stockton in mid-October, Stan
ford won eight out of the ten events against
Air Force, Brigham Young University, Cal
and Pacific.
In early November, senior Carmen Stel
lar took first in the three-meter against
Florida and Michigan at the tri-meet in
Gainesville, Florida.
The Cardinal dominated the rest of No
vember as Stanford swimmers swept
through the Tri-Distance Meet, hosted by
Cal. Senior Eugene Godsoe won the 50-
meter back (22.58), 100-meter back (48.26)
and 200-meter back (1:47.00), giving him a
win in each of the backstroke events. La
Tourette also had a successful meet as he

Coming off of a long string of victories in the fall and boasting a No. 1 ranked recruiting class, the Cardinal men's swimming and diving team
hopes to start its spring season off strongly. Several swimmers have recently been honored for their accomplishments, including Chad La Tourrette,
who broke a 26-year-old American record in the 800-meter freestyle in December. The team hosts Pacific on Saturday to start the spring season.
won the 500-meter freestyle (4:29.48)
and 1000-meter freestyle (9:09.14).
In addition. La Tourette recently
returned from the Dual in the Pool, a
competition where athletes from
Britain, Italy and Germany come to
gether and form a team to compete
against the USA, hosted in Manches
ter, England in mid December.
"I was really pleased with my per
formance. It was actually the last time

we wore body suits in a competition,"
LaTourette said.
While the team's performances so
far may inspire confidence, the Car
dinal swimmers may be facing some
unfamiliar faces when they dive back
into the pool this spring. Many
schools, including Cal, Auburn and
USC, bring in freshmen after the fall
competitions, leaving many schools
like Stanford in suspense about po
tential spring surprises.
"You can go to some school for
[just a few] weeks then go to NCAAs,
" Kenney said about the practice of
racing freshmen in their first year.
"That doesn't happen here. You have

to be a student athlete, which is the
way it should be."
The Cardinal still holds a few
goals in mind to achieve before com
petition starts.
"We have to work on speed," Ken
ney said. "As our speed gets better,
our turns should get better."
Many of the Stanford swimmers
have already earned outstanding
achievements this past year and they
look toward the spring season as an
opportunity to boost their records.
La Tourette has won two Ail-
Americans in the 500-meter and
1500-meter freestyle in 2009 and was
also the Pac-10 Champion in the

1650-meter freestyle in 2009. In De
cember, La Tourette set an Ail-
American in the 800-meter freestyle
while at the Dual in the Pool in Eng
land. Mosko holds six All-Americans
in the 200-meter butterfly in 2009,
800-meter freestyle relay in 2008,
500-meter freestyle in 2008 and 2009,
the 1500-meter freestyle in 2009 and
the 1650-meter freestyle in 2008.
This season should be one of suc
cess, starting with a meet against Pa
cific this Saturday, January 9 at 1:00
p.m. at the Avery Aquatic Center.
