# Alarms mean fines
## Several Row houses experience false alarms 
### RYAN MAYFIELD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Unnecessary fire alarm pulls bring a hefty
fine, and a few Row houses have felt the effects
this year: During fall quarter, several houses,
including Sigma Nu and Mars, had alarms pulled,
each of which produced a $5OO fine from
Stanford.
While some alarms are caused by late-night
pranksters, the majority of the problems are
caused by intoxicated partygoers who activate
the alarms. Not only does this cause a fine, but it
also breaks up the party as students are forced to
evacuate.
"It tends to happen at frat parties or parties at
general," said Natasha Chu 'lO, a kitchen manag
er at Kairos House,
Fire crews always respond to these alarms, but
the fines are not handed out through the office of
the University fire marshal. "This is not a policy
of the fire marshal; this is a policy of the housing
department," said Marshal Joseph Leung.
Nate Boswell, associate dean of residential
education and dean of the Row houses, inde
pendent living and Greek life, said the fines are
on par with those given for tampering with fire
extinguishers and sprinkler systems. He said he
was aware of the occurrence of false fire alarm
pulls.
"I do not have hard statistics and would hesi
tate to speculate," Boswell wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "Anecdotally, alarms go off unneces
sarily periodically throughout a given academic
year and more often than not are the result of
human rather than systems error."
In order to avoid further problems, houses are
taking steps to protect their fire alarms. While
some smaller houses do not have to worry about
as many guests, fraternities in particular have had

to increase their vigilance of the alarms.
Sigma Nu has instituted a policy of guarding
its fire alarms during every party. Each resident
chooses a shift, and every alarm is guarded for
the duration of the event.

"For the entire night... we all have shifts, and
we have to leave the party to sit there and guard
it for 45 minutes," said Eric Knudson 'l2, a Sigma

Nu resident.
The policy has been effective, and Sigma Nu
has not had an alarm activation during any of its
parties this year, The one alarm the fraternity
had to deal with was caused instead by a late
night prank. Early in the morning, someone

Row houses such as Sigma Nu and Mars are plagued by false fire alarm pulls and pranks, leading
to increased surveilance at parties in order to prevent hefty $5OO fines from the University.
