# Alarms mean fines
## Several Row houses experience false alarms 
### RYAN MAYFIELD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Unnecessary fire alarm pulls bring a hefty
fine, and a few Row houses have felt the effects
this year: During fall quarter, several houses,
including Sigma Nu and Mars, had alarms pulled,
each of which produced a $5OO fine from
Stanford.
While some alarms are caused by late-night
pranksters, the majority of the problems are
caused by intoxicated partygoers who activate
the alarms. Not only does this cause a fine, but it
also breaks up the party as students are forced to
evacuate.
"It tends to happen at frat parties or parties at
general," said Natasha Chu 'lO, a kitchen manag
er at Kairos House,
Fire crews always respond to these alarms, but
the fines are not handed out through the office of
the University fire marshal. "This is not a policy
of the fire marshal; this is a policy of the housing
department," said Marshal Joseph Leung.
Nate Boswell, associate dean of residential
education and dean of the Row houses, inde
pendent living and Greek life, said the fines are
on par with those given for tampering with fire
extinguishers and sprinkler systems. He said he
was aware of the occurrence of false fire alarm
pulls.
"I do not have hard statistics and would hesi
tate to speculate," Boswell wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "Anecdotally, alarms go off unneces
sarily periodically throughout a given academic
year and more often than not are the result of
human rather than systems error."
In order to avoid further problems, houses are
taking steps to protect their fire alarms. While
some smaller houses do not have to worry about
as many guests, fraternities in particular have had

to increase their vigilance of the alarms.
Sigma Nu has instituted a policy of guarding
its fire alarms during every party. Each resident
chooses a shift, and every alarm is guarded for
the duration of the event.

"For the entire night... we all have shifts, and
we have to leave the party to sit there and guard
it for 45 minutes," said Eric Knudson 'l2, a Sigma

Nu resident.
The policy has been effective, and Sigma Nu
has not had an alarm activation during any of its
parties this year, The one alarm the fraternity
had to deal with was caused instead by a late
night prank. Early in the morning, someone

Row houses such as Sigma Nu and Mars are plagued by false fire alarm pulls and pranks, leading
to increased surveilance at parties in order to prevent hefty $5OO fines from the University.
broke into their house and pulled the
alarm.
"Personally I think it's great when
Stanford gets into its school spirit
with these healthy rivalries I love
that," Knudson said. "But breaking
into a house and pulling an alarm and
making fire fighters come here at two
o'clock in the morning and making us
pay all this money it's not in any
body's interests."
The story at Mars is similar, with
its first fine related to a third-floor
alarm that was pulled during an all
campus party in the early morning
hours. Its second alarm activation
was a break-in through the rear
kitchen door.
"A resident in Columbae saw
what happened," said Matt Sprague
'lO, financial manager for Mars. "He
saw possibly two people dressed in
black walk up to the back door, throw
it open, pull it and sprint away."
The resident reported seeing a
similar event the night of the Sigma
Nu fire alarm activation. Staff mem
bers at Mars have taken steps to per
manently lock the rear door, as well
as enforce stricter policies on the
locking of exterior doors and win
dows.
Particularly at Mars, some were
disappointed that there was not a fur
ther investigation into the pranks in

order to find the person responsible.
Some had hoped that fingerprints
could be taken to find the culprit and
to discover the reason why the alarms
were being activated.
"I don't know what really possess
es people to pull it it's just really
shallow, short reasons ... [lt's] a brief
amount of fun and screws people
over in the long run," said David
Geeter II 'll, a Mars resident.

Although the total of $l,OOO in
fines only accounts for roughly two
percent of the Mars budget, the
alarm incidents mean the house is
spending money that was originally
budgeted for other purposes.
Boswell said a review process is in
place to help houses whose alarms
are pulled, despite those houses' own
prevention efforts.
"The University takes all alarms,
legitimate or not, very seriously,"
Boswell said. "By default, houses
such as Sigma Nu are responsible for
regulating access to their building,
and if an alarm is pulled, regardless of
who pulls it, the house is generally
fined.
"If alarms are repeatedly pulled
and a culprit cannot be identified or
the house has been doing what it is
supposed to keeping doors and
windows locked, monitoring guests,
etc. and someone broke in, then
the house has an opportunity to file a
police report and refute the fine
through Student Housing."
