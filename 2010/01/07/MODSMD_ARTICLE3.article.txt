## Medical School's new V.P. talks fundraising 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Laurel Price Jones became the associate vice
president for medical development and alumni
affairs for the Stanford School of Medicine on Jan.
1. Prior to coming to Stanford, Price Jones served
as the vice president for development and alumni
affairs at George Washington University. She has
worked in the development offices at Rochester

Institute of Technology, the University Hospital of
Cleveland and Oberlin College.
Stanford Daily (SD): What are the differences
between fundraising for general purposes versus
fundraising for a medical school?
Laurel Price Jones (LPJ): You're never really rais
ing money just for general purposes. But medi
cine does have a unique appeal because there's

hardly anyone in the world who isn't affected by
health care issues ... Pretty much, the vast major
ity of people think that medicine is important.
Hence all the attention on health care. That
makes fundraising for medicine an especially sat
isfying thing to do because a wide variety of peo
ple are interested in supporting it for a wide vari
ety of reasons. It's a straightforward appeal to
people's interests.
SD: What are the actual funding
sources for the Stanford School of
Medicine?

LPJ: Well, pretty much the same as
they are for the rest of the
University. Individuals are by far a
large source for any institution, and
usually we include in that founda
tions because foundations are usual
ly set up by individuals ... There are
also corporations, but the vast major
ity of support comes from individu
als.

SD: How is fundraising different now
than it was five years ago, with the
economic downturn?

LPJ: I think there are some signs that
things are turning up. We're certainly

ahead of where we were last year. It
looks like it's going to be a good
year. I think the worst in fundrais
ing terms period was last spring.
So, I don't want to be too predictive
because you never know what is
going to happen, but I think people
are more confident.

SD: What are the main challenges in
raising funds for the School of
Medicine and other institutions that
you have been a part of in the past?

LPJ: There aren't any. [laughs] You
just have to go to work. I don't know
Stanford well enough to say whether
there are particular challenges here,
but in general there are always peo
ple who are philanthropic, who want
to do something beyond what they
can do themselves. I mean that's the
whole point of making a big gift. The
main challenge is to learn from peo
ple what their interests are and
whether they lend themselves to
philanthropic support and then find
a good match at the institution. If
you can do that, then you have a

robust fundraising program. You
don't have to do that with every indi
vidual you meet, just with whom it's
important.

SD: In your fund raising efforts, are
individual donors able to donate to
specific programs versus a multi-pur
pose fund?

LPJ: Of course. That's the reason
they give. Sometimes people will
make loyalty gifts and say, "Use it
wherever you want," but the big gifts
that transform an institution and
Stanford has had many of those over
the years, which is why it is such an
outstanding university are to
endow specific programs. I think if
there is anything that has changed in
the last 10 years or more are people
are more and more interested in
being more involved in their own
giving. People are more directive
now than they were 10 or 15 years
ago.
