# FACULTY & STAFF
## Eight science profs. are elected to AAAS International non-profit selects Stanford leaders 
### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
The American Association for
the Advancement of Science
(AAAS) recently named eight
Stanford scientists as members of
their newest group of fellows.
Stanford's diverse cohort has con
tributed to spheres of science rang
ing from immunology to physics to
gender studies.
The AAAS, an international non
profit dedicated to scientific
advancement in all fields, will honor
Arogyaswami Joseph Paulraj, Ann
Arvin, Karla Kirkegaard, Peter
Sarnow, David Hand Coward,
Michael E. Peskin, Cecilia Ridgeway
and JoAnne L. Hewett in a ceremo
ny on Feb. 20 in San Diego.

"I am pleased not only for
myself, but also to see a number of
fellowships being awarded this year
in elementary particle physics," said
Peskin, a particle physics and astro
physics professor at SLAC. He
attributes his award to work he com
pleted in the 19905, which improved
understanding of weak particle
interactions and codified constraints
on models of physics at higher ener
gies.
Arvin, Kirkegaard and Sarnow,
all professors of microbiology and
immunology, have each contributed
valuable efforts towards cellular
research. Arvin, currently vice
provost and dean of research, has
conducted molecular research on
several viruses and vaccine immuni
ty that garnered her the attention
for the fellowship. Kirkegaard's
research on polio, hepatitis C and
RNA viruses enhanced the possibil
ity of preventing these viruses from
developing drug resistance. Sarnow
also focused on polio and hepatitis
C, examining cellular and viral
translation.

Hewett, a professor at SLAC
along with Peskin, focuses her work
on theoretical particle physics.
Coward's help on experiments that
illuminated the quark structure of
the proton and neutron called him
to AAAS attention, even several
years after his retirement.
"Coward played an important
role in many of the original SLAC
experiments," Peskin said. "His con
tributions were deep ... but they
did not get much public recognition.
I couldn't tell you how his name
came to the top now ... but it is
very appropriate and pleasing to me
that he is recognized in this way."
Ridgeway is the only new
Stanford fellow whose work steps
outside of the hard science category.
A social science professor in the
sociology department, Ridgeway's
interests lie in gender and social
hierarchies. The AAAS honored her
as one of its few fellows in the
Section on Social, Economic and
Political Sciences for her work in
gender inequality and the role of
gender in social organizations.
All are new members of the

AAAS with varying degrees of con
nection to the organization,
although few truly understand how
the fellowship selection process
took place.
"Frankly, I don't know how they
make the decisions," Ridgeway said.
"The process is opaque to me,"
added Peskin,
The Section on Biological
Sciences saw the most new fellows
this year, while Dentistry and Oral
Health Sciences gained only one.
The AAAS, founded in 1848, lists 94
total fellows from Stanford. The
AAAS will award the new Fellows
with a certificate and a blue and
gold rosette during next month's
ceremony.
