### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
The American Association for
the Advancement of Science
(AAAS) recently named eight
Stanford scientists as members of
their newest group of fellows.
Stanford's diverse cohort has con
tributed to spheres of science rang
ing from immunology to physics to
gender studies.
The AAAS, an international non
profit dedicated to scientific
advancement in all fields, will honor
Arogyaswami Joseph Paulraj, Ann
Arvin, Karla Kirkegaard, Peter
Sarnow, David Hand Coward,
Michael E. Peskin, Cecilia Ridgeway
and JoAnne L. Hewett in a ceremo
ny on Feb. 20 in San Diego.

"I am pleased not only for
myself, but also to see a number of
fellowships being awarded this year
in elementary particle physics," said
Peskin, a particle physics and astro
physics professor at SLAC. He
attributes his award to work he com
pleted in the 19905, which improved
understanding of weak particle
interactions and codified constraints
on models of physics at higher ener
gies.
Arvin, Kirkegaard and Sarnow,
all professors of microbiology and
immunology, have each contributed
valuable efforts towards cellular
research. Arvin, currently vice
provost and dean of research, has
conducted molecular research on
several viruses and vaccine immuni
ty that garnered her the attention
for the fellowship. Kirkegaard's
research on polio, hepatitis C and
RNA viruses enhanced the possibil
