# STUDENT GROUPS
## C.S. team qualifies for World Finals in China Programming team is one of 19 to compete 
### CAROLINE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three Stanford students will be
traveling to Harbin, China this
February to compete in the World
Finals of the Association for
Computing Machinery International
Collegiate Programming Contest, an
annual competition sponsored by
IBM.
Jaehyun Park 'l2, Jeffrey Wang
'lO and first-year computer science
graduate student Philipp
Krahenbuhl will be competing
against more than a hundred teams
in a five-hour problem-solving and
programming race.
Teams in the contest receive one
computer and have eight or nine
problems to solve. The problems
often have real-life analogies, such
as writing a program to find the
shortest path from one city to anoth
er, similar to calculations done by
GPS systems. Park recalled a prob
lem from a previous contest in
which a rectangular window had
shattered and teams were asked to

write a program that would rotate
the pieces and reassemble the win
dow. Last year's finals also asked
teams to write a program that would
coordinate incoming flights at an
airport.
Park, Wang and Krahenbuhl
have been preparing for the contest
for months. They were first selected
from Stanford's local contest to
compete in the Pacific Northwest
Regional Preliminaries in
November, where they came in sec
ond, qualifying for the finals along
with 18 other teams in the United
States.

Since then, they have been prac
ticing together every weekend,
coached by computer science gradu
ate students, including many who
are former participants of the con
test.
"We do one practice contest a
week," Wang said. "Yes, that's five
hours."
Though the practice hours are
grueling, the team is confident in
their ability to work together in
competition.
"I think we work together really
well," Park said. "We communicate
well with each other."
This is Park's second year par
ticipating in the contest and Wang's
third. Both competed in similar
contests during high school and
have extensive experience in pro
gramming under pressure.
(Krahenbuhl could not be contact-

Ed due to travel.)
Park cautioned that the team's
experience alone was not enough to
win the competition.
"It's not only about knowledge,"
he said, "it's about creativity." Wang
echoed Park's description of the
competition, saying, "It is a pro
gramming contest, but at the heart
of it, it's really problem-solving."
Despite the pressure and intensi
ty of the contest, Park said that he
finds the contests a lot of fun. He
explained that solutions are
checked instantly upon submission
so the team will know whether to
move on to the next problem or
keep working on a program that has
been rejected. "But when your pro
gram is accepted," he said, "I can't
explain ... it's so exciting!"
This year the World Finals will be
hosted by Harbin Engineering
University, which has prepared sev
eral sightseeing events for the com
petitors.
"There's an ice sculpture festival
going on, which should be a lot of
fun," Wang said.

However, the focus of their week
in Harbin will be the contest itself,
where Stanford's team will be facing
stiff and diverse competition. Over
one hundred teams come from all
over the world, including teams
from Buenos Aires, Cape Town,
Hong Kong, Moscow and Tokyo.
According to Wang, the Russian and
Chinese schools are usually the
fiercest competition, though MIT
always sends a strong team as well.
Despite the stiff competition,
Stanford is one of two universities,
besides the St. Petersburg Institute
of Fine Mechanics and Optics, that
have won the World Finals three
times in 1985,1987 and 1991.
Stanford finished 20th last year,
but this year the team is determined
to raise the bar. 12 medals are
awarded at the contest four each
of gold, silver and bronze.
"We want to do a bit better than
last year," Park said. "We're aiming
to get a medal."
