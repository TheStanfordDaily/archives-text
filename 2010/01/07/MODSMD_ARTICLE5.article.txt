## C.S. team qualifies for World Finals in China Programming team is one of 19 to compete 
### CAROLINE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three Stanford students will be
traveling to Harbin, China this
February to compete in the World
Finals of the Association for
Computing Machinery International
Collegiate Programming Contest, an
annual competition sponsored by
IBM.
Jaehyun Park 'l2, Jeffrey Wang
'lO and first-year computer science
graduate student Philipp
Krahenbuhl will be competing
against more than a hundred teams
in a five-hour problem-solving and
programming race.
Teams in the contest receive one
computer and have eight or nine
problems to solve. The problems
often have real-life analogies, such
as writing a program to find the
shortest path from one city to anoth
er, similar to calculations done by
GPS systems. Park recalled a prob
lem from a previous contest in
which a rectangular window had
shattered and teams were asked to

write a program that would rotate
the pieces and reassemble the win
dow. Last year's finals also asked
teams to write a program that would
coordinate incoming flights at an
airport.
Park, Wang and Krahenbuhl
have been preparing for the contest
for months. They were first selected
from Stanford's local contest to
compete in the Pacific Northwest
Regional Preliminaries in
November, where they came in sec
ond, qualifying for the finals along
with 18 other teams in the United
States.
