## GSC critiques constitution policy First GSC meeting of the year brings in debate 
### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The first Graduate Student
Council (GSC) meeting of the new
year kicked off Wednesday night with
discussion of the Undergraduate
Senate's failure to confirm Farah
Abuzeid 'lO as ASSU co-joint chief of
staff. Abuzeid was approved unani
mously by the GSC in November, and
last night's announcement led to a cri
tique of the lack of appointment
process literature in the constitution.
Continuing with ASSU updates,

Vice President Andy Parker 'll
reported that Old Union room reser
vations, previously completed via
scheduling on door calendars outside
rooms, and the ASSU book exchange
will now be available online (at
assu.stanford.edu/oldunion.) ASSU
President David Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO
said 450 students have used it so far to
make 600 reservations.
The meeting concluded with new
goals for this year on the GSC agenda
in various aspects of student life, such
as housing and health care, and listing
the necessary accomplishments for
each.

Appointments in the Constitution
Discussion arose as Andy Parker
'll announced that Farah Abuzeid 'lO

had not been confirmed as ASSU co
joint chief of staff in the
Undergraduate Senate. The Senate
voted 8-5 in favor of Abuzeid; howev
er, because she failed to receive two
thirds of the votes, she was not con
firmed.
GSC members were surprised at
the news as Parker went on to explain
that he will retain his duties as co-chief
of staff while in his new position.
"I'm sorry, but that sucks," said
Chief Financial Officer Ryan
Peacock, fourth-year graduate student
in chemical engineering. "For the
record.
"We don't want to discourage par
ticipation in the ASSU," Peacock
