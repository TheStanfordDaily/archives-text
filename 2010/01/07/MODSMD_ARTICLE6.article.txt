## GSC critiques constitution policy First GSC meeting of the year brings in debate 
### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The first Graduate Student
Council (GSC) meeting of the new
year kicked off Wednesday night with
discussion of the Undergraduate
Senate's failure to confirm Farah
Abuzeid 'lO as ASSU co-joint chief of
staff. Abuzeid was approved unani
mously by the GSC in November, and
last night's announcement led to a cri
tique of the lack of appointment
process literature in the constitution.
Continuing with ASSU updates,

Vice President Andy Parker 'll
reported that Old Union room reser
vations, previously completed via
scheduling on door calendars outside
rooms, and the ASSU book exchange
will now be available online (at
assu.stanford.edu/oldunion.) ASSU
President David Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO
said 450 students have used it so far to
make 600 reservations.
The meeting concluded with new
goals for this year on the GSC agenda
in various aspects of student life, such
as housing and health care, and listing
the necessary accomplishments for
each.

Appointments in the Constitution
Discussion arose as Andy Parker
'll announced that Farah Abuzeid 'lO

had not been confirmed as ASSU co
joint chief of staff in the
Undergraduate Senate. The Senate
voted 8-5 in favor of Abuzeid; howev
er, because she failed to receive two
thirds of the votes, she was not con
firmed.
GSC members were surprised at
the news as Parker went on to explain
that he will retain his duties as co-chief
of staff while in his new position.
"I'm sorry, but that sucks," said
Chief Financial Officer Ryan
Peacock, fourth-year graduate student
in chemical engineering. "For the
record.
"We don't want to discourage par
ticipation in the ASSU," Peacock

Approved unanimously by the GSC, Farah Abuzeid '10 was not confirmed by the Undergraduate Senate as ASSU
co-joint chief of staff, launching the graduate council into a discussion on Wednesday of the appointment process.
added. "We want to make it open."
Concerns were raised about the
ambiguity of the constitution regard
ing cabinet appointments. According
to Robert Hennessy, a fifth-year stu
dent in electrical engineering, it takes
two-thirds of the Undergraduate Sen
ate to remove a person from the cabi
net, but there are no details regarding
the appointment process.
GSC members considered the
possibility of asking the constitution
al council to rule on whether an ap
pointee needs two-thirds vote for
confirmation or a simple majority.
Others just wanted the rule set firmly
in preparation for possible future oc
casions.
"We should either put it in the
joint bylaws or propose a constitu
tional amendment so that appoint
ment laws are clear," Hennessy said.
The GSC previously confirmed
Abuzeid unanimously at its Nov. 18
meeting.
"I think the whole thing is absurd,"
said GSC Co-Chair Eric Osborne.
"Those who voted no in the Under
graduate Senate didn't have a reason
to do so. A qualified person like Farah
[Abuzeid] should at least get the rea
sons for why they were voted
against."
New Confirmations
The GSC confirmed three people
as new Undergraduate Senate chairs.

Jen Hawkins'll was confirmed as co
chair of Undergraduate Health and
Wellness.
"The workload was getting a little
heavy for the chair," Parker ex
plained. "We wanted to put a little
more emphasis on mental health."
Gobaud said that Alisha Tolani
'lO, the current chair of health and
wellness, will now be focusing on the
executive's ongoing campaign to re
duce sexual assault and relationship
abuse, while Hawkins will be focusing
on mental health.
"We wanted to make sure both is
sues would receive the attention they
deserve," Gobaud said.
Cisco Riordan 'lO and Vincent
Chen 'l2 were confirmed as co-chairs
of marketing and HCI.
"They will be working on online
marketing, especially in Web site de
sign, e-fliers and social networking
sites like Facebook and Twitter,"
Gobaud said. "They will work with
every member of the team to create
electronic marketing material."
GSC Resolutions for the New Year
The GSC also recommitted them
selves to previously proposed goals
heading into the new year.
Nanna Notthoff, a second-year
graduate student in psychology, said
the GSC has compiled all possible
goals to pursue and steps needed in
order to accomplish them. "We will be
figuring out what is most important to
accomplish before winter quarter
ends and elections come again," she
said.

Committees will be formed to fol
low the steps proposed to accomplish

the goals.
Items on the GSC winter quarter
agenda include GSC operations
awareness, health care, housing, din
ing and related issues, parking and
transportation, "academics and be
yond" and sociaiyprogramming.
Pertaining to operations, the GSC
will seek a humanities representative,
present a clear breakdown of GSC
funding to the public and clean up the
funding Web site.
For health care, the GSC plans to
educate students about various
Vaden resources. "Grad students
don't know much about health pro
motion services," Notthoff said.
In housing and dining, the GSC
will be working to improve housing
options, lower housing rates and pro
vide cheaper options in places like the
Market at Munger.
As for parking and transportation,
the GSC will pursue more parking
options for off-campus students.
"We want to survey to see if there
can be more room for off-campus stu
dents to park so that they would be
more encouraged to come to this
building," Notthoff said of the Gradu
ate Community Center.

Notthoff also said there will be
more social programming for the off
campus community and professional
development workshops to advertise
jobs for life after Stanford.
Notthoff was optimistic about ac
complishing the goals she named.
"We used to make a long list of goals,"
she said. "But that was really abstract.
That's why we've decided to make
small steps to accomplish them. That
way, we would really make some

progress."
A $2,000 funding request for
Graduate Family Events to take place
winter quarter was approved, and
$4OO was also requested to provide in
centives for students to take a survey
on the graduate budget. The Black
Graduate Student Association also
received funding allocations for an
event.
It was announced that $2,205 was
left in general discretionary funds.

ate Community Center.

Notthoff also said there will be
more social programming for the off
campus community and professional
development workshops to advertise
jobs for life after Stanford.
Notthoff was optimistic about ac
complishing the goals she named.
"We used to make a long list of goals,"
she said. "But that was really abstract.
That's why we've decided to make
small steps to accomplish them. That
way, we would really make some

progress."
A $2,000 funding request for
Graduate Family Events to take place
winter quarter was approved, and
$4OO was also requested to provide in
centives for students to take a survey
on the graduate budget. The Black
Graduate Student Association also
received funding allocations for an
event.
It was announced that $2,205 was
left in general discretionary funds.

The first Graduate Student
Council (GSC) meeting of the new
year kicked off Wednesday night with
discussion of the Undergraduate
Senate's failure to confirm Farah
Abuzeid 'lO as ASSU co-joint chief of
staff. Abuzeid was approved unani
mously by the GSC in November, and
last night's announcement led to a cri
tique of the lack of appointment
process literature in the constitution.
Continuing with ASSU updates,

Vice President Andy Parker 'll
reported that Old Union room reser
vations, previously completed via
scheduling on door calendars outside
rooms, and the ASSU book exchange
will now be available online (at
assu.stanford.edu/oldunion.) ASSU
President David Gobaud 'OB, M.S. 'lO
said 450 students have used it so far to
make 600 reservations.
The meeting concluded with new
goals for this year on the GSC agenda
in various aspects of student life, such
as housing and health care, and listing
the necessary accomplishments for
each.

Appointments in the Constitution
Discussion arose as Andy Parker
'll announced that Farah Abuzeid 'lO

had not been confirmed as ASSU co
joint chief of staff in the
Undergraduate Senate. The Senate
voted 8-5 in favor of Abuzeid; howev
er, because she failed to receive two
thirds of the votes, she was not con
firmed.
GSC members were surprised at
the news as Parker went on to explain
that he will retain his duties as co-chief
of staff while in his new position.
"I'm sorry, but that sucks," said
Chief Financial Officer Ryan
Peacock, fourth-year graduate student
in chemical engineering. "For the
record.
"We don't want to discourage par
ticipation in the ASSU," Peacock

Approved unanimously by the GSC, Farah Abuzeid '10 was not confirmed by the Undergraduate Senate as ASSU
co-joint chief of staff, launching the graduate council into a discussion on Wednesday of the appointment process.
added. "We want to make it open."
Concerns were raised about the
ambiguity of the constitution regard
ing cabinet appointments. According
to Robert Hennessy, a fifth-year stu
dent in electrical engineering, it takes
two-thirds of the Undergraduate Sen
ate to remove a person from the cabi
net, but there are no details regarding
the appointment process.
GSC members considered the
possibility of asking the constitution
al council to rule on whether an ap
pointee needs two-thirds vote for
confirmation or a simple majority.
Others just wanted the rule set firmly
in preparation for possible future oc
casions.
"We should either put it in the
joint bylaws or propose a constitu
tional amendment so that appoint
ment laws are clear," Hennessy said.
The GSC previously confirmed
Abuzeid unanimously at its Nov. 18
meeting.
"I think the whole thing is absurd,"
said GSC Co-Chair Eric Osborne.
"Those who voted no in the Under
graduate Senate didn't have a reason
to do so. A qualified person like Farah
[Abuzeid] should at least get the rea
sons for why they were voted
against."
New Confirmations
The GSC confirmed three people
as new Undergraduate Senate chairs.

Jen Hawkins'll was confirmed as co
chair of Undergraduate Health and
Wellness.
"The workload was getting a little
heavy for the chair," Parker ex
plained. "We wanted to put a little
more emphasis on mental health."
Gobaud said that Alisha Tolani
'lO, the current chair of health and
wellness, will now be focusing on the
executive's ongoing campaign to re
duce sexual assault and relationship
abuse, while Hawkins will be focusing
on mental health.
"We wanted to make sure both is
sues would receive the attention they
deserve," Gobaud said.
Cisco Riordan 'lO and Vincent
Chen 'l2 were confirmed as co-chairs
of marketing and HCI.
"They will be working on online
marketing, especially in Web site de
sign, e-fliers and social networking
sites like Facebook and Twitter,"
Gobaud said. "They will work with
every member of the team to create
electronic marketing material."
GSC Resolutions for the New Year
The GSC also recommitted them
selves to previously proposed goals
heading into the new year.
Nanna Notthoff, a second-year
graduate student in psychology, said
the GSC has compiled all possible
goals to pursue and steps needed in
order to accomplish them. "We will be
figuring out what is most important to
accomplish before winter quarter
ends and elections come again," she
said.

Committees will be formed to fol
low the steps proposed to accomplish

the goals.
Items on the GSC winter quarter
agenda include GSC operations
awareness, health care, housing, din
ing and related issues, parking and
transportation, "academics and be
yond" and sociaiyprogramming.
Pertaining to operations, the GSC
will seek a humanities representative,
present a clear breakdown of GSC
funding to the public and clean up the
funding Web site.
For health care, the GSC plans to
educate students about various
Vaden resources. "Grad students
don't know much about health pro
motion services," Notthoff said.
In housing and dining, the GSC
will be working to improve housing
options, lower housing rates and pro
vide cheaper options in places like the
Market at Munger.
As for parking and transportation,
the GSC will pursue more parking
options for off-campus students.
"We want to survey to see if there
can be more room for off-campus stu
dents to park so that they would be
more encouraged to come to this
building," Notthoff said of the Gradu
ate Community Center.

Notthoff also said there will be
more social programming for the off
campus community and professional
development workshops to advertise
jobs for life after Stanford.
Notthoff was optimistic about ac
complishing the goals she named.
"We used to make a long list of goals,"
she said. "But that was really abstract.
That's why we've decided to make
small steps to accomplish them. That
way, we would really make some

progress."
A $2,000 funding request for
Graduate Family Events to take place
winter quarter was approved, and
$4OO was also requested to provide in
centives for students to take a survey
on the graduate budget. The Black
Graduate Student Association also
received funding allocations for an
event.
It was announced that $2,205 was
left in general discretionary funds.
