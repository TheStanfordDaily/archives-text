## THE
						GOOD DEATH PART 2 IN A SERIES OF 2 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR Part one ran in yesterday's issue of The Daily 
cc ""W~as everyone been to the
I I bedside of someone who's
I dying?" asked Judy, a clini
-A_ -A- cal care nurse.
Eight new volunteers responded, thrust
ing their hands into the cold air of Room
HO 147.
On a cold and rainy Monday night in
October, these eight hopefuls convened in
a converted break room in Stanford
Hospital's basement for a new volunteer
orientation session for No One Dies Alone.
Some had driven from work straight to the
meeting, while others only had to make the
short trip down the elevator from their jobs
upstairs. They all listened intently to the
revolving presentations of hospital chap
lains and program organizers.
One by one, chaplains and nurses gave
short talks, each speaker ending with a pro
fuse outcry of thank yous directed at the
hopefuls. After all, it was death they would
be dealing with.
Among the new volunteers was David
Bowman, a 70-year-old retiree with wispy
white hair and an accompanying white
beard. An ordained minister of 40 years
with the United Church of Christ, Bowman
had given his fair share of last rites. Still he
jotted down every bit of advice from the
chaplains.
"A dying person's body temperature
will get cooler, so you will need to feel for a
pulse." Quick scribbles of a pen.
"Wet their mouths with a small sponge if
you see that their lips are dry or chapped."
Noted.
"You're never alone in this process."
Word for word.
Across from Bowman was Jim Chan, 49,
a single father who had come straight from
his 9 to 5 at Sun Microsystems where he
worked as a lead engineer. Jim regularly
volunteered in the hospital's E.R., working
the Saturday shift from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m.
every week.
Bill Strewby sat in a chair separated
from the table, a self-inflicted punishment
for arriving late.
"I asked like four people and none of
them knew where this place was," he said.
With a handlebar moustache and a pur
ple and green windbreaker, he listened for
40 minutes before his restlessness suc
cumbed to a bout of doodling on his volun
teer worksheets. By meeting's end, he had
created his fair share of hieroglyphics
yin-yangs, stars and hearts.
It was a quiet group, according to
Allison, a social worker who gave the first
presentation. The room was often filled
with awkward silence, broken only by
Strewby's crunching of trail mix, as presen
ters waited for questions. Surely, not every
one could be that confident in dealing with
death.
Allison continued anyway, discussing
the importance of the volunteers' mental
health, because in this business, "you can't
take care of someone until you can take
care of yourself." Yet, she struggled to find
words to explain the need for distance
between what's inside the hospital walls
and what's outside. They had to realize the
sensitivity and intensity of the matters they
would deal with. She hazily explained the
program's support system for affected vol
unteers and waited for questions, which
never came.
"I know that these things are nebulous,"
she said. "It's hard to recognize when these
things are going to be relevant."
Yet, in discussing the responsibilities of
the program, Allison became resolute and
clear: volunteers should not and could not
take on grief because of their experiences.
While their job required compassion, vol
unteers were expected to stem their emo
tions once they stepped out of the hospital
room.
"The key is recognizing that you have a
role in this end process and that your role is
pretty confined," Allison said. "You haven't
caused their death or their lack of family.
These are problems that you can't own."
But for David Bowman, something was
n't right. How could he be expected to
show concern for a dying person, then for
get about that person when he left the bed
side or as soon as the person died? And
what about the families who wanted to
know more?
"What if a family that was around didn't
want to let the caregiver go?" he asked.
Susan Scott explained that neither the
volunteers' phone numbers nor their full
names would be given out to relatives. No
volunteer would be expected or encour
aged to maintain ties to the family of the
deceased. The program was about care
within a strict standard protocol.
"You are scheduled for a shift," Scott

told them, "and when that shift ends, you
have to leave."

Susan Scott had her reasons for the
strict volunteer-patient relationship. She's
based her whole career on staying within
the boundaries, and as decedent care chap
lain, it's the only way she can withstand the
40-hour workweek. In her current position
at the hospital, Scott handles all death cer
tificates, which average two or three a day.
She talks with families whose relatives have
died or are dying, and can refer them to the
funeral home that's best suited for their
needs.
A self-described introvert, she is quiet
but firm. She wears a charm on her neck
lace that reads, "Live With Grace." Susan
believes that her profession is one meant to
provide comfort within a certain reality,
describing it almost as a placeholder for
grief. "I think you need a certain amount of
patience with people and compassion for
people," she said. "And I think part of what
I do is hold it for a while for people. I don't
ever try to say, 'lt's going to be O.K.' But I
try to be with them ... until they can kind
of gather their resources and take care of
themselves."
After 23 years of being a reverend, she's
learned that she's not there to keep their
grief. It's an understanding that she empha
sizes every time a new volunteer joins No
One Dies Alone, and the restrictions have
been put in place as a constant reminder. For
Scott, it's the only way humans could have
any chance of handling death, something she
has learned from her own experiences.

It was 1993 and Susan Scott had only been
on the job a few months at Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital, when she was summoned
to the neonatal intensive care unit to perform
a baptism. Weaving her way through the
buzzing incubators of the sterile ICU, she
arrived to find a baby boy only a few weeks
old, still lying on the operating table wired to
a ventilator. Doctors rushed back and forth
monitoring the baby's vital signs and examin
ing the aftermath of heart surgery.
"If you're going to baptize this baby,
you're going to have to do it right away," a
nurse whispered.
Gathering herself between the whir of
the machines and the newborn's labored
breathing, she glanced around the window
less room as the parents and grandparents
stood silently around the surgery table. She
was Lutheran and

they were Roman
Catholic, and the
service would be in
English, not their
native Spanish. But
it didn't matter.
This was an emer
gency, and any
ordained Christian
minister could per
form the rite.
Opening her Bible,
she began the
Lord's Prayer:
"Our father who
art in heaven, hal
lowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom
come, thy will be
done..."
As family, nurs
es and doctors
recited the prayer,
the reverend con
cluded with the
ceremonial dash of
water upon the
baby's forehead.
He died minutes
later.

Scott retreated to a private hospital
room with the family. The nurses brought in
the baby's body, clothed and wrapped in
blankets. Picking up the baby from its bas
ket, the mother wept; she passed the body
to the grandmother, who began to cry as
well. Unable to bear the sight, the family
placed the baby back in the basket. Susan
looked on, unable to comprehend the
Spanish between the sobs, and was caught
up in her own thoughts as she focused on
the baby's face. And in that moment, she
was no longer in the room.
It was 1959, and she was a 9-year-old girl
at a funeral home in Delaware. Her broth
er Michael had died before she had ever
known him. He was seven months old.
Viewing the body in its casket only five
feet away, Susan clung to her grandmother
as she listened to the priest's service. She
could only understand the basics. She knew
that her brother had been born with dys
functional intestines while her family was
living on a U.S. Army base in Rome. Her
father, a sergeant, had spent the greater
part of the year shuttling Michael and her
mother back and forth from the hospital,

sometimes having to fly to stations in
Germany to find better doctors and treat
ment.
The oldest of four children, Susan had
seen little of her baby brother and had
often talked to a nun at her Catholic school
about her troubles at home. There wasn't
much else she could do.
With Michael's condition deteriorating,
her parents decided it would be best that
the family return to the States. Boarding a
military plane with her father and the rest
of her siblings, she arrived earlier than her
mother and brother's flight, and waited
anxiously for their plane to land.
Her brother never made it. He died over
the Atlantic.
Looking back, Susan often tells this
flashback to new volunteers of No One
Dies Alone to explain how the smallest
things can trigger the memories of death or
traumatic experiences. She tells her volun
teers that death isn't something that should
be dwelled upon, but rather part of the
process of life. In her line of work, it's the
only way to find closure.
Yet, in those long nights sitting next to
the bedsides of her patients, she cannot
help but think about Michael.
"For me, it's also about accepting that

death is a reality in life," she said.
"Sometimes, when I'm sitting with some
one and they're very quiet and I'm sort of
in my own thoughts as I watch them, I will
think about that someday when I will be
the one in the bed."

It takes time for people to realize that
death is just a part of life. Some people
never come to this understanding. Others
simply don't want to. For Susan Scott, who
has lost count of the number of sick and
dying she's sat with, it's what has allowed
her to shoulder the burden that comes with
being at the hospital day after day of sign
ing death certificates.
She's hoped to establish this under
standing with her volunteers, but it has
never been that easy. Susan's volunteers
are normal people with normal jobs, who
have dedicated two hours of their time to
deal with something that defines her pro
fession.

Heida's attempts to reach this under
standing are founded on her belief that
death is just a transition. As a Catholic, she

doesn't view death as an end, and that's
what's allowed her to step into the hospital
room when she gets the call.
"It would be nice to think that you have
loved ones waiting for you and a lot of peo
ple do believe that," she said. "You will fre
quently hear people say 'I get to go see
Mom and Dad again. I'll be with my broth
er again.'"
There is a fine line in handling religious
matters in No One Dies Alone. The pro
gram prides itself on being non-religious
and non-proselytizing, and its patients
come from many different faiths.
Volunteers are constantly advised to avoid
religious conversation, unless prompted by
the patient, and to defer any religious ques
tions to the overseeing chaplains.
But religion still plays a large part in the
lives of those involved. Susan Scott is not
only the decedent care chaplain, but also a
Lutheran reverend and handles patients
for spiritual care specific to that faith. For
Heida and Penny Barrett, religion has pro
vided a means of processing their individ
ual experiences in the program.
Heida frequently referred to her involve
ment with the program as "a calling," spurred
on by her Catholicism and the memory of her
father's death. Penny, a Christian Scientist,

maintained that
religion helped
define her percep
tion of patients.
"From a doctor's
perspective, yes,
they are sick," she
explained. "But
from my perspec
tive, it's a hospital
filled with God's
children, and I view
that as my job to
make sure that I
maintain that. I
don't think I could
have done this for
eight years if I
viewed them as sick,
broken people."
Not everyone
can step into that
hospital room.
Even fewer can
step out, accept
what they've expe
rienced and move
on. It all comes
down to the per
ception of death.

While Heida has sat
with four different patients in No One Dies
Alone, she hasn't yet fully made the connec
tion that death is just a process of life. But
every time she steps in the room, she's get
ting a little closer to this realization. And it's
her religion that's helping get her there.
"For me, to think that this is it," she said.
"It's too unbearable ... I think a lot of peo
ple, especially people of faith, spend their
whole lives preparing themselves and
behaving in ways so that there is something
more."
Do you think there is something there
after death?
"I hope so; that would be wonderful."

Today, the No One Dies Alone Program
has 70 active volunteers. Yet, there have
been even more who signed up and attend
ed the volunteer orientation sessions,
before realizing that it's just not for them.
"No, not everyone can become a volun
teer," said Sandra Clarke. "Everyone has to
find their level of comfort. Volunteers want
ed to get involved, but they couldn't do it."
Jim Chan still has yet to sign up for a

shift, citing a lack of time and some com
munication problems. Jim Bowman, on
the other hand, couldn't come to terms
with the religious restrictions put on vol
unteers. "The program is run by a chap
laincy, but it's a very secular program," he
said. "I can't even go in and say, 'My name
is David Bowman, and I'm here to be with
you,' and I can't say I'm a retired cler
gyperson, and I can't introduce myself as a
minister.
"I wouldn't want to impose, but I would
like to be freer to use my own good judg
ment," he added. "I want to emphasize that
I think it's a good program it's just not
my cup of tea."
Of course, many volunteers have stayed.
Penny has had a lifetime of volunteering,
and despite initial doubts about the pro
gram, she has cherished every session with
patients. Heida, motivated by her own per
sonal experience on her first shift with
Peter Pan Lady, sees herself doing this for a
very, very long time.

Heida dug around for the prayer book
in her pre-packed program bag with one
eye on Peter Pan Lady. With the harp play
er gone, she needed something appropriate
to read to her patient. Locating the book at
the bottom of the bag, she picked it up and
began thumbing through it for Old
Testament prayers. "Stick to the Psalms,"
she was advised by the previous shift's vol
unteer. "She's Jewish."
As 5 o'clock rolled around, she contin
ued to read from the book, picking and
choosing small passages. With the next vol
unteer, Repeka lemeria, waiting outside,
Heida finished Psalm 73 and bid Peter Pan
Lady a warm farewell.
But she didn't leave immediately. She
helped get Repeka settled, explaining what
could be read, what music should be
played and how best to comfort the
patient. Yet, looking back at Peter Pan
Lady, she noticed something was different:
The woman's chest no longer rose as when
she was softly breathing. "You know what
," Heida said, "I don't think she's alive
anymore."
Heida quickly retrieved a doctor and
waited with Repeka as he searched for a
heartbeat. When the doctor was sure, he
turned to the women and looked at them
sternly. "She's not here anymore," he said.
Despite the preparation and the knowl
edge that these people would die, Peter Pan
Lady's death still came as a shock to Heida.
No training could completely shield her
from the emotions of death. "It was disbe
lief, I think, because in my head, I had com
mitted to being a part of the program for a
long time," she said reflecting on the expe
rience. "I knew eventually that I would be
with someone that would die. But I did not
expect it to happen the first time."
Leaving the hospital room with tears in
her eyes, Heida made the long walk down
to the hospital basement and the Spiritual
Care Offices. Fittingly, in those moments
after the death, Heida was never alone,
accompanied by Repeka as she cried and
held prayers. But these weren't tears of sad
ness or grief.
This program is Heida's calling, and she
believes that she'll be there for many other
dying patients as they close their eyes for
the last time. Hopefully those experiences
will be as moving as her first.
"It was beautiful," she said. "Everything
went right."
