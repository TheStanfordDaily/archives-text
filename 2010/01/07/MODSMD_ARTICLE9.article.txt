## Anti-dog fighting group partners with Farm 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Elizabeth Rosen contributed to this report 
What do geophysics and space sci
ences have to do with dog fighting
and gang activity? Not much at first
glance. Nevertheless, Stanford Solar
Center director Deborah Scherrer
has become an active part of the cam
paign against dog fighting and animal
abuse in the Bay Area.
The Stanford Solar Center recent
ly formed an unusual alliance with
Knock Out Dog Fighting (KODF), a
program that works with juvenile
detention facilities, alternative
schools, community centers, law
enforcement and gang prevention
groups to stop animal cruelty and
abuse by engaging at-risk youth in
alternative activities. KODF was cre
ated out of the pit bull advocacy
group For Pits' Sake (FPS), a non
profit organization founded in 1997
by Bay Area local Kris Crawford.
The most recent addition to
KODF's repertoire of programs is
Fun Science, run by Scherrer, a long
time pit bull owner and rescuer.
Scherrer and Crawford began col
laborating on Fun Science in June of
2009 and it has since become an inte
gral component of KODF. The pro-

gram includes a number of hands-on
activities intended to educate chil
dren about scientific processes in an
engaging and positive way. Activities
have included bottle rockets, dry ice
and sublimation and to-scale models
of the solar system.
According to Scherrer, one of the
largest problems with the education
of at-risk youth has little to do with
the students' learning abilities.
Rather, in an educational system
dominated by lectures and presenta
tions, material is rarely presented in
an engaging or motivational way.
"Many of the kids we've worked
with are very bright. They'll come up
to me and tell me that they've heard
of string theory, alternate universes
and whatnot. It's incredible," Scherrer
said.
In December, KODF was featured
as part of the Stanford Solar Center's
exhibit at the 2009 American
Geophysical Union conference in San
Francisco, in the Education and Public
Outreach section. Attendance was
over 16,000 and Scherrer said she feels
the project was very well received.
"We help [these kids] learn to
make decisions based on discovery,
analysis and understanding," Scherrer
said. "These are exactly the skills need
ed for them to move from inappropri
ate, emotion-driven behavior toward
better, more productive choices."
