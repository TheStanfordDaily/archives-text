## Report Fewer fraud suits filed in 2009 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
Popular anger against deceit and
fraud in company stocks and finances
may have temporarily exhausted the
possibilities for legal targets, according
to Stanford researchers.
A report released by the Stanford
Law School Securities Class Action
Clearinghouse this week announced
that shareholders filed fewer securities
class action lawsuits in 2009 than in
previous years. Last year, 169 federal
security class action lawsuits were filed,
down 24 percent from the 223 suits
filed in 2008.
Federal class action security law
suits tracked by the Clearinghouse usu
ally involve a group of plaintiffs who
claim that a company has fraudulently
caused for the inflation of stock prices.
The sharpest decline was in lawsuits
against the financial services industry,
according to the annual report pub
lished by the Law School and
Cornerstone Research. The report also
found a decrease of 47 percent in law
suits relating to the credit crisis from
100 in 2008 to 53 in 2009. Of these 53,
only 17 litigations were filed in the sec
ond half of the year.
"Every major financial services
company has already been sued,"
explained Joseph Grundfest, director
of the Stanford Law School Securities
Class Action Clearinghouse. "That
pool is fished out."
Grundfest added that only one class
action can be filed for each alleged
wrongdoing, and so most of the litiga
tion arising from the financial crisis has
already been filed.
The total maximum dollar loss, a
measurement of shareholder losses
experienced during the class period,

fell by 24 percent to $634 billion. The
total maximum dollar loss for litigation
related to the credit crisis, however, fell
by 38 percent to $459 billion.
The report also sheds light on the
movement of the financial crisis. The
report indicated that the initial phase
of the crisis, when many publicly trad
ed firms saw their stock prices decline
dramatically, had ended, Grundfest
said.
According to John Gould, senior
vice president of Cornerstone
Research, the decline in litigations
coincided with a decrease in market
volatility.
"[The decline] really solidified the
understanding that the number of fil
ings really move in step with the
volatility in the market," Gould said.
To conduct the research, Stanford
Law School collects raw data, such as
filings of new litigations, while
Cornerstone Research conducts statis
tical analysis.
One unusual finding this year was a
longer delay between the date that the
stock dropped and when the case was
filed, according to Gould. The report
found a median delay of 100 days; his
torically, the difference is approximate
ly a month.
However, Gould added that most
of the delayed filings are attributed to
one plaintiff Coughlin Stoia Geller
Rudman & Robbins.
The historical average since the
Clearinghouse began in 1996 is 197 lit
igations filed per year, 14 percent high
er than this year's finding. Gould esti
mates that the number of filings will
increase again toward that average,
although not in 2010.
