## EDITORIAL Part 2: The Environmental Plan of Action 
### 
If the American people will not make eco
nomic sacrifices to hedge against global
warming, they must be convinced that
they will not have to, or better yet, that actions
will reap benefits. Current proposed legisla
tion certainly fulfills the first claim making
a barely noticeable economic impact. Paul
Krugman a Nobel Laureate and Princeton
economist uses a Congressional Budget
Office estimate to project that the bill would
only reduce annual economic growth be
tween now and 2050 from 2.37 percent to 2.32
percent.
That slight hit could be converted to a
major economic boost through one change to
the proposed policies: robust federal invest
ment. President Obama's original request for
$l5 billion in annual investment for clean-en
ergy development, recommended by a group
of 34 Nobel Laureate scientists, has been con
siderably weakened. It must be reinstated.
Yes, the federal budget is strained, but these
investments are vital for American competi
tiveness and would pay back many times
over.
Energy efficiency would be the most obvi
ous place to start. A recent McKinsey study
showed such investment could save the Unit
ed States $1.2 trillion by 2020, freeing up
money businesses would use to create many
more jobs.
Renewable energy also holds massive po
tential for economic growth. With a global
population that will hit nine billion by 2050
and standards of living rising around the
world, demand for energy will skyrocket past

its current supply, global warming or not.
If the United States does not rise up to fill
this market, other countries will. China plans
to invest $660 billion in clean energy over the
next 10 years and is already beginning to
dominate the industry. American inaction
would mean continued reliance on imported
energy, millions of lost jobs and another blow
to a frail economic foundation. Federal in
vestment in research and development, as Fa
reed Zakaria notes in Newsweek, has
brought us the Internet, lasers, MRIs and
DNA sequencing. It can bring us renewable
energy, too.
Ideally, a cap-and-trade would mandate
emissions cuts and finance such investment.
Such is the case in Denmark, where they have
cut carbon emissions by 14 percent since 1990
while increasing GDP by 40 percent and fos
tering a thriving clean energy industry. And
those who claim cap-and-trade would cost
American jobs ought to check the unemploy
ment rate in Denmark: an astonishingly low
four percent.
But if the political will for this cap-and
trade 'sacrifice' does not exist in the United
States, then energy investment should garner
bipartisan support, improve the economy and
make a significant impact on the climate
problem. Thomas Friedman, Zakaria and
commentators around the country have start
ed trumpeting this idea, originally popular
ized by the Breakthrough Institute think
tank: Going green can pay. And only when the
American people believe this will solutions
follow.
