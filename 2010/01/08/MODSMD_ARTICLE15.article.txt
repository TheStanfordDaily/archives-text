# THE 						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## Role of Interviews in Undergraduate Admission 
### Shelley Gao 
My dear editor wanted a reflective piece
on the past three months I've spent in
D.C. and my subsequent return to the
Farm. Briefly speaking, the reintegration
process has been rather arduous. Like many of
my Stanford in Washington peers, I am experi
encing a kind of cultural shock undoubtedly
thrilled to the back (people here actually smile!
The OMG amazing weather, laid-back atmos
phere), yet there is a sense of dislocation from
having spent a quarter away.
The healthy dose of pragmatism as result of
time in the real world raises questions concern
ing the value of our liberal arts degree and ex
acerbates the tension of junior year. The in
creasing awareness of the transient nature of
the Stanford experience brings the dilemma of
whether to spent our remainder time acquiring
practical skills or doing what we actually enjoy
(immersing in humanities, leadership roles,
company of some incredible people) into
sharper focus.
My tendency for delayed processing means
that the promised column will probably be de
livered at a later date. So instead, I am going to
talk about one of my favorite subjects, under
graduate admission. Admission has remained a
topic of intense interest for me despite having
being in college for three years. Perhaps it is
linked to how the admission is a dynamic field
that influences the state of higher education, of
fering fascinating insights into the Zeitgeist or
that fact that like many others, the drama of my
own experience applying to college has not yet
been forgotten the American system can be
totally byzantine to navigate for students
abroad.
On Dec. 11, the Office of Undergraduate
Admission accepted 13.5 percent of the 5,566
early applicant pool, offering admission to 753
restrictive early action applicants. The number
of restrictive early action applicants, a non
binding option that allows admitted students
until May 1 to respond to the University's offer
is the highest in Stanford's history, increasing
by almost 3.8 percent from last year.
There are many possible topics of con
tention regarding the admission philosophy at
elite institutions like Stanford. Questions arise
concerning the fairness of legacies consisting
approximately a fifth of the Class of 2013, the
possibility of increasing the number of interna
tional students from its current proportion of
seven percent (lower than the average 10 per
cent of the Ivies) or the type of student that the
University accept. Some friends are convinced
that the holistic admission principle is doing no
favor to enhancing intellectualism at Stanford,
as it selects superficially engaged polymaths; I
disagree.
However today, the topic will focus on the
importance of expanding the pilot alumni inter
view program, the latest evolution in Stanford's
application policies to all regions for future ad
mission cycles. After the inaugural year in 2008-
09, optional interviews are now offered to appli
cants attending high school in nine metropoli
tan areas that represent a cross section of the
applicant pool, including New York City, Port-

land, London and the state of Massachusetts.
Currently, most of our peer institutions, such
as Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Brown, offer
personal interviews as part of the application
process. There are several compelling reasons
for requiring this step. A face-to-face exchange
constitutes a mutually constructive exchange.
Applicants are offered an opportunity to learn
about Stanford in a unique manner by listening
to alumni discuss firsthand experience in aca
demics and student life. The admission commit
tee can learn about the candidate from anoth
er perspective, beyond the written materials.
Additionally, it serves as a tool to recruit excep
tional candidates from peer institutions, poten
tially improving Stanford's yield rate.The inter
view initiative, operated by Stanford's Out
reach Volunteer Alumni Link (OVAL) is a
meaningful and tangible way of keeping alum
ni emotionally and intellectually engaged in
the future of their alma mater.
Stanford is currently undertaking an evalu
ation of the interview pilot's inaugural year.
While there are legitimate concerns since inter
views are inherently a subjective exercise, these
can be forestalled. For example, alumni partici
pants should be provided with a formal set of
guidelines and procedures before they are ac
cepted as interviewers. There are mechanisms
already in place to ensure that an interview's
bias does not negatively impact upon the appli
cant's admission prospect. The interviewer's
perspective is one of many factors grades,
standardized test scores, teacher recommenda
tions, extra-curricular activities and essays
considered by the admission committee. The
submitted interview report does not supplant
other aspects, but might warrant further scruti
ny on an applicant. There should also be av
enues available for students to offer feedback
to the University regarding their experiences.
Then, there are those who claim that inter
views are unfair because they do not reflect re
alistic potential for scholastic success. Stanford
receives applications from thousands of candi
dates who all look great on paper. Most of them
can handle the academic rigor of a Stanford ed
ucation. However, the strength of American
higher education is that it looks beyond the
numbers. College means much more than suc
cess classes. Stanford's reputation is based on a
student body that brings diverse talents and as
pirations. And interviews are an appropriate
medium to gauge that.
