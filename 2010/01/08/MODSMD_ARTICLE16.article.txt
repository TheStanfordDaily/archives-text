# WAXWORKS AND ROUSTABOUTS
## "Getting Down to Business" 
### PG. Mann 
So much for New Year's resolutions.
There I was on Jan. 1, knee-deep in lug
gage, resolved to board a greyhound to
Lafayette, La. to begin my new life as a phi
losophy major. Then a tweet came screaming
through the ether into my iPhone. UL-
Lafayette had announced it was doing away
with its philosophy degree. Extinguished
were my hopes of becoming an educated
southern gentleman, drawling on Epictetus
and gazing into the Heraclitean flux of my
mint julep.
The pain brought to mind the trauma of
last fall, when I showed up at Michigan State
with a trunk full of Sophocles and some nasty
stuff by Catullus in my back pocket, only to
be informed that MSU was axing its classics
major. No dorm room bacchanalia with mae
nad coeds. No drinking Old Milwaukee out
of a kantharos. No impressing girls by read
ing aloud the letters on the fraternity houses.
I was beginning to fear this country no
longer had room for a man of my liberal arts
persuasion. Thereupon a dark spell came
over me. I alternated between carving out
chunks of my flesh and flipping through
Forbes magazine.
But, just when I was poised to toss a coin
and either hack off a limb or major in busi
ness, a tweet came blistering through the
ether into my iPhone and restored my will to
live. The University of Texas at Austin has
paved the way to the future of education with
a new course: The English Maj or in the Work
place.
Here students read Death of a Salesman
and follow it up with strategies for network
ing, writing good resumes and giving success
ful job interviews (this is not a joke). With
classes like that, UT is a school that is going
to hang onto its English major.
At last, the fuzzy and worthless humani
ties have become relevant!
Before, we of the humanities had to lurk in
the shadows of the nation's majority, the
business majors teaching their children,
writing their newspapers, eating from dump
sters, going to law school when resignation
struck. All the while we envied their produc
tivity, their synergy, their output-ability. But
most of all, we admired their scrupulous at
tention to ethics, those questions concerning

our collective wellbeing and ultimate aims as
individual human beings. Now, finally, we're
getting the specialized workplace skills we
need in order to join them in the bang-up
business they are doing all across America.
And this is only the beginning. I can only
dream of all the other potential edifying
courses I will be able to take as an English
major in the second decade of the 21st centu
ry. Look for these classes in your upcoming
course catalog:
How to Sell Your Soul: The Faustian Tra
dition

The Brothers Karamazov and the Broth
ers Lehman: The Pitfalls of Family Finance
Siegfried Sasoon/Vidal Sasoon: A Com

parison in (Entrepreneurial) Style
Heart of Darkness: Kurtz as Corporate
Visionary
Email, Text, Tweet: Advanced Composi
tion
How to Tie a Tie
Selling/Stealing, Brokering/Bamboozling:
The Power of Rhetoric
Naked Lunch Power Lunch: A Chat n'
Chew, Meet n' Greet for Wingtipped Beat
niks (martinis and mechanical dildos provid
ed)
Speaking in Complete Sentences and
Other Interviewing Strategies
The Power of Positive Thinking: A Study
in Textual Exegesis
Bleak House: Sub-Prime Mortgaging and
the Dickensian Dignity of Poverty
The Cubicle: A Space for Creative Explo
ration (prerequisite: Thinking Outside the
Box while Inside a Cubicle)
If only the University of California would
start offering courses like these. Then its
alums would make so much money, they,
rather than the state, could subsidize the cost
of tuition.
With this new business casual makeover
of the bed-headed patched-tweed English
major, my degree is sure to make me a valu
able worker in the jobless economy. Now I
don't have to major in business just to get
ahead in the bread line.
What's more, I can look my relatives
square in the face when they ask me what I'm
going to do with a degree in English and tell
them:
"Why, I'm going to join the workforce,
juggles spreadsheets, earn great big pots of
money, sink it into an oversized house, boost
the GDP, watch shitloads of prerecorded tel
evision, sire some children who will be even
more ignorant than I am, get laid off, lose the
house, get sick, and then hope to God by that
time one of my idiot kids has majored in busi
ness and makes enough money to put me in a
private nursing home, where I will slowly
drool out all memory of my existence."
"Wonderful," they'll say. "That sounds just
like a business degree. Eminently practical."
