## Luck is just the next Card to be snubbed 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Stanford fans grumbled
(read: yelled) about Mark
Ingram beating out Toby
Gerhart for the Heisman
Trophy. But Thursday's Freshman
All-American team announcement
should prompt even greater fury
the Football Writers Association of
America chose Tom Savage of Rut
gers over Andrew Luck for the lone
quarterback spot.
Now let me be clear: in the grand
scheme of things, this doesn't really
matter. There are a number of
Freshman All-American teams.
Luck made the first team for the
Sporting News, College Football
News and Rivals. But the FWAA is
a fairly prestigious organization
it gives out the Nagurski and Out
land trophies and holds an ap
propriate level of clout, which is
what makes their (awful) selection
so weird.
It's not just about Luck al
though it helps to have a Stanford
bent. Savage was no better than the
fourth-best freshman quarterback
in the country and was not even
tops in his own conference.
(It's worth mentioning that I
happen to like Tom Savage quite a
bit. Rutgers is as close to a local
team as New York gets and while
I'm not a fan, they're fun to watch.
He has a wicked arm and is fairly
mature for a true freshman. With
due respect to Mike Teel, he's the
best Rutgers QB I've seen. But he
still doesn't deserve this honor. I've
digressed.)
Who was the best? It shakes out
fairly well. Luck was the clear No.
1, with Oklahoma's Landry Jones
and South Florida's B.J. Daniels
below him. Savage enters the con
versation here, along with Michi
gan's Tate Forcier and USC's Matt
Barkley, although he tops both.
Before getting to Savage, Jones,
Luck and Daniels, let's key in on
one statistic: yards per attempt
(YPA). It's an efficiency rating that
is perhaps the most important for
quarterbacks. The name is self-ex
planatory in order to maintain a
high number, you have to a) com
plete a good percentage of passes
for b) a nice amount of yards. One of
the main qualms with Colt McCoy's
Heisman campaign, for example,
was that while he hit on 70 percent
of his passes, they did not go for a
tremendous amount of yards his
41st ranking in YPA indicates a ten
dency to dump the ball off more
than other quarterbacks.
As for our freshmen, Luck was
sixth in the nation with 8.9 YPA;
Daniels was eighth at 8.7. Sand
wiched between them was Jimmy
Clausen. Savage was 35th, just
ahead of Aaron Opelt of Toledo.
Jones, in the weakest part of his
candidacy, was 63rd.
But let's not look at just one sta
tistic. Savage threw for fewer yards
with a worse completion percent
age than both Luck and Jones.
Luck threw for one less touchdown
than Savage, but he also tossed just
four interceptions, whereas Savage
threw seven. Meanwhile, Jones had
26 scores through the air. Luck
added 354 yards rushing; Savage
and Jones both had worse than neg
ative 100 yards on the ground.
Daniels ran for 772 yards and com
piled 23 total scores. Savage had
the lowest passer rating of the four;
Luck had the highest.
Put it this way: of the major sta
tistics, Savage topped Luck in ex
actly one: touchdowns. He had 14,
Luck had 13. When rushing scores
are factored in, they had the same
amount. Otherwise, Luck tops him
across the board. Nearly the same
holds true for Luck and Daniels,
except that Daniels has more total
touchdowns.
Speaking of USF's dual threat,
outside of yards per attempt, where
Daniels is far and away better than
Savage, the two have fairly similar
passing statistics. But Daniels
rushed for nearly 900 yards and
eight touchdowns more than Sav
age he was multidimensional,
while Savage was most certainly
not.
As for Jones, he tops Savage in
yards, touchdowns, completion per
centage and passer rating. Savage
