### KABIR SAWHNEY STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's swimming and diving
team is looking to build on an impressive 3-0
start, with a number of dual meets coming up in
the next few weeks. The team is keeping an eye
toward the season-ending Pac-10 and NCAA
tournaments.
The team's main headline of the season did
not come in a Stanford meet, however. Senior
Julia Smit set two new world records at the Duel
in the Pool in Manchester, England over winter
break. While competing for Team USA, Smit
posted world-record times of 2:04.60 in the 200-
meter individual medley and 4:21.04 in the 400-
meter individual medley. She is also the defend
ing NCAA champion in both events.
In Stanford's first meet on Oct. 2 against San
Jose State, Smit dominated the competition and
headlined a 183-103 win for the Cardinal. She
took three events the 100-yard breaststroke,
the 100-yard freestyle and the 1,000-yard
freestyle to propel Stanford to victory. Junior
co-captain Kate Dwelley and senior co-captain
Elaine Breeden also contributed significantly.
On Nov. 7, the Card made an even more em
phatic statement at a tri-meet in Gainesville,
Fla. Stanford soundly defeated two of the na
tion's strongest programs, Michigan and Flori
da, by scores of 307-122 and 231-198 respective
ly. Smit and sophomore Betsy Webb led the Car
dinal victories. Smit won four individual races
and led two Cardinal relay teams to victory,
while Webb added victories in three freestyle
races.
Looking forward, the Cardinal's ultimate
goal for this season is to improve on last year's
finish in the NCAA Finals, where the team nar

rowly beat out Texas to bring the fourth-place
trophy back to The Farm.
"We were able to maximize our potential," said
head coach Lea Maurer. "I thought we had a
strong team effort and we were happy with
fourth."
Breeden was also optimistic about this year's
prospects.
"We have a really good shot at improving our
standings from last year. With hard work, I think
we can do really well," she said.
Maurer also emphasized that the team's
main strength is not in the individual swimmers,
but in their ability to work together dynamical
ly-
"We have many different leaders and draw
strengths from a variety of different groups," she
said.
"We've really come together as a team, and
we continue to strive toward our goals,"
Dwelley added. "In every race, we race for the
team and each other."
Maurer also emphasize d that the team needs
to work on its depth. Last season, 10 Stanford
swimmers and two divers were able to qualify
for the NCAA Finals, well short of the 18 ath
letes a school is permitted to send to the meet.
"We need to send more people to the NCAAs
and score at the NCAAs," she added.
While the team is returning many top per
formers from last year, it also has a very strong
recruiting class of new freshmen. The new swim
mers have made numerous contributions this
year, especially on relay squads.
"They've integrated really well into the
team," Dwelley said. "They provide us with a lot
of extra competition, and bring great personali
ty and a great dynamic to the team."
Despite the team's hot start, Maurer is fo

cused on keeping the team fit and disciplined.
"What we've done at this point is relentless
confidence and relentless fitness. We want to be
really fit and mentally tough," she said.
Another challenge put to the Cardinal is the
new restrictions on high-tech swimming gear.
Many critics claimed that the suits gave an un
fair advantage to schools, like Stanford, that had
deals with the right manufacturer.
"I'd like to [achieve my] best times, but that's
going to be tough," Breeden said. "I hope to set
new personal records despite the restrictions."
The team's next meet is at the Avery Aquat
ics Center on Saturday against Pacific at 1 p.m.

"[The swimmers are] tired, we just came back
from holiday training," Maurer said. "This will
be a mental toughness and details test, to see if
we can make good choices when we're tired and
not letting mistakes appear."
According to Dwelley, the team is pretty bro
ken down physically, but will still look to win this
weekend.
"I'm not expecting super fast times. We're
going to work on race strategies and team
work," she said.
