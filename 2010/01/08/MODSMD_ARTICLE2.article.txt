# HEADING SOUTH
## Cardinal travels to Los Angeles for Pac-10 battles 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Cardinal will face one of the
tougher tests of its still-young Pac-10 season
this weekend when the team heads to Los
Angeles to play USC and UCLA. After
soundly defeating rival Cal its last time out,
Stanford will look to continue its momentum
en route toward a 10th consecutive confer
ence title.
While it may be difficult to imagine the
10-1 Cardinal facing a considerable chal
lenge in both games of a road trip, the Trojans
(8-5, 2-0 Pac-10) and the Bruins (9-4, 2-0)
perennially find themselves in contention for
competitive spots in conference and national
tournaments. While the Cardinal managed to
win all of its matchups against the L.A.
schools last season, the games were not easy,
including hard-fought Pac-10 tournament
games. The Trojans in particular posed a sig
nificant threat to Stanford, barely losing the
race to a regular season conference title and
earning runner-up behind Stanford in the
Pac-10 tournament.
By all indications, it would appear that
both teams are off to fantastic seasons. Just
last weekend, in fact, the L.A. schools each

managed to sweep nationally ranked Ari
zona State and Arizona.
"Both teams look great," emphasized
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. "I've
been watching so far, and USC had Ten
nessee down by 10 at one point on the road,
and UCLA had an opportunity to beat Duke
at Duke, so they've both done well with a
tough non-conference schedule. But that's
the nature of it. We want to play teams that
have done well and will make us better. This

is definitely a very tough road trip, and it
might be the toughest combination of teams
we face."
Given what they've already been through
this season, Stanford should be well prepared
to compete on this road trip. The Cardinal
purposely scheduled a tough non-conference
season, including several games against top
-10 teams, and managed to outscore oppo
nents in 21 of 22 halves that it played the
exception being a disappointing second half
against defending champion Connecticut.
"We played a brutal non-conference
season, arguably the toughest ever for Stan
ford and probably one of the toughest in
the country," VanDerveer said. "I think our
team played terrific basketball. I think we
learned a lot, and we're very excited about

the Pac-10."
Stanford already played one game in its
conference season, knocking off the Golden
Bears by an apparently convincing margin of
79-58. Never one to rest on her team's laurels,
however, VanDerveer wasn't entirely satis
fied with the team's performance.
The Cardinal was able to hold Cal to just
35.9 percent shooting and picked up a com
bined 49 rebounds, but shot a somewhat un
derwhelming 41.8 percent. Last season, the
Cardinal shot an average of 47.3 percent for
the year.
"I wasn't really pleased with how we
played against Cal, and I think we've really
cleaned some things up since," she said.
"We're doing some new things and getting
everyone on the same page. Our rebounding

and our defense was great, but we've since
been working really hard to clean up our of
fense, and it looks a lot better."
Good teams need good players, some
thing the Trojans and Bruins certainly are not
lacking. USC is led on the court by sopho
more guards Ashley Corral (15.7 points per
game, 5.8 rebounds per game, 5.8 assists per
game) and Briana Gilbreath (12.9 ppg, 5.8
rpg). Heading up UCLA's offense, mean
while, are standout freshman guard Markel
Walker (12.9 ppg, 8.5 rpg) and sophomore
guard Jasmine Dixon (12.7 ppg, 7.7 rpg).
Stanford's roster, meanwhile, is absolutely
packed with star power. Sophomore guard

Guards Rosalyn Gold-Onwude and JJ Hones and forward Kayla Pedersen enjoy the waning moments of a Cardinal victory. Stanford has had
many chances to smile, winning 10 of its first 11 games this season. This weekend's trip to the Los Angeles schools marks the Cardinal's first
road trip in Pac-10 play. Stanford will take on two tough opponents in USC and UCLA, both coming off sweeps of ranked teams.
