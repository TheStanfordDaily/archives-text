# Cardinal looks to take next step
## 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team enters this season with higher
expectations and hope for redemp
tion after the 2009 season. While the
Cardinal produced one of its most
successful seasons since 1997, finish
ing in fourth place in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
and sixth nationally, the team met an
abrupt ending against USC in the first
round of finals.
Now, Stanford is ranked No. 3 in the
coaches' poll as well as in the MPSF,
behind No. 1 USC and the defending
national champions, No. 2 UC-Irvine.
Last season, the Card went 21-11 only
to finish with a five-set loss against
USC in MPSF playoffs.
"We went up 2-0 and it was disap
pointing that we lost that match in
five," said head coach John Kosty.' 'We
thought we had our opportunity to go
deep into the tournament and maybe
end in the national championships."
Flowever, the attitude heading
into this season thus far has been
tremendously influenced by last sea
son's highlights including libera Erik
Shoji's kick set that appeared on
ESPN and You Tube with over
250,000 views. Similarly, the team ex
perienced "late match heroics" in
Long Beach "by pancaking a ball" for
the win, according to Kosty.
Last season, the team also bid
farewell to starting middle blocker
Brandon Williams. His position will
be filled by Gus Ellis, Charley Henrik
son and Max Halvorson.
"I think Brandon is a tough guy to
replace, but Gus Ellis got a lot of play
ing time last year so he'll fill in nicely,"
senior setter Kawika Shoji said.
With the main hit to the roster
coming from the graduated middle
blocker, the Card returns six of its
seven starters, including first team
All-American brothers Kawika and
Erik Shoji.
The brothers are the first duo from
Stanford awarded Ail-American
honors since 1993.
"[Erik] helps me out because he
passes me the ball," Kawika said. "I
tell everyone he makes me look good.
He makes my job a lot easier."
The Shoji brothers have brought
much success to the program, includ
ing a pair of school records. Kawika
set the bar for assists in a single season
at 1,394, while Erik eclipsed the na
tional record with 447 digs in a single
season.
Aside from the Shoji brothers, the
Card returns its best hitter, senior op
posite Evan Romero, who holds the
Stanford record for most career kills
at 1,295. Last year was Romero's
third straight season leading the
Card's offensive attack, averaging
4.33 kills per set.
"We're senior-led in team with a
junior and a couple of sophomores
thrown in and that gives us a definite
advantage over a lot of teams," Kosty
said. "We're striving to be even better
than we were last year."
This coming season remains a
chance to prove to the volleyball
world just what the Cardinal is made

of. Though last season remains a suc
cessful season in Stanford history, the
team expected a longer run into the
MPSF playoffs. This season holds its
own set of expectations as well.
"I know that I can speak for every
one on the team when I say that our
expectations for this season are very
high," Ellis said. "With almost all of
our starters returning, strong senior
leadership and a refined work ethic,
we are looking forward to a great sea
son and hopefully we will be ending it
with a final match in Maples Pavilion
for the NCAA title,"
All of these qualities will be tested
as the season gets underway as the
Card hosts its first opponent, Univer
sity of Hawaii. Hawaii exhibits a chal
lenging team, especially with 6-foot-9
opposite hitter Jonas Umlauft, 6-foot
-5 outside hitter Steven Hunt and 6-
foot-3 outside hitter GusTuaniga.
Hawaii will be the initial test of
where Stanford stands in the MPSF.
"We need to prove that we can go
deeper into the MPSF tournament,"
Kosty said. "We need to prove our
consistency and be ranked higher all
season long. Our team is ready. We
filled all of our holes. We're ready to
go after it."
This month starts off the MPSF ex
citement and the team hopes to con
tinue making its journey toward the
NCAA championships in the spring
here at Stanford.
Support the Card as they take on
Hawaii on Jan. 15 in Maples Pavilion
and Jan. 16 in Burnham Pavilion. First
serves are at 7 p.m.
This weekend, however, the team
will be playing in an alumni match on
Saturday in Maples Pavilion that will
feature graduates from 1990 to 2009.
The match will commence at 8 p.m.
