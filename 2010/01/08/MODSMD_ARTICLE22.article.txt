Tt was a decade that began paralyzed by confusion and uncertainty with our hands hovered, quivering over the panic
button. It was period that started when we were so disoriented and nervous that we didn't even bother naming it.
Sure there was the '7os and next the 'Bos, then naturally the '9os, but what the hell was this? The naughts? The Ohs?
Why name a decade when we weren't even sure if we'd be there to see it out?
When the date line hit two, triple-zero in the year column, we began a new decade (and century) with our fingers
crossed, eyes half-shut and one foot in the bomb shelter, half-expecting our world to come to a catastrophic end as the
clock struck midnight.
Ten years on, we're still here and our fingers are still crossed. Taking a step back from it all, it's not quite clear if
we are any better off now than when we started in 2000. A decade that began with Y2K endured some the most horrific
manmade and natural disasters, was marred by constant turmoil and now ends in one of the worst economic situations
this nation has seen since the Great Depression.
Looking for metaphors for the sake of comparison, it would be almost too easy to compare the travails of the
naughts to the ordeals of the music industry in the last 10 years. The decade began concerned not with Y2K, but rather
MP3, as an industry scrambled to topple Napster during the file-sharing service's heyday. It was the beginning of a
decade-long campaign against the idea that music did not constitute a free public domain. And despite the shutting down
of the company, today, failing record sales, the collapse of labels and one savvy marketing ploy by Radiohead have all
been a tribute to the way that consumers now view and obtain their music.
In terms of musical creation, we've never seen a more schizophrenic decade. It's been a time when the title of
"indie" has slipped into mainstream thought and when Jay-Z is as likely to be heard blaring from the Upper East Side as
the Bronx. Music has become niche-ified as artists, struggling to make a name for themselves, have stretched themselves
to the limit with garage-revival, Afro-pop, house, 10-fi, hi-fi and all the stupid labels that come with diversification.
The result? On one hand, it's kids with 100 gigs of music, ear buds jammed in on full-blast pumping Arctic
Monkeys and Kanye. The decade has seen the creation of a listening public with the inability to stay content with one
artist or genre and an insatiable desire to have the latest and greatest music. On the other side, this decade has seen the
development of a plethora of great sound that has never been heard before. Artists fed off the decade's uncertainty and
listeners' fickleness to push the envelope and explore what was really out there.
So here's a pick of the 25 finest albums of the last 10 years. With contributions from Death Cab for Cutie to The
Streets, these releases ushered in a new era and provide a damn good soundtrack to an uncertain and unpredictable
decade. -RM
