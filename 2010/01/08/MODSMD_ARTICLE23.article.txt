# MEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Card looks to regain championship feeling 
### JESSICA YU 
The evening of April 17,2009 was
one heck of a night. The fans at the
University of Minnesota Sports Pavil
ion in Minneapolis, Minn, were sitting
on the edge of their seats, wondering if
top-seeded Stanford would finally
edge bitter rival University of Okla
homa for the 2009 NCAA Men's
Gymnastics Championship title.
It was a night similar to that of
April 18, 2008, when Oklahoma
pushed past Stanford by less than half
a point to capture the 2008 Champi
onship. That championship, hosted by
Stanford in front of its home crowd at
Maples Pavilion, was supposed to be
long to Stanford. That championship,
like the 2009 championship, came
down to the very last man on his very
last routine of the night.
That championship did something
to Stanford. After what can only be de
scribed as a devastating, mind-numb
ing, tear-out-your-heart loss, the men
of the Stanford men's gymnastics team
did the only thing they could do. They
went back to the gym. They went back
to the floor that haunted them and the
horse that taunted them. They went
back to their tangled rings and their
slippery bars and promised themselves
that a new day would come.
And when that day came when
the very last man on his very last rou
tine of the night on April 17,2009 stuck
his dismount it was Stanford that
came out on top.
"It was unbelievably energizing,"
said redshirt junior Nick Noone. "I sat
down after my last routine and saw all
of my teammates channeling every
ounce of positive energy they had into
the guys still to go. Suddenly, what's
usually seen as an individual sport had
turned into a team sport."
And on April 16,2010, Stanford is
poised to do it again. With five new re
cruits and a dozen former national
champions on the team, Stanford has
the talent, the experience, the fresh
ness and the depth to capture yet an
other national title.
On one hand, there is Ben
Rudolph, the wide-eyed freshman re

cruit from Chicago. The son of a for
mer men's collegiate gymnastics star,
Rudolph spent his junior and senior
years of high school anticipating his
turn with Stanford men's gymnastics.
After flying from his windy hometown
to sunny Palo Alto for the 2008
NCAA Championship and purchas
ing a ticket to Minneapolis for the
2009 Championship, Rudolph's
dream finally came true. But so far, his
time at Stanford hasn't been easy. He
confesses that it has been a tough ad
justment: the training is harder, the
competitors are stronger and the ex
pectations are out of this world. None
of that, though, deters Rudolph from
his ultimate goal. "I'm just so ready to
compete," he said.
On the other hand, there is Abhinav
Ramani, current junior and co-captain.
Once a boy who was so self-reportedly
miserable at baseball that his mother
all but forced him into gymnastics at a
friend's suggestion, Ramani is a gym
nastics natural who has unfortunately
spent more time in rehabilitation than
in competition at Stanford. After
breaking his wrist early in his collegiate
career, Ramani has been frustratingly
sidelined by three similar injuries that
have kept him in therapy and forced
him to relearn the tricks that give his
routines their competitive edge.
That's not to say Ramani hasn't en
joyed his time with Stanford men's
gymnastics. While not part of the line
up at last years NCAA Championship,
Ramani still found himself on the floor
helping chalk up equipment and keep
ing the team's energy high. That moti
vating presence was exactly what led
his fellow gymnasts to name him one
of their captains. In his new role, Ra
mani is excited to see how the new
team faces the season's upcoming
challenges.
"With five new guys, we bring a less
experienced team to the table," Ra
mani said. "But that doesn't make us
any weaker." With no broken wrist to
mend this time around, Ramani is
ready to lead his team to a consecutive
championship title.
