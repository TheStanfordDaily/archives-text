## The
						Daily sits down with Mayor Pat Burt to talk about local issues 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Pat Burt can now add
mayor of Palo Alto to his ex
tensive curriculum vitae. The
long-time Palo Alto resident
and president of the Acteron
Corporation was elected to his
new position Monday night in
a unanimous city council vote.
"I was pleased and hum
bled," Burt said. "But I know
that there are a lot of chal
lenges ahead."
Standing paramount
among these challenges are
Palo Alto's financial troubles,

which have been compounded in the last two years by a
weak economy.
"We're going to need a combination of cutting our
costs, restructuring and finding new revenue to fill a big
gap," Burt said of the city's financial woes.
Although the details of this plan are not yet apparent,
Burt said he and his fellow councilmembers will work to
reform employee benefits and pensions, as well as to re
organize the city government in a more efficient man
ner. The council also plans to address a variety of infra
structure concerns.
"We already had long-term structural problems in
underfunding our reinvestment in our infrastructure
our buildings and our streets and parks," Burt explained.
One salient example is the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment, which is cramped for space and requires seismic
related reconstruction.
"We've had a long-time need to provide a more mod
ern and safer police building," Burt said. "Our police de
partment has not had adequate size to function proper
ly and to meet certain governmental code requirements.
