# PALO ALTO THERE'S A NEW MAYOR IN TOWN
## The 						Daily sits down with Mayor Pat Burt to talk about local issues 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Pat Burt can now add
mayor of Palo Alto to his ex
tensive curriculum vitae. The
long-time Palo Alto resident
and president of the Acteron
Corporation was elected to his
new position Monday night in
a unanimous city council vote.
"I was pleased and hum
bled," Burt said. "But I know
that there are a lot of chal
lenges ahead."
Standing paramount
among these challenges are
Palo Alto's financial troubles,

which have been compounded in the last two years by a
weak economy.
"We're going to need a combination of cutting our
costs, restructuring and finding new revenue to fill a big
gap," Burt said of the city's financial woes.
Although the details of this plan are not yet apparent,
Burt said he and his fellow councilmembers will work to
reform employee benefits and pensions, as well as to re
organize the city government in a more efficient man
ner. The council also plans to address a variety of infra
structure concerns.
"We already had long-term structural problems in
underfunding our reinvestment in our infrastructure
our buildings and our streets and parks," Burt explained.
One salient example is the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment, which is cramped for space and requires seismic
related reconstruction.
"We've had a long-time need to provide a more mod
ern and safer police building," Burt said. "Our police de
partment has not had adequate size to function proper
ly and to meet certain governmental code requirements.


Mayor Pat Burt
"This is something that has been
going on as a debate in the commu
nity for 15 years, and it has not got
ten resolved," he added.
Addressing this problem in the
wake of a slow economic recovery
"makes it doubly hard," according to
the mayor. However, he still remains
optimistic. He indicated that the
booming 'cleantech' economy pres
ents many opportunities for Palo
Alto.
"One of the things that we're now
seeing is a real convergence between
the values of the city and the values

of our residents in being progressive
environmentally," Burt said.
He also expressed enthusiasm for
greater cooperation with Stanford
University on sustainable practices.
"It's underappreciated by many
— the great synergy that exists
between the initiatives of Stanford
and the City of Palo Alto," Burt
noted.
In the past, the University and its
neighboring city have experienced
i numerous disagreements over con
i struction and sprawl, but as of late,
these town and gown differences
have been minimized,
i In a recent collaboration, Burt
worked closely with Joseph Stagner,
executive director of Stanford's
Sustainability and Energy
: Management Executive Office, to

make Stanford Hospital more sus
tainable. Three years ago, the pro
posed construction plan for the hos
pitals was a topic of contention
because it failed to incorporate
green elements.
"Now [that] the plan has moved
in that direction ... many of the dis
agreements have been basically nar
rowed," Burt said. "Not eliminated
yet, but there's a lot less distance
between what the city is looking for
and Stanford's planning on doing."
An environmental leader, Burt
has been involved in the sustainabil
ity movement long before it became
widely appreciated and practiced.
He currently serves as the vice chair
of Sustainable San Mateo County
and has worked with the California
Environmental Protection Agency.

"I've always had a great interest
in public policy," Burt said. "Before I
was on the council, I spent nine years
on our Planning and Transportation
Commission and, before that, sever
al years leading a neighborhood
group."
But Burt did not have the oppor
tunity to seek a position on the city
council until two years ago — the
task of raising two kids and manag
ing his business proved too demand
ing a time commitment.
Burt will serve on the city council
alongside Karen Holman, Gail Price,
Greg Scharff, Larry Klein, Nancy
Shepherd and Vice Mayor Sid
Espinosa.
