# 2010 in Stanford sports
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
It's 2010 time for a new year
and a new decade for the Stan
ford Cardinal. It is safe to say
that Stanford has dominated
the collegiate athletics landscape
for the past 10 years, winning every
Director's Cup (15 in a row total)
and 21 NCAA Championships
over that period. There is no sign of
stopping for the Card heading into
the second decade of the 2000s and
it starts with 2010. Here are 10
things to watch for on the Farm this
year.
Men's Volleyball
The men's volleyball team is
ranked No. 3 in the preseason, its
highest preseason ranking since
2002. Coming off a season in which
it won 21 games its most since
1997 the Cardinal could be na
tional title contenders. The reason
for the optimism lies in the experi
enced lineup, which returns five
starters from last year, including
kill-leader Evan Romero, Ail-
American setter Kawika Shoji and
the 2009 national Newcomer of the
Year, libero Erik Shoji.
Men's Tennis
After a Sweet 16 appearance in
the NCAA tournament last year,
the men's tennis team is back this
year looking for more. The Cardi
nal's top recruiting class joins five

returning starters. Alex Clayton,
Bradley Klahn, Ryan Thacher and
Richard Wire will lead the team,
which is ready to return to the
Stanford men's tennis teams of the
past. Klahn and Thacher had a dec
orated fall season in doubles while
Clayton was an NCAA singles
semifinalist in 2009. This team will
be fun to watch in 2010.
Women's Basketball
A stellar 2009 was only a spring
board into 2010, where the
women's basketball team is
ranked No. 2, its only loss coming
to No. 1 Connecticut. The team
looks unstoppable in Pac-10 play
this year. Jayne Appel, Nneka Og
wumike and Kayla Pedersen will
lead this team deep into the
NCAA tournament. You can be
sure this team wants a rematch
against Connecticut on a neutral
court. Don't be surprised if it hap
pens in the NCAA Finals.
Julia Smit and Elaine Breeden
Two world-class swimmers will
be swimming their final seasons on
the Farm after what will be historic
swimming careers. Smit just broke
two world records a month ago
and both she and Breeden have
Olympic hardware from Beijing in
2008. They will be the ones to
watch in the pool this year for
Stanford and across the nation.
The two are both 19-time Ail-
Americans, Smit with three indi
vidual NCAA titles and Breeden
two. Needless to say, expect big
things out of them in 2010, both at
Stanford and beyond.
2010-11 Men's Basketball
While this season is not over
and anything can happen in this

year's Pac-10 (example: Wednes
day's win over USC), fans should
be excited for the new crop of tal
ent coming in for Dawkins's third
year. Dawkins's best recruiting
class currently ranked 13th in
the nation by Scout.com enters
Stanford next season to join this
year's relatively young team. After
a two-year lull in Stanford basket
ball, next year could begin a rise
back up to where the program has
been in the past.
2010 Football
The biggest thing to look for
ward to from the football team next
season is the way it responds after
an 8-5 season in 2009. In all likeli
hood, Stanford will lose Toby Ger
hart and backs Stepfan Taylor and
Tyler Gaffney will have big shoes to
fill. But the defense should be better
and Andrew Luck should excel
after a year of experience. A sched
ule with some key home games will
be huge and the Cardinal will have
the confidence of this year's win
ning season in them. A big question
mark is how the new coaches will
adjust. Stanford will have a few new
assistant coaches on the sidelines
next season; hopefully the players
will take to them nicely.
Chris Derrick
Stanford's Ail-American dis
tance runner will hit the track this
spring and the cross-country
course next fall to continue his al
ready decorated career. The sopho
more is already a five-time Ail-
American and was the 2009 Pac-10
Runner of the Year in cross coun
try. A third-place finish at the
NCAA Championships in cross
country this past fall followed a
freshman track campaign where he
finished third in the 5,000 meters in
the outdoor NCAA finals. He will
be looking to add to his success
with a first-place trophy in track
this season, as well as cross country
next fall as he gets older and

stronger and his competitors grad
uate. The guy is just really good.
Teagan Gerhart
The younger sister of Toby Ger
hart takes to the Stanford Softball
field along with her sister, Kelsey.
Teagan, a pitcher, will challenge
for the starting spot as a freshman.
She had a 30-2 record with a .35
ERA in high school. Perhaps the
Gerhart magic will carry over from
the football field to the softball
field this spring.
The Director's Cup
It's the beginning of the winter
season and we are already winning.
It might be over already. Sweet 16.
