# FIGHTING BACK
## Card faces fellow rebuilder UCLA 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If Wednesday night's games were any
indication of what is to come, Saturday af
ternoon's contest between UCLA and
Stanford could be a game for the ages.
Stanford squeezed by a deflated USC
team on Wednesday, winning 54-53 after
sophomore point guard Jarrett Mann sank
one of two free throws with just 10.6 sec

onds left on the clock.
"It was very important," head coach
Johnny Dawkins said after the victory. "It
was a tough loss for us at Cal. It's nice to
win it on the final possession. We've had
some tough ones."
UCLA won by one point also, but in an
even more thrilling manner: senior
Michael Roll sank a mid-range jumper
with just 1.9 seconds remaining on the
clock after the ball was fortuitously de
flected by a Cal defender, right into the
guard's hands. Roll's shot gave the Bruins
a 76-75 victory over the Golden Bears, the
preseason favorite to win the conference.
"I just turned and shot it," Roll said to
the Los Angeles Times after the game.
"And it went in."

Both the Bruins (7-8, 2-1 Pac-10) and
Cardinal (7-7, 1-1 Pac-10) appear to be
having down years, especially UCLA.
After three Final Four appearances in the
last five years, head coach Ben Howland's
team is likely going to miss the NCAA
Tournament for the first time since 2004.
But both teams clearly have some solid
basketball left in them, and Saturday's
game will be an important one for two
teams fighting to stay in the upper half of
the conference this season.
The outcome of the game will probably
be determined by how the guards match
up. Like Stanford, UCLA's post game is
not its strength the team was dealt a sig
nificant blow to an already meager front
line when then-leading rebounder Drew
Gordon decided to leave the program.
Gritty Bruins freshman Reeves Nelson
has stepped in and done yeoman's work in
his absence since then, though, reaching
double digits in points and being a force on
the boards in his last seven games.
As said before though, the match-up
between each team's guards will likely de
cide the game. Mann will have the task of
facing Bruins point guard Malcolm Lee,
who leads the team with 14.1 points and
3.9 assists per game. Sophomore Jeremy
Green, the Cardinal's strongest perimeter
threat, will have the task of guarding Roll.
Green is more athletic and a bit stronger
than the veteran Roll, so he may have the
advantage in that match-up.
Both teams have been inconsistent this
season, though the Bruins have shown a
bit more life in recent weeks. UCLA has
won four of its last five games, although
that stretch of games is sandwiched by a
dispiriting 77-63 loss last weekend to Ari
zona.
Although UCLA seems to have come
together a bit more in the recent weeks, the
Bruins and Cardinal seem to be two teams
that have a lot in common. Both have con
sistently stayed near the top of the Pac-10
for the last two decades, and both seem to
be in rebuilding years of sorts. Even fur
ther, Stanford and UCLA experienced
similar off-the-court problems, though the

Senior captain Landry Fields holds off a defender in Stanford's thrilling 54-53 win
over USC. The Cardinal looks to continue its success in Pac-10 play against UCLA.
Bruins' Nikola Dragovic's legal issues
stemming from a fight at a concert are
much more substantial than the
dropped allegations against Green.
Games against what some call
"swing opponents" are often the most
important, as they can go a long way
in determining a team's standing at
the end of the year. Aside from being
a battle of two programs trying to re
claim their past success, Saturday's
game may make the difference be
tween a third seed or sixth seed dur
ing the all-important Pac-10 Tourna
ment come March.
It's UCLA and Stanford. And
while the stakes are a bit lower than
usual, Saturday's game is not one to
miss. Tipoff is at 3 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.
