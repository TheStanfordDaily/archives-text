A Stanford doctor has achieved a his
toric first in the medical community.
Michael Link, M.D., a professor in
Pediatric Cancer at the School of
Medicine, is the first pediatric oncologist
to be named president of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).
While the majority of ASCO presi
dents have been medical oncologists, who
care for adults with cancer and who also
make up the bulk of ASCO membership,
Link's election as a pediatric oncologist
highlights the importance of children's
cases in cancer research and care, as well
as the value of unity among all disciplines
related to cancer.
"This reflects, I think, how pediatric
oncology in many ways has led the whole
field of oncology," said Dr. Bertil Glader,
a fellow professor and doctor in pediatric
oncology.
"I couldn't be more pleased or
proud," added Dr. Harvey Cohen, pro
fessor of pediatrics. "In my opinion, he is
the best pediatric oncologist in the coun
try."
ASCO, an international nonprofit,
dedicates itself to uniting cancer physi
cians and researchers to improve cancer
prevention and care, as well as to edu
cate physicians about the newest
research developments.
Link looks toward assuming the role
of president-elect in June, and he sees a
particular opportunity for a global focus.
"It's called the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, but more than one

nology, new procedures often remain
unaffordable for developing countries.
Many of the newest therapy technologies
are not only extremely expensive, but
also difficult to transport, and Link
believes the ASCO holds a responsibility
to pave the path toward greater equality.
"We can't just be focused on the new,
the more expensive, the most high-tech
we have to focus on the exportable,"
he said.
In a nation engulfed in debate over
healthcare, Link hopes to shape ASCO
to encourage greater understanding of
Medicare and Medicaid patients' needs.
"We want to make sure these children
have access to the best care, that that

have served as ASCO president before,
and Link's colleagues from the Stanford
School of Medicine are thrilled about his
ascendency.
"This is kind of a situation where the
student does better than the teacher,"
said Cohen, who taught Link as a student
and resident. "He has always been bril
liant, and he asks incredibly good ques
tions. He's done earth-shattering work
with children with cancer."
"We should all be honored this is a
great tribute to his accomplishments,"
Glader said.
An active member of the ASCO for
years, Link has served on several com
mittees and is currently an associate edi

tor for the organization's Journal for
Clinical Oncology. Yet, Link says pedi
atrics have provided his driving passion
ever since his medical school days.
"You develop a very intense relation
ship with the family," he said, "taking

them through a dark hour and hopefully
bring them back into the light, bring
back a cured child. It's the most satisfy
ing thing you can imagine."
For Link, the combination of working
with children in a scientific environment
and fostering lifelong relationships with
the whole family proved "almost an irre
sistible combination."
Link sometimes hears from his
patients years later as adults, and several
have even become doctors themselves.
"What more fun could there be?" he asks
himself.
