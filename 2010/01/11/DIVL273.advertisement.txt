OBITUARY
-
Arthur Stanley Goldberger died on Fri
day, December 11,2009 at Select Spe
cialty Hospital in Madison, Wl just after
his 79th birthday. Art was a preeminent
economist who taught at the University
of Wisconsin from 1960-1999.
Throughout his career, Art also taught
at Stanford University. He was an Assis
tant Professor of Economics from the
years 1955-1959; a Visiting Professor,
through the Institute for Mathematical
Studies in the Social Sciences from
1972-1973; a Visiting Scholar through
the Department of Economics from
1985-1986; and a Visiting Professor to
the Department of Economics during
the years 1990-1991,1995-1996, and
2000-2001. Art was a Fellow at the
Center for Advanced Studies in the Be
havioral Sciences in Stanford, CAfrom
1976-1977 and 1980-1981.
His academic prominence was primari
ly in the technical field of econometrics,
and his research often used advanced
statistical methods, but he was widely
noted and praised for his clarity of writ
ing and for his pedagogic skills. He
won numerous teaching awards. A
leading journal in econometrics re
ferred to his graduate-level text book,
Econometric Theory, as a "landmark
that set a new standard of rigor in
econometrics." His research often
dealt with controversial public issues
such as the measurement of race and
sex discrimination in labor markets, the
heritability of intelligence, and the com
parative effectiveness of public and pri
vate schooling at primary and second
ary levels. His research in statistical
methods and in the analysis of public
policies were influential across the so
cial sciences-economics, sociology,
psychology, and the overlap between
statistics and genetics.
The breadth of his achievements was
recognized in his many and diverse
professional honors. He was a Fellow
of the Econometric Society, the Ameri
can Statistical Association, the Acade
my of Arts and Sciences, and the
American Association for the Advance
ment of Science, and twice was a
Guggenheim Fellow. He is a Distin
guished Fellow of the American Eco
nomic Association and a member of
the National Academy of Sciences. In
1985, he gave the Woytinsky Lecture at
the University of Michigan.
The citation of all of Art's achievements
cannot however begin to express the
extent of the admiration and affection
for him by his students and colleagues,
across many departments. Through
out his career he expressed a generosi
ty, a commitment to integrity, and infor
mality in the service of his family,
friends, community, and profession.
As for his personal life, Art was born on
November 20,1930 in Brooklyn, New
York to David and Martha Goldberger.
He loved to play tennis and volleyball,
enjoyed gardening, crossword puzzles
- specifically the cryptic puzzles, read
ing, listening to music, his friendships,
daily trips to the coffee shop, and his
cat, Plum. His quick wit, good nature,
warmth, thoughtful, and easy-going
personality created many life-long
friends.
Art was most proud of his family. He
was married to lefke Engelsman Gold
berger for almost 50 years, lefke died
in May, 2007. Their admiration, love,
and respect for each other remained
constant throughout their lives. Art is
survived by his daughter Nina, his son
Nick, their respective spouses Jeff and
Carol, and Nina's son, Jake.
Throughout his long illness his strength
and determination never weakened. In
the end, he died the way he lived, sur
rounded by his family and friends.
We would like to say a very special
thank you to all the staff at Select Spe
cialty Hospital for taking such good
care of our father and treating him with
the utmost respect and thoughtfulness
until the very end.
A Celebration of Art's life will be held at
Blackhawk Country Club in Madison
on Saturday, January 23,2010.
Friends may gather with the family at
2:00 p.m. to reminisce and toast Art's
life. In lieu of flowers, contributions may
be made to a charity or activist organi
zation of one's choice.
May his Memory be for a Blessing.

OBITUARY
-
Arthur Stanley Goldberger died on Fri
day, December 11,2009 at Select Spe
cialty Hospital in Madison, Wl just after
his 79th birthday. Art was a preeminent
economist who taught at the University
of Wisconsin from 1960-1999.
Throughout his career, Art also taught
at Stanford University. He was an Assis
tant Professor of Economics from the
years 1955-1959; a Visiting Professor,
through the Institute for Mathematical
Studies in the Social Sciences from
1972-1973; a Visiting Scholar through
the Department of Economics from
1985-1986; and a Visiting Professor to
the Department of Economics during
the years 1990-1991,1995-1996, and
2000-2001. Art was a Fellow at the
Center for Advanced Studies in the Be
havioral Sciences in Stanford, CAfrom
1976-1977 and 1980-1981.
His academic prominence was primari
ly in the technical field of econometrics,
and his research often used advanced
statistical methods, but he was widely
noted and praised for his clarity of writ
ing and for his pedagogic skills. He
won numerous teaching awards. A
leading journal in econometrics re
ferred to his graduate-level text book,
Econometric Theory, as a "landmark
that set a new standard of rigor in
econometrics." His research often
dealt with controversial public issues
such as the measurement of race and
sex discrimination in labor markets, the
heritability of intelligence, and the com
parative effectiveness of public and pri
vate schooling at primary and second
ary levels. His research in statistical
methods and in the analysis of public
policies were influential across the so
cial sciences-economics, sociology,
psychology, and the overlap between
statistics and genetics.
The breadth of his achievements was
recognized in his many and diverse
professional honors. He was a Fellow
of the Econometric Society, the Ameri
can Statistical Association, the Acade
my of Arts and Sciences, and the
American Association for the Advance
ment of Science, and twice was a
Guggenheim Fellow. He is a Distin
guished Fellow of the American Eco
nomic Association and a member of
the National Academy of Sciences. In
1985, he gave the Woytinsky Lecture at
the University of Michigan.
The citation of all of Art's achievements
cannot however begin to express the
extent of the admiration and affection
for him by his students and colleagues,
across many departments. Through
out his career he expressed a generosi
ty, a commitment to integrity, and infor
mality in the service of his family,
friends, community, and profession.
As for his personal life, Art was born on
November 20,1930 in Brooklyn, New
York to David and Martha Goldberger.
He loved to play tennis and volleyball,
enjoyed gardening, crossword puzzles
- specifically the cryptic puzzles, read
ing, listening to music, his friendships,
daily trips to the coffee shop, and his
cat, Plum. His quick wit, good nature,
warmth, thoughtful, and easy-going
personality created many life-long
friends.
Art was most proud of his family. He
was married to lefke Engelsman Gold
berger for almost 50 years, lefke died
in May, 2007. Their admiration, love,
and respect for each other remained
constant throughout their lives. Art is
survived by his daughter Nina, his son
Nick, their respective spouses Jeff and
Carol, and Nina's son, Jake.
Throughout his long illness his strength
and determination never weakened. In
the end, he died the way he lived, sur
rounded by his family and friends.
We would like to say a very special
thank you to all the staff at Select Spe
cialty Hospital for taking such good
care of our father and treating him with
the utmost respect and thoughtfulness
until the very end.
A Celebration of Art's life will be held at
Blackhawk Country Club in Madison
on Saturday, January 23,2010.
Friends may gather with the family at
2:00 p.m. to reminisce and toast Art's
life. In lieu of flowers, contributions may
be made to a charity or activist organi
zation of one's choice.
May his Memory be for a Blessing.
