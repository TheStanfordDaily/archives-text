Chemistry Chair Richard (Dick)
Zare was honored on Jan. 6 with the
Presidential Award for Excellence in
Science, Mathematics and Engineering
Mentoring. He was among 87 recipients
of the award, which was presented by
Pres. Obama at the White House.
The award was presented to Zare
"for embodying excellence in mentoring
underrepresented students and encour
aging their significant achievement in sci
ence, math and engineering." Zare was
nominated for the prestigious award by
Associate Dean of Research and
Chemistry emeritus Prof John Bravman.
A Stanford professor since 1977, Zare
has distinguished himself as an educator
and leader in public service, and he
remains active in both research and
teaching.
"I like the satisfaction of helping peo
ple," Zare said. "I like to do things in life
that make a difference."
Professors, graduate students and
alumni alike had praise for Zare. Former
student Lori Gottlieb 'B9 fondly remi
nisced about her Stanford experience
with him. "I was a French major, but I still
always hung out at his office," she said.
"He related to people of all majors.
"He was so available," she added.
"You could just come into his office and
talk about even tangential things"
Gottlieb noted that Zare caused his
students look at the world in an entirely
different way and "made science like sto
rytelling." She described her experiences
in medical school.
"There was a difference between
those people who had taken very tradi
tional science classes and those people
who I knew had gone through Professor
Zare's classes," Gottlieb said. "The peo
ple who had gone through his classes
looked at problems differently.
"He was one of the most inspiring
professors—no, human beings —that I
know," she added.
Zare has also made an effort to reach
out to foreign students. Tatsiana
l.obovkina, a postdoctoral scholar from
Sweden and current member of the
"Zarelab" —the professor's laboratory
—commented on her experience com
ing to America to study chemistry.
Lobovkina said Zare supported her
fully through correspondence while she
was seeking financial aid support. "He
really helped me with my application for
a scholarship," Lobovkina said. "All my
questions were answered in such a nice
way that it felt like I was an important
person. I was really welcomed by him."
Lobovkina recalled her first
encounter with Zare: "I really liked the
way he was talking about science

when I was talking to him, I just really got
the feeling that this is the place I really
want to be," she said. "I could really feel
like I could work with this professor.
"When I get back to Sweden," she
added, "I really want to spread the same
type of attitude that Professor Zare dis
plays to make people just as comfortable
as I am."
David Leahy Ph.D. '92, current lab
manager for the Zarelab, who was also
one of Zare's former students, said the
professor motivated him to pursue his
research career.
"He very much encouraged the sense
of enthusiasm for having the passion for
pursuing your problems of interest,"
Leahy said.
A long-time veteran of the chemistry
department, Zare also mentored several
members of the current faculty.
Chemical engineering Prof Stacey
Bent Ph.D. '92 was one of Zare's
menteea According to Bent, a big part of
her decision to pursue a Ph.D. in chem
istry was the desire to do the kind of
research that Zare was doing in his labo
ratory, which she described as "state-of
the-art."
Bent first met Zare when he present
ed at her school, UC-Berkeley. "His pres
entation was memorable because he had
so much enthusiasm for the topic he was
discussing," Bent wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
In addition to mentoring individuals,
Zare has worked to improve the condi
tions for his department colleagues.
When he became chair of the chemistry
department five years ago, Zare institut
ed a paid maternity leave policy.
"I was interested in making the chem
istry department family-friendly," Zare
said. "There's no good time to have a
child if you're trying to have a career at
the same time.
"Men and women are different, and
no man gives birth that I know about,'' he
added. "We need to understand that, so
that women can be involved; if not, we
just cut off 50 percent of the population."
Along with mentoring accomplish
ments, Zare also has received a slew of
awards for research. He says he is best
known for bringing laser techniques to
bear on chemical problems —from how
reactions occur to the chemical analysis
of tiny volumes.
"What's so unique about Prof. Zare is
that he's both an outstanding teacher and
mentor who cares deeply about inspiring
his students, and also a brilliant
researcher making tremendous scientific
contributions to the world," Gottlieb
said. "It's not often that you find these
two qualities in the same person."

Washington, D.C. last week to receive the award from Pres. Obama.
