## THE 						DUDE ABIDES At Least It's an Ethos 
### Zack Warma 
If I may, I would like to propose a question
for you to gnaw on: Who are you? Simple,
terse, yet somehow strikingly elegant,
these three words underscore the very foun
dation of student life and culture at Stanford.
Allow me to clarify. I am not asking about
your hometown, your ethnicity or your sexu
al preference, though these do tangentially
play a role; what I want to know is your fresh
man dorm, your varsity or club team, your
fraternity/sorority, what VSO you currently
run and whether you prefer Stern to Lag
Late Nite. In short, my inquiry is actually this:
Here at the Farm, what is your identity
what set of masks do you wear for the cam
pus to see?
So long as you have not spent the last sev
eral contiguous years living here without
end, it is a bit difficult to miss the fact that
Stanford exists as a bit, oh, how shall we say,
disconnected, from the world at large. I am
frankly of the opinion that the Stan feels
more like some Zimbardian social experi
ment, whereby a coterie of twisted psych re
searchers concocted an alternate realm free
of traditional social norms and replaced in
stead with Synergy, STS and the TOTOT
TILSJUMB.

What this means for us pampered inmates
is that our lives, the paths over which we
tread within Campus Drive, are construc
tions we (the Stanford community, both past
and present) have erected with our own
hands. Being an ASSU hack has as little
(though probably even less) relevance to so
ciety than if you are an Uj CTA or Dance
Marathon VP of Development, though all
three in some respect carry unique implica
tions that we have invested them with here. I
am not arguing that your activities and in
volvements on campus do not matter; rather,
that it is easy to overlook the fact that we in
habit a place that exists very much unto itself
and with very few parallels elsewhere.
The Stanford life is continually turned on
"repeat." It bears noting that, with a few no
table exceptions, we are not special. In fact,
we are marginal replications of archetypes
that have passed through this place several
times over. If you ever get a chance, go
through your freshman year scavenger hunt
pictures and then track down the albums of
Stanford folks both a few years older and
younger than you. When photos taken over a
half decade apart look identical, the red flags
start to arise.

I get the idea of traditions, really. I'm a his
tory major. But we are not talking about tra
ditions. Instead, those experiences and
events that as wide-eyed frosh we are almost
convinced are unique and special to just us
take on a different light when placed beside
the realization of their annual repetition for
decades. My freshman year RA had a major
impact upon my life and my understanding of
Stanford, and currently in his old room is a
friend of mine who is RA-ing for the same
dorm, with frosh popping in for guidance and
company and candy, not unlike what this old
fool did two long years prior. Such a realiza
tion, while not detracting from my memories,
certainly provides a new way of looking back
at my time here.

Outside of the occasional presidential
election, football upset or campus contro
versy, Stanford culture operates within an
unspoken, albeit highly apparent and rela
tively predictable, set of norms. The arbiter
of long-term success for any and all student
organizations and activities hinges on the ca
pacity to provide a sustainable model that
can be replicated years down the line. I know
that I sound like Waldorf and Statler here (if
you know the reference, I'll bring you to
Bagel Day), but chances are that whatever
wonderful and dynamic activities dictate
your Stanford experience have been doing
just that for others before you so many more
times than any of us want to accept. We are
not some massive state school that makes no
claim to puffing up our individuality here
we are told that we are special. However,
those grand NSO illusions lose their luster at
some point.
My aim is to not depress the hell out of
the campus or crush any naive dreams. The
winter gloom, our own respective demons
and the Biocore seem to accomplish that far
better than I could ever manage. As the
Dude would ask, then, "What's your point
Walter?" The acceptance of our own minis
cule and Ã¼biquitous roles at Stanford, I con
tend, is actually beneficial to succeeding and
thriving here. When inane and superficial
social demarcations are seen to be just that,
unexpected characters and opportunities
arise. Discarding prevalent campus tropes
makes this strange and utterly bizarre place
all the more fascinating. In short, it really
ties it all together.

As Waldorf and Statler would say about this
column, "It's not half bad... You're right, it
was all bad! " Contact this crusty old geezer at
zwarma@stanford. edu.

The Stanford life is
continually turned on
repeat.' It bears noting
that, with a few notable
exceptions, we are
not special.
