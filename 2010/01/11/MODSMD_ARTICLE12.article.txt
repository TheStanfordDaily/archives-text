## Stanford F.A.I.T.H.: From Conflict to Cooperation 
### 
So often I wonder if interfaith work can
really have the voice I hear. I wonder if it
can shed its pathetic refrain of vague,
self-congratulatory liberal notions of toler
ance. I wonder if, amid the noise and haste of
talk-show evangelism and televised extrem
ism, we can discern the more powerful alter
native stories: of Mahatma Gandhi and Bad
shah Khan, of Martin Luther King, Jr. and
Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. I wonder if
our silence, our inability to tell these stories as
they affect us, cedes the terrain to agents of
destruction, who would have only their group
dominate and others suffocate.
In truth, I don't know. Our public dis
course on religion is too frequently filled with
violence and virulence, endowing the so
called clash of civilizations with the sheen of
inevitability. It's this very uncertainty, howev
er, that urges me to change the conversation
from conflict to cooperation. So, I'd like to
tell you how I spent the last days of my winter
break. The Hindu community in which I was
raised bought a new property some two years
ago an old church in the foothills of San
Jose. The final day of our new year's retreat
involved a special Vedic fire ceremony to
pray for, among other things, spiritual maturi
ty and mutual cooperation with our neigh
bors: a Polish church that has been particular
ly warm and welcoming. I love these rarefied
rituals: the smells of smoke and mystery and
tradition, the joyful liturgical harmony of the
priests, the deep sense of the height and glory
of this sacrifice. But my favorite part of the
day was to hear the following from several at
tendees, my mother included: "There's some
thing about this place, this church. People
have really prayed here. It's those blessings
that are coming to us."

For her, the dialogue of religious experi
ence did not simply override cultural boxes; it
drew on their deep wells and breathed their
spirit across space and time. I don't think we
require some mystical assertion to recognize
that, as Gwendolyn Brooks says: We are each
other's magnitude and bond. Like the faith he
roes I mentioned, I believe my religious tradi
tion calls me to build mutually enriching rela
tionships with those different from me by
working together to serve others. Religious
particularity is not only about domination or
persecution or political intransigence; it gives
us the ability to interrogate ourselves, to take
learning seriously, to be surprised and hum
bled by the fact of existence. I am not interest
ed in apologetics, but in fellowship; not mere
ly in hearing another's story, but in writing a
new chapter together.
This is what I hope Stanford F.A.I.T.H.
will begin here: countering violence by con
fronting the triple threats of racism, econom
ic exploitation and war; countering hatred by
advocating for feminist and LGBT rights;
countering mistrust by preventing deaths due
to malaria. These are concerns that call on the
best of our traditions religious and secular
alike and require us to engage our deepest
identities in common action. Please join our
weekly meetings: Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. in
the Common Room in the CIRCLE (Third
Floor, Old Union). Help us transform inter
faith cooperation from an anomaly to a social
norm. Every student is a potential interfaith
leader. We need only have the words and the
heart to act.
