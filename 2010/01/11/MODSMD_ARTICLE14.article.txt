# GIRL, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## The 						Worst Classes at Stanford 
### Jordan Carr 
Now, I'm not trying to be rude (no R.
Kelly), but there are too many class
es at Stanford. It is absolutely im
possible to keep track of all these things.
That is why I, your intrepid columnist, am
here to review this quarter's worst classes
(and a few good ones). The findings here
are, as always, scientific and not to be ques
tioned.
ARTHIST 414 Italian Mannersim
(Morten Hansen, 5 units)
Now, I don't really know what this class is
about, or really whether it will answer "ques
tions of the bella maniera, anti-classicism,
and center and periphery in mannerist art in
light of developments in scholarship from
the 70s to the present." But the fact that it
has a typo in its name (seriously check
anywhere) should disqualify it.
PWR 1 Post-Feminism, Post-Race: Gen
der in the Age of Obama (Dana Carluccio, 4
units)
Students: do not encourage this. If this class
turns out to be popular, every other class will
be "Organic Chemistry in the Age of
Obama," "Private Lives, Public Stories
About Barack Obama: Autobiographies in
Women's History" and "Ancient Journeys,
Modern Quests with Barack Obama."
CHINLANG 11 Beginning Southern
Min (Taiwanese) Conversation (Lin, 2
units)/TIBETLNG 2 First Year Tibetan
(Clark, 3 units)
It really is time for these to be conquered by
a Chinese language class.
SURG 230 Obesity in America
(Woodard and Morton, 1 unit)
Should we be concerned that the solutions to
"Obesity in America" lie in the Surgery de
partment? The course description advertis
es, "Lunch provided." If you are teaching a
course about how fat everyone is, that takes
one hour once a week, it shouldn't have a
lunch break.
SURG 69Q It's All in the Head: Under
standing Diversity, Development, and De

formities of the Face (Helms & Brugman, 3-
4 units)
This one wins the coveted "Least Appropri
ate Pun" award, dethroning last year's win
ner, "Suck On This: An Oral History of Hard
Candy in America."
CEE 268 Groundwater Flow (Kitanidis,
3-4 units)
I'm still mad at these guys for stealing the
name of my eco-conscious spoken word po
etry collective.
COMPMED 103 Horse Medicine
(Green, 2 units)
This is replacing the much less popular class
offered last year entitled "Glue and Jell-o:
How to Deal with an Unhealthy Horse Old
Yeller-style."
GSBGEN 315 Strategic Communication
(Schramm, 4 units)
When your class has a 300-word description
concluding with the sentence "More details
provided in the syllabus," you are demon
strably unable to teach a class called "Strate
gic Communication."
GSBGEN 348 The Economics of Higher
Education (Bettinger, 4 units)
There is only one session for this class. The
professor arrives to class in a stretch limo,
wearing a mink coat, coated in diamonds
and platinum necklaces, walks up to the mi
crophone, yells, "Suckas!" and leaves you
with a newfound appreciation for the eco
nomics of higher education.
HISTORY 231S —Early Modern Things
(Findlen, 4-5 units)
Part 2 of a two-part sequence with Late An
tique Stuff.
HUMBIO 87Q Women and Aging
(Winograd, 5 units)
Proposed subtitle: "The Cougar Hunt."
MUSIC 80T Jewish Music in the Lands of
Islam (Tchamni, 4 units)
Also known as "Shhh ... keep that racket
down, they're going to hear us."

PSYCH 146 Observation of Children
(Lomangino & Hartman, 3-5 units)
Ladies and gentlemen, the creepiest class of
the quarter.
PSYCH 266 Current Debates in Learning
and Memory (Wagner, 1-3 units)
This would be a better class if the professor
could remember any of the older debates in
learning and memory.
PHYSICS 16 Cosmic Horizons (Romani,
3 units)
No Enchanted Broccoli Forest.
But that's not all there is. In fact, there are a
few worthwhile classes. Here is that list in its
entirety:
ARTSTUDI 80 Color (Edinark, 3-4
units)
Feel the excitement.
FEMSTIBBN Imagining Women: Writers
in Print and in Person (Miner, 4 units)
Finally, a class in the feminist studies depart
ment where you are encouraged to have fan
tasies about women. Approve!
GEOPHYS 60N Man versus Nature:
Coping with Disasters Using Space Technol
ogy (Zebker, 4 units)
Screw coexisting! Enough with all this pro
environment bias in the curriculum final
ly a class that has the balls to try to teach us
how to defeat nature.
CLASSGEN 2058 —The Semantics of
Grammar (Devine, 2 units)
You're probably thinking, "This sounds bor
ing ... grammar is boring why should I
care?" How about because the professor en
ters class on a zipline shouting, "Are you
ready to learn about some grammar?! ?!" into
a megaphone, while the class mascot (that's
right, it has a mascot) the Conju-Gator fires
off a T-shirt cannon? You will be excited by
the passive voice.
