## SOUTHERN COMFORT Early leads help lift Card over USC and UCLA 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the Pacific-10 Conference season just
one game old, the Cardinal hit the road last
weekend to battle USC and UCLA in South
ern California.
Returning with two wins, an 82-62 defeat of
USC (9-6,3-1 Pac-10) and a narrow 65-61 victo
ry over UCLA (10-5,3-1 Pac-10), No. 2/2 Stan
ford (13-1,3-0 Pac-10) marked a successful trip
early in the year. The wins also move the team
to the top of the Pac-10 table, and will give Stan
ford good memories of Trojan hardwood when
it returns to the Galen Center for the Pac-10
Tournament in March.
Friday's game against USC started perfect
ly for Stanford, which raced ahead to a 22-4
lead in the first 6 minutes, 42 seconds, and ex
tended this to 30-7 as the competition only
made three of its first 17 shots.
With the situation looking perhaps a little
desperate, the Trojans rallied together and
brought the deficit down to just nine points
with 15 minutes left in the game. But that was
the closest they got, as the Cardinal responded
with four three-pointers and a 14-2 run that ef
fectively sealed the contest.
Having beaten three top-25 teams this year
under new head coach Michael Cooper, given
the Cardinal a close run for the Pac-10 title last
season, and taken their first two matches in the
conference, the Trojans looked like tricky op
ponents for the Friday game. The final result,
though, was perhaps a bit of a reality check for
Cooper's young program.
"For us to come back against the No. 2 team
in the country and get within nine points was
admirable on our part, but it doesn't do any

thing for us," Cooper said. "We've still got a lot
of work ahead of us."
After expressing disappointment in the per
formance that recently defeated California, al
beit by 21 points, Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer was happier with this victory. Both
forwards junior Kayla Pedersen and sopho
more Nnemkadi Ogwumike made double
doubles in points and rebounds, with senior
center Jayne Appel just one rebound shy of
joining them. Meanwhile, credit goes to guards
senior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude and junior
Jeanette Pohlen for keeping the USC back
court at bay.
"We played much improved since our last
game," VanDerveer said. "We rebounded well,
ran well, and I'm really happy with our im
provement."
At the end of the first half of the game on
Sunday, many expected another strong victory
by the Card against the Bruins. With only 24
seconds until the half-time buzzer, it had
opened a 20-point lead, and it looked like the
hard work might be done.
But UCLA had other ideas, and started an
11-point unanswered run that continued into
the second half. When the clock had ticked
down to 1:40, the commanding margin was
gone, barely two points separated the two sides
and it seemed as if the Bruins just might hand
Stanford its second loss of the year.
While the Cardinal had posted almost the
same number of points in the first and second
halves (31 compared to 34), UCLA had more
than doubled its haul (43 to 18). Though it was
not enough for a Bruin victory, it is still hard
to tell which team will be feeling better after
this.
U CLA showed that it can push and perhaps

beat one of the highest-ranked programs in the
country, but Stanford ultimately took the statis
tic that mattered: the win.
There were no double-doubles on the Car
dinal bench, and the numbers don't look great
in general. The team made 16 turnovers to
UCLA's nine, and the Bruins managed seven
steals. Appel fouled out and Ogwumike came
close to following her, and though she played
for the entire game, Pedersen could only regis
ter six points.

Stanford revealed its skill on Friday, but
Sunday's game illustrated that depth remains
in this conference the title is not guaranteed
to return to the Farm.
"All I can say is they are not a team to be
taken lightly," Pohlen said. "They are a great
physical team and have great individual play
ers.
"We learned today that we have a lot of
competition in the Pac-10."
Two players stand out, though: Ogwumike

again notched up over 20 points â€”lO of her 21
were scored once she was already resting on
four fouls and Gold-Onwude broke her ca
reer record with an 18-point total, including the
two free throws that finally put the game out of
reach in the last few seconds.
The Cardinal returns to campus this week to
face Washington State at Maples on Thursday
and Washington on Saturday.
