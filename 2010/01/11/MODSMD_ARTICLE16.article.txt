# TAMING THE TIGERS
## Card splashes to dominant win before Pac-10 opener 
### KABIR SAWHNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's swimming and div
ing team started its winter season off with a big
home win against Pacific on Saturday, beating
the Tigers by a final score of 154-97. The
team's dual meet record now stands at 4-0 as it
looks to go undefeated in dual meets for the
second consecutive season. Stanford has lost
only one dual meet since 2006, going 31-1 in
that span.
As expected, the Cardinal was able to dom
inate Pacific despite lingering fatigue from
holiday training, sweeping all 16 events. The
Tigers put up little resistance, placing no high
er than fourth in 10 events.
Strong performances from senior co-cap
tain Elaine Breeden, junior Liz Smith and
sophomore Betsy Webb headlined the Cardi
nal's win. Each swimmer notched three wins
in the meet, including relay events.
The trio and junior co-captain Kate
Dwelley started the day by winning the 200-
yard medley relay, posting a time of 1
minute, 43.61 seconds. Other Cardinal relay
teams came in second, third, fourth and
sixth.
Breeden went on to win the 200 butterfly

and the 200 individual medley, posting times
of 2:01.24 and 2:05.89, respectively. She won
both events by four-second margins.
Webb won the 50 freestyle in 23.23, and
Smith took the 500 free in 4:44.29.The5e two,
Dwelley and sophomore Sam Woodward
won the day's final event, the 200 free relay,
with a B-standard time of 1:33.29.

Senior co-captain Julia Smit, who broke
two world records in England over winter
break, also turned in a strong performance.
She posted B-standard times in the 100 back
stroke and the 100 free, going 55.07 and
48.97, respectively.
The Stanford freshmen were also impres
siveâ€” freshmen Andi Murez and Natalie
Durant each won events. Murez took the 200
free in 1:51.41, and Durant won the 200
backstroke in 2:02.84. Other freshmen swim
mers placed well in numerous events and
were key parts of Cardinal relay teams.
Despite this strong showing, there is still a
need for improvement for these swimmers.
"The freshmen can step it up and con
tribute to the team more, including myself,"
said freshman Megan Fischer-Colbrie, who
placed second in the 100 backstroke and
third in the 200 back. "We can do a better job
helping the team score points."
Other winners for the Card were juniors
Angela Duckworth (1,000 free) and Kerry
Kraemer (100 breast), sophomore Jamie
Bruce (200 breast) and senior Stefanie Sutton
(100 fly).
Stanford's diving team also won its two

events, the one-meter and three-meter platform.
In the end, the meet was little more than a
warm-up for the Cardinal as it heads into Pacif
ic-10 Conference competition. Next weekend,
the diving team will head south to the Bruin
Diving Invitational in Westwood, Calif., and the
Card will duel Arizona State and No. 2 Arizona
in two dual meets on Jan. 22 and Jan. 23.

"[The meet] was like a dress rehearsal for
the bigger meets to come," Fischer-Colbrie
said. "Right now, it's not about the team's end
result, but more about making sure we're
doing the right things to race well."
