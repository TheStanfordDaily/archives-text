## Men's volleyball tunes up in alumni match 
### Chris Juhnke 
Last night, the Stanford men's volleyball
team had its final tune-up before the regular
season begins, hosting a team of past men's vol
leyball players in an alumni match at Maples
Pavilion. The alumni team showed up to play
and gave the varsity starters three close sets, al
though the current team came out on top. In
the fourth set, the alumni, including 2009 grad
uate Jarod Keller at libero, 1985 All-American
Craig Lauchner and three-time All-American
Dan Hanan (1988-1990), added current player
Gus Ellis and beat the Stanford second team.
The Cardinal, which is ranked No. 3 in the
American Volleyball Coaches Association
preseason poll, starts the season Friday, Jan. 15
against No. 12 Hawaii. Stanford, which had an
excellent fall season, looks to kick its season off
the right way, while Hawaii is looking for an
other upset to add to its victory last week over
No. 1 USC in the championship of the Outrig
ger Hotels Invitational. Stanford is led by sen
ior Evan Romero, Stanford's career leader in
kills with 1,295, along with returning All-
American brothers Kawika and Erik Shoji. Se
nior setter Kawika recorded 1,394 assists last
season to facilitate the offense, while sopho
more libero Erik helped anchor the team's de
fense with 447 digs.
The match against Hawaii begins 7 p.m. on
Friday in Maples Pavilion.
