# Crossing lines in coaching
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
First it was Mark Mangino.
Then Mike Leach. And final
ly Jim Leavitt.
What do they all have in com
mon? They are were all col
lege football coaches who have been
fired in the past month for using var
ious forms of discipline deemed too
severe by their respective universi
ties.
That isn't all they have in com
mon, however. Mangino, Leach and
Leavitt were three of the most laud
ed coaches in the nation the past few
seasons having all resurrected previ
ously decrepit football programs at
Kansas, Texas Tech and South Flori
da, respectively.
I have been a sports fan my entire
life and can say unequivocally that,
after racking my brain, I cannot
come up with a similar firing in any
sport from the past.
Sure, there was Bob Knight get
ting fired from Indiana for hitting
players among other transgres
sions but those actions were on
video tape, and sometimes on na
tional television. As was Ohio
State's coach, Woody Hayes, punch
ing Clemson's Charlie Bauman in
the jaw.
What happened with Mangino,
Leach and Leavitt happened behind
closed doors (pun intended, Mr.
Leach).
What I'm getting at here is that
the world has changed. Actions that
were formerly O.K. are no longer ac
ceptable today. I know that not
everything that is longstanding is
necessarily a good thing, but in this
case the change signals something
deeper permeating through Ameri
can society. Simply put, people are
getting soft.
There are an abundance of fac
tors that likely contribute to banning
of good-ol' fashioned discipline.
Media technology is obviously
one factor. Things that previously
did not garner national attention can
be heard by anyone and everyone on
Twitter five minutes after they hap
pen, or communicated via Facebook
for the entire world to see. Or, in the

Leach case, a cell phone camera was
all that was needed to make Mike
Leach's treatment of a concussed
Adam James a national story.
Another factor is the growing
fear of liability. Universities are
strapped for cash, and while football
brings in millions of dollars, the fear
of getting sued hangs over the head
of every university president and
athletic director.
That said, Mark Mangino, the
2007 National Coach of the Year, a
coach who doubled his school's
bowl wins during his tenure and led
them to their first BCS bowl win,
was fired for his alleged verbal
abuse of players.
He wasn't accused of hitting any
one (although grabbing was men
tioned), so basically he was fired for
being a jerk. Somewhere, Bear
Bryant is rolling over in his grave.
I think what administrators must
be forgetting is that this is football. It
is a violent game that teaches players
to literally hit their opponent, and it
requires massive amounts of adrena
line to be successful.
Coaches spend hundreds of
hours molding these young men's
bodies, teaching them to be aggres
sive, to want to inflict pain on oppo
nents. Somewhere in that tangled
web of testosterone and shoulder

pads, there is going to be some
yelling, and every once in a while,
someone is going to get grabbed
or even hit. So be it.
The nature of the game teaches
players to be obedient, but in a world
where young people are allowed
more and more freedom at increas
ingly younger ages, obedience can be
hard to come by.
So, when a player with a concus
sion shows up to practice with sun
glasses on and complains about the
light, a coach locking him in a dark
place does not seem too illogical.
Maybe the illogical part was doing it
to the son of an ESPN broadcaster,
as ESPN is right at the center of the
media boom.
In no way is this column intended
to promote or condone coaches'
abusing players there have to be
limits as to what is allowed and what
isn't but I do believe that when a
coach is charged with controlling
and molding the lives of 100-plus
college athletes, there has to be some
leeway provided.
I don't know where Mangino,
Leach and Leavitt will land, but all
three are brilliant football minds
that deserve to be employed some
where. Unfortunately, I think it will
be a while until any of them has a job
again.

Daniel Bohm thinks the abuse he al
legedly "doesn't condone" is part of
football. Tell him you'd like to lock
him in a small, dark closet at
bohmd@stanford.edu.
