# Crossing lines in coaching

### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
First it was Mark Mangino.
Then Mike Leach. And final
ly Jim Leavitt.
What do they all have in com

Media technology is obviously
one factor. Things that previously
did not garner national attention can
be heard by anyone and everyone on
Twitter five minutes after they hap
pen, or communicated via Facebook
for the entire world to see. Or, in the
