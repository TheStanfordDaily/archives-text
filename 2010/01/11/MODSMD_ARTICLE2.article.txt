# New grads face health care worries
## Students balance job, health care searches as Congress debates 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
For someone looking for work during an
unsettled economy, Matthew Janes 'O7 seems
to be in a reasonably appealing position.
Armed with a Stanford degree in symbolic

systems and over a year of experience at Palo
Alto tech company mSpot, Janes has the right
credentials for a permanent programming
job. He is even making some money during
his job hunt by doing contract Web design
work.
But Janes and other work-seeking gradu
ates overwhelmingly absorbed with finding
post-college work are also dealing with anoth
er issue: the fact that they often lack standard
health care coverage during the job search
process.
Stanford requires every enrolled student
to have health insurance an "individual
mandate" in health care parlance. If a student

is not covered under an outside plan (usually
his or her parents'), the student must purchase
Cardinal Care, the University-run health
insurance plan, for a premium of $BOO per
quarter.
This ensures that Stanford students have
health coverage through their education.
However, neither Cardinal Care nor nearly
every parental health plan is available to
Stanford alumni after their graduation.
Many companies offer group health plans
to their employees, but when a graduate
wants to freelance or work at a start-up or a
small company that does not offer insurance
or when work is scarce in a down economy

â€” this makes the months and years after
graduation perilous from a health insurance
standpoint.
The United States Census Bureau esti
mates that 15.4 percent of the population was
without health insurance in 2008. Of those 46
million people, over half are between age 18
and 34. Young alumni are in the age group
most likely to be uninsured.
Most of those interviewed by The Daily try
to solve the problem of insurance by purchas
ing high-deductible emergency health plans.
Bryan Schell 'O7 gets a basic level of coverage
from this type of plan as he works an unpaid
internship at the United Nations Refugee

Agency in Washington, D.C. He hopes the
internship will open doors for future employ
ment (and health coverage), but for the
moment he can only afford a basic plan on his
own.
Under Schell's plan, the insurance compa
ny pays for expenses after the first $l,OOO, so
it doesn't help with check-ups and prescrip
tions. In the event of a major accident, though,
Schell would have help with the ensuing costs.
"I'm young and I don't have any health
problems, so it's ideal for me," said Schell, who
is paying rent out of savings and small earn-
