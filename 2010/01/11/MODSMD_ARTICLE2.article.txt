# New grads face health care worries
## Students balance job, health care searches as Congress debates 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
For someone looking for work during an
unsettled economy, Matthew Janes 'O7 seems
to be in a reasonably appealing position.
Armed with a Stanford degree in symbolic

systems and over a year of experience at Palo
Alto tech company mSpot, Janes has the right
credentials for a permanent programming
job. He is even making some money during
his job hunt by doing contract Web design
work.
But Janes and other work-seeking gradu
ates overwhelmingly absorbed with finding
post-college work are also dealing with anoth
er issue: the fact that they often lack standard
health care coverage during the job search
process.
Stanford requires every enrolled student
to have health insurance an "individual
mandate" in health care parlance. If a student

is not covered under an outside plan (usually
his or her parents'), the student must purchase
Cardinal Care, the University-run health
insurance plan, for a premium of $BOO per
quarter.
This ensures that Stanford students have
health coverage through their education.
However, neither Cardinal Care nor nearly
every parental health plan is available to
Stanford alumni after their graduation.
Many companies offer group health plans
to their employees, but when a graduate
wants to freelance or work at a start-up or a
small company that does not offer insurance
or when work is scarce in a down economy

— this makes the months and years after
graduation perilous from a health insurance
standpoint.
The United States Census Bureau esti
mates that 15.4 percent of the population was
without health insurance in 2008. Of those 46
million people, over half are between age 18
and 34. Young alumni are in the age group
most likely to be uninsured.
Most of those interviewed by The Daily try
to solve the problem of insurance by purchas
ing high-deductible emergency health plans.
Bryan Schell 'O7 gets a basic level of coverage
from this type of plan as he works an unpaid
internship at the United Nations Refugee

Agency in Washington, D.C. He hopes the
internship will open doors for future employ
ment (and health coverage), but for the
moment he can only afford a basic plan on his
own.
Under Schell's plan, the insurance compa
ny pays for expenses after the first $l,OOO, so
it doesn't help with check-ups and prescrip
tions. In the event of a major accident, though,
Schell would have help with the ensuing costs.
"I'm young and I don't have any health
problems, so it's ideal for me," said Schell, who
is paying rent out of savings and small earn-
ings from a part-time job.
But underinsurance can be almost
as big a problem as being uninsured.
The Census does not project the
number of underinsured people, but
a post-college emergency plan, which
may be the only option available to
an alum seeking work, is sometimes
just not enough coverage.
Janes understands this better than
most. While searching for an employ
er — and a health plan to replace
Cardinal Care, the insurance he got
as a dependent of his parents and
mSpot's group health plan —he
enrolled in a high-deductible plan. It
is, according to him, for "car crashes
and chainsaw accidents."
The plan barely helps with pre
scription costs, a pressing matter for
Janes because he has Type 1 diabetes.
Insulin and testing strips cost him
$2OO to $3OO per month now, com
pared to $25 to $5O when he was on
Cardinal Care. He has started to
skimp on testing strips, resulting in
occasionally erratic blood sugar lev
els, and is now searching for employ
er-based health insurance as much as
for a job now.
"I've had to cut back on a lot of
medical care I'd been getting," Janes
said. "A group health plan to me is
worth over $l,OOO a month on top of
a salary."
Janes is watching the progression

of health care reform in Congress
with a particularly critical eye; among
the provisions in the House and
Senate bills that have both passed is
one that allows children to remain on
their parents' health plans through
age 26, instead of getting kicked off
during or after college. Janes, 25,
would appreciate that more compre
hensive coverage as he looks for
employment.
"That would mean huge savings
for me and much better medical care
than I've been getting," he said.
Through awareness of the reces
sion and the congressional health
care debate, Stanford students are
becoming more conscious of the
health insurance trouble their demo
graphic group steps into after leaving
the University. But the search for a
job, even one that does not offer
insurance, outweighs other consider
ations. In the minds of most Stanford
students looking for something to do
with their lives, it appears that the job
comes first, and health care comes
second... or not at all.
Lance Choy, director of Stanford's
Career Development Center, says that
in all of his career counseling, he can
not remember getting a question
about health insurance from a student.
"It just doesn't come up," Choy
said. "Sometimes they ask about
retirement, but I don't think a lot of
students think about health insurance
much in their 20s unless they've got
some sort of preexisting condition."
Seniors tend to be the most con
cerned with the prospect of finding
health insurance in the outside world.

Tommy Tobin 'lO was one of a hand
ful of interviewees who expressed
concern about his health insurance
situation after graduation. However,
it was clear which was more impor
tant to him.
"Work is a bigger concern," Tobin
said.
Lindsey Smith 'lO was also anx
ious about health insurance post-col
lege, She said a lack of health benefits
in one job could end up being a
deciding factor if she were to choose
between offers. But if employer
based health benefits were scarce, her
answer was the same as everyone
else's: she would take any job she
could get regardless of the insurance
situation.
"I would take [a job without ben
efits] if I didn't have other options for
employment," she said.
For students who are further from
leaving the "Stanford bubble," the
question of health coverage is further
from their minds.
"I've thought about what I want to
do and where I want to go, but I
haven't considered that [health care
coverage] very much," said sopho
more Colin Gray.
"I'm still on my family health
plan," said Eric Miller 'l2. He has
kept abreast of the debate over
health care reform, but said that on a
personal level, it hasn't greatly
impacted him.
"I'm focusing on my classes for
now," he said.
