# GOING GREEN
## Card tops UCLA thanks to 30 from Green 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Jeremy Green came into Saturday's contest
against UCLA with a sore ankle, a bruised fin
ger bone and a pulled back muscle. The sopho
more guard then proceeded to play one of the
best games of his career.
Green scored 30 points in 37 minutes for the
Cardinal (8-7, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference), who
earned a solid 70-59 win over the Bruins (7-9,
2-2 Pac-10) at Maples Pavilion Saturday after
noon.
"It's all good," Green said in regard to his
injuries. "I'm all good."
Green was definitely "good" the sopho
more guard went 11-of-18 from the floor and
seemed to make big shot after big shot when
the Bruins were trying to get back into the
game. He banked in a running three-pointer as
time expired at the end of the first half to give

the Cardinal a 34-33 lead going into the locker
room.
"That was just a huge performance by a
great player," said sophomore center Jack
Trotter. "He's really come into his own."
Senior forward Landry Fields overcame a
slow start to finish with 16 points and seven
rebounds. He didn't have the best shooting
night of his career, but he found away to get his
points, both inside and out.
"I was as proud of any kid as I've ever
been," said Coach Johnny Dawkins of Fields.
"He takes everyone's best shot every night.
He's never once backed off a challenge. He got
off to a slow start tonight, and the toughest
thing for any good player to do is to be able to
turn it around in that same game. For him to
turn it around in the second half says a lot
about who he is."

Sophomore guard Jeremy Green went 11-18 from the field, including 5-8 from long range to
earn his career-high 30 points. But the Card's bench didn't score a single point to help in the win.
Overall, it was a solid performance by the
Cardinal, who led nearly the whole game
and pulled away from the Bruins in the final
minutes.
"I thought we played well," Dawkins said
after the game, "I thought our guys worked
hard, followed the game plan and were pre
pared."
Dawkins also had plenty of praise for
Green.
"I give the young man a lot of credit," he
said. "He's played through a lot of injuries.
He contributes, he's competitive and I'm
starting to think he [plays well] so he doesn't
have to practice for me," Dawkins joked.
"He's got a big heart he's a big com
petitor," he added.
The unheralded Cardinal big men
Trotter and fellow sophomore Andrew Zim
merman also played well, finishing
around the basket and making a number of
hustle plays. Trotter, a walk-on, finished with
10 points on 4-of-7 shooting.
"I thought our big men were terrific,"
Dawkins said. "They grew even more
tonight."
Trotter emphasized the businesslike role
he and Zimmerman have assumed for the
Cardinal this season. "We're going to de
fend, rebound and set screens," he said.
"We're just setting screens and making

good, strong fundamental plays."
Sophomore point guard Jarrett Mann did
what he needed to do as point guard, only
scoring six points but dishing out an impres
sive eight assists. Though the Cardinal did
not receive a single point from its bench, the
contributions from the starters were more
than enough to top the Bruins on Saturday.
UCLA shot 54.6 percent from the field
while Stanford only shot 47.2 percent, but
the game was won on turnovers and free
throws the Cardinal shot 13 more free
throws and turned the ball over 10 fewer
times. The Bruins may have shot the ball bet
ter, but the Cardinal's execution on offense
namely, its ability to take care of the ball
was the difference in the game, whether
UCLA threw a zone or man-to-man defense
at it.
"This just happened to be a good game
against a good team, and [we got] a great
win," Green said.
Stanford earned a much-welcome sweep
of the Southern California schools with the
victory, and it stands, for the moment, in the
upper half of the conference before travel
ing to face the Washington schools this
week.
