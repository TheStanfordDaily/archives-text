# GOING GREEN
## Card tops UCLA thanks to 30 from Green 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Jeremy Green came into Saturday's contest
against UCLA with a sore ankle, a bruised fin
ger bone and a pulled back muscle. The sopho
more guard then proceeded to play one of the
best games of his career.
Green scored 30 points in 37 minutes for the
Cardinal (8-7, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference), who
earned a solid 70-59 win over the Bruins (7-9,
2-2 Pac-10) at Maples Pavilion Saturday after
noon.
"It's all good," Green said in regard to his
injuries. "I'm all good."
Green was definitely "good" the sopho
more guard went 11-of-18 from the floor and
seemed to make big shot after big shot when
the Bruins were trying to get back into the
game. He banked in a running three-pointer as
time expired at the end of the first half to give

the Cardinal a 34-33 lead going into the locker
room.
"That was just a huge performance by a
great player," said sophomore center Jack
Trotter. "He's really come into his own."
Senior forward Landry Fields overcame a
slow start to finish with 16 points and seven
rebounds. He didn't have the best shooting
night of his career, but he found away to get his
points, both inside and out.
"I was as proud of any kid as I've ever
been," said Coach Johnny Dawkins of Fields.
"He takes everyone's best shot every night.
He's never once backed off a challenge. He got
off to a slow start tonight, and the toughest
thing for any good player to do is to be able to
turn it around in that same game. For him to
turn it around in the second half says a lot
about who he is."

Sophomore guard Jeremy Green went 11-18 from the field, including 5-8 from long range to
earn his career-high 30 points. But the Card's bench didn't score a single point to help in the win.
