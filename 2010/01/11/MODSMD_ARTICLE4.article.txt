## Earth Systems hops to Hawaii 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
Say "Aloha" to Stanford's new Earth
Systems in Hawaii program.
Next fall, 20 students will be able to take
an environmentally-focused quarter-long
program in Hawaii that merges earth sci
ences, life sciences and Hawaiian culture.
The School of Earth Sciences and Woods
Institute for the Environment unveiled the
Hawaii program for fall quarter 2010 in an
e-mail to the Earth Systems mailing list last
week.
The Hawaii program is the brainchild of
Peter Vitousek, a senior fellow at the
Woods Institute for the Environment.
Vitousek was born and raised in Hawaii
and focused most of his academic research
on the Pacific chain of islands. He pushed
for a permanent Hawaiian outpost after
seeing the high demand for several seminar
trips to Hawaii he headed a few years ago.
"My trips were popular and the
Australia program is always way oversub
scribed, so I think that the Hawaii program
will be a great opportunity for people inter
ested in the earth sciences," Vitousek said.
There has been a boom in earth systems
enrollment in the past years and Vitousek
says that while earth sciences students can

choose from Bing's Australia program,
Stanford at Sea and field opportunities at
the Hopkins Marine station, "there are
never enough options."
Stanford's Hawaii program was partially
funded by a generous donation from Julie
Wrigley, a sustainability and environmental
philanthropist, to provide students with
field experience in sustainability research.
The earth sciences and Woods Institute for
the Environment carried the remainder of
the cost, which field program coordinator
Max Borella described as a "significant
investment" on Stanford's end.
The 20 students who will be accepted
into the 10-week class will leapfrog around
the Big Island of Hawaii for eight weeks
and end with a two-week stay on Kauai.
The program will offer three classes:
Hawaiian Earth Sciences, Life Sciences and
Human Systems and a three-unit independ
ent research project.
Students will begin the program at
Volcanoes National Park the home of
two of the world's most active volcanoes
where they will stay at a military R&R (rest
and relaxation) camp to study the volcanic
processes and erosion. The group will then
move to the northern end of the Big Island
for about four weeks to a house owned by a
boarding school to do terrestrial and

marine work, looking especially at rain
forests and coral reefs. Their work will con
clude at the island of Kauai where they will
stay in a field station a place Borella calls
the "Grand Canyon of Hawaii" with a
week-long final stop at a YMCA camp on
the north shore of Kauai.
"One thing I've found working in
Hawaii is that it's a great model. You have
most tropics and climate zones present in
one area," Vitousek said. "There are lava
flows that are millions of years old, spec
tacular gradients in climate and age of soils.
From a biophysical standpoint, you just
can't beat it."
According to Vitousek, the Hawaiian
islands are a microcosm of sustainability
adaptation: native Hawaiians managed to
create an agricultural infrastructure on
completely cut-off land without the help of
things like container ships.
"Hawaii's the perfect place to tackle the
question of how you build a sustainable
society in complete isolation," Vitousek
said. "Hundreds of yeas ago, Hawaiians had
to think about issues of global sustainabili
ty. They faced and met those challenges.
We're facing some of the same issues today
so it's interesting to see how they

approached it."
Borella says that logistically, the
program is "essentially ready to go"
and his team is working to iron out
administrative details like synchro
nizing the course curriculum so that
classes are properly cross-listed
under the biology, anthropology and
earth sciences departments.
Borella stressed that the Hawaii
program will be more integrated than
many other seminars, interweaving
the program's anthropological, cul
tural and biological components.
"We don't want the courses to be
discreet modules that operate inde
pendently," Borella said. "Each
course component from the ecolo
gists to the soil scientists to the
anthropologists will be connected
in a comprehensive way."
"What I most love about the pro
gram is the student interaction," said
Borella, who came from the non
profit sector before settling at
Stanford. "This is going to be an
experiential, hands-on program that
really resonates with students who
want to learn about Hawaii."
Jess McNally, a co-terminal stu
dent in earth systems and head TA
for the program, did both Stanford at
Sea and Stanford in Australia to
study biology and global change. She
said that the Hawaii program is ideal
for students interested in evolution
ary ecology and biology.
"The earth systems program is
growing so rapidly so it's exciting that
there's another option. The demand
is definitely there," McNally said.
"Plus, Hawaii's a fascinating place to
investigate both cultural history and
environmental history."
Johnny Bartz TO, a student advi
sor in the earth systems program,
agrees that the program appears
promising.

"It's great to be able to get that
hands-on experience and go out into
the field and do research," Bartz said.
"The Hawaii program sounds like it's
being designed by a lot of faculty
interested in ecology and biology and
could be an opportunity for students
to epitomize their passion for field
work."
