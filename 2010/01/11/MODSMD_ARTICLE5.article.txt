# HOUSING
## Winter housing crunch less severe All students guaranteed housing have been assigned 
### KATE ABBOTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After returning from a quarter in Costa
Rica, Molly Heft-Neal 11 faced a waitlist
and a series of walk-in meetings with
Stanford Housing before finally moving
into the sophomore dorm Toyon on
Monday. Heft-Neal was one of many stu
dents who found themselves on the
Housing waitlist after not receiving place
ment in a residence because they were
abroad fall quarter.
However, the annual winter housing
crunch has been somewhat alleviated com
pared to past years. A week into the quar
ter, all students with guaranteed housing
status have already been assigned to resi
dences on campus; a few students without
guaranteed status still remain unhoused.
According to Executive Director of
Student Housing Rodger Whitney, Stanford
Housing always sees a higher demand for
housing in the winter because fewer stu
dents choose to leave campus compared to
those returning from abroad. Housing
addressed the issue by preparing additional
spaces to be available ahead of time.
"This year, for example, in addition to
filling our regular on-campus vacancies, we
reserved an additional small block of apart
ments in the Oak Creek Apartments com
plex in order to house undergraduates very
near to the main campus," Whitney wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.

In addition, apartments are also avail
able to undergraduates in Escondido
Village. While these measures were taken in
previous years as well, the availability of
temporary housing to unhoused students
beginning the first Monday of the quarter
has also aided those still on the waitlist.
"The numbers of students waiting for
housing versus the vacancies available [is]
never a completely stable situation,"

Whitney said.
"There is much fluctuation in enroll
ment and occupancy over the first two
weeks of each quarter, as students return to
campus and/or depart for any number of
reasons," he added. "Thus, as vacancies
become available, they are offered to stu
dents who are looking for housing."
Heft-Neal expressed some frustration
with the process, however, because tempo
rary housing was not made available for
unhoused students until last Monday, leav
ing many without a place to stay for the
weekend before school began. She also felt
that students who go abroad with a
Stanford program are given a higher priori
ty
"It was frustrating, because when we
first got told we didn't get housing, we did
n't even know that was a possibility," she
said. "For our first meeting on Dec. 5, every
one was still abroad and we had to get a
proxy, and that was stressful because we
couldn't even go ourselves."
Heft-Neal was number 23 on the wait
list, and after sending a proxy to the first
walk-in meeting and two consecutive
rounds, she was finally given the choice of
Toyon or the Oak Creek Apartments.

deadline in October," Chen said. "I never

had any complications with
Housing."
According to Whitney, absolutely
no "re-stuffing" of previously
unpacked residences occurred, and
the Master Plan allowed for even
more spaces to be available to stu
dents with guaranteed status arriving
back on campus. "The uncrowding of
our residences was a major commit
ment of Student Housing as well as
the University leadership, and we
have not reversed this process,"
Whitney said.
"With the addition of the Munger
Graduate Residences and the con
version of Crothers Hall to under
graduate housing, we have 450 more
students living on campus this year
than we did last year at this time," he
