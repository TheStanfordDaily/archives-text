## Classroom to Courtroom TED ZAYNER '78 APPOINTED TO SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
More than 30 years after graduating
from Stanford, Ted Zayner '7B, a Bay
Area resident since he arrived on the
Farm, has found his calling.
On Dec. 29, Gov. Schwarzenegger appointed
Zayner to a six-year term on the bench of the Santa
Clara County Superior Court, whose session begins
Jan. 19, sending Zayner's career in a direction he
couldn't imagine when he first settled at Stern Hall in
1974.

Zayner was drawn from his home on the south
side of Chicago to the Farm in part because of mem
ories of watching Jim Plunkett win the Rose Bowl.
He spent his childhood hanging out on the side
lines of the field where his father coached high school
football in the public leagues he was 4 years old
when he went to his first game. While football was
not the primary reason for attending Stanford, he
said it "was one of the things in the back of my mind."
After graduating from St. Ignatius College Prep, a
Jesuit school in Chicago that he described as "almost
a magnet school," Zayner helped assemble an inde
pendent intramural sports league where he played
football, volleyball, water polo and soccer. But aca
demically, Zayner wasn't sure what direction to take.
"Like perhaps a lot of 18-year-olds coming out of
high school, I sort of had ideas what I wanted to do,
but it's not that I had thought out any kind of career
path," he said. "I kind of defaulted toward science,
muddling around in pre-med for a little bit, and
decided I wasn't going to survive in that."
In college, and even law school, Zayner never
imagined being a judge. It wasn't until fall quarter his

senior year, after he had flirt
ed with degrees in biology,
physics, math, economics and
engineering, that Zayner
start thinking about going to
law school.
"[At the start of my senior
year,] I was an econ major
with only a few classes left,
and then wasn't really excited
about being an econ major,"
he said.
"I wanted to go to law
school because I was interest
ed in that," Zayner added. "I
wasn't certain I wanted to be
a lawyer, but I thought law
school would be an interest
ing thing to do."
Zayner began litigating
shortly after he graduated
from the University of
California Hastings College
of the Law in 1983.
"I pretty much got thrown
into it and started taking dep
ositions [pretrial interroga
tion of witnesses] and prepar
ing cases," he said. "So, at the
outset, it was a little nerve
wracking."
For Zayner, the anxiety
hasn't disappeared, but it has
changed character over time.
"The nervousness now, I
liken to competitive nervous
ness it's not something
that prevents you from doing
the job and doing an effective
job, but it enhances your
awareness and your focus,"
he said.
Zayner recalled a memo
rable bad-faith insurance
case, which involved a year
long series of trials concern
ing chemical cleanup liability.
His firm was representing an
insurance company slapped
with a payment to cover
cleanup costs for FMC
Corporation's chemical pro
cessing sites.

"It was probably the case that shaped my confi
dence in my skills as a trial lawyer more than any
thing else," he said.
In stark contrast to his experience, Zayner
believes today's young lawyers aren't being "thrown
into it" fast enough or getting enough courtroom
time. Part of the reason, he said, stems from a crimi
nal case backlog that delays and drives up the cost of
bringing civil cases to trial.
"The courts in general are fairly overwhelmed,"
he said. "And they're overwhelmed with criminal
cases, which always have first priority, so it's harder to

get civil cases out to trial."
Zayner attributes the rise in court fees, lawyers'
billable hour rates and other litigation expenses in
the last three decades to a culture where a lot of
clients, especially large companies, won't pay for rel
atively inexperienced lawyers to try cases. Instead,
young lawyers "tend to get a lot of experience work
ing long hours and doing a lot of the grunt work that
has to be done to prep a case."
But working behind the scenes, they aren't learn
ing what it's like in the courtroom. As Zayner put it,
"they don't get the reward at the
end."

When cases go to trial,
Zayner believes new lawyers
should sit "second chair" to their
more practiced colleagues to
gain courtroom experience.
"When you go to trial and
learn to try a case in front of a
jury, it's a whole new world," he
said. "It's a gradual learning
curve like anything else you
grow more and more comfort
able in your own skin."
In addition to changing new
lawyers' roles, Zayner said the
high expense of taking civil cases
to trial makes it more likely the
cases will be settled out of court.
"The courts have more
strongly encouraged mediation
and negotiation alternative dis
puted resolution (ADR), a more
efficient and cost-effective
method of trying to get cases
resolved early," Zayner said.
Since 1991, Zayner has
involved himself in ADR both as
a judge pro tern a "temporary
judge" presiding over pretrial
settlement conferences that sit
ting judges don't have time for,
and as private practice judicial
arbitrator.
Zayner started applying for a
full-time judgeship three years
ago.
"It's a pretty daunting
process," he admitted. The appli
cation is four pages, "but when
you answer all the questions and
add a detailed resume of your
entire legal career, you end up
submitting 50 or 60 pages to the
governor's office. And then they
do their own investigation and
vetting.
"If the governor's office
considers you a viable candidate,
the state bar's judicial commis
sion interviews and reviews you,
and then the governor's office

does its own investigation and
brings you up for an interview," Zayner added. "And
then you wait and hope you get a phone call. They
won't ever call you again except to give you an
appointment."
Zayner got the call. He starts overseeing misde
meanor criminal cases at Palo Alto Courthouse on
Jan 19.
"That seems to be a traditional first place for new
judges to learn the ropes," he said. "I'm really look
ing forward to it."

clients, especially large companies, won't pay for rel
atively inexperienced lawyers to try cases. Instead,
young lawyers "tend to get a lot of experience work
ing long hours and doing a lot of the grunt work that
has to be done to prep a case."
But working behind the scenes, they aren't learn
ing what it's like in the courtroom. As Zayner put it,
"they don't get the reward at the
end."

When cases go to trial,
Zayner believes new lawyers
should sit "second chair" to their
more practiced colleagues to
gain courtroom experience.
"When you go to trial and
learn to try a case in front of a
jury, it's a whole new world," he
said. "It's a gradual learning
curve like anything else you
grow more and more comfort
able in your own skin."
In addition to changing new
lawyers' roles, Zayner said the
high expense of taking civil cases
to trial makes it more likely the
cases will be settled out of court.
"The courts have more
strongly encouraged mediation
and negotiation alternative dis
puted resolution (ADR), a more
efficient and cost-effective
method of trying to get cases
resolved early," Zayner said.
Since 1991, Zayner has
involved himself in ADR both as
a judge pro tern a "temporary
judge" presiding over pretrial
settlement conferences that sit
ting judges don't have time for,
and as private practice judicial
arbitrator.
Zayner started applying for a
full-time judgeship three years
ago.
"It's a pretty daunting
process," he admitted. The appli
cation is four pages, "but when
you answer all the questions and
add a detailed resume of your
entire legal career, you end up
submitting 50 or 60 pages to the
governor's office. And then they
do their own investigation and
vetting.
"If the governor's office
considers you a viable candidate,
the state bar's judicial commis
sion interviews and reviews you,
and then the governor's office

does its own investigation and
brings you up for an interview," Zayner added. "And
then you wait and hope you get a phone call. They
won't ever call you again except to give you an
appointment."
Zayner got the call. He starts overseeing misde
meanor criminal cases at Palo Alto Courthouse on
Jan 19.
"That seems to be a traditional first place for new
judges to learn the ropes," he said. "I'm really look
ing forward to it."

TED ZAYNER '7B


CTYLER BROWN/The Stanford Daily
More than 30 years after graduating
from Stanford, Ted Zayner '7B, a Bay
Area resident since he arrived on the
Farm, has found his calling.
On Dec. 29, Gov. Schwarzenegger appointed
Zayner to a six-year term on the bench of the Santa
Clara County Superior Court, whose session begins
Jan. 19, sending Zayner's career in a direction he
couldn't imagine when he first settled at Stern Hall in
1974.

Zayner was drawn from his home on the south
side of Chicago to the Farm in part because of mem
ories of watching Jim Plunkett win the Rose Bowl.
He spent his childhood hanging out on the side
lines of the field where his father coached high school
football in the public leagues he was 4 years old
when he went to his first game. While football was
not the primary reason for attending Stanford, he
said it "was one of the things in the back of my mind."
After graduating from St. Ignatius College Prep, a
Jesuit school in Chicago that he described as "almost
a magnet school," Zayner helped assemble an inde
pendent intramural sports league where he played
football, volleyball, water polo and soccer. But aca
demically, Zayner wasn't sure what direction to take.
"Like perhaps a lot of 18-year-olds coming out of
high school, I sort of had ideas what I wanted to do,
but it's not that I had thought out any kind of career
path," he said. "I kind of defaulted toward science,
muddling around in pre-med for a little bit, and
decided I wasn't going to survive in that."
In college, and even law school, Zayner never
imagined being a judge. It wasn't until fall quarter his

senior year, after he had flirt
ed with degrees in biology,
physics, math, economics and
engineering, that Zayner
start thinking about going to
law school.
"[At the start of my senior
year,] I was an econ major
with only a few classes left,
and then wasn't really excited
about being an econ major,"
he said.
"I wanted to go to law
school because I was interest
ed in that," Zayner added. "I
wasn't certain I wanted to be
a lawyer, but I thought law
school would be an interest
ing thing to do."
Zayner began litigating
shortly after he graduated
from the University of
California Hastings College
of the Law in 1983.
"I pretty much got thrown
into it and started taking dep
ositions [pretrial interroga
tion of witnesses] and prepar
ing cases," he said. "So, at the
outset, it was a little nerve
wracking."
For Zayner, the anxiety
hasn't disappeared, but it has
changed character over time.
"The nervousness now, I
liken to competitive nervous
ness it's not something
that prevents you from doing
the job and doing an effective
job, but it enhances your
awareness and your focus,"
he said.
Zayner recalled a memo
rable bad-faith insurance
case, which involved a year
long series of trials concern
ing chemical cleanup liability.
His firm was representing an
insurance company slapped
with a payment to cover
cleanup costs for FMC
Corporation's chemical pro
cessing sites.

"It was probably the case that shaped my confi
dence in my skills as a trial lawyer more than any
thing else," he said.
In stark contrast to his experience, Zayner
believes today's young lawyers aren't being "thrown
into it" fast enough or getting enough courtroom
time. Part of the reason, he said, stems from a crimi
nal case backlog that delays and drives up the cost of
bringing civil cases to trial.
"The courts in general are fairly overwhelmed,"
he said. "And they're overwhelmed with criminal
cases, which always have first priority, so it's harder to

get civil cases out to trial."
Zayner attributes the rise in court fees, lawyers'
billable hour rates and other litigation expenses in
the last three decades to a culture where a lot of
clients, especially large companies, won't pay for rel
atively inexperienced lawyers to try cases. Instead,
young lawyers "tend to get a lot of experience work
ing long hours and doing a lot of the grunt work that
has to be done to prep a case."
But working behind the scenes, they aren't learn
