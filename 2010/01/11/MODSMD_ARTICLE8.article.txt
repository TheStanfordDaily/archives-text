Girl 1: OMG, A BICYCLE HELMET!
Girl 2: THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
Girl 2: Wait... that doesn't even make sense. What
would that even imply?
Guy: Wait, so when you make a goal thingy in rugby,
you have to drink beer out of a boot? That seems dis
gusting and a waste of a boot.
Girl 1: I'm glad you have a cap on top of your fish
bowl because I used to have the same kind of fish,
but he jumped out and got all crusty and dead on my
physics homework.
Guy 1: Wouldn't that be weird if that happened to
Free Willy?
Girl 2: No, I think Free Willy would just super-evolve
if that happened to him.
Guy 2: Oooh, and he'd be all "ELLO, OIM FREE
WILLEH!"
Girl 2: Yes. Free Willy would OBVIOUSLY have a
British accent.
Girl 1: Wait, why don't you want to go to Tahiti with her?
Girl 2:1 want spring break to be girly shit-show times.

Sing too loud, dance on table, go to the beach. We
would probably just stay in watching movies. I'm too
young for that shit... I have a whole fuck-ton of
wild oats to sow ... in a non-spermy kind of way.
Girl 1: 0.K., let's make a truce. We can't compulsive
ly say sorry to each other anymore. No, we can't say
sorry AT ALL.
Girl 2: I CAN'T PINKY PROMISE YOU THAT.
What if Ido something really horrible ... like cut out
your LIVER?
Girl 3: Shoot, that would suck! You only have one!
Girl 2: OMG, YOU ONLY HAVE ONE!
Girl 3: One liverrr ... one hearttt... let's get togeth
er and feel alright.
Girl 1: Don't get all freaking Barb Marley on me
right now! You're not Barb Marley
Girl 3: Barb ... ?
Girl 2: OMG, YOU ONLY HAVE ONE. YOU
ONLY HAVE ONE YOU ONLY HAVE ONE.
Girl 1: You're not BARB Marley, nor are you 808
Marley. 0.K.?
Girl 1: Oh, BevMo, so conveniently located.
Girl 2: It's everywhere I want it to be. Except in my
room.
