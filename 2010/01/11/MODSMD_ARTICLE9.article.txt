## UNICEF leader talks Pyongyang Balagopal discusses problems facing N. Korea 
### ANN TYLER MOSES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Rare is the opportunity to hear a
first-hand, uncensored account of life
in North Korea. Students had the
chance to glimpse at the infamously
closed country while listening to
Gopalan Balagopal Friday in his
presentation "Beginning with
Children: Reflections on UNICEF's
work in North Korea," a part of the
Korean Studies Colloquium Series.
From September 2006 until
November 2009, Balagopal led the
United Nations Children's Fund's
(UNICEF) office in Pyongyang,
where UNICEF has been active
since 1997.
Balagopal's work addressed three
major risks for children in the coun
try: food insecurity, institutionaliza
tion and degradation in the quality of
services such as medicine and water
sanitation.
Food insecurity has caused stag
gering levels of malnutrition: in 1998,
60 percent of children were stunted
or underweight.
According to Balagopal, the coun
try's insufficient levels of medical
services was gruesomely illustrated in
a 2007 mass outbreak of measles.
UNICEF was able to intervene and
immunize 16 million of the infected.
In subsequent research on the causes
of the pandemic, the organization
found that 35 percent of the coun
try's medical equipment was non
functional.
Defective equipment also pre
cludes access to clean water.
"The water sanitation systems are
antiques they belong in muse
ums," Balagopal said.
UNICEF, capitalizing on the pos
sibilities of the country's hilly land
scape, created and installed energy

efficient treatment systems that uti
lize gravity for power.
The last of these problems the
prevalence of institutionalized chil
dren proved more difficult to
address.
"Abolishing all these institutions,
we understand, cannot be possible,"
Balagopal said. "But we can improve
the children's lives within them."
One of Balagopal's most treas
ured experiences during his three
years at UNICEF in Pyongyang
involved collaborating with the
organization "Art in All of Us."
Through a joint project, North
Korean children created drawings
and poems to share with children in
other countries. According to
Balagopal, the children's work con
veyed a surprising hope and desire to
help others, despite their own hard
ships. One girl wrote a poem about
flying a kite high enough for South
Korean children to see it and be
happy.
"Very often you don't know what
these kids are thinking," Balagopal
said. "You tend to demonize every
one, which isn't always the case,"
Perceptions of life in North Korea
can be distorted on a larger scale, as
well, Balagopal said, pointing to

ongoing problems with data collec
tion.
"There is very little reliable infor
mation in the country," he said.
Balagopal dismissed ambitious
figures from a census that stated that
as much as 85 percent of North
Korean citizens have access to water.
However, he affirmed the accuracy
of some unsettling information, such
as a sharp increase in maternal and
infant mortality and stagnant popula
tion growth.
UNICEF has been working to
compile a more accurate data set
the Multiple Indicator Cluster
Survey whose results will not be
available until March.
Balagopal said that the success he
saw in UNICEF's work and the opti
mism he encountered among the
North Korean people, assured him
that there is hope for the country
though the process of improvement
may be long and difficult.
"What is it that I remember?"
Balagopal asked himself.
"Individuals. These people who have
so little and are so touched by what
we can do."
