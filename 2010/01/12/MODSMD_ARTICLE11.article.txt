## ASSU airport shuttle posts $2,000 loss 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
More than 800 students bought
tickets for the ASSU airport shuttle
fall quarter, according to numbers
released today by the executive
office.
ASSU President David Gobaud
'OB, M.S. 'lO said the fall program cost
$13,108.86, funded by the Stanford

Student Enterprises, and brought in
$11,089.87 in ticket revenue, translat
ing to a total loss of $2,018.99 and
amounting to a loss of $2.37 per each
of the 851 students who bought tick
ets. A total of $7,000 was originally
budgeted for the fall program,
according to Gobaud.
The program sold 681 tickets at
$l4 and 170 tickets at $l6. The differ
ence between sales and revenue went
to eGroups transaction fees, accord
ing to Gobaud. The final numbers
may change slightly after accounting
for about $2OO in refunds, Gobaud

added.
The average cost per rider came
to $16.76 after ticket revenues and
the $2.37 per student loss. Last
spring, the ASSU spent $6,236 to
ferry 114 students to airports, with
ticket revenue totaling $1,238.04.
The executives compared the pro
gram to similar local options like
Super Shuttle, which charges $26 for a
ride from Stanford to San Francisco
or San Jose airports and offers a
Stanford discount.
The ASSU airport shuttle pro
gram began in 2007.
