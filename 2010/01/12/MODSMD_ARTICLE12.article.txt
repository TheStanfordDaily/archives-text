## EDITORIAL Health care bill offers direct benefits for Stanford 
### 
After nearly a year of debate within the
House and Senate, the Affordable
Health Care for America Act was
passed and will soon become law. This bill's
primary aim is to extend coverage to the
more than 30 million Americans without cov
erage today.
This bill has received stiff opposition from
the Republican Party. It is quite an accom
plishment to finally achieve some legislation
to address an issue that has been pressing
America for several decades. In close exami
nation of both versions of this bill, there will
certainly be some things that students on
campus will find positive and certainly some
that will be much less pleasing. The Editorial
Board believes that there are some aspects of
this bill, in particular, that will benefit the
Stanford community greatly, and the bill's
shortcomings can be mended in the long run
if we as citizens continue to follow the
progress of health care in America.
A major complaint about this bill is that it
presents immediate costs with delayed bene
fits. The bill mandates individuals to attain
health insurance and requires that most em
ployers provide insurance to their employees
as well, a system not altogether different
from the current system here at Stanford.
College-age individuals, for example, receive
a very immediate and significant benefit: ex
tended coverage for young adults, which
would allow college-age Americans to stay
on their parents' insurance plan until the age

of 26, rather than the usual 19 or 21. This
measure saves money for families across
America and will prove useful to many mem
bers of the Stanford community, particularly
in a time of economic recovery.
But the extension of health coverage in
this country must come at a cost to everyone
involved in the system. Estimates place the
cost of this act at nearly a trillion dollars, to be
added to the already ballooning national
budget and deficit. The most efficient path to
minimizing these costs is not to continue to ig
nore those Americans without coverage, but
to place increasing pressure on the health
care industry to make its costs more reason
able. The U.S. spends more than two times
that of other developed nations, per capita, on
health expenditures, despite the fact that our
overall health as a nation suffers in compari
son to Europe and other industrialized areas.
Now that this debate has taken place on a
national level, we hopefully have entered an
era where the issues of heath coverage and
insurance costs is something very deliberate
ly and openly discussed among the American
public, and not decided by an oligarchy of
politicians and health care institutions. When
the Senate and House versions of this act are
reconciled and finally adapted to law, De
mocrats and Republicans alike should not
view this as an end to the health care debate
in this country, but merely the beginning of
an enduring challenge to make health cover
age affordable and fair.
