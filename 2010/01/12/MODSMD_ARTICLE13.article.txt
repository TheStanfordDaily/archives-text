# BROADLY SPEAKING
## The 						Legacy of the Legacy 
### Molly Spaeth 
A friend of mine from back home in
dear, freezing Fargo came to visit me
this past weekend. I was ecstatic; I
love Stanford, but going to school so far away
from home in what my grandpa lovingly
refers to as the "Fruit-and-Nut State" (the
last time Nor Dak went blue was in 1964) def
initely has its drawbacks, namely that my
Stanford world and my past usually never in
tertwine.
But that all changed this weekend, when
Grant got a little too drunk after a particular
ly epic champagne power hour.
"Molly, you got into this elitist institution
because you're a legacy. There are people
smarter than you in North Dakota who
should've gotten in, and you know it."
The next morning, although Grant had no
recollection of it and we merrily skipped off
to have pancakes, the echoes of his drunken,
belligerent rant remained: a friend from the
past questioned my legitimacy in the present.
Here it goes. I'll finally, painfully admit it:
I. Am. Legacy. Not only am I legacy; I had to
use an addendum to fit in all my legacy con
nections on my Stanford application. I have
pictures of myself wearing Stanford pajamas
hours after I left the womb, and ever since I
can remember, I've dreamed of only Stan
ford.
This is not something I confess lightly. I've
done everything in my power to hide my
legacy background for fear that anyone who
finds me out may arrive at the assumption my
belligerent friend Grant made. While talking
to a friend (also legacy) last week, she re
marked, "I can't explain it, but something
changes when you tell someone you're a
legacy. It's like a falter; you can see it in their
eyes that their perception of you and your le
gitimacy has forever been changed."
As I see it, there are two main responses a
legacy student may have upon initial admit
tance to Stanford. There are those, like my
self, who do everything in their power to
keep their legacy a secret and perform in al
most frantic desperation to prove to them
selves and their peers that their admittance
was not a product of a family name. You'll
find these students among the most terrified
during NSO, pretending alongside their new
friends that they, too, had no idea that John
Elway went to Stanford (even though
they've heard about Elway's epic 1982 game
winning play five times a football season
since before they could even say the word
"Cardinal").
And then you have the others, who have
known since middle school that their accept
ance letter has been their birthright and have
used that advantage to its fullest. These are
the ones at NSO who look you straight in the
eye with their Christian Dior eyeglasses as
they proudly display a framed picture of their
dad receiving an award from Dick Lyman.
But then NSO ends, you start to get into
the swing of things and, before you know it,
you're far too busy trying to create the most
whacked-out thesis in IHUM to worry about
anything that mattered in life before you met
your tall, dark, handsome RA. However, that
occasional B- on a paper or a poor presenta
tion can always bring back the legacy insecu-

rities faster than Bravman can throw out
iPods at Mid-Year Convocation.
But all stereotypes aside, what can we
make of the legacy institution as a whole? All
it would take is one look at Dubya's track
record to make James Madison rise out of his
grave with a new Virginia Plan abolishing any
and all types of name-affiliated favoritism.
But it must be said that there have been ex
tremely talented families who have devoted
their lives and their passion to doing good for
this country, the extent of which may not
have been possible without the existence of
the family name (you gotta love those
Kennedys).
In any case, the legacy of the legacy really
comes down to what you make of it. Al
though it may have given me an advantage
on my application, I can definitely assure you
that my legacy status did not, unfortunately,
give my GPA any advantage while I was try
ing to fulfill my natural science requirement
(yeah, that was fun). But all in all, I'd say I
hold my own pretty well with the rest of the
non-legacies. Maybe I should just move on
and accept my legacy acceptance as an unfair
advantage I got in my youth one that
karma will be sure to make up for in the next
20 years of my life (dear sweet baby Jesus, I
hope not).
Stanford's relationship with its own lega
cy is extremely complex a relationship
that I cannot even attempt to fully explain.
And although I by no means wish to come off
as a poor, middle-class white girl suffering
from some poor, middle-class, white girl guilt
syndrome, I do hope to illustrate that at least
for this girl, a student's relationship with the
existence of her own legacy is a little more
complex than you might think.

Care to hash out the issue of legacies to a much
deeper extent? E-mail mspaeth@stanford.edu
for wine, cheese and the threats of institutional
ized institutions.

In my case, the legacy
of the legacy really
comes down to what
you make of it.
