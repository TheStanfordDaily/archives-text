# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Living Life in the Rearview Mirror

Roman, Byzantine, British. These are
among the great empires of European
history, the groups that influenced the
development of entire centuries of human exis
tence. Despite all of their glories and riches,
they eventually receded from prominence,
their power waning in a long struggle against
decline.The question of this decade, and indeed
so far this century, is a simple one: will America
be added to that list of former powers?
Ask that question to an American today
and the response will likely be "yes," accord
ing to a recent Rasmussen poll. The Zeitgeist
of the past two years has been clear, they say,
and their response has been equally strong
and focused. The Tea Party movement is a di
rect consequence of that belief in America's
decline, a demand to look in the rearview mir
ror to the 'sos, 'Bos and '9os and search for the
soul of a nation that was once ebullient and
prosperous.

Who, then, is to blame? The future seems
to be a tremendously frustrating and depress
ing venture. The economy I see is undergoing
creative destruction, but the emphasis so far
has tilted heavily toward destruction. Entire
industries have been forced aside, while nas
cent industries have failed to take hold. It is
not a pretty sight.
In the past, graduating college meant en
tering a world of opportunity and growth.The
humanities were flourishing, science and
technology were seeing tremendous growth,
the social sciences were experiencing funda
mental advances and businesses the world
over were experiencing flush profits. Ameri
can dynamism was exhilarating.
Today, few members of my generation will
stay with one employer throughout their life
times. In lieu of stable employment and some
semblance of a social safety net, workers face
a nightmarish environment of temporary as
signments, pink slips and eroding wages.

Even getting an advanced degree does not
insulate graduates from the vagaries of the
market. Law schools are still opening, despite
the reality that there are 50 percent more law
graduates every year than the market can sus
tain. Wages for lawyers can barely match loan
repayment demands. The answer is similar in
medical school, where debt loads are larger
than the upper quartile of home mortgages.
For graduate school, the answer is worse.
A Ph.D. used to mean all but guaranteed em
ployment at a university or in industry. Today,
graduate students in fields as diverse as Eng
lish, biology and political science cannot even
find a stable position that pays better than
their graduate stipends (a problem existing
well before the economic downturn).
If employment and the economy were the
only problems facing America, a little bit of
can-do spirit and some creativity may have
eliminated the problem. Unfortunately, it is
not the only problem, nor is it the primary
problem.
Our generation faces a punishing array of
issues: enormous national debt, underfunded
Social Security, exorbitant health costs, crum
bling infrastructure, failing schools, worsen
ing inequality and poor job prospects, among
a host of other ills. Frustratingly, politicians
continue to dither about what problems to
solve or whether to solve them at all. One
generation simply cannot shoulder this bur
den, not with the environment we face.

I understand the Tea Partiers. Our current
situation is pretty damning. However, it can
be easy to look at the trends of the world
today and conclude that America's time has
passed. It most certainly has not. We are too
dynamic, innovative and entrepreneurial to
allow that to happen so quickly.
But our resurgence can be endangered.
The current anti-government (indeed, anti
everything) response from Tea Partiers is
starting to reverse America's strength. Low
ering taxes has been a classic American polit
ical virtue, but it is deadly in a time of rein
vestment. How can one prepare the current
and the next generation for the world they
face when schools and colleges are getting
less funding every year?

California Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger recently recognized this in
his State of the State address, saying, "Spend
ing 45 percent more on prisons than universi
ties is no way to proceed into the future. What
does it say about a state that focuses more on
prison uniforms than caps and gowns? It sim
ply is not healthy." Too bad that he is a lame
duck with little political capital left to spend.
If America is to remain strong in the 21st
century, then this country must invest re
sources to sustain its power. That means up
grading infrastructure, raising education stan
dards, demanding school choice, controlling
health care costs and engaging our allies and
enemies. The answer to our problems lies not
with the past, but with our future. The Ro
mans, Byzantines and British looked to the
past and began a process of malaise and de
cline. America cannot live life in the rearview
mirror.
