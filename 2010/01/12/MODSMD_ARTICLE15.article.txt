## Make a difference, teach for America

£ £ r | "to be honest, Mr. Leblanc, you are
the best teacher I've ever had." I
-1- was taken aback when one of my
sixth graders told me this merely two weeks
into my first year of teaching. How could I, a
new teacher with only two weeks in the class
room, be the best teacher this student had
ever had? I soon realized that this student's
sentiments were not just a result of my lesson
planning and organization skills, but also re
lated to the fact that I looked like him.
After graduating from Stanford Universi
ty with a major in Urban Studies and a con
centration in Urban Education in 2009,1 de
cided to pursue teaching through Teach For
America in New York City. Teach For Amer
ica is the national corps of outstanding recent
college graduates of all academic majors and
career interests who commit two years to
teach in urban and rural public schools and
become leaders in the effort to expand edu
cational opportunity. Now that I am teaching
sixth grade English in the South Bronx, I un
derstand more completely the academic
achievement gap that persists along socioe
conomic and racial lines. Seeing the deficien
cies in my students' educational experiences
has highlighted for me that this is one of our
country's most pressing problems and an in
justice we need to address immediately.
When I first arrived at my school, I was
overwhelmed by my students' questions, like,
"Are you just a temporary teacher?" or, "Are
you doing this as part of college?" They could
not understand how someone like me would
want to be teaching them. Most of my stu
dents had never had a minority teacher be
fore, let alone a male minority teacher. This is
not unique to New York City and is a prob
lem that is evident across the United States.
With only two percent of teachers being
black males in this country, it is no surprise
that most students were shocked to see me in
their school.
Growing up attending a school with a 100
percent minority population where in 10
years I only had one minority teacher who
happened to be female, I completely under

stand where my students are coming from. I
grew up without any role models who looked
like me. I know what my students feel each
day, and this helps me relate to them on a
unique level.
As a result of my connection with my stu
dents, I have seen dramatic results in their
work habits and performance in only three
months. My class has gone from a 10 percent
homework return rate to a rate of above 90
percent. I have watched my students go from
reading one book in two months to now read
ing three books in one month. They are moti
vated, and my class is an active site of high ex
pectations and hard work. I believe that my

ability to relate to my students' experiences
as well as being a positive male influence in
their lives has had a tremendous influence on
their progress and accomplishments.
As a person of color and a Stanford grad
uate, you have the potential to be a powerful
role model for students like my sixth graders.
Not only will they have a profound impact on
your life, but your presence and commitment
can help guide them to academic and life suc
cess. I urge you to join me in the movement to
end educational inequity.
