## Head-to-Head: Is technology ruining competitive swimming? Advances in swimwear should be embraced 
### Danny Belch 
The world records set in the new
LZR suits shouldn't be removed or
asterisked. While I do not argue the
new suit's technological prowess
and advantage, I will say that technological
advancements aren't reason to start mess
ing with and questioning world records and
achievements.

Shall we erase all the golf records be
cause the equipment changed? I could
argue that golf clubs have been the most
technologically advanced sporting equip
ment over the years. Palmer, Hogan and
Snead played with clubs and balls that
Woods and Mickelson would laugh at.
Does that bring an asterisk to all golf
records with new clubs and the latest and
greatest golf balls? I hear nothing
about taking all the golf tourna
ments won and records set by
present-day golfers and moving
them into a separate column.
Do we put a separate col
umn for all baseball records
using the newest edition of
wooden bats in baseball, which
are better than in the days of
Ruth, DiMaggio, Williams and
Mays? And steroids aside, the
equipment for track and field ha;
improved over the years as well.
Today's sprint and jump spikes
embody the latest technology
for ultimate feel, spring and
power in each step. New dis
tance running shoes also
make athletes feel as if they
are wearing nothing on their
feet, just gliding over the track
smoothly and comfortably.
Both are a significant improve
ment over the shoes of years ago.
Some other examples include
NASCAR with new cars and new en
gines and skiing with new ski designs. If
we should call out swimming records
with the LZR, we should then consider
all the sports and their new equipment
as well. So where do we stop? Where
does technological advancement and engi
neering go too far?

You could argue back at this point and
say that the above technological advance
ments do not give an edge like these suits
do. Well I would say that is false, because
you really cannot compare. How can you
compare a suit giving you an edge in the
pool against a golf ball that can spin
whichever way the golfer wants it to?
I believe a lot of the controversy has
stemmed around some swimmers having
the suits and some not. If every swimmer in
the world was allowed to wear the suit,
would this conversation still exist? Perhaps
this conversation doesn't exist in golf or
baseball because every player now has the
best equipment.
But I'm straying from my topic here. Re
gardless of how many people have the new
suits, we are wondering whether the records
broken in the suits should count. I say yes. I
will not argue with the fact that the technol
ogy of the new suits is superior. It does in
fact give swimmers an edge in the pool. But
we can't start separating records based on
this. It would be simple in that all you do is
take all the records and move them to a sep
arate,"crazy suits" column. But it would not
be simple in that the integrity of the sport
would become muddled. Who is to say that
the only reason a swimmer broke the world
record is because of the suit? What if it was
also due in part to their new training regi
men or their new workout program? The
suits can't really help with some things that
are integral to swimming, like arm strength
and leg strength. We would then get into
trying to separate the suit's impact against
the impact of a training and exercise pro
gram. That seems to be near impossible.
Yes, there was a staggering number of
world records broken over the past couple
years by athletes wearing these suits. But to
take all these records away with the ban
ning of these suits is questionable in my
mind. That is pretty much devaluing all the
work these swimmers put in. Yes, the tech
nology helped, but erasing the records or
moving them to a separate column is like
saying that this new generation of athletes is
somehow just not pushing the limits of
human potential that each previous gener
ation has. By looking at the crop of swim
mers across the world today, I would have
to say that is false.
So no, the new world records set while
wearing the suits should not be removed. I
see the new suits as just a new technological
improvement to a swimsuit that helped ath
letes just as many other pieces of sporting
equipment did in other sports. Now, it's safe
to say that the technology in swimming may
have had the biggest and most widely felt
impact, but new technology has had a dra
matic effect on many areas of athletics. The
swimming records should stand. How can
we take away someone's accomplishment,
