# New suits taint swimming records
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
In February 2008, the sport of swimming
changed dramatically with the intro
duction of the Speedo LZR racing suit.
The LZR incorporated advanced tech
nology to make swimmers faster, including
water repulsion, hydrodynamic body posi
tioning and ultrasonically welded seams to
reduce drag. The suit was phenomenally

successful: At the 2008 Summer Olympics in
Beijing, 94% of all swimming races were
won by swimmers wearing the LZR.
Naturally, such a radical innovation at
tracted criticism fairly quickly. As swimmers
wearing the suit piled up wins and medals,
competitors and national federations who
had contracts with other manufacturers
protested that they were being put at an un
fair competitive disadvantage.
FINA, the sport's governing body,
eventually chose to ban this "tech
nological doping." Starting this
January, all body-length swimsuits
like the LZR are not allowed in
FINA competition (the ban also
extends to NCAA competi
tions). With this decision,
FINA agreed that the suits
were not in the spirit of the
sport, which they believe is
"essentially based on the
physical performance of the
athlete."

Of course, controversy
still swirls over the outra
geous number of world
records broken by swim
mers in the LZR and sim
ilar suits. Swimmers in the
suit have broken over a
hundred world records
since its introduction
(some have been broken
multiple times). At the Bei
jing Olympics, some swim
mers broke world records
without winning a medal.
This fact has led some to de-

mand not only banning the
suits in future competitions,
but also removing from the books the
records set while wearing the high-tech
suits.
This course of action is the only one that
can fully erase the damage done to swim
ming by the LZR. The purpose of world
records is not merely to glorify individual
athletes, but to show how each successive
generation can push the limits of human po
tential and ability.
Of course, athletes are aided in this
process by science and technology, with bet
ter training regimens and nutrition. Howev
er, when the athletes compete it is only their
own ability and hard work that should be on
display the suits give a significant artifi
cial enhancement that cannot be ignored.
Indeed, the FINA record books have be
come laughable, with new records being set
at an alarming pace prior to the LZR's ban
ning. World records are kept in 20 events for
both men and women (so a total of 40
records exist.) Out of these 40, only the
men's and women's records in the 1500-
meter freestyle have not been broken since
the start of the Beijing Olympics last August
and that's only because the 1500 free is the
"marathon of swimming," where individual
conditioning and stamina counts for much
more than in any other event.
If we include short course pools (which
are 25 meters long, half the length of
Olympic size but for which separate world
records are kept), 41 out of 42 records have
fallen since the LZR's introduction, the only
exception being the men's 1500 free.
The sheer volume of new records is an
argument in itself for amending the record
books even if the new records are al
lowed to stand, it is absolutely necessary for
separate pre and post-LZR records to be
recognized.
We can find even more persuasion when
we compare this question to other sports.
I've chosen two that seem especially rele
vant: baseball and track, which have both
been rocked by numerous steroid scandals
and allegations. The only difference be
tween using steroids or other drugs and
using the racing suits is the fact that the
drugs are illegal under American law. The
goal of both methods is similar: to gain an
edge over the competition, or to keep up
with athletes who have already "doped."
In baseball, many people agree that the
numbers from the Steroid Era are tainted
and should be thrown out. Most controver
sial are the records of Barry Bonds, who
holds two of the sport's most hallowed
marks, the season and career home run
crowns. While the records would most likely
be taken away (or at least "asterisked")
were the steroid allegations against Bonds
proven correct, the records must stand with
out conclusive proof that Bonds took
steroids. Swimming doesn't face this prob
lem: It was fairly clear who was using the
suits and who wasn't just on the basis of
