# HONES IN HEALTH

### ALYSSA AHLUWALIA 
Fourteen games into the season, the Stan
ford women's basketball team already
boasts an impressive 13-1 record, with
nine of the team's 113 victories coming
by at least 20-point margins. JJ. Hones's return
to the court has so far only added to already high
expectations this season for the No. 2 nationally
ranked Stanford.
"JJ. is a really talented player with a lot of
great skills that our team needs and it's great to
have her back," said Head Coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "She brings great poise to the team;
she's a terrific three-point shooter, a great pass
er and an underrated defender. When she's
healthy and she's here she's great."
Born in La Jolla, California, J.J. Hones was a
four-year letter holder and two-year captain of
her team in Beaverton, Oregon, where she was
named 2006 Gatorade Player of the Year. In her
2006-2007 season at Stanford, she was named a
Pacific-10 All-Freshman Team Honoree and
had a very impressive season as a regular start
ing point guard before tearing her left ACL 45
seconds into a game against California. Though
she was forced to sit out for two months of the
season, Hones ended her freshman career with
90 assists (ranking third on her team in assists),
only 31 turnovers and an average of 4.5 points
and 1.8 rebounds per game.
As a sophomore in the 2007-2008 season,
Hones returned to the court without any signs
of lingering injury. She was named All Pac-10
honorable mention and was a driving force be
hind the Cardinal's consistent wins.That March,
she went on to make five assists and three steals
in the Pac-lOTournament final victory over Cal
ifornia. Hones' physical recovery appeared to
be short-lived, however, when early into the
2008-2009 season she incurred her second torn
ACL in the first half of play against Rutgers
University. Stanford went on to dominate the
game with a final score of 81-47, but Hones, who
had sat out two of the last three games in order
to recover from a stress reaction in her right
foot, was suddenly sidelined for the season. The
5'10" starting point guard was forced to red
shirt the remainder of the season in order to
maintain two more seasons of playing eligibility.
Before her second torn ACL, Hones con

tributed nine points and six assists to the Cardi
nal's game against Rutgers. She averaged 10.5
points and three assists for the two games she
had played so far and was on her way to having
a red-hot season in terms of scoring and assists.
In November of 2009, Hones returned to the
court with 12 points against New Mexico and
has in recent games been a re-emerging force
for the Cardinal, gaining playing time as the sea
son has progressed. In this 2009-2010 season, she
is currently the fifth-leading scorer for the Car
dinal, averaging 7.9 points per game. As of last
week, she also led the Pac-10 with a 2.00 assist
to-turnover ratio.
Despite all of her achievements upon return
ing, Hones remains (unfortunately) subject to po
tentially resurfacing injuries. Just over winter
break, Hones was said to have hyper-extended
her injured knee during the game against Con
necticut.

"I wouldn't say I'm currently at 100% health,
physically," Hones stated. "But I tell people that

ask me how my knee's doing, 'lt's good enough.'
I keep a positive attitude about things I can't
control and just play the game."
The Cardinal's consistent domination over
other teams on the court is only strengthened by
Hones's return this season, but the team antici
pates that further success will depend on every
one's ability to step up and adapt to new playing
new positions and adapting to new game situa
tions in the face of team injury.
"Case in point, Jeanette Pohlen took over
the point guard position for me when I was in
jured last year," Hones said. "She transitioned
from the wing position to the point guard and
did very well."
So far, the Cardinal has only incurred one
loss against No. 1 ranked Connecticut and
it seems inevitable that Stanford be poised for
NCAA play this year.
