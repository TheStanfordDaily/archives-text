## Intersection redesign up for approval P.A. Commission considers plans for El Camino facelift 
### CHRIS HART 
El Camino Real may be in store for a
makeover at the edge of the Stanford cam
pus.
The first leg of a proposed improvement
project, which will be brought before Palo
Alto's Planning and Transportation
Commission for approval Wednesday
evening, is aimed at the intersection of
Stanford Avenue and El Camino Real.
According to the El Camino Real Master
Schematic Design study commissioned in
2003, the proposed developments aim to
shift the aesthetic and functional character
of the highway from mere motor vehicle
mobility to a more community-based urban
thoroughfare. The successes and failures of
this pilot project will inform future develop
ments of other stretches of the highway with
in Palo Alto's borders.
The draft plans that will be under consid
eration Wednesday evening seek primarily
to provide a more pedestrian and bike
friendly intersection. Installation will include
enhanced and textured paving of pedestrian
crosswalks, wider sidewalks leading up to the
intersection and new corner bulbouts, which
are curb extensions.
More aesthetically-inspired amenities
include ornamental street lights and new and
improved street furniture.
Jeff Bowen 'lO, a frequent patron of the
intersection's Starbucks, welcomes the
prospect of change. "I don't cross El Camino
on foot too often," Bowen said, "but I see
others suffer through the process all the
time. Any attempt to aid pedestrian traffic
would be huge."
The pedestrian-oriented project, howev
er, is not without its detractors.
Roger Pierno, a resident of the surround
ing community who drives through the inter
section on a daily basis, said that although he
favors certain parts of the project, he objects
to the elimination of right-turn lanes.
The current plans do, in fact, call for the
elimination of right-turn lanes west onto
Stanford Ave and south onto El Camino,
effectively resulting in increased delays for
motorists who frequent these lanes.
But Shahla Yazdy, a transportation engi
neer and project manager of the develop
ment, points out that since 2003, "the goal of
the project has been to make El Camino
safer for all modes of travel."
The Master Schematic Design study,
which was carried out in conjunction with
local communities, found that the combina
tion of high pedestrian traffic and the sharp
turn radius of the right-turn lanes made the
crossing at Stanford Ave and El Camino par
ticularly unsafe and thus ideal for improve-
ment. The project also has the sup
port of the California Department
of Transportation (Caltrans), who,
Yazdy explains, "would not approve
a project that would significantly
impact drivers on their roads."

Pierno, who attended the
December community meeting on
the proposed plans, is also con
cerned with the rate at which the
project is being implemented. "It's
on a fast track," he said, "And I just
don't think that there has been
enough public input."
The plan first got off the
ground financially when it
received a $1.3 million grant from
California's Bicycle

Transportation Account (BTA) in
2006. But if the final design plans
aren't submitted by February, the
monies for the construction of the
project will expire.
"It really is a great opportunity,"
Yazdy said. "We got lucky with this
grant. It would be too bad not to
take advantage of this funding."
