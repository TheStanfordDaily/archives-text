# Cardinal's O'Hara wins Hermann Trophy
## 
### SAM SVOBODA DESK EDITOR 
The season has been finished
for over a month, but the Stanford
women's soccer team just added
another first to its historic season
last Friday, star forward Kelley
O'Hara became the first Cardinal
player to win the Missouri Athletic
Club's Hermann Trophy, collegiate
soccer's most prestigious award.
O'Hara, who was named to the
Hermann Trophy "watch list"
three times before winning, beat
out North Carolina midfielder
Tobin Heath and UCLA forward
Lauren Cheney both Olympic
gold medalists last year to win
this season's award. The trophy
was decided by a vote from Divi
sion I soccer coaches.
"It's a great way to end the col
lege season," O'Hara told gostan
ford.com. "I'm so thankful, and
blessed. But the reason I was able
to get the award was because of my
teammates. I couldn't have done it
without them."
The senior was simply incredi
ble in 2009, leading Stanford to a
perfect regular season and within
one victory of the school's first na
tional championship. She not only
led the nation in goals and points,
but also set school single-season
records in those two categories, fin

ishing up with a final tally of 26
goals and 65 points, including two
hat tricks. O'Hara also put herself
in second place on Stanford's ca
reer goals and points lists.
The last goal that she scored as
a Stanford player may very well
have been one of the most impor
tant in school history the senior
drilled a spectacular long-range
strike in the national semifinal

against UCLA, one of two goals
that the Cardinal needed to over
come the Bruins and advance to
the school's first ever national
final.
However, the Cardinal would
end up losing in the final and
losing its perfect record against
North Carolina. The Tar Heels
took an early 1-0 lead that they
never relinquished, and O'Hara

finished her career on the bench
after picking up a second yellow
card. While that match remains a
somewhat painful memory, win
ning the Hermann trophy provides
a more fitting ending for the strik
er's collegiate career.
"This is a great honor," O'Hara
said. "But I would give it up to win
a national championship. That's
not to downplay the trophy. To be
honored like this is incredible. I'm
so excited."
While the Hermann Trophy is
certainly the most prestigious
award that O'Hara has scooped up
this year, it is far from the only one.
She was named Pac-10 Conference
Player of the Year back in Novem
ber and was Top Drawer Soccer's
national co-player of the year
(along with Stanford junior for
ward Christen Press), along with
earning a berth on various all-re
gion and all-American teams.
O'Hara's focus will now shift to
the Women's Professional Soccer
draft in Philadelphia next week.
She is widely expected to be one of
the top four selections in the draft,
perhaps even going number one
overall to her hometown Atlanta
Beat. The draft will be held on Fri
day, Jan. 15, at 7 a.m.
