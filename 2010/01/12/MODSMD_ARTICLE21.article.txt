he purity of the
game."
What a simple, vague term it is;
yet this phrase seems to single
handedly defeat 90 percent of pro
posed improvements to sports.
It all goes something like this.
Some referee or umpire or rule
book does something that infuri
ates two-thirds of American sports
viewers (see Joe Mauer's "foul
ball," Jay Cutler's or Tom Brady's
"incomplete pass," Chris Marinel
li's "clipping," Lawrence Hill's
"foul" or the 1.76382 trillion other
bad calls in sports history). Said
sports viewers then spend hours
upon hours complaining about the
referees and their horrendous
calls.

Until recently, this would be the
end of the story. Then a little thing

called technology came along.
Shockingly enough, computers
can do some things better than hu
mans can. Radical words, I know.
Proponents of keeping the pu
rity of the game have a simple
goal: to keep sports the way
they've always been. In some
ways, this makes sense. Sports
have been the way they are for a
reason and many things about
sports do not need to be changed
(remember the XFL?)
However, some ideas make
more sense than the opening
scramble for possession or the re
moval of the fair catch. People
watching televised games discov
ered that the replays they saw
helped them make calls that refer
ees could not make in the heat of
the moment.This has led to never
ending discussions over the merits
and problems of instant replay in

many different sports.
True, instant replay adds delays
and is not without its flaws. But the
most common refrain in the de
bate against it is that instant replay
ruins the purity of the game. It
sounds eloquent and noble, as
though allowing human error is
"protecting" the game from harm.
To me, this is equivalent to the ar
gument that censorship is "pro
tecting" the public from harm, or
that banning gay marriage is "pro
tecting" marriage from ruin. In re
ality, being narrow-minded about
technology, just like with political
issues, can deprive people of what
they need. In this case, people
need the right call to be made.
At their core level, referees in
any sport (except perhaps the
NBA thanks, Tim Donaghy)
have a sole purpose: to make the
game fair. Why not allow every

game to be as fair as possible? If a
call is clearly inaccurate, why not
let the right call be made? I under
stand that some people view refer
ees as "part of the game," but say
ing that is the same as saying that
bad calls are a part of the game.
And who wants to fight to keep
bad calls in sports?
Technology is complicated and
introducing it into sports is a tricky
business. How technology is im
plemented takes a lot of thought
and is not as simple as many peo
ple believe. But some things are
not extraordinarily complicated.
It's not hard to see problems
with the ways sports are refereed.

My own mother constantly points
out how ridiculous the chains are in
football. Think about it, a referee
who is often a good twenty yards
away from the play completely eye
balls the location of the ball and then
arbitrarily sets the ball down some

where near the play. The "chain
gang" then runs across the field and
sets down what is assumed to be a 10-
yard chain from the spot of the last
arbitrarily-spotted first down to see if
the latest arbitrary spot goes past the
chains. And this process decides
Super Bowls! You cannot tell me this
is the most accurate way of judging
first downs.
This is not to say that all referees
do a poor job. Think what a difficult
situation they are put into mil

lions of people around the world de
pend on their instincts and the only
tools they get are whistles and some
times a ten-yard chain. Innovations
like instant replay, the first down line
and the tennis shot tracker only
make games fair.
So what is better, a pure game or a
fair game?
