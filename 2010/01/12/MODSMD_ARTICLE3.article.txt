# Three groups evicted from houses during ski trips

### EMMA TROTTER MANAGING EDITOR 
Three student groups Trancos Hall, Kappa Kappa
Gamma and Kappa Sigma were evicted from housing
in South Lake Tahoe during last weekend's ski trips when
police discovered they had exceeded occupancy.
More than 50 freshmen and staff members from
Trancos Hall crammed into a house meant for just 16 peo
ple, according to resident Libby Burch 'l3. They were
evicted Saturday morning.
"It wasn't because we were loud â€”we were really
careful not to annoy the neighbors," she said, explaining
that residents stayed inside after 10 p.m. on Friday despite
the lure of the hot tub. "This neighborhood is just really

uppity about that kind of thing."
Burch said neighbors called the cops
the next morning when they saw a sus
picious number of students lining up
to take a shuttle to the slopes. Trancos
resident Alex Hertz 'l3 offered a dif- .
ferent account: that the police were
tipped off about the illegal num
ber of occupants by the driver of
the bus that brought the stu
dents to Tahoe. JF~

Burch was waiting in line
when three police SUVs arrived. One law enforcement
officer told the group they had to be out of the house with
in the hour, but the homeowner gave them until later that
afternoon.
Trancos ski trip planner William Greenbaum 'l3
defended the decision to overstuff. "There are many rea
sons ranging from tradition to cost to try to keep the
entire group in a single house," he said. "There is a lot of
precedent of stuffing entire dorms into 10-plus person
houses."

short at 7 a.m. Saturday for similar reasons.
A Greek leader familiar with the situation told The
Daily the group was caught because the number of cars in
the driveway tipped off neighbors that occupancy exceed
ed the amount specified in the contract. The Greek leader
estimated that both organizations brought around 25
members each.
The group knew not to put up a fight, said another
Greek leader, who had heard of Stanford students being
evicted from Tahoe houses in years past.
Students said the evictions were not that much of an
inconvenience.
"We hit the slopes for the day, then went home
Saturday night," Burch said. "It was kind of nice to come
back a day early and work all day Sunday.
"Still, it was traumatic," she continued. "Who would
have thought this would happen?"
"Our dorm is awful at planning stuff, so this is pretty
typical," Hertz added.
Most members of Kappa Sigma and Kappa Kappa
Gamma went home shortly following their eviction,
Greek leaders said, but a few stayed to ski and find lodg
ing for Saturday night.
Hertz said the weekend's evictions are unlikely to
influence future ski trip planning. "I think that when
dorms overbook this badly, it's so ridiculous that no one
could seriously learn from it," he said.
Greenbaum disagreed. "I think Lake Tahoe, specifical
ly Heavenly Mountain, is getting much more strict about
occupancy laws," he said. "The sheriff department is cer
tainly aware of the problem, and it is no secret when
Stanford has its ski trips. So, I think groups will have to be
more conscious of this issue in the future."
Burch suggested that planners be more straightfor
ward with homeowners, instead of waiting for the police
to get involved. "People will be a little more wary," she
said. "[Student planners] can just ask, 'Are you going to
