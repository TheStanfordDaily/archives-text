## Stanford Law School yields new start-up 'Lex Machina' compiles intellectual property litigation and policy data TROUBLE IN TAHOE 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
While the emergence of a start-up from Stanford
University may surprise no one, the department
from which Lex Machina emerged may: this legal
informatics private venture spins off from the
Stanford Law School (SLS), marking the first time
that a commercial venture has emerged from an
American law school.
Lex Machina is the outgrowth of a research proj
ect called the Stanford Intellectual Property
Litigation Clearinghouse (IPLC), officially
launched in December of 2008.
Founded through the interdisciplinary collabo
ration between SLS's Program in Law, Science and
Technology and the Department of Computer
Science, the project was the brainchild of Prof.
Mark Lemley, the William H. Neukom Professor in
Law and director of the Law, Science and
Technology Program.
Lemley, a scholar and researcher of intellectual
property (IP) law and policy, envisioned that the
program would provide free comprehensive data
on intellectual property litigation cases in the
United States dating back to Jan. 1, 2000.
While the IPLC was originally intended for use
by scholars, policymakers and journalists, it soon
became clear that the project had commercial via
bility and could not be sustainable solely based on
donations.
"The idea is that businesses and law firms who
want use Lex Machina at work would pay a sub
scription fee, but we would make the site available
for free to academics, judges, government officials,
nonprofits and the media," Lemley said.
Joshua Walker, IPLC executive director and
founder of the Stanford Center for Computers and
Law (CodeX), and George Gregory, an expert in
natural language processing, led the initiative in
building the IPLC program and database from
scratch. In the Lex Machina venture, Walker will
serve as the CEO while Gregory, Lemley and
Kenneth Lustig will serve on the board of directors.
"We realized the commercial viability of IPLC
two years ago," Walker said. "We were sitting in
Packard Cafe when [Gregory] suggested that this is
a company it had both private and public value.
We took it to the [SLS] Dean [Larry Kramer], who
ran it through the appropriate protocols, talking to
the Provost [John Etchemendy] and to [Lemley]."
The name Lex Machina derives from the title of
a research paper Walker wrote in 2004 and is a play
on the Latin term "Deus Ex Machina."
"Part of what we've done in the early stages is
build the technology to get to the point where
adding new cases is pretty straightforward," Lemley
said.
The majority of Lex Machina will be owned by
its team members, which includes engineers who
worked on the program and a handful of Stanford
students at the graduate and undergraduate levels.
But Stanford University and SLS will retain an
interest in the venture.
The company also expects to be
recruiting new talent soon as the
venture tries to "build out new
technology and expand into other
fields of legal issues," according to
Lemley.
"We want to maintain the fun

damental altruistic aim of IPLC,"
Walker added. "Part of our condi
tion was that we can spin this off,
but we should expand upon and
constantly improve the pubic ben
efits of the IPLC project."
Though Lex Machina is sepa
rate from SLS, the company
expects to stay closely involved
with Stanford.
"Stanford is the touchstone of
all of this," Walker said. "Aside
from the unique Stanford entre

preneurial spirit, it also had a top
law school and a top engineering
department."
"This is pretty much the first
time that a project between the law
school and the computer science
department has become a compa
ny," Gregory agreed. "This is a
major milestone for Stanford
University as well."
