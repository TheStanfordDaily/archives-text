## Economy conference draws focus to Prof. Taylor's work 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Stanford professors featured heavily in last
week's annual conference of the American
Economic Association held in Atlanta,
Georgia.
The event, which took place from Jan. 3 to
Jan. 5, featured presentations from many of the
top minds in the field of economics, including
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke,
Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Paul
Krugman and Yale economics Prof. Robert
Shiller.
Serving as chair of the conference's pro
gram committee was Robert E. Hall, econom
ics professor and senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, who is also the current president of

the AEA.
"The event went very well this year," Hall
said. "We accomplished all we had hoped to.
People don't like Atlanta, but attendance was
at an all-time high."
The highlight of the event was Bernanke's
controversial speech on the causes of the hous
ing bubble. Of central importance to the
speech was the so-called Taylor rule, devel
oped by Stanford economics Prof. John Taylor,
also a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.
In the aftermath of the collapse, some
argued that the extremely low interest rates set
by the Fed throughout the decade led to cheap
loans and reckless lending by banks, contribut
ing to the financial crisis. But in his speech,
Bernanke argued that insufficient reg
ulation of lenders, not overly accom
modating monetary policy, was prima
rily responsible for the downturn.
"Stronger regulation and supervi
sion aimed at problems with under
writing practices and lenders' risk
management would have been a more
effective and surgical approach to con
straining the housing bubble than a
general increase in interest rates,"
Bernanke said in his Jan. 3 speech.
The Federal Reserve is the institu
tion that sets interest rates, and
Bernanke has served on it, first as a
member of the Board of Governors
and then as its chairman, for most of
the decade. Bernanke's attempt to
downplay the importance of low inter
est rates to the financial crisis may tie
to the issue of the Fed's responsibility
in the development of the crisis.
Many who disagree with Bernanke's
assessment point to the Taylor rule to
support their arguments, which
Bernanke acknowledged through
directly addressing it in his remarks
The Taylor rule, one of the most sig
nificant equations in macroeconomics,
indicates what the interest rate should
be based on current levels of inflation
and GDP. Throughout the decade, the
actual rate set by the Fed was signifi
cantly lower than the interest rate pre
scribed by the Taylor rule.
Bernanke dedicated nearly a third
of his speech to a justification of this
deviation. He used a modified version
of the Taylor rule to attempt to demon
strate that interest rate levels were, in
fact, appropriate over the past several

years. His adjustments focused upon
the sensitivity of many data inputs that
factor into the rule, according to The
Wall Street Journal, and included a
shift from using actual inflation meas
ures to forecasts of inflation.
Taylor disagreed with Bernanke's
defense of the Fed's low rates and his
modifications of the rule. "I do not
agree with his proposed modification,"
Taylor told The Daily. "One issue is:
whose forecasts should you use? The
Fed's forecasts of inflation were too
low at that time."
Taylor also indicated worry about
the policy implications of Bernanke's
speech going forward. "His speech
raises the concern that the Fed will
keep rates too low for too long again in
the future," Taylor said. "That would be
a mistake because it would lead to
another boom-bust cycle,"
Taylor, who authored the textbook
used in Economics IA, has taught at
Stanford since the early 1980s, receiv
ing several teaching prizes. He has also
been active in politics throughout his
career, serving as the undersecretary of
the Treasury Department during Pres.
George W. Bush's first term.
Others, though, were more recep
tive to Bernanke's arguments.
"I think he [Bernanke] was basical
ly right," Hall said. "His interpretation
of the Taylor rule fits my thinking, but
it disagrees somewhat with John
Taylor. The question will continue to
be debated."
Another important function of the
AEA conference is professional, espe
cially for young scholars. Hundreds of
new Ph.D. candidates attend the event
every year to network and interview
with prospective employers.
"Job listings were down 20 percent
this year, but there were still lots of
activity in the job market," Hall said.

"Perhaps the most important purpose
of the conference is this role of bring
ing new Ph.D.s and employers togeth
er." About 15 Stanford graduate stu
dents attended the event this year.
"The event is pretty spectacular,"
said Bill Komiss Ph.D. 'O9. Komiss
graduated from Stanford's economics
graduate department last year. He
attended the event in 2009 as a new
Ph.D. looking for a job, and he
returned this year as a recruiter for his
new employer, the Center for Naval
Analysis.
"It's a great chance to listen to
research that you have been interested
in and to become interested in new
things," Komiss said. "The struggle to
get a job is a bit jarring. I remember
having 17 interviews in a three-day
span, spread across five hotels. There
was not enough Starbucks coffee in
San Francisco to fuel us all."

dents attended the event this year.
"The event is pretty spectacular,"
said Bill Komiss Ph.D. 'O9. Komiss
graduated from Stanford's economics
graduate department last year. He
attended the event in 2009 as a new
Ph.D. looking for a job, and he
returned this year as a recruiter for his
new employer, the Center for Naval
Analysis.
"It's a great chance to listen to
research that you have been interested
in and to become interested in new
things," Komiss said. "The struggle to
get a job is a bit jarring. I remember
having 17 interviews in a three-day
span, spread across five hotels. There
was not enough Starbucks coffee in
San Francisco to fuel us all."
