## Not a garden, a farm Proposal calls for new two-acre farm on the Farm 
### ADAM COLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Nov. 17, a handful of student
farmers gathered in Old
Union and quietly began to
sow the seeds of a small green
revolution. The students dis
cussed a proposal to build a new, bigger
farm on campus a plan that may
become a reality if approved by the
University Architect and Campus
Planning Office.
The proposal, submitted to the provost
nearly three months ago by Pamela
Matson, Dean of the School of Earth
Sciences, called for the establishment of a
two-acre farm alongside Campus Drive, at
the end of Santa Teresa Street. Students
and faculty will use the farm for education,
but they also hope to put homegrown pro
duce in Stanford's dining halls.
Christ Carter, Director of Land Use
and Environmental Planning, told The
Daily in an e-mail, "The proposal... will
be considered along with a number of
other potential uses and development in
an updated area plan for that part of cam
pus."
He expects that the Land Use and Real
Estate Department will present a recom
mendation about the project to Provost
John Etchemendy within the first half of
2010.
The current community farm on cam
pus is not particularly conducive to student
projects or large-scale production with
only one-eighth of an acre allocated to
undergraduate farming. According to

Farm Educator Sarah Wiederkehr, the cur
rent space is not large enough and can only
accommodate a few dozen student plots.
"[The current community farm is] basi
cally a big garden," said Briana Swette 'lO,
who has helped out there ever since she
took a sustainable agriculture class her
freshman year.
Swette, one of the leaders of Farmers
and Eaters for Equality and Diversity
(FEED), said the new farm will have room
for a greenhouse, tool shed, tractor and,
most importantly, much more cropland for
education and production.
Emily Bookstein 'll is another aspiring
farmer who leads the food and agriculture
division of Students for a Sustainable
Stanford (SSS).
"I'm really looking forward to the farm
as away to delve into agricultural educa
tion," she said. Bookstein also mentioned
that a new farm could help reconnect
Stanford students and community mem
bers with the means of food production.
For Swette, the visibility of the new
farm will help achieve this goal.
"Being able to see this farm is huge,"
she said. "Having a farm on campus will
help bring farming to the mainstream and
it reminds our community that farming is
an intellectual livelihood."
Swette and Bookstein were not alone in
their enthusiasm. This quarter, Wiederkehr
had to turn 35 students away from
EARTHSYS 180: Fundamentals of
Sustainable Agriculture, even after open
ing a second section. Some of the rejected
students opted to do independent projects
on the farm instead.

Wiederkehr said the maintenance of
such student commitment is essential for
the success of a new farm.
"In my experience [Stanford students]
tend to bite off more than they can chew,"
Wiederkehr said. "That could be the
biggest hurdle. That and the ground squir
rels."
Still, Matson said that the new farm's
primary goal will be to foster student
research, not to provide campus with food.
She envisions students developing projects
on the new farm to investigate nutrient
cycling, hydrology, compost, water holding
and farm systems.
"The farm has tremendous potential to
be a model farm in terms of ecological
practices," Bookstein said.
As they await the provost's decision,
some students and staff have already
moved forward toward farm preparations.
Financial planning is underway to raise
money for land development, soil condi
tioning and equipment. They hope to
break ground by fall 2010.
Bookstein hopes to spend this summer
helping any way she can. She believes that,
once underway, the farm will be a valuable
and essential asset of the Stanford cam
pus.
"To literally see how food is produced
that is something that will stick with
you," she said. "When Stanford graduates
are scattered across the world, they'll have
that little seed of the Stanford Farm to
carry with them."

Students tend the current community farm on campus, which Briana Swette '10
described as a "big garden." A proposal to establish a two-acre farm is currently
under review.
