## Students abroad fall quarter find it hard adjusting to classes, housing, lifestyle at Stanford 
### MOLLY SPAETH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
J anuary always marks the begin
ning of the rainy season and a
new quarter at Stanford. But for
many students returning from a
fall quarter abroad, the begin-
is not such an easy transition.
"I haven't heard a word longer
than six letters in six months," said a
dazed Justin Hefter 'll, after his first
PoliSci 2 lecture of the quarter. Hefter
had just recently returned from a six
month "Semester-at-Sea" program.
Cameron Poter 'll, who studied at
the Stanford in Madrid program and
had abided by the Spanish-only con
tract unique to the Madrid program,
wore a similar, glazed expression.
"I almost liked the classes in
Spanish better because it was already
understood that I wouldn't under
stand anything," he said.
Alas, the return to the reality of
classes is not the only hardship
returning students face. For some,
relationships and experiences fos
tered abroad were some of the hard
est things to leave.
"I had a lovely 65-year-old senora
that I fell in love with," Poter said.
"She cooked like no one's business
AND she really included us in any
family outings that she had. I got to
know her family really well, too."
Pamon Forouhar 'll, who studied
in Berlin, said that his experience
abroad exceeded his expectations.
"Everyone had said that going
abroad would change my life and I
was very determined to not have that
expectation," he said. "I went in with
low expectations and my experience
did end up changing my life. I don't
think that's always true, but for me
personally it absolutely changed my
life."
The return to the joys of Stanford

housing has also been one of the
biggest obstacles to overcome for
returning students. Many were left
unassigned until the first week of
school, while others struggle to fit
back into the campus swing of things
while living in off-campus housing.
For many, the two-day move-in that
Stanford Housing allowed before the
start of school proved to be a little
overwhelming.
"It's tough moving into a dorm
where everyone knows each other,
and I feel like everyone's already
used to school and I just came back
from the summer," Poter explained.
"I'm not used to my dorm or my
classes; I feel a lot more overwhelmed
than the typical Stanford student
now."
Katie Gera 'll, who studied in
Oxford, communicated a sense of iso
lation upon returning to campus.
"The worst part has been realizing
that life at Stanford went on while we
were gone and we didn't get to be a
part of it," she said. "Also, since now I
live in Oak Creek, it's really strange
to not have a home base on campus."
Lee Dukes, student relations coor
dinator for Stanford's Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP), said that
many students enjoy their abroad
experience to such an extent that they
make plans to continue their work
after graduation.
"A lot of students that I speak to
have enjoyed their time abroad and
many of them wish they could go
back there and even have a hard time
adjusting to being back on campus,"
he said. "Some students get motivat
ed to go back there and do so either
to do research, work or even do some
graduate work."
Forouhar, for one, agreed.
"It's much, much harder to be
back than I thought. It's great seeing
everyone but I could definitely do

another quarter abroad," he said.
"But it's also made me think of work
ing in Europe after graduation. I
would definitely like to take some
time off and go back and work."
But some students don't wait to
graduate. Many enjoy the first quar
ter abroad so much, they elect to stay
and do another quarter abroad.
According to Dukes, during the 2008-
2009 academic year, 43 students
stayed more than one quarter at the
same location, 25 students went to
two different locations (e.g., one
quarter in Madrid and one quarter in
Florence) and 63 students did a quar
ter abroad and then stayed to do an
internship in the location.
Although many returning students
have expressed their delight at
returning to Stanford and seeing all
the familiar sights and locations, the
transition from an abroad program
back to the Stanford bubble can
prove to be quite interesting and may
even produce reverse culture shock.
"Being immersed in the European
lifestyle for three months gave me a
new perspective on what it means to
be American and what cultural idio
syncrasies differentiate Americans
from the rest of the world," said
Robert Toews 'll, who is also a writer
for The Daily. "For instance, the more
laid-back and relaxed approach
Europeans have toward things
taking longer lunches, stopping to
chat more often and not being in a
rush all the time."
For those students experiencing
reverse culture shock, Dukes offered
some advice.
"Stay active in the BOSP program
and talk about [your] experiences to
students who are thinking about
going abroad," he said.
