## Skin cancer drug promising, says prof. Study finds common arthritis drug could help some skin cancer patients 
### IVY NGUYEN 
While staying out of the warm California sun is still
the best way to prevent skin cancer, a new study
authored by a Stanford researcher has found that a
common arthritis drug similar to aspirin can prevent
some of the damage caused by the disease.
According to a study by dermatology Prof. Jean
Tang published in Cancer Prevention Research
last week, the non-steroidal anti
inflammatory drug (NSAID) celecox
ib, also known by its trade name,
Celebrex, has been shown to
reduce the occurrence of ,
basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
in mice and humans. Tang's
study, conducted during her
time at UC-San Francisco from
2001 to 2004, involved 60
patients with Gorlin syndrome,
a genetic disorder that makes
affected individuals particu
larly prone to developing the
most common type of skin cancer
in the U.S., BCC.
Half the patients were given a
200-mg celecoxib pill twice a day, the
same dose prescribed to treat arthritis
and the other half received a placebo. The
celecoxib group saw a 50 percent reduction
in their tumor count and these results per
sisted one year after treatment stopped.
"It seemed like some of the tumors didn't grow as
big, or some of the tumors shrank significantly," Tang
said.

BCCs present as a new bump or growth and arise
from the top layer of the skin. These tumors common
ly occur on the face and neck, areas that undergo fre

quent sun exposure. Caucasians and those in sunny
areas like California are particularly susceptible to
developing BCCs: one in five Caucasians living in
California will develop a BCC in their lifetime, accord
ing to Tang.

Celecoxib works to prevent or slow cancer growth
by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which caus
es tissue inflammation and is one of the many mecha
nisms behind BCC tumor development. Previous
studies have also shown that celecoxib can reduce the
incidence of cancers associated with chronic inflam
mation, such as colon cancer and squamous cell carci
noma (another type of skin cancer) in groups geneti
cally predisposed to these diseases.
Well over one million cases of BCC are diag
nosed annually in the U.S., said dermatology
Prof. Susan Swetter, who was not
involved in the study. While BCCs
are not associated with a tendency
to spread to other organs or cause
cancer mortality and can be cured
by surgical removal, this and other
treatments can cause significant
disfigurement and discomfort, she
added. Recovery time is also an
issue, as is cost.

"The economic cost of treating non
melanoma skin cancer is enormous,
with an annual estimated cost of $2.5
billion in the U. 5.," Swetter said.
While celecoxib has been FDA
approved and spent over a decade on the
market, Tang warns against applying the results
of this study to people who only have a few
BCCs, since this study only tested celecoxib's
effects on Gorlin syndrome patients, who have
hundreds of BCCs.

"A lot of people might ask me, 'Gosh, the majority
of BCC tumors occur in healthy patients who are non-
Gorlins would this drug work for patients with one

or two BCC tumors?"' Tang said.
"We don't know that because we
didn't test that group."
Celecoxib has also been associ
ated with various side effects rang
ing from stomach ulcers to in
creased risk of cardiovascular dis
ease. The increase in the occur
rence of cardiovascular disease in
patients taking these drugs prompt
ed a 2003 recall of Vioxx and Bex
tra, NSAID drugs that are chemi
cally similar to celecoxib. Tang had
a study halted in the midst of the re
call, though her patients only re
ported mild stomach upset.
"A lot of that work has been
frozen due to [this type of drug's]

effects on cardiovascular disease,"
Tang said. "Here, we show another
cancer that can be reduced again
with celecoxib and we're hoping
that there's a renewed interest in
this class of molecules."
Tang also plans to study the possi
bility of administering celecoxib top
ically, by rubbing it onto skin, to re
duce the risk of cardiovascular toxic
ity that occurs when the drug is taken
orally.
Swetter said that Tang's re
search is taking place within an
emerging field.
"The field of cancer chemopre
vention, i.e. preventing cancer at the
outset in at-risk individuals, is still
relatively young," Swetter said.
"Studies such as Dr. Tang's do a great
deal to advance our knowledge."
