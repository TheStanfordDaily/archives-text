## EDITORIAL Make county alcohol exemption permanent 
### 
One year ago, Santa Clara County passed
a social host ordinance which would
fine home and property owners when
ever underage drinking occurs on their prem
ises. Stanford was granted a one-year exemp
tion so that the county could consider whether
the Stanford campus falls under the jurisdic
tion of the ordinance. With the court's decision
soon to come, the Editorial Board believes the
ordinance's language should be rewritten to
accommodate Stanford's unique situation,
rather than risk possible harm to students by
extending the ordinance to campus.
The University was originally exempt
from the ordinance because of the campus al
cohol policy and its success in preventing
harm to students. This policy remains effec
tive across campus. While proponents of the
ordinance may cite a slight rise in the number
of arrests and Minor-in-Possession offenses in
the past year as reason to extend the law to
Stanford, these numbers must be tempered
with the realization that the police presence
on campus has substantially increased in the
last year. The University's policies have
proven themselves effective, and thus an ad
ditional ordinance on the campus would not
be of any significant benefit to the campus
population.
The risks, however, posed by the addition
al ordinance threaten the safe and open envi
ronment the University Alcohol Policy has
worked thus far to promote. Extending the
ordinance would indicate that Santa Clara
County law enforcement would be present on
campus in addition to the Stanford Universi
ty police force. While not threatening in any
physical sense, student reaction would most
likely take the form of pushing drinking un
derground and behind closed doors. This dan
ger is what was envisioned when the Univer

sity Alcohol Policy was crafted as an open en
vironment where safety is the utmost con
cern. The presence of additional law enforce
ment has the potential to disturb the safe
campus atmosphere. The University policy
succeeds in that it is, in most cases, non-puni
tive and more concerned with the health and
well-being of the student population. This
goal would be lost beneath the more punitive
mindset of the county ordinance. If Stanford
is going to be fined every time one of its stu
dents is caught drinking under age, then fi
nancial and legal concerns may drive Stan
ford back into the days of being an officially
dry campus. In such an environment, campus
drinking would almost certainly become
more secretive, extreme and, above all, dan
gerous.
This is not a plea to waive the legal severi
ty of underage drinking for Stanford students,
but rather, a consideration of what will truly
keep the well-being of students at the fore
front of alcohol policy. The ordinance itself
was not written with Stanford in mind, nor has
the past year somehow changed the meaning
of the ordinance or the atmosphere of Stan
ford. Until the University policy is, in some
way, failing or endangering the student body,
it is best to stay with what is working. Rather
than renew the question of Stanford's exemp
tion annually, the wording of the ordinance
should be clarified to exclude the institution
of Stanford. In this case, the letter of the law
would better match the spirit of the law that
did not have Stanford in mind in the first
place. The Editorial Board urges representa
tives of Stanford and the County of Santa
Clara to consider these issues before making
a decision that will have negative conse
quences on the safety and health of Stanford
students.
