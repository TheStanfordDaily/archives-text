# GET IT RIGHT
## Global Warming Glossary 
### Erica Morgan 
Picking up the newspaper today and
gleaning useful information about cur
rent affairs is a daunting process. I find
this especially true for the charged subject of
climate change and energy politics. With the
plethora of propaganda and glut of contra
dictory "scientific" facts, a reader might easi
ly be lost in the heated discussions. Fortu
nately for readers, I have taken it upon my
self to compile a glossary of the more com
monly used terms and turns of phrase, which
will help the savvy student navigate the
stormy seas of climate cant.
I will explain each of the terms first in the
way they are most commonly employed in the
context of the environmental movement, then
present a more suiting definition for each.
"Green" (environmentally speaking):
"Go Green," "Buy Green," "Be Green."
Green is beautiful and natural. It means you
are not impacting your environment. Tech
nologies, cars, investments, emissions: we
must strive to make them "greener." A
"green" consumer is one who carefully con
siders his/her actions in light of environmen
tal impact and chooses the course that will
least damage our green planet.
The "Green" Reality: A nifty buzzword
that is spewed ad nauseam by political propa
gandists. It can be tossed out in almost any
context to fill the speaker with a sense of su
periority and self-satisfaction. A consumer
who purchases the "green" option is ab
solved of climate sin. A "green" car is a per
fect example. Buy a hybrid, and you need not
feel guilty about killing the planet be
cause you are doing it less quickly! Pur
chasers of hybrid vehicles may directly con
sume less fossil fuel than that dirty SUV driv
er, but they like to ignore the environmental
impact of hybrid production. This impact
comes in the form of mining and smelting the
heavy metals for car batteries in processes
that lead to air pollution and deforestation,
the pollution resulting from the disposal of
said batteries and, ironically, water consump
tion! According to one study, each mile driv
en with electric vehicles consumes three
times more water than the average gas-guz
zler. Maybe the future is not as green as it
seems? Greenies: put your money where
your mouth is. Your hybrid isn't saving the
planet, so climb off that pedestal and get a
bike if you're really concerned.
"University of East Anglia" (environ
mentally speaking): The climate research
unit (CRU) of this esteemed university aims
(objectively, of course) to improve scientific
understanding in "past climate history and its
impact on humanity, the course and causes of

climate change during the present century,
and prospects of the future." A trusted source
of evidence suggesting anthropomorphic cli
mate change, the climate research unit is the
recent, unfortunate victim of climate change
skeptics who, in their devious ways, seek to
dismantle the hard work of the CRU because
of a few mildly incriminating e-mails.
"University of East Anglia" reality: A
perfect picture of the problem with the
media today. The CRU scandal should have
been one of the biggest stories in this arena
brought to the public. While environmental
ists wring their hands over the lack of "bind
ing agreement" in Copenhagen, they com
pletely ignore findings that call into question
the need for such an agreement in the first
place. Times Online reports that "Scientists
at... UEA have admitted throwing away
much of the raw temperature data on which
their predictions of global warming are
based." HOW DOES THIS NOT BOTHER
PEOPLE??? How can a story of this magni
tude be brushed under the rug? We are
trapped in a paradigm of anthropomorphic
warming, championed by the media, the gov
ernment, leading universities and The Stan
ford Daily's editorial board. At the very least,
stop with the knowing claims of "scientific
consensus." Or, redefine "scientific consen
sus" to mean something along the lines of
"random assortment of scientists who pro
vide evidence (legitimate or not) that sup
ports the liberal political agenda."

Briefly, a few more:
A1 Gore: The champion of the environ
mentalists, he is allowed to consume what en
ergy he sees fit. His do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do
approach is acceptable because, hey, at least
he gives the global warming issue a "face."
Appropriate that it is a face of blatant
hypocrisy.
The non-believers: Those who question
man-made global warming are deceitful dis
turbers of the peace. They have no legitimate
arguments, but merely seek to obstruct the
greater good of all energy initiatives. It is sug
gested, at least by the Stanford Daily Editor
ial Board, that these ignoramuses have the
"truth" shoved down their throats. Maybe
this is a generous offer of education, but I
rather think that climate change alarmists
want we free thinkers to choke on their hype
before we can debunk it. I shall continue to
question the "facts," however, and encourage
you to do so as well.

Any more definitions? No profanity, please:
