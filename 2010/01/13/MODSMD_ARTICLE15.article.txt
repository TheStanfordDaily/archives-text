"When in doubt, go to the library."
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,
p. 255

It seems that when sophomore year comes
around and vehicular escape from cam
pus is finally possible, we Stanford stu
dents take advantage of every chance we can
get to experience the outside world. About
halfway through the quarter, sandstone
buildings, the abundance of palm trees and
the constant whirring of bike wheels become
unbearable, and we find ourselves fleeing
from the place we so excitedly flocked to for
answers about life. Interestingly enough,
when Hermione, one of Harry's best friends,
experiences similar sentiments and is desper
ately seeking to understand phenomena in
the world around her, rather than finding
refuge in the outside world, she is able to find
meaning and grounding in an already famil
iar place: the library.
At Hogwarts, it becomes apparent very
early on that Hermione's sanctuary is Hog
warts library. As the brainiest of their year, it
is natural that she spends inordinate amounts
of time at the library doing work, light back
ground reading and researching topics of in
terest. While she devotes most of her energy
there to participating in menial, student-typ
ical activities, she also turns to the library for
answers to life's bigger and more pressing
questions. In their second year, when an un
known monster threatens the lives of Hog
warts students and the school's operation it
self, Harry and Ron stand helpless in the face
of danger and are paralyzed (or should we
say "petrified?") with fear. On the other
hand, with a quick trip to the library,
Hermione is able to pinpoint the source of
the problem and respond accordingly, ulti
mately saving her own life. Her unique rela
tionship with the school library provides a
model for our own approach to Stanford's re
sources and suggests that the library can be
unexpectedly empowering.
At Stanford, our 20 libraries generally are
places for cramming, sleeping and streaking.
For the most part, our libraries are viewed
simply as quiet spaces where we students can
fully immerse ourselves in academic concen
tration. While there is nothing wrong with

using the library as a place to pursue our
studies, it would be a sore mistake to only see
it as such and forget what libraries are in their
very essence: a vast collection of knowledge
and a record of human accomplishments and
failures. What can so easily be overlooked at
times as we scurry about trying to find the
quietest, most anti-social cubby is this
essence and the extent to which libraries can

then tie us to the greater world.
As Hermione is able to recognize
throughout the series, the library has the po
tential to broaden her world, rather than
limit it. For us, it seems so natural to transport
ourselves physically to the outside world in
stead of realizing that this transportation is
possible with a quick trek to Meyer or Green.
However, if we take just a few moments to
actually take in the stacks that surround us or
to even pluck a dust-coated book off the
shelf, we might gain the perspective that we
so desperately long to experience off-cam
pus. The familiarity of the library suddenly
fades, as we recognize how insignificant both
Stanford and we are against the backdrop of
centuries of accumulation of knowledge. We
are reminded of the people who have gone
before us in exploring the fields that capti
vate us, and we are struck with an apprecia
tion for how much we do not and will not
ever know.
As mentioned, Hermione's ability to fully
embrace the Hogwarts library has startling
implications for her own life. After she runs
there to better understand the frightening
events plaguing her school, she is able to de
termine that a basilisk is responsible for the
student attacks, and she quickly takes pre
cautions to protect herself with a mirror,
which eventually saves her from a terrible
death. While Terman may not literally enable
us to save our own lives, it does have the
power to preserve our sanity and provide us
with the glimpse of the outside world that we
so desperately seek. Our libraries remind us
that there is more to our lives than the vicious
cycle of school and sleep deprivation, and
they push us to realize that our current and
future accomplishments are both meaningful
and significant.
Of course, if one still insists on leaving
campus to gain perspective, we'd like to rec
ommend a quick trip to IKEA. After all,
Hermione would probably agree that IKEA
Swedish meatballs and Hogsmeade butter
beer are essentially the same thing.

Melanie and Brian are lost in South Stacks and
have forgotten the Point Me spell. If you know
the incantation, e-mail mhom@stanford.edu

The familiarity of
the library suddenly
fades, as we see how
insignificant we are
against the backdrop
of centuries of
human knowledge.
