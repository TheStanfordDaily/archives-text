## Despite change, USC still a power 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
After being turned down by
Mike Riley, Jack Del Rio
and (maybe) Jeff Fisher,
and with their head coach
search beginning to look fairly
comical, Troy brought back a for
mer golden boy: Tennessee's Lane
Kiffin, USC's old offensive coordi
nator. That in turn prompted laughs
from many. Kiffin's well-publicized
spats with A1 Davis and the entire
SEC, along with a dubious record
as a head coach in both the NFL
and college, have prompted a none
too-flattering image. Which is all
good, except it means nothing. Kif
fin's hiring is a tactical move.
Why? He's bringing some seri
ous backup. His father, Monte, his
defensive coordinator at Ten
nessee, is assuming the same re
sponsibilities at USC. Monte Kiffin
is one of the preeminent defensive
minds in the history of football. He
literally created an entire scheme
(the Tampa 2) and is compensated
accordingly he was the highest
paid assistant at the college level
last year. But that's not all. Ed Org
eron, Kiffin's associate head coach,
will also be coming back to USC,
where he previously served as the
defensive line coach and recruiting
coordinator. All three have head
coaching experience at the colle
giate level. And then there's Norm
Chow, one of the top offensive
coaches in the country and a quar
terback guru, who may leave
UCLA to go back to USC ESPN
reported as much, but the Bruins
have said that nothing is certain yet
where he will regain his old posi
tion of offensive coordinator.
Chow and Monte Kiffin are
longtime members of football's
elite. So why is Orgeron such a
pain? Because back in the Trojan
glory days of the early and mid
2000s, Kiffin and Orgeron formed
one of the most potent recruiting
duos in all of college football
they put together the No. 1 rated
class in 2003 and 2004. In their only
season at Tennessee and after get
ting a late jump on recruiting, they
scored the No. 8 class. What does
this mean? In the short term, that
USC is likely to hold onto the re
cruits that they were in danger of
losing after Pete Carroll left
Kyle Prater, the No. 2 wide receiver
in the country, was planning on en
rolling early, but opened up his
commitment after Carroll's depar
ture, Now? He's back on board and
will soon be starting classes at USC.
In the long term, it indicates that
Troy's ability to attract five-star tal
ent won't be going anywhere. In
fact, recruiting may actually im
prove from its recent, still-excellent
level. And that No. 7 ranked class
Kiffin was putting together at Ten
nessee this year? Expect it to be
gutted by the Trojans.
The gamble is on Kiffin's abili
ties as a coach, as he has not yet
proven to be a great head man. But
he was wildly successful as a coor
dinator and certainly has the po
tential to lead. Let's also acknowl
edge that Oakland is where NFL
futures go to die and Tennessee had
a couple of stars but otherwise gen
erally mediocre talent when Kiffin
took over and he still got them to a
bowl game and a winning record,
despite playing in the ever-difficult
SEC. That run included a near-vic
tory over eventual champion Al
abama in one of the Crimson Tide's
two toughest games of the season.
Now, he is at home at USC with a
plethora of talent to work with at a
school that will do nearly anything
to win. And it wasn't too long ago
that the Trojans brought in an NFL
retread with a murky record to
coach the program, who also hap
pened to be their fourth choice.
The most curious aspect of the
move is that ostensibly, USC would
want a clean leader in light of the
Athletics Department's continued
investigation at the hands of the
NCAA. Kiffin, who has had his own
battle with ethics complaints, does
not fit that mold. All bets are off if
USC is sanctioned. But if they
aren't and the program proceeds as
usual, it should be fine even if it
takes Kiffin a while to pan out and
mature. Or if he doesn't at all, he

has still assembled a staff that will
keep USC afloat and prospering
both on and off the field.
How does this hurt Stanford?
On game day, they're competing
with Monte Kiffin, whose defenses
could be flat-out scary with USC's
athletes. Chow, if he does go back
to Troy, will have a nice little pet
project in the Ã¼ber-talented but
underachieving Matt Barkley.
Simply put, having Kiffin and
Chow together as coordinators is
just about as close to a dream team
as possible.
In terms of recruiting, the Car
dinal may not be hit as hard as
other Pac-10 schools. Their talent
pool is different, if only because of
academic restrictions Stanford
can't go after a lot of the players
that USC can, although there are
the occasional crossovers, like
Tyler Gaffney in 2009 and Jordan
Zumwalt in 2010. The issue is
mainly with USC's continued abil
ity to be the best recruiters in the
conference.
This all said, Stanford doesn't
inherently have anything to fear.
Since Jim Harbaugh took over,
they're 2-1 against Pete Carroll
coached Troy and no one would
put Kiffin even close to his prede
cessor's level, no matter his assis
tants. But for those who were hop
ing that USC's coaching turmoil
would prompt seasons of medioc
rity from the program, let's make it
clear: that is not going to happen.
