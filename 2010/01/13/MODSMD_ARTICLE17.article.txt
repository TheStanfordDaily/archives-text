# LOW POWER PAC
## Weak conference gives Card a shot 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Conference play in the Pac-10 is two weeks old and
here's what is certain: nothing.
Rather, very little. It's been long presumed and now
established that the Pac-10 is nothing short of awful this
season. There's a legitimate possibility that just one
team the conference champion, which earns an auto
matic bid will receive a spot in the NCAA Tourna
ment. For the first time in history of the poll, no Pac-10
team was ranked in the coaches' top 25 this week. There
is no alpha dog. Cal and Washington were supposed to
assume those roles, but the Bears lost at home to a poor
UCLA squad and the Huskies are currently last in the
conference with a 1-3 record. Unlike the Big East (or
even the football side of the Pac-10), where good teams
mercilessly beat up on each other, the Pac-10 features
mediocre squads struggling to rise above. It's a curious
conference where, it appears, nearly everyone has a
shot, because no one has distinguished themselves.
Enter Stanford (8-7,2-1 Pac-10), perhaps the hardest
team to get a read on. Since the season began, the Cardi
nal has had its fair share of close losses that could easily
have gone the other way. A last second running jumper
led to a two-point loss to Oral Roberts. Stanford came
within a made free throw of knocking off Kentucky, cur
rently the No. 2 team in the country. The Cardinal then
went on to lose by a single point to Oklahoma State and
went to the wire with Northwestern. It wasn't until Stan
ford squeezed out a win over USC that a close game went
its way. But flip those losses and the country would be
buzzing about one of the nation's most surprising teams.
Of course, that cannot happen and there are reasons
why Stanford lost those games. First, the Cardinal has
struggled with its free throw shooting all year, a problem
that has directly contributed to many of its losses. Sec
ond, Stanford is a young team still trying to find its way
at the beginning of the season, only senior Landry
Fields was a truly known quantity.
Even now, the lineup includes Fields, a former walk
on, a transfer from Santa Clara byway of Foothill and
two first-year starters who are both filling the shoes of
long-time Stanford players. The reserves are career
backups and current and former walk-ons.
So why is Stanford, a team widely predicted to finish
last in the Pac-10, currently tied for the conference lead
and sitting with a winning record?
First, Fields has fulfilled the potential inherent in him
since he first stepped onto the Farm and in his final sea
son, has become the quintessential veteran leader. He is
second in the conference in scoring, rebounds and steals,
but he's also eleventh in assists.
Second, sophomore Jeremy Green has become one
of the best sharpshooters in the nation. He single hand
edly helped the Cardinal stay close against Northwest
ern he's taken over 100 three-point shots, but drains
43.4 percent of them. As a shooting guard, that rate
would be good as an overall shooting percentage: to be
that efficient from long distance alone is eye opening.
And no one will fault the Cardinal's effort they've
taken all the doubts and transformed them into a posi
tive. It's a high-energy squad that makes up for gaps in
talent with its relentlessness. Sophomores Jack Trotter
and Andrew Zimmermann, for example, hounded
UCLA's Reeves Nelson throughout last weekend's con
test and held the acclaimed freshman to just eight
points.
The issue for the Cardinal is that outside of Fields and
Green, it's never clear who will pick up the scoring slack.

Jack Trotter, a sophomore forward, has been an important contributor for the men's basketball team so far this season.
Trotter has averaged 6.1 points and 4.0 rebounds per game, and he has provided vital energy and defense in the front court.
