Hordes of USC football
fans are lamenting the
departure of head coach
Pete Carroll to the
NFL's Seattle Seahawks. They are
left behind with the threat of im
pending NCAA sanctions and the
bitter taste of the Trojans' worst
season since Carroll arrived in
2001.
What makes it sting is that USC
fans actually believed that "Big
Balls" Pete might be the modern
college football enigma a coach
who is perfectly content to ignore
NFL opportunities and stay loyal
to a university. When Carroll was
asked whether he would consider
retiring at USC, he responded: "I
am prepared to do that. That's the
way I look at it, like this is the last
job I'm ever going to have. I ap

Pac-10 teams up and down the
west coast are celebrating the ap
parent end of the Southern Cali

that USC is currently engaged in a
lawsuit stemming from a former
assistant coach's allegations that
team doctors were irresponsible
with painkiller prescriptions. The

plaintiff's civil suit claim is suppos
edly in the seven-figure range.
While the thought of obnox

on each other's shoulders may not
garner any of your sympathy, there
is a lesson to be learned from Car
roll's exodus.
The message rings loud and
clear college football coaches
do not care about their players,
schools and fans as much as they
would like you to think. The same
ambition that makes them great
recruiters and motivators leads
their eyes to the big stage of the
NFL.
The recent decade has proven
that an NFL coaching gig is still the
ultimate goal for successful college
coaches. Carroll follows in the
footsteps of Butch Davis, Nick
Saban and Bobby Petrino a
group of coaches who had Super
Bowl dreams, but never even won
a playoff game in the pros.
It seems that except for a select
few, most notably Bob Stoops of
Oklahoma, the luster of building a
lasting and successful college foot
ball program has faded. No one
