Hordes of USC football
fans are lamenting the
departure of head coach
Pete Carroll to the
NFL's Seattle Seahawks. They are
left behind with the threat of im
pending NCAA sanctions and the
bitter taste of the Trojans' worst
season since Carroll arrived in
2001.
What makes it sting is that USC
fans actually believed that "Big
Balls" Pete might be the modern
college football enigma a coach
who is perfectly content to ignore
NFL opportunities and stay loyal
to a university. When Carroll was
asked whether he would consider
retiring at USC, he responded: "I
am prepared to do that. That's the
way I look at it, like this is the last
job I'm ever going to have. I ap
proach it that way."
Pac-10 teams up and down the
west coast are celebrating the ap
parent end of the Southern Cali
fornia dynasty. Adding insult to in
jury, Sl.com reported on Monday
that USC is currently engaged in a
lawsuit stemming from a former
assistant coach's allegations that
team doctors were irresponsible
with painkiller prescriptions. The

plaintiff's civil suit claim is suppos
edly in the seven-figure range.
While the thought of obnox
ious, bandwagon USC fans crying
on each other's shoulders may not
garner any of your sympathy, there
is a lesson to be learned from Car
roll's exodus.
The message rings loud and
clear college football coaches
do not care about their players,
schools and fans as much as they
would like you to think. The same
ambition that makes them great
recruiters and motivators leads
their eyes to the big stage of the
NFL.
The recent decade has proven
that an NFL coaching gig is still the
ultimate goal for successful college
coaches. Carroll follows in the
footsteps of Butch Davis, Nick
Saban and Bobby Petrino a
group of coaches who had Super
Bowl dreams, but never even won
a playoff game in the pros.
It seems that except for a select
few, most notably Bob Stoops of
Oklahoma, the luster of building a
lasting and successful college foot
ball program has faded. No one
wants to be Joe Paterno or Bobby
Bowden anymore.
The unfortunate reality for Stan
ford football fans is that every win
brings an NFL team closer and closer
to offering Jim Harbaugh a deal he
cannot refuse. Harbaugh has orches
trated a miracle turnaround at Stan
ford. With success comes national at
tention and rumors that Harbaugh
will join his older brother John as an
NFL coach.
Don't be fooled by Harbaugh's re
cent contract extension and declara
tion of loyalty:
"My resolve and future proudly
remains as head coach at Stanford
University .. I'm a Stanford man."
These comments should be taken
about as seriously as a headline in the
Stanford Flipside. First of all, Har
baugh is most definitely a Michigan
man. He played quarterback for the
Wolverines and idolizes legendary
Michigan coach Bo Schembechler.
And if you think he wouldn't ditch

the Farm for an NFL head-coaching
job, look up at the ceiling it says
"gullible."
There's no reason to be mad about
Flarbaugh's misleading statements
in fact, they're in our best interest.
It's crucial that recruits believe that
Flarbaugh will be around for their en
tire college careers.
Stanford fans have a choice to
make. We can be like Ed Flelms' char
acter, Stu Price, in "The Hangover."
We can spend every moment of our
waking lives fearing that we're going
to get dumped. If you've seen the
movie, you know that this approach
doesn't work out.
Or we can accept the inevitable
Jim Harbaugh's time as the head
coach of Stanford football is coming
to an end in the near future and
enjoy the time we have left.
Make sure to appreciate Har
baugh's red-faced rants at officials
and questionable 4th down decisions.
He'll be leaving the Farm before you
know it.

Jack Duane just got himself into a duel
with Wyndam Makowsky over Har
baugh's honor. Wish him well at jdu
ane@stanford. edu.
