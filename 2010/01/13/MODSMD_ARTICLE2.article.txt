## For Karl's students, hands on human rights Professor, helpers travel to El Salvador and beyond for investigation and, they hope, justice 
### CRISTIANA GIANNINI 
In Terry Karl's human rights investigations, "stu
dent involvement has always been critical."
That was Karl's message at a forum Tuesday to
showcase her work with a team of Stanford students
in the ongoing investigations of the 1989 "Jesuit
massacre" in El Salvador.
Karl, a professor of Latin American studies and
political science, recently returned from Madrid,
where she presented evidence against former
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani Bukard and
14 former military officers. The case is being tried in
front of the Spanish National Court under the prin
ciple of universal jurisdiction.
The former officials may be found guilty of
crimes against humanity and state terrorism for
their roles in the murder of six Jesuit priests, their
housekeeper and her young daughter. The atrocity
took place during El Salvador's violent 12-year civil
war, which pitted right-wing government death
squads against leftist guerillas. The war caused the
deaths of over 75,000 civilians, according to the Web

site of the Center for Justice and Accountability
(CJA), one of the international human rights associ
ations heavily involved in the case.
A 1993 amnesty law still in effect in El Salvador
protects war-time participants from prosecution for
human rights abuses within the country, and
although Karl's stated ideal case would put justice
"as close to the crimes as possible" —on El
Salvadoran soil political hesitancy arises from
the fact that "the people being charged actually
have real power today."
Alexie Dunaway 'll, one of the student
researchers who has been busily sorting through
piles of documents in pursuit of evidence for the
case, traveled to El Salvador last November for the
20th anniversary of the atrocity. There he met the
sister of one of the murdered priests, visited the site
of the massacre, which has since been transformed
into a rose garden, and was hugged and applauded
by El Salvadoran villagers in one of the towns
where he was delivering flood relief aid. The trip
"really lent a sense of reality to everything I had
been doing over the last three months," Dunaway
said.
Another student researcher, Mason Flink 'lO, has

incorporated his experience into a
creative senior thesis project that
includes both theatrical and social
science components. He is writing
a screenplay based on U.S. involve
ment in the cover-up of the mur
ders, and believes that "justice is
such a complex thing that there is
no way to tackle it except from an
interdisciplinary perspective."
The team also includes Nadia
Mufti 'll, who used her graphic
design skills to organize and pres
ent the evidence, as well as Fabiola
Puerta 'O7, who translated docu
ments and constructed appendices
to be used at the trial.
Karl stressed on Tuesday the
importance of students' commit
ment to the project. The forum
opened with an introduction to the
Center for Democracy,
Development and the Rule of
Law's new Program on Human
Rights, which is now offering
human rights fellowships to under
graduates.
