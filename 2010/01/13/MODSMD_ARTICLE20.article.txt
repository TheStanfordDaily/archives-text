# College coaches setting bad example
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
On Monday, my colleague
Dan Bohm wrote a col
umn criticizing the recent
firings of three promi
nent college football coaches as just
another example of how modern
sports are "too soft." While I agree
with Bohm's argument and have no
problem with a coach showing a
player a little tough love (this col
umn has previously called out Stan
ford intramural sports for contribut
ing to the softening of its students),
we need to ask ourselves if these
coaches are the men we want raising
the next generation of adults.
I obviously do not condone lock
ing players in storage closets, making
players crawl on sun-scorched As
troturf until their hands are burnt or
physically assaulting players, but I
believe there are worse things for
players to be subjected to.
Like their coach deserting them
for more money.
The hottest trend in college foot
ball since the spread offense has
been coaches skipping out on the
final years of their contract to take a
job at a more prestigious program.
What message does that send to
their players?
This one: When an opportunity

presents itself to add a few more ze
roes to your bank account, by all
means go ahead and stab in the back
an institution that gave you a chance.
The most glaring example is the
case of Brian Kelly at the University
of Cincinnati. In his fourth season at
Cincinnati, Kelly had his preseason
unranked Bearcats sitting at a per
fect 12-0 and a date against the Flori
da Gators in the Sugar Bowl. On the
cusp of the most important football
game in the history of the school,
Kelly decided to leave. Just packed
his bags and hightailed it to his new
higher paying coaching gig at Notre
Dame.
Predictably, Cincinnati was sys
tematically dismantled by Florida,
51-24.
When a coach goes on a recruit
ing trip, he tries to sell the player on
the program. "Hey five-star recruit, I
want you to be part of the (insert
school name) family. Here at (school
name), we don't look at you as just a
player, we treat you like a brother
and a son."
Sounds good. Until Pete Caroll
bounces to the NFL before the
NCAA doles out sanctions for al-
leged violations by Reggie Bush and
Joe McKnight.
Sounds good. Until Rich Ro
driguez signs a contract with Michi
gan, refuses to coach West Virginia in
the Fiesta Bowl and then refuses to
pay his buyout clause to WVU.
Sounds good. Until Bobby Petri
no, only six months after signing a
10-year contract with Louisville,
leaves the Cardinals to coach the At
lanta Falcons.
These are the coaches who are
supposed to be shaping young men
into strong adults?
Even if these coaches were not
role models and father figures for
the players, there is still an ethical
reason for honoring their contracts.
When a university signs a coach to a
multiyear contract, it is taking a gam
ble. No matter how bad a coach turns
out to be, the university still must pay
the contract (or pay a ridiculously
high buyout).
Either way, the coach is guaran
teed a set amount of money regard
less of performance. In turn, the
coach tells the university, no matter
how good he turns out to be, he will
continue to work for the university
at the agreed upon rate, for the
agreed upon time.
Apparently these coaches play by
a different set of rules. And by that, I
mean no rules.
Is it really any wonder there are
players like Brandon Marshall and
JaMarcus Russell me-first,
money-hungry, locker room detrac
tors — in the NFL? Where do you
think they learned their selfish be
havior? From their me-first, money
hungry college football coaches.
With all due respect, a bruise
from a coach's punch will fade away.
The lessons players learn from their
coaches do not.
