# College coaches setting bad example
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
On Monday, my colleague
Dan Bohm wrote a col
umn criticizing the recent
firings of three promi
nent college football coaches as just
another example of how modern
sports are "too soft." While I agree
with Bohm's argument and have no
problem with a coach showing a
player a little tough love (this col
umn has previously called out Stan
ford intramural sports for contribut
ing to the softening of its students),
we need to ask ourselves if these
coaches are the men we want raising
the next generation of adults.
I obviously do not condone lock
ing players in storage closets, making
players crawl on sun-scorched As
troturf until their hands are burnt or
physically assaulting players, but I
believe there are worse things for
players to be subjected to.
Like their coach deserting them
for more money.
The hottest trend in college foot
ball since the spread offense has
been coaches skipping out on the
final years of their contract to take a
job at a more prestigious program.
What message does that send to
their players?
This one: When an opportunity

presents itself to add a few more ze
roes to your bank account, by all
means go ahead and stab in the back
an institution that gave you a chance.
The most glaring example is the
case of Brian Kelly at the University
of Cincinnati. In his fourth season at
Cincinnati, Kelly had his preseason
unranked Bearcats sitting at a per
fect 12-0 and a date against the Flori
da Gators in the Sugar Bowl. On the
cusp of the most important football
game in the history of the school,
Kelly decided to leave. Just packed
his bags and hightailed it to his new
higher paying coaching gig at Notre
Dame.
Predictably, Cincinnati was sys
tematically dismantled by Florida,
51-24.
When a coach goes on a recruit
ing trip, he tries to sell the player on
the program. "Hey five-star recruit, I
want you to be part of the (insert
school name) family. Here at (school
name), we don't look at you as just a
player, we treat you like a brother
and a son."
Sounds good. Until Pete Caroll
