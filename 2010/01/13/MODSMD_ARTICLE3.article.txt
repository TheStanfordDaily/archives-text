# California budget schools over prisons?
## Stanford profs. say challenges abound for governor's pitch 
### CAROLINE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford professors say an amendment to
the California constitution proposed by
Governor Schwarzenegger that would
require the state to invest more money in its
public universities than its prisons will face
many challenges before becoming actual
legislation.
The proposal, which has been both laud
ed and criticized since the governor's State
of the State address last Wednesday, would
require California to spend no less than 10
percent of its annual budget on higher edu
cation and no more than seven percent on
prisons. It would nearly reverse the current
situation: 7.5 percent and 11 percent of the
budget are allotted to universities and pris
ons, respectively.
"The priorities have become out of
whack over the years," Schwarzenegger said
in his address. "What does it say about a
state that focuses more on prison uniforms
than caps and gowns?"
Schwarzenegger's proposal comes at a
time of turmoil within the California higher
education system. In December, both the
University of California and California
State University systems increased tuition
by 32 percent, sparking protests and riots
across the UC campuses.
UC President Mark Yudof issued a state
ment hailing Schwarzenegger's proposal as "a
bold and visionary plan." UC Regents
Chairman Russell Gould also called upon the
state to end its "chronic disinvestment" in
higher education.
Prof. Prudence Carter of Stanford's
School of Education said she supports the
proposal, explaining that in California,

Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger delivered the State of the State address last Wednesday in Sacramento. The governor proposed
that the state spend at least 10 percent of its budget on education and no more than seven percent on prisons, which would nearly
reverse the current spending ratio.
increasing numbers of young males
from disadvantaged backgrounds
are dropping out of school and
engaging in criminal activity.
"In some districts, less than 50
percent of the students are graduat
ing from high school," she said. "We
have to stop this trend of drop-outs
feeding the prison system."
She hopes that increased support
for higher education will have a
trickle-down effect, and that the
funding will end the tuition hikes
that discourage disadvantaged stu
dents from attending college.
At the same time, it is question
able whether the California prison
system can afford the cuts.
California prisons have suffered
from overcrowding for years. From

1982 to 2000, the prison population
grew by 500 percent. Currently,
more than 170,000 prisoners occupy
facilities designed for 83,000 people.
In addition, each inmate costs
about $50,000 a year to incarcerate,
an amount that increases as much as
three times for inmates over the age
of 55 due to age-related illnesses. By
comparison, inmates in other states
cost, on average, $32,000 a year.
Enacting the amendment would
require California voters to approve
some controversial reforms.
"The budget is not just a pie that
can be sliced up any way you want,"
said political science Prof. Thad
Kousser. "You have to make policy
choices."
Among the possible policy
changes are plans to reduce the
prison population. This proposal has
met strong opposition, especially
from Republicans who claim that
earlier parole and shorter sentences
would endanger public safety. For
Democrats' part, many oppose
plans to reduce the health care pro
vided for prisoners.
In addition, California voters
have consistently voted for tougher
sentences over the past two decades,
especially since the "Three Strikes"
law was passed in 1994, which man
dates terms of 25-to-life for defen
dants convicted of a third felony.
"The trend is almost entirely
toward longer sentences," Kousser
said, though he added that a drug
decriminalization bill may be on the
ballot in November. The bill, which

advocates more tolerant laws on
recreational drug use, would reduce
the number of people who are
incarcerated for non-violent crimes.
Even more controversial is
Schwarzenegger's plan to privatize
the state's prisons. This would see
private companies taking over the
construction of new prisons, and the
state hiring private firms to supply
the state-run facilities with guards,
doctors and other personnel.
Kousser foresees strong opposition
from the California Correctional
Peace Officers Association, which
he called "the most powerful union"
in the state, as privatization and
other reforms would likely result in
pay cuts for their officers.
In order for the education pro
posal to make it onto the ballot this
fall, the governor would need either
a two-thirds vote from the state leg
islature or signatures from 1.3 mil
lion voters. Once on the ballot, a
simple majority vote from the pub
lic would be needed for the amend
ment to pass.
Carter hopes that come
November, the voters of California
will support the proposed amend
ment. "I believe that the investment
in education will yield much higher
returns to society than investing in
prisons," she said. "I would love to
think that voters wouldn't do any
thing to undermine education
that they'll do the right thing."
