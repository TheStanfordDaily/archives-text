# California budget schools over prisons?
## Stanford profs. say challenges abound for governor's pitch 
### CAROLINE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford professors say an amendment to
the California constitution proposed by
Governor Schwarzenegger that would
require the state to invest more money in its
public universities than its prisons will face
many challenges before becoming actual
legislation.
The proposal, which has been both laud
ed and criticized since the governor's State
of the State address last Wednesday, would
require California to spend no less than 10
percent of its annual budget on higher edu
cation and no more than seven percent on
prisons. It would nearly reverse the current
situation: 7.5 percent and 11 percent of the
budget are allotted to universities and pris
ons, respectively.
"The priorities have become out of
whack over the years," Schwarzenegger said
in his address. "What does it say about a
state that focuses more on prison uniforms
than caps and gowns?"
Schwarzenegger's proposal comes at a
time of turmoil within the California higher
education system. In December, both the
University of California and California
State University systems increased tuition
by 32 percent, sparking protests and riots
across the UC campuses.
UC President Mark Yudof issued a state
ment hailing Schwarzenegger's proposal as "a
bold and visionary plan." UC Regents
Chairman Russell Gould also called upon the
state to end its "chronic disinvestment" in
higher education.
Prof. Prudence Carter of Stanford's
School of Education said she supports the
proposal, explaining that in California,

Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger delivered the State of the State address last Wednesday in Sacramento. The governor proposed
that the state spend at least 10 percent of its budget on education and no more than seven percent on prisons, which would nearly
reverse the current spending ratio.
