## Senators move on special fees McLaughlin says refund requests could strain VSO budgets 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Undergraduate senators last night
acted on the advice of the ASSU
financial manager to prevent rapid
losses to the funds that protect stu
dent groups when students request
special fees refunds.
According to a refund review pre
sented at last night's meeting, the pro
jected increase in student refund
requests for special fees funding could
cause a premature exhaustion of the
undergraduate "buffer fund" intended
to buoy student groups hit hard by
students' decisions to withdraw finan
cial support from various groups.
To date, the buffer has provided
unequivocal financial stability to stu
dent groups recovering financially
from the aftershock of special fees
refund request rates. Going forward,
the fund will continue do so, but now
with more stringent regulations.
Beginning this quarter, the buffer
fund will guarantee special fees fund
ing for student groups up to 10 per
cent after refunds. Any deviation
above this will require a dollar-for
dollar reduction in the group's overall
budget by the amount of the refunds
demanded by students in the first
three weeks of the quarter.
Although the measure was added
to the joint bylaws during a reform of
special fees policy in 2004, its imple
mentation is unprecedented until
now.
"There is a rule in the joint bylaws
that essentially orders me to take the
refund buffer and match it up against
the refund rate," said ASSU Financial
Manager Matt McLaughlin. "This rule
has never been implemented because
there's never been a need to."
Looking at trends over the past
five years, McLaughlin has projected
that by the end of fiscal year 2010,
$90,000 will be returned to students in
refund requests, while the buffer fund
only ensures up to $50,000.
According to the provision, losses
in special fees funding over 10 percent
as a result of rising refund rates will be
collected from each student group's
reserve first and then by budget line
item.
Since special fees policy reform
several years ago, students have been
requesting special fees refunds at a
lower rate than the actual refund
buffer, which has bolstered the fund
since its creation. But based on
McLaughlin's projections of signifi
cant increases in the demand for stu
dent refunds, the buffer fund could be
in trouble if adequate action is not
taken to save it.
Without the buffer fund,
McLaughlin argued that student
group budgets would be "raided very
