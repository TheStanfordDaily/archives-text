## Senators move on special fees McLaughlin says refund requests could strain VSO budgets 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Undergraduate senators last night
acted on the advice of the ASSU
financial manager to prevent rapid
losses to the funds that protect stu
dent groups when students request
special fees refunds.
According to a refund review pre
sented at last night's meeting, the pro
jected increase in student refund
requests for special fees funding could
cause a premature exhaustion of the
undergraduate "buffer fund" intended
to buoy student groups hit hard by
students' decisions to withdraw finan
cial support from various groups.
To date, the buffer has provided
unequivocal financial stability to stu
dent groups recovering financially
from the aftershock of special fees
refund request rates. Going forward,
the fund will continue do so, but now
with more stringent regulations.
Beginning this quarter, the buffer
fund will guarantee special fees fund
ing for student groups up to 10 per
cent after refunds. Any deviation
above this will require a dollar-for
dollar reduction in the group's overall
budget by the amount of the refunds
demanded by students in the first
three weeks of the quarter.
Although the measure was added
to the joint bylaws during a reform of
special fees policy in 2004, its imple
mentation is unprecedented until
now.
"There is a rule in the joint bylaws
that essentially orders me to take the
refund buffer and match it up against
the refund rate," said ASSU Financial
Manager Matt McLaughlin. "This rule
has never been implemented because
there's never been a need to."
Looking at trends over the past
five years, McLaughlin has projected
that by the end of fiscal year 2010,
$90,000 will be returned to students in
refund requests, while the buffer fund
only ensures up to $50,000.
According to the provision, losses
in special fees funding over 10 percent
as a result of rising refund rates will be
collected from each student group's
reserve first and then by budget line
item.
Since special fees policy reform
several years ago, students have been
requesting special fees refunds at a
lower rate than the actual refund
buffer, which has bolstered the fund
since its creation. But based on
McLaughlin's projections of signifi
cant increases in the demand for stu
dent refunds, the buffer fund could be
in trouble if adequate action is not
taken to save it.
Without the buffer fund,
McLaughlin argued that student
group budgets would be "raided very
quickly." He expressed concern for
the future protection of special fees
funding to student groups if the
buffer fund becomes depleted.
"Funding on student life would
come to an absolute standstill, and
there would be no extra bucket of
cash to honor any refunds through
the system without delving right into
the funds," he said.
McLaughlin pointed out that he
was unaware of the provision until
now, but, because of it, is convinced
that the buffer fund can be salvaged.
Failure to follow through on such a
provision would cut short a fund
intended to provide rescue support
for groups hit hard by refund
requests, he suggested.
In order to secure some addition
al impact cushioning for the expect
ed backlash of student refund
requests, which could dip into spe
cial fees funding for student groups,
the ASSU already tacks on an addi
tional 10 percent to the total special
fees sum billed to each student.
However, in some cases, this 10 per
cent has not been enough.
"The question is," he said, "am I
ringing the alarm bell too loud with
this projection, or am I ringing it too
softly?"
To date for winter quarter, there
have already been 250 more refund
requests than last quarter.
McLaughlin's most recent data
also suggests that certain special fees
groups are being hit upward of 12
percent due to special fees refund
requests only 10 percent of which
will be covered by the buffer fund.
On average, each group could owe
$9OO a year to account for refund
rates, with some student groups, such
as Stanford Concert Network (SCN)
and the KZSU radio station, in the
upper bounds of this sum.
"We're swallowing some hard
pills," said Senator Zack Warma 'll,
also columns editor for The Daily,
adding that enforcing the measure is
a "responsible step."
Still, McLaughlin's implementa
tion of the measure does not cap the
ballooning costs of special fees,
which have increased from $9O a
quarter three years ago, to $ll9 a
quarter for the current fiscal year.
Ryan Peacock, financial officer
for the Graduate Student Council,
has said the body will hold office
hours to give advice to groups on
how to combat refund rates.
"If people don't want to give
their money to [special fees groups]
we shouldn't be bankrupting the
ASSU because of that," Peacock
said, adding that student groups
need to leverage better public rela
tions with the student body to guar

antee funding and reduce refund
requests.
In terms of future measures to
prevent the damage of refunds rates
to student groups' budgets, Senator
Alex Katz 'l2 offered the possibility
of a constitutional amendment that
would hold voters accountable to
fund groups that they approve
through the special fees ballot.
"If someone can vote in favor of
that group, then they need to be held
accountable for that vote," Katz
said.
In a feedback questionnaire that
garnered 40 responses from finan
cial officers for student groups, the
Senate appropriations committee
yielded an average numerical
approval rating of 2.91 on a scale of
one to five, which Senate Chair
Varun Sivaram 'll said might sug
gest "some measure of dissatisfac
tion."
Dissatisfied groups may be react
ing to the significantly lower funding
rate, which has decreased from
approximately 70 percent in previ
ous years to 30 percent so far this
year. However, the constructive crit
icism will be used to improve the
funding process, which continues to
be challenging through the econom
ic downturn.

special fee refunds could soon
lead to budget shortfalls for student
groups.
