## Hoxby: Increasingly selective colleges are the exception 
### JANE LEPHAM STAFF WRITER 
As the number of high school graduates rose to a
record high at the end of the decade. Ivy League col
leges were reporting record-low acceptance rates, lead
ing many to believe that the college admissions process
was becoming more competitive than ever.
However, a recent paper by Stanford economics
Prof. Caroline Hoxby, director of the Economics of
Education Program for the National Bureau of
Economic Research, pushes against this theory. Hoxby

argues that most U.S. colleges are not more selective
now than they were 50 years ago and that at least five
percent of colleges have become substantially less
selective.
In "The Changing Selectivity of American
Colleges," Hoxby calls this misconception the per
ceived increase in competition a consequence of
people extrapolating from the experiences and accept
ance rates of a small number of colleges, particularly
schools in the Ivy League, Stanford, Duke and a hand
ful of elite liberal arts colleges.
"These colleges have experienced rising selectivity,

but their experience turns out to be the exception
rather than the rule," she wrote, adding that only the
"top 10 percent of colleges are substantially more
selective now than they were in 1962."
Hoxby indicates that the selectivity of most colleges
has been trending downward consistently since about
1950, explaining that although competition has
increased for schools like Harvard and Stanford, it is
now easier for students to get into a state college,
"A student now needs weaker preparation, lower
test scores, etc., to be admitted to most colleges in the
U. 5.," she wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.

"If you are the average student, you certainly
should not be worrying about college admissions stan
dards rising," she said. "It is really only students who
are at or above the 90th percentile in aptitude and
achievement who should think about college selectivi
ty rising."
Hoxby believes, however, that the overall decrease
in college selectivity has not been caused by falling
demand for a college education. Rather, the supply of
"college places" has risen faster. According to her
