## Hoxby: Increasingly selective colleges are the exception 
### JANE LEPHAM STAFF WRITER 
As the number of high school graduates rose to a
record high at the end of the decade. Ivy League col
leges were reporting record-low acceptance rates, lead
ing many to believe that the college admissions process
was becoming more competitive than ever.
However, a recent paper by Stanford economics
Prof. Caroline Hoxby, director of the Economics of
Education Program for the National Bureau of
Economic Research, pushes against this theory. Hoxby

argues that most U.S. colleges are not more selective
now than they were 50 years ago and that at least five
percent of colleges have become substantially less
selective.
In "The Changing Selectivity of American
Colleges," Hoxby calls this misconception the per
ceived increase in competition a consequence of
people extrapolating from the experiences and accept
ance rates of a small number of colleges, particularly
schools in the Ivy League, Stanford, Duke and a hand
ful of elite liberal arts colleges.
"These colleges have experienced rising selectivity,

but their experience turns out to be the exception
rather than the rule," she wrote, adding that only the
"top 10 percent of colleges are substantially more
selective now than they were in 1962."
Hoxby indicates that the selectivity of most colleges
has been trending downward consistently since about
1950, explaining that although competition has
increased for schools like Harvard and Stanford, it is
now easier for students to get into a state college,
"A student now needs weaker preparation, lower
test scores, etc., to be admitted to most colleges in the
U. 5.," she wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.

"If you are the average student, you certainly
should not be worrying about college admissions stan
dards rising," she said. "It is really only students who
are at or above the 90th percentile in aptitude and
achievement who should think about college selectivi
ty rising."
Hoxby believes, however, that the overall decrease
in college selectivity has not been caused by falling
demand for a college education. Rather, the supply of
"college places" has risen faster. According to her
research, the number of high school
graduates has grown by 131 per
cent while the number of college
spots has risen by 297 percent.
"There are many more students
demanding a college education
today than in the past, both because
there are more people in the U.S.
now and because college education
is now more necessary for attaining
a middle-class lifestyle," she said.
Hoxby reasons that when supply
grows faster than demand, selectiv
ity is going to decrease.
In addition to supply-and
demand economics, she attributes
the decrease in selectivity to a sec-

ond phenomenon: "re-sorting." She
explains that students used to
attend a local college regardless of
their abilities or the school's char
acteristics; now, however, students'
choices are driven less by proximi
ty and more by a college's
resources and student body.
"Clearly, if high-aptitude stu
dents were now more determined
to attend selective colleges and less
concerned about attending local
colleges .. . the initially more
selective colleges would become
more selective and initially less
selective colleges would become
less selective," she said.
In its recent early admission
cycle, Stanford's 13.5 percent admit
rate for early action applicants
from the Class of 2014 actually rep
resented an increase in the number
of students accepted from the pre-

vious year, when the University
accepted 12.8 percent of early
applicants a seeming exception
to Hoxby's theory.
However, Hoxby maintains that
these numbers are "meaningless"
in explaining trends in selectivity.
"If students who applied to
Stanford early have better scores
and grades than in previous years,
the admissions office should have
accepted a higher share of them,"
she said. "The fact that more were
accepted says nothing about selec
tivity. You have to look at an
absolute standard of selectivity
(scores, grades, other qualifica
tions). You cannot look at accept
ance ratios and expect to get the
answer right."
