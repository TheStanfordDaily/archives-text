## DORM DIVERSITY Exploring Stanford's cross-cultural housing 
### CORDELIA SENDAX 
A young Caucasian male, born and raised in the
Northeast, bobs his head to reggaeton music,
engrossed in the throws and falls of the
Hispanic melody. His iTunes features an opu
lence of Latin music. This scene a multicul
tural fusion of Non-Hispanic and Hispanic cultural ele
ments takes place at Casa Zapata, Stanford's
Chicano/Latino themed dorm.
At Stanford, there are four ethnic themed houses: Casa
Zapata; Ujamaa, the African-American themed house;
Okada, the Asian-American themed house; and
Muwekma-Ta-Ruk, the Native American themed house.
Each houses students from all four classes and with the
exception of Muwekma-Ta-Ruk, all require that 50 per
cent of residents identify with an ethnicity other than the
one around which the dorm is centered.
The head bobbing Northeasterner is George Malkin
'l3, a freshman in Casa Zapata. George did not request to
be in Casa Zapata or any other cross-cultural housing. Yet
as a fluent Spanish speaker and someone who wrote that
he wasn't afraid to "try something different" on his hous
ing form, he was not surprised by his placement in Casa
Zapata.
Malkin has found that there are many benefits to living
in an ethnically themed dorm, especially for students of
the house's cultural heritage.
"An ethnically-themed house serves as a source of

comfort and an opportunity to find friends who share sim
ilar values for students who identify with the specific eth
nic minorities for which these houses are established," he
remarked.
Yet, Malkin also believes that when it comes to non
minority residents students like him cross-cultural
housing serves a unique purpose.
"For non-Hispanic individuals in Casa Zapata, the
house provides an opportunity to experiment a little,"
he said. "In a country that is both culturally rich and
culturally divisive like ours, it is easy to forget that the
folks you see every day share a lot in common with you
and have valuable insights to offer from their life expe
riences."
For Alexzandra Scully 'l3, a resident in Muwekma-Ta-
Ruk and 20 percent Choctaw Indian, living in a cross-cul
tural dorm has given her the strong exposure to other
natives that she did not receive while growing up in the
Virgin Islands.
"Cultural-based residential living brings awareness to
individuals who have a cultural past, but little exposure to
it in the present," she explained. "It also acts as a home
base for everyone who desires to learn about the native
culture because anyone who is not part of the house can
participate in its cultural events."
Jackson Dartez 'l3, a freshman in Ujamaa, gave a sim
ilar perspective on the benefits of cross-cultural housing
for students who seek to reconnect with their cultural
roots.

"There are a lot of residents who are black, but grew up
or went to school in predominantly white prep schools,"
he said. "Ujamaa provides them with the opportunity to
be surrounded by people who share the same ethnic back
ground."
Jackson also believes that cross-cultural housing pro
vides another facet to the college learning experience.
"Learning occurs in the classroom," he noted. "But
also, cultural knowledge is gained through one's living sit
uation."
Emily Angulo 'l3, an Arlington, Va. native born from
Bolivian parents, attended a minority-rich middle school.
However, she went through an intense culture shock when
only 5 of 80 students in her high school class identified
with her Latino heritage.
When it came time to fill out the residential housing
forms for Stanford, Emily selected "All-Frosh" as her first
option and Casa Zapata as her second. She wanted to
branch out from the minority community and meet many
members of her class, yet a part of her wanted to experi
ence more of the Latino community from which she felt
"deprived" in high school.
"I had already gone through cultural shock in sixth
grade not knowing how to approach peers in a pre
dominantly white school, being scared to speak up in
class and thinking my peers were smarter than me," she
explained. "But here there are lots of ethnic minorities
who came from predominantly ethnic high schools.
Having the option to live with people who they can

identity with can promote academic or social success
for these students."
Furthermore, Angulo recognizes that placement in a
cross-cultural house can provide the cultural connection a
shy individual might be less likely to seek out.
"If I didn't live in Zapata, I would still seek out the
Latino community at Stanford," she said. "But there are
some people who wouldn't have the initiative to look for
the cultural outlet they desire or even need."
Speak to a group of Stanford alumni and you will like
ly receive a laundry list of unique experiences. However,
few can say that in their four years at Stanford, they
resided in all four of the cross-cultural dorms.
Melissa Kamura 'OB lived in Ujamaa as a freshman, fol
lowed by Casa Zapata, then Okada and finally,
Muwekma-Ta-Ruk. Yet, Kamura did not enter Stanford
with the aim to reside in all four cross-cultural dorms.
"In my four years, Muwekma was the only house I was
assigned to that I had put as my first choice," she said. "So
it was never really my intention those other three years to
live in each of the four ethnic-themed dorms."
When she lived in Okada as a junior, her friends would
jokingly tell her that she could do a complete ethnic
theme dorm tour.
"Muwekma was the only one left," she laughed. "I
knew several people who would be on staff and so I
thought that Muwekma would be a great place to live my
senior year. I applied for priority and got in."
While living in all four ethnic dorms may have been more
of a coincidence than a conscious decision, Melissa's appre
ciation for the cultural exposure she gained through her
unique residential experience could not be more evident.
"Living in cross-cultural dorms has challenged me to
take an issue and to look at it from multiple perspectives,"
she recounted. "I've been inspired by so many of my peers,
how selfless they are and how open and willing they are to
share who they are. I'm pretty introverted, but being a part
of such supportive communities has allowed me to share
my experiences with them as well."
It is from a unique insider perspective that Kamura
articulates her own notion of the role that cross-cultural
housing plays on campus.
"I think the purpose of cross-cultural housing is to
establish a community in the dorm that serves the diverse
needs of students," she said. "Students face many chal
lenges throughout their Stanford experience that involve
not only race, but also economic status, personal values,
religion, language, background, home communities, immi
gration and many others. One of the best ways to deal with
these challenges is through the consistent support of a
dorm community that acknowledges and understands the
complexities of these challenges."
Kamura's insight into the purpose of cross-cultural
housing based upon her own personal experiences is syn
chronous with the administration's mission behind the
establishment of cross-cultural housing on campus.
"In Residential Education, we believe there is a unique
opportunity to learn while living in community and this is
particularly true regarding culture, societal norms and eth
nic identity," wrote Dean of Residential Education
Deborah Golder in an e-mail to The Daily. "[Cross-cultur
al housing] can and do offer a safe space for students who
may feel marginalized or seek a place of connection."
Golder also emphasized the strong sense of cultural
identity fortified by living in an ethnic-themed dorm as
primary impetus for the formation of cross-cultural hous
ing on campus.
"Ethnic theme houses are thriving communities, each
with a strong and evolving sense of identity and commit
ment," she said.
In addition to the support and diverse opportunities
bestowed upon the cross-cultural dorm residents, cross
cultural housing serves an important commemorative
purpose.
"The ethnic theme houses play a critical role in the
undergraduate residential program at Stanford," Golder
said. "One such way is that these houses serve to mark our
history as a university. They are a testament to the
Stanford students, staff and faculty who passionately
worked to create them."

A young Caucasian male, born and raised in the
Northeast, bobs his head to reggaeton music,
engrossed in the throws and falls of the
Hispanic melody. His iTunes features an opu
lence of Latin music. This scene a multicul
tural fusion of Non-Hispanic and Hispanic cultural ele
ments takes place at Casa Zapata, Stanford's
Chicano/Latino themed dorm.
At Stanford, there are four ethnic themed houses: Casa
Zapata; Ujamaa, the African-American themed house;
Okada, the Asian-American themed house; and
Muwekma-Ta-Ruk, the Native American themed house.
Each houses students from all four classes and with the
exception of Muwekma-Ta-Ruk, all require that 50 per
cent of residents identify with an ethnicity other than the
one around which the dorm is centered.
The head bobbing Northeasterner is George Malkin
'l3, a freshman in Casa Zapata. George did not request to
be in Casa Zapata or any other cross-cultural housing. Yet
as a fluent Spanish speaker and someone who wrote that
he wasn't afraid to "try something different" on his hous
ing form, he was not surprised by his placement in Casa
Zapata.
Malkin has found that there are many benefits to living
in an ethnically themed dorm, especially for students of
the house's cultural heritage.
"An ethnically-themed house serves as a source of

comfort and an opportunity to find friends who share sim
ilar values for students who identify with the specific eth
nic minorities for which these houses are established," he
remarked.
Yet, Malkin also believes that when it comes to non
minority residents students like him cross-cultural
housing serves a unique purpose.
"For non-Hispanic individuals in Casa Zapata, the
house provides an opportunity to experiment a little,"
he said. "In a country that is both culturally rich and
culturally divisive like ours, it is easy to forget that the
folks you see every day share a lot in common with you
and have valuable insights to offer from their life expe
riences."
For Alexzandra Scully 'l3, a resident in Muwekma-Ta-
Ruk and 20 percent Choctaw Indian, living in a cross-cul
tural dorm has given her the strong exposure to other
natives that she did not receive while growing up in the
Virgin Islands.
"Cultural-based residential living brings awareness to
individuals who have a cultural past, but little exposure to
it in the present," she explained. "It also acts as a home
base for everyone who desires to learn about the native
culture because anyone who is not part of the house can
participate in its cultural events."
Jackson Dartez 'l3, a freshman in Ujamaa, gave a sim
ilar perspective on the benefits of cross-cultural housing
for students who seek to reconnect with their cultural
roots.

"There are a lot of residents who are black, but grew up
or went to school in predominantly white prep schools,"
he said. "Ujamaa provides them with the opportunity to
be surrounded by people who share the same ethnic back
ground."
Jackson also believes that cross-cultural housing pro
vides another facet to the college learning experience.
"Learning occurs in the classroom," he noted. "But
also, cultural knowledge is gained through one's living sit
uation."
Emily Angulo 'l3, an Arlington, Va. native born from
Bolivian parents, attended a minority-rich middle school.
However, she went through an intense culture shock when
only 5 of 80 students in her high school class identified
with her Latino heritage.
When it came time to fill out the residential housing
forms for Stanford, Emily selected "All-Frosh" as her first
option and Casa Zapata as her second. She wanted to
branch out from the minority community and meet many
members of her class, yet a part of her wanted to experi
ence more of the Latino community from which she felt
"deprived" in high school.
"I had already gone through cultural shock in sixth
grade not knowing how to approach peers in a pre
dominantly white school, being scared to speak up in
class and thinking my peers were smarter than me," she
explained. "But here there are lots of ethnic minorities
who came from predominantly ethnic high schools.
Having the option to live with people who they can

identity with can promote academic or social success
for these students."
Furthermore, Angulo recognizes that placement in a
cross-cultural house can provide the cultural connection a
shy individual might be less likely to seek out.
"If I didn't live in Zapata, I would still seek out the
Latino community at Stanford," she said. "But there are
some people who wouldn't have the initiative to look for
the cultural outlet they desire or even need."
Speak to a group of Stanford alumni and you will like
ly receive a laundry list of unique experiences. However,
few can say that in their four years at Stanford, they
resided in all four of the cross-cultural dorms.
Melissa Kamura 'OB lived in Ujamaa as a freshman, fol
lowed by Casa Zapata, then Okada and finally,
Muwekma-Ta-Ruk. Yet, Kamura did not enter Stanford
with the aim to reside in all four cross-cultural dorms.
"In my four years, Muwekma was the only house I was
assigned to that I had put as my first choice," she said. "So
it was never really my intention those other three years to
live in each of the four ethnic-themed dorms."
When she lived in Okada as a junior, her friends would
jokingly tell her that she could do a complete ethnic
theme dorm tour.
"Muwekma was the only one left," she laughed. "I
knew several people who would be on staff and so I
thought that Muwekma would be a great place to live my
senior year. I applied for priority and got in."
While living in all four ethnic dorms may have been more
of a coincidence than a conscious decision, Melissa's appre
ciation for the cultural exposure she gained through her
unique residential experience could not be more evident.
"Living in cross-cultural dorms has challenged me to
take an issue and to look at it from multiple perspectives,"
she recounted. "I've been inspired by so many of my peers,
how selfless they are and how open and willing they are to
share who they are. I'm pretty introverted, but being a part
of such supportive communities has allowed me to share
my experiences with them as well."
It is from a unique insider perspective that Kamura
articulates her own notion of the role that cross-cultural
housing plays on campus.
"I think the purpose of cross-cultural housing is to
establish a community in the dorm that serves the diverse
needs of students," she said. "Students face many chal
lenges throughout their Stanford experience that involve
not only race, but also economic status, personal values,
religion, language, background, home communities, immi
gration and many others. One of the best ways to deal with
these challenges is through the consistent support of a
dorm community that acknowledges and understands the
complexities of these challenges."
Kamura's insight into the purpose of cross-cultural
housing based upon her own personal experiences is syn
chronous with the administration's mission behind the
establishment of cross-cultural housing on campus.
"In Residential Education, we believe there is a unique
opportunity to learn while living in community and this is
particularly true regarding culture, societal norms and eth
nic identity," wrote Dean of Residential Education
Deborah Golder in an e-mail to The Daily. "[Cross-cultur
al housing] can and do offer a safe space for students who
may feel marginalized or seek a place of connection."
Golder also emphasized the strong sense of cultural
identity fortified by living in an ethnic-themed dorm as
primary impetus for the formation of cross-cultural hous
ing on campus.
"Ethnic theme houses are thriving communities, each
with a strong and evolving sense of identity and commit
ment," she said.
In addition to the support and diverse opportunities
bestowed upon the cross-cultural dorm residents, cross
cultural housing serves an important commemorative
purpose.
"The ethnic theme houses play a critical role in the
undergraduate residential program at Stanford," Golder
said. "One such way is that these houses serve to mark our
history as a university. They are a testament to the
