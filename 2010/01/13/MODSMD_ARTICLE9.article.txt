### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a multitude of successful
Stanford student startups
from Google to Sun
Microsystems innovation and
entrepreneurship are central
components to the University's identity. Three cur
rent undergraduates discuss the companies that
they have started and their respective roads to suc
cess.

Tom Currier
"I have a list of some of the failed concepts,"
Tom Currier 'l3 said. "Here, let me pull this up."
Currier got out his Mac√üook and opened a
document that described some of his projects that
never quite made it. When he spoke of them, it
wasn't with any kind of defeat, but with detectable
humor.
Dressed in a hoodie and jeans, Currier is just
like any other Stanford student except that he
has founded three successful companies and is
working on more.
When Currier was nine years old, he started his
first business, Scanboy, which produced wedding,
graduation and birthday DVDs with people's pho
tos.
"I built this scanner that can scan 1400 pictures
an hour," he said. "It just kept growing. At the time
it was a pretty novel concept."
However, most of his attempts didn't work.
Currier used his profits from Scanboy to fund a
range of ideas, inventions and companies that
failed, from a seat-cushion called "Seat roll-ups" to
a company, Global Gateways, which attempted to
create the new ".com."
"I think the problem was, especially when I was
younger, that I had too many ideas," he said. "I
couldn't focus on one. I would work on one for a
little bit and then a new idea would come along."
Some of his projects were simply not pushed at
the right time. For example. Currier started a text
messaging coupon service when he was eleven.
"Those [coupon services] are becoming popu
lar now," he said. "You can get text message

coupons on your iPhone. But at the time, no one
was really texting."
Currier defines his most successful venture as
MNSEP, Minnesota Student Energy Project. The
non-profit he co-founded seeks to install solar
panels in high schools and promote education on
green-energy in areas with low environmental
awareness.
The organization has grown to 330 students and
has raised over $142,000 since its conception a
year and a half ago.
"We put up solar panels on my high school,
Mayo High School," he said. "We are going to
install them on two new high schools this next
week."
Although Currier identifies himself as an
entrepreneur, he is far more concerned with being
an inventor. Currently he is working on a new
project at Stanford to solve the global energy cri
sis, which he sees as being inextricably linked to
solving hunger.
"This device that I'm trying to invent would
reduce the cost of solar power to the point where
it is actually cheaper than coal," he said. "I'm try
ing to work on that."

Ben Cunningham
When Ben Cunningham 'lO reflected on his
childhood, a definitive statement came to mind: "I
was a total math nerd."
Cunningham, a key player in the Stanford
start-up Terriblyclever, which was recently
acquired by Blackboard, was always drawn
toward puzzles as a kid. However, his first intro
duction to programming was a TI-83 Plus graph
ing calculator.
"You might do really simple stuff like a guess
ing game," he said. "You're given a range between
one and 1,000. You give it a number and it tells you
if you're higher or lower. You just keep guessing
and eventually your math class is over."
He first learned C++ at a summer camp pro
gram at Florida State University.
"I started looking at programming as away to
make my mathematical knowledge and back
ground really come to life on a computer screen,"
he explained. "And it was really enabling and
empowering to be able to watch that happen by

typing words."
When Cunningham came to study at Stanford,
he was amazed by the offerings of the computer
science department and focused on learning as
much within the department as possible.
Freshman year, Cunningham was dorm-mates
with Kayvon Beykpour 'lO and Pablo Jablonski
'lO, who would later invite him to join
Terriblyclever.
"Looking back, I remember I walked into
Kayvon's room and said, 'Kayvon, can you tell me
how the Internet works? How a Web site works?"'
he said. "And so he gave me this really basic lesson
in HP."
After working for Terriblyclever during his
sophomore year and the following summer,
Cunningham was invited to own a stake in the
company.
"That was really a turning point where I was
like, this is no longer my job," he said. "I was more
like, this is what I'm doing."
Terriblyclever took off at the beginning of
Cunningham's junior year when the startup won
an AT&T mobile applications and education con
test for developing iStanford.
The team was flown to a lavish venue in
Orlando where the members were praised by top
executives in AT&T. Cunningham remembers
feeling the conflict between being a student and a
businessman.
"We were in Orlando and I had a midterm I
needed to take," he said. "The teacher faxes it to
me and I'm at this presentation and I'm taking the
midterm, thinking, 'What am I doing right now?'"
The Terriblyclever team got to a point at which
it needed to define its priority.
"We realized the magnitude of the opportunity
and we realized that we couldn't worry about
school," he said. "It was then that we sort of lifted
up school with weak arms and sort of put it on the
back burner."
Although prioritizing seemed to make things
easier, junior year for Cunningham meant being a
full-time employee in the San Francisco office and
simultaneously being a full-time student.
"There was never one point at which it was
easy," he said. "Coming back home and staying up
until 2 after a full day of work to finish a problem
set that's never going to be easy."

The team managed by going through it togeth
er, taking the same classes and working on a com
mon senior project, an analytics platform for the
iPhone.
"It's probably something about Stanford stu
dents that we thought it was really fun and really
cool at the same time, to be using that much of our
selves, to be really pushing that upper limit of what
we previously thought we could do," he said.
For the purpose of maintaining personal sanity,
Cunningham has scaled back on his work hours
this year and is enjoying being involved in the
Stanford campus.
"You don't really notice how much being on
campus connects you to what's going on at
Stanford," he said. "Now this year, I'm going to
class and you realize how many people you see. I
had made a lot of great friends here and I want to
respect that."
Cunningham's long-term dream is to create a
unified audio-visual sensory experience.
"I'm really into music and I'm really into com
puter graphics," he said. "One of the coolest things
I ever thought you could do was make a visualizer
for music really beautiful, psychedelic rainbow
representations of the sound that you hear."
Cunningham used his check from the
Blackboard acquisition of Terriblyclever to buy a
RGB 5 Watt laser projector for the project.
"It's government regulated," he explained. "I
can't turn it on outside without alerting the FAA
because it can blind pilots. And I had to get a spe
cial license just to be able to buy it."
He is working with a friend, Charlie Forkish
'O9, to create a system that merges light and sound
in live performances. They are working to merge
numerical aspects of music such as beats and pitch
with visual parameters like texture, color, size,
speed and pulse.
"In terms of my life goal, I really want to cap
ture that connection between light and sound and
bring it to as many people as possible,"
Cunningham said.
Cunningham describes what it means to be an
entrepreneur.
"It's a person who knows they can do it, that
will do it," he said. "You're going to hit a bunch of
brick walls, but you need to use them as
something that makes you prove just
how much you want to do it."

Jonathan Manzi
"It's like piloting a helicopter 100
miles above ground and then 8 miles
above ground and being able to zoom
in and out," said Jonathan Manzi 'l3,

discussing the meaning of innovation.
"You need different vision."
Manzi, who is talking his Winter 2010
quarter off to run his company from
Boston, describes his first company, V
bux, as the definition of a pioneering
company. He explains that his company
is an ethical incentivized marketing
solution which restructured the way in
which Web-advertising companies use
pop-ups and free prize offers.
"I rearranged the structure so that
people actually get their free prizes," he
said. "It's a positive, viral cycle. You only
have to sign up for one offer and then
refer a friend. It's much easier for the

user, but also easier for the advertiser."
Manzi faced a significant obstacle
when his V-bux user database was
hacked and external companies
spammed users' e-mail addresses.
"Any time there's an obstacle I try
to exploit it for beneficial outcomes," he
said. "I was struggling with whether or
not I should keep the system going."
Instead of giving up, Manzi apolo
gized to users by offering monetary
gifts and re-structured the system. His
changes met immediate results.
"We got three big contracts and saw
a huge increase in five days," he
explained.

Revenue for V-bux in 2008 exceed
ed $3.2 million.
After V-bux, Manzi launched his
second company, a cost-per advertising
network, Vintacore. Outside companies
pay a pre-determined rate to Vintacore
for each new customer it receives.
"People ask me. Are you motivated
by profit?"' he commented. "If I were
profit driven, a cost analyst would have
told me not to do it."
Launching two companies means
Manzi has anything but a normal
lifestyle.
"When I started my company I
probably got two to four hours of sleep
for three months," he said. "No one
believes me, but I did it."
Manzi also recalls taking business
calls during the school day in the rest
room.
"I remember one instance when I
was on the phone with an executive
from a publically traded company and

I'm sure she could hear toilets flushing
in the background," he said.
He recalls playing games with him
self to make the most creative use of his
time.
"I would exercise by purposely
picking a bank that was 2 miles away
and I'd run there with my check in a
folder," he said. "I would also go to
hockey games and write up legal
reports; it became a power play for me
to maximize time."
Manzi perceives two distinct
branches of entrepreneurs: fundamen
tal and opportunistic.
"There are opportunistic entrepre
neurs, which is the individual or group
that looks at stats and hard data and
uses a business model to discern the
market," he said.
This would be an individual, for
example, who sees a demonstrated
need in the market and seeks to meet it
through opening a previously struc

tured franchise.
"Then there is the fundamental
entrepreneur the conceptual, philo
sophical, coming up with something
new," he said. "These are the people
who launch Facebook or Google, which
the opportunistic entrepreneur uses."
Manzi sees himself on the side of
the fundamental.
Although Manzi is taking a leave of
absence to run his Boston-based com
pany, he noted that he could feel the
pulse of Silicon Valley in the energy of
the Stanford campus.
"New things popped into my head
while I was at Stanford," he said. "It
helped with stimulation and with think
ing and acquiring visionary thinking. So
many different thinking patterns con
verge there I think I'll be back there
soon."
