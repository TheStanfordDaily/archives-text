## Stanford study shows gain in African solar-powered irrigation 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The dry season in sub-Saharan
Africa is a brutal six months of mini
mal rainfall, widespread malnutrition
and community dislocation.
However, according to a study by
Jennifer Burney, a postdoctoral
scholar at Stanford's Program on
Food Security and the Environment
(FSE), solar-powered drip irrigation
systems may provide a viable long
term solution.

Burney has spent the past three
years studying the effectiveness of a
pilot project involving photovoltaic
(PV) irrigation installations in two
villages in rural Benin. Burney
worked with her co-authors,
Marshall Burke of UC- Berkeley and
Lennart Woltering and Dov
Pasternak of the International Crops

Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
Tropics (ICRISAT) in Niger.
Benin's Kalale district has 42 vil
lages and a population of approxi
mately 104,000 people and 95 per
cent of them depend on subsistence
farming as their primary livelihood.
During the dry season, a six-month
period between November and
April, the region may receive as little
as 20 or fewer inches of rain. For the
80 percent of Kalale villages not near
a water source, this shortage takes an
enormous toll on crop production,
income, health and nutrition and can
cause community dislocation when
families are forced to relocate to
urban areas and search for jobs.
Burney, who spent most of 2007
working in Benin, initially became
involved with the project because of
her involvement with the Solar
Electric Light Fund (SELF), a non

profit organization whose self-pro
claimed purpose is to fight "climate
change and global poverty with solar
power." They first began funding the
installation of solar-powered drip irri
gation in fall of 2006 and by 2007, the
technology had been implemented.
Burney said SELF took a great
deal of time during the installation
process to train as many locals as
possible in the construction and
maintenance skills associated with
the irrigation system. According to
Burney, the purpose was to foster
involvement and attachment to the
system, as well as to ensure its sus
tainability.
Three systems were installed alto
gether: two surface-level pumps in
the village of Bessassi and one sub
mersible pump in the village of
Dunkassa. The advantages of PV
technology are its immunity to fuel

shortages, a lower long-term cost
than traditional diesel generators
and saved labor.

Burney's study of the project's
effectiveness showed incredible
results: all three systems produced
1.9 metric tons of produce per
month, vegetable intake increased to
3-5 servings per day during the dry
season and 17 percent of people liv
ing in the villages reported feeling
less "food insecure," Additionally,
families using the systems increased
their income by selling a large por
tion of their excess produce, the size
of plots cultivated experienced a dra
matic visual difference, the effort
needed to cultivate them decreased
and nutrition improved dramatically.
However, one of the project's
most striking results goes beyond the
realm of the quantitative.
Independent of any efforts by SELF,

education programs developed in the
participating villages to teach young
people about the system.
"One of the schools developed a
whole curriculum. Kids do calcula
tions about how long it would take to
water a plot of a certain size by hand
versus with an irrigation system and
they go visit the site," Burney said.
The sense of community pride
that has arisen in response to the new
technology came as a pleasant sur
prise, according to Burney, who said
her greatest fears going into the proj
ect came from hearing "all these ter
rible stories about development proj
ects gone bad.
"This has been nice to see, that it's
a prized sort of community posses
sion," she added.
