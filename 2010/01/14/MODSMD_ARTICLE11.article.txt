## Military 101 educates students on service 
### KATE ABBOTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Military 101," a lecture held at
Tresidder Memorial Union, brought
together students "confused by head
line news," interested in foreign policy,
experienced in military action or just
generally curious.

Attendees came to learn the work
ings of the military from military vet
erans, courtesy of the Truman Service
Initiative. The program is run out of
the Truman Security Project
Educational Institute and is being
piloted in its first year at five elite uni
versities across the country in hopes of
helping "future leaders of the U.S.
bridge the civil-military divide."
The lecture, led by an Air Force
veteran and a Navy veteran, discussed
the framework of military organiza
tion and the key differences between
the different services, as well as focus
ing in depth on military values and dif
ficult questions and stereotypes that
are often raised.

Students came to learn more for a
variety of reasons, from the personal
to the professional.
"I'm here for general interest," said
Nailah Spruill 'l2 before the event.
"My dad was in the military and I
never really understood what he did,
so this should be enlightening."

Attendee Sebastain Gould 'll left
Stanford after his freshman year to
join the Marine Corps, where he
became a Lance Corporal. He said the
event addressed concerns that were
important to discuss.

"You could make a whole class on
these questions the moral ques
tions really do affect us all, like,
'Should you join, should your children
join?'" he said.
Gould emphasized the usefulness of
a basic understanding of the military,
equating the lecture to the Global
Community general education require
ment that every student has to fulfill.
"All students should have expo
sure to these ideas," he said.
Kelly Gleischman 'lO, a Truman

coordinator, said that because of the
relevance of the military for foreign
policy, a knowledge of its workings is
important. "Students at all levels are
leaning about these issues, and the
military is a critical part of foreign pol
icy," she said. "That's not limited to
any one interest, background, major
or political party."
"We value open dialogue and dis
course on this campus, so we're trying
to provide the vocabulary to talk
about these things," added fellow
organizer Jessie Knight 'lO.

Gould said the event was at its best
when students were able to discuss the
ideas presented. "It was kind of what I
expected," he said. "The direct infor
mation approach is helpful because a
lot of people don't know anything, but
the second half was better because it
helped further the conversation."
The event was hosted in conjunc
tion with Stanford in Government,
the Stanford Democrats and the
Stanford Conservative Society.
Organizer Will Treseder 'll said

the Truman Service Initiative events,
especially the Military 101 lecture,
provide students with "military litera
cy." This year is the first in a three-year
pilot program that will "subsequently
be larger as they get the [Truman
Service Initiative's] name out there.

"It's really interesting to see the
range of people who are interested,"
Treseder said. "You're always sur
prised by who might show up."
