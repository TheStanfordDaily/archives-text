## OP-ED Haiti: Are you there, God? Are you their God? 
### BRANDON JACKSON '12 jacksonb@stanford. edu 
Why Haiti? Undoubtedly, many are
asking this question in the wake of
the largest disaster of the new
decade. One survivor simply expressed last
night to CNN's Anderson Cooper, "We can
only leave it in the hands of the almighty."
This leads me to ask: Are you there, God?
And if you are, are you their God? Truly if the
old man is there, it appears he has abandoned
Port-au-Prince probably too busy answer
ing the all too frequent calls to 'Bless Ameri
ca.'
In a world that allows me to make more in
one month than the average Haitian does in
one year, something seems to be out of focus.
The God of our weary years appears to be
asleep at the wheel or is He?
2005 brought us Katrina, and 2010 has
begun with a terrible bang, to say the least.
However, in a span of five years, my prayer is
that our world, our country and our campus
are ready to uncheck the option of apathy for
sake of get this action!
Time is out and up waiting for the Heav
ens to split, the bushes to burn and the rocks
to cry out. While the world looks up to affirm
through faith that God has not gone AWOL,
let us not as members of collective faiths re
peat the same patterns of apathy and pas
sivism that have only allowed cycles of social
justice to continue.
As someone who holds his faith dear to

his heart, let me share with you the clear
mandate I believe God has issued to His peo
ple. This will alarm many people, and others
will be surprised to hear me utter these
words. But family, it is simply not enough to
pray.

I am a Christian, and I believe in the
power of prayer, relying on it day in and day
out. However, I charge you today to not only
pray, but to be an answer to someone's
prayer.

I am conscious of the blessings God has be
stowed on all of us here at Stanford Univer
sity. But now, we are reminded that it is not
just about our being blessed. It is time to be a
blessing.
I don't want your money Haiti needs your
money. Plain and simple. More than TAP, the
bookstore or, God forbid, Apple, hold off
buying that STAT 60 text and consider giving
to help someone whose struggles include
more than finalizing a study list.
There is a Haiti Relief meeting being held
today at the Black Community Services Cen
ter at noon. I encourage you to come find out
how you might truly be the salt of the earth
and the light of the world.
Are you there, God? I believe so. Where
are YOU?
