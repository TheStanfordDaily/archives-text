# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Et In Arcadia Ego. 
### Emily Hulme 
Once upon a time (and a very good time
it was) men were happy and free,
hardly paid taxes and almost certain
ly never swore. If they did wish to curse an
other, their tongues would revolt and instead
they would mutter such invectives as, "May
my foe live into blessed old age" or, "Let him
eat cake, preferably with cream cheese frost
ing." Such was the state of things until various
and sundry market forces, etc. etc., led the
people to determine the best course of events
was to devalue the very currency of their
souls. From this Golden Age, as Hesiod and
Vergil et al. name it, man slowly sank to sil
ver, then base iron. No conspiracy of either
politics or alchemy has brought this spirit of
unabashed human potential back as more
than a passing shade, a slippery dream that is
precisely a dream and nothing more.
Yet, it persists. Let us plumb history first to
see how this has played out and then take ac
count of how today we are still troubled by a
past that never was. Fun fact to remember
the next time a misguided news anchor de
cries the insidious effects of rap music and
Grand Theft Auto: Hesiod already was
lamenting the decline of the human race in
the eighth century B.C. Cranky Roman sena
tors complained about the same thing basi
cally the whole time the Republic existed
(which, for those of you who don't think it
matters, was longer than the existence of the
United Sates). They then got a taste of occa
sionally brilliant, often megalomaniacal
leadership under the Empire. Naturally, Ed
ward Gibbon referred to this as the happiest
period for mankind in history. Looking back,
French revolutionaries took the Roman Re
public as their model, despite the fact we
know retroactively it had a 100 percent
chance of leading to disastrous civil war. Ob
viously, their attempt for a Republic worked
out much better under Robespierre, and did
not immediately collapse into a state led by a
single venerated military leader.
Only by the peculiar mixture of vainglori
ous self-consciousness and deliberate pat
tern blindness toward contrary evidence that
characterizes the human brain do we sup
pose any of these ages support our conviction
that heaven on Earth is possible. In short, to
be malcontent with your age is what propels
the entire human experiment forward. As
one chemistry professor of mine put it, life is
a redox reaction and equilibrium is death.
There's a good reason we "rest in peace" but

live in anger, resentment, fury and ultimately
in a state of constantly having hopes dashed.
For obvious reasons, the Golden Age
must always be not now, or, at the very least,
not here. Another planet might be accept
able, but it's also fashionable for Americans
to locate it on the European continent.
Hence, we have the glories of European uni
versal health care and civilized tolerance.
One is at least partially true, but comes with
the caveat of such glories as doctors' strikes
in Germany; to give just a little sense of scale,
one deal in 2006 was reached after 12 weeks
of striking in which up to 13,000 doctors par
ticipated. The other seems questionable in
light of the ongoing rebuff of "Muslim"
Turkey by the E.U. and the Swiss ban on
minarets (seriously, have you seen the ads?).
So, then, what about going back to the
simple ways of our ancestors? This is what et
in Arcadia ego is all about Arcadia is this
mythical pastoral land where people are un
sophisticated and by dint of this, happy in a
way high-strung, latte-sipping New Yorkers
can only envy. They have home births with
midwives and eat organic only, which I need
n't remind anyone are all the rage now in
such backwoods as Palo Alto. Of course, this
comes with the deaths in childbirth and food
shortages that are part and parcel of such tra
ditions. In fact, I seem to have neglected that
et in Arcadia ego is a memento mori, if we're
talking Latin phrase usage.
This all brings us to that distasteful
phrase: "Ignorance is bliss." In a baffling af
front to human logic, presumably rooted in
Romantic excess sown by a certain
Rousseau, the Holden in all of us yearns for
the "innocent" state before knowledge. This
is, incidentally, also the infantile state. But not
only is this not possible; it's not even desir
able. Since this phrase has gained currency
particularly in situations where one person
finds out their significant other has cheated,
let's take Tiger Woods' many women/mis
tresses/girlfriends/paramours as our case
study. Is the problem (a) that his wife found
out, or (b) that he was cheating? Only in a
perverted move toward blaming the victim
does "ignorance is bliss" make sense. Knowl
edge was never the real problem.

While James Joyce may have written the first
sentence, Emily solemnly swears she wrote the
rest, mostly. Catch her in her web of lies at
ehulme@stanford.edu.
