## Tipping: It's not a town in China 
### Patrick Kozey 
I woke up on my floor.
Apparently I'd walked home from down
town Palo Alto after a friend's 21st birthday
party and had only mistaken one other room
for mine before I found it. I just didn't find
the bed.
All night, I spent what brain function I still
had converting drink prices into Euros and
being impressed at how "little" I was spend
ing. It may have invited me to buy a few more
drinks than necessary, but I still enjoyed it.
The decidedly blue tint to the lighting tried to
add to the ambiance, but all told it was still a
Tuesday, and places open until 2 in the morn
ing on Tuesdays are short on elegance. When
my friend called a cab and then wasn't al
lowed back in to tell me it had arrived, my
fate was sealed: I would stay there until clos
ing time.
Ah, and those few hours! They're a pleas
ant blur, involving an Indian, flush after start
ing some sort of new business venture, and an
aging Brit who had at some point played pro
fessional soccer for an impressive sounding
team. Oh, and a cute bartender. Not the kind
of cute you'd find dancing on a platform in
oddly stitched together white lace garments

at a beachside club in Barcelona, but she
might have been once upon a time. At one
point, she walked over to me while I was mid
sip and asked me if I was visiting. Promising,
I thought. "No, I go to school here," I said,
pointing helpfully in the direction of Stan
ford. Left, I think.
"Oh," she replied, a twinge of a smile on
her face. "Well, just so you know, if you want
to get along with the bartenders around here,
you should probably leave tips." Less prom
ising. After she walked away to take an order,
I fished around in my pockets but found all I
had was a dollar bill, a few quarters and, for
some reason, a condom. I elected not to put
any of those objects on the bar.
Oh, America. Tipping was something that
I'd really almost forgotten after a few months
away. Sure, in a culture where good service is
not compensated with extra money, there's
likely to be less of it, but it seems more hon
est, too. I always feel pained watching waiters
or bartenders go through the motions of con
viviality in anticipation of a monetary re
ward. Some pull it off of course, and regard
less, I normally oblige, having once been in
structed in the ways of restaurant work. But
four months away was refreshing.
Though I enjoy some of our restaurant

customs offering water (for free!) and
providing refills ( mostly for free!), for in
stance sometimes, it is nice to simply be
left alone, given space to breathe and time to
talk. You could stay in a small Spanish cafete
ria until they were about to close before
they'd think to say anything to you. Plus, the
only cute girls who ever expected me to pay
them for their company was the girls at
George Payne's (see previous columns) sell
ing over priced Jell-o shots and signing peo
ple up to their mailing list. Also, actual pros
titutes.
As my reintegration into American socie
ty continues, I imagine, dear reader, there will
be more bumps in the road like this. More
times where the minutiae becomes all that
matters. The anxieties that bubble up in those
moments will find expression here, so thanks
in advance for sticking with me.
So, remember, folks, I'll be here all quar
ter, the veal is excellent and don't forget to
tip your waitress or not, depending on
which practice is culturally appropriate.
