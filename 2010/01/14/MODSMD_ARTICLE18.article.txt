## Cardinal faces bottom-of-the-pack Huskies Stanford men travel to Washington 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
After opening the Pacific-10 sea
son with a demoralizing 92-66 loss at
California, Stanford men's basket
ball proved itself anything but de
moralized. Instead, the Card re
turned to the court hungry for a win
and determined to prove itself a con
ference contender. Cal's disappoint
ment was quickly erased with a we
can-win-at-the-end victory over
USC, followed quickly by a we-can
win-decisively stomping of UCLA.
The one caveat? Both were home
games and the only win Stanford has
outside of Maples is a 57-52 victory
over Virginia in the Cancun Chal
lenge. Now, only one question re
mains for the Cardinal: can they win
on the road?
Luckily for Stanford, the team's
first away game since the Bears is a
meeting with the team currently at
the bottom of Pac-10 rankings, the
Washington Huskies. The Huskies
are 1-3 in the conference al
though 10-5 overall after winning
their first game against Oregon
State, then dropping three in a row
to Oregon (home) and the Arizona
schools (on the road).
However, Washington does boast
the conference's leading scoring of
fence, which averages 79.6 points per
game. In its last two games, though,
Stanford has held its opponents to
53 and 59 points, respectively, and
head coach Johnny Dawkins hopes
the trend will continue in Seattle.
"I thought our defense was terrif
ic [in the last few games]," Dawkins
said. "We were very active, we forced
turnovers and more importantly, we
didn't give up many easy baskets.
Holding our opponents under 60 is
very good and it's a standard that we
want to set, where we become a very
stingy defensive team."
This stingy defense will have its
work cut out for it against Washing
ton senior forward Quincy Pondex
ter and sophomore guard Isaiah
Thomas. The duo rank third and fifth
in the Pac-10 in scoring, putting up
19.5 and 18.3 ppg, respectively. Pon
dexter also snags an average of 7.9
rebounds and knocks down 81.3 per
cent of his free throws. He'll be Card

standout Landry Fields' toughest
match-up of the season thus far, but
will also be a warm-up for Saturday's
standoff with the conference's lead
ing scorer from Washington State,
Klay Thompson. (Thompson and
Fields are the only two who top Pon
dexter in scoring, tallying 23 and 22.1
ppg, respectively.)
"[Washington State has] one of
the best players in the conference in
Klay Thompson, who is a terrific, ter
rific scorer," Dawkins said. "Our
match-ups with Landry Fields, ver
sus him and Pondexter, are key
match-ups for us. Those are three of
the best players in our conference
and we need our guy Landry
to be the player he's been all year.
And that's a rock for us and one of
the best players in our conference."
The backcourt battle will prove
equally important against the
Fluskies, as Stanford sophomore Je
remy Green falls just behind
Thomas in scoring for the year with
17.6 ppg. But, he has spent his last
two outings leading the team, with
17 against the Trojans and 30 against
the Bruins. Green hits roughly three
shots from long range every time out
making him the Pac-10's best
three-point shooter offering a
threat that Thomas has yet to match.
After Stanford's own comeback
from a slow season start, Dawkins is
taking nothing for granted and
knows Washington will be looking
for a win tonight.

GAME NOTES: After two wins on the Farm, the
Cardinal takes its game on the road to see if
it can continue its two-game winning streak
when it takes on Washington today. The
Huskies, the lowest ranked team in the Pac
- 10, come off a three-game losing streak.

After defeating both L.A. teams at home, Stanford travels to Washington to face the Huskies, currently last in the
Pac-10 standings. But despite the rankings, Washington's impressive offence might prove a struggle for the Card.
