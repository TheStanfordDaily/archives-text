## No. 2 Stanford hopes to repeat history 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal will return to Maples Pavil
ion to kick off its first two-game weekend of
2010 tonight, hosting the Washington State
Cougars before facing the Washington
Huskies on Saturday. Stanford (13-1,3-0 Pa
cific-10 Conference) will look to continue its
perfect Pac-10 season and maintain its No. 2
national ranking.
This weekend in particular, Stanford is
playing with history both recent and long
term firmly on its side. The last time the
Cardinal hosted the Cougars (5-10, 0-4 Pac
-10) and the Huskies (8-6,3-1 Pac-10), they ran
them right off the court. They cruised past the

Huskies in a 112-35 rout the biggest win in
conference history before earning a simi
larly comfortable 102-53 victory over the
Cougars.
Last year, both Washington schools faced
the Cardinal with overall records around .500.
The Huskies are faring somewhat better so far
this year with just one conference loss, while
the Cougars tonight's opponent have
yet to win in the Pac-10. The Huskies swept
the Arizona schools last weekend, while the
Cougars got swept themselves.
But regardless of match history and of the
opponents' recent play, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer is intent on staying focused.
"It really doesn't matter who you're play
ing," VanDerveer said. "Every game we play

in our league gives us challenges. Washington
State has quick, penetrating players that we'll
have trouble with if we don't stop. If you don't
come out with an aggressive mindset re
membering that we're here at home, this is our
court then yes, you risk losing to a team
that might not have a solid record right now.
But records and statistics are irrelevant. You
have to come out and get the job done."
Senior captain Jayne Appel, recently
named a midseason candidate for the Los An
geles Athletic Club's Wooden Award, agrees
that even a team like the Cougars can't be
taken lightly.
"They're an interesting team, really,"
