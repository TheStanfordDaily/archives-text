## No. 2 Stanford hopes to repeat history 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal will return to Maples Pavil
ion to kick off its first two-game weekend of
2010 tonight, hosting the Washington State
Cougars before facing the Washington
Huskies on Saturday. Stanford (13-1,3-0 Pa
cific-10 Conference) will look to continue its
perfect Pac-10 season and maintain its No. 2
national ranking.
This weekend in particular, Stanford is
playing with history both recent and long
term firmly on its side. The last time the
Cardinal hosted the Cougars (5-10, 0-4 Pac
-10) and the Huskies (8-6,3-1 Pac-10), they ran
them right off the court. They cruised past the

Huskies in a 112-35 rout the biggest win in
conference history before earning a simi
larly comfortable 102-53 victory over the
Cougars.
Last year, both Washington schools faced
the Cardinal with overall records around .500.
The Huskies are faring somewhat better so far
this year with just one conference loss, while
the Cougars tonight's opponent have
yet to win in the Pac-10. The Huskies swept
the Arizona schools last weekend, while the
Cougars got swept themselves.
But regardless of match history and of the
opponents' recent play, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer is intent on staying focused.
"It really doesn't matter who you're play
ing," VanDerveer said. "Every game we play

in our league gives us challenges. Washington
State has quick, penetrating players that we'll
have trouble with if we don't stop. If you don't
come out with an aggressive mindset re
membering that we're here at home, this is our
court then yes, you risk losing to a team
that might not have a solid record right now.
But records and statistics are irrelevant. You
have to come out and get the job done."
Senior captain Jayne Appel, recently
named a midseason candidate for the Los An
geles Athletic Club's Wooden Award, agrees
that even a team like the Cougars can't be
taken lightly.
"They're an interesting team, really,"

GAME NOTES: Stanford hopes to maintain its No. 2
national ranking and undefeated Pac-10 record in
its battle against the Cougars tonight at 7 p.m. In
its last home game against Washington State,
Stanford soundly defeated them 102-53.

Appel said. "They have a lot of young
players, a lot of sophomores, espe
cially at guard, and while they may
not have done well last weekend, we
have to understand that we've got a
target on our back as the number
two team in the nation. We need to
remember that everyone who we
play circles that game on their calen
dar and they're trying to take that
away from us."
Appel has been a major contribu
tor during her time on the Farm,
earning the Pac-10 Player of the Year
Award last season and essentially be
coming the face of the team since the
departure of Candice Wiggins. So far
in 2009-10, however, the Pleasant
Hill, Calif., native hasn't had many of
the lights-out performances that
have characterized her career. She
currently is third on the team in scor
ing with 13.1 points per game (with
most of the conference season left to
play), whereas she led the Cardinal
last season with an overall 16.1 ppg
more than five points better than
the second-place Kayla Pederson.
"I don't really think I'm at the
standard that I set for myself," Appel
said. "I've had a few games so far that
I've played well, but I definitely
haven't had a great game. But right
now we've got Nneka and Kayla and
other players who are playing out of
this world, so I'm trying to get them
the ball if that's what get's us a 'W.' I
think that's part of being a captain,
learning how to get them the ball if
that's who's hot."

One player Appel will look to
support offensively this weekend is
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. The

redshirt senior, long praised by her
coach and teammates for her pesky
defense on the perimeter, has lately
been just as impressive with her of
fense. She had a career-high 18 points
in the Cardinal's win over UCLA last
weekend, including four three-point
ers, and combined with Nnemkadi
Ogwumike to go six-for-six as the
Bruins nearly closed the gap in the
second half.
"I think Ros can contribute more
offensively now, after putting in a lot
of work on her shot over the sum
mer," VanDerveer said. "She's been
shooting the ball really well in prac
tice, and I've been saying 'Ros, you
need to be looking for your shot
more.' So, she's been working hard in
practice and playing with a lot of con
fidence."

So far this season, the Cardinal has
rarely had the luxury of playing for a
full crowd of fans. This weekend,
though, the Cardinal will play its first
traditional series at Maples Pavilion
while students are on campus.
"You know, it's been really tough
this season because so many of our
games whether it's Cal, Tennessee
or Duke have been over break,
and it means a lot for the team to
have the enthusiasm that the stu
dents bring," VanDerveer said. "So, I
hope a lot of them will come this
weekend and get their chance to see
our young players, and how much
Nneka and our freshmen have im
proved. I think it will be fun for
them."

The Cardinal will host the
Cougars tonight at 7 p.m., and the
Huskies on Saturday at 2 p.m. Both
games will be in Maples Pavilion and
will be broadcast live on 90.1 FM
KZSU.
