## MBA grads facing low employment rate 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
Two years after entering MBA
programs, business school gradu
ates are now finding that the job
market they left holds little simi
larity to the one they're returning
to.
A declining economy and
changing employment opportuni
ties have more and more gradu
ates of even the most prestigious
business schools waiting longer
for job offers after graduation.
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business (GSB) is consistently
ranked in the top five business
schools in the nation, but employ
ment statistics for its graduates
have shown a sharp downturn in
the past year for the Class of 2009.
For the Classes of 2005 to 2008,
the percentage of GSB graduates
seeking employment who accept
ed offers by three months after
graduation has stayed steady
around 94 percent, with 98 per
cent of the Class of 2008 receiving
job offers and 93 percent accept
ing offers by three months post
graduation.
The Class of 2009, however,
had less optimistic prospects. At
graduation, 74 percent of gradu
ates seeking employment had job
offers and only 69 percent had
accepted positions. Three months
later, still only 90 percent had
offers and only 85 percent had
accepted employment.
The near-eight percent drop in
three-month post-graduation
employment rate from 2008 to
2009 reflects a drastic change in
an economy that may not
rebound for several years. The
change is similarly evident at the
prestigious UC-Berkeley Haas
School of Business three
months after graduation, just 85.4
percent of the Class of 2009 had
received job offers, when the
number had held steady at 95 per
cent since 2006.
"Obviously, the fundamental
hiring environment deteriorated

throughout the year in response
to the uncertainty around the eco
nomic crisis," wrote Pulin Sanghvi
MBA '97, assistant dean and
director at the GSB's Career
Management Center, in an e-mail
to The Daily. "A greater propor
tion of MBA recruiters moved
their recruiting processes toward
'just in time' hiring, which left
fewer opportunities that could be
secured by students months in
advance,"
Sanghvi also said that, in the
hopes that the economy would
improve and in order to avoid
companies' hiring freezes, many
graduating students postponed
their job searches from fall to
spring. The crisis, however, only
heightened in the spring; as a
result, many 2009 graduates were
forced to push their job searches
until much later in the year, often
undertaking short-term or entre
preneurial projects in the mean
time.
Current GSB students agree
that the economic crisis played a
role in the drop in employment
rate. But they also suggest that
students, in this uncertain eco
nomic climate, are tending to wait
longer for a "dream job" than
accepting whatever comes along.
First-year GSB student John
Krzywicki explained that the eco
nomic downturn resulted in fewer
students with multiple offers and
fewer students with desired offers,
leaving more students holding out
longer for a specific job.
"People come to the GSB with
high expectations," Krzywicki
said. "They think, 'Why should I
settle?' and they extend their
search a bit longer."
Krzywicki predicted that
despite the drop in MBA gradu
ate employment rates, prospective
students would still seek the
degree. "Most people think that
bigger trends [in employment]
wouldn't apply to them," he said.
"More people are considering
