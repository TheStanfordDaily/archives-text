# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Swinging for Vegas victories Women already looking toward Pac-10 title 
### WILL SEATON 
The ever-talented Stanford women's
tennis program kicks off its 2010 program
this Friday at the Freeman Invitational in
Las Vegas. Led by head coach Lele
Forood, the team will seek a return to the
top of the national rankings and to recap
ture the Pacific-10 title.
Forood is heading into her 10th year
coaching the Cardinal. She has had an ac
complished career, including being
named the 2003 National Coach of the
Year and the three-time Pac-10 Coach of
the Year (2004, 2005, 2007). The team's
record is an astounding 233-15 under her
leadership and she was the first female
head coach to win the NCAA team title
when she went 30-0, 8-0 Pac-10 in 2001,
her maiden season.
"We've set this year up schedule-wise
to put our primary focus on winning the
Pac-10 title again," Forood said. "Last
year was our first year in over 20 years
that we didn't win the conference title
and it's a big goal of ours again this year.
When you win the conference title, it
means you're one of the top three teams
in the country because our conference is
so strong."
As for the team, they're pretty impres
sive in their own right. Stanford women's
tennis has a record-shattering 151 home
match winning streak, the longest active
home streak of any intercollegiate sport
in NCAA Division I history; the streak
dates back to the 1999 season. They have
fully dominated at home for the past
decade. They have made 28 consecutive
NCAA tournament appearances and
reached the round of 16 for the 24th
straight season last year, finishing with a
final record of 19-5.
Unfortunately for the 2010 team, it
will face a little extra scrutiny this year de
spite its national No. 13 ranking. The Car
dinal has seen a progressive slide in post
season victories since 2006, the last year
they won the championship. A semifinal
in 2007, a quarterfinal in 2008 and an ap
pearance in the round of 16 last year all
suggest that the program may be entering
a lull. Last season's finish of third in the
Pac-10, snapping a streak of 21 consecu
tive Pac-10 titles, doesn't help their de
fense either.
"It is definitely possible [to win the
Pac-10 again], otherwise we wouldn't put
it out there as a goal. It's not going to be
easy," Farood said. "Cal's team got to the
final, UCLA is always top 10 and Wash
ington has two top players, so it'll be a
huge challenge for us, but even in years
that we won it, they had been that good
too."
Stanford does have the players it
needs to dominate nationally again
though. Senior Lindsay Burdette finished
the 2008-09 season with a 21-10 record,
including 27-8 in doubles with her partner
junior Hilary Barte.The pair reached the
national championship match, but lost to
California's Mari Andersson and Jana Ju
ricova 6-3,6-4. The two have appeared in
good form in the fall indoor season. They
captured the doubles title at the ITA Na
tional Indoor Championships as the tour
nament's No. 2 seed after defeating Ten
nessee's Natalie Pluskota and Caitlin
Whoriskey 6-4,3-6,7-6 (4).
Barte is one of the star singles players
for the team as well. She was named
Pac-10 Player of the Year last year,
earning All-American honors in sin
gles and doubles and finishing the
year with a national singles ranking of
No. 9. She led the team with a 35-6
record while playing at the No. 1 spot.
"We have a really interesting mix
of players this year," Farood said. "We
have a really good blend of very expe
rienced players and very talented
freshmen and sophomores who know
what it takes to win. We have a really
nice balance for the team."

Mallory Burdette, Lindsay's sister,
is just a freshman and already big
things are expected. Her performance
in the Saint Mary's Invitational in Oc
tober propelled her to be crowned sin
gles champion of the Red Division,
defeating the No. 2-seed, Pacific's
Jenifer Widjaja, 6-4,6-1 in the champi
onship while knocking off the No. 1-
seed Alexandra Poorta on the way.
Mallory also combined with fellow
freshman Stacy Tan during the ITA
Northwest Regional Championships,
making a run to the semifinals before
losing to Cal's Andersson and Jurico
va 8-1.

When asked about Mallory, Fa
rood responded, "I think she is al
ready one of the top players in college
tennis. Winning that tournament
that was a pretty strong tournament

and the fact that she's ranked in the
top 20 immediately are very impor
tant."

Another rising freshman star is
Stacy Tan. With a record of 5-3 for the
year, Tan's best result was a semifinal
performance at the Saint Mary's Invi
tational, which she followed up with a
Round of 16 appearance at the ITA

Northwest Regionals.
"Stacy's results were very close to
the top," Farood said. "She had match
point on the number 10 team in the re
gion. She's right there as well and we
just have to get this team started."
The women's team played an exhi
bition against Hawai'i, prevailing 5-2
in their final fall action before spring
Pac-10 play. Barte/Burdette won their
No. 1 doubles action 8-4 as the Cardi
nal swept the doubles 3-0. In singles.

the two won their respective singles
matches in straight sets. Stacy Tan and

Natalie Dillon were both edged in
tough three-setters, but Stanford left
the court with the win.

Following the Freeman Invitation
al, the team will travel to Indian Wells
to compete in the NCTC Classic be
fore returning to Stanford for a two
game home stand against Hawai'i
(1/27) and UC Davis (2/02). Pac-10
team play starts against UCLA and
USC at their courts in late February.

Mallory Burdette, Lindsay's sister,
is just a freshman and already big
things are expected. Her performance
in the Saint Mary's Invitational in Oc
tober propelled her to be crowned sin
gles champion of the Red Division,
defeating the No. 2-seed, Pacific's
Jenifer Widjaja, 6-4,6-1 in the champi
onship while knocking off the No. 1-
seed Alexandra Poorta on the way.
Mallory also combined with fellow
freshman Stacy Tan during the ITA
Northwest Regional Championships,
making a run to the semifinals before
losing to Cal's Andersson and Jurico
va 8-1.

When asked about Mallory, Fa
rood responded, "I think she is al
ready one of the top players in college
tennis. Winning that tournament
that was a pretty strong tournament

and the fact that she's ranked in the
top 20 immediately are very impor
tant."

Another rising freshman star is
Stacy Tan. With a record of 5-3 for the
year, Tan's best result was a semifinal
performance at the Saint Mary's Invi
tational, which she followed up with a
Round of 16 appearance at the ITA

Northwest Regionals.
"Stacy's results were very close to
the top," Farood said. "She had match
point on the number 10 team in the re
gion. She's right there as well and we
just have to get this team started."
The women's team played an exhi
bition against Hawai'i, prevailing 5-2
in their final fall action before spring
Pac-10 play. Barte/Burdette won their
No. 1 doubles action 8-4 as the Cardi
nal swept the doubles 3-0. In singles.

Women's tennis travels to Las Vegas for the Freeman Invitational on Friday
to open their spring season. Having defeated Hawai'i 5-2 in their last match
of the fall, they look to begin their Pac-10 title quest strongly this weekend.
The ever-talented Stanford women's
tennis program kicks off its 2010 program
this Friday at the Freeman Invitational in
Las Vegas. Led by head coach Lele
Forood, the team will seek a return to the
top of the national rankings and to recap
ture the Pacific-10 title.
Forood is heading into her 10th year
coaching the Cardinal. She has had an ac
complished career, including being
named the 2003 National Coach of the
Year and the three-time Pac-10 Coach of
the Year (2004, 2005, 2007). The team's
record is an astounding 233-15 under her
leadership and she was the first female
head coach to win the NCAA team title
when she went 30-0, 8-0 Pac-10 in 2001,
her maiden season.
"We've set this year up schedule-wise
to put our primary focus on winning the
Pac-10 title again," Forood said. "Last
year was our first year in over 20 years
that we didn't win the conference title
and it's a big goal of ours again this year.
When you win the conference title, it
means you're one of the top three teams
in the country because our conference is
so strong."
As for the team, they're pretty impres
sive in their own right. Stanford women's
tennis has a record-shattering 151 home
match winning streak, the longest active
home streak of any intercollegiate sport
in NCAA Division I history; the streak
dates back to the 1999 season. They have
fully dominated at home for the past
decade. They have made 28 consecutive
NCAA tournament appearances and
reached the round of 16 for the 24th
straight season last year, finishing with a
final record of 19-5.
Unfortunately for the 2010 team, it
will face a little extra scrutiny this year de
spite its national No. 13 ranking. The Car
dinal has seen a progressive slide in post
season victories since 2006, the last year
they won the championship. A semifinal
in 2007, a quarterfinal in 2008 and an ap
pearance in the round of 16 last year all
suggest that the program may be entering
a lull. Last season's finish of third in the
Pac-10, snapping a streak of 21 consecu
tive Pac-10 titles, doesn't help their de
fense either.
"It is definitely possible [to win the
Pac-10 again], otherwise we wouldn't put
it out there as a goal. It's not going to be
easy," Farood said. "Cal's team got to the
final, UCLA is always top 10 and Wash
ington has two top players, so it'll be a
huge challenge for us, but even in years
that we won it, they had been that good
too."
Stanford does have the players it
needs to dominate nationally again
though. Senior Lindsay Burdette finished
the 2008-09 season with a 21-10 record,
including 27-8 in doubles with her partner
junior Hilary Barte.The pair reached the
national championship match, but lost to
California's Mari Andersson and Jana Ju
ricova 6-3,6-4. The two have appeared in
good form in the fall indoor season. They
captured the doubles title at the ITA Na
tional Indoor Championships as the tour
nament's No. 2 seed after defeating Ten
nessee's Natalie Pluskota and Caitlin
Whoriskey 6-4,3-6,7-6 (4).
Barte is one of the star singles players
for the team as well. She was named
Pac-10 Player of the Year last year,
earning All-American honors in sin
gles and doubles and finishing the
year with a national singles ranking of
No. 9. She led the team with a 35-6
record while playing at the No. 1 spot.
"We have a really interesting mix
of players this year," Farood said. "We
have a really good blend of very expe
rienced players and very talented
freshmen and sophomores who know
what it takes to win. We have a really
nice balance for the team."
