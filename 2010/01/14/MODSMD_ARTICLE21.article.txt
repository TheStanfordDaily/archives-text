# The
						endless, hopeless quest of the Clippers

Prominent, organized, popu
lar, glorious, fortunate, sane.
What do these words have in
common?
None of them have ever been
used to describe the Los Angeles
Clippers.
For the Staples Center's second
favorite tenant, life has been all but
rainbows and butterflies. As an or
ganization, the Clips have been
marred by bad luck and bad manage
ment, dismal coaching and dismal at
tendance, freak injuries and freak
personalities and Michael
Olowokandi. Just today, news broke
that the 2009 No. 1 overall pick and
(possible) future phenom, Blake
Griffin the Clippers alleged rem
edy to a generation of failure will
miss the entire season due to a linger
ing knee injury.
The loss of Griffin is a tremen

dous emotional blow to the few re
maining soldiers of Clippers nation.
He was the now. He was the future.
Now, he's following the lead Port
land's Greg Oden, sitting for his en
tire rookie season with the infamous
always-treatable-but-never-fully-re
pairable knee injury.
It's not that the 17-19 Clippers are
deprived of talent. On the contrary,
the team is shockingly deep with
skilled players. Baron Davis (who
came over in 2008 with the promise
of former Clipper Elton Brand that
they would build a dynasty, only to
have Brand chunk up the deuce and
peace to Philadelphia) is still one of
the best point guards of the new mil
lennium. Combo guard Eric Gordon,
baby fat and all, is a star in the mak
ing. Hell, even Chris Kaman, who
looks like he was plucked straight
from a Geico commercial, is a top-15

center.
One of the major problems in re
cent years, as showcased by Mr. Grif
fin, is that the Staples Center, when
adorned in red and white, is where
limbs come to die. Shaun Livingston,
the No. 4 overall pick in the 2007
draft, suffered a disturbingly grue
some knee injury and never returned
to form. The aforementioned Brand,
who had displayed the skills and ath
leticism of an elite power forward,
missed nearly the entire 2007-08 sea
son. Even Marcus Camby, the former
UMass star and paint patroller, could
only play in 62 games last year.
As emasculating as this is to
admit, I really like the Clippers. It's
more than just a love for the under-
