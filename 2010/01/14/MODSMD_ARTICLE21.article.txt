# The 						endless, hopeless quest of the Clippers

### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Prominent, organized, popu
lar, glorious, fortunate, sane.
What do these words have in
common?
None of them have ever been
used to describe the Los Angeles
Clippers.
For the Staples Center's second
favorite tenant, life has been all but
rainbows and butterflies. As an or
ganization, the Clips have been
marred by bad luck and bad manage
ment, dismal coaching and dismal at
tendance, freak injuries and freak
personalities and Michael
Olowokandi. Just today, news broke
that the 2009 No. 1 overall pick and
(possible) future phenom, Blake
Griffin the Clippers alleged rem
edy to a generation of failure will
miss the entire season due to a linger
ing knee injury.
The loss of Griffin is a tremen

dous emotional blow to the few re
maining soldiers of Clippers nation.
He was the now. He was the future.
Now, he's following the lead Port
land's Greg Oden, sitting for his en
tire rookie season with the infamous
always-treatable-but-never-fully-re
pairable knee injury.
It's not that the 17-19 Clippers are
deprived of talent. On the contrary,
the team is shockingly deep with
skilled players. Baron Davis (who
came over in 2008 with the promise
of former Clipper Elton Brand that
they would build a dynasty, only to
have Brand chunk up the deuce and
peace to Philadelphia) is still one of
the best point guards of the new mil
lennium. Combo guard Eric Gordon,
baby fat and all, is a star in the mak
ing. Hell, even Chris Kaman, who
looks like he was plucked straight
from a Geico commercial, is a top-15

center.
One of the major problems in re
cent years, as showcased by Mr. Grif
fin, is that the Staples Center, when
adorned in red and white, is where
limbs come to die. Shaun Livingston,
the No. 4 overall pick in the 2007
draft, suffered a disturbingly grue
some knee injury and never returned
to form. The aforementioned Brand,
who had displayed the skills and ath
leticism of an elite power forward,
missed nearly the entire 2007-08 sea
son. Even Marcus Camby, the former
UMass star and paint patroller, could
only play in 62 games last year.
As emasculating as this is to
admit, I really like the Clippers. It's
more than just a love for the under-

dog; I enjoy car crashes. This team
just does everything it possibly can to
prevent success. And although this is
one of the most injury-plagued fran
chises in the history of professional
sports, it would be ignorant to place
the blame solely on the shoulders
or should I say knees of a few in
dividual players.
Since its founding in 1970, the
Clippers organization has had six
winning seasons. Six. Just to put this
into perspective, since 1970, their
roommates, the Los Angeles Lakers,
have had five losing seasons. Yeah I
get it, the Lakers had Kareem,
Magic, Kobe and Shaq, while the
Clippers had Darius Miles, Quentin
Richardson, Zach Randolph and the
exoskeleton of Olowokandi. Hon
estly, without Bill Simmons, the
media coverage of the Clippers

would be virtually extinct and no
body would notice or care. My crys
tal ball is predicting a brighter
decade for the Kansas City Royals
than for L.A.'s ugly child.
Why? For one, the Clippers
owner, Donald Sterling, is a racist
billionaire who spends more time
choosing which lawyers to hire in set
tling housing discrimination lawsuits
than choosing which coaches to hire
in solving horrific defensive ineffi
ciency. You think this is a joke, until
you realize that he had to fork over
five million dollars to minority plain
tiffs whom he allegedly denied hous
ing in Los Angeles' Koreatown.
What's more, he was sued by former
employee Elgin Baylor for racial dis
crimination when Sterling refused to
raise his relatively low salary of
$335,000. It's Elgin freaking Baylor;
you can't badmouth the legend, let
alone display your bigotry. Karma is
a bitch, isn't it?
His most notorious hire, current
head coach and general manager
Mike Dunleavy Sr., seems on the sur

face to be moderately successful.
He's currently the third longest
tenured coach in the NBA, in the
middle of his seventh season at the
helm and trails only legendary
coaches Jerry Sloan and Greg Pop
povich on that list.
But in traditional Clips fashion, a
closer look reveals that he's had as
much success at being head coach as
Jersey Shore's Snooki has had avoid
ing black eyes.
Dunleavy has recorded one win
ning season in his relatively lengthy
reign and he's missed the playoffs in
five of the last six seasons. As GM,
he's been responsible for several
skeptical moves. From 2007 to 2009,
he won a combined 42 games. You
can give the dude two seasons and he
can barely eclipse a single-season
.500 record of 41 victories!
The future of this franchise is no
less than dire. With Sterling driving
the management bus and Dunleavy
sitting shotgun, it's hard to be opti
mistic. Winning isn't exactly com
monplace and instead of fixing

what's broken the organization
seems more content playing down to
its hilariously awful reputation.
Every single year for as long as I re
member — except for possibly the
playoff anomaly of the 2005-06 sea
son there has been talk of Dun
leavy's axing. But it just won't hap
pen. There is no way Sterling and
Dunleavy are completely oblivious
to how bad their team sucks, but how
many years do the terrible two really
need to figure things out?
In the immediate future, there's
no clear solution. The Clippers are
well on their way to another appear
ance in the lottery and are in perfect
shape to royally blow a valuable pick
on draft day. But hell, I have faith.
Every team has to win at one point or
another, right?
On second thought, better hope
Leßron goes Hollywood.
