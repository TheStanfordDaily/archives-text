# TRACK AND FIELD
## Indoor Season Opener New freshmen and large numbers will hopefully boost scoreboard this season 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Following over a quarter of preparation, the Stanford
track and field team finds itself facing the first meet of
year, as well as the first meet of the indoor season. As they
head to Seattle for the University of Washington Indoor
Preview, the Cardinal men and women will immediately
be thrust into tough competition. The team is prepared to
start the season with strong runs and personal bests.
With a recruiting class of over thirty, the Cardinal faces
the exciting prospect of new talent that could both sur
prise and overwhelm opponents. This depth will prove
particularly useful in the distance events, which require
mental strength in addition to physical prowess. The Stan
ford runners should be able to utilize their large numbers
to create a strong running pack that will overpower the
competition.

The freshmen will play a key role in maximizing the
team's scoring and in increasing the team's potential to
win a championship title.

"The freshmen this year are just great," said junior
Maddie Duhon. "There's a huge amount of enthusiasm
and talent in this class across all event groups, so it will be
exciting to see how they contribute to the team's success
this year and beyond."

Indeed, a strong recruiting class such as this one not
only indicates a favorable season, but also promises a
bright future for the program.

"The attitude that the freshman adopt will affect the
program for years to come," agreed sophomore Chris
Derrick. "If, as a collective group, they dedicate them
selves to Stanford track and field, we could see some real
ly great results in the years to come; the first few weeks
leave me optimistic that that will happen."
With such a large class size, the coaching staff must
make sure to channel the talent in the proper direction, so
that the sheer number of runners does not become over
whelming. The advantage of such a wide selection pool,
however, is that the Cardinal can now
be represented in events that previ
ously went neglected, bringing more
potential points to the team. Men's
high jump, for example, has frequent
ly gone without Stanford participa
tion, but freshman Jules Sharpe now
seems to be a promising talent in the
event.

Other freshmen that will make
their mark on the men's side will be
Spencer Chase in sprints and Tyler
Stutzman and Andrew Berberick in
distance.
As the freshmen look forward to
competing for Stanford for the first
time this weekend, they hope for a
memorable experience that will give
them an introduction to the collegiate
level of competition.
"This weekend will be a good
chance for us to get reacquainted with
indoor track," said senior Kate

Niehaus. "I am especially excited for
these freshmen who haven't raced yet
in the Stanford uniform; doing that for
the first time is such a thrill!"

The indoor season presents itself
as the first competitive arena for most
collegiate track teams, just a few
months before the much-anticipated
outdoor season. But indoor races are
not just a warm-up the competi
tion remains just as stiff, giving the
athletes a chance to establish them
selves in the track and field communi
ty-

"Although indoor is sometimes
considered as just a stepping stone for
outdoor track, no one really holds
back when it comes to race day,"
Duhon confirmed. "We still compete
against many of the same athletes and
our goals are the same: to be our best
and win."

Indeed, both the men's and
women's teams hold season goals of
victory in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation and qualification of as
many athletes as possible for the
NCAA Indoor Championships.
So does a day in the life of one of

these track and field athletes really
look like? In addition to the incessant
ly stressful academic life of The Farm,
these student-athletes also spend
hours practicing and traveling, espe
cially during the indoor season when
all meets take place in other locations.

"Life as a student-athlete is almost
always busy," Niehaus agreed, "but I
really love running, the team and com
peting I could imagine my time in
college no other way!"
Indeed, the joy of being a part of
the team, as well as the pride of run
ning for Stanford, keeps these athletes
motivated and focused.

"Running for Stanford is some
thing that I take pride in," Derrick af
firmed. "At the end of the day I enjoy
both the end result of athletic success
as well as the process of working to
ward it rewards are more fulfilling
when they are earned through hard
work and in that sense, there is
nothing more rewarding for me than
track and field."
