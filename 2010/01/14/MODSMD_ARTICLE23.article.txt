# ARIZ. OFFERS CHANCE TO REBOUND
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the Cardinal women's gym
nastics team faced the University of
Georgia in its first meet of the sea
son, it was well aware of the serious
challenge that stood before them.
Not only was Stanford contending
with the five-time national champi
ons and current top-ranked team,
but it was also competing before
10,224 opposing fans in the bleach
ers of Georgia's Stegeman Colise
um. Hopes were high and pressure
was higher, but in the end, Georgia
barely edged out the Card for a
195.150-195.050 victory.
According to head coach Kristen
Smyth, however, the Stanford
women had every right to head
back to the Farm with heads held
high, after what she deemed a "real
ly good start to the season."
"We performed really well and
handled all the factors beautifully,"
Smyth said. "We focused on our
selves, which is always what we
strive to do. The girls covered one
another and had each other's backs
and that really allowed us to com
pete with confidence."
The team hopes this confidence
will carry them into this weekend's
home meet against the University
of Arizona. The No. 20 Wildcats will
likely pose less of a challenge than
No. 1 Georgia, but nonetheless, fans
can expect an exciting match-up
this Sunday in Burnham Pavilion.
In last year's dual meet with Ari
zona, Stanford reigned supreme,
achieving a 195.575-195.175 win to
preserve its perfect 8-0 record. How
ever, the team's overall performance
was far from flawless, as they were
outscored by the Wildcats in two
events and finished with a season
low score. Parts of the meet were un
doubtedly rough, but solid perform
ances from team members Carly
Janiga, Nicole Ourada and Shelley
Alexander helped the Cardinal hold
off No. 24 Arizona and achieve their
eighth victory and best-ever start to
the season.

Now as the 2010 Stanford
women enter this Sunday's meet,
they again expect to come out on
top. This time, however, they will
have the tremendous contributions
from freshman Ashley Morgan, a
particular standout at the Georgia

meet last weekend. In her collegiate
debut, Morgan proved her aggres
sive and confident nature and she
showed just how easily she can
compete with anyone, despite her
age. Smyth praised Morgan for a
"fantastic job," and she has no
doubt that everyone can expect
equally stellar performances from
the freshman this Sunday and for
the remainder of the season.

Overall, there are a few changes
that will be made in the team's ap
proach to the upcoming meet; there
will also be several differences from
last weekend in terms of the compe
tition's atmosphere. For one, senior
co-captain Allyse Ishino plans to em
ploy a new release on the bars and
these improvements should substan
tiate the team's overall goal of creat
ing more depth in its all-around
game.

In addition, unlike last weekend,
this Sunday the teams will engage in
an exhibition routine for each of the
four events, rather than for just one.
Smyth hopes the extra exhibition
routines will give the young team an
opportunity to gain more experience
in competing and receiving judge
feedback, without worrying about
scores. Ishino will be competing all
around for the first time ever with
her exhibition performance on the
floor. The exhibitions will also pre
pare the team for a Jan. 24 meet
against UCLA.

The beam stands out as a sore
point for the Cardinal, after several
rushed routines against Georgia
weren't necessarily up to standard.
They look to enhance and tighten
their beam work for Arizona. At the
same time, the women will ideally re
peat their very strong performances
on their vault, floor and bars rou
tines.

The Cardinal looks to improve
its current 0-1 record to 1-1, as it
faces a team that Smyth says is "al
ways strong and well-prepared."
Each event will be run individually,
so the fans will be able to see every
routine as it occurs. The team sees
this location as advantageous and
the gymnasts are eager to compete
in what Smyth calls a "small, inti
mate atmosphere,"
And though the gym may be
small, it holds plenty of room for
spectators. In order to increase stu
dent turnout, the meet will include

competition between the freshman
dorms to see which can provide the
most fans and the loudest cheers.
The winners will win pizzas, but
they will also see fantastic gymnas-
tics and, if all goes as planned, they

will witness a Cardinal victory,
Events will start at 2 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion this Sunday.

After barely losing to No.1 Georgia in their first meet of the season on the
road, Stanford looks forward to hosting No. 20 Arizona on their own turf.
An increased number of exhibitions will also help the team gain experience.
