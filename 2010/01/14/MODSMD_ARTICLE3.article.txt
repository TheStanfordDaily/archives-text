## Tackling mental health issues will take time Progress report on well-being shows some gains 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
It took one-and-a-half years for
Stanford's 48-member Mental
Health and Weil-Being (MHWB)
Task Force to evaluate campus
mental health issues. Addressing
these issues is likely to take years
more.
More than a year has elapsed
since the 88-page MHWB Task
Force Report was first released,

progress can be tracked on its Web
site, is comprised of health profes

Initiatives, Education and
Outreach, and Policies and
Practices.

Committee has been able to post
several gains.
