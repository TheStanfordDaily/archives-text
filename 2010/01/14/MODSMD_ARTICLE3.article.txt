## Tackling mental health issues will take time Progress report on well-being shows some gains 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
It took one-and-a-half years for
Stanford's 48-member Mental
Health and Weil-Being (MHWB)
Task Force to evaluate campus
mental health issues. Addressing
these issues is likely to take years
more.
More than a year has elapsed
since the 88-page MHWB Task
Force Report was first released,
and the University is still in the
information-gathering phase. In
that time, "mental health" has
become a buzzword, the Wellness
Room has sprung up and students
seeking counseling have
increased, according to
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) Director Ronald
Albucher.
Still, tackling the report's list of
18 wide-ranging recommenda
tions has proven to be a sluggish
process. While the MHWB
Oversight Committee, the body
formed in October 2008 to moni
tor the report's implementation,
has made gains in certain areas,
many of the proposals remain in
the discussion stage.

"The Oversight Committee is
focusing on qualitative and quan
titative measures to assess
progress at this point," wrote
MHWB Initiative Project
Manager Ralph Castro, also the
manager for Health Promotion
Services (HPS) Substance Abuse
Prevention Program, in an e-mail
to The Daily.
"A lot of the year has been
building a new framework for
looking at the recommendations
and gathering information," said
ASSU student representative and
Undergraduate Health and
Wellness Co-Chair Alisha Tolani
TO.
The Committee, whose
progress can be tracked on its Web
site, is comprised of health profes
sionals, faculty members and stu
dents, who meet two to three times
throughout each quarter. The
body is subdivided into three work
groups that gather more frequent
ly: Faculty and Academic
Initiatives, Education and
Outreach, and Policies and
Practices.

Quantifying Progress
Against the odds, the Oversight
Committee has been able to post
several gains.
Many proposals have already
solidified: a change in the Academic
Calendar aimed to reduce stress, a
new course to promote happiness
and stress-reduction, the addition of
a staff position to mentor first gener
ation and low-income students and
the continuance of suicide preven
tion QPR counseling through CAPS.
Mental health has also become less
of a fringe issue, with candidates for
student government often making
mental health a part of their platforms.
"1 think that mental health issues
are something that people are
becoming more and more aware of,
which is great," wrote undergraduate
student committee member Sandra
Yen 'lO in an e-mail to The Daily. "It
is not an easy topic to talk about."
Castro also cited the critical
importance of the maintenance of
CAPS resources throughout multi
ple rounds of budget cuts in support
ing mental health efforts, as well as
the increase of funding to the gra
date Community Associate program,
which supports graduate students liv
ing in on-campus housing.
"We did take a minor hit [in fund
ing], but overall, in terms of clinical
time, there was no impact," Albucher
said. "The University really wanted
to prioritize staffing and funding for
mental health."
CAPS has undergone the most
changes since the formation of the
MHWB Task Force in 2006. Using
additional funding from the
University's general fund, CAPS
hired more staff people, a case man
agement official and a new director
Albucher in November 2008.
According to Albucher, CAPS
currently has 16 full-time equivalent
positions, along with three psychology
trainees, three psychiatry residents
and three child psychiatry fellows.
With the increase in personnel,
CAPS also shifted focus to raising
intake capabilities.
"Our goal for most students is to

get them in within a week's time of
first contact," Albucher said. After an
initial screening, CAPS will then
refer the student to the appropriate
service if necessary.
CAPS has been succeeding in
achieving this goal. According to case
intake data from October 2009, 84
percent of students were seen by a
clinician within a week of contacting
CAPS. Reasons for the 16 percent of
delays included students' requesting
specific therapists and scheduling
conflicts. In one to two percent of
cases, CAPS was unable to identify a
reason for the delay.
In the past year, there has been a
10 percent increase in requests for
counseling and a 30 percent increase
in requests for medication evaluation
and medication management,
according to Albucher. Every week,
CAPS receives between 50 and 60
requests for new evaluations the
same rate Albucher told The Daily in
November of 2008.
CAPS services, from triage to
intake to counseling, are provided
free of charge to students, paid for by
the Vaden health service fee instituted
fall quarter.
Due to resource constraints, how
ever, CAPS is unable to offer long
term counseling for most students.
'Under Review'
But not every initiative has met
with success.
For many of the recommenda
tions, the current progress merely
reads, "Under review," and the Web
site does not include updates from the
2009-10 academic year.
Tolani defended the pace of the
changes. "We're checking in frequent
ly enough I think [the outreach
working group] had four to five meet
ings last quarter and we're going as
fast as we can, keeping in mind facul
ty schedules," she said.
"Though there doesn't seem to be
a concrete deadline, the Oversight
Committee is holding to a tight dead
line," she added.
Part of the difficulty stems from
the lack of a single, proven solution
for improving mental health.

According to Yen, the Oversight
Committee has also been looking at
how other universities are combating
the same issues.
"I think the biggest problem is that
there is still a lot of stigma and people
are afraid to talk about it because
they are afraid how their peers will
respond," said ASSU Undergraduate
Health and Wellness Co-Chair Jen
Hawkins 'll.
"Often, CAPS sounds like a good
idea to students until it comes time
that they are the ones who need it,"
added committee member and Earth
Systems Prof. Julie Kennedy.
Student Involvement
If all else fails, the lasting contribu
tion of the MHWB task force may be
the collaboration between groups
working to support and raise aware
ness for mental health issues. In par
ticular, cooperation between Vaden,
HPS, CAPS and student initiatives is
on an upward swing, according to
Tolani and Hawkins.
Student groups like Stanford
Peace of Mind, the Stanford Theater
Activist Mobilization Project, the
Bridge Peer Counseling Center and
Project Love, along with the Wellness
Room, are all targeted at raising stu
dent awareness and de-stigmatizing
the issue. ITiese groups often work
with CAPS and HPS, bringing clini
cians into dorms and hosting panels.
Personal accounts of students who
have sought counseling are some of
the most effective methods of out
reach, say Hawkins and Kennedy.
The ASSU will be hosting a well
ness week in February, bringing
together various student organiza
tions and formal health services to
promote mental health.
"We want to stress that taking pos
itive steps in addressing mental illness
is really a sign of strength," Tolani
said.
