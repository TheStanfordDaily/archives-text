A magnitude 7.0 earthquake
struck Haiti late Tuesday afternoon,
inflicting major physical damage
and causing what its ambassador to
the U.S. called a "catastrophe of
major proportions" for the Western
Hemisphere's poorest nation.
According to multiple sources,
Haitian leaders fear that tens of
thousands may have died in the
event and its aftermath.
Professors Dissect the Quake
Civil and environmental engi
neering Prof. Anne Kiremidjian said
several factors made the earthquake
devastating to the island nation and
its capital, Port-au-Prince,
"First, it was a [magnitude] 7.0
earthquake a major earthquake
which means there is strong shak
ing near the fault," Kiremidjian said.
"[This type of earthquake] causes 30
kilometers, maybe even 40 kilome
ters of fault to move relative to one
another, and the epicenter was
roughly 15 kilometers from Port-au-
Prince, which implies that the city
was subjected to very strong ground
vibrations."

To make matters worse, much of
the construction in Port-au-Prince
was done with poor materials, com
pounding the damage caused by the
earthquake.
"There has been a lot of growth
in Port-au-Prince in the past 10
years [a growth of] close to two

by the lack of seismic codes," she
added. If there are any seismic
codes, she later clarified, they were
certainly not enforced.
Even engineered structures like
hotels, office buildings and bridges
were not built for earthquakes,

according to Kiremidjian.
Geophysics Prof. Paul Segall also
attributed the major damage in
Haiti to poor construction.
"I read this morning that the
mayor of Port-au-Prince had said
many of the buildings just collapse
[even] without earthquakes shaking
that's just a recipe for disaster,"
Segall said.
Segall cautioned, however, that
even more damage could follow in
the days after the initial seismic
activity. In an earthquake of this
magnitude, he indicated that after
shocks are a cause for concern.
"You always have aftershocks
after these kinds of earthquakes," he
said. "As a general rule of the
thumb, the largest aftershocks are
about 1.5 times smaller than the
original earthquake so, in this
case, about a 5.0 [aftershock],
"But even with an aftershock of a
smaller magnitude, if the buildings
are already damaged, you don't
want to take a chance with being in
that building," he added.
While the Caribbean is not usual
ly considered a seismic danger zone,
earthquakes have struck in the area
in the past. Major seismic activity in
the region, however, is separated by
hundreds of years. With high levels
of poverty, a poor economy and a
particularly active hurricane season,
the Haitian government was more
concerned with being hit by a hurri
cane not an earthquake.

"It is uncertain how burial of
the dead can even happen."

The National Palace in Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince sits in shambles the day after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit the island-nation late Tuesday
afternoon, Jan. 13. Stanford professors in part attribute the overwhelming building damages to flaws in construction, calling structures in the capital
city "recipes for disaster," made up of poor materials not suited for earthquake stability. The quake was the most powerful in Haiti's history.

Victims of the earthquake in Haiti struggle to find aid and
regroup in the aftershock. It is estimated that the devastating
quake killed thousands and injured tens of thousand more.
Regardless, Kiremidjian believes
scientists should have anticipated an
earthquake before Tuesday's disas
ter struck.
"Seismologists should have been
worried about it, given that the
country is right at the border of the
Caribbean plate and the North
American plate," she said. "There
were no earthquakes for a long time
conditions were ripe for another
earthquake,"
Geographically, most of Haiti lies
on the Gonave microplate, a thin
slice of the earth's crust between the
North American plate to the north
and Caribbean plate to the south.
The fault, according to Segall, is very
similar in structure to the San
Andreas Fault along the Californian
coast.

"It's a strike-slip fault, which
means that the motion is horizon
tal," Segall explained. "And the
earthquake was reasonably shallow,
which means it is close to buildings
and causes a lot of damage,"
Drawing a local comparison,
Segall said Tuesday's quake in Haiti
was very similar to the Loma Prieta
earthquake that Stanford and the
Bay Area experienced in 1989.
"Even though current undergrads
are too young to remember, it's still
fresh in our minds as professors," he

noted.
But, while the Loma Prieta
quake killed 63 people, casualties
stemming from Tuesday's earth
quake are estimated to be in the
tens of thousands. The main differ
ence is that construction in
California is much more resistant to
ground shaking, Segall said.
While Kiremidjian stipulates that
current efforts will focus on search
and rescue, she emphasized that
proper construction will be critical
when Haiti begins to rebuild. "It's
not a question of just pouring
money in," she said. "They need
proper structures and education to
help local people build these proper
structures, which is not a small chal
lenge."
For now, however, she said Haiti
faces a dire situation.
"The main problem is that there
is no emergency response system,
and hospitals have been damaged,"
Kiremidjian said. "Local United
Nations forces have been trying to
help, but it's just not enough
because the problem is so wide
spread. They need many more peo
ple to help them out, but it won't be
until first response teams get there
that the major relief efforts will
begin."
Stanford Lends a Hand
Only hours after disaster struck,
the events in Haiti drew tremendous
student response across the
Stanford campus. With family mem
bers still in Haiti, several students

found themselves personally affect
ed by the quake.
"I found out [about the earth
quake] Tuesday afternoon, and it
was a really hard time for me and
my family we had to wait to get
phone calls from our relatives in
Haiti," said Patricia Arty 'lO.
"I was really lucky to have gotten
confirmation and to know that all
my relatives are alive, but this was
not the case for most people in the
country," Arty added.
"I haven't heard anything partic
ularly bad, but I haven't heard good
news either," said Elijah Frazier 'l2,
who has relatives on the island. "It's
still a touchy subject for the family."
While some students anxiously
awaited phone calls to find out if
their family members were even
alive, others made headway in an
effort to amass funds for the forth
coming relief efforts.
"The Caribbean Student
Association is holding a focus group
on Friday at noon to figure out a
plan of action I'll be there,"
Frazier said. "Alpha Phi is also tak
ing some steps to help out in the
relief effort, but aside from that, I've
taken some steps of my own. I've
texted and donated to the Red
Cross and Yele Haiti." He noted
that students have donated money
to relief efforts simply by texting
"Haiti" to 90909.
Arty also indicated that Dance
Marathon is asking its participants
to donate to Partners in Health,
which was founded in Haiti.

Sylvie Rousseau 'lO, whose fam
ily lives in Haiti, drew attention to
the aftermath of the earthquake and
the nation's plight.
"The very fact that the loss of life
cannot be quantified as it can be in
any other place is telling," she wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily. "The U.N.
headquarters, the airport control
tower, the presidential palace, hospi
tals, my cousins' schools and even our
churches are destroyed. Even before
the earthquake, there was no reliable
water, phone or power service."
While Rousseau was shocked
that so much bad luck could strike
one place, she concluded that
"immediate foreign relief and sup

port is the only hope if ever devel
opment is to be resuscitated there."
Rousseau reported that all of her
immediate family is safe some
having escaped the earthquake by
only hours to fly back to school
although the homes of her neigh
bors are demolished. One great
aunt perished in the aftermath, and
her survivors scrambled to arrange
for a funeral in the midst of coping
with homelessness.
"It is uncertain how burial of the
dead can even happen under these
circumstances," she said.

means that the motion is horizon
tal," Segall explained. "And the
earthquake was reasonably shallow,
which means it is close to buildings
and causes a lot of damage,"
Drawing a local comparison,
Segall said Tuesday's quake in Haiti
was very similar to the Loma Prieta
earthquake that Stanford and the
Bay Area experienced in 1989.
"Even though current undergrads
are too young to remember, it's still
fresh in our minds as professors," he

noted.
But, while the Loma Prieta
quake killed 63 people, casualties
stemming from Tuesday's earth
quake are estimated to be in the
tens of thousands. The main differ
ence is that construction in
California is much more resistant to
ground shaking, Segall said.
While Kiremidjian stipulates that
current efforts will focus on search
and rescue, she emphasized that
proper construction will be critical
when Haiti begins to rebuild. "It's
not a question of just pouring
money in," she said. "They need
proper structures and education to
help local people build these proper
structures, which is not a small chal
lenge."
For now, however, she said Haiti
faces a dire situation.
"The main problem is that there
is no emergency response system,
and hospitals have been damaged,"
Kiremidjian said. "Local United
Nations forces have been trying to
help, but it's just not enough
because the problem is so wide
spread. They need many more peo
ple to help them out, but it won't be
until first response teams get there
that the major relief efforts will
begin."
Stanford Lends a Hand
Only hours after disaster struck,
the events in Haiti drew tremendous
student response across the
Stanford campus. With family mem
bers still in Haiti, several students

found themselves personally affect
ed by the quake.
"I found out [about the earth
quake] Tuesday afternoon, and it
was a really hard time for me and
my family we had to wait to get
phone calls from our relatives in
Haiti," said Patricia Arty 'lO.
"I was really lucky to have gotten
confirmation and to know that all
my relatives are alive, but this was
not the case for most people in the
country," Arty added.
"I haven't heard anything partic
ularly bad, but I haven't heard good
news either," said Elijah Frazier 'l2,
who has relatives on the island. "It's
still a touchy subject for the family."
While some students anxiously
awaited phone calls to find out if
their family members were even
alive, others made headway in an
effort to amass funds for the forth
coming relief efforts.
"The Caribbean Student
Association is holding a focus group
on Friday at noon to figure out a
plan of action I'll be there,"
Frazier said. "Alpha Phi is also tak
ing some steps to help out in the
relief effort, but aside from that, I've
taken some steps of my own. I've
texted and donated to the Red
Cross and Yele Haiti." He noted
that students have donated money
to relief efforts simply by texting
"Haiti" to 90909.
Arty also indicated that Dance
Marathon is asking its participants
to donate to Partners in Health,
which was founded in Haiti.

Sylvie Rousseau 'lO, whose fam
ily lives in Haiti, drew attention to
the aftermath of the earthquake and
the nation's plight.
"The very fact that the loss of life
cannot be quantified as it can be in
any other place is telling," she wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily. "The U.N.
headquarters, the airport control
tower, the presidential palace, hospi
tals, my cousins' schools and even our
churches are destroyed. Even before
the earthquake, there was no reliable
water, phone or power service."
While Rousseau was shocked
that so much bad luck could strike
one place, she concluded that
"immediate foreign relief and sup

port is the only hope if ever devel
opment is to be resuscitated there."
Rousseau reported that all of her
immediate family is safe some
having escaped the earthquake by
only hours to fly back to school
although the homes of her neigh
bors are demolished. One great
aunt perished in the aftermath, and
her survivors scrambled to arrange
for a funeral in the midst of coping
with homelessness.
"It is uncertain how burial of the
dead can even happen under these
circumstances," she said.

built in any way they could. These
structures provided very little
strength against the earthquake.
"Given the strong ground vibra

A magnitude 7.0 earthquake
struck Haiti late Tuesday afternoon,
inflicting major physical damage
and causing what its ambassador to
the U.S. called a "catastrophe of
major proportions" for the Western
Hemisphere's poorest nation.
According to multiple sources,
Haitian leaders fear that tens of
thousands may have died in the
event and its aftermath.
Professors Dissect the Quake
Civil and environmental engi
neering Prof. Anne Kiremidjian said
several factors made the earthquake
devastating to the island nation and
its capital, Port-au-Prince,
"First, it was a [magnitude] 7.0
earthquake a major earthquake
which means there is strong shak
ing near the fault," Kiremidjian said.
"[This type of earthquake] causes 30
kilometers, maybe even 40 kilome
ters of fault to move relative to one
another, and the epicenter was
roughly 15 kilometers from Port-au-
Prince, which implies that the city
was subjected to very strong ground
vibrations."

To make matters worse, much of
the construction in Port-au-Prince
was done with poor materials, com
pounding the damage caused by the
earthquake.
"There has been a lot of growth
in Port-au-Prince in the past 10
years [a growth of] close to two

by the lack of seismic codes," she
added. If there are any seismic
codes, she later clarified, they were
certainly not enforced.
Even engineered structures like
hotels, office buildings and bridges
were not built for earthquakes,

according to Kiremidjian.
Geophysics Prof. Paul Segall also
attributed the major damage in
Haiti to poor construction.
"I read this morning that the
mayor of Port-au-Prince had said
many of the buildings just collapse
[even] without earthquakes shaking
that's just a recipe for disaster,"
Segall said.
Segall cautioned, however, that
even more damage could follow in
the days after the initial seismic
activity. In an earthquake of this
magnitude, he indicated that after
shocks are a cause for concern.
"You always have aftershocks
after these kinds of earthquakes," he
said. "As a general rule of the
thumb, the largest aftershocks are
about 1.5 times smaller than the
original earthquake so, in this
case, about a 5.0 [aftershock],
"But even with an aftershock of a
smaller magnitude, if the buildings
are already damaged, you don't
want to take a chance with being in
that building," he added.
While the Caribbean is not usual
ly considered a seismic danger zone,
earthquakes have struck in the area
in the past. Major seismic activity in
the region, however, is separated by
hundreds of years. With high levels
of poverty, a poor economy and a
particularly active hurricane season,
the Haitian government was more
concerned with being hit by a hurri
cane not an earthquake.

"It is uncertain how burial of
the dead can even happen."

The National Palace in Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince sits in shambles the day after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit the island-nation late Tuesday
afternoon, Jan. 13. Stanford professors in part attribute the overwhelming building damages to flaws in construction, calling structures in the capital
city "recipes for disaster," made up of poor materials not suited for earthquake stability. The quake was the most powerful in Haiti's history.

Victims of the earthquake in Haiti struggle to find aid and
regroup in the aftershock. It is estimated that the devastating
quake killed thousands and injured tens of thousand more.
Regardless, Kiremidjian believes
scientists should have anticipated an
earthquake before Tuesday's disas
ter struck.
"Seismologists should have been
worried about it, given that the
country is right at the border of the
Caribbean plate and the North
American plate," she said. "There
were no earthquakes for a long time
conditions were ripe for another
earthquake,"
Geographically, most of Haiti lies
on the Gonave microplate, a thin
slice of the earth's crust between the
North American plate to the north
and Caribbean plate to the south.
The fault, according to Segall, is very
similar in structure to the San
Andreas Fault along the Californian
coast.

"It's a strike-slip fault, which
means that the motion is horizon
tal," Segall explained. "And the
earthquake was reasonably shallow,
which means it is close to buildings
and causes a lot of damage,"
Drawing a local comparison,
