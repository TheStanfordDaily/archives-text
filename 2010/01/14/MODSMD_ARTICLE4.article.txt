A magnitude 7.0 earthquake
struck Haiti late Tuesday afternoon,
inflicting major physical damage
and causing what its ambassador to
the U.S. called a "catastrophe of
major proportions" for the Western
Hemisphere's poorest nation.
According to multiple sources,
Haitian leaders fear that tens of
thousands may have died in the
event and its aftermath.
Professors Dissect the Quake
Civil and environmental engi
neering Prof. Anne Kiremidjian said
several factors made the earthquake
devastating to the island nation and
its capital, Port-au-Prince,
"First, it was a [magnitude] 7.0
earthquake a major earthquake
which means there is strong shak
ing near the fault," Kiremidjian said.
"[This type of earthquake] causes 30
kilometers, maybe even 40 kilome
ters of fault to move relative to one
another, and the epicenter was
roughly 15 kilometers from Port-au-
Prince, which implies that the city
was subjected to very strong ground
vibrations."

To make matters worse, much of
the construction in Port-au-Prince
was done with poor materials, com
pounding the damage caused by the
earthquake.
"There has been a lot of growth
in Port-au-Prince in the past 10
years [a growth of] close to two

by the lack of seismic codes," she
added. If there are any seismic
codes, she later clarified, they were
certainly not enforced.
Even engineered structures like
hotels, office buildings and bridges
were not built for earthquakes,

according to Kiremidjian.
Geophysics Prof. Paul Segall also
attributed the major damage in
Haiti to poor construction.
"I read this morning that the
mayor of Port-au-Prince had said
many of the buildings just collapse
[even] without earthquakes shaking
that's just a recipe for disaster,"
Segall said.
Segall cautioned, however, that
even more damage could follow in
the days after the initial seismic
activity. In an earthquake of this
magnitude, he indicated that after
shocks are a cause for concern.
"You always have aftershocks
after these kinds of earthquakes," he
said. "As a general rule of the
thumb, the largest aftershocks are
about 1.5 times smaller than the
original earthquake so, in this
case, about a 5.0 [aftershock],
"But even with an aftershock of a
smaller magnitude, if the buildings
are already damaged, you don't
want to take a chance with being in
that building," he added.
While the Caribbean is not usual
ly considered a seismic danger zone,
earthquakes have struck in the area
in the past. Major seismic activity in
the region, however, is separated by
hundreds of years. With high levels
of poverty, a poor economy and a
particularly active hurricane season,
the Haitian government was more
concerned with being hit by a hurri
cane not an earthquake.

"It is uncertain how burial of
the dead can even happen."

The National Palace in Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince sits in shambles the day after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit the island-nation late Tuesday
afternoon, Jan. 13. Stanford professors in part attribute the overwhelming building damages to flaws in construction, calling structures in the capital
city "recipes for disaster," made up of poor materials not suited for earthquake stability. The quake was the most powerful in Haiti's history.

Victims of the earthquake in Haiti struggle to find aid and
regroup in the aftershock. It is estimated that the devastating
quake killed thousands and injured tens of thousand more.
