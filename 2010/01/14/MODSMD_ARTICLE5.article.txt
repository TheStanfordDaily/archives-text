## GSC discusses Special Fees, constitutional revision 
### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Potential constitutional revision
dominated Wednesday's GSC meet
ing, with a proposed bill to reduce spe
cial fees spending and talk of clarify
ing the ASSU staff confirmation
process with members still upset over
the rejection of Farah Abuzeid 'lO to
the position of co-chief of staff.
The meeting began with funding
requests from two student groups. The
GSC approved $250 for the Pakistanis
of Stanford and $4,221 for the
Stanford Africa Business Forum.

After approval of these requests, GSC
funding committee chair Ping Li
raised a concern about fund use.

According to Li, some student
groups may be lying about funding an
event for the well-being of the student
body when instead they are simply
buying food for their officers. Li pro
posed a transfer of $5OO from the food
account to the internal account. The
money would be used to hire an audi
tor to keep student groups in check.
"If we find they did anything to
abuse the funds, then they can't access
funds for the rest of that fiscal year,"
Li said.The pilot project will be imple

mented immediately and will be con
tinued in following years.
"We've been doing it by honor so
far," said Justin Brown, deputy chair
of the funding committee, "but people
have been screwing with the system."
In an attempt to curb special fees
spending, the GSC also discussed a
possible Special Fees bylaw change to
prevent groups from increasing their
budgets by ten percent without over
sight. The bill, entitled "A Bill to
Reduce Growth in Special Fees
Spending," was also discussed during
Tuesday's ASSU meeting.
Currently, student groups requiring

special fees get an automatic budget
increase of ten percent each year, plus
inflation.
"If you want to increase your spe
cial fees budget, then you have to do it
the way everyone else does it
which is to petition," Brown said.
According to co-chair Eric
Osborne, existence of the student
groups will not be affected, but their
funding may be decreased due to GSC
oversight.
"They shouldn't be able to add ten
percent willy-nilly to their budgets
every year," Osborne said.
School of Education representa
tive Eric Shed agreed with Osborne
on the special fees bill.
"This strikes me as a fair, practi
cal, and effective solution, and that
is an irregularity in legislature,"
Shed said. "I just want to acknowl
edge that."
Voting will be delayed until next
week in order for GSC members to
familiarize themselves with the pro
posal.
ASSU Announcements
Following the discussion on spe
cial fees reduction, undergraduate
outreach chairs Adrienne Pon 'l2
and Britt Kovachevich 'O9 were
unanimously confirmed as legisla
tive liaisons for the ASSU.
The next announcement was an
introduction to a new initiative that
aims to help student groups by
offering free technology consulting
services for maintaining their web
sites. Basic website techniques will
be taught at Old Union on Jan. 15

and Jan. 22 from 4 to 6 p.m.
Other ASSU announcements
included a salary/benefit negotia
tion workshop called "MAANuary:
MAAN Mustache Challenge" and
the "Hack-a-thon" for coders as an
alternative to the Dance Marathon.
The Mustache Challenge
involves Stanford men growing out
their facial hair and then accepting
bids to shave them, in order to raise
money to prevent violence against
Stanford women. The "Hack-a
thon" allows for students not keen
on dancing to still participate in the
marathon.
"If you have computer science or
software development skills, you
can code for 24 hours instead of
dancing for 24 hours," said ASSU
President David Gobaud 'OB M.S.
'lO.
Constitutional Policy Revisited
The confirmation of Abuzeid to
the co-chief of staff issue was revis
ited as Osborne asked Parker for an
update of the pending positions.
According to Parker, there will be
no case to clarify the issue. GSC
members were not satisfied with the
statement.
"We want to get this issue
cleared up," Osborne said.

The GSC debated the possibility
of claiming that harm is done by not
confirming Abuzeid. According to
parliamentarian Robert Hennessy,
harm needs to be done in order for
the GSC to bring the issue up to the
constitutional council.
"I can honestly say that the GSC
is harmed because Andy [Parker] is
overworked," Osborne said in refer
ence to Parker taking up both posi
tions of vice president and co-chief
of staff in the meantime.
"Arguably, every student at
Stanford can bring up a case," he
added, "because they are all affect
ed by Andy being overworked."
Members proposed the idea of
draft to clarify the voting procedure
regarding ASSU confirmations in
the bylaws.
According to Adam Beberg, doc
toral candidate in computer science
and former GSC member, the
Senate may be acting against their
constitutional power in attempting
to prevent Abuzeid from being con
firmed.

"It's a staff position, not [an]
employee," Beberg said. "It's not
something we should be voting on."
