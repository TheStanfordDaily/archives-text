## GSC discusses Special Fees, constitutional revision 
### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Potential constitutional revision
dominated Wednesday's GSC meet
ing, with a proposed bill to reduce spe
cial fees spending and talk of clarify
ing the ASSU staff confirmation
process with members still upset over
the rejection of Farah Abuzeid 'lO to
the position of co-chief of staff.
The meeting began with funding
requests from two student groups. The
GSC approved $250 for the Pakistanis
of Stanford and $4,221 for the
Stanford Africa Business Forum.

After approval of these requests, GSC
funding committee chair Ping Li
raised a concern about fund use.

According to Li, some student
groups may be lying about funding an
event for the well-being of the student
body when instead they are simply
buying food for their officers. Li pro
posed a transfer of $5OO from the food
account to the internal account. The
money would be used to hire an audi
tor to keep student groups in check.
"If we find they did anything to
abuse the funds, then they can't access
funds for the rest of that fiscal year,"
Li said.The pilot project will be imple

mented immediately and will be con
tinued in following years.
"We've been doing it by honor so
far," said Justin Brown, deputy chair
of the funding committee, "but people
have been screwing with the system."
In an attempt to curb special fees
spending, the GSC also discussed a
possible Special Fees bylaw change to
prevent groups from increasing their
budgets by ten percent without over
sight. The bill, entitled "A Bill to
Reduce Growth in Special Fees
Spending," was also discussed during
Tuesday's ASSU meeting.
Currently, student groups requiring

special fees get an automatic budget
increase of ten percent each year, plus
inflation.
"If you want to increase your spe
cial fees budget, then you have to do it
the way everyone else does it
which is to petition," Brown said.
According to co-chair Eric
Osborne, existence of the student
groups will not be affected, but their
funding may be decreased due to GSC
oversight.
"They shouldn't be able to add ten
percent willy-nilly to their budgets
