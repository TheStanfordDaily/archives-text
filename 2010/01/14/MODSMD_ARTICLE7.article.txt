## GREENPEACE OF MIND 
### CHARLIE MINTZ 
The end of the world looms large, but
Katrina Cook has a more pressing
concern. It's her first day on the job
canvassing for Greenpeace and if she
can't enlist three supporters in three
days she'll be fired. She stands between the
Claw fountain and the bookstore, clutching a
thick binder filled with donation forms to her
stomach, maintaining a steady stream of greet
ings and invitations as traffic flows past her.
"Got a minute for the environment?"
"Hey wanna talk about the environment?"
"Hi, how are you?"
If Katrina gets someone to stop, she explains
that she works for Greenpeace, though this will
be obvious from the logo on her shirt. If the
person stays long enough, she'll ask for his
money, specifically in the form of a monthly
contribution (minimum $l5). It's her first day
on the job, but Katrina has learned one thing
well already: bicyclists never stop. Pedestrians
are slower and therefore more susceptible, but
they have excuses too.
"I'm broke!"
"I'll come back later!"
"Sorry!"
Others simply ignore her.
Greenpeace was founded in 1971 and gained
notoriety for its anti-whaling and anti-nuclear
campaigns. Those issues still matter to the
organization, whose cohort of non-Stanford
affiliated canvassers stake out spots in White
Plaza, but Greenpeace's mission has since
broadened into what their Web site calls "a fight
to save the world." They now mainly lobby and
raise awareness about climate change and envi
ronmental degradation.
It's an expensive and hard fight last year
Greenpeace spent more than $26 million, four
million of that in fundraising but Katrina
and Greenpeace's other 300 canvassers nation
wide think it's a cause worth fighting for.
"Got a minute for the environment?" she
asks an older man in a leather jacket. He goes
over to her and listens with a polite expression
as she talks about the clearing of Indonesian
rainforests to make room for palm oil planta
tions. After about a minute he says he has to go
and leaves before Katrina can open her pledge
binder.
Another woman passes, dragging a rolling
suitcase noisily across the pavement.
"Hey, wanna talk about the environment?"
Katrina says to her. The woman says she
already donates and continues walking.
"Don't you love the environment?" Katrina
asks a group of three boys walking past.
"I love the environment," says one, sarcasti
cally, to his companions. Laughter.

More people pass. Bicyclists speed by.
Pedestrians give Katrina a wide berth. Those
who come near try to avoid eye contact, but
Katrina is insistent.
"Got a minute for the environment?" she
says to a girl in a plaid coat.
The girl shakes her head while mouthing
"no" and continues walking.

Josh Sigal, the
Greenpeace
team leader, is at

the bottom of the
stairs leading up to

the Stanford book
store. A girl in heels
tries to pass him on her
wav intn thp hnnlr«tr>rp

way into the bookstore.
"I need a minute," he says.
"Qnrru" cFico\?c and I/ - <=*/=» r"\ e mnr;inrr

Sorry, she says, and keeps moving.
"Why not?" he says, but she doesn't respond.
Josh is a seven-month veteran of the organ
ization. As team leader he coordinates goals
and outreach strategies with the other team
leaders from the San Jose office. He also goes
out to raise money, supervising and providing
tips and encouragement to novices like
Katrina, who, at 3 p.m., has yet to receive a sin
gle contribution. The ranks of Greenpeace
USA fail to swell.
"You're a superstar," Josh says, giving her a
high five.
Greenpeace claims more than three million

members worldwide and their donations pro
vide the bulk of the organization's income. In
2008, according to their annual report, support
ers donated more than $2O million, almost 80
percent of Greenpeace Inc.'s revenue. The
report doesn't say how many of those dollars
are monthly contributions pledged to street
canvassers like Katrina and how many are one

time donations. But street
canvassers must rack up sub
stantial donations because they

are a common, if somewhat unpopular sta

pie of many public places.
A girl in a Stanford sweatshirt walks quickly
away from Josh toward her friend. The pair
deems the canvassers "shady." A boy sitting
atop a concrete bench says he'd never donate
because he doesn't want to encourage a world
where canvassers harass you and ask for money.
Over by the fountain, one student remarks
to his companion that the canvassers are no
better than panhandlers. He feels "a special
resentment born of a poorly formed approach
to a subject close to [his] heart" toward the can
vassers. He understands climate change is dire,
but doesn't like strangers asking him to do
something about it.
"It's impersonal," he says. "You've gotta be
learning it from people you know."
Josh says that on an average day he will try
to stop three to four hundred people. Only a
tenth of those people will stop at all, and only

maybe a tenth of that number will end up
donating. On the best day of Josh's career, he
received nine donations. It is no exaggeration to
say that the predominant experience of can
vassing is flat-out rejection.
Josh tries to get the attention of a boy, but
the boy passes without responding or changing
his expression. Josh looks a little stunned.
"I see you," says Carissa, the third teammate,
slapping Josh a high-five,
Carissa is having a good day. She's gotten
four donations.
"It's the sweet spot," she says, describing her
location.
Carissa is about the same age as Katrina, but
she has four weeks of canvassing under her belt.
Sometimes, she says, she can see someone and
just know that they're going to give money. She
likes Greenpeace better than the last non-prof
it she worked for, Environment California.
"It feels like family here," she says. "I went to
Josh's house for Chanukah."
Later, the team is on break and Josh is
explaining the 20-foot rule. He stands and
points at a girl about 20 feet away.
"See her?" he asks. "I'm going to make eye
contact now so that when she passes she's
already looking at me." The girl passes, looking
at him.
Break ends. Carissa, Josh and Katrina return
to their spots. Katrina takes a sip of her coffee
and eyes the surroundings. A late-afternoon sun
warms the plaza. Traffic has diminished notably,
but a small stream of students flows past.
A girl carrying a Naked Juice with iPod ear
buds spilling out of her sweatshirt pocket bee
lines toward Katrina.
"Got a minute?" Katrina says.
"Actually, I do," says the girl.
"Check it out, we've got 3 million members
around the world, but we don't have enough
supporters in the U.S." says Katrina. "That's
why we need you."
The girl listens intently. Soon Katrina is
opening the thick, blue book, and making small
talk as the girl jots down her information and
her debit card number.
"Thanks for getting involved," Katrina says,
grabbing a sip of coffee.
Josh comes over to supervise. He presides
over the crayoning of the girl's debit card
through the carbon paper. He gives her a stick
er and a welcome packet.
"I'm so stoked I got one!" says Katrina, as
the girl walks away.
"First of many," says Josh.
"I feel rejuvenated," says Katrina.
"Just remember that feeling," says Josh.
"That feeling never gets old."
