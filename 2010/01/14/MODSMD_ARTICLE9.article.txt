# KINGS OF THE KITCHEN
## Dining hall workers hash it out with The Daily 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
At 5:15 on a Sunday afternoon, a
quarter of an hour into the dinner
service at Lakeside Dining, things
begin to stir. Greg Torres-Lopez
leisurely places a single burger
patty on the grill and a couple of potatoes
through the slicer. The dinner-time rush
won't hit for another fifteen minutes.
Average height and stocky, Torres-Lopez
appears to be well into his twenties, but in
truth he's just 18. He is a recent high school
graduate from East Palo Alto, taking a gap
year before pursuing a degree in mechanics
at the College of San Mateo next fall. Torres-
Lopez has been working the 5 to 9 p.m. din
ner shift at Stanford five days a week since his
sophomore year first in the dish room of
Ricker Dining and then settling as a hasher at
Lakeside five months later.
"This is my first time doing the grill," he
said with a bashful chuckle, pulling open steel
drawers under the counter to give the ingre
dients another once over. It must have been
the third time in the last half-hour.
Burgers: check beef, veggie and black
bean. Cheese: check.
Torres-Lopez has already assumed
responsibilities in what may have been the
honors track for hashing. The student manag
er, Jose, took him under his wing when

Torres-Lopez arrived at Lakeside from
Ricker Dining.
"He just started teaching me all the things
he does," Torres-Lopez said. "On Sundays,
they would just let me do it."
Within only two years of starting at
Lakeside, Torres-Lopez was promoted to
head hasher. He sometimes jokes about how
much easier being a head hasher is, as most of
his duties revolve around directing other
hashers and leading the service in the buffet
line.
"It's chill but you do have to check on the
workers and everything, make sure they're
doing their job and not horse-playing,"
Torres-Lopez laughed as he described some
of the privileges that come along with his new
title, between student orders of grilled chick
en and a cheeseburger.

Hashers are jacks-of-all-trade in the
Stanford kitchens, assisting in a variety of
tasks from food preparation to clean-up to
cold and hot runs to manning the cash regis
ter. They are usually non-University affiliated
workers employed by Stanford, many of
whom are still in college. But Stanford's cur
rent cohort of hashers is a relatively new
breed over 30 years ago, Stanford students
used to be served by their peers. In fact, many
prominent Stanford alums including Vice
Provost John Bravman, '79, MS 'Bl, PhD 'B5

used to call themselves hashers.
"There was a lot of camaraderie,"
Bravman said, reflecting on his interactions
with the students he used to serve. "I think
students appreciated that [the hashers] were
their peers."
Bravman worked as a cook's assistant in
Wilbur Dining for all four of his years as a
Stanford undergraduate. Working up to 15
hours a week on the dinner shift, Bravman
forged a strong friendship with his former
supervisor, Saul Cardenas. Even as Provost,
Bravman still made regular visits to see
Cardenas at Wilbur until the chef retired
almost five years ago.
Bravman's class became one of the last to
have Stanford students as hashers, but he
found hashing to be an unparalleled learning
experience.
"I felt responsible," he said. "I had a sense
that what I was doing was important even
though I was just feeding people. It helped
cement my notion that it really doesn't mat
ter what you're doing, you can really bring a
sense of quality to almost anything you do. If
it's worth doing, then it's probably worth
doing well."

Droves of students casually sauntered into
Lakeside, many of them eager to go through
the bread line as quickly as possible. All were
polite but few were openly friendly. Torres-

Lopez didn't seem to notice.
"I just say hi and be nice to them," he said
as he handed a tall student in a San Jose State
sweatshirt the double cheese burger he did
not order, completely oblivious to the slight
scowl on the boy's otherwise good-natured
face. "They do respond more often than not,
unless they're in a bad mood or something."
The conversations between hasher and
student are not always so cursory, however,
said Henry Jackson, a part time hasher at
Ricker Dining. Perhaps it's Ricker's removed
location or smaller dinner population, but
Jackson can list off the food preferences of
almost any given resident of Sterling Quad
when it comes to the grill menu. More often
than not, his interaction with students is only
limited by his current workload.
Jackson had been doing odd jobs for ware
houses before applying for the hasher posi
tion at Stanford in 2006. He was "tired of
going from job to job" and wanted to do
something that served others. He found his
calling.
"Customer service is important," Jackson
said. "[So,] if I'm not busy, I talk to students."
Like Torres-Lopez, Jackson has quickly risen
through the ranks, despite only having
worked at Stanford for three years. Now he
trains new employees.
"I've basically trained most of the people
that come through," he said. "[lt's] not really
challenging. Actually, to me it's kind of fun to

show them you know to make sure that the
job gets done because that's where I started.
It gives them aspiration."
Jackson's emphasis on helping others has
also extended beyond just his day job he
spends his free time volunteering at Palo
Alto's Opportunity Center, a nonprofit group
to serve the needs of the homeless.
"I know how it used to be," Jackson said
calmly. "I was homeless myself at one point."
It was only for two years â€”1996-1997
a time when Jackson was struggling with
bouts of substance abuse. He knows all too
well that being homeless is difficult and dan
gerous, so he does what he can to help others
in the same dilemma make changes in their
lives.

"[Whether] they need a change of clothes
or [help] down the right direction," Jackson
said, "it's just helping somebody."
Former hashers like Bravman appreciate
Jackson's and other hasher's commitment to
service both in and out of the dining halls.
"For the most part the staff [now] take
their jobs very seriously and they really like
serving students," Bravman said. "I think they
feel really privileged to be working here and
they derive a real sense of satisfaction from
serving their students well. I have really high
praise for them."
