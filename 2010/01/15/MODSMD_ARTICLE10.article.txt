## EDITORIAL Tea Party movement cannot be ignored 
### 
Early next month, Sarah Palin will be the
keynote speaker at a political conven
tion in Nashville, Tennessee. But rather
than addressing the Republican National
Committee or the mainstream Conservative
Political Action Conference, whose invitation
she rejected, Palin will be headlining the first
annual National Tea Party Convention.
The fact that this event even exists might
come as a surprise to many this disparate
group of zealous protesters is trying to form
an actual political party? Indeed, the conven
tion will pull together various Tea Party and
anti-government organizations from across
the country, giving them the opportunity to
network and coordinate future activities. With
the attendance of Palin and U.S. Reps.
Michele Bachmann and Marsha Blackburn,
the prospect of this loose-knit coalition of ul
traconservatives forging a single, structured
party seems increasingly plausible.
Moreover, the Tea Party movement has
shown broad appeal beyond the fringe of
right-wing extremism. While only 28 percent
and 35 percent of Americans have a positive
view of the Republican and Democratic Par
ties, respectively, 41 percent have a positive
view of the Tea Party movement. The support
does not seem constrained by geography ei
ther, with ordinarily moderate states such as
Maryland and Florida becoming hotbeds of
Tea Party action. In fact, a growing number of
Floridians have turned against Senate candi
date and popular moderate Republican Gov
ernor Charlie Crist in favor of a new conser
vative named Marco Rubio the first po
tential Tea Party senator? Even with the well
documented malcontent over the future of
America, only recently has the possibility of
going in an entirely new direction become so
real.
Naturally, liberals and moderate conserva

tives have scorned this rise. These sentiments
are entirely reasonable given the rancorous
hatred Tea Party protestors have engaged in;
they have called the president everything
from a communist to a Nazi to a terrorist, held
posters of him as a caricatured African witch
doctor and thrown around the n-word with no
heed. There is no doubt that some, even many,
of their members openly wish harm upon
members of the federal government and any
one who supports them. Some are unabashed
ly racist and filled to the brim with hate.
Yet, 41 percent of Americans have a posi
tive view of these people. And while much of
this might be attributable to many voters' hav
ing only a passing knowledge of the Tea
Party's actual nature, that is certainly enough
support to garner attention.
The Editorial Board cautions against sim
ply dismissing the Tea Party as a benign assort
ment of backwoods bigots; reactionary pop
ulism of this kind must be observed with cau
tion and alertness.
How best to confront the issue of these Tea
Partiers remains an open question. Perhaps
largely ignoring their presence on the nation
al stage will be successful in allowing the en
thusiasm to fade. Maybe they can be subdued
by, as the Board has suggested before, engag
ing the moderate right in real bipartisan
progress that will give some conservatives a
better venue for their beliefs. Any course of
action has its benefits and its flaws. But what
we absolutely must not do is give this move
ment what it wants. We, the Stanford popula
tion, are the highly educated, largely liberal
elite that these people love so much to revile.
By scoffing at the Tea Party or disparaging its
members, we play into the caricature they
have created for us and fuel their fire of anger
which, at the moment, represents their only
real foundation.
