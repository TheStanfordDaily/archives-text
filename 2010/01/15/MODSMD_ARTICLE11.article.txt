At the Stanford-in-Washington (SIW)
Fall 2009 reunion this week, we dis
cussed the concerns toward our rein
tegration into life at the Farm. Similar to our
classmates who study abroad, we return to
campus from a quarter in D.C. experiencing
"reverse cultural shock."
Practical and tangible challenges domi
nated the conversation: feeling isolated liv
ing in non-traditional settings like Oak
Creek and Escondido Village (a mom yester
day chided me for endangering the lives of
small children by forgetting to close a gate in
EV), having to adjust to the rigorous stan
dard of classes at Stanford, dealing with the
onslaught of summer internships recruit
ment and facing the imminent entry into the
real world upon graduation. People missed
the SIW house, the clear delineation of the
day between eight hours of work and
evening classes (unfortunately, there is now
more potential for time mismanagement),
the physical convenience of living in a city
and uhmmm ... the brunches (yes, SIW has
an amazing chef).
The overwhelming attitude toward these
challenges was that they can and should be
conquered easily, with the passing of time.
The focus is on surmounting, rather than un
derstanding such issues. There is nothing like
spending time in the nation's capitol that
forces you to be a pragmatist. While some of
my peers felt "old and disillusioned," and
commented on the disconcerting insularity,
what seemed to be missing from the conver
sation was a broader discourse about the un
derlying sources of our displacement. Per
haps struggling more than in this process
than others, I am desperate to theorize and
seek answers.
As someone who has been on campus
continuously for the past two years, the last
four months was the first time that I left "the
bubble" and lived in an actual American city.
For those of us whose being was inherently
connected to the movement and rhythm of
this place, we deal with the strange paradox
of Stanford after some time away con
fronting a place that remains the same yet
changes rapidly. The world that was my Stan
ford has become radically different. June
2009 Stanford is not the same as January 2010
Stanford.
Sure, things have stayed constant. As I
stroll (okay fine, more like madly dash)
around campus, there is comfort in the famil
iar sights and patterns. The frightening thing
was realizing that Stanford goes on without
you. It raises the questions: Do we matter?

Do our four years here on the Farm make a
difference in the long run?
In an uncharacteristic moment of fatal
ism, our dear columns editor Zachary Warma
published a column on Monday that offered
a disheartening conclusion: we are not so
special. I disagree. A sense of cyclical repeti
tion of experiences and norms certainly gov
ern our time at Stanford. But, we are unique
and make distinct contributions to our envi
ronments. Individuals matter. Individuals
make history.
While it is difficult and almost impossible
for us to directly measure and quantify each
of our impact on the campus community,
our mere presence affects others and in
evitably this University. Indeed, the tough
readjustment some of us are encountering
can be attributed to the change in people.
Undoubtedly, the graduation of last year's
class witnessed the departure of some of my
closest friends and intellectual and political
mentors.
As a result, this place feels different.
Whether it is dropping by The Daily office
last week or sitting in ASSU meetings, the
dynamics and atmosphere seem drastically
altered. It is the personalities that define
campus institutions and culture. Ideas and
ideologies are important. However, with
out people pushing them forward and driv
ing implementation, they would be insignif
icant.
The behavior of institutions at Stanford
springs from the behavior of individual ac
tors their idiosyncrasies, ambitions, abili
ties and foibles. Individuals define the inten
tion of the organization, formulate its priori
ties and devise its strategies. There is no such
thing as inevitability. Individuals are the ones
that make decisions. More importantly, our
predecessors have laid the foundation for all
of us â€”just as we will be laying the frame
work for future generations of Stanford stu
dents.

Individuals matter only when contemplation is
accompanied by action. Contact Shelley at
