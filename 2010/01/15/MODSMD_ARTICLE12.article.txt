## History lives in San Diego 
### P.G. Mann 
Oh, prosaic San Diego! Sing me your se
crets. A French-fried potato stuffed in a
burrito? A kidnapped Tijuana club
owner stashed in a safe house? A syphilis sore
blossoming in a sailor's breeches? A thousand
historians holed up in a Hyatt? What other sor
did surprises do you keep in your canyons
shadowed from the bleach of the blistering
sun?
Destiny found me in our southern city of St.
James last weekend. I had been invited to give
a paper at the annual meeting of American his
torians: "Rethinking Fingernail Hygiene in
Late Victorian Wales, 1891-1895: A Transna
tional Perspective." Going into the conference,
I had worried that my topic was too broad.
After all, pre-1891 Welsh fingernail hygiene
was a world apart from the 1895 scene. It's
nearly impossible to account for all the trans
formations wrought by the great Belgian cuti
cologist Emil Rjinsdorf and his introduction of
the scrub brush into the mining culture of
blackened Welshmen.
But my fears of trying to cover too much
ground were soon assuaged by a look at the list
of the other conference panels. I knew I would
have no difficulty discussing the broad currents
of fin-de-siecle filth and the emerging global
perspective on cuticology with my interlocu
tors in Radio and Gender Performance in
Postwar France or Quilting in Third Genera
tion Filipino-American Families.
The conference began wonderfully. Under
the yellow morning glow of the ballroom chan
deliers, we plied our trade, broke new concep
tual ground and changed our understanding of
human behavior with the three to four people
who were willing to listen to us. At least two of
those people had come thinking there would
be free coffee.
Sadly, the free coffee years were over. Like
many of the humanities disciplines, history has
fallen on hard job times. Granted, you would
never know this from the steady stream of ef
fluvia coming out of the historical discipline.
But there were subtle hints of underlying
slump. The Career Resource Desk in Annex D
of the Hyatt had a "back in five minutes" sign
posted on the table for the entire weekend.The
buffet spread for "Young Scholars" consisted
of raw broccoli, steamed peas, sunflower seeds
and a giant punch bowl of ranch dressing. And

I'm pretty sure I saw a scholar of early modern
Poland picking cigarette butts off the parking
lot.
Of course, that didn't stop us from enjoying
ourselves. In between presentations, we histo
rians undipped our ties and frolicked in the
San Diego sun. The terrace came alive with ill
fitting suits poring over footnotes by the pool
and heated discussions in the sauna about the
battle of the Bulge.
Then, things got real.
A group of masked men with guns burst
into the Hyatt. They barricaded the exits, cor
ralled us into the grand ballroom, and bound
our hands and feet with duct tape. They told us
we were being held for ransom. Apparently,
the Mexican drug cartels had also fallen on
hard economic times. To compensate, not only
were they diversifying their job skills with in
creasing forays into kidnapping; in conducting
business across the border, they, too, were
adopting a transnational perspective.
Unfortunately, their plans for profit were
misguided. When the university deans re
ceived the call announcing that all their histo

rians had been kidnapped, their eyes lit up. A
whole departmental budget would be free to
pump into a new ergonomic finger gym for the
School of Engineering. Suddenly, a new solu
tion to the universities' budget crisis had ap
peared on the horizon.
When our kidnappers started filling car
tires with gasoline, we knew we had to get out
of this situation on our own. The time had
come to bring our historical knowledge to bear
on the present.
A young woman crawled to the podium.
"The first thing we have to do is sufficiently
theorize our methodology."
"We need to adopt a global perspective!"
someone shouted.
"But one that is still attuned to the nuances
of gender construction!" yelled another.
"Let's be serious. We can't move forward
until we rethink the boundaries of kidnapper
kidnappee and the inter-subjective process of
identity formation."
"I'd like to remind everyone that digital
media technology could serve as an excellent
pedagogical tool."
The crowd murmured its assent, albeit re
luctantly.
Thirteen hours later, we had struck on a
plan. We would survey the historiography of
slave revolts, prisoner riots and hostage resist
ance from a transnational perspective, but with
attention to the specific cultural dimensions of
local institutions and practices. This would in
dicate a direction for future work on emanci
pation. Meanwhile, we would deliver a series of
PowerPoint-supplemented lectures aimed at
making our captors aware of the normative
discourse of masculinity and the legacy of
Spanish colonial oppression they were acting
out in their transgressive roles.
But when we went to give our first lecture,
we came upon the kidnappers at the "Young
Scholars" buffet, sprawled out dead on the
floor. The empty punch bowl of rancid three
day-old ranch dressing told the tale.
Once again, the unexamined past had
brought the present to its knees.
