## President Obama vs. Dr.King 
### 
Then President Obama gave his Nobel
W/ acceptance speech in December, he
Y Y made reference to Dr. King saying
that he was there in Oslo as a "direct conse
quence of Dr. King's life work," and as a "tes
timony to the moral force of non-violence."
And yet, the President also spent much of his
speech distancing himself from the legacy of
non-violence, explaining how we live in a dan
gerous world full of evil and that as a head of
state, he cannot be guided only by the exem
plars of non-violence. So, it would seem appro
priate as we approach the Martin Luther
King, Jr. holiday, to explore the gulf between
the President as a head of state and the legacy
of Dr. King.
President Obama's Nobel acceptance
speech was widely praised by both liberals and
conservatives. Conservative columnist David
Brooks of The New York Times referred to it as
"Obama's Christian Realism." In fact, the
President was very clear saying, "I face the
world as it is, and cannot stand idle in the face
of threats to the American people. For make
no mistake: Evil does exist in the world. A non
violent movement could not have halted
Hitler's armies. Negotiations cannot convince
al Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms."
The President's reasoning seems not only
sound but, dare I say it, realistic. On the other
hand, the President, without being explicit,
suggests that King's non-violence is idealistic
and somehow inapplicable in the real world.
None of this non-violent idealism for him, as if
the threats and violence faced by the Civil
Rights movement were in some way less real
than the threats of today.
Moreover, the President seems to project

onto the history of the Civil Rights movement
a certainty of the effectiveness of non-violence
that did not exist at the time. It was not at all
certain that non-violence could be efficacious
against the racism in our society. King was
often mocked and criticized by more militant
elements. Let's be clear: the violence experi
enced by blacks was nothing short of terrorism
enabled and supported by individuals and in
stitutions throughout our society. This wasn't
the flash-in-the-pan violence that had been ex
perienced for months, years or even decades; it
was the systemic and intractable violence of
centuries with millions of victims.
Malcolm X called King a "chump" and said
that it was "criminal" to teach non-violence in
the face of violence by whites. Malcolm's criti
cism sounds intuitively obvious and, dare I say
it, realistic. There was a clear evil in the world
and Malcolm said it had to be confronted with
force. It would seem that the President has
more in common with Malcolm's realism than
with King's non-violence. Is al Qaeda more in
tractable than centuries of slavery and racism?
Is the President unaware of the effective use of
non-violence during WWII? Why, then, the
presumption that non-violence could not be
effective in certain circumstances?
Part of the reason for the discrepancy be
tween the President and Dr. King is that nation
states really aren't interested in community or
brotherhood or even peace, as much as they
may use these words. Nation states and their
leaders are interested in acquiring and main
taining their own power and place in the world.
President Obama, as difficult as it is for some of
us to admit it, is sitting astride the greatest mil
itary machine the world has ever known.

Another reason for the President parting
ways with King is that non-violence is more
like a spiritual discipline than it is a political
platform or foreign policy. Non-violence re
quires extreme personal moral courage and in
trospection that are not easily translated into
policies. But this does not mean that military
intervention is the only or appropriate alterna
tive.
King's words echo through time as both a
warning and an opportunity nowhere more
powerfully than in his last book, "Where do we
go from here: Chaos or Community?" "The ul
timate weakness of violence is that it is a de
scending spiral, begetting the very thing it
seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it
multiplies it. Through violence you may mur
der the liar, but you cannot murder the lie nor
establish the truth. Through violence, you may
murder the hater, but you cannot murder the
hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. So
it goes. Returning violence for violence multi
plies violence adding deeper darkness to a
night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot
drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate
cannot drive out hate, only love can do that."
The genius of Dr. King's ethic of non-vio
lence is that it is counter intuitive. Non-vio
lence throws us off balance and because it isn't
"realistic," we don't expect it. King was a mas
ter of spiritual jujitsu, using the violence of his
adversary to disable him. Dr. King has passed
on his legacy of non-violence to us and we must
decide what to do with it. Non-violence is hard
work. Let's get started.
