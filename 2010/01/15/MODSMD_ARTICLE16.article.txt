' Tt's that time of year again. Bust out the voting ballots and bottles of Andre. Roll out that red carpet, folks, because awards season is upon us. Starting off
I strong this weekend with the Golden Globes, major networks will be airing the epic-length ceremonies left and right, while we (well, maybe just me) wait
bated breath for the granddaddy of them all the Academy Awards. Who will go home with the trophies? Will it be James Cameron and that low
budget flick of his? Will "Up!" be considered worthy of a 'Best Picture' nom instead of just 'Best Animated?' Will Meryl Streep win for the gazillionth time?
t We will get all of these answers soon and you can bet that Intermission will be keeping its readers up to date. We're starting off this awards season with the
I critical shows to tune in to.

. The Razzies

Some people couldn't care less about what is generally considered 'good film-making.' Usually, there isn't that much to discuss and people agree that a
film is particularly powerful, well acted or well made. If you are one of those people who can't think of anything more dull than the Oscars, consider the
A Razzies. This ceremony is generally held the day before the Oscars and it awards the worst of the year's cinema. Expect a strong showing from "Alvin and the
; Chipmunks: The Squeakquel" and "Bride Wars."

« —-

We know that this one is about music, not movies, but you can't really discuss awards season without throwing in "music's biggest night." Some people

prefer this awards show to the Oscars because it is peppered with musical acts performing popular songs from throughout the year. Also unlike the
Oscars, the nominees aren't usually obscure and instead, each award will seem relevant and at least moderately interesting. We anticipate it to be a
general rotation between Lady Gaga, Beyonce and Taylor Swift. Darn that country cutie!

3 „_

This is it the one that really matters, the one that can make or break careers. Fashion, speeches and dates are all scrutinized
hours before the actual ceremony. The coveted gold statue is handed out to (arguably) the industry's best and we can almost
always expect a little bit of drama. It comes much later than usual this year (in March) and the nominees have yet to be released,
but the audience can either expect a barrel of laughs from hosts Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin, or references to "It's
Complicated." Don't forget that Intermission said it first: Meryl Streep will win. AGAIN.
