# Avenue Q and A

For many of us, the idea of life after col
lege is really scary. Some might be
excited to be launched out in the real
world, finally gaining some ground on that
career that they have been dreaming of for
years, but for most, we wish would could stay
at Stanford for the rest of our lives. In
"Avenue Q," one of the most popular musi
cals of the decade, the lead character
Princeton deals with this issue head on.
This parody of "Sesame Street" deals
with the aforementioned recent college grad,
his assimilation into the real world and his
journey to find his "purpose." Along the way
he meets Kate Monster, a girl who has always
wanted to open up a special monster school,
Nicky and Rod (a Bert and Emie-like duo that
deal with homosexuality), Gary Coleman and
a Cookie Monster that uses the Internet exclu
sively for porn and never leaves his apart
ment.
Sound pretty mature for puppets?
That's because it is. Intended for mature audi
ences only, "Avenue Q" is chock-full of inap
propriate, crude and raunchy dialogue, not to
mention a sex scene. That's right full pup
pet nudity. The Bad Idea Bears, who happen
to look exactly like Care Bears, plant ideas in
Princeton's head like drinking games, one
night stands and hanging himself. Songs like
"Everyone's a Little Bit Racist" and "You
Can Be As Loud as the Hell You Want When
You're Making Love" will make you laugh
until you cry.
However, this show doesn't stand
alone on lewd dialogue and inappropriate
musical numbers. The technical aspects are
something to be marveled at as well. Giant
televisions descend to show "Sesame Street"-
like vignettes, dealing with subjects like one
night stands and schadenfreude (feeling hap
piness at the expense of somebody else's
pain). The actors are puppet masters, manag
ing to convey emotion through both their
actual bodies and the puppets'. It became a
conundrum when deciding whom to watch.
While "Avenue Q's" run in San Jose
seems far too short, expect this relatable and

hilarious musical to stick around for quite
some time. Through all of the smut and exple
tives, it teaches us a message things may
be bad at the moment, but everything in life is
only for now.

Few musicals ever address themes like
education, pornography, racism and homosex
uality. Even fewer shows address these
themes with an ensemble of puppets. "Avenue
Q," the Broadway show that has swept the

nation, is coming to San Jose for a limited
engagement from Jan. 12 to Jan. 17.
Intermission got to sit down with Princeton,
the star puppet of the show ask him what life
after college is really like.
Intermission(i): Is college really the happiest
time of our lives? Is there nothing else to look
forward to?
Princeton (P): College was a BLAST, it's
true. And since I graduated, life definitely has
[had] its share of ups and downs. But, some
thing good is coming, I can feel it. You never
know what'll happen next!
i: What advice would you give to those who
actually are getting their B.A.s in English?
P: Make sure the companies you work for
aren't laying employees off before their first
day. That was rough.
i: Stanford is located in the heart of the
Silicon Valley, where the Internet is being fur
ther developed every day. Is the Internet real
ly just for porn?
P: Well, my neighbor, Trekkie Monster,
seems to think so. And, for me, I'd be lying if
I said it wasn't PART of my Internet experi
ence. But, I use it for other things too ... I
swear. . .
i: You've had your share of relationship prob
lems. Do you have any love advice to give?
P: Honestly, I'm the last person to ask about
love advice! No matter what I do, it seems
like I'm always screwing up! I'm getting bet
ter, though... I think.
