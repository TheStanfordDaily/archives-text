This week's food review
was written on a patio
shaded by palm trees,
overlooking an emerald lawn
as the authors poured cups of
Earl Gray tea from an earth
enware teapot and nibbled on
lemon-meringue tartlets.
While this description might
make it sound like we
escaped to a ritzy seaside
resort in some former British
colony, we were in fact on the
Stanford campus . . .and paid
for our afternoon tea using
Cardinal Dollars. We wrestled
with whether or not to reveal
the location of this hidden
gem one of this place's
main draws is its relative
obscurity. But committed as
we are to educating Stanford
students about the 94305's
culinary bounty, duty bound
us to share the goodness that
is Russo Cafe.
Opened just two
months ago, Russo Cafe is
the latest phase in the devel
opment of the Munger gradu
ate housing complex.
Because the cafe caters main
ly to graduate students, the
menu and setting are notice
ably more sophisticated than,
say, The Axe and Palm.
Russo Cafe is in fact so good
that we would endorse it even
if it weren't conveniently
located right next to Stern,
the Lower Row and the Law

School Library. In fact, we
would frequent Russo Cafe
even if it required us to pay
in "real money." And yet it is
on campus and it does let us

spend those limited-use
Cardinal Dollars.
Both to prepare for
this review and out of sheer
hedonism, we've been to the

cafe at Munger an absurd
amount recently. Still, the
menu has yet to disappoint.
Russo offers an insane num
ber of options, made with

fresh and usually organic
ingredients. We've yet to see
Russo repeat one of their cre
ative daily specials, but in the
past we've enjoyed shrimp

scampi, beef and gnocchi
stew (perfect on a cold
January afternoon) and pas
try-wrapped salmon. For
$6.95 (in Cardinal Dollars!),

a main entree comes with a
choice of two sides, which on
a recent visit included
mashed potatoes, amazing
grilled asparagus and fried

risotto balls. We also recom
mend items off the perennial
ly available menu, especially
the macaroni and cheese (it's
obscenely rich), Russo burger

and spinach ravioli.
The cafe also has a
salad bar and a wood-burning
oven for freshly made pizza.
While we've yet to try the

salad bar, the pizzas are really
yummy the chicken pesto
is great, although the types

available change from day to
day. There are even a limited
number of made-to-order deli

sandwich options that look
really, really good.
But perhaps our
favorite part of Russo Cafe is
the dessert area. A glass dis-

play case shows off a con
stantly rotating assortment of

sweets, ranging from cheese
cakes to eclairs. When the
weather is nice, ask for a

slice of the strawberry short
cake and a pot of tea (served
with a porcelain cup and a
small saucer who knew
Cardinal Dollars could be so
classy?) to enjoy out on the
patio. If you can ignore the
loud construction going on
next door at the Law School,
the experience feels blissful.
