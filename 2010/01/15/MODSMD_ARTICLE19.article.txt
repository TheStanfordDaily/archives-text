# Michael Cera does it again

For his most recent
work, "Youth in
Revolt," Michael Cera
sticks to what he knows best
and presents the similar, out
cast, hormonal teen that we
have seen so many times
before. I don't know how
much longer Cera will be
able to act the same in every
movie and still be popular,
but for now, it works.
Based on the wildly
popular book by C.D. Payne,
this story follows the young
Nick Twisp (Cera) as he
employs any means to be
reunited with the love of his
live/weeklong fling, Sheeni
Saunders (Portia Doubleday).
Nick eventually realizes that

he will have to be ruthless to
get want he wants, so he cre
ates an alternate, chain-smok
ing and utterly French ego,
Francois, to handle these
often-nefarious endeavors.
For the plot being so
incredibly outlandish, the
movie did well to provide a
realistic portrayal. It was
believable that this young,
unsure character would fall in
love with a girl so easily and
then decide to do such crazy
things (think burning down
the town of Berkeley) to
return to her. And even if
there are some things that do
not make perfect sense or
seem improbable, the movie
is clearly lighthearted and

fun, and certainly not to be
taken seriously.
The beginning of the
movie establishes Nick as
very solitary. With a mom
who has a different boyfriend
every week (one being a hys
terical cameo by Zach
Galiafinakis) and a dad who
is dating a much younger
woman, and neither parent is
particularly secretive about
the amount of sex he or she is
having, it makes sense for
Nick to be vigorously search
ing for a partner. He becomes
obsessed with the first girl
that gives him any attention
Sheeni.
A major flaw with the
movie revolves around

Sheeni's character. I'm
unsure if Sheeni was sup
posed to be odd or if
Doubleday needs to practice
her acting, but Sheeni was
especially strange. It was
understandable for Nick to
fall for Sheeni, but I could
not figure out why Sheeni
would fall for Nick. Sheeni is
relatively attractive, has a
seemingly perfect boyfriend
before she meets the socially
crippled Nick and is sent
away to her dream school, yet
still wants a relationship with
Nick as much as Nick wants
a relationship with her. There
are certain aspects about
Sheeni that would explain
why she would be attracted to
Nick; however, I think cast
ing an attractive actress to

play the part muddles the
effect she is supposed to con
vey to the audience. Is she
hot or is she not? I don't
know.
As per usual, Cera is
really funny and especially
awkward, which is enjoyable
and entertaining. I'm just
curious as to how many times
I can watch the same charac
ter and still be interested. I've
seen it in "Arrested
Development," "Superbad"
and "Juno," but at least then
it had some novelty. By the
time "Nick and Norah's
Infinite Playlist" rolled
around, I was sick of it.
Granted, this movie is better
and has more substance than
"Nick and Norah," but why
do I keep going to his movies

to see the same thing? The
bottom line is that a character
who is blundering, unintimi
dating and looking for some
action is relatable. Even if
one is the most social of but
terflies, we all know what
that feels like.
