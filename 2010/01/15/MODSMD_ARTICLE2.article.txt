Rice not to be confused with
political science Prof. Condoleezza
Rice received her bachelor's de
gree in history from Stanford in
1986 and has since served in multi
ple capacities under Presidents
Clinton and Obama. She will join

will give the Class Day lecture, and

In a statement, Stanford Presi

goals to those of the University: "to
tackle the most pressing global
challenges, including addressing
climate change and combating
poverty, disease and violence to
promote peace."
Rice was unanimously con

January 2009 after being nominat

she served as a senior adviser for
national security affairs. From 1997

ident Clinton as well as Senior Di

As Assistant Secretary of State,
Rice engineered U.S. policy for 48

while overseeing 43 American em
bassies. In 2000, she was the co-re
cipient of the White House's
Samuel Nelson Drew Memorial
Award for distinguished contribu
tions to the formation of peaceful,
cooperative relationships between
states.
While at Stanford, Rice studied
history and was a Truman scholar,
graduating with Phi Beta Kappa
honors. She then went on to earn
master's and Ph.D. degrees in In
ternational Relations from Oxford
University, where she was a
Rhodes Scholar.
"We are thrilled that Ambas
sador Rice will return to Stanford
to share her perspective on some of
the greatest challenges facing the
world," said the senior class presi
dents in a joint statement. "She is in
a position of international leader
ship with a record of service pro
moting peace and humanity."
To select a commencement
speaker, the senior class presidents
poll their classmates for potential
candidates, before bringing those
names to the president and provost
of the University. The Office of the
President has said in the past that
speakers should have some con
nection to Stanford and should be
"interesting and dynamic" commu
nicators.

CONSERVATION CUP: During lunchtime on Thursday, Stanford's Green Living Council (GLC) kicked off its quarter-long Conservation
Cup with the help of music groups Nimbleweed, the Mendicants and Stanford Calypso. Throughout the quarter, the GLC will hold bi-weekly challenges
for dorms and houses on campus, aimed at cutting water and energy consumption. "We're hoping to do projects in houses during the quarter
so people will still be conscious of it and not just forget it after the first week," said Coordinator Shira Stites '10. At the end of the quarter,
Conservation Cup planners will use hard data from housing utility bills to determine the effectiveness of each residence at living sustainably.

CONSERVATION CUP: During lunchtime on Thursday, Stanford's Green Living Council (GLC) kicked off its quarter-long Conservation
Cup with the help of music groups Nimbleweed, the Mendicants and Stanford Calypso. Throughout the quarter, the GLC will hold bi-weekly challenges
for dorms and houses on campus, aimed at cutting water and energy consumption. "We're hoping to do projects in houses during the quarter
so people will still be conscious of it and not just forget it after the first week," said Coordinator Shira Stites '10. At the end of the quarter,
Conservation Cup planners will use hard data from housing utility bills to determine the effectiveness of each residence at living sustainably.
