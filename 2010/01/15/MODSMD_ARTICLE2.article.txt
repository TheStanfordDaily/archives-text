1986 and has since served in multi

philosophy Prof. Debra Satz, who
will give the Class Day lecture, and

faith advisory council, who will give
the Baccalaureate address. The
119 th Commencement Weekend is
scheduled to begin Friday, June 11.
In a statement, Stanford Presi
dent John Hennessy likened Rice's
goals to those of the University: "to
tackle the most pressing global
challenges, including addressing
climate change and combating
poverty, disease and violence to
promote peace."
Rice was unanimously con
firmed as ambassador to the U.N. in
January 2009 after being nominat
ed by Obama, for whose campaign
she served as a senior adviser for
national security affairs. From 1997
to 2001, she was the U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for African Af
fairs, and from 1995 to 1997, she
served as Special Assistant to Pres
ident Clinton as well as Senior Di
rector for African Affairs on the
National Security Council.

As Assistant Secretary of State,
Rice engineered U.S. policy for 48
countries of Sub-Saharan Africa
while overseeing 43 American em
bassies. In 2000, she was the co-re
cipient of the White House's
Samuel Nelson Drew Memorial
Award for distinguished contribu
tions to the formation of peaceful,
cooperative relationships between
states.
While at Stanford, Rice studied
history and was a Truman scholar,
graduating with Phi Beta Kappa
honors. She then went on to earn
master's and Ph.D. degrees in In
ternational Relations from Oxford
University, where she was a
Rhodes Scholar.
"We are thrilled that Ambas
sador Rice will return to Stanford
to share her perspective on some of
the greatest challenges facing the
world," said the senior class presi
dents in a joint statement. "She is in
a position of international leader
ship with a record of service pro
moting peace and humanity."
To select a commencement
speaker, the senior class presidents
poll their classmates for potential
candidates, before bringing those
names to the president and provost
of the University. The Office of the
President has said in the past that
speakers should have some con
nection to Stanford and should be
"interesting and dynamic" commu
nicators.
