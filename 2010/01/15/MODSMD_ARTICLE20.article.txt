Few people can ever say that they have been nominated for an Oscar, starred in multiple
blockbusters and critically acclaimed films and have worked with the industry's most
widely respected directors. Even fewer people can say that when they are under the age
of 16. Starring in the upcoming film adaptation of Alice Sebold's best-selling novel, "The
Lovely Bones," (directed by the legendary Peter Jackson) is Saoirse Ronan, who has one of the
most impressive resumes people could ever hope for in a lifetime, let alone in little under a
decade. Intermission got to listen in as Ronan discussed her upcoming film and what bringing
this powerful story to the big screen was like.

Queens College: How have your roles in "Atonement" and "The Lovely Bones" influenced
your outlook on life?
Saoirse Ronan (SR): With "Atonement," it wasn't that influential because it, you know, it was
a bitter girl who's very in on herself. I mean, I suppose that it would make you think more
before you speak if anything, but "The Lovely Bones" in particular, just made me appreciate
what I have. You know, that I'm lucky to be here, I'm lucky to have the amazing family that I
have. It's also made me more aware of things that go on in the world, these awful crimes that
are committed every day. So, yeah, so it's boosted my awareness.
University of Michigan: So, Susie Salmon's character, she's had a very serious, traumatic
experience. Did you find this role challenging and how did you prepare for a role that dealt
with such heavy issues?
SR: Yeah, it was challenging, it as you said it's a very serious subject matter and it was
always going to be a challenge for me because I hadn't done anything quite that deep before.
But, it's also very light and, you know, it's full of hope and so in that way, it was easy. But,
when we dealt with very, you know, emotional scenes, intense scenes, there would be a lot of

discussion between me and Pete and Fran and Philippa, who are the writers, as well. So, yeah,
we just talked a lot about it and just made sure that we were going in the same direction and
we were on the same page.
Northern Arizona University: What should viewers learn and take away from this film?
SR: Well, I think that the message of this movie, although it may not seem like it to people
who haven't seen it yet, is ultimately hope and how you get there. You know, when Susie
arrives in the in-between, she doesn't want to go forward, which would mean accepting her
death. She wants to be back on Earth with her family and she knows she can't do that. And to
get there, you know, it's about her love for her family and not the hate and vengeance that she
has for her murder. So, yeah, so it's hope for sure.
Northwestern: You're already such a successful actress at such a young age, so did working
on this film with some of the other more experienced actors help you kind of carry away some
thing in regards to your acting skills that you can use maybe in your future films and your
future works of art?
SR: I think it's just the way they are on set. I mean, I've worked with a lot of actors that just
have a really good approach with to working with other people to being with other people
every day and you need that when you're working on a movie. You become a family unit, so
it's very important to get on with everyone.
