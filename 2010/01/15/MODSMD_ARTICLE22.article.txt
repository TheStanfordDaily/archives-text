## A 						boring time for sports 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
I have nothing to write about this
week because nothing has inter
ested me in the sports world out
side of Stanford lately. My col
leagues cover enough over the week,
leaving me the tough job of originali
ty. Well, most Stanford winter sports
are just gearing up. Lane Kiffin sucks
and will probably bring more viola
tions to USC. Pete Carroll isn't worth
writing about. The NBA is boring.
There haven't been enough upsets in
college basketball yet.The NFL is rea
sonably exciting, but let's come back
next week when the Super Bowl spots
are on the line. Mark McGwire cheat
ed, but like we were really surprised
when we heard that.
Thus, this column is about nothing.
It is about the boring, banal, whatever
and who cares of sports. It is the things
you wish you didn't know about, the
things you don't understand why you
know so much about, or the things
you wish just didn't exist. It is Brett
Favre, Olympic race-walking and fish
ing. It's golf without Tiger Woods, the
NBA regular season and the Pro
Bowl. It's the things that have you
going "why?" or "huh?" or screaming
an obscenity at the television.
This column is the things about
sports that make me want to turn off
the TV or put down the newspaper.
The things that are surely a hit with
somebody around the world, but in
my mind are better reserved for the 3
a.m. TV slot. The things that don't get
me excited or make me glad to be a
sports fan. The things that make me
just want to go "Really?" or "You've
got to be kidding me."
It's a 2-7 poker hand and a 37-0
rout in football at halftime. It's Roger
Federer's demeanor on the court, the
10th NFL highlight in a row on Sun
day, Tony Dungy's analysis and Pam
Ward (You Tube her).
I can tell you some things that this
column is not. It's not Chad Ochocin
co (or whatever his last name is)
it's not NHL playoffs, Chris Johnson,
Venus and Serena Williams, the NBA
Dunk Contest, a shootout in soccer or
Shaquille O'Neal.
This column is the Super Bowl
halftime show post-Janet Jackson, Bill
Belichick interviews, a JaMarcus Rus
sell-led offense, Walt Harris's Stan
ford play calling, terrible sports
movies, the World's Best Dog compe
tition and David Beckham.
It's not the World Cup, college
football overtime, a play that features
a triple option, March Madness, the
100-meter dash, the "C'mon Man"
segment of Monday Night Count
down, Gus Johnson (You Tube him)
or when Ed Reed intercepts a pass.
It is the Favre-Childress saga, the
discussion of why the Colts decided to
rest their starters, ESPN's Mike &
Mike (especially Greenberg),
archery, arena football and the XFL,
and billiards on TV.
It's not Kobe Bryant at the buzzer,
Sports Center commercials, Jimmie
Johnson, Sunday at the Masters, the
night session at the U.S. Open or Nick
Robinson at the Stanford-Arizona
basketball game in 2004.
It is minor league baseball, the
WWF and UFC, Lil' Wayne's
columns on espn.com, Tim Tebow's
50th inspirational video segment,
golfers from South Africa and ath
letes taking Twitter too far.
It's not Darrelle Revis, Derek
Jeter, the challenge rule in the NFL,
New Year's Day bowl games, a good
version of the national anthem before
a big game, beach volleyball, the
Arthur Ashe ESPY award for
courage, Peyton Manning's commer
cials or sports montages.
It is the Papajohns.com and Little
Caesar's Pizza bowls, the opening
coin toss, an intentional walk, Bible
verses written on fake eye black,
seemingly endless timeouts at the end
of a basketball game, player holdouts
for bigger contracts, badminton and
the "Kiss Cam".
It's not the Kentucky Derby, Mari
ano Rivera, a triple, icing the kicker,
the Little League World Series, a per
fect game, Toby Gerhart, Nathan's
Hot Dog Eating contest and Boise
State's trick plays.
Next week I'll have something
more exciting. Come on, men's bas
ketball.

Danny Belch clearly did not realize that
the MLS Draft took place yesterday.
