# DIVERS KICK OFF SEASON
## Team begins play at Bruin Diving Invitational 
### KABIR SAWHNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Often overlooked because of its small size,
the Stanford diving team has been one of the
nation's premier programs for the past several
years. The team fields eight divers four men
and four women. The team's relatively low on
campus profile is attributable to both its size
and the fact that many of its events take place at
large tournaments off-campus rather than in
dual meets.
In a sport measured chiefly by individual
achievement, the Cardinal divers had some suc
cess last year.The men's team sent two divers to
last year's NCAA Tournament, senior Dwight
Dumais and junior Brent Eichenseer. Dumais
was an All-American in both the one-meter
and three-meter springboards, and Eichenseer
exceeded expectations by winning All-Ameri
can honors in platform diving.
"It was the first time I was an All-American
on both boards," Dumais said. "I was seeded
second in the one-meter finals. But diving is a
sport of moments I didn't have the best of
competitions and I ended eighth. College div
ing is so deep right now if you don't compete
at your best, it's tough to win."
Head coach Dr. Rick Schavone, who is en
tering his 32nd season as Stanford diving's
coach, said he was pleased with last year's re
sults.
"The men had a very good meet. Brent was
exceptionally good," Schavone said. "He had a
very good year and we hope to build on that."
The women's team did not have as much
success, however. Junior Meg Hostage was un
able to finish strong at NCAAs, placing 25th
and 27th in the one-meter and three-meter, re
spectively. Senior Carmen Stellar had relative
ly more success, placing 14th in the platform
consolation finals.
"Carmen was a walk-on, so to do that in her
junior year was an amazing accomplishment,"
Schavone said. "Stellar had a great year, but the
women's season was a disappointment over
all."
For this season, the main focus is on getting
Dumais, Eichenseer, Stellar and Hostage back
to the NCAA Finals and improving on last
year's finishes. Given that all four have already
been to the NCAAs at least once, chances are
high that this goal will be accomplished.
"We want to be in the top 16 for both men
and women," Schavone said.
While the team trains together to build up
camaraderie, diving is essentially an individual
sport and each diver has personal goals for the
end of the season. The two seniors are the most

ambitious.
"My goal is an individual NCAA title on the
one or three-meter springboard. I don't want to
end my Stanford career without bringing home
a title," Dumais said. "Statistically, the one
meter springboard has been my best event I
have three All-Americans and have competed
internationally. Right now, the three-meter is
primarily my focus. That's an Olympic event
while the one-meter is not, so that's where I'd
like to have my success."
Stellar also has big expectations.
"I'd love to final in all events at NCAAs,"
she said. "I also want to get top-three finishes in
all three events at the Pac-10 championships."
The Cardinal sophomores and freshmen
don't really come into this picture, but
Schavone explained that the team's approach is
very long-term.
"[The underclassmen] are just getting bet
ter," he said. "They will keep improving and get
to a level where they can replace the upper
classmen. It's a four-year process."
Sophomore Mary-Beth Corbett also talked
about this progression.
"Being a diver is a four-year process. The
emphasis in freshman and sophomore year is
looking at the upperclassmen, learning and de
veloping new skills. That's what makes Stanford
Diving different from other schools the
focus on the development program."
Corbett said her main goal for this year was
to do well on her dives and continue improving.
"I want to make a statement that I am going
to be one of the top Stanford divers," she said.
The diving team faces its first competition of
the winter season this weekend, when both the
men and the women head to Los Angeles to
compete in the Bruin Diving Invitational.
"We have two factors working against us:
the team went on a break and then they came
back and trained really hard we're a little
beat up right now. This is just an introductory
level for the boys," Schavone said. "It's a test for
the girls against the USC girls, who are the best
in the conference we can see where we are
against them. It's our first meet back it's just
about getting our feet wet."
Stellar agreed, saying: "It's an early meet, so
I'm excited to get a look at the competition and
see where I'm at."
"I simply want to test out how much I've
been training and how much I've improved
over the break," Eichenseer added.
The Bruin Diving Invitational will take
place all day Saturday and Sunday.
