# Gymnastics faces early test
## 
### JESSICA YU 
For Stanford men's gymnastics,
the bear hunt is on. This Friday, in
their first competitive meet of the
season, the No. 1 Cardinal men
face off against the No. 2 Califor
nia Golden Bears at Haas Pavilion
in Berkeley.
For the past five years, Cal has
hosted the Stanford Cardinal in its
gymnastics season opener and if
past precedence foreshadows
what is to come, Stanford needs a
huge performance. In both 2008
and 2009, Stanford came in ranked
No. 1 in the nation, yet both years
the Cardinal was upset by its rival
from across the Bay.
That said, things are looking up
for the Cardinal this time around.
Coming off a phenomenal 2009
season that ended with an NCAA
Team Championship title, Stan
ford begins its 2010 season with
one of the strongest groups of men
in recent team history despite
graduating three of its top ath
letes, according to head coach
Thorn Glielmi.
"We are a different team than
last year, [but] we definitely have
greater scoring potential," he said.
Senior Tim Gentry, team co
captain and current U.S. senior na
tional team member, added,
"Most of our line-up still consists
of experienced underclassmen, so
I don't foresee any major prob
lems."
In fact, Gentry is confident that
Stanford can finally beat Cal in
this competition, the first of three
one-on-one challenges between
the Cardinal and Golden Bears
this year. According to Gentry, it
all comes down to each team's
start values. Stanford's start val
ues, he urges, give them an advan
tage over Berkeley and those
start values may just be what this
particular meet comes down to.
Gymnastics is a complex sport

in which perfect scores are literal
ly limitless. The highest score any
gymnast can receive depends on
his routine's start value. If, for ex
ample, Glielmi (himself a former
gymnast) has a floor exercise rou
tine with a start value of 16.0 and
executes each flip and twist per
fectly, he will score a 16.0. That's a
perfect score for him, but not nec
essarily for the entire world of
gymnastics. The more wow-factor
stunts gymnasts pile into their rou

tines, the higher their start values
go. To today's gymnasts, impres
sive start values run in the 15.0 to
16.0 range.
Last Friday, the Stanford men
revealed some of their start values
in an intrasquad meet an effort
to introduce Stanford's newcom
ers to the collegiate arena and to
reinvigorate Stanford's veterans
and demonstrated just how
much scoring potential they really
have.

Two events that captured Stan
ford's impressive scoring potential
were floor exercise and vault.
During last week's intrasquad
meet. Gentry, an All-American on
the event, nailed his handspring
double pike, earning a high 15.1
and continued on to catapult
through a double front vault for
another high score. While few
other team members showcased
their talents on these events due to
injury, rumor has it that fans can
enjoy intricately exciting sets from
juniors Alex Buscaglia (another
U.S. senior national team mem
ber) and Josh Dixon and freshman
Eddie Penev.
And on still rings, another key
event for Stanford, junior Ryan
Lieberman stuck his full twisting
double layout dismount during
Friday's competition, while fresh
man James Fosco showed off his
incredible strength despite a bro
ken toe that prevented him from
revealing a stunning aerial conclu
sion.
The Golden Bears, on the other
hand, may outperform Stanford
on parallel bars and pommel
horse, their two strongest events.
Returning with the Golden
Bears in their team's first compet
itive meet of the season are soph
omores Glen Ishino and Jim
Kerry, 2009 All-Americans on
parallel bars. Ishino is also a 2009
All-American on pommel horse
and the 2009 season opener's
pommel horse champion.
But for Stanford, the focus is
less on winning this particular
competition and more on improv
ing throughout the season. Fresh
man Paul Hichwa is simply excit
ed to see how his new team stacks
up against another stellar team.
"I know Cal has a lot of talent,"
the high bar specialist said, "so it
should be a great way to start off

our season."
And according to Glielmi, Stan
ford's ultimate line-up has yet to be
determined and will largely depend
on how much the team improves in
difficulty and performance in each
meet in January.
Friday's meet will take place at
7:30 p.m. at Haas Pavilion in Berke
ley.
