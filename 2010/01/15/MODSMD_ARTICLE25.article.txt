# Cardinal men tip off against the Warriors
## 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball team
kicks off its Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation (MPSF) season this weekend when it
hosts No. 8 Hawaii.
Hawaii is coming off a successful week
end at the Outriggers Hotel Invitational,
which it hosted. The Warriors swept No. 10
Ohio State, lost in five sets to No. 5 Penn
State and knocked off No. 1 USC in four
sets.
"They're good. They're a better team
than [their ranking]," said head coach John
Kosty. "I think they're definitely in the top
half of this league."
The team's strongest player is outside
hitter Joshua Walker, who claimed the
MPSF Molten Player of the Week after the
tournament and was similarly named the
Most Valuable Player of the tournament.
Apart from Walker, the Warriors also
boast a number of offensive weapons, such
as Gus Tuaniga, Steven Hunt and Jonas Um
lauft.

GAME NOTES: No. 3 Stanford hopes to start its sea
son on a positive note when it takes on No. 8
Hawaii tonight and Saturday night at Maples Pavil
ion. The Cardinal has high expectations for this sea
son as it returns most of its key contributors from last
year's 21-11 team. Stanford should face a tough
challenge from the Warriors, who are expected to
contend for a conference and national title.

"They're a solid team and it's
going to be a battle," Kosty said.
"Hawaii is not going to be an easy
team."
Against a team like Hawaii, the
middle blockers will be the key line
of defense and even with the loss
of Brandon Williams, Stanford is def
initely up for the challenge.
Returning starter senior Garrett
Werner has held onto the middle
blocker position for the past two
years. As a freshman, Werner came in
second on the team with 72 blocks
and second in hits with 97 kills. As a
sophomore, Werner clinched a five

set win over Hawaii with a solo
block. He also had a thrilling per
formance against UCLA with seven
blocks. Alongside Werner, sopho
more Gus Ellis will be taking sets in
the middle from senior setter Kawi
ka Shoji.
"I think our middles have vastly
improved offensively from last year
so that gives us another threat that
we needed last year," Kosty said. "I
think this year we'll get that consis
tently."
With blocking as the team's first
line of defense, the second line of de
fense comes in the form of sopho
more libera Erik Shoji.
"Erik was the best defender last
year in the country and we were the
best defensive team in the country
last year," Kosty said. "I think our
ball control and passing for our of

fensive game is one of our biggest
strengths."
Good blocking and good passing
will be essential for the Cardinal
against the stacked Hawaii team this
weekend.
Stanford swept both meetings
with the Warriors last year in Hawaii,
led by Kawika Shoji's 49 assists and
outside hitter Evan Romero's 21
kills.
"They're very talented. They're
going to be a tough first opponent,"
Kawika said. "It's going to be an ex
citing first two matches for us."
Stanford needs to come out
strong to start off conference play
because the MPSF is by far the most
competitive conference in the coun
try.
"Although the level of competi
tion in the MPSF was very high last

year, it is shaping up to be even high
er this year," Ellis said. "More impor
tantly than anything else, we will
need to play at the highest level pos
sible for every game of every match
if we are going to accomplish our ul
timate goal."
The ultimate goal is always a na
tional championship and with a
strong team of experienced players
with great chemistry, Stanford has its
hopes set on being in the mix.
The Cardinal takes on the War
riors tonight and Saturday night.
Both matches tip off at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
