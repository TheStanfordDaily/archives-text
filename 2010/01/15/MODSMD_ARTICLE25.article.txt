### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball team
kicks off its Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation (MPSF) season this weekend when it
hosts No. 8 Hawaii.
Hawaii is coming off a successful week
end at the Outriggers Hotel Invitational,
which it hosted. The Warriors swept No. 10
Ohio State, lost in five sets to No. 5 Penn
State and knocked off No. 1 USC in four
sets.
"They're good. They're a better team
than [their ranking]," said head coach John
Kosty. "I think they're definitely in the top
half of this league."
The team's strongest player is outside
hitter Joshua Walker, who claimed the
MPSF Molten Player of the Week after the
tournament and was similarly named the
Most Valuable Player of the tournament.
Apart from Walker, the Warriors also
boast a number of offensive weapons, such
as Gus Tuaniga, Steven Hunt and Jonas Um
lauft.

GAME NOTES: No. 3 Stanford hopes to start its sea
son on a positive note when it takes on No. 8
Hawaii tonight and Saturday night at Maples Pavil
ion. The Cardinal has high expectations for this sea
son as it returns most of its key contributors from last
year's 21-11 team. Stanford should face a tough
challenge from the Warriors, who are expected to
contend for a conference and national title.
