## Stanford Hospital pledges to match funds for Haiti 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford's School of Medi
cine, hospitals and clinics will
match donations from students,
faculty and staff to support the
relief efforts of Hopital Albert
Schweitzer, the only remaining
fully-functioning hospital near
the devastated capital of Port-
Au-Prince in Haiti.

The medical community is of
fering the larger campus commu
nity a dollar-for-dollar challenge
grant of $25,000.
Hopital Albert Schweitzer
(HAS) withstood the magnitude
7.0, Jan. 12 quake that has devas
tated Haiti and left thousands
dead. A HAS report released
Wednesday reads: "As the flow of
people urgently seeking care
increases over the next few days
and weeks, our resources will be
pushed to the breaking point. It is
critical that we receive support to
help us continue with our mission."
The report continues: "This is
the most serious challenge ever
faced by HAS in its 54-year history,
and while we are currently coping
with the onslaught of the injured,
we urgently need support. At this
moment, we don't have the capabil
ity to accept material goods or per
sonnel. Our greatest and most
urgent need is for funds to pay
overtime wages to our dedicated
staff, and to buy replacement medi
cines and supplies."
Those who wish to donate to the
challenge grant may do so at
www.hashaiti.org/Cla_wl .html.
Checks or money orders may also
be sent to Hopital Albert
Schweitzer, P.O. Box 81046,
Pittsburgh, PA, 15217.
For both methods, in order to be
matched, it must be indicated that
the payment is a "tribute gift" from
one of the following institutions:
Stanford University School of
Medicine, Stanford University
Department of Medicine or
Stanford Hospital and Clinics.
