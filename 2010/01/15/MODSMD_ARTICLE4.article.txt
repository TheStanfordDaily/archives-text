## Cardinal women rout Cougars 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
A year after cashing in a dominating
102-53 win over Washington State at home,
the No. 2 Cardinal impressed the Maples
Pavilion crowd once again last night, near
ly doubling-up the Cougars in an 80-43
rout. Nnemkadi Ogwumike posted her sev
enth 20-plus point game of the season, lead
ing both teams with 22 while picking up 13
rebounds. Stanford is now 49-0 all time
against Washington State.
The Cardinal (14-1, 4-0 Pac-10) all but
locked down the game on the defensive
side to open, holding the Cougars (5-11,0-
5) to just 18.4 percent shooting in the first
half. Stanford, meanwhile, found the basket
on 54.8 percent of its shots during the first
frame.
"I think people tried to work hard de
fensively, and we were a lot bigger than
them," said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "I think we could affect their vi
sion and affect their shots. Our team has

defeated the Cougars for the 49th consecutive time. The Cardinal will take on Washington tomorrow.


been working hard defensively, and I
think we've played well defensively
every game this season."
Stanford's dominant first half was
led by an eight-for-10 effort by Og
wumike.The sophomore guard near
ly earned her eventual double-dou
ble in the first half with 16 points and
nine rebounds, and provided one of
the game's most exciting moments
with a mid-air put-back off a missed
Kayla Pederson lay-up.
"[Ogwumike] is a phenomenal
athlete, just a gifted young lady
who's really improved her skills,"
said Washington State head coach
June Daugherty. "It looks like she's
just living in the gym here at Stan
ford, and she's very difficult to
guard. She can hit the step-back or
square up; it's not just a drive and re
bound game like in the past. Her skill
package makes it really, really tough
to guard."
Stanford had a fairly comfortable
control over the game coming into
the second half, leading 42-19, but an
injury to Jeanette Pohlen would ig
nite their offense and lead to them
putting the game away. Two and a
half minutes into the second frame,
the junior guard went down hard
near the basket and had to be carried
off by two trainers, keeping weight
off her right foot.
"Jeanette sprained the same
ankle that she sprained in the Cal
game [two weeks ago]," Van-
Derveer said. "We're gonna have to
let it heal up."

Her teammates, who had yet to
score since halftime, would respond
with a marked increase in tempo and
intensity.
Captain and senior Jayne Appel,
who had only six points until
Pohlen's injury, immediately became
more involved in the game, pulling
down two rebounds and taking more
aggressive shots over the next two
minutes. She ended the game with 14
points and nine rebounds. Point
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude took
initiative as well, picking up two
quick three-pointers after a scoreless
first half.
"I think that they did step up big .
.. Everyone's attention was gotten
at the point, and I think Jayne really
said, 'Wow, I gotta get to work in
here,"' VanDerveer said. "Jayne's a
competitor, and she always posts up
big ... Ros had been playing really
well, too, and she helped us especial
ly when Jeanette went out."
Gold-Onwude, long praised for
her leadership and pesky perimeter
defense, has been contributing a lot
on the offensive end recently as well.
On the heels of a career-high 18-
point effort at UCLA last weekend,
the redshirt senior put up 11 points
against the Cougars last night.
"I think she's playing really confi
dently right now, she's coming out
and looking to take her shot, and I
think that's the main difference
maker for her right now," Appel said.
"She's run this offense for five years
now, so I think it kind of comes with
her role that we expect."
As Stanford built its lead, Van-
Derveer was able to move deeper
into her bench. Seven non-starters
got at least four minutes of time on
the court, their contributions high

lighted by an uncontested Ashley
Cimino three-pointer that electrified
the crowd.
Statistically speaking, the one
dark spot for the Cardinal last night
was in turnovers. The Cougars stole
the ball nine times and forced 16
turnovers, compared to seven steals
and 12 forced turnovers for the Car
dinal.
"We definitely have things to
work on," VanDerveer said. "We
need to take care of the ball better,
and I think we can get on the O
boards better. I thought we were a
little bit sloppy sometimes, [but] we
also have a lot to build on."
The Cardinal will continue its first
full homestand of the conference
season tomorrow afternoon, hosting
the Washington Huskies at 2 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.

Washington State proved once again to be no match for the Stanford women's basketball team, which
defeated the Cougars for the 49th consecutive time. The Cardinal will take on Washington tomorrow.


been working hard defensively, and I
think we've played well defensively
every game this season."
Stanford's dominant first half was
led by an eight-for-10 effort by Og
wumike.The sophomore guard near
ly earned her eventual double-dou
ble in the first half with 16 points and
nine rebounds, and provided one of
the game's most exciting moments
with a mid-air put-back off a missed
Kayla Pederson lay-up.
"[Ogwumike] is a phenomenal
athlete, just a gifted young lady
who's really improved her skills,"
said Washington State head coach
June Daugherty. "It looks like she's
just living in the gym here at Stan
ford, and she's very difficult to
guard. She can hit the step-back or
square up; it's not just a drive and re
bound game like in the past. Her skill
package makes it really, really tough
to guard."
Stanford had a fairly comfortable
control over the game coming into
the second half, leading 42-19, but an
injury to Jeanette Pohlen would ig
nite their offense and lead to them
putting the game away. Two and a
half minutes into the second frame,
the junior guard went down hard
near the basket and had to be carried
off by two trainers, keeping weight
off her right foot.
"Jeanette sprained the same
ankle that she sprained in the Cal
game [two weeks ago]," Van-
Derveer said. "We're gonna have to
let it heal up."

Her teammates, who had yet to
score since halftime, would respond
with a marked increase in tempo and
intensity.
Captain and senior Jayne Appel,
who had only six points until
Pohlen's injury, immediately became
more involved in the game, pulling
down two rebounds and taking more
aggressive shots over the next two
minutes. She ended the game with 14
points and nine rebounds. Point
guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude took
initiative as well, picking up two
quick three-pointers after a scoreless
first half.
"I think that they did step up big .
.. Everyone's attention was gotten
at the point, and I think Jayne really
said, 'Wow, I gotta get to work in
here,"' VanDerveer said. "Jayne's a
competitor, and she always posts up
big ... Ros had been playing really
well, too, and she helped us especial
ly when Jeanette went out."
Gold-Onwude, long praised for
her leadership and pesky perimeter
defense, has been contributing a lot
on the offensive end recently as well.
On the heels of a career-high 18-
point effort at UCLA last weekend,
the redshirt senior put up 11 points
against the Cougars last night.
"I think she's playing really confi
dently right now, she's coming out
and looking to take her shot, and I
think that's the main difference
maker for her right now," Appel said.
"She's run this offense for five years
now, so I think it kind of comes with
her role that we expect."
As Stanford built its lead, Van-
Derveer was able to move deeper
into her bench. Seven non-starters
got at least four minutes of time on
the court, their contributions high

lighted by an uncontested Ashley
Cimino three-pointer that electrified
the crowd.
Statistically speaking, the one
dark spot for the Cardinal last night
was in turnovers. The Cougars stole
the ball nine times and forced 16
turnovers, compared to seven steals
and 12 forced turnovers for the Car
dinal.
"We definitely have things to
work on," VanDerveer said. "We
need to take care of the ball better,
and I think we can get on the O
boards better. I thought we were a
little bit sloppy sometimes, [but] we
also have a lot to build on."
The Cardinal will continue its first
full homestand of the conference
season tomorrow afternoon, hosting
the Washington Huskies at 2 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
