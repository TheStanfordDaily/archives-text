# CARD POUNDED
## Huskies dominate early, pull away from Stanford 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After last weekend's home vic
tories against the Southern Califor
nia schools, Stanford headed north
to face Washington last night with
momentum on its side.
The Huskies (11-5, 2-3 Pac-10)
sat dead last in the Pac-10 Confer
ence before the matchup, with three
straight losses tarnishing their open
ing day win; and even with a good
overall season record, they needed a
positive result to stop the bleeding.
Washington found just what it
needed against Stanford, dominat
ing the Cardinal for a 94-61 victory.
The Cardinal (8-8, 2-2 Pac-10),
despite beginning the day in a three
way tie for the top spot in the con
ference, had its own problems to
overcome, and the Huskies exposed
many of them. Stanford is now 1-6
away from Maples Pavilion so far
this season, with the solitary win

coming against Virginia in Mexico.
The game was back and forth at
the start, with Stanford trailing 7-6
after three minutes. Washington
then took charge, scoring the next
15 points and holding the Cardinal
scoreless for nine minutes.
The Huskies had their way on
the glass, leading 6-1 in offensive re
bounds at one point, while Stanford
made 13 turnovers to Washington's
eight in the first half. Perhaps worse
was the fact the Huskies were much
better at capitalizing on these ex
changes, taking 13 points from these
turnovers to the Cardinal's lowly
two.
Once Stanford finally broke the
run and started scoring again, the
teams began to trade blows more
equally, but the Cardinal could not
close the gap, trailing 41-22 at half
time.
Stanford's top scorer, and second
in the Pac-10, senior Landry
Fields seemed to be having a good

game, scoring over half of the team's
points in the first half, more than any
of the Huskies individually, and
leading his teammates in most other
statistics. But without his fellow
players making an impact, it was
going to be a long night.
Early in the second half, Stan
ford began to trim the lead, getting it
down to 16 points, but this momen
tum did not last as senior Quincy
Pondexter began take control for
the Huskies. In the first six and a half
minutes of the second half, he added
14 points to his haul, looking like he
would certainly be the man of the
match.
When freshman forwardTyreese
Breshers committed his fourth foul,
there seemed to be a glimmer of
hope for the Card, as Washington
had a number of players in foul
trouble.

NOTES I Stanford continued its road struggles, falling at
Washington 94-61 for its sixth loss in seven games away
from the Farm. The Cardinal hopes to redeem itself with
another road test against Washington State. The Cougars
are also looking to get back on the winning trail after los
ing their last two games, at Arizona State and versus Cal.

ers had started to register on the score
board, it seemed that maybe there
would still be time for them to make
the final result look respectable, even
if the chance of fully getting back into
this game looked increasingly remote.

But at the same time, Fields had been
neutralized and did not score again
for seven minutes, removing Stan
ford's main threat.
Credit, though, has to go to Fields
for being the lone Cardinal player
ranked alongside a trio of Huskies
Pontdexter, sophomore guard Isaiah
Thomas and junior guard Venoy
Overton as the top performers in
the match.
In the last few minutes, it was pref

ty clear the game was settled, and both
coaches were probably already look
ing ahead to Saturday, resting key per
sonnel while sending players out from
the bench to gain experience in a con
ference game.
The road trip continues tomorrow
afternoon, with a 2 p.m. tip off at
Washington State.
