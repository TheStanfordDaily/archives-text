## Prof. Zimbardo dissects villainy System perpetuates evil actions, Zimbardo says 
### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Attacking a system that produces villains,
Stanford Prof. Emeritus Philip Zimbardo lec
tured at Cubberley Auditorium Thursday
evening, interspersing jokes with mentions of
Hitler, obesity and torturing puppies.
During the lecture, the first in the newly
created Meng-Wu lecture series put on by the
Center for Compassion and Altruism in the
School of Medicine, Zimbardo explored how
humans turn from good to evil.
Grabbing the audience's attention from
the beginning, Zimbardo blared his "evil
warm-up music" Carlos Santana's song
"Change your Evil Ways" through the
auditorium.

As he danced and mouthed along to the
song, audience members chatted excitedly in
the background about seeing Zimbardo "in
the flesh," as many were familiar with the
professor's past research, including the
Stanford Prison Experiment.
Zimbardo, who considers good and evil as
part of the human condition, blamed the sys
tem for producing such modern day "villains"
as Stalin, Hitler, Chairman Mao, Saddam
Hussein and Dick Cheney. According to
Zimbardo, the people themselves are not at
fault; instead, the system had set them up to
become evil.
"It's not that someone is born good or
born evil," he said. "We are born in capacity
to do both at any time."
Systemic social norms affect peoples'
behavior to positive or negative effect. To
prove his point, he cited social connections as
the prime cause of obesity.
"The worst is to have a friend who is a
fatty," Zimbardo said. "You're going to
become fat 147 percent of the time."
He reserved blame for society, rather than
"evil" individuals.
According to Zimbardo, people claim that

only the sadists would engage in sadistic
behavior, but a study proved that 65 percent
of people would fully electrocute someone
when egged on.
"It's not that you're an evil person," he
said. "You're just trapped in the situation."
Audience members looked uneasy as
Zimbardo brought up a study in which stu
dents were asked to electrify a puppy for the
sake of their grades. According to him,
though many subjects were crying while
watching the puppy struggle and squeal, they
still proceeded to raise the shock level when
told.
Most shockingly, Zimbardo drew a paral
lel between his famous Prison Experiment
with photos taken at Abu Ghraib. Audience
members sat quietly, but in awe, as Zimbardo
showed a dramatic slideshow of the pictures
taken at the Abu Ghraib prison.
"Power without oversight is a recipe for
abuse everywhere," he said. "People who usu
ally do good might do otherwise when under
certain situations.
"It's systemic and not limited to Abu
Ghraib," he added. "If the problem was bad
apples, then they could be sent to prison and
the situation would be fixed. But no, the
Army knew that the situation would make
the soldiers do evil."
Calling the incident entirely predictable
behavior, he also blamed the government for
the soldiers' actions.
"[The U.S. government] gave them per
mission to do whatever the hell they want
without any surveillance at night in the dun
geons," he said. "The government just didn't
think that they would take pictures, but the
soldiers did, and even used them as bragging
rights.
"It's hard to say that the things people are
doing are not systemic if the system is sup
porting them," he added.
But he stressed that heroism existed as an
antidote to evil, and he encouraged everyone
to do "good" in the world.
"Very few people do good shit and very
few people do bad shit," he said. "Most just
do no shit at all."
Zimbardo flipped through slides of heroes
and explained each story of heroism, from
Rosa Parks to Holocaust resistors to a man
who recently jumped onto train tracks in
order to save a man having a seizure.
Unless someone speaks out, the cycle of
violence will perpetuate itself, he said.
Zimbardo then admitted that the only reason
he had concluded the Stanford Prison
Experiment early was because his current
wife, his personal hero, commented on how
sadistic the experiment was.
Students were impressed by the informa
tion the professor presented.
"I heard a little bit about [his research]
before, but his full theories in detail were
really cool," said Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
'l3. "He gave us a more whole way of viewing
the world instead of just dismissing people as
evil."
Macgregor-Dennis added: "I think his
heroes research is going to be really cool
hopefully, he'll come up with some practical
suggestions about how people can be in the
world."
