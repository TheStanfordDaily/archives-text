# SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN CUBBERLEY
## Odor in Cubberley last quarter possibly due to leaking pipes, rodents

( V t's not a bad smell," said Jess
I Fisher 'l3. "It is like the nostalgic
I musty smell you get when you
I walk into an old building."
At the beginning of last quarter, the
Cubberley School of Education was widely
talked about among students due to the mys
terious smell emanating from the building.
Reports about the smell ranged from
sewage to mustiness, and some students with
fall quarter classes in Cubberley never
smelled anything.
"I never really noticed a smell," said
Shannon Wong 'lO, who had a morning class
in Cubberley fall quarter.
But the faculty and administration within
the building were well aware of the odor. One
administrator, who wished to remain anony
mous, provided confirmation about the smell
along with emphatic nodding and a slight
chuckle.
It was when students, staff and faculty
began moving back into Cubberley after the

construction project this past summer to
retrofit it for earthquakes that the smell was
first noticed.
"Right about the time that the project was
completing ... people started talking about a
smell," explained Kathleen Baldwin, zone
manager of section C of campus, which
includes Cubberley.
Up to nearly the end of fall quarter the
smell was still a problem, but it appeared to be
gradually dissipating.
"It seems to be getting better," explained
Ona Andre, building manager for Cubberley.
"I believe it was stronger in the past [earlier in
fall quarter] when it was called in."
After enough complaints came in to con
firm that the smell was not just noticed by the
oversensitive, Zone Management was called
in to investigate.
Zone managers such as Baldwin oversee
one of fours zones on campus, acting as the
property managers of academic buildings.
"Not so much the fire, but the floods and
the locusts we go out and help people [on
campus]," Baldwin said, explaining the
involvement of the Zone Managers into the
investigation at Cubberley.
Baldwin, along with a team that includes
pest control, electricians, technicians,
plumbers, contractors for the Cubberley con
struction, the custodial company and
Environmental Health and Safety, worked to

comb the building top to bottom searching for
the smell.
Several ideas were investigated, ranging
from checking the procedures of how the cafe
in Cubberley dealt with their garbage to
ensuring that the drain heading down to the
sewers was being kept wet. If the drain dries
out it will result in a sewage-like smell.
"You don't throw out any clue, you don't
throw out any possibility of what it could be,"
explained Baldwin about their investigation
techniques.
"We went from the top to the bottom and
we found a couple of things that we thought
could be suspect," she added.
During the summer the steam radiators for
Cubberley were shut down; sometimes when
they are turned back on they may leak or
smell.
"Over the years we have had issues with
fumes and that kind of thing," Andre said.
"Mainly from radiators. [The smell] is fleet
ing."
When Cubberley was investigated, a small
leak was found in an old air-handling area of
the fountain.
"We found a small leak [in the air-handling
unit] that we fixed, but basically we just went
through the whole building and didn't see a
whole lot of issues that could cause [the
stench]," Baldwin said.
Another issue that possibly contributed to

the smell was rodents in Cubberley. After
looking around the mechanical rooms in
Cubberley, some evidence of rodents was
found. This issue was cleaned up and the mesh
in the mechanical rooms was fixed to ensure
that the rodents could not return.
"As we started solving these problems the
smell has abated," Baldwin explained. "So
right before we went on break I called Ona
and asked how things were going over there
and she said, 'You know, we haven't had many
problems.'"
Baldwin believes that it was a series of
small steps that resulted in the correction of
the smell.
"So to me, I think it was more of the build
ing starting to come back to 100 percent occu
pancy and usefulness and also some of the
smaller leak areas that we found that helped,"
she said.
This quarter, there has been a sudden drop
in complaints by faculty and students about
the smell.
"We haven't had any complaints from the
faculty [winter quarter]," Andre said.
Students who are using Cubberley for the
first time this quarter have not even been
aware of the smell, except through rumors.
"I have not smelled anything and I am very
sensitive to smells," said Deanna Chase 'l3.
Although students and administration this
quarter have noticed the lack of smell within
the building, the Zone manager investigation
has not been closed.
"We aren't done with Cubberley," Baldwin
stated. "If somebody says today that they're

smelling that smell again, we would go right
back there and start the investigation again.
We are very proactive about keeping our
buildings safe."
