## EDITORIAL ASSU Executive Mid-Year Evaluation: Part One 
### 
The current ASSU Executive officers,
computer science co-terminal student
David Gobaud and Andy Parker 'll,
are roughly half-way through their term.
Last spring, the Editorial Board gave its full
endorsement to the former Gobaud/de la
Torre Executive slate, praising its "bountiful
platform" and "well-researched and
thoughtful proposals." Now, with the term
half-over, it is time to see how well this Ex
ecutive team has lived up to its campaign
platform and proposals.
Overall, the Executive team of Gobaud
and Parker and, until last quarter, Jay de
la Torre as well has been largely success
ful in delivering on its campaign promises.
Gobaud especially has shown an extraordi
nary level of tenacity and commitment to
student leadership, highlighted by his most
recent work coordinating with other univer
sities to raise relief funds for Haiti. Through
out its term, this team has led the way on a
number of initiatives some highly re
garded and others less noticeable that
have exhibited significant dedication to is
sues both on campus and in the world at
large.
Engaging graduate students, utilizing
technology in innovative ways and promot
ing sustainability have all been, in particu
lar, major accomplishments of the Execu
tive's first six months in office. In these
areas, the Executive officers have complet
ed nearly every bullet point of their plat
form; open and transparent government
was a promise made and strongly delivered
upon. Numerous town hall events with key
administrators have been organized and
broadcast. The ASSU book exchange and
events calendar have also served to help de
mocratize information.

presidents to meetings, to holding joint
council meetings and instituting election re
form, which bring professional school vot
ing dates in alignment with those of the
greater campus.
Some of the greatest progress made
under the current Executive has been in the
area of campus sustainability, which during
the campaign was a central pillar of their
platform.Tresidder and Old Union are mov
ing closer to zero percent waste, while plans
are currently in the works for a campus Sus
tainability Summit in spring quarter. The
tray-less dining hall campaign and the green
move-in and move-out programs are also
commendable initiatives made by this Exec
utive. The ASSU Green Store has also been
expanding, selling over 20,000 recyclable
cups since its opening. Comparing these ini
tiatives to their sustainability goals during
the campaign, the Executive has already
made enormous strides in fulfilling their
platform promises.
One area of their platform that has been
largely left incomplete concerns reforms to
the Judicial Affairs process, specifically re
garding the procedure for handling sexual
assault cases on campus. While Gobaud has
actively worked to initiate review and dis
cussion in this area, real reform in Judicial
Affairs must be made on the committee
level. And at this time, unless maj or action is
made across the different layers of the or
ganization, it is entirely possible and per
haps likely that real change in Judicial
Affairs will have to wait for another time
and a different Executive.
The Executive administration's commit
ment to fulfilling the platform of their cam
paign, together with the officers' dedication
and ability to engage the student communi
ty, leaves the Editorial Board feeling very
positively about our endorsement of the
slate. Though the scandal of Jay de la Torre's
resignation casts an unfortunate blemish on
the Executive slate's term, the officers have
nevertheless exhibited a strong ability to
live up to their promises, even in the face of
controversy. For this, the Editorial Board
congratulates the ASSU Executive slate on
a successful term half-finished.

The graduate student community has
been given considerable attention by this
Executive, a marked improvement over
previous administrations. The Executive
cabinet currently includes numerous gradu
ate students, as well as various positions
meant solely to serve the graduate popula
tion. A town hall held this past summer
brought several hundred constituents to
gether with Provost John Etchemendy and
his colleagues to discuss student life. Work
has also been done to more actively incor
porate the Graduate Student Council into
the broader ASSU fabric, from small ges
tures such as inviting professional school

which we will examine the work still left to be
done by this administration.
