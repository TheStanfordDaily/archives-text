## ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA American Exit Exams, How Low Can You Go? 
### Danny Crichton 
jcried a little when I read this story.
The New York Times ran an article last
week titled, "As School Exit Tests Prove
Tough, States Ease Standards," in which the re
porter notes the typical cycles in exit exam dif
ficulty. When exit exams are first released, they
legitimately cover the knowledge expected of
a high school graduate. As poor test scores roll
in, legislatures quickly work to ease the diffi
culty of the test to ensure high graduation
rates.
This trend is certainly nothing new. What
particularly struck me was this paragraph:
"Critics of Arkansas's [exit exam] system say it
fails to show true math proficiency because
students have only to score 24 out of 100 to
pass the test and those who fail will be granted
two additional chances to take the test. After
that, they can take a computerized tutorial that
is followed by a test." Our standard for gradu
ating seniors is less than one in four correct on
content from Algebra I.
Where are the politicians and education
leaders when the discussion of a knowledge
based economy comes up? Economists, labor
leaders and corporate heads have all identified
the most significant paradigm shift in cen
turies. Education is not just a hobby for the
bourgeoisie: it is a prerequisite for every single
citizen of this country to find a basic job to put
food on the table.
We need to radically reconsider our notions
of what an education is if we are to thrive
nay, survive in the 21st century. We have
lowered our expectations, lowered our bars
and lowered our standards to the point where
the goal of high schools in America is getting
students to count and read a sentence, and yet,
we still can only push three out of four to a

diploma. That is a humiliating disgrace for a
nation that prides itself on the advanced state
of its science and technology.
If you believe the leaders of our states, the
solution to this situation is to cut funding to ed
ucation. To a certain degree, I do not blame
them. It is hard to imagine a system that could
so clearly fail as much as education and yet
continue to be handed funding. Nonetheless, it
is a painfully short-term decision, made by
politicians who will be out of office before
their damage is realized.
To reform education, politicians must re
duce the power of three groups: teachers
unions, supporters of teachers colleges and
hovercraft parents.Teachers unions, more than
any other force, are killing American educa
tion. New York Public Schools are forced to re
tain teachers who abuse children and fail to
teach their subject in a special Rubber Room
because of their union contracts. Education is
not about the teachers; it is about the students.
Bad teachers should be fired. Period.
We need to vastly reform teacher colleges
and the licensing system. Teachers need to
learn their future subjects, not learn the psy
chology of teaching. Instead, schools should
offer mentoring opportunities and better on
the-job training for new teachers while also en
couraging further study in their academic dis
cipline. This system will also open the door to

students who never considered teaching, but
may be open to pursuing it as a career.
The final group that needs to be targeted
are hovercraft parents. When a son or daugh
ter comes home with a bad grade, parents
swoop in and demand gold stars to make them
feel good. They then go to the polls and ensure
that politicians who are elected share their
mindset. These are the same parents attempt
ing to eliminate homework because it takes
away from sports practice. We need to demand
more, not less, of our students.
Reducing the power of these three groups
will not be easy, but to create these higher stan
dards, every one of them will need to be in
volved. They need to agree to a set of common
standards that every high school senior should
know. And then they need to test to those stan
dards and hold the line.

What can we do? Talk about your experi
ence and passion for learning to every young
person in your family and encourage them to
seek out the very best education they can find.
Fight against apathy, anti-intellectualism and
the rugged individual notion that education
does not matter. When someone tells you,"Oh,
math is not really my thing," respond back,
"And working at McDonald's isn't mine."
I am not willing to hear that students in
America are incapable of handling a harder
workload and more advanced coursework.
These critics are wrong and I do not believe
them. I believe in programs like KIPP, in which
even the most unprepared students have been
developed and sent to college. We need to raise
standards throughout our country and hold
them there. Our future depends on it.
