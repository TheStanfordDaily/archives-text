# The
						Hidden Joys of Third-Tier Housing
## 
### Molly Spaeth 
Let me apologize up front. I'm admitting
the inspiration for this forthcoming col
umn came to me approximately 37 sec
onds ago after a 45-minute run around Cam
pus Drive Loop while listening to "Bad Ro
mance" by Lady Gaga on repeat.
I'm apologizing, secondly, because while
writing this forthcoming column I'm still lis
tening to "Bad Romance" by Lady Gaga on
repeat, lest I forget what I wanted to say (my
condolences, Faisan third floor).
But that's exactly where the idea for this
piece originated, the same third floor of
Faisan that will continue to suffer through the
next 25 minutes of the Lady herself as I pump
the adrenaline out of my veins and onto my
pink keyboard-covered Mac√üook.
I'm a junior coming back from a fabulous
quarter abroad in Madrid, and like most of
my fellow returners, I was dropped into third
tier upperclass housing like it's hot, in a com
plex I lovingly refer to as the "Flo." Although
I was a little nervous about doing a second
year in Florence Moore Hall (I partied with
Mirlo sophomore year), I vowed to go into
my Faisan homecoming disregarding the less
than-encouraging insights of my fellow jaded
juniors.
But what a homecoming it was. Third day
back on campus and I had what seemed like
every freshman in East Flo smiling, waving
and shouting, "Hey, Molly!" at me in the hall
ways. Now I'm notoriously bad with names,
but their enthusiasm and genuine interest in
getting to know me and welcoming me into
their freshman community instilled in me an
equally genuine interest in wanting to learn
more about them.
I remember something my freshman year
RA in J-Ro, Laura Holmes 'OB, told me: "I
love living with freshman," she said. "My
friends are all so jaded and wrapped up in
their own personal concerns, but you guys
have so much enthusiasm. It's so refreshing."
I hate to sound like a naive idealist, but this
was not the only thing Laura ended up being
right about (but isn't that the point of fresh
man dorm RAs? They're right about
EVERYTHING). What happened to that

freshman enthusiasm we seemed to imbibe at
nearly every new prospect of Stanford discov
ery? Participation at class events has been
shown to steadily decrease every year and it is
a constant struggle for the class cabinet to
keep up interest at these events. As a result,
you have events leaning steadily toward those
that can reel the most people in (like free In
n-Out during finals week) and less toward
those with actual substance, like class-wide
community service events or academic work
shops. And I understand it. If you have similar
events you attend with groups you're more
dedicated to, why would you choose to partic
ipate in something with random people you

don't know in the Class of Oh-Leven?
Is it, as my beloved editor Zachary Warma
put in his Jan. 11 column, that we have just re
alized that all of those Stanford traditions that
were so unique to our class and our class only
have been repeated in almost the exact same
fashion every year since? Was the inception
of our cynicism marked at the first moment
we heard Dean Julie tell the Class of Oh-
Twelve that THEY were the best class ever,
after having heard nothing but the same
about the Class of Oh-Leven for the entirety
of the year before? Did we get so preoccupied
with finishing cover letters for McKinsey's
Summer Business Analyst internship that
we've lost a genuine interest in each other?
It's not that we need to be coddled, and I
don't need someone to hold my hand and tell
me how special I am every day; I have a mom
who does that practically every hour. But
something has got to be said for these SLE
freshmen, with arguably the worst stereotyp
ical reputation on campus, who go out of their
way to welcome an old, jaded, Lady Gaga
loving stranger into their perfect, solidified,
third-floor community (and as a former ener
getic, bright-eyed freshman, you KNOW how
strong freshman communities are).
It's time to go back to the basics. I'm not
asking you to de-pledge Pi Phi or boycott
your Stanford in Government meetings, but
merely to step back and realize that there are
about 15,894 other groups on campus that still
might be able to enrich your life outside of
your entrenched comfort zone, even if you
think you don't need them. You may not need
them, but I sure as hell know that a little
nudge out of my comfort zone garnered me
about 45 new friends and that same fresh
man-inspired, revitalized enthusiasm I
thought I had lost. But in all honesty, the lat
ter just might be the adrenaline talking.
I'll see you at Junior Formal, Oh-Leven.

Molly has finally turned off"Bad Romance "only
to move onto something more intellectually stim
ulating, "Tik-Tok." Care to get her off her Top-40
Cycle of Death? E-mail mspaeth@stanford.edu
with recommendations.

Step back and realize that
there are about 15,000
other groups on campus
that still might be able to
enrich your life outside of
your comfort zone.
