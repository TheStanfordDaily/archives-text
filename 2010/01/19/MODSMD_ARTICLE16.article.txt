Cardinal tennis is back.
After a three-year rare downturn for the Stanford
men's tennis program, the Cardinal announced its re
turn to dominance at the Sherwood Cup, as sophomore
Bradley Klahn captured the singles title and Klahn and
sophomore Ryan Thacher reached the semifinals in
doubles.
"I think the team as a whole we had a pretty good
showing," Klahn said. "Singles, guys were plying pretty
well and had some good wins. Doubles was decent; I
think we got a lot of room for improvement, but we're
heading in the right direction."
Klahn defeated Baylor's Denes Lukacs 6-3,6-4 on
Sunday afternoon to claim his second singles title of the
year. Klahn took home hardware at the ITA Northwest
Regional Championships previously in the year.
"I felt pretty good the entire week," Klahn said. "I
got better with each match and was playing my best ten
nis by the middle of the semis and finals. I improved my
serve and backhand. That was one of things I was work
ing on the most over the summer and fall and it's start
ing to show."
The championship victory was especially gratifying
for junior Alex Clayton, who lost to Lukacs 0-6,6-2,6-2
in the semifinals. Clayton reached the semis after the
No. 1 seed in the tournament, USC's Steve Johnson,
could not play due to back spasms.
There were more Stanford ties in the tournament.
Nine Cardinal players entered the singles tournament
and five Klahn, Clayton, Thacher, freshman Matt
Kandath and senior Richard Wire survived the first
round. In the second round, Wire and Kandath both fell
in straight sets to USC's top two players Johnson
and Robert Farah.
"I feel in much better shape now than I did before

the tournament," Wire said. "I think everyone used it as
a good warm-up."
In the quarterfinals, Klahn and Thacher, Stanford's
No. 1 ranked doubles team, squared off against each
other. Thacher kept it close in the first set, losing in a
tiebreaker, but could not keep up with Klahn in the sec
ond set, losing 6-2.
On the doubles side, the Cardinal, which has been
mixing up the lineup and pairings, had a solid, if un
spectacular, showing. Klahn and Thacher had a bye
into the quarterfinals. Clayton and Wire, Stanford's
No. 2 ranked team, advanced out of the first round,
while the duos of freshman Walker Kehrer and junior
Ted Kelly and Kandath and freshman Denis Lin had
early exits.
In the quarterfinals, Klahn and Thacher made quick
work of their UC-Irvine opponents, defeating them 8-
3. Clayton and Wire lost 8-3 to a USC team featuring
the same Johnson who could play Clayton a day earli
er.
In the semifinals, an unranked USC squad upset
Klahn and Thacher, 8-3.
In order for Stanford to win its 19th NCAA champi
onship, the doubles must improve.
As the Sherwood Cup showed, the Cardinal's sin
gles lineup can play with anyone in the nation, so "the
doubles point could be the difference" in advancing to
the next round, according to Wire.
Stanford opens its regular season against Sacramen
to State this Saturday. While picked to win the Big Sky
Conference, the Hornets should not pose too much of
a threat to the Cardinal, if Stanford plays at the same
level it did at the Sherwood Cup.
The match is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. at the Taube
Tennis Center.
