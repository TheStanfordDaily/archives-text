## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Facing its first opponent of the regular season,
the No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball team decisive
ly handled No. 8 Hawaii in back-to-back matches
this weekend on the Farm.
The Warriors came to Stanford following an
upset over the nation's top-ranked program, USC
and looked to extend their winning streak. How
ever, the Cardinal dominated both matches, never
trailing by more than one point in any set.
"We knew that UH was a team that could get
hot at any moment so we knew it was necessary to
have a killer instinct and put them away as early as
possible," said junior outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin. "They had just beaten the No. 1 team
in the country, so we couldn't let them get any mo
mentum."
On Friday, January 15, the Cardinal opened its
season at Maples Pavilion to a spirited crowd of
costumed students and local volleyball enthusi
asts. Despite a match-opening service error, Stan
ford jumped out to an early 10-6 lead, with multi
ple kills from senior Evan Romero and sopho
more Brad Lawson.
Consistent serving from McLachlin and front
row play from sophomore Gus Ellis and senior
Garrett Werner aided the Cardinal to a 24-13
lead. Four serves from Myles Muagututia, multi

ple offensive errors from Hawaii and a final kill by
Werner brought the first set to a 30-15 close.
After switching sides, the Cardinal quickly as
serted itself in the second set, with a kill from
McLachlin and two aces and a kill from Romero.
Three straight service aces by Lawson brought
the score to 23-13, but the Warriors rallied back
within six points after several Stanford attack er
rors and Hawaii kills. The team regained its com
posure with a timeout and the second set ended
with a Romero kill and a final score of 30-21.
Like the first two, the third set was dominated
by the Card. Ellis went on an early six-serve run,
bringing the score to 6-2. Romero, McLachlin and
Lawson continued to put down balls from senior
setter Kawika Shoji, leading Stanford to an even
tual 30-18 third set and 3-0 victory over Hawaii.
Romero and Lawson finished the match with
13 kills apiece. Kawika Shoji played consistently
both offensively and defensively with 37 assists
and 8 digs. The Cardinal hit .494 versus Hawaii's
.113.
The following day, Stanford faced Hawaii yet
again, showing no signs of slowing down from
their impressive play the night before.
McLachlin opened the match with a block and
three kills. Kawika Shoji maintained the momen
tum with two kills and an assist to Romero, help
ing Stanford to a 9-3 lead.
The teams went back and forth with multiple

service and attack errors on each side with the
Cardinal maintaining an 8 to 10 point lead. Five
late Hawaii kills and a service ace brought the
score to 28-23, but a kill by Lawson followed by a
Lawson-Ellis block closed the first set at 30-23.
The second set proved to be the closest of the
matches with the teams going back and forth on
almost every point. Romero and Lawson traded
kills with Hawaii's Jonas Umlauft and Joshua
Walker.
At 20-18, a kill and ace by McLachlin gave
Stanford a four-point lead, which was carried to
the set's final score of 30-26.
Ellis started the third set strong, with the open
ing kill followed by three serves. McLachlin did
the same, contributing three kills of his own to
bring Stanford to a 4-1 lead. Hawaii came back to
close the gap,but after the Warriors' Joshua Walk
er served an ace to make the score 16-11, Hawaii
never came within five points of the Card.
Two kills from Evan Romero as well as several
attacking errors from Hawaii helped Stanford
widen the lead to seven points at 18-11.
Two consecutive blocks from Ellis and two
kills by Garrett Dobbs brought the team into the
final stretches of the match. A kill from Garrett
Werner ended the final set of the series at 30-19,
with the Cardinal completing a two-match, six-set
sweep over the Warriors.
Sophomore libera Erik Shoji finished the

match with an impressive 14 digs and brother
Kawika contributed 41 assists. The Cardinal put
down 50 kills, led by Romero with 14, McLachlin
with 13 and Lawson with 11. Hawaii's Umlauft
and Walker contributed 11 kills each. Stanford
finished the weekend with 13 service aces versus
Hawaii's two.
"Our serving the first match was probably the
best we have served as a team since I have been at
Stanford," McLachlin said. "Secondly, we blocked
extremely well."
