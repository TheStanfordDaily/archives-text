# SO CLOSE, SO FAR

### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford played a nearly perfect second half
Saturday afternoon at Washington State, but it was
n't enough to make up for its slow start in the first
in a 77-73 loss to the Cougars.
Washington State (13-5,3-3 Pac-10), led by Klay
Thompson's 27 points, jumped out to a 46-26 lead
going into the locker room and held on with 7-of-8
free-throw shooting from Reggie Moore in the
game's final minute. The Cardinal (8-9,2-3 Pac-10)
got within two points twice in the last minute, but
Moore responded with two made free throws each
time, never giving Stanford a shot to tie the game.
The loss moved Stanford to 0-6 on the road this
season.
"On the road, you have to play defense and
you've got to take care of the ball," said senior
Landry Fields to the San Jose Mercury News. "Each
game that we've lost, we showed a lack of defense
and a lack of taking care of the ball."
"I think it's [a lack of] togetherness as well as
communication," said sophomore Jeremy Green.
"We show it at home. We show sparks of it on the
road."
Fields and Green carried the offensive load
once again for the Cardinal, with Green scoring 24
points on 9-of-22 shooting. Fields had 18 points and
10 rebounds but on only 6-of-17 shooting, while
sophomore center Jack Trotter and senior point
guard Drew Shiller had 12 and 10 points, respec
tively. Trotter also finished with eight rebounds.
The box score essentially tells the story. The two
teams were very close in most of the significant cat
egories, except for one: field-goal percentage. The
Cardinal's atrocious first half shooting the ball (26
percent) proved to be the difference, while the
Cougars were steady throughout the game with 51
percent shooting.
Still, Stanford's second half comeback was
backed by 6-of-12 shooting from three-point range,
while the Cougars were 0-for-7 in the same catego
ry for the second half.
The Cardinal systematically lowered the
deficit throughout the half, cutting down Wash
ington State's lead to single digits with less than
ten minutes to go. The Cougars also played com-

GAME NOTES ! After nearly edging out a come-from-be

will return to Maples Pavilion this weekend, where they
are 7-2 this season. They'll face the Beavers on Thurs

instead of increasing it which may have helped
the Cardinal back into the game. Stanford was
pretty much on pace for a road comeback of epic
proportions, but it simply was not meant to be in
the end.
"I give my kids credit," said Head Coach Johnny
Dawkins. "They fought. They tried to make a great
comeback ... We didn't have enough time and
[Washington State] executed at the end."
Stanford will now return to the friendly confines
of Maples Pavilion, where it is 7-2 this season. This
week's games will be very important for the Cardi
nal, which is only a game and a half back from first
place in the Pac-10 standings, but happens to be tied
for last place in the conference. There is currently a
complete logjam in the conference, which is experi
encing one of its worst years in decades the top
record is 4-2 (held by Arizona State) while the
worst is 2-3 (held by each Oregon State, Oregon,
UCLA and Stanford).
In any case, this week's games will be huge for a
Cardinal team that always seems to save its best for
home. The matchups against the Beavers and
Ducks are both very winnable games and a week
end sweep would put Stanford above .500 in both
overall and league play.
