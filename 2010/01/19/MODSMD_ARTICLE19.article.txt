# So much for momentum
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
The Chargers have won 11
straight —no one wants to
play them. The Colts haven't
played a real game in months
they're rusty. The Cowboys are on
fire they can beat anyone.The Saints
lost all their energy by losing their last
three games they can't handle a
high-powered offense.
Whoops. Shows you what momen
tum does for you.
Momentum is like a basketball
team's record on Fridays or head-to
head results from 50 years ago —it
gives the media something to talk
about for the days leading up to a game.
And who can blame them? Writers and
broadcasters have to talk about one
matchup for days, so they have to keep
coming up with new angles to discuss.
There's only so much you can say about
schemes and players and statistics.
Of course, momentum does mean
something. Anyone who has ever
played a sport can tell you that it's easi
er to play well when you've been play
ing well already.
Professional athletes should be able
to bounce back and neutralize momen
tum though, and the NFL is probably
the least conducive league to maintain
ing momentum. Football is played once
per week, so there's a long time for mo
mentum to wear off Also, football is
such a physical game that players main
ly react by instinct rather than feeling
the pressure of the moment or trying to
maintain positive momentum.
The proof of this could be seen this
past weekend. The two hottest teams
coming in, San Diego and Dallas, were
by far the biggest disappointments. The
Chargers were expected to steamroll
the happy-to-be-there Jets, but the
home team looked like the nervous un
derdogs, making numerous errors in
crucial situations and allowing the un
spectacularly consistent Rex Ryans to
come out on top.
The Cowboys were the trendy upset
pick of the weekend. In fact, so many
people projected a road victory for
"America's team" that the betting line
was nearly even. Instead, Dallas ran
into a far superior team in Minnesota,
and the Vikings dominated their over
hyped counterparts, racking up more
sacks (six) than the Cowboys had
points (three).
The other two games also defied the
expected rust vs. momentum battles.
The Ravens and Cardinals both im
pressed a lot of experts with offensive
explosions against good defenses in the
first round. Although both were ex
pected to lose in the wild card round,
Baltimore and Arizona combined for
84 points to defeat New England and
Green Bay, respectively.
These two teams rode their appar
ent momentum into matchups with
two "rusty" number one seeds in Indi
anapolis and New Orleans. Both home
teams had fallen off after undefeated
starts, and both teams had question
marks on defense, so many people ex
pected the Ravens and Cardinals to
have success on the offensive end. In
stead, the Colts and Saints shut down
their opponents, holding them to 17
points combined while forcing six
turnovers.
Thus, in two short days, the whole
concept of momentum was completely
turned upside down. What does that
tell us? Well, maybe there's a reason
these teams had the records they did.
Maybe there's a reason the Colts and
Saints won their first 27 games com
bined. Maybe there's a reason the
Cowboys had the largest ups and
downs of any team in the league, while
the Vikings were consistently among
the top teams in the NFC. It all comes
back to execution you can have all
the momentum you want, but the team
that plays better at the right time will
win.
It sounds simple, but the stats don't
lie. So far in these playoffs, the team
with more total yards is 8-0. The team
that forces more turnovers is 8-o.That's
about as sure-fire of a formula as you'll
ever see.
Predictions and analysis are great,
and I memorize the facts experts say on
television as much as anyone. But
things often don't go the way people
expect (in case you didn't notice, the
Jets are in the AFC Championship
Game.)
As Chris Berman so appropriately
says, "that's why they play the games."
