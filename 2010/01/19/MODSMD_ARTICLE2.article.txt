## Pfizer, Inc. gives $3M to CME Pizzo: 'Pfizer will not be involved in how it's spent' 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford School of Medicine
recently received a $3 million grant
to eliminate corporate influence on
continuing medical education
(CME). The grant, however, came
from an unexpected source: pharma
ceutical giant Pfizer, Inc.
Since 2008, Stanford has had a
strict policy against commercial sup
port for specific CME programming.
However, this grant is an exception
due to its open-ended scope. The
three-year grant will go toward a new
metric-based approach to the overall
Stanford CME program and will be
distributed at Stanford's discretion,
without any input from Pfizer.
"The grant comes to us as a gift,
and Pfizer will not be involved in
how it is spent," wrote Medical
School Dean Philip Pizzo in an e
mail to The Daily.
CME consists of seminars and
classes for practicing physicians to
update them on advances in medi
cine. Doctors must attend CME at
regular intervals to keep their med
ical license.
The new CME program Stanford
seeks to implement bases its curricu
lum off of data on how doctors per
form. Using a wealth of data sets on
the subject, the CME team at
Stanford have found specific subject
areas where doctors at Stanford need
improvement. These subjects include
smoking cessation, preventing surgi
cal infection and reducing readmis
sion for heart failure.
Pfizer will be giving Stanford $1
million each year from 2010 through
2012.
According to Robert Jackler, the
associate dean for CME, there have
long been problems with commercial
influence on CME programs. "CME
has been corrupted by the commer
cial system," he said. "Many pro
grams that are taught are biased ...
toward a commercial project."
As Jackler explained, many class
es are taught at tourist destinations
and financed by corporate giants
with huge commercial interests in
the subjects being taught. These
influences have affected the curricu
la both overtly and indirectly.
After Stanford adopted a strict
policy of eliminating commercial
interests, the University has been
running programs without any of the
lucrative corporate funding received
by other schools.
"Since the time we adopted [our
policy] in 2008, the companies never
gave us anything, and we never even
asked," Jackler said.
Now, with the Pfizer money,
Stanford seeks to create a new evi
dence-based curriculum for CME
that redefines the programs free
from industry influence. The major
question, however, is why Pfizer
would now offer Stanford such a

large grant toward a curriculum that
does not serve any of its corporate
interests.
A Pfizer representative character
ized the move as an act of patient
service. "The grant to Stanford pro
vides the opportunity for credible,
publicly-transparent collaboration
around areas of mutual patient-cen
tric interest where it is understood
we are here to serve rather than be
served," said Pfizer Media Director
Kristen Neese.
However, Jackler put Pfizer's
decision into a larger context.
"Pfizer has been a bad actor.
They just filed a 2.3 billion-dollar
settlement with the Department of
Justice ... there's no question Pfizer
has been a sinner," he said. "[Pfizer
was] seeking to do it a different way,
and I think they were seeking a part
ner who had a reputation for doing
something with the highest ethics."
Pfizer's September settlement
with the Department of Justice cen
tered on fraudulent advertising
charges for the drug B extra, along
with other products. The charges
involved kickbacks to health care
providers in an effort to encourage
doctors to prescribe them, along
with extensive off-label marketing.
The grant to Stanford may not
offer Pfizer commercial marketing

opportunities, but as Pizzo
explained, it could help the company
improve its public image.
"Virtually every pharmaceutical
industry has served the public poor
ly with their CME programs," Pizzo
said. "And I would further add that
physicians and institutions have
been complicit as well. I have no
doubts that both need improvement
in their reputation, and I am sure
that has figured into the Pfizer deci
sion."
Jackler concurred that image
could be behind the grant, but he
also hoped that Pfizer truly took an
interest in better medical education.
"ft would not surprise me, but my
firmest hope ... is that it's not to
polish their image," he said.
Jackler said he believed that if
CME is done the right way, it can
help doctors keep up to date with
scientific breakthroughs and to learn
about the latest advances in the
medical field. He said this could, in
the end, benefit the industry as well
as patients.
"If your company has really good
products that meet those criteria,
then it will work out for you in the
end," he said.
Jackler also cited the potential
positive impact of the grant for the
University. "Three million dollars in

education is a huge grant. We can do
some really good things at Stanford
here with this," he said. "We're seek
ing to be a paradigm shift."
Pizzo is optimistic about the pro
gram, but noted that it will be moni
tored closely. "I view this as an
experiment," he said. "We will have
to see if this can be accomplished
and will be monitoring it very care
fully."
