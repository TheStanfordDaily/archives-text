## Pfizer, Inc. gives $3M to CME Pizzo: 'Pfizer will not be involved in how it's spent'

Stanford School of Medicine
recently received a $3 million grant
to eliminate corporate influence on
continuing medical education

three-year grant will go toward a new
metric-based approach to the overall
Stanford CME program and will be
distributed at Stanford's discretion,
without any input from Pfizer.
"The grant comes to us as a gift,
and Pfizer will not be involved in
how it is spent," wrote Medical
School Dean Philip Pizzo in an e
mail to The Daily.
CME consists of seminars and
classes for practicing physicians to
update them on advances in medi
cine. Doctors must attend CME at
regular intervals to keep their med
ical license.
The new CME program Stanford
seeks to implement bases its curricu

form. Using a wealth of data sets on
the subject, the CME team at
Stanford have found specific subject
areas where doctors at Stanford need
improvement. These subjects include
smoking cessation, preventing surgi
cal infection and reducing readmis
sion for heart failure.
Pfizer will be giving Stanford $1
million each year from 2010 through
2012.
According to Robert Jackler, the
associate dean for CME, there have
long been problems with commercial
