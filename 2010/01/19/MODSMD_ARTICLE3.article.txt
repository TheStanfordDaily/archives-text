# ASSU to vote on Special Fees overhaul
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Elizabeth Titus 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
is set to vote tonight on a bill that
would change the way Stanford's 50-
odd "special fees" student groups
receive funding.
Currently, student groups on the
spring special fees ballot who
secured a spot there by gathering
some 600 student signatures in their
first year requesting special fees
may ask the student body for 10 per
cent more money each year, plus
adjust for inflation.
Historically, special fees groups
are rarely voted down.
The bill would delete the 10-per
cent provision from the ASSU joint
bylaws and require special fees
groups to pick up signatures from 10
percent of the student body to
request any budget increases beyond
inflation.
Senator Alex Katz 'l2, who
authored the bill, said he is seeking to
curb rising special fees costs for indi
vidual students, which he said grew
to $ll9 this year from about $9O
three years ago.
"It's gotten very expensive, and,
especially in a time of economic
downturn, it puts a lot of pressure on
students," Katz said.
He also cited the rising special
fees "refund rate" the rate at
which students request their money
back from some or all groups after
the election as cause for the bill.
"We really need to work to bring
the refund rate back down, or the
special fee system isn't really sustain
able long-term," he said.
The bill must be approved by
two-thirds of the Undergraduate
Senate and two-thirds of the
Graduate Student Council to take
effect. The Graduate Student
Council (GSC) is set to vote
Wednesday on the issue. Katz said he
expects the Senate to pass the bill
tonight.
Student groups receiving special
fees range widely, from club sports to
student-initiated courses to Dance
Marathon to The Daily.
GSC Co-Chair Eric Osborne, a
law student, said he is sponsoring the
bill "mostly because I think it is good
fiscal policy."
"More and more students are
requesting refunds, we think,
because of the higher and higher
fees," he wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "The easiest fix is to slow the
growth of special fees by limiting
automatic increases to inflation."
The Senate meets at 7 p.m. in the
Nitery at Old Union.
