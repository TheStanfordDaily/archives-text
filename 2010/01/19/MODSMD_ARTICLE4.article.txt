## Hennessy urges export revision House Foreign Affairs Committee considering reform of export controls 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford President John Hennessy called for the
reform of U.S. export controls, citing several examples in
which beneficial research at Stanford was halted due to
government security restrictions, in testimony before the
House Foreign Affairs Committee Friday on campus at
the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
The committee chose to meet on the Farm instead of
Capitol Hill because of the relevance of the topic to the
local high-tech industry. Speaking before them,

Hennessy said Cold War era export controls were hurt
ing the nation's ability to be a leader in science and tech
nology.
Export controls were put in place so that the govern
ment could maintain control of the spread of technolo
gies important to national security. But Hennessy pointed
out that in many cases, broad export controls were stop
ping beneficial research, through citizenship require
ments and other restrictions.
"Many of the export controls regulations that served
the United States well 40 years ago no longer meet the
country's needs. The current system actually impedes our
national security and thwarts our ability to compete."
Hennessy highlighted the experience of a University
research team that was asked to collaborate with a U.S.-

based Fortune 100 high-technology
company. The team was developing a
microchip that stimulates the brain, a
technology that could be used to treat
brain disorders or build autonomous
systems. When the University learned
that export-controlled technology
was central to the project, two
Chinese national graduate students
would have had to be excluded if
work was to continue. For the faculty
member and half-dozen graduate stu
dents on the University research
team, that was a non-starter.
"Stanford does not, nor will it,
restrict participation of students
based on citizenship," Flennessy said.
In a heated exchange, Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) pressed
Flennessy on this point, saying the

example he cited was based on a
Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) grant,
and that involving Chinese nationals
in defense research was not an
option.
Flennessy responded by saying
that if a topic is so core to national
defense, then universities are not the
correct setting for such research.
Replied Rohrabacher: "I would
suggest that universities need to think
that they are patriotic Americans,
too." Fie added by saying that he
could see an Adolf Hitler-like threat
emerging from China in a decade.
The hearing, which included
Committee Chairman Howard
Berman (D- Calif.), joined by Reps.
Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif), Anna Eshoo
(D-Calif.) and Rohrabacher, indicates
that Congress is interested in over
hauling the law that authorizes the
system of licensing and controlling
technologies, last seriously revisited in
the Carter Administration. The White

House is also involved, with President
Obama ordering a review of the
nation's export control policy.
Although Rohrabacher down
played the partisan nature of debate
on the topic, a split was on display
between the Democratic push for sig
nificant export control reform and
Republican caution at loosening
export controls with non-democratic
trading partners.

In a room in the heart of liberal
Silicon Valley, sitting alongside three
House Democrats, Rohrabacher was
clearly outnumbered. Still, he made
his views clear, and expressed consid
erable concern about allowing non
democratic countries to gain access to
key technologies.
"I support export control reform, I
support streamlining the system, I
support removing barriers that ham
string U.S. companies," he said.
"However, this reform needs to
respect the fact that there are nations
that seek to do harm to our national

well-being and economic security."

Rohrabacher said he favored a
two-tiered system that opened trade
with allies, while tightly controlling
trade with non-democratic countries,
such as China, saying that even trade
with seemingly innocuous Chinese
companies was essentially sending
technology straight to the Chinese
government.
"We are dealing with a ghoulish
regime here that a lot of people are
making profit out of," he said of
China.

Friday's hearing occurred in the
shadow of Google's recent
announcement that it may withdraw
from the Chinese market.
Rohrabacher spoke glowingly of
what he saw as Google's patriotism

in making the announcement.
"I sent a letter to the president of
Google yesterday commending him
as a moral giant, as opposed to moral
pygmies at other companies," he said.
As Congress works to overhaul
the statutory framework for export
control, the tradeoff between main
taining American global competitive
ness and national security, especially
in cases of technologies of disputed or
unclear strategic value, is becoming
increasingly important.
In his testimony, Hennessy made it
clear that America's leadership role in
science and technology is under pres
sure, and that export controls are
making it more difficult to maintain a
leadership position.
"Today, the Untied States is still

the overall leader," he said. "But in
many fields, we are one of the leaders
rather than the sole leader, and in a
few fields, the United States is clearly
not at the top."
Hennessy, along with several oth
ers at the hearing, said the goal of
reform should be to continue to safe
guard security while removing unnec
essarily broad controls that hamper
beneficial research.

"Our goal should be to design
national security controls without
negatively impacting our ability to
conduct fundamental research that
can benefit the United States eco
nomically and militarily."

string U.S. companies," he said.
"However, this reform needs to
respect the fact that there are nations
that seek to do harm to our national

well-being and economic security."

Rohrabacher said he favored a
two-tiered system that opened trade
with allies, while tightly controlling
trade with non-democratic countries,
such as China, saying that even trade
with seemingly innocuous Chinese
companies was essentially sending
technology straight to the Chinese
government.
"We are dealing with a ghoulish
regime here that a lot of people are
making profit out of," he said of
China.

Friday's hearing occurred in the
shadow of Google's recent
announcement that it may withdraw
from the Chinese market.
Rohrabacher spoke glowingly of
what he saw as Google's patriotism

in making the announcement.
"I sent a letter to the president of
Google yesterday commending him
as a moral giant, as opposed to moral
pygmies at other companies," he said.
As Congress works to overhaul
the statutory framework for export
control, the tradeoff between main
taining American global competitive
ness and national security, especially
in cases of technologies of disputed or
unclear strategic value, is becoming
increasingly important.
In his testimony, Hennessy made it
clear that America's leadership role in
science and technology is under pres
sure, and that export controls are
making it more difficult to maintain a
leadership position.
"Today, the Untied States is still

the overall leader," he said. "But in
many fields, we are one of the leaders
rather than the sole leader, and in a
few fields, the United States is clearly
not at the top."
Hennessy, along with several oth
ers at the hearing, said the goal of
reform should be to continue to safe
guard security while removing unnec
essarily broad controls that hamper
beneficial research.

"Our goal should be to design
national security controls without
negatively impacting our ability to
conduct fundamental research that
can benefit the United States eco
nomically and militarily."
