# ASSU teams for Haiti aid
## FACE AIDS has raised $22K, will match donations up to $50K 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
A week after a catastrophic mag
nitude 7.0 earthquake hit the island
country of Haiti, several on-campus
groups have their fundraising
machines up and running.
Coordinating these efforts, the
ASSU Executives, in conjunction
with Partners in Health (PIH),
unveiled a nationwide college
fundraising challenge on Sunday
night in an e-mail to the student
body.
With the announcement, the
ASSU is joining the ranks of the
nonprofit FACE AIDS, Stanford's
School of Medicine, Stanford
Hospital and Clinics and Dance
Marathon in raising funds for relief
efforts.
"We thought the best way to get
the most people involved is through
a competition across the country,"
said ASSU President David
Gobaud. "We thought if we set up a
dashboard to track donations
between universities, it would moti
vate more people."
So far, seven schools, including
UC-Berkeley and Caltech, have
signed onto the ASSU-led challenge,
which will run through Wednesday.
The ASSU is also running another
challenge between dorms and resi
dences on Stanford's campus.
In total, participating universities

have raised over $40,000, including
around $lO,OOO from Stanford and
$27,000 from Dartmouth, who began
their challenge a day earlier, on
Saturday.
Temporarily, the money donated
to Stanford's campaign is being redi
rected to FACE AIDS, who
announced Saturday that they will
match dollar-for-dollar any funds
raised by chapters nationwide, up to
$50,000. The FACE AIDS amount is
being matched through a donation
from Sterling Stamos, a private
investment firm.
As of press time, FACE AIDS has
raised $22,220, much of the funds
coming from Stanford University,
according to FACE AIDS Executive
Director Julie Veroff 'O7.
Founded by Stanford students in
2005 and based in Palo Alto, FACE
AIDS has chapters in more than 200
universities and high schools across
the nation. Though their primary
focus is to fight the HIV/AIDS pan
demic in Rwanda, Veroff said the
magnitude of the crisis in Haiti
demanded action.
"We felt that as a group of young
people passionate about global
health and social issues, [the Haiti
earthquake] was something we could
not ignore," she said.
Veroff hoped that this challenge
would also be away for more young
people to become involved in global
issues. High school chapter leaders
will be holding awareness events, such
as movie screenings, in the coming
weeks.
Both the money donated to FACE
AIDS and the ASSU will go toward
PlH's Haiti earthquake relief and
reconstruction efforts.
Founded in 1987, PIH is a health
care nonprofit that operates in ten
countries and provides medical care
to poor communities. With over 20
years of experience in Haiti, PIH
operates nine hospitals in the country,
along with a triage center recently set
up for earthquake victims.
Also working with the ASSU is
Dance Marathon, the annual Stanford
fundraiser that donates the majority
of its proceeds to PlH's efforts in
Rwanda. In light of the earthquake,
the Dance Marathon coordinators
have removed earmarks from the
event this year, allowing PIH to utilize
funds wherever needs are most press
ing.
"We spoke with Partners In Health
and our first reaction was, 'Let's
change beneficiaries completely' and
give 100 percent of what we get to
Haiti, but PIH asked us specifically
not to do that," said Dance Marathon
Campus Director Bill Loundy 'lO.
Dance Marathon gives a reliable sum
of money every year to Rwanda, and
PIH wanted to maintain that, accord
ing to Loundy.
In an e-mail to Dance Marathon
participants, however, he said PIH will
most likely still use the Dance
Marathon donations in Rwanda.
"We've encouraged those who
want to give directly to Haiti in a time
sensitive way to go through the
ASSU," he said.
Other groups helping the ASSU
with outreach efforts include the
Caribbean Students Association
(CSA) and the Student Red Cross.
Stanford School of Medicine,
Department of Medicine and
Stanford Hospital and Clinics is run
ning a separate fundraising effort,
announced Thursday, Jan. 14. The
Hospital will match up to $25,000,
with funds going to the Hopital Albert
Schweitzer (HAS) in the Haitian cap
ital Port-au-Prince.
Individuals have also been moti

vated to raise funds on their own.
Timothy Tam 'l2, a member of the
Stanford cycling team, is also offering
to fix students' bikes for $5 to $lO,
with proceeds going to the U.S. Fund
for UNICEF.
Donating money remains the best
way for people to provide assistance
to Haiti earthquake victims, said
Patricia Arty 'lO, who has family in
Haiti. Arty is the development direc
tor for FACE AIDS and the public
relations executive for Dance
Marathon.
"What I've heard from my rela
tives is if people could just donate one
to two dollars anything you have
â€”it is a huge help, especially in
Haiti," she said. "A hot meal in Haiti
costs 25 cents U.S.
"It's still a stressful situation. Our
country has to think about rebuilding
all over again," she added.
Donations through the ASSU Web
site can be made at
assu.stanford.edu/haiti. Funds for
HAS should be donated through
hashaiti.org/Cla_wl.html, marking
'Stanford University School of
Medicine' as the matching organiza
tion. Contact Tam for bike repairs at
