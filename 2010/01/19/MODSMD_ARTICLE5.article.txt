A week after a catastrophic mag
nitude 7.0 earthquake hit the island
country of Haiti, several on-campus
groups have their fundraising
machines up and running.
Coordinating these efforts, the
ASSU Executives, in conjunction
with Partners in Health (PIH),
unveiled a nationwide college
fundraising challenge on Sunday
night in an e-mail to the student
body.
With the announcement, the
ASSU is joining the ranks of the
nonprofit FACE AIDS, Stanford's
School of Medicine, Stanford
Hospital and Clinics and Dance
Marathon in raising funds for relief
efforts.
"We thought the best way to get
the most people involved is through
a competition across the country,"
said ASSU President David
Gobaud. "We thought if we set up a
dashboard to track donations
between universities, it would moti
vate more people."
So far, seven schools, including
UC-Berkeley and Caltech, have
signed onto the ASSU-led challenge,
which will run through Wednesday.
The ASSU is also running another
challenge between dorms and resi
dences on Stanford's campus.
In total, participating universities

have raised over $40,000, including
around $lO,OOO from Stanford and
$27,000 from Dartmouth, who began
their challenge a day earlier, on
Saturday.
Temporarily, the money donated
to Stanford's campaign is being redi
rected to FACE AIDS, who
announced Saturday that they will
match dollar-for-dollar any funds
raised by chapters nationwide, up to
$50,000. The FACE AIDS amount is
being matched through a donation
from Sterling Stamos, a private
investment firm.
As of press time, FACE AIDS has
raised $22,220, much of the funds
coming from Stanford University,
according to FACE AIDS Executive
Director Julie Veroff 'O7.
Founded by Stanford students in
2005 and based in Palo Alto, FACE
AIDS has chapters in more than 200
universities and high schools across
the nation. Though their primary
focus is to fight the HIV/AIDS pan
demic in Rwanda, Veroff said the
magnitude of the crisis in Haiti
demanded action.
"We felt that as a group of young
people passionate about global
health and social issues, [the Haiti
earthquake] was something we could
not ignore," she said.
Veroff hoped that this challenge
would also be away for more young
