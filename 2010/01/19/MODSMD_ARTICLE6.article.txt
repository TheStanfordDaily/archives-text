# STILL PAC-PERFECT
## Cardinal downs Huskies, remains atop conference 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It may not have been their prettiest game, but
the No. 2 Cardinal came away with its sixth straight
win Saturday afternoon after beating the
Washington Huskies 66-51 at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike led both
teams with 20 points and 13 rebounds, but at times
struggled with the rest of the Stanford squad to
find good shots, control the ball and contest
Washington's offense.

GAME NOTES: After sweeping the Washington schools at
home, No. 2/2 Stanford looks to continue its perfect
conference record as it travels north to take on the
Beavers. Oregon State had a stellar start to year, finishing
the non-conference season at 8-2. They've struggled in
Pac-10 play, however, not having won since their confer
ence opener against Washington State.

"It wasn't exactly what I wanted to see," said
Stanford Head Coach Tara VanDerveer to open the
post-game conference. "I just thought it was a dis
appointing effort compared to my expectations for
how I want our team to play. [... ]We weren't
moving the ball the way we wanted to; we weren't
aggressive on defense [or] going after loose balls. It
just felt less than inspired. [... ] Overall, I think it
points to [the fact that] we have a lot of work to do."


The game opened at an unchar
acteristically fast pace, with both
teams taking a lot of shots and near
ly every rebound going to the de
fense. The Huskies (8-8, 3-3) hung
tough until Kayla Pederson sunk her
second three-pointer at 13:25 to
make it 16-8. While both teams
showed less energy as the period
wore on, Stanford (15-1,5-0 Pac-10)
managed to buffer its lead to 35-21
before heading to the locker room.
As the second half began, so did
Stanford's more serious troubles.
Reigning Pac-10 player of the Year
Jayne Appel committed her third
foul of the game barely 90 seconds in
and was replaced by freshman
Joslyn Tinkle. Appel would finish
the game with only six shots. Her
teammates, meanwhile, couldn't
find the basket until Ogwumike's
left-handed lay-up at 17:09, extend
ing the at-times fragile lead to 37-28.
The Huskies continued to press,
keeping it as close as 50-42 with 7:55
remaining.
While many of Stanford's strug
gles against the Huskies were more
subjective a coach has the right to
expect more energy from one of last
year's Final Four teams the
game's final stats also suggest that
the Cardinal may not have been fir
ing on all cylinders.
The Cardinal gave up 17
turnovers to the Huskies and man
aged to grab 11 offensive rebounds
(a relatively low total, considering
that Washington primarily used a
zone defense and that the Cardinal
had 20 the last time they hosted the
Huskies). Going back to the begin
ning of last season, Stanford hasn't
scored less than 66 points in any
home game save one: a 58-41 win
last February over then-No. 3 Cali
fornia. The 15-point margin of vic
tory is tied for being their smallest
of the year at home, matching that
of a 67-52 win over another former
No. 3 team, Tennessee. The last time
the Cardinal hosted the Huskies,
they ran them out of the building
with a school and conference
record 112-35 scoring margin.
It might seem odd to fault a team
while they're winning, but Cardinal,
seeking to earn its first National
Championship after nine consecu
tive Pac-10 titles, has recently strug

gled to meet the admittedly high ex
pectations of players, coaches and
fans.
"Today's game was definitely
uninspired," admitted redshirt sen
ior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. "I think
there's been a string of games now
where we've won because we're
maybe bigger or more talented, not
because we're playing a more in
spired game to win and I think we
need to pick it up. I wouldn't pick
out just this one game as an anomaly
I think it's a string."
While the high standards for a
team of Stanford's caliber merit
some criticism after such a per
formance, the Cardinal still played
plenty of good basketball to come
away with a victory. Stanford out
shot the Huskies 47.1% to 30.6%,
outboarded them 44 to 31, made 18
assists compared to the Huskies'
eight and stole the ball nine times
compared to Washington's six.
"Obviously we had to do some
good things to win the game," Van-
Derveer said. "I thought we had
some good plays. Nneka got inside
and made some good plays."

Washington, meanwhile, had a
few unusual troubles of its own. The
Huskies got off to an impressive
start, sweeping a talented pair of
Arizona teams two weeks ago to
earn a record of 8-6, 3-1. Highlight
ing the Huskie season is senior Sami
Whitcomb, who (entering Satur
day's game) led her team with 14.0
points-per-game and 6.0 rebounds
per-game.
Some of the Cardinal's struggles
may have simply been caused by ab
sent players. Both scratched from
the game were point guard JJ Hones
(with a swollen knee) and guard
Jeanette Pohlen. It was the first time
in 53 games that Pohlen, who injured
her ankle against Washington State
on Thursday, was out of the starting
lineup and her first time missing a
game altogether in the Cardinal's
last 92. Sophomore Lindy La
Rocque started in her place.
"With Jeanette, I'm not counting
on her [to be ready next week]," said
VanDerveer. "JJ probably could've
played tonight if it was an NCAA
game or something, but she's just
trying to rest her knee more until it's

better."
Although it's never good to have
several experienced players injured
or struggling, there are certain
bright sides to the Cardinal's current
situation.
"Until [everyone's healthy and
playing well], I think this is an excel
lent opportunity," Gold-Onwude
said. "I think there's a lot of players
who had 20 points and 10 assists and
all that in high school â€”young
players with an opportunity to really
show themselves. I think we just
have to embrace the challenge."
One such player, at least on Sat
urday, was Joslyn Tinkle. The Mis
soula, Montana freshman posted
two three-pointers and a steal, scor
ing eight points in only 17 minutes.
The Cardinal will take to the
court again this Thursday, when it
travels north to face Oregon State at
7 p.m. After battling the Beavers,
Stanford will take on their counter
part at Oregon University, the
Ducks, on Saturday at 11 a.m.

ly every rebound going to the de
fense. The Huskies (8-8, 3-3) hung
tough until Kayla Pederson sunk her
second three-pointer at 13:25 to
make it 16-8. While both teams
showed less energy as the period
wore on, Stanford (15-1,5-0 Pac-10)
managed to buffer its lead to 35-21
before heading to the locker room.
As the second half began, so did
Stanford's more serious troubles.
Reigning Pac-10 player of the Year
Jayne Appel committed her third
foul of the game barely 90 seconds in
and was replaced by freshman
Joslyn Tinkle. Appel would finish
the game with only six shots. Her
teammates, meanwhile, couldn't
find the basket until Ogwumike's
left-handed lay-up at 17:09, extend
ing the at-times fragile lead to 37-28.
The Huskies continued to press,
keeping it as close as 50-42 with 7:55
remaining.
While many of Stanford's strug
gles against the Huskies were more
subjective a coach has the right to
expect more energy from one of last
year's Final Four teams the
game's final stats also suggest that
the Cardinal may not have been fir
ing on all cylinders.
The Cardinal gave up 17
turnovers to the Huskies and man
aged to grab 11 offensive rebounds
(a relatively low total, considering
that Washington primarily used a
zone defense and that the Cardinal
had 20 the last time they hosted the
Huskies). Going back to the begin
ning of last season, Stanford hasn't
scored less than 66 points in any
home game save one: a 58-41 win
last February over then-No. 3 Cali
fornia. The 15-point margin of vic
tory is tied for being their smallest
of the year at home, matching that
of a 67-52 win over another former
No. 3 team, Tennessee. The last time
the Cardinal hosted the Huskies,
they ran them out of the building
with a school and conference
record 112-35 scoring margin.
It might seem odd to fault a team
while they're winning, but Cardinal,
seeking to earn its first National
Championship after nine consecu
tive Pac-10 titles, has recently strug

gled to meet the admittedly high ex
pectations of players, coaches and
fans.
"Today's game was definitely
uninspired," admitted redshirt sen
ior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. "I think
there's been a string of games now
where we've won because we're
maybe bigger or more talented, not
because we're playing a more in
spired game to win and I think we
need to pick it up. I wouldn't pick
out just this one game as an anomaly
I think it's a string."
While the high standards for a
team of Stanford's caliber merit
some criticism after such a per
formance, the Cardinal still played
plenty of good basketball to come
away with a victory. Stanford out
shot the Huskies 47.1% to 30.6%,
outboarded them 44 to 31, made 18
assists compared to the Huskies'
eight and stole the ball nine times
compared to Washington's six.
"Obviously we had to do some
good things to win the game," Van-
Derveer said. "I thought we had
some good plays. Nneka got inside
and made some good plays."

Washington, meanwhile, had a
few unusual troubles of its own. The
Huskies got off to an impressive
start, sweeping a talented pair of
Arizona teams two weeks ago to
earn a record of 8-6, 3-1. Highlight
ing the Huskie season is senior Sami
Whitcomb, who (entering Satur
day's game) led her team with 14.0
points-per-game and 6.0 rebounds
per-game.
Some of the Cardinal's struggles
may have simply been caused by ab
sent players. Both scratched from
the game were point guard JJ Hones
(with a swollen knee) and guard
Jeanette Pohlen. It was the first time
in 53 games that Pohlen, who injured
her ankle against Washington State
on Thursday, was out of the starting
lineup and her first time missing a
game altogether in the Cardinal's
last 92. Sophomore Lindy La
Rocque started in her place.
"With Jeanette, I'm not counting
on her [to be ready next week]," said
VanDerveer. "JJ probably could've
played tonight if it was an NCAA
game or something, but she's just
trying to rest her knee more until it's

better."
Although it's never good to have
several experienced players injured
or struggling, there are certain
bright sides to the Cardinal's current
situation.
"Until [everyone's healthy and
playing well], I think this is an excel
lent opportunity," Gold-Onwude
said. "I think there's a lot of players
who had 20 points and 10 assists and
all that in high school â€”young
players with an opportunity to really
show themselves. I think we just
have to embrace the challenge."
One such player, at least on Sat
urday, was Joslyn Tinkle. The Mis
soula, Montana freshman posted
two three-pointers and a steal, scor
ing eight points in only 17 minutes.
The Cardinal will take to the
court again this Thursday, when it
travels north to face Oregon State at
7 p.m. After battling the Beavers,
Stanford will take on their counter
part at Oregon University, the
Ducks, on Saturday at 11 a.m.

It may not have been their prettiest game, but
the No. 2 Cardinal came away with its sixth straight
win Saturday afternoon after beating the
Washington Huskies 66-51 at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike led both
teams with 20 points and 13 rebounds, but at times
struggled with the rest of the Stanford squad to
find good shots, control the ball and contest
Washington's offense.

GAME NOTES: After sweeping the Washington schools at
home, No. 2/2 Stanford looks to continue its perfect
conference record as it travels north to take on the
Beavers. Oregon State had a stellar start to year, finishing
the non-conference season at 8-2. They've struggled in
Pac-10 play, however, not having won since their confer
ence opener against Washington State.

"It wasn't exactly what I wanted to see," said
Stanford Head Coach Tara VanDerveer to open the
post-game conference. "I just thought it was a dis
appointing effort compared to my expectations for
how I want our team to play. [... ]We weren't
moving the ball the way we wanted to; we weren't
aggressive on defense [or] going after loose balls. It
just felt less than inspired. [... ] Overall, I think it
points to [the fact that] we have a lot of work to do."
