# STILL PAC-PERFECT
## Cardinal downs Huskies, remains atop conference 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It may not have been their prettiest game, but
the No. 2 Cardinal came away with its sixth straight
win Saturday afternoon after beating the
Washington Huskies 66-51 at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike led both
teams with 20 points and 13 rebounds, but at times
struggled with the rest of the Stanford squad to
find good shots, control the ball and contest
Washington's offense.

GAME NOTES: After sweeping the Washington schools at
home, No. 2/2 Stanford looks to continue its perfect
conference record as it travels north to take on the
Beavers. Oregon State had a stellar start to year, finishing
the non-conference season at 8-2. They've struggled in
Pac-10 play, however, not having won since their confer
ence opener against Washington State.

"It wasn't exactly what I wanted to see," said
Stanford Head Coach Tara VanDerveer to open the
post-game conference. "I just thought it was a dis
appointing effort compared to my expectations for
how I want our team to play. [... ]We weren't
moving the ball the way we wanted to; we weren't
aggressive on defense [or] going after loose balls. It
just felt less than inspired. [... ] Overall, I think it
points to [the fact that] we have a lot of work to do."
