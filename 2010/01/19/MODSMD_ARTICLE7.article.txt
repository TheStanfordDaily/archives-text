# STUDENT GROUPS
## Groups gather for Haiti Focus 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
About 30 Stanford students, administrators and staff
gathered in the Black Community Services Center
(BCSC) on Friday for the first Caribbean Student
Association (CSA) Haiti Focus Group.
The Focus Group was a brainstorming session on
how to best organize relief efforts within the Stanford
community and Silicon Valley area, but also to provide
support for students who were personally affected by
the disaster. Many of the students present were Haitian
or had family living in Haiti.
"I'm from Puerto Rico, and I've been seeing this
image and thinking, 'This could have been my island,"'
said Gabriela Spencer 'll, who led the CSA event.
"This is very relevant to Stanford students because it
could have been the Bay Area it's hard for students
to see that."
Leaders from all corners of the Stanford campus,
including representatives from FACE AIDS, Sigma
Gamma Rho, the HAAS Center, administrators, the
Stanford News Service and Stanford Libraries, also
attended the event.
"CSA doesn't have the answers," Spencer said. "But
we're here to get ideas."
Attendees gathered in a large circle and soon
learned that many students had very personal connec
tions to the disaster.
"I have family who are displaced," said Faradia
Pierre 'l2, a first generation Haitian American. "Some
of their homes are still standing, but they're afraid to go
in because they might collapse. Right now a lot of peo
ple are living outside of their homes on the street."
The event concentrated on developing strategies to
move forward. Attendees pitched ideas for raising
funds and providing aid.
Some of the ideas included putting on a benefit con
cert with a recommended donation, setting up collec
tion boxes similar to those used by UNICEF in student
dorms, donating meals through the Stanford meal plan
and finding companies in Silicon Valley to match
Stanford donations.
"People need daily necessities right now," Pierre
said. "Everything about daily life is
completely destroyed. Schools are
destroyed; students are not going to
school."
Other ideas included an internship
or abroad program specifically targeted
to reconstruction in Haiti, a campus
wide collection of clothing, goods and
baby supplies, creating a Haitian exhib
it in Old Union and showing a Haitian
documentary at Aquarius Theater in
Palo Alto to raise awareness.
One theme of the event was to think
beyond the fiscal resources at Stanford.
"It's important to think about the
capital at Stanford," said Jan Barker-
Alexander, director of BCSC. "But
there is something else to think about
in terms of what Stanford has to offer,
which is intellectual capital."

Alexander offered Harvard and
MIT as examples of educational com
munities that have succeeded in bring

ing intellectual resources to previous
disaster areas, particularly the involve
ment of their architecture and policy
programs in New Orleans.
"We are the future future policy
makers and doctors," Pierre said. "With
our successes, we are benefitting other
people in the end."
Many branches from around the
Stanford campus are launching their
own projects in response to the crisis.
According to Sally Dickson, associ
ate vice provost for student affairs, stu
dents at the Stanford Law School are
collaborating on a Haitian immigration
project.
Stanford alums have also mobilized
to address the crisis. Luke Beckman 'O9
and Josh Nesbit 'O9, currently stationed
in Haiti, have been working in the tech
nology and strategic planning division
of Innovative Support to Emergencies,
Diseases and Disasters (InSTEDD), an
international, non-profit humanitarian
organization, to facilitate the organiza
tion of aid and reconstruction on the

ground.
As a national response liaison,
Beckman has been coordinating efforts

between the U.S. State Department, the
U.S. Military, the Haitian government,
mapping agencies, technology compa
nies, the United Nations and other
NGOs.
"My job is to support all of these dif
ferent networks by keeping everyone
in the loop," he said.
Beckman's team is currently work
ing on creating a texting hotline, a
"shortcut" for Haitians so they can
report problems and communicate
with a network of thousands of volun
teers.
"We had a big win yesterday," he
said. "The top five Haitian officials did
n't have phones, and President Obama
wanted to talk to them... through col
laboration, we got phones to them and
now they're on the phone with
President Obama," he said.
Conditions for Beckman's team
have been nothing short of difficult.
The island lacks enough water, security
and most imaginable resources.
"If you can imagine it, it's probably
an issue," he said.

"Most of us on the team have had
four hours of sleep in two days," he

added. "We're running on adrenaline
now."
Beckman specifically noted the
country's lack of infrastructure as a
major setback to administering aid.The
airstrip in the capital of Port-au-Prince
was destroyed, and most roads are not
navigable, which can make it impossi
ble to transport people and supplies.
"Seventy percent of the buildings in
Port-au-Prince have been destroyed,"
he said. "And thousands of people were
in those buildings or under them."
Although Beckman thinks that
chaos will prevail in Haiti for the time
being, he is hopeful for the gains to be
made during reconstruction. Missing
person databases have been created,
new medical centers are being formed
and sources have collaborated in shar
ing map imagery.
"The Haitians I know personally
have suffered under a lot of things for a
lot of time," he said. "And they're still
here, and they're still kicking. Theyre a
resilient culture."

"My job is to support all of these dif
ferent networks by keeping everyone
in the loop," he said.
Beckman's team is currently work
ing on creating a texting hotline, a
"shortcut" for Haitians so they can
report problems and communicate
with a network of thousands of volun
teers.
"We had a big win yesterday," he
said. "The top five Haitian officials did
n't have phones, and President Obama
wanted to talk to them... through col
laboration, we got phones to them and
now they're on the phone with
President Obama," he said.
Conditions for Beckman's team
have been nothing short of difficult.
The island lacks enough water, security
and most imaginable resources.
"If you can imagine it, it's probably
an issue," he said.

"Most of us on the team have had
four hours of sleep in two days," he

added. "We're running on adrenaline
now."
Beckman specifically noted the
country's lack of infrastructure as a
major setback to administering aid.The
airstrip in the capital of Port-au-Prince
was destroyed, and most roads are not
navigable, which can make it impossi
ble to transport people and supplies.
"Seventy percent of the buildings in
Port-au-Prince have been destroyed,"
he said. "And thousands of people were
in those buildings or under them."
Although Beckman thinks that
chaos will prevail in Haiti for the time
being, he is hopeful for the gains to be
made during reconstruction. Missing
person databases have been created,
new medical centers are being formed
and sources have collaborated in shar
ing map imagery.
"The Haitians I know personally
have suffered under a lot of things for a
lot of time," he said. "And they're still
here, and they're still kicking. Theyre a
resilient culture."
