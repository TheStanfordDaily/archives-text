### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
About 30 Stanford students, administrators and staff
gathered in the Black Community Services Center
(BCSC) on Friday for the first Caribbean Student
Association (CSA) Haiti Focus Group.
The Focus Group was a brainstorming session on
how to best organize relief efforts within the Stanford
community and Silicon Valley area, but also to provide
support for students who were personally affected by
the disaster. Many of the students present were Haitian
or had family living in Haiti.
"I'm from Puerto Rico, and I've been seeing this
image and thinking, 'This could have been my island,"'
said Gabriela Spencer 'll, who led the CSA event.
"This is very relevant to Stanford students because it
could have been the Bay Area it's hard for students
to see that."
Leaders from all corners of the Stanford campus,
including representatives from FACE AIDS, Sigma
Gamma Rho, the HAAS Center, administrators, the
Stanford News Service and Stanford Libraries, also
attended the event.
"CSA doesn't have the answers," Spencer said. "But
we're here to get ideas."
Attendees gathered in a large circle and soon
learned that many students had very personal connec
tions to the disaster.
"I have family who are displaced," said Faradia
Pierre 'l2, a first generation Haitian American. "Some
of their homes are still standing, but they're afraid to go
in because they might collapse. Right now a lot of peo
ple are living outside of their homes on the street."
The event concentrated on developing strategies to
move forward. Attendees pitched ideas for raising
funds and providing aid.
Some of the ideas included putting on a benefit con
cert with a recommended donation, setting up collec
tion boxes similar to those used by UNICEF in student
dorms, donating meals through the Stanford meal plan
and finding companies in Silicon Valley to match
Stanford donations.
"People need daily necessities right now," Pierre
