## SKIING, GRACEFULLY By ANNA FRENCH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
### 
( -w-f you fall asleep, you're going to wake up on
I the side of the freeway," yells the upperclass-
I man driver at the helm of a standard-issue
I rental minivan to the groggy passenger sitting
shotgun in the last car out to Tahoe on Friday
night.
After a failed attempt at getting her passengers to sing
"99 bottles of beer on the wall" through to the end, the driv
er, her eyes drooping, now wishes that she could have back
the same cracked out group of students from three hours
prior the ones who wouldn't stop scanning the radio sta
tions looking for "Tick Tock," "Bad Romance" and "Party
in the USA," screaming with joy and belting out the tune
every time they were successful.
After battling MLK weekend traffic out of the Bay Area
and braving a long and winding ascent through Eldorado
National Forest, the seven students in the car wake up to
the shimmering lights of South Lake Tahoe.
"Whoaaaa... I'm really glad we're seeing this view at
night, otherwise I would be freaking out," exclaims the driv
er, appreciating the extra illusion of safety from the
canyon's depths provided by the wall of accumulated
plowed snow.
By the time the late van reaches the log mansion's blaz
ing lights, the annual scramble for beds has already been
complete and all that remains are empty spots on the shag
carpet, colored a puke-friendly orange and brown.
One slightly tipsy junior, clearly having enjoyed activi

ties that severely impaired his rhyming abilities, teases a
late-comer.
Robby Dobby was a bear, Robby Dobby... doesn't
get-a-bed-because-he-came-late!"
Luckily, the four-hour drive leaves the late passengers
tired and impervious to the cacophony of snoring in the
bunk bed room, for the few precious hours of sleep before
the 7 a.m. wakeup call for skiing.
"Hey, wanna go sledding so you can bruise your crotch
again like last year?" announces a sophomore, remember
ing the sight of her friend wrapped around the trunk of a
pine after plowing down a small hill in the backyard.
A large contingent of non-skiers keeps themselves
entertained at the house on Saturday. They knit and destroy
the kitchen, making meat smoothies and sriracha pancakes.
They sled down hills on cookie sheets and trash can lids and
realize that trying to catch a fish with your bare hands leads
to accidentally becoming a member of the Lake Tahoe
polar bear club.
And a studious few make productivity nests in the soli
tude of the master bedroom closet to complete enough
homework before the Saturday night festivities.
The skiers had headed out much earlier, awoken by var
ious tactics like getting slapped in the face with a hot waffle,
having whoopee cushion expelled into their ears and feel
ing the cold tip of a permanent pen dancing across their
foreheads.
"Even my wallet clenched its butt cheeks when I heard
the price of the lift ticket... but SO worth it," says one
sophomore on her second ski trip, as the skiers and snow
boarders of various levels of skill and coordination, pockets

stuffed with chewy bars, wait to be manhandled by the gon
dola ushers at Heavenly.
"OMG I FREAKING HATE LITTLE KIDS,"
declares one frustrated junior, sliding on his butt down the
bunny slope as a six-year-old skier zoomed past, spraying a
wave of snow in his face with a laugh.
Fortunately he has it better than his friend, who made
the mistake of accepting his Swedish dorm mate's offer to
teach her to ski. After only a two-minute lesson on the
bunny slope, she finds herself jerking down the moguls on a
black run as his dorm mate zig-zags around her yelling
encouragement.
Another friend becomes intimate with the California-
Nevada border, temporarily giving her yet another bright
red waffle pattern on her cheek.
The most unfortunate group causes the lift-to-skyline
trail to halt for several minutes after one of the snowboard
ers exits the lift diagonally, epically tripping all three of his
riding mates. As the skiers in the group groan and collect
the roughly 5,000 different pieces of disassembled ski
equipment, the crowd around the gondola gives them a
round of applause for their fail-rific performance.
Back at the cabins, the party has begun.
"OMG WAIT, bears can't smell beer... CAN
THEY???" says one not-so-sober ski tripper. "Because the
sign on the fridge says not to leave food outside because of
animals... LIKE BEARS."
"Yeah well, the sign above the toilet says to practice your
aim, but you threw that one right out the window, didn't
you?"
The Saturday night shenanigans really take off at 10

Students hit the slopes, become
inebriated, play thumb war during
weekend snow trips

p.m., when one staff member fulfills his promise to jump
shirtless off the second floor balcony onto the living room
couch from a dizzying height of eight feet.
The party is in the basement this time, in light of the
recent crackdown on over-packed houses at Lake Tahoe.
The basement is an unholy union of Karaoke, "shot"-tar
hero and extremely heated thumb wars. Outside, one group
is learning the thriftiness of drinking at altitude in a hot tub.
They stuff more and more people in until they realize the
drain off was sliding down the roof and freezing on the
hood of the vans.
Others were having their first drinking experience:
Joe: "Did Jerry have half a beer again?"
Jerry: (hiccups) "No, I had a WHOLE one!"
One by one the partiers nod off, until a small group of
boys remain playing a game of pool. The game degenerates
into a storytelling session about hunting wild pigs, which
degenerates an imitation of wild pig and bird noises. A
sophomore girl, half asleep, tosses her slipper at one of the
boys' outstretched buttocks, sending the boys into a frenzy
of laughter that puts them to sleep.
In the morning the zombies scrounge for the remnants
of bread crusts, a five-pound bag of M&Ms and the bruised
fruit that remains in the once-abundant cabinets. The staff
members breathe a sigh of relief as the vans depart from the
house, where they hope the landlord won't notice the pair
of superhero underwear lodged in the drain of the Jacuzzi.
The late van driver cranks up the radio as the chorus of
Lady Gaga plays, thematically beginning the trip home.
