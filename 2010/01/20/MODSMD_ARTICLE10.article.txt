"I was told if I went out, I would be shot by
snipers."
This was the threat New York Times Iran cor
respondent Nazila Fathi recounted Tuesday
night to a Stanford audience a threat she
received before her exile from on-scene report
ing in Iran.
Fathi spoke to a captivated audience at Pigott
Hall as part of the Iranian Studies Lecture Series,
and students and Palo Alto residents quizzed her
on the challenges of journalism amid violent
protest as well as the future of Iran's relations
with the United States.
Before beginning regular work with The New
York Times, Fathi worked her way up the ladder,
stringing stories without a press pass because she
was too young and a woman.
Working in Iran, Fathi made the kind of name
for herself that got her blacklisted by the local
government, and she was forced to move to
Canada after the government crackdown on
press following the June elections. Today, she
continues to report on Iranian politics for The
Times.

"I was absolutely devastated when I was leav
ing " she said.
Although initially concerned that exile would
remove her entirely from earshot of the sweep
ing protests that followed June's contested re
election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
Fathi described her surprise when she discovered
the overwhelming network of exiled activists and
Iranian bloggers abroad.
"People were much more willing to share the
nation," Fathi said.
People on the ground in Iran helped Fathi
continue reporting from miles away. Many
Iranians went out of their way to phone Fathi in
Toronto. Self-appointed journalists acted as "sol
diers armed with their own weapons," she said,
capturing critical photos and camera footage.
Fathi plugged into the heart of Iran's struggle
through the Internet and phone calls. The well
captured videos and photographs streamed
online by locals over live-feed blogs almost made
distance immaterial to her reports, she said.
Fathi sought to highlight the fearlessness of
many Iranian women, who she said have pio
neered peaceful, silent protests.
"Three decades of suppression against
women made these women very brave," Fathi
said. According to the journalist, men and
women alike were fed up with government con
trol. Older women became self-proclaimed
