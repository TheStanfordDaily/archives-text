## Rain, power outage storm through 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford experienced a two-hour
power outage on campus Tuesday
morning, and University officials told
residents to prepare for storms and
potential emergencies throughout the
rainy week.
ALERTSU, the campus's emer
gency notification system, sent auto
mated e-mails, text messages and
phone calls to community members
at about 8:15 a.m. Tuesday to report
the power outage. Morning classes
were to be held at the discretion of
instructors, according to the alert.
Many campus stores, libraries and
buildings did not open for business at
their normal time. Card access to
some residences was also reportedly
hindered, according to e-mails from
Student Housing.
Power was restored around 10
a.m.
Meanwhile, Housing asked cam
pus residents to prepare for "extreme
weather" throughout the week. Staff
recommended in an e-mail that stu
dents keep flashlights, blankets, food
and "alternative means of receiving
timely information, such as a battery
operated radio" ready.
Residences with card-access entry
systems have a four-hour battery
backup, according to Housing; after
four hours, entering the building
would require help from someone
inside.
Rain remains expected at least
through Friday, with a high wind
watch issued for the Stanford area as
early as Wednesday morning.
