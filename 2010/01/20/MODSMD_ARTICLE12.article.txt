## Alum leads Board of Supervisors 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors this month elected
Stanford alumnus Ken Yeager Ph.D.
'9l as its president.
Yeager will replace Liz Kniss as
president. He has served on the Board
of Supervisors for the past three years,
most recently as vice president.
Reflecting on his time as a board
member, Yeager cited allocating
money for disease prevention and
focusing on environmental issues as
his main accomplishments.
"The county has been much more
active in reducing its carbon foot
print," Yeager said. "These are issues
that I'm going to continue to work on

as president."
As he continues to put more effort
into these issues, Yeager will take on
added responsibilities with his promo
tion. His new obligations include pre
siding over board meetings, serving as
the point person and performing cere
monial functions for the county.
Looking at the year ahead,
Yeager's goals include improving the
public health department.
"I want to put more money into
safety net programs, particularly drug.
.. alcohol and mental health pro
grams," Yeager said.
However, a reduced budget and
decreased state and federal funding
for local programs present major chal
lenges for accomplishing these goals.

Yeager will also
play a hand in the
question of whether

Stanford should be exempt from the
Santa Clara County social host drink
ing ordinance permanently or on an
annual basis. Santa Clara County offi
cials are set to re-examine Stanford's
exemption at the end of this month.
"I think Stanford has been doing a
great job with its program," Yeager
said. "I don't know what the Board
might do, but I certainly believe that
Stanford should continue to be
exempted."
Yeager, 57, lives in San Jose and
holds an M.A. in sociology and a Ph.D.
