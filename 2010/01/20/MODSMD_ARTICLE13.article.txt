## Aid takes center stage in annual education report 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
Student groups aren't the only
ones writing Stanford Fund letters
to generous alumni Vice Provost
John Bravman and the Office of
Development do it every year in the
form of the Annual Report on
Undergraduate Education.
The report separate from the
University's Annual Report, which
is created out of the University com
munications department tells
donors where their money went
when they cut a check to the
University and provides an opportu
nity to highlight areas where
Stanford would like to invest more
money into the undergraduate expe
rience.
Despite a year of financial belt
tightening, everything about the
2008-2009 Annual Report on
Undergraduate Education centers
around the new, from the hire of an
Earth Systems field program coordi
nator, to a profile of Stanford's Arts
Intensive summer program, to the
just-renovated student residences at
Crothers. Even the format of the
Annual Report itself now a
"green" 30-page interactive online
viewbook is a departure from
past years of a paper-based publica
tion.
The yearly report a joint effort
by the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education (VPUE)
and the Office of Development
provides donors with a snapshot of
key undergraduate programs
crucially, through the lens of dona
tions to The Stanford Fund. It reads
like a brochure for prospective stu
dents underscoring a myriad of
must-have undergraduate offerings
but with one caveat: If you like
these programs, you (the donors)
must pay for them.
Rebecca Smith Vogel, senior
director of marketing and communi
cations at the Office of
Development, said the
Undergraduate Education report is
not so much a fundraising strategy
as it is a donor update, but the
University does highlight some
major initiatives and priorities in the
report's pages.
"In determining which programs
to feature in the annual report, we
look at allocations that received the
most money, and we also try to vary
the programs we feature so that
donors who are receiving the annual
report year after year are getting an
opportunity to read about different
aspects of the undergraduate experi
ence," wrote Vogel in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Whereas one year we might focus
on the arts, another year we might
have more stories that feature work
in the sciences or engineering,"
Vogel said. "We do try to have some
thing that would interest everyone,
so we are aiming to showcase a vari
ety of programs and students in any
given report."
In mid-December 2009, the
Office of Development sent an e
mail to 82,000 undergrad alumni,
parents of current students and past
donors to inform them about the
2008-2009 Annual Report on
Undergraduate Education.
The 2008-2009 report highlighted

three main areas where the
University wanted to direct its alum
ni donations: need-based financial
aid, the academic experience and
student life. Eighty-two percent of
The Stanford Fund dollars were
allocated to undergraduate financial
aid, 11 percent went to academic
experience and seven percent went
to student life.
Financial Aid
Financial aid, one of President
John Hennessy's highest priorities,
moved to the forefront of the out
reach message.
"We have stood by our Financial
Aid commitment by using other
institutional sources of funding such
as The Stanford Fund (annual gift
funds) more heavily than we would
have if the endowment funds were
available," Karen Cooper, director
of financial aid, told The Daily in
November.
After a 27 percent decline in the
University's endowment, 82 percent
of the Stanford Fund was ear
marked for Financial Aid in 2008-
2009 to fill the widening gap. In typ
ical years, about half of The Stanford
Fund goes toward financial aid. For
2009-2010, the University projects
that 75 percent of The Stanford
Fund 15 million will go toward
Financial Aid. Currently, 49 percent
of undergraduates receive need
based financial aid.
The 2008-2009 Annual Report on
Undergraduate Education aimed to
personalize the financial aid mes
sage by profiling videos of first-time
college students like Justin
Heermann 'l2, who rely heavily on
The Stanford Fund.
"I remember driving down Palm
Drive with my dad and seeing the
campus open up in front of me, and
it got even better when I realized
that through Financial Aid, I could
actually come here," Heermann said
in a video embedded within the
report.
In the past, the University
seemed hesitant to put too much
weight on the importance of finan
cial aid. The 2007-2008
Undergraduate Education report
stressed that money allocated to
increasing access to the University
was "more than just financial aid"
and Stanford seemed to follow an
approach of actually showing what
financial aid does for a student
rather than spending time telling
donors it was important for its own
sake.
Student Life
This year's report also showcased
recently completed building plans.
The report emphasized that alumni
dollars ensured that Stanford stu
dents were no longer "stuffed like
sardines in a can" due to implemen
tation of The Housing Master Plan,
which aimed to create more living
space for students. In 2009, Crothers
Hall and Crothers Memorial Hall
were converted into undergraduate
housing units.
In past years, the University took
the approach of profiling a specific
student group in the Undergraduate
Education report. This year, howev
er, the approach appeared to be a
renaissance strategy, showing that
the University has it all. The report
features an embedded video mon
tage of students saying thank-you
from Stanford's 100-plus registered
student groups, from "a cappella to
wushu."

Academic Experience
In the academic realm, the new
field program coordinator within
the Earth Sciences School,
Introductory Seminars (Intro-sems)
and the Arts Intensive program
topped the list for expansions to the
undergraduate academic experi
ence.
The Stanford Fund provides
money straight into the coffers of
the University's three undergradu
ate degree-granting schools: the

School of Humanities and Sciences,
the School of Engineering and the
School of Earth Sciences. The
schools then individually determine
which department projects to fund
with the TSF money.
The School of Earth Sciences
used its 2008-2009 Stanford Fund
donations to hire a field program
coordinator, Max Borella, to lead
outings to Death Valley and
Owens Valley and to work with
faculty to tailor the undergraduate
experience for earth sciences stu
dents.
Intro-sems were also big on the
University's fundraising priority
list. As in past years, they continue
to shore up support for the small
student programs that were
launched under Stanford President
Gerhard Casper.
The report also highlighted the
Arts Intensive Program, a three
week immersive experience similar
to Sophomore College where jun
iors and seniors study the arts in the

weeks before fall quarter. VPUE
launched the Arts Intensive in 2009
with grants from The Stanford Fund
and the Hume Endowment for the
Arts.
"Considering the economic
times, I am very fortunate to be a
part of a community that believes in
its youth and in supporting each
other," said Nikesh Patel 'lO, a
recipient of The Stanford Fund
scholarship. "Thank you."
VPUE and the Office of
Development are hoping donors
feel the same way and write a
check to Stanford to show their
gratitude.
In fiscal year 2009, $18.4 million was
raised in The Stanford Fund, down
from the $19.8 million raised in 2008.
The Stanford Fund hit a fundraising
peak in 2006 and 2007 at $19.9 mil
lion.

Development do it every year in the
form of the Annual Report on
Undergraduate Education.
The report separate from the
University's Annual Report, which
is created out of the University com
munications department tells
donors where their money went
when they cut a check to the
University and provides an opportu
nity to highlight areas where
Stanford would like to invest more
money into the undergraduate expe
rience.
Despite a year of financial belt
tightening, everything about the
2008-2009 Annual Report on
Undergraduate Education centers
around the new, from the hire of an
Earth Systems field program coordi
nator, to a profile of Stanford's Arts
Intensive summer program, to the
just-renovated student residences at
Crothers. Even the format of the
Annual Report itself now a
"green" 30-page interactive online
viewbook is a departure from
past years of a paper-based publica
tion.
The yearly report a joint effort
by the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education (VPUE)
and the Office of Development
provides donors with a snapshot of
key undergraduate programs
crucially, through the lens of dona
tions to The Stanford Fund. It reads
like a brochure for prospective stu
dents underscoring a myriad of
must-have undergraduate offerings
but with one caveat: If you like
these programs, you (the donors)
must pay for them.
Rebecca Smith Vogel, senior
director of marketing and communi
cations at the Office of
Development, said the
Undergraduate Education report is
not so much a fundraising strategy
as it is a donor update, but the
University does highlight some
major initiatives and priorities in the
report's pages.
"In determining which programs
to feature in the annual report, we
look at allocations that received the
most money, and we also try to vary
the programs we feature so that
donors who are receiving the annual
report year after year are getting an
opportunity to read about different
aspects of the undergraduate experi
ence," wrote Vogel in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Whereas one year we might focus
on the arts, another year we might
have more stories that feature work
in the sciences or engineering,"
Vogel said. "We do try to have some
thing that would interest everyone,
so we are aiming to showcase a vari
ety of programs and students in any
given report."
In mid-December 2009, the
Office of Development sent an e
mail to 82,000 undergrad alumni,
parents of current students and past
donors to inform them about the
2008-2009 Annual Report on
Undergraduate Education.
The 2008-2009 report highlighted

three main areas where the
University wanted to direct its alum
ni donations: need-based financial
aid, the academic experience and
student life. Eighty-two percent of
The Stanford Fund dollars were
allocated to undergraduate financial
aid, 11 percent went to academic
experience and seven percent went
to student life.
Financial Aid
Financial aid, one of President
John Hennessy's highest priorities,
moved to the forefront of the out
reach message.
"We have stood by our Financial
Aid commitment by using other
institutional sources of funding such
as The Stanford Fund (annual gift
funds) more heavily than we would
have if the endowment funds were
available," Karen Cooper, director
of financial aid, told The Daily in
November.
After a 27 percent decline in the
University's endowment, 82 percent
of the Stanford Fund was ear
marked for Financial Aid in 2008-
2009 to fill the widening gap. In typ
ical years, about half of The Stanford
Fund goes toward financial aid. For
2009-2010, the University projects
that 75 percent of The Stanford
Fund 15 million will go toward
Financial Aid. Currently, 49 percent
of undergraduates receive need
based financial aid.
The 2008-2009 Annual Report on
Undergraduate Education aimed to
personalize the financial aid mes
sage by profiling videos of first-time
college students like Justin
Heermann 'l2, who rely heavily on
The Stanford Fund.
"I remember driving down Palm
Drive with my dad and seeing the
campus open up in front of me, and
it got even better when I realized
that through Financial Aid, I could
actually come here," Heermann said
in a video embedded within the
report.
In the past, the University
seemed hesitant to put too much
weight on the importance of finan
cial aid. The 2007-2008
Undergraduate Education report
stressed that money allocated to
increasing access to the University
was "more than just financial aid"
and Stanford seemed to follow an
approach of actually showing what
financial aid does for a student
rather than spending time telling
donors it was important for its own
sake.
Student Life
This year's report also showcased
recently completed building plans.
The report emphasized that alumni
dollars ensured that Stanford stu
dents were no longer "stuffed like
sardines in a can" due to implemen
tation of The Housing Master Plan,
which aimed to create more living
space for students. In 2009, Crothers
Hall and Crothers Memorial Hall
were converted into undergraduate
housing units.
In past years, the University took
the approach of profiling a specific
student group in the Undergraduate
Education report. This year, howev
er, the approach appeared to be a
renaissance strategy, showing that
the University has it all. The report
features an embedded video mon
tage of students saying thank-you
from Stanford's 100-plus registered
student groups, from "a cappella to
wushu."

Academic Experience
In the academic realm, the new
field program coordinator within
the Earth Sciences School,
Introductory Seminars (Intro-sems)
and the Arts Intensive program
topped the list for expansions to the
undergraduate academic experi
ence.
The Stanford Fund provides
money straight into the coffers of
the University's three undergradu
ate degree-granting schools: the

School of Humanities and Sciences,
the School of Engineering and the
School of Earth Sciences. The
schools then individually determine
which department projects to fund
with the TSF money.
The School of Earth Sciences
used its 2008-2009 Stanford Fund
donations to hire a field program
coordinator, Max Borella, to lead
outings to Death Valley and
Owens Valley and to work with
faculty to tailor the undergraduate
experience for earth sciences stu
dents.
Intro-sems were also big on the
University's fundraising priority
list. As in past years, they continue
to shore up support for the small
student programs that were
launched under Stanford President
Gerhard Casper.
The report also highlighted the
Arts Intensive Program, a three
week immersive experience similar
to Sophomore College where jun
iors and seniors study the arts in the

weeks before fall quarter. VPUE
launched the Arts Intensive in 2009
with grants from The Stanford Fund
and the Hume Endowment for the
Arts.
"Considering the economic
times, I am very fortunate to be a
part of a community that believes in
its youth and in supporting each
other," said Nikesh Patel 'lO, a
recipient of The Stanford Fund
scholarship. "Thank you."
VPUE and the Office of
Development are hoping donors
feel the same way and write a
check to Stanford to show their
gratitude.
In fiscal year 2009, $18.4 million was
raised in The Stanford Fund, down
from the $19.8 million raised in 2008.
The Stanford Fund hit a fundraising
peak in 2006 and 2007 at $19.9 mil
lion.
