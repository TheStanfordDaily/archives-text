## EDITORIAL ASSU Executive Mid-Year Evaluation: Part Two 
### 
Despite overall success in delivering on
the promises of its campaign, the Ex
ecutive administration of computer
science co-terminal student David Gobaud
and Andy Parker 'll still has work left un
done. The Editorial Board remains unsatis
fied by the Executive response to two agen
da points in particular: lobbying for changes
in immigration laws and revising the Judicial
Affairs processes regarding sexual assault.
Both key issues of review and reform have
been heavily stressed by the Executive ad
ministration, and despite both agenda points'
garnering campus-wide attention, Gobaud
and Parker have yet to come through with re
sults on these issues.
Immigration reform was a solid part of the
Executive officers' campaign platform, with
Gobaud clearly stating his intentions to sup
port new immigration policies that will ease
the difficulties faced by international stu
dents traveling between Stanford and their
homes abroad. Although this agenda compo
nent manifested itself visibly through the
ASSU-funded trip to D.C. this October,
Gobaud ultimately offered no concrete in
formation back to the Stanford public about
the next steps taken by his administration, or
any vision of the future. Instead, he offered
this vague statement to The Daily: "I'd like to
see Stanford or the ASSU take a more
prominent role or get more active in state
and federal policy or advocacy."
Ultimately, this response offered little to
the student body, not even the opportunity, to
engage, question and critique the trip, and
thus alienated individuals from contributing
to this issue. Reform ultimately requires in
formation, and on the issue of immigration
reform, neither future steps nor present facts
have been made clear.

see a similar type of reform for University
government, specifically in Judicial Affairs.
And yet, in this area as well, the Executive
administration appears to be working covert
ly behind the scenes, doing intensive research
of the Judicial Affairs process even beyond
sexual assault issues. At the same time, how
ever, they have done little to try to educate
the student community about the Judicial Af
fairs process and the changes they hope to
promote. Unlike their more public initiatives
such as the forthcoming Sustainability
Summit and Mental Health Week the Ex
ecutive has kept the Judicial Affairs issue
largely under the radar.
As the Editorial Board suggested in yes
terday's piece, comprehensive Judicial Af
fairs reform would be such a lengthy and
complicated undertaking that it may require
several Executive terms to see it through.
Even so, the current Executive must not
allow the issue of how sexual assaults are
handled on campus to be deferred to anoth
er time to do so would be an injustice to
the victims of sexual assault and the student
community as a whole. Along the same lines,
those international students who face contin
ual difficulties with immigration every time
they move between countries will look to the
Executive officers to see how they have ad
vocated on their behalf. Up to and including
this point in the term, the Executive response
has been somewhat lacking.
With the success of sustainability, infor
mation dispersion and their other platform
goals already more or less established, the
Editorial Board recommends that Gobaud
and Parker consider what their long-term
legacy will be on campus after the end of
their term. Pushing for reform in Judicial Af
fairs and student immigration policies may
be the last issues this Executive tackles, but
over time they could have the greatest im
pact on students.

Gobaud's lukewarm gesture of support
for national, governmental-level change is
contrasted by his strong desire and efforts to
