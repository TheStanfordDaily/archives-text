# GET IT RIGHT
## How do you define 'progress'? 
### Erica Morgan 
Now that we've dried our eyes for the
late Senator Ted Kennedy, distin
guished Senator from Chappaquid
dick, it's time to cast them in the direction of
the high-stakes Massachusetts senatorial
race that will determine his replacement. By
the time this editorial is printed, the results of
the election will be in. At that time, I welcome
you to join me in either a rampant celebra
tion of potential salvation or mutual commis
eration as we watch our nation descend fur
ther down the path of Obama-style social
ism. Perhaps this assessment strikes readers
as overdramatic, but I am not the only one
awaiting the election results with bated
breath. What, you ask, is the big deal with this
particular senatorial race? The results will
determine whether or not Democrats fill the
sixty seats in the Senate required to over
come filibusters.
Should a Republican fill the seat, insidi
ous initiatives such as the proposed health
care reform legislation may not advance
at least, not easily. Of course, certain Democ
rats are clearly more concerned with passing
something in spite of the desires and
needs of the American people. As Nancy
Pelosi charmingly puts it: "We will have
health care one way or another." She scoffs at
the idea put forth by the Massachusetts Re
publican candidate that Congress return to
the drawing board to create a health care re
form plan that might actually meet the wants
of the American citizens. Pelosi might note
that, according to recent polls, 51 percent of
Americans oppose the proposed changes to
the health care system.
Scott Brown, the Republican candidate in
question, has managed to pull ahead of De
mocrat Martha Coakley in the polls leading
up to Tuesday's election. A political editor for
The Boston Globe astutely observes, "...
Scott Brown's campaign has done a very
good job, capitalizing on anger at Washing
ton, anger over health care, anger about the
deficit, the sort of throw-them-out mentali
ty." Brown has managed to amass vast popu
larity despite trailing Coakley by double dig
its in the polls just a week ago.
The former underdog in the quest for
"Ted Kennedy's seat," Brown has the De
mocrats all in a tiff over how they will pro
ceed to shove legislation down our unfortu
nate throats should they lose the 60th seat.
Realizing that this may not be an easy feat,
Democrats are taking desperate measures to

restore support for Coakley in Massachu
setts, including flying our illustrious presi
dent out to a Boston rally to woo crowds with
the classic hope-and-change bombast. One
must wonder, however, if Obama's backing
will be of much value to Coakley's campaign,
considering his ever-declining approval rat
ings. Former President Clinton weighed in
with some enlightening remarks of his own:
"The worst thing we can do is nothing."
Now, there is a fascinating statement. It
appears in varied forms of liberal rhetoric.
Akin to the attitude that "some form of
health care reform is better than no reform"
and "making your voice heard is more impor
tant than knowing what you're saying," the
sentiment might be rephrased as, "doing
something reprehensible and ultimately
pointless is better than admitting we don't
know what we're doing." The Democrats
love criticizing Republicans for halting
progress for saying "no" without offering
an alternative. What the Dems fail to realize
is that "progress," merely for the sake of pre
tending to have accomplished something, is
not progress at all. I would rather there be no
health care reform than have Congress pass
the pointless atrocity to fulfill Obama's agen
da objectives. It may be blasphemy in the
Age of Obama, but "no change" actually is an
alternative. Go Brown!
