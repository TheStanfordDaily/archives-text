# THE 						PENSIEVE
## Harry Potter and the Frustrating Fight 
### Melanie Horn Brian Wanyoike 
"It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight,
and fight again, and keep fighting, for only
then could evil be kept at bay, though never
quite eradicated..."
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,
pp. 644-645
As far as lofty pursuits go, "eradicating
evil" is pretty high up there. Although
we Stanford students are extremely
goal-oriented, it's difficult to attribute signif
icance to the fights we undertake when the
main evils we focus on eradicating are
squeaky bike brakes and out-of-control e
mail inboxes. Even when we focus our efforts
on something significant and pit ourselves
against issues of social justice and reform, we
may quickly find ourselves overwhelmed
and paralyzed by the enormity of what we
face. However, when we examine Harry's
struggles against Voldemort, we are remind
ed of why and how we ought to fight.
Throughout the series, it seems as if de
feating Voldemort is Dumbledore's and
Harry's be-all-end-all goal; as if destroying
Voldemort will be the solution to the wizard
ing world's problems. Nevertheless, after
Dumbledore's death (spoiler!), when Harry
is contemplating how he will proceed to de
feat Voldemort, he recalls Dumbledore's
wise words on combating evil. Harry realizes
that Voldemort's demise will not actually de
stroy evil for good, and that evil will, in fact,
always be present in one form or another. At
the same time, Harry manages to recognize
the importance of making small strides for
ward and chooses not to give up hope.
During our time at Stanford, most of us be
come passionate about one issue or another,
whether it is poverty and human trafficking
or education and healthcare reform. We try to
find and then actualize these passions by join
ing campus organizations, sending out slews

of enthusiastic e-mails and dreaming up non
profits. Oftentimes, however, we fall into the
trap of taking a damaging approach to the so
called evils that we battle, and we lose per
spective on what it is that we have set out to
fight. We tend to become dangerously drunk
on our ideas and let the lack of tangible re
sults push us over the edge, both of which
Dumbledore fervently warns Harry against.
While Dumbledore does not implore
Harry to abandon his passion or to mindless
ly deflect obstacles along the way, he reminds
him that if he fights without fully understand
ing the battle, Harry may very well end up
aimlessly fighting against himself. As Harry
then attempts to live out Dumbledore's ad
vice in his pursuit of Voldemort, he is able to
focus on each individual step forward. There
fore, rather than finding himself in combat
with his own selfish ambitions, resignation in
the face of struggle or disappointment in the
unattainable nature of his goal, he is able to
face each new challenge with energy and zeal.
Harry clearly internalizes Dumbledore's ad
vice, as by the last installment, he is able to act
with maturity and stamina as he makes the
final strides toward defeating Voldemort.
We thus learn from Harry's example that
our so-called "life missions" are not simply

about the final results but are also about refin
ing a process with deliberate and well-reasoned
steps. His experiences taking down horcrux
after horcrux show us that we can find great
value in the incremental strides that we take to
ward diminishing our discontent with and in
justice that we see in our world. Progress
against evil doesn't have to involve abolishing
pain and suffering from the entire world, but
can simply involve eliminating these things in
one individual's world at a time. By pursuing
our goals in such a manner, we are then able to
find the strength both to press on and to ac
knowledge that our work is not in vain.
Lastly, as we consider the battles we wish to
fight, we must recognize that if we truly
choose to chase lofty visions, our chase will be
a lifelong one. Evil certainly did not disappear
with Dumbledore's defeat of Grindelwald,
and it's safe to say that Voldemort's defeat did
not entail evil's defeat either. Dumbledore
committed his life to fighting evil, taking on
one dark wizard after another. We are conse
quently reminded by his example that any
mission we embark on, whether it be self-im
provement or systemic change, may never see
resolution in our lifetimes. Perhaps that is
what our years at Stanford truly prepare us for
and teach us. Not only does it equip us with the
weapons to fight our chosen battles, but we are
also able to engage with and learn from those
who have been waging these battles for a long
time, with the same ardor and hope that they
had when they first entered the fray.
Then again, broken bike brakes are a pret
ty terrible form of evil in this weather. They
might just be the one form of evil that can be
eradicated with a quick trip to the bike shop.

Melanie and Brian have yet to eradicate the evil
of procrastination (Editor's note: true). For tips
