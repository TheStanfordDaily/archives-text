Dear Editor:
In response to Monday's article,"New Grads
Face Health Care Worries," the Stanford Alum
ni Association hopes that recent graduates un
derstand that we offer short-term major medical
coverage, administered by an outside insurance
provider, to recent graduates and alumni.
Though it is a temporary health insurance plan
that does not cover preexisting conditions, it still

has benefits for recent graduates and alumni.
Participants have the ability to choose any doc
tor or hospital rather than confine themselves to
a specific network in order to receive covered
care. The plan provides up to 180 days of cover
age, and participants can re-apply for coverage
after 180 days. Recent graduates and alumni
who have purchased SAA's short-term medical
coverage have given positive feedback regard
ing the plan's customer service and Stanford's

dedicated customer service representative.
More information about SAA's short-term
medical coverage offering for recent graduates
and alumni can be found at:
www.gradmed.com/Stanford or by calling the
plan administrator at 1-800-922-1245.
