## DIVING DELIGHT Divers find success in L.A. 
### KABIR SAWHNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At last weekend's Bruin Diving Invitational in
Westwood, Calif, the Stanford diving team brought
home the hardware with four second-place finishes
and two first-place finishes. The event pitted the
Card against divers from San Diego, UCSD,
UCLA, Southern California and Connecticut.
As expected, the Cardinal upperclassmen
were dominant. On the men's side, senior Dwight
Dumais began his quest for an individual NCAA
championship with a strong second-place finish in
the 1-meter springboard. However, Dumais dis
appointed in the 3-meter springboard he fin
ished in eighth place in the preliminaries and
failed to qualify for the finals.
Junior Brent Eichenseer was met with more
success. He achieved third in the 1-meter behind
Dumais and USC's Harrison Jones, and won sec
ond on platform diving behind Jones. Eichenseer
ended the meet on Sunday with a forceful per
formance in the 3-meter finals, winning the com
petition by 64.70 points over UConn's Adam
Genuario.
The women's team also had a very strong
meet. Senior Carmen Stellar placed second in all
three events, and junior Meg Hostage garnered a
first-place finish in the 1-meter and third place in
the 3-meter.
Sophomore Mary Beth Corbett, who recorded
seventh-place finishes in the 1-meter and 3-meter,
commented on the overall success of the meet.
"I did better than I expected," she said. "The
competition was good, because USC has two peo
ple who've been to the Olympics, so getting as
close as [Stellar and Hostage] did to them was a
great win."
Stellar actually placed higher than one of
those Olympians, Ariel Rittenhouse, on the plat
form.
"We know there's a lot of progress to be made
before Pac-lOs, and we know that we can do that,"
Corbett added.
Even more impressive is the fact that Stanford
placed so well despite not going into the meet
with a highly competitive mindset.
"This was one of our earlier meets, so it didn't
mean a lot in terms of places or points," Corbett
said. "This was the meet where our coach was
looking to see where we are in the season [and]
how we're progressing. It was a really good indi
cator for our team of how we're doing."
The Cardinal freshmen also performed well,
giving head coach Dr. Rick Schavone an early in
dication of their level relative to the competition.
For the women, freshman Jennifer Wylie dove
well on the 1-meter and 3-meter, but did not reach
any finals, placing 17th and 21st respectively on
the two boards. Freshman Tommy Fraychineaud
did somewhat better —he made the finals in
both springboards, placing ninth in the 1-meter
and third in the 3-meter.
While the long-term focus is on the Pac-10 and
NCAA tournaments, the divers are preparing for
next weekend's meets against Arizona and Ari
zona State. Both swimmers and divers will com
pete in these dual meets, which involve both the
men's and women's teams.
"Everyone has one or two things they know they
need to work on," Corbett said. "We really want to
work on technique, so the meets will end up being
natural and we won't have to work as hard for it."
