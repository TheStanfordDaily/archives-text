## Republican wins Mass. Senate seat Scott Brown defeats Martha Coakley in state's first G.O.P. Senate win since 1972 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a race that was thought to be non-competitive until
just weeks ago. Republican Scott Brown secured a massive
upset victory over Democrat Martha Coakley in
Massachusetts, winning Tuesday's special election for the
U.S. Senate seat previously held by liberal lion Ted Kennedy.
The outcome, which eliminates the Democratic caucus'
super-majority in the Senate, poses a significant risk to
pending health care reform legislation.
Brown won by about 120,000 votes, or a 52 to 47 percent
margin. According to polls, Coakley led by 31 points in
November and by 17 at the beginning of January. But in the
past week, Brown led in nearly every survey taken, and his
five-point margin of victory was actually on the lower end of
recent numbers.
His recent surge sparked national interest in the race, as
President Barack Obama and former New York Mayor
Rudy Giuliani went to Massachusetts to campaign for
Coakley and Brown, respectively. On election day, despite
inclement weather, Massachusetts Secretary of State
William Galvin estimated that turnout may have been 50
percent.
Brown, a state senator, takes over a seat that has been
held by the Kennedy family, except for a two-year interrup
tion, since 1953; Ted Kennedy died in August after holding
the seat for 47 years. Brown is the first Republican elected
to the Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Burke in
1972.
"Tonight, the independent voice of Massachusetts has
spoken," Brown said after he was proclaimed the winner.
"This Senate seat belongs to no one person, no one political
party."
He did express his admiration for Kennedy, an iconic fig
ure in Massachusetts polics.
"Senator Ted Kennedy was a tireless and big-hearted
public servant, and for most of my lifetime was a force like
no other in this state," Brown said. "There's no replacing a
man like that, but tonight I honor his memory, and I pledge
my very best to be a worthy successor."
Coakley, the attorney state general, did not take the loss
