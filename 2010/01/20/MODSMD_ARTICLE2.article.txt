## Republican wins Mass. Senate seat Scott Brown defeats Martha Coakley in state's first G.O.P. Senate win since 1972 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a race that was thought to be non-competitive until
just weeks ago. Republican Scott Brown secured a massive
upset victory over Democrat Martha Coakley in
Massachusetts, winning Tuesday's special election for the
U.S. Senate seat previously held by liberal lion Ted Kennedy.
The outcome, which eliminates the Democratic caucus'
super-majority in the Senate, poses a significant risk to
pending health care reform legislation.
Brown won by about 120,000 votes, or a 52 to 47 percent
margin. According to polls, Coakley led by 31 points in
November and by 17 at the beginning of January. But in the
past week, Brown led in nearly every survey taken, and his
five-point margin of victory was actually on the lower end of
recent numbers.
His recent surge sparked national interest in the race, as
President Barack Obama and former New York Mayor
Rudy Giuliani went to Massachusetts to campaign for
Coakley and Brown, respectively. On election day, despite
inclement weather, Massachusetts Secretary of State
William Galvin estimated that turnout may have been 50
percent.
Brown, a state senator, takes over a seat that has been
held by the Kennedy family, except for a two-year interrup
tion, since 1953; Ted Kennedy died in August after holding
the seat for 47 years. Brown is the first Republican elected
to the Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Burke in
1972.
"Tonight, the independent voice of Massachusetts has
spoken," Brown said after he was proclaimed the winner.
"This Senate seat belongs to no one person, no one political
party."
He did express his admiration for Kennedy, an iconic fig
ure in Massachusetts polics.
"Senator Ted Kennedy was a tireless and big-hearted
public servant, and for most of my lifetime was a force like
no other in this state," Brown said. "There's no replacing a
man like that, but tonight I honor his memory, and I pledge
my very best to be a worthy successor."
Coakley, the attorney state general, did not take the loss
lightly. "I am heartbroken at the
result," she said, conceding Tuesday
night. She lost despite Obama's 26-
point victory just over a year ago
and a gigantic gulf in voter registra
tion in the state Republicans
account for only 12 percent of vot
ers.
Coakley was labeled as an elitist
and did little to dispel that notion.
As the election wound down, she
scoffed at the idea that she should
shake hands with people, claiming
that she was too busy and would
instead rely on the support of local
mayors and school boards.
One of her most widely publi
cized comments that Boston Red
Sox legend Curt Schilling, a
Republican advocate, was a fan of
the archrival New York Yankees
further enforced the idea that she
was out of touch with her con
stituents. And in perhaps her biggest
gaffe, Coakley, running a campaign
with a heavy focus on law enforce
ment and security, claimed that
Afghanistan was free of terrorists.
Brown, by contrast, played up an
everyman image by driving his
truck around the state, meeting
with voters 66 times; Coakley made
just 19 campaign stops. Coakley was
not only unable to shake the superi
ority tag, but she was also unable to
color Brown negatively. As a result,
his working class persona pros
pered, and it was cemented by the
time Coakley released a slew of
desperate advertisements that
tried, at the end, to craft the public's
view of Brown.

"There will be plenty of
Wednesday-morning quarterback

ing about what happened, what
went right, what went wrong,"
Coakley said. "We will be honest
about the assessment of this race,
and although I was very disappoint-

Ed, I always respect the voters'
choice,"
The stunning outcome not only
affects Massachusetts, but has sig
nificant national implications.
Congress was expected to reconcile
both the House and Senate versions
of health care reform legislation
early this year, with the Democrats'
60-vote, filibuster-proof advantage
acting as a restraint against any
major changes from the bills passed
in late 2009.
Ted Kennedy, a champion of
reform throughout his career,
refused to retire in August, despite
brain cancer, because it would end
the Democratic supermajority.
Brown, who is vocally opposed
to the health care bill, will now
break that stranglehold and put the
entire process in doubt. Democratic
leaders will now have to choose
from a host of unpalatable options
in proceeding: convincing their
House majority to pass the Senate
bill without changes, returning to
deadlocked negotiations with
Republican senators or bringing the
bill to a vote it may not survive.
"One thing is clear: voters do not
want the trillion-dollar health care
bill that is being forced on the
American people," Brown said. "I
will work in the Senate with
Democrats and Republicans to
reform health care in an open and
honest way."
Brown will take over for Paul
Kirk, who holds the seat on an
interim basis. Brown will have to
run for reelection in 2012. He is
expected to take his seat within the
next couple of weeks.
