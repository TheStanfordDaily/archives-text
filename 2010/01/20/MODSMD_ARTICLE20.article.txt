## Card claims home win against Cats 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a narrow, season-opening loss to defending
NCAA champion Georgia last week, the Cardinal
women's gymnastics team was able to redeem itself in a
successful meet against Arizona on Sunday. Competing
before 1,000 in the sold out home-opener at Burnham
Pavilion gave the team just the motivation it needed to
defeat the Wildcats, 196.025-194.675 and improve its
record to 1-1.
This particularly high team score for Stanford was
partially due to exceptional performances from senior
co-captain Carly Janiga, who captured the all-around
victory for the second time this season. This time with a
score of 39.325 against Arizona, the six-time All-Amer
ican and defending Pac-10 all-around champion
achieved a floor victory (9.875) and averaged a meet
high 9.83 for her four events.
But it was the entire team's solid scores on the very
first event that especially gave it the momentum it need
ed for the rest of the competition. The 49.250 on the
vault to start the day was the team's season-best score in
any event and from this excellent outset, Stanford never
trailed.

"The vault was really outstanding," said head coach
Kristen Smyth. "That was a great way for us to start."
Junior Shelley Alexander's vault score of 9.90 from
the final position in the lineup was the highest of the day
and one of 15 season bests by Stanford. Alexander also
tied her career high score on the bars (9.825) and fin
ished close behind Janiga for the all-around with a sea
son-high score of 39.225.
Alexander and Janiga weren't the only ones who
contributed to the Cardinal victory, though they had
strong support from their teammates, who also im
proved their scores from the first meet. Junior Danielle
Ikoma and sophomore Alyssa Brown, for example, re
turned Stanford to its strong position after the third ro
tation when Arizona closed to within less than a point at
147.100-146.825. At that point, the Cardinal had suf
fered a fall and a series of minor mistakes, but Ikoma
and Brown's back-to-back season best 9.800s on the
beam put the team back on track.
