## Card claims home win against Cats 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a narrow, season-opening loss to defending
NCAA champion Georgia last week, the Cardinal
women's gymnastics team was able to redeem itself in a
successful meet against Arizona on Sunday. Competing
before 1,000 in the sold out home-opener at Burnham
Pavilion gave the team just the motivation it needed to
defeat the Wildcats, 196.025-194.675 and improve its
record to 1-1.
This particularly high team score for Stanford was
partially due to exceptional performances from senior
co-captain Carly Janiga, who captured the all-around
victory for the second time this season. This time with a
score of 39.325 against Arizona, the six-time All-Amer
ican and defending Pac-10 all-around champion
achieved a floor victory (9.875) and averaged a meet
high 9.83 for her four events.
But it was the entire team's solid scores on the very
first event that especially gave it the momentum it need
ed for the rest of the competition. The 49.250 on the
vault to start the day was the team's season-best score in
any event and from this excellent outset, Stanford never
trailed.

"The vault was really outstanding," said head coach
Kristen Smyth. "That was a great way for us to start."
Junior Shelley Alexander's vault score of 9.90 from
the final position in the lineup was the highest of the day
and one of 15 season bests by Stanford. Alexander also
tied her career high score on the bars (9.825) and fin
ished close behind Janiga for the all-around with a sea
son-high score of 39.225.
Alexander and Janiga weren't the only ones who
contributed to the Cardinal victory, though they had
strong support from their teammates, who also im
proved their scores from the first meet. Junior Danielle
Ikoma and sophomore Alyssa Brown, for example, re
turned Stanford to its strong position after the third ro
tation when Arizona closed to within less than a point at
147.100-146.825. At that point, the Cardinal had suf
fered a fall and a series of minor mistakes, but Ikoma
and Brown's back-to-back season best 9.800s on the
beam put the team back on track.

GAME NOTES ! The women's gymnastics team will look to contin
ue its strong start to the season as it hosts Pac-1 0 rivals UCLA
at Burnham Pavilion this Sunday. The Card is coming off of an
important victory in its first home meet of the season, defeating
Arizona 1 96.025-1 94.675 last Sunday. The team will need to
take advantage of the upcoming matchup with the Bruins, as it
is one of only three remaining home meets in the season.
Smyth noted Brown's contribu
tions, saying that "it was wonderful
to see her perform so confidently on
the beam."

Freshman sensation Ashley
Morgan, daughter of Baseball Hall
of Famer Joe Morgan, also contin
ued to build on her already stellar
collegiate debut. Achieving a 9.85
on the floor and placing second in
the event, Morgan proved to Smyth
and her teammates that they can ex
pect greatness from the young ath
lete over the course of the next four
years.
In its entirety, Sunday's meet
was an important one. As Stanford
continues through its difficult first
few weeks of the season, an early
victory allowed the team to gain the
confidence it needs to retain in
order to qualify for the Super Six in

late April.
"It was another strong perform
ance," Smyth said. "We made a few
mistakes, but I felt the team did a
good job covering for each other. To
score a 196 this early with places to
make big improvements, is a good
sign."
It was a good sign indeed and
one that the team will have to recol
lect next Sunday in its meet against
No. 1 UCLA (2-0). Stanford will
face the Bruins on the Farm and the
team is well aware of the tough task
that lies ahead.
Last year, Stanford and UCLA
did not meet in a head-to-head com
petition until the Pac-10 finals. The
Bruins were scheduled to compete
with Stanford in February of 2009,
but they were forced to withdraw
from the meet after a majority of the
team fell ill. Though UCLA reigned
supreme over the Card when they
did square off in last year's finals, the
Stanford women look to upset the
rankings on Sunday.
The two teams have split the past

six Pac-10 championships and this
week's meet is likely to be another
neck and neck competition between
the west coast's two strongest gym
nastics programs. UCLA, like Stan
ford, won its most recent dual meet,
as the Bruins dominated No. 19
Washington last Friday.
Events begin at 2:00 pm in Burn
ham Pavilion.
