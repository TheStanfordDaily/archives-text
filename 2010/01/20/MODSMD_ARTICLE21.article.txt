# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Double the Domination 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis
team has made winning seem easy
in the beginning of the spring sea
son. The Cardinal returned with
the singles and doubles crown at
both the NCTC Classic and the
Freeman Memorial Champi
onships and kick-started a spring
season that looks to be filled with
promise.
"It was a huge win for the
team," said head coach LeLe
Forood. "It brings up the level of
expectation on this team, how
everyone feels about each other
and the confidence level as a re
sult."
The team split up this past
weekend, sending half the team to
compete at the NCTC Classic
while the other half played at the
Freeman Memorial Champi
onships. Junior Hilary Barte de
feated USC's Maria Sanchez 7-5,
6-2 to claim the singles champi
onship of the NCTC Classic in a

match between two highly ranked
individuals. She then paired up
with senior Lindsay Burdette to
defeat UCLA's Andrea Remynse
and Yasmin Schnack 8-6 for the
doubles championship, both
teams placing in the top 10 nation
ally. Junior Jennifer Yen and soph
omore Logan Hansen also partici
pated, both losing in the round of
16.
The freshmen led the way at
the Freeman Memorial Champi
onships, with Stacey Tan and Na
talie Dillon winning their respec
tive divisions. Tan also teamed up
with fellow freshman Mallory
Burdette to win the doubles crown
over North Carolina's Sophie
Grabinski and Sanaz Marand 8-6
and improving their record to 8-2
overall. This was an exciting dou
bles win, as the two were unranked
as a team and overcame the No. 6-
ranked UNC duo. In singles, Tan
won five matches before coming
away with the trophy, the last three
of those coming against UNC players. In the
final, she beat Katrina Tsang of UNC 7-6,6-2.
"It was a good experience," Tan said. "It
was different being in Vegas, playing a tour
nament there. There were a lot of good play
ers there."
Tan's transition to team tennis has been
smooth, especially considering that her dou
bles experience has been limited. She played
singles in high school and attempted a few
WTA tour matches, but doubles was largely
left out of the picture. She attributes her recent
success at doubles to her partner, Mallory Bur
dette.
"We fit really well together," said Tan. "I
didn't usually play doubles that much before
I came here, so when I started, it was really
different. I didn't know what to do, where to

move. [Mallory] had more experience at it, so
she could help me out a lot. It's so much more
fun than I thought it would be."
Dillon, who previously hadn't gotten to
the final of a tournament during her time at
Stanford, managed to string together a series
of very impressive and hard fought wins to
win the flight two championship at the Free
man Memorial Championship. Fighting her
way through two three-setters in the semifi
nals and the final, she came away with a final
victory over UNLV's Rumyana Terzieva 6-4,
6-7,6-2 and her first tournament win at Stan
ford.

"Winning her draw was huge," Forood
said. "It's huge for her to know that she can
compete at the Division-I level and be suc
cessful because she comes in with less experi

ence, It's all about exposure and becoming
comfortable with the level and I think that
win went a long way toward getting her
there."

Looking forward, team play begins next.
Stanford's first opponent is Hawai'i, followed
by UC-Davis at home. Unfortunately, most of
the team's Pac-10 matches will take place
away from the Farm this year. USC, UCLA
and Cal will be the only teams hosted at home,
but those come toward the end of the season in
April.
"This is going to be our road year," said
Forood. "We've got big home matches in
April, largely. When you look at our home
schedule winter quarter, it is essentially non
conference. I see our big matches being on
the road this quarter.Texas, the LAs, at Cal, so

Hawai'i a week from today at Taube Tennis Center.

we're gearing up for some big road games."
The players are excited for team play to
begin as well. When asked about the upcom
ing Pac-10 matches, Tan expressed her excite
ment by saying, "you're not just playing for
yourself. You're playing for the entire team
and for the school, for Stanford."
