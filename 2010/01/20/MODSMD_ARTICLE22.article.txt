# Football's options to replace Toby

### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Toby Gerhart is on his way to
NFL millions.
Stanford is on its way to a conun
drum that could define its 2010 sea
son: how do the Cardinal replace the
All-American's production?
Gerhart's total yardage accounted
for over a third of Stanford's offense
output in 2009; his 1,871 rushing
yards shattered his own school
record. But beyond statistics, he was a
rock that powered Stanford to wins
(see: Notre Dame) and kept the team
competitive in close games when oth
ers faltered (see: Cal, Oklahoma).
The Cardinal's task to account
for both the tangible and intangible
losses is tall, and while there are
certain elements of the offense that
may look the same, there will have to
be changes to the overall attack if
Stanford wishes to retain its top 20
national yardage ranking.

Stanford's approach originated
from Gerhart's physical style of play.
There is no back currently on the ros
ter who can emulate that. But the
other pieces are still there. The offen
sive line, for instance, loses only Chris
Marinelli and Allen Smith, as both
Matt Kopa and James McGillicuddy
are expected to earn medical red
shirts. Kopa, the expected starter at
left tackle in 2009 before injuries, may
be able to slide into Marinelli's spot
on the right side, which would give
Stanford's line a largely similar look.
Tight end Jim Dray, who blocked like
a tackle, is gone, but the two main re
serve components of the powerful
diesel package McGillicuddy and
Bert Mc√üride will return.
But the men they will be blocking
for are still largely undetermined, at
least in terms of the hierarchy. Step
fan Taylor and Tyler Gaffney both
saw time as true freshmen this sea
son. Taylor served as Gerhart's
change-of-pace back while Gaffney,
who was recruited as a fullback by
some schools, displayed a nice combi
nation of both power and speed. Both
received opportunities because Jere
my Stewart went down with an injury
early in the year; before then, the jun
ior was effective when spelling Ger
hart and, like Anthony Kimble a year
before him, was having the most suc
cess of his career in that reserve role.
All three will factor into the run
ning game, but it's essentially a free
for-all. And they're not the only ones
involved. There's Usua Amanam and
Andrew Stutz, both of whom red
shirted this season. Amanam was a
highly regarded recruit who dealt
with a foot injury all season; Stutz was
a walk-on who won the Cardinal's
award for best offensive scout team
player.
Then there are the current re
cruits. Namely, Brandon Bourbon,
the nation's leader in yards per carry,
and four-star back Anthony Wilker
son. Both have committed to Stan
ford; they may ultimately be joined
by another runner, Ricky Seale, who
is still choosing his school.
Of course, an eight running back
rotation isn't in the works. Some may
be better suited for the other side of
the ball Bourbon at linebacker
and Amanam in the defensive back
field, for instance. Or, there could be
exogenous roles. Amanam, for in
stance, could be an X-back similar to
Delano Howell in 2008. Though so
much is uncertain, it is not likely that
the Cardinal sticks with one feature
back, at least at the beginning of the
season, as they did throughout 2009
multiple players will get opportu
nities.
This has both positive and nega
tive connotations. Stanford will be
able to keep players fresh and throw
out different combinations of run
ners with varying skill sets a prime
way to keep a defense guessing. On

The Cardinal can
make up the loss
through the air, too
