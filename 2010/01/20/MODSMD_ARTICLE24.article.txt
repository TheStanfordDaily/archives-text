# The 						other side of club sports at Stanford
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
I play on the Stanford Club Baseball
team. We face other club teams from
California and Nevada. Our hats have
the National Club Baseball Association
logo on the back. In other words, I am a club
athlete.
Of course, Stanford University doesn't see
it that way. Ask the Athletic Department
about a club baseball team and they will give
you a blank stare.
That's because according to the Universi
ty, I am part of an ASSU Voluntary Student
Organization (VSO) athletic club. In a move
that can only be explained by an attempt to
increase the size of its mind-numbingly slow
bureaucracy, Stanford decided to separate
club teams that do or do not have a Division I
affiliate.
For example, since Stanford has a DI base
ball team, club baseball is a VSO. Same thing
for basketball, soccer, volleyball, tennis, water
polo, women's lacrosse and other sports that
Stanford already has.
What is the significance of the separation?
Well, it means that club baseball stores its gear
in the back of a player's car, while ultimate fris
bee has three coaches and annually travels to a
tournament in Las Vegas.
Sorry, that was an unfair jab. I'm sure fris
bee needs those three coaches to instruct them
on the intricate art of a sport that grandmoth
ers play with their grandchildren on beaches in
Hawaii.
The biggest difference and the only practi
cal one, is that VSOs receive much less money
from the University. Club sports and VSOs
both receive money from The Stanford Fund,
normally around $1,500 per quarter. Both nor
mally charge member dues (Club Baseball is
$2OO per year). What VSOs do not receive,
however, are special fees the fees students
vote on and can request refunds from. Cur
rently, club sports collectively receive $8.23 per
student per quarter and that money is then
split between the teams based on such factors
as budget and need.
That's a lot of frisbees.
By funding club sports more heavily than
VSOs, the University is sending a clear mes
sage: It has no use for student-athletes who
cannot compete at the DI level.
In the eyes of the University, VSO athletes
do not contribute to the school. Unlike club
cricket, frisbee or rugby, VSO teams do not
bring another sport to the Athletic Depart
ment's vast lineup of teams. Stanford already
has a baseball team and a basketball team, so
why should it fund another one?
This line of thinking is a mistake. VSOs are
much more valuable to the University than
club sports are.
VSOs are one of the best recruiting tools
Stanford has to attract high school athletes.
VSOs are full of players who were very good
high school players, but not quite good enough
to play for a DI school, especially for one as
good as Stanford.
When these students apply to different
schools, they have a choice to make. Do I go to
a smaller school where I can continue
playing the sport I love, or do I go to
Stanford and completely stop playing?
VSOs offer a compromise the
ability to attend a school like Stanford
and still compete in the sport you have
been playing your entire life. I know I
can't speak for every VSO athlete, but
I was seriously considering going to

another school where I knew I could
make the varsity baseball team. While
club baseball isn't the same as varsity
college baseball, I still didn't have to
quit baseball cold turkey to attend
Stanford.
Stanford's actual club sports do
not have this recruiting power. How
many diehard cricketers or archers
do you know whose college choice
would be shaped by the existence of
a club cricket or archery team? Prob
ably none.
Yet, these are the teams who re
ceive the most money from Stanford.

Something doesn't add up.
These club sports definitely con
tribute to the atmosphere of Stanford.
How many campuses can you walk
around and see students play taek
wondo or rugby?
But to argue that they contribute
more and are worth more than VSOs
is irrational. Give VSOs the respect
and funding they deserve and treat
them as full-fledged club sports.

ever had of making the Frisbee team.
