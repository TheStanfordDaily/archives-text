# TRACK AND FIELD
## Indoor season begins 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Starting the season out on top is
always a plus and that's exactly
what the Stanford track and field
team hoped to do this past weekend
in Seattle at the University of Wash
ington Indoor Preview. This early
season meet was a chance for the vet
erans to get back on the track, but
most importantly, a chance for the
fresh blood on the team to get a feel
for collegiate competition.
Additionally, some of the fresh
men had never competed in an in
door setting, which is very different
from an outdoor meet. The curves in
an indoor track are banked, giving
the runners a very different running
experience. Also, the track is not the
traditional 400 meters in circumfer
ence rather, a standard indoor
track is 200 meters, which means sev
eral laps for those running the dis
tance events. Indeed, getting a feel
for the nature of the track and how to
strategically optimize the unique
track style is essential for top per
formances.
Excitingly enough, the weekend
was marked with some great per
formances and top finishes for the
Cardinal. On the women's side, soph
omore Katerina Stefanidi led the
way with an automatic NCAA quali
fying mark of 13-11 1/4 in the pole
vault. Stefanidi placed third in the
event with her best collegiate vault
ever. Additionally, her mark has now
established a new Stanford indoor
record.
An automatic NCAA qualifying

standard means that the athlete has a
guaranteed spot to compete at the
NCAA Indoor National Champi
onships.
Also leading the way for the
women was senior Griffin Matthew,
who placed second in the 60 meters
with a time of 7.56 seconds. Matthew
was immediately followed by fresh
man Carissa Levingston, who fin
ished in third with a time of 7.58 sec
onds.
"Seattle was a great season open
er, and I learned a lot about myself as
a competitor coming away feeling
really positive about this next sea
son," Matthew said. "The first meet
of the year always helps me to focus
in on the areas of my race that need
work, motivating me to improve my
times. I'm really looking forward to
improving my time in the 60 meters
this next weekend."
Faring incredibly well for her col
legiate debut was freshman Kala
Stepter, who placed second in the
400 meters with a time of 57.77.
The women also entered two dis
tance medley relays, with one team
placing second and one team placing
fourth. The second place team con
sisted of sophomore Victoria Pen
nings, Levingston, sophomore Sarah
McCurdy and senior Maddie
O'Meara, and finished with a time of
11:44.05. The fourth place team con
sisted of Matthew, sophomore Geor
gia Griffin, sophomore Kristin Reese
and junior Maddie Duhon, and fin
ished with a time of 12:05.58.
On the men's side, the sprinting
trio of seniors Tyrone McGraw,
Danny Belch and Ryan Fisicaro led

the way in the 60 meters. McGraw
won the race with a time of 6.87, fol
lowed by Belch in second place with
a time of 6.91, and Fisicaro in fourth
place with a time of 6.96.
"It felt great to finally be healthy
and be in a position to perform the
way I know that I can," said McGraw.
"There's been a lot of injury over the
years and a lot of hard work, but my
teammates and I are finally bearing
the fruits of our labor."
McGraw is also looking forward
to what this race means for the fu
ture.
"Considering how well we all ran
this past weekend and how much tal
ent they have, I think we have a great
indoor season ahead of us and an im
pressive 4xloo meter relay team
come outdoor season," he said. "It
should be exciting."
The men's distance medley relay
consisting of freshman Andrew
Berberick, senior Zach Chandy, sen
ior Justin Marpole-Bird and sopho
more Riley Sullivan finished in sec
ond place with a time of 9:53.71. Also
securing top spots in the meet were
freshman Jules Sharpe, who tied for
first in the high jump with a mark of
6-11, and junior Casey Roche, who
tied for third in the pole vault with a
mark of 16-7 1/4.
Next weekend the Cardinal will
split into two groups, some heading
off to Idaho for the Blue and Orange
Classic, with others heading off to
New Mexico for the Cherry and Sil
ver Classic.
