# Cafe outside Green set to open March 3 at the earliest, after costly renovation
## Coupa still months away 
### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
The coveted kiosk outside Green
Library that used to house Moonßean's
Coffee was, until this year, a center of
intellectual vitality on campus. The out
door cafe was a guaranteed location for
an awkward run-in with your IHUM T.E
and a hub of academic discussion out
side the classroom.

For the past six months, however, the
kiosk has been empty as preparations
are made for Moonßean's replacement
the second on-campus Coupa Cafe,

which is projected to cost Stanford
Library $177,000.
According to Kelly Rohlfs, a project
manager for the Stanford Department
of Project Management, if final con
struction permits from Santa Clara
County come through this week, Coupa
could be ready for occupancy by March
3.
The hope comes after months of bro
ken promises. The kiosk was first set to
open by the start of the 2009-2010
school year and has continually been
pushed back due to permit delays.
With some permits in place, such as

the electrical permit, construction work
ers are finally on-site for the renovation
process. But plumbing and mechanical
permits are still needed, and even if ren
ovations are complete by March 3, it
may be longer before the cafe is fully
operational.

Still, Coupa Cafe owner Jean Paul
Coupal 'O7 listed in the Stanford
directory as affiliated with the vice
provost and dean of research hopes
to begin service soon after the end of
construction.
"We've already begun training staff
two months ago," Coupal said. "The idea

is to be ready to operate basically at 100
percent."
Months of Delays
Andrew Herkovic, director of com
munications and development for
Stanford University Library and
Academic Information Resources
(SULAIR), said the Library, which own
the kiosk, did not expect the renovation
process to take as long as it has.
"We had no reason to believe it
would be this ridiculous of a delay," he

THEN : MoonBean's Coffee occupied the kiosk next to Green Library until last year, when
Stanford Libraries awarded Coupa Cafe a new lease on the space. Coupa's opening has been
delayed months due to permitting issues. Renovating the space is expected to cost $177,000.

NOW: As coffee-lovers await Coupa's opening, set for
March 3 at the earliest, the cafe has installed an espresso machine
inside Meyer Library. The opening was originally set for fall.
