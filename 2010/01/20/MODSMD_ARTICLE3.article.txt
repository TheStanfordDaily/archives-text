# Cafe outside Green set to open March 3 at the earliest, after costly renovation
## Coupa still months away 
### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
The coveted kiosk outside Green
Library that used to house Moonßean's
Coffee was, until this year, a center of
intellectual vitality on campus. The out
door cafe was a guaranteed location for
an awkward run-in with your IHUM T.E
and a hub of academic discussion out
side the classroom.

For the past six months, however, the
kiosk has been empty as preparations
are made for Moonßean's replacement
the second on-campus Coupa Cafe,

which is projected to cost Stanford
Library $177,000.
According to Kelly Rohlfs, a project
manager for the Stanford Department
of Project Management, if final con
struction permits from Santa Clara
County come through this week, Coupa
could be ready for occupancy by March
3.
The hope comes after months of bro
ken promises. The kiosk was first set to
open by the start of the 2009-2010
school year and has continually been
pushed back due to permit delays.
With some permits in place, such as

the electrical permit, construction work
ers are finally on-site for the renovation
process. But plumbing and mechanical
permits are still needed, and even if ren
ovations are complete by March 3, it
may be longer before the cafe is fully
operational.

Still, Coupa Cafe owner Jean Paul
Coupal 'O7 listed in the Stanford
directory as affiliated with the vice
provost and dean of research hopes
to begin service soon after the end of
construction.
"We've already begun training staff
two months ago," Coupal said. "The idea

is to be ready to operate basically at 100
percent."
Months of Delays
Andrew Herkovic, director of com
munications and development for
Stanford University Library and
Academic Information Resources
(SULAIR), said the Library, which own
the kiosk, did not expect the renovation
process to take as long as it has.
"We had no reason to believe it
would be this ridiculous of a delay," he

THEN : MoonBean's Coffee occupied the kiosk next to Green Library until last year, when
Stanford Libraries awarded Coupa Cafe a new lease on the space. Coupa's opening has been
delayed months due to permitting issues. Renovating the space is expected to cost $177,000.

said.
According to Rohlfs, however, the
permitting process normally takes
months, so this time frame is not
unusual.
Another reason for the delay is
that the original plans for the new
cafe only included minor renova
tions. The need for extensive renova
tions was not discovered until late in
the summer.
"Originally the plan was to do a
light renovation and open in
September," Coupal said. "But I had
never gone into the building until
after the bidding process, and we'd
never done a study of what was there
until after Moonßean's left." Coupal
said he had to wait to see the interior
until after Moonßean's had moved.

Moonßean's operated under a
provisional permit because the kiosk
was not built in accordance with
county health standards. Now that
the kiosk will be changing tenants,
the building is required to be updat
ed to meet these county regulations.
"We were surprised by the condi
tions of the building," Coupal said.
"It had been there for 12 years with
no updating."
The kiosk will now be undergoing
an extensive interior renovation to
bring the kitchen up to health code
regulations and allow for more on
site food preparation.
Included in this $177,000 remodel
will be a new exhaust hood, sinks and
flooring, as well as plumbing and
electrical updates.
"Everything is being brought up
to health code regulations," Coupal
said. "It will be non-viewable to the
public, in the kitchen area."
Coupal said that he also plans to
make changes to the furniture in the
outdoor seating area. Jennie
Reynolds, the former owner of
Moonßean's, wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily that she had been asking
Stanford to change this same seating
area for years.
Bidding War
Moonßean's had been the tenant
of the Library kiosk for 10 years.
When its lease expired last spring,
SULAIR solicited bids for the kiosk
space.
According to Herkovic, the
Library received four bids for the
space, including one from
Moonßean's.
"We chose based on a combina
tion of hours, services, quality, vari

ety, business terms and stability,"
Herkovic said. "Overall, Coupal
clearly came out ahead."
Reynolds said she was surprised
by the outcome of the bidding
process.
"I was fairly certain we would get
the contract," Reynolds said. "I knew
the building needed improvements
and that we may have to close for a
short period to do that, but I didn't
think we would lose the spot. The
Library had never expressed any dis
satisfaction with us."
Mark Frykman 'll, a former
Moonßean's employee, believed
library staff had had qualms with cer
tain aspects of the Moonßean's cul
ture. "We were trying to keep on the
library's good side," he said.
Reynolds added that the Library
had asked to increase her rent an
extra cost she could not afford with
out trade-offs for her employees.
"There was a point in the bidding
process when Stanford asked for
more money," Reynolds said. "The
difference in yearly payment would
have been more than $40,000. Lots of
my employees had been hoping for a
raise, and health insurance was
through the ceiling. I just couldn't
justify it, especially with the addition
al output of money to remodel. I
don't know if the decision would
have been different if we had agreed
to that."
Herkovic said S LI, AIR chose
Coupa because its proposal offered
the best overall plan. "Coupa's pro
posal showed an interest in more and
better food service," he said.
What's Next
The new Coupa Cafe will be
offering both coffee beverages and
hot food.
Herkovic acknowledged concerns
about increased congestion and wait
ing time associated with hot food
preparation, although Coupal has
plans to assure adequate speed of
customer service.
"The idea is that the kitchen will
be a powerhouse," Coupal said. "And
we'll have at least two registers to
start.

"I'm guessing the lines are going
to be pretty long, though," he added.
Despite promises of longer hours
of operation and a more extensive
menu, many students have expressed
dissatisfaction with the way the tran
sition was handled. In particular,
some students wonder why SULAIR
had not looked into the permit
process before evicting Moonßean's.
"The charitable way to under
stand this would be to say that the
Library is not in the habit of building
kitchens," said Justin Brooke 'lO, a

student member of the Board of
Trustees Committee on Land and
Buildings, who said he was not
speaking on behalf of the board or
the committee and looked into the
issue as a matter of personal interest.
"However, I think that when the
stakes are as high as they are, the
Library should have been more care
ful and cognizant about what was
involved with the construction
they should have gone in with all the
facts," Brooke said.
"Because the Library didn't know
what it was doing, the Stanford com
munity has lost a very important cafe
for the summer, autumn and winter
quarters," he added. "The kiosk,
whether it's Moonßean's or Coupa,
is an integral part of the Stanford
lifestyle for so many people. To have
that disappear for such a long time is
an enormous failure."
To provide a substitute for the
now-vacant cafe, Coupa Cafe has
installed a permanent coffee and
espresso vending machine in Meyer
Library. The machine will remain in
place after Coupa opens to allow for
24-hour coffee service in the library
area.
Coupal hopes that this vending
machine and his new cafe will serve
the undergraduate community in
particular. "I want to contribute to
Stanford student life as we have in
Y2E2," he said. "If we can offer that
on the opposite side of campus, it's
only a benefit for everyone."
For Reynolds, who had closed her
other Bay Area cafes to focus on the
Stanford Moonßean's, finding out
that the well-loved coffee shop
would not be given another lease was
a shock.
"It's one thing to lose your job,
but entirely another to lose the com
pany you ran since you were 23 years
old," she said. "It was life-changing,
for sure."
Despite the state of the economy,
most former Moonßean's employees
have found new jobs. Frykman said
he was fortunate in that he was not
financially dependent on his job at
Moonßean's.
"I was doing it to make spending
cash," he said. "But for a lot of others,
it was their only job, and they were
doing it to pay their rent."
Since losing her business, Reynolds
has kept busy with fiction writing and
a band she has just started. At this
point, she does not plan on reopening
a Moonßean's cafe in the area.

"I do really miss Stanford,
though," she admitted. "I'm still mak
ing everybody's drinks in my head."
