## Faculty, staff housing sales down for fourth straight year 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
A look at year-end numbers for Stanford
real estate sales shows a more than 50 per
cent decrease in single-family residence
sales from academic years 2005-2006 to
2008-2009 down to 23 from 48 while

sale prices stayed within the same ranges as
previous years.

Faculty Staff Housing (FSH), a division
of the Office of the Provost, assists eligible
faculty and executive-level staff in acquiring
permanent housing in the area, including on
University-owned land. Most faculty and
staff in on-campus housing are found in

neighborhoods surrounding the central
campus, such as Santa Ynez Street, Mayfield
Avenue or condominiums on Peter Coutts
Circle or Pearce Mitchell Place.

In the 2005-2006 academic year, FSH
reported 48 sales of single-family residences
on campus, including 11 condominiums. By
academic year 2008-2009, the total on-cam

pus sales number dropped to 23. As of Jan. 6,
2010, only 10 sales have been made in the
current academic year.
Single-family homes during the 2008-
2009 academic year sold for between $1.3
and $2.5 million, whereas condominiums
ranged from $350,000 to $840,000.
In the wake of the housing bubble bust,
housing markets in surrounding cities have
become noticeably less active, with sales
numbers dropping along with home prices,
said locals involved in real estate.
Jan Thomson, Stanford's FSH manager,
explained that the on-campus housing mar
ket lags behind the surrounding housing
markets, but generally follows outside trends
in terms of mortgage rates and other meas
urements.
Thomson emphasized, however, that the
small campus housing market is likely
affected by the limited number of residences
available.
"The [sale] numbers reflect the supply on
campus," she said. "It's largely dependent on
what's available, as compared to off-campus
housing, which has much more available."
Thomson noted that declining sales num
bers can be partly attributed to the
University's less aggressive recruitment of
new faculty because of recent financial
restraints. Some rental housing has also been
unoccupied, but Thomson hopes to see them
occupied in the near future.
Real estate agents who handle sales on
campus agreed that availability plays a large
role in determining yearly sales numbers.
"Clients will look both on and off cam
pus when trying to buy a home in the area,"
said real estate agent Monica Corman of

Among faculty and staff on-campus residences, the real estate market has seen steady prices but a decline in sales volume over the
past four years. Single-family homes during 2008-2009 sold for between $1.3 million and $2.5 million; 23 homes sold last year.
