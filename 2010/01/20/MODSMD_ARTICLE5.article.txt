## Senate tightens special fees Bill to reduce spending passes, paces GSC approved tonight 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate on
Tuesday passed a widely-debated bill to reduce
growth in special fees spending, resulting in an
extensive dispute over the nature of the vote
that took place, which many senators claimed
was riddled with problems and parliamentary
misconduct. Concerns were also raised about
student group input into the bill.
Also last night, leaders expressed a need to
drastically increase the undergraduate fundrais
ing campaign for Haiti earthquake relief.
According to ASSU Vice President Andy
Parker 'll, although about $30,000 has been
raised, only five to 10 percent of the undergrad
uate population has donated, putting Stanford
$40,000 behind Dartmouth, who was initially
encouraged by Stanford student government
leaders to start fundraising.

Special Fees Bill 'Approved'
Senator Alex Katz 'l2, who authored a bill that
would make it more difficult for student groups to
receive funding increases in each spring's special
fees election, said it "will make groups think a lot
harder about what they really need to make their
groups successful."
The goal, he said, was to reduce
growth in special fees funding; he
cited the Stanford Film Society's
budget increasing last year by more
than $50,000 as an example. Two
reasons for such increases are the
petitioning period being extended
last year, allowing more time for the
groups to obtain money, and the
recurring problem, as Katz sees it, of
students approving too many
increased budgets.
"The fact that no one says 'no' is
also a part of the problem," Katz
said. "I can't promise that this bill is
going to save the system, but this is
a step in the right direction."
Fie pointed out that the bill
would give the student body an
additional level of control. If special
fees groups really need more
money, he said, they would have to
go to the student body and ask for
it.
"At some point, the student body
deserves the power to look over
these budgets and determine if this
increase is justified," Katz said.
Some senators, including Adam
Creasman 'll and Zachary Warma
'll, noted that the tendency of the
student body to approve budgets
posed a significant problem for the
special fees process that the bill did
not address.
"The undergraduate body has
not voted down a single budget we
give them," said Warma, also
columns editor for The Daily.
Both noted, however, that the
issue was not necessarily a reason
not to support the bill.
No student group representa
tives spoke during the meeting's
public comment period. A round of
approximately 1,600 e-mails to stu
dent group leaders informing them
of the proposed change garnered
about 20 positive responses, said
Senator Anton Zietsman 'l2.
Deputy Chair Kelsei Wharton
'l2 and other senators raised con
cerns, both before and after the
vote, about the level of input stu
dent groups had into the bill, as well
as their awareness of the fact that
the bill had at the time they
received Zietsman's e-mail not
yet been passed.
"First, 30 [responses] is not half

bad. Second, not a lot of people
responding is a good sign," Katz
said. "We've given people multiple
chances to come in and say, 'Thus
would really hurt us.'"
"The fact that people aren't
screeching down our throats is pret
ty darn good," added Warma.
When the bill was finally called
to question, the result was nine
votes in favor, four opposed and two
abstentions. Although the vote had
technically passed, widespread con
fusion and dispute erupted when
several senators realized that they
had misunderstood the voting
process.
One senator did not realize that
abstaining his vote meant that it
would not be counted in the senate
quorum, therefore potentially alter
ing the number of votes needed to
pass.
For his part, Senate Chair Varun
Sivaram 'll did not realize that he
could table the bill prior to voting,
which would postpone calling it to a
vote and allowing for more time for
discussion.
"No disrespect you've done
your work, but I feel uneasy [about
voting]," Sivaram said to Katz, who
conducted an unofficial straw poll,
determining that seven senators
desired seeing concrete numbers
about funding trends.
Sivaram conducted the straw poll
after voting for the bill.
Senators voiced the need for a
vote to "re-vote" on the bill next
meeting once more data had been
shared, allowing for a more educat
ed vote. Although this sentiment
was widely expressed, the bill was
technically still passed.
"I'd just like to say that a vote
was taken; a vote was passed,"
Warma said. "If there had been
at the beginning of this, when we
knew there was going to be a...
vote a motion to table should
have been provided before the
question was called."
Other Business
Two subsequent funding bills for
Chinese Students and Scholars at
Stanford and Los Saleros de
Stanford were unanimously passed.
Parker also introduced Alisha
Blackford, a graduate student in
education, as a candidate for the
position of Executive Director of
the Student Service Division, a posi
tion that oversees the ASSU
Shuttle, Wellness Room and Green
Store. Parker currently serves in

that role. Her appointment is set to
come up for approval by the Senate
and Graduate Student Council next
week.
