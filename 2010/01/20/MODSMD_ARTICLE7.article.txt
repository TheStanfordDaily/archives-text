## RECALLING CELL BLOCK NUMBER ONE ABBAS MILBNI'S PATH FROM TEHRAN TO STANFORD 
### JACOB JOLIS 
After last summer's anti-government protests
following the disputed presidential election in
Iran, authorities set up show trials of over 100
alleged opposition leaders. One of Stanford's
own came into focus: Dr. Abbas Milani, co
director of the Iran Democracy Project at the Hoover
Institution and director of Iranian Studies at Stanford.
The statement read that Milani was even more impor
tant to the CIA than Shah Reza Pahlavi's son because of
Milani's close contact with reformists and his position at
"an institute called Hooffer" the most important of the
American foundations behind the Velvet Revolution,
according to the court's statement.
In the U.S., Milani is one of the most respected schol
ars on Iranian politics. He is the resident Iran expert for
The New Republic magazine and has been interviewed
on CNN. In July 2009, he testified before the Committee
on Foreign Affairs in the House of Representatives.
His path to success, however, was all but straight.
Milani was born into a prominent Iranian family one
uncle a senator, another a minister in the cabinet. At age
15, he was sent to study in the United States and enrolled
in Oakland Technical High School, from which he man
aged to graduate only a year later.
Milani went on to Oakland's Merritt College where, as
he writes in his 1996 biography "Tales of Two Cities," the
two founders of the Black Panther Party, Bobby Scale
and Huey Newton, "gave [him his] first taste of radical
ism," just at the emergence of the Black Power
Movement.
Having transferred to Berkeley in 1968, Milani joined
a Marxist student group opposing the Pahlavi regime in
power in Iran. He remained stateside until receiving his
Ph.D. from the University of Hawaii in 1974, at which
point he was ready to return to his homeland.
"I really wanted to go back quickly to Iran," he
recalled. "I was a radical student. I wanted to go back and
make the revolution."
In Tehran, he began teaching political science at
National University. The revolution that Milani had envi
sioned, however, never came. Coating his Marxist ideas in
metaphors while lecturing, Milani failed to carry on unno
ticed. After just two years back in Tehran, he was dealt a
five-year prison sentence for opposing the regime, despite
his family's ties in government.
"In Iran at the time," he said, "and in Iran today, I think,
the one crime that connection cannot solve is political."
However, after plea bargaining and agreeing not to
attack the regime in a media-packed courtroom, his sen
tence was shortened to one year. During this time, Milani
spent six months in the notorious Evin Prison.
"Because I was a university professor and came from
a prominent family, I was placed in Cell Block Number
One, [a division of the prison reserved for special
inmates]," he said.
But despite this, he was granted no special treatment.
"The head of domestic intelligence told me during one
of my interrogations, 'Don't think your family can save
you. Your ass is mine,'" he recalled.
At the time, Cell Block Number One held some of the
most influential leaders of the revolution yet to come;
among them, Grand Ayatollah Montazeri, Ayatollah
Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Mahdavi Kani. Milani's close
contact with them turned him into a skeptic of the flow
ery speeches of democracy that Ayatollah Khomeini
delivered from exile in Paris and of the Islamic
Revolution itself once it hit the streets of Tehran in 1979.
"I spent time with these guys in prison. I knew how
intolerant they would be," he said. "I sensed that what was
coming was a form of despotism worse than what was
leaving us. Mixing religion and democracy would not be
an option."
Upon his release, the shah's regime kept barring

Milani from the classroom because he was considered a
leftist. He believes that the shah's fear of communism
blinded him from the foe that would eventually over
throw him.
"They thought we a group of small students
were their main enemy and they allowed the clergy to do
anything they wanted," he said.
The political science professor also draws a parallel to
the Cold War.
"The US made the same mistake in Afghanistan," he
said. "They thought they could use the Islamists against
the Soviet Union and they were successful in doing it. But
they created a monster bigger than, or at least as big as,
the monster they were fighting."
Milani laughs as he recalls the chaos surrounding the

hottest days of the Islamic Revolution in '79. He joined a
group of professors with the endeavor of keeping
Teheran University a non-militarized zone.
"People had ransacked army depots everybody
carried a machine gun. Somebody even brought a tank
into the University," he said, pausing with a smile as he
remembered the events that followed. "So we asked them
to take it out. And they did."
According to his students, his apparent ease and light
heartedness are translated into his teaching.
"[He is] one of the most laid back and personable pro
fessors I've ever had at Stanford," said Andi Harrington
'l2, one of his students in this quarter's Polisci 245R:
Politics in Modern Iran. "His class offers relief even
though the content is so dense through his simple and

concise descriptions and of course with a little humor."
One of his advisees, Miguel Molina 'll, said that keep
ing in mind his close interaction with Iranian politics,
including imprisonment, makes his impartial work in the
classroom all the more impressive.
"His unbiased scholarship and teaching is remarkable
and commendable," he said. "After each class session, you
walk away with the sensation of not just having learned a
great deal, but with the intellectual comfort of having the
ability of fomenting your own educated opinions."
After the Islamic Revolution, Milani went back to
teaching, but encountered the same types of barriers to
his scholarship that he had under the shah popularity
among students intertwined with suspensions and dis
missals.
In 1986, while Milani sought a second opinion before
undergoing open-heart surgery, an American doctor, Dr.
Childs at UCLA, said there was nothing wrong with his
heart and instead diagnosed the scholar with "Khomeini
Syndrome." Milani understood the time to leave Iran had
come once again.
"I left a job at the top university in the country and
came here with no job," he recalled. "I literally had to
work as a bartender initially to make ends meet."
The university professor joined the ranks of Spangler's
Bar in Berkeley. Luckily, Notre Dame de Namur
University in Belmont, Calif, soon appointed Dr. Milani
as Chair of the Department of History and Political
Science, where he stayed for 12 years.
But his longtime comfort at Notre Dame de Namur
would soon be briskly disrupted. Milani was again put in
the spotlight of Iranian expatriate political life when a
group of Persian Americans raised enough money
through donations to create the Iran Democracy Project
at Hoover.
Milani speaks lovingly and proudly of the project.
Although the Bush administration allocated $75 million
in efforts to promote democracy in Iran and, according to
Milani, offered him one of those millions, he kindly
declined.
"We decided that we were going to be a grassroots,
non-government endeavor and we have remained that,"
he explained.
Only hours prior to speaking to The Daily, Milani went
on the Voice of America and addressed this issue of gov
ernment funding.
"If you can find evidence that we got one penny from
the U.S. government one penny I will never utter a
word about Iran again," he stated. He reinforced this to
The Daily: "It is absolute, utter nonsense."
Khomeini's government has been the project's most
outspoken opponent, linking it to American imperialism
and the CIA. It even named Milani an enemy of the state
and now Stanford University is along with Yale on
the regime's list of "subversive organizations."
The regime that denounced him, Milani explained, is
fractured and scared. Even Ahmadinej ad's supporters are
leaving what seems to be a sinking ship.
"They know they are sitting on a seething volcano.
They know people hate them," he said. "Any sudden
move can unleash this wrath. If they thought they
could've gotten away with killing Mousavi [the "runner
up" in June's presidential election], they would have
killed him yesterday. Not only haven't they killed him,
they've increased his bodyguards."
Even if it wanted to, the Hoover Institution inspiring a
democratic revolution in Iran would be a major long shot,
if not impossible. But what about a revolution from the
Iranian people themselves?
"Unless people want a potentially bloody civil war,
you can't be looking for a revolution in that sense," he
said. "I think Iran will need a transitional phase before
democracy. For that to happen, you need the will of the
people and I think we have that."

walk away with the sensation of not just having learned a
great deal, but with the intellectual comfort of having the
ability of fomenting your own educated opinions."
After the Islamic Revolution, Milani went back to
teaching, but encountered the same types of barriers to
his scholarship that he had under the shah popularity
among students intertwined with suspensions and dis
missals.
In 1986, while Milani sought a second opinion before
undergoing open-heart surgery, an American doctor, Dr.
Childs at UCLA, said there was nothing wrong with his
heart and instead diagnosed the scholar with "Khomeini
Syndrome." Milani understood the time to leave Iran had
come once again.
"I left a job at the top university in the country and
came here with no job," he recalled. "I literally had to
work as a bartender initially to make ends meet."
The university professor joined the ranks of Spangler's
Bar in Berkeley. Luckily, Notre Dame de Namur
University in Belmont, Calif, soon appointed Dr. Milani
as Chair of the Department of History and Political
Science, where he stayed for 12 years.
But his longtime comfort at Notre Dame de Namur
would soon be briskly disrupted. Milani was again put in
the spotlight of Iranian expatriate political life when a
group of Persian Americans raised enough money
through donations to create the Iran Democracy Project
at Hoover.
Milani speaks lovingly and proudly of the project.
Although the Bush administration allocated $75 million
in efforts to promote democracy in Iran and, according to
Milani, offered him one of those millions, he kindly
declined.
"We decided that we were going to be a grassroots,
non-government endeavor and we have remained that,"
he explained.
Only hours prior to speaking to The Daily, Milani went
on the Voice of America and addressed this issue of gov
ernment funding.
"If you can find evidence that we got one penny from
the U.S. government one penny I will never utter a
word about Iran again," he stated. He reinforced this to
The Daily: "It is absolute, utter nonsense."
Khomeini's government has been the project's most
outspoken opponent, linking it to American imperialism
and the CIA. It even named Milani an enemy of the state
and now Stanford University is along with Yale on
the regime's list of "subversive organizations."
The regime that denounced him, Milani explained, is
fractured and scared. Even Ahmadinej ad's supporters are
leaving what seems to be a sinking ship.
"They know they are sitting on a seething volcano.
They know people hate them," he said. "Any sudden
move can unleash this wrath. If they thought they
could've gotten away with killing Mousavi [the "runner
up" in June's presidential election], they would have
killed him yesterday. Not only haven't they killed him,
they've increased his bodyguards."
Even if it wanted to, the Hoover Institution inspiring a
democratic revolution in Iran would be a major long shot,
if not impossible. But what about a revolution from the
Iranian people themselves?
"Unless people want a potentially bloody civil war,
you can't be looking for a revolution in that sense," he
said. "I think Iran will need a transitional phase before
democracy. For that to happen, you need the will of the
people and I think we have that."

After last summer's anti-government protests
following the disputed presidential election in
Iran, authorities set up show trials of over 100
alleged opposition leaders. One of Stanford's
own came into focus: Dr. Abbas Milani, co
director of the Iran Democracy Project at the Hoover
Institution and director of Iranian Studies at Stanford.
The statement read that Milani was even more impor
tant to the CIA than Shah Reza Pahlavi's son because of
Milani's close contact with reformists and his position at
"an institute called Hooffer" the most important of the
American foundations behind the Velvet Revolution,
according to the court's statement.
In the U.S., Milani is one of the most respected schol
ars on Iranian politics. He is the resident Iran expert for
The New Republic magazine and has been interviewed
on CNN. In July 2009, he testified before the Committee
on Foreign Affairs in the House of Representatives.
His path to success, however, was all but straight.
Milani was born into a prominent Iranian family one
uncle a senator, another a minister in the cabinet. At age
15, he was sent to study in the United States and enrolled
in Oakland Technical High School, from which he man
aged to graduate only a year later.
Milani went on to Oakland's Merritt College where, as
he writes in his 1996 biography "Tales of Two Cities," the
two founders of the Black Panther Party, Bobby Scale
and Huey Newton, "gave [him his] first taste of radical
ism," just at the emergence of the Black Power
Movement.
Having transferred to Berkeley in 1968, Milani joined
a Marxist student group opposing the Pahlavi regime in
power in Iran. He remained stateside until receiving his
Ph.D. from the University of Hawaii in 1974, at which
point he was ready to return to his homeland.
"I really wanted to go back quickly to Iran," he
recalled. "I was a radical student. I wanted to go back and
make the revolution."
In Tehran, he began teaching political science at
National University. The revolution that Milani had envi
sioned, however, never came. Coating his Marxist ideas in
metaphors while lecturing, Milani failed to carry on unno
ticed. After just two years back in Tehran, he was dealt a
five-year prison sentence for opposing the regime, despite
his family's ties in government.
"In Iran at the time," he said, "and in Iran today, I think,
the one crime that connection cannot solve is political."
However, after plea bargaining and agreeing not to
attack the regime in a media-packed courtroom, his sen
tence was shortened to one year. During this time, Milani
spent six months in the notorious Evin Prison.
"Because I was a university professor and came from
a prominent family, I was placed in Cell Block Number
One, [a division of the prison reserved for special
inmates]," he said.
But despite this, he was granted no special treatment.
"The head of domestic intelligence told me during one
of my interrogations, 'Don't think your family can save
you. Your ass is mine,'" he recalled.
At the time, Cell Block Number One held some of the
most influential leaders of the revolution yet to come;
among them, Grand Ayatollah Montazeri, Ayatollah
Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Mahdavi Kani. Milani's close
contact with them turned him into a skeptic of the flow
ery speeches of democracy that Ayatollah Khomeini
delivered from exile in Paris and of the Islamic
Revolution itself once it hit the streets of Tehran in 1979.
"I spent time with these guys in prison. I knew how
intolerant they would be," he said. "I sensed that what was
coming was a form of despotism worse than what was
leaving us. Mixing religion and democracy would not be
an option."
Upon his release, the shah's regime kept barring

Milani from the classroom because he was considered a
leftist. He believes that the shah's fear of communism
blinded him from the foe that would eventually over
throw him.
"They thought we a group of small students
were their main enemy and they allowed the clergy to do
anything they wanted," he said.
The political science professor also draws a parallel to
the Cold War.
"The US made the same mistake in Afghanistan," he
said. "They thought they could use the Islamists against
the Soviet Union and they were successful in doing it. But
they created a monster bigger than, or at least as big as,
the monster they were fighting."
Milani laughs as he recalls the chaos surrounding the

hottest days of the Islamic Revolution in '79. He joined a
group of professors with the endeavor of keeping
Teheran University a non-militarized zone.
"People had ransacked army depots everybody
carried a machine gun. Somebody even brought a tank
into the University," he said, pausing with a smile as he
remembered the events that followed. "So we asked them
to take it out. And they did."
According to his students, his apparent ease and light
heartedness are translated into his teaching.
"[He is] one of the most laid back and personable pro
fessors I've ever had at Stanford," said Andi Harrington
'l2, one of his students in this quarter's Polisci 245R:
Politics in Modern Iran. "His class offers relief even
though the content is so dense through his simple and

concise descriptions and of course with a little humor."
One of his advisees, Miguel Molina 'll, said that keep
ing in mind his close interaction with Iranian politics,
including imprisonment, makes his impartial work in the
classroom all the more impressive.
"His unbiased scholarship and teaching is remarkable
and commendable," he said. "After each class session, you
walk away with the sensation of not just having learned a
great deal, but with the intellectual comfort of having the
ability of fomenting your own educated opinions."

his scholarship that he had under the shah popularity
among students intertwined with suspensions and dis
missals.

undergoing open-heart surgery, an American doctor, Dr.
Childs at UCLA, said there was nothing wrong with his
heart and instead diagnosed the scholar with "Khomeini
Syndrome." Milani understood the time to leave Iran had
come once again.
"I left a job at the top university in the country and
came here with no job," he recalled. "I literally had to
work as a bartender initially to make ends meet."
The university professor joined the ranks of Spangler's
Bar in Berkeley. Luckily, Notre Dame de Namur
University in Belmont, Calif, soon appointed Dr. Milani
as Chair of the Department of History and Political
Science, where he stayed for 12 years.
But his longtime comfort at Notre Dame de Namur
would soon be briskly disrupted. Milani was again put in
