Ever wonder what the deal was
with that one-unit class on
Disney films being taught by
the guy down the hall last
spring? Were those fliers a
joke or could students actually get aca
demic credit for learning something
fun, yet interesting, from a peer? This is
just one example of a Student Initiated
Course (SIC), a laid-back, discussion
based class option worthy of considera
tion.
SICs take advantage of one of
Stanford's most valuable resources
the student body itself. Students have
the opportunity to design a curriculum
and instruct their peers on a specific
topic of interest.
These one- to two-unit weekly class
es taught for credit/no credit cover an
eclectic range of unusual and often
under-represented subjects. This
quarter, students had the opportunity
to enroll in SICs ranging from
"Development and Diversity in Papua
New Guinea" to "Discoveries and
Debates in Neuroscience Research" to
an "Intro to North American Taiko."
Jenna Gunderson 'll, an avid sports
fan, co-taught a course called

"Introduction to American Sports in
American Society" last quarter.
"We thought that some Stanford
students might be interested in learn
ing more about sports," she said. "We
thought maybe it would get them
pumped for going to different sporting
events."
Dan Bohm 'lO taught the class with
her. Unsurprisingly, he's also a big
sports fan he writes for The Daily's
sports section and has played and
coached different sports throughout his
life. In coming up with the idea for the
class, both Bohm and Gunderson felt
that providing students with greater
exposure to sports and their rules, his
tories and roles in our society might
make students more excited about
attending Stanford games.
"We wanted to spread the wealth
about sports to a group on campus that
we thought wasn't necessarily as inter
ested as we were," he said.
Janani Balasubramanian 'l2 and
Matthew Miller 'l2, who are teaching a
class called "The Color of Ecoliteracy"
this quarter, also wanted to expose fel
low students to their combined intel
lectual passions of racial studies and
the environment. They felt that these
particular passions were lacking ade

quate coverage in the available profes
sor-led courses here.
"We have a lot of really great envi
ronmental studies classes and a lot of
great classes on race,"
Balasubramanian said. "But there
aren't that many classes that deal with
both."
Miller agreed that SICs like theirs

have the potential to provide a more
interdisciplinary angle to topics than
the typical department offerings might.
"We feel that a lot of times classes
make you fraction off your academic
passions and not really deal with the
whole equation," he said.

Students have the opportunity to teach or take 1-2 unit Student Initiated
Courses, such as this winter's "Discoveries and Debates in Neuroscience
Research," in which peer-to-peer discussion is emphasized.
One of Miller and
Balasubramanian's students,
Rachel Dowling *lO, signed up for
the class because of its efforts to
synthesize two previously isolated
issues.
"I decided to take this class
because there aren't any other
classes that deal with this specific
issue," she said. "It addresses a
unique feature of environmental
ism."
To lead a SIC, teachers-to-be
are required to attend training ses
sions, secure a faculty advisor, fill
out an application and prepare for

a quarter's worth of instruction by
assembling materials, Power Points
and discussion ideas.
According to students who
have taken SICs before, their
shortcomings are minimal and
understandable due to the logistics
of these classes; they simply don't
meet that often in any given quar
ter.
"For a one-unit class that meets
only one hour a week, I thought
that most of the drawbacks lack
of coverage of certain topics, for
instance were manageable and
understandable," said Chris Seek
'lO who took Gunderson and
Bohm's class on sports in the fall.
Helen Kwan 'll, who took a
SIC on Harry Potter her freshman
year, had little to say in complaint
about her SIC either.

"Maybe the biggest drawback
would be a lack of potential
resources that professors have
access to," she stated.
In addition to providing stu
dents with exposure to under
explored areas of interest, SICs
also foster a different, more com
fortable format of idea exchange
within the classroom setting.
"In most regular classes, the
information tends to flow one way
the professor enlightens the
student with lectures and stories,"
Seek noted. "In student-led class
es, the experience tends to be
more interactive because the age
gap and experience gap is not
so great."
