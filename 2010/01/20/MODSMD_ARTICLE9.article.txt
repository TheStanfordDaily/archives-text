### CATTY MONROE 
Ever wonder what the deal was
with that one-unit class on
Disney films being taught by
the guy down the hall last
spring? Were those fliers a
joke or could students actually get aca
demic credit for learning something
fun, yet interesting, from a peer? This is
just one example of a Student Initiated
Course (SIC), a laid-back, discussion
based class option worthy of considera
tion.
SICs take advantage of one of
Stanford's most valuable resources
the student body itself. Students have
the opportunity to design a curriculum
and instruct their peers on a specific
topic of interest.
These one- to two-unit weekly class
es taught for credit/no credit cover an
eclectic range of unusual and often
under-represented subjects. This
quarter, students had the opportunity
to enroll in SICs ranging from
"Development and Diversity in Papua
New Guinea" to "Discoveries and
Debates in Neuroscience Research" to
an "Intro to North American Taiko."
Jenna Gunderson 'll, an avid sports
fan, co-taught a course called

"Introduction to American Sports in
American Society" last quarter.
"We thought that some Stanford
students might be interested in learn
ing more about sports," she said. "We
thought maybe it would get them
pumped for going to different sporting
events."
Dan Bohm 'lO taught the class with
her. Unsurprisingly, he's also a big
sports fan he writes for The Daily's
sports section and has played and
coached different sports throughout his
life. In coming up with the idea for the
class, both Bohm and Gunderson felt
that providing students with greater
exposure to sports and their rules, his
tories and roles in our society might
make students more excited about
attending Stanford games.
"We wanted to spread the wealth
about sports to a group on campus that
we thought wasn't necessarily as inter
ested as we were," he said.
Janani Balasubramanian 'l2 and
Matthew Miller 'l2, who are teaching a
class called "The Color of Ecoliteracy"
this quarter, also wanted to expose fel
low students to their combined intel
lectual passions of racial studies and
the environment. They felt that these
particular passions were lacking ade

quate coverage in the available profes
sor-led courses here.
"We have a lot of really great envi
ronmental studies classes and a lot of
great classes on race,"
Balasubramanian said. "But there
aren't that many classes that deal with
both."
Miller agreed that SICs like theirs

have the potential to provide a more
interdisciplinary angle to topics than
the typical department offerings might.
"We feel that a lot of times classes
make you fraction off your academic
passions and not really deal with the
whole equation," he said.

Students have the opportunity to teach or take 1-2 unit Student Initiated
Courses, such as this winter's "Discoveries and Debates in Neuroscience
Research," in which peer-to-peer discussion is emphasized.
