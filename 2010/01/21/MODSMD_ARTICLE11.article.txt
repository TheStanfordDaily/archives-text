## Large amounts of rainfall flood dorms 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
Following the effects of El Nino
on Northern California, students at
Stanford have felt the effects of
increased precipitation, high levels
of wind, a power outage on Tuesday
morning and thunderstorms with
lightning strikes in close proximity to
campus. Several dorms on campus
have experienced flooding, and cam
pus maintenance crews have been
working to drain water and keep
areas dry.
In Casa Zapata in Stern Hall,
basement flooding from the recent
rains affected the study rooms and
the computer cluster.
"There was a good deal of water
on the floors, and a crew is in the
basement working on drying things
out and cleaning up the carpet,"
wrote Chris Gonzalez Clarke, resi
dent fellow in Casa Zapata, in an e
mail to The Daily. "For now, it's not
usable. This has happened for sever
al years in a row."
Students living in Enchanted
Broccoli Forest (EBF) were evacuat
ed at approximately 2 p.m.
Wednesday after rainwater flooded
steam lines in the house, creating
condensation on the pipes and lead
ing to increased heat. The tempera
tures grew hotter than the building,
causing one ceiling sprinkler to go
off and students to evacuate during
what many believed to be a fire drill.

Crews worked to drain the flood
ed areas, which included the kitchen.
Lake Lagunita, located near EBF, is
also currently filling with rain at
uncharacteristically high levels for
this time of year.
"When she [Mother Nature]
takes control, she takes control," said
one crew member in the Stanford
Environmental Health and Safety
Office who was working to drain the
steam lines at EBF. "When the
weather gets going, you can't stop a
thing."
The crewmember, however,
added that this type of flooding and
steam line problem was not uncom
mon. And Housing said the campus
has experienced very little flooding
overall.
"The water intrusion there [Stern
Hall] has been limited to common
spaces and storage rooms in the
basement," said Rodger Whitney,
executive director of Student
Housing. "No student rooms have
been impacted. The water has been
pumped out of the building and
equipment set up to dry the areas."
According to the National
Weather Service forecast for the
Stanford area, there is a 100 percent
chance of precipitation today and
the possibility of another thunder
storm. The chances of rain decrease
through the remainder of the week.
