## EDITORIAL In digital donation, do not forget the real tragedy 
### Patrick Kozey 
In the past week, "Text 'Haiti' to 90999"
has become a übiquitous phrase seen and
heard throughout the U.S. almost as
übiquitous as the news of the catastrophic 7.0
earthquake that struck the small island na
tion. Mass text messaging, coupled with Twit
ter and Facebook updates, have helped relief
efforts by disseminating info about easy $5
and $lO donations to the Red Cross, Partners
in Health and other organizations. Millions
of dollars have been raised. Just as was the
case of the Iranian election protests this past
summer, the global exchange of digital infor
mation has connected the world with the
plight of the Haitian people, allowing relief
to flow more quickly and in greater quantity
than ever before.

Perhaps even more important than the
ability to speed donations is the social
media's capacity to reunite the scattered sur
vivors of this calamity; Facebook alone has
allowed the Haitian people to locate or
search for lost family members in the ruins of
Port-au-Prince, to keep family members in
other countries updated on their situations
and to make the world vividly see the effects
of the earthquake on real people.The democ
ratization of media has only begun to be
come apparent. The summer protests in Iran
were experienced by the larger world
through the lens of the cell phone camera
and Twitter feed. Haiti, in a similar way, has
become an epicenter of life-changing use of
media that has yet to be seen.
The threat of new media, however, is that
these innovative uses of what we consider
daily necessities will soon become too com
monplace, thus losing their emotional effect
and significance. What this tragedy has
shown, however, is the power that our mere
cell phones can wield when what truly mat
ters the human heart —is deeply en
gaged. As new channels of communication
open in the future, we must consider the ram
ifications of our actions in media. Do not let
the simplicity of donating or ease of learning
the breaking news cause us to forget the
human side of the story, or the value of reach
ing out to others in need. The real miracle
that has come out of this tragedy does not lie
in the design of a cell phone, but in the hearts
of those who have reached out, and continue
to reach out, to the people of Haiti.

What perhaps is most surprising about the
aid efforts is not the dollar amount that has
been raised, but the social significance of
these new media forms in starting and per
petuating the movement. Who would expect
the United States would find, among the
everyday minutiae of second by second
tweets and status updates, a heart aching for
the people of Haiti? As text messaging slow
ly erodes verbal communication from Eng
lish to acronym and status updates elevate
the trivial to earthshaking, the response to
aid Haiti casts a refreshing light on our media
obsession. While the Editorial Board still
holds mixed feelings about the long-term so
cial impact of digital media and networking,
the disaster of the last week has proven how
invaluable these resources may prove in a
crisis situation.
