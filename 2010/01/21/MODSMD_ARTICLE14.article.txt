# FLECHAS Y PEDRADAS
## Thanks, Massachusetts! â€“ Not. . . 
### 
In Spain, listening to people prattle on
about politics was an interesting diver
sion. 0.K., maybe not just a diversion;
more like a case study, an alternate universe
where history had run a different course and
now a different set of factors controlled the
political reality. Not unintelligible, just not
the same. The PP, former party of Bush's pal
Jose Maria Aznar, could gain seats on Zapa
tero's PSOE? Interesting, but I've got no
horse in that race. Jose Montilla, a non-native
speaker of Catalan, managed to lead the PSC
to victory and helm the Generalitat, the gov
erning body of Catluna? Even more compli
cated and less to do with me. Another soup of
abbreviations and another axis of political
alignment to worry about so much to
learn before I could even enter into an edu
cated debate, let alone have an informed
opinion.
Eventually I did, and I won't say it wasn't
rewarding, but, in the back of my mind, I al
ways knew I'd be leaving, and the results of
elections couldn't hurt me much. I said I was
a Barca fan while I was there too, but if they
lose the Liga I won't lose sleep. While I was
away, reading the political coverage on The
New York Times Web site was like receiving
dispatches from, well, a foreign land. It was
oddly comforting. I could check in on the fal
tering "progress" of Obama's health care ini
tiative like a basketball fan checking in on his
alma mater's team: hoping there would be
good news, but not passionately upset by re
peatedly unmet expectations.
That distance can be healthy. The older
brother of a high school friend of mine
stopped watching his beloved Indiana
Hoosiers a few years after he graduated.
He'd punched too many walls over missed
free throws to be much fun to hang out with
on game day. Now, though, he's a CPA, has a
girlfriend and lives in Zurich. To my knowl
edge, he's avoided an ulcer.
Trouble is sports and politics are different.
Sure, those trying to predict the outcomes of
either one struggle with an overwhelming
amount of statistical information and a
propensity to fetishize personal narrative.
More than that, talking about politics in
volves so many sports terms it's easy to forget
that's where they came from. Calling elec
tions "races" or "contests," talking about the
final push in a campaign as a "fourth quarter
drive," or calling an out-of-nowhere prospect
a "dark horse" candidate all that comes
from sports. Dark horse. That's what's came
up this Tuesday and it's what reminded me
just how different these two areas of Ameri
can life really are.
As a transplanted native of Indianapolis,
I'll be upset if the Indianapolis Colts don't
win the AFC Championship game this week
end. I've made an emotional investment in
the team's success, something that lets me

feel a sense of belonging and in return offers
elation with victory and despair with defeat.
I'd wager that there're folks in Vegas who
might be upset as well owing to, well,
"other" kinds of investments. But that's it.
Emotional pain and frustration for people
like me, some dollars down the drain for the
gamblers. Elections are different. Elections
change lives.
I don't know how Scott Brown's win in the
special election to replace the late Ted
Kennedy as Senator from Massachusetts will
impact America. As a Democrat, I suppose I
should feel like my team lost. Add to that, the
loss to Scott Brown, a candidate who man
aged, with his straightforward name, pickup
truck and general propensity for being shirt
less, to win "the people's seat," as he calls it.
When he takes his oath of office, he'll also be
doing away with the Democrat's filibuster
proof majority in the Senate. Populist rage, a
rejection of the Democratic agenda that's
how this will be characterized in the media
and, I imagine, by those who would see health
care reform shelved for another 15 years,
those who would be content with sitting
around and thumbing their nose at the na
tion's problems.
That can't happen.
Maybe I don't need to trouble myself with
the minutiae that constitute a political blog
ger's bread and butter. No need to punch
walls, no need to give myself an ulcer, but I
have to pay attention. I can't enact the annu
al coping mechanism of a Raiders fan and
self-impose a blackout of ESPN until next
season. I can't look away, because that means
avoiding the front page of every major news
paper. That means looking away from the re
ality of this country in which we live. And I
can't do that.
So thanks, Massachusetts. Thanks for re
minding me to pay attention, for reminding
me to stay involved. Thanks for all that, but
you can keep Scott Brown.

Patrick Kozey continues to hope that being po
litically informed can substitute for being polit
ically active. To let him know if you think that's
a cop-out or to lodge any other more general
complaints, e-mail him at pkozey@stanford.
