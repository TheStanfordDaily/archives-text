# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## How to Predict the Future and Alienate People 
### Emily Hulme 
Contrary to popular belief, "spontane
ity" is not fun.This belief, I think, main
ly comes from romantic comedies; not
only is it completely silly to consider parts of
the most contrived plot lines known to
mankind "spontaneous," it defies common
sense to think you would benefit from some
thing you didn't plan. Given the choice, we
pick what works best and make it a habit.
Spontaneous events, like rain in the middle
of a sunny day or a stock market crash, suck
mostly because they are not what we planned
for when setting out one day wearing Rain
bows to buy oil futures.
Prediction, then, is essential. There are
time-tested ways to augur, but, like all old
things, they only sort of work. For example,
sometimes birds fly in patterns because Zeus
told them to, but other times they are just ma
liciously screwing with you. Old women,
preferably with crooked noses, once were a
dependable source of information about the
beyond, but nowadays greener pastures fea
turing all you can eat dinner at 4 p.m. have
persuaded them to give up the trade in favor
of bridge. Shamefully, modern fortune telling
has been forced underground, exiled and
marginalized. Our society simply does not
provide an adequate demand for their skills.
Nonetheless, I am willing to fill this void
and put my credibility on the line for the fol

lowing predictions. In interest of transparen
cy, I must reveal my methods, even if this
takes away some of the magic: I am assuming
things will be basically the same in the next
year, only different. This is, I believe, the
method used by the AT&T advertisers in
their "You Will" series from 1993, which pre
dicted such innovations as GPS and Kindle,
although the amateurs screwed it up by call
ing them e-maps and e-books.

First of all, Gitmo will not be closed "one
year after," or one year and three days after.
California will remain broke and still will not
turn a budget in on time. Cheap beer will re
main popular among college students, until a
Seventh Heaven reunion episode decries the
practice of "beer ponging," leading to a pre
cipitous decline in amoral student behavior.
Cabo will be shuttered, but Vegas will remain
popular among divorcees who went to col
lege in what will be known retroactively as
the "Dark Ages."
MTV will begin playing music during day
light hours and Girls Gone Wild will be a doc
umentary on the Discovery Channel about
female zoologists searching for the elusive
ice tiger in the Congolese jungle. Companies
will continue to go putatively "green" when
making cost-cutting measures and/or charg
ing more for inferior products. Cash for
Clunkers, however, will not be extended. The

economy will recover, and Cabo will be re
born as an industrial city focusing on paper
goods and seal lion pelts. You will graduate.
Engineers will take us to Mars and, disap
pointingly, Martians will not be found. Never
missing an opportunity, Glenn Beck will run
a special on the program and either how it
signifies that America is the best or that
Barack Obama is a communist. Invited to
travel with the astronauts, Glenn Beck will
travel to Mars and be left there, Sarah Palin
will take over his time slot.
The New York Times will begin charging
for online articles in 2011, and critics will
lament they have sold their soul to save their
body. College students, in protest, will make a
Facebook group in order to express their
heartfelt anger. Rupert Murdoch will snicker.
As with all predictions, these require ac
tion to address their implications. I suggest
you start saving up free copies of The New
York Times on your hard drive and stuff an
emergency kit with a keepsake photo of
Glenn Beck, a couple cans of Keystone and a
list of Facebook contacts. It will be something
fun for your kids to find under your bed when
you, too, are old and at the home playing
bridge after eating dinner at four.
