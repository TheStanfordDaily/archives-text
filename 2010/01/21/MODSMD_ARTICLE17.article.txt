## COASTING INTO CORVALLIS Stanford women ride hot streak into Oregon 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal women's basketball team
starts its second conference road trip of the
season tonight against Oregon State at the
Gil Coliseum in Corvaliis.
Stanford (15-1,5-0 Pacific-10) comes into
this match riding the heat of a six game win
ning streak, whereas the Beavers (9-6, 1-4
Pac-10) have dropped their last four, sinking
to ninth in the conference after a very promis
ing beginning to the season.
On its best start since the 2002-03 season,
the No. 2 Cardinal has only lost one game
to No. 1 Connecticut, last year's NCAA
champions and the team that has kept Stan
ford off the top spot. Statistically, at least, it
enters tonight's contest as the favorite, but
perhaps that is not always the best place to
be.
Every team that faces the Card hopes that
they will be the one to take the prized scalp of
one of the best programs in the country and
perhaps this pressure is starting to show. Since
the second half of the Connecticut game, in
which the Huskies overturned Stanford's nar
row lead with a crushing 30-6 run, the team
seems to have struggled to play its best.
Injuries to key personnel are taking their
toll on the Card, as guards junior Jeanette
Pohlen and redshirt juniors J.J. Hones and
Melanie Murphy have all been sidelined in
some recent games.
"We count on Jeanette to push the ball for
us, we count on Mel [Murphy] to come in for
us and JJ, they are our three most experienced
and up until now most productive guards,"
said Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
While there is a chance that Pohlen and
Hones might be fit enough for tonight's game,
their absence could provide opportunities for
other players to step up and play themselves
into contention.
"We've got to have other people ready,"
VanDerveer said. "Our plan is to be ready
with [sophomore guard] Lindy [La Rocque]
and [redshirt junior forward] Michelle [Harri
son], [Junior forward] Ashley [Cimino]'s been
playing well, we're just trying to move people
around a little bit more.
"It is a challenge for our team. I'm hoping
that, obviously we want to get Jeanette, Mel
and J.J. back in some capacity and I really
think and hope that this is something that
will help us in the long run, but is painful in
the short run."
If all goes to according plan and the Cardi-

nal get another shot at Connecticut in March,
then the current difficulties could turn out to
be crucial in developing a good rotation of
players that will be robust enough to handle
the odd injury or off game. But before any of
that can happen there are a lot of minutes to
be played on court, a lot of points to be scored,
rebounds to be caught and games to be won.
The good news for Stanford in tonight's
game is that four members of the usual start
ing lineup should be ready. Sophomore for
ward Nnemkadi Ogwumike leads the Pac-10
in both points per game and field goal percent
age, with 19.3 percent and 64.1 percent respec
tively and is second on rebounds with 10.0 per
game. Closely behind her in the stats comes
junior forward Kayla Pedersen, third in points
per game and fifth in rebounds per game and
senior center Jayne Appel, fourth in both
points per game and rebounds per game.
In comparison, the highest Oregon State
players in the rankings are junior forward El
Sara Greer, first in offensive rebounds and
junior guard Talisa Rhea, fourth in points per
game. Greer's ability to pick up rebounds
could prove crucial tonight, given the fact that
the Cardinal has conceded so many in its last
two games.
Having started every game this year, red
shirt senior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude is also
turning into a crucial piece of the Stanford jig
saw. Gold-Onwude has scored in double fig
ures in the last three contests, perhaps justify
ing remaining in her place on the starting line
up even if and when the other guards return.
"Ros is doing what we always wanted and
hoped that Ros would do," VanDerveer said.
"Today in practice she was running our of-

GAME NOTES: Nearly-undefeated Stanford travels to Oregon
to face Oregon State tonight and Oregon on Saturday. Ore
gon State has recently betrayed their strong season start, los
ing four games in a row over the past two weeks. Cardinal
women, who lead the Pac-10 conference in 11 categories,
will hope to maintain their No. 2 national ranking.

While No. 2 Stanford extended its undefeated streak at home to 38 games last weekend, they
now hit the road to face Oregon State and Oregon. History rests on Stanford's side as it travel
to Corvallis tonight, as its overall record against the Beavers stands at 43-6.
While Oregon will struggle to
find an answer for Fields, Stanford
will hit its own stumbling block down
low.
"[Sophomore Andrew] Zimmer
man is out probably two to six weeks
with a stress fracture in his foot,"
Dawkins said in the Pac-10 telecon
ference. "It's unfortunate. You know,
he was starting to get our concepts
down and was playing fairly well for
us. He'll be missed."
Without Zimmerman the
Card's leading rebounder in the post
Stanford will rely solely on Jack
Trotter down low. At 6-foot-9 and
220, Trotter stands one inch and 22
pounds smaller than the Duck's can
didate, Michael Dunigan (11.8 ppg,
5.7 rebounds) and when in doubt,
Oregon will likely use him to ham
mer it inside.
Still, Oregon is currently on a
three-game losing streak of its own
in Pac-10 play and is by no means un
touchable. With this in mind,
Dawkins is staying optimistic about
the meeting. But his focus remains
on his own team and its ability to dic
tate play.
"Our team is really [as] capable of
beating anyone as Oregon,"
Dawkins said. "Oregon is a team that
scores the ball easily at times and so
they want a fast-paced game, they
want it to be up-tempo that's
something you need to be aware of

when you play them. You need to
make sure that you stay within your
tempo and within the framework of
what you're trying to do as a team."
If Stanford can do just that in
both games this weekend, it will not
only re-earn a winning record in the
conference, but also will feel a little

more prepared for two weeks on the
road.

The challenge begins when Stanford
tips off against the Beavers at 7 p.m.
tonight at Maples Pavilion.

After dropping two games on the road last weekend to both Washington
schools, Stanford men hope that two home games against Oregon State and
Oregon will help redeem their record. Both the Card and the Beavers are 8-9
and 3-2 in the Pac- 10. The Washington schools also swept Oregon State.
