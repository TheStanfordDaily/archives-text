# A 						WILDCAT CHALLENGE
## Arizona was last team to beat Stanford in 2008 dual meet 
### CHRIS DERRICK 
While the Stanford men's swimming
and diving team may have been exercising
restraint recently, the team will let loose
when the Arizona schools come to Avery
Aquatic Center this weekend.
The No. 4 Wildcats will be the tougher
opponent of the two teams. Last year the
Wildcats finished third in the Pacific-10
Conference behind Stanford and Califor
nia and sixth at the NCAA Champi

onships. Arizona swimmers have posted a
number of top marks this season and fea
ture prominently on the top times list. The
Wildcats' strength on paper is deceiving,
however; they rested and went for fast
times at the Texas Invitational on Dec. 3
and nearly all of their top 20 times on the
national list come from that meet. The No.
2 Cardinal, on the other hand, have yet to
rest prior to competition this year and in
all likelihood will not do so for this week
end.
Unlike other sports, swimming's regu
lar season results are not of paramount
importance because swimmers need to hit
an NCAA qualifying mark only once to go
to NCAA's. But this is not to say that the
Cardinal will not be out for blood this

weekend.
"Arizona will have a strong team at
NCAAs and so if you beat your rival in a
dual meet, you'll have a mental edge going
into the championship meets," explained
senior All-American David Dunford.
That is exactly what happened last year
when Stanford bested Arizona, 191-107
and then went on to top the Wildcats again
at the conference and national meets. That
win is part of a 14 dual meet winning
streak extending back to Jan. 28,2008. The
opponent that day: Arizona.
Both meets this weekend will help pre
pare the Cardinal men for the large post
season meets in March. According to


AUDRIE LIN/The Stanford Daily
Stanford hosts both Arizona teams this weekend in a pair of matches that will pit nationally ranked Cardinal swimmers
against their Wildcat counterparts. While the Wildcats boast swimmers with the fastest times in eight individual events,
Stanford has 22 swimmers ranked in the top 15 nationally. Last year, Stanford defeated Arizona 191-107.
Dunford, "Swimming back to back
meets is great preparation for Pac
10s and NCAAs where everyone has
to swim three days in a row."
Since Arizona State is considered
the easier opponent, the second day
of competition will likely feature top
athletes competing in some of their
weaker events. Stanford's confidence
should also provide some younger
members of the team with the chance
to thrive in the spotlight.
Some key match-ups this week
end will be 13-time Stanford All-
American junior Austin Staab and
Dunford in the freestyle sprints
against Ail-Americans Jordan B.
Smith and Nimrod Shapira Bar-Or.
Staab is also the NCAA champion
and current NCAA leader in the 100-
yard butterfly and will be counted on
to provide Stanford with a win and
nine points, in that event.
In the 100-yard and 200-yard
backstroke, senior Eugene Godsoe
will face off with Cory Chitwood in
what should be a tight race. While
Chitwood is top three in each event
this year, Godsoe is a ten-time All-
American and was Pac-10 champion
in both events last year. Newly mint
ed American record holder in the
800, sophomore Chad la Tourrette,
will face off with Jean Basson of Ari
zona in the distance freestyle swims
of 1000 and 500 yards. Basson is the
defending NCAA champion in the
500.
Arizona is also very strong in the
individual IM's and its top swimmer,
Jack Brown, will provide a strong
challenge to Stanford freshman
Mathew Thompson and junior Josh
Charnin-Aker. Cardinal breastro
kers sophomore Curtis Lovelace and
junior John Criste will also face stiff
competition from Arizona's duo of
Clark Burckle and Marcus Titus,
each of who are top three nationally
in the 100 and 200-yard breaststroke.
It should be a close and exciting
meet with lots of great competition.
Stanford hosts Arizona on Saturday
at 2 p.m. and Arizona State the fol
lowing day at 1 p.m.
