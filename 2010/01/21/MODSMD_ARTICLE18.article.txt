# A
						WILDCAT CHALLENGE
## Arizona was last team to beat Stanford in 2008 dual meet 
### CHRIS DERRICK 
While the Stanford men's swimming
and diving team may have been exercising
restraint recently, the team will let loose
when the Arizona schools come to Avery
Aquatic Center this weekend.
The No. 4 Wildcats will be the tougher
opponent of the two teams. Last year the
Wildcats finished third in the Pacific-10
Conference behind Stanford and Califor
nia and sixth at the NCAA Champi

onships. Arizona swimmers have posted a
number of top marks this season and fea
ture prominently on the top times list. The
Wildcats' strength on paper is deceiving,
however; they rested and went for fast
times at the Texas Invitational on Dec. 3
and nearly all of their top 20 times on the
national list come from that meet. The No.
2 Cardinal, on the other hand, have yet to
rest prior to competition this year and in
all likelihood will not do so for this week
end.
Unlike other sports, swimming's regu
lar season results are not of paramount
importance because swimmers need to hit
an NCAA qualifying mark only once to go
to NCAA's. But this is not to say that the
Cardinal will not be out for blood this

weekend.
"Arizona will have a strong team at
NCAAs and so if you beat your rival in a
dual meet, you'll have a mental edge going
into the championship meets," explained
senior All-American David Dunford.
That is exactly what happened last year
when Stanford bested Arizona, 191-107
and then went on to top the Wildcats again
at the conference and national meets. That
win is part of a 14 dual meet winning
streak extending back to Jan. 28,2008. The
opponent that day: Arizona.
Both meets this weekend will help pre
pare the Cardinal men for the large post
season meets in March. According to


AUDRIE LIN/The Stanford Daily
Stanford hosts both Arizona teams this weekend in a pair of matches that will pit nationally ranked Cardinal swimmers
against their Wildcat counterparts. While the Wildcats boast swimmers with the fastest times in eight individual events,
Stanford has 22 swimmers ranked in the top 15 nationally. Last year, Stanford defeated Arizona 191-107.
