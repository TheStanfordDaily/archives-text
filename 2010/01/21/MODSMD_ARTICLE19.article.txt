# Arizona trial will bring out the best
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a strong start to the season, the No. 3 Stanford
women's swimming and diving team (4-0, 0-0 Pacific-10
Conference) faces its stiffest test yet this weekend. No. 2 Ari
zona (6-0, 3-0 Pac-10) and Arizona State (6-3, 2-2 Pac-10)
will visit The Farm on Friday and Saturday respectively.
The meet against Arizona is the toughest dual meet re
maining on the Cardinal's schedule. Arizona is a perennial
powerhouse and Stanford's annual duel with the Wildcats is
usually the most anticipated dual meet on the schedule.
Last year, the Card defeated the Wildcats by a razor-thin
margin, winning 150.5-147.5 in Tucson, Ariz. Stanford was
trailing for most of the meet, but with five events remaining
the Cardinal stormed back to claim the victory. Junior Liz
Smith won the 200-yard breaststroke and the 400-yard indi
vidual medley and senior Elaine Breeden won the 100-yard
butterfly to bring Stanford close to victory. Senior swimmer
and Olympic medalist Julia Smit won the meet by .16 sec
onds in the final event, the 400-yard freestyle relay.
Both teams went on to finish the season among the coun
try's elite programs. At the NCAA Championships, the
Wildcats and the Cardinal finished third and fourth, respec
tively.
This year's meet figures to be just as close and exciting.
"It's a really tough matchup their strengths match up
with our strengths," said Stanford head coach Lea Maurer.

GAME NOTES: No. 3 Stanford hosts No. 2 Arizona in a meet that
will most likely be neck and neck throughout the afternoon. Both
in national polls and in their most recent competitions, only
small margins have separated the Card and the Wildcats.

"We anticipate a meet similar to last
year's. It will come down to who wins
the touchouts."
The teams enter this weekend
separated by just four points in the
national rankings and match up well
against each other. However, Maur
er isn't really focusing on the rank
ings table.
"We don't really pay attention to
them," she said. "We've had a big ri
valry [with Arizona] for the past few
years the meets always come
within 10 points. We're worried
about the rankings the day after."
"We don't put too much emphasis
on rankings heading into meets. I be
lieve your performance in a competi
tion says a lot more about what kind
of team you are than the rankings
before a meet," Breeden added.
While the Cardinal can usually
count on Smit, Breeden, Smith and
junior Kate Dwelley to deliver a cer
tain number of points in a meet, Ari
zona's top swimmers are in similar

events. Both teams have strong
freestyle relay squads in the 200, 400
and 800-yard distances. Breeden will
also face tough competition in her sig
nature event, the 200 fly, from Ari
zona's Ana Agy, Whitney Lopus and
Erin Campbell.
"We have some events that we
normally pencil in as wins, but their
big [swimmers] match up well against
ours," Maurer explained.
This weekend also marks the start
of Pac-10 competition for the team.
Arizona, Stanford and Southern Cal
ifornia are this year's top contenders
for the Pac-10 crown.
"I think that the fact that both
the Arizona and ASU meets are
conference meets signify that we
have entered a new phase of the
season where the quality of compe
tition increases," Dwelley said. "We
have to be prepared to race with
more intensity."
While Arizona is the main focus of
the weekend, the Cardinal still have
to face Arizona State, which is on a
three-meet winning streak going into
a meet at Berkeley on Friday.
When asked if Stanford would
keep the same intensity as the Ari
zona match on Saturday, Maurer re

sponded. "The pressure's on now. We
have to race, we have to sharpen our
focus and be able to handle the ele
ments."
"The focus of these meets is to
practice racing and work on the de
tails," Breeden said.
While these meets are certainly
significant, the main focus remains on
the all-important Pac-10 and NCAA
tournaments at the end of the season.
"Leading up to the meet we are not
doing anything special to prepare for
this meet in particular —we are
working hard in preparation for the
end of season meets," Dwelley com
mented.
"We always head into dual meets
with the goal of winning, but winning
dual meets is not as important of a
goal to our team as winning at the
championship meets," Breeden
added.
However, the team won't be dis
tracted during its dual meets.
"On Friday and Saturday the team
will be completely focused on the task
at hand ... racing Arizona and Ari
zona State," Dwelley said.

"Leading up to the meet we are not
doing anything special to prepare for
this meet in particular —we are
working hard in preparation for the
end of season meets," Dwelley com
mented.
"We always head into dual meets
with the goal of winning, but winning
dual meets is not as important of a
goal to our team as winning at the
championship meets," Breeden
added.
However, the team won't be dis
tracted during its dual meets.
"On Friday and Saturday the team
will be completely focused on the task
at hand ... racing Arizona and Ari
zona State," Dwelley said.
