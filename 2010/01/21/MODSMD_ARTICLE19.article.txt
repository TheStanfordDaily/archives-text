### KABIR SAWHNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a strong start to the season, the No. 3 Stanford
women's swimming and diving team (4-0, 0-0 Pacific-10
Conference) faces its stiffest test yet this weekend. No. 2 Ari
zona (6-0, 3-0 Pac-10) and Arizona State (6-3, 2-2 Pac-10)
will visit The Farm on Friday and Saturday respectively.
The meet against Arizona is the toughest dual meet re
maining on the Cardinal's schedule. Arizona is a perennial
powerhouse and Stanford's annual duel with the Wildcats is
usually the most anticipated dual meet on the schedule.
Last year, the Card defeated the Wildcats by a razor-thin
margin, winning 150.5-147.5 in Tucson, Ariz. Stanford was
trailing for most of the meet, but with five events remaining
the Cardinal stormed back to claim the victory. Junior Liz
Smith won the 200-yard breaststroke and the 400-yard indi
vidual medley and senior Elaine Breeden won the 100-yard
butterfly to bring Stanford close to victory. Senior swimmer
and Olympic medalist Julia Smit won the meet by .16 sec
onds in the final event, the 400-yard freestyle relay.
Both teams went on to finish the season among the coun
try's elite programs. At the NCAA Championships, the
Wildcats and the Cardinal finished third and fourth, respec
tively.
This year's meet figures to be just as close and exciting.
"It's a really tough matchup their strengths match up
with our strengths," said Stanford head coach Lea Maurer.

GAME NOTES: No. 3 Stanford hosts No. 2 Arizona in a meet that
will most likely be neck and neck throughout the afternoon. Both
in national polls and in their most recent competitions, only
small margins have separated the Card and the Wildcats.
