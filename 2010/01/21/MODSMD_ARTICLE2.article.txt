## Controversial special fees bill approved GSC rejects proposed amendment, passes original bill 
### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Regulation changes dominated Wednesday's
Graduate Student Council (GSC) meeting, with a
heated debate prior to passage of a special fees
bill recently passed by the Undergraduate
Senate and a discussion about amending cam
paign rules.
Special Fees Stalemate
On Tuesday, the ASSU Senate approved a bill
to end the practice that allowed student groups to
automatically receive a 10 percent increase to
their inflation-adjusted special fees funding.
The ongoing dispute over the legislation result
ed in several students' proposing an amendment
to revise the bill. The amendment was rejected
and the special fees bill was subsequently passed
by the GSC by an overwhelming margin.
Still, the bill resulted in heated debate.
GSC members entertained ideas of changing
the bylaw to include an annually adjusted
amount, maintaining the automatic 10 percent
increase, or voting down the proposals entirely.
Doctoral candidate in computer science Adam
Beberg proposed an amendment that the auto
matic increase amount be determined each year
by relevant legislative bodies. The bill in question
proposed cutting automatic increases completely.
Chief Financial Officer and graduate student
in chemical engineering Ryan Peacock empha
sized the overall importance of accountability for
student groups. "We need to keep in mind that it's
a privilege for groups to do special fees," he said.
"I think we're being too sympa
thetic to them, and I think that's the
problem," Peacock added.
But Beberg commented that the
extended process of petitions for
any increase beyond inflation would
cause groups to be discouraged to
petition, thereby reducing program
ming.
GSC members decided to vote
after examining pros and cons.
Twelve members opposed and one
abstained on Beberg's proposed
amendment.
The original bill, which strikes
the 10 percent automatic increase
clause completely, was approved
with 10 members in favor, one
opposed and two abstaining.
"The Undergraduate Senate
needs to start saying no [to special
fees increases]," said GSC
Programming Coordinator and
third-year student in electrical engi
neering Addy Satija. "This change
will just keep them accountable."
Campaign Fairness
Elections commissioner Quinn
Slack 'll proposed two changes to
election regulations. The first
change concerned campaign flyers:
Slack proposed to remove the stick
ers-regulated flyer limit and hand
over the issue to environmental
groups.
"Green student groups can make
this into an environmental issue,"
Slack said, "rather than a mundane
enforcement issue."
Co-chair Eric Osborne, a third
year law student, responded to the
idea: "The green student groups
can't enforce like 50 students from
going crazy with flyers," he said.
Adamant about not allowing a
change in the current sticker policy,
ASSU President David Gobaud
brought up issues of sustainability
and equality. According to Gobaud,
a co-terminal student in computer
science, lifting the regulation will
result in too many flyers and an
unfair advantage for students with
more money to spare.

"We need to level the playing
field for those who don't have a lot

of money to spend on the election,"
Gobaud said. "The election should
not be determined by the ones who
have the most money. Anyone
should be able to enter the race and
have a fair chance of winning
regardless of their socioeconomic
background."
The second change concerned
campaigning time limits. Currently,
students are not allowed to continue
campaigning while students are vot
ing. The proposed change would lift
the buffer time.
Secrecy and privacy also were
brought up in the discussion.
Determined not to allow this second
change to happen, Gobaud insisted
that capping campaigning during
elections allows people to have a
clearer mind.
"If you have someone going
around campaigning during the
election, then you'll have certain sit
uations that are going to be very
uncomfortable," he said. "There's
peer pressure. We should not open
the elections to be controlled by
peer pressure,"
Because of the controversy sur
rounding the issue, Osborne decided
to hold a straw poll. The flyer
enforcement change was deter
mined to be unpopular, while the
vote on letting candidates campaign
until the day of voting split evenly.
Revision will not be made until
further discussion.
Fundraising and Fund Approvals
Before discussion of special fees
and campaigns, the meeting began
with ASSU updates. After
announcing that there will be a
joint legislative meeting on Feb. 17
at 6 p.m., the executives went on to
talk about their fundraising efforts
in Haiti.
According to Gobaud, the cam
paign has generated $24,000 from
the Stanford community in less than
72 hours and $150,000 from 17 part
ner schools in less than four days.
"It's very powerful," Gobaud
said of the campus response. "All
donations will be going to Partners
in Health to help the earthquake
victims."
The upbeat sentiment contrasted
with concerns raised Tuesday at the
meeting of the Undergraduate
Senate, where the focus was on
increasing student donations

believed to be anemic compared to
other participating institutions.
The meeting continued with
funding requests from five student
groups. The GSC approved $1,974
for the Beyond Borders Beyond
Identity event held by Southeast
Asian student groups, $1,330 for the
Chinese Women Collective, $B2O for
the Stanford India Association, $7OO
for the Coastal Society and $250 for
the French Stanford Students

Association.
Programming and operations fol
lowed funding requests. The mas
querade ball ticket sales have
steadily increased, with 898 people
projected to come. Attendance for
the ball will be capped at 1,100 peo
ple.
Members went on to discuss
what to do with a ping-pong table
purchased by the GSC approxi
mately three years ago. After brief

discussion, they voted to sell the
table and direct the money back
into the GSC programming funds
account.
Elicia Blackford M.A. 'lO, a
Stanford Teacher Education
Program (STEP) student, was con
firmed as the executive director of
the student services division.
