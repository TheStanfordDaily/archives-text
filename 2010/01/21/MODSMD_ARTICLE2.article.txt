### BRIANNA PANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Regulation changes dominated Wednesday's
Graduate Student Council (GSC) meeting, with a
heated debate prior to passage of a special fees
bill recently passed by the Undergraduate
Senate and a discussion about amending cam
paign rules.
Special Fees Stalemate
On Tuesday, the ASSU Senate approved a bill
to end the practice that allowed student groups to
automatically receive a 10 percent increase to
their inflation-adjusted special fees funding.
The ongoing dispute over the legislation result
ed in several students' proposing an amendment
to revise the bill. The amendment was rejected
and the special fees bill was subsequently passed
by the GSC by an overwhelming margin.
Still, the bill resulted in heated debate.
GSC members entertained ideas of changing
the bylaw to include an annually adjusted
amount, maintaining the automatic 10 percent
increase, or voting down the proposals entirely.
Doctoral candidate in computer science Adam
Beberg proposed an amendment that the auto
matic increase amount be determined each year
by relevant legislative bodies. The bill in question
proposed cutting automatic increases completely.
Chief Financial Officer and graduate student
in chemical engineering Ryan Peacock empha
sized the overall importance of accountability for
student groups. "We need to keep in mind that it's
a privilege for groups to do special fees," he said.
