## Hoping for hometown luck Stanford returns home to face Oregon teams 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
As it watched its record slip to 1-6 on
the road with back-to-back losses at
Washington and Washington State last
weekend, the Stanford men's basketball
learned the hard way that there's really
no place like home. Luckily for the Car
dinal (8-9,2-3 Pac-10), the team returns
to Maples before its next shot at Pacific
-10 Conference opponents, as it takes on
Oregon State (8-9,2-3 Pac-10) and Ore
gon (10-7,2-3 Pac-10) on Thursday and
Saturday, respectively.

Although it's still early in conference
play, Stanford is looking for a boost
back toward the top of the Pac-10 stand
ings this time last week Fields, Green
& Co. was tied for the top spot and now
it jointly holds down the bottom. More
significantly, the Cardinal heads on its
longest road trip of the season (four
games) after the Oregon schools come
to town. If the past is any indication,
Stanford can clearly use all the momen
tum and confidence it can muster before
venturing outside the confines of Cam
pus Loop.
In the meantime, head coach Johnny
Dawkins stays focused on the more re
assuring 7-2 record the Cardinal has
built at home and knows the team is de
termined to improve upon it further.
"For us to continue to grow, [it's im
portant] for us to defend our home
court," Dawkins said. "That's something
we talked about earlier in the season
and our kids have taken pride in that, so
we have to go out this week and do the
same thing. [We have to] take it one
game at a time, go out there and put
everything on the court on Thursday
and come back and do the same thing on
Saturday."
The first chance the Cardinal will
have to do this is against the Beavers.
Last season, Oregon State won both
meetings with Stanford, but the Card
should have an edge this time around.
The Beavers return a starting lineup
chock-full of upperclassmen, so experi
ence alone could pose a challenge to
Stanford's youth. But, even the young
'uns on Stanford's side of the court are
able to support the team, as sophomore
guard Jeremy Green (17.4 points per
game) should easily handle Oregon
State guard Calvin Haynes (11.7 ppg).
Senior forward Landry Fields (21.5 ppg,
8.7 rebounds per game) should also be
under matched against small forward
Seth Tarver, who averages 11.6 ppg and
leads the conference in steals with near
ly three per game,
Dawkins recognizes the Beavers' tal
ent, but knows that Stanford's biggest
opponent may be itself namely, its
ability to execute its own game plan
properly.
"Oregon State is a good team.
They're going to play a Princeton-style
offense and defense, 1-3-1, match-up 2-3
zone, some man-to-man and they're
good at it," he said. "They have some ex
perience these kids have been
around for a while now. We need to exe
cute very well against their zones and
we also need to really defend their
Princeton offense."
But, Stanford's tougher game will
come Saturday against Oregon. Senior
guardTajuan Porter (12.8 ppg) is a quick
though little point guard who has
run the Ducks offense for the last four
years.
His young sidekick, sophomore Mal
colm Armstead, might overshadow him
though just barely in a literal sense at
6 feet throwing up another 11.5 ppg
and also giving the Ducks 4.24 assists
per game and 2 steals.

GAME NOTES: Stanford men's basketball returns
home after a two-game losing streak in Wash
ington last weekend. Last year, the Cardinal went
3-1 against Oregon State, and this year, the
Beavers present a strong offense, leading the
Pac-10 in steals. Stanford will look to boost their
rankings this weekend while on the home court.

fense, our zone offense, talking and she
is playing great. Maybe this is some
thing really good to come out of our
guard problem she is playing
great."
"One thing that she has to do is
eliminate turnovers," VanDerveer
added. "If she can eliminate those
turnovers, then we're talking about
being a championship-type guard."
Stanford looks to extend its 19-
game winning streak against Oregon
State tonight at 7 p.m.
