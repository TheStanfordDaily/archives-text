## FROM THE FARM TO THE NFL 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Evan Moore was at home, rehabbing a
broken hand, when he got the call.
The Cleveland Browns were interested in his
services.
It may have just been for their practice squad,
but after sustaining two training camp injuries
with the Green Bay Packers in consec
utive years, the last one ending in a
settlement that severed his tie to

the team, the Browns presented a fresh start.
And so, on Nov. 10, in a move relegated to the
footnotes of NFL transactions, Moore was
signed to Cleveland's scout team to be one of
eight players who practiced with the Browns
without being on the 53-man roster.
Moore was activated on Dec. 5; on Dec. 6, he
led Cleveland in receiving 6 catches for 80
yards in a close loss to powerful San Diego.
By the beginning of January, he was the Browns'
leading receiving tight end and a revelation for a
franchise that badly needed one. In just five
games which coincided with a 4-1 record for
Cleveland he tallied 12 receptions for
158 yards.
"It's been a crazy road, but everything
happens for a reason," Moore said.
Indeed.
Moore was a member of the
Stanford Cardinal from 2003-2007.
A 6-foot-7 wide receiver from
Brea, Calif., Moore finished his ca
reer with 103 receptions and 12
touchdowns despite missing over
a year with various injuries.
Briefly a two-sport athlete, he
was a member of the Car
dinal basketball team
when it was ranked No. 1
in the nation. In football,
he was a notable contrib-
utor during his senior
season, when he was sec
ond on the team in catches
and third in yards; his final
game was a four reception,
36-yard performance in an
upset win over Cal in the Big
Game.
But, like the rest of his eli
gible Cardinal teammates,
Moore sat through the 2008
NFL Draft without hearing
his name called.
r That's when his journey
began.
He was signed as an undrafted free
agent by the Packers and immediately
switched positions from wide receiver to
tight end.
"I knew it was something that would
happen," he said about the change. "It was
something I was looking forward to."
"My advantage at wide receiver was
my size and ability to catch the ball," he con

tinued. The issue for Moore was that, when
going against faster and nifty defense backs on
the outside, those traits become harder to utilize.
But at tight end, that skill set is optimal.
"Those abilities can be taken advantage of
with the hand on the ground going against line
backers," he said. "It's an immediate mismatch."
Moore entered training camp with the Pack
ers and was off to a good start when he sus
tained a left MCL injury in the third week. He
was immediately placed on injured reserve,
which meant that he was ineligible to play for
the rest of 2008, but that he would stay with
Green Bay.
"It was a blessing in disguise, since it was es
sentially a redshirt year," he said. "I was able to
put on the weight necessary to play tight end."
Moore went from 235 to 250 pounds and was
optimistic about his chances in 2009. But once
again, the injury bug struck he broke his hand
and, instead of going back on IR, he reached a
settlement and was released from his contract.
After rehab, he went to the Browns, where he
immediately gelled with quarterback Brady
Quinn.
"I knew Brady in college and I got to know
A.J. Hawk [Quinn's brother-in-law and a line
backer for the Packers] in Green Bay," Moore
said. "Brady had success with tight ends at Notre
Dame and he kept going to me in practice. The
coaches noticed."
Still, Moore was only on the scout team and
had been with Cleveland for a relatively short
amount of time. But he took a different perspec
tive.
"I figured that 1 had nothing to lose after
being picked up mid-season," he said. "I used
those few weeks to quickly learn the offense."
In the days before the San Diego contest,
Moore started to get a feeling that he might be
elevated to the active roster. The first official no
tice came from head coach Eric Mangini two
days before the matchup.
"Coach was showing some clips and mine
came up. He said to me, 'You're going to be
doing this in the game.' It wasn't overwhelming
or anything, but it was a long time coming."
When game time came around, Moore's
nerves reached their peak, but, with specific
plays drawn up for him, he was also confident.
"I just wanted to get a catch and get hit and
all of that would go away."
He didn't have to wait long. Quinn hit Moore

three times on the Browns' opening
drive. Quinn would find Moore an
other three times and Moore even
showed off his blocking prowess on a
fourth quarter touchdown, adding a
key block to spring the runner.
That's an area of his game that he
hopes to improve this offseason, when
he has the opportunity to enter 2010
as the Browns' starting tight end.
"You have your receiving tight
ends and tight ends that can block in
the run game, I ended the season as
the receiving tight end, but my goal is
to become the complete tight end.
You don't want to be a situation guy,"

he said.
"In the NFL, you're always com
peting," Moore continued. "The guys
that were here before me had no idea
I was going to be there."
Despite his burgeoning career,
Moore still chats with old Cardinal
teammates like Trent Edwards, Greg
Camarillo and Mark Bradford and,
of course, finds time to root for his
alma mater, be it in a bowl game ("I
wish it was something I could have
been a part of") or against tradition
al rivals.
"I was by myself in an Ohio sports
bar watching the USC game," he
said," and I don't think I've ever left
somewhere with that big of a smile
on my face."

signed to Cleveland's scout team to be one of
eight players who practiced with the Browns
without being on the 53-man roster.
Moore was activated on Dec. 5; on Dec. 6, he
led Cleveland in receiving 6 catches for 80
yards in a close loss to powerful San Diego.
By the beginning of January, he was the Browns'
leading receiving tight end and a revelation for a
franchise that badly needed one. In just five
games which coincided with a 4-1 record for
Cleveland he tallied 12 receptions for
158 yards.
"It's been a crazy road, but everything
happens for a reason," Moore said.
Indeed.
Moore was a member of the
Stanford Cardinal from 2003-2007.
A 6-foot-7 wide receiver from
Brea, Calif., Moore finished his ca
reer with 103 receptions and 12
touchdowns despite missing over
a year with various injuries.
Briefly a two-sport athlete, he
was a member of the Car
dinal basketball team
when it was ranked No. 1
in the nation. In football,
he was a notable contrib-
utor during his senior
season, when he was sec
ond on the team in catches
and third in yards; his final
game was a four reception,
36-yard performance in an
upset win over Cal in the Big
Game.
But, like the rest of his eli
gible Cardinal teammates,
Moore sat through the 2008
NFL Draft without hearing
his name called.
r That's when his journey
began.
He was signed as an undrafted free
agent by the Packers and immediately
switched positions from wide receiver to
tight end.
"I knew it was something that would
happen," he said about the change. "It was
something I was looking forward to."
"My advantage at wide receiver was
my size and ability to catch the ball," he con

tinued. The issue for Moore was that, when
going against faster and nifty defense backs on
the outside, those traits become harder to utilize.
But at tight end, that skill set is optimal.
"Those abilities can be taken advantage of
with the hand on the ground going against line
backers," he said. "It's an immediate mismatch."
Moore entered training camp with the Pack
ers and was off to a good start when he sus
tained a left MCL injury in the third week. He
was immediately placed on injured reserve,
which meant that he was ineligible to play for
the rest of 2008, but that he would stay with
Green Bay.
"It was a blessing in disguise, since it was es
sentially a redshirt year," he said. "I was able to
put on the weight necessary to play tight end."
Moore went from 235 to 250 pounds and was
optimistic about his chances in 2009. But once
again, the injury bug struck he broke his hand
and, instead of going back on IR, he reached a
settlement and was released from his contract.
After rehab, he went to the Browns, where he
immediately gelled with quarterback Brady
Quinn.
"I knew Brady in college and I got to know
A.J. Hawk [Quinn's brother-in-law and a line
backer for the Packers] in Green Bay," Moore
said. "Brady had success with tight ends at Notre
Dame and he kept going to me in practice. The
coaches noticed."
Still, Moore was only on the scout team and
had been with Cleveland for a relatively short
amount of time. But he took a different perspec
tive.
"I figured that 1 had nothing to lose after
being picked up mid-season," he said. "I used
those few weeks to quickly learn the offense."
In the days before the San Diego contest,
Moore started to get a feeling that he might be
elevated to the active roster. The first official no
tice came from head coach Eric Mangini two
days before the matchup.
"Coach was showing some clips and mine
came up. He said to me, 'You're going to be
doing this in the game.' It wasn't overwhelming
or anything, but it was a long time coming."
When game time came around, Moore's
nerves reached their peak, but, with specific
plays drawn up for him, he was also confident.
"I just wanted to get a catch and get hit and
all of that would go away."
He didn't have to wait long. Quinn hit Moore

three times on the Browns' opening
drive. Quinn would find Moore an
other three times and Moore even
showed off his blocking prowess on a
fourth quarter touchdown, adding a
key block to spring the runner.
That's an area of his game that he
hopes to improve this offseason, when
he has the opportunity to enter 2010
as the Browns' starting tight end.
"You have your receiving tight
ends and tight ends that can block in
the run game, I ended the season as
the receiving tight end, but my goal is
to become the complete tight end.
You don't want to be a situation guy,"

he said.
"In the NFL, you're always com
peting," Moore continued. "The guys
that were here before me had no idea
I was going to be there."
Despite his burgeoning career,
Moore still chats with old Cardinal
teammates like Trent Edwards, Greg
Camarillo and Mark Bradford and,
of course, finds time to root for his
alma mater, be it in a bowl game ("I
wish it was something I could have
been a part of") or against tradition
al rivals.
"I was by myself in an Ohio sports
bar watching the USC game," he
said," and I don't think I've ever left
somewhere with that big of a smile
on my face."
