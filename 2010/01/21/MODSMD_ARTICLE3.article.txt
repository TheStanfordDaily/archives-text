# China hacks student e-mails
## Third party overseas breaks into Free Tibet students' Gmail accounts 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
When Tenzin Seldon 'l2 logged into
her Gmail account from New York over
winter break, she had no idea that some
one else was also logged into her account

from China. Nor did she know that
she had become part of Google's investi
gation into a suspected widespread
cyber-attack program potentially central
ized across the Pacific.

Seldon, a regional coordinator of New
York-based Students for a Free Tibet, is
one of dozens of human rights activists
whose Gmail account had been spied on
by a third party in China, according to a
Jan. 12 statement from Google, But only
two Gmail accounts were accessed by
hackers.

"If they're willing to put so much of
their resources into monitoring a 20-
year-old like me from Stanford, who's an
activist, that means I'm really doing my

job," Seldon said. "I'm being an activist
for those people who need their voices to
be amplified."
On Jan. 7, University officials contact
ed Seldon to inform her that her private
Gmail account had been hacked, Seldon
said. The official, whose confidentiality
Seldon chose to protect, directed her to
contact David Drummond, senior vice

The Gmail account of Tenzin Seldon '12, a regional coordinator of New York-based Students for a Free Tibet, was spied on by a
third party in China. The repeated infiltrations reported by other businesses have led Google to move toward ending its business
operations there.
