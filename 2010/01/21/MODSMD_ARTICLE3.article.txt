# China hacks student e-mails
## Third party overseas breaks into Free Tibet students' Gmail accounts 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
When Tenzin Seldon 'l2 logged into
her Gmail account from New York over
winter break, she had no idea that some
one else was also logged into her account

from China. Nor did she know that
she had become part of Google's investi
gation into a suspected widespread
cyber-attack program potentially central
ized across the Pacific.

Seldon, a regional coordinator of New
York-based Students for a Free Tibet, is
one of dozens of human rights activists
whose Gmail account had been spied on
by a third party in China, according to a
Jan. 12 statement from Google, But only
two Gmail accounts were accessed by
hackers.

"If they're willing to put so much of
their resources into monitoring a 20-
year-old like me from Stanford, who's an
activist, that means I'm really doing my

job," Seldon said. "I'm being an activist
for those people who need their voices to
be amplified."
On Jan. 7, University officials contact
ed Seldon to inform her that her private
Gmail account had been hacked, Seldon
said. The official, whose confidentiality
Seldon chose to protect, directed her to
contact David Drummond, senior vice

The Gmail account of Tenzin Seldon '12, a regional coordinator of New York-based Students for a Free Tibet, was spied on by a
third party in China. The repeated infiltrations reported by other businesses have led Google to move toward ending its business
operations there.
president and chief legal officer at
Google.
"He immediately told me that
my e-mail had been compromised,"
Seldon said. "They knew for a fact
that it was someone in China
because they could trace the I.P.
address."
Martin Lev, Google's director of
security and safety, came to her
dorm to pick up her laptop and test
it for malware later that evening, she
said. Two days later, Seldon was
informed that her computer con
tained no malware or viruses, a sur
prising fact given that private infor
mation, like Seldon's password, is
usually accessed through spyware
placed on the user computer.
"This meant that someone from
China actually had access to my
password," Seldon said.
Online accounts are commonly
compromised when users have an
easily guessed password, use the
same password on multiple comput
er accounts, or use a kiosk-style
computer, according to Matthew
Ricks, executive director of the divi
sion of IT services that includes
Stanford's e-mail services.
Seldon, however, has the caution
of someone with years of experi
ence as a Tibetan activist. She was
born and raised in Dharamsala,
India, where the Tibetan govern
ment in exile is located. Her parents
took asylum there after fleeing
Tibet on foot, she said.
Seldon has been active in
Students for a Free Tibet since high
school. Over the years, she has seen
the organization's Web sites and

blogs defaced with "F*** Tibet" by
hackers. Seldon said she has even
received death threats in the past.
During the March 2008 demon
strations in Tibet, pro-Tibet human
rights organizations saw a "dramatic
increase in cyber attacks," according
to Kate Woznow, deputy director of
Students for a Free Tibet. False e
mails were sent in the name of
group members, and cell and office
phones were jammed.
During the Olympics Games in
Beijing later that year, cyber attacks
continued. Tenzing Tethong, a visit
ing Tibetan scholar at Stanford, said
that during that time his e-mail con
tacts were somehow accessed and
his acquaintances received e-mails
from an account in his name.
Tethong also uses Gmail and to his
knowledge, his e-mail has not been
hacked.
Woznow recalls that an online
security contractor told her they had
never seen that number or type of
attack before, adding that it clearly
was an organized, concerted
attempt to gather information and
decrease the group's efficiency.
The attack on Seldon's Gmail
account is different than previous
cyber attacks, Woznow said.
"What's really unique about
Seldon's case is that... they could
n't find any malware, so this is a new
level, a new wave of these kinds of
cyber attacks," she said. "And the
fact that Google users were targeted
makes this pretty unique because
Google prides itself on security."
A source from Google familiar
with the investigation, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity, con
firmed Seldon's account. The
Google source believed Seldon was
a victim of a sophisticated malware
that erases itself from the comput
er's hard drive after accessing pass

words and information. Google was
not able to comment further on
other victims of hacking due to the
ongoing investigation.

Google announced on Jan. 12
that it was considering ending its
business operations and filtering in
China. According to Google, at least
20 other companies covering a wide
range of businesses have also been
targets of cyber attacks and surveil
lance. These other companies,
including Yahoo! and Adobe, have
not said they will end business rela
tions with China.
"The environment in which
we're operating in terms of China is
not getting better," the Google
source said. "So, we're no longer
comfortable filtering search results."
President John Hennessy, who
sits on Google's board of directors,
said in an e-mail to The Daily that
"the Google decision was a difficult
one for the company, but in the end,
the company felt that staying in
China could endanger its users and
potentially its employees."
Hennessy believes that e-mail
infiltration is an obvious concern
that students need to both under
stand and take steps to better pro
tect themselves against.
Seldon, who in high school
protested the launch of Google
China, now applauds the corpora
tion for taking a stand for what she
called "freedom, equality and jus
tice."
"I feel like the fact that I am all
the way here in America and I'm a
U.S. citizen, and China can impede
on my rights to personal freedom
and my rights to know that I won't
be spied on, tells me something
about the government," she said.

When Tenzin Seldon 'l2 logged into
her Gmail account from New York over
winter break, she had no idea that some
one else was also logged into her account

from China. Nor did she know that
she had become part of Google's investi
gation into a suspected widespread
cyber-attack program potentially central
ized across the Pacific.

Seldon, a regional coordinator of New
York-based Students for a Free Tibet, is
one of dozens of human rights activists
whose Gmail account had been spied on
by a third party in China, according to a
Jan. 12 statement from Google, But only
two Gmail accounts were accessed by
hackers.

"If they're willing to put so much of
their resources into monitoring a 20-
year-old like me from Stanford, who's an
activist, that means I'm really doing my

job," Seldon said. "I'm being an activist
for those people who need their voices to
be amplified."
On Jan. 7, University officials contact
ed Seldon to inform her that her private
Gmail account had been hacked, Seldon
said. The official, whose confidentiality
Seldon chose to protect, directed her to
contact David Drummond, senior vice

The Gmail account of Tenzin Seldon '12, a regional coordinator of New York-based Students for a Free Tibet, was spied on by a
third party in China. The repeated infiltrations reported by other businesses have led Google to move toward ending its business
operations there.
president and chief legal officer at
Google.
"He immediately told me that
my e-mail had been compromised,"
Seldon said. "They knew for a fact
that it was someone in China
because they could trace the I.P.
address."
Martin Lev, Google's director of
security and safety, came to her
dorm to pick up her laptop and test
it for malware later that evening, she
said. Two days later, Seldon was
informed that her computer con
tained no malware or viruses, a sur
prising fact given that private infor
mation, like Seldon's password, is
usually accessed through spyware
placed on the user computer.
"This meant that someone from
China actually had access to my
password," Seldon said.
Online accounts are commonly
compromised when users have an
easily guessed password, use the
same password on multiple comput
er accounts, or use a kiosk-style
computer, according to Matthew
Ricks, executive director of the divi
sion of IT services that includes
Stanford's e-mail services.
Seldon, however, has the caution
of someone with years of experi
ence as a Tibetan activist. She was
born and raised in Dharamsala,
India, where the Tibetan govern
ment in exile is located. Her parents
took asylum there after fleeing
Tibet on foot, she said.
Seldon has been active in
Students for a Free Tibet since high
school. Over the years, she has seen
the organization's Web sites and

blogs defaced with "F*** Tibet" by
hackers. Seldon said she has even
received death threats in the past.
During the March 2008 demon
strations in Tibet, pro-Tibet human
rights organizations saw a "dramatic
increase in cyber attacks," according
to Kate Woznow, deputy director of
Students for a Free Tibet. False e
mails were sent in the name of
group members, and cell and office
phones were jammed.
During the Olympics Games in
Beijing later that year, cyber attacks
continued. Tenzing Tethong, a visit
ing Tibetan scholar at Stanford, said
that during that time his e-mail con
tacts were somehow accessed and
his acquaintances received e-mails
from an account in his name.
Tethong also uses Gmail and to his
knowledge, his e-mail has not been
hacked.
Woznow recalls that an online
security contractor told her they had
never seen that number or type of
attack before, adding that it clearly
was an organized, concerted
attempt to gather information and
decrease the group's efficiency.
The attack on Seldon's Gmail
account is different than previous
cyber attacks, Woznow said.
"What's really unique about
Seldon's case is that... they could
n't find any malware, so this is a new
level, a new wave of these kinds of
cyber attacks," she said. "And the
fact that Google users were targeted
makes this pretty unique because
Google prides itself on security."
A source from Google familiar
with the investigation, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity, con
firmed Seldon's account. The
Google source believed Seldon was
a victim of a sophisticated malware
that erases itself from the comput
er's hard drive after accessing pass

words and information. Google was
not able to comment further on
other victims of hacking due to the
ongoing investigation.

Google announced on Jan. 12
that it was considering ending its
business operations and filtering in
China. According to Google, at least
20 other companies covering a wide
range of businesses have also been
targets of cyber attacks and surveil
lance. These other companies,
including Yahoo! and Adobe, have
not said they will end business rela
tions with China.
"The environment in which
we're operating in terms of China is
not getting better," the Google
source said. "So, we're no longer
comfortable filtering search results."
President John Hennessy, who
sits on Google's board of directors,
said in an e-mail to The Daily that
"the Google decision was a difficult
one for the company, but in the end,
the company felt that staying in
China could endanger its users and
potentially its employees."
Hennessy believes that e-mail
infiltration is an obvious concern
that students need to both under
stand and take steps to better pro
tect themselves against.
Seldon, who in high school
protested the launch of Google
China, now applauds the corpora
tion for taking a stand for what she
called "freedom, equality and jus
tice."
"I feel like the fact that I am all
the way here in America and I'm a
U.S. citizen, and China can impede
on my rights to personal freedom
and my rights to know that I won't
be spied on, tells me something
about the government," she said.
