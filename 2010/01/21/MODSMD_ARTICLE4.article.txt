## Author discusses rise of American research universities 
### CHRISTOPHER HART 
"I wanted to tell the story, in writing this
book, of how our university system became the
greatest in the world at producing new knowl
edge."

Jonathan R. Cole described the motivating
goal of his new book "The Great American
University: Its Rise to Preeminence, Its
Indispensable National Role, Why It Must Be

Protected" last night to a large audience at the
Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Cole, a professor of sociology at Columbia
University, came to Stanford as part of a nation
wide tour promoting his book, which was pub
lished earlier this month. Provost John
Etchemendy and Vice Provost and Dean of
Research Ann Arvin were in attendance for a
panel discussion following the presentation.
"This is an exciting time to be involved in

higher education," said Richard Sailer, dean of
Stanford's School of Humanities and Sciences,
introducing Cole.
"In 1997, there were 10 million students in
higher education throughout the world; today,
there are 100 million," Sailer said. "This is a
watershed moment in the creation of an edu
cated global workforce."
The rise of American research universities,
Cole argues, was brought on by an evolution in

the social structure of America and the radical
social upheaval of World War 11.
Cole said that in the beginning of the 20th
century, the rise of the idea that people's aca
demic and professional success should depend
on their talent alone suddenly made upward
social mobility possible for the poor of
America.

CAMPUS FLOODED: Intense rainfall, high winds, frequent lightning and a tornado warning rattled campus,
leaving some areas, such as the outside of Crothers Memorial, underwater. See more on dorm floods on page 3.
Then, following Hitler's systematic
destruction of the German university
system and occupation of greater
Europe, the U.S. saw a massive influx
of world-class researchers and schol
ars to aid and lead its rising talent. The
urgency and necessity of war
bringing about such focused and con
certed research efforts as the
Manhattan project cemented
America's preeminence in the cre
ation of knowledge.
"The American system was also
deeply committed to extraordinarily
great values," Cole said, which
ensured the promotion of free inquiry
and autonomy from the state.
Due in large part to these develop
ments, 80 percent of the top 20 univer
sities in the world are American. But,
Cole argued, "in the last decade,
American research institutions have
come under attack."

This attack, however, does not
come from the increasing quality of
education emerging in countries like
China or India. Cole emphasized that
other countries still have a long way to
go before overtaking American insti
tutions. And, he said, increased com
petition will only improve the quality
of American research. In fact, Cole
said, "the enemy is us."
The real threat, Cole said, is posed
by the increasing influence of politi
cal interests on academia. Cole high
lighted the adoption of anti-terror
ism legislation, such as the Patriot
Act, which restricted certain avenues
of research and made it a criminal
offense for students from blacklisted
countries to even set foot in, for
example, laboratories directly relat
ed to specific kinds of nuclear
physics. The well-publicized attempt
by the Bush administration to restrict
stem-cell research on ideological
grounds is another example of this
conflict.

"The extraordinarily great values,"
for Cole, are increasingly at risk. And,
Cole said, with the erosion of free

inquiry, "legislators must realize that
to rebuild excellence is far more cost
ly than to maintain it."
Etchemendy, in the follow-up dis
cussion, countered by saying that Cole
overemphasized the effect of political
restrictions on research in American
universities, arguing that most of the
negative affects are in fact borne by

the wider public.
But, he concluded, "Jon has writ
ten a wonderful book that should be
required reading for all the political
leadership of our country and [for]
anyone involved in academia."
