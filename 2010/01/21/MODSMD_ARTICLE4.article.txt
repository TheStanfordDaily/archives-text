## Author discusses rise of American research universities 
### CHRISTOPHER HART 
"I wanted to tell the story, in writing this
book, of how our university system became the
greatest in the world at producing new knowl
edge."

Jonathan R. Cole described the motivating
goal of his new book "The Great American
University: Its Rise to Preeminence, Its
Indispensable National Role, Why It Must Be

Protected" last night to a large audience at the
Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Cole, a professor of sociology at Columbia
University, came to Stanford as part of a nation
wide tour promoting his book, which was pub
lished earlier this month. Provost John
Etchemendy and Vice Provost and Dean of
Research Ann Arvin were in attendance for a
panel discussion following the presentation.
"This is an exciting time to be involved in

higher education," said Richard Sailer, dean of
Stanford's School of Humanities and Sciences,
introducing Cole.
"In 1997, there were 10 million students in
higher education throughout the world; today,
there are 100 million," Sailer said. "This is a
watershed moment in the creation of an edu
cated global workforce."
The rise of American research universities,
Cole argues, was brought on by an evolution in

the social structure of America and the radical
social upheaval of World War 11.
Cole said that in the beginning of the 20th
century, the rise of the idea that people's aca
demic and professional success should depend
on their talent alone suddenly made upward
social mobility possible for the poor of
America.
