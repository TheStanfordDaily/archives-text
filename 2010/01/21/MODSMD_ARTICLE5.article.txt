## Post-law job market looks stable Stanford Law School grads affected minimally by economy 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
No line of work has survived the reces
sion unaffected, even the high-paying,
once-booming legal industry. However,
Stanford Law School (SLS) administra
tors remain confident in the employment
prospects for their students who are
themselves generally positive about the
job market.
"Law Shucks," a blog that tracks the
legal industry, estimates that major law
firms laid off over 4,000 lawyers in 2009.
But Law School Dean Larry Kramer said
that while the job market is "tighter" now
than it has been, new lawyers will still find
it welcoming.
"The same bubble existed in the legal
market as in the rest of the economy,"
Kramer said. "Students graduating this
year and maybe next year have to deal
with the fallout from that. But I don't
foresee any long-term significant changes
in professional prospects for being a
lawyer."
In terms of finding employment, new
graduates from SLS have been insulated
from the effects of the recession so far,
according to statistics provided by the
school.
The class of 2008 was the first class to
experience the recession right out of law
school. Nine months after graduating,
only four members of the 176-person
class were unemployed. Though that rep
resents a drop from the 100 percent suc
cess rate of the classes of 2006 and 2007,
the decline is miniscule.
The employment numbers for the
most recent class, the class of 2009, will be
compiled this February. Though the Law
School expects most of that class to be
employed, there may be fewer graduates
than usual moving on to the largest law
firms.
"Last year there were a lot of defer
rals," Kramer said, referring to the prac
tice of firms offering jobs starting at a
future date rather than immediate
employment.
SLS is combating the economic down
turn in several ways, including putting stu
dents in touch with more firms than dur
ing previous recruitment cycles. Students
with deferred offers are being encour
aged to explore internships and clerk
ships in between graduation and the
start date at their future law firm.
The school is also tailoring its
career services advice specifically to
each class according to its vision of
how the job market will recover.
"Our Office of Career Services
staff is providing customized job
search support for all three classes
(2010, 2011, 2012)," SLS Associate
Director of Media Relations Judith
Romero wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily." Current law students appear
unruffled, if not particularly upbeat,
about their job prospects.
"It's not a great situation to be
graduating into," said third-year stu
dent Mike Scanlon. "But there's noth
ing you can do about it so you just
hope for the best."
"I know our class will suffer a lot
more than the year ahead [of us,]"
said another third-year, Mike Powers.
"There are a lot fewer offers. It
appears though that some firms are
pulling out and starting to open hiring
again."
"Of course, some firms are still lay
ing off," he added.
Kramer predicted a comprehen
sive economic recovery for the legal
industry by next year and second-year
students were more sanguine about
their opportunities.
"People my year feel like we've
been prepared from the beginning
and we've been bracing ourselves,"
said second-year student Jennifer
Clark. "It might be tough but I'm glad
I'm at Stanford. I can imagine that it's
been tougher for students from some
other schools."
To some new lawyers, the sup
posed hardships of a down job market
and deferrals are even seen as bless
ings in disguise.
Allison Hunter 'O4 graduated from
the University of Chicago Law School
last June. Her law firm offered her a
deferral, which she accepted, and she
is spending the year working with the
Volunteer Legal Services Program of
the San Francisco Bar Association.
Hunter said the opportunity has
made her deferral more than worth it.
"I think it's one of the best deci
sions I've ever made," Hunter said. "It
was a chance to get more hands-on
experience. It was a great opportunity
to try different things that I couldn't
do at the law firm."
Hunter said the effects of the
recession may end up diverting the
career paths of young lawyers away
from the big law firms.
"It'll be interesting to see what
happens, because I think what may
happen is that many attorneys will get
a taste of the pro-bono career and
decide to stay with it," Hunter said.
Romero echoed that viewpoint.
Though no one likes a recession, she
said the decline in opportunities at big
firms could encourage more creative
and rewarding job choices.
"We've been encouraging students
to think very broadly about their
careers, especially about their first job
out of law school," she wrote.
"Students should take the time to
determine their true professional pas
sion and follow a career path that
most directly leads them to that goal."
