## Post-law job market looks stable Stanford Law School grads affected minimally by economy 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
No line of work has survived the reces
sion unaffected, even the high-paying,
once-booming legal industry. However,
Stanford Law School (SLS) administra
tors remain confident in the employment
prospects for their students who are
themselves generally positive about the
job market.
"Law Shucks," a blog that tracks the
legal industry, estimates that major law
firms laid off over 4,000 lawyers in 2009.
But Law School Dean Larry Kramer said
that while the job market is "tighter" now
than it has been, new lawyers will still find
it welcoming.
"The same bubble existed in the legal
market as in the rest of the economy,"
Kramer said. "Students graduating this
year and maybe next year have to deal
with the fallout from that. But I don't
foresee any long-term significant changes
in professional prospects for being a
lawyer."
In terms of finding employment, new
graduates from SLS have been insulated
from the effects of the recession so far,
according to statistics provided by the
school.
The class of 2008 was the first class to
experience the recession right out of law
school. Nine months after graduating,
only four members of the 176-person
class were unemployed. Though that rep
resents a drop from the 100 percent suc
cess rate of the classes of 2006 and 2007,
the decline is miniscule.
The employment numbers for the
most recent class, the class of 2009, will be
compiled this February. Though the Law
School expects most of that class to be
employed, there may be fewer graduates
than usual moving on to the largest law
firms.
"Last year there were a lot of defer
rals," Kramer said, referring to the prac
tice of firms offering jobs starting at a
future date rather than immediate
employment.
SLS is combating the economic down
turn in several ways, including putting stu
dents in touch with more firms than dur
ing previous recruitment cycles. Students
