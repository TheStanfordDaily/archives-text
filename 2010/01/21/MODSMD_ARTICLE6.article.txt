## Water conservation plan unveiled Professors introduce Western water sustainability initiative 
### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
Amid torrents of rain and a thoroughly
drenched campus, esteemed emeritus professor of
history David Kennedy and law school professor
and Woods Institute Director Barton Thompson
ironically explained a new water conservation ini
tiative, in an event jointly sponsored by the Bill
Lane Center for the American West and the
Woods Institute for the Environment.
The proposed Stanford initiative the Joint
Program on Water in the West brings together
environmental researchers, historians, economists,
policy makers and engineers in an attempt to find
solutions to the unique water problems facing
California and the West.
"The irony is not lost on me, as I'm sure it's not
lost on you, that we're having this conversation
about water on one of the wettest days of the
year," Kennedy said, jumpstarting his talk with
audience laughter.
Wednesday evening's discussion, appropriately
held in the Yang & Yamazaki Energy &
Environment Building (Y2E2), explained the pri
mary goals of Water in the West. Kennedy and

Thompson, two of the leaders of the project,
showed the ways in which water issues have
shaped the western United States throughout his
tory, displayed the varied water problems facing
the region and explained potential scientific and
political solutions.
Approximately 60 personally-invited profes
sors, researchers and members of a water-focused
"Downstream the Colorado River: A Holistic
Examination of the Colorado River's
Contribution to Our Nation's Water and Energy"
spring break trip braved the rain to attend the
event.
"Water is definitional of the very character,
identity and fate of this region," Kennedy said.
Dressed in a red, penguin-covered tie, Kennedy
began by discussing what he calls the "Fabled
100 th meridian," west of this imaginary line,
nearly every state faces water problems. Further
slides showed how water influenced the settlement
of the West and the success of that settlement. The
West accounts for one-third of the nation's GDP
and half of the nation's integration with the emerg
ing Asian markets that may determine the future
of the world economy.
However, Kennedy emphasized that previous
success gives no guarantee of future safety.
"These systems worked, but these systems were
built almost uniformly by men born
in the 19th century ... with early- to
mid-20th century technology,"
Kennedy said. "Maybe we're
approaching a time of reckoning."
As he illustrated the dangers of
days ahead, Kennedy's next photo
caused numerous gasps throughout
the audience: a man standing next to
a pole many times his height, illus
trating how far the land itself sunk
between 1925 and 1977.

"In this area, the rock formations
collapse when the water is with
drawn [from underground
aquifers]," Kennedy explained.
Increased population in the West,
combined with lack of water moni
toring, drought and transportation
issues caused by the fact that most
water comes from northern
California, have aggravated
California's water problems over the
years. And the threat, initially caused
by stream depletion, to the state's
large number of endangered fresh
water fish species has decreased the
amount of water people can use.
"There is a growing sense that we
are facing a crisis in California," said
Jon Christensen, executive director
of the Bill Lane Center.
"But," he added, "a crisis is a ter
rible thing to waste,"
After Kennedy concluded his
portion of the talk, Thompson dis
cussed potential engineering solu
tions to California's water problems,
including specific initiatives planned
by Water in the West.
"Just like one of the best ways and
least expensive ways of generating
new energy is to conserve energy, the

same thing is true of water,"
Thompson said. "We've already done
a great job in the last 15 to 20 years of
conserving water in the western
United States... but there are still
significant opportunities for addi
tional conservation.
"One of the best ways to encour
age this type of conservation is
through economic incentives," he
added.
Thompson suggested a tiered sys
tem of charging for water, rather
than a flat fee system, so that those
who use more water are charged
more by the gallon. Scheduling irri
gation more efficiently could also
conserve water by up to 17 percent.
Agricultural use makes up 80 per
cent of California's water use a
situation that has caused many con
flicts over the years as urban centers
such as Los Angeles have grown.
"The one thing that always both
ered me with previous initiatives is
that they always focused heavily on
urban use, which is only 20 percent
[of total water usage]," Kennedy told
The Daily before the talk. "The real
gains are to be had in the agricultur
al sector."
At the end of his slideshow,
Thompson laid out three of Water in
the West's current concrete goals:
pioneering low-energy distributed
treatment systems, examining some
of the contaminants that make peo
ple wary of drinking recycled water
and getting rid of some of the institu
tional barriers that make water recla
mation difficult.
Several of the Water in the West
initiatives will be tested first on
Stanford campus dorms and then in
Palo Alto. Kennedy mentioned the
possibility of including the changes in
future "green dorms" to eventually
be built at Stanford. Students, he
said, can look forward to drinking

water in ways that might soon stretch
to the rest of the nation and then to
Australia and other arid regions of
the world.
Palo Alto officials, as well as

Australian researchers, are already in
cooperation with the program.

by stream depletion, to the state's
large number of endangered fresh
water fish species has decreased the
amount of water people can use.
"There is a growing sense that we
are facing a crisis in California," said
Jon Christensen, executive director
of the Bill Lane Center.
"But," he added, "a crisis is a ter
rible thing to waste,"
After Kennedy concluded his
portion of the talk, Thompson dis
cussed potential engineering solu
tions to California's water problems,
including specific initiatives planned
by Water in the West.
"Just like one of the best ways and
least expensive ways of generating
new energy is to conserve energy, the

same thing is true of water,"
Thompson said. "We've already done
a great job in the last 15 to 20 years of
conserving water in the western
United States... but there are still
significant opportunities for addi
tional conservation.
"One of the best ways to encour
age this type of conservation is
through economic incentives," he
added.
Thompson suggested a tiered sys
tem of charging for water, rather
than a flat fee system, so that those
who use more water are charged
more by the gallon. Scheduling irri
gation more efficiently could also
conserve water by up to 17 percent.
Agricultural use makes up 80 per
cent of California's water use a
situation that has caused many con
flicts over the years as urban centers
such as Los Angeles have grown.
"The one thing that always both
ered me with previous initiatives is
that they always focused heavily on
urban use, which is only 20 percent
[of total water usage]," Kennedy told
The Daily before the talk. "The real
gains are to be had in the agricultur
al sector."
At the end of his slideshow,
Thompson laid out three of Water in
the West's current concrete goals:
pioneering low-energy distributed
treatment systems, examining some
of the contaminants that make peo
ple wary of drinking recycled water
and getting rid of some of the institu
tional barriers that make water recla
mation difficult.
Several of the Water in the West
initiatives will be tested first on
Stanford campus dorms and then in
Palo Alto. Kennedy mentioned the
possibility of including the changes in
future "green dorms" to eventually
be built at Stanford. Students, he
said, can look forward to drinking

water in ways that might soon stretch
to the rest of the nation and then to
Australia and other arid regions of
the world.
Palo Alto officials, as well as

Australian researchers, are already in
cooperation with the program.

Emeritus professor of history David Kennedy introduces a new initiative with law school
professor and Woods Institute Director Barton Thompson to conserve water. The
initiative, called the Joint Program on Water in the West, will soon launch on campus.
