Amid torrents of rain and a thoroughly
drenched campus, esteemed emeritus professor of
history David Kennedy and law school professor
and Woods Institute Director Barton Thompson
ironically explained a new water conservation ini
tiative, in an event jointly sponsored by the Bill
Lane Center for the American West and the
Woods Institute for the Environment.
The proposed Stanford initiative the Joint
Program on Water in the West brings together
environmental researchers, historians, economists,
policy makers and engineers in an attempt to find
solutions to the unique water problems facing
California and the West.

Contribution to Our Nation's Water and Energy"
spring break trip braved the rain to attend the
event.
"Water is definitional of the very character,
identity and fate of this region," Kennedy said.
Dressed in a red, penguin-covered tie, Kennedy
began by discussing what he calls the "Fabled
100 th meridian," west of this imaginary line,
nearly every state faces water problems. Further
slides showed how water influenced the settlement
of the West and the success of that settlement. The
West accounts for one-third of the nation's GDP
and half of the nation's integration with the emerg

of the world economy.
However, Kennedy emphasized that previous
success gives no guarantee of future safety.
