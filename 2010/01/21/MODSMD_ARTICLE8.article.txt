## INTO THE ARCHIVES 
### STACIE CHAN STAFF WRITER 
From her office on the third
floor of Green Library,
overlooking the sprawling
campus, Aimee Morgan
reviews t-shirts, disserta
tions, turtle shells, pocket watches
and football programs.
Morgan who received both a
Masters of Science in Information
Science and a Masters in History
previously worked as an archivist at
Emory University in Atlanta.
As the Assistant University
Archivist at Stanford, she is primari
ly responsible for selecting which
documents from 2009 capture the
essence of the University.
"What will be important 20, 30
and even 40 years from now?" said

Morgan,
explaining
the criteria that
she uses to select
documents.
While every edition of the
University's major newspapers as
well as research publications, Board
of Trustee minutes and high-level
policy decisions are stored in the
archives, interesting trinkets also
find a home there. Located in stor
age spaces around the campus like
the Stanford Auxiliary Libraries,
these items hold age-old University
stories.

Most artifacts are stored in stan
dard cardboard boxes that are one
and-a-half feet tall when turned on
their sides. Morgan estimates that
there are around 30,000 of these
boxes and end-to-end, these boxes
would circle Campus Loop roughly
one and a half times. For extremely
delicate or oversized items, custom
boxes are constructed.
Within the vast assortment of
memorabilia, Morgan noted one of
her favorite items in the archives: a
dried turtle shell.

Leland Stanford's brother,
Thomas Welton Stanford, was an
active participant in the spiritu
alist movement during the
Victorian era. He believed that he
could make contact with people who
had passed away and often held
seances to communicate with them.
Items from the seances found their
way into the archives, including the
turtle shell of a green-skinned
intruder on one of these spiritual
interactions.
Another item that Morgan
recalled was a priceless piece of jew
elry that once belonged to Jane
Stanford. Following her husband's
death, Jane was the sole individual
responsible for running the
University and she was determined
to keep it afloat. Rumor has it that
she sold her jewel collection to buy
coal to heat students' dorm rooms
and provide other residential neces
sities. To this day, a "jewel fund" still
exists to purchase books for stu
dents.
In actuality, Jane Stanford did sell
her jewels, but not during this finan
cial crisis.
"Years later, the pocket watch
from her collection was found on
e√üay," she explained. "An incredibly
generous donor then bid on it and
gave it to the University archives."
While no pieces from Jane
Stanford's jewelry collection made

their way into the archives this year,
other notable artifacts and events
will be memorialized.

One major story that will defi
nitely enter this year's preservation
stage was Stanford's announcement
of plans for a $lOO million energy
research institute called the
Precourt Institute for Energy. The
announcement was particularly
noteworthy because it was a collab
orative effort across many fields on
the Stanford campus, Morgan said.
The notorious cancellation of Full
Moon on the Quad will also be doc
umented in the archives.
"People will wonder why an
event that was so entrenched in tra
dition was cancelled," Morgan said.
"It was the first time it was cancelled
since it was incorporated as an offi
cial University event."
Public health scholars many
years in the future may be interested
to look back in the archives to learn
about a little-known disease by the
name of HINI that plagued the
Stanford campus in 2009. And any
person who stepped on campus dur
ing the fall could not have ignored
the football team's incredible sea
son, led by Heisman runner-up Toby
Gerhart.

"It was obviously a big year for
us so we collected several memora
bilia like football programs and
other items to preserve those mem

ories," Morgan said.
Other major events to be docu
mented include major construction
projects on campus, with the com
pletion of the Munger and Crothers
residence units. Morgan also men
tioned that the "unstuffing" of hous
ing would go into the archives.
The Stanford News Report,
before it became an online-only
publication, sent all of its print pub
lications to the archives. Scott
Stocker, the Director of Web
Communications, revealed the top
five articles that will definitely be
noted from the past year.
Topping the list was an article
entitled "Open-source camera could
revolutionize digital photography," a
story about new photo technology
being worked on by Stanford scien
tists. The second story discussed
Stanford research by Cliff Nass that
found that media multitasking might
actually impair one's cognition.
The remaining three stories were
about a free Stanford course on
developing iPhone software, the
University's decision to raise tuition
yet maintain its commitment to
financial aid, and finally, Stanford
researchers who created the world's
smallest writing.
While the Stanford News Report
and other publications can choose
which events were the "most popu
lar" by checking objective facts, such

as the number of page views on a
certain article, archivist Morgan
must factor in a variety of criteria.
Space is always an issue, so she
combs through hundreds of items to
determine which ones are most wor
thy of entering the halls of archive
fame.
"My favorite part of the job is
that I get to help connect people at
Stanford and beyond with the
information and historical resources
that they need," Morgan said. "And
you get to come across so many arti
facts with such interesting histories."
