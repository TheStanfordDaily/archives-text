# RAIN, RAIN, GO AWAY
## 
### FEDERICO DE LA BALZE 
BRAYNK! BRAYNK!
"Wake up! That's the fire alarm!"
yelled an R.A. from West Lag.
"Everyone out!"
It was 5 a.m. on Tuesday.
"Is this a sick joke?" demanded a
freshman from West Lag in his
Simpson's-themed pajamas, eyeing
the rain outside.
Thankfully, the firemen eventual
ly showed up and clarified the issue:
"It was a false call apparently trig
gered by the power outage. Have a
good day, everyone!"
West Lag may have suffered
alone on Tuesday, but on Wednesday
the whole campus was drenched.
In Wednesday's 9 a.m.
Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) lecture for "The Making of
the Modern World" in Cubberley
Auditorium, an eerie silence took
over the class as Prof. David Como
awaited the arrival of more students
to fill the mostly empty lecture hall.
"I'm so wet!" burst out a girl in
the back as she started taking off her
soaked outer layers. Only a handful
of guys snickered at the remark
obviously the mood was rotten in
Cubberley.
On the other side of campus, stu
dents biking to their 9 a.m. Physics
41 lecture attested to the irony of
the situation. The topic of the lec
ture: relative motion. In real world
terms, that means that when you
bike, the rain hits you in the face.
Even traditional gossip during
lunch took a rain-related spin.
"I heard two girls crashed while
biking by the Oval and, when they
were getting up, the Marguerite
came by and splashed them," related
a girl in Stern Dining.
"I saw facility workers shoveling
water from White Plaza," attested a
freshman.

Another chipped in: "They even
say there's water in Lake Lag now."
The students taking Social Dance

at 12:50 p.m. knew too well how wet
their fellow students were. The only
person who didn't seem wet in the
class was the professor, Richard
Powers, whose smooth swing moves
must surely come in handy as he
twists and turns to skip the puddles
across campus.
On a positive note, however.
Social Dance was slightly less awk
ward as the rain offered the perfect
ice breaker.
"So, what's up with all this rain,
huh?" asked a large upperclassman
whose wet socks left a mark on the
floor. His partner politely laughed
as they struggled with six-count
swing.
"I wish the weather would make
up its mind," said a tall, skinny Asian
freshman in a soaked dark blue
windbreaker. "I'm fine with it just
raining for a few days and stopping.
But today, it's rained for an hour,
then stopped, then rained again,
then stopped."
In fact, the rain appeared to
reach its climax for 10 minutes every
hour and then stop.
Needless to say, those 10 minutes
coincided with the breaks between
classes. While most students com
plained of the rain, there are always
a few rain lovers everyone's met
them. They wait for any chance to
convey how original they are by
going against the trend.
"I love rain!" said an upperclass
man as he sat comfortably in
Tresidder Union, his umbrella in
the shape of a Jedi sword close at
hand.
In yesterday's weather chaos,
there seemed to be only two types of
students: those with rain boots and
those with wet feet.
And let's not forget the clever
few who, bundled in their covers,
made the right choice and stayed in
bed. There's a reason they got into
Stanford.
