## USDA Deputy Secretary 'knows your food' 
### ZOE LEAVITT DESK EDITOR 
Just as Kathleen Merrigan, Deputy
Secretary of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA), used transmitter
devices to keep her audience involved in her
talk last night, she hopes to use health and
human welfare issues to involve the whole
country in "knowing their farmer."
"We believe there's just too much dis
tance between American consumers today
and those who produce their food,"
Merrigan said.
Speaking in Annenberg Auditorium last
night, Merrigan laid out the main goals of
the USDA's new "Know Your Farmer,

Know Your Food" initiative, which aims to
create agricultural opportunities, support
nutritional eating and foster connection
between consumers and food providers.
A colorful slideshow, combined with mul
tiple choice questions the audience could
answer with transmitter devices Kathleen's
associates handed out before the talk, kept
the audience engaged throughout the hour.
"People want to have that connection,
they want food to have a story" she said.
"There is a thirst in this country to have a
conversation about agriculture that I have
never seen."
Political science Prof. Rob Reich estab
lished high expectations for Merrigan in his
introduction.

"I think we have with us tonight a rock
star of the outside world, gone inside," he
said, describing the Deputy Secretary as a
woman with new ideas who arrived in her
current office by a non-traditional path.
Merrigan's talk focused on how the
USDA was using Facebook chat sessions,
Webinars, Twitter and blogs to encourage
popular participation in the initiative's Web
site. She also stressed the interdisciplinary
focus of the program.
"It's somewhat mold-breaking for the
bureaucracy to try to do things across disci
plines, across departments," Merrigan said.
"There's a lot of interconnectedness in the
work that needs to be done."
One primary problem "Know
Your Farmer" hopes to correct is the
gap between farmers' income and
the cost of running a farm. Merrigan
showed that while the net cash
income of the average farmer is
$70,000 per year, the estimated mar
ket value for the machinery on the
farm is $136,000, while the estimated
value of the land and buildings is
$l.l million. Because of this,
Merrigan described a wide variety of
USDA grants designed to boost the
opportunities of smaller, independ
ent farmers.

As for at the Farm, Merrigan said
students can get involved at all levels
of the program and shared opportu
nities for those looking to become
farmers, a future career many
Stanford students may have not con
sidered.
Although many of her ideas met
enthusiasm at the end of her talk,
most of the audience's questions
directed criticism at aspects of
USDA policy. Merrigan was quick to
acknowledge the organization's
shortcomings and the changes that
need to be made.
Todd Laurence, vice president of
YottaMark, a business that traces
food from the farms to the markets,
enjoyed the talk, but also believes
that tracing food, rather than bring
ing farms close to consumers, might
be a more effective answer.

"The reality is that that option [of
eating local] isn't available for the
overwhelming majority of people on
the planet," he said.
Matt Harnack, MFA 'OB, also
emerged from Annenberg with a
greater understanding of the com
plexities of food in America espe
cially when compared with previous
talks in the Food/Environment
series.
"The USDA is vilified by [previ
ous speakers] Joel Sullivan and
Michael Pollan a little bit... [This
talk] makes things a lot more com
plicated," he said. "It's easy to scape
goat the USDA, but what I got out
of this is that it's why more compli
cated than I thought it was."
