## Prof. Peter Vitousek awarded Japan Prize 
### MILING YAN 
Last week, Stanford biological sciences Prof.
Peter Vitousek was awarded the Japan Prize for
his environmental research.
One of the most prestigious awards in sci
ence, it is bestowed annually by the Science
and Technology Foundation of Japan to
researchers in two annually chosen areas.
Vitousek, who won for contributions to "bio
logical production and the environment," will
travel to Japan in April to receive his award, a
cash prize of 50 million yen, which equates to
roughly $550,000.
Vitousek, shocked by the honor, appreciated

the prize and viewed it as an opportunity to pro
mote his field of research. "I think this award
recognizes that a lot of us in the scientific com
munity are turning toward thinking about sci
ence versus sustainability," he said.
"What do we need to know to better manage
human impacts on the world and to maintain a
better human society?" he continued.
Vitousek's scientific trajectory began nearly
four decades ago with a single book C.S.
Elton's "Ecology of Invasions by Animals and
Plants" transforming a political science
major at Amherst into an environmental scien
tist. Since that watershed moment, Vitousek has
been studying human impacts on the environ

ment mainly through the prism of biogeochem
ical cycles.
Initially focused on his home state of Hawaii
as a model system, he has since expanded his
studies to examine nutrient imbalances around
the world. Last summer, he co-authored a wide
ly publicized article in Science magazine illus
trating the detrimental effects of agricultural
practices in the developing world.
His recent research interests have converged
on the cultural aspects of sustainability.
"My sense is the native Hawaiian cultures
and other indigenous cultures have a lot of

"I see many more
students who
possess both a
passionate
commitment
and an interest
in solutions."

PROF. VITOUSEK

understanding and worldviews that
will help in the process [of sustain
ability]," Vitousek explained.
Vitousek is actively involved
with Stanford's First Nations'
Futures Program for native
Flawaiians and New Zealand
Maori. Fie cites the ability of tradi
tional Hawaiian agricultural prac
tices to sustain a large population
without any external input as a les
son that can be applied to areas of
the world lacking the capital to sus
tain inputs.
Vitousek also wants to under
stand the undercurrents that drive
some cultures toward sustainability
and others away.
"As I get older, I get more
impressed with the importance of
culture and worldview as opposed
to knowledge in determining what
people do," he said. "We take sci
ence or economic techniques and
tools to show us the path in detail,

but we've chosen the path because
of culture and belief systems."
However, Vitousek's love for the
raw sciences remains undiminished.
"You're out in the field with
him, and he's like a kid," said
Naupaka Zimmerman, a Ph.D. can
didate in Vitousek's research group.
"He loves being out there. You're
tromping through tangled ferns and
he's out there faster than anybody."
Vitousek's passion for environ
mental research is colored by a gen
uine sense of optimism. With popu
lation growth no longer accelerat
ing as dramatically, he believes that
minimizing human impact will
amount to more than "shuffling
deckchairs on the Titanic."
He also points to changes he's
seen in his 25 years of teaching at
Stanford. "I see many more stu
dents who possess both a passion
ate commitment and an interest in
solutions," Vitousek said.
And if you have that passionate
commitment?
"Great things can happen."
