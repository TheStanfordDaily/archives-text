## Prof. Peter Vitousek awarded Japan Prize 
### MILING YAN 
Last week, Stanford biological sciences Prof.
Peter Vitousek was awarded the Japan Prize for
his environmental research.
One of the most prestigious awards in sci
ence, it is bestowed annually by the Science
and Technology Foundation of Japan to
researchers in two annually chosen areas.
Vitousek, who won for contributions to "bio
logical production and the environment," will
travel to Japan in April to receive his award, a
cash prize of 50 million yen, which equates to
roughly $550,000.
Vitousek, shocked by the honor, appreciated

the prize and viewed it as an opportunity to pro
mote his field of research. "I think this award
recognizes that a lot of us in the scientific com
munity are turning toward thinking about sci
ence versus sustainability," he said.
"What do we need to know to better manage
human impacts on the world and to maintain a
better human society?" he continued.
Vitousek's scientific trajectory began nearly
four decades ago with a single book C.S.
Elton's "Ecology of Invasions by Animals and
Plants" transforming a political science
major at Amherst into an environmental scien
tist. Since that watershed moment, Vitousek has
been studying human impacts on the environ

ment mainly through the prism of biogeochem
ical cycles.
Initially focused on his home state of Hawaii
as a model system, he has since expanded his
studies to examine nutrient imbalances around
the world. Last summer, he co-authored a wide
ly publicized article in Science magazine illus
trating the detrimental effects of agricultural
practices in the developing world.
His recent research interests have converged
on the cultural aspects of sustainability.
"My sense is the native Hawaiian cultures
and other indigenous cultures have a lot of

"I see many more
students who
possess both a
passionate
commitment
and an interest
in solutions."
