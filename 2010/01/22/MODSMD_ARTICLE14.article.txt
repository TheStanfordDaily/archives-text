## Dada to replace Banerjee Volume 237 will start off with a British bang 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN 
"The name's Dada Kamil
Dada."
Those were the first words out of
the deputy editor's mouth early
Friday, upon learning that he was
elected editor in chief of The Daily for
its 237 th volume, set to begin Feb. 1.
But as the post-election bubbly
began to flow, Dada, 31, would not
depart from the James Bond theme.
"I don't drink champagne," he said,
flashing British pomp so brightly
that Head Copy Editor Jane
LePham was quickly forced to don
sunglasses. "Someone, get me a
vodka martini shaken, not
stirred."

Fattie, Schwarma Embarrassed
In what is being called The
Daily's closest election of the
decade, Dada, a London native,
handily beat out Daily veteran Mr.
I.M. Fattie and dark horse candidate
Jackary Schwarma. Dada went home
with 25 votes, Fattie with seven and
Schwarma with one.
"It was a tough race," admitted
Amy Julia Harris, Schwarma's cam
paign manager and a features desk
editor. "We ran on a very attractive
platform: eliminating [Managing
Editor of News] Eric Messinger
from the organization and per
haps from Earth. But, it seems, the
idea didn't quite catch on."
Schwarma was not available for
comment. According to The Stanford
Investigative News Powerhouse, a
new campus publication that began
gathering reporting for its Daily elec
tion story three weeks ago, Schwarma
was found "on the roof of Haus Mitt,
drinking with friends."
Fattie, brought to The Daily dur
ing Volume 235 by then-Business
Manager In Ho Lee, attributed his
loss to a tarnished image that has
been fostered by certain Daily staff
members.
"He's just a stuffed panda,"
remarked Ryan Mac, a news desk
editor. "So, of course I ripped a hole
in his side. Now I can put him on the
end of my arm and tell people I have
a panda-hand instead of a real
hand." Mac, covered in Fattie's fluffy,
white insides, demonstrated the
panda-hand for this reporter.
Jason Shen, The Daily's business
manager, took the mockery further,
placing Fattie on a pink pool float
that precariously spanned across the
Daily Building's second-floor open
ing. "Look!" Shen exclaimed with a
smile that he wears only after coming
up with the next great start-up idea.
"Now Fattie can't go anywhere!"

When asked to comment on
Dada's election, Multimedia Editor
Wyndam Makowsky said his elec
tion was in line with Britain's strong
economic position within a new
European economic order.
"TOBY! BIRD MAN!" he added,
before shotgunning a beer.

Dada May Have Ties to MIS
Continuing to act debonair fol
lowing his election, Dada brought his
shaken, not stirred, vodka martini
over to where news desk editor Ellie
Titus was seated.
"So, uh, I heard you once thought
I was attractive," Dada said in a deep
voice. "Want to take a ride in my
Aston Martin?"
Titus, her face puzzled, respond
ed: "What's an Aston mah-tin?"
"No Martin," replied the edi
tor in chief-elect, clearly frustrated
that Titus was unable to comprehend
his British accent.
Freshman copy editor Kabir
Sawhney immediately took Dada's
seat, with what others described as
"the intent to get in with the new
Daily leadership." Sawhney proceed
ed to talk to the back of Titus's head
for 11 minutes, before moving on to
news writer Ellen Huet. News desk
editor Marisa Landicho, fearing she
was next in line, quickly vomited.
But the accent was troubling not
just to the awkward Dada-Titus duo.
Tim Callahan, a Powerhouse
reporter, believed it may mean
something more, so he scrambled to
begin what he widely touted as "an

investigation."
"The British accent can only
mean one thing," Callahan said. "I
haven't done any research yet, nor
have I attempted to understand
exactly what my sources are telling
me, but I've already made up my
mind: Kamil Dada is an MIS opera
tive trying to infiltrate The Daily."
When confronted with the claim,
Dada punched Callahan in the face,
donned his tuxedo jacket and rap
pelled down The Daily's elevator
shaft with an anonymous female.

Banerjee Found Wandering the
Streets
Editor in Chief Devin Banerjee,
who has had nightly responsibilities
at The Daily since September 2008,
had mixed feelings about his
impending departure from the Daily
masthead.
"I don't know what to do," he
said, standing outside the Daily
Building and gazing up at his sec
ond-floor office window. "Where am
I to sleep? The streets?"
Indeed, Banerjee's office looks
more like a bedroom than an office:
A blue pillow and blanket are per
manent members of his couch, and
the editor's trusty guitar sits against
the far wall.
"I'll have to ask Housing where I
was assigned to live in the fall," said
Banerjee, wandering aimlessly out
side Building 10. "I wonder if there
will be newspapers on the wall there,
too."

Volume 237 begins Monday, Feb. 1.

"Want to take a ride in my
Aston Martin?"
