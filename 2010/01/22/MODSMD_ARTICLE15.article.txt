## THE
						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION The
						Future of America's Scientific Leadership 
### Shelley Gao 
In recent weeks, there has been quite a
clamor about Stanford and the interna
tional community: the potential with
drawal of Google from China as result of
cyber espionage concerns particularly in re
gard to a Stanford student and Tibetan ac
tivist, and last Friday's House Foreign Affairs
Committee hearing, "The Impact of U.S. Ex
port Controls on National Security, Science
and Technological Leadership." Given the
relevance of the topic to the Silicon Valley
high-tech industry, the Committee, which
heard a testimony from President John Hen
nessy, met on campus at the Arrillaga Alum
ni Center.
The event especially has significant impli
cations on Stanford's research environment
and compliance obligations. Chairman
Howard Berman (D-CA) plans to introduce
in March a bill to revamp export controls
laws. As Berman explained in his opening
statement, export controls have been a cen
tral part of American national security poli
cy. They involve the federal government re
stricting the international transfer of "dual
use" technologies those that can be used
for legitimate commercial and civilian, but
also military, purposes.
Hennessy urged reform of the current
regulations, as they impede beneficial re
search through citizenship requirements.
He highlighted how these regulations dis
rupted three breakthrough research proj
ects at Stanford involving the development
of microchip, design of an orbiting instru
ment and creation of a vaccine. Hennessy,
along with other experts, emphasized the
importance of safeguarding security while
ensuring America's leading role in science
and technology.
James Fallows, in a feature published in
the current January/February issue of The
Atlantic, also points to the openness of insti
tutions of higher education to international
students as a critical component of Ameri
ca's leadership in the world. In "How Amer
ica Can Rise Again," Fallows refers to the
words of Shirley Tilghman, a research biolo
gist and president of Princeton University on
the American university model of advanced
research as the engine of innovation. By en
suring that funding and promotions are
widely available to young scientists, America
is able to attract the best talent from around
the globe.
However, this nation's ability to absorb
the best and brightest minds is jeopardized
by the technology export regulations that re
strict foreign students' access to laboratories
and research facilities. This will inevitably
lead to diminished scientific leadership, ero
sion of soft power and reduction of a force
that has historically made the United States
great.
Export controls are not the only burdens
experienced by foreign students studying in
American universities. Apart from the diffi
cultly in attaining financial aid and fellow
ships, visa regulations also significantly re
strict international students' ease of entry
and possibility to pursue post-graduation ca
reer opportunities. Indeed, The Daily's Edi
torial Board referred to this challenge on
Wednesday in its "ASSU Executive Mid-

Year Evaluation: Part Two," deeming
changes in immigration laws as an agenda
item that the student body hopes to see
progress on.
Grads should also consider pursuing agi
tation and activism on their own behalf.
There is tremendous potential for Stanford
students to champion the export controls re
form movement. At Stanford, 32 percent of
the graduate population comes from other
countries and more than half of the interna
tional Ph.D. students are in engineering and
the physical sciences.
Concerns may arise regarding the role of
"scientific men" in policymaking and the
boundaries between science and politics.
However, it is vital for scientists to have an
input in raising, shaping and amplifying poli
cies when the future of international collab
orative research is at stake,
A coalition of constituencies, including in
stitutions of higher education and leaders in
high technology industries, and scientific and
research establishments can be mobilized to
spearhead government relations campaigns.
Developing tactics and incentives to gain
support of the opposition, ranging from de
fense hawks to legislators like Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher (R-CA) who said, "You are
essentially exporting technologies straight
into the hands of the Chinese military"
certainly represents a challenge. However,
more voices participating in the discourse
will hopefully lead to pragmatic reforms in
export controls policy.

Shelley is delighted by the notion of activist sci
entists. Contact Shelley at sxgao@stanford.edu.

The ability to absorb
the best and brightest
minds is jeopardized
by technology export
regulations that
restrict access to
resources.
