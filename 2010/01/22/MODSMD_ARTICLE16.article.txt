### REED THAYER Class of 2013 
While eating dinner in Wilbur on Jan.
19,1 spotted a flyer on the table an
nouncing that there is only one
more day to request a Student Activity Fee
refund. The flyer was sponsored by the Stan
ford Conservative Society. I am curious as to
why an American flag was featured promi
nently on the flyer. Is this implying that it is
patriotic to request a refund?
I have nothing against conservatives on
campus; many of my close friends are conser
vatives. However, I am appalled by the asso
ciation of the Stars and Stripes with not sup
porting student groups on campus. I under
stand that students do have the right to re
quest their money back, but is it the 'Ameri
can" thing to do? Are we not defending free
dom by funding groups that express a variety
of opinions, some shared by us and some not.

ranging from music groups to club sports
teams to cultural and political groups (for a
full list go to elections.stanford.edu and view
election results)? These groups are what
make our community so vibrant and encour
age us to examine our own viewpoints and
better understand those of others.
While we may not be directly involved in
many of these groups, they still affect us. The
band plays at our games, we are serenaded by
musical groups and the SHPRC and The
Bridge are always there for us. Our student
groups are a microcosm for American cul
ture, a beautiful mural of diverse ideas; one
of the greatest benefits of attending college is
to be challenged by diverse ideas, is it not?
