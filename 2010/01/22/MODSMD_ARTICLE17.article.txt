## "The Everyman Machine" 
### P.G. Mann 
"I go to Washington as the representative of
no faction or interest, answering only to my
conscience and to the people. I've got a lot to
learn in the Senate, but I know who lam and I
know who I serve. I'm Scott Brown. I'm from
Wrentham. I drive a truck, and I am nobody's
senator but yours." —Massachusetts Sena
tor-elect Scott Brown
"Every man is as Heaven made him, and
sometimes a great deal worse."
Cervantes, "Don Quixote"
Of course you can smell my truck. I
don't mind. Yeah, it still has that new
truck scent. But I assure you that's be
cause I'm tidy, not elitist. No pretentious lib
eral phony-scent trees dangling from this
mirror. No, sir. Just an American flag, my
Helen Gurly Brown commemorative fuzzy
dice (a gift from Cosmo) and a tea bag still
dripping with earl gray patriotism. Oh, that
other smell, you ask? That's the smell of vic
tory — the people's victory! Now, with all
due respect, please back away from the truck.
You're leaving grease stains on my populist
decal.
I know what you're thinking. How in the
heck did a regular patriotic pro-life guy like
me take on the juggernaut of the liberal es
tablishment? Well, to tell the truth, I never
thought I would end up in politics. It always
seemed like a sordid scene run by backroom
deals and shadowy interest groups. Capitol
Hill brought to mind a cocktail hour intrigue
of smug corporate lawyers, spineless party
hacks and lobbyists from whose double
breasted suits flowed endless free steaks and
Coogi sweaters. What's more, it was worm
ridden with political philosophies, ideologies,
party platforms, all sorts of things that, to a
normal liberty-loving dude, sounded pretty
suspect.
And, if my car hadn't broken down that
one fateful day, I surely would have carried
on being a sedan-driving, golf-playing, nude
modeling drone of the liberal establishment.
But when I showed up at Hertz for a replace
ment rental, my loafers in tatters, all they had
left were pick-up trucks. After upbraiding the
sales assistant, I resigned myself to the truck
and drove home feeling awkward. But some-

thing strange happened on that drive home.
At first, the changes were small. I started
hanging my arm out the window. I tuned in to
AM radio. I started whistling the national an
them. But more perceptible transformations
soon followed in their wake. A paranoid fear
of illegal immigrants crept over me. I felt the
sacred institution of marriage crumbling be
neath my feet. My love of unborn fetuses be
came so overwhelming that I had to pull over
and buy a pro-life bumper sticker.

At the highway rest stop, I noticed, much
to my amazement, that I was trading banter
and sharing laments with the other huddled
masses piling out of their pickups and into
the urinals. Despite wanting to liquidate their
homes and send them to prison, I felt a gen
uine affection for their folksy desperation
and lack of opportunity. I then realized what
had just happened to me: I had become an
everyman.
Back on the road, my new everyman
aroma spewed forth from the exhaust pipe of
my everyman machine, sweetening the air
with a new hope for democracy.
The minutemen militias of delusional
hockey moms and other dangerous ignora
muses crawled out from their bunkers and
followed my fumes. They immediately recog
nized this scent as their own, with its stench of
raw civic discontent not masked with any ar
tificial rational fragrances, and proclaimed
me their king.
So, here I am, just another small town
beauty queen taking on the political ma
chine. As an everyman, I like my democracy
old-fashioned (circa 2004): without health
care, steeped in war and favoring the rich.
But don't you go thinking we're the same
as the everymen of yore. Sure, Harry Truman
may have made a big fuss about being a small
potatoes yokel from Independence, Mo. But
then he had to go and ruin his everyman
image with a palpable sense of history and an
intellectual commitment to governance.
You know what that reeks of? Expertise!
Elitism! Now, how are you supposed to serve
the people if the people can't relate to you?
And how are the people supposed to relate
to you if you know more than they do? That's
bad reality TV and bad democracy. Instead,
the everyman politician of the 21st century
must be a convincing avatar. When the
American people look into the political mir
ror of democratic government (or Cos
mopolitan), they want to see themselves,
only with killer abs.
Also, it doesn't hurt to have a sweet truck.
