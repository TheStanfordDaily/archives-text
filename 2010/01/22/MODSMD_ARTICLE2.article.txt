## Cardinal stymies Beavers in rout 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford picked a good time to turn in its
best defensive performance of the season.
With the salty taste of the Washington
road trip still lingering and injuries piling up,
the Cardinal (9-9,3-3 Pac-10) beat Oregon
State (8-10, 2-4 Pac-10) 59-35 at Maples
Pavilion on Thursday.
The Beavers' point total was the lowest
for a Stanford opponent since December
2005.
"They're a tremendous scoring team at
times, but I think we played excellent de
fense," said senior forward Landry Fields.
"We were alert," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "It was good to see our guys grow
in that area."
Oregon State's own incompetence must
be noted the Beavers were never in sync
in the second half and many of their mistakes
could be attributed to self-inflicted errors.
But it's hard to take anything away from
Stanford. The Beavers were held to 36.6 per
cent shooting and Roeland Schaftenaar, who
pained Stanford last year, did not score.
The Cardinal's supremacy was wide
spread. Stanford out-rebounded the
Beavers, 38-22 and pulled down 14 offensive
boards. The Cardinal forced 19 turnovers
and held Oregon State scoreless for nearly a
nine-minute stretch in the second half.
Although Stanford's shutdown defensive
performance will get the acclaim for this con
test, the Cardinal was arguably even more
impressive on offense.

The Beavers hounded Stanford last year
with its 1-3-1 set, which could easily morph
into man-to-man or another zone. By attack
ing the ball handler, Oregon State forces er
rant passes and desperate shots but not
Thursday.
"You always have to try and be coordi
nated and understand what they're in first,"
Dawkins said. "Our guys made very good
reads. Our big guys were active, our perime
ter guys were alert."
Sophomore guard Jarrett Mann, who has
shown flashes of brilliance coupled with dis
appointing outings throughout the year,
played like a conductor leading a finely
tuned orchestra. He posted six assists to only
two turnovers and fed his teammates with
beautiful pass after beautiful pass. Sopho
more forward Jack Trotter, a frequent recipi
ent of Mann's dimes, had three dunks in the
game, none of which were heavily contested,
in large part because Mann was able to find
the right seam at the right time.
"I talked to Jarrett about streamlining
that consistency," Dawkins said. "He was
controlling our tempo. He set the table for
the rest of our guys tonight."
The benefactors, besides Trotter (10
points), were Fields (17 points) and sopho
more Jeremy Green (13 points in an off
night). But a total of 11 players got into the
action, both because of Stanford's expansive
lead and injuries to sophomore forward An
drew Zimmermann, a starter and freshman
guard Gabriel Harris. Sophomore forwards
