## Cardinal stymies Beavers in rout 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford picked a good time to turn in its
best defensive performance of the season.
With the salty taste of the Washington
road trip still lingering and injuries piling up,
the Cardinal (9-9,3-3 Pac-10) beat Oregon
State (8-10, 2-4 Pac-10) 59-35 at Maples
Pavilion on Thursday.
The Beavers' point total was the lowest
for a Stanford opponent since December
2005.
"They're a tremendous scoring team at
times, but I think we played excellent de
fense," said senior forward Landry Fields.
"We were alert," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "It was good to see our guys grow
in that area."
Oregon State's own incompetence must
be noted the Beavers were never in sync
in the second half and many of their mistakes
could be attributed to self-inflicted errors.
But it's hard to take anything away from
Stanford. The Beavers were held to 36.6 per
cent shooting and Roeland Schaftenaar, who
pained Stanford last year, did not score.
The Cardinal's supremacy was wide
spread. Stanford out-rebounded the
Beavers, 38-22 and pulled down 14 offensive
boards. The Cardinal forced 19 turnovers
and held Oregon State scoreless for nearly a
nine-minute stretch in the second half.
Although Stanford's shutdown defensive
performance will get the acclaim for this con
test, the Cardinal was arguably even more
impressive on offense.

The Beavers hounded Stanford last year
with its 1-3-1 set, which could easily morph
into man-to-man or another zone. By attack
ing the ball handler, Oregon State forces er
rant passes and desperate shots but not
Thursday.
"You always have to try and be coordi
nated and understand what they're in first,"
Dawkins said. "Our guys made very good
reads. Our big guys were active, our perime
ter guys were alert."
Sophomore guard Jarrett Mann, who has
shown flashes of brilliance coupled with dis
appointing outings throughout the year,
played like a conductor leading a finely
tuned orchestra. He posted six assists to only
two turnovers and fed his teammates with
beautiful pass after beautiful pass. Sopho
more forward Jack Trotter, a frequent recipi
ent of Mann's dimes, had three dunks in the
game, none of which were heavily contested,
in large part because Mann was able to find
the right seam at the right time.
"I talked to Jarrett about streamlining
that consistency," Dawkins said. "He was
controlling our tempo. He set the table for
the rest of our guys tonight."
The benefactors, besides Trotter (10
points), were Fields (17 points) and sopho
more Jeremy Green (13 points in an off
night). But a total of 11 players got into the
action, both because of Stanford's expansive
lead and injuries to sophomore forward An
drew Zimmermann, a starter and freshman
guard Gabriel Harris. Sophomore forwards

NOTES! Stanford held Oregon State to 1 3
points in the second half en route to a 59-35
win yesterday at Maples Pavilion. The Cardi
nal was led by senior forward Landry Fields,
who had a double-double with 1 7 points
and 10 rebounds. Oregon has lost its last
four games after a 2-0 start in Pac-10 play.

Sophomore forward Jack Trotter shields the ball from an Oregon State defender during Stanford's 59-35 victory
over the Beavers last night at Maples Pavilion. Trotter had 10 points and six rebounds for the Cardinal.


Matei Daian and Elliott Bullock played
significant minutes because of the
weakened frontcourt depth.
"We don't want to make excuses,"
Fields said. "We're going to need contri
butions from those guys whether we
have injuries or not."
The game began reasonably
enough. Stanford led 9-8 after seven
minutes, but Green and Fields made
consecutive three-pointers to push the
Cardinal lead to seven. While the
Beavers prevented Stanford from
pulling away, they could never quite
close the gap and the Cardinal went to
the locker room with a 28-22 advan
tage.
But while Oregon State was able to
keep it close before halftime, it could do
practically nothing after the break. The
Cardinal outscored the Beavers 31-13
in the second half.
The teams traded misses for the first
few minutes and until the 12:40 mark,
Stanford's lead hovered near 10 points
sizeable, but still within range for an
Oregon State comeback. But in fairly
rapid succession, Mann connected with
Trotter for a dunk, Daian put back a
missed shot, Mann found Trotter again
and Green hit a three-pointer from just
in front of the Stanford bench. Within
that two-minute span, the Cardinal lead
jumped from 11 to 16 and overall,in just
over five minutes, Stanford doubled its
previous eight-point advantage,
"It's a mentality of attacking the rim
hard and not letting anyone get in my
way," Trotter said about his low post
performance.
After the 10-minute mark, the Car
dinal took over in one of its most im
pressive stretches of the season. Stan
ford dominated in every aspect of the
game. From that point until the end of
the contest, the Cardinal pulled down
six offensive rebounds, out-hustled
Oregon State for loose balls, stole seven
passes, showed good movement and
clock management and didn't allow a

basket until there were under three
minutes left. The exclamation point
came with 7:21 remaining in the game.
Fields beat his man off the dribble,
drove and threw down an emphatic
dunk to bring the Stanford lead to SO
SO.
By the end of the game, walk-on and
former practice player Peter Abraham
was doing his best Fields impression,
driving hard for two-points of his own.
To say that the Cardinal was locked-in
would be an understatement the
team was destructive and the Beavers
could do nothing to stop it.

Stanford, now 8-2 at Maples, will try
and maintain its home court domi
nance when it hosts Oregon on Satur
day. The Ducks (10-8,2-4 Pac-10) were
blown out by Cal, 89-57, on Thursday
and have lost four straight since begin
ning conference play 2-0.
Fields would like to see that slide
continue.
"It's a mindset," he said." We want to
come home and protect our home
court."

Dawkins. "It was good to see our guys grow
in that area."
Oregon State's own incompetence must
be noted the Beavers were never in sync
in the second half and many of their mistakes
could be attributed to self-inflicted errors.
But it's hard to take anything away from
Stanford. The Beavers were held to 36.6 per
cent shooting and Roeland Schaftenaar, who
pained Stanford last year, did not score.
The Cardinal's supremacy was wide
spread. Stanford out-rebounded the
Beavers, 38-22 and pulled down 14 offensive
boards. The Cardinal forced 19 turnovers
and held Oregon State scoreless for nearly a
nine-minute stretch in the second half.
Although Stanford's shutdown defensive
performance will get the acclaim for this con
test, the Cardinal was arguably even more
impressive on offense.

The Beavers hounded Stanford last year
with its 1-3-1 set, which could easily morph
into man-to-man or another zone. By attack
ing the ball handler, Oregon State forces er
rant passes and desperate shots but not
Thursday.
"You always have to try and be coordi
nated and understand what they're in first,"
Dawkins said. "Our guys made very good
reads. Our big guys were active, our perime
ter guys were alert."
Sophomore guard Jarrett Mann, who has
shown flashes of brilliance coupled with dis
appointing outings throughout the year,
played like a conductor leading a finely
tuned orchestra. He posted six assists to only
two turnovers and fed his teammates with
beautiful pass after beautiful pass. Sopho
more forward Jack Trotter, a frequent recipi
ent of Mann's dimes, had three dunks in the
game, none of which were heavily contested,
in large part because Mann was able to find
the right seam at the right time.
"I talked to Jarrett about streamlining
that consistency," Dawkins said. "He was
controlling our tempo. He set the table for
the rest of our guys tonight."
The benefactors, besides Trotter (10
points), were Fields (17 points) and sopho
more Jeremy Green (13 points in an off
night). But a total of 11 players got into the
action, both because of Stanford's expansive
lead and injuries to sophomore forward An

NOTES! Stanford held Oregon State to 1 3
points in the second half en route to a 59-35
win yesterday at Maples Pavilion. The Cardi
nal was led by senior forward Landry Fields,
who had a double-double with 1 7 points
and 10 rebounds. Oregon has lost its last
four games after a 2-0 start in Pac-10 play.


DYLAN PLOFKER/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore forward Jack Trotter shields the ball from an Oregon State defender during Stanford's 59-35 victory
over the Beavers last night at Maples Pavilion. Trotter had 10 points and six rebounds for the Cardinal.


Matei Daian and Elliott Bullock played
significant minutes because of the
weakened frontcourt depth.
"We don't want to make excuses,"
Fields said. "We're going to need contri
butions from those guys whether we
have injuries or not."
The game began reasonably
enough. Stanford led 9-8 after seven
minutes, but Green and Fields made
consecutive three-pointers to push the
Cardinal lead to seven. While the
Beavers prevented Stanford from
pulling away, they could never quite
close the gap and the Cardinal went to
the locker room with a 28-22 advan
tage.
But while Oregon State was able to
keep it close before halftime, it could do
practically nothing after the break. The
Cardinal outscored the Beavers 31-13
in the second half.
The teams traded misses for the first
few minutes and until the 12:40 mark,
Stanford's lead hovered near 10 points
sizeable, but still within range for an
Oregon State comeback. But in fairly
rapid succession, Mann connected with
Trotter for a dunk, Daian put back a
missed shot, Mann found Trotter again
and Green hit a three-pointer from just
in front of the Stanford bench. Within
that two-minute span, the Cardinal lead
jumped from 11 to 16 and overall,in just
over five minutes, Stanford doubled its
previous eight-point advantage,
"It's a mentality of attacking the rim
hard and not letting anyone get in my
way," Trotter said about his low post
performance.
After the 10-minute mark, the Car
dinal took over in one of its most im
pressive stretches of the season. Stan
ford dominated in every aspect of the
game. From that point until the end of
the contest, the Cardinal pulled down
six offensive rebounds, out-hustled
Oregon State for loose balls, stole seven
passes, showed good movement and
clock management and didn't allow a

basket until there were under three
minutes left. The exclamation point
came with 7:21 remaining in the game.
Fields beat his man off the dribble,
drove and threw down an emphatic
dunk to bring the Stanford lead to SO
SO.
By the end of the game, walk-on and
former practice player Peter Abraham
was doing his best Fields impression,
driving hard for two-points of his own.
To say that the Cardinal was locked-in
would be an understatement the
team was destructive and the Beavers
could do nothing to stop it.

Stanford, now 8-2 at Maples, will try
and maintain its home court domi
nance when it hosts Oregon on Satur
day. The Ducks (10-8,2-4 Pac-10) were
blown out by Cal, 89-57, on Thursday
and have lost four straight since begin
ning conference play 2-0.
Fields would like to see that slide
continue.
"It's a mindset," he said." We want to
come home and protect our home
court."

Stanford picked a good time to turn in its
best defensive performance of the season.
With the salty taste of the Washington
road trip still lingering and injuries piling up,
the Cardinal (9-9,3-3 Pac-10) beat Oregon
State (8-10, 2-4 Pac-10) 59-35 at Maples
