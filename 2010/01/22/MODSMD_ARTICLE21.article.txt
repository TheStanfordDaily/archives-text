This past week has been extremely cold, continuously rainy and just all around drab. I've looked up the weather report for the coming
month and apparently this forecast will be hanging around for a while. I don't think I can take it. I have nothing to be upset about and
recently I've gotten plenty of sleep, but for some reason I feel very lethargic and unhappy. Today, I was so sad. I couldn't figure out
what was bothering me until my friend pointed out that the weather was probably making me feel depressed. It's so true. Not only does bik
ing in the rain and cold annoy me, but also the lack of sunshine and warmth messes with my spirit. So, I've decided to be very diligent and
take these three steps, which you may also want to adopt, to mitigate my case of seasonal depression:

Exercise

It's a very strange concept, but when I am lacking energy, a good
way to get me going is to do something active. There's a science behind it
(something about endorphins?) that makes one feel happier and cheerful after a nice, long workout. This method is a
great way to battle the lethargy that comes with winter. Schedule it into your daily routine or sign up for a class. Just
make sure to do any activity that gets you moving it is guaranteed to battle sluggishness.

ry Going Outside

When you wake up in the morning and look outside to see the unbearable rain, it's understandably very easy to
decide to stay indoors in your warm pajamas. Once the rain does stop however, you should use this break as a chance to
go outside, even if it is just for a little while. A great way to keep yourself content (and sane) is to make sure you get
some fresh air. Resist the urge to stay in bed and just go outside for 30 minutes or, if this task is too difficult, open a
window.

Eating Healthy

Although coffee is effective if you're trying to stay up late or charge yourself early in the morning, this fake ener
gy does not last. In fact, once the effects of the caffeine wear off, you often feel less energetic than you did to begin
with. Candy and chocolate have the same effect. If you take these items out of your diet, or at least enjoy them in mod
eration and make sure to drink at least 2 liters of water a day, you should start to feel a lot healthier and vibrant.
