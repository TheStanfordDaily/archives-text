Last weekend, Ram's
Head presented "The
Original Winter One
Acts," three student-penned
plays performed back-to-back
in one engaging, moving and
always unpredictable produc
tion.

Audiences packed the
small and intimate Nitery
Theater Thursday through
Saturday. Those fortunate

enough to secure a ticket
were treated to a varied
sequence of pieces: a botched
drug heist, a folktale of heal
ing and tragedy and a hilari
ous look into the problems of
a theater stage crew. The
selection of acts, each
markedly different from the
other, ensured that audience
members with diverse tastes
left the theater entertained.
"Play 2," written by
Harley Adams, explores an
outrageous situation in which
two drug dealers contemplate
cutting open a live baby that

may or may not contain
crack-cocaine. It is no sur
prise that this act generated
the most excited buzz during
intermission. With its dark
humor and grim subject mat
ter, "Play 2" provided an
unnerving experience that left
audiences unsure of whether
to gasp in horror or laugh
uncomfortably. As director
Ashley Chang ' 13 succinctly

expressed, "It was completely
bad-ass and very Quentin
Tarantino." Like many
Tarantino movies, the graphic
violence and pervasive,
strong language left audi
ences divided.
While some felt that
the profanity (all 15 c-words
from the original script were
cut) was excessive and crude,
others, like Sakshi Agarwal
'l2, felt that the language
was well suited to the play.
"This is real life and
you can't mask it with
niceties," Agarwal said. "The

language grabs you and
forces you to pay attention."
"The Fisherman" tells
the tale of a small-town fish
erman who, despite his pow
ers of healing, fails to repair
his broken relationship with
his daughter and escape his
haunted past. Writer Kerry
Mahuron 'lO and director

Alex Holtzman 'l2 craft a
mystical world, in which a
mysterious fox-woman comes
to unravel a family's secrets.
Mahuron was influ
enced by Chinese and
Scandinavian mythology. "I
was also reading a lot of
Freud and contemplating pat
terns of repression and

expression in my own life
and in 21st American society
in general," she said. The act
was rife with suspense and
drama, with an ending that
played with themes of atone
ment and redemption.
After the heavy drama
of "The Fisherman," "Top of
the Show," written by Jean
Ansolabehere 'll and direct
ed by Brendon Martin 'l3,
was a cathartic and fun romp
into the lives of those who
work behind the scenes of the
theater. The under-appreciat
ed stage crew bravely navi
gated their way through rela
tionships, theatrical personali
ties and the task of keeping a
production of "Romeo and
Juliet" afloat. All of the
actors had wonderful comedic
timing and the play within a
play concept was reworked in
a fresh and modern way.
Theater is always enjoyable
when it doesn't take itself too
seriously and the self-referen
tial humor was particularly
appreciated at the last
Saturday show, in which
other show casts crept into
the audience to watch the
final one act.
During one of the
"Top of the Show" runs, was
an instance of art imitating
life, or rather, life imitating
art. Holly Rogers 'lO, who
played the diva actress of the
show, ran into a few back

stage troubles of her own on
the last night of the show.
"My costume actually broke
the last night of the show.
Which is funny, because one
of my first lines is "Mandy,
my costume broke,'" she said.
"Winter One Acts" is
a wonderful creative outlet
and showcase for the student
population. At the beginning
of the school year, a number
of student scripts are submit
ted. The producers then nar
row them down to 10 and
work with the directors in
final decisions. Cast, design
and tech are all students from
the Stanford community.
"Playwrights have the
amazing chance to see their
play live and in front of them
and in front of an audience,"
wrote lead producer Paul
Brownlee 'l2. He added that
the directors get to take part
in the shaping of a new show,
a completely fresh piece.
"Directing the first produc
tion of 'The Fisherman' is a
whole different experience
than directing the 450 th pro
duction of 'The Glass
Menagerie.' You create the
original."
