Having to discuss whether your friend's
late-model Lexus will be victim to a
break-in in the parking lot is not an
especially auspicious start to any restaurant
experience. But in the case of Back-a-Yard, a
small Jamaican dive in East Menlo Park (East
Palo Alto's northerly twin), the somewhat
questionable environs couldn't detract from
some of the best food near the Stanford cam
pus. While Back-a-Yard has the trappings of
a relatively undiscovered hole in the wall, any
lunchtime visit during the work week will
reveal hordes of white collar workers lining
up for high quality Jamaican food. Even a
quick poll of Stanford students revealed that
some already know about this true diamond in
the rough. Still, for the uninitiated, the first
trip to Back-a-Yard can be a religious experi
ence.
Back-a-Yard specializes in meat pre
pared in the traditional Jamaican "jerk" style,
which refers to a mixture of spices used as a
marinade. While they offer jerk-style almost

anything (tofu, salmon, beef, etc.), we've only
tried the traditionally jerked meats pork
and chicken. The jerk marinade is legitimately
incredible; it's spicy, but in a complex way.
And while it's exact composition remains a
mystery to us, the Back-a-Yard Web site
explains "jerk marinade consist of a fiery
mixture of spices, including Scotch bonnet
Pepper, pimento or allspice, nutmeg and
thyme. The practice of cooking the meat over
the flame dates back to the discovery of
Jamaica."
Almost more importantly, the marinat
ed meat comes off the grill mouth-wateringly
tender, even though many grilled meats (espe
cially chicken) veer toward the consistency of
sawdust. We're especially partial to the jerk
chicken, although the pork is also delicious.
While the chicken can be ordered as either
light or dark meat, the dark meat is definitely
more moist, more flavorful and cheaper.
Alone, the jerk chicken (or jerk any
thing) would make Back-a-Yard a destination.

But the restaurant serves its excellent main
courses along with a host of amazing sides.
The fried plantains are a personal favorite
crispy, caramelized exterior, mushy inside and
lightly flavored with cinnamon and butter and
a few intangibles. Having easily devoured the
plantains provided with our jerk chicken, we
ended up getting an extra side order. Although
the plantains are hard to share a plate with,
the mound of coconut-infused rice and beans
still manages to shine. Rice and beans sounds
"blah," but these are moist, interesting and
just plain yummy. Even the sort of plain, hap
penstance side salad is pretty good. The
crispy deep-fried corn "festivals," which have
to be ordered separately, are also a delicious,
albeit sinful, side. Only complaint? The por
tions are so large and the entire meal so deli
cious, that it can be hard to decide between
leaving a plantain untouched and letting your
stomach burst. But for the exceptionally hun
gry or exceptionally dedicated, Back-a-Yard's
dessert selection is just as heavenly as its
main courses. We recommend the key lime
and pecan pies especially.

All in all, Back-a-Yard is a must for

any Stanford student. Only 15 minutes from
campus and $9.25 for a more-than-ample din
ner of jerk chicken, this Jamaican destination
is the perfect antidote to rainy winter quarter
blahs.
