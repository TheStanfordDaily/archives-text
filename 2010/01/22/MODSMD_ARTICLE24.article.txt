We've all been taught
to avoid judging a
book by its cover,
but Spoon's "Transference" is
an album that begs for it.
Their newest album comes
nipping at the heels of 2007's
hit "Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga," which
dropkicked the band into the
limelight with its sassy horn
supported singles and the
anticipation was heavily tan
gible for Spoon's seventh stu
dio album.
But before the
album's first notes even hit
eardrums, the album's title
and cover art speak about
what to expect.
'Transference' the action
of transferring something to
another is simple enough,
if a little presumptuous. But
its psychological definition
hints at something darker: in
psychoanalysis, transference
occurs when a patient redi
rects strong emotions such as
anger and disgust toward a
substitute, often the therapist.
And the cover image, a
brooding young guy slouch
ing in a chair while a
cropped-out woman lurks to
the side, uses muted blues
and oranges to convey a
sense of adolescent ennui.
From the first track,
the Austin-based quartet's
sound falls in line with the
hinted tone of the title. It's a
little ambiguous and unclear
perhaps not directed where
it should be. The opening
track, "Before Destruction,"
doesn't make a big statement,
but instead, vocalist Britt
Daniel's words come out sti
fled, as if sung into a card
board box instead of over a
vast crowd. The band's signa
ture low-fi garage sound is
highlighted, almost overdone,
almost to remind fans that
despite the commercial and

popular success of
"Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga,"
that Spoon haven't
reneged on their
solidly built minimal
style.
Without a
noticeable or mar
ketable single,
"Transference"
makes a well-bal
anced album, with
variations, but no
sore thumbs. On the
other hand, it wan
ders into the danger
zone of turning into
too much of the
same. A few twists
keep the front end of
the record from drag
ging: "Is Love
Forever?" almost
answers its own
tongue-in-cheek
question, clocking in
at 2:07 as the shortest

track on the album; the easy
groove of "The Mystery
Zone" puts it closest to the

album's big song, but it's too
static and too long to rival the
hits from other albums; "I
Saw the Light" pushes two

minutes of slow languor and
then abruptly shifts gears to a
sharp instrumental riff that
builds part by part into a driv-

ing force.
By the middle
mark, though,
"Transference"
starts having diffi
culties getting its
message across.
With the piano bal
lad "Goodnight
Laura," Spoon
wipes away all
noticeable effects
in favor of a more
"authentic" sound.
The attempt is
admirable, but the
execution falls
short: instead of
gaining the emo
tional power that
most stripped
down performanc
es offer, it instead
sounds like some
thing you might
overhear in a dorm

piano room a
little jarring, a little off
rhythm and most definitely
missing something.

Following this is "Out Go the
Lights," whose lyrics sulk
through the song like the man
on the cover art, leaving most
of the album's momentum to
straggle behind.
The last two tracks do
their best to pick up the
speed: "Got Nuffin," released
in 2009 on an EP, has that
Spoon-style steady bass line
and Britt Daniel crooning, "I
got nothing to lose/except
darkness and shadows." The
final savior comes in the sur
prise that is "Nobody Gets
Me But You," which hits the
palate with a bumping bass
line so unlike the 1-2-3-4 of
most Spoon songs that you
can't help but bob your head
a little.
It's not groundbreak
ing, but Spoon doesn't seem
to mind. Right after "Ga Ga
Ga Ga Ga," the band released
two other EPs that catered
even less than Transference
does to its new mainstream
audience. If any new fans of
Spoon were expecting a
repeat of "You Got Yr.
Cherry Bomb," don't bother
looking it's not here. But
something more thoughtful
lurks behind the somewhat
muted tracks: Spoon's just
doing what they've always
done.
