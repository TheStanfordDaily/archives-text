Ram's Head and the
Drama department
present various
American plays and musicals
throughout the year for the
dramatic education (and gen
eral education) of the
Stanford community. The
Stanford Savoyards, however,
add a different genre of
drama into focus. For 37
years, the Savoyards have
been bringing the comedic
operas of Gilbert and Sullivan
to Stanford stages. This
weekend, they present their
most successful and well
known opera, "The Mikado."
For those of you who
have never been to an opera
before, "The Mikado" would
not fit your general expecta
tion of a show full of fat
sopranos breaking glasses and
singing in Italian. Instead,
"The Mikado" is set in Japan
and sung in English. As if
that is not enough, there are
subtitles projected onto the
wall of the theater to assist
with understanding of the
musical. The fun and dynam
ic plot helps move the story
along and there is plenty of
unsung dialogue for those
who are not totally musically
inclined.
The show itself is
engaging. Gilbert has a knack
for stories and characters that

are at ease with poking fun at
politics and social constructs.
The humor is a bit dated for a
modern audience, but still

holds applicable entertain
ment value. The songs and
script are loaded with British
anachronisms. If you are the
kind of person who appreci
ates Victorian-era Brits

imposing their humor and
culture on story lines in east
ern nations, then this is defi
nitely the show for you.

As for the aesthetic of
the show, it straddles the line
between humorous and
gaudy. The costumes and
makeup are visually captivat
ing, but sometimes seem over

the top. Part of this may be to
respect the style of theater
this piece was written for.
Part of this may be due to the

fact that Stanford drama pro
ductions are taking the major
ity of budget cuts. Either way,
the director and cast work
well with what they have.
From its onset, the

production is clever and
endearing. Stagehands
dressed as ninjas dart to and
fro, chasing each other sur-

reptitiously around the stage
in a comedic fashion.
Throughout the rest of the
show, the stagehands darn
this ninja attire and keep their
countenance. The ensemble,

however, doesn't take away
attention from the talent of
the main cast. All of the leads
are charming actors who have
no problem evoking laughs
from the audience. The male
leads own the stage with their
charisma. The show also
sports a wide array of amaz
ing singers, who were obvi
ously cast on their singing
ability and not for their coor
dination in dance. To be fair,
the choreography wasn't
much to begin with.
Ultimately, the show was
delightful and fun to watch. 1
would highly recommend the
Savoyards' performance as a
way to experience this world
famous opera.
"The Mikado" will be
playing in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Jan. 22 and Jan.
23 at 8:00 p.m. and Jan. 24 at
2:30 p.m. Tickets are $lO for
students and can be pur
chased at the Stanford Ticket
Office in Tresidder Memorial
Union.
