# Remote Nomad: Starz Rising or Falling?

I feel so violated right now.
I just finished watching a
leaked version of the pilot
"Spartacus: Blood and Sand,"
and I'll never look at blood or
my female anatomy in the
same way.
When I walked out of
the theater after seeing
"Avatar" in Imax 3-D, I took
a few minutes to realize that
the people around me were
not speaking Nav'l, before
peeling the contacts that had
congealed to my wide-open
eyeballs due to the James
Cameron visual explosion. I
then remembered the one
preview the theater had
shown: a preview for Starz's
newest TV show, "Spartacus:
Blood and Sand."
Upon seeing the trail
er, I rolled my eyeballs,
which were still functioning
at that point, because I hate
gladiators. Yes, I'm a Latin
minor, but last year in my
Ancient Empires IHUM,
every third person was writ
ing his research paper on
them and my classmates
waged recall wars for second
ary sources in my inbox. I've
never been particularly inter
ested in who these gladiators
were, why they were forced
to fight and whether they won
or not. I chalk it all up to
slavery and imperialism in
ancient Rome. If you argue
that gladiators are the ancient
predecessors of boxing and

wrestling as professional
sports, then you can definitely
understand why I'm not a fan.
The "Avatar" connec
tion is not entirely irrelevant.
"Spartacus" presents the story
of the second Spartacus (they
call him Spartacus because
they don't know his name;
it's kind of like the second
coming and the guy could
also play Jesus if Starz ever

decides to violate that popular
historical figure). Spartacus'
life begins as a leader of the
Thracians, a group of Greek
men who agree to help the
Romans fight the barbarians
to the North and as a husband
in a simultaneously and
almost contradictorily sexual
and loving marriage. The
series can best be summa
rized as sex spattered in CGI
blood with a side of anachro
nistic swearing (way less
effective than "Deadwood"
because you never know
when to expect it on
"Spartacus." Every few min
utes, a Thracian will break
into a Turrets soliloquy of f
bombs and see you next

Tuesdays). And, when I say
sex, I mean montages of dif
ferent positions.
You could call it a
fusion of "300" and "The
Tudors." While the former is
its most obvious influence,
"The Tudors" model of a con
trived thematic connection
between politics and gratu
itous sex is replicated here.
Although I shouldn't have

high historical expectations
for "Spartacus," and the show
itself doesn't purport to be
accurate because it establish
es itself as a sequel to the
original Spartacus story, the
cliches of gladiators as lovers
who fight to ease the pain and
avaricious politicians and
their manipulative wives have
been the status quo for depic
tions of ancient Rome since
Graves published "I,
Claudius" in 1934.
Starz's ambition to
maximize its use of its
unedited content has resulted
in an hour of TV that seeks to
titillate and distract, not
immerse you in a place or
story. I could barely follow
the plot of the pilot, which is
supposed to establish how
Spartacus comes to be a glad
iator and what each of the
Roman politicians is after. If
you don't want to commit to
all of "300," or if you want to
see some naked girl on girl,
watch tonight's premiere. But
after that, I beg you, never

look back.
I had such high hopes
for "Spartacus" after I
watched the first season of
"Party Down" over break.
"Party Down," the brainchild
of "Veronica Mars" creator
Rob Thomas (no, not that
one), follows a team of out
of-work actors working as
caterers. In that venue, the
swearing is appropriate, the
characters well drawn and the
humor always changing. Jane
Lynch was a cast member for
the first half of the season
and will be replaced by
Megan Mullally in the second
season. As we saw in the
Zoot Suit episode of "Glee,"
Megan will have big shoes to
fill.
I appreciate that Starz
is an insignificant enough
movie channel that they show
old movies like '9os Woody
Allen and that they gave the
world "Party Down," but I
will spend the rest of my life
questioning why I study
Classics because of projects
like "Spartacus."

I'll never look at blood or
my female anatomy in the
//
same way.
