## COUGAR TAMING Stanford men's volleyball travels to Provo to take on BYU 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
After opening with a successful
weekend sweep of No. 8 Hawaii, the
No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball team
travels to Utah to face No. 5 BYU for
another weekend of challenging
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) competition.
"We executed pretty well on of
fense and defense," said Stanford
head coach John Kosty of the Hawaii
matches. "It was good for us not hav
ing to rely on a big serving night to
win the match. We did have a big
serving night, but we sided out at a
high level in both matches, so serving
was icing on the cake."
While the Cardinal swept Hawaii
over the weekend, BYU swept its
two matches against Pacific.
During BYU's home opener on
Friday, outside hitters Andrew Stew
art and Kevin Sagers led the Cougars
offensively with nine kills each.
BYU's biggest advantage came from
powerful middle blockers that rallied
18 blocks for the night, led by Russell
Lavaja and Futi Tavana, who each
put up seven. The following night,
BYU's offensive leaders Robb Stow
ell and Stewart hit 13 and 10 kills, re
spectively. The Cougars swept Pacific
both nights 3-0.
BYU features a strong team that
faced three other MPSF teams al
ready No. 2 UC-Irvine, No. 8
UCLA and No. 9 Cal State North
ridge. While it was only tournament
play, BYU pulled out wins over
Irvine, the defending national cham
pions and UCLA. However, the
Cougars fell to Northridge.
Kosty expects it to be "a dog
fight."
Last year, Stanford beat BYU two
of the three times they matched up.
The loss was the result of a five-set
thriller and the two wins were 3-0
sweeps. But, another year adds more
experience and consistency.
"Both teams are very consistent
and don't make a lot of unforced er
rors," Kosty said. "As usual for men's
volleyball, the serving and passing
battle will probably decide the
match."
With sophomore libero Erik Shoji
on the Stanford side, who racked up
20 digs last weekend, the passing is
expected to be solid. Shoji is the de
fensive leader for the Card and has
put up numbers to blow away any na
tional competition.
"I think our biggest strength at
this point is our ball control," Shoji
said. "Each match, we try to force our
opponent into the mistakes by not
making them ourselves. Also, we try
to be 'in-system' as much as possible,
which makes it more difficult for our

opponents to stop us."
And, as Kosty mentioned, the
serving game will be one of the defin
ing factors of the match. Last week
end, the Card was fortunate enough
not to have to depend on its serves.
Even still, sophomore outside hitter
Brad Lawson dominated with five
aces of the 10.
Although Stanford has a stacked
lineup that is senior-led by setter
Kawika Shoji, opposite Evan
Romero and middle blocker Garrett
Werner, playing the first away match
of the season at BYU has its chal
lenges.
"The best thing about BYU is
their crowd. There are a lot of them
and they can be loud," Werner said.
"The gym's a lot of fun to play in be
cause the crowd surrounds you.
When you go back to serve ... [they
are] pretty much breathing down
your neck behind you."
BYU continuously brings in thou
sands of fans, which might be a slight
disadvantage if the Card begins to
lose focus.
"Even with an opposing crowd, I
think our focus will be even stronger,
since we'll only want to concentrate
on our play and not their fans," Wern
er said.
Despite outside factors, Stanford
should match up evenly against
BYU, as both teams boast similar
styles of play, which reinforces the
need for good serving and passing.
Both teams are strong offensively
and are capable of tough defense.
This weekend will be another im
portant series in deciding where the
Cardinal will stand in the MPSF.
Men's volleyball will return home
on Jan. 23 in Burnham Pavilion to
play UC-Santa Barbara at 7 p.m.
