# STARTING POINT FOR TENNIS

### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team
will play its home opener on Saturday
against Sacramento State. The No. 9
Cardinal is brimming with confidence
after a promising fall season and a
successful Sherwood Cup last week
end.
"We got some competition in
against some good players, shook the
cobwebs off and stayed healthy," said
head coach John Whitlinger, "so I'm
pretty happy."
The Cardinal is poised to make it
past the second round of the NCAA
tournament for the first time since
2006.
"We're going to keep working and
keep our sights on the NCAAs in
May," said sophomore Bradley
Klahn. "There's a lot of good teams
out there, but we feel pretty good
about our team."
NCAA tennis matches consist of
six singles matches and three doubles
matches. Each singles match counts
for one point and the best two-out-of
three winner of doubles gets a point.
