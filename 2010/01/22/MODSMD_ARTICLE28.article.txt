# STARTING POINT FOR TENNIS
## 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team
will play its home opener on Saturday
against Sacramento State. The No. 9
Cardinal is brimming with confidence
after a promising fall season and a
successful Sherwood Cup last week
end.
"We got some competition in
against some good players, shook the
cobwebs off and stayed healthy," said
head coach John Whitlinger, "so I'm
pretty happy."
The Cardinal is poised to make it
past the second round of the NCAA
tournament for the first time since
2006.
"We're going to keep working and
keep our sights on the NCAAs in
May," said sophomore Bradley
Klahn. "There's a lot of good teams
out there, but we feel pretty good
about our team."
NCAA tennis matches consist of
six singles matches and three doubles
matches. Each singles match counts
for one point and the best two-out-of
three winner of doubles gets a point.

Sophomore Bradley Klahn leads the No. 9 Stanford men's tennis team in its first dual meet against
Sacramento State this Saturday. Klahn is coming off a victory in last weekend's Sherwood Cup, and he
and doubles partner sophomore Ryan Thacher are ranked No. 1 in the nation in doubles.

37 national singles ranking and
Klahn has been slotted at No. 54.
Klahn is coming off a singles
tournament victory at the Sher
wood Cup last weekend.
"It's a huge confidence booster to
start the season with a win," Klahn
said. "And I kept improving with
each match. But, I'm still working
on my fitness and trying to shore up
a few holes in my game,"
While the singles lineup is rela
tively set, the doubles pairings are a
work in progress. Stanford's ability
to make a deep run in the NCAA
tournament could depend on its

doubles teams.
"It's very important to get that
doubles point," Whitlinger ex
plained, "so we'll keep tinkering
with the pairing over the course of
the year to try and find out which
teams work best."
One sure thing is that sopho
mores Klahn and Thacher will be
playing doubles together in the top
slot. The duo compiled a 12-1
record during the fall season and
enters the spring as the No. 1 team
in the nation.
Saturday will be fans' first op
portunity to see the members of the
freshman class in action. Kandath,
Lin, Sam Ecker and Walker Kehrer
make up a group that has been
ranked the top recruiting class in
the nation by tennisrecruiting.net.
"It's exciting to finally get to

play at Taube [Family Tennis Cen
ter]," Kandath said. "Hopefully we
can go out there and get a win
against Sacramento State."
The Sacramento State Hornets
have been picked to repeat as Big
Sky Conference champions. They
return league MVP Kiryl Harbat
siuk and senior Anton Stryhas. As
doubles partners, they posted a 15-
7 record last spring.
Stanford looks to start its dual
match schedule with a win on Satur
day at 1 p.m. at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.
Saturday's forecast calls for a
chance of rain in the afternoon, but
there are no plans to postpone the
match at this point.
