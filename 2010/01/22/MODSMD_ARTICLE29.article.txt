# What type of athlete are you?
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
If you were a Stanford athlete,
which season would you want
your sport in fall, winter or
spring? Would you want to get
to campus while it is barren and life
less and open the Stanford sporting
season? Would you want to cut your
winter break a little short to prep for
the winter season, competing during
a lull in the Stanford atmosphere? Or
do you want a spring sport, closing
out the Stanford sports season as the
campus is abuzz with the energetic
aura of spring quarter? Let's take a
look at the upsides and downsides to
each sporting season.
An advantage of fall sports is that
they are the first to begin a new
school year. New freshmen, an excit
ing time on campus and great weath
er all factor into more enthusiastic
and spirited Stanford fans. In addi
tion, several of Stanford's most suc
cessful teams play in the fall, includ
ing women's soccer, women's volley
ball and men's water polo. These
sports also bank off of football,
which is the fall sport across the na
tion. Success in football translates to
even more excitement over other fall
sports. Not to mention, the weather is
particularly nice up here from Au
gust to November, so it's a nice time
to play and watch sports.
Perhaps the biggest downside for
fall sports is that all of them have to
report early for practice. That means
their summers get cut short and by
the first or second week of August
they return to Stanford to start train
ing, usually living in some dorm. For
some athletes it's a fun time, but for
others, it is a bit too much. But since
some teams start playing at the end
of August nearly a full month be
fore any other students get to Stan
ford they have to start early.
But starting early means you end
early and fall sports do just that. By
December, the sports are over and
the fall athletes get the rest of the
year off. While this does not mean
that they stop practicing and train
ing, they have no competitions and
are mandated by the NCAA to prac
tice less. For some, this is a welcomed
time off to rest. For others, it is a time
to catch up on school work and take
harder loads and harder classes. For
the rest, their weekends begin on
Thursday.
There definitely aren't as many
big name sports in winter as there are
in fall and spring, with the exception
of basketball. While basketball is the
heavy hitter of the winter sports,
sports like men's volleyball, gymnas
tics, swimming and wrestling are fun
spectator sports.
An upside that winter quarter
sports have is that there are fewer
things going on around campus. This
means that: 1. athletes get less dis
tracted with social and University
wide events and 2. the general stu
dent body may have more time to
come to sporting events.
Some downsides include, for cer
tain sports, cutting Winter Break
short to return early and train for
competition. Another is the weather,
which often is not favorable to prac
ticing and playing outdoors. While al
most all winter sports are played in
doors, lots of practices still take place
outside and sports that need to prac
tice for the upcoming spring season
are affected as well.
While some would argue that
sports are just better in the fall, win
ter sports have the hardware to
prove that they are just as good if not
better. For example, this winter we
will be following our women's bas
ketball team as it goes for a third
straight Final Four appearance, as
well as our world-record holding
swimmers and the No. 1 men's gym
nastics team.
The sweet smell of spring brings
the final stretch of Stanford sports,
some of which are baseball, softball,
women's lacrosse, tennis, women's
water polo and track and field. All
these outdoor sports are played
under the warm weather and most go
well into late May and June.Track ex
tends to the day before graduation
and baseball postseason goes far be
yond graduation. Spring sport ath
letes that have been waiting all year
to play finally get the chance come
March and April this time for
real.
Obvious upsides to spring quarter

sports include finishing out the Stan
ford sports season, the nice weather
that rarely affects practices and com
petition and the general atmosphere
around the Stanford community in
spring. Look around to find students
sunbathing on the lawn at Sunken
Diamond or jumping between a
track meet, a water polo game and
tennis match all going on at the same
time, all within 100 yards of each
other.
Downsides include having to wait
all year to finally step on the field
and a lot of social distractions. It
often is hard to practice and train in
tensely in October when you know
you won't be stepping on the field
until March or April. Spring quarter
is also the most social and fun quar
ter at Stanford. It is tough for some
athletes to go to bed because of prac
tice or a game while there are people
yelling and music blasting down
stairs or even right outside their
door. While for many athletes it's a
no-brainer tradeoff, for others it's
actually kind of tough to get ade
quate rest.
I cannot fail to mention sports
that run through both or all seasons,
muddling the seasonal divisions and
making for a long and tenuous year.
The ones that jump out to me are

swimming, tennis, baseball and soft
ball and cross country/track and
field. These sports have competi
tions that span two quarters and
keep the athletes in competition
mode for several months in a row. In
fact, all cross country athletes at
Stanford run fall, winter AND spring
seasons: cross country in the fall, in
door track in the winter and outdoor
track in the spring. One season of
competition is enough, let alone
three in a row with little break in be
tween. The athletes of these sports
have to stay healthy and motivated
over a longer period of time than
some others.
So what kind of athlete are you?
Are you a first-out-of-the-gate, early
riser athlete that gets all the hard
work out of the way, so the rest of the
year is yours to have? Or are you one
of those people that never liked to
present their project first, but defi
nitely would go second? Or maybe
you are a spring-sporter, waiting all
school year, closing out the sports
season on the Farm under the sun
shine and playing off the energy
from a fun and active campus. Per
haps you want to take it all on and
join the Stanford distance runners
and compete all three quarters. Per
haps you don't want to be an athlete
and would rather every weekend
start on Thursday.

time, all within 100 yards of each
other.
Downsides include having to wait
all year to finally step on the field
and a lot of social distractions. It
often is hard to practice and train in
tensely in October when you know
you won't be stepping on the field
until March or April. Spring quarter
is also the most social and fun quar
ter at Stanford. It is tough for some
athletes to go to bed because of prac
tice or a game while there are people
yelling and music blasting down
stairs or even right outside their
door. While for many athletes it's a
no-brainer tradeoff, for others it's
actually kind of tough to get ade
quate rest.
I cannot fail to mention sports
that run through both or all seasons,
muddling the seasonal divisions and
making for a long and tenuous year.
The ones that jump out to me are

swimming, tennis, baseball and soft
ball and cross country/track and
field. These sports have competi
tions that span two quarters and
keep the athletes in competition
mode for several months in a row. In
fact, all cross country athletes at
Stanford run fall, winter AND spring
seasons: cross country in the fall, in
door track in the winter and outdoor
track in the spring. One season of
competition is enough, let alone
three in a row with little break in be
tween. The athletes of these sports
have to stay healthy and motivated
over a longer period of time than
some others.
So what kind of athlete are you?
Are you a first-out-of-the-gate, early
riser athlete that gets all the hard
work out of the way, so the rest of the
year is yours to have? Or are you one
of those people that never liked to
present their project first, but defi
nitely would go second? Or maybe
you are a spring-sporter, waiting all
school year, closing out the sports
season on the Farm under the sun
shine and playing off the energy
from a fun and active campus. Per
haps you want to take it all on and
join the Stanford distance runners
and compete all three quarters. Per
haps you don't want to be an athlete
and would rather every weekend
start on Thursday.

If you were a Stanford athlete,
which season would you want
your sport in fall, winter or
spring? Would you want to get
to campus while it is barren and life
less and open the Stanford sporting
season? Would you want to cut your
winter break a little short to prep for
the winter season, competing during
a lull in the Stanford atmosphere? Or
do you want a spring sport, closing
out the Stanford sports season as the
campus is abuzz with the energetic
aura of spring quarter? Let's take a
look at the upsides and downsides to
each sporting season.
An advantage of fall sports is that
they are the first to begin a new
school year. New freshmen, an excit
ing time on campus and great weath
er all factor into more enthusiastic
and spirited Stanford fans. In addi
tion, several of Stanford's most suc
cessful teams play in the fall, includ
ing women's soccer, women's volley
ball and men's water polo. These
sports also bank off of football,
which is the fall sport across the na
tion. Success in football translates to
even more excitement over other fall
sports. Not to mention, the weather is
particularly nice up here from Au
gust to November, so it's a nice time
to play and watch sports.
Perhaps the biggest downside for
fall sports is that all of them have to
report early for practice. That means
their summers get cut short and by
the first or second week of August
they return to Stanford to start train
ing, usually living in some dorm. For
some athletes it's a fun time, but for
others, it is a bit too much. But since
some teams start playing at the end
of August nearly a full month be
fore any other students get to Stan
ford they have to start early.
But starting early means you end
early and fall sports do just that. By
December, the sports are over and
the fall athletes get the rest of the
year off. While this does not mean
that they stop practicing and train
ing, they have no competitions and
are mandated by the NCAA to prac
tice less. For some, this is a welcomed
time off to rest. For others, it is a time
to catch up on school work and take
harder loads and harder classes. For
the rest, their weekends begin on
Thursday.
There definitely aren't as many
big name sports in winter as there are
in fall and spring, with the exception
of basketball. While basketball is the
heavy hitter of the winter sports,
sports like men's volleyball, gymnas
tics, swimming and wrestling are fun
spectator sports.
An upside that winter quarter
sports have is that there are fewer
things going on around campus. This
means that: 1. athletes get less dis
tracted with social and University
wide events and 2. the general stu
dent body may have more time to
come to sporting events.
Some downsides include, for cer
tain sports, cutting Winter Break
short to return early and train for
competition. Another is the weather,
which often is not favorable to prac
ticing and playing outdoors. While al
most all winter sports are played in
doors, lots of practices still take place
outside and sports that need to prac
tice for the upcoming spring season
are affected as well.
While some would argue that
sports are just better in the fall, win
ter sports have the hardware to
prove that they are just as good if not
better. For example, this winter we
will be following our women's bas
ketball team as it goes for a third
straight Final Four appearance, as
well as our world-record holding
swimmers and the No. 1 men's gym
nastics team.
The sweet smell of spring brings
the final stretch of Stanford sports,
some of which are baseball, softball,
women's lacrosse, tennis, women's
water polo and track and field. All
these outdoor sports are played
under the warm weather and most go
well into late May and June.Track ex
tends to the day before graduation
and baseball postseason goes far be
yond graduation. Spring sport ath
letes that have been waiting all year
to play finally get the chance come
March and April this time for
real.
Obvious upsides to spring quarter

sports include finishing out the Stan
ford sports season, the nice weather
that rarely affects practices and com
petition and the general atmosphere
around the Stanford community in
spring. Look around to find students
sunbathing on the lawn at Sunken
Diamond or jumping between a
track meet, a water polo game and
tennis match all going on at the same
time, all within 100 yards of each
other.
Downsides include having to wait
all year to finally step on the field
