# BEATING THE BEAVERS
## Stanford shuts down OSU 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
They may have won their previous
six games, but the Cardinal women
came into last night's contest with
Oregon State amid mounting injuries
and increasing criticism. In short, they
needed a convincing win to build mo
mentum, boost confidence and prove
they deserved their No. 2 ranking.
While the Cardinal (16-1,6-0 Pac
-10) certainly came away with a com
fortable win, the Beavers challenged
Stanford early and held tough until
the final stretch, ultimately falling 63-
47. Stanford junior forward Kayla
Pedersen led her team with 23 points,
while Beaver Talisa Rhea scored a
game-high 26. Cardinal sophomore
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike post
ed a game-high nine rebounds.
Despite their recent struggles in
conference play, Oregon State (9-7,1-
5) was able to play Stanford almost
evenly for much of the game. After
jumping out to a 12-2 lead less than
four minutes in, the Cardinal could
not extend its lead to double digits
again for the rest of the half.
The Beavers began to tighten up
on defense soon thereafter, holding
the Cardinal scoreless for eight min
utes. Redshirt junior forward Michelle
Harrison put in a shot from behind the
arc to put Stanford back ahead at 16-
14. Rhea scored 17 points in the half,
helping to keep the Beavers close, as
Stanford only led 29-27 at halftime.
Stanford has never been tied or be
hind at halftime this season and last
night's two-point margin was the low
est it has taken to the locker room.
The second half, for the most part,
was a different story. Five minutes in,
Stanford extended the lead to 40-32
on a fastbreak three-pointer from
freshman Joslyn Tinkle. The forward
out of Missoula, Mont, finished the

game with nine points, six rebounds
and six blocks in 24 minutes.
The Beavers would pull within 42-
39 a few minutes later, but Pedersen
scored six straight points to put the
Cardinal back up, 48-39. Stanford did
not look back after that, running away
with a 63-47 victory.
