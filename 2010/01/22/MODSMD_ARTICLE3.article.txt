# BEATING THE BEAVERS
## Stanford shuts down OSU 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
They may have won their previous
six games, but the Cardinal women
came into last night's contest with
Oregon State amid mounting injuries
and increasing criticism. In short, they
needed a convincing win to build mo
mentum, boost confidence and prove
they deserved their No. 2 ranking.
While the Cardinal (16-1,6-0 Pac
-10) certainly came away with a com
fortable win, the Beavers challenged
Stanford early and held tough until
the final stretch, ultimately falling 63-
47. Stanford junior forward Kayla
Pedersen led her team with 23 points,
while Beaver Talisa Rhea scored a
game-high 26. Cardinal sophomore
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike post
ed a game-high nine rebounds.
Despite their recent struggles in
conference play, Oregon State (9-7,1-
5) was able to play Stanford almost
evenly for much of the game. After
jumping out to a 12-2 lead less than
four minutes in, the Cardinal could
not extend its lead to double digits
again for the rest of the half.
The Beavers began to tighten up
on defense soon thereafter, holding
the Cardinal scoreless for eight min
utes. Redshirt junior forward Michelle
Harrison put in a shot from behind the
arc to put Stanford back ahead at 16-
14. Rhea scored 17 points in the half,
helping to keep the Beavers close, as
Stanford only led 29-27 at halftime.
Stanford has never been tied or be
hind at halftime this season and last
night's two-point margin was the low
est it has taken to the locker room.
The second half, for the most part,
was a different story. Five minutes in,
Stanford extended the lead to 40-32
on a fastbreak three-pointer from
freshman Joslyn Tinkle. The forward
out of Missoula, Mont, finished the

game with nine points, six rebounds
and six blocks in 24 minutes.
The Beavers would pull within 42-
39 a few minutes later, but Pedersen
scored six straight points to put the
Cardinal back up, 48-39. Stanford did
not look back after that, running away
with a 63-47 victory.

The Stanford women's basketball team extended its undefeated Pac-10 record. Sophomore forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike powered the Cardinal to a win with a game-high nine rebounds.
While the Cardinal will no doubt
be content with a 16-point victory, it
stands as the latest in a string of games
that have seen the Cardinal perform
slightly below its stellar standards.
Going into last night's game, the Car
dinal had been averaging 21.6 points
per game better than their opponents.
Discounting an 80-43 rout of a strug
gling Washington State team, Stan
ford has posted an average margin of
victory of 13.75 points in its last five
contests.
One good sign for the Cardinal,
though, was the return of guards JJ
Hones and Jeanette Pohlen. Hones, a
redshirt junior, had been struggling
with a swollen knee and managed to
play for four minutes last night.
Pohlen missed her first game in 92
games last weekend after injuring her
ankle against Washington State, sit
ting out against Washington two days
later. She played for 27 minutes last
night and posted a game-high six as
sists.
Next up for the Cardinal is the
Beavers' in-state counterpart, the
Oregon Ducks. After a disappointing
2008-09 season, the Ducks (12-6,3-3)
have rebounded in a big way, posting
a 9-3 non-conference record and win
ning their first three Pac-10 games be
fore dropping two games to the Ari
zona schools and losing 72-62 to Cal
last night. The last time Stanford
faced the Ducks, the Cardinal blew
them out at Maples Pavilion in a dom
inant 72-43 win. This year, though,
there is plenty of reason to believe
that things could be different.
Oregon was selected in both pre
season polls to finish eighth in the
conference, but is currently leading
the nation in scoring with an average

of 87.4 points per game. They have
been enjoying contributions from up
and down the roster this season, in
cluding an impressive four players
who are averaging more than 10
points per game, compared to Stan
ford's three. One of them, senior
guard and Oregon points-leader Tay
lor Lilley, averages 16.4 points per

game and has 44 steals on the year (or
nearly three per game).
Stanford will take on the Ducks to
morrow morning at 11 a.m.
The Cardinal could not be reached
for comment.
