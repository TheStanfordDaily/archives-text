# Rematch on the mat for Stanford, Cal
## 
### JESSICA YU 
The third time was the charm for
Stanford men's gymnastics. After two
straight season-opening losses to the
California Golden Bears in 2008 and
2009, No. 1 Stanford finally broke
through last Friday night at Flaas
Pavilion in Berkeley. This Saturday,
No. 2 Cal looks to return the favor
when it comes to The Farm.
While several Stanford men post
ed tremendous scores that con
tributed to the team's 352.75-340.10
win over Cal, head coach Thorn Gliel
mi remained humble about Friday's
victory. When asked where he saw
room for improvement after Friday's
meet, Glielmi simply answered,
"Everywhere."
After all, Cal suddenly found itself
at a disadvantage last Friday when
sophomore Glen Ishino, one of Cal's
top all-around competitors, injured
himself during warm-ups. As a result,
Cal sent just five men to each event
and therefore had to count all five
scores in its team total. The slightest
misstep on any one routine affected
Cal's score. Meanwhile, Stanford sent
six men to each event and therefore
had the opportunity to selectively
count its top five scores. According to
Stanford redshirt senior and captain
Greg Ter-Zakhariants, who is also a
member of The Daily's business staff,
Cal could have added 10 points to its
final score had Ishino been able to
compete.
Stanford did have some impres
sive moments. While junior Tim Gen
try's rings routine and junior Ryan
Lieberman's high bar routine posted

big scores, sophomore Cameron
Foreman's parallel bars routine
added a bit of humor to the long night.
After missing his grip on a release
move, Foreman ended up with his
pants leg caught on the edge of the
bar. Fans, friends, rivals and team
mates could not help but join togeth
er in laughter as Foreman hung help
lessly from the apparatus. After 10
long seconds of tugging. Foreman fi
nally jumped down, ran for a new pair
of pants and got back on the bars to
finish his routine.
As Stanford prepares for its up
coming meets, Glielmi and his men
are adding difficulty to their routines
and perfecting their execution.
Stanford's goal, according to Ter-
Zakhariants, is to treat each gym ses
sion like a competition and to have
each competition mirror a gym ses
sion.

"We don't want anything excep
tionally different on the competition
floor," he said.
While he acknowledges that there
will be fluctuations in each person's
performance, Ter-Zakhariants wants
each of his teammates to go out
knowing exactly what to do and ex
pect.
This is especially important for the
freshmen. Three of Stanford's five
freshmen started their collegiate
gymnastics careers last Friday, with
freshman Eddie Penev posting partic
ularly high scores.
With that first competition out of
the way, Stanford's newcomers and
veterans are focusing on the road
ahead. As they make their way to
ward April's NCAA Championship,
they will be using each competition as
a lesson on what needs attention and
improvement.
Each face-off with Cal will be es
pecially important in the weeks to
come. According to Ter-Zakhariants,
having such a top-ranked team so
close to home helps Stanford gauge
its progress toward the NCAA
Championship. Not only is Cal known
for its clean, high-level gymnastics, it
boasts three strong all-around con
tenders — senior Brian del Castillo,
junior Kyle Bunthuwong and Ishino.
The stronger Stanford becomes
against its rivals, the more prepared it
will be for another national champi
onship.
Saturday's meet will be held at 7 p.m.
in Burnham Pavilion.
