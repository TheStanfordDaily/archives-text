## Blending arts, engineering Both arts, technical educations key, says dean 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
If Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting was
any indication, the balance between tradition
and innovation at Stanford will be a domi
nant concern for the University for years to
come.
For Engineering Dean Jim Plummer, the
lessons of past years are clear.
"We shouldn't be afraid to try experi
ments," he said.
Reporting on the School of Engineering
to the Faculty Senate, Plummer offered a
defense of academic exploration, and the
relaxed disciplinary lines that have allowed
for productive intellectual collaboration. His
presentation was the latest in a series of
Faculty Senate presentations that have
touched on similar themes and navigated
similar tensions in plotting away forward
for the University.
The engineering school's traditional
strengths will have to develop in upcoming
years, Plummer said, as cutting-edge fields of
research evolve.
"If you look broadly at what we're doing
in the School of Engineering, information
technology of course has been our historical
center of gravity, and historically it's been
about semiconductors and computers and
software," he said.
"Going forward, it's going to be about
Internet-based services, robotic vehicles, vir
tual worlds," he continued. "We have a large
presence in energy, a large presence in the
environment and a large presence in human

health, which lined up really well with the
broader University initiatives."
Plummer described Stanford as an institu
tion that has a unique potential to meet these
and other challenges of 21st-century scholar
ship.
"The great challenges that I described...
are largely interdisciplinary," Plummer said.
"Engineering, medicine. Engineering, busi
ness. Combinations of the different parts of
the University."
"The truth," he continued, "is that
Stanford has an unbelievably unique oppor
tunity to be dominant in these areas because
we are essentially unique in this country
we are essentially unique in the world for
having a great liberal arts University with ter
rific people and all of the necessary disci
plines, and a great engineering school embed
ded inside."
Plummer said that Stanford's liberal arts
gave it a significant advantage over technical
institutions, in particular MIT, which he
named as the University's "principal competi
tor." The dean also referred to the success of
the bioengineering program at Stanford as a
prime example of the potential benefits from
working across disciplines.
While touting these advantages, and their
impact on student recruiting, Plummer also
said that attention must be paid to the educa
tion of Stanford's student body and
pushed for an increased emphasis on techni
cal education.
"In engineering, students are actually
