## Blending arts, engineering Both arts, technical educations key, says dean 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
If Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting was
any indication, the balance between tradition
and innovation at Stanford will be a domi
nant concern for the University for years to
come.
For Engineering Dean Jim Plummer, the
lessons of past years are clear.
"We shouldn't be afraid to try experi
ments," he said.
Reporting on the School of Engineering
to the Faculty Senate, Plummer offered a
defense of academic exploration, and the
relaxed disciplinary lines that have allowed
for productive intellectual collaboration. His
presentation was the latest in a series of
Faculty Senate presentations that have
touched on similar themes and navigated
similar tensions in plotting away forward
for the University.
The engineering school's traditional
strengths will have to develop in upcoming
years, Plummer said, as cutting-edge fields of
research evolve.
"If you look broadly at what we're doing
in the School of Engineering, information
technology of course has been our historical
center of gravity, and historically it's been
about semiconductors and computers and
software," he said.
"Going forward, it's going to be about
Internet-based services, robotic vehicles, vir
tual worlds," he continued. "We have a large
presence in energy, a large presence in the
environment and a large presence in human

health, which lined up really well with the
broader University initiatives."
Plummer described Stanford as an institu
tion that has a unique potential to meet these
and other challenges of 21st-century scholar
ship.
"The great challenges that I described...
are largely interdisciplinary," Plummer said.
"Engineering, medicine. Engineering, busi
ness. Combinations of the different parts of
the University."
"The truth," he continued, "is that
Stanford has an unbelievably unique oppor
tunity to be dominant in these areas because
we are essentially unique in this country
we are essentially unique in the world for
having a great liberal arts University with ter
rific people and all of the necessary disci
plines, and a great engineering school embed
ded inside."
Plummer said that Stanford's liberal arts
gave it a significant advantage over technical
institutions, in particular MIT, which he
named as the University's "principal competi
tor." The dean also referred to the success of
the bioengineering program at Stanford as a
prime example of the potential benefits from
working across disciplines.
While touting these advantages, and their
impact on student recruiting, Plummer also
said that attention must be paid to the educa
tion of Stanford's student body and
pushed for an increased emphasis on techni
cal education.
"In engineering, students are actually
required to be educated in the liberal
arts as part of their education here at
Stanford," he said.
"The inverse is not true," he added.
"In fact, I believe, and many people in
the engineering school believe, that
every Stanford graduate ought to be
technically literate."
Plummer's remarks, and his
defense of innovation, preceded two
other presentations, both in favor of
changes in University life. Stephen
Monismith, engineering professor
and senior research fellow at the
Woods Institute, spoke in favor of
exploring the relaxation of research
restrictions on non-faculty, and Anne
Hannigan, associate vice president in
the Office of Research
Administration, presented a change
in practices for handling sponsored
research proposals.
These presentations drew con

trasting reactions from the Senate.
Monismith, reporting from the
Committee on Research, advocated
for the University to explore relaxing
its strict policies regarding principal
investigators the lead directors of
research. Currently, the University's
policy is that "principal investigator
ship or co-principal investigatorship
on externally-funded projects is limit
ed to members of the Academic
Council and the Medical Center Line
(MCL) faculty, with specific excep
tions" in essence, Stanford faculty
members in full standing.
Monismith introduced the poten
tial advantages of exploring addition
al exceptions, or expanding eligibility.
He cited the benefits of expanded
opportunities for postdoctoral schol
ars in their career development, as
well as the potential for the
University to engage in more
research that could capitalize upon
the talents of a larger number of
Stanford-affiliated researchers.
Although he expressed confidence
in the Committee's work, Provost
John Etchemendy responded to the

idea of relaxing standards with hesita
tion, citing concerns about the use of
University resources.
"What we would end up with is
incredibly uncontrolled growth of the
University," Etchemendy said, adding
that the University should be "awful
ly cautious in any kind of exception."
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni also
voiced a concern about the potential
for exploiting postdoctoral scholars,
as their increased eligibility for
research funding could allow faculty
members to secure excessive research
resources in a roundabout fashion.
Hannigan's report, concerning the
streamlining of research administra
tion procedures through improved
software, was met with a more posi
tive reaction. She cited improvements
in the processing of research propos
als that brought processing time to
under two days, down from approxi
mately eight to 10 days.
The Faculty Senate will meet again
Feb. 4.
