## 'Sleep' endures first year without GER distinction 
### LAUREN WILSON 
For 38 years, psychiatry and behavioral
sciences Prof. William Dement's class,
Psychiatry 135: Sleep and Dreams, has been
a fixture of the campus curriculum. This
year, the course has proceeded but with
some changes that could possibly impact
course enrollment.
Winter quarter marks the first time
Sleep and Dreams will be offered without
its once standard natural sciences General
Education Requirement (GER). Last year,
the elimination of the course's GER caused
a great deal of confusion and led to Dement
accusing the Senate Subcommittee on
General Education Requirements of failing
to inform him why his course had been
stripped of its GER.
Despite all the commotion, Dement was
not worried by the change and believes that
the course remains true to its main princi
ples.
"Natural science isn't the purpose of the
course," Dement said.
"The course is to
teach students how
to manage their

sleep and not to fall asleep at the wheel,
which is really important."
Based on class enrollment since the
2000-01 academic year, Sleep and Dreams
has remained one of the most popular
classes on campus. According to the Office
of the Registrar, the class size in winter
quarter of 2001-02 reached 281 students
while the next year, numbers rose slightly
to 288.
However, in 2002-03, when Dement
announced his retirement, class numbers
spiked to 826 as students scrambled to take
Sleep and Dreams before it was too late.
The professor returned for the 2005-06 aca
demic year, with 670 students enrolling
after the class' two-year hiatus.
Since then, class enrollment has been
steadily decreasing 472 students
enrolled last winter. This year, the drop-off
for winter quarter enrollment has been
considerable with 194 students; however, it
is unclear whether the numbers were influ
enced by the absence of the GER or
because the course will also be offered in

the spring.
"Well to be perfectly honest, I
don't know," Dement said. "This is
the first year I've offered the course
two quarters."

Still, Dement has not given up the
fight to regain the natural science
GER.

"One of the things we're thinking of
doing is asking the committee what actual
ly qualifies," Dement said.
"I'm willing to go a certain distance and
add something on for people who'd like
to fulfill their natural science require
ment," he added.
Dement says he's assigned the
task to one of his TAs to find out what
they would need to add.
"It might be too much, but since it qual-
