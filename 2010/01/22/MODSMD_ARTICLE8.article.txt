## 'Sleep' endures first year without GER distinction 
### LAUREN WILSON 
For 38 years, psychiatry and behavioral
sciences Prof. William Dement's class,
Psychiatry 135: Sleep and Dreams, has been
a fixture of the campus curriculum. This
year, the course has proceeded but with
some changes that could possibly impact
course enrollment.
Winter quarter marks the first time
Sleep and Dreams will be offered without
its once standard natural sciences General
Education Requirement (GER). Last year,
the elimination of the course's GER caused
a great deal of confusion and led to Dement
accusing the Senate Subcommittee on
General Education Requirements of failing
to inform him why his course had been
stripped of its GER.
Despite all the commotion, Dement was
not worried by the change and believes that
the course remains true to its main princi
ples.
"Natural science isn't the purpose of the
course," Dement said.
"The course is to
teach students how
to manage their

sleep and not to fall asleep at the wheel,
which is really important."
Based on class enrollment since the
2000-01 academic year, Sleep and Dreams
has remained one of the most popular
classes on campus. According to the Office
of the Registrar, the class size in winter
quarter of 2001-02 reached 281 students
while the next year, numbers rose slightly
to 288.
However, in 2002-03, when Dement
announced his retirement, class numbers
spiked to 826 as students scrambled to take
Sleep and Dreams before it was too late.
The professor returned for the 2005-06 aca
demic year, with 670 students enrolling
after the class' two-year hiatus.
Since then, class enrollment has been
steadily decreasing 472 students
enrolled last winter. This year, the drop-off
for winter quarter enrollment has been
considerable with 194 students; however, it
is unclear whether the numbers were influ
enced by the absence of the GER or
because the course will also be offered in

the spring.
"Well to be perfectly honest, I
don't know," Dement said. "This is
the first year I've offered the course
two quarters."

Still, Dement has not given up the
fight to regain the natural science
GER.

"One of the things we're thinking of
doing is asking the committee what actual
ly qualifies," Dement said.
"I'm willing to go a certain distance and
add something on for people who'd like
to fulfill their natural science require
ment," he added.
Dement says he's assigned the
task to one of his TAs to find out what
they would need to add.
"It might be too much, but since it qual-


XIN SHAN/The Stanford Daily
ified for several years, it would be
weird if it was in fact totally zero,"
he said. "You know, science is more
than molecules by a long shot. There
is a science of sleep research. We
look at neurons and sleep in other
animals."
Dement maintains that he has
not changed anything about the
core curriculum.
Will Perl 'l2 took the class last
year. Although he says he would not
have taken the class without the
GER, he still enjoyed it.
"The stuff you learn is just inter
esting and applicable," he said. "It
should definitely fill the GER
because it's important content that
everyone should know and [the
GER] motivates people to take the
class. I mean it's not biology or
chemistry, but it's all based on sci
ence."
For others, the natural science
GER removal hasn't affected their
enrollment.
"I mean, had it had a GER I

would have taken it without a hesi
tation, but the fact that it doesn't
meet the GER requirement any
more made me hesitate before
deciding to take it," said Danny
Organ 'l3, who is currently
enrolled in the class. "I ultimately
decided to take it and I'm really
glad I did because Dement is awe
some."
Elise Thygesen 'l3 agreed.
"I'll probably take it next year as
long as Dement is teaching it, even
if it doesn't satisfy the GER,
because Dement is one of the most
famous professors at Stanford," she
said. "Everyone says you should
take his class."
While rumors of Dement's
retirement circulate every year, the
professor believes that he'll be
teaching for as long as his health
permits.
"It's a lot of fun," he said. "I
enjoy giving talks in the dormitories
so no only if health forces me
and I'm not a young chicken any
more that's for sure but as far as I
know, I'm healthy and all that. I
have all my mental faculties."
