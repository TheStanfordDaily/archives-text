## Students and profs, send aid to Haiti 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR 
In 1989, the 7.0-magnitude Loma Prieta
earthquake shook campus, inflicting billions
of dollars in damage, but no fatalities. Yet on
Jan. 12, an earthquake of the same magnitude
that rocked the small island nation of Haiti
left at least tens of thousands of people dead
and over a million homeless.
Like many others around the world, mem
bers of the Stanford community, especially
those with ties to the country, have stepped
forward to help.
As of Thursday, Stanford faculty, staff and
students had raised an estimated $66,000 to
send to Hopital Albert Schweitzer (HAS),
the only remaining fully functional hospital
near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince.
Stanford Hospital has set up a challenge
grant that will match contributions up to
$104,000 to HAS, according to Ruth Ann
Richter, director of media relations at the
Stanford School of Medicine. The matching
donations program brings current donations
for HAS up to about $132,000.
Spearheading many of the fundraising efforts
have been Stanford physicians with personal
ties to the hospital.
Ralph Greco, professor of surgery, was
close friends with late hospital founder Larry
Mellon. He spent several months working at
HAS in the early '7os and has led groups of
Stanford medical students on aid missions to
the country. Greco, who has been in contact
with a team of Stanford physicians led by Dr.
Paul Auerbach in Haiti, reported a high

demand for operational procedures.
"Anyone with a head or chest injury didn't
survive," Greco said. "People at the hospital
have extremity injuries crushed limbs, bro
ken bones. There's a huge need for trauma
and orthopedic surgeons."
Doctors have set up makeshift operating
rooms to treat the high number of injured,
wrote Dean of Global Health Michele
Barry in an e-mail to The Daily. Barry, like
Greco, has spent time working at HAS and
is working with him to raise funds. She
spoke about a colleague in the Doctors
Without Borders program who had to oper
ate on a desk.
"My on-the-ground folks say it is chaotic,"
she said. "Infrastructure has totally crumbled
so [it is] difficult to assess people."
Amid this scattered state of materials and
personnel, recent graduate Josh Nesbit 'O9 is
helping to make sure aid goes where it is
needed the most. Nesbit is the executive
director of FrontlineSMSMedic, a non-profit
he co-founded while at Stanford. The service
allows Haitians who needed help to send text
messages to the number 4636. Haitian
American volunteers translate, triangulate
and categorize the messages based on
urgency and send aid accordingly.
"It's a sort of de facto 911 service," Nesbit
said. "It allows people on the ground to relay
their needs and allows organizations to coor
dinate larger aid efforts."
While physicians and emergency aid
organizations remain focused on providing
immediate relief, others have started to look

toward the long-term rebuilding of the coun
try.
Lindsay Arnold 'O2, now a student at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB),
interned at the International Republican
Institute, a non-partisan organization in Port
au-Prince, after graduation. Spending several
months there over the course of three years,
Arnold working with her fellow GSB stu
dents to assist relief efforts. In addition to
organizing a charity event at the GSB, Arnold
is working with classmates in her Power of
Social Technology class to create a viral cam
paign focused on long-term rebuilding efforts
in Haiti.
Although Arnold has plans to visit Haiti in
the future, she says the most important way
Americans can help now is through monetary
donation.
"As supporters, what's most important is
to provide supplies and not get in the way of
relief efforts," she said. "The most helpful
thing at the moment is to obtain funds in the
States."
Greco echoed Arnold's call for donations,
saying the developed world has neglected the
island nation for too long.
"I think Haiti needs support from the U.N.
and especially the U. 5.," Greco said. "It's 700
miles from Miami and we can no longer turn
our backs to the country. We need long-term
commitment â€”we could play a big role in
Haiti's future if we wanted to."
