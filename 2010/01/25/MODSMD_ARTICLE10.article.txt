## A 						Tale of 23 Transfers 
### STEPHANIE LIOU 
Somewhere in the middle of complaining
about Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) and watching a meteor shower
with friends at 2 a.m., Stanford became
home. But at the same time that all 1,700
bright-eyed freshmen arrived on campus and were

learning how to navigate its perilous bike round
abouts and newfound freedoms, the 23 members
of the small but mighty transfer class of 'l3 was
also settling in, experiencing a new albeit differ
ent transitional process of their own.
Making it through the steep 1.9 percent trans
fer admit rate, these transfer students now call
Stanford home after stints at other universities.
So how does Stanford compare to their past

schools?
All the transfers agreed that the
caliber of academics was the main
thing that attracted them to
Stanford, but the Farm's unique
campus and entrepreneurial life
were also draws.
"I was also admitted to four
other top schools besides Stanford,
but specifically chose Stanford," said
Ravshan Abzalov 'll, who trans
ferred from Drexel University. "I

think that Stanford is a unique uni
versity and differs much from its east
coast peers." Abzalov said that
Stanford's "entrepreneurial and
innovative environment" and
"inspiring campus" have measured
up to his initial expectations and he
has enjoyed the challenging classes,
dorm life and his involvement with
Alpha Kappa Psi immensely.
Rebekah Silva 'll, a transfer
from Riverside Community College,
agreed.
"I was admitted to several
schools as a transfer student, but

Stanford was my first choice for many reasons. The
Stanford alumni I have met have been more than
impressive and it was actually alumni who encour
aged me to apply," Silva said. "Second, Stanford's
chemistry department is world-renowned and I
wanted to receive instruction from the depart
ment's professors and participate in undergradu
ate research. I also knew that I wanted a campus
that was beautiful, full of greenery and peaceful.
Stanford's campus is all of those things!"
Getting in and committing was only the begin
ning, however. As most freshmen quickly realize,
Stanford moves fast and transfer student Diana
Munoz 'll can confirm that Stanford's high price
tag does not buy you a picnic.
"It was definitely difficult to adjust to the speed
of the quarter system, but I think now I will be bet
ter prepared for the winter quarter," Munoz said.
"The work load is a lot more than I used to expe
rience at my community college, but the material is
just fascinating, so it makes it worthwhile."
"The pace is a bit faster than I'm used to, but
I'm managing it fine," said Lena Schoemaker 'll, a
transfer from the University of Utah. "I still think
that semesters are the way to go, but it's nice hav
ing classes done faster in the year. There are so
many opportunities on campus that it's sometimes
hard to manage one's time between academics,
social and extra-curricular activities!"
It wasn't just the difficulty of pacing and sched
uling that the transfers had to adjust to, either.

Stanford's tough classes definitely lived up to the
expectations of our challenge-seeking transfers.
Silva readily acknowledged that fall quarter
was a hard-won battle, especially after she was
struck with a bout of HINI right before back-to
back midterms. Despite the setback, she proudly
emerged with an "A" in Math 51.
"Stanford is really difficult! The problem-sets
and exams can be mind-numbing," Silva said.
"Some of my experiences have been a real baptism
by fire. But I knew I would be challenged and
Stanford has certainly not disappointed."
"Academically, Stanford is more challenging
than Drexel," Abzalov agreed. "[The] curriculum
is more rigorous and midterms are not as

straightforward. Most of the time, you really need
to think outside of the box to come up with the
right answer. My first encounter with the rigor of
testing at Stanford was my first Stats midterm
where for the first time in my academic career I
wasn't able to finish the test in the time given.
That was like WOW! I realize that I am at
Stanford now!"
However, the personal connections and friend
ship made throughout college can be equally if not
more important than the academics and the trans
fer process undeniably takes a toll upon these rela
tionships.
"Adjusting is much more difficult than I had
anticipated," confided Farbod Faraji 'll, who holds
the touchy distinction of being a transfer student
from our nemesis, UC-Berkely. "People are very
elated to hear that I got accepted to Stanford, but
fail to realize how difficult it is to leave a school,
especially the comfort level there and all the valu
able connections and friends made over the years."
Schoemaker had similar sentiments.
"Socially, there are many great people on cam
pus but sometimes it's hard to break into the scene
since we weren't here our freshman year so we
weren't integrated right away into social situa
tions," she said.
Overall, the transfers reported positive experi
ences, despite some initial difficulties. The efforts
of the administration and residential staff have not
gone overlooked, either.
"The faculty, student body and the Kimball stu
dent staff have been more than welcoming," Silva
said. "I could not imagine being anywhere else."
Becoming a Cardinal also means tapping into
the great sense of pride that permeates and unites
our campus.
"There is a bigger sense of pride here," Munoz
said. "My worst moment [of fall quarter] was los
ing to Cal and having my friends from there give
me heat about it!"
"Stanford offered a great community and sense
of belonging that I didn't feel a part of at my other
school," Schoemaker echoed. "Last quarter I had a
class that was two floors below ground and after
one of the classes the elevator was out of commis
sion and wasn't going to be running for a couple
hours. Since I'm in a wheelchair and need to use
the elevator, the students and TAs in my class car
ried me and my wheelchair up four flights of stairs
to get me outside."
So, was Stanford the right choice?
"I think it was the right choice for me because
Stanford offers me opportunities that UC-
Berkeley could not," Faraji said.
Munoz is also confident in her decision.
"Transferring to Stanford was definitely the
right choice for me. This school challenges me
intellectually as well as socially," Munoz said. "I
love being able to meet people from all parts of
the world and have meaningful and intellectual
conversations!"
