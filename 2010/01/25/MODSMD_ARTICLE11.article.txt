Senior boy to graduate student girl at Pub Night:
"So, you're technically not my RA anymore,
right?"
Senior girl at Pub Night: "This is Illusions??? It
looks like a run-down Chinese restaurant!"
Senior girl at Pub Night: "I may not have made it
to the calendar, but I'm a beagle model!"
Senior girl outside of Sigma Nu: "Why did he
have to catch me stuffing a block of cheese into
my shirt at Special Dinner?"
Senior girl outside of Wine and Cheese Night,
observing partially-full Colt 45 bottles sitting

against a tree: "Look! It's bottles of pee! I bet
you that's pee. I bet you five dollars!"
Girls in front of SAE:
Frosh girl 1: "Guys, we are at a high risk of sexu
al assault right now."
Other girls laugh. Promptly after the laughing
stops, the front door of SAE flies open and a
blowup doll is tossed out.
Alumni: "The Upsilons used to live here ... what
happened?"
Student: "I heard they were unhoused after
someone threw a burning couch off the balcony."
Alumni: "Well, that hardly seems like a fit pun
ishment!"
