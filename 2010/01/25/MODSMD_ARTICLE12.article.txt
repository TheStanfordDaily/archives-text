## Green Store recyclable cup sales increase Campus residences, ASSU event planners embrace green products 
### NICK MCINTYRE 
The ASSU Green Store is seeing growing sales
figures after a year in operation, as the group con
tinues its campus outreach efforts.
The nonprofit store opened near the end of fall
quarter 2008, with number-on-size plastic cups its
signature product. The store has since expanded its
line to offer a suite of green products, including
Ecos detergent and power-saving Smart Strips, with
new additions planned for the coming months.
Since its opening, the Green Store has sold a
total of 30,000 cups, two thirds of them in the 2009-
2010 academic year.
"We've been reaching out to a lot of the frats
and houses on the row and have been encouraging
bulk orders," wrote Green Store Director Susie
Choi 'l2 in an e-mail to The Daily.
Some campus residences find themselves natu
rally aligned with the Green Store's goals.
"Synergy decided to go with the Green Store's
cups because we as a house are committed to envi
ronmental sustainability," wrote Synergy
Community Manager Stacey Svetlichnaya 'll in an
e-mail to The Daily.
But Synergy isn't the only house going green.
Kappa Alpha has purchased 9,000 Green Store
cups to date and is the largest buyer on campus.

Choi cited discounts for bulk orders and direct
delivery to residences as factors that may appeal to
customers.
The ASSU has also put its weight behind use of
the Store's products.
"The Executive is using Green Store products at
all Executive hosted events when possible," wrote
ASSU Executive Co-Chair of Sustainability Leslie
Cachola 'll in an e-mail to The Daily.
However, sales numbers won't fully measure the
Green Store's success. The true test of the store's
effectiveness will be the number of its cups that are
diverted from landfills. Choi stressed that the Store
was making follow-up efforts with customers to
explain recycling procedures, which Svetlichnaya
confirmed were adequate.
Some students, however, reported that aware
ness and widespread use of the cups was still lack
ing.
"I thought it would really take off," wrote Jared
Kozal 'll, a resident of Robinson, in an e-mail to
The Daily. "While the Green Cups are often used at
University-sponsored events, I haven't really seen
them that often at private campus parties or events
in the dorm this year."
"Unless the ASSU enacts rules making it politi
cally unfeasible to host events without sustainable
supplies," added Kevin Baumgartner 'll in an e
mail to The Daily, "I don't think the Green Store is
going to do very much business unless they can
bring costs down."
