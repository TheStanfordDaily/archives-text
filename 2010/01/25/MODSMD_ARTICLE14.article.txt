### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
MTV had a situation on its
hands Thursday night as never
before-seen footage from the show
Jersey Shore forced the long-term
couple of Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and
Sammi "Sweetheart" Giancola to
end their relationship. At
Thursday's reunion show, host
Julissa Bermudez showed a clip
revealing a particularly intimate
conversation between Giancola
and Mike "The Situation"
Sorrentino.
"I don't like this guy drama,"
Giancola said while still in the
fledgling stages of her relationship
with Ortiz-Magro. "That's why I'm
single 'cause I don't want to deal
with it."
Giancola, who had an "emotion
al breakdown" before the clip was
even shown, was visibly uncomfort
able when confronted by
Bermudez. Ortiz-Magro was not
pleased by the development either.
"I cut girls quicker than barbers
do, to be honest with you" he said.
"You can go to the bathroom
and cry now," he suggested to
Giancola.
Ortiz-Magro continued on his
diatribe, which was even supported
by statements from The Situation.
As negotiations continued to dete
riorate, Ortiz-Magro and Giancola
promptly ended their relationship.
When asked by Bermudez to
comment on the break-up, Ortiz-
Magro responded, "I don't know.
I'm in L.A. tonight."
