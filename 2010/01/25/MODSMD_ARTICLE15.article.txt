## EDITORIAL Obama's handling of Haiti trumps Bush's Katrina response 
### 
In 2005, the United States experienced the
worst natural disaster in the country's his
tory. The devastation that Hurricane Katri
na unleashed on the city of New Orleans was
not unexpected. The storm developed six days
before its landfall on Aug. 29,2005. Over 1,800
people perished not only as a result of the hur
ricane and subsequent floods, but also from
thirst, exhaustion and violence that followed
the hurricane. The media flooded the Ameri
can public with images of the destruction and
the desperation of those victims still stranded
in the flooded city. Hurricane Katrina demon
strated to us that there is no way to prevent
natural disasters you can only prepare and
respond. Those responsible for responding to
Hurricane Katrina failed miserably.
The order to evacuate New Orleans was
given only 19 hours before the hurricane
struck, not allowing adequate time for resi
dents to leave. Flaws in the city's emergency
response plan were revealed when designated
shelters such as the Superdome overflowed
with residents. Although there were many lo
gistical and organizational failures that ampli
fied the storm's impact, the biggest criticism
was of the lack of leadership during the emer
gency response.
This month, a magnitude 7.0 hurricane
struck the poorest country in the western
hemisphere. To date, over 80,000 have been
confirmed dead in Haiti, and that number is
expected to exceed 100,000. The damage in
Haiti is definitely worse than what happened
in New Orleans and the response has, thus
far, been far superior. This difference is di
rectly a result of public leadership, and it is a
shining example of how the intangible quali
ties of leadership can be so important in
times of crisis.
The Haitian government was crippled by
the quake, with most of its ministries and even
the presidential palace in ruins. Haiti's govern
ment and infrastructure was in desperate need

of assistance, and the response by the United
States has been incredible. This is due in large
part to the Obama administration's leader
ship and ability to empathize with the people
of Haiti. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
was in Haiti the day following the quake. In an
impassioned speech, President Obama en
sured the people of Haiti that they would not
be forsaken. The United States has pledged
millions of dollars and supplies to Haiti.
In watching the government's remarkable
response to another country's disaster, it is
evident that this current administration has
learned much from the failures of its prede
cessors in emergency response. Former Pres
ident George W. Bush was on vacation while
New Orleans was devastated by Katrina, and
he was remarkably soft-spoken during the af
termath. Bush's failure to adequately re
spond to the disaster attracted heavy criti
cism, notably Kanye West's infamous accusa
tion that "George Bush doesn't like black
people." In contrast, President Obama and
his entire administration have shown a
steady and confident poise that has inspired
many Americans to give to Haiti, and has
hopefully comforted the people of Haiti in
this time of disaster.
While the United States' powerful image
as the world leader has dimmed around the
globe with this economic recession, the gov
ernment's response to this disaster has again
proven that the U.S. can be a shining example
to the rest of the world for its humanitarian
ism. While thousands of fans filled the Super
dome last night to celebrate the Saint's first
NFC Championship, we cannot lose sight of
our not-so-distant past, and the fact that the
very same Superdome once overflowed with
relocated residents of the city. Katrina taught
us a number of lessons about emergency re
sponse, and it is encouraging that our nation fi
nally has leaders in place who can manage dis
asters effectively.
