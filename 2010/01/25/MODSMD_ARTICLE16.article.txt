# GIRL, YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## The
						Worst Transitions 
### Jordan Carr 
There has been a lot of news lately about
how NBC botched its late night situa
tion, leading Conan O'Brien to write a
letter to "People of Earth" in which he bitter
ly noted, "It was my mistaken belief that, like
my predecessor, I would have the benefit of
some time and, just as important, some de
gree of ratings support from the prime-time
schedule."
Before leaving for good on Friday, Conan
put "The Tonight Show" up for sale on
Craigslist (barely used!), and spent the past
few weeks mocking NBC, gloating about
their losing hundreds of millions of dollars on
the Winter Olympics, and announcing that he
will refuse to move to a later time slot be
cause "I cannot participate in what I honest
ly believe is [The Tonight Show's] destruc
tion."

Amusingly enough, when Johnny Carson
retired from The Tonight Show in 1992 after
30 years, Jay Leno jumped over heir apparent
(and Carson's choice) David Letterman,
leading to a lot of broken friendships and
hard feelings. So, in 2004, Leno announced
his retirement from "The Tonight Show" ...
effective in 2009. He did this because "I don't
want to see anybody go through that again."
Fortunately, no friendships seem to be dam
aged as O'Brien probably still holds a grudge
from the time NBC Chief Mark Zucker got
him arrested over a prank during their col
lege days at Harvard, true story (no Pat
Robertson).
Nevertheless, there have been rockier
transitions over the course of history. Let's
come up with a few examples, shall we?

The French Revolution (1793-1794)
I'm not one to judge a book by its cover,
but this period was called by its support
ers "the reign of terror." Imagine if
Barack Obama got up and said, "Listen, we
need to start rounding up and killing dissi
dents. This is only going to last a few years,
but after that the reign of terror will be over
and everything will be fine." It would be like
if he actually advocated the secret death pan
els in the health care bill designed to "retire"
your grandparents. Maximilien Robespierre
said as much: "Terror is nothing else than
swift, severe, indomitable justice; it flows,
then, from virtue." No wonder the French
were pumped to have Napoleon lead them
he at least knew well enough to limit the
indiscriminate killing to foreigners.

Kanye West (2005 —)
First, there was that time at a Katrina
telethon where Mike Myers said something
about how New Orleans needs your support,

to which Mr. West responded, "George Bush
doesn't care about black people." Myers then
literally did a double take and the camera cut
to a shocked Chris Tucker. Then there was
that time at the MTV Music Video Awards
when we learned that Kanye West is the only
person in the world who cares about the
MTV Music Video Awards. He mic-jacked
Taylor Swift, who was accepting her award
for Best Female Video and famously said,
"Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma
let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the
best videos of all time! One of the best videos
of all time!" Is there any way to follow this
guy on TV with anything other than stunned
silence?

Star Wars: Episode 1 (1999)
How do you feel about Qui-Gon Jinn?
Can you name one of his character traits?
Long hair doesn't count. For those of you
who don't remember the movie that well, it is
basically like intergalactic C-SPAN the
plot centers around an embargo around
Naboo (that's a planet), imposed on the
oddly anti-trade Trade Federation. There are
all kinds of scenes that take place in some
sort of overcrowded interplanetary senate
where aliens and people fly around on space
teacups debating trade policy. That the only
character from this movie whose personality
anyone can describe is Jar Jar Binks is not a
good sign.

William Henry Harrison (1841)
Remember how Barack Obama had a big
fancy transition team designed to make sure
his administration was ready to operate on
day one? I don't think William Henry Harri
son had one of those. Harrison was being in
augurated as our ninth President, and despite
it being a wet and rainy day, he decided to de
liver a two-hour-long speech while insisting
on wearing only a pair of boxer shorts while
sitting on an ice throne and drinking an Icee
really quickly. Stunningly, he caught pneu
monia and, despite all the best opium and
leech-based treatments, died a month later.
Though, in all fairness to Old Tippecanoe, it
was an awesome speech and totally worth it.

In entirely unrelated news, this volume of
The Daily is over at the end of the month and
some changes will be made, including editor
in chief and the editor who puts up ridiculous
tags. Again, that is entirely unrelated to this
column.
