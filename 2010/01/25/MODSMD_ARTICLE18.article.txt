# THE 						DUDE ABIDES
## 3,000 Years of Beautiful History . . . 
### Zack Warma 
A recurrent debate in my life has been
whether I should apply to become a
tour guide. On one hand, I have
worked in an office providing directions all
over campus, and given my sick historical
fix/good sense of geography, I have a decent
conception of this place. However, there is no
amount of money that could keep me on
script when trying to describe Stanford to
starry-eyed high school kids or Far East
tourists. For you Stanford partisans, however,
I would like to invite you on the trademarked
Zachary Warma's Hidden History Stanford
Tour (TM).
We begin not at MemAud, but rather the
corner of Salvatierra and Santa Ynez. In one
of the several beautiful pockets of the un
known Faculty Ghetto (which, excluding
the Row Houses/Cowell, is the area bound
by Stanford Ave., Bowdoin St., Junipero
Serra and Campus Drive East), there stand
several identical homes. Unique in design
and size since the early 20th century, when
both Salvatierra and Mayfield formed the
Greek Rows, these houses have stood as
vestiges of an architecturally stunning,
Greekier past.
Walk along Santa Ynez to the corner of
Mayfield Avenue. You will see facing Phi Psi
a small plaque honoring the location of the
former Stanford Elementary School, which
closed its doors mid-century. Chuckle quietly
when thinking about students doing the walk
of shame Friday morning past chirpy third
graders.
Sauntering down Mayfield toward White
Plaza, pause at the corner of Mayfield and
Mayfield (you know it makes sense), and
glance first at Sigma Nu (located at 557 May
field since 2003) and then Sigma Chi (at 550
Mayfield since 1936). Though currently
viewed as having dissimilar dispositions, both
chapters experienced major turmoil in the
early 19605, when each frat had the chutzpah
to defy the racist policies of their national or
ganizations and pledge African-American
students.
Continuing on Mayfield, passing Florence
Moore Hall (a former all-female dorm, a sad
fact to mull on considering the lack of readi
ly available water fountains), you ultimately
run into what we now refer to as our glorified

pond: Lake Lagunita. Old photos portray a
stunningly pastoral scene of sailboats and
rowers in a lake filled continuously through
the late 1980s to the early 19905. However,
Lake Lag holds a dark history, including a 20-
year-old Greek party-goer drowning in the
Lake in 1986, helping to spark the modern al
cohol policy we now live with.
Quickly move from Lomita to Lagunita to
arrive at Tresidder Union, named after the
former long-serving President Donald
Tresidder (see contact line for President Triv
ia Game!). Enter the Treehouse, operated by
the chieftain of non-Stanford Dining eater
ies, Ray Klein. Now, picture this spot... 25
years ago. And picture a bowling alley. Seri
ously. This is not a joke.
Swing around the side of Tresidder, and
walk past the Axe and Palm. Immediately
after passing the Native American Communi
ty Center (a recent historical addition to cam
pus after concerted student activism over
many years), ascend the stairwell to your left.
This brings you to the patio of the now-A3C

Clubhouse, formerly the Women's Clubhouse
and a witness to the turmoil of the late 1960s
anti-Vietnam protests. This is arguably my fa
vorite spot on campus. Amazing view, great
location for cigars, and potential setting of my
finals week water balloon sneak attack.
Now, we have a bit of a walk. Walking
down Lasuen, we make a right after Green
Library, which, by the way, houses our Special
Collections on the second floor. Coolest.
Place. Ever. (In the name of full disclosure I
am now working there. But I stand behind
this statement.) After passing between Enci
na (the original male dorm) and Crothers
(named after Stanford grad/Jane Stanford's
confidante) and cutting left around Toyon,
you arrive at Vidalakis.Not a Viking encamp
ment, Vidalakis is the award-winning dining
hall for the Schwab Residential Complex
(the traditional GSB dorm). I am taking you
to a grad dining hall because the outside
courtyard is decorated with remnants of old
columns that toppled during the 1906 Earth
quake, Pretty frickin' awesome.
Get on Serra, swing a left, pass Hoover
Tower (Hi Condi!) and MemAud (MLK Jr.
gave speech here!), and proceed onto the
steps of the Quad. Walk directly to the door
way of Memorial Church, but do not enter.
Proceed quickly to the left, and look down.
You will find an old plaque, placed there on
the May 14, 1887. It was here that a grief
stricken mother, coupled with her powerful
husband's ill-gotten assets, erected the cor
nerstone for the University that 123 years
later, we now call home.
My mother went to UCSD, my father
Western Illinois. I saw Stanford for the first
time four and a half years ago. But this is my
history just as anyone else's, and we share this
with those who have come before us. Too in
frequently do we realize that this collective
past, however disassociated from our person
al lives, still powerfully impacts this strange
and wonderful place.

Zack offers a spot at Bagel Day to the first per
son who can name the six locations on campus
(besides Tresidder) named after Stanford's
(mostly deceased) presidents. Send in the win
ning response to Zack at zwarma@stanford.

This is my history
just as anyone else's,
and we share this with
those who have come
before us.
