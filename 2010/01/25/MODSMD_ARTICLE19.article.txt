## CARD SOARS PAST DUCKS Ogwumike marks 30 in 100-80 win over Oregon 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
After a string of respectable, though less
than-overwhelming wins, the nation's No. 2
team seems to have found its swagger. The
Cardinal offense came to life against Oregon
on Saturday, beating a talented Ducks team
100-80 with five players posting double-digit
point totals.
Sophomore forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike had a career game, scoring 30 points
and pulling down a school-record 23 re
bounds. The Cypress, Tex. native is currently
the conference's top scorer with 19.5 points
per game and an incredible 64.2 shooting
percentage and is also the Pacific-10 Confer
ence's second-best rebounder with 10.7 per
game,
"She's so fluid," said Oregon coach Paul
Westhead. "We would locate her, but it did
n't last long. Her ability as a rebounder is
devastating. She gets everything."
The Ducks (12-7, 3-4 Pac-10) boast the
nation's top-scoring offense, averaging 85.9
points per contest and wouldn't go down
without a fight. Just three minutes into the
game, Oregon had jumped ahead of Stan
ford (17-1,7-1 Pac-10) by a score of 11-7. Og
wumike soon took initiative, however, ac
counting for 11 points on a 22-7 Stanford run
that put the Cardinal back on top, 29-18,
midway through the half.The Ducks soon re
sponded, led by their eventual point-leader
Nia Jackson. Oregon's redshirt sophomore
guard pulled her team within one, thanks to
a pair of free throws, making it 39-38. After
another Stanford outburst, she scored the
final points of a 9-0 run that tied the game at
49 with just over a minute left in the half.
Jackson finished the game with a career-high
26 points, including 18 in the first half.
Before heading to the locker-room, fresh
man Joslyn Tinkle helped put the Cardinal
back on top with a three-pointer that made it
54-50 and continued Stanford's season-long
streak of leading its opponents at halftime.
Stanford Head Coach Tara VanDerveer,
however, was displeased with some aspects
of her team's performance in the first half,
including its 11 turnovers.
"I don't think we handled the ball as well
as we needed to in the first half, obviously,"
VanDerveer said. "But our guards are step
ping up and that's what we need them to do
to: open things up for Jayne and Nneka and
people inside."
Ogwumike again set the tone for the sec
ond half, scoring the first four points of the
frame to double the Cardinal's lead. The
Ducks would come as close as 80-75 on a
Jackson layup with 8 minutes, 36 seconds to
play, but Stanford finished the game on a 20-
5 run to put Oregon away.
"The game felt close the whole time and I
like that feeling," Ogwumike said. "It's get
ting us ready for the future and I think this is
a very good team to play. I'm so glad that

they're in our conference."
The 100-80 score marked the first time
the Cardinal reached a triple-digit point
total since nearly two months ago on Nov. 29,
when they beat Gonzaga 105-74. While Og
wumike accounted for 30 of those points, she
wasn't alone in helping the Cardinal put up
their biggest offensive performance of the
conference season. Four other players had
double-digit point totals, including senior
center Jayne Appel (17) and guards junior

Jeanette Pohlen (15), redshirt senior Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude (11) and redshirt junior
JJ Hones (10).
Appel's performance in particular is
worth noting, as the reigning Pac-10 Player
of the Year while certainly making signif
icant contributions for the Cardinal offense
hasn't quite lived up to her stellar stan
dards of late. Her end-game total of 17 points
was her highest since Dec. 30, when she put
up 20 points against Fresno State.
Stanford shot 50 percent on the game, its
most accurate performance of the confer
ence season. That mark came despite a sea
son-high 35 three-point attempts, only 13 of
which were successful.
With its two wins in Oregon, the Cardinal
remains all alone at the top of the Pac-10
standings. The only loss by the second-place
team, USC, came at the hands of Stanford.
The Cardinal will head home for their
next contest, facing Arizona State at Maples
Pavilion this Thursday at 7 p.m.

close the whole
time and I like
that feeling."
