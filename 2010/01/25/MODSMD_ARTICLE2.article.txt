# Prof. Segura testifies in Prop. 8 trial
## In S.F., federal court hears arguments for legality of California ban on same-sex marriage 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
The question of same-sex marriage has
entered the federal courtroom, and LGBT
activists and marriage protection advocates
alike have prepared their factual ammunition
for the battle ahead. Caught in the controver
sy's whirlwind, political science Prof. Gary
Segura testified for a total of nine hours
Wednesday and Thursday as an expert wit
ness on political representation.
Both sides of the marriage debate will

have the chance to present their evidence in
the federal trial Kristin M. Perry v. Arnold
Schwarzenegger , which began Jan. 11 and is
expected to end this week. Plaintiffs are chal
lenging the constitutional validity of the
California ballot measure Proposition 8,
which passed by a 52 percent margin in
November 2008, banning same-sex marriage
in the state.
The trial is the first to bring same-sex mar
riage to federal courts, and plaintiffs hope to
use Segura's testimony to invoke the federal
equal protection clause in favor of marriage

equality.
The Rational Basis Test
According to law school Prof. Jane
Schacter, this trial is particularly significant
because it questions whether the gay and les
bian community is "a suspect class." If the gay
and lesbian community is declared a suspect
class, the courts may apply a more stringent
test to the validity of the ban.
States are allowed to disadvantage a group
as long as there is a "rational basis," and Prop.
8 was originally justified by this test.

Once a group is declared a suspect class,
however, the courts must apply a higher level
of scrutiny and prove that states have a right
to apply the law due to compelling state inter
est. Plaintiffs hope to increase the level of
scrutiny in order to throw out Prop. 8.
According to Schacter, in order to be
declared a suspect class, the gay and lesbian
community must prove three conditions: a
history of discrimination, a lack of sufficient
political power through the normal political
process, and a victimization due to irrelevant
traits.

"A fourth condition may be applied, too:
immutability," she added. "In colloquial terms,
do people have a choice of being gay, or are
they born gay?"
Historically, racial discrimination has been
a subject of strict scrutiny, while gender has
fallen into the category of intermediate scruti
ny.
Segura's evidence is intended to support
the second condition, which law emeritus
Prof Michael Wald said had evidence in its
favor.
"I do think that gays and lesbians
are politically vulnerable," Wald said.
"Just because voters pass something
doesn't mean it's constitutional."
Schacter acknowledged that there
are compelling arguments on both
sides. While California extends
domestic partnership rights and has
no ban on sodomy, the gay and les
bian community has also been sub
jected to discriminatory ballot initia
tives.

'Scare Tactics'
In addition to reviewing the con
cept of scrutiny, the courts are also
trying to determine if the marriage
protection advocates are driven by
animosity.
"The Court wants to say that if the
animosity is the only factor backing
Prop. 8, then the judge would strike it
down," Schacter said. "[Judge
Vaughn Walker] would invalidate it if
that's the only thing backing it.
"Judge Walker is conducting a
full-blown trial with lots of witnesses
and cross-examinations," she added.
"The trials before were based on dry
legal arguments conducted on briefs.
[Walker] is really looking at the fac
tual basis behind Prop 8."
Sarah Masimore 'll commented
that the case will force same-sex mar
riage opponents to give factual sup
port to their arguments. "I think it's
really great that it's in the court sys
tem right now because [Prop. 8 sup
porters] can't use scare tactics any
more," she said. "They have to give
actual evidence of what they said
during the campaign."

Segura on the Stand
Segura said he initially declined to
participate because of the time com
mitment but, after thinking about it
further, decided it would be a worthy
undertaking.
"It seemed like an important
thing to be associated with," he said.
"When they called the second time, I
just said, 'Alright.'"
Segura's argument for the politi
cal vulnerability of the lesbian and
gay community rests on his claim of
the group's subjection to widespread
public disapproval and condemna
tion. "Gays and lesbians are more
likely than any other American to be
targeted with rape and murder and
hate crimes." he said.
Through his research, Segura
found that gays and lesbians do not
have basic employment discrimina
tion prevention rights in 29 states, are
underrepresented in public office
and are targeted by more political
initiatives than any other group.
According to Segura, the gay and
lesbian community has lost 70 per
cent of the time on issues not con
cerning marriage, and 100 percent on
issues concerning marriage,
"Now, three-fifths of the states
have constitutionally established a
group of people as not fully equal,"
Segura said. "It's wrong to view all of
these things and conclude that a
group is still sufficient to protect their
basic rights through the normal polit
ical process."
Segura, whose academic back
ground is in minority rights, said his
role in the trial was professional. "I
was not testifying as an advocate," he
said. "I am a social scientist. My work
is a fair assessment of the strategic
political circumstances of gays and
lesbians.
"I'm part of the trial to provide

expertise to the court but there are
competing experts," he added. "My
views are not consistent with the per
son that the defendants are bring
ing."
The defendants will bring in
Claremont McKenna government
Prof. Kenneth Miller to testify more
about political power, speaking in
opposition to Segura's arguments.

End of the Road?
Schacter and Segura both agreed
that the San Francisco case will not
be the end of the road. According to
both, whoever loses the decision will
probably appeal to the Ninth Circuit.
From there, the Supreme Court may
decide to hear the case.
"The bringing of this case was so
controversial," Schacter said. "Some
gay rights groups didn't think it was
the right time since there may be a
five-member majority [of conserva
tive values] in the Supreme Court."
According to Schacter, Supreme
Court Justice Anthony Kennedy '5B
would be the swing vote if the deci
sion made it to his court. Kennedy
ruled on behalf of striking down the
ban on consensual sodomy in the
2003 case Lawrence v. Texas, but
Schacter said it was unclear whether
he would go so far as to support
same-sex marriage.
"You read between the lines and
you can see that he made the distinc
tion clear that he wasn't deciding
anything about the marriage issue,"
she said. "At the level of legal argu
ment, you can use the sodomy deci
sion to support marriage equality, but
whether [Kennedy's] willing to do
that is a separate question."
Schacter also said that if Prop. 8 is
upheld, the Supreme Court may not
review the case a possibility with
complex implications for the political
struggle over gay marriage.
"It won't really change the status
quo," she said. "It will not threaten
the many anti-marriage equality
measures that are already placed
around the country, so the Supreme
Court might just wait before review
ing it."
Schacter made the comparison
between the previous ban on interra
cial marriage and the current ban on
gay and lesbian marriages.
"It took almost 20 years before
the ban on interracial marriage was
struck down," she said. "The gay
rights battle began in 1993, approxi
mately.
"There are astonishing parallels,"
she added. "Marriage has been a
changing, evolving institution. At the
time that there were bans on interra
cial marriage, there was tremendous
public support for banning it since it
violated religious barriers."
According to Schacter, there was
probably 90 percent disapproval for
interracial marriage around the
country before the Supreme Court
finally overturned the ban.
"If voters voted that there cannot
be interracial couples, then that
wouldn't be constitutional," Wald
added. "It's a restriction of choice to
marry. Whether you restrict a choice
on race or gender or other factors,
that is generally unconstitutional in
terms of policy."
Schacter added that strict scrutiny
was applied to the 1967 case of
Loving v. Virginia, which struck down
the ban on interracial marriage.
"The heart of this case is whether
this issue is comparable to Loving v.
Virginia she said. "Whether it will
carry over to the same-sex controver
sy is not settled. It may be an uphill
battle for gay rights activists."
