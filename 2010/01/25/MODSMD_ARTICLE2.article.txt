# Prof. Segura testifies in Prop. 8 trial
## In S.F., federal court hears arguments for legality of California ban on same-sex marriage 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
The question of same-sex marriage has
entered the federal courtroom, and LGBT
activists and marriage protection advocates
alike have prepared their factual ammunition
for the battle ahead. Caught in the controver
sy's whirlwind, political science Prof. Gary
Segura testified for a total of nine hours
Wednesday and Thursday as an expert wit
ness on political representation.
Both sides of the marriage debate will

have the chance to present their evidence in
the federal trial Kristin M. Perry v. Arnold
Schwarzenegger , which began Jan. 11 and is
expected to end this week. Plaintiffs are chal
lenging the constitutional validity of the
California ballot measure Proposition 8,
which passed by a 52 percent margin in
November 2008, banning same-sex marriage
in the state.
The trial is the first to bring same-sex mar
riage to federal courts, and plaintiffs hope to
use Segura's testimony to invoke the federal
equal protection clause in favor of marriage

equality.
The Rational Basis Test
According to law school Prof. Jane
Schacter, this trial is particularly significant
because it questions whether the gay and les
bian community is "a suspect class." If the gay
and lesbian community is declared a suspect
class, the courts may apply a more stringent
test to the validity of the ban.
States are allowed to disadvantage a group
as long as there is a "rational basis," and Prop.
8 was originally justified by this test.

Once a group is declared a suspect class,
however, the courts must apply a higher level
of scrutiny and prove that states have a right
to apply the law due to compelling state inter
est. Plaintiffs hope to increase the level of
scrutiny in order to throw out Prop. 8.
According to Schacter, in order to be
declared a suspect class, the gay and lesbian
community must prove three conditions: a
history of discrimination, a lack of sufficient
political power through the normal political
process, and a victimization due to irrelevant
traits.

"A fourth condition may be applied, too:
immutability," she added. "In colloquial terms,
do people have a choice of being gay, or are
they born gay?"
Historically, racial discrimination has been
a subject of strict scrutiny, while gender has
fallen into the category of intermediate scruti
ny.
Segura's evidence is intended to support
the second condition, which law emeritus
Prof Michael Wald said had evidence in its
