# Favre's fairytale cut short in time for the Super Bowl
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
You can breathe now, football
fans. Brett Favre isn't going to
the Super Bowl.
We can all imagine the endless stories
about how number four came out of
retirement, took the Vikings on his
back and led them to the Super Bowl
that would have come about had the
Vikings won. They would be all over
the newspapers and the Internet and
we would all undoubtedly be sen
tenced to endless Rachel Nichols re
ports about him "Live from Miami."
Since the Vikings aren't going to the
Super Bowl, I promise (really) that
this won't be one of those reports.
How about that NFC Champi
onship Game though? It started as a
track meet and ended as an episode
of "The Three Stooges" starring He-
Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named, Brad "I
have less control of my team than the
puppets A1 Davis employs" Childress
and the referees.
Childress opened the show by
meekly trying to weenie his team
down the field with two minutes left
in regulation, only to call a timeout
and then send 12 men to the huddle,
pushing the Vikings out of field goal
range. As far as crushingly moronic
coaching moves go, that is right there
near the top. (Probably second, be
hind the fake field goal Jim Zorn
called for the Redskins on Monday
Night Football against the Giants this
year).

Childress' blunder did have its
benefits, as 95 percent of America (in
cluding every single Green Bay Pack
ers fan) learned only a play later, as it
set up the artist formerly known as
Brett Favre (oops) to throw the game
away ... literally.
That guy whose name rhymes
with Schmett Schmarve always
seems to find away to make a care
less, stupid play, despite the fact that
he has been in the NFL seemingly
since the Stone Age and holds most
every quarterback record. One of
those records is for most intercep
tions and right on queue Big Arm
Brett made a bonehead throw across
his body and it was picked off, send
ing the game to overtime while most
of the country rejoiced.
The closing act of the circus was
the referees, who I won't harp on too
much, but will say that they made a
few interesting calls holding and
pass interference, as well as a ques
tionable catch that set the Saints
up for the game-winning field goal.
The worst part about it all, though,
was the three booth reviews in over
time, which drastically slowed down
what had been a smooth, exciting
game. Yes, you want the correct calls
at crucial times, but Pete Morelli did
not seem at all interested in overturn
ing anything he saw and thus the
game just continued at glacial speed.
All that said, on to the Super Bowl.
If you like offense and really,

who doesn't like offense? this will
be a game for you. It pits probably the
two best quarterbacks and the two
most explosive offenses in the league
against one another.
Peyton Manning, who may, when
all is said and done, go down as the
greatest quarterback to ever lace up
the boots, may have had his most im
pressive season yet this year.
Gone was Marvin Harrison and
injured was Anthony Gonzalez. The
Colts' running game was nowhere to
be found most of the year. Yet Man
ning turned two no-names, Pierre
Garcon and Austin Collie, into stars
en route to winning his fourth MVP
award.
Both quarterbacks, Manning and
the Saints' Drew Brees, are likely to
throw the 30 or more times in the
Super Bowl and I would not be
shocked if the last team with the ball
wins.
There are a few small factors that
may help decide the game.
One is whether the Saints commit
to trying to run the ball. The Colts
have a very undersized defense and
New Orleans can throw three run
ning backs Pierre Thomas, Mike
Bell and Reggie Bush â€”at Indi
anapolis. If the Saints try to muscle
up, they may be able to control the
clock and open up the field for Brees
