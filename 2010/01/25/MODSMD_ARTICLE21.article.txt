# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## PROMISE IN PROVO No. 3 Stanford recovers to split matches at Brigham Young 
### CHRISTOPHER JUHNKE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team showed their
resiliency and toughness this weekend in Provo
against BYU.
The No. 3 Cardinal (3-1, 3-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) rebounded from a tough 21-30,34-
32, 30-25, 32-30 loss on Friday against the No. 5
Cougars (5-2 overall, 3-1 MPSF) to take the second
match of the two-match series, 20-30,35-33,30-28,30-
27, on Saturday night.
On Friday night, the Cardinal jumped out to an
early one-set lead before dropping three straight sets
in front of a hostile crowd of 4,409 BYU fans. The Car
dinal was led by senior opposite Evan Romero's sea
son-high 23 kills and senior setter Kawika Shoji's 63
assists, eight digs and four kills. However, the team
couldn't overcome a costly 23 service errors.
In the first set, Stanford used its defense and pass
ing to control the tempo, establishing an 18-14 lead
after some back and forth play to start the set. Coming
out of a BYU timeout, the Cougars recorded three
kills, but it wouldn't be enough as the Cardinal re
sponded and took the first set in commanding fashion,
30-22.
The second set started out much like the first
with neither team able to gain a clear advantage over
the other until BYU recorded two blocks to give it
a three-point lead, 17-14. Stanford fought back, how

ever and the Cardinal was up 27-26 late in the set be
fore two serving errors and a hitting error lost the set
for the Card.
"Our streaky serving and sometimes inconsistent
attacking put us in holes that we shouldn't have been
in," said sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson. "We
would be leading a game by three or four near the end,
but we would often commit unforced hitting and serv
ice errors that let BYU back in the game."
BYU carried its momentum from the close second
set win over to the third set, where the Cougars start
ed out with an early 5-1 run, culminating in a 14-7 lead.
Service mistakes by Stanford prevented any chance of
a comeback and BYU maintained its lead to take the
third set.
The Cardinal, down two sets to one, rebounded in
the fourth set to take an early lead, but was unable to
hold on down the stretch. BYU tied the match at 27
before two Romero kills helped shut down the
Cougars momentum. Unfortunately, Stanford could
n't hang on, dropping the final three points of the set
to lose the match three sets to one.
"This match showed us how close this league real
ly is," Lawson said. "We've talked about it before, but
having so many games decided by such small margins
this weekend gave us a glimpse of how hard we are
going to have to work to get wins in this league."
On Saturday night, Stanford turned the tables on
the Cougars, coming up with a big four-set victory, 20-
30, 35-33, 30-28, 30-27, again in front of a raucous
crowd. Lawson and sophomore middle blocker Gus
Ellis led the way for the Cardinal with 22 kills and 12
kills with nine blocks, respectively.
After dropping the first set 20-30 and being held to
a .077 attack percentage, the Cardinal responded by
opening a lead in the second and
preserving it until late in the set.
However, BYU made a comeback
with a 7-1 run, giving them set point
at 29-27. The Cardinal didn't give up
though and fought off four set
points from the Cougars before win
ning the set, 35-33.
Neither team could jump out to a
big lead to start the third set and
there were several tie scores before
Stanford opened up a small, 18-15
lead. BYU tied it up again at 25 all,
but Stanford managed to claim the
set on an Ellis kill, 30-28.
In the fourth set, the Cardinal
used its momentum to jump out to
an early advantage. The Cougars
countered to take the lead back 19-
16, but Stanford went on a 7-1 run,
including four points served by
freshman reserve Myles Muagutu
tia. The Card never looked back
and clinched the set and the match,
30-27.
"It was extremely important,"
Lawson said of getting the win on
Saturday. "In a one-point league,
where teams are separated by such
a small margin, to bounce back and
overcome a first night defeat was a
great accomplishment, especially
in front of such a large, hostile
crowd."
The Cardinal ended its weekend
on a high note and looks to carry the
momentum from the win into next
weekend, where the team will face
No. 11 UC-Santa Barbara Thursday
night at home in Burnham Pavilion.
