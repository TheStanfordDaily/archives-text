# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Religious groups remember MLK, Jr. 
### JOSEPH LEVENSON 
The Stanford student group Faiths Acting in
Togetherness and Hope (FAITH), along with the
Office for Religious Life, hosted the annual Multi-
Faith Celebration on Sunday in honor of the work
and life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
The service, held in Memorial Church, acknowl
edged the importance of engaging religious diversi
ty in the Stanford community, and included a
Buddhist chant, a reading from the Quran, a bibli

cal prayer and performances by Talisman and the
Memorial Church Choir.
"I think that as Muslims we get few opportuni
ties to share our faith with other people, and it is
nice to have this ability to collaborate around the
universal teachings of King," said graduate student
in civil and environmental engineering Teizeen
Mohamedali.
The service included a speech by FAITH
President Anand Venkatkrishnan 'lO, who spoke
about King's sense of religious diversity and the

heavy influence on his thought from leaders like
Mahatma Gandhi.
Venkatkrishnan also discussed the perception of
religious groups, which is often one of violence and
incomprehensibility. He disagreed with the com
mon religious group mentality of "only my group
dominates; others suffocate,"
He saw religious identity as the extent to which
one can sympathize with a sufferer separated by a
border like religion. "There comes a
time when silence is betrayal,"
Venkatkrishnan said. "We, the rela
tively conscious, must insist on creat
ing conscience for others."
Later in the service. Rabbi Patricia
Karlin-Neumann, the administrative
dean for the Office of Religious Life,
led the audience in reciting a piece of
litany that centered on the idea that
everyone is tied together in a "single
garment of destiny." The silk screen of
leaves and blossoms that adorned the
podium in the center of the stage was
the physical representation of this
destiny, a garment made just for the
service.
Stanford a cappella group
Talisman ended the service with a
rendition of "Lift Every Voice and
Sing," the Black National Anthem of
the United States.
"We engage constantly with this
song despite our race, we can all
relate to the oppression in this coun
try," announced a Talisman member
before their performance.
Attendee Jessica Galant TO hoped
the different religious groups could
come together by recognizing shared
objectives. "The main purpose was to
awaken people to the common goal
of social justice that lies at the root of
every religion, by remembering a
great leader who really defined what
it means to stand for what you believe
in," she said.
Venkatkrishnan said he was over
whelmed with the audience's
response. "I never expected that so
many people would come whether
from the outside community or the
student population," he said. "Based
on the response that I received from
professors, religious leaders and stu
dents who came up to me after the
event and at the talk-back, I consider
the event a great success.
"I think there's going to be a lot of
new energy generated in many differ
ent communities around the topic of
engaging religious diversity on cam
pus," he added.
