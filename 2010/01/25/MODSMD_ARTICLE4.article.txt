San Mateo County transit

and attended Brigham Young
University, had a history of mental
illness, according to the San Jose

ing at East Meadow Drive, the fifth
death at the same intersection

last year.
A guard was on duty at the time
of death but did not see anything,
according to Christine Dunn, the
spokeswoman for Caltrain.
