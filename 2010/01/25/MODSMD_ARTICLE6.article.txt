## Fields and Green help Card hold Oregon at bay 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Landry Fields and Jeremy Green put on a scoring
clinic, the Cardinal big men shut down one of the
conference's best post players and Stanford rolled to
an 84-69 victory over Oregon (10-9, 2-5 Pacific-10
Conference) on Saturday to wrap up an impressive
and dominant home stand.
Fields had a career-high 32 points and Jeremy
Green tallied 25 of his own on eight for 12 shooting,
including three of four from behind the arc. Fields
also led the Cardinal (10-9, 4-3 Pac-10) in nearly
every statistical category he added eight rebounds,
five assists, three blocks and two steals.
"He's just a great player," said head coach Johnny

Dawkins. "He's broken some barriers and it's only
helping."
The Cardinal was in control for much of the game,
as Stanford jumped out to a 10-point lead midway
through the first half. A running jumper by Fields
with three seconds to go before halftime gave the
Cardinal a 39-30 advantage heading into the locker
room.
The early going was characterized by physical play
from both teams. Each had success on the offensive
boards and, subsequently, plenty of second-chance
opportunities. Stanford, though, was able to capitalize
on those chances, to the tune of 11 points, while
Oregon was left wanting they tallied just five

Senior Landry Fields scored 32 of the Cardinal's 84 in a win against Oregon on Saturday. The forward was one
of three Stanford players in double digits, helping to improve the Card's record to 9-2 at home.
points. This was in large part because
Stanford was able to couple its ag
gressiveness with finesse, while the
Ducks were unable to maintain
much control. This was particularly
evident in the play of their sopho
more center, Michael Dunigan, gen
erally considered one of the Pac
10's budding stars. He was held to
just two points both came on
free throws and tallied no re
bounds, as he flung his body around
the post against smaller defenders,
but could not register any results.
His directionless play earned him
frequent trips to the bench.
The absence of one of their top
producers put the Ducks at a seri
ous disadvantage, particularly be
cause Stanford's stars were practi
cally uncontainable. But that was
not the sole reason for the Cardi
nal's success in its second game
as a shorthanded team dealing with
chronic injuries, Stanford was able
to utilize the entirety of their rota
tion effectively.
Sophomore Matei Daian, for in
stance, had six points, four of which
came off of put-backs on missed
shots. Classmate sophomore Jack
Trotter, the Cardinal's main post
scoring threat, displayed other parts
of his game, bringing down key re
bounds and dishing out four assists
with zero turnovers. Both Daian
and Trotter were effective in elimi
nating Dunigan and Oregon's
frontcourt presence for much of the
game.
"Matei gave us a big lift off the
bench again," Dawkins said, "and
Jack Trotter handled the ball well
against their pressure,"
But it wasn't just the big men ei
ther. After sophomore point guard
Jarrett Mann got into early foul
trouble, Dawkins turned the of
fense over to redshirt junior
Da'Veed Dildy, who kept the attack
churning. Thrown in with extensive
minutes from senior Drew Shiller,
who added 10 points and effective
defense against Oregon's senior
Tajuan Porter and the guards were
able to demonstrate their depth.
With the entire machine rolling,
the Cardinal was able to expand on
its lead in the second half. Stanford
raced out to a 20-point advantage in

just over six minutes and got its lead
to as high as 23 points.
"I thought we had a good start
coming out of halftime and gained
some momentum," Dawkins said.
"We were able to play consistently
from then on."
"The second half is the time to
close the game," Green said.
The contest appeared to be over,
but Oregon had other plans. Porter,
who had been shut down for about
36 minutes, exploded at the end,
nailing three-pointer after three
pointer to bring the Ducks to with
in 13 points. He went from just four
points with 3 minutes, 30 seconds
remaining to 16 at the game's con
clusion.
"Porter can score as fast as any
young man I've ever seen,"
Dawkins said. "With him as a
weapon they are capable of beating
anybody."
But Porter's outburst was too lit
tle, too late. The Ducks fouled con
stantly in an effort to exploit an old
Stanford weakness free throws
but the Cardinal was consistent
from the stripe. The team drained
76.3 percent of its shots from the
line.
Stanford now sits in second place
in the topsy-turvy Pac-10, with six of
its next eight games on the road. Al
though the Cardinal has been effec
tive in defending its home court, it
has yet to find much success outside
of Maples. But in the previous two
games, it has dominated two confer
ence opponents, both of whom were
picked to finish ahead of the Cardi
nal this year.
It's a hard team to project, but
Stanford's resiliency is, at this point,
tangible.
