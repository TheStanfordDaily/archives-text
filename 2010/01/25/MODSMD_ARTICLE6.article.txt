## Fields and Green help Card hold Oregon at bay 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Landry Fields and Jeremy Green put on a scoring
clinic, the Cardinal big men shut down one of the
conference's best post players and Stanford rolled to
an 84-69 victory over Oregon (10-9, 2-5 Pacific-10
Conference) on Saturday to wrap up an impressive
and dominant home stand.
Fields had a career-high 32 points and Jeremy
Green tallied 25 of his own on eight for 12 shooting,
including three of four from behind the arc. Fields
also led the Cardinal (10-9, 4-3 Pac-10) in nearly
every statistical category he added eight rebounds,
five assists, three blocks and two steals.
"He's just a great player," said head coach Johnny

Dawkins. "He's broken some barriers and it's only
helping."
The Cardinal was in control for much of the game,
as Stanford jumped out to a 10-point lead midway
through the first half. A running jumper by Fields
with three seconds to go before halftime gave the
Cardinal a 39-30 advantage heading into the locker
room.
The early going was characterized by physical play
from both teams. Each had success on the offensive
boards and, subsequently, plenty of second-chance
opportunities. Stanford, though, was able to capitalize
on those chances, to the tune of 11 points, while
Oregon was left wanting they tallied just five
