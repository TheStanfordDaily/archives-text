## Faculty burdened with housekeeping New study says professors trade off teaching for chores

That is a choice that history Prof.
Londa Schiebinger, director of the
Michelle R. dayman Institute for
Gender Research at Stanford, hopes
that women will no longer have to
make.
Based a survey at elite universities
across the country, Schiebinger found
that while female professors work the
same long hours as male professors,
they still end up taking on a far
greater burden of house
work. Up to ten hours per / T(n)< c
week slip away down the W T(V =
drain or get melted over the ( assume

believes, that could be better spent
by women fulfilling their
years of training and edu- ( \ I
cation. I \
"Women do a lot of J
invisible work in society, .J
for free, at a cost to them- /
selves," Schiebinger / L
said. \ B
Schiebinger's report, / / \
published recently in \ (
Academe, argues that \ \ fY
this invisible work harms \ \M
universities by putting an if
extra burden on professors \M
that might prevent them W A
from serving at their full m I \
potential. m
"Institutions K
need to think of M
housework ben- M
efits as part of Z_X
the structur- /
al cost of J [
doing (__ 1

business," she wrote, "With lab costs
running into the millions of dollars,
supporting the human resource
involved scientists' ability to be
more productive takes full advan
tage of investments in space and
equipment."
Schiebinger argues that the costs
of her suggestions would, if treated as
a part of employee benefits, prove
beneficial to workers, while allowing
professors to increase their produc
tivity.
"I don't want this to be just about
women," Schiebinger added. "Men
and women who are trained to do sci
ence can do science and men and
women who are trained to do house
work, can do housework. The profes
sion shouldn't be closed to either
gender."

offices and universities offer organ
ized childcare for their employees, so
their employees can focus on their
work without worrying about home
life.
"We've had a process of taking
things out of the home and profes
sionalizing them," she said. "I think
that Americans are always respond
ing to the short term, and we need to
do some long term thinking.
Something needs to happen to
change this situation."
Within twenty years, Schiebinger
believes, university-sponsored house
care will take its place along with day
care as a common perk of academic
careers, for men and women, married
and single.
Her ideas already connect with
some emerging social trends. In
Sweden, some Swedish companies
already provide housework benefits,
and the Swedish government is cur
rently experimenting with tax relief
on housecleaning services.
On National No Housework Day
in early April, the Clayman Institute
will hold a meeting with Stanford
administrators, open to the public,
discussing their policy suggestions.
