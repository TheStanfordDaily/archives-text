RFK: The Journey to Justice, a new play
co-commissioned by Stanford Lively Arts for
the acclaimed radio theater company, L.A.
Theatre Works, chronicles the transformation
of Robert F. Kennedy from initial indifference
and ambivalence toward Martin Luther King,
Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement to his role
as a crusader and champion for social justice.
During this pre-performance conversation
with members of the L.A. Theatre Works
Company, we will look at this behind-the
scenes story of a high-stakes political drama
that dared the country and its citizens to
look into the mirror and change.

conversations about creativity, innovation,
and discovery across the disciplines.
