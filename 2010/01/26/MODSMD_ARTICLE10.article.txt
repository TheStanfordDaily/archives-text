# BROADLY SPEAKING
## (Lack of) Sex in the Stanny 
### Molly Spaeth 
When I first found out that I had a col
umn in The Stanford Daily, I
skipped and paraded around the
house for a full day, bragging to anyone who
would listen (i.e., my cat and brother) that I
was the next Carrie Bradshaw!
Upon hearing this, my cat stared at me
blankly and my brother asked me to pass the
Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
Unfortunately, however, up to this point I
don't think I've really done Carrie Bradshaw
justice. Namely, I haven't touched on the sub
ject near and dear to her heart, and the hearts
of all those other tortured souls who, like me,
came into Stanford still believing in truth,
beauty, and above all things, love.
Dating at Stanford, or more accurately,
the lack of dating at Stanford.
Ahhh, the argument harkens back to the
beginning of time, as every year the produc
ers of the Real World wrestle with their con
sciousnesses, trying to prove to the new fresh
men that this lack-of-dating stereotype does
n't exist, while simultaneously resigning
themselves to the fact that it really, truly does.
0.K., to be fair, I should clarify what I
mean. Stanford's romantic realm consists of
three main genres: you're either married,
"hooking up" or spending your weekends
waiting for your own Mr. Big with your girl
friends, Nutella and endless Sex and the City
marathons.
But, why is this the case? Although appar
ently the Stanford student body as a whole is
supposed to be really smart, anyone eaves
dropping on the conversation I had at brunch
this morning (my roommate from Madrid
spent five minutes trying to figure out
whether someone had switched her tooth
brush because she couldn't remember if it
was dark purple or not afterward, I had to
pick a speck of tater tot out of her eyebrow)
could come to the conclusion that the major
ity of us are a far cry from high-minded intel
lectuals; some of us (myself included) might
even be more along the lines of 10th graders
straight out of Sweet Valley High. All in all,
we're relatively "normal," and relatively nor
mal people go on dates, right?
Either we're not actually that normal, or
I've just been rollin' with the wrong crowd.
A dear friend of mine described her
thoughts on her own dating woes to me in de
tail over a mixed greens salad at Pluto's a few
weeks ago: "People at Stanford don't date
because we're already so critical of ourselves.
We're even more critical of the traits we look
for in a significant other. We set impossible
standards that no one can ever hope to live
up to because we can't even live up to our
own standards."
I gave her theory a lot of thought and was
really starting to agree with her when I ran
into an old friend at Stern dining this past
weekend. As we were catching up, she men
tioned in passing that she had gone to Cirque
de Soleil the night before. After a little more
squeezing, she admitted that it had been a
date.
"Yeah, but I'm probably not gonna go out

with him again. He's nice, but I'm just not
that into him. It's 0.K., though, I have anoth
er date on Tuesday."
At this point, the risk of dropping my tater
tots in my coffee was running pretty high, as
both my jaw and arms fell to the floor in be
wilderment. "Homegirl," I said. "How did
you manage to find THE TWO boys at Stan
ford that actually go on dates, never mind
that you're cycling through them both in one
week?"
To which she waved me off and said, "No,
no, that's not it. Guys want to go on dates. The
thing is that girls at Stanford come in with this
pre-conceived notion that boys don't go on
dates, so they just accept it. It's great for the
guys, they don't have to spend money and get
their fill of frat-party hook-ups. I COM
MAND to go on dates, so I go on dates. It's
actually pretty simple."
Homegirl's got a point. I suppose I could
be a little more proactive, rather than hang
ing out in my pajamas all day, eating Nutella
and over-analyzing every other text from last
night ("What do you think he meant by, 'See
you later'?"). However, it must be said that a
prerequisite for this whole COMMAND
ING the date thing has to be that the guy is at
least remotely interested. (But, you know,
minor detail. We can work with that.)
In any case, ladies and gentlemen, I'm
going to start COMMANDING to go on
dates, and I suggest you do it, too. If we start
now, hopefully by the time the incoming class
of 2016 rolls around, the producers of the
Real World will have some new stereotype
that needs disproving. (GPAs plummet as
Stanford students average four dates a
week?!)
We can only hope.
Molly is COMMANDING you take her on a
date. To check her availability, favorite food

Here, you're either
married,'hooking up' or
