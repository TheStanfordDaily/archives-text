# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Disinformation in a Digital World 
### Danny Crichton 
When the Internet first entered the
public imagination, it was seen as a
beacon of freedom from the oppres
sive Cold War decades. Information could
travel around the world unhindered by clois
tered regimes, goods could be easily bought
and sold across borders and enormous audi
ences could instantly encounter new ideas.
Every ill of the world could be solved, it
seemed, with a well-designed Web site and
some publicity.
These initial hopes were well-founded in
the heady 1990s and the early years of the new
millennium. The Internet provided new av
enues to understand the world and democra
tized information dissemination. The first
days of the Internet filled in reporting gaps
and connected distant places together on an
equal footing the so-called flattening of the
world.
Yet, in the last couple of months, the dark
side forces that commentators have predict
ed would come information fragmenta
tion, political polarization, rampant conspir
acy theories seem to have rapidly ad
vanced. Today, the sheer granularity of sites
allows those of all political persuasions to
hear information from only one side, lower
ing the sophistication of our national politi
cal discourse.
Chris Anderson explains in "The Long
Tail" that retailers would do better on the In
ternet if they focused on selling a little of a
many goods as opposed to selling a few block
buster items. Unfortunately, that theory is now
being applied to information, with dangerous
prospects ahead. Blogs and their associated
portals are providing information with an
enormously distorted lens, yet few seem will
ing to undo the damage.
In un-free societies, there is an enormous
need for a source of information that does not
originate from the state press or state televi
sion. The Internet can supply information

about the outside world and generate move
ments for governmental accountability. Coun
tries like China and Iran attempt to restrict ac
cess to such technology for the single purpose
of reducing the amount of news that is not
under their control.
America has passed an inflection point on
the benefits of freedom of information.
Following the long tail phenomenon, in
formation is available for all persuasions.
Think Obama is the best president ever?
There are thousands of Web sites available to
learn more. Think Obama is the Antichrist
(and born in Kenya)? There are thousands of
sites for you, too. This range is found with
every issue, from repairing the lights at my
local elementary school to national health
care reform.
The power and beauty of the Internet was
the exchange of competing theories a mar
ketplace of ideas. Ignorance could have no
place in a world where every word can be ver
ified by thousands. If someone such as Sean
Hannity or Rachel Maddow made up a story,
they would be quickly vilified for their inaccu
racies the Internet could provide the nec
essary proof.
That was then. Few sites now cater to a
wide gamut of political views (that would be
considered too mainstream media), but in
stead focus on the provocative and hyper-par
tisan. Readers of newspapers would be con
fronted with a range of opinion articles, but
today, it is possible to never see an article that

challenges one's beliefs.
The solution to such an endemic problem
does not come from placing restrictions on the
Internet or abridging the First Amendment.
Instead of looking at the suppliers, we need to
focus on those demanding these Web sites.
The answer comes from a radical look at
how students are taught in schools and col
leges. We need to rebuild our education cur
riculum to impart on students better source
analysis tools and scholastic judgment. When
I receive an e-mail chain letter that says that
Coke is green, or that Obama is attempting to
eliminate the elderly, I have the skills to do my
due diligence and attempt to ascertain some
level of truth. Whether Snopes or a Google
search, the answer is usually extremely easy
to find.
We live in a world where there are no
longer gatekeepers to the truth. The few jour
nalists left can barely find time to check
sources (and sometimes they just check
Wikipedia, as the Maurice Jarre "fake quote in
cident shows us). Editors no longer organize
information from the accurate to the un
wieldy. It is up to us as readers not to be be
holden to the information we read and instead
question it. The truth is a lot more mercurial
now.
Our society does not have to be torn asun
der by the polarization of the information on
the Internet. But we cannot expect bloggers to
do the heavy lifting. If we want to begin the
process of returning to a logical and fact-driv
en society, we need to look no further than our
own reading habits. Free societies have a lot of
work to do before we can handle this long tail
of information.
Danny Crichton was busy being a responsible
student this weekend by taking the GRE, so his
lowly, outgoing editor brought back this gem.
