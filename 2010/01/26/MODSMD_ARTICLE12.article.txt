# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

### 
In response to Monday's Editorial,
"Obama's handling of Haiti trumps Bush's
Katrina Response," while I agree that Bush
and the administration had problems with
Katrina, I think you ignore a lot of other
things that later happened.
Hurricanes Rita and Ike came through
Houston later in his administration and they
were handled excellently. Not to downplay at
all the Katrina disaster, but Bush learned
from his mistakes and proved it in Houston.
The hurricanes were not quite as strong as
Katrina, but they could have been just as bad

had the Bush administration not learned
from Katrina. You probably did not hear
much about them because they were handled
so well and that's why it was not such a big
deal.
Another problem was that Katrina was
not "supposed" to hit New Orleans it was
a last day surprise. That does not excuse the
mishandlings of FEMA and Bush after the
hurricane, but I think they deserve a little less
criticism for the planning. It is impossible to
evacuate over a million people in less than 24
hours. But really, they learned and other hur

ricane disasters were avoided. Houston has
six million people and, a year after Katrina,
was evacuated well and had very few deaths,
mostly just property damage that was un
avoidable.
The Editorial Board wrote that "it is en
couraging that our nation finally has leaders
in place who can manage disasters effective
ly." Yes, Obama learned from Katrina. But so
did Bush, so give him some credit.
