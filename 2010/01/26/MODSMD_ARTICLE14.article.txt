## Men split vs. Arizona schools 
### CHRIS DERRICK 
Half of the weekend went just as planned for Stanford
men's swimming and diving.The other half took a minor detour
when No. 4 Arizona upended the No. 2 Cardinal 174-124 on Fri
day. The Cardinal responded by defeating Arizona State con
vincingly 140-86 on Saturday.
The Arizona meet, which was the focus of the weekend,
stayed close through 10 events. Cory Chitwood's win in the 200
backstroke gave the Wildcats a 85-84 lead.They went on to win
five of the next six events and would not trail for the rest of the
meet.
Stanford won six of the sixteen events. Senior Eugene Godsoe
(100-yard backstroke and 100-yard butterfly) and Junior Alex
ColvOle (50-yard and 100-yard freestyle) each won two events.
Godsoe also placed second in the 200-yard backstroke.
Sophomore Chad laTourrette led a Stanford sweep of the
1000-yard freestyle in the meet's second event, helping the Car
dinal jump out to an early lead. He was followed by sopho
mores Michael Zoldos and Trevor Scheid. Zoldos came back to
finish second in the 500-yard freestyle. Stanford also won the
200-yard medley relay. Times across the board were on the
slower side, unsurprising given the poor weather and the fact
that both teams plan to be at their best much later in the season.
The Wildcats had only one double winner, Ben Grado,in the
one-meter and three-meter diving events. Nimrod Shapira Bar-
Or (200-yard freestyle), Marcus Titus (100-yard breaststroke),
AJ. Tipton (200-yard Butterfly), Chitwood, Clark Burckle
(200-yard breast), Jean Basson (500-yard free) and Austen
Thompson (200-yard IM) all won events for the Wildcats.
Though the loss certainly stings, the Cardinal is keeping the
match in perspective.
"We will take the loss and learn from it," Godsoe said. "We have
a couple more
important dual meets coming up (USC and Cal),then Pac-lOs,
then the NCAA
Championships. We want to improve every weekend and be
our best at the end
of the season."
The Cardinal also took some confidence from the fact that
Arizona chose to wear their faster meet suits while Stanford
swimmers wore practice suits, which produce more drag. This
choice enforces the idea that the Stanford team is choosing to
sacrifice sharp performances in regular season meets for better
performance in the postseason.
"Every program has their own reasoning and beliefs con
cerning training regiments and the amount of rest needed be
fore these later meets," explained senior diver Dwight Dumais.
"We believe that our program works for us and we will be ready
when those meets arrive."
Performance at those meets should be bolstered by the re
turn of Dumais, a five-time all-American, who is currently out
with a shoulder injury. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that 13-time
ail-American and NCAA 100-yard butterfly Champion,
Austin Staab, will return this season for the Cardinal. Staab has
taken a leave of absence from the university for personal rea
sons. Out of respect for the privacy of Staab and his family, no
further details have been released by Stanford swimming.
Stanford got back some of its momentum by defeating Ari
zona State handily on Saturday.The win saw nine different Car
dinal men win eight different events. The lone double champi
on was senior David Mosko in the 200-yard butterfly and the
500-yard freestyle.
La Tourrette repeated his Friday win in the 1000-yard
freestyle, as did Colville in the 100-yard freestyle event. Two
freshman, Matthew Swanston (200-yard backstroke) and Matt
Thompson (400-yard IM) won their events, highlighting a
weekend that saw many freshmen getting their first taste of top
flight competition.
The Cardinal will send its divers to the USD winter prelims
at the end of the week. The next time the full team competes is
February sth against Cal State-Bakersfield.
