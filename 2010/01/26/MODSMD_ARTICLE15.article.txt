# STRONG START
## Men dominate in tennis opener 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford Men's Tennis Team defeated
Sacramento State 7-0 in a dual match Saturday at the
Taube Family Tennis Center.
"This was one of those matches we're expected to
win," said senior Greg Hirshman. "But teams like
Sacramento State are always going to bring their A
game to Stanford. There's no pressure on them and
they can come out free-swinging. It's nice to get the
season started off in the right direction. Whenever you
can get a win, you'll take it."
The match was scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. but was
delayed until 3 p.m. because of rain. Three doubles
matches were played until conclusion, but another
rain delay struck just as the singles matches were start
ing up. It wasn't over until 8:15 p.m., but the Cardinal
eventually came away with a victory in its season
opener.
"You always have to be prepared for any sort of de
lays with weather," said sophomore Bradley Klahn.
"You just have to stay focused and recharged. You got
to be ready to go right away."
Stanford opened the match by winning two of the
three doubles matches to earn the doubles point.
Sophomores Ryan Thacher and Klahn, the top
ranked doubles team in the nation, defeated Kiryl
Flarbatsiuk and Anton Stryhas 8-4.
Senior Richard Wire and Junior Alex Clayton won
their doubles match 8-1. The pair won an astounding
twenty-six points in a row during one stretch.
"We were serving well and returning well," Clayton
said. "I didn't even realize that we had won that many
points in a row until Richard pointed it out after twen
ty or so. I've never won 26 points in a row."
Sacramento State's only victory on the day came in
the No. 3 doubles match. Jason Smith and Flolden
Ching defeated Stanford Freshman Matt Kandath
and Denis Lin 8-4.
Kandath got some redemption in his singles match
and picked up his first career dual match victory with
a 6-0,6-0 domination of Ching.
"Ching and Smith played great as a team, but I had
an easier time keeping Ching out of rhythm in the sin
gles match," Kandath said. "It was satisfying to come
back with that kind of a match."

Klahn defeated Stryhas in their No. 1 singles match,
6-1,6-4.
"The rain delay definitely changed things a little
bit. I noticed that the balls got a lot heavier and the
pace of the match slowed up a fair amount," Klahn ex
plained. "I think I played a decent enough match to get
a win."
Stanford earned the clinching 4th point of the
match after senior Greg Hirshman finished off Tim
Lantin Jr. 6-1,6-1.
"Coach Whitlinger was a little worried that we
might come out flat after the second rain delay, but I
won my first set and it worked out pretty good from
there," Hirshman said. "It's always fun to look up at
the scoreboard and see that you clinched the match."
After the mach had been clinched, Clayton beat
Harbatsiuk in a third set tiebreaker. Harbatsiuk went
up 2-0 in the first-to-ten tiebreaker, but Clayton
stormed back with ten unanswered points to win the
match.
Wire won No. 4 singles in three sets and Thacher
defeated Marco Starcevic 6-4,6-1 in the No. 3 match.
Stanford will play UNC-Wilmington at home on
Friday in the first round of the National Team Indoor
Championships.
