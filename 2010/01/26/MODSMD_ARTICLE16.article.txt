## Card upsets top-ranked Bruins 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a stunning display of talent and pas
sion, the Stanford women's gymnastics
team defeated No. 1 UCLA in Sunday's
home meet in Burnham Pavilion. The
Bruins (4-1) arrived on the Farm expect
ing a victory, but the Cardinal's competi
tive spirit, combined with consecutive
outstanding performances, put Stanford
on top with a win of 196.425-195.825. The
win improves Stanford's record to 2-1 and
as the current No. 8 team, the Cardinal
can expect to climb in the NCAA rank
ings and watch its southern California ri

vals slip from their top position.
And what was the primary source of
the Cardinal success? More than any
thing else, it was the one aspect of the
sport that the team has been striving to
improve since day one: consistency. A
large number of high-scoring perform
ances right from the start gave the Stan
ford women just the confidence and mo
mentum they needed to continue through
the competition. Determined to build off
of each other's prior performances, eight
teammates yielded scores of 9.9 through
out the day, an especially incredible feat
considering that they had only one 9.9
over the course of their first two meets.

Junior Shelley Alexander was one par
ticular standout on Stanford's first event
of the day, the vault. The 9.9 she achieved
so early in the competition proved to her
teammates that they were capable of de
livering repeated solid performances and
upsetting the visiting Bruins.
Though the remaining vault scores
were strong, it was during Stanford's sec
ond rotation on the uneven bars that the
team became very optimistic about the
meet's outcome, Tlie team stuck four out
of six dismounts and head coach Kristen
Smyth noted how impressed she was by
her team's aggressive approach to the
bars performances. It still wasn't enough

to put Stanford in the lead at the halfway
point of the meet, however, as the Bruins
still led by 0.10, mostly due to outstanding
scores in the first two rotations from
UCLA sophomore Vanessa Zamarripa.
Thus, it was crucial for the Stanford
women to deliver high scores on the third
event, the beam, which also happens to be
the one they have been struggling with
the most. TTiis struggle was evident in
multiple falls during the competition, yet
they were fortunately paralleled with sev
eral UCLA falls on the floor. As a result,
Stanford managed to take the lead after
