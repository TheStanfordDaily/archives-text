# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Card upsets top-ranked Bruins 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a stunning display of talent and pas
sion, the Stanford women's gymnastics
team defeated No. 1 UCLA in Sunday's
home meet in Burnham Pavilion. The
Bruins (4-1) arrived on the Farm expect
ing a victory, but the Cardinal's competi
tive spirit, combined with consecutive
outstanding performances, put Stanford
on top with a win of 196.425-195.825. The
win improves Stanford's record to 2-1 and
as the current No. 8 team, the Cardinal
can expect to climb in the NCAA rank
ings and watch its southern California ri

vals slip from their top position.
And what was the primary source of
the Cardinal success? More than any
thing else, it was the one aspect of the
sport that the team has been striving to
improve since day one: consistency. A
large number of high-scoring perform
ances right from the start gave the Stan
ford women just the confidence and mo
mentum they needed to continue through
the competition. Determined to build off
of each other's prior performances, eight
teammates yielded scores of 9.9 through
out the day, an especially incredible feat
considering that they had only one 9.9
over the course of their first two meets.

Junior Shelley Alexander was one par
ticular standout on Stanford's first event
of the day, the vault. The 9.9 she achieved
so early in the competition proved to her
teammates that they were capable of de
livering repeated solid performances and
upsetting the visiting Bruins.
Though the remaining vault scores
were strong, it was during Stanford's sec
ond rotation on the uneven bars that the
team became very optimistic about the
meet's outcome, Tlie team stuck four out
of six dismounts and head coach Kristen
Smyth noted how impressed she was by
her team's aggressive approach to the
bars performances. It still wasn't enough

to put Stanford in the lead at the halfway
point of the meet, however, as the Bruins
still led by 0.10, mostly due to outstanding
scores in the first two rotations from
UCLA sophomore Vanessa Zamarripa.
Thus, it was crucial for the Stanford
women to deliver high scores on the third
event, the beam, which also happens to be
the one they have been struggling with
the most. TTiis struggle was evident in
multiple falls during the competition, yet
they were fortunately paralleled with sev
eral UCLA falls on the floor. As a result,
Stanford managed to take the lead after
the third rotation.
"Consistency on the beam has
been an issue in practice. We are in
the process of finding the best lineup
and for us it is a matter of getting
more confidence," Smyth said.
Sophomore Catherine Nguyen,
who has been unable to compete fre
quently because of injury, made her
second-ever beam performance (9.2)
on Sunday. Smyth was proud of the
way Nguyen stepped in to the lineup
and stated that "Catherine is some
one who will make a big difference."
"We needed that 9.2," Smyth said.
Likewise, senior Carly Janiga de
livered once again, achieving a 9.875
which contributed to her season-best
all-around score of 39.550. For the
first time this year, however, Janiga
was barely edged for the all-around
title by UCLA's Anna Li, who
earned a 39.575. Nonetheless, her
outstanding performances con
firmed that she is deserving of her
position as the No. 4 all-around com
petitor in the nation.
The final event of the day, the
floor, clinched the victory for Stan
ford and according to Smyth, "ended
the day with an exclamation point."

The team's significant preparation
and grueling training for this event
paid off, as four of the six performanc
es received scores of 9.9 or higher.
And it was this exhilarating end to
the competition that the standing
room only crowd of 1,503 had been
eagerly awaiting. In fact, Smyth and
the team felt that the extreme sup
port from the stands was a serious
contribution to their confidence and
ultimate success. It is this same fan
turnout that they hope to maintain
for the season's two remaining home
meets.
First, however, the Cardinal will
head to Corvallis to take on Oregon
State this Friday night at 7 p.m. In
what should be a tough meet, the
team doesn't plan to make any addi
tions to the lineup, as they hope to re
peat the consistency of Sunday's per
formances. Furthermore, with a good
workout of competitors who haven't
yet made their way in to the lineup,
the team hopes to gain depth in the
roster and prepare for the rest of the
season, including another inevitable
match-up with UCLA. Armed with
the confidence from beating the best,
the Stanford women can enter any
gym knowing that anything, even a
national championship, is well within
their reach.
