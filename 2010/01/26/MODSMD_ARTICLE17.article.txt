# Women swim to sweep
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With two wins this weekend at Avery Aquatic Center,
the No. 4 Stanford women's swimming and diving team
(6-0, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference) established itself as one
of the preeminent forces in the conference and one of the
top contenders for this year's overall NCAA title. On Fri
day, the Cardinal overpowered No. 2 Arizona (6-2, 3-2
Pac-10) 173-125 and completed its sweep on Saturday
with a 184.5-111.5 win over Arizona State (6-5, 2-4 Pac
-10).
Given past history between the Wildcats and the Car
dinal, Friday's meet was expected to be close and to come
down to the final events, much like last year's meet
that one was decided in the last event, with Stanford tak
ing the win by .16 seconds.
The first race of the afternoon, the 200-yard medley
relay, seemed to point to yet another tight meet, with Ari
zona's Leone Vorster out-touching Stanford sophomore
Sam Woodward by .01 seconds. The Wildcats continued to
build momentum, posting wins in the 1000-yard freestyle,
the 100-yard backstroke and the 100-yard breaststroke.
However, Stanford proceeded to put on an impressive
display of dominance it won the final 11 events and 12
events overall.
The big momentum shift of the meet came in the 50
free. Junior Kate Dwelley, sophomore Betsey Webb and
Woodward won the top three places to narrow Arizona's
lead to one and the Cardinal never looked back. Another
big event was the 100 free, where freshman Andi Murez
won from the first lane over teammate Dwelley.
The Card was paced by big days from seniors Julia Smit
and Elaine Breeden. Smit won the 200-yard backstroke

in-state counterpart the following day.
and the 200-yard individual medley
by big margins and Breeden won
the 100- and 200-yard butterfly.
Stanford's diving team made sig
nificant contributions as well. It
won first and second place on both
events, the 1-meter and 3-meter
springboard, with senior Carmen
Stellar winning on both heights.
Adverse weather conditions
played a role in the meet, with in
termittent rain falling on the Avery
pool.
"The diving was mediocre for
everyone," Stellar said. "We were
just handling the weather and try
ing to stay focused."
Head coach Lea Maurer was
pleased with her team's perform
ance.
"We expected it to be a tight
meet and we felt like it was," Maur
er said. "We got some big perform
ances from the younger swimmers.
If we can build on that, we can have
a good performance in the champi
onship season."
"It was a big win for us [Ari
zona has] always been a really good
team," Breeden added. "We really
pulled together and had some
breakthrough swims."
The Cardinal continued to per
form well the next day against Ari
zona State. It never trailed in the
meet and won 13 out of 16 events.
Smit led the Cardinal once again,
with victories in the 200 free and
the 400 IM. She also broke the 18-
year-old Avery Pool record in the
400 IM with an "A" qualifying time
of 4:05.14, which had previously
been held by Olympic gold medal
ist Summer Sanders.
"[Arizona State] swam better
than they did against Cal," Maurer
said. "They had some good races.
Our team was showing fatigue, but
I was happy with the results."
Looking ahead, Stanford has
three Pac-10 dual meets remaining
before the season-ending Pac-10
and NCAA tournaments. It is look
ing to go undefeated in dual meets
for the second consecutive season.
"[Going undefeated is] definite
ly something we want to do, but it's
not our main goal," Smit said.
"We're focused on the champi
onship meets at the end of the sea
son."
The Cardinal's toughest compe
tition for the Pac-10 title will most
likely come from California, which
also completed a sweep of the Ari
zona schools this past weekend.
"Cal's still the defending cham
pion," Maurer said. "We're tired
but we're tough, which makes me
feel good about the championship
season."
Right now, the Cardinal's
biggest challenge is to be able to
swim a number of meets in a row.
"Back-to-back meets are really
important," Smit said. "Pac-lOs are
seven swims in a row and NCAAs
are six. We came back from yester
day, stayed focused and swam
well."
"We got a good indication of
where we are," Maurer said. "We
have to give [the swimmers]
enough rest so they can peak at the
right time,"
