# Women swim to sweep
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With two wins this weekend at Avery Aquatic Center,
the No. 4 Stanford women's swimming and diving team
(6-0, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference) established itself as one
of the preeminent forces in the conference and one of the
top contenders for this year's overall NCAA title. On Fri
day, the Cardinal overpowered No. 2 Arizona (6-2, 3-2
Pac-10) 173-125 and completed its sweep on Saturday
with a 184.5-111.5 win over Arizona State (6-5, 2-4 Pac
-10).
Given past history between the Wildcats and the Car
dinal, Friday's meet was expected to be close and to come
down to the final events, much like last year's meet
that one was decided in the last event, with Stanford tak
ing the win by .16 seconds.
The first race of the afternoon, the 200-yard medley
relay, seemed to point to yet another tight meet, with Ari
zona's Leone Vorster out-touching Stanford sophomore
Sam Woodward by .01 seconds. The Wildcats continued to
build momentum, posting wins in the 1000-yard freestyle,
the 100-yard backstroke and the 100-yard breaststroke.
However, Stanford proceeded to put on an impressive
display of dominance it won the final 11 events and 12
events overall.
The big momentum shift of the meet came in the 50
free. Junior Kate Dwelley, sophomore Betsey Webb and
Woodward won the top three places to narrow Arizona's
lead to one and the Cardinal never looked back. Another
big event was the 100 free, where freshman Andi Murez
won from the first lane over teammate Dwelley.
The Card was paced by big days from seniors Julia Smit
and Elaine Breeden. Smit won the 200-yard backstroke
