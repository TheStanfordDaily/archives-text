# Formula 1 on the Farm?

W elcome to the Pac-500.
Vrrrrooooommm.
In a blur of cardinal red, a lone car disappears down Cam
pus Drive, leaving a sickly sweet smell of ethanol fumes
swirling in the early morning mist. On the other side of the
Quad, the high-pitched notes of the visiting team's engines
can be heard warming up, breaking into the dreams of sleepy
undergrads.
It's a Sunday deep into May of 2018, and after a disap
pointing showing in the race across the Bay last weekend, the
Stanford team are back on campus to face strong challenges
from the Pac-10 schools' latest designs, among them the con
ference-leading car from UCLA.
Jess Harris knows the pressure is on in her last year on the
Farm. Sitting behind the wheel of the Cardinal's innovative
but inconsistent challenger, she is well aware that the honor
of being the first female Formula 1 driver for many years
could lie in wait for her at the end of the season.
Nando Garcia, on the pitwall, is probably feeling a little
more comfortable, with a GM scholarship to stay on at Stan
ford for his Ph.D. already secured. But none of this really tem
pers his ambition and the disappointment that the car he built
came dead last in Berkeley.
Back now to 2010, and as you probably already know,
Toby Gerhart the undisputed star of Stanford Football for
the last few years didn't win the Heisman Trophy. Without
taking anything away from Mark Ingram, it is easy to argue
that Gerhart's performances, and the records he set last sea
son, should have landed that prize. So, the real question is: had
he played for, say, the Longhorns, would the result have been
different?
Simply put, Stanford is not a football school. And it prob
ably never will be one. The history, consistency and sheer re
cruiting power of the traditional football powerhouses is just
too much, and perhaps the only real way to compete would
be to throw out something this school treasures more than
the Axe: its lofty academic standards.
Truth be told, top-level football
isn't really a perfect match here, and
neither are most of the other big
American sports.
But there is one that could just be,
one that is pretty ingrained in U.S. cul
ture, a sport that requires high tech
nology and engineering prowess be
sides athletic ability and hand-eye co
ordination.
Motor-racing.
Not just that, but most of the
schools in the Pac-10 have pretty big
science and engineering establish
ments. If challenged to build some sort
of racing car, it would not be beyond
the abilities of their students and fac
ulty. In fact, it would be the perfect
way to unite the academic and athlet
ic sides of these schools.

At the same time, the U.S. auto-in
dustry lies in deep trouble. They failed
to invest in new technologies such as
hybrid vehicles and have been swiftly
overtaken by foreign competition.
Whether or not these corporations
survive will come down to the innova
tive ideas of bright minds, something
Stanford has in abundance.
Building cleaner, safer, more fuel
efficient cars that are powered by cut
ting edge and renewable technologies
is the new Holy Grail, and something
that an institution like Stanford
should be heavily involved in. So why
not do this publicly, throw the full
weight of the student body, the alumni
and both the academic and athletic
departments behind it?
With sensible safety restrictions
and crash testing, motor racing is no
more dangerous than football. It is
also no more environmentally damag
ing the fuel the cars burn through
in a race being just a drop in the ocean
of that used by fans traveling to any

major sporting event.
It should be a fully supported Var
sity sport, bringing huge publicity and
investment to the Farm. Yes, there
would be some significant costs in
volved in kick-starting such a project,
and I'm not sure of the complexities of
getting some kind of NCAA agree
ment or certification, but, as the con
tinual building work on campus at
tests to, even in the financial crisis,
Stanford could do this.
As the TV cameras follow the lead
ing cars speeding down Palm Drive,
panning up to catch the Quad basking
in the spring sunshine, the hills of the
Dish behind framing the shot, you'd
know it was all worth it. For that one
indelible image, mixing high technolo
gy and adrenaline with the tranquility
and history of this place, beamed live
across the nation.

his rusty 1990 Geo Metro. Give him
some tips at tom.taylor@stanford.edu.
