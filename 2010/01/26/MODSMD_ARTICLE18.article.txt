# Formula 1 on the Farm?

W elcome to the Pac-500.
Vrrrrooooommm.
In a blur of cardinal red, a lone car disappears down Cam
pus Drive, leaving a sickly sweet smell of ethanol fumes
swirling in the early morning mist. On the other side of the
Quad, the high-pitched notes of the visiting team's engines
can be heard warming up, breaking into the dreams of sleepy
undergrads.
It's a Sunday deep into May of 2018, and after a disap
pointing showing in the race across the Bay last weekend, the
Stanford team are back on campus to face strong challenges
from the Pac-10 schools' latest designs, among them the con
ference-leading car from UCLA.
Jess Harris knows the pressure is on in her last year on the
Farm. Sitting behind the wheel of the Cardinal's innovative
but inconsistent challenger, she is well aware that the honor
of being the first female Formula 1 driver for many years
could lie in wait for her at the end of the season.
Nando Garcia, on the pitwall, is probably feeling a little
more comfortable, with a GM scholarship to stay on at Stan
ford for his Ph.D. already secured. But none of this really tem
pers his ambition and the disappointment that the car he built
came dead last in Berkeley.
Back now to 2010, and as you probably already know,
Toby Gerhart the undisputed star of Stanford Football for
the last few years didn't win the Heisman Trophy. Without
taking anything away from Mark Ingram, it is easy to argue
that Gerhart's performances, and the records he set last sea
son, should have landed that prize. So, the real question is: had
he played for, say, the Longhorns, would the result have been
different?
Simply put, Stanford is not a football school. And it prob
ably never will be one. The history, consistency and sheer re
cruiting power of the traditional football powerhouses is just
too much, and perhaps the only real way to compete would
be to throw out something this school treasures more than
the Axe: its lofty academic standards.
