## Emergency responders unaffected by blackout Power failure poses no threat to University emergency plan 
### TROY YANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week's power outage, while inconve
niencing many, also provided a test for
Stanford's emergency response routines.
University life was placed on a brief stand
by when a Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)
Company high-voltage transmission line
failed at approximately 5:20 a.m. Tuesday
morning and triggered a power outage across
the central campus. Responders did not cor
rect the problem until approximately 10 a.m.
that morning.
The transmission line failure also caused
Stanford's Energy Facility, also known as
Cardinal Cogen, to shut down, resulting in a
blackout in some campus residences. As a
result, all card-activated doors in the affected
Wilbur, Stern and Crothers residences were
rendered functionless during that period.
This, however, did not pose a significant
problem for a well-prepared emergency
response team.
"In the case of a power outage, such as
occurred last Tuesday, the building access sys
tems in place on many of our large residences
are supported by independent battery back
up systems," wrote Executive Director of
Student Housing Rodger Whitney in an e
mail to The Daily. "These batteries keep the
card readers functioning normally for
approximately four hours without electricity.
In a few places, where the power had failed
earlier in the morning, the readers did go out
before the power was restored. In those situ
ations, Student Housing posted notices alert
ing residents needing to enter the buildings
that they should use the main entrance, and
had someone stationed at each of those doors
to let people in.
"In the case of an emergency in a building
without card access, the first responders (Fire,
Police) gain access via a special (physical)
key," Whitney added.
Cardinal Cogen also supplies the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital and the Stanford
Hospital with chilled water for cooling elec
trical equipment and computers, and steam
for sterilizing instruments. But Cogen was
shortly restored, and Stanford resumed sup
plying steam and chilled water shortly there
after.
"When I came to work at 8 o'clock, we
were at full power," said Robert Dicks, senior
media relations manager at the Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital.
The SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory, which gets its power directly
from the PG&E line, remained without
power until Tuesday evening. As such, the
University generators provided SLAC with
electricity until power was restored.
"The electricity affects us differently and
that's because of the linear accelerator, which
uses quite a bit of electricity," said Robert
Brown, director of communications at SLAC.
Because of this, staff at SLAC are current
ly working on an "after-action" report to doc
ument what they've learned and devise a
strategy for dealing with future crises.
Whitney added that because power out
ages like last Tuesday's have widespread con
sequences across the campus, they receive a
rapid response.
"The campus power system supports not
only Student Housing, but also the entire aca
demic campus (with labs containing sensitive
experiments, classrooms without natural
light, etc.), so any time there is a power out
age, significant efforts are put into getting the
situation resolved as soon as possible,"
Whitney said.'Tt is not often that we lose
power from the Cardinal Cogen plant, and
when a problem does develop, it is usually
resolved quickly."
