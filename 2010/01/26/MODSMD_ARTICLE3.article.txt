"Not since Britain burned down the White House...has our national security

been so directly threatened as it is now, by the existence of nuclear weapons."

RONALD REAGAN's words, spoken by GEORGE SHULTZ, former U.S. Secretary of State

former Secretary of Defense William Perry
and former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn for sev
eral years to encourage international gov
ernments to reduce and eventually elimi
nate their nuclear arsenals.
Shultz explained the motivation for his
efforts by sharing an anecdote that took
place during his years as Secretary of State
under President Reagan.
"In one of our private one-on-one meet
ings one evening, [Reagan] said, 'Not since
Britain burned down the White House in
1814 has our national security been so
directly threatened as it is now, by the exis
tence of nuclear weapons,"' Shultz said. "We
decided if we could just get rid of them, the
world would be a much safer place,"
Prof. Drell spoke at length about the

In front of a packed audience in
Tresidder Memorial Union yesterday, for
mer U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
and renowned physicist Sidney Drell spoke
about the dangers of nuclear proliferation
and their joint efforts to rid the world of
nuclear weapons.
The event was organized by Stanford's
Center for International Security and
Cooperation (CISAC) and moderated by
Phil Taubman '7l, former Daily editor in
chief and Washington bureau chief of The
New York Times.
Shultz and Drell have been working with
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,

international landscape of current nuclear
proliferation policy, emphasizing the
urgency of the need to fight the spread of
nuclear weapons.
"One huge difference between the Cold
War days and today is that there are no
longer just the two superpowers, but rather,
we are in a world where many more coun
tries possess the know-how to create
nuclear weaponry," Drell said. "We are see
ing that with North Korea and Iran. What
we end up with is an extremely unstable sit
uation that we should not be comfortable
with going forward."
One of the most prominent themes that
ran throughout the two men's commentary
was the necessity and difficulty of
coming up with specific tenable strategies to

prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
"It is all fine and well to say that you want
to rid the world of nukes, but how do you do
it?" Shultz asked. "In a sense, the battle of
rhetoric has been won ... almost everyone
agrees that getting rid of nuclear weapons is
a good thing. But now the battle of action is
in front of you ... North Korea has nuclear
weapons, Iran wants them and there is seem
ingly very little we can do about it. How do
we handle these countries?"
Much of the discussion focused specifi
cally on Iran. The country has a nuclear
development program in place but states
that its uranium enrichment facilities are
intended only to provide nuclear energy to
