## Former Secretary of State George Shultz calls for 'hard-boiled democracy' toward Iran 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
"Not since Britain burned down the White House...has our national security

been so directly threatened as it is now, by the existence of nuclear weapons."

RONALD REAGAN's words, spoken by GEORGE SHULTZ, former U.S. Secretary of State

former Secretary of Defense William Perry
and former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn for sev
eral years to encourage international gov
ernments to reduce and eventually elimi
nate their nuclear arsenals.
Shultz explained the motivation for his
efforts by sharing an anecdote that took
place during his years as Secretary of State
under President Reagan.
"In one of our private one-on-one meet
ings one evening, [Reagan] said, 'Not since
Britain burned down the White House in
1814 has our national security been so
directly threatened as it is now, by the exis
tence of nuclear weapons,"' Shultz said. "We
decided if we could just get rid of them, the
world would be a much safer place,"
Prof. Drell spoke at length about the

In front of a packed audience in
Tresidder Memorial Union yesterday, for
mer U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
and renowned physicist Sidney Drell spoke
about the dangers of nuclear proliferation
and their joint efforts to rid the world of
nuclear weapons.
The event was organized by Stanford's
Center for International Security and
Cooperation (CISAC) and moderated by
Phil Taubman '7l, former Daily editor in
chief and Washington bureau chief of The
New York Times.
Shultz and Drell have been working with
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,

international landscape of current nuclear
proliferation policy, emphasizing the
urgency of the need to fight the spread of
nuclear weapons.
"One huge difference between the Cold
War days and today is that there are no
longer just the two superpowers, but rather,
we are in a world where many more coun
tries possess the know-how to create
nuclear weaponry," Drell said. "We are see
ing that with North Korea and Iran. What
we end up with is an extremely unstable sit
uation that we should not be comfortable
with going forward."
One of the most prominent themes that
ran throughout the two men's commentary
was the necessity and difficulty of
coming up with specific tenable strategies to

prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
"It is all fine and well to say that you want
to rid the world of nukes, but how do you do
it?" Shultz asked. "In a sense, the battle of
rhetoric has been won ... almost everyone
agrees that getting rid of nuclear weapons is
a good thing. But now the battle of action is
in front of you ... North Korea has nuclear
weapons, Iran wants them and there is seem
ingly very little we can do about it. How do
we handle these countries?"
Much of the discussion focused specifi
cally on Iran. The country has a nuclear
development program in place but states
that its uranium enrichment facilities are
intended only to provide nuclear energy to

Speaking on the elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide, former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz (middle), physicist Sidney Drell (right) and moderator Phil Taubman

civilians. Because of this, the Iranian
government has resisted internation
al pressure to shut down these facili
ties.
Shultz addressed this issue in an
interview with The Daily.
"Anyone who thinks Iran is en
riching uranium for energy purposes
needs to have their head checked,"
Shultz said. "Why would a country
with all the oil in the world need a nu
clear power plant? They are clearly
trying to achieve nuclear power, and
the time has come for them to be
stopped."
Tlie former Secretary of State
called for "hard-boiled diplomacy" in
America's policies toward Iran, call
ing the country an "illegitimate state"
under the current administration. He
even suggested that naval officers
should have the authority to attack
Iranians who approach American
ships in the Persian Gulf.
Shultz also expressed skepticism
at the alternative of allowing nations
to maintain nuclear weaponry and
rely on deterrence and mutually as
sured destruction to preserve world
peace, as during the Cold War.
"As more and more countries
have nuclear weapons, and more
people know how to make them,

there's more fissile material lying
around," Shultz said in response to a
question from the audience. "Parties
might get hold of nuclear weapons
who simply are not deterrable
who want to use them."
Drell spoke positively of the poli
cies and attitudes of the Obama ad
ministration on the question of inter
national nuclear policy. He stressed
that the issue was a non-partisan one,
transcending political parties and af
fecting all humans equally. He also,
however, dwelled on challenges that
lay ahead for the current administra
tion and called for more specific ob
jectives and policy aims from the
president.
"The challenge that the adminis
tration faces is articulating a policy
that makes clear what we want to do,
what we don't want to do and what
kind of steps we want to take to get
there," Drell said. "Be it specific
kinds of reductions, comprehensive
test bans, controlling the nuclear fuel
cycle or what have you, step by step
we need to create a new culture
where these things are clarified and
prioritized."
Over a storied career, Shultz has
served as professor of economics at
MIT and University of Chicago, Sec
retary of the Treasury under Presi
dent Nixon, president of Bechtel
Corporation and Secretary of State
under President Reagan. He is cur
rently a distinguished fellow at Stan
ford's Hoover Institution.

Drell is a professor emeritus at the
SLAC National Accelerator Labora
tory and a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution. He is a noted the
oretical physicist and has won nu
merous awards in recognition of his
achievements, including the presti
gious Enrico Fermi award.
The audience seemed generally
stimulated by the talk and wowed by
the speakers' combined experience
in the field.
"The fact that Mr. Shultz was
there in the highest reaches of Amer
ican government throughout the
Cold War, in the conference rooms
and on the phone with presidents lit
erally shaping American nuclear pol
icy, lends so much credibility to his
opinions on the matter and makes it
fascinating to hear what he has to
say," said Kelsey King 'll, a compar
ative studies in race and ethnicity
(CSRE) major.
Others, however, had reserva
tions.
"Of course, it was fascinating to
hear what two figures who have had
decades of experience in the area of
nuclear proliferation had to say," said
Stephanie Majerowicz TO, a political
science major. "Nevertheless, I left
the talk feeling the speakers had not
really made any concrete suggestions
in terms of how to achieve their oft
mentioned goal of disarmament."
