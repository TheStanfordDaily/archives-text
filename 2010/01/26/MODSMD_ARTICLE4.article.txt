## Four car burglaries reported on weekend 
### Samantha McGirr contributed to this report 
The Stanford Police Department reported a total
of four car burglaries this weekend. The incidents
were suspected to have occurred late Saturday
evening or early Sunday morning.
Of the four cars, three were parked side by side in
the Lagunita Parking Lot and one vehicle was in the
Wilbur Parking Lot. In light of the unusually high
number of break-ins for a single weekend. Bill
Larson, spokesperson for the Department of Public
Safety, advised students to take extra precautions with
their vehicles.
"Never leave your valuables in your car in plain
view," he said. "Burglars like to do window shopping
before selecting a vehicle."
Among the valuables taken were two GPS units, an
item Larson said is becoming an increasingly popular
target for car thieves.
"Now we're warning people not to leave a GPS
exposed in their vehicle, as two of the four cars bur
glarized had GPS systems in them," he said.
Among the other items taken were an iPod, a back
pack and several articles of clothing.
According to the Stanford Police Department,
there are usually about two car burglaries per week
end. Officials are unsure if the incidents in Wilbur and
Lagunita were related.
