The Office of Undergraduate
Admission received more than 32,000
applications to the Class of 2014,
trumping last year's school record of
30,428.
With a larger pool of applicants
and the same target class size of
1,675, a record-low seven percent of
applicants will be offered spots, said
Shawn Abbott, director of admis
sion. Stanford last year was the third
most selective American college or
university, behind Harvard and Yale,
each with seven percent admit rates.
In December, the University
accepted 753 of the 5,566 students
who applied early to the next fresh
man class; another 700 had their
admission decisions deferred until
this spring.
Stanford will also accept 20 trans
fer students in the spring, Abbott
added.
A final count of applications is not
yet available, the admission director
said, because approximately 100 stu

dents who submitted applications have
not paid their admission fee. Abbott
said "most of this group will very like
ly pay their fee," putting the overall
application count at a six percent

increase over last year's final count.
Regular applicants will be notified
of their admission decisions April 1,
and all applicants will have until May
1 to respond.
