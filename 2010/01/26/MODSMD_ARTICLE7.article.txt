## 490 ROSES Display in White Plaza commemorates 37-year anniversary of Roe v. Wade 
### JEN PITTMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two students managing a small table
in White Plaza on Monday look out
from their seats as bikes zoom past
them in the rain. Some students
approach the table, however, and
ask questions. That's when the two table man
agers hand out materials to the curious
leaflets explaining why a pro-life argument
does not depend upon religion.
Jan. 22 marked the 37-year anniversary of
Roe v. Wade, the ruling that legalized abor
tion in the United States. In remembrance of
the ruling, students from the pro-life group,
Stanford Students for Life, set up rows of
white stakes with roses to represent the

abortions that have occurred in the past 37
years.
"Each rose represents 100,000 legalized
abortions performed in this country since
1973. There are 490 roses in this memorial.
You do the math," reads one of the signs sur
rounding the rows of white stakes and roses in
White Plaza.
"We wanted to evoke a scene of Arlington
cemetery," said Charlie Capps 'lO about the
use of white stakes for the commemoration.
In past years crosses were used rather than
stakes. Last year, however, roses were pur
chased and the crosses were dismantled to
become stakes.
"People interpreted it as a religious sym
bol or thought [the stakes] were only com
memorating Christian babies," Capps
explained.

Students had varying reactions to the dis
play.
"I guess it is a nice gesture," said Sara
Rodriguez 'l3 as she stood in the roundabout
of White Plaza gazing at the display. "But I
feel slightly guilty even though I have nothing
to do with abortion."
"I guess it's an issue that feminists our age
get complacent about and I take it as a
reminder not to get complacent about it," said
Janani Balasubramanian 'l2, one of the cre
ators of the Feminist Collective on campus, as
she discussed the display. "There is a lot of
opposition out there [to being pro-choice]."
Stanford Students for Life members also
saw varying reactions to the display.
"Some were friendly, some inquisitive,
some [were] seeking discussion, some spit on
the memorial," Capps commented.
