# EITHER WAY YOU PUT IT?
## The
						re-wording of a famous national survey question revealed that Americans may be more concerned about issues like the environment than formerly believed 
### SUSANNA KIM 
What a difference a
phrase makes. Since
George Gallup
developed the ques
tion in the 19305,
Americans have answered the open
ended query, What do you think is
the most important problem facing
the country today? But Samuel
Larson 'll wondered if there was
biased wording in the famous
inquiry so he and a team of Stanford
researchers decided to recast the
question.
"I think the most important thing
we found is that we think that our
data show that the original 'most
important problem' question does
n't give a full picture of what
Americans care about," Larson said.
"It biases people away from the idea
that there's more than just America
and the problems of the future. We
think people do care about these
issues and issues that affect the
whole world."
Last year, Larson was working in
Professor Jon Krosnick's clinical
psychology research group with
Ph.D. student David Yeager when
he began to question the wording of
the question.
"I asked them about that, so we
decided to tear into the question
and tease out what was in the word
ing," said Larson, a current partici
pant in the "Stanford in
Washington" program.
They made four changes to the
question in time for the Associated
Press-Stanford poll conducted at the
end of November among 1,005
adults.
"First, we decided to change this
country to the world, and second, we
wanted to broaden the time horizon
so we included the future," Larson
said. "The third thing is when we
look at those questions, we're wor
ried about optimism bias."
Larson said that people may
believe that global warming will be a
big problem but they don't have to
deal with it because society will deal
with it.
And the last change, Larson said,
was using serious problem as
opposed to important because of the
ambiguity around its meaning.
The team ultimately decided on
the new wording: What do you think
will be the most serious problem fac
ing the world in the future if nothing
is done to stop it?
Krosnick asked the AP to include
both questions in the final survey
with over 70 other questions.
The results showed a significant
difference in the percentage of
responses. Roughly one percent of
respondents named the global
warming category in answering the
traditionally worded question. The
most common responses were the
economy (36 percent), unemploy
ment (14 percent), health care (13
percent), government (6 percent)
and war (5 percent).

Gallup published similar results
on November 16 of last year. It
found 31 percent of respondents
cited the economy as the most press
ing issue, compared to the previous
month's 26 percent.
But in the re-worded question for
the AP-Stanford poll, the percent
age that named global warming
increased to nearly 12 percent, the
second most common response after
the economy (16 percent).
"My belief that is there is no
meaningful decline in public con
cern about this issue and there have
been inadequate survey questions,"
Krosnick said about the research
results.
Krosnick and Larson are inter
ested in exploring the possibility
that the rewording of this question
can affect the results of other sur
veys that try to capture "national
mood." Krosnick especially recog
nizes Larson and the research
team.
"Ten undergrads work in my lab
every year and those students are a
terrific group," Krosnick said. "And
every so often people end up doing
remarkable work. I'm terrifically
proud of the work that Sam did and
it did take the whole team a lot of
work. I think it's a wonderful thing
for Stanford to be proud of."
In addition to the new academic

findings of the revised survey ques
tion, there are also political implica
tions for a change in survey results.
"I think interest in the environ
ment relates to the political feasibil
ity for climate change legislation
passing this year," said Ishan Nath
'l2, president of Stanford's chapter
of the environmental college net
work, IDEAS.
Nath said that climate change is a
hot-button issue among Stanford
students as a whole, but he believes
there is only a vocal minority. To
help foster dialogue on climate
change, Nath and IDEAS are part
nering with the Stanford Political
Union to host a student debate on
climate change policy on Feb. 9. The
event will also feature Stanford cli

matologist Steve Schneider and pro
fessor of environmental and
resource economics Larry Goulder.
"We hope student questions will
be a significant part of the event,"
Nath said. "I can't speak for other
universities, but at Stanford there's a
significant core of students dedicat
ed to environmental causes."
Theo Gibbs 'll, co-president of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford,
added that concerned students may
not be visibly engaged in discussion
surrounding the environment.
"In terms of activism in general
on campus, most people would
agree that Stanford isn't an activist

campus," Gibbs said. "Students
choose other methods of engage
ment. That may be a generational
difference. We don't view marching
on the streets as an effective form. I
think there's more of a business
like model in terms of solving
issues. We have to consider the eco
nomics and long term viability of
these issues."
When asked about his reaction to
the public response to the AP-
Stanford survey results, Professor
Krosnick expressed concern with
the interpretation of the numbers.
"I am disappointed in the press in
general's coverage of public opinion

recently," he said. "The science does
not suggest public drop-off in con
cern of climate change and yet the
media coverage has suggested that
the public is less concerned."
Nath said that there is a ticking
time bomb on climate change legis
lation, and if it's going to happen, it's
going to be now or never.
"It needs to happen when there's
a Democratic majority and if it
doesn't happen this year, then it
might not happen," Nath said. "I
think this poll is really about that."
