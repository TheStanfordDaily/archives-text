## EDITORIAL Coupa fails to deliver after pushing out MoonBean's 
### 
This time last year, students would have
been sipping on warm espressos, nib
bling cookies and reading at tables next
to Green Library. Currently, however, the
empty building that was once Moonßean's
Coffee is a locked-up eyesore, almost as
dreary as the threatening grey winter sky
above it. Almost a year ago, the Editorial
Board came out on Moonßean's behalf, ar
guing that the University was wrong to push
out the longtime campus cafe in favor of a
Coupa kiosk. But whether or not it was right
for Moonßean's to be pushed out and re
placed, the Board believes Coupa's ongoing
failure to do something with the site amounts
to rubbing salt in a wound.
First, the Coupa kiosk was set to open in
the summer, then the fall and now March 3 at
the earliest. In the meantime, the entire west
campus remains bereft of a nearby source of
quality coffee. Furthermore, Moonßean's
was a center of west campus activity, as its lo
cation by Green and Meyer Libraries made it
the perfect place for students to meet and
study. Now Moonßean's is gone, with only its
empty kiosk to serve as a dreary reminder of
its service to the Stanford community.
The University and Coupa have offered
explanations for the delay in getting the new
cafe up and running. Problems have arisen in
the construction and acquirement of permits.
Meanwhile, the basic function of providing
the student body with coffee seems to have
been lost in the shuffle. While the full hot
menu that Coupa promises would be a treat,
it was clear that Moonßean's made its clients

happy with the basic smattering of baked
goods, coffee drinks and blended beverages.
The continued absence of any replacement
for Moonßean's has truly robbed students of
a precious resource and a traditional space at
Stanford. Coupa's inability to provide any
clear sense of progress or renovation of the
building has disheartened students, and has
only made the original removal of Moon-
Bean's all the more questionable.
Coupa is also losing in this prolonged
opening. Not only has revenue been non-ex
istent from the empty space, but the continu
al disappointment of the student body will
only cement the hard feelings expressed
when Moonßean's was squeezed out last
spring. Moonßean's was a part of a Stanford
tradition of unique, non-corporate centers
for student dining and community. Coupa
may not exactly be Starbucks, but the bu
reaucratic nightmare that now entangles it
does nothing to combat its image as the cor
porate coffee factory that bumped off the
quaint local cafe. If Coupa ever hopes to at
tract a fraction of the loyalty that Moon-
Bean's once had, it is going to have to get its
act together, and soon.
The Editorial Board believes a coffee de
layed is a coffee denied.The once proud cam
pus hub of conversation and coffee is now an
empty blot on the landscape outside of
Green. The longer Coupa continues to pro
long the absence of coffee and community on
the west side of campus, the longer students
will remember and long for the original cafe,
Moonßean's, that was pushed out.
