## Forbes: Farm grads most satisfied 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business ranked first among business
schools nationwide in post-gradua
tion satisfaction among alumni,
according to a recent survey by
Forbes. University of Pennsylvania's
Wharton School and the University
of Chicago's Booth School rounded
out the top three.
Of the MBA class of 2004,17,000
graduates from 103 of the premier
business schools in the country took
part in the survey, which asked par
ticipants about satisfaction with
their current jobs, their MBA edu
cation and how well their business
school prepared them for the job
market.
Five of the schools ranked in the
Forbes satisfaction survey also show
up in the overall top ten of the Forbes
best business schools ranking.
Stanford was also the top-ranked
business school program in the cate
gory of returns on graduates' invest
ments. Students had a median salary
of $82,000 before entering the GSB

and a median salary five years after
graduation of $225,000, highest
among all U.S. business schools.
Two GSB alumni who remain
associated with the school attributed
the ranking to what they saw as sev
eral unique aspects of the school's
character.
"[Stanford's] GSB's size and cul
ture are unique competitive advan
tages that meaningfully contribute to
alumni satisfaction," said Pulin
Sanghvi, who graduated from the
GSB in 1997 and now serves as its
director of career management.
"The school creates a tight-knit
community with strong ties between
students, faculty and alumni," he said,
adding that the small student body
size roughly half that of other top
schools allowed students to inter
act closely with faculty and "get to
know all their classmates by gradua
tion."
Jennifer Aaker, who teaches mar
keting at the GSB and graduated
from the school in 1995, said the
experience at the school benefited
from the mentality of its student
body.

"Stanford brings together a group
of people that are in general more
idealistic and more effect-driven,"
Aaker said.
Current students seemed equally
satisfied with the GSB experience.
"The atmosphere is great," said
Nadya Malenko, who is currently a
Ph.D. student in finance at Stanford
and frequently takes classes at the
GSB. "The faculty members are very
responsive to students and are
always willing to help, and it is a
pleasure to attend their seminars."
The school's diversity, Sanghvi
said, was also a strength, with a third
of the student body composed of
international students, representing
more than 50 countries.
"My own class included managers,
consultants and entrepreneurs, but it
also included an Olympic swimmer
and a shrimp farmer from Ecuador,"
Sanghvi said.
"Students spend two years at the
GSB believing that anything is possi
ble in their careers," Sanghvi added.
