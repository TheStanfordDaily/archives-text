## GET IT RIGHT I Do Love the First Amendment 
### Erica Morgan 
Will history remember Jan. 21, 2010
as the day that democracy per
ished? You might be inclined to
think so, given the turbulent liberal reaction
to the Supreme Court ruling last Thursday.
A close vote (5-4) overruled prior limits on
political campaign spending by corporations
and labor unions. The decision of Citizens
United v. Federal Election Commission over
turned two legal precedents of government
restrictions and lifted constraints on corpo
rate investment in political broadcasts.
The current upheaval stems from the cre
ation of the film "Hilary: The Movie" by the
nonprofit organization Citizens United. The
film was banned on the premise that it
served no purpose but to damage the repu
tation of Clinton. The Bipartisan Campaign
Reform Act of 2002 forbade the use of inde
pendent expenditures by corporations to
support or discredit a candidate. "Hilary:
The Movie," it seems, violated this regula
tion. Loathe though I am to admit that I
would waste any moment of my life giving
the benefit of thought to Hilary Clinton, I
confess that I have ordered the movie and
will be watching it upon arrival I am hop
ing it will lend further insight into the cur
rent hoopla. Citizens United claims that the
film is a fact-based documentary. I suppose
that remains to be seen, but I think the point
is irrelevant. Pretend, for the moment, that
the film is the most inflammatory, unfound
ed reel of political bombast ever created.
Does the government have the right to pre
vent its release? There are obviously some
who think so: our president and four
Supreme Court justices, to name just a few.
Obama cannot think of "anything more
devastating to the public interest" than this
ruling. Truly a man of the people, Obama is
devastated at the thought of the malignant,
all-powerful corporations utilizing their
filthy profits to sway public opinion come
election time. He cannot allow corporate
money to corrupt the voice of the people in
true democracy. He promises to "fight for
the American people" and "repair the dam
age." What I want to know is this: if Obama
is so opposed to the political influence
wielded by affluent corporations, why did he
accept such generous campaign contribu
tions from individuals who work at compa
nies such as Goldman Sachs, Microsoft Corp
and JP Morgan? The question is rhetorical:
we should not be surprised, considering
Obama's track record of blatant hypocrisy.
The president sees this ruling as problemat
ic because it poses threats to his political

agenda. As Yahoo! News observes, "... the
decision will make it harder to enact finan
cial reforms, close tax loopholes, promote
energy independence and protect patients
from insurance company abuses." Obama is
not concerned with preserving democracy
and protecting the voices of his constituents.
True protection comes in the form of the
First Amendment, which thankfully was
reinforced with this ruling last week. Justice
Kennedy wrote, "When government seeks
to use its full power, including the criminal
law, to command where a person may get his
or her information or what distrusted source
he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to
control thought... The First Amendment
confirms the freedom to think for our
selves." Many are blustering over the treat
ment of a corporation as an individual being
extended First Amendment rights. What of
media corporations? If the government can
dictate the content of political commentary
of Citizens United, why can it not dictate
that of newspapers, TV programs and
books? Oh, wait! Deputy Solicitor General
Malcolm Stewart (representative of the
Federal Election Commission) suggested
that the government should have the power
to ban books funded by unions and corpora
tions based on political content.
While the naysayers flail their limbs in
despair and offer lip service to democracy's
eulogy, I am quite contentedly exercising my
right of free speech.

Join me for a viewing of "Hilary: the Movie"?
