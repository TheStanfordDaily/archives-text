## ON THEIR MARKS Card finds good scores in N.M. 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
A weekend in Albuquerque proved successful
for some Stanford sprinters and field event athletes
as they gained some provisional standards and top
marks. Competing at the Cherry and Silver Classic,
the Cardinal athletes had some top performances,
marking a great beginning to the season.
"We had a great meet overall in that one of the
main goals for our team is to qualify as many peo
ple as possible for nationals," said senior Ryan Fisi
caro.
Leading the way for the women was sopho
more Katerina Stef anidi, who won the meet title in
the pole vault with a mark of 13-7 1/4, just short of
her collegiate best, which was set last week at the
University of Washington. Also in the field events,
senior Griffin Matthew and junior Arantxa King
achieved provisional standards in the long jump
with leaps of 20-1 1/2 and 20-7 1/4 respectively.
King finished in second place, with Matthew fol
lowing in third place. An NCAA provisional stan
dard is somewhat of a wild card situation for the
athlete, meaning that he or she receives a berth to
compete at nationals depending on how many
people get automatic qualifying standards.
Although she achieved the provisional mark,
King was still a little disappointed with her per
formance.
"Out of four jumps, I only really recorded one,"
she said. "I try to set goals for each meet and I was
really determined to start off on a great foot; with
that being said, I fouled some really great jumps so
I know that it will come."
Matthew had another provisional standard in
the 200 meters with a time of 23.80. Her time was
third fastest in Stanford history. Matthew agreed
with King's sentiments saying, "Hitting two provi
sional marks felt great, but my goal is to hit the au

tomatic marks in the 200 meters and long jump."
Also faring well in the sprints was freshman
Carissa Levingston, who placed 6th in the 60 me
ters with a time of 7.59 seconds, seventh all-time
fastest time at Stanford a notable achievement
for a freshman.
On the men's side, Stanford was led by the
young talent of freshman Jules Sharpe, who won
the high jump with a provisional standard height of
7-1 the third best mark in Stanford indoor his
tory.
"With Arantxa, Griffin and Jules Sharpe all
reaching provisional standards over the weekend,
we are definitely making progress towards achiev
ing our collective team goals," Fisicaro asserted.
Sophomore Geoffrey Tabor and senior Carter
Wells also fared well in the field events. Tabor
placed third in the shot put with a mark of 55-3 3/4,
and Wells finished in fourth place in the weight
throw with a distance of 57-9 3/4.
Consistently doing well in the sprints was sen
ior Tyrone McGraw, who placed third in the 60 me
ters with a time of 6.82 seconds. With this time, Mc-
Graw tied the Stanford record set last year by Fisi
caro.
Also running a personal best at the meet was
senior Danny Belch, who ran a 21.79 in the 200 me
ters.
"I was very happy with the performances by Ty
rone in the 60 meter dash and by Danny Belch in
200 meter dash," Fisicaro said. "They both set per
sonal records and that bodes well for the rest of the
indoor season as well as the outdoor season, espe
cially for the 4xloo meter relay."
Next up for the Stanford track and field team
are two upcoming meets, one in Seattle and one at
Texas A&M.
