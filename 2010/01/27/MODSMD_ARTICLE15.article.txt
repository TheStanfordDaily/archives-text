# Natural born killer
## Romero now a record-breaking star despite late start in the sport 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The people that we call Stan
ford Division I athletes generally
have one thing in common:
they've all been playing their
sport for most of their lives. They
didn't just pick it up and somehow
become amazingly talented in the
sport. But then there's Evan
Romero.
While most of his teammates
come from volleyball families
where they were given volleyballs
as soon as they could run around,
Romero's career started a little
later. His sophomore year of high
school, his basketball coach, also
the volleyball coach, approached
him about playing on the team.
Romero said yes.
"I liked playing volleyball; it
was fun.That's where I started off,"
Romero said. "I learned how to hit
and pass somewhat. From there, I
kind of blossomed a little bit."
Playing with his high school
team highlighted a slightly differ
ent chapter in his volleyball ca
reer while he still plays with a
different set of his closest friends,
the Taco Bell runs and hang out
sessions are memories from the
beginning of his career.
"We had some upset wins and
it was just fun hanging out with
the guys all the time. It was a good
time playing with them," Romero
said.
After a few phone calls to
coach John Kosty, Romero be
came Stanford-bound, with more
nerves than any of his teammates.
"I was most afraid that I had
nowhere near the level of experi
ence that everyone on the team
had," Romero said. "I was hoping
that I'd be able to learn quickly
and be able to contribute to the
team."
"I had some growing pains def
initely. I didn't exactly play too
well my first two years, but the
coaches have been phenomenal.
They've been really supportive
and they've taught me a lot in a
short amount of time."
Among the many skills and
techniques he has picked up while
playing here, Romero learned
that sometimes, brain does beat
brawn.
"When you get comfortable
with the game, and in my case, you
learn you don't have to hit as hard
as you can every time," Romero

said. "You have to hit some smart
shots. I learned from my team
mates like Spencer [McLachlin],
who always does that."
While experience is the biggest
skill he has acquired over the
years, his teammates including
Ed Howell, Jason Palacios, Gar
rett Werner and Kawika Shoji
have all helped him with tech
nique.
This experience and technique

led Romero to break the school
record for career kills with 1,295
last year. Moreover, he has been
the leader in kills on the team for
the past three years as well. How
ever, this offensive powerhouse
radiates humility when asked
about his leading numbers.

Senior Evan Romero only started playing volleyball during his
sophomore year of high school, but has already become the school's
career leader in total kills with almost another full season to go.
