# Where did the NFL upsets go?

Widespread, team non
specific excitement in
sports is predicated on
the idea that at some
point, the unexpected will happen.
And yet, in the professional
leagues, normalcy has been, well, the
norm. Look at the recent champions.
Basketball? Kobe and the Lakers
were widely believed to be the
creme de la creme of the NBA. They
won. Baseball? After C.C. Sabathia,
A.J. Burnett and Mark Teixeira
inked massive deals, the Yankees
were proclaimed the favorites. The
Bronx Bombers then proceeded to
bring home their 27th champi
onship. Hockey? Couldn't care less
about the NHL, but a quick look
back at ESPN's 2008-2009 season
preview had the Penguins and Red
Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals.
Want to guess what the ultimate
match up was?
Taking a broad view overlooks
the intricacies of the season, but in
the end, what was supposed to hap
pen, happened.
But football has always been dif
ferent from its counterparts. Look at
its playoff format. There are no five
or seven-game series, where, even if
feisty insurgents have their day (or
two), the pecking order will remain
fairly intact. Instead, in one 60-
minute contest, even when one side
is favored, all bets are off one in
jury, bad throw, bobbled snap or
missed tackle can be the difference
between victory and defeat. The
time to regroup is perilously small.
This is true, too, in other sports with
single-game, single-elimination style
look no further than March Mad
ness, which earns its moniker each
season. But the NFL is the only
major professional league to employ
such a method and the results show.
Since the 2001 playoffs, a No. 1
seed has won the Lombardi Trophy
exactly once, while a wildcard team
has won the championship twice.
The universally expected is by no
means a guarantee (see: 2007-2008
New England Patriots) and teams
that make the postseason as the last
seed in their conference (see: 2005-
2006 Pittsburgh Steelers) have a le
gitimate chance to win it all. Con
trast that with the Golden State War
