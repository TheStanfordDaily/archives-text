# Where did the NFL upsets go?
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Widespread, team non
specific excitement in
sports is predicated on
the idea that at some
point, the unexpected will happen.
And yet, in the professional
leagues, normalcy has been, well, the
norm. Look at the recent champions.
Basketball? Kobe and the Lakers
were widely believed to be the
creme de la creme of the NBA. They
won. Baseball? After C.C. Sabathia,
A.J. Burnett and Mark Teixeira
inked massive deals, the Yankees
were proclaimed the favorites. The
Bronx Bombers then proceeded to
bring home their 27th champi
onship. Hockey? Couldn't care less
about the NHL, but a quick look
back at ESPN's 2008-2009 season
preview had the Penguins and Red
Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals.
Want to guess what the ultimate
match up was?
Taking a broad view overlooks
the intricacies of the season, but in
the end, what was supposed to hap
pen, happened.
But football has always been dif
ferent from its counterparts. Look at
its playoff format. There are no five
or seven-game series, where, even if
feisty insurgents have their day (or
two), the pecking order will remain
fairly intact. Instead, in one 60-
minute contest, even when one side
is favored, all bets are off one in
jury, bad throw, bobbled snap or
missed tackle can be the difference
between victory and defeat. The
time to regroup is perilously small.
This is true, too, in other sports with
single-game, single-elimination style
look no further than March Mad
ness, which earns its moniker each
season. But the NFL is the only
major professional league to employ
such a method and the results show.
Since the 2001 playoffs, a No. 1
seed has won the Lombardi Trophy
exactly once, while a wildcard team
has won the championship twice.
The universally expected is by no
means a guarantee (see: 2007-2008
New England Patriots) and teams
that make the postseason as the last
seed in their conference (see: 2005-
2006 Pittsburgh Steelers) have a le
gitimate chance to win it all. Con
trast that with the Golden State War

riors, for instance, who pulled off one
of the greatest all-time upsets by
beating the No. 1 Dallas Mavericks
in the first round of the 2007 NBA
playoffs, only to then lose 4-1 in the
Western semifinals there is only
so far a significant underdog can go
in a series format, whereas in the
NFL, all that team would need is a
few games to prove their mettle.
And it's not just the playoffs. A
basic rule of statistics: the greater the
size of a dataset, the better the
chance that the average of your
dataset will be closer to the expected
mean. Which is to say that it's easier
to predict an outcome over the
MLB's 162-game season, or the
NBA or NHL's 82-game season,
where the results should eventually
revert to the norm, than it is in the
NFL's 16-game season, where so

much fluctuates from week to week.
The Tennessee Titans, for instance,
began the year 0-6 and nearly made
the playoffs; could the Kansas City
Royals start 0-61 and do the same?
Of course not.
Which brings us to Super Bowl
XLIV.
The last time two No. 1 seeds
made it to the championship game,
Tonya Harding and Nanci Kerrigan
ruled the sports world and "O.J.
Simpson" and "murder" had yet to
be made synonymous. In emerging
as their respective conference's
champion, the New Orleans Saints
and Indianapolis Colts are the first
pair of top seeds to make it to the
Super Bowl since 1994. From early in
the year, both were the seemingly
sensible, if not predictable choices
for Super Bowl berths, but for that
reason alone, it is odd that it came to
pass.
In Sports Illustrated's season pre
view, the Saints made the playoffs on
eight of nine ballots; the Colts, on
seven of nine. Indianapolis took over

the top spot in ESPN's power rank
ings in week four; New Orleans es
tablished itself as the team to beat in
the NFC in week six. Both franchises
carried undefeated seasons late into
the year.
When the playoffs came about, it
was largely business as usual for
everyone involved. Three of the top
four seeds made it to the AFC/NFC
Championship games the New
York Jets were the lone underdog
tale. And at the end, just the two
teams that had dominated the NFL
for much of the season remained.
The storylines, particularly on the
New Orleans side, are numerous, but
in an unexpected twist, one of the
more surprising narratives is that, for
the first time in over a decade, the
NFL has achieved a sense of equilib
rium.
