## Cardinal readies for team season 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Preparation is the key to success in
all sports and the No. 13 Stanford
women's tennis team has been prepar
ing a long time for the start of dual
match play next week. The team hosts
UC-Davis (0-1) at home before flying to
the Lone Star State to take on both
Texas Christian University (0-0) and the
University of Texas (1-0).
A home opener for a sporting season
is always thrilling, but especially so for
the women's tennis players at Stanford.
The team comes in riding a home win
ning streak of 151 matches at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, recognized as
the longest active home winning streak
of any intercollegiate sport in NCAA
Division I history. With their first dual
match of the season coming up against
UC-Davis, the players will put this

Barte. "When we went over for the
men's match on Saturday, I realized I

The success that individual Cardinal

players have had up until now matters lit

the road at Texas has been in the minds of
the women as their first real test of the
season, something they can all prepare
for.
"We've been looking forward to
playing at their place for a while," said
senior captain Lindsay Burdette about
the Texas teams. "They came to us a cou
ple years ago, and we beat them pretty
good here, but they've both improved
since then."
"It'll be a great opportunity to match
up against some teams that we don't
normally play, and I expect all the best.
It'll be a boost for our ranking and just
our confidence in general."
Part of the preparation that the team
has put in during the fall season came in
helping the freshmen become acquaint
ed with Division I competition. With
three freshmen players Stacey Tan,
Mallory Burdette and Natalie Dillon
all potentially playing in the lineup,
