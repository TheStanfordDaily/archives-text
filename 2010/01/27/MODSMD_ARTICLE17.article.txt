## Cardinal readies for team season 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Preparation is the key to success in
all sports and the No. 13 Stanford
women's tennis team has been prepar
ing a long time for the start of dual
match play next week. The team hosts
UC-Davis (0-1) at home before flying to
the Lone Star State to take on both
Texas Christian University (0-0) and the
University of Texas (1-0).
A home opener for a sporting season
is always thrilling, but especially so for
the women's tennis players at Stanford.
The team comes in riding a home win
ning streak of 151 matches at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, recognized as
the longest active home winning streak
of any intercollegiate sport in NCAA
Division I history. With their first dual
match of the season coming up against
UC-Davis, the players will put this
streak on the line.
"I'm so excited," said junior Hilary
Barte. "When we went over for the
men's match on Saturday, I realized I
missed the feeling of match day and just
getting ready for it. Being at home is
even more special."
The success that individual Cardinal

players have had up until now matters lit
tle once the team play begins. Matches
now begin to count towards team rank
ings and entrance in the NCAA tourna
ment in May, and those who have strug
gled can start anew.This first weekend on
the road at Texas has been in the minds of
the women as their first real test of the
season, something they can all prepare
for.
"We've been looking forward to
playing at their place for a while," said
senior captain Lindsay Burdette about
the Texas teams. "They came to us a cou
ple years ago, and we beat them pretty
good here, but they've both improved
since then."
"It'll be a great opportunity to match
up against some teams that we don't
normally play, and I expect all the best.
It'll be a boost for our ranking and just
our confidence in general."
Part of the preparation that the team
has put in during the fall season came in
helping the freshmen become acquaint
ed with Division I competition. With
three freshmen players Stacey Tan,
Mallory Burdette and Natalie Dillon
all potentially playing in the lineup,
their contributions will need to
come early and often. Fortunately
for the Cardinal, they've all shined
during their tournament play.
"I think it's not an issue at all,"
Barte said. "They've done a great job
learning the ropes, asking us ques
tions where there have been ques
tions.
"Mallory, having been the third
Burdette sister to come through
here, has done a great job of leading
her class," she continued. "This year
is probably my favorite dynamic on
the team since I've been at Stan
ford."
"We're all just super excited for
the season to start," Burdette said.
"The fact that we have this trip com
ing up is focusing everyone in prac
tice on a daily basis. It's definitely a
big part of our schedule this quarter,
and that's only helping everyone
over this next week and a half."
The UC-Davis match will take
place February 2 at 2:30 p.m. at
Taube.
