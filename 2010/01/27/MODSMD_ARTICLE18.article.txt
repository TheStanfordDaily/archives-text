At the beginning of the season,
CBS Sports predicted, "Stan
ford fans will suffer through
another tough campaign, no
question." Doc Sports announced, "This
is going to be a long, long year for coach
John Dawkins ... it's going to get real
ugly, real fast around Palo Alto."
Bleacher Report was the most opti

afraid to pull the trigger from deep be
hind the arc, the Texas native is averag
ing 17.5 points per game and lit up the
UCLA defense for a career-high 30.

Most Improved Player: Forward Jack
Trotter. There were moments last sea
son where Trotter looked like a boy
among men on the court. Not this year.
Averaging nearly seven points in just
over 24 minutes, the 6'9" Trotter has
been a steady presence to a revolving
front-court for the Cardinal. Still only
220 pounds, Trotter could be a wrecking
force down low if he adds a few more
pounds to his frame.

An honorable mention to The Sixth
Man committee. After a disastrous sea-
