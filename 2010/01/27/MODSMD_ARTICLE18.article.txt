# My mid-season bball awards

### Mike Lazarus 
At the beginning of the season,
CBS Sports predicted, "Stan
ford fans will suffer through
another tough campaign, no
question." Doc Sports announced, "This
is going to be a long, long year for coach
John Dawkins ... it's going to get real
ugly, real fast around Palo Alto."
Bleacher Report was the most opti
mistic for Stanford basketball, back
handedly complimenting the Cardinal
with this gem: "Are they the worst team
in the Pac-10? No, but someone has to
finish last. Coach Johnny Dawkins has a
long way to go with this program."
To every basketball pundit's sur
prise, Stanford men's basketball has not
self-imploded into an amorphous blob
of five players chucking a ball toward a
hoop. Who knew? The kids can actually
play.
To celebrate the Cardinal's delight
ful mediocrity (10-9, 4-3 Pac-10), let's
hand out some midseason awards.

Most Valuable Player: Toss up between
forward Landry Fields and guard Jere
my Green. Coming into the year, Fields

was the clear-cut favorite. As the only
returning starter and proven scorer on
the roster, Dawkins was expecting a
Herculean effort from Fields game in
and game out for Stanford to be com
petitive. But the sharp-shooting Green
has been a revelation of sorts. Never
afraid to pull the trigger from deep be
hind the arc, the Texas native is averag
ing 17.5 points per game and lit up the
UCLA defense for a career-high 30.

Most Improved Player: Forward Jack
Trotter. There were moments last sea
son where Trotter looked like a boy
among men on the court. Not this year.
Averaging nearly seven points in just
over 24 minutes, the 6'9" Trotter has
been a steady presence to a revolving
front-court for the Cardinal. Still only
220 pounds, Trotter could be a wrecking
force down low if he adds a few more
pounds to his frame.

An honorable mention to The Sixth
Man committee. After a disastrous sea-
son last year that saw record-low
membership, the committee re
sponded with a price cut and an in
centive based system to encourage
people to attend games. While the
turnout hasn't been great (more on
that later), it would be scary to imag
ine the results without the proactive
moves of the committee.

Fan Favorite: Without question, for
ward Matei Daian. Seriously, have
you ever seen a crowd go as crazy
over a routine lay-up, as Maples
Pavilion does on every Daian
score? Is it the fact that he's from
Romania? Is it that he often looks a
little, umm, lost on the court? Or is
it that no one on the team has the
heart to tell him to pull his shorts
below his belly button? Whatever
the reason is, Stanford fans will be
treated to two more years of the
happy-go-lucky Daian.

Most Welcome Addition: Forward
Andrew Zimmermann. It wasn't
much of a competition for Zimmer
mann as the two other newcomers,
freshmen Gabriel Harris (8.9 min-

utes per game) and Andy Brown (0,
torn ACL), have seen limited action.
Still, the Santa Clara transfer has im
pressed teammates and fans alike.
Before going down with an injury
earlier this month, Zimmermann
was a vocal, energetic leader on the
court. Zimmermann played every
minute like it was overtime in the
NCAA Championship, diving for
every loose ball and always being the
first to congratulate a teammate.

Best Halftime Show: The Shaolin
Monks. Lying parallel to the ground
being supported by nothing but four
sharp stakes while shirtless? Enough
said.

Least Valuable Player: The Sixth
Man. I'm aware that Stanford is un
defeated at home in Pac-10 play. I
understand that has something to do
with fan noise. But seeing the stu
dent section three-quarters empty
five minutes before tip-off is dis
heartening. Stanford is one game out
of first place in the Pac-10. Finish up
your problem sets and go to the
Thursday night games. Start your
pre-gaming early and go to the Sat
urday twilight games.
