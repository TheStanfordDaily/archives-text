# Student groups push back on fees
## 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Financial officers of special fees groups are stirring.
They came out in relative force at last night's
ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting, where last
week senators enacted a bill disallowing student
groups from requesting an increase in special fees
beyond inflation without more stringent student body
approval.
On Tuesday, the bill faced challenges to both its
merits and the rules surrounding the vote that passed
it. Some student group leaders complained of short
notice to organize opposition to the bill, and said the
legislation would hinder their ability to collect special
fees money and provide programming to students.
But authors of the bill maintained that it is a nec
essary step to reducing the rate of students' requesting
refunds on their special fees, curbing spending out of
the ASSU buffer fund and promoting greater student
body engagement with the process of funding student
groups.
Matt McLaughlin 'OB, the ASSU financial manag
er, emphasized that this single piece of legislation is
unlikely to leverage large-scale positive change. "I
think that the special fees won't decrease," he said.
"Refund rates, we hope, will at least remain constant,
but there are a whole series of other reforms. This is by
no means the lynchpin."

Special Fees Bill Needs More Student Input, F.O. Says
Minh Dan Vuong 'll, the financial officer for

Alternative Spring Break, last night registered his dis
appointment and urged the Senate to reconsider its
decision, this time with more student input.
According to Vuong, the one week's notice that
financial officers received prior to the bill's passage
per the Senate's previous notice rales was not
enough for groups to mobilize a response.
Additionally, he claimed, the information session held
by the Appropriations Committee one day after the
bill passed was unacceptable and failed to consider
the voices of VSOs.
"This bill creates a bunch of unintended conse
quences," Vuong told the body. "Groups, for instance,
will have incentive to overstate their costs."
Stephanie Epps 'lO, former chair of the Senate
Appropriations Committee and current Black
Student Union (BSU) co-president, argued that the
new legislation opens a "Pandora's box" by discourag
ing moderation. In light of the legislation, Epps sug
gested that many student groups will be re-evaluating
their budgets and asking for more money from special
fees than they did previously.
"For the goal that you are trying to serve, it is doing
the exact opposite," Epps said. "You're not going to
offset the student activities fee at all. You're going to
increase it by a lot."
According to Senator Alex Katz 'l2,
Administration and Rules Committee chair, the bill
was created in the spirit of allowing students more fis-

bill remained intact.
