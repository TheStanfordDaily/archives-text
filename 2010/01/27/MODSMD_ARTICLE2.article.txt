# Student groups push back on fees
## 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Financial officers of special fees groups are stirring.
They came out in relative force at last night's
ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting, where last
week senators enacted a bill disallowing student
groups from requesting an increase in special fees
beyond inflation without more stringent student body
approval.
On Tuesday, the bill faced challenges to both its
merits and the rules surrounding the vote that passed
it. Some student group leaders complained of short
notice to organize opposition to the bill, and said the
legislation would hinder their ability to collect special
fees money and provide programming to students.
But authors of the bill maintained that it is a nec
essary step to reducing the rate of students' requesting
refunds on their special fees, curbing spending out of
the ASSU buffer fund and promoting greater student
body engagement with the process of funding student
groups.
Matt McLaughlin 'OB, the ASSU financial manag
er, emphasized that this single piece of legislation is
unlikely to leverage large-scale positive change. "I
think that the special fees won't decrease," he said.
"Refund rates, we hope, will at least remain constant,
but there are a whole series of other reforms. This is by
no means the lynchpin."

Special Fees Bill Needs More Student Input, F.O. Says
Minh Dan Vuong 'll, the financial officer for

Alternative Spring Break, last night registered his dis
appointment and urged the Senate to reconsider its
decision, this time with more student input.
According to Vuong, the one week's notice that
financial officers received prior to the bill's passage
per the Senate's previous notice rales was not
enough for groups to mobilize a response.
Additionally, he claimed, the information session held
by the Appropriations Committee one day after the
bill passed was unacceptable and failed to consider
the voices of VSOs.
"This bill creates a bunch of unintended conse
quences," Vuong told the body. "Groups, for instance,
will have incentive to overstate their costs."
Stephanie Epps 'lO, former chair of the Senate
Appropriations Committee and current Black
Student Union (BSU) co-president, argued that the
new legislation opens a "Pandora's box" by discourag
ing moderation. In light of the legislation, Epps sug
gested that many student groups will be re-evaluating
their budgets and asking for more money from special
fees than they did previously.
"For the goal that you are trying to serve, it is doing
the exact opposite," Epps said. "You're not going to
offset the student activities fee at all. You're going to
increase it by a lot."
According to Senator Alex Katz 'l2,
Administration and Rules Committee chair, the bill
was created in the spirit of allowing students more fis-

cal control to determine student
groups funding.
"Special fees now represents $2.5
million," Katz said, referring to the
amount of financial pressure special
fees put on each student at $ll9 per
quarter the most recent figure
available as the accounting of refund
requests continues.
"My belief, and the belief of many
senators here, is that the student
body deserves more control over the
way our money is spent," he added.
Senator Shelley Gao 'll rebuffed
"minority interest groups" in the spe
cial fees process, saying she supports
the ordinary student who may not
have time to attend meetings and
dictate his or her interests.
"I am representing the silent
majority," Gao said.
Tommy Tobin 'lO, director of the
student group SPOON, challenged
Gao's position, suggesting that issues
concerning special fees and refund
rates are more reflective of an uned
ucated student body rather than the
public's "tacit approval [of the bill
and special fees]."
Other senators stood by the bill as
an effective step along a path toward
increasing transparency and allowing
students more fiscal control.
"This isn't a bad bill," said Anton

Zietsman 'l2, chair of the
Appropriations Committee, "We're
making special fees groups account
able to the student body."
"I just can't see how this bill intro
duces the possibility that any group
that's legitimate does not receive
funding," Senator Adam Creasman
'll added.
Although many VSO leaders are
dubious about the prospects of the
bill's success in deflating special fees
costs and refund rates, for that
matter Senate Chair Varun
Sivaram 'll said the bill had the
potential to be beneficial.
"The bill was intended to curb the
growth of special fees. If it is the case
that without this bill, special fees
would have grown more, then the bill
has succeeded," Sivaram said.
Alluding to the possibility of stu
dents' again approving all special
fees groups with budgets of astro
nomical proportions, Senator
Mohammad Ali 'lO asked, "What's
the contingency plan if and when the
bill fails?"
"This is one plank," Katz said,
adding that the bill represents a small
piece in a much larger framework for
reform.
Still, many in attendance
expressed worry that the bill's
approval was too hasty. Michael
Tubbs 'l2 suggested that the bill does
not get at "real pragmatic solutions"
and that more research ought to be
done to decipher student opinion on
special fees concerns.

Limon's Status Still Without A
Verdict: Senator or Not?
To add to the meeting's legislative
frustrations, the status of former
Senator Daniel Limon 'l2 has yet to
be resolved, making voting proce
dures at best confusing and laborious
for the group as a whole.
After Limon took a leave of
absence during fall quarter, he
expected to return with ease to his
position in the association. However,
the ambiguity of his situation persists
as the Senate decides whether or not
he may constitutionally rejoin the
ranks without issue.
In a 10-4 re-vote for the special
fees bill that excluded the Senate's
former 15th member, Limon, the bill
was passed for a second time, a favor
able win for most senators.
In addition, the Senate confirmed
graduate student Elicia Blackford as
executive director of the Student
Service Division; also, all funding
bills on the table were approved.
As donations toward relief for the
Haiti earthquake level off, Executive
team members said they are consid
ering adding another position to the
cabinet that would address humani
tarian aid concerns. ASSU President
David Gobaud, a coterminal student
in computer science, has said he
would move $5OO from his salary to
create the position.

Financial officers of special fees groups are stirring.
They came out in relative force at last night's
ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting, where last
week senators enacted a bill disallowing student
groups from requesting an increase in special fees
beyond inflation without more stringent student body
approval.
On Tuesday, the bill faced challenges to both its
merits and the rules surrounding the vote that passed
it. Some student group leaders complained of short
notice to organize opposition to the bill, and said the
legislation would hinder their ability to collect special
fees money and provide programming to students.
But authors of the bill maintained that it is a nec
essary step to reducing the rate of students' requesting
refunds on their special fees, curbing spending out of
the ASSU buffer fund and promoting greater student
body engagement with the process of funding student
groups.
Matt McLaughlin 'OB, the ASSU financial manag
er, emphasized that this single piece of legislation is
unlikely to leverage large-scale positive change. "I
think that the special fees won't decrease," he said.
"Refund rates, we hope, will at least remain constant,
but there are a whole series of other reforms. This is by
no means the lynchpin."

Special Fees Bill Needs More Student Input, F.O. Says
Minh Dan Vuong 'll, the financial officer for

Alternative Spring Break, last night registered his dis
appointment and urged the Senate to reconsider its
decision, this time with more student input.
According to Vuong, the one week's notice that
financial officers received prior to the bill's passage
per the Senate's previous notice rales was not
enough for groups to mobilize a response.
Additionally, he claimed, the information session held
by the Appropriations Committee one day after the
bill passed was unacceptable and failed to consider
the voices of VSOs.
"This bill creates a bunch of unintended conse
quences," Vuong told the body. "Groups, for instance,
will have incentive to overstate their costs."
Stephanie Epps 'lO, former chair of the Senate
Appropriations Committee and current Black
Student Union (BSU) co-president, argued that the
new legislation opens a "Pandora's box" by discourag
ing moderation. In light of the legislation, Epps sug
gested that many student groups will be re-evaluating
their budgets and asking for more money from special
fees than they did previously.
"For the goal that you are trying to serve, it is doing
the exact opposite," Epps said. "You're not going to
offset the student activities fee at all. You're going to
increase it by a lot."
According to Senator Alex Katz 'l2,
Administration and Rules Committee chair, the bill
was created in the spirit of allowing students more fis-

bill remained intact.
cal control to determine student
groups funding.
"Special fees now represents $2.5
million," Katz said, referring to the
amount of financial pressure special
fees put on each student at $ll9 per
quarter the most recent figure
available as the accounting of refund
requests continues.
"My belief, and the belief of many
senators here, is that the student
body deserves more control over the
way our money is spent," he added.
Senator Shelley Gao 'll rebuffed
"minority interest groups" in the spe
cial fees process, saying she supports
the ordinary student who may not
have time to attend meetings and
dictate his or her interests.
"I am representing the silent
majority," Gao said.
Tommy Tobin 'lO, director of the
student group SPOON, challenged
Gao's position, suggesting that issues
concerning special fees and refund
rates are more reflective of an uned
ucated student body rather than the
public's "tacit approval [of the bill
and special fees]."
Other senators stood by the bill as
an effective step along a path toward
increasing transparency and allowing
students more fiscal control.
"This isn't a bad bill," said Anton

Zietsman 'l2, chair of the
Appropriations Committee, "We're
making special fees groups account
able to the student body."
"I just can't see how this bill intro
duces the possibility that any group
that's legitimate does not receive
funding," Senator Adam Creasman
'll added.
Although many VSO leaders are
dubious about the prospects of the
bill's success in deflating special fees
costs and refund rates, for that
matter Senate Chair Varun
Sivaram 'll said the bill had the
potential to be beneficial.
"The bill was intended to curb the
growth of special fees. If it is the case
that without this bill, special fees
would have grown more, then the bill
has succeeded," Sivaram said.
Alluding to the possibility of stu
dents' again approving all special
fees groups with budgets of astro
nomical proportions, Senator
Mohammad Ali 'lO asked, "What's
the contingency plan if and when the
bill fails?"
"This is one plank," Katz said,
adding that the bill represents a small
piece in a much larger framework for
reform.
Still, many in attendance
expressed worry that the bill's
approval was too hasty. Michael
Tubbs 'l2 suggested that the bill does
not get at "real pragmatic solutions"
and that more research ought to be
done to decipher student opinion on
special fees concerns.
