# ASSU: Winter refund rate highest in three years
## 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
More undergraduates request
ed money in special fees refunds
this winter than in any of the past
seven quarters, according to num
bers released by the ASSU
Tuesday night and now, student
groups are feeling the pinch.
A total of 1,132 students
requested refunds from some or
all of the 50 student groups who
received special fees this year, said
Matt McLaughlin, the ASSU
financial manager and CEO of
Stanford Student Enterprises.
Those special fees translated
this year to a $ll9 addition to
undergraduates' University bills.
During the first three weeks of
each quarter, undergraduates can

request refunds from some or all
groups, theoretically forfeiting
their ability to participate in those
groups' activities.
Of the 1,132 students request
ing refunds, 379 requested full
refunds from all groups. In all, stu
dents took back $115,794, or an
average of $102.29 per refund.
This represents a significant
one-year increase from winter
quarter 2009, in both dollar
amount and student requests.
Then, 660 students requested
refunds totaling $61,156, or an
average refund of $92.66. The spe
cial fees rate that quarter was
$llO.
In this academic year, in fall
quarter 2009, 788 students took
back $79,605 for an average of
$101.15 per student. 248 students
requested full refunds. By compari
son, in fall quarter 2008, a total of 488
students requested $43,385 in
refunds.
Student groups' budgets have his
torically been protected from the
impact of refund season by an ASSU
buffer fund. Since 2004, bylaws have
said that up to 10 percent of money
requested back by students is to
come from the buffer fund; after
that, refunds are to come from the
groups' budgets directly.
But the second part of that 2004
rule dipping into groups' budgets
directly for refunds was never
enforced "because there's never
been a need to," McLaughlin said at
the Jan. 12 Undergraduate Senate
meeting.
That changed when he alerted the

Senate to a looming spike in the
refund rate, reflected in yesterday's
numbers. Now, more than $45,000 is
proposed to come out of special fees
groups' budgets to cover the refunds.
In terms of absolute dollars
expected to drain from groups' budg

et, the groups hit hardest are the
Stanford Concert Network, with an
expected $3,380 deduction, and
KZSU, which faces an expected
$2,141 deduction.
In terms of total refunds, covered
both by groups' budgets and the
buffer fund, nine special fees groups
are refunding more than $3,000 each,
including Alternative Spring Break,
the ASSU Legal Counseling Office,
KZSU, the Stanford Organizing
Committee for the Arts, the Band,
club sports, Stanford Concert
Network, The Daily and the Stanford
Film Society
Meanwhile, general fees for publi
cations, programming and communi
ty service are facing more than
$20,000 in refunds, about $8,700 of
which will come from those budgets.
In last spring's election, student
voters approved every special fees
group's request for funding.
