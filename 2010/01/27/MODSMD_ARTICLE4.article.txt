## FACE AIDS, Stanford raise $50k for Haiti 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the help of several hundred
Stanford students, FACE AIDS has
reached its $50,000 fundraising goal
for Haiti relief efforts, the group said
yesterday.
The Stanford-founded group hit
$50,000 late Friday night. Sterling
Stamos, a Menlo Park-based invest
ment firm, matched the goal, result
ing in a total donation of $lOO,OOO to
Partners in Health, an international
organization that provides medical
care in Haiti, Rwanda and other
nations.
The partnership between FACE
AIDS and Partners in Health was
formalized with the launch of an
ASSU fundraising Web site last
week.
FACE AIDS launched the Haiti
fundraising initiative on Jan. 16 in
response to the magnitude 7.0 earth
quake that devastated the country
four days earlier. The $50,000 goal
was reached in fewer than seven
days, with a total of 970 people
donating $51,099.82 to the FACE
AIDS account on the ASSU Haiti
Web page.
"I was ecstatic," said FACE AIDS
Executive Director Julie Veroff 'O7.
"I couldn't believe we met the goal
so quickly. I really like that it was
such a community-wide effort."
Patricia Arty 'lO, FACE AIDS
development director, believes that
the success of the fundraising goal
can be attributed to students' atti
tudes and the participation of the
ASSU.
"The ASSU efforts were extraor
dinary, especially in matching FACE
AIDS with a beneficiary," Arty said.
"Doubling the money and having a
deadline was a great way to get peo
ple to donate now, and not put it off
and forget about it."
The ASSU fundraising effort has
raised more than $2,600 since the
$50,000 goal was reached last Friday.
Stanford affiliates continue to
donate on the ASSU site.
"The response from the Stanford

community has been tremendous,"
said ASSU President David
Gobaud, a coterminal student in
computer science. "The money
keeps coming in."
Brandon Jackson 'l2, one student
who donated to the FACE AIDS
effort, remembers watching news
coverage of the Haiti quake in a
hotel room when he was traveling
with the Stanford men's basketball
team two weeks ago. An interview
with a survivor left an impression on
him.

"Hearing a survivor speak made
me think about how blessed we are
at Stanford," Jackson said. "We need
to remember that even a little bit
makes a big difference."
The nationwide college fundrais
ing challenge Stanford joined has
raised more than $250,000, including
FACE AIDS matching funds, with
25 colleges pitching in since the site
was launched last Sunday.
