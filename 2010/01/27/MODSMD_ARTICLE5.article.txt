# CBO projects $1.3 trillion U.S. deficit
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
The Congressional Budget Office
said Tuesday that it projects a feder
al budget deficit of $1.35 trillion for
fiscal year 2010 unless current poli
cies and law change.
According to the office, the pro
jected deficit would be down from
2009, but still the second largest
since World War 11, when measured
as a share of national GDP.
Total debt is expected to climb to
$B.B trillion, or 60 percent of gross
domestic product, by the end of
2010.
"Beyond the 10-year projection
period, growth of spending for
Medicare, Medicaid and Social
Security will speed up from its
already rapid rate," CBO reported.
"To keep federal deficits and debt
from reaching levels that would sub
stantially harm the economy, law
makers would have to significantly
increase revenues, decrease project
ed spending or enact some combina
tion of the two."
On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate

rejected an idea backed by President
Obama to form a bipartisan panel to
develop plans to reduce the deficit.
President Obama is set to
announce an upcoming spending
freeze on non-discretionary defense
spending in tonight's State of the
Union speech, as an effort at incre
mental progress on the deficit. Both
supporters and critics of the move
note that the freeze will not address
the central factors driving deficit
growth.
