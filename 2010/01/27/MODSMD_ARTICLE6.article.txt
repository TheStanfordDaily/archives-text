Golden Globe film of the year, top
grossing movie of all time, conver
sation piece at every dinner table
"Avatar" isn't just huge, it's a
veritable 3D phenomenon. And
now that 3D technology is at the forefront of
public awareness, could it be that "Avatar" is
only the beginning of a major technological
revolution?
Aside from boasting star power in alumnus
Sigourney Weaver '72, "Avatar" is no excep
tion to Stanford's proud tradition of innova
tion in both the artistic and technical aspects
of film.

Students and staff, whether personally
involved or not, have strong opinions about
the film and the future. Many were receptive
to the film's new and improved technology.
"I found Avatar's use of 3D surprisingly
understated and very effective," said Tiffany
Li 'l3. "You could tell it was intended from the
very beginning to be 3D, as opposed to earlier
efforts which were essentially 2D films with
occasional monsters or flying objects launch
ing themselves at the audience,"
Film buff Peri Unver 'l3, who has written
for The Daily, gushed about the amazing visu
al experience.
"The cinematography was beautiful; it felt

like you were actually in the beautiful forests
and on the floating mountains of Pandora,"
she said.
Film and Media Studies professor Scott
Bukatman was similarly impressed with the
aesthetically pleasing components in
"Avatar".
"'Avatar' was astounding at least for
the first hour," he said. "I felt literally
immersed in an environment, almost as
though I was underwater. It was practically
hallucinatory."
However, he was also quick to point out
some of the flaws of the 3D experience as it
exists today.
