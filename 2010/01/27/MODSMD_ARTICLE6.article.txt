# 3D The future imension?

Golden Globe film of the year, top
grossing movie of all time, conver
sation piece at every dinner table
"Avatar" isn't just huge, it's a
veritable 3D phenomenon. And
now that 3D technology is at the forefront of
public awareness, could it be that "Avatar" is
only the beginning of a major technological
revolution?
Aside from boasting star power in alumnus
Sigourney Weaver '72, "Avatar" is no excep
tion to Stanford's proud tradition of innova
tion in both the artistic and technical aspects
of film.

Students and staff, whether personally
involved or not, have strong opinions about
the film and the future. Many were receptive
to the film's new and improved technology.
"I found Avatar's use of 3D surprisingly
understated and very effective," said Tiffany
Li 'l3. "You could tell it was intended from the
very beginning to be 3D, as opposed to earlier
efforts which were essentially 2D films with
occasional monsters or flying objects launch
ing themselves at the audience,"
Film buff Peri Unver 'l3, who has written
for The Daily, gushed about the amazing visu
al experience.
"The cinematography was beautiful; it felt

like you were actually in the beautiful forests
and on the floating mountains of Pandora,"
she said.
Film and Media Studies professor Scott
Bukatman was similarly impressed with the
aesthetically pleasing components in
"Avatar".
"'Avatar' was astounding at least for
the first hour," he said. "I felt literally
immersed in an environment, almost as
though I was underwater. It was practically
hallucinatory."
However, he was also quick to point out
some of the flaws of the 3D experience as it
exists today.

A student watches a 3D film on his laptop in his dorm room. With the unprecedented success of "Avatar," will 3D technology become the
industry standard?
"I have to say that I think it's a
bit less interactive you're kind of
forced to sit with your head at a
level angle, staring straight ahead,"
Bukatman said. "I rarely talk to my
partner it's even harder to eat
Goobers."
Indeed, 3D is by no means a new
technology, but one that has been
continually criticized and subse
quently expanded for decades.
"Four years ago in 2006,
Cameron was delaying 'Avatar,'
waiting for technology to develop,"
revealed Computer Science
Professor Ron Fedkiw, who
received an Academy Award in
2008 for his work with fluid simula
tions and other technological
breakthroughs. His work has been
featured in films including
"Poseidon," "Star Wars III,"
"Terminator 3" and the "Pirates of
the Caribbean" and "Harry Potter"
series. He also consulted for some
of the technical aspects involved in
"Avatar."
"So while 'Avatar' is a beautiful
digital film, with 3D technology and
great performance motion capture,
these technological advances are
only incremental on top of the pre
existing work," he explained. "[The

movie's] real contribution to film
making is the 'virtual camera' they
designed for making the film
that allows one to see CG (comput
er generated) elements along with
the footage being shot."
Fedkiw is confident that 3D
technology will become increasing
ly prominent not just in film, but in
video games and even home enter
tainment.
'"Spy Kids 3D' shipped glasses
in the DVD, [and] this phenomena
will only increase with time."
Timing, though, is always an
issue.
"My guess is that it is going to be
a niche technology although an
important niche for a fair
amount of time," said Electrical
Engineering professor Thomas Lee.
"The need to wear glasses is
enough of a bother by itself to
inhibit widespread adoption of the
technology in the home. On top of
that, home 3D equipment will be
expensive, and the limited availabil
ity of 3D titles for quite some time
will further constrain the rate of
adoption."
Dr. Henry Lowood, Curator for
History of Science & Technology
Collections, agreed.
"I am skeptical about the cur
rent push to move 3D televisions
into the home," he said. "I think
there are some fundamental bottle

necks with regard to content and
demand, partly because so many
people have recently invested in
large LCD or plasma sets, and part
ly because it is not entirely clear to
me what people would do with
these sets today."
It seems that corporations are
not interested in waiting, however.
At the Consumer Electronics Show
(CES) held earlier this month in
Las Vegas, 3D was the buzzword
and everything from myriad types
of 3D televisions to camcorders and
Blu-Ray discs were introduced and
promoted. ESPN has plans to
broadcast the World Cup in 3D this
summer, and will branch out
into other sports soon
after.

Yet many who have
had negative experi
ences with 3D films in
the past still remain
wary of the genre in gen
eral.
"I like 3D movies less
than normal movies," said
Ryan Staatz 'll. "I find
the forced perspective
annoying when I want to
focus on other parts of the
screen."
Hillary Lin 'lO was even
more unforgiving.
"I saw [Avatar] in 3D, and it
gave me an eyestrain for the rest of

the day," she said. "I think 3D
movies need a huge improvement
before I'm going to go see any
more of them."
Brendan Weinstein 'l3 felt that
the 3D effects in Avatar were "less
obnoxious and more subtle than in
other films," but still found the
glasses an irritating detraction from
the viewing experience.
So is 3D here to stay or merely a
fleeting phenomenon?
"I appreciate the use of 3D tech
nology when it actually adds some
thing to the movie and isn't just a

flashy novelty that production com
panies want to show off," said
Eileen Wright 'l3. "But I don't
think 3D movies or TV will appeal
to most people .. until they get rid
of those dorky glasses."
And, as Freshman-Sophomore
College Director Dr. Andrew
Dimock observed, "There was a lot
more emotional truth and weight in
five minutes of George
Frederickson's grief in 'UP' than in
two-and-a-half hours of 'Avatar.'"

Golden Globe film of the year, top
grossing movie of all time, conver
sation piece at every dinner table
"Avatar" isn't just huge, it's a
veritable 3D phenomenon. And
now that 3D technology is at the forefront of
public awareness, could it be that "Avatar" is
only the beginning of a major technological
revolution?
Aside from boasting star power in alumnus
Sigourney Weaver '72, "Avatar" is no excep
tion to Stanford's proud tradition of innova
tion in both the artistic and technical aspects
of film.

Students and staff, whether personally
involved or not, have strong opinions about
the film and the future. Many were receptive
to the film's new and improved technology.
"I found Avatar's use of 3D surprisingly
understated and very effective," said Tiffany
Li 'l3. "You could tell it was intended from the
very beginning to be 3D, as opposed to earlier
efforts which were essentially 2D films with
occasional monsters or flying objects launch
ing themselves at the audience,"
Film buff Peri Unver 'l3, who has written
for The Daily, gushed about the amazing visu
al experience.
"The cinematography was beautiful; it felt

like you were actually in the beautiful forests
and on the floating mountains of Pandora,"
she said.
Film and Media Studies professor Scott
Bukatman was similarly impressed with the
aesthetically pleasing components in
"Avatar".
"'Avatar' was astounding at least for
the first hour," he said. "I felt literally
immersed in an environment, almost as
though I was underwater. It was practically
hallucinatory."
However, he was also quick to point out
some of the flaws of the 3D experience as it
exists today.

A student watches a 3D film on his laptop in his dorm room. With the unprecedented success of "Avatar," will 3D technology become the
industry standard?
"I have to say that I think it's a
bit less interactive you're kind of
forced to sit with your head at a
level angle, staring straight ahead,"
Bukatman said. "I rarely talk to my
partner it's even harder to eat
Goobers."
Indeed, 3D is by no means a new
technology, but one that has been
continually criticized and subse
quently expanded for decades.
"Four years ago in 2006,
Cameron was delaying 'Avatar,'
waiting for technology to develop,"
revealed Computer Science
Professor Ron Fedkiw, who
received an Academy Award in
2008 for his work with fluid simula
tions and other technological
breakthroughs. His work has been
featured in films including
"Poseidon," "Star Wars III,"
"Terminator 3" and the "Pirates of
the Caribbean" and "Harry Potter"
series. He also consulted for some
of the technical aspects involved in
"Avatar."
"So while 'Avatar' is a beautiful
digital film, with 3D technology and
great performance motion capture,
these technological advances are
only incremental on top of the pre
existing work," he explained. "[The

movie's] real contribution to film
making is the 'virtual camera' they
designed for making the film
that allows one to see CG (comput
er generated) elements along with
the footage being shot."
Fedkiw is confident that 3D
technology will become increasing
ly prominent not just in film, but in
video games and even home enter
tainment.
'"Spy Kids 3D' shipped glasses
in the DVD, [and] this phenomena
will only increase with time."
Timing, though, is always an
issue.
"My guess is that it is going to be
a niche technology although an
important niche for a fair
amount of time," said Electrical
Engineering professor Thomas Lee.
"The need to wear glasses is
enough of a bother by itself to
inhibit widespread adoption of the
technology in the home. On top of
that, home 3D equipment will be
expensive, and the limited availabil
ity of 3D titles for quite some time
will further constrain the rate of
adoption."
Dr. Henry Lowood, Curator for
History of Science & Technology
Collections, agreed.
"I am skeptical about the cur
rent push to move 3D televisions
into the home," he said. "I think
there are some fundamental bottle

necks with regard to content and
demand, partly because so many
people have recently invested in
large LCD or plasma sets, and part
ly because it is not entirely clear to
me what people would do with
these sets today."
It seems that corporations are
not interested in waiting, however.
At the Consumer Electronics Show
(CES) held earlier this month in
Las Vegas, 3D was the buzzword
and everything from myriad types
of 3D televisions to camcorders and
Blu-Ray discs were introduced and
promoted. ESPN has plans to
broadcast the World Cup in 3D this
summer, and will branch out
into other sports soon
after.

Yet many who have
had negative experi
ences with 3D films in
the past still remain
wary of the genre in gen
eral.
"I like 3D movies less
than normal movies," said
Ryan Staatz 'll. "I find
the forced perspective
annoying when I want to
focus on other parts of the
screen."
Hillary Lin 'lO was even
more unforgiving.
"I saw [Avatar] in 3D, and it
gave me an eyestrain for the rest of

the day," she said. "I think 3D
movies need a huge improvement
before I'm going to go see any
more of them."
