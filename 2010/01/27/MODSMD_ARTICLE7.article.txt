## Stanford gets 'social host' waiver County exempts school from underage drinking ordinance 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford is one step closer to
receiving a permanent exemption
from a county rule holding private
residents responsible for under
age drinking that occurs on their
property.
The "social host" rule, which
went into effect in January 2009,
allows the county to fine property
owners and others "responsible"
for underage drinking gatherings.
The non-criminal citations start at
$350.
Stanford got a one-year
exemption from the ordinance in
order to demonstrate that its own
underage drinking policies are
sufficient in light of the rule's
intent: to enforce drinking laws,
protect quiet neighborhoods and
reduce the cost of police and med
ical responses to underage emer
gencies.
Since then, the University has
sought to make the exemption
permanent, and county board
members Tuesday indicated that
they agreed, unanimously passing
a preliminary amendment to the
ordinance exempting non-profit
higher education institutions from
the social host rule. One supervi
sor, Dave Cortese, was absent.
The amendment will be up for
final adoption on Feb. 9.
In a memo to the county this
week, Jean McCown, Stanford's
director of community relations,
said the University appreciated
the county's review of existing
programs and highlighted the
staff recommendation that
Stanford "be permitted to imple
ment the goals of the ordinance
through institutional administra
tive policies and programs that
are aimed at preventing underage
drinking."
A copy of the University's
alcohol policy was among materi
als submitted to the board, includ
ing Stanford's basic policy on stu
dent drinking: "Students who
unlawfully distribute, possess or use
controlled substances or alcohol in
the workplace, on the campus or as
an part of any University activity
may be subject to discipline up to
and including expulsion."
University sanctions for individ
ual students on campus facing alco
hol-related citations, arrests and
emergency room trips were also
noted in a summary prepared by
Ralph Castro, Stanford's substance
abuse prevention program manag
er.
Those sanctions increase with the
severity of offenses, from minor-in
possession citations which carry
hour-long meetings with a residence
dean and substance abuse preven
tion staff, an online alcohol educa
tion course and a possible call to
parents —to driving-under-the
influence arrests, which translate to
a Judicial Affairs case.
Castro is set to follow up with
county staff to map how Stanford
will deliver its annual report to the

county on the effectiveness of its
programs, according to McCown.
She said the report will include data
the University already tracks,
including "how many students were
ill enough from alcohol consump

tion to take them to the emergency
room that's obviously the most
serious one we're worried about."
