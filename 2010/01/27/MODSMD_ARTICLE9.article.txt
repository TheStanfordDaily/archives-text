# WHERE JOURNALISM AND TECHNOLOGY COLLIDE

### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
{ f Y I technology, at first,
greatly benefited
the news media,
and then it began
m to destroy it," said
Joel Brinkley, Visiting Hearst
Professional in Residence at
Stanford's Graduate Program in
Journalism (GPH), a subsidiary of the
Department of Communication.
"When I started, there was no
Internet, there was no e-mail... so
when I worked for local papers, I
worked from sort of a cocoon unless I
subscribed to the New York Times or
the Detroit Free Press," he continued.
"I had no idea what anybody else was
doing. That's the way it was in the sev
enties and the eighties and pretty
much into the early nineties."
In 2005, the journalism program's
curriculum still trained students for
the nineties newsroom. But now, the
Internet is a centerpiece of Stanford's
Graduate Program in Journalism.
According to Acting Director Ann
Grimes, during the past five years, the
program has rewritten its curriculum
to "train students in old media values
and digital media skills."
The program's brochure now
shows Internet cables above reams of
newsprint on the cover and advertises
a program that "is actively engaged
with next-generation media technolo
gies."

Grimes said a big change is the
integration of multimedia instruction
with public issues reporting classes.
For one course, students pick a Bay
Area location where they do what
Grimes calls "old fashioned gumshoe
reporting on city hall" and publish
their stories on the "Silicon Valley
Pulse" website, where the stories are
sometimes picked up by newspapers
and are displayed on websites like
Google News.
"Our capstone class in the spring is
a class called "Digital Media
Entrepreneurship," she said. In this
class, journalism students collaborate
with Graduate School of Business
(GSB) and engineering students to
produce digital media ventures "that
hopefully have a sustainable business
model." She said this kind of class is
mostly unique to Stanford, because
students are immersed in Silicon
Valley.
"The other thing that we're dong
is we're encouraging our students to

take advantage of the many interdis
ciplinary offerings that are on cam
pus so that they can tailor their pro
gram to their interests," Grimes said.
"We have students taking the design
school boot camp. We have students
taking CSIOS learning how to
code. We have students taking the
entrepreneurial ventures class at the
GSB so that they can learn about
the industry that they're entering."
So that they find jobs after leaving
the program, the GPIJ also strives to
get its students' work recognized.
"We're also working with different
outside media organizations the
Wall Street Journal, the San Francisco
Chronicle, the Center for Investigative
Reporting and Patch.com (an East
Coast amateur news site) have all
expressed varying levels of interest in
our students here," Grimes said. "So
increasingly we are getting our stu
dents to produce reports that are
picked up or will be picked up by these
larger media organizations."

The program also encourages stu
dents to take internships with out
side organizations. Because the pro
gram is small there are typically
about 15 students per year it tries
to maximize students' opportunities
and help them get the jobs in areas
that they're interested in. This year,
students are working at KQED (the
Bay Area PBS radio station),
VNet.com, Current TV, the San
Francisco Chronicle and the San
Francisco Business Times. Students
are also working at the Wall Street
Journal, National Journal, Gigaom
Network and Google News.
"There are still, of course, profes
sional reporters working at large scale
newspapers, but newspapers them
selves now are multimedia enterpris
es, as are all journalistic enterprises,"
said Fred Turner, associate professor
of Communication.
The news media is changing rapid
ly, and the GPIJ prepares its students
to adapt to the changing journalistic
landscape.
"What we need to do is let a thou
sand flowers bloom. And nobody's
really sure yet which flowers are
going to grow and which flowers
aren't," Turner said. "Students who
finish the program have a year of
training the core sequence is six
courses, with three 'traditional jour
nalism' nodes, and three additional
nodes for training in new media."
"Journalistic institutions are
changing," he continued. "We have to
train our students for a world in which

there are some newspapers, but there
are a lot more startups. And we have
to train our students for a startup
world. That's really a challenge. And
we're sure getting after it."
