## Honeymoon's Over 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
Last year Stephanie Parker 'll decided to make
a change and go full-throttle for Barack
Obama. That meant literally dropping every
thing and putting her life on hold to campaign
for the freshman Illinois senator who promised
to transform politics in Washington.
Parker began the campaign by registering voters and
then moved up in the ranks of Stanford's chapter of
Students for Barack Obama, eventually managing the
entire database of Obama campaigners on campus. For
more than a quarter, it was non-stop voter registration
drives, reminding people to mail in their absentee ballots
and weekend road trips to Nevada. It was all Obama, all
the time.
For Parker, it was worth it. On election night 2008, she,
along with a cohort of 130 other Stanford students, were
canvassing for the soon-to-be president in Nevada. When
the results rushed in that night and Barack Obama was
declared the 44th president of the United States, it was
joyous mayhem in Las Vegas.
"We ran around the casino celebrating like it was
1999!" Parker said. "It was really an awesome and emo
tional feeling."
Other students on the campaign trail got caught up in
the historic election results as well.
"I am here because I believe in Obama," Michael
Albada 'll, who has written for The Daily, said on elec
tion night. Like Parker, he was in Nevada campaigning
for Obama. "I think he is a political messiah. He is the
man our generation needs."
And Stanford overwhelmingly agreed with Albada.
In 2008, Obama fever swept through campus. There were
rallies in White Plaza, debate-watching parties at Old
Union and a sea of Barack Obama bumper stickers in
student parking lots. In February 2008, the official
Facebook group for Stanford Obama supporters had j
over 900 members. On election day, Barack Obama A
clinched 90 percent of the Stanford vote of the near- AI
ly 1000 students who cast their ballots at the GCC \
according to an exit poll conducted by The Daily. A■ /
It was Obamania. >
That was a year ago.
Now, the once white-hot excitement <•'
over Obama's candidacy is more luke- •
warm. In many cases, the resounding cry
of "Yes We Can" has devolved into a *
faint murmur.
"The enthusiasm is just not there
now," Parker said. "The support for fly
the president has definitely fl* 1
decreased. Students like him as a Bi 1
person, but they're very disappoint- fl,
ed in the job he's done."
Nationally, Obama's approval rat- *-
ing has dipped below 50 percent and
Democrats have been on the defensive in the last A
few weeks trying to defend many of Obama's policy
initiatives. fl
Hirav Gandhi 'lO, a member of the Stanford fl
Conservative Society, is unsurprised by Obama's
plummeting national approval numbers but fl
thinks Stanford's political climate isn't represen- fl
tative of national sentiment. fl
"I personally think that the worst that you H

get on campus aside from groups on
BP the extreme left or right is general indif
ference," Gandhi said. "People think, yeah,
Obama had a rough year. That's definitely a
change in student perception of Obama from the
enamored adoration he got last year."
While enthusiasm for the 44th president has petered
off in many circles, for the die-hard Obama fans, the
enthusiasm gap isn't totally unexpected.
Zev Karlin-Neumann 'll went into the campaign real
izing that while Obama was a compelling candidate, he
was battling structural issues from the outset and could
only deliver so much.
A little over a year ago, Karlin-Neumann lived and
breathed Obama. He canvassed swing districts, regis
tered voters, and debated for the Illinois senator. He
was one of the 130 students who road-tripped to
Nevada every other weekend throughout the campaign.
Karlin-Neumann has noticed that the Obama fervor
has leveled off since the campaign days.
"I saw a friend yesterday who was one of the people
I had road-tripped with a few times during the cam
paign and he was commenting on this freeze of fed
eral spending," Karlin-Neumann said. "He said
something like 'Well, what would you expect from
this president, it's been a disappointing year.' And it
made me kind of sad because he was someone who
was putting a lot of effort into the campaign a year
ago. I think there has been a letdown in a num
ber of quarters, without a doubt."
Karlin-Neumann, a history and polit
ical science double major, worked in
the Senate in Stanford in
Washington last quarter and said
that even as someone who is
plugged into politics, it is
fc difficult to stay on top
of the policy issues
v That

cism, he
"A campaign
is just more
exciting," he
'w said. "People
can grasp a
horserace more easily
who's up and who's down. Is
this going to be the speech that decides the
k campaign? Getting into the intricacies of the
B issues is hard to understand. People tune out."
B Parker agreed with Karlin-Neumann
that when you're out of the heat of a cam
paign, problem sets and schoolwork trump
politics.
B "Traditionally on college campuses, you
don't see the same level of political
engagement unless there is something
tangible that can be fulfilled watch-
ing the news, signing petitions," Parker
said. "It hasn't translated into a
B change. And students are more
B focused on the job hunt."
B But for Tommy Schultz 'll,
president of the Stanford
B Conservative Society, Obama's
B declining popularity isn't about the
B campaign being over. It's about
B students waking up to the issues,
"Plenty of Stanford students
got caught up in the hope of his
words have been disappoint-
ed with the reality of his
actions," Schultz said in an e-
mail to The Daily. "We have
members who were skepti
cal all along, but I can't tell
you how many students

evidence of support from their Facebook [profile] or car
bumper."
During the campaign, the ground floor of The Axe and
Palm and Old Union overflowed with students transfixed
in front of TV screens watching Republican candidate
John McCain and Obama battle it out on national televi
sion.
Fast forward a year, to Obama's State of the Union
address Wednesday night. The couches in Old Union that
used to be jam-packed with people held a smattering of
lounging students, many of whom were focused more on
their homework than on Obama's words. Gone was the
hushed anticipation, the exclamatory whoops, cheers and
high fives that characterized last fall's election cycle.
"The State of the Union isn't the same adrenaline rush
as a debate," Parker said.
There was a fairly complacent reception to the speech
which focused largely on spurring job growth and get
ting the economy back on track and most people
thought that it wasn't a rousing address, but it got the job
done.
"Obama made some good points and was very elo
quent," said Annissa Chitour 'l3. "He definitely called out
Congress and said to get something done."
"I would have liked to hear more about healthcare,
however," she continued. "But I understand that he had to
focus on the economy and jobs."
Sarah Flamm 'll had similar reactions to the speech
and said that while this was not an oratory landmark,
Obama focused on the issues and struck a populist note
that would resonate with viewers.
"I liked that he was so personable," Flamm said.
"Obama always comes in, organizes and says things are
going to be 0.K."
That's what students like Parker and Karlin-Neumann
people who invested their GPAs, sleep schedules and
weekends in the president are banking on. Among the
students who canvassed for Obama, there remains a
stand-by-your man norm. They haven't lost confidence in
Obama just yet.
"Obama keeps on running into so many setbacks and
problems, but if anyone can think of the best way to get
through this situation, it's him," Parker said. "Overall, I still
trust him and believe in him."

Fast forward a year, to Obama's State of the Union
address Wednesday night. The couches in Old Union that
used to be jam-packed with people held a smattering of

hushed anticipation, the exclamatory whoops, cheers and
high fives that characterized last fall's election cycle.
"The State of the Union isn't the same adrenaline rush

There was a fairly complacent reception to the speech

thought that it wasn't a rousing address, but it got the job
done.
"Obama made some good points and was very elo
quent," said Annissa Chitour 'l3. "He definitely called out
Congress and said to get something done."
"I would have liked to hear more about healthcare,
however," she continued. "But I understand that he had to
focus on the economy and jobs."
Sarah Flamm 'll had similar reactions to the speech
and said that while this was not an oratory landmark,
Obama focused on the issues and struck a populist note
that would resonate with viewers.
"I liked that he was so personable," Flamm said.
"Obama always comes in, organizes and says things are
going to be 0.K."
That's what students like Parker and Karlin-Neumann
people who invested their GPAs, sleep schedules and
weekends in the president are banking on. Among the
students who canvassed for Obama, there remains a
stand-by-your man norm. They haven't lost confidence in
Obama just yet.
"Obama keeps on running into so many setbacks and
problems, but if anyone can think of the best way to get
through this situation, it's him," Parker said. "Overall, I still
trust him and believe in him."

NOW: A little more than a year after Obama was elected, a less enthusiastic group of students watch Obama's first official
State of the Union address at The Axe and Palm.


Last year Stephanie Parker 'll decided to make
a change and go full-throttle for Barack
Obama. That meant literally dropping every
thing and putting her life on hold to campaign
for the freshman Illinois senator who promised
to transform politics in Washington.
Parker began the campaign by registering voters and
then moved up in the ranks of Stanford's chapter of
Students for Barack Obama, eventually managing the
entire database of Obama campaigners on campus. For
more than a quarter, it was non-stop voter registration
drives, reminding people to mail in their absentee ballots
and weekend road trips to Nevada. It was all Obama, all
the time.
For Parker, it was worth it. On election night 2008, she,
along with a cohort of 130 other Stanford students, were
canvassing for the soon-to-be president in Nevada. When
the results rushed in that night and Barack Obama was
declared the 44th president of the United States, it was
joyous mayhem in Las Vegas.
"We ran around the casino celebrating like it was
1999!" Parker said. "It was really an awesome and emo
tional feeling."
Other students on the campaign trail got caught up in
the historic election results as well.
"I am here because I believe in Obama," Michael
Albada 'll, who has written for The Daily, said on elec
tion night. Like Parker, he was in Nevada campaigning
for Obama. "I think he is a political messiah. He is the
man our generation needs."
And Stanford overwhelmingly agreed with Albada.
In 2008, Obama fever swept through campus. There were
rallies in White Plaza, debate-watching parties at Old
Union and a sea of Barack Obama bumper stickers in
student parking lots. In February 2008, the official
Facebook group for Stanford Obama supporters had j
over 900 members. On election day, Barack Obama A
clinched 90 percent of the Stanford vote of the near- AI
ly 1000 students who cast their ballots at the GCC \
according to an exit poll conducted by The Daily. A■ /
It was Obamania. >
That was a year ago.
Now, the once white-hot excitement <•'
over Obama's candidacy is more luke- •
warm. In many cases, the resounding cry
of "Yes We Can" has devolved into a *
faint murmur.
"The enthusiasm is just not there
now," Parker said. "The support for fly
the president has definitely fl* 1
decreased. Students like him as a Bi 1
person, but they're very disappoint- fl,
ed in the job he's done."
Nationally, Obama's approval rat- *-
ing has dipped below 50 percent and
Democrats have been on the defensive in the last A
few weeks trying to defend many of Obama's policy
initiatives. fl
Hirav Gandhi 'lO, a member of the Stanford fl
Conservative Society, is unsurprised by Obama's
plummeting national approval numbers but fl
thinks Stanford's political climate isn't represen- fl
tative of national sentiment. fl
"I personally think that the worst that you H

get on campus aside from groups on
BP the extreme left or right is general indif
ference," Gandhi said. "People think, yeah,
Obama had a rough year. That's definitely a
change in student perception of Obama from the
enamored adoration he got last year."
While enthusiasm for the 44th president has petered
off in many circles, for the die-hard Obama fans, the
enthusiasm gap isn't totally unexpected.
Zev Karlin-Neumann 'll went into the campaign real
izing that while Obama was a compelling candidate, he
was battling structural issues from the outset and could
only deliver so much.
A little over a year ago, Karlin-Neumann lived and
breathed Obama. He canvassed swing districts, regis
tered voters, and debated for the Illinois senator. He
was one of the 130 students who road-tripped to
Nevada every other weekend throughout the campaign.
Karlin-Neumann has noticed that the Obama fervor
has leveled off since the campaign days.
"I saw a friend yesterday who was one of the people
I had road-tripped with a few times during the cam
paign and he was commenting on this freeze of fed
eral spending," Karlin-Neumann said. "He said
something like 'Well, what would you expect from
this president, it's been a disappointing year.' And it
made me kind of sad because he was someone who
was putting a lot of effort into the campaign a year
ago. I think there has been a letdown in a num
ber of quarters, without a doubt."
Karlin-Neumann, a history and polit
ical science double major, worked in
the Senate in Stanford in
Washington last quarter and said
that even as someone who is
plugged into politics, it is
fc difficult to stay on top
of the policy issues
v That
sparks
cism, he
"A campaign
is just more
exciting," he
'w said. "People
can grasp a
horserace more easily
who's up and who's down. Is
this going to be the speech that decides the
k campaign? Getting into the intricacies of the
B issues is hard to understand. People tune out."
B Parker agreed with Karlin-Neumann
that when you're out of the heat of a cam
paign, problem sets and schoolwork trump
politics.
B "Traditionally on college campuses, you
don't see the same level of political
