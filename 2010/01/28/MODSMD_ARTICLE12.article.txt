# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Anti-creationist visits Farm 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night, Stanford became the
most recent stop along infamous anti
creationist blogger Paul Zachary "PZ"
Myers's Northern California college
tour, with visits to eight college towns
in eight days.
Myers, a biology professor at the
University of Minnesota Morris, is
probably best known for his anti-cre
ationist design blog, Pharyngula,
named after the pharyngula stage of
embryonic development. His Web site
is currently one of the most popular
science blogs on the Internet and
also one of the most provocative.
Atheists, Humanists and Agnostics
(AHA!) @ Stanford, a student group
on campus that bills itself as a center
for "fun and lively discussion" concern
ing religion and secularity, organized
the event.
Myers opened by introducing his
role and experiences as a biologist and
an anti-creationist crusader.
"[Anti-creationists] love to hear
people discuss things that we've been
saying, and even argue with them.
Unfortunately, most of their arguments
are really stupid, but it's a start," Myers
said, essentially summarizing his out
look on the creationist opposition.
He outlined the creationist argu
ment as thus: the only way to create
complexity is by design, and biology is
complex. Therefore, biology was creat
ed by design.
"There's lots of different ways to
create complexity, and they don't
required intent," Myers countered. He
also used a principle of engineering to
argue against intelligent design, saying
that, "you don't add needless complex
ity to structures."
After utilizing various biological
concepts and geological data as evi
dence against creationism, Myers
emphasized his final message: nature is
not an engineer.
"Nature is capable of producing all
kinds of complexity without intent,

without a designer,"
he concluded.
"Creationist claims
that it is are bunk."
While it seemed
that Myers spent his
evening preaching,
for the most part, to
the anti-creationist
choir, there were

some exceptions in the audience.
One man asked whether there is a
gentle, non-confrontational way of
introducing the subject of evolution to
a devoutly religious individual.
Because Myers is known by many
for the caustic tone of his blog, some
may have found his response surpris
ing.
"You don't have to confront â€”just
explain yourself," he said. "You can
also be confrontational, which is my
preferred method. You won't get
instant conversions, but you can make
people think."
He explained that he doesn't try to
convert his religious students to athe
ism. "I'm there to teach them biology. I
take a historical approach and lead
them carefully through the evidence."
Myers also addressed questions
regarding religious scientists reconcil
ing their careers and their beliefs, the
difficulties in confronting people who
are emotionally attached to their reli
gious convictions, and the reason for
the relatively small size of the vocal
atheist contingency.
One audience member directly crit
icized Myers's use of mockery and bla
tant criticism in his blog, calling it dehu
manizing toward creationists and
polarizing to the argument.
"I applaud what you do in class,"
the questioner explained. However, he
continued, "I don't like your blog."
"That's fine," Myers responded.
"What we need is a multitude of
approaches. I wouldn't say my solution
is the solution for everybody...
Eventually, people will need to be
even-handed and come up with a func
tioning solution."

Myers said that, while he feels the
need to ridicule what he considers stu
pid creationist ideas, he agrees that
there is a need for people to use diplo
macy and respectful intercourse to
make compromises.
"These are human beings, our
neighbors, friends and families, and
we're not going to load them up into
box cars and ship them somewhere,"
he said. "I would not ever try to limit
somebody's right to do anything, no
matter how foolish."
In an interview with The Daily,
Myers explained that his audiences
haven't always been so supportive and
said he missed the days of creationist
challenges from the audience.
"They'd come up with these really
weird ideas and I'd have fun taking
them apart.
The talk, which took place in Room
41 of Jordan Hall, was filled beyond
normal capacity and had to include
standing room in the back. The audi
ence consisted of all ages, ethnicities
and hometowns. One person noted on
the Facebook page for the event as
having driven one-and-a-half hours to
Stanford, and a junior high school-age
boy was sitting with his parents.
He has a message for all those who
oppose him, "I challenge creationists:
Show up."
Myers' blog began innocuously
enough. A biologist in a small
Midwestern town, he decided to start
writing on a daily basis, eventually find
ing himself writing about what he
cared about most: biology. He started
responding to his readers' requests that
he discuss religion, science and society,
and from there Pharyngula evolved
into its current form and subject mat
ter.
"People appreciate the fact that
somebody is firing back against the
foolishness that they're hearing, and I
guess I'm fairly good at firing back," he
said.
