## OP-ED A 						Call to Action: Why I am Attending the Stanford United Gathering 
### 
This Friday, at 8:10 a.m., the Westboro
Baptist Church (WBC) will be coming
to Stanford.
When I received the e-mail last Thursday
night saying that "some pretty awful people"
were coming to Stanford, I was confounded.
I had never heard of the WBC before and
never would have guessed that a group of
people would protest with such a message of
hate at Stanford. But the fact is they're sched
uled to come.
From all the talk generated on Stanford
chat lists, I see two ways that the Student
Body can handle this situation: we can ignore
the WBC and their message of intolerance, or
we can counter them with our own gathering
of love and unity. I will be outside Hillel at 8
a.m. on Friday morning joining in that unity,
and I encourage the Stanford campus to do
the same.
I want to briefly acquaint you with the
WBC so you can understand why I will be at
the event. The WBC is a church built on the
concept of hate. Not actually affiliated with
any Baptist convention or association, this
church uses narrow interpretations of Bibli
cal texts to sanction their protests. Officially
characterized as a hate group by the Anti
Defamation League, the WBC travels all
over the country spreading, among their var
ious beliefs, their anti-gay, anti-Jewish, and
anti-American messages. Their strategy is to
display provocative signs and messages to
antagonize others into verbal or physical ac
tion. The WBC then interprets this action as
impeding on their rights to protest peaceful
ly and pursues legal action, the profits of
which fund their next protest.
So why this Stanford United gathering?
Why are we giving them the audience they
crave? Because, as I heard at the Martin
Luther King, Jr. interfaith service, "There
comes a time when silence is betrayal." To
not take this opportunity to join together and
spread Stanford's message of unity and
openness would indeed be a betrayal of our
student identity.
Our dedication, as students, to become ed
ucated citizens active within the world re
volves around the concept of coming togeth
er, of forming a united, diverse community.
Religions, ethnicities, and academic majors all
blend together to create our great campus. To
be silent while the WBC protests one of our
fundamental values as a University would be
a grave betrayal to what we stand for.
Morally, I cannot stand idly by. Though
Stanford United was created in response to
the WBC, it is foremost a celebration and is
not an anti-protest. We will not face the WBC
picketers nor engage them. On the contrary,

we will celebrate. We will use the energy and
enthusiasm of our campus to create some
thing productive: an event the whole campus
can take pride in. Members of the Jewish com
munity, the LGBT community, F.A.I.T.H,
Challah for Hunger, the Catholic Community
at Stanford, the Asian American Students As
sociation, Sigma Nu, Talisman, and so many
others will be outside, standing side by side, in
song and cheers, celebrating the diversity of
our community. This gathering is our party,
our chance to rejoice with our friends in Stan
ford's awesomeness; facing away from the
hate and toward Hillel, which will be decorat
ed to represent the diverse array of student
groups.
Besides the symbolism of standing togeth
er, united as one community, there is a practi
cal reason for the gathering. Even if the Cam
pus decided to officially ignore the WBC, re
fusing to stoop to their level and provide an
audience, people would show up. The original
warning e-mail spread like wildfire through
out Stanford; people would know about the
protest and, despite warnings, they would
come. Instead of risking that individuals
would fall prey to the WBC tactics, this event
was envisioned to give structure to the re
sponse, engaging the whole Stanford commu
nity in a peaceful, celebratory event.
So please, I encourage everyone to come
out, and to follow the guidelines of the event
organizers to ensure everyone's safety: Stay
on the grass areas designated for the Stan
ford United gathering. Listen to and cooper
ate with the Stanford Police and student vol
unteers who will be there to help keep our
event safe and dignified. DO NOT engage
any member of the WBC. We are there to
focus on our own values and commitments,
and the best way to keep the event safe for
everyone is to avoid engaging the protestors.
Please, no outside community members. In
order to keep everyone safe, we would like
only Stanford affiliates to be present at the
gathering.
Be on the lookout for e-mails detailing
event specifics. I hope that you will join me
Friday morning so that we can show the
world that Stanford stands United.
