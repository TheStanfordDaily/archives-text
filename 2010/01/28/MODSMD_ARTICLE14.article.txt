# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Maleficent Chronology 
### Emily Hulme 
It would not be wrong to say today, like any
other day, like yesterday and tomorrow
and June 20,1789, is just a day and noth
ing more, in no way significant in fact, sim
ply and thoroughly an established 24-hour
time period filled with birth, deaths, break
ups, make-ups, biology exams and cancer di
agnoses, riddles and solutions, extraordinary
events and nondescript contingencies. It
would not be wrong.
But, it would not be a very good descrip
tion. And, if given the blunt choice at gun
point, knowing my answer ought be very
good and not simply mediocre, I should hope
to say something more.
While not inaccurate, this in no way does
justice to how we experience our role in his
tory. Our experience of the past is not as a se
ries of events, even: it is as a single moment,
the one we call 'now,' filled with traces and
echoes of what was. Some are explicit: the
history textbook has no problem presenting
timeline after timeline, translating the di
mension of time into the dimension of space.
Like all translators, the historians must wring
their hands, suffering for each bit of cultural
context lost as they whittle down the story of
the Byzantine Empire into a choice collec
tion of the most relevant facts.
But this is not the only way we experience
history. In fact, perhaps it is the coded way
which is more interesting: the styles of archi
tecture we admire, the figures of form in art
which were once innovative and now feel
somehow stale, the idiosyncrasies of lan
guages. If I may indulge one favorite exam
ple, one Italian word for a toilet, vespasiano,
is directly from the name of the emperor who
first began charging for the use of public toi
lets in Rome. Incidentally, some people also
know him for this one big amphitheater thing
he built, but his name is not attached to that
relatively minor accomplishment.
Today, then, may very well be just a day,
but we intuitively experience it as a singular
opportunity rather than a part of the endless
iteration of time. This particular day, then, is
not yet decided. It could very well be the best
day of your life.
Why does this matter? I may venture to
say that it is the only opportunity you will

ever have, no matter how meager it might be.
Your vote may not count for much, but "not
much" is better than nothing. "Not much" is
worth fighting for, and certainly not to be
thrown away, especially if "not much" is the
all you have. Every great accomplishment
the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the Civil Rights
movement, even the entire Bring It On fran
chise has been a product of this "not
much," as well as every blistering failure.
So, then, let us suppose you find the idea
that each day is meaningless, irritating. It is an
uncomfortable spot, by my lights. Hardly a
place to hang your hat, and certainly not
where I'd wish to spend any time. It is fortu
nate, then, that this riddle that is, the
seemingly objective fact that each day is the
same has already undone itself. Not only
is each day not the same trivially speak
ing, they are each different but the only
way to make something significant by our
own standards is to use the "not much" and
make a "something." No saint or sinner ever
had anything besides this, and even though
our acute awareness that today is merely a
day and nothing more is not quite wrong; it
simply is not telling the full story.

Emily is currently experiencing history as bats
do, namely, through echolocaton. Contact her

This particular day is
not yet decided. It
could very well be the
best day of your life.
