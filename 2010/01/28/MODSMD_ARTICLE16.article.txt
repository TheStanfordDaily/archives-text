## Old Enough to Vote, Old Enough to Drink (Alcohol) 
### Patrick Kozey 
Watching a live video feed of people
filing out of the House Chamber,
where Obama just finished deliver
ing his first State of the Union address. It's
causing me to question whether I picked the
right week to discuss the topic at hand. The
earthquake in Haiti, health care reform, the
state of the economy, and the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan all seem more apropos, but
Obama just covered all that. Plus, today is
my final opportunity to address you, dear
reader, so I think I'll take a swing at some
thing more my speed: the drinking age.
Twenty-one is an arbitrary number, let's
get that out of the way first. After a century
of constitutional amendments and lobbying
campaigns, it's easy to lose sight of that. In
1919, the 18th Amendment began the period
known as Prohibition. You knew that, right?
A notable exception to the ban was, "con
sumption," but hey, you can't expect law
makers to prohibit themselves from engag
ing in a vice. Besides, the period gave the
country a lot of great things, including a rise
in organized crime (and the subsequent
genre of the gangster movie), the death of a
fledgling American wine industry and
NASCAR (someone had to drive fast
enough to run the rum, what were they sup
posed to do on the weekends?). In 1933, the
21st Amendment was passed, repealing the
18th, and many a future liquor-store-owner
got a great idea for a name.
The drinking age then was 21, but why?
Regulating alcohol has always been a state
controlled issue, hence the tactic of amend
ing the Constitution you know, how they
freed slaves being necessary to do it. Each
state was now left with a question: what age
to set as the legal limit for alcohol purchas
es? Most chose 21 because it was the, "age of
majority," though Kansas was notably reluc
tant to sell the stuff at all. The right to drink
came to a person along with their right to
vote, making it an outward symbol of adult
hood, of citizenship. Later, in the midst of the
Vietnam War, Congress and the states saw fit
to pass another Amendment, the 26th. Rati
fied in 1971, it shifted the age of majority
down to 18, guaranteeing that those "old
enough to fight" were "old enough to vote,"
as the slogan of the day went. The drinking
age crept down with it, and by the mid-1970s
most states had dropped it to 18. Of course
it's more complicated than that. Just look up

3.2 percent and beer Oklahoma on
Wikipedia.
Then another contender entered the ring:
Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD).
It's hard to argue with the chosen cause of the
organization. Founded in 1980 by a mother
whose daughter was killed by a drunk driver,
the group sought to deal with the issue of
drunk driving in the U.S. Largely through
their lobbying efforts, the National Minimum
Drinking Age Act of 1984 was passed and
signed into law by Ronald Reagan, linking
federal highway funds to the drinking age. If
a state didn't raise its minimum age to 21, it
risked losing a large amount of money from
the federal government. Although the consti
tutionality of such the approach was chal
lenged, it was upheld, and it has since been
used to further force states to adapt their
laws on alcohol consumption (passing so
called "zero tolerance" laws on drunk driving
under 21 is one example).
So, what's it to me? Isn't this column sup
posed to be a space where I mix three parts
Anecdote, one part Insight and a dash of
Humor to create an enjoyable cocktail of
journalistic hoo-hah? Well, sadly I can't buy
a cocktail, unless it's a Shirley Temple, be
cause I'm 20. I could smoke, something
clearly linked to health concerns for both the
smoker and those around me, but I cannot
drink. I take issue with that fact, because, out
of a right-minded desire to stop people from
driving drunk, we as a country have ended
up with a policy that makes many a college
student guilty of many a misdemeanor.
The obvious rebuttal to my point? It
worked. Drunk-driving fatalities are down
since 1984. I'd respond, yes, but seatbelt use
is up, from 14 percent to 84 percent if you lis
ten to the NHTSA. Let's not pretend that we
really solved the problem. You want to stop
"kids" from drinking and driving? Let them
have the opportunity to do it in the open, to
be adults when they're supposed to be.
Plus, it's harder to get stupidly intoxicated
when you're paying 12 euro for a pitcher of
beer, instead of $l6 for a case. Europe taught
me that much.
Thanks for reading, folks it's been a
blast.
