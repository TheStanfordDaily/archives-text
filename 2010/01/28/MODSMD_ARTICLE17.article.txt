# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor:

As The Daily has reported, members of
the infamous Westboro Baptist Church will
protest Friday morning outside the Hillel
House. The group announced its arrival
ahead of time, not out of courtesy, but to gen
erate as much media attention as possible.
They will bring large colorful signs and mes
sages of hate for certain members of the
Stanford community. Their anger and con
demnation will be given in the name of Chris
tianity. We will neither recognize nor repeat
their messages here.
The Christian community at Stanford
fully rejects and opposes the hate that will
soon visit the front lawn of Hillel. Westboro
Baptist Church is not affiliated with nor ac
cepted by any Baptist denomination. They
are an isolated organization serving a system
of beliefs that perverts the message of Jesus.
While we are determined to prevent undo at
tention to their visit, we stand with our fellow
students who will be attacked verbally and
emotionally. We ask and hope that the event
does not stir up a similar response within the
student body.
Representatives from our Christian fel
lowships will join the peaceful gathering at
Hillel in opposition to the protest. However,
the majority of our members will not. Be
cause groups like these thrive on media ex
posure, we believe we should avoid reac
tionary crowds that are larger than necessary.
Thus we are holding a time of prayer during
the protest, but apart from it, on the third
floor of the Old Union at 8 a.m. All are wel
come.
Jesus offers hope and peace for everyone
it is not offered to only a select group, and
it is not offered in hate. On Friday morning,
we hope and pray that West bora's message
will prove as transitory as is their visit to our
campus.
