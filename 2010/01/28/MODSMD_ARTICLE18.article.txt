## DESERT DASH Card travels to Arizona, hopes to overcome dismal road record 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
Senior guard Drew Shiller might
have put it best when he said, "We
haven't won on the road, and a good
team goes out and wins on the road.
We haven't accomplished anything
yet when all we've done is win at
home."
So, as Stanford hits the road for
the longest stretch of its season
four games the team looks to ac
complish something. Victory, that is.
The Cardinal (10-9, 4-3 Pac-10) will
spend the weekend in Arizona, meet
ing the Wildcats (10-9,4-3) today and
Arizona State (14-6, 4-3) on Satur
day.
Stanford and both opponents are
part of a five-way tie for second in
the conference, so the significance of
these games won't go unnoticed.
"The opportunity is there, and if
we go out and compete every game
like we do at home, we'll have a pret
ty good chance to win," Shiller said.
"With four road games coming up
here, and Arizona is obviously tied
with us right now, it's a huge game, we
just have to put our best foot for
ward."
"We just have to start playing bet
ter on the road," he added.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins
agreed with his co-captain, but em
phasized that opportunity comes one
game at a time.
"I look at it as an opportunity,"
Dawkins said. "If we want to do any
thing special, we have to go out and
prove that we can win on the road.
So, [it's important] for our kids to un
derstand the importance of each one
of these games, take them one at a
time, just give our best effort. We're
starting to grow up, we're starting to
mature in a lot of ways, and I think
we'll really see it [in] the way we
compete on the road, so we're excit
ed about this trip and the opportuni
ty we have,"
In a season riddled with injury,
growing up has already been impor
tant for the young Stanford team.
Most recently, sophomore Jack Trot-

ter slid into a role in the post left
wide-open by the loss of junior Josh
Owens and injured sophomore An
drew Zimmermann.
"I think you have to give [Trotter]
a lot of credit," Dawkins said. "We
needed guys to contribute more than
they thought their roles would prob
ably be, and he's one of the guys that
had to do that especially ... I'm very
proud of him."
Arizona, though, has experienced
a similar growth spurt to get to 4-3.
The Wildcats have only one senior in
guard Nic Wise and one junior in for
ward Jamelle Home, making the ros
ter among the youngest in the coun
try. Wise uses his experience well, av
eraging 15.3 points per game, 1.84
steals and nearly 4 assists per game,
and Home consistently adds another
11.2 points and 6.5 rebounds to Ari
zona outings.
But, the Wildcats are led by one of
their youngest talents: freshman for
ward Derrick Williams heads the
team in scoring (15.6) and boards
(7.1), and boasts the conference's
second-best shooting percentage at
58.9 percent.
Dawkins knows that Williams,
and the whole Arizona roster, will be
a challenging opponent for the Car
dinal.
"I think Arizona is playing we 11...

and Derrick's a terrific player," he
noted. ''Both teams are young, but I
think both teams at this stage in the
game are a little older than their age.
We're almost halfway through the
Pac-10 season and more than
halfway through the season, and I've
told some of our kids, 'You're no
longer freshmen and sophomores
anymore, you're more like sopho
mores and juniors. You've gained a
lot of experience this year, and it's
time to play like you've gained that
experience.'"
With Williams in the paint, Trotter
will need to continue to fill the big
shoes that have been left for him.
But, the sophomore says his confi
dence is "on the upswing."
"When you play against a senior
like Schaftenaar [of Oregon State] or
such a highly touted recruit like
Dunigan [of Oregon], and you can
hold your own, it's definitely a confi
dence booster," Trotter said.
Trotter should be confident with
the conference's second-best scorer
and rebounder in Landry Fields (21.8
points, 8.7 boards) and standout
shooter Jeremy Green (17.5 points)
on the court to boost the Cardinal,
even when the sophomore can't.
But, Tucson contains the Pac-10's
biggest arena, with an average atten
dance of nearly 10,000, which may
take Stanford's struggles on the road
to a whole new level.
"It's a terrific environment,"
Dawkins said. "It's a great place, the
crowd has a lot of energy, and we ex
pect that. We've been in a few venues
that have been that way, where it has
been that crowds and unbelievable
support, and [that's] something that
we have to continue to face,
"When you go on the road, you
have to be consistent with your effort
and with your execution for 40 min
utes," he continued. "Going any
where on the road is tough, so you
have to approach it that way. You
have to be poised, you have to value
the ball and, probably above all else,
you have to really defend well."

GAME NOTES: Following two wins at home
last weekend, men's basketball will try to im
prove their record on the road. While home
victories have boosted the team's record, the
Card has lost the past five consecutive away
games. Arizona will present no easy an
swers, as both teams have identical records
so far this season.

Stanford looks to gain their first victory on the road this weekend as they head south to face Arizona tonight and Arizona
State on Saturday. As injuries have run rampant through the Stanford lineup this season, younger players have
stepped up and will have the chance to face an equally young team in Arizona, whose sole senior plays guard.
Shiller agreed, and said the Car
dinal was focused on the little things
in order to improve its record on the
road.
"The biggest thing is communica
tion, especially on the defensive
end," Shiller said. "Being on the
road, it is tough to play in other envi

ronments, especially at Arizona, so
we're looking forward to the chal
lenge. If we can do well on this road
trip [it] can definitely spring us for
ward. So, it's definitely important."
The trip is indeed important for
Stanford, potentially making or
breaking its success in conference
play. 'The challenge' tips off at 5 p.m.
on Thursday, and all eyes are on the
Cardinal to see how it fares.
