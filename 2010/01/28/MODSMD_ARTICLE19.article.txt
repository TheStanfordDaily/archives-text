Tonight, the Cardinal returns to
Maples to tip off a four-game homes
tand against the Arizona State Sun Dev
ils.
As the undisputed conference
leader, No. 2 Stanford (17-1,7-0 Pac-10)
looks to build on the momentum gained
last Sunday against an Arizona State
team (4-3,12-6) that is tied for fourth in
the conference standings.
Both teams are on winning streaks,
the Cardinal being 8-0 since the lone loss
of the season to UConn, and ASU with
a four-game run that has put its confer
ence season back on track. They are also
both coming off crucial wins last week
end, and confidence will be riding high
in both camps.
Though establishing a better record
in comparison to this time last year, the
Card had struggled to regain its early
season promise since Christmas. Satur
day's strong showing against the Ducks,
the nation's highest scoring team, looks
to have blown away the cobwebs and
could now launch them into the second
half of the conference season.
Five of Stanford's players scored in
double figures, including a personal
record of 30 set by sophomore forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
"I think the Oregon game was a good
step forward for us," said senior center
Jayne Appel. "It kind of brought back
the excitement. We played well, we came
out and we did what we wanted to do.
We had a lot of fun on the court I
think that was important for us.
"And I think it's going to be a similar
performance tomorrow," she added.
"We're really excited and I feel like
we're moving out of that funk and mov
ing back to where we're headed."
ASU's away win last weekend
against local rivals Arizona was no less
significant. Both came into the game
tied at 3-3 in the Pac-10, and were neck
and neck at 44-44 before the Sun Devils
could break free. With three players
posting double figures in points and sev
eral achieving career highlights on hos
tile ground, it was an important step for
a young team.

"They are a very aggressive team,
they work very hard defensively and
they have a young team this year, so it's
hard to know what to expect honestly,"
said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, who should at the very least
know about ASU's head coach Charli
Turner Thorne ('88), whom she coached
here on The Farm.
On past statistics, Stanford has a con
siderable edge, leading 47-11 in the total
record, and with a seven-game streak
stretching back to 2006. In fact, Van-
Derveer has never witnessed a home
loss to the Sun Devils at Maples, arriving
here two years after the single blemish,
in 1984.
Records, however, are there to be
broken, and ASU is 25-5 on the road in
the Pac-10 since the 2005-06 season. The
difficult part of that statistic, however, is
that three of those losses were at

GAME NOTES: Stanford takes on a fired-up Ari
zona State tonight, as the Sun Devils face the
Cardinal backed by a four-game winning streak.
Their record so far, however, does not set them
up as a tough opponent for No. 2/2 Stanford.

No. 2 Stanford hosts Arizona State tonight in its first game in a four-game home series. Following
two victories in Oregon last weekend, the Cardinal will push to remain on top as it enters the second
half of Pac-10 play. ASU will also enter confidently, as they come off a four-game winning streak.
