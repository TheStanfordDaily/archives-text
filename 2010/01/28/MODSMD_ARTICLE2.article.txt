# ON TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE
## 
### 
Below is a letter from Stanford running back Toby
Gerhart to the Stanford community regarding his
time spent on the Farm as he moves on to pursue a
professional football career. The message was deliv
ered to The Daily via Stanford Athletics.

To the Stanford student body, fans, and alumni:

My time here at Stanford has been unforget
table, from Full Moon on the Quad, to our
baseball team's 2008 appearance in the
College World Series, to our football team's huge
wins over USC in 2007 and 2009, and most of all,
the rebirth of our proud program with our first
bowl appearance since 2001. While we may have
fallen short of reaching the Rose Bowl or vanquish
ing that other team nearby during my four years at
Stanford, I leave here with the knowledge and con
fidence that my teammates will deliver a much
brighter future for you, the best fans in all of col
lege athletics. Throughout, you have been unbeliev
ably supportive of me and all of my teammates and
coaches, and it is that spirit which makes this place
so special.
I leave Stanford with a heavy heart, but the
friendships, life lessons, and great times that I expe
rienced here will never be forgotten. I am proud to
bleed Cardinal and will do my best to carry forward
the Stanford tradition of excellence wherever my
life's journey takes me.

Thanks for everything,
Toby Gerhart
