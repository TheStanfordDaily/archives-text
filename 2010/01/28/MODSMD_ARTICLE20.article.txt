Tavita Pritchard, Stanford football's starting
quarterback for the 2007 and 2008 seasons, has
been added to the men's basketball roster, as an
nounced today by head coach Johnny Dawkins.
Pritchard is best known for his game-winning
touchdown toss in the Cardinal's historic upset
of USC in 2007. He ended his career with 2,865
yards and 15 touchdowns through the air.
Having used up his football eligibility, the 6-
foot-4 Pritchard was added to a men's basket
ball team ravished by injuries. As the squad
heads to Arizona this week, it will be without
sophomore forward and starter Andrew Zim
mermann and freshman guard Gabriel Harris.
The two join freshman Andy Brown and junior
Josh Owens, who have missed the entire season
due to injuries.
Pritchard was a four-year basketball letter
winner at Clover Park High School in Lake
wood, Wash. He will suit up in the No. 42 jersey
for tonight's match at Arizona. Tip-off is at 5 p.m.
