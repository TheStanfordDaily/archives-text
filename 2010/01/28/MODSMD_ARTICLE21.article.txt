No. 1 Stanford hosted the Big Flip
Off men's gymnastics meet on Satur
day night and boosted their record to
2-0 with a win over California at
Burnham Pavilion. This was Stan
ford's second win of the season over
its archrivals, which scored lower
than the Cardinal on every event ex
cept the pommel horse to end nearly
nine points behind Stanford (349.65 -
340.85).
The team's first home meet cer
tainly gave them an experience to re
member.
"To have Burnham filled up with
our friends, classmates, and family re
ally helped us put on a good show,"
said redshirt sophomore and captain
Abhinav Ramani.
Redshirt senior and co-captain
Greg Ter-Zakhariants, who is also a
Daily business staffer, agreed.
"The crowd at our first home
meet was the largest I've seen it," he
said.
The Cardinal began the meet on
the floor with solid routines from
freshmen Eddie Penev and junior
Alex Buscaglia. Both scored a 15.15

to tie for first. Junior Josh Dixon also
put up a high score of 15.05 to help
Stanford get an early lead over Cal.
The Stanford men did not do as
well as they had hoped on pommel
horse, which was likely due to a fair
ly new lineup of inexperienced com
petitors.
"I think the excitement and
nerves got the better of some of the
guys," Ramani said. "We're going to
be working hard on fixing this and
proving to the nation that we have
the best pommel horse line-up."
Stanford gained their pride back
on the rings with standout routines
from junior Ryan Lieberman and
freshmen James Fosco. According to
the captains, Fosco promises to earn
even higher scores in the future as he
gains more experience. One of the
highlights of the night came from
junior Tim Gentry's ring routine,
which procured a 15.7 and aided a
three-point lead on the event for the
Cardinal.
"He's definitely going to be chal
lenging for a national title on that
event," Ramani said of Gentry.
Vault was another high-scoring
event, in which the team put up a 15.8
by Buscaglia, a 15.45 by Penev, a 15.2

by senior Eric Hergenrader and a
15.2 by Dixon.
Stanford stepped it up further on the
parallel bars, beginning with a great
set from redshirt freshmen Cameron
Foreman. Foreman led the team with
a 14.9, followed by a solid routine
from Fieberman for a 14.7.
On the last event, Foreman im
proved his high bar routine from last
meet and posted a 13.85. Gentry also
faired well with a 13.6. Buscaglia's
routine ended the night on a high
note for the Cardinal, as he per
formed some of the most difficult
skill connections in the world to
score a 15.25. He, too, will challenge
for a national title come April.
"Every guy did his job to make
sure we beat Cal and we posted good
enough scores to overtake them,"
Ramani said of the win. "I hope more
people around campus realize how
much fun gymnastics meets are and
will show up at our home meets."
The next chance to see the Stan
ford men in action will be the Stan
ford Open at 7 p.m. this Friday at
Burnham Pavilion.
