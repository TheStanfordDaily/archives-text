# Southern Challenge
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's
swimming and diving team (6-0, 2-0
Pac-10 Conference) has had an im
pressive dual meet season thus far.
En route to another undefeated
record, the Cardinal defeated three
top-25 opponents No. 16 Michi
gan, No. 7 Florida and No. 2 Arizona,
with the last win coming this past Sat
urday.
The 2010 campaign will continue
this weekend in L.A., as the Card
travels to face two strong Pac-10 op
ponents UCLA (5-1,2-1) and No.
9 Southern California (5-1, 2-1).
While both schools hope to chal
lenge Stanford, the Cardinal should
be able to pull out wins in both
meets. Both UCLA and USC's sole
losses came against Arizona, whom
Stanford soundly defeated this past
weekend at Avery Aquatics Center
173-125.
Of the two L.A. schools, UCLA
will pose the least significant chal
lenge to Stanford. Last year, the Bru
ins finished 41st at the NCAA Cham
pionships and do not seem to have
improved significantly since then.
Although they have a strong record,
most of their competition has been
fairly weak, with their non-confer
ence wins coming against Fresno
State, Kansas and UC-Santa Bar
bara. The Bruins will look to junior

Brittany Beauchan to pick up points
in the 100-yard and 200-yard breast
stroke.
USC fields a stronger team,
boasting several swimmers and
divers that have competed in the
Olympics and in world champi
onship meets. The Trojans also will
attempt to build on a strong finish
from last season, when they finished
ninth at the NCAA Championships.
To defeat the Cardinal, the Trojans
will count on strong performances
from Lyndsay DePaul and Flaley
Anderson, who won two events
apiece for the Trojans against Ari
zona.
Stanford will look to its high
powered trio of senior Julia Smit,
senior Elaine Breeden and junior
Kate Dwelley to deliver victory this
weekend. All three won numerous
events against both the Wildcats and
the Sun Devils, and will be instru
mental to the Cardinal's continued
success.
Smit, an Olympian and a world
record holder, will be especially key,
as she consistently delivers one or
two wins per meet and anchors some
of the Cardinal's best relay teams.
She has the potential to rack up
points in her two signature individual
events, the 200-yard and 400-yard in
dividual medley, and she will also
lead Stanford relay squads in the 400-
yard and 800-yard freestyle relays.
USC also presents one of the

country's best diving teams, posing a
stiff challenge to Stanford diving.
The Card, however, knows victory is
within its grasp senior Carmen
Stellar and junior Meg Hostage both
performed well against USC earlier
this month at the Bruin Diving Invi
tational in Westwood, Calif. USC
standout Victoria Ishimatsu will pro
vide the pair's main challenge as the
defending Pac-10 champion in the 3-
meter springboard.
However, Stellar did not appear
too concerned about what results the
divers will achieve against USC and

UCLA.
"It is important that these are
working meets," she said. "We're
dealing with anxiety and making
sure we stay with our mechanics
under pressure. It's good to be put in
these situations, it's just a learning
experience."
Head coach Lea Maurer also
spoke to her team's mindset going
into this weekend.
"We need to keep an eye on our
recovery," Maurer said. "[The swim
mers] need enough rest so they can
peak at the right time."

"Our goal is to make sure our
team races well and handles compe
tition under pressure," added fresh
man Megan Fischer-Colbrie. "We're
looking to see our times improve as
the season progresses."
While dual meets and the Pac-10
season are certainly important, they
pale in comparison to the Pac-10 and
NCAA tournaments at the end of
the season. According to Smit, each
meet matters most as preparation for
those tournaments, as well as away
to get a preview peek at the competi
tion. The fact that the team must

swim two meets in a row is also im
portant, as the end-of-season meets
require similar endurance.
"Since we first stepped on campus
this year, our goal has been to win
NCAAs," said freshman Rebecca
Hinds. "We know that can happen
and that's been our goal since the be
ginning."
"We can treat each meet as a dress
rehearsal for the bigger meets," Fis
cher-Colbrie said.
