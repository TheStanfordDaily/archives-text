# Embracing Texas

Around this time most years, the
women of the Stanford tennis pro
gram are headed off to the ITA Na
tional Team Indoor Championships
but not this year. This year, the
women are spending their time on a
road trip to Texas, facing opponents
they wouldn't normally play.
Team Indoors has proven to be an
up-and-down event for the women.
In 2006, they won the tournament by
topping the same Texas team they
face this weekend, 4-0 . They made
the semifinals in 2008, but lost last
year in the first round to then-No. 14
Notre Dame, The team decided that
this year, the time could be used in a
more effective way.
"We're skipping Indoors because
of hassle," said senior captain Lind
say Burdette, "We wanted to use the
time to create more team unity; plus,
our conference is plenty good. We
didn't feel the need to go to Wiscon
sin when we end up playing the Pac
-10 anyway."
Another consideration is the
amount of matches played during
the season. The NCAA only allows
each player to participate in a certain
amount of league matches, while the
ITA Team Indoors requires that in
addition to those main draw match
es, each team plays two qualifying
matches. By avoiding spending those
matches on Indoors, Stanford is able
to use them where they want. This
year, those extra matches saved are
being used to help ease the team into
the season.
"Even if things are better this year
[than last year], it's still a great move
for us to have a couple matches
big trips like Texas to kind of get
everybody back into the swing of
super positive team unity and just get
confident again that we're the best,"
Burdette said. "You have to believe it
first before you can go out there and
show it."

Indoors can be a little over
whelming for new players. With its
high level of competition early in the
team's season, a poor performance
can create a bad mindset for the re
mainder of the year. Last year's early
exit created a poor mindset that hurt
the team, but a strong start could
have boosted them throughout the
rest of the season. Junior Hilary
Barte remembers too well her fresh
man experience at Indoors.
"Indoors is kind of a madhouse,"
Barte said. "I know freshman year
there was the first time I'd seen the
national competition and just kind of

what the other top teams look like."
While a few more games to ease
into the season can only help, many
of the upperclassmen say that this
year's team vibe is already amazing.
"There is just that extra spark
with the team this year," Burdette
said. "It's really hard to articulate or
put your finger on, but it is there.
We're not cocky, but we think we
have everything it takes to be num
ber one and take the national cham
pionship."

Stanford women's tennis jumpstarted 2010 as a split team last weekend, as
some competed in Las Vegas at the Freeman Memorial Championships and
others traveled to Indian Wells, Calif, for the NCTC Classic.
