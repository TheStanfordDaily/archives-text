## Author Maxine Hong Kingston switches to poetry 
### CAROLINE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Renowned Chinese American author Maxine Hong
Kingston read sections from an unpublished poem at the
Stanford Humanities Center last night, providing her
audience with what she called a "world premiere" pre
view to her next major work, a 201-page poem.
Entitled "I Love a Broad Margin to My Life,"
Kingston described her poem as "the culmination of my
life's work." She said it was her attempt to answer all the
unanswered questions in her previous works, such as the
name of No-Name Woman in "Woman Warrior," and
what happened to the brother in "China Men" after com
ing home from war with post-traumatic stress disorder.
"He lies down on the couch and doesn't get up,"
Kingston said. "Does he ever get up? Do we ever really
come home from war?"
Kingston also explained her decision to write poetry
instead of prose. So far, Kingston has published three
award-winning novels and several works of non-fiction,
but has never published poetry.
"I've tried the big novel," she said. "What if poetry can
bring me a new world, can give me other answers? Who
knows what transcendental power poetry may bring?"
The excerpts that Kingston read displayed a deep self
consciousness, covering a broad range of experiences and
journeys both physical and emotional. Near the begin
ning of the poem she asks: "Am I pretty at 65? What does
old look like?"
The poem also describes her
experience in an anti-war protest in
Washington, D.C. on International
Women's Day of 2003. At the
protest, she was arrested for refus
ing to leave the street, and shared a
jail cell with author Alice Walker.
When writing the end of the
poem, Kingston said she was con
templating the deaths of various
friends, and began to meditate on
her own "existential choice." She
came up with seven reasons to live,
which are written into the poem. At
the end, however, she decides to put

away her pen, saying, "I shall
become a reader of the world, not a
writer of it."
After the event, students and fac
ulty lined up for a book signing,
many wishing that she had contin
ued reading.
"She's such a powerful speaker,"
said audience member Lily Xu 'l2.
"When you are listening to her, you
get caught up ... you stop thinking
about your own life."
Earlier Tuesday morning,
Kingston also attended the seminar
class FEMST 188N: Imagining
Women. She met with students who
have read her most recent novel,
"The Fifth Book of Peace," a four
part meditation on war and peace.
"When she came into the room,
the air changed," said audience and
class member M.J. Ma 'l2. "She is so

graceful and stately."
Kingston discussed with her
audience the challenge of writing
biographies instead of fiction, and
shared with the students her experi
ence of losing the manuscript to the
"Fourth Book of Peace" to the
Oakland wildfires of 1991.
Besides writing, Kingston has
also had a long teaching career, and
currently is an professor emeritus at
UC-Berkeley.
When asked what advice she
gives to aspiring student writers,
Kingston smiled broadly and said,
"Just write. Write something every
day, even if it's only one word. Let it
be the most beautiful word of the
day."
