# Groups protest fees bill
## Students respond to special fees reform bill, circulate petition for reevaluation 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
Student groups are continuing to react
to the special fees bill passed by ASSU
leaders last week that will put more
restrictions on groups' ability to grow
their budgets.
At last night's Undergraduate Senate
meeting and throughout the week
many group members, especially financial

officers, voiced opposition to the legisla
tion and questioned the effectiveness of
the new restrictions.
The legislation changes the process by
which student groups who receive special
fees can adjust their budgets from year to
year. Previously, groups were automatical
ly allowed to increase their budgets by up
to 10 percent, plus an inflation adjust
ment, each year before being put on the
spring ballot for approval. Now, groups
are only allowed an inflationary adjust

ment, but may petition the student body
for budget increases before the student
vote.

Student Groups Speak Up
Several student groups, especially
those whose funds come entirely from
special fees, oppose the new rule.
Minh Dan Vuong 'll, the financial offi
cer for Alternative Spring Break (ASB),
wrote a petition that circulated e-mail lists
earlier in the week, and that as of

Wednesday had 368 signatures.
The petition calls for ASSU to re
evaluate the bill with more student input,
claiming that the bill was written and
passed without adequate warning to stu
dent groups and that the bill "incen
tivizes student groups to overstate their
expenses."

Chair Anton [Zietsman] did send out a

care reform, increasing employment rates and the current state of the economy. He named job growth as his primary focus in 2010.
notice one week before the bill was
voted on, there were no significant ef
forts to involve students or student
groups in the formulation and writing
of this legislation," Vuong wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. He added that
since funding and special fees are
"highly technical," groups need addi
tional time to study the bill's impact.
Other groups echoed frustration
with the short notice before the bill's
passage. Makamae Kahawai 'lO, the
financial officer for the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO), explained that most groups
didn't understand the bill and its con
sequences, which she said was con
strued as tacit approval by ASSU.
"Quite frankly, comments made by
Senator Katz in The Daily regarding
the lack of student input is upsetting,"
she wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"People weren't 'screaming down
their throats' because no one really
knew what was going on."
Financial officers for student
groups, especially those that receive a
significant part of their budget from
special fees, were also concerned
about the bill's adverse effects on
group programming. Although the
bill was written in part to "slow down
spending" from student groups, many
financial officers explained that the
10-percent budget increase helps
them adapt to the rising costs of pro
gramming.
"Big-name speakers like the ones
we have brought in the past, such as
Salman Rushdie, Pervez Musharraf
and Sarah Silverman all have very
large speaking fees that rise above the
rate of inflation every year," wrote
Greg Gaskin 'lO, financial officer for
the Stanford Speakers Bureau, in an
e-mail to The Daily. He noted that the
Speakers Bureau's budget demands
have also increased recently through
their co-sponsorship program.
Vuong noted that ASB traditional
ly uses the 10-percent increase to
cover new costs, such as car insurance
for drivers, and to expand their pro
gram so that more students can partic
ipate each year as the organization
grows.
Tommy Tobin 'lO, financial officer
for Stanford Project on Hunger, was
"shocked" at the change, and called
the bill's restrictions "gratuitous."
"The whole [bill's] reaction to the
economic downturn is stinginess," he
said. "There are other options for
funding [besides special fees], but I
don't like the strings attached with al
ternative choices."
While some groups stated that
they would probably choose not to
ask for a budget increase beyond in
flation adjustment, those who do need

an increased budget can petition the
student body for approval. Whether
they ask for increases or not, each
group's budget is on the spring ballot
for student approval. Historically,
nearly all special fees on the ballots
are passed each year.
ASSU Senator Anton Zietsman
'l2, chair of the Appropriations Com
mittee, hoped the petition process
wouldn't hinder groups' budgets, but
would instead increase the control
that students had over student group
budgets.
"Hopefully, more group petitions
will lead to increased dialogue on the
campus about special fees," he said.
"The way it was expressed in the
petition was that the bill would effec
tively freeze all budgets and com
pletely restrict funding," Zietsman
added. "The purpose of the bill is to
sort of engage the student body and
make the special fees groups account
able to the funds they're receiving
from the students themselves."
Some student financial officers,
however, felt that the petitions
process might stop them from receiv
ing approval they would have other
wise had.
"We will most likely not go out and
petition for signatures," Gaskin said.
"Stanford students are very support
ive of student groups, but it is still very,
very difficult to get enough signatures
just to get on the ballot."
Kahawai and Georgia Andrews
'll, the treasurer for the Stanford
Band, both noted that neither of their
groups has had problems securing pe
titions for funding in the past.
In Defense of the Bill
ASSU Senator Alex Katz 'l2, who
wrote the bill, explained that its pri
mary goals were to slow the rapid in
crease of special fees, which have risen
from $96 to $ll9 quarterly, and which
Katz said "puts a lot of pressure on stu
dents."
If fees keep rising, "then the special
fees system isn't really sustainable
long-term," Katz said.
Winter quarter's refund rates were
the highest in the past seven quarters,
with more students requesting refunds
and a higher total amount requested.
The commonly heard concern
among student groups, however, is that
the bill will not address its main goal of
slowing the rate of special fees growth.
With the 10-percent growth limit gone,
if groups feel that they can succeed
with petitions and if they fear further
increases in refund requests and
thereby a diminished number of stu
dents funding their activities it is
possible that they could ask for more
money each election.
Katz said that since the process to
increase budgets will now be "more
difficult," he hopes that fewer groups
will seek increases and the special fees
will be reduced. But student groups
could see the increased difficulty as a

reason to ask for higher budgets, off
setting the benefit.
"There's a likelihood that special
fees will increase significantly with this
bill," Tobin argued. "If groups realize
that [the Appropriations Committee]
will give them hell and more could
come with students, they're likely to
ask for more money to make the
process worthwhile."
"Since the prospect of future fund
ing increases are doubtful, under the
new bill, student groups may overstate
their expenses rather than taking a
cut," Vuong added, though his charac
terization of the bill as causing a "cut"
is not strictly accurate.
The student body's history of ap
proving nearly all special fees on the
ballot may also add incentive for
groups to get on the ballot, despite the
extra effort involved.
"I don't think this bill will do much
to reduce the amount of money in the
special fees budget," Andrews wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "As long as the
student body continues to vote yes on
all the budgets presented to them, stu
dent groups won't have a lot to fear in
terms of losing funding."
The ASSU insists that the bill is a
step in the right direction toward curb
ing special fees burdens on students
and increasing accountability for stu
dent group budget increases.
"As is generally the case with VSO
leaders, they fail to see the big picture,"
Zietsman said. "They see the bill as it
affects them and don't see past that.
The bill is the first step, not the final so
lution."
Zietsman also emphasized that the
Appropriations Committee approves
all proposed budgets before they go
on the spring ballot, which will serve as
a "first check" against groups who
might take advantage of special fees
funding.
ASSU has also promised to make
changes to the refund program and the
petitions process to keep things under
control, although more specific plans
are still "in discussion."
"Last year was nothing short of a fi
asco," Zietsman said, referring to a
mix-up and a consequent extended
deadline for the petitions period,
which let even more groups get on the
ballot. "This year, the deadline will be
fixed."
The bill was re-voted on and ap
proved again at Tuesday night's Senate
meeting, where several student group
financial officers expressed their dis
satisfaction â€” which has not abated
since then.
"The senators have not resolved
the issues in the bill," Vuong wrote
after Tuesday's meeting. "They have
not adequately addressed how the bill
will prevent refund rates from rising or
how it will prevent exaggerated fund
ing requests."
