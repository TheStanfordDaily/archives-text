# Groups protest fees bill
## Students respond to special fees reform bill, circulate petition for reevaluation 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
Student groups are continuing to react
to the special fees bill passed by ASSU
leaders last week that will put more
restrictions on groups' ability to grow
their budgets.
At last night's Undergraduate Senate
meeting and throughout the week
many group members, especially financial

officers, voiced opposition to the legisla
tion and questioned the effectiveness of
the new restrictions.
The legislation changes the process by
which student groups who receive special
fees can adjust their budgets from year to
year. Previously, groups were automatical
ly allowed to increase their budgets by up
to 10 percent, plus an inflation adjust
ment, each year before being put on the
spring ballot for approval. Now, groups
are only allowed an inflationary adjust

ment, but may petition the student body
for budget increases before the student
vote.

Student Groups Speak Up
Several student groups, especially
those whose funds come entirely from
special fees, oppose the new rule.
Minh Dan Vuong 'll, the financial offi
cer for Alternative Spring Break (ASB),
wrote a petition that circulated e-mail lists
earlier in the week, and that as of

Wednesday had 368 signatures.
The petition calls for ASSU to re
evaluate the bill with more student input,
claiming that the bill was written and
passed without adequate warning to stu
dent groups and that the bill "incen
tivizes student groups to overstate their
expenses."
