# STATE OF THE UNION
## 
### ERIC MESSINGER MANAGING EDITOR 
President Barack Obama delivered
his first State of the Union address last
night before a joint session of
Congress, the Supreme Court and
other members of the government,
renewing his push for an ambitious
legislative agenda and calling for a
change in the tone and politics of
Washington to allow for its achieve
ment.
The President's address over
whelmingly focused on his domestic
agenda. Having established clear
courses of action on the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, and with less
need for congressional cooperation in

formulating overseas policy, Obama
kept his emphasis on economic condi
tions within the United States.
The President centered the early
part of his address around job growth,
a key concern politically and moral
ly at a time of 10-percent national
unemployment.
"I realize that for every success
story, there are other stories, of men
and women who wake up with the
anguish of not knowing where their
next paycheck will come from, who
send out resumes week after week and
hear nothing in response," he said.
"That is why jobs must be our number
one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm
calling for a new jobs bill tonight."
Laying out a diversity of approach

es for encouraging employment, his
speech put jobs front-and-center in
discussions of a range of economic
measures, from financial reform legis
lation to the administration's bank
bailout effort.
"Our most urgent task upon taking
office was to shore up the same banks
that helped cause this crisis," Obama
said to Congress. "It was not easy to
do. And if there's one thing that has
unified Democrats and Republicans,
and everybody in between, it's that we
all hated the bank bailout."
"I hated it," he continued. "You
hated it. It was about as popular as a
root canal. But when I ran for
President, I promised I wouldn't
just do what was popular I
would do what was necessary. And
if we had allowed the meltdown of
the financial system, unemploy
ment might be double what it is
today. More businesses would cer
tainly have closed. More homes
would have surely been lost."
The President, however, admit
ted that his administration had
made mistakes.
"Our administration has had
some political setbacks this year,
and some of them were deserved,"
he said.
Obama framed the argument
for urgency, and its connection to
national growth, in terms of inter
national competition.
"You see, Washington has been
telling us to wait for decades, even
as the problems have grown
worse," he said. "Meanwhile,
China is not waiting to revamp its
economy. Germany is not waiting.
India is not waiting. These nations
they're not standing still. These
nations aren't playing for second
place. They're putting more
emphasis on math and science.
They're rebuilding their infra
structure. They're making serious
investments in clean energy
because they want those jobs."
"Well, I do not accept second
place for the United States of
America," he continued. "As hard
as it may be, as uncomfortable and
contentious as the debates may
become, it's time to get serious
about fixing the problems that are
hampering our growth."
The President also proceeded
to push for the passage of health
care legislation, which has been
embattled in its final stages
even after passage of bills in both
the House and Senate â€”by the
concerns of congressional
Democrats.
"This is a complex issue, and
the longer it was debated, the
more skeptical people became," he
said. "I take my share of the blame
for not explaining it more clearly
to the American people. And I
know that with all the lobbying
and horse-trading, the process left
most Americans wondering,
'What's in it for me?' But I also
know this problem is not going
away."
"So, as temperatures cool, I
want everyone to take another
look at the plan we've proposed ..
. Here's what I ask Congress,
though: Don't walk away from
reform. Not now. Not when we are
so close. Let us find away to come
together and finish the job for the
American people. Let's get it
done,"
The President also admonished
Congress for the tone of debate
and partisan intransigence, saying
that "common sense," which he
called a "novel concept," had to
make its return.

"So, no, I will not give up on
trying to change the tone of our
politics. I know it's an election
year. And after last week, it's clear
that campaign fever has come
even earlier than usual. But we
still need to govern," he said.
"To Democrats, I would remind
you that we still have the largest
majority in decades, and the peo
ple expect us to solve problems,
not run for the hills," he contin
ued. "And if the Republican lead
ership is going to insist that 60
votes in the Senate are required to
do any business at all in this town
a supermajority then the
responsibility to govern is now
yours as well. Just saying no to
everything may be good short
term politics, but it's not leader
ship. We were sent here to serve
our citizens, not our ambitions. So
let's show the American people
that we can do it together."
Obama additionally renewed
his stated commitment to end the
"don't ask, don't tell" policy in the
American armed services, a source
of sharp criticism from the left
wing of his party after a year of
inaction.
"This year, I will work with
Congress and our military to final
ly repeal the law that denies gay
Americans the right to serve the
country they love because of who
they are," he said, to the applause
of, among others, Defense
Secretary Robert Gates.
Newly inaugurated Virginia
Governor Bob McDonnell deliv
ered the Republican response,
opening on a humorous note.
"It's not easy to follow the
President of the United States,"
McDonnell said. "And my twin 18-
year-old boys have added to the
pressure, by giving me exactly 10
minutes to finish before they leave
to go watch Sports Center."
McDonnell, whose response
was published two hours before
the President's address, spoke
from the House chambers of
Virginia's Capitol building. He
expressed broad agreement with
the President's priorities, but
broke sharply with the President
on the methods of solving national
problems, criticizing the growth of
government in particular.
"Now, we should pledge as
Democrats, Republicans and
Independents Americans all
to work together to leave this
nation a better place than we
found it," McDonnell said.
Obama closed his address with
a mix of determination and inspi
ration, a close befitting an address
that saw the President attempting
to maintain the hopes invested in
his administration while persever
ing through the glacial pace of the
legislative process.
"We have finished a difficult
year," he said. "We have come
through a difficult decade. But a
new year has come. A new decade
stretches before us. We don't quit. I
don't quit. Let's seize this moment."
