## Economist Daley-Harris motivates students 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a small auditorium at Bechtel
International Center last night, Sam Daley-
Harris tried to motivate approximately 40
students to use their lives to make a differ
ence in fighting against the social problems
of today's world.
"[This talk is] not about the 75 million
children around the world who are not in

primary school," he said. "It's about what we
can do about it."
Daley-Harris is director of Microcredit
Summit Campaign (MCS) and founded
RESULTS, a grassroots organization to
combat poverty in the United States and
around the globe.
His talk, entitled "Microloans to Thieves
and other Revolutionary Acts that Demand
Championing," used microfinance as an
example of how to make significant social

change. The lecture rather rang as a motiva
tional speech about the potential of grass
roots movements to combat poverty and
other social issues across the globe.
Daley-Harris explained that mortality
could provide a nudge to spend life working
to end problems that need to be solved. He
even offered a rubric for students and peo
ple in general wondering what they can do
to solve social problems.
"The first thing people can do is to
stop believing there are no solutions,"
he said. "The second is to stop believ
ing that they cannot make any differ
ence. The third is to stop thinking they
have to act alone ... The fourth thing
people can do is to link to an organiza
tion that feeds you power... The fifth
thing you can do is to nudge the organ
ization to feed you more power."
He spent much of the talk telling
inspirational stories from some of his
colleagues' work, including
Mohammad Yunus and Ingrid
Monroe. The talk was named after
Monroe, who lent money to gang
members and thieves who, in turn,
ended up becoming successful, honest
businessmen. Daley-Harris also
recounted the founding story of
Yunus' Grameen bank.
The history, he explained, was nec
essary for the audience to be effective
in creating change around the world.
"If you can't tell a story like that,
you aren't dangerous yet. Until you're
articulate, it's kind of useless, and

you're not dangerous to the issues of
ignorance and apathy," he explained.
Daley-Harris spoke to The Daily
after the event and emphasized that
his beginnings in the field of social
entrepreneurship and microfinance
were not conventional.
"My first job was as a teacher and a
symphony musician," he said.
He took on the problem of poverty
after attending a lecture on ending
world hunger, and spread that enthusi
asm to a lecture on poverty he gave to
high school classes around the Miami
area.
He performed an exercise on the
audience last night that he used with
the high school students —he had
everyone who knew their congres
sional representative stand up and tell
the group. Twelve of the 40 people
attending tonight's event knew, and
Daley-Harris said that of the high
school students he had taught, 200 of
7,000 knew. This, he said, was the rea
son he got involved in social activism.
However, there was no grand plan
behind his efforts.
"It was a lot of trial and error, no
plan, doing the next thing," he said.
He eventually started a citizen
lobby group on microfinance. It
evolved over time into an impressive
repertoire of social enterprises over

the years, leading to his current
involvement in the microcredit sum
mit and RESULTS.
The event was hosted by Students
for Engagement in Activism and
Microfinance (SEAM) and co-spon
sored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
BASES and Fusion. SEAM is a small
group on campus, consisting of a core
of students interested in diving more
deeply into microfinance.

"I was drawn to microfinance
because it was the hot thing," said co
president Nick Noone 'lO. "I had no
idea what was going on behind the
scenes ... [We're] educating our
selves. In away, we're passionate but
naive."
Group members were happy with
the turnout and with the talk.
"[Daley-Harris] is probably the
biggest name in the U.S. [microfinance
world]. We're really lucky he came,"
said group member Charles Huyi 'l2.
Mitul Bhat 'l2 came to the event
out of interest in the microfinance
issue, having previously attended
other events like Mohammad Yunus'
visit last year and the Kiva founder
Jessica Flannery's talk fall quarter.
Bhat said that microfinance "seems
like an innovative and interesting new
area."
Daley-Harris also offered advice to
students interested in getting involved
in microfinance.
"Clarify your purpose in getting
involved," he said. "If it's to make the
hottest poverty-ending vehicle —go
out into the field. See it up close and
personal and not in the textbook
only."
