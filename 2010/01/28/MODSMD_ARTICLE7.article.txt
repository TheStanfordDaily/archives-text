## Haiti Relief Czar spot debated 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Wednesday's GSC meeting was
focused on the discussion of the creation
of a Haiti Relief Czar (HRC), a position
generated to oversee and coordinate
campus efforts to help Haiti and organ
ize a national student coalition in long
term support of the country.
The meeting also included discussion
of election regulation, approving a move
to allow student campaigns to start
today, and policy and funding requests.

"So What If There's an Earthquake
Tomorrow in Tokyo?"
ASSU President David Gobaud, a
coterminal student in computer science,
discussed both a project for free weekly
distribution of "affirmation bracelets,"
encoded with motivational messages to
boost self-esteem for students, as well as
a puppy-kitten study break a benefit
fundraiser held in White Plaza for Pets
In Need, a no-kill, community-based
animal shelter/adoption agency.
After Gobaud concluded his projects
updates, GSC members questioned him
about his attempt to hire a "Haiti Relief
Czar" for his cabinet. The main contro
versy lay in the fact that the Czar would
receive a work compensation of $5OO.
"It's a pretty bad-ass position even if
it's unpaid," said fourth-year geophysics
graduate student Justin Brown.
However, Gobaud explained that
there has only been one applicant.
Debate broke out as GSC mem
bers questioned Gobaud's right as
ASSU president to establish such a
position.
"So what if there's an earthquake
tomorrow in Tokyo?" asked GSC
member Noa Lincoln. "What proto
col do we go through to trigger those
positions?"
GSC member Aleksandra
Korolova defended Gobaud's effort.
"We received a large enough stu
dent voice to show that this is impor
tant to them," Korolova said. "David
is helping the student as a whole to
contribute."
In order to provide the $5OO com
pensation, it was decided that the
money would come out of Gobaud's
salary. The bill to decrease Gobaud's
salary to allocate cabinet funding for
a Haiti relief chair was unanimously
approved at last night's meeting.
"We thought of directly donating
the money to Haiti," Gobaud said.
"But I think if this person plans at
least one successful event then we
can generate much more."
"The idea that we're paying
someone to do a charity position just
doesn't go well with me," said doctor
al candidate in computer science
Adam Beberg.
According to Gobaud, there will
be at least five events from now to
the end of the year to be planned by
the Haiti Relief Czar.
"Hiring this person and paying
them will make them vested in the
position and work hard," Gobaud
said.

Campaign Regulation and Reform
Elections commissioner Quinn
Slack 'll brought up the issue of
campaign regulations, which were
briefly mentioned in last week's
meeting.
According to Slack, there are two
main changes in the revised elec
tions guide. The first change will
allow candidates to campaign during
the voting period, and the second
change will remove the flyer-limit
regulation.
Regarding the first change, Slack
addressed GSC members' concerns
by explaining that the joint by-laws
already contain language on voter
fraud.
"I'm going to tell candidates that
if they interfere with someone's vot
ing then that's voter fraud," Slack
said. "Since voter fraud is dealt with
by legislatures, I will report it to you."
"I will be very vigilant," he added.
"It's the elections committee's role to
deal with these violations."
Gobaud pointed out that voters
would have a hard time saying no to
candidates who may be campaigning
in front of their faces during voting.
To quell this concern. Slack said
that voters are able to change their
ballot at any time and can report the
incident to the elections commission.
He added that such situations exist
even with the regulations in place.
"We're focusing on rules that we
can enforce and not working on
rules that we can't enforce," Slack
said.
Beberg was in favor of keeping
the regulations.
"The current policy of getting
people to back off and focus on fig
uring out what to vote for may be
important," Beberg said. "And see
ing by yesterday's Daily's headlines,
special fees groups will probably be

rabid."
Slack suggested that there was no
way to stop this behavior, even with
current regulations. As for the sec
ond change, he said that green stu
dent groups would be enforcing the
limit.
"They [sustainable student
groups] want to make this their
issue," he said. "They want to seize
the mantle of the issue. They do the
enforcement and publicity. They can
be much more enthusiastic than we
are. We have a lot of other things to
do during campaign week."
"Whether or not we enforce a
limit, [violators] going to have to
cross a psychological barrier to not
be sustainable," he added.
Secretary and graduate student in
management science and engineer
ing Crystal Yin agreed in part with
Slack's idea.
"I think it's a good idea to have
the green student groups to enforce
the law," Yin said. "But I don't see
the need of removing the law."
Vice president Andy Parker 'll
brought up the possibility of allow
ing candidates to start campaigning
even as early as now if the regula
tions are removed.
"My understanding is that there
is no fair campaign at all," Parker
said. "There will be no campaign
week, so candidates can basically
campaign now."
Slack said candidates technically
are allowed to campaign starting Jan.
2.
"As for campaigning starting now
I don't think it would be a problem,"
Slack said.
GSC members unanimously
approved the first change in election
regulation and approved the second
change with a vote of six to three.
Concluding the debate, GSC mem
bers approved a regulation to allow

candidates to start to campaign
tomorrow in a vote of eight to one.
"More power to the people," said
third year law student and co-chair
Eric Osborne. "Let the execs race
start tomorrow!"

Funding Requests
The GSC approved money for
two student groups, including $2,010
for the Association of Chinese
Students and Scholars at Stanford
and $5,500 for an upcoming Chinese
New Year party hosted by the Hong
Kong Students Association, the
Chinese Women Collective at
Stanford and the Undergraduate
Chinese American Association.
Social chair Hariharan Vijay
requested funding for a graduate stu
dents' spring break trip to Las Vegas
to either subsidize the trip or provide
two trip coordinators. After short dis
cussion, GSC members shot down
the idea of subsidizing the trip.
"We changed our policy so that
we don't fund conferences," said
graduate student in electrical engi
neering Robert Hennessy. "And 1 see
this as a fun conference."
However, the vote to fund two
trip coordinators was tied with five
approved, five opposed and two
abstaining. Parker broke the tie in
favor of providing $3OO compensa
tion for two coordinators.
The GSC went on to unanimous
ly approve $1,500 for an annual
Valentine's Day Party to be held this
year on Feb. 12.
Toward the end of the meeting,
the GSC also approved $3OO for the
Graduate Student Programming
Board, $3OO for a Diverse Action
Committee (DAC) town hall meet
ing and $2OO for a DAC happy hour.
