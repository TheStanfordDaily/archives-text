## Haiti Relief Czar spot debated 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Wednesday's GSC meeting was
focused on the discussion of the creation
of a Haiti Relief Czar (HRC), a position
generated to oversee and coordinate
campus efforts to help Haiti and organ
ize a national student coalition in long
term support of the country.
The meeting also included discussion
of election regulation, approving a move
to allow student campaigns to start
today, and policy and funding requests.

"So What If There's an Earthquake
Tomorrow in Tokyo?"
ASSU President David Gobaud, a
coterminal student in computer science,
discussed both a project for free weekly
distribution of "affirmation bracelets,"
encoded with motivational messages to
boost self-esteem for students, as well as
a puppy-kitten study break a benefit
fundraiser held in White Plaza for Pets
In Need, a no-kill, community-based
animal shelter/adoption agency.
After Gobaud concluded his projects
updates, GSC members questioned him
about his attempt to hire a "Haiti Relief
Czar" for his cabinet. The main contro
versy lay in the fact that the Czar would
receive a work compensation of $5OO.
"It's a pretty bad-ass position even if
it's unpaid," said fourth-year geophysics
graduate student Justin Brown.
