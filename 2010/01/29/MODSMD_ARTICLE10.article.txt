This report covers a selection of crimes
reported from Jan. 20 to Jan. 26 as recorded
in the Stanford Police Department Public
Bulletin.

A series of bike thefts and medical-relat
ed incidents occurred during this time.

WEDNESDAY, JAN. 20
■ At 6:04 a.m. the arrestee was transported
to the Main Jail and booked for trespass
ing at the Herrin Biology Lab.

THURSDAY, JAN. 21
■ Between 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 20 and 7:30 a.m.
on this day, an unknown suspect(s)
entered a locked room in the Packard
Electrical Engineering building and stole
a laptop case and its contents ... in other
words, probably the laptop as well.

■ Between 6 p.m. on Jan. 20 and 9 a.m. on
this day, an unknown suspect(s) broke the
glass to the Anatomy building with a large
piece of concrete. The building, however,
had been abandoned and nothing of value
was inside.

■ Between 6 p.m. on Jan. 20 and 1:10 p.m. on

this day, at the southeast corner of Santa
Teresa Street and Governors' Avenue, an
unknown suspect(s) smashed the victim's
vehicle window and stole a GPS system
because even with a GPS, it took the sus
pect 19 hours to find his way out of
FroSoCo.

■ In an incident that occurred between Jan.
4 and Jan. 5 but reported on this day, an
unknown suspect(s) stole the victim's lap
top from a group study room in the Gates
Computer Science building. The victim
used the incident to justify his purchase of
a new iPad.

FRIDAY, JAN. 22
■At 12 a.m. on the corner of Escondido
Road and Comstock Circle, a non-injury
hit-and-run, vehicle-vs.-fixed object colli
sion occurred.

■At 4:30 p.m. on the previous day, an
unknown suspect(s) broke a window at
Chi Theta Chi. The incident was reported
to the Department of Public Safety after
the window was replaced.

SATURDAY, JAN. 23
■ Between 6 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. at Lot 29, an

and Roth Drive, the arrestee was trans
ported to the Main Jail and booked for
driving under the influence and an out
standing warrant out of Reno, Nev. Unlike
Vegas, what happens in Reno apparently
doesn't stay in Reno.

■ At 5 a.m. on the corner of Santa Teresa
Street and Samuel Morris Way, the
arrestee was cited and released on an
outstanding warrant out of San
Francisco.
