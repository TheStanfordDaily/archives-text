## EDITOR'S FAREWELL Volume 236 Farewell It's People 
### DEVIN BANERJEE President Editor in Chief Vol. CCXXXVI 
Think back to the first real friend you
made in college. For many, that person
was a roommate. For others, a dorm
mate. For some, perhaps a classmate. In any
case, that friend that person on whom you
could rely for comfort and enjoyment in your
new, unfamiliar environment likely
shaped your college experience in a funda
mental way.
I made my first real college friend three
weeks into my time here at Stanford. A fledg
ling member of the Stanford community,
confined to an all-freshmen dorm, I felt suf
focated. As has always been my case, I want
ed to learn everything about this place in
which I was to live and work, and the drama
of inter-floor relationships just wasn't doing
it for me. So, I sought out The Stanford Daily.
And it was there where I met Emma. A
year older than I, Emma "knew what was
up," so to speak. She could identify the peo
ple and groups of people who influenced
each corner of the community; she knew how
various actors interacted with one another;
she understood the factors underlying com
plex decisions and operations; and she knew
what was on the minds of our community
members. She was a news editor at The Daily.
The Stanford Daily is the largest, most
abundant source of information relating to
this place you and I call home. Read The
Daily, work at The Daily it doesn't matter.
The 120-year-old institution is the starting
point for understanding the intricacies of
your home and of those factors those peo
ple that influence it.
So, I was hooked. I wrote news for Emma
on a weekly basis, and soon my newfound ob
session had rapidly grown into something
much grander: the ability to read people and
understand them, and the chance to tell their
stories.
For the past seven months, as editor in
chief of this publication, this concept of peo
ple has been overwhelmingly powerful in at
least three ways. First, in every newspaper I
approved for publication, I tried my best to
steer its writers and editors toward context
that is, toward grounding our reporting in all
aspects, human and inhuman, of its subject
matter. This, I believe, is absolutely necessary
for all responsible news organizations to do
carefully and correctly.
The second meaning comes at a personal
level. I mentioned that Emma easily became
my first real friend in this community and

remains one of my best but ever since that
friendship began over two years ago, nearly
all of my most meaningful relationships have
been made among The Daily's staff. These
are people similar to you and me, who care
deeply about their community and, specifi
cally, about the information that circulates it.
I respect my fellow staff members and their
work more than anyone else and anything
else at Stanford.

And third, you, the reader, have been an
aware, interactive and responsible member
of our community during this time. The tips,
updates, op-eds and letters to the editor I re
ceived in my inbox on a daily basis were, by
themselves, evidence of this, and your vested
belief in thought, discussion and action fos
tered some of our most vibrant coverage.
You have been invaluable in further estab
lishing The Stanford Daily as the communi
ty's center of information and discussion.
So, as I hand The Daily's reins over to an
able successor, I implore you to grasp the
true weight of people. Do your best to con
textualize and understand your environment
and those who impact it. Cultivate meaning
ful relationships whenever and wherever
possible. And remember that your voice is
only lost among the masses if you choose not
to use it.
