## Congress should follow Obama's bold lead 
### 
Last fall during his campaign, Barack
Obama told the American people again
and again that he was running for office
because of the "fierce urgency of now." A
wide array of deeply rooted problems
plagued this nation and, if left unaddressed,
promised only to grow and worsen. Over a
year later, that urgency has not faded. Fortu
nately, neither has the President's resolve to
confront them.
In the wake of worsening poll numbers
and Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown's
election to the Senate, Obama faced rampant
speculation calling for him to back down on
health care, climate and other tough issues.
But instead of succumbing to the political
winds of the moment, President Obama used
the State of the Union address to strengthen
his call to pass key legislation while reassuring
Americans that every possible measure will
be taken to combat unemployment and re
store a healthy economy.
The Editorial Board applauds the Presi
dent for valuing his principles over political
expediency and disputes the popular notion
that the American people are out of step with
the substance of his policies.
Obama's emphasis on job growth clear

ly the centerpiece of his speech touched all
parts of the political spectrum, from correctly
pointing out that the stimulus bill saved the
jobs of thousands of teachers and firefighters
to embracing the Republican proposal to
eliminate the capital gains tax. His call to use
windfall taxes on Wall Street banks to help
community banks combined good politics
with good economics. If there were any prob
lems here, they were only in building expecta
tions for an area over which the government
has only so much short-term power.
Obama then used the jobs-bill as a spring
board to discuss climate policy, making the
salient point China and Germany are "mak
ing serious investments in clean energy be
cause they want those jobs" and that, as the
Editorial Board has pointed out before, "the
nation that leads the clean-energy economy
will be the nation that leads the global econo
my." But even in his emphasis on economic
benefits, Obama assailed critics head-on, cit
ing the "overwhelming scientific evidence"
for climate change.
On health care, too, Obama pushed for
ward with force, exhorting Congress not to
walk away from reform, "not now, not when
we are so close." Indeed, this administration,

in the face of a firestorm of opposition and
misinformation, has brought this historic leg
islation closer than ever before. Bill Clinton
did not even get his health bill out of its con
gressional committee.
Which brings us to our larger point: Presi
dent Obama should push for this bill because
it holds reform that Americans do want.
While polls show the public opposed to the
demonized caricature the bill has become,
further analysis shows the popularity of its
provisions. A 2007 Gallup poll, taken before
the controversy, showed 76 percent of Amer
icans supporting subsidies for low-income
families to buy insurance. In a more recent
Wall Street Journal poll, 89 percent support
requiring coverage of those with pre-existing
conditions, with 63 percent calling it an ab
solute must.
And those who view Scott Brown's elec
tion as a rebuke of Obama's plan are flat out
wrong. Sixty-eight percent of voters in
Brown's election support the Massachusetts
health plan, which closely resembles the
Obama plan. If anything, they just do not care
to pay for a national plan to extend coverage

when 98 percent of Massachusetts
citizens already have it. Brown won
because he ran a great campaign and
because his state did not want to
bear extra costs for benefits they al
ready receive. Not because Massa
chusetts citizens oppose Obama's
model of reform.
Similarly, in last month's Wash
ington Post/ABC News poll, 60 per
cent of Americans said they would
support curbing greenhouse gases
even if it cost them $lO per month in
electricity bills, and 55 percent would
even pay $25 per month. In key
swing states, including coal regions
such as Pennsylvania and West Vir
ginia, 60 percent of voters said they
would be more likely to vote for a
candidate who supported the cli
mate bill.
If these numbers do not sway re
luctant senators, we hope President
Obama's words will when he called
on Congress to resist the temptation
to "do what's necessary to keep our
poll numbers high and get through
the next election instead of doing
what's best for the next generation."
The American people elected
their officials to govern, not to run a
perpetual political campaign. Get
ting re-elected does not matter if
you are not accomplishing anything
in the first place. President Obama
just proved his willingness to stare
political problems down in the pur
suit of progress. It is time for Con
gress to follow his lead.
