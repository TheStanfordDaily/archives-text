# THE 						GAO REPORT, BELTWAY EDITION
## The 						Trials and Tribulations of a Daily Columnist 
### Shelley Gao 
Being a columnist can occasionally be
difficult. For those of us who are not
naturally talented writers and never
had any prior experience in journalism, the
creative process can be an intimidating en
deavor. I wish I could compose flawless prose
in half an hour. But, alas, writing is not my
forte. My professors would be so upset if they
knew I spend more time stressing over my
weekly column than doing the class reading.
Plus, there are the unintended conse
quences. People will judge you. Some will dis
like you. No matter what you write, there will
be those who disagree and whose interests
you offend. But columns are meant to take a
stand, of making and defending a point of
view. I guess the inevitable backlash is helpful
to developing a thick skin certainly a useful
quality for the real world. Another valuable
insight to realize early in life is that you cannot
win them all no matter how hard you try.
Then, there is the business of leaving be
hind a paper trail. Some of my cynical, or per
haps more politically astute, friends warned
about everything going online these days.
Once it is on Google, there it shall remain for
posterity. In 20 years time. Daily columnists
might just regret the "uninformed" or "ill-ad
vised" views that we publicly advanced dur
ing our gloriously liberated college days.
As an action-oriented individual, the
prospect of mobilizing constituencies, con
ducting face-to-face outreach and building
coalitions is thrilling. Writing, in comparison,
is simply just not as exciting. Indeed, the Farm
seems to be overwhelmingly populated by
implementation-driven individuals and de
fined by an innovative and pragmatic spirit.
Despite frequent lamentations about the
general apathy of the student body, a series of
impressive activist movements have marked
Stanford's history. A diverse number of issues
have been pursued, whether it is promoting
sustainable changes like a campus climate
plan, fighting for marriage equality through
the largest student-led effort in the state
against the California Proposition 8, or agitat
ing for faculty diversity.
Direct action has been the foundation of
all these movements. However, I have in
creasingly begun to appreciate the capacity
for opinion leadership to propel change.
Thoughts and ideas matter just as much. In
fact, they are the underpinnings of successful

advocacy and activist campaigns.
After returning from a quarter in D.C., all
I have wanted to be is a hermit. Hide in my
isolated E.V. apartment and disengage. It is
such an easy thing to do in this bubble, espe
cially for upperclassmen burdened by post
graduation planning. In fact, it is so easy focus
on our private lives, minding our own busi
ness and worrying about little else. But the
privilege of a Stanford education demands
more. It expects engagement and impact.
As students, we are all extremely qualified
to comment on the state of higher education
today, critique University policies, evaluate
academic and campus life guidelines and pro
vide recommendations. We live in it. This is
what we have the authority to opinionate on.
And the immediacy makes it relevant to each
of our lives.
Indeed, "The GAO Report" for the past
13 weeks has been focused on discussing per
tinent campus issues in Volume 236. And shall
continue to do so in Volume 237 of The Daily.
Although a number of issues have been cov
ered, ranging from international need-blind
admission to developing women leaders on
campus, (two of my favorite topics!) there are
many more on the agenda. Whether it is call
ing for a revision of the University's inconsis
tent application of policy on free speech that
limits student groups' ability to carry out po
litical activities, or ensuring that course syl
labi are available to all students, rather than
those registered on Axess during the shop
ping period, opinion leadership is needed for
many campus issues.
Writing this column is perhaps the most
challenging thing I have done so far in my
Stanford career. Yes. Winning two brutal
ASSU elections, dealing with insane campus
politics, pursuing independent research, etc.
have all been easier. While I am still estab-

lishing my own voice and finding the
courage to be bold, I could not have
come this far without the support
from our dear outgoing opinions ed
itor and my occasional partner in
crime, the delightful Zachary R.
Warma.

Shelley's column will now appear
every Monday in the new volume of
The Daily, starting next week. Contact
