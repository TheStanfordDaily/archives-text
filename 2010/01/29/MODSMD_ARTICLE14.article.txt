# WAXWORKS AND ROUSTABOUTS
## How It Ends 
### P.G. Mann 
"When the earth gapes my body to entomb, I
justly may complain of such a doom." —
Voltaire, "Poem on the Lisbon Disaster"
"And I can't fight this feeling anymore. Pve for
gotten what I started fighting for. It's time to bring
this ship into shore. And throw away the oars,
forever."
— REO Speedwagon,
"Can't Fight this Feeling Anymore"

My Sunday sing-along with the village
delinquents had just reached the coda
when there came a pounding at my
door.
The sound startled the young ne'er-do-wells
and sent our five-part harmony into a pitchy
mess. Everyone stayed on key, but they lost
their balance and fell from the risers into the in
flatable pool of hot pitch below. I have found, in
working with degenerate youth, that some
times all it takes to bring out the golden voices
slumbering inside their criminal bodies is a lit
tle tough love.
Take the Three Tenors, for example: all
products of the musical pedagogy of European
fascism. "Lucky" Luciano Pavarotti was a

cracker thief in Mussolini's Italy until the au
thoritarian youth outreach program fed him
the castor oil that brought his sweet tenor gur
gling up to the surface. Placido "Sleepy Sun
day" Domingo was bastinadoed 16 times by the
Spanish Falange before he could sing a melody
instead of jimmy a lock. And Jose "Career Loi
terer" Carreras would still be standing on a
street corner in the Barceloneta if Franco's
Guardia Civil had not tended to his musical
"reeducation."
But back to my story: peeved that I would

now have to refill the tub with freshly heated
tar, I marched to the door to rage at the intrud
er whose knocking had interrupted my stern
commitment to community service.
"Don't you realize that I am trying to rehabil
itate the malformed souls of our nation's youth
through the formidable spirit of music!" I shout
ed. "Account for yourself, villain!"
1 concluded my greeting with a swift flick be
tween the man's eyes delivered by my callused
bludgeon of a fingernail.
Only when his eyes failed to come un
crossed did I realize this villain was my twin
brother, G.P. (Gross Product).
"G.P., you rogue! My apologies, but 1 didn't
recognize you dressed in your clown suit. What
gives?"
G.P. was real biz-casual kind of guy. He
talked a lot about synergy, diversifying stuff,
stimulating investment incentives in things and
all the legendary nights out he had with his boys
in Palo Alto. So, you can imagine my shock
when I saw him swaddled in pink robes, his hair
tied in a knot and a skull tattooed across his

face.
"The end is nigh, P.G.! Death has
come to swallow our world, to gnash
our guts betwixt his jaws."
"That doesn't sound like you, G.P.
You're usually so upbeat and of limit
ed diction. What happened?"
"My real estate investments fell
through, so I've joined an apocalyptic
cult."
"Well, I'm sure you'll get another
investment opportunity," I told him.
"You don't understand. My pent
house vacation condos in Port-au-
Prince fell through all 15 floors below
them."
"Oh," I said. But as soon as I tried
to say something comforting, some
thing remotely optimistic, a little serv
ing of vomit would surge into my
mouth. My mind desperately searched
beyond the earthquake in Haiti for a
current realm of human activity that

didn't make me gag in despair. Politics,
War, Healthcare, Education, Econo
my, Jobs, Media, Hollywood. Environ
ment these banal terms, fired into
my brain hundreds of times a day, took
on a ghoulish appearance that sent me
cowering in the warm vat of hot pitch.
Not even art the cherubic voices of
my village hoodlum choir singing
"Waltzing Matilda" in the round
could draw me from the bilious depths
of my black liquid sanctuary.
My brother's return had sapped my
resolve to live among men. In the days
following his visit, I tried to carry on
with my volunteer work as choirmas
ter for incorrigible derelicts. But I did
n't possess the strength of will to cane
the sole of even a single foot. As a re
sult, the group's singing failed to im
prove and recidivism quickly replaced
rehabilitation. Larceny and gambling
returned to the choir room. By
month's end, my Sunday sing-alongs
had become wanton orgies of disor
der. There would be no great Pavarot
tis or Domingos made by me only
tone-deaf cracker thieves and donkey
voiced loiterers.

But, really, I'm happier here. I'm
with my twin brother Gross Product,
who now goes by Death Knell and all
his apocalyptic cult friends. We have a
lovely little stretch of hovel in the
trans-Bay tube midway between S.F.
and Oakland. I hear the view 300 feet
above us is simply stunning. We have
an ample supply of nettles and pass the
time telling each other stories of the
pending apocalypse and watching the
BART passengers zoom by merrily on
their crash course to inevitable disas
ter.
One thing, though. I can't write
these columns for The Stanford Daily
anymore. Internet connection is too
spotty down here. And ever since I've
stopped fighting this apocalyptic feel
ing, I've forgotten what I started writ
ing for.
But, please, I encourage you to
come visit.
