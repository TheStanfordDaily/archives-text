## How It Ends 
### P.G. Mann 
"When the earth gapes my body to entomb, I
justly may complain of such a doom." —
Voltaire, "Poem on the Lisbon Disaster"
"And I can't fight this feeling anymore. Pve for
gotten what I started fighting for. It's time to bring
this ship into shore. And throw away the oars,
forever."
— REO Speedwagon,
"Can't Fight this Feeling Anymore"

My Sunday sing-along with the village
delinquents had just reached the coda
when there came a pounding at my
door.
The sound startled the young ne'er-do-wells
and sent our five-part harmony into a pitchy
mess. Everyone stayed on key, but they lost
their balance and fell from the risers into the in
flatable pool of hot pitch below. I have found, in
working with degenerate youth, that some
times all it takes to bring out the golden voices
slumbering inside their criminal bodies is a lit
tle tough love.
Take the Three Tenors, for example: all
products of the musical pedagogy of European
fascism. "Lucky" Luciano Pavarotti was a

cracker thief in Mussolini's Italy until the au

the castor oil that brought his sweet tenor gur

street corner in the Barceloneta if Franco's
Guardia Civil had not tended to his musical
"reeducation."
But back to my story: peeved that I would

now have to refill the tub with freshly heated
tar, I marched to the door to rage at the intrud
er whose knocking had interrupted my stern
commitment to community service.
"Don't you realize that I am trying to rehabil
itate the malformed souls of our nation's youth
through the formidable spirit of music!" I shout
ed. "Account for yourself, villain!"
1 concluded my greeting with a swift flick be
tween the man's eyes delivered by my callused
bludgeon of a fingernail.
Only when his eyes failed to come un
crossed did I realize this villain was my twin
brother, G.P. (Gross Product).
"G.P., you rogue! My apologies, but 1 didn't
recognize you dressed in your clown suit. What
gives?"
G.P. was real biz-casual kind of guy. He
talked a lot about synergy, diversifying stuff,
stimulating investment incentives in things and
all the legendary nights out he had with his boys
in Palo Alto. So, you can imagine my shock
when I saw him swaddled in pink robes, his hair
tied in a knot and a skull tattooed across his
