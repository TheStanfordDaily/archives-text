## Violence coordinators shift culture 
### PHIL NOVA FMAV Chair Theta Delta Chi 2010 
As a fraternity man, it is often painful for me
to see the ways that some members of my
community treat women. Once I started
paying attention, I noticed that nearly every
woman I knew had a story, either personally or
from a friend, of being treated violently by a fra
ternity member. What's worse is that even though
only a small minority of fraternity members per
petrate sexual violence, the vast majority witness
it and choose to do nothing or even treat it as a
joke.
All too often, members of our community
perpetrate traumatic, violent acts against women
and continue as respected and socially active par
ticipants in Greek life. I may not have been part
of the problem, but I decided that wasn't enough
last year, I began investigating how to address
not only the issues of sexual assault and relation
ship abuse in the Greek community, but also the
culture of silence and permissiveness that sur
rounds them. To that end, I created Fraternity
Men Against Violence.
The mission of Fraternity Men Against Vio
lence is to show fellow Greeks how to create a
more positive fraternity culture that does not tol

erate violence against women. We believe that
most fraternity men are uncomfortable with the
violent actions of their peers, but do not know
how to respond and so stay silent. Perhaps they
will be ignored or, even worse, laughed at? We
will show this silent majority that they are not
alone, and that the power to end sexual violence
is in their hands. In my many meetings with fra
ternity leaders to date, I can personally vouch
that this mission has been met with universal en
thusiasm for these men, it has been a tremen
dous relief to see that they are not alone in want
ing to live in a more positive, respectful culture.
To make this desired cultural shift a reality, I
have created a new officer position: the Men
Against Violence (MAV) Coordinator. The
MAV Coordinator will be an educational re
source to his fraternity brothers on the realities
of dating violence and what to do if they see it
happening. To date, six on-campus fraternities
Theta Delta Chi, Sigma Nu, Sigma Alpha
Epsion, Kappa Sigma, Kappa Alpha and Sigma
Chi have opted to join our coalition and have
at least one MAV Coordinator in their mem
bership.

MAV Coordinators undergo a rigorous se
lection process assisted by the Center for Re
lationship Abuse Awareness and are re
quired to complete an eight-hour training
through the Center.As of Jan. 23, six of our seven
Coordinators have completed this training (the
remaining Coordinator has pledged to complete
the training as soon as possible and will work
under the supervision of trained members until
that time). Following a model similar to the Peer
Health Educator, MAV Coordinators will lead
discussion groups and provide educational pro
gramming for members of their own fraternities.
In addition, they will collaborate on larger initia
tives as part of Fraternity Men Against Violence,
We are currently working on our first campus
wide campaign in collaboration with the Inter-
Sorority Council, to be unveiled in February.
Our MAV Coordinators are: Michael Flynn
(Theta Delta Chi2olo),Pedro Gonzalez (Sigma
Alpha Epsilon 2011), Duncan Fisher (Sigma
Alpha Epsilon 2012), Sam Gould (Kappa Sigma
2011), Philippe de Koning (Sigma Nu 2010),
Camilo Cabrera (Sigma Chi 2012), and
Eric Clapper (Kappa Alpha 2011). For
those wanting to learn more about our
group, please contact any of our mem
