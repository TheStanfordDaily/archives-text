M J of love: "It's about
damn time."
For a band nurtured
in the same Parisian cradle
as the likes of Air and Daft
Punk, Phoenix has been
something of a late bloomer.
While their musical brethren
had redefined the electronic
scene by the decade's mid
point, Phoenix was languish
ing in the obscurity of hip
ster playlists, searching for
their definitive sound.
Critics leveled it all
against this middle-child of
French indie. Was it disco
revival or electronic indie?
R&B sympathies or robotic
tendencies?
Despite the ambigui
ty of it all, hipster scum have
remained loyal, gloating for
years and creating predic
tions for the band based on
the sheer brilliance of unsup
ported album gems like "If I
Ever Feel Better" and
"Everything is Everything":
Phoenix is going to blow up.
Fourteen years later,
the band has provided more
than a little justification.
(Insert "I told you so" here.)

On Tuesday night,
Phoenix found itself in front
of a sold-out crowd at the
majestic Fillmore, riding the
monster wave that has
emerged from the release of
their chef d'ouvre:
"Wolfgang Amadeus
Phoenix. " It took them a
while, but four albums later
the Versailles foursome had
perfected the electronic rock
formula; their show, which
sold out in three minutes,
boosted scalped ticket prices
to $3OO each and ended with
the crowd storming the
stage, was a only a reminder
of this fact.
After a listless open
ing performance by San
Diego punks The Soft Pack
a performance only worth
noting because the band had
a standing drummer
Phoenix entered through the
smoke with lead singer
Thomas Mars immediately
breaking out in
"Lisztomania" to test the
waters. The crowd respond
ed, overpowering Mars with
a voice of its own and shak
ing the building, which
lurched on its aged San
Franciscan foundation.

The high energy
and anticipation took the
band by surprise and they
tread cautiously in the search
of their comfort zone. At a
reserved pace. Phoenix
pumped off songs from their
two most recent albums until
a technical difficulty forced
improvisation. With the
drums incapacitated, Mars
changed the setlist and
the mood on the fly
resorting to a mellowed-out
version of "Everything is
Everything" as roadies
patched up the wiring.
Despite the throw
back, there was no doubt
that Tuesday night was one
to showcase everything
"Wolfgang Amadeus
Phoenix " had to offer. The
band fired off four songs
from their latest album, end
ing with an extended version
"Love Like A Sunset." For
the majority of the song,
Mars crouched down on the
stage hidden by darkness as
bandmates Laurent
Brancowitz and Christian
Mazzalai embarked on an
intricate and at times
awkward dueling guitar
sequence. Mazzalai proved
particularly gauche
j yet nonetheless enter
taining staring bug
eyed into the crowd,
protruding jaw and all,
as he ripped off guitar
scales with a swag
laced smirk.
The instrumental
interlude worked won
ders for the band and,
more than halfway
through the set, they

shed their reserved exterior.
With newfound confidence
and a license to jam, the
band busted out disco bass
lines for "Run Run Run" and
unleashed a robotic sample
as a tribute to their early
years of experimentation.
"Funky squaredance, funky
squaredance, funky
squaredance," echoed a
voice a la Daft Punk, before
Brancowitz and Mazzalai
took control and transformed
a nine-minute oddity from
the album "Untied" into an
on-stage masteipiece.
The end of the setlist
only served to briefly curb
the band's momentum, as
they picked up right where
they left off with the encore.

"If I Ever Feel Better" was
impressive, as the band pro
ceeded with a hard rock
interpretation of the song,
leaving Mars to loop certain
verses with the audience
mouthing along. And while
the band's last song was
largely predictable, "1901"
was still a spectacle as
Phoenix drew out the song to
a dramatic crescendo. With
perhaps the longest micro
phone cord ever, Mars ran
into the crowd to profusely
thank the Fillmore crowd,
before returning to stage for
some memorable last minute
antics.
Grabbing out
stretched arms, the lead
singer began to pull audience

members on stage while con
tinuing the repeated chorus:
"Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold
it." Following suit, the
crowd rushed to the front,
breaching the stage as if they
were breaking through the
Maginot Line.
With the enthused
crowd members forcing the
band to retreat to the safety
of the raised drum platform,
it was safe to say that the
French band had finally
found their niche in the
music wovld.Enfin.
