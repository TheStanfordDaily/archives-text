On Tuesday, the small
Roble Hall Theater
slowly filled up in
anticipation for Chuck
Rainey, who at one time was
heralded as "the hardest
working bass player in
America." The Ohio native
has appeared on everything

from the soundtracks of well
known TV shows like
"Sanford and Son" to the
albums of some of the most
important recording artists of
the last 50 years.
Although Rainey may
not be a household name, he
has collaborated with many

musicians who are, including
Aretha Franklin, The
Supremes, Louis Armstrong,
Quincy Jones and most
notably Steely Dan with
whom he performed on five
albums. This performance in
Roble marked the end of
Rainey's first visit to
Stanford, during which he
also participated in a Bass
Master Class on Monday in
Dinkelspiel Rehearsal Hall.
The crowd was a mix
of diehard jazz and bass fans,
along with a large number of
curious onlookers who decid
ed to drop in on the free
event and find out who this
Chuck Rainey character was.
These varied from the guy
two rows in front gushing
about how awesome Rainey
had been in the Masters class
to the guy sitting next to me
quickly scrolling through
Rainey's Wikipedia page
before the performance start
ed.
The big question in
many people's minds was:
how does a bass player per
form solo? Sure, musicians
like Paul McCartney play the
bass and have no problem
with solo shows; but while
McCartney is more well
known for his vocals and
lyrics, Rainey is first and
foremost a bass guitarist.
Because of that, he let his
bass guitar take the spotlight
for the most part. The stage
setup was simple —just a
microphone and stool for
Rainey. He sang and played
along with prerecorded tracks

of all the other musical parts,
save for the bass, which he,
of course, strummed live.
It was an interesting
departure from typical rock
concerts where the lead gui
tarist typically gets all the
glory while the bassist pro
vides the support. Here, natu
rally, it was all about
Rainey's thumping bass.
Rainey is clearly no superstar
singer, but his voice was
decent and pleasant enough to
accompany his electrifying
bass riffs.
Shortly into the set,
Rainey told the audience how
he likes to tell stories and
launched into a series of
them, interspersed with some
more songs. He preferred to
tell stories "his way" which
was almost evocative of beat
poetry. He supplemented his
storytelling with his bass gui
tar by alternately speaking
and singing to the rhythm of
his instrument. His tales were
mostly amusing and silly like
"The Signifying Monkey,"
which mainly focused on the
exploits of a monkey, a lion
and an elephant.
Rainey put on an inti
mate show, casually chatting
about hanging out with the
"fellas" back in Ohio and
their long summer talks about
women and life. The bassist
put on no airs. He came off as
a funny, unassuming guy who
just loves to make music. He
threw out a few quips
throughout the night, off
handedly remarking how
"this mike, by the way, tastes

terrible."
While Rainey per
formed a short, entertaining
set on his own, it seemed like
he missed the camaraderie of
a full band. He might not
have been quite used to the
autonomy of a solo artist; he
did mention it was a nice
change since he was used to
being one of the "side men."
Rainey closed with a
cover of the funky "Papa Was
a Rolling Stone," originally
recorded by The Undisputed
Truth in 1971, but made
famous by the Temptations'

rendition two years later. A
short intermission followed
before the night ended with a
brief, informal Q&A with
Rainey.
