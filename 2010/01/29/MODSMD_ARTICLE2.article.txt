## Stanford outscores ASU 46-19 after break 
### NATE ADAMS TOM TAYLOR 
When they scored triple-digit points
at Oregon last Saturday, it seemed like
the Cardinal women were ready to put
their recent string of underwhelming
performances behind them and play
more like the nation's No. 2 team. They
did exactly that on Thursday with a 71-
48 win over Arizona State, but only for
the game's final 20 minutes.
"My dad had a saying that it's not
the start but the finish and we started as
poorly as we have started any game
that I can ever honestly remember
coaching," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "We were just not
understanding what Arizona State was
going to do. When they came out they
were very aggressive, they got in pass
ing lanes, we turned it over, we were to
tally discombobulated offensively ...
and then we had to make a couple of
adjustments and run some different lit
tle things and obviously the second half
was a whole different story."
For the Cardinal (18-1,8-0 Pac-10),
it really was a tale of two halves. After
falling far behind the Sun Devils (12-7,
4-4) in the first period by as many as
14 points Stanford was able to
bounce back, outscoring Arizona State
46-19 in a dominant second half. Junior
forward Kayla Pedersen led both
teams with 23 points, while redshirt
senior guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
had a career-high 19 points. Senior cen
ter Jayne Appel continued her recent
offensive resurgence, earning a double
double with 12 points and 10 rebounds.
The game began slowly for both

teams, with each side racking up only
four points after nearly four and half
minutes. A Gold-Onwude layup made
it 6-4 at 15:44, marking the last lead that
Stanford would hold during the half.
The Sun Devils took off on a 13-2
run over the next five minutes, quickly
putting up a 17-8 lead by taking advan
tage of the Cardinal's missteps in tran

sition and their inability to recover the
ball after shooting. A three-pointer by
redshirt junior guard J.J. Hones with
9:33 remaining would make it 17-11
and bring the crowd back into the game
but only for a moment, as Arizona
State wasn't about to let up.
With seven minutes left in the first
half, the statistics revealed just how
much Stanford was struggling. The Sun
Devils had outshot them 25 to 14, out
rebounded them 14 to nine, and had
forced six turnovers while giving up
only one. A few moments later, the
score was 27-13. Junior guard Tenaya
Watson accounted for most of the dam
age, scoring all of her 12 points during
the first half.
With time winding down in the
frame, however, Stanford began to
climb back. The Cardinal went on a 12-
2 run to pull within 29-25 at halftime,
capped by a Gold-Onwude layup. De
spite the resurgence, it was the first
time this season that the Cardinal have
been losing when it went to the locker
room.
"I think it was a moment where
everybody looked each other in the
eye and was like Alright, we're down
15, it's going to be a stop at a time,"'
Gold-Onwude said. '"lt's [going to] be
one good offensive set at a time. We
have to come to the ball don't leave
your point guard alone.'"
The Cardinal did not let up after
halftime, with Gold-Onwude quickly
tying the game at 30 with an impressive
basket from behind the arc. A moment
later, Hones sent a laser of a pass down

NOTES: No. 2 Stanford overcame a sluggish
first half to dispatch Arizona State 71 -48 last
night. The Cardinal looks to continue its un
defeated start to Pac-10 play when it takes
on Arizona. The Wildcats are coming off of
a 20-point loss at Cal last night.

to Pedersen in the paint, who electri
fied the crowd with a go-ahead
layup.
From there, Stanford did not look
back. The Cardinal offense came to
life, quickly pulling ahead with a 23-
3 run to make the score 48-32 with
12:13 remaining. Pedersen account
ed for 10 of Stanford's points during
the run, while Gold-Onwude added
six of her own with a pair of three
pointers.
By the end of the second half,
Stanford had "rebounded" liter
ally in nearly every statistical area
in which it had been struggling. On
the game as a whole, the Cardinal
took 53 shots (just two less than
ASU's 55), outrebounded the Sun
Devils 40 to 31 (with 13 of the Cardi
nal's 16 offensive boards coming in
the second half), and had given up 14
turnovers, only one more than its op
ponents. Perhaps most impressively,
the Cardinal was deadly accurate,
shooting 54.8 percent in the second
half compared to the Sun Devils'
22.7 percent.
After a 100-80 win at Oregon last
Saturday and a thrilling come-from
behind victory last night, the Cardi
nal women are starting to gain more
confidence about how they are
playing.
"I'm really just proud of how, you
know, again we're down and nothing
is going well. [Sophomore forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike is] in foul
trouble, we're turning the ball over,
their really low percentage shooters
are scoring," VanDerveer said. "So
we had to make some adjustments
and people had to say, All right,
we've got to go to plan B, and people
did really well.'"
For Appel, the reigning Pac-10
Player of the Year, the feeling is

the same.
"We're having fun on the court,
just really playing with each other
and playing basketball. Hopefully
that just continues to go with each
game, as we get closer to the end of
the Pac-10."
The Cardinal will look to main
tain its momentum tomorrow night

as it closes the first half of the confer
ence season against Arizona (9-9,3-
5), who lost to Cal 73-53 last night.
The game is set for 2 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.

Senior center Jayne Appel fights through a foul during No. 2 Stanford's 71-48 win over Arizona State. Appel looked like
the All-American player she was expected to be, achieving a double-double of 12 points and 10 rebounds to help the
Cardinal roll in the second half. The victory moves Stanford to 8-0 in conference play and 10-0 at Maples Pavilion.
