# Let There Be Twilight: "The Harvard Lampoon" Takes on Stephanie Meyer

Your intrepid reviewer
first encountered the
novel "Nightlight" in
the discount section at the
Stanford Bookstore. In fact,
she walked past the display
thinking, "I can't believe
they'd sell that drivel at

Stanford oh, look, at least
they acknowledge it's cheap
romance wait, that's not
"Twilight," ha!" Intrigued,
she picked up a copy and sat
down to read. Two hours
later, she had maneuvered off
the couch, past the cash regis

ter, into her bed and fin
ished the book. It was an easy
read and it was entertaining.
The narrator, Belle
Goose, moves from Phoenix
to the town of Switchblade,
Ore. to live with her
divorced, window-cleaner
father. Her first day at school,
she meets Edwart (no, that's
not a typo) Mullen, a pale,
antisocial hypochondriac
interested in only three
things: computers, economics
club and storm-chasing. She
concludes, of course, that he
must be a vampire and that he
would make the perfect
boyfriend Edwart's aver
sion to the opposite sex (or
people in general) not with
standing. So begins the quest
of one Belle Goose to win the
heart of the blissfully oblivi
ous Edwart Mullen, dork
extraordinaire.
Along the way, she
encounters an epileptic and
prophetic classmate, a biolo
gy teacher, who uses labs as a
cover for extorting blood
transfusions for his ailing
nephew and Edwart's doting
but otherwise normal parents.
They have a chapter all to
themselves; the Mullens live
in a glass house with a grand
piano that nobody plays
(Edwart plays the triangle,
very loudly) and a large

wooden cross displayed
prominently above the stairs,
apparently for ironic value
(the Mullens are drumroll
non-practicing Jews). The
book is replete with such
scenes; cover-to-cover,
"Nightlight" is a barrel of
laughs.
And that is precisely
its problem. The writers don't
seem to realize that there is
more to good parody than a
string of jokes, however
funny they might be. The best

parody is a tasteful combina
tion of stand-up and pastiche,
preferably with a bit more
than a mere scaffolding of
plotline. Admittedly, Meyer
doesn't have a distinctive
enough voice to warrant pas
tiche ("annoying" doesn't
quite cut it), but great
humorists never let that stop
them. Look at how much
material Terry Pratchett man
aged to extract from
"Dragonriders of Pern," for
example. The unnamed

Harvard Lampoonists come
close, but ultimately, no cigar.
The verdict:
"Nightlight" is a borrow, not
a buy. Unless, of course, it's
50 percent off at the book
store.
