# Rainy Days

Growing up in Seattle, gloomy gray skies often 1
inspired my mother to announce "What a beautiful «
day!" So it was slightly shocking for me to
observe, during my freshman year, how a few gentle rain
drops could send a San Diego native spiraling into depres
sion. 1 personally love it when it rains at Stanford. Not so
much because the misty skies remind me of my natural habi
tat, but because I'm actually able to wear fun, rain-suitable
apparel here without being judged as a total wimp or mistak
en for a foreigner. The best rainy day essentials include:

1. Rain boots

At home, even a torrential storm complete with light
ning and thunder is not a good enough reason to abandon the
dreadful Birkenstocks and socks uniform. In fact, wearing rain
boots is 99.9 percent likely to elicit a sarcastic "Nice boots."
Check out the Marc Jacobs accessory store for the cutest pairs
they are surprisingly super-affordable. They were so cheap
that the pleading text I sent to my mom to mail them to me
after I forgot them at home (for the third time) spurred the
sassy response, "yes nina i will spend more $$ on box and
mail than ur boots even cost." Seriously, they are $3 more
than the rain boots at Target.

2. Umbrellas
Having grown up
in a household that
never owned an
umbrella, I'm a little
mystified by the
dependence that some
Stanford students seem
to place on these acces
sories. However, they
can definitely be a fun
way to add some piz
zazz to a rainy day
ensemble. MoMA
makes an adorable one
that's black on the out
side with sky and
clouds on the inside.
3. Gloves

Gloves are a critical investment if you ever intend to
bike in the rain unless you like the raw, red knuckles look.
I suggest the Winter Run Glove from Lululemon. Not only is
there a nifty little palm pocket for your key, the thumb fabric
is specially designed for nose wiping!

4. Bike covers

I'm all for the plastic-Safeway-bag-over-the-seat look,
but for about $l5 you can also get a nice little bike seat
cover from REI. It's not exactly trendy, but neither is looking
like you peed your pants.

5. Coffee mugs

Nothing is better than carrying a warm thermos full of
coffee on a rainy day. Then again, I'm from the city where
Starbucks is on every corner and fro-yo is about as common
as kohlrabi. (I don't know what that is either, but it was the
first thing that came up on Google when I typed in "obscure
food.") You can find lots of cute thermos designs at local
coffee shops, or look at the "I AM NOT a Paper Cup"
porcelain thermal coffee cup online to create a hipster/cof
feehouse lurker look.

So while the forecast may look dismal, don't despair!
Sporting Marc Jacobs rain boots, a modern art-inspired
umbrella and your so-sustainable porcelain paper cup not
to mention a dry butt and a snot-free nose you'll be sure to
be looking chic this rainy season.
