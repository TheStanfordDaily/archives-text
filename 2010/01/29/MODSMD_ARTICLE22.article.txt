The subject of this
week's food review is
fairly well known
among undergraduates, but
we love it so much that we
felt remiss going another
week without mentioning it.
Without it, our lives would be
bleaker, our figures slimmer,
and our interactions with Palo
Alto High School students
would be substantially fewer.
That's right, gentle readers,
we're talking about The
Village Cheese House.
For the uninitiated,
the Village Cheese House has
been a Palo Alto institution

since our parents were in dia
pers. Tucked away in a back
corner of the nearby Town
and Country, the Cheese
House's proximity to both
Stanford and Palo Alto High
School make for a large cus
tomer base of students who

go with alarming frequency;
although it's small, the place
definitely has a committed
cult following. And while
Katie became obsessed with
the recently renovated Cheese
House (whose employees
now know her), Evie's been
going since her days at
Castilleja School, when it
was a windowless maze of
disorganized aisles, strange
foodstuffs and signs exclu
sively in Dutch that looked
straight out of the '7os.

While the Cheese
House is a local tradition, you
don't become obsessed with
restaurants for their rich her
itage. What keep us coming
back again and again (and
again) are the sandwiches.
Oh, the sandwiches. One of
the best features of Cheese
House sandwiches is the
sheer abundance of choice.

There's no one-size-fits-all
Cheese House sandwich,
which makes writing a review
for them somewhat difficult.
Prices range from about $7 to
$8 a sandwich, depending on
the accoutrements you
choose. The bottom line is,
no matter your sandwich
preferences, you'll probably
leave the Cheese House satis
fied.
The roast beef is defi
nitely one of the Cheese
House's best items. While
roast beef is frequently dry
and leathery, theirs is always
freshly sliced and never over
cooked the kind of moist,
flavorful roast beef that peo
ple crave before settling for
the gross supermarket kind.
But we also love the roast
turkey. And Dutch crunch
bread is without a doubt the
way to go it's fluffy and
light, with the perfect amount

of crunch to the exterior. For
those who find roll-type
breads on sandwiches
unwieldy, the whole wheat
sliced bread is also excellent.
But by far the most
incredible part of the Cheese
House sandwich is the myste
rious "spread." While neither
of us knows quite what they
put in it, it's some mixture of
pickles, mayonnaise, mustard
and maybe even cheese. The
specific ingredients aren't
important, though. The result
ing hodgepodge of a spread
makes the sandwiches sinful
ly delicious; one of us has
even been known to eat the
Dutch crunch bread with only
spread on it, but we'll never
tell you which one. Don't
think about its mysterious
composition or the fact that
it's all going straight to your
hips. Just embrace the spread,
trust us.

In short, the Village
Cheese House makes the best
sandwiches around, hands
down. Since the renovation,
the atmosphere is a little
bland. And mistakenly going
during Paly High School
lunch hour can bring back
unfortunate memories of the
acne, braces and marching
band years but we promise
it's worth it.
