# Remote Nomad: Unsexpectedly Pleasant

The CW's newest pro
gram, "Life
Unexpected," is an
exciting departure from the
network's traditional niche of
teen soap opera fare: "Gossip
Girl," "90210," "Melrose
Place" and "Vampire
Diaries." Critics love to draw
comparisons between this
new show and WB program
ming of old, in the vein of
"Everwood" and "Gilmore
Girls." But the urban setting
and prominence of realistic

adult characters (Lorelai
Gilmore does not count as
such) indicate that the net
work has grown just as its
audience has.
Unexpectedly, Cate
and Baze, the brunette high
school overachiever and the
brunette high school quarter
back, had a one-night stand
under the weak protection of
a really old condom in the
back of his mom's minivan at
Winter Formal (the scene in
the Pilot that explains this
more poetically is fabulously
fast-paced without being
"Gilmore Girls"-style nause
ating). Even more unexpect
edly, they produced a blonde
daughter named Lux (yes, as
in Lux et Veritas the motto of
Yale. Maybe she'll be just
like Rory!). Cate never told

Baze about Lux, and Lux,
because of a literal yet sym
bolic hole in her heart, ended
up being bounced around in
foster care for seven years.
The show's pilot opens on a
horrible portrait of a foster
home, from which Lux is
preparing to emancipate her
self on the next day, her 16th
birthday. In order to do so,
Lux seeks out her birth par
ents for their signatures. What
ensues is bonding between
Lux and Baze over You Tube
videos, bonding between Lux
and Cate over the bond of
motherhood, and bonding
between Cate and Baze over
the desire to have sex with
the guy (who took your vir
ginity) years later when
you're actually good at sex.
Lux does not get emancipat
ed, and by the end of the sec
ond episode Cate has built

Lux her own room in Cate's
house.
First off, everyone on
this show is really, really
pretty;in fact, it's almost dis
tracting. But distracting in a
good way, because even
though their faults are clearly
on display, we can't bring
ourselves to hate them
because they are so damn
attractive. I also appreciate
that the scope of the show is,
for now, small but broad:
Cate has her fiance who is

not Baze; Baze has his guy
friends with whom he owns a
bar; and Lux has her
boyfriend and cabal of run
away foster kids. While the
rebellions of Rory Gilmore
and that pasty chick from
"Everwood" provided their
character arcs mid season, we
are introduced to a 16-year
old who skips school, wears
cool jackets and can sleep on
the street if need be. This
self-sufficiency is refreshing
for the CW model, although
one could argue that the
ineptness of Cate and Baze is
a more extreme version of
Lorelai Gilmore.
I find Cate and Baze
particularly compelling as
adult characters because,
through casting and writing,
the show has managed to cast

them accurately as very early
30-year-olds. Their profes
sional worlds are not corpo
rate or office settings, but
rather unique small business
pursuits: he owns a bar and
she is a radio talk show host
(the city choice of Portland
helps in this regard). They
feel very much isolated from
the real world, so the intro
duction of Lux into their lives
has narrative forcefulness. It's
not like Lynette on
"Desperate Housewives" or
Miranda on "Sex and the
City" trying to balance a
high-stakes professional
career and an aimless teen.
Instead, the high stakes that
Lux inherently carries with
her permeate into their tradi
tionally relaxed and effortless
worth environments.
Contrived as the sophomore
episode's subplot about Cate

having to deny her teen preg
nancy on her radio show, the
experimentation with the
symbiosis of the two worlds
shows promise for the show's
future.
If previous WB vehi
cles are about creating
teenager-parent relationships
onto which the members of
the teen female demographic
can project themselves, "Life
Unexpected" and its premise
reject projection and encour
age introspection. It's like

that time in kindergarten
when I pretended to be adopt
ed to get attention: I'm past
the age of pretending I spent

seven years in foster care, so
instead I look at my life and
ask, what are my priorities?
Am I self-sufficient enough?
Am I running away from
responsibility? Bravo, "Life
Unexpected." The juxtaposi
tion to "Gossip Girl" and
"ANTM" will serve you well

"...a one-night stand under the weak
protection of a really old condom..."

"...everyone on this show is really,
really pretty..."
