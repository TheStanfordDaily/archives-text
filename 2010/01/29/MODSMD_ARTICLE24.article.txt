## MEN'S GYMNASTICS Familiar foe for Cardinal gymnasts 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's gymnastics team
will have a chance to challenge its depth this
weekend at the Stanford Open. Many gymnasts
will make their debuts on Saturday against Cal
at Burnham Pavilion. Juniors Alex Buscaglia,
Josh Dixon, Tim Gentry and Ryan Lieberman
will have a weekend to rest for the Winter Cup
meet next Thursday in Las Vegas. Competing in
their place for the team and also as individuals

will be their underclassman teammates and
others fighting for spots in the lineup.
"With such a large team full of great gym
nasts, it's hard for anyone to make the lineup,"
said redshirt senior captain and Daily business
staff member, Greg Ter-Zakhariants. "It's even
harder for the freshmen, since they must prove
themselves to the coaches and the rest of the
team."
In men's gymnastics, only six men are al
lowed to compete in each event and the four
highest scores count toward the team score.The

men will have their opportunity to prove them
selves on Saturday and contribute to the team
score. The freshmen and sophomores will also
gain some much-needed competition experi
ence.
"Coming into NCAA gymnastics as a fresh
man is always a big change from the junior level
and it takes some time to adjust," said redshirt
sophomore captain Abhinav Ramani. "The
freshmen have been working hard and with

more meets under their belt, they're
going to be prime for greatness as
we near conference and NCAA
Championships."
Ramani, too, will be competing
this weekend after recovering from
hand surgery.
"Also, since none of the sopho
mores competed last year, every in
trasquad and competition serves to
show the freshmen that everyone on
the team is fighting for a spot," Ter-
Zakhariants said.
The members of the sophomore
class John Martin, Gabriel Al
varado, Cameron Foreman and Jor
dan Nolff all redshirted last year
and are ready to make their mark.
They attribute much of their im
provements to hard work and great
upperclassmen to look up to.
"We have a big junior/senior
class that has a great deal of compet
ing experience," Ramani said. "We
have dealt with a national title loss
and a win so we know what it takes
to be the best. We've been teaching
and showing the younger guys what
it is going to take to win another na
tional title and they've been really
good about trusting us and following
along with the coaches' plan."
The team's goal this week is to do
what they have being practicing in
the gym.
"As each week goes by we work
on refining our execution and im
proving out hit ratio," Ramani said.
"In a few more meets we'll start to
figure out our pace and we'll be able
to perform even better."
The meet will run from Friday
night until Saturday night with com
petitions between members in the
junior levels and will conclude with
the collegiate competition between
Stanford and California. The Cardi
nal men will compete against Cal
Saturday at 7 p.m.
