# Texas vs. California: Round Two
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
hree years ago, I wrote a col
umn comparing the states of
California and Texas in terms
of athletic supremacy. Not sur
prisingly and deservingly, California
won. However, there have been some
crucial updates to my criteria and I
think my rankings deserve a second
look. California folks shouldn't be get
ting too comfortable here.
In 2002, Sports Illustrated released
thorough, "scientific" rankings of the
best college sports programs in the na
tion. They had the University of Texas
No. 1, barely edging out Stanford at
No. 2. However that makes you feel,
we cannot argue.Texas 1, California 0.
I'm not a huge fan of USC, which is
located in California. But I actually am
beginning to like the Texas Long
horns, at least more than I did three
years ago. I went to Austin last spring
and loved the school and the town.
Texas 2, California 0.
Colt McCoy in the BCS National
Championship game. I am not disre
specting the injury, but how did it hap
pen? Texas 2, California 1.
Texas is greatly known as a jock
school. Stanford is known mostly for
its academics, yet we still have won 15
consecutive Director's Cups. Texas
has come in second a few times. Texas
2, California 2.
I once heard that 40,000 people
watched a high school football game
in Texas. Perhaps the number is exag
gerated, but I do know for a fact their
high school games are huge, once
pumping in $2O million for a high
school stadium. That's pretty cool.
Texas 3, California 2.
Andrew Luck is from Texas. Texas
4, California 2.
When I was in Austin (see point #2)
I went to a good old-fashioned Texas
Barbecue restaurant. I am dying to go
back. Texas 5, California 2.
If you take the NFL, MLB, NBA
and NHL, you have eight teams in
Texas and a whopping 15 in Califor
nia.The Lakers are also located in Cal
ifornia. Texas 5, California 3.
Interestingly enough, the NBA's
Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Ka
reem Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant and
Le√üron James all were born in states
other than Texas or California. No
points awarded on the basis of shame.
Texas 5, California 3.
Tiger Woods was born and raised
in California. While that was a "800
yah" in the last version, today it is an
"oh crap." Sorry California, at least for
the time being we cannot claim a point
here. Texas 6, California 3.
Jeez, look at that lead for Texas. I
might as well just stop here damn
them Texans. Well, I have to give them

some credit. They have proven over
the last few years to belong in the de
bate with California and even have
some decent arguments as to why
they should be No. 1. Ironically
enough, I am actually in Texas right
now as you read this column. Perhaps
I will return with a new feeling that

California is really the best state and
I was just being nice to Texas right
now. But for now, I give congratula
tions to Texas. The Cowboys did
make a decent run in the playoffs this
year while the Chargers fizzled and
were ousted by a bunch of rookies, so
I guess you can claim this one for the
time being.

Danny Belch counts a random barbe
cue restaurant as the same as 15 Direc
tor's Cups. Tell him how absurd this is at
dbelchl @stanford. edu.
