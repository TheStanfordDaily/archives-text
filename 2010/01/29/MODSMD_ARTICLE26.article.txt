# INSIDE OUT
## 
### MIKE LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
It's not hard to find the irony. The
No. 9 Stanford men's tennis team
will be hoping the rain stays away
this weekend, as it hosts the first
round of the Team Indoor Champi
onships today and tomorrow.
Despite the name of the tourna
ment, the first round is in fact played
outside at the Taube Family Tennis
Center.
"You just have to prepare as if it's
not going to rain," said sophomore
Bradley Klahn. "We've been
through the rain delay situation be
fore. You just have to prepare to play
the match, be ready to wait it out."
If Mother Nature cooperates, the
Cardinal will host UNC-Wilming
ton at 12 p.m. today and, if it wins,
will face the winner of the San
Diego State vs. Oklahoma match on
Saturday. The forecast calls for scat
tered showers this afternoon, with
the system clearing out by tomor
row morning.
"We're just thinking of UNC-
Wilmington, but if we win we'll
probably play Oklahoma," said jun
ior Alex Clayton. "They're well
coached and it won't be an easy
match."
The games are part of the ITA
Kick-Off Weekend. Stanford is serv-

ing as one of 15 host sites around the
nation for the second annual tourna
ment.
The Cardinal is the highest
ranked team in the group. Wilming
ton is ranked No. 57, San Diego State
No. 44 and Oklahoma No. 45. De
spite being a low seed in Palo Alto
this weekend, Oklahoma brings the
biggest name its head coach is
John Roddick, older brother of ten
nis star Andy Roddick.
If Stanford wins both of its

matches, it will advance to the Na
tional Team Indoor Championships
on Feb. 12-15.
Stanford is coming off a domi
nant victory over Sacramento State
on Jan. 23, the team's first regular
season match. The Cardinal had a
clean sweep over the overmatched
Flornets, winning 7-0.
On the doubles side, the No. 1 duo
in the nation, sophomores Klahn and
Ryan Thacher, easily won 8-4. Senior
Richard Wire and Clayton, the No. 2
team for Stanford, won an astonish
ing 26 points in a row en route to an
8-1 victory. The one blemish on the
match for the Cardinal was the fresh
man duo of Matt Kandath and Denis
Lin, which lost 8-1.
On the singles side, junior Greg
Flirshman, playing in the sixth spot,
delivered the clinching the point
with a 6-1,6-1 victory. The rest of the
singles lineup Klahn, Clayton,
Thacher, Wire and Kandath, in order
is not expected to change, nor is
the doubles lineup.
"I know the freshmen struggled a
little bit, but they will get better,"
Klahn said. "It was the first match of
the season and we got a long way to
go. If we just keep working and im
prove each match we will be fine."

GAME NOTES: No. 9 Stanford takes on UNC

Team Indoors. Despite the name, the first
two rounds of the tournament will take place
outdoors. The Cardinal is looking to build
off an easy sweep of Sacramento State in its
first home match of the season.

the most from the Sacramento State
match is not the game play itself, but
the rain delay it had to endure. The
match was initially scheduled for 1
p.m., but was pushed back to 3 p.m.
The teams finished the doubles and as
they were starting the singles, the
heavens opened up once again, delay -

ing the match another two and a half
hours.
Stanford is praying it won't have
to draw on its rain-delay experience,
but until it has an indoor facility, it is
out of the Cardinal's control.
The match today is scheduled to
begin at 12 p.m. If Stanford wins, it
will play at 12 p.m. on Saturday,
while it will play at 9 a.m. if the Car
dinal falls to Wilmington.
