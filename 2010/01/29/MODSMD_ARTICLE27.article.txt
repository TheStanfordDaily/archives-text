# Abolish the Pro Bowl

### 
Question: what do half of
the starting quarter
backs in the AFC have
in common?
If you guessed "a lack of ade
quate pass protection" and "being
abjectly inferior to Peyton Man
ning," you would have missed out
on the third correct answer
eight of the AFC's 16 regular
starting quarterbacks made the
Pro Bowl this season.
The reason for this unusually
high number of selections to the
AFC's All-Star team is "injury." A
total of three quarterbacks will
actually be suited up for the game,
which takes place the Sunday be
fore the Super Bowl Hous
ton's Matt Schaub, Tennessee's
Vince Young and Jacksonville's
David Garrard all three of
whom are replacements for origi
nal selections. One quarterback.
Manning, is not playing because
he is playing the next week in the
Super Bowl.
That leaves Philip Rivers, Tom
Brady, Ben Roethlisberger and
Carson Palmer, all of whom vol
untarily declined to play in the
game due to claimed "injuries."
These claims are questionable at
best due to the fact that all four
quarterbacks played through the
entire regular season and, in some
cases, first- and second-round
playoff games, emerging with
nary a scratch from their final
contests.
The only plausible explanation
is that these players and the
franchises that they represent
have no desire to play and risk in
jury in a meaningless game. After
a long and tough season, players
simply do not want to continue
sustaining damage to their bodies,
especially when the potential
risks of participation are much
higher than the benefits.
This issue is simply the most
significant of the many that beset
the Pro Bowl, the NFL's annual
equivalent to an All-Star game.
Traditionally played in Honolulu,
Hawaii the week after the Super
Bowl, the game has been beset by
rapidly declining relevancy. Last
year's Pro Bowl scored extremely
low TV ratings and ticket receipts.
To put it simply, players and fans
alike don't care about the game.
In order to try and make the
Pro Bowl a big deal again, the
NFL chose to hold the event the
week before the Super Bowl at
the same location. Sun Life Stadi
um in Miami. It was hoped that
the change would generate more
buzz for the game. Also important
was the fact that if the game were
held at its regularly scheduled
date, it would be competing head
to-head for viewers with such sig
nificant events as the NBA All-
Star Game, the Winter Olympics
and the Daytona 500.
The move was met with signif
icant criticism. NBC analyst A1
Michaels flatly stated that moving
the date wouldn't work. Various

ESPN and Sports Illustrated
columnists came to the same con
clusion and I am inclined to agree.
If you can't even get the players to
care, how can you possibly hope
for anyone else to do so?

Reasons for the universal dis
like of the Pro Bowl can be found
when comparing it to the (fairly
successful) All-Star contests in
the other three major profession
al leagues. MLB plays a 162-game
season and the NBA and NHL
both play 82-game regular sea
sons. By contrast, the NFL plays a
16-game season and with good
reason: every single game takes a
much greater mental and physical
toll on the athletes. In the context
of a baseball, basketball or hock
ey season, playing in one extra
game that occurs in the middle of
the season is not a great burden
indeed, players see participa
tion in these games as more of an
enjoyable experience than a
chore.
There is really only one possi
ble solution to fix the farce that
the Pro Bowl has become: abolish
the game altogether. The point of
the Pro Bowl is to honor the top
performers at every position in
the past season. Simply selecting
the Pro Bowlers as per the cur
rent system and then not playing
the game can accomplish this
goal. Indeed, the way the game is
conducted now simply diminishes
the honor of being called All-Pro.
When half of the starting quarter
backs in a given conference are
Pro Bowlers, it diminishes the
value of the selection and turns it
into a joke.
While this is the only logical
solution to fix this quandary, the
reality is that the NFL will proba
bly continue to conduct a game
that no one has any interest in. As
long as they can squeeze any rev
enue out of it, the farce that is the
Pro Bowl will continue. I antici
pate a day when scout-team play
ers are starting and every position
player in the league is a Pro
Bowler, right after the 30 non-
Super Bowl franchises have held
press conferences about break
outs of mass tendinitis.
