## Westboro: A Christian Response 
### Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship Ekklesia Intervarsity Graduate Christian Fellowship Intervarsity (Undergraduate) Christian Fellowship ReJOYce In Jesus Campus Fellowship 
As The Daily has reported,
members of the infamous
Westboro Baptist Church
will protest Friday morning outside
the Hillel House, The group an
nounced its arrival ahead of time, not
out of courtesy, but to generate as
much media attention as possible.
They will bring large colorful signs
and messages of hate for certain
members of the Stanford communi
ty. Their anger and condemnation
will be given in the name of Chris
tianity. We will neither recognize nor

repeat their messages here.
The Christian community at Stan
ford fully rejects and opposes the
hate that will soon visit the front lawn
of Hillel. Westboro Baptist Church is
not affiliated with nor accepted by
any Baptist denomination. They are
an isolated organization serving a
system of beliefs that perverts the
message of Jesus. While we are deter
mined to prevent undo attention to
their visit, we stand with our fellow
students who will be attacked verbal
ly and emotionally. We ask and hope

that the event does not stir up a simi
lar response within the student body.
Representatives from our Christ
ian fellowships will join the peaceful
gathering at Hillel in opposition to
the protest. However, the majority of
our members will not. Because
groups like these thrive on media ex
posure, we believe we should avoid
reactionary crowds that are larger
than necessary.Thus we are holding a
time of prayer during the protest, but
apart from it, on the third floor of the
Old Union at 8 a.m. All are welcome.

Jesus offers hope and peace for
everyone; it is not offered to only a
select group, and it is not offered in
hate. On Friday morning, we hope
and pray that Westboro's message
will prove as transitory as is their visit
to our campus.
