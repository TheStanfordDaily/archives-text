# Pro-choice? Stand up.
## 
### JANANI BALASUBRAMANIAN Class of 2012 
Since talking to The Daily about
the anti-choice display in White
Plaza on Monday, and reading
the article covering the occasion, I
have been doing a lot of thinking re
garding abortion rights and the state
of reproductive self-determination
more broadly. "Feminist" is one of the
first words I will use to describe my
self, without hesitation, and I am cer
tainly pro-choice. Yet, abortion is an
issue about which I am exceedingly
complacent. There are few people in
my immediate circle who have had
abortions, and those that have done so
have been able to secure access to ad
equate health services quickly and ef
fectively.
But the history of abortion rights
nationally is not such a smooth one.
Since the historic decision in Roe v.
Wade in 1973, anti-choice agents have
used almost every tactic imaginable
to undo the progress that we have
made in terms of reproductive free
dom. (I am oversimplifying legal his
tory here, because obviously the rec
ommendations of Roe were not car
ried out in full in most parts of the
country for years, and some regions
still struggle in this regard.) These in
dividuals' tactics have ranged from
mundane to absurd and from peace
ful to illegally violent. They have de
veloped an anti-woman rhetoric that
grounds itself in Puritanical values
and in demonizing modern medical
procedures with terms like "partial
birth abortions" or "neonatal pain
perception." Some who are anti

choice are passively so, and I contend
that they are not dangerous. Rather, I
believe the greatest threat to repro
ductive justice in this country is ac
tivists like me who are lulled into a
sense of entitlement and security.
Think of the Stanford bubble phe
nomenon only expand it to nearly
every somewhat liberal social circle in
the United States, and throw in an
issue that affects lives, not just intel
lectualism. As health care reform was
being so hotly debated in the legisla
ture in November, several of my peers
were following the dialog very closely.
Those who identify as Democrats or
leftists seemed relieved at the passage
of the bill in the House Facebook
statuses and tweets abounded with
exclamation points and joy. Yet, very
few stopped to question the cost of
the compromises that had been made
to effect this shift. The Stupak
Amendment, which passed along
with the bill, essentially denied abor
tion coverage to anyone lacking the
resources to pay for the services. Ac
cess to reproductive health services
already harshly delineated by race,
class, age and geography will be
come even harder to come by. The
Democrats made a compromise on
women's lives. I know there are the
moderates who will see this as a nec
essary middle ground, but I cannot
see the value of a middle ground that
strips the rights of a disadvantaged
group.
Seeing the display in White Plaza
made me more aware of my thought

less state and how I had unwittingly
allowed anti-choice messages to dis
seminate unchecked. I am not hoping
to change the minds of the students
involved in setting up the display, or
those who are otherwise part of Stan
ford Students for Life. Instead, I won
der what it will take to shock those
among us who support reproductive
freedom to stand up and speak for
those who cannot. Does it really take
the rape or exploitation of our loved
ones, lack of access to non-abortive
emergency contraception in urgent
situations or the deaths of young
women who must seek back-alley
abortions to save their own lives?
I ask that we use our powers of
sympathetic imagination and think
about the history of abortion that was
memorialized Monday. I will let go,
for the moment, of the fact that Stan
ford Students for Life placed the label
of "victim" on the abortions that have
been performed since 1973, for in
countless arguments with anti-choice
individuals I have found the person
hood debate largely useless. Rather,
let us think about the history of abor
tion and access to it as one of rape, vi
olence and abuse, but whose future
can be one of equality provided
that we stop taking for granted repro
ductive freedom and continue work
ing for our rights with the knowledge
that any concession in this regard is a
threat to social justice.
