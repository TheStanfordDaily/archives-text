# GAUCHOS EKE OUT WIN OVER CARD
## 
### CHRIS JUHNKE STAFF WRITER 
After suffering its first lost last week while splitting a
two-match road trip at No. 4 BYU, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team moved up to second in the national rankings.
Last night, the Cardinal fell in a thrilling four-set match in
Burnham Pavilion against No. 10 UC Santa Barbara (2-5,2-
2 MPSF) with the score 30-28,31-29,28-30,31-29. Tonight,
the No. 2 Card (3-2,3-2) is back in action in Maples Pavilion
against the No. 3 Cal State Northridge Matadors (6-1,3-1).
Against the Gauchos, the Cardinal lost as tough a four
set match as it possibly could, as all four sets were decided

MATCH NOTES: No. 2 Stanford fell to No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara in a
tough MPSF match last night at Burnham Pavilion. The Cardinal
outhit the Gauchos .384 to .336 and outblocked them 13 to six,
but could not win the crucial points. Stanford must regroup quickly
as it faces the No. 3 team in the nation tonight.

by the minimum two-point margin. Stanford
dominated UCSB statistically, outhitting the
Gauchos .384 to .336 and outblocking them 13
to six.
Despite the tough loss, the Cardinal will
need to bounce back quickly. The match
tonight, the second of six consecutive home
matches for the Card, promises to be a good
one, pitting two of the top three teams in the
nation against each other.
And after last weekend, Stanford is ready
for some hometown love to help it out. Playing
in front of crowds of around 4,000 people both
nights in Provo, the Cardinal fought its way to
a win in one of the matches, while suffering a
close defeat in the other. In all, five of the eight
total sets in the matches were decided by three
points or less.

"Close sets validate what I thought of the
team," said head coach John Kosty. "We have
guys on the floor who have played for four
straight years and it shows in those situations.
Even though the crowd was over 4,000, it did
n't faze us."
Stanford is looking to carry some of the
confidence it gained in its win over the
Cougars Saturday night into the match against
Northridge tonight. The Matadors, who began
the week tied with the Cardinal and Cougars
for second in the MPSF, are one of the best de
fensive teams in the country.
This provides an interesting matchup for
Stanford, which leads the MPSF in hitting
percentage, while Northridge leads the
MPSF in lowest hitting percentage allowed at
.227, led by All-American middle blocker

Jacek Ratajczak.
"We played against him one year already,"
said Kosty of Ratajczak, who is an imposing 7-
foot-2. "He's a good player. Being seven feet
tall, you get some different angles."
However, Kosty emphasized that Stanford,
when it plays its best, has the potential to suc
ceed against anyone.
"As much as we scout our opponents and
want to know our opponents, we focus just
as much on ourselves," he said. "We're back
home, back in comfortable surroundings
and we're going back to our serving and
passing game. We're going to serve and serve
tough."
The Cardinal is led by an assortment of upper
classmen, including Stanford's all-time leader
for kills in the rally era, senior outside hitter

Evan Romero and senior setter Kawika Shoji,
who leads the MPSF in assists per game with
14.26. These experienced players are comple
mented by many talented sophomores, includ
ing middle blocker Gus Ellis, libero Erik Shoji
and outside hitter Brad Lawson, who lead the
MPSF in blocks per game, digs per game and
service aces per game respectively.
"They're a big part of this team," Kosty said of
the younger players, "but they're just one fac
tor in our great team chemistry."
The Cardinal will need everyone to step up
tonight against the Matadors, who are 5-1 in
their last six matches against the Cardinal.
The match will take place at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
