### CHRIS JUHNKE STAFF WRITER 
After suffering its first lost last week while splitting a
two-match road trip at No. 4 BYU, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team moved up to second in the national rankings.
Last night, the Cardinal fell in a thrilling four-set match in
Burnham Pavilion against No. 10 UC Santa Barbara (2-5,2-
2 MPSF) with the score 30-28,31-29,28-30,31-29. Tonight,
the No. 2 Card (3-2,3-2) is back in action in Maples Pavilion
against the No. 3 Cal State Northridge Matadors (6-1,3-1).
Against the Gauchos, the Cardinal lost as tough a four
set match as it possibly could, as all four sets were decided
