# DUO CAN'T CARRY CARDINAL
## Green, Fields not enough in loss 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford put up a fight, but Arizona was too athlet
ic and the Cardinal was too far from home Thursday
night, falling to the Wildcats by the score of 76-68 at
the McKale Center in Tucson.
The loss continued Stanford's road woes the
team has yet to win a game on the road this season.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins and the Cardinal are 0-6
away from Maples Pavilion, not including a 57-52 win
over Virginia on a neutral site at the Cancun Chal
lenge.
The Cardinal (10-10,4-4 Pac-10) was soundly beat
en despite the fact that it outshot the Wildcats (11-9,5-
3) by a large margin, shooting 47 percent from the
floor compared to Arizona's mark of 32 percent.
Arizona was able to dominate nearly every other
statistical category en route to victory, though the
Wildcats scored 20 second-chance points compared to
the Cardinal's two, turned the ball over 10 times com
pared to Stanford's 18 turnovers and went to the line
18 more times than Stanford did.
"Some of those were just guys being in the right
place at the right time but they really did a good job of
spacing to put them in that position to get those
boards," Dawkins told the Associated Press in refer
ence to the Wildcats' offensive rebounding.
Arizona's ability to crash the boards may have
been the difference in the game even though the
final rebounding totals were 38 for the Wildcats and 34
for the Cardinal, Arizona grabbed 19 offensive re
bounds compared to just seven for Stanford.
Dawkins' squad was not surprisingly led by
the duo of senior forward Landry Fields and sopho
more guard Jeremy Green. Fields and Green scored a
combined 56 points good for more than 80 percent
of the Cardinal's scoring on the night. Fields filled the
box score with 31 points and 11 rebounds on 11-of-18
shooting, while Green finished the night with 25 points
on 9-of-20 shooting. Green's backcourt mate, sopho
more Jarrett Mann, had a solid game at point guard

NOTES: Despite outshooting Arizona by
nearly 15 percent, Stanford fell to the

Landry Fields and sophomore guard
Jeremy Green, who combined for 56
of Stanford's 68 points. Stanford will
now travel to Tempe to take on the Sun
Devils, who are coming off of consecu
tive home losses to Arizona and Cal.

Sophomore guard Jeremy Green was one of the two bright spots for the
Cardinal, along with senior forward Landry Fields, in Stanford's 76-68 loss
to Arizona. Green and Fields combined for 56 of Stanford's 68 points.


with eight assists and eight rebounds.
Despite the efforts of Fields and
Green to keep the game close, Stan
ford never posed a serious threat to
the Wildcats' lead in the second half.
Arizona went into the locker room
with a four-point lead at halftime
and the Cardinal would never get
closer than that.

The Wildcats were led by fresh
man forward Derrick Williams, who
tore up the Cardinal down low with
his quickness. Williams finished the
night with 23 points and eight re
bounds. Arizona guards Kyle Fogg,
Nic Wise and Lamont Jones all had
their way with the Stanford defense
too, using their speed to consistently
penetrate the Cardinal's man-to
man. Dawkins adjusted, employing a
zone for much of the second half, but
Arizona never had trouble maintain
ing its lead.
Best known for his play on the
football field, senior Tavita Pritchard
suited up for Thursday's game,
though he never saw action on the
court. The school announced
Wednesday that the 6-foot-4
Pritchard would join the team in re
sponse to the losses of sophomore
forward Andrew Zimmermann and
freshman guard Gabriel Harris due
to stress fractures. Stanford only had
five scholarship players available for
the game.
In a surprising turn of events,
Dawkins was also charged for a tech
nical foul in the middle of second
half with his team down just four
points. Dawkins was protesting a call
made the previous possession and
elicited the technical after stepping a
few feet onto the floor with an Ari

zona player in relative proximity.
"Coach was just trying to inspire
us," Fields said. "I think we just
have to respond better when that
happens."
Stanford will continue its search

for its first road win of the year on
Saturday when it takes on Arizona
State at Wells Fargo Arena at 1 p.m.
