# DUO CAN'T CARRY CARDINAL
## Green, Fields not enough in loss 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford put up a fight, but Arizona was too athlet
ic and the Cardinal was too far from home Thursday
night, falling to the Wildcats by the score of 76-68 at
the McKale Center in Tucson.
The loss continued Stanford's road woes the
team has yet to win a game on the road this season.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins and the Cardinal are 0-6
away from Maples Pavilion, not including a 57-52 win
over Virginia on a neutral site at the Cancun Chal
lenge.
The Cardinal (10-10,4-4 Pac-10) was soundly beat
en despite the fact that it outshot the Wildcats (11-9,5-
3) by a large margin, shooting 47 percent from the
floor compared to Arizona's mark of 32 percent.
Arizona was able to dominate nearly every other
statistical category en route to victory, though the
Wildcats scored 20 second-chance points compared to
the Cardinal's two, turned the ball over 10 times com
pared to Stanford's 18 turnovers and went to the line
18 more times than Stanford did.
"Some of those were just guys being in the right
place at the right time but they really did a good job of
spacing to put them in that position to get those
boards," Dawkins told the Associated Press in refer
ence to the Wildcats' offensive rebounding.
Arizona's ability to crash the boards may have
been the difference in the game even though the
final rebounding totals were 38 for the Wildcats and 34
for the Cardinal, Arizona grabbed 19 offensive re
bounds compared to just seven for Stanford.
Dawkins' squad was not surprisingly led by
the duo of senior forward Landry Fields and sopho
more guard Jeremy Green. Fields and Green scored a
combined 56 points good for more than 80 percent
of the Cardinal's scoring on the night. Fields filled the
box score with 31 points and 11 rebounds on 11-of-18
shooting, while Green finished the night with 25 points
on 9-of-20 shooting. Green's backcourt mate, sopho
more Jarrett Mann, had a solid game at point guard
