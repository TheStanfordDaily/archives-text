## Access Granted Whitney: Residences accessible for all 
### CHRISTINE McFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
On Nov. 6, The Daily published a piece
focusing on two specific cases in which dis
abled students said they experienced difficul
ties adjusting to their on-campus living situa
tions. For the new quarter, The Daily fol
lowed up with a look back at these individual
cases after speaking with administrators
from the Student Housing Department.

For Nicole Torcolini 'l2, a blind student
living in Branner, and Stacy Bennett, a
Stanford alumna living in a Floskins Court
apartment, navigating the places they call
home can be very difficult.
In an interview with The Daily in
November, Torcolini explained how hap
hazard bikes parked in Branner's walkways
and inconsistently locked double-doors
made walks to her dorm room a dangerous
and trying task. Bennett, who lives with cur
rent Stanford medical student Erik Corona,
reported that parts of the buildings in
Hoskins Court were inaccessible to wheel
chair-bound individuals among them the
front lobby, which lacked ramp access. She
also said then that her bathroom was too
small to fit her powerchair.
Once the article was published, Corona
wrote to The Daily in an e-mail that he and
Bennett received immediate attention on
the issue. Yet when they discussed their situ
ation with officials, they were asked why
they hadn't originally listed their complaints
when first moving in.
"To this I replied: 'Our special accommo
dations request was lost," Corona said.
"Second, I don't think it's fair to expect
someone to tell you beforehand that we
would like to use the bathroom in privacy,
or participate in housing events that our
house dues are being used to pay for, or get
the mail. We were told this place was wheel
chair accessible, so naturally, we thought
entering the kitchen or using the restroom
in privacy would not be an issue'."
While Corona went on to state that
administrators expressed concern over their
situation and eventually agreed to major
renovations, he and Bennett eventually con
cluded that it was in their best interest to
find off-campus housing.
Executive Director of Student Housing
Rodger Whitney acknowledges that dis
abled accessibility is a campus-wide issue,
but maintained that his department goes
through "great lengths to meet the individ
ual needs of our residents and improve
accessibility in our buildings every year."
According to him, the University, when

compared to other institutions, is a frontrun
ner in providing disabled accessibility.
"In comparison with our colleagues in
the various Ivy [League] Universities, for
example, where the preponderance of their
facilities are usually much older than ours,
built before the requirements of modern
codes and thus much less conducive to
being made accessible, we are often able to
offer students much more freedom of
choice with our newer buildings and recent
renovations at Stanford," Whitney wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.

Housing's Response
Although the Housing Department did
not discuss individual situations out of a
stated desire to respect the privacy of those
students involved, Whitney said that when
students brought issues of accessibility to his
office's attention, work was done directly
with the Student Disability Resource
Center (SDRC) to fix the concerns.
Potential options for change include physi
cal renovation to living quarters, program
ming adjustments or the possibility of reas
signment.
"We often make extensive changes to a
room to accommodate students, including,
but not limited to, adding electric door
openers, bed shakers ramps and horn/strobe
emergency alarms (items we now keep in
stock for faster response)," Whitney said.
Whitney stressed how imperative it is for
incoming students to make their living
requirements known to Housing ahead of
time usually through the Office of
Accessible Education before they move
in. He noted that requests not made in time
or put in at the last minute reduce the solu
tions available, as "all spaces are already
assigned at that time and any projects need
ing structural modification often involve
design, county permitting and resource allo
cation challenges."
Teri Adams, associate director of the
Office of Accessible Education, also
believed that her office did everything in its
power to accommodate disabled students.
"While I sympathize with the frustration
of students who find that their housing
doesn't perfectly meet their needs, the com
bination of Housing Assignments and
Housing Operations have made extraordi
nary efforts to meet the needs of students
with all types of disabilities," Adams, who is
also wheelchair-bound, said.
However, Corona insists that he did
apply for special accommodations. He
described how he was then told by Housing

A Nov. 6 story by The Daily highlighted several students' complaints regarding disabled accessibility in undergraduate and graduate housing. In response,
Executive Director of Housing Rodger Whitney explained that his office had done everything in its power to make student life as comfotable as possible.
