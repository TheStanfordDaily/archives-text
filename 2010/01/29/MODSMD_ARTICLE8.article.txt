## Bus incidents highlight senior night problems 
### KATE ABBOTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Following two separate vomiting incidents on
buses after senior night festivities, the senior class
presidents have warned fellow seniors that there is
little toleration for such conduct during the
Thursday night tradition.
According to Ralph Castro, manager for Flealth
Promotion Services, at least two students became
sick on bus rides since the start of winter quarter, in
addition to two previous incidents last quarter.
Castro said the individual responsible for the most
recent incident last week has not yet come forward.
Each time a student vomits on a Marguerite, the
senior class incurs a $5OO cleaning cost charge.
This especially becomes an issue when an individ
ual does not claim responsibility, according to
Castro, as the fine must be

paid out of the class' budget.
On Wednesday, the senior class presidents sent
out an e-mail to peers detailing their concerns for
senior night.
"In light of the budgetary constraints we have
this year, it's hard to justify spending University
funds on senior nights when many departments
and communities face budget cuts," the e-mail
read. "We want our behavior to represent our class
as positively as possible, and show that we can have
a good time while still being respectful and under
standing that this is a privilege."
Castro echoed this sentiment, explaining that it
is difficult for the class to pay for other events in
addition to senior nights when there is not much
funding available to begin with. The budget cur
rently allocated for pub night covers transportation
fees as well as some security for students as they
board the buses.

Castro said that bus sickness has
happened enough to "make a dent in
the budget."
"It's a recurring problem that
we have," Castro said. "Once an e
mail goes out about what the spirit of
senior night is supposed to be, it usu
ally stops."
Shanna Cook 'lO said that by
senior year, students should be fully
aware of their limits.
"I was on a bus fall quarter
when someone vomited and it was really
nasty," Cook said. "When we got off the bus
til of my friends and I were really [upset]
because we thought that would be the last
pub night. I'm glad the senior cabinet has
n't cancelled them like they have actu
ally threatened to do."
The e-mail addressed to the
senior class mentioned that while win-

ter quarter pub nights were canceled
last year because of similar incidents,
there are no plans to do so this year.
Instead, trash bags will be provided as
a "last resort" for students who feel
sick.
"There's really no change, the e
mail is just reiterating policies and
expectations for senior nights," Castro
said. "It doesn't mean its okay for
people to think, 'well having a bag
means its okay to throw up.'
"But, at least someone can have
the dignity of a bag instead of getting
sick all over the floor," he added.
Seniors are required to sign con
tracts at the beginning of the year
prior to attending to pub nights and
part of the security's job is to insure
that students that appear overly
intoxicated do not board the bus.
Castro said part of the problem is
when non-seniors attend these events
without signing waivers.
"One of the other issues is the
problems that arise when people that
aren't seniors come as well; now that
a lot of juniors are coming of age they
will go to venue and then they're
wanting rides back on the bus,"
Castro explained. "They haven't
signed [a] contract for collective
responsibility.
"We will not deny rides, but peo
ple need to understand that you need

to abide by all the terms and condi
tions, even if you're junior, he added.
"If you get sick on the bus you still
need to pay the fine."
Cook mentioned that students
"pre-gaming" pub night have been a
potential cause for this quarter's bus
incidents.
"I'm pretty sure that people are
drinking more and going all out for
pub night this year because there
really is nothing to do on campus any
more," she said. "The weekend party
scene has gotten really bad and there
is nothing to do on the weekends, so
seniors are now making Thursday the
new Friday and Saturday night."
Both Castro and the class presi
dents encouraged moderation. Castro
said friends should also help each
other out by watching the pace of
alcohol intake or calling cabs for rides
home.
