## Bus incidents highlight senior night problems 
### KATE ABBOTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Following two separate vomiting incidents on
buses after senior night festivities, the senior class
presidents have warned fellow seniors that there is
little toleration for such conduct during the
Thursday night tradition.
According to Ralph Castro, manager for Flealth
Promotion Services, at least two students became
sick on bus rides since the start of winter quarter, in
addition to two previous incidents last quarter.
Castro said the individual responsible for the most
recent incident last week has not yet come forward.
Each time a student vomits on a Marguerite, the
senior class incurs a $5OO cleaning cost charge.
This especially becomes an issue when an individ
ual does not claim responsibility, according to
Castro, as the fine must be

paid out of the class' budget.
On Wednesday, the senior class presidents sent
out an e-mail to peers detailing their concerns for
senior night.
"In light of the budgetary constraints we have
this year, it's hard to justify spending University
funds on senior nights when many departments
and communities face budget cuts," the e-mail
read. "We want our behavior to represent our class
as positively as possible, and show that we can have
a good time while still being respectful and under
standing that this is a privilege."
Castro echoed this sentiment, explaining that it
is difficult for the class to pay for other events in
addition to senior nights when there is not much
funding available to begin with. The budget cur
rently allocated for pub night covers transportation
fees as well as some security for students as they
board the buses.

Castro said that bus sickness has
happened enough to "make a dent in
the budget."
"It's a recurring problem that
we have," Castro said. "Once an e
mail goes out about what the spirit of
senior night is supposed to be, it usu
ally stops."
Shanna Cook 'lO said that by
senior year, students should be fully
aware of their limits.
"I was on a bus fall quarter
when someone vomited and it was really
nasty," Cook said. "When we got off the bus
til of my friends and I were really [upset]
because we thought that would be the last
pub night. I'm glad the senior cabinet has
n't cancelled them like they have actu
ally threatened to do."
The e-mail addressed to the
senior class mentioned that while win-
