IRANIAN STUDIES
"CLASSICAL
PERSIAN
MUSIC AND
DESPOTISM"
Mohsen Namjoo. an Iranian artist, songwriter, singer, music scholar and setar
(traditional Persian lute) player is one of the most groundbreaking artists in Persian
music today, often called "the Bob Dylan of Iran."
Born in 1976 in Torbat-e Jam, Iran, Namjoo began his musical training at the age
of twelve, studying under Nasrollah Nasehpoor until the age of eighteen. In 1994
Namjoo was offered admission to study Theater and Music at the University of
Tehran. Since the music program there would not start for another year, he first
joined the theater course, where he learned how to connect with an audience. At
Tehran University he trained under Alireza Mashayekhi, Azin Movahed and other
masters. Namjoo also studied Iranian folk music under Haj Ghorbane Soleimani.
His music's unique style resembles a patchwork of Persian classical poetry of
Hafez, Rumi or Saadi with western music, namely rock, blues, and jazz.
Since 2003, Namjoo has recorded parts of his works in Tehran. His debut
album, titled Toranj was officially released in Iran in September 2007 with his
own voice featured in most of his creations. He has also composed soundtracks
for movies and plays, and was featured in the documentary Sounds of Silence
(directed by Amir Hamz and Mark Lazarz) which has been screened at international
film festivals. He also appeared in a feature narrative film called Few Kilograms of
Dates for the Funeral (Director Saman Salur). Namjoo's first performance outside
Iran was in January 2006 at the Tehran Hotspot of the International Rotterdam
Film Festival where he played solo.
Namjoo's visit to Stanford University is co-sponsored by the Hamid & Christina
Moghadam Program in Iranian Studies and the Stanford Humanities Center. His
residency at the Humanities Center is made possible through the generous support
of the Hariri Family and the Flora Family Foundation.
