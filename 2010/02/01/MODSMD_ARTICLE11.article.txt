### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Eric Messinger 
Jeffrey Owen Smith, a 39-year-old Palo
Alto resident, has entered a plea of no
contest to a series of robberies that took
place in 2008, the San Jose Mercury News
reported last week.
The crimes were at the center of a racial
profiling controversy involving former
Palo Alto Police Chief Lynne Johnson,
who eventually resigned under mounting
pressure from the community.
The robberies occurred in a variety of
locations in Palo Alto, including two near the
California Avenue Caltrain station. Smith
attacked women who were walking alone.
Smith pleaded no contest last Monday
to four counts of second-degree robbery,
one count of attempted robbery and one
count of receiving stolen property, accord
ing to the Mercury News. Smith is set to
receive his sentence, which could be up to
28 years in prison, on March 11.
As police worked to investigate and
stop the muggings, which took place pri
marily at night, Johnson made a number of
comments at a city council meeting that
appeared to condone racial profiling.
Specifically, she said, "If my officers see an
African American who has a do-rag on his
head, absolutely the officers will be stop
ping and trying to find out who that person
is." Johnson later apologized for her com
ments, then resigned in December 2008.
