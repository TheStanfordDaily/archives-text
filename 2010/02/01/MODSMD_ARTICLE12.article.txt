# OPINIONS
## EDITOR'S WELCOME The
						Daily is in your hands: citizen journalism, online media and democracy 
### Kamil Dada 
We in the newspaper industry are not
immune to an economic downturn.
Needless to say, this will not come as
"news" to anyone involved in media. Indeed,
the newspaper industry is under attack on all
fronts: advertising is down, revenues are
down and readership is in decline. The indus
try is under siege as readers are moving to the
Internet as their sole source of news. Of
course, we have a Web site, but the print ver
sion we distribute across campus each day re
mains at the core of our financial model,
leading some to question whether printed
newspapers are an anachronism that will dis
appear in the near future.
In order to combat the changing role of
the industry, I launched a new version of our
Web site late Sunday night. It still has all the
usual features that you have come to know
and love, but comes packaged with a whole
new look and feel and many additional fea
tures. In particular, we have launched online
blogs with regular and updated online-exclu
sive content. We are also multimedia heavy,
and are posting videos and photos from
around campus on a daily basis.
Our generation demands and is depend
ent upon the speed of instant information.
The Internet has allowed us to gain access to
information at a rate that was unimaginable
only a few decades ago. Even though at The
Daily we provide you with news through our
Web site, Twitter, Facebook and our iPhone
application, there is still room for improve
ment. As part of a continuous improvement
process at all levels, one of my principal con
cerns will be to significantly improve our
Web site on an ongoing basis. So, in addition
to being editor in chief, I am playing the role
of Web master.

The core mission of the Web site is to pro
vide information in an easily accessible man
ner. Access to information is critical to a
functioning community. It allows citizens to
make responsible, educated choices and pre
vents them from acting out of ignorance. It
checks that elected representatives stay true
to their commitments and uphold their oaths.
The Daily then, is Stanford's newspaper of
record. It is more than a topic of conversation
over lunch; it is a watchdog, a fact-checker
and a time capsule of campus life for years to
come. The new Web site will allow more read
ers to access this information in real-time,
monitoring developing stories and breaking
news, well before they make it into the print
edition.

Yet, technology can only take us so far.
The 1948 Universal Declaration of Fluman
Rights states that, "Everyone has the right to
freedom of opinion and expression; this right
includes freedom to hold opinions without
interference and to seek, receive, and impart
information and ideas through any media
and regardless of frontiers."
We have already fulfilled the issue of free
dom: since 1973, we have been a fully inde
pendent news source. The University agrees
to honor the autonomy of the Stanford Daily
Publishing Corporation in its governance
and to respect the independence of the Com
pany's newsgathering, news dissemination
and educational mission.

However, perhaps more can be done in
the realm of serving the public interest and,
as per the Universal Declaration of Human

Rights, allowing the community to "impart
information." If the media is to have any
meaningful role in a democratic community
at Stanford, then the ultimate goal should be
to allow credible voices to participate in a
range of mediums.
So, I am opening up The Daily to you: the
reader, the audience. Students, faculty, staff
and community members are all invited to
participate in the content of our University's
newspaper. Any participatory democratic
community benefits if its citizens are en
gaged in an interactive conversation about
how the media carries out its role in society.
A large aspect of this is freedom and diversi
ty of expression. As hard as our fantastic
team of editors and writers are, we simply
cannot report on everything that happens in
our community. This is where you come in
the diversity of expression.
The new Web site allows us as a newspa
per, and as a University community, to exper
iment with this new frontier of media and cit
izen-centric journalism. I invite you to share
your ideas and passion to help us develop a
new and interactive media environment at
Stanford, in which The Daily fulfills its re
sponsibility and the citizen journalist is seen
as a valuable resource and noteworthy con
tributor to the overall process of mass com
munication.
To that end, if you see something out of
the ordinary on campus, take a photo of it.
The next time you rush the field at a sporting
event, take a video of it. If you hear a rumor
about something newsworthy, let us know.
Do you have an opinion about something we
published? Write a letter to the editor or an
op-ed. Have you had a unique experience on
campus? Write a guest column. I can't prom
ise that we will publish everything, but I aim
to publish a large percentage of reader sub
mitted content.

So, visit www.stanforddaily.com each day
for new, online-exclusive content, pick up a
copy of The Daily each day to tap into the
pulse of what's happening on campus, learn
about people's stories and find out what hap
pened in the latest sporting event.
Let me know what you think of the new
Web site and the role of The Daily. Feel free
to e-mail me at eic@stanforddaily.com, call
(650) 725-2100, ext. 501 or stop by our office
at the Lorry I. Lokey building. But, most
importantly, get involved! This is your
newspaper. Welcome to The Stanford Daily,
Volume 237.

Sincerely,
KAMIL DADA
President and Editor in Chief, Vol. 237
