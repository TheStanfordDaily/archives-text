# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Truth and Consequences 
### Emily Hulme 
£ £ ■ liddler on the Roof," a somewhat
|H depressing musical set in Tsarist
-1- Russia, centers on the tribulations
of a small Jewish town persecuted by many
and seemingly encouraged by nothing more
than absolute faith. No one dies in the plot,
so given the circumstances, it might even
qualify as uplifting. In my third favorite film
plot turn of all time,Tevye, the main charac
ter and father of five daughters, decides
whether he will allow his third daughter to
marry a Russian man. In their community,
marriages are normally arranged, but his
eldest daughter convinces him to permit her
to marry the poor tailor she loves rather than
a wealthy old butcher. The next daughter
further flaunts social norms by asking, with
her husband, merely for Tevye's blessing
rather than his permission. Each time, Tevye
weighs his love for his daughters against
"Tradition," with a capital T. Walking
through arguments for the former "on one
hand," and the latter "on the other hand," he
comes to realize away to bring together his
love for his family with his loyalty to his com
munity. When this third daughter presents
her betrothed, he stops and performs the
same analysis. He finally comes to his deci
sion: "there is no other hand."
We could reformulate this in terms of di
alectic. Tevye moves from a thesis ("My
daughter must marry the man I choose be
cause that's how the world works") to an
tithesis ("My daughter must marry this man
I didn't choose because she loves him") to
synthesis ("I choose to allow this man to
marry my daughter because it's the best op
tion"). With this last daughter, the dialectic
crashes, if you can even say that for such a
non-starter. The decisions were already
within Tevye. Tevye has finally hit the pro
found point in his beliefs and can go no fur
ther. She cannot pass go and collect $2OO.
The contradiction must stand. No synthesis
is possible.
I hate making choices as much as the next
person. Specifically, I hate making choices
with consequences. I can pick what color
shirt I want to wear, or which route to take
going to the store, or whether to listen to
Taylor or Miley first. At the end of the day, it

just doesn't matter. It's the choices that hurt
that matter. That's the choice Tevye finally
has to make. He cannot accommodate his
daughter and stay true to himself. Every
thing has its price.
One of the most curious phrases our
President uses tries to deny this, at least in
my reading. In the State of the Union last
week, he dragged it out, infinitely quotable:
"We reject as false the choice between our
safety and our ideals." In more literal terms,
I take this to mean something along the
lines of "we can both not racially profile and
not be opening ourselves up for a terrorist
attack."
The problem is that compromising our
ideals might increase our safety by one per
cent.That's a meager benefit for compromis
ing our ideals, and that's exactly the true
choice that you make: you (or we) determine
it's not worth it. The choice is still made. This
isn't news for the White House. The health
care bill, if nothing else, is a giant rat's nest of
these choices. I doubt any Democrat thought
striking a backroom deal with pharmaceuti
cal companies was the most honorable
route. I'm sure Obama ideally did want to
allow C-SPAN to cover negotiations. It just
so happens he chose the safety of the bill
over the ideal transparency of the dealings.
This is the difficult math of politics. No
one ever said making important decisions
was easy. But saying it's not even a decision
at all is perhaps the most ludicrous way to
address a problem. I assert as true the diffi
cult choices we have to make, from the
everyday to the once-in-a-lifetime, and sug
gest trivializing them as "non-decisions" in
rhetoric does nothing to alter this reality.
