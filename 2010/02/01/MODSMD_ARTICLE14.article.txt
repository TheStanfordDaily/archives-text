# THE 						GAO REPORT
## The 						Nonsense of Freshman Expansion 
### Shelley Gao 
The Office of Undergraduate Admission
announced last Wednesday that a Uni
versity-record 32,000 high school stu
dents applied for admission to Stanford, an
increase of 5.6 percent over last year's similar
ly high level. As the admissions rate continues
to decrease, let's hope that this surge will not
trigger another "well-intentioned," yet mis
guided effort, to expand the freshman class.
Along with streamlining operations, cut
ting bureaucracy and eliminating waste (de
spite shrill protests by vocal interest groups),
a positive outcome of the University budget
crisis has been a halt to the undergraduate ex
pansion plans. Since the economy seems to be
slowly recovering, it is important to once
again establish that increasing the size of the
freshman class is a risky and even detrimental
proposition.
This expansion debate was originally trig
gered by President Hennessy's column in the
September/October 2007 issue of the Stan
ford Alumni Magazine, A Task Force on Un
dergraduate Expansion was established in
January 2008 to conduct outreach and solicit
opinions from various stakeholders including
current students.
Unfortunately, the level of engagement
from students was disappointing, judging
from the minimal attendance at town halls
and focus groups. There is a disturbing level of
apathy toward a proposal that will, if imple
mented, fundamentally alter the Stanford ex
perience.

Let me systematically evaluate the sup
posed "benefits" of increasing the freshman
class. An argument originally put forth in
support of expansion notes that increasing
the number of admitted students allows for
more opportunity to "broaden the perspec
tives and experiences of the student body as
a whole."
Flaving more people, however, does not
mean that the student body will engage with
each other more than before. There seems to
be a missing causal link. If fostering exchange
is really the goal, there are plenty of less dras
tic approaches. For example, greater funding
for student groups or investing in other "per
spective-broadening" programs like studying
abroad and public service in Washington
D.C.
The notion that Stanford needs to com
pete for market share after the recent expan
sion of our peer institutions is also problem
atic upon examination. Currently, Princeton,
Yale and Harvard have 5,047,5,316 and 6,715

undergraduates, respectively. Stanford al
ready has the largest undergraduate popula
tion at 6,812.
Improving diversity is another argument
articulated by pro-expansion forces. With the
exception of historically black colleges, Stan
ford already has one of the most diverse stu
dent bodies in the United States. More than
half of undergraduates are students of color
and approximately 17 percent are among the
first in their families to attend college. What
exactly are we diversifying? Socio-economic
backgrounds? First generations? Geograph
ic locations? International students? Perhaps
a more effective way to promote diversity
would be providing more support for minor
ity and first-generation students already at
tending Stanford to ensure there is no
achievement gap.
Believing that Stanford has a moral and
social responsibility to allow more talented
students to access a world-class education is
admirable but flawed. First, quality is not de
fined by numerical standards here. The beau
ty of admissions at Stanford is that it is holis
tic, and that quality means being the best
compared to other applicants in a given year.
One cannot make a comparison of quality
between students from different class years.
Second, the baby boom echoes the demo
graphic trend causing a peak in the number
of graduating high school seniors. A decline
in applicants is inevitable.
Third, it is arrogant to assume that Stan

ford is the only place that offers an excellent
college education. Talented applicants will
most likely be offered admission by many
other fine institutions.
Finally and most importantly, what about
the University's duty to its current students?
Year after year, there have been complaints
about inadequate underclassmen advising,
overstuffed housing, oversubscription of
Sophomore College and overseas studies,
and overflowing seminar classes. An action
plan for reform must be implemented before
additional strains can be placed on Stan
ford's resources. Expansion is simply not a vi
able option without fixing the current prob
lems. Oh yes, add the issue of increased finan
cial aid to the equation.
Alumni visiting the Farm remark on how
fortunate they are to have been accepted be
fore this era of insane admission rates. It is
difficult not to sympathize with the goal of al
lowing more talented students access to the
Farm. However, Stanford's first responsibili
ty is to its current students and maintaining
the high-class education it currently offers.
Without addressing these challenges, expan
sion will detrimentally impact the Stanford
experience.

ford small" movement if expansion is reconsid
