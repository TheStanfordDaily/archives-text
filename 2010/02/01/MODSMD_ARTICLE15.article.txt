# Westboro Baptist Church: thank you
## 
### OP-ED 
Dear Mr. Phelps and Members of Westboro
Baptist Church,

I want to thank for taking the time to
stop by Stanford University last Friday. I
have to admit, when I heard that you were
coming to Stanford, I was very concerned.
I've seen the media coverage of some of
your previous protests claiming that God
hates homosexuals, America, Jews, and oth
ers. I've heard about your protests at the fu
nerals of soldiers and homosexuals, most
notably Matthew Shepherd who was beaten
to death near Laramie, Wyoming. Your mes
sages have always been provocative and
negative. I know what you're against, but
what are you for?
There was considerable debate within
the Stanford community as to whether we
should simply ignore you and your hateful
message. That would have been relatively
easy to do given that you were planning to
arrive on campus at the, dare I say it, "un
godly" hour of 8:20 am on a Friday! On the
other hand, we are all students of history
and we know that as Edmund Burke once
said, "The only thing necessary for the tri
umph of evil is for good [people] to do noth
ing." You came targeting Stanford Hillel as
well as members of the LGBT community.
By targeting them you reminded us that
these are beloved members of our commu
nity, that our community would not be the
same without them. So the students of our
community turned your message of hate
and doom into a celebration of diversity.
Stanford Talisman led us in many songs
of love and solidarity including "We Shall
Overcome" and "Lift every Voice." And
then a bagpiper spontaneously appeared
and led us all in "Amazing Grace." People
held signs affirming love over hate includ
ing "God is Love" and "Love is a Light that
will Always Shine." We recited a pledge that
said in part, "We stand united, because
widespread hate begins with targeted
hate...We stand united, and we pledge:
When we are no longer at Stanford, we will
go to the home of those who are unjustly
targeted - whoever they may be. We will
speak out with them. We will act, united
with them, and together, we will create a
better world."
I'm sorry that you couldn't join in with us
to experience the power of that moment
when we were all there reveling in our
shared love and community. But I wanted to
thank you for helping to remind us of the
importance of our community and the di
versity that we cherish. Your message seems
to be that diversity is something to fear and
avoid while we experience diversity as es
sential to building the beloved community
that was the dream of Martin Luther King,
Jr. Thank you again for stopping by and
while I can't say that I look forward to see
ing you again, our community is more that
capable of turning bigotry into a stronger
community.
