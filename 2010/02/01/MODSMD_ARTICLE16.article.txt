## SWEET SECOND HALF Cardinal crushes Arizona after halftime 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
For the second time in as many games, it only
took one half of dominant play for the No. 2
Cardinal to secure a convincing win.
After a competitive opening against Ari
zona on Saturday afternoon, Stanford (19-1,9-0
Pac-10) took off in the second half en route to
an 83-62 victory over the visiting Wildcats (9-10,
3-6). Sophomore forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike and junior forward Kayla Pedersen each
put up 27 points for Stanford, while Arizona
guard Davellyn White added 24 of her own.
Stanford found itself trailing early, as it did
against Arizona State two nights earlier. White
opened the game with a three-pointer and just
a minute later, the Cardinal was down 7-3. Stan
ford would respond, though, racing to a 10-9
lead on an Ogwumike layup at 15:51 and setting
the pace for a hard-fought first half.
After any lead the Cardinal took, the Wild
cats seemed able to close the gap a moment
later, thanks in large part to 57.1-percent shoot
ing in the first half. The game was tied six sepa
rate times in the first 20 minutes and there were
six lead changes.
"Arizona has really talented players and
they came out and ran their offense really well
in the first half," said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "They shot [really well] and our
defense was not aggressive enough."
Stanford set the pace for most of the game,
but it had little to do with solid shooting. The
Cardinal posted a modest 35-percent field goal
percentage in the first half, but it outshot the
Wildcats 40 to 28 from the field in the first half
thanks to 27 rebounds, including 14 on offense
an area where the Cardinal had been strug
gling lately.
In particular, the Cardinal had trouble shoot
ing from beyond the arc. Despite a quick trio of
three-pointers from Kayla Pedersen in the first
eight minutes, Stanford was just 5-22 on threes in
the first half and 8-35 on the game as a whole.
Guards Jeanette Pohlen and Rosalyn Gold-On
wude were 1-10 and 0-7 from outside the line, re
spectively.
"Our perimeter shot wasn't there," Van-
Derveer said. "I just think for people in the long
run, we can't be going one-for-10 or one-for
four from the perimeter. We can't be doing that
and expect to win games. We need people being
more patient and going inside."
As the first half wound down, freshman for
ward Joslyn Tinkle electrified the crowd with a
game-tying layup, but White quickly responded
with an impressive jump shot to put the Wild-

cats up 42-40 at the half. For the second time in
its last two games and just the second time
this season the Cardinal women were be
hind as they headed for the locker room.
"We needed to light the fire," Ogwumike
said. "We didn't necessarily start as aggressive
ly as we needed to, or aggressively at all, and we
needed to come out [in the second half] and let
everybody know, and let ourselves know, that
no one can pound on us, we're supposed to be
pounding on other people. We just really need
ed to play Stanford ball."
If aggression was its goal for the second half,
the team succeeded from the outset. Stanford
immediately went on a 10-0 run, jumping out to
a 50-42 lead in just four and a half minutes. Og
wumike accounted for eight points during the
outburst.
Arizona, meanwhile, missed eight consecu
tive shots and struggled badly on rebounds.
They brought down only eight in the half while
allowing 25 to Stanford, who finished with 52
(26 offensive, 26 defensive) compared to Ari
zona's total of 22.
The Cardinal began to utilize its dominant
size, with power forwards Ogwumike and Ped
ersen scoring the majority of their points in the
second half. With 5:44 to go, sophomore guard
Lindy La Rocque gave the Cardinal its first lead
of over 20 points, nailing a three-pointer to
make it 71-50. The Wildcats would manage to
pull within 19 on White's three a few minutes
later before ultimately falling, 83-62.

Sophomore forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike rises for a shot. Ogwumike lead the No. 2 Cardinal
with 27 points as it won its ninth consecutive conference game, 83-62, over Arizona.

With half of the conference sea
son now behind them, the Cardinal
women find themselves with a
somewhat unusual problem in
three of their last four games,
they've only played like the No. 2
team in the country in the second
half. They led Oregon State by a slim
margin of 29-27 at halftime two
weekends ago and trailed Arizona
State last Thursday, 29-25, after 20
minutes.
"I think it just has to do with the
intensity that we come out with,"
Ogwumike said. "We're playing as
hard as we can, but there's still room
for us to play harder... I think we
can't just wait for a team that we
know has some extreme type [of
play style] and just wait to play hard
then. We need to start off every
game like it's any team, any team
that could potentially beat us. We
just need to get that into our heads
and try to get them down in the first
half."
The Cardinal will kick off the sec
ond half of its conference season this
Thursday, hitting the road to take on
UCLA at 7 p.m.

"I think it just has to do with the
intensity that we come out with,"
Ogwumike said. "We're playing as
hard as we can, but there's still room
for us to play harder... I think we
can't just wait for a team that we
know has some extreme type [of
play style] and just wait to play hard
then. We need to start off every
game like it's any team, any team
that could potentially beat us. We
just need to get that into our heads
and try to get them down in the first
half."

For the second time in as many games, it only
took one half of dominant play for the No. 2
Cardinal to secure a convincing win.
After a competitive opening against Ari
zona on Saturday afternoon, Stanford (19-1,9-0
Pac-10) took off in the second half en route to
an 83-62 victory over the visiting Wildcats (9-10,
3-6). Sophomore forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike and junior forward Kayla Pedersen each
put up 27 points for Stanford, while Arizona
guard Davellyn White added 24 of her own.
Stanford found itself trailing early, as it did
against Arizona State two nights earlier. White
opened the game with a three-pointer and just
a minute later, the Cardinal was down 7-3. Stan
ford would respond, though, racing to a 10-9
lead on an Ogwumike layup at 15:51 and setting
the pace for a hard-fought first half.
After any lead the Cardinal took, the Wild
cats seemed able to close the gap a moment
later, thanks in large part to 57.1-percent shoot
ing in the first half. The game was tied six sepa
rate times in the first 20 minutes and there were
six lead changes.
"Arizona has really talented players and
they came out and ran their offense really well
in the first half," said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "They shot [really well] and our
defense was not aggressive enough."
Stanford set the pace for most of the game,
but it had little to do with solid shooting. The
Cardinal posted a modest 35-percent field goal
percentage in the first half, but it outshot the
Wildcats 40 to 28 from the field in the first half
thanks to 27 rebounds, including 14 on offense
an area where the Cardinal had been strug
gling lately.
In particular, the Cardinal had trouble shoot
ing from beyond the arc. Despite a quick trio of
three-pointers from Kayla Pedersen in the first
eight minutes, Stanford was just 5-22 on threes in
the first half and 8-35 on the game as a whole.
Guards Jeanette Pohlen and Rosalyn Gold-On
wude were 1-10 and 0-7 from outside the line, re
spectively.
"Our perimeter shot wasn't there," Van-
Derveer said. "I just think for people in the long
run, we can't be going one-for-10 or one-for
four from the perimeter. We can't be doing that
and expect to win games. We need people being
more patient and going inside."
As the first half wound down, freshman for
ward Joslyn Tinkle electrified the crowd with a
game-tying layup, but White quickly responded
with an impressive jump shot to put the Wild-

cats up 42-40 at the half. For the second time in
its last two games and just the second time
this season the Cardinal women were be
hind as they headed for the locker room.
"We needed to light the fire," Ogwumike
said. "We didn't necessarily start as aggressive
ly as we needed to, or aggressively at all, and we
needed to come out [in the second half] and let
everybody know, and let ourselves know, that
no one can pound on us, we're supposed to be
pounding on other people. We just really need
ed to play Stanford ball."
If aggression was its goal for the second half,
the team succeeded from the outset. Stanford
immediately went on a 10-0 run, jumping out to
a 50-42 lead in just four and a half minutes. Og
wumike accounted for eight points during the
outburst.
Arizona, meanwhile, missed eight consecu
tive shots and struggled badly on rebounds.
They brought down only eight in the half while
allowing 25 to Stanford, who finished with 52
(26 offensive, 26 defensive) compared to Ari
zona's total of 22.
The Cardinal began to utilize its dominant
size, with power forwards Ogwumike and Ped
ersen scoring the majority of their points in the
second half. With 5:44 to go, sophomore guard
Lindy La Rocque gave the Cardinal its first lead
of over 20 points, nailing a three-pointer to
make it 71-50. The Wildcats would manage to
pull within 19 on White's three a few minutes
later before ultimately falling, 83-62.

Sophomore forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike rises for a shot. Ogwumike lead the No. 2 Cardinal
with 27 points as it won its ninth consecutive conference game, 83-62, over Arizona.

With half of the conference sea
son now behind them, the Cardinal
women find themselves with a
somewhat unusual problem in
three of their last four games,
they've only played like the No. 2
team in the country in the second
half. They led Oregon State by a slim
margin of 29-27 at halftime two
weekends ago and trailed Arizona
State last Thursday, 29-25, after 20
minutes.
"I think it just has to do with the
intensity that we come out with,"
Ogwumike said. "We're playing as
hard as we can, but there's still room
for us to play harder... I think we
can't just wait for a team that we
know has some extreme type [of
play style] and just wait to play hard
then. We need to start off every
game like it's any team, any team
that could potentially beat us. We
just need to get that into our heads
and try to get them down in the first

ond half of its conference season this
