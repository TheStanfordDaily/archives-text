# ROAD WOES HAUNT CARD IN ARIZONA
## 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Saturday's 88-70 loss to Arizona State left Stanford feeling like
it just wanted to go home, but the Cardinal will not even have that
luxury in its next two games.
The Sun Devils (15-7,5-4 Pac-10) jumped out to a shell-shock
ing 54-22 lead at halftime, which put them well on their way to
handing Stanford (10-11,4-5) its eighth road loss this season. That
number only reveals its true meaning when compared to the num
ber of games the Cardinal has won on the road this season: zero.
This game was already over after the first 10 minutes.The offen
sive execution on each side of the ball could not have been more

disparate, as the Sun
Devils jumped out to
a 54-17 lead, led by the
hot hand of Ty Ab
bott. Abbott hit six
straight three-point
ers in the first 10 min
utes and finished the
night with 29 points
and 12 rebounds. The
most telling statistic,
though, may have
been that the Sun
Devils recorded as
sists on their first 18
baskets.

"They were ready
to compete and they
played very well,"
head coach Johnny
Dawkins told the San
Francisco Chronicle.
"You can tell by how
many connecting
plays they made. They
had a lot of baskets assisted on, with 19 assists in the first half I
haven't seen anything like that in the college game."
Another development for Stanford has been its dependence on
senior forward Landry Fields and sophomore guard Jeremy
Green, a trend that showed no sign of stopping on Saturday. Fields
went for 22 points and five rebounds on seven-of-18 shooting,
while Green had 20 points to show for on seven-of-21 from the
field. Senior point guard Drew Shiller did not start, but got most of
the minutes at the position over sophomore Jarrett Mann. Shiller
