# ROAD WOES HAUNT CARD IN ARIZONA
## 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Saturday's 88-70 loss to Arizona State left Stanford feeling like
it just wanted to go home, but the Cardinal will not even have that
luxury in its next two games.
The Sun Devils (15-7,5-4 Pac-10) jumped out to a shell-shock
ing 54-22 lead at halftime, which put them well on their way to
handing Stanford (10-11,4-5) its eighth road loss this season. That
number only reveals its true meaning when compared to the num
ber of games the Cardinal has won on the road this season: zero.
This game was already over after the first 10 minutes.The offen
sive execution on each side of the ball could not have been more

disparate, as the Sun
Devils jumped out to
a 54-17 lead, led by the
hot hand of Ty Ab
bott. Abbott hit six
straight three-point
ers in the first 10 min
utes and finished the
night with 29 points
and 12 rebounds. The
most telling statistic,
though, may have
been that the Sun
Devils recorded as
sists on their first 18
baskets.

"They were ready
to compete and they
played very well,"
head coach Johnny
Dawkins told the San
Francisco Chronicle.
"You can tell by how
many connecting
plays they made. They
had a lot of baskets assisted on, with 19 assists in the first half I
haven't seen anything like that in the college game."
Another development for Stanford has been its dependence on
senior forward Landry Fields and sophomore guard Jeremy
Green, a trend that showed no sign of stopping on Saturday. Fields
went for 22 points and five rebounds on seven-of-18 shooting,
while Green had 20 points to show for on seven-of-21 from the
field. Senior point guard Drew Shiller did not start, but got most of
the minutes at the position over sophomore Jarrett Mann. Shiller

GAME NOTES: Stanford looks to rebound against UCLA after
suffering two road losses last week in Arizona. The Cardinal
is led by senior forward Landry Fields, who is tied for eighth
in the nation with 22.3 points per game. Stanford is looking
for its first conference road win of the season.

Senior forward Landry Fields blocks a Trent Lockett shot as the Cardinal fell on
the road in Arizona, 88-70. Stanford will try to get back to a .500 record in the
Pac-10 this week on the road in Los Angeles where it will face UCLA and USC.
went only two-of-10 from the floor,
but finished the game with a career
high seven assists.
Despite those contributions, Stan-

ford seemed to be nothing more than
a deer in the headlights for much of
Saturday's contest. The Cardinal shot
an anemic 25 percent from the floor in
the first half, compared to 65 percent
for Arizona State.

"We got a little overwhelmed,"
Dawkins said. "We showed our
youth."

The Cardinal did end up clawing its

way back into the game, cutting the
Sun Devils' lead to just 12 points with
four minutes remaining. Dawkins'
team did outscore the Sun Devils 48-
34 in the game's final 30 minutes, but
that was not nearly enough to over
come the staggering first-half deficit.
Former Cardinal quarterback
Tavita Pritchard, a swingman back in
his high school days in Tacoma, Wash.,
made his first collegiate basketball ap
pearance Saturday. However, he did
not record a single statistic in his two
minutes of play.
Stanford will now try to pick up the
pieces from a lost weekend in the
desert, which pushed the team toward
the back of the conference race. At a
record of 4-5, Stanford is in a five-way
tie for fifth place two games behind
first-place Cal and Arizona, but only
one game ahead of last-place Oregon
State.

Things will not get any easier for
the Cardinal either, as it will take to
the road again this coming week to
face UCLA and USC in Los Angeles.
Stanford swept those very same teams
just three weeks ago at Maples Pavil
ion, but home-court advantage seems
to be even more important this year in
a conference defined by parity and
mediocrity. The Cardinal will be hard
pressed to get its first road win of the
season against two teams poised to re
deem themselves.

Dawkins has remained composed
despite the many challenges he has
faced in his first two years on the
Farm. The Cardinal faithful is cau
tiously optimistic about the future
under the former Duke assistant
especially with a ranked recruiting
class coming in next season but this
weekend's games will be a pivotal mo
ment for a Cardinal team fighting to
stay afloat (and above .500) in the
Pac-10.
