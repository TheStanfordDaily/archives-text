## Stanford falls twice at home 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
After a strong 3-1 opening start in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF), the No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball
team suffered two upset losses at home this
weekend to No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara 3-1
and No. 3 Cal State Northridge 3-2.
Despite reaching its highest ranking since
2002, the Cardinal now finds itself falling in
the MPSF rankings the two losses put
Stanford tied for seventh with UCLA as
Northridge leads the league in first place.
Santa Barbara sits comfortably in a three
way tie for third.

"I think it changes our attitude and focus
for the next two matches," said sophomore
outside hitter Brad Lawson. "After getting
upset by UCSB and Cal State Northridge at
home and coming out of the weekend with a
3-3 record, we are very hungry for two wins
this week."

Despite hitting a high .384 on Thursday
night, the Card failed to pull through in cru
cial moments, and instead walked away with
a 28-30, 29-31, 30-28, 29-31 loss against the
Gauchos. Each set was close, although the
Gauchos managed to grind out set victories,
despite senior outside hitter Evan Romero's
match-high 26 kills. Lawson nearly matched
Romero with 22 kills of his own.

However, UCSB's Jeff Menzel powered
in 23 kills and Cullen Irons added 22 kills for
the Gauchos. Santa Barbara's ability to pull
ahead for the final points in each set ulti
mately cost Stanford the match.
During the first set, Stanford took the
early 3-0 lead. After a Stanford service error
and hitting error, combined with Gaucho
kills, Santa Barbara tied it up 5-5. From then
on, the Card trailed. The Gauchos went on a
four-point run, putting them up 17-12. Stan
ford came close at 21-20, but UCSB capital
ized on kills by Dylan Davis and Menzel to
finish 30-28.

Throughout the second set, the Gauchos
controlled the tempo of the game. It was not
until a kill by senior outside hitter Jason
Palacios that Stanford tied it up 19-19.
The teams traded points until Menzel
tied the match at 29-29, after which an
attack error and a Jake Rosener kill
locked up the set for Santa Barbara.
Stanford changed the pace during
the third set and immediately pulled
ahead. However, errors prevented both
teams from jumping out to a big lead
until Stanford went on a six-point run,
giving the Cardinal a cushion at 18-13.
Lawson wrapped it up with a kill for the
30-28 victory.
Midway through the fourth set, the
Gauchos caught Stanford making er
rors as Menzel, Davis and Irons pound
ed in the kills. Rosener ended the set
with a service ace at 31-29, winning the
set and match for UCSB.
Friday was a different story for the
Cardinal, but had the same ending.
The Card dropped a five-set thriller
to Northridge 30-25, 21-30, 25-30, 34-
32,13-15, despite a comeback in the
fourth set. Lawson hit 26 kills and sen
ior setter Kawika Shoji dominated
with 61 assists.
Confident and relaxed in the first
set, the Card's Lawson and Romero
led the offensive while holding off
Northridge's 7-foot-2 Jacek Ratajczak.
The Matadors trailed closely all set
until two kills from Lawson and one
from Garrett Dobbs gave Stanford an
edge. Romero ended it with a kill for
the 30-25 set win.
The second set was all Ratajczak as
he hammered in kills along with Mike
Gaudino and Theo Edwards to give
Northridge the set, 30-21.
In the third set, a back-and-forth
battle that provided several ties never
let Stanford see the lead. The Card
trailed the entire match and an Ed
wards kill finished it at 30-25.
Stanford appeared to be heading

for a loss in the fourth set, but, aided by
attack errors from the Matadors, the
Card launched a thrilling comeback
from a 24-17 deficit. Romero and Law
son led the way by bombing North
ridge with kills. Ratajczak tied it up at
31-31, but freshman Myles Muagututia
set Lawson up for the set-winning kill
at 34-32.
In the fifth, attacking and service er
rors thwarted the Card. A four-point
Matador run led to a 7-5 deficit. De
spite efforts by sophomore middle
blocker Gus Ellis, Lawson and
Romero, Stanford could not pull
ahead. A Kevin McKniff kill for North
ridge ended the night for the Card at
15-13.
"Three things that stuck out this
weekend were our serving, passing and
blocking," Lawson said. "If we can con
sistently execute these skills at a high
level, our team is going to be difficult to
slow down in side out and very danger
ous on defense. I think serving is partic
ularly important considering how
many serves we missed this weekend at
crucial points in both matches."
The Cardinal comes out of this
weekend knowing it has the ability to
put up a fight against any team. Howev
er, without consistency, it might be a

long season.
Stanford looks to improve this week
against Pacific on Wednesday and on
Friday against UC-Santa Cruz. Both
games will take place in Maples Pavil
ion at 7 p.m.
