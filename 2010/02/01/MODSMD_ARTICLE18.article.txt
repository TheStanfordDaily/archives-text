### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
After a strong 3-1 opening start in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF), the No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball
team suffered two upset losses at home this
weekend to No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara 3-1
and No. 3 Cal State Northridge 3-2.
Despite reaching its highest ranking since
2002, the Cardinal now finds itself falling in

ford came close at 21-20, but UCSB capital
