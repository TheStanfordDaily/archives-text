# Problems with the Pro Bowl
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
Before I get into my disdain for
the Pro Bowl, I'd like to take
this opportunity, as I so often
do, to take advantage of the fact that
my column comes out on Mondays.
As some of you may know, this is
the first column of a new volume,
which means, among many other
things, I have brand new editors!
Since this is the only opinionated
sports article in today's paper, I
wanted to take a bit of time to recog
nize the outgoing managing editor,
Zach Zimmerman, and my own out
going desk editor, Haley Murphy.
Haley, a senior, is done desk edit
ing and has done a great job not only
making funny taglines at the end of
my columns, but also putting up with
my (and other writers') late articles,
figuring out how to make all of us
writers sound smarter and more con
cise, and generally being awesome
(despite her anger over all the foot
ball columns)!

Zach (who is a desk editor in news
this volume, and will be seen again in
sports, I am sure) essentially sacri
ficed more than a quarter's worth of
sleep in order to ensure that the most
popular section (sports) of The Daily
came out looking sharp and read
cleanly everyday.
So with a last thank you to Zach
and Haley, I will now move on to that
pathetic excuse for a football game
known as the Pro Bowl. (One last
football column in your honor,
Haley).
I will watch almost any sporting
event on TV, mostly out of interest
and sometimes as a blatant procrasti
nation technique. That said, the Pro
Bowl is being played as I write this,
and I am about as inclined to turn the
game on as I am to take a voluntary
trip to the dentist.
While I believe all All-Star games
are essentially a waste of time, the
Pro Bowl is the worst and this
year it is worse than ever.
The Pro Bowl's shortcomings
have been well documented publicly.
Players are banged up at the end of a
football season and don't want to
play an extra game, there is a high
risk of injury so the rules of the game
get altered and, this year, players
from the two best teams in the league
can't play in it because it is a week be
fore the Super Bowl.
Ideas have been tossed around
about playing the Pro Bowl in the
preseason or midseason, but those
will never happen because of the in
jury risk. Other pundits believe it
should be moved back to Hawaii
after the Super Bowl.
I have another idea instead. How
about it is moved to never?
Would anyone really miss it? Sure
it brings in some revenue, but Miami
struggled to sell the game out and,
with the Super Bowl in the same city
the following week, I'll bet that the
profits from tourism and merchan
dise are negligible.
While the MLB and NBA All-
Star games aren't much better, they
at least have some things going for
them. Baseball's midsummer classic
at least determines which league gets
home-field advantage in the World
Series while the NBA's All Star
weekend provides what Dallas Mav
ericks owner Mark Cuban has called
the greatest partying weekend ever.
(He actually said that the partying
associated with the upcoming NBA
All-Star game in Dallas will make
the Super Bowl look like a Bar Mitz
vah party though, he made no
mention of whether Pacman Jones
planned on attending this year).
The NFL has none of that.
Forty percent of players selected
to the Pro Bowl this year aren't play
ing in the game. Some have real in
juries, others have fake injuries and
some, like Vikings' offensive tackle
Bryant McKinnie, just don't show up
to practice and get kicked off the
team.
David Garrard is one of the
AFC's quarterbacks. (That fact is pa
thetic enough to make my argument
by itself).
Furthermore, Colts and Saints
players selected are being forced to
travel to the game to stand on the
sidelines, fly back to their respective
cities that night, then fly back to
Miami with their teams the next
morning.

While all of this is ridiculous, I
have yet to mention how boring the
actual game is! Football is a nuanced,
physical game and all of that is re

moved in the Pro Bowl.

Defenses must play a 4-3 base,
they cannot blitz or play press cover
age, nor can they come out in nickel
or dime packages.
Offensively, there are no motion
or trips receiver sets allowed.
Basically it's a vanilla brand of
the game that no one wants to be at
and few people watch.

I guess this all makes sense com
ing from the No Fun League, but un
less someone comes up with a drasti
cally different approach to the Pro
Bowl, I say scrap it.

Daniel Bohm had his Bar Mitzvah at
the Super Bowl, but it wasn't that great.
Ask him how it was at bohmd@stan
ford.edu.
