# STARTING OFF STRONG
## 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Taking advantage of the sun's ap
pearance, the Stanford women's
tennis team (2-0) hosted the Uni
versity of San Francisco this past
Friday, sweeping singles and dou
bles play 7-0 in the team's home
opener.

Practicing indoors because of the
rain all week, the women's team was
not even sure they would be able to
play on Friday. Luckily, the sun
came out long enough for the team
to finish most of its matches.

"It was just a very crazy morn
ing," said senior captain Lindsay
Burdette. "The men's matches were
going on and the courts were a little
wet across the street, so we decided
to play on the back courts where we
usually practice.Then we just ended
up waiting until the men finished in
the stadium. It was a hurry-up-and
wait kind of morning. For me, that
made it even more positive that the
girls went out there and took care of
business."

And take care of business they
did. Highlighted by a 6-0,6-0 thrash

ing by freshman Stacey Tan at the
No. 3 spot, the Cardinal went on to
win almost every one of its matches
convincingly.
"I was really proud [of] the way
the freshmen handled their first
dual match," Burdette said. "It's
pretty scary and really easy to suc
cumb to nerves, but everybody was
super positive and really supportive
of each other. Everyone played real
ly well, especially at the end of their
matches."

One match that provided a show
happened at the No. 1 spot, between
Stanford junior Hilary Barte and
USF junior Jennifer-Lee Heinser.
The match was a fight for both girls
before eventually being rained out
when Barte was two points away
from serving it out.
"Jenny is a former top junior
player," said Stanford head coach
Lele Forood. "She's a really quality
opponent. It's unfortunate not
being able to finish the match."

San Francisco fit into Forood's
plan for a slow progression through
the season. Each match will have a
slightly higher level of competition
in order to get a little better with

each match. With UC-Davis coming
up on Tuesday, the women should
have enough experience to continue
building momentum in the begin
ning portion of the season.
"Right now, we're just getting
used to dual match play," Forood
said. "That's the biggest thing, espe
cially with freshmen in the starting
lineup. They're just getting adjusted
to what the matches are like, since
they're obviously very different
from a tournament. That's what

Barte and Lindsay Burdette, looks to continue its strong start to the season agains t the UC-Davis Aggies on Tuesday.

these early season matches are
about, getting everyone's games in
order."

The Davis Aggies are coming off
a two-loss weekend against the Ari
zona schools. With a 0-2 record com
ing into their match against Stan
ford, they could use a win to get
their season back on the right track.
As a team, the Aggies play tough. In
their 7-0 loss to Arizona, three
matches went the full length, includ
ing a fight at the No. 1 spot, as Davis'
Desiree Stone won the first set in a
tiebreak before succumbing 6-7, 6-
3, 6-1. Barte will need to be on her
game in her matchup against Stone.
"Hilary handles pretty much
everybody," Forood said. "Right
now, she wants to get good compe
tition for every match. She knows
that the number one position is the
only position you can play on the
team where you know you're going
to get a quality opponent every
time out. She's used to it. She just
looks forward to going out and
playing her game."
Where Stanford really stands a
chance of dominating will come in
doubles. With the No. 4 team in the
nation in Barte and Burdette, Stan
ford has done a fantastic job of win
ning the doubles point so far. In
contrast, Davis has struggled in
their recent doubles matches.
Against Arizona State, the Aggies
were only able to win three games
total in three different doubles
matches. A day later, they managed
to win only eight doubles games in
their match against Arizona, so
they will need to focus on singles if
they want to challenge Stanford.
"UC-Davis overall is definitely a
better team [than USF,]" Burdette
said. "Monday, we're going over our
doubles warm-up routine. We're all
eating together at Jimmy V's be
forehand. It's going to be much
more similar to our actual dual
matches throughout the rest of the
season."

The women will be playing
Davis Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. before
leaving for a weekend in Texas.
