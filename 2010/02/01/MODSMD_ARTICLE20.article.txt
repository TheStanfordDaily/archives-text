# STARTING OFF STRONG

### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Taking advantage of the sun's ap
pearance, the Stanford women's
tennis team (2-0) hosted the Uni
versity of San Francisco this past
Friday, sweeping singles and dou
bles play 7-0 in the team's home
opener.

Practicing indoors because of the
rain all week, the women's team was
not even sure they would be able to
play on Friday. Luckily, the sun
came out long enough for the team
to finish most of its matches.

"It was just a very crazy morn
ing," said senior captain Lindsay
Burdette. "The men's matches were
going on and the courts were a little
wet across the street, so we decided
to play on the back courts where we
usually practice.Then we just ended
up waiting until the men finished in
the stadium. It was a hurry-up-and
wait kind of morning. For me, that
made it even more positive that the
girls went out there and took care of
business."

And take care of business they
did. Highlighted by a 6-0,6-0 thrash

ing by freshman Stacey Tan at the
No. 3 spot, the Cardinal went on to
win almost every one of its matches
convincingly.
"I was really proud [of] the way
the freshmen handled their first
dual match," Burdette said. "It's
pretty scary and really easy to suc
cumb to nerves, but everybody was
super positive and really supportive
of each other. Everyone played real
ly well, especially at the end of their
matches."

One match that provided a show
happened at the No. 1 spot, between
Stanford junior Hilary Barte and
USF junior Jennifer-Lee Heinser.
The match was a fight for both girls
before eventually being rained out
when Barte was two points away
from serving it out.
"Jenny is a former top junior
player," said Stanford head coach
Lele Forood. "She's a really quality
opponent. It's unfortunate not
being able to finish the match."

San Francisco fit into Forood's
plan for a slow progression through
the season. Each match will have a
slightly higher level of competition
in order to get a little better with

each match. With UC-Davis coming
up on Tuesday, the women should
have enough experience to continue
building momentum in the begin
ning portion of the season.
"Right now, we're just getting
used to dual match play," Forood
said. "That's the biggest thing, espe
cially with freshmen in the starting
lineup. They're just getting adjusted
to what the matches are like, since
they're obviously very different
from a tournament. That's what
