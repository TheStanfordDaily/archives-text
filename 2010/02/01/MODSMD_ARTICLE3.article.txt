## Appropriations quietly tightens rules 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Appropriations Committee of the
Undergraduate Senate continued, yesterday,
its effort to curb spending by Stanford's spe
cial fees groups but unless groups' finan
cial officers are subscribed to the Senate e
mail list, they probably did not receive word
of the Sunday afternoon meeting where spe
cial fees funding policies were revised.
Now, said committee chair Anton
Zietsman 'l2, groups have until 5 p.m. today
to voice opposition to the changes before
they are recommended as final to the Senate,
which he said will vote on accepting the
revised policies Tuesday. The policies would

then apply to special fees groups until the
2011 review.
Zietsman said Sunday's meeting was offi
cial, despite dubbing it a "review session"
and scheduling it at a special time not during
the committee's usual Friday evening slot.
He announced the meeting on the Senate e
mail list twice since Jan. 26.
He said he did not categorically notify
financial officers of special fees groups, who
would each be affected by yesterday's revi
sions, because "the policy review process as
been sort-of very internal to the Senate, It's
not customary to invite or notify all the
financial officers when reviewing policies
year to year."
He defended his committee's quick

action, pointing to a section of the student
body constitution that gives ASSU legislative
groups such as the Senate, of which the
Appropriations Committee is a part "ulti
mate authority" in distributing special fees.
In an e-mail to attendees after the meeting,
he wrote that "the reason we are moving
swiftly is because we want groups to start
planning their budgets early so that no one
misses that deadline, as has happened in the
past."
One group representative, from the Black
Student Union (BSU), attended the meeting.
Stephanie Epps 'lO, who now also works for
the BSU, attended as a former Appropriations
Committee member to lend advice
to the current committee. A third stu
dent group representative. Tommy
Tobin 'lO from the Stanford Project
on Hunger, was also invited,
Zietsman said, but did not attend.
The remaining handful of atten
dees were all ASSU-affiliated: mem
bers of the Senate, Elections
Commission or Graduate Student
Council.
Among them, the two-plus hour
meeting raised what is emerging as
the fundamental question in this
year's special fees discussion:
whether student groups' budgetary
wishes or the special fees charge to
individual students some $ll9
per quarter this year deserve
overarching consideration by ASSU
funding committees.
The discussion comes in the con
text of record-high rates of special
fees refunds by individual students
and warnings by leaders, including
Zietsman and Matt McLaughlin 'OB,
the ASSU financial manager, that
budget deficits may be imminent
unless groups' spending is reduced.
Senator Michael Cruz 'l2, a com
mittee member, cited the example
of student groups who use special
fees to fly members to out-of-state
events.
"They can spend their money
however they want," Cruz said. "If
they want to fly themselves around
the country they can."
Senator and committee member
Alex Katz 'l2 objected. "But can
they use others' money?" he asked.
"They have to prove they're provid
ing a benefit to the student body."
Epps said this was the question
that the committee faces this year.
"The point of you guys is to make
the hard decision and draw the line
of what's abuse," Epps said.
For now, the committee has
opted to make funding policies
more strict. Among revisions they
made yesterday, travel and lodging
fares for guest speakers would now
be considered as part of the hono
raria line item, limited in total to a
"soft cap" of $lO per student expect
ed to attend the speaker's event.
Event food would be funded, in
limited cases, at $7 per student per

meal, rather than the current $8 per
dinner or $5 per lunch. The snack
rate would remain at $2.
The cost of costumes for
example, for performing arts groups
would be funded for up to 75 per
cent of a group's request or $75,
whichever is lower, "if vital and nec
essary to the purpose of the group."

Travel fares would be funded for
up to $2OO or 50 percent, whichever
is lower, per student per trip; the
current policy is $4OO or 75 percent.

Gas would be reimbursed at
$0.20 rather than $0.40 per mile.
And registration fees would be
funded for up to $lOO or 50 percent
of a group's request, as opposed to
the current 50 percent for up to $4OO
per year.
The committee would retain
their right to fund all requests at its
discretion.
Neither current special fees fund
ing policies nor the proposed revi
sions are available on the commit

tee's Web page; their minutes are
also absent. Zietsman and Katz both
cited overall technical issues with
the ASSU Web site this year.
The Senate hired a Web master
last quarter to help resolve those
issues. As to why his committee's
documents still are not available,
Zietsman said Sunday, "That's a
great question."
