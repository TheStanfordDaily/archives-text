## Appropriations quietly tightens rules 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Appropriations Committee of the
Undergraduate Senate continued, yesterday,
its effort to curb spending by Stanford's spe
cial fees groups but unless groups' finan
cial officers are subscribed to the Senate e
mail list, they probably did not receive word
of the Sunday afternoon meeting where spe
cial fees funding policies were revised.
Now, said committee chair Anton
Zietsman 'l2, groups have until 5 p.m. today
to voice opposition to the changes before
they are recommended as final to the Senate,
which he said will vote on accepting the
revised policies Tuesday. The policies would

then apply to special fees groups until the
2011 review.
Zietsman said Sunday's meeting was offi
cial, despite dubbing it a "review session"
and scheduling it at a special time not during
the committee's usual Friday evening slot.
He announced the meeting on the Senate e
mail list twice since Jan. 26.
He said he did not categorically notify
financial officers of special fees groups, who
would each be affected by yesterday's revi
sions, because "the policy review process as
been sort-of very internal to the Senate, It's
not customary to invite or notify all the
financial officers when reviewing policies
year to year."
He defended his committee's quick

action, pointing to a section of the student
body constitution that gives ASSU legislative
groups such as the Senate, of which the
Appropriations Committee is a part "ulti
mate authority" in distributing special fees.
In an e-mail to attendees after the meeting,
he wrote that "the reason we are moving
swiftly is because we want groups to start
planning their budgets early so that no one
misses that deadline, as has happened in the
past."
One group representative, from the Black
Student Union (BSU), attended the meeting.

the BSU, attended as a former Appropriations
