# Counter-protest draws hundreds
## Students unite in response to Friday's Westboro Baptist demonstration 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
In a moment that became a rallying
point for a wide swath of the Stanford com
munity, hundreds of people gathered Friday
morning outside Hillel House and along
Mayfield Avenue to respond to five pick
eters from the Kansas-based fringe group
Westboro Baptist Church.
Police estimate that 800 to 1,000 people,
mostly Stanford-affiliated, turned out
Friday morning. The gathering, dubbed
"Stanford United" by organizers from
Hillel and the Jewish Student Association,
drowned out the Westboro demonstrators
and went largely without incident.
Students began to gather at Hillel more
than an hour ahead of the Kansas group's
8:10 a.m. arrival time in response to a week
long organizing campaign against
Westboro's visit. By the time the five
Westboro members arrived on the corner
of Campus Drive and Mayfield Avenue,
Hillel's front lawn was full and people were
standing five deep on the other side of the
road.
The church's songs targeting the
Jewish and LGBT communities and U.S.
Marines were made inaudible by a
crowd rendition of "Amazing Grace."
Westboro Baptist Church, based in
Topeka, is notorious for demonstrating with
profane anti-gay and anti-Semitic signs,
including at funerals of American soldiers.
On Friday, five adult members picketed
the Mayfield-Campus intersection for half
an hour.
The student demonstration, organized
by the Jewish Student Association and
Hillel at Stanford with 22 co-sponsor
groups from Stanford and Palo Alto, kept
true to the goal it publicized: "to affirm our
common values, regardless of WBC's pres
ence." Many people never saw the church
members, who remained at the street cor
ner with trees and shrubbery between
themselves and the front lawn of Hillel.
"Stanford really successfully came
together and created a message of our
own," said Joe Gettinger 'll, president of
the Jewish Student Association.
University spokesperson Lisa Lapin
agreed the event had turned a potentially
ugly scene into a positive moment for the
Stanford community.
"While I really abhor what the Westboro
Baptist Church stands for, it resulted in a
positive opportunity for the University, to

have so many students come together to
support each other and make a statement
for tolerance and against hate," Lapin said.
Three tires on the church's rental mini
van were slashed during their demonstra
tion. Lapin said the University offered
reserved parking and security to the group
as their vehicles have been vandalized in
the past. The group instead parked a block
from Hillel. Lapin said the police took a
report on the tire slashing and, as of press
time Sunday, had no further details.
Gettinger disavowed the vandalism.
"That should not be associated with our
event," he said.
Hillel and the Jewish Student
Association began planning their counter
event soon after learning, via Westboro's
Web site, that the group planned to picket
outside Hillel after making stops in San
Francisco and at Gunn High School in Palo
Alto.
At first, worried about attracting atten
tion for the church, Gettinger said he con
sidered whether doing nothing might be a
better idea than a massive rally. But a strong
