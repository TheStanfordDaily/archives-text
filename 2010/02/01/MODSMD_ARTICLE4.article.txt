# Counter-protest draws hundreds
## Students unite in response to Friday's Westboro Baptist demonstration 
### SCOTT BLAND STAFF WRITER 
In a moment that became a rallying
point for a wide swath of the Stanford com
munity, hundreds of people gathered Friday
morning outside Hillel House and along
Mayfield Avenue to respond to five pick
eters from the Kansas-based fringe group
Westboro Baptist Church.
Police estimate that 800 to 1,000 people,
mostly Stanford-affiliated, turned out
Friday morning. The gathering, dubbed
"Stanford United" by organizers from
Hillel and the Jewish Student Association,
drowned out the Westboro demonstrators
and went largely without incident.
Students began to gather at Hillel more
than an hour ahead of the Kansas group's
8:10 a.m. arrival time in response to a week
long organizing campaign against
Westboro's visit. By the time the five
Westboro members arrived on the corner
of Campus Drive and Mayfield Avenue,
Hillel's front lawn was full and people were
standing five deep on the other side of the
road.
The church's songs targeting the
Jewish and LGBT communities and U.S.
Marines were made inaudible by a
crowd rendition of "Amazing Grace."
Westboro Baptist Church, based in
Topeka, is notorious for demonstrating with
profane anti-gay and anti-Semitic signs,
including at funerals of American soldiers.
On Friday, five adult members picketed
the Mayfield-Campus intersection for half
an hour.
The student demonstration, organized
by the Jewish Student Association and
Hillel at Stanford with 22 co-sponsor
groups from Stanford and Palo Alto, kept
true to the goal it publicized: "to affirm our
common values, regardless of WBC's pres
ence." Many people never saw the church
members, who remained at the street cor
ner with trees and shrubbery between
themselves and the front lawn of Hillel.
"Stanford really successfully came
together and created a message of our
own," said Joe Gettinger 'll, president of
the Jewish Student Association.
University spokesperson Lisa Lapin
agreed the event had turned a potentially
ugly scene into a positive moment for the
Stanford community.
"While I really abhor what the Westboro
Baptist Church stands for, it resulted in a
positive opportunity for the University, to

have so many students come together to
support each other and make a statement
for tolerance and against hate," Lapin said.
Three tires on the church's rental mini
van were slashed during their demonstra
tion. Lapin said the University offered
reserved parking and security to the group
as their vehicles have been vandalized in
the past. The group instead parked a block
from Hillel. Lapin said the police took a
report on the tire slashing and, as of press
time Sunday, had no further details.
Gettinger disavowed the vandalism.
"That should not be associated with our
event," he said.
Hillel and the Jewish Student
Association began planning their counter
event soon after learning, via Westboro's
Web site, that the group planned to picket
outside Hillel after making stops in San
Francisco and at Gunn High School in Palo
Alto.
At first, worried about attracting atten
tion for the church, Gettinger said he con
sidered whether doing nothing might be a
better idea than a massive rally. But a strong

student reaction following independ
ent e-mails alerting student chat lists
to the WBC's plans convinced
Gettinger that a simultaneous
demonstration would only do good.
"There was so much energy on
campus around this and it seemed
better to channel it into something
rather than bottle it up," Gettinger
said.
Fittingly, students on Friday
expressed messages of tolerance
and flair.
The a cappella group Talisman
stood on Hillel's front steps and sang
songs, including "Lift Every Voice."
The crowd read aloud a declaration
titled "Stanford United." Halfway
through the event, Blake Parkinson
'lO emerged from Robert S. Moore
House playing "Amazing Grace" on
bagpipes, the crowd joining in after a
cheer.
Calling the picketers "clowns," a
juggler in a bow tie tossed beanbags in
the air on the same street corner.
Plenty of students brought signs,
too. "Gay is OK," one read. "I love
Jews," said another. One student car
ried his sign "Don't feed the
trolls" while wearing a bright pink

bunny suit.
John Machacon 'l3 and several
others carried signs reading, "Out of
many, one."
"At Mass, the priest suggested we
come out to support our fellow man,"
Machacon said. "This group is about
hating people for who they are, and
I'm not okay with that at all."
About 40 of the students in atten
dance were volunteer marshals
working with the Stanford
Department of Public Safety (DPS).
They met inside the Ziff Center
behind Hillel at 7:20 a.m. for a brief
ing from police Sgt. Hilary Karp on
how to make sure the gathering
remained calm.
Afterward, the volunteers donned
bright purple T-shirts and formed a
human barrier at the edge of the
Hillel lawn in case the Westboro
group approached the crowd.
"We were prepared for them to
come onto the sidewalk, but things
were really calm," said George
Michopoulos 'l3, one of the volun
teers.
Department police officers were
out in full force as well. About eight
uniformed officers kept watch on the
Hillel grounds while another four
monitored the event directly across
the street. Lapin confirmed that plain
clothes policemen were on duty as
well.
The DPS also barricaded the

lower block of Mayfield Avenue to
traffic at 8 a.m. as people streamed
toward Hillel from both directions.
Police lifted the barricade at 9 a.m.
Other than the tire slashing, the
gathering passed without incident.
The crowd began to disperse after the
Westboro protesters left at 8:45 a.m.,
though many stayed, as "All You
Need is Love" blared from a speaker
outside Casa Italiana and the
Stanford Band ran in to cheers.
Never ones to pass up a tongue-in
cheek joke, the set list included
Squirrel Nut Zipper's "Hell" and
Green Day's "Welcome to Paradise,"
After the Band left, the roadblocks
were gone and there was little physi
cal evidence of the gathering except
for thousands of footprints on Hillel's
front lawn. The emotional evidence
lasted longer.
"1 thought it went really well," said
Molly Bauer 'l2. "The bagpipes were
great."
"ft was incredible to come around
the corner and see all the people
already there," said Daniel Mattis 'l2,
who worried that the early time
would keep students from showing
support. "It was just amazing."
Jordan Knox 'lO may have put the
general feeling best.
"You gotta love the love," he said.

long organizing campaign against
Westboro's visit. By the time the five
Westboro members arrived on the corner
of Campus Drive and Mayfield Avenue,
Hillel's front lawn was full and people were
standing five deep on the other side of the
road.
The church's songs targeting the
Jewish and LGBT communities and U.S.
Marines were made inaudible by a
crowd rendition of "Amazing Grace."
Westboro Baptist Church, based in
Topeka, is notorious for demonstrating with
profane anti-gay and anti-Semitic signs,
including at funerals of American soldiers.
On Friday, five adult members picketed
the Mayfield-Campus intersection for half
an hour.
The student demonstration, organized
by the Jewish Student Association and
Hillel at Stanford with 22 co-sponsor
groups from Stanford and Palo Alto, kept
true to the goal it publicized: "to affirm our
common values, regardless of WBC's pres
ence." Many people never saw the church
members, who remained at the street cor
ner with trees and shrubbery between
themselves and the front lawn of Hillel.
"Stanford really successfully came
together and created a message of our
own," said Joe Gettinger 'll, president of
the Jewish Student Association.
University spokesperson Lisa Lapin
agreed the event had turned a potentially
ugly scene into a positive moment for the
Stanford community.
"While I really abhor what the Westboro
Baptist Church stands for, it resulted in a
positive opportunity for the University, to

have so many students come together to
support each other and make a statement
for tolerance and against hate," Lapin said.
Three tires on the church's rental mini
van were slashed during their demonstra
tion. Lapin said the University offered
reserved parking and security to the group
as their vehicles have been vandalized in
the past. The group instead parked a block
from Hillel. Lapin said the police took a
report on the tire slashing and, as of press
time Sunday, had no further details.
Gettinger disavowed the vandalism.
"That should not be associated with our
event," he said.
Hillel and the Jewish Student
Association began planning their counter
event soon after learning, via Westboro's
Web site, that the group planned to picket
outside Hillel after making stops in San
Francisco and at Gunn High School in Palo
Alto.
At first, worried about attracting atten
tion for the church, Gettinger said he con
sidered whether doing nothing might be a
better idea than a massive rally. But a strong

student reaction following independ
ent e-mails alerting student chat lists
to the WBC's plans convinced
Gettinger that a simultaneous
demonstration would only do good.
"There was so much energy on
campus around this and it seemed
better to channel it into something
rather than bottle it up," Gettinger
said.
Fittingly, students on Friday
expressed messages of tolerance
and flair.
The a cappella group Talisman
stood on Hillel's front steps and sang
songs, including "Lift Every Voice."
The crowd read aloud a declaration
titled "Stanford United." Halfway
through the event, Blake Parkinson
'lO emerged from Robert S. Moore
House playing "Amazing Grace" on
bagpipes, the crowd joining in after a
cheer.
Calling the picketers "clowns," a
juggler in a bow tie tossed beanbags in
the air on the same street corner.
Plenty of students brought signs,
too. "Gay is OK," one read. "I love
Jews," said another. One student car
ried his sign "Don't feed the
trolls" while wearing a bright pink

bunny suit.
John Machacon 'l3 and several
others carried signs reading, "Out of
many, one."
"At Mass, the priest suggested we
come out to support our fellow man,"
Machacon said. "This group is about
hating people for who they are, and
I'm not okay with that at all."
About 40 of the students in atten
dance were volunteer marshals
working with the Stanford
Department of Public Safety (DPS).
They met inside the Ziff Center
behind Hillel at 7:20 a.m. for a brief
ing from police Sgt. Hilary Karp on
how to make sure the gathering
remained calm.
Afterward, the volunteers donned
bright purple T-shirts and formed a
human barrier at the edge of the
Hillel lawn in case the Westboro
group approached the crowd.
"We were prepared for them to
come onto the sidewalk, but things
were really calm," said George
Michopoulos 'l3, one of the volun
teers.
Department police officers were
out in full force as well. About eight
uniformed officers kept watch on the
Hillel grounds while another four
monitored the event directly across
the street. Lapin confirmed that plain
clothes policemen were on duty as
well.
The DPS also barricaded the

lower block of Mayfield Avenue to
traffic at 8 a.m. as people streamed
toward Hillel from both directions.
Police lifted the barricade at 9 a.m.
Other than the tire slashing, the
gathering passed without incident.
The crowd began to disperse after the
Westboro protesters left at 8:45 a.m.,
though many stayed, as "All You
Need is Love" blared from a speaker
outside Casa Italiana and the
Stanford Band ran in to cheers.
Never ones to pass up a tongue-in
cheek joke, the set list included
Squirrel Nut Zipper's "Hell" and
Green Day's "Welcome to Paradise,"
After the Band left, the roadblocks
were gone and there was little physi
cal evidence of the gathering except
for thousands of footprints on Hillel's
front lawn. The emotional evidence
lasted longer.
"1 thought it went really well," said
Molly Bauer 'l2. "The bagpipes were
great."
"ft was incredible to come around
the corner and see all the people
already there," said Daniel Mattis 'l2,
who worried that the early time
would keep students from showing
support. "It was just amazing."
Jordan Knox 'lO may have put the
general feeling best.
"You gotta love the love," he said.

Stanford's athletic history, and showcased several memorabilia items, including the original wooden handle of
the Axe, a silk scarf from the 1941 Rose Bowl and a signed Toby Gerhart program. The event was sponsored
by Green Teas, the undergraduate division of Special Collections. About 30 people attended the event.

Police estimated that between 800 and 1,000 members of the Stanford community attended Friday's counter-protest,
organized by Hillel and the Jewish Student Association. Five Westboro members, not pictured, were present.
In a moment that became a rallying
point for a wide swath of the Stanford com
munity, hundreds of people gathered Friday
morning outside Hillel House and along
Mayfield Avenue to respond to five pick
eters from the Kansas-based fringe group
Westboro Baptist Church.
Police estimate that 800 to 1,000 people,
mostly Stanford-affiliated, turned out
Friday morning. The gathering, dubbed
"Stanford United" by organizers from
Hillel and the Jewish Student Association,
drowned out the Westboro demonstrators
and went largely without incident.
Students began to gather at Hillel more
than an hour ahead of the Kansas group's
8:10 a.m. arrival time in response to a week
long organizing campaign against
Westboro's visit. By the time the five
Westboro members arrived on the corner
of Campus Drive and Mayfield Avenue,
