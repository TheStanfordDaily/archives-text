## Banerjee is named 2010 Pearl intern 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
Devin Banerjee 'll, former editor in chief of The
Stanford Daily, has been named the 2010 Daniel
Pearl Memorial Journalism intern.
Selected by Stanford communications faculty and
Wall Street Journal staff, Banerjee will work in a for
eign bureau of the Wall Street Journal this summer.
The internship began in 2003 to commemorate the
work of Daniel Pearl 'B5. Pearl, a communications
major at Stanford, was kidnapped and killed in
Pakistan in 2002 while working as a foreign corre
spondent for the Wall Street Journal.
Banerjee, who is majoring in management science
and engineering with a concentration in technology
and policy, was selected from an applicant pool of
Stanford undergraduates and graduate students.
"In his best reporting," Banerjee wrote in his
application essay, "Daniel Pearl found and rooted his
stories in conversations with everyday people, for it
often was their absence from the larger conversation
that yielded a nature of misunderstanding the fail
ure to connect the dots."
During his work at The Stanford Daily, the San
Jose Mercury News and the JoongAng Daily in
Seoul, Korea, Banerjee said, "allowing the voices of
dignified individuals to shine through my words has
been a responsibility both heavy and incomparably
gratifying."
Banerjee, a native of Calabasas, Calif.,
ended his term as editor of The Daily's
Volume 236 last week. He is the son of
Dave and Radhika Banerjee.
