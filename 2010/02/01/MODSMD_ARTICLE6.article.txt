# Savage, demystified
## "Mythbusters" co-host addresses students 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Loud applause from a full house of
more than 700 Stanford students at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium — some of
whom donned Star Trooper helmets for
the occasion — greeted television's
"Mythbusters" co-host Adam Savage as
he stepped onto the stage last night, fire
extinguisher in tow, for a stroll down
memory lane and a behind-the-scenes
look at the show.
In its seventh season, "Mythbusters"
has documented more than 180 hours'
worth of separating truth from myth.
But, for the special effects extraordinaire
k.

and his co-host, Jamie Hyneman, the
most rewarding aspect of their job still
lies in the process versus the actual dis
covery.
"We don't really care about the
myths," Savage said. "No urban legend
researcher has ever e-mailed us and
thanked us for the groundbreaking work
we've done.
"For us, the pleasure's in the build
ing," he added. "There's still that honest
and pure pleasure of how are we going
to do this, how are we going to solve this
problem."
