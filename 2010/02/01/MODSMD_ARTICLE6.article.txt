# Savage, demystified
## "Mythbusters" co-host addresses students 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Loud applause from a full house of
more than 700 Stanford students at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium — some of
whom donned Star Trooper helmets for
the occasion — greeted television's
"Mythbusters" co-host Adam Savage as
he stepped onto the stage last night, fire
extinguisher in tow, for a stroll down
memory lane and a behind-the-scenes
look at the show.
In its seventh season, "Mythbusters"
has documented more than 180 hours'
worth of separating truth from myth.
But, for the special effects extraordinaire
k.

and his co-host, Jamie Hyneman, the
most rewarding aspect of their job still
lies in the process versus the actual dis
covery.
"We don't really care about the
myths," Savage said. "No urban legend
researcher has ever e-mailed us and
thanked us for the groundbreaking work
we've done.
"For us, the pleasure's in the build
ing," he added. "There's still that honest
and pure pleasure of how are we going
to do this, how are we going to solve this
problem."

"For us, the pleasure's in the building," said Adam Savage, the co-host of television's "Mythbusters" at Dinkelspiel Sunday night.
Speaking at Stanford was especially
exciting for Savage, he said, because he
was able to share the same passion
with his audience,
"Knowing Stanford's emphasis on
science [and] what a good rigorous
school it is, I know that the crowd is
going to be a bright crowd," he said.
"They're livelier, they watch with a lot
more perceivance, they get angrier
when we screw things up that just
means that the dialogue's going to be
better."
The question and answer portion at
the end of the event featured students'
personal scientific queries, including
whether the legend about the Stanford
Band rocking an airplane by running
from side to side is actually plausible.
While Savage's main goal was to
give his audience an overview of what

it's actually like to do the show, he did
not skip out on sharing his own child
hood experiences and his insights on
the age-old college question of what
do to do after graduation.
Hosting a show like "Mythbusters"
allowed Savage to reconcile the
diverse mix of interests he developed
in his adolescence, he said.
"I spent a lot of time in my 20s
thinking that I was wasting too much
time and not doing anything," he said,
"but I'm really glad that it took as
long as it did. The thing I would go
back and say to my 20-year-old self is
that: you have plenty of time, I'll end
up being really good at the thing I
want to do."
Though many were inspired by
Savage's story, for the most part, his
Stanford audience was more excited
about being able to have such an inti
mate conversation.
"As far as what he was talking
about, he talks about having an eclec
tic group of interest and I guess I res
onated with that," said Michael

Gummelt 'll. "[But] it wasn't so much
what he was talking about more just
like how he was talking with every
body, how comfortable and causal the
whole thing was."
Hannah King 'l3 agreed.
"I liked seeing him in person and
getting to know his personality a lit
tle," she said. It seems a lot like it is in
the show so that me it cool to know
that he's a genuine type of guy."
The hour-long event was spon
sored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau
and Stanford Scientific Magazine.
"Our main mission is to take all the
technical and scientific research at
Stanford and to make it accessible to
people who are not so interested in
science," said Liz Burnstein 'lO, editor
in chief of Stanford Scientific. "So by
making science fun, Adam Savage is a
really good way to get people interest
ed in science who might not otherwise
be."
