## One student's running diary of the Westboro Baptist Church protest Why so serious, Stanford? 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY STAFF WRITER 
In the days after the original "Some Pretty Awful People Coming
to Stanford" e-mail made the rounds informing us of the upcom
ing visit from Westboro Baptist Church, a few friends and I began
to brainstorm some counter-protest ideas. They included, but
were not limited to, a reading of the Vagina Monologues and
ghost riding down Mayfield. But more seriously, our collective hope
was that Stanford's famed eccentric side (see: Synergy's penchant for
streaking) would come out to play. Accordingly, I volunteered to write
a running diary of the day's events.
But instead of recapping a morning of creative responses, the lone
recourse was a gathering in the name of "unity," "tolerance" and
"diversity," and everyone had to play along. The irony of silencing stu
dent expression by making them conform to one response, while allow
ing a hate group to freely speak on campus, was not lost on many.
Instead of a clever retort (see: University of Chicago and Oberlin
College), this disingenuous attempt to make everyone feel wanted was
disheartening at best it was only Westboro's presence that prompt
ed such a gathering, and it was undertaken as a form of crowd control
as much as anything else. This, though, only begins to scratch the sur
face.
Contrary to the community's perpetual non-confrontational stand,
there are times when groups are so universally hated that making them
feel unwelcome is exactly what's in order. It is a rare occurrence, but
when it happens, it is a waste not to capitalize on it.
Which is to say: the reactions herein are unadulterated, and while I
had hoped that they would be focused mainly on our dear friends from
Kansas, they are equally about Stanford's lack of a response. The police
estimated that between 800 and 1,000 people showed up on Friday
morning, but for what? Let's go to the tape.
7:30 a.m. Hop out of bed, immediately regret my decision, look
forsome rat poison to mainline, emerge unsuccessful.
8:08 a.m. Collect compatriots; saunter over to Hillel as the SUPD
barricades Mayfield.
8:12 a.m. No one here. There were rumors that Westboro might
not make it, but that's not their M.O.
8:13 a.m. "Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"?
8:15 a.m. They have arrived. I must admit, part of my motivation
for coming out was to see Westboro in the flesh. Many
share my initial fascination. As someone in the crowd
notes, "It's like we're watching animals in a zoo."
8:16 a.m. It's noted here "explain that comment." The zoo analo
gy works on many levels, as there is a legion of adminis
trators and purple-clad volunteers preventing students
from coming onto the sidewalk. There's a 25-foot buffer
that makes any interaction practically impossible.
8:20 a.m. I notice one of the first and only lever signs: "Gay
for Fred Phelps." This is soon followed by a virtuous lad
in a rabbit suit holding a poster saying, "Don't feed the
trolls."
8:22 a.m. Nearsightedness be damned, I pick out a supposed
Bible passage. According to Westboro, Matthew 19:5
says, "Fags can't marry." We can go out on a limb and say
that no, that's not what's written.
8:25 a.m. Back to the hidden rope line. A few souls have made it
to Westboro's vicinity. One is a former Marine
remember, the "church" applauds lEDs who remains
unflinching in his stance and subsequent glare. We learn
later that one protestor wanted him arrested for stalk
ing. That would have been a sight to see: the police ush
ering away or cuffing a non-violent veteran.
8:26 a.m. "You have to move back two feet, just two feet." I will
hear this phrase no less than a dozen times over the
course of the morning. A strange dichotomy exists. The
administrators are actively asking students, "Why don't
you make some noise and get excited" this, as heard
from no less than three different people while simul
taneously confining them to an area where Talisman is
drowned out and frankly, nothing is happening.
8:28 a.m. A list of songs that, so far, Westboro has changed the
lyrics to: Hatikva, Hey Jude and Hava Nagila. A great
response? 500 people doing an impromptu hurrah.
Does it happen? No.
8:29 a.m. Signs of life. A bagpiper emerges from Bob. The crowd
roars.
8:30 a.m. Although our musician seems content to stay on the
other side of the street, the ever-righteous Dean Julie
makes sure he makes it across to Hillel. Excellent.
Bagpipes and a kilt at 8:30 in the morning? This is more
like it.
8:37 a.m. An odd sequence of events. A few friends and I begin
guessing the ages of the protestors some, we reckon,
are college age. The administrators once again tell us to
back our collective asses up, so we wave goodbye to our
visitors. This prompts one girl to smile back and blush.
No, hun, you're not my type. On one level, you have to
feel for some of the younger members indoctrinated
from a young age, prevented from doing much of any
thing else, and so on. Which is nice for a moment, but
nay, you most certainly do not have to feel much of any
thing but vitriol toward them.

The notepad runs out there. Sometime in the near future, Westboro
left without much of a sound. The Band showed up moments later and
played for a few minutes. It was, predictably, the most fun part of the
morning a display of true Stanford culture. The word was that,
because of the Band's tendency to get rowdy, they decided to not come
until later. And yet, because of the inadvertent human barricade
between the Band, situated adjacent to Hillel, and the street, there was
little chance for harm.
The missed opportunities abounded, although, as we would hear
later, some entrepreneurial fellows took it upon themselves to slash
Westboro's tires. Upon hearing the news, Dean Schaffer 'lO put it best:
"God hates AAA." And while that was no activity that many con
doned, sad faces were hard to come by the general reaction was
"good" and "well deserved." That says a lot the visceral feelings that
a large part of the community felt toward Westboro were teeming, and
yet the only recourse for that anger was in the unfortunate form of
vandalism. Instead of showing the public our ingenuity, we bottled it up
until someone broke in a criminal way.
Was it a waste of a morning? Hardly, but it said volumes about the
Stanford experience.

The Tree, along with 800 to 1,000 Stanford students, gathered in front of Hillel to show their commitment to "unity,
tolerance and diversity" when five members of the Westboro Baptist Church brandished anti-gay and anti-Semitic
protest signs along Mayfield Avenue on Friday morning.

from coming onto the sidewalk. There's a 25-foot buffer
that makes any interaction practically impossible.
8:20 a.m. I notice one of the first and only lever signs: "Gay
for Fred Phelps." This is soon followed by a virtuous lad
in a rabbit suit holding a poster saying, "Don't feed the
trolls."
8:22 a.m. Nearsightedness be damned, I pick out a supposed
Bible passage. According to Westboro, Matthew 19:5
says, "Fags can't marry." We can go out on a limb and say
that no, that's not what's written.
8:25 a.m. Back to the hidden rope line. A few souls have made it
to Westboro's vicinity. One is a former Marine
remember, the "church" applauds lEDs who remains
unflinching in his stance and subsequent glare. We learn
later that one protestor wanted him arrested for stalk
ing. That would have been a sight to see: the police ush
ering away or cuffing a non-violent veteran.
8:26 a.m. "You have to move back two feet, just two feet." I will
hear this phrase no less than a dozen times over the
course of the morning. A strange dichotomy exists. The
administrators are actively asking students, "Why don't
you make some noise and get excited" this, as heard
from no less than three different people while simul
taneously confining them to an area where Talisman is
drowned out and frankly, nothing is happening.
8:28 a.m. A list of songs that, so far, Westboro has changed the
lyrics to: Hatikva, Hey Jude and Hava Nagila. A great
response? 500 people doing an impromptu hurrah.
Does it happen? No.
8:29 a.m. Signs of life. A bagpiper emerges from Bob. The crowd
roars.
8:30 a.m. Although our musician seems content to stay on the
other side of the street, the ever-righteous Dean Julie
makes sure he makes it across to Hillel. Excellent.
Bagpipes and a kilt at 8:30 in the morning? This is more
like it.
8:37 a.m. An odd sequence of events. A few friends and I begin
guessing the ages of the protestors some, we reckon,
are college age. The administrators once again tell us to
back our collective asses up, so we wave goodbye to our
visitors. This prompts one girl to smile back and blush.
No, hun, you're not my type. On one level, you have to
feel for some of the younger members indoctrinated
from a young age, prevented from doing much of any
thing else, and so on. Which is nice for a moment, but
nay, you most certainly do not have to feel much of any
thing but vitriol toward them.

The notepad runs out there. Sometime in the near future, Westboro
left without much of a sound. The Band showed up moments later and
played for a few minutes. It was, predictably, the most fun part of the
morning a display of true Stanford culture. The word was that,
because of the Band's tendency to get rowdy, they decided to not come
until later. And yet, because of the inadvertent human barricade
between the Band, situated adjacent to Hillel, and the street, there was
little chance for harm.
The missed opportunities abounded, although, as we would hear
later, some entrepreneurial fellows took it upon themselves to slash
Westboro's tires. Upon hearing the news, Dean Schaffer 'lO put it best:
"God hates AAA." And while that was no activity that many con
doned, sad faces were hard to come by the general reaction was
"good" and "well deserved." That says a lot the visceral feelings that
a large part of the community felt toward Westboro were teeming, and
yet the only recourse for that anger was in the unfortunate form of
vandalism. Instead of showing the public our ingenuity, we bottled it up
until someone broke in a criminal way.
Was it a waste of a morning? Hardly, but it said volumes about the
Stanford experience.

Contrary to the community's perpetual
non-confrontational stand, there are times when
groups are so universally hated that making
them feel unwelcome is exactly what's in order.

The Tree, along with 800 to 1,000 Stanford students, gathered in front of Hillel to show their commitment to "unity,
tolerance and diversity" when five members of the Westboro Baptist Church brandished anti-gay and anti-Semitic
protest signs along Mayfield Avenue on Friday morning.
In the days after the original "Some Pretty Awful People Coming
to Stanford" e-mail made the rounds informing us of the upcom
ing visit from Westboro Baptist Church, a few friends and I began
to brainstorm some counter-protest ideas. They included, but
were not limited to, a reading of the Vagina Monologues and
ghost riding down Mayfield. But more seriously, our collective hope
was that Stanford's famed eccentric side (see: Synergy's penchant for
streaking) would come out to play. Accordingly, I volunteered to write
a running diary of the day's events.
But instead of recapping a morning of creative responses, the lone
recourse was a gathering in the name of "unity," "tolerance" and
"diversity," and everyone had to play along. The irony of silencing stu
dent expression by making them conform to one response, while allow
ing a hate group to freely speak on campus, was not lost on many.
Instead of a clever retort (see: University of Chicago and Oberlin
College), this disingenuous attempt to make everyone feel wanted was
disheartening at best it was only Westboro's presence that prompt
ed such a gathering, and it was undertaken as a form of crowd control
as much as anything else. This, though, only begins to scratch the sur
face.
Contrary to the community's perpetual non-confrontational stand,
there are times when groups are so universally hated that making them
feel unwelcome is exactly what's in order. It is a rare occurrence, but
when it happens, it is a waste not to capitalize on it.
Which is to say: the reactions herein are unadulterated, and while I
had hoped that they would be focused mainly on our dear friends from
Kansas, they are equally about Stanford's lack of a response. The police
estimated that between 800 and 1,000 people showed up on Friday
morning, but for what? Let's go to the tape.
7:30 a.m. Hop out of bed, immediately regret my decision, look
forsome rat poison to mainline, emerge unsuccessful.
8:08 a.m. Collect compatriots; saunter over to Hillel as the SUPD
barricades Mayfield.
8:12 a.m. No one here. There were rumors that Westboro might
not make it, but that's not their M.O.
8:13 a.m. "Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"?
8:15 a.m. They have arrived. I must admit, part of my motivation
for coming out was to see Westboro in the flesh. Many
share my initial fascination. As someone in the crowd
notes, "It's like we're watching animals in a zoo."
8:16 a.m. It's noted here "explain that comment." The zoo analo
gy works on many levels, as there is a legion of adminis
trators and purple-clad volunteers preventing students
from coming onto the sidewalk. There's a 25-foot buffer
that makes any interaction practically impossible.
