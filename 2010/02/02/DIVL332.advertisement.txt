Robert and Florence McDonnell Professor of East European Studies, Department of History. By courtesy:
Senior Fellow, Freeman Spogli Institute, Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution, Professor, German Studies.
This lecture summarizes the argument of a forthcoming book (Suhrkamp, Princeton University Press) that
Stalin's crimes of the 1930s should be considered genocide. This requires a review of historical/legal concepts
of genocide and of the mass killing of the period itself. This event marks the Stanford inauguration of the
series developed with the Forum on Contemporary Europe at FSI, in partnership with Suhrkamp Verlag.
Introduction by Amir Eshel, Director, Forum on Contemporary Europe. Commentary by Yuri Slezkine, W. Glenn
Campbell and Rita Ricardo-Campbell National Fellow, Hoover Institution.
