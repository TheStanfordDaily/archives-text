served as an officer in the Israel Defense Forces, in the paratroopers in the Lebanon War, a
liaison with the U.S. Sixth Fleet during the Gulf War, and an IDF spokesman during the Second
Lebanon War and the recent Gaza operation. He acted as an Israeli emissary to Jewish
refuseniks in the Soviet Union, as an advisor to Israel's delegation to the United Nations, and as
the government's director of Inter-Religious Affairs. He has testified before Congress and briefed
the White House on Middle Eastern affairs. Ambassador Oren is married to Sally, and they have
