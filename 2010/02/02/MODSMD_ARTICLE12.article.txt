## EDITORIAL In the face of hatred, the campus comes together 
### 
Friday morning at 8 a.m., at a time when
you would usually be hard-pressed to
find many students awake on campus,
over a hundred students, faculty and com
munity members gathered on the front lawn
at Hillel to make a united stand for toler
ance. When word first reached campus that
the gay-hating, Jew-hating, America-hating
zealots of Fred Phelps' Westboro Baptist
Church were coming here to protest, there
was an immediate sense that Stanford must
come together to counter their hatred. And
counter is exactly what we did in such
great force that the handful of Westboro
protestors looked even more pathetic by
contrast.
In our first statement of the new editori
al volume, the Editorial Board would like
to commend all of those who came togeth
er on Friday to show that diversity and tol
erance are among Stanford's highest val
ues. In the face of the Phelps clan's animos
ity, the different segments of the Stanford
community gay and straight, Catholic
and Protestant, Jew and Gentile, etc.
came together to reinforce the unity of the
University. And in traditional Stanford
style, we met hatred not with additional ha
tred, but with camaraderie, song and posi
tive celebration. It was a proud moment for
the campus.
Even now, it is unclear exactly what the
Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) was
thinking in coming to campus in the first
place. Perhaps they sincerely thought that
they could have an effect on students' think
ing and round up a few converts. Or maybe

they just hoped that they could incite the
campus to impede on their rights, thus al
lowing them to file a lawsuit to raise money
for future protests. Whatever the case, their
efforts failed to attract any new support and
instead backfired to such a degree that
members of the LGBT community were
brought together in solidarity with repre
sentatives of campus religious groups. The
outcome of the protest was one of the most
positive expressions of commonality we've
seen on campus since we upset USC.
The term "commonality" can be accu
rately used in reference to the Stanford com
munity, not to be confused with "conformi
ty," the ideal which the WBC flock seems to
hold up as the will of God. It makes sense, re
ally, that a place like Stanford should attract
the ire of an organization like WBC
whereas Stanford, like many universities,
works hard to embrace diversity of belief,
thought and lifestyle, Fred Phelps and the
rest of WBC see this kind of diversity as an
affront to their absolutist worldview. Their
hatred is born out of the belief that they have
a perfect understanding of what God wants,
and thus how the world should be. It is a view
that stands in philosophical opposition to
the principles of a modern university, in
which ideas and ideals alike are evaluated
with open skepticism, and in which there is
often no single correct answer. In standing
up against the zealotry and rigidness of the
WBC clan, the Stanford community showed
the world that, though we may often dis
agree with each other, we can still come to
gether for each other.
