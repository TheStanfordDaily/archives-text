# JUST A THOUGHT
## I probably have more friends than you 
### Nikola Milanovic 
I used to be unaware of how popular I was.
Thanks to Facebook, I now know exactly
how social I am, down to an exact num
ber! With the advent of Facebook and other
social networking websites, we have all be
come seamlessly connected. I can talk to my
friends anytime from anywhere, see what
people have been up to and make plans for
the future. But the coolest part of all is that,
with Facebook, popularity is now a numbers
game.
Scoring people is easy: all you have to do
is look at someone's profile. From their page,
you can quickly pull up their friend count (ar
guably the most crucial number for deter
mining how sociable someone is), the num
ber of photos they appear in and other per
formance stats like number of gifts, bumper
stickers, etc. Other variables come into play
but are harder to divine, like how many
groups someone is in or how many events
they are attending. This ability to quantify
how social someone is must come as a breath
of fresh air to math geeks and statistics
junkies, who can now easily plug in numbers
to get a quantitative reading on someone's
popularity. Maybe we can even look forward
to the development of a formula like the
NFL's passer rating to calculate people's
popularity level! (Stats honors thesis?)
As cool as it is to have our social lives nar
rowed down to a science by Facebook, is it
possible that it's changing how we interact
with each other for the worse? The introduc
tion of numbers into our personal worlds
seems to be creating an arms race of friend
requests and pokes. This isn't anything new:
it's the same phenomenon as people packing
their cell phones with as many contacts as
possible. It's the same as Valentine's Day in
high school, when people would proudly dis
play how many candy grams and balloons
they had received while walking down the
hall (Glenn Coco always won). It's less about
making substantive connections and more
about displaying the number of connections.
It doesn't matter as much that you appear in
good photos as it does that you appear in
many. Facebook has changed the playing
field, to an extent, so that it's all about the
numbers.

I'll admit that I play the game as much as
anyone else. I take my time accepting friend
requests and event invitations. I like it when I
see my Wall full of other people's posts (I'm
shallow). I let my eyes wander to someone
else's friend and photo counts when I'm
looking at their profiles, and give myself a
small (and insecure, obviously) mental high
five if I have more than them. Maybe it's un
healthy that we're allowing our online per
sonas to be caught up in this arms race.
Maybe it's cheapening what we consider to
be our social lives. I get friend requests from
time to time from people I've never talked to
or met. People living on the other side of the

US invite me to their events to boost the
RSVP count. I mean, come on, who actually
has over 1,000 friends that they want to ac
tively keep in touch with?
The unsettling part isn't just that we're al
lowing our online personas to be affected by
the numbers and revisionist personal history
we try to micromanage. Our statistics on
Facebook translate into how we interact in
the real world. Never have so many photos
been taken at parties to boost picture counts
and create permanent records of every mo
ment. Never before have people insisted that
someone they meet friend request them (or
accept their request) in order to solidify their
friendship.
Maybe if Facebook eliminated numbers,
we would see a change in how people act so
cially outside of the Internet. Maybe party
time wouldn't be lost to ensuring that every
one gets into a photo to prove they were
there and boost their count. Maybe friend re
quests would drop dramatically if we could
n't prominently display to each other how
many friends we have. Facebook already
eliminated the number showing how many
wall posts we have. It could be time to follow
suit by eliminating numbers in general from
the site, so that we stop trying to quantify our
social lives and start trying to qualitatively
improve them. The number of 'real' connec
tions we make has nowhere to go but up
when we finally stop friending people we
don't even know because there's no score to
show for it. Maybe without numbers, we can
get back to living our lives.
