# INNOVATE AMERICA
## A
						Critical Moment for Energy Leadership 
### Teryn Norris 
One of the most powerful moments dur
ing last week's State of the Union
came when President Obama warned
that while Washington stalls, other nations are
moving quickly to dominate the global clean
energy industry.
"China is not waiting to revamp its econo
my," Obama declared. "These nations aren't
playing for second place ... They're making
serious investments in clean energy because
they want those jobs. Well, I do not accept sec
ond place for the United States of America ..
. The nation that leads the clean-energy econ
omy will be the nation that leads the global
economy. And America must be that nation."
Obama is right, and as always, his words
were eloquent. Now his administration must
get to work and advance a real strategy for
global energy leadership.
The current proposals under considera
tion in Congress are far too weak. China,
Japan and South Korea are launching mas
sive, comprehensive clean-energy projects,
investing a combined total of around $5OO bil
lion over the next five years. In contrast, the
House-passed American Clean Energy & Se
curity Act (ACES A), combined with the 2009
economic recovery package, poises the U.S.
government to invest only $172 billion in this
industry over the next five years, according to
a recent report I co-authored with the Break
through Institute and Information Technolo
gy and Innovation Foundation.
That is hardly an effective strategy for en
ergy leadership, and advocates should be
careful about labeling the House and Senate
climate bills as comprehensive solutions for
U.S. clean-tech competitiveness.
In July 2009, a group of 34 Nobel Laure
ates wrote a letter to President Obama decry
ing this lack of investment and urging his sup
port for $l5 billion per year in clean energy

R&D. "We are concerned that [ACESA] pro
vides less than one fifteenth of the amount
you proposed for federal energy research, de
velopment, and demonstration programs,"
they wrote, "This stable R&D spending is not
a luxury. It is in fact necessary because rapid
scientific and technical progress is crucial to
achieving these goals, and to making the cost
affordable."

A large and growing body of technology
experts agree. In recent congressional testi
mony, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu stat
ed, "I am concerned that we have not ade
quately focused on the importance of re
search and development of new energy tech
nologies."
Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), Chair
man of the Senate Energy & Commerce
Committee, recently said, "It is troubling that
current legislative proposals before Congress
to address climate change give relatively low
emphasis to providing funding for the needed
science and technology."

And in his recent "Annual Letter" for the
Gates Foundation, Bill Gates wrote, "I
looked at Waxman Markey [cap and trade cli
mate legislation] and the research thing was
miniscule."

Indeed, these proposals contain danger
ously low levels of support for technology de
velopment. ACESA would only invest $1

tol .5 billion per year in clean energy R&D, on
top of the current federal energy R&D budg
et of around $4 billion per year (only a por
tion is for renewable energy). Meanwhile, the
National Institutes of Health receives $3O bil
lion in federal R&D, while the Department of
Defense receives a whopping $B5 billion.
Now is a critical moment. Copenhagen
came and went with few results. The national
climate agenda is on the verge of collapse.The
tide is rapidly rising against greater federal in
vestment. And Asia is moving at break-neck
speeds to dominate this industry and seize the
mantle of global economic leadership.
Fifty years ago, in the wake of the launch of
Sputnik, the United States rose to the mo
ment and launched a massive national effort
to lead the space race and win the Cold War.
Today, the clean energy race represents one
of the greatest opportunities and challenges
for American leadership in a generation, and
it demands a similar national mobilization.

If the administration and Congress do not
take swift action to invest $l5 to 30 billion an
nually in federal clean energy R&D along
with a broader set of investments in clean en
ergy deployment, infrastructure and educa
tion the United States will miss a historic
opportunity to strengthen our economy, cre
ate new jobs, improve our energy security and
lead the world in confronting climate change.
A decade from now, we may still find the
prosperous clean-energy economy promised
by our national leadership. It will simply be
headquartered in China.
