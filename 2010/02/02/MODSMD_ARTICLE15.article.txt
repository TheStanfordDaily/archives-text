# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,

I know that irony is one of the main privi
leges granted to college students, but even so,
the bad vibes emanating from Wyndam
Makowsky's Feb. 1 article ("Why So serious,
Stanford?"), disparaging Friday's counter
rally to the Westboro Baptist Church's
protest, shocked me. Makowsky bemoaned
the fact that "instead 0f...a morning of cre
ative responses, the lone recourse was a gath
ering in the name of "unity,""tolerance" and
"diversity," and everyone had to play along."
Fie also charged that "it was only Westboro's
presence that prompted a gathering, and it
was undertaken as a form of crowd control as
much as anything else." Finally, he attributes
the slashed tires to the fact that "instead of
showing the public our ingenuity, we bottled
it up until someone broke in a criminal way."
I'd like to answer these complaints in turn.
"Everyone had to play along." At the rally,
I felt an atmosphere of excitement and even
joy that I'd never felt before at Stanford. Am I
biased? Sure. But it seemed to me, at least, that
the vast majority of people at the rally did not
feel forced into anything. Makowsky com
pared our rally to one at the University of
Chicago, where students mocked the WBC by
staging an imitation protest against figs, based
on the biblical passage where Jesus smites a fig
tree. I agree that that was a creative and hilar
ious stunt. But did it have any impact on the
WBC? The Chicago Maroon, in their article
about the protest, quoted Shirley Phelps as
saying, "I truly and dearly love [the counter
protest]. It is so awesome when you juxtapose
this little group of servants of God [The WBC]
with this restless mob of humanity." The point
I'm trying to make is that nothing any count
er-protest can do will change these people's
minds or message,
"It was only Westboro's presence that
prompted such a gathering." Of course it was.
When there's no threat to members our com
munity, why would we all gather in solidari
ty? Isn't it worth celebrating that when the
WBC targeted Hillel, and the LGBTQ com-

munity, the rest of Stanford came out to show
support and love? And, in fact, student
groups such as F.A.I.T.H. and the QSA have
been quietly promoting interfaith and inter
sexuality action for some time. They do not
need the WBC to spark their desire for plu
ralism and love.
"It was undertaken as a form of crowd
control as much as anything else." Guilty as
charged. I was at the planning meeting for the
rally, along with representatives from all of
Stanford's religious and ethnic communities
and the police department. It was brought up
that the church tries to provoke people to at
tack them so that they can sue for damages.
We decided as a group to organize a peaceful,
positive rally to prevent such an event from
happening.
Finally, about the slashed tires. Is that re-

ally the most "ingenious" thing a repressed
Stanford student could come up with?
Just as members of the various email dis
cussions around campus considered ignoring
the WBC, so as not to win them any media at
tention, I considered not responding to Wyn
dam's article. For one thing, I knew how
much social cachet I'd lose by being so self
righteous. But I have to believe that some
times it is important to be earnest, and that
facing the world with irony alone will do
nothing to alleviate the serious problems on
earth. So even if the counter-rally meant
nothing to Wyndam or the Westboro Baptist
Church, it meant something to me.

Sincerely,
NATHANIEL EISEN
