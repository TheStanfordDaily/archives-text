## A
						truly 'super' bowl 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
As a Colts fan, sports fan,
American and human
being, I feel it is my duty to
start off this volume with a
Super Bowl column.
After all, how many sporting events
can capture people's interest on a year
ly basis the way the Super Bowl does?
Whether you watch it because you're at
a party, or because you're that person
that likes to gloat about watching the
commercials but not the game (you
know who you are), or you want to
watch some rock stars way past their
prime perform at halftime (this year it's
The Who), or you actually want to see
the football game, chances are you'll be
watching this Sunday.
For those of you in the first three
categories, you might want to check out
the game taking place in between the
side bets, drinking games, abortion ads
and cringe-worthy ex-rockers.
Why?
For one thing, this year's Super
Bowl is finally doing what few champi
onship games ever do: matching up the
two best teams in the league. After
near-perfect regular seasons and suc
cessful (if not dominant) postseasons,
the Indianapolis Colts and New Or
leans Saints are indisputably (unless
you're a Vikings fans or Rex Ryan) the
two best teams in the NFL, and no one
can legitimately challenge them. The
Saints won their first 13 games this sea
son, more games than 30 teams won all
season. The only team better was the
Colts, who won their first 14 games be
fore resting for their playoff run.
Also, these teams are fun.This won't
be a field position struggle where pun
ters mean more than quarterbacks.
This won't be the 2008 Sun Bowl or
Browns-Bills in 2009. Peyton Manning
is well-known for his ability to make big
plays in the passing game (see last
week's 377 passing yards against the
NFL's best defense). Rookie receivers
Austin Collie and Pierre Garcon have
been added to Reggie Wayne and Dal
las Clark to give the Colts a variety of
weapons.
The Saints have even more poten
tial for exciting plays. Drew Brees has
as good of an arm as anyone in foot
ball, and he shows it off on a regular
basis. Reggie Bush disappears for
months on end, but when he does ap
pear, it's usually for an insane punt re
turn, run or reception. Sean Payton is
more willing to go for a crazy trick play
than any coach in the league, and that
won't change just because it's the play
offs (see the perfect flea-flicker against
the Cardinals). If this isn't enough for
you, the Saints also have the most fun
defense to watch. Why? Because they
find away to give up over 350 yards a
game and look like the worst defense
in football, and then Darren Sharper,
Jabari Greer or Tracy Porter immedi
ately return two interceptions for
touchdowns and the Saints win.

If you aren't in to the whole "good
football" aspect of the game, there's
also the human interest story to give
you something to root for. The Saints
have been one of the worst franchises
in sports for decades, even when they
were led by Peyton's dad, Archie Man
ning. Then, New Orleans got hit by
Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst
natural disasters in American history,
and the Superdome changed from an
athletic venue to a shelter for the newly
homeless. Even if you're the most cyni
cal person in the world, the way the dec
imated city of New Orleans rallied
around its football team and the Saints
responded by making a dream run to
the Super Bowl has to give you chills.
While the nation may be cheering
for New Orleans, the oddsmakers favor
the Colts, albeit by less than a touch
down. This might change based on the
health of Colts defensive end Dwight
Freeney, who could be the biggest dif
ference maker on that side of the ball.
The game could come down to protect
ing the quarterbacks. Robert Mathis
and the aforementioned Freeney are
always threats to any signal caller, while
the Saints defensive coordinator has
publicly stated his intentions for the
Saints to hit Manning hard even if
they get penalized for it.
Whoever wins, it figures to be a
back-and-forth battle with the best tal
ent and biggest audience the Super
Bowl has seen in years, and I can't wait
to watch it.

Jacob Jaffe somehow avoided rooting
for the Colts in his column. Congratulate
him for his restraint at
