# SERVING IT UP
## Card wins two, headed to NTI Championship 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team
punched its ticket to the National
Team Indoor Championships with
victories over UNC-Wilmington and
Oklahoma this weekend, improving
to 3-0 in the process.
No. 9 Stanford handled No. 57
UNC-Wilmington 6-1 on Friday af
ternoon and then cruised past No. 45
Oklahoma 7-0.
The Taube Family Tennis Stadium
served as one of fifteen host sites
around the country for the ITA Kick-
Off Weekend. Four teams competed
at each site for a spot in the National
Team Indoor Championships from
Feb. 12-15 in Charlottesville, Va.
Stanford swept the doubles
matches on Friday. The nation's No. 1
team of Stanford sophomores
Bradley Klahn and RyanThacher de
feated UNC-Wilmington's top pair
ing 8-3.
Senior Richard Wire and junior
Alex Clayton rolled with similar ease,
defeating the Seahawks' No. 57 dou
bles team of Max Ando Hirsh and
Kinshuk Sharma 8-3.
The third doubles match was sus
pended because the doubles point

had been clinched, but freshmen Matt
Kandath and Denis Lin were leading
6-5 at the time.
Stanford cruised in five of its six
singles matches on Friday. Klahn,
Clayton, Thacher, Wire and Hirsh
man all won their matches in straight
sets.
Stanford's only loss of the day
came at the hands of freshman Kosta
Blank, who defeated Kandath in the
No. 5 singles match in a third set
tiebreaker.
"The first step in beating a top-10
team is getting a look at one," said
third-year UNCW coach Mait
Du√üois. "You can't put a value on
this type of experience. We're a bet
ter team after a good, tough match
like this. Give credit to Stanford
they played well today and are a tal
ented team."
The Oklahoma Sooners defeated
the No. 44 ranked San Diego State
Aztecs 6-1 on Friday morning and
seemed poised to test the Cardinal

on Saturday.

Oklahoma and Stanford didn't
start their match until 3:45 p.m. on
Saturday afternoon because of wet
courts and a consolation match be
tween San Diego State and UNC
Wilmington that stretched on for
longer than expected.
As the day continued, Kandath
and Lin overcame a few questionable
calls to play their best doubles tennis
of the year and secure an easy 8-3 vic
tory.
"After a few slow starts in previous
matches, we knew that we had to
come out prepared for a good Okla
homa team," Kandath said. "We did a
good job avoiding unforced errors,
which really killed us in our last few
matches."
Klahn and Thacher breezed by the
Sooners' top doubles team 8-2. Wire
and Clayton's match was suspended,
but the duo was winning 7-6 at the
time.
The singles matches were much
closer than a 6-0 sweep would indi
cate. Oklahoma was close to winning
multiple matches, but could not seem
to catch a big point when it needed
one.
No. 54 Klahn posted his most im
pressive victory of the young dual
match season with a two-set sweep of
No. 10 Andrei Daescu. The 6-foot-6
Daescu is a national champion in his
native Romania. Klahn played Daes
cu last year in his first collegiate match
and bested him in three sets.

"I try not to think about it too

much," Klahn said of Daescu's gar
gantuan reach. "I just try to control
what I can control. He's going to get to
some more balls, but I'm always ex
pecting the ball to come back over the
net."
Klahn won the first set 6-2, but
needed a tiebreaker to win the second
set.
Clayton was losing 3-0 to No. 59
lonut Beleleu, when he mounted a
six-game winning streak to win the
set. He won the match with a 7-5 vic
tory in the second set.

Kandath and Hirshman had the
most impressive matches of the day at
the No. 5 and No. 6 singles slots, re
spectively. Kandath made quick work
of Lawrence Formentera 6-3,6-3. Hir
shman frustrated George Chanturia
into submission with a 6-2,6-1 victory.
Stanford will return to action on
Saturday, with a match against Hawaii
at 1 p.m. at the Taube Family Tennis
Center.
