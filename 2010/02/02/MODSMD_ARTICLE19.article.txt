### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the opening month of the Stanford
women's gymnastics season came to a
close, the team hoped to capitalize on the
major success of its first four meets in last
weekend's matchup with Oregon State
and Seattle Pacific. Yet after traveling to
Corvallis on Friday, the Card defeated
Seattle Pacific (188.100) but fell short of
the No. 6 Beavers, 196.225-195.775. Be
fore a crowd of 6,143 at Gill Coliseum,
Stanford pushed Oregon State to the end
of the final rotation, but was unable to
come through with the victory.
Now 3-2, the team still holds a win
ning record and a current No. 5 ranking,
mostly due to its upset of then-No. 1
UCLA on Jan. 24. The win over the Bru
ins served as an extreme confidence
builder, yet it was not sufficient to help
the Card realize its potential against the
Beavers, who maintained their undefeat
ed record and achieved their seventh win
of the season.
Stanford's first rotation score of
49.050 on the bars trailed OSU's 49.125

vault, giving the home team an early ad
vantage, This slight deficit held the Car
dinal back from gaining the lead for the
remainder of the meet, yet the team had
multiple opportunities to steal the top
spot, one of which occurred in the meet's
