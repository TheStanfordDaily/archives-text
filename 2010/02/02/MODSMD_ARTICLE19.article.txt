# CARDINAL EDGED OUT BY BEAVERS
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the opening month of the Stanford
women's gymnastics season came to a
close, the team hoped to capitalize on the
major success of its first four meets in last
weekend's matchup with Oregon State
and Seattle Pacific. Yet after traveling to
Corvallis on Friday, the Card defeated
Seattle Pacific (188.100) but fell short of
the No. 6 Beavers, 196.225-195.775. Be
fore a crowd of 6,143 at Gill Coliseum,
Stanford pushed Oregon State to the end
of the final rotation, but was unable to
come through with the victory.
Now 3-2, the team still holds a win
ning record and a current No. 5 ranking,
mostly due to its upset of then-No. 1
UCLA on Jan. 24. The win over the Bru
ins served as an extreme confidence
builder, yet it was not sufficient to help
the Card realize its potential against the
Beavers, who maintained their undefeat
ed record and achieved their seventh win
of the season.
Stanford's first rotation score of
49.050 on the bars trailed OSU's 49.125

vault, giving the home team an early ad
vantage, This slight deficit held the Car
dinal back from gaining the lead for the
remainder of the meet, yet the team had

spot, one of which occurred in the meet's

GAME NOTES: No. 5 Stanford took its second loss of the
season last weekend after a hard-fought competition
with No. 6 Oregon. Junior Shelley Alexander earned
the Cardinal's only individual victory of the night, tying
for first on the vault with a score of 9.90.

forced to count a fall on the floor, giv
ing Stanford the hope of a clutch
come-from-behind win, but OSU
senior Mandi Rodriguez capped off
the competition with a 9.90 to clinch
the victory for the opposition.
Junior Shelley Alexander
achieved Stanford's single individual
victory of the night, scoring a 9.90 to
tie for first place on the vault. In fact,
vault has consistently been the
team's strongest event, so the Cardi
nal looks to focus on improving
scores elsewhere, especially the bal
ance beam.
More individual highlights includ
ed strong performances from senior
Allyse Ishino, sophomore Nicole
Pechanec and senior Carly Janiga,
who each scored 9.8-plus in multiple
events. Ishino hit a 9.80 on vault, as
well as 9.85 on bars and beam. Janiga

went 9.875 on bars for her top score
among the four events, and Pechanec
achieved solid scores of 9.825 on bars
and 9.85 on floor. None of these was
enough, however, to put the Cardinal
ahead at any point in the meet.
Part of the difficulty can be attrib
uted to the challenge posed by com
peting on the road, especially since
Stanford has become so comfortable
in its home gym at Burnham Pavilion.
Risks taken during performances on
the Farm in front of a supportive
crowd have generally yielded promis
ing results and high scores, yet that
has not always been the case in the
opposing team's gym.
"We took some steps on beam and
had some pretty solid routines, but
there were some deductions here and
there," said head coach Kristen
Smyth. "We have to be undeniable
when we go on the road, or in any
arena. We can't make the mistakes
that allow judges the opportunity to
make deductions."
Though the loss was certainly a
disappointment, Smyth remains
pleased with the experience her team

gained from the demanding first four
weeks of competition.
"This has been an extraordinarily
challenging four weeks," Smyth said.
"To come within a tenth of a point of
the national champions on the road,
beating UCLA and coming to Ore
gon, we know we have to put out our
best effort.There are obviously places
they can improve, but this month has
served us very, very well as we go for
ward. It has been a great experience
and a great confidence builder."
"We're not even close to our po
tential, which is exciting," Smyth con
tinued. "There's so much to add and
improve upon."
Thus, expectations are high that
the team will be able to quickly
bounce back from the loss to OSU
and regain its previous momentum.
Stanford returns home for next Sun
day's four-way meet with San Jose
State, Washington and Sacramento
State in Burnham Pavilion.The events
begin at 2 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
