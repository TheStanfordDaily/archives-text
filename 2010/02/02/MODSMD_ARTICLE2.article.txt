## BJA plans alt. review process 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
Changes may be on the horizon
for the way Fundamental Standard
violations stemming from sexual
violence cases are handled at
Stanford.
The Board on Judicial Affairs is
set to meet today to continue plan
ning an "alternative review process"
for cases involving sexual violence
here.
The board, which began posting
its meeting minutes online this year,
has been in talks with the Sexual
Violence Advisory Board since May
2009 and could send a recommen
dation to President John Hennessy
by the end of the quarter, according
to board co-chair Ben Davidson, a
law student.
The board's minutes shed some
light on the historically private
group, which sets policy for the
Office of Judicial Affairs where,
among other things, students
respond to accusations of violating
the University's Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard. The office
oversaw 123 cases during the 2008-
2009 academic year.
Fundamental Standard viola
tions include sexual "misconduct,"
like assault or harassment. Judicial
Affairs oversaw one such case in fall
2008, the most recent quarter for
which statistics are publicly avail
able.
Davidson said that efforts to
change the way Judicial Affairs han
dles sexual violence cases began in
May, when representatives of
Stanford's Sexual Violence
Advisory Board came to the BJA to
make suggestions on how the cur
rent process, described in the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997,
"could be improved."
