## BJA plans alt. review process 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
Changes may be on the horizon
for the way Fundamental Standard
violations stemming from sexual
violence cases are handled at
Stanford.
The Board on Judicial Affairs is
set to meet today to continue plan
ning an "alternative review process"
for cases involving sexual violence
here.
The board, which began posting
its meeting minutes online this year,
has been in talks with the Sexual
Violence Advisory Board since May
2009 and could send a recommen
dation to President John Hennessy
by the end of the quarter, according
to board co-chair Ben Davidson, a
law student.
The board's minutes shed some
light on the historically private
group, which sets policy for the
Office of Judicial Affairs where,
among other things, students
respond to accusations of violating
the University's Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard. The office
oversaw 123 cases during the 2008-
2009 academic year.
Fundamental Standard viola
tions include sexual "misconduct,"
like assault or harassment. Judicial
Affairs oversaw one such case in fall
2008, the most recent quarter for
which statistics are publicly avail
able.
Davidson said that efforts to
change the way Judicial Affairs han
dles sexual violence cases began in
May, when representatives of
Stanford's Sexual Violence
Advisory Board came to the BJA to
make suggestions on how the cur
rent process, described in the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997,
"could be improved."
Carole Pertofsky, a staff member
at Vaden Health Center and co
chair of SVAB, affirmed that her
board became interested in changes
to the process last year, specifically
the burden of proof requirement
for sexual violence cases.
But Pertofsky wrote in an e-mail
to The Daily that "this year, due to

informal surveying, SVAB became
aware that a measure to change the
standard was not likely to succeed."
"Therefore, in partnership with
the ASSU and other groups, SVAB
chose to conduct in-depth campus
awareness and education cam
paigns about the issue and garner
future support from the Judicial
Affairs Board, Stanford's senior
leadership and, of course, the stu
dent body," Pertofsky added.
ASSU President David Gobaud,
a coterminal student in computer
science, asked his legislative team to

quietly research the burden of
proof issue last year, but later
dropped the project. Gobaud is now
pursuing an education campaign for
students with his health and well
ness team.
Changes to how sexual violence
cases are handled, then, rest in the
BJA's hands for now. Davidson said
the board discussed the "alternative
review process" again at its
December meeting and will focus
on the issue at today's meeting.
He said that if approved, the
process would become a one-year

pilot program.
Normally, changes outside the
provisions of the judicial charter
such as this one require approval
by the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate, the Graduate Student
Council and the University presi
dent.
Davidson called that "a valuable
but lengthy process," adding that
"many of the people involved
believe that this would be most
appropriate after we have collected
information from the pilot pro
gram."

So, he said, the board would like
ly use another section of the char
ter, IV.A, that would allow the
board to send a pilot program rec
ommendation straight to Hennessy.
At today's meeting, two versions
of the minutes from the board's
December meeting "abbreviat
ed" and "detailed," according to
Davidson are up for approval,
after which the abbreviated version
would be made available online.
