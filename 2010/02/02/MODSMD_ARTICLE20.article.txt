# SWIMMING TO A SWEEP
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford women's swimming and div
ing team continued its dominance of the Pac-10 Con
ference this past weekend, rolling past UCLA (5-3,
2-3 Pac-10) and No. 9 Southern California (10-3,3-3)
in Los Angeles. The Cardinal (8-0, 4-0) is now 4-0
against opponents ranked in the top 25 and 3-0
against top-10 teams. With the sweep, the team re
mains on track for a second consecutive undefeated
dual-meet season.

Stanford came in heavily favored against the Bru
ins whose five wins have come at the expense of
very weak programs and did not disappoint, run
ning away with a 169-126 victory. Out of 16 events,
the Cardinal took home 13 wins, posting numerous
"B" standard times. Senior co-captain Julia Smit,
who posted wins in the 100- and 200-yard freestyle
and the 200-yard breaststroke, led the way once
again for Stanford. She made a "B" standard time of
2:13.04 in the 200 breast, beating UCLA standout
Brittany Beauchan by a full 2.5 seconds.
There were several other excellent performances
from Cardinal swimmers. Freshman Andi Murez
scored a second-place finish in the 100 free and a vic
tory in the 50 free. The familiar duo of senior Elaine
Breeden and junior Kate Dwelley also made signifi
cant contributions.

Junior diver Meg Hostage also won both diving
events to power Stanford. On the 3-meter spring
board, Hostage beat out UCLA's Karina Silva by 10
points and on the 1-meter, Hostage and senior team
mate Carmen Stellar got first and second place.
The real test, however, came on Saturday, when
the Cardinal dueled USC. The matchup was highly
anticipated, due in part to the fact that USC had just
beaten No. 5 California, the defending Pac-10 and
NCAA team champion, by a score of 153-147.
At the start, the meet seemed like it would be a
close one, with the first four events evenly split be
tween the Cardinal and the Trojans. After USC's
Presley Bard won the 100-yard backstroke, Stanford
began to pull away, reeling off seven straight victo
ries and winning nine of the last 10 events overall.
Stanford ended the afternoon with a final score of
179-119.

The USC meet saw three swimmers shine for
Stanford Dwelley, Smit and junior Liz Smith.
Dwelley paced the Cardinal with three victories in
the 50,100 and 200 free. Smit continued to impress
by winning the 200 back and the 200-yard individual
medley, as well as driving numerous Cardinal relay
teams.

After a quiet meet against UCLA, Smith scored

very well against USC, winning the 100 and 200
breast and coming second behind Smit in the 200IM.
Easily the most anticipated matchup of the day
was Breeden's race in the 200-yard butterfly against
USC's Katinka Hosszu, who has swum in the
Olympics for Hungary. Breeden is the defending
NCAA champion in the event while Hosszu came
into the race with the fastest time in the nation for
this season. With a time of 1:56.70, Breeden came in
more than two full seconds ahead of Hosszu
(1:58.72).
"We knew ahead of time that both teams would
bring strong competition, especially when preparing
for USC after they beat Cal on Friday," Smith said.
"We knew that every member on the team would
have to step up their game and swim with lots of
heart, and I would say that we were very successful
in all of these areas."
While its swimming team was being pounded,
USC's divers were able to beat the Cardinal on both
boards. USC's Ariel Rittenhouse, an Olympian, won
both boards over Hostage and Stellar by significant
margins. However, this result was not very surprising
as USC is generally considered to have the best div
ing team in the conference.
The weekend's results have positioned Stanford
as the team to beat in the Pac-10. After the meet,
Smith commented on the Card's new position.
"I think that Stanford was, and is, one of the best
programs in both the Pac-10 and the country," she
said. "The next step for our team is to move from
'one of the best' to 'the best' and we are working our

Looking ahead, the Cardinal will
face off at home against Cal in its
final dual meet of the season on Feb.

postseason success. Last season,
Stanford defeated the Golden Bears
162-129 in Berkeley, but the Bears
went on to win the overall NCAA
championship while the Card fin

"We will bring the same approach
as we did this weekend: have fun,
race hard, stay positive and don't re
lent," Smith said. "Dual meets often
come down to touch-outs and small
differences in points, so we are gear
ing up for what should be a very ex

USC's Katinka Hosszu, who has swum in the
Olympics for Hungary. Breeden is the defending
NCAA champion in the event while Hosszu came
into the race with the fastest time in the nation for
this season. With a time of 1:56.70, Breeden came in
more than two full seconds ahead of Hosszu
(1:58.72).
"We knew ahead of time that both teams would
bring strong competition, especially when preparing
for USC after they beat Cal on Friday," Smith said.
"We knew that every member on the team would
have to step up their game and swim with lots of
heart, and I would say that we were very successful
in all of these areas."
While its swimming team was being pounded,
USC's divers were able to beat the Cardinal on both
boards. USC's Ariel Rittenhouse, an Olympian, won
both boards over Hostage and Stellar by significant
margins. However, this result was not very surprising
as USC is generally considered to have the best div
ing team in the conference.
The weekend's results have positioned Stanford
as the team to beat in the Pac-10. After the meet,
Smith commented on the Card's new position.
"I think that Stanford was, and is, one of the best
programs in both the Pac-10 and the country," she
said. "The next step for our team is to move from
'one of the best' to 'the best' and we are working our

The Cardinal continued its undefeated season last

and No. 9 USC. Senior co-captain Julia Smit, above,

breaststroke.
way toward that goal."
Looking ahead, the Cardinal will
face off at home against Cal in its
final dual meet of the season on Feb.
13. While notching its second consec
utive undefeated season would cer
tainly be an impressive feat, a win
over Cal would be no guarantee of
postseason success. Last season,
Stanford defeated the Golden Bears
162-129 in Berkeley, but the Bears
went on to win the overall NCAA
championship while the Card fin
ished fourth at that meet.
"We will bring the same approach
as we did this weekend: have fun,
race hard, stay positive and don't re
lent," Smith said. "Dual meets often
come down to touch-outs and small
differences in points, so we are gear
ing up for what should be a very ex
citing meet."
