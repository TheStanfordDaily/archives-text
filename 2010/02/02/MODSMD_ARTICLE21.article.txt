# SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING
## Stanford takes opening competition 
### ELLEN CERF 
This weekend the No. 2 Stanford synchronized
swimming team headed to St. Peters, Missouri to
compete in its first event of the season at Linden
wood University. The team finished first overall,
besting host Lindenwood, the University of the In
carnate Word (UIW) and the University of Michi
gan Synchronized Swimming Club.
Synchronized swimming, commonly nicknamed
"synchro," consists of four main events: solo, duet,
trio and team, with individual skills called "ele
ments" and "figures" factored into the overall score.
This weekend Stanford captured first-place finishes
in three of the four main categories, with freshman
Jessica Guenther winning the solo competition and
sophomores Olivia Morgan and Maria Koroleva
taking first in the duet. With help from senior Taylor
Durand, they also took first in the trio. Additionally,
sophomore Alex Bollaidlaw claimed the top spot in

the elements competition, rounding out a solid first
showing for Stanford.
No. 4 UIW proved to be the greatest competitor
for the Card, taking second overall and first in the
team competition.
"This past weekend was our team's first opportu
nity to compete all together," Durand said. "I can't
say it went exactly as we'd hoped, but it was an im
portant experience in learning what we need to do
in order to achieve our goals in six weeks at Colle
giate Nationals. Overall, we are feeling positive and
re-motivated to strive for excellence and we're ex
cited to compete in front of our friends and families
at home next weekend."
This season brings new challenges for Stanford
and its "Romeo and Juliet" themed team routine, as
three of Stanford's top swimmers are seeking places
on the national team and are thus unable to partici-
pate in the team competition at
NCAA Nationals.
Stanford synchronized swim
ming will continue its competition
season on Feb. 13-14, hosting the
University of Arizona. Eventually,
the team will also host the NCAA
Nationals from Mar. 11-13. Stanford
came in second against Ohio State
at last year's NCAA Finals after
winning four consecutive national
titles.
