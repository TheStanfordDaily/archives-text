## Farm-Pakistan 'innovation' receives award 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Given the changing nature of
today's journalism industry, the words
"innovation journalism" seem to sug
gest transformations in the field of
journalism itself
But a collaborative effort between
Stanford and a Pakistani television net
work has proven that it is just as impor
tant to study "innovation journalism"
in and of itself â€”that is, journalism
focusing on innovations in technology,
science, business and even politics.
Now, the result of the partnership
between the VINNOVA-Stanford
Research Center of Innovation
Journalism (InJo) and Pakistan-based
SAMAA TV is the "Innovation" televi
sion series, which came to fruition
through collaborative efforts between
David Nordfors, InJo's founding execu
tive director, and Amir Jahangir,
SAMAA TV's CEO.
Jahangir became involved with the
InJo Center in 2006 and currently sits
on one of its advisory boards. He began
to serve as SAMAA TV's CEO in
2008 and soon after decided to run a
program on innovation journalism in
collaboration with Stanford. The pro
gram was broadcast in Pakistan and
recently received the 2009 "Brand of
the Year" Award for highlighting inno
vation in modern Pakistani society.
The award, given by the Pakistani
government and other agencies, meas
ured consumer votes and an expert

panel vote for more than 500 innova
tion brands. "Innovation" was the first
media product to win this honor.
SAMAA TV and InJo will accept the
award from Pakistani Prime Minister
Yousaf Raza Gilani in February.
The television series was lauded for
informing its audience about new
innovations such as mobile banking. It
also featured innovation journalism
itself, examining how the coverage of
new innovations can affect a country's
socio-economic development.
Nordfors believes the collabora
tion's success is an indicator of a
healthy future for innovation journal

ism. Once a quantum molecular physi
cist in Sweden, Nordfors changed his
career path and decided to concentrate
on innovation coverage in media and
how it can shape a changing society.
"In the early nineties, some journal
ists didn't know the difference
between e-mail and the Internet," he
said. "But if they could understand it,
they could pass it on to others. I
became more interested in how knowl
edge affects society than in the new
knowledge itself"
Nordfors said coined the term
"innovation journalism" in 2003 when
it was "an unused expression with zero

Google hits."
"Journalism about innovation is not
new, but it has not been considered a
genre until now. Without a name it is
not possible to discuss best practice,"
Nordfors wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily.
He noted that "innovation" was
strictly considered to be a "tech" or

business term in the past; people did
not examine the concept of innovation
in other areas of society. However, that
custom has changed in recent years.
Currently, the InJo Center has ini
tiatives in Sweden, Finland, Slovenia,
Mexico, Pakistan, the European Union
and Israel, and the center is constantly
looking to expand.

"This is relatively new," said
Nordfors of the success in Pakistan.
"[SAMAATV] embraced the concept
of innovation journalism and made it
happen, and they made it happen in
Pakistan."
