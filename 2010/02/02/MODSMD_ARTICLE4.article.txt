# Univ. changes rental rules
## ASB must buy primary insurance ahead of spring trips 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR 
Stanford has temporarily ceased to be the
primary insurer of rental cars used by student
groups, dealing new financial worries to the
Alternative Spring Break (ASB) program,
which relies heavily on rental vehicles for its
trips.
Though the University still provides sec
ondary coverage on vehicles, it now requests
that renting parties purchase primary insur
ance from car rental companies as the
University reviews its policies.
"The University has yet to reach a final
policy," said Elaine Ray, director of campus
communications, speaking on behalf of the
Office of Risk Management.
According to Ray, the Office of Risk
Management and the ASSU are performing a
cost-benefit analysis and examining other uni
versities' policies on car rental insurance. The
Risk Management Office said it will institute

a definite policy in the future,
Ray said Stanford still
plans to help student groups that
rent cars, adding that the first $1
million of any insurance claim
will be covered by University general funds.

Nevertheless, ASB financial officer Minh
Dan Vuong 'll estimates that the
University's decision to remove primary cov
erage will cost his program an additional
$3,000 to $5,000 when the group buys insur
ance from Enterprise Rent-A-Car in the
spring.
Vuong said ASB was informed of the
change two weeks ago but not before sub
mitting special fees requests for this year's
activities last February. ASB requested
$58,900 in special fees last year, almost
$ll,OOO of which was budgeted to car rentals.
"We'll be fine this year," Vuong said,
explaining that ASB has a reserve fund that
covers the cost difference. "But if this policy
stays in place for the future, is it really cheap
er for student groups?"
Jon McConnell, a student affairs officer at
the Haas Center and the ASB faculty advis
er, noted that the expense of purchasing
rental insurance could go up each year, given
increases in the cost of coverage and number

of trips. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that
University administrators have a difficult
task on their hands.
"This isn't the type of thing you want to
hear when you're working on your budget, but
I understand the situation Risk Management
is in," McConnell said. "My hope is that the
final policy is cost-effective and that we're not
spending more University funds than we were
in the first place,"
But for now, further compounding finan
cial worries for ASB is a new rule approved by
the ASSU legislature last month that permits
student groups to ask only for an inflationary
adjustment in their budget in the spring elec
tion. Previously, groups' budgets were allowed
to request an up to 10 percent increase each
year ahead of the student body vote. Vuong
started a petition personally, not on behalf
of ASB, he said last month to oppose the
rule; the petition has garnered some 370 signa
tures.
Vuong estimates that it will cost $34 to
cover each vehicle per day on the Enterprise
insurance plan. With two vehicles per trip and
approximately 10 trips utilizing rentals, the
total cost will be "way beyond inflation,"
Vuong said.
This added financial burden appears

unavoidable given the structure of ASB.
"The cars are crucial," Vuong explained.
"Our trips go to different cities around the
U.S. There's one trip traveling down the
Colorado River Valley. Several trips go to
southern California. If it's possible to use pub
lic transportation, such as for our
[Washington] D.C. ones, we do that."
One ASB trip that expects to rack up sig
nificant rental miles is called "Medicine at the
Margins," which examines the healthcare of
underserved communities in California's
Central Valley. The trip includes stops at agri
cultural communities such as Salinas and
Firebaugh. Co-leader Sarah Hennessy 'l2 esti
mates that her week-long ASB trip will
require 15 hours of driving.
"If we didn't have cars, the trip wouldn't
exist," Hennessy said. "Public transportation
doesn't exist in many of these areas, which
speaks to the rural, isolated nature of these
migrant communities. There are different
pockets throughout the Central Valley, and
our students need to see all of them so they
can really understand discrepancies in
migrant health."
