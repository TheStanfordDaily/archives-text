two weeks, Parker bakes and packages 20,000
cookies.

You've posed with the Rodin statues

have your likeness etched onto the

might be fun to try juggling in front

Stanford: eat President Hennessy. That's
right not just eating with the presi- ,
dent, but literally eating him. I
Turns out, President Hennessy |

that.

In October, Nate Grossman 'lO jumped on
board. Grossman, who is interested in pur
suing intersecting fields of business, psy
chology and marketing after Stanford,
said that he e-mailed Parker after see
ing his start-up listed on the Cardinal
Careers Web site. Upon receiving a
"really funny e-mail" back,
Grossman became Parker's first
sales associate and employee.
"It seemed like a cool way

to get a product
and develop my
own marketing
strategies," Grossman
said. "It's a really small start-up
that's what drew me to it, too."

According to Grossman, Parker obtained
licensing rights by making samples of Stanford
icons and submitting them to the Collegiate
Licensing Company.
Now, Grossman's primary role is to push
the Stanford collection, which started test sell
ing at Stanford the first week of winter quar
ter at Tresidder, the Alumni Cafe and the
bookstore. Although Grossman said that they
sold out at the Alumni Cafe on the first day, it
hasn't been easy everywhere. Tresidder
General Manager Jeannette Hayden wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily that "the Crazy



Cookies are not selling well in Tresidder."
"I think the problem is that when people go to Feet's
or are getting lunch, they don't want a somewhat expen
sive bag of cookies to go with their coffee or meal,"
Grossman said, noting that it is very difficult to get "peo
ple to listen to you, like, seriously listen to you, when
you're talking about cookies."
Nonetheless, Grossman remains unfazed and is con
tinuing to develop new marketing strategies to be dis
closed in the future.
"The best solution is to get the cookies in their hands
people really do love them," he said. "Plus, it's awe
some to see their faces when they see President Hennessy
as a little cookie."
After all, he at least tastes good.
Lan Rowbotham 'll, who tried the cookies for the first

time in early January, said that he was "hooked" and
described the taste as "somewhere between shortbread
and the animal cookies of my childhood."
"I think the Stanford set is a staple for campus not
only because of their flavor," he said. "I plan on consis
tently munching on these, but they also match the humor
ous outlook Stanford has of itself, such as the drawings in
the CoHo."
Hennessy agreed, commenting that "the total experi
ence had cerebral elements that are hard to capture with
simple words like 'good.'"
"Cerebral elements?" See
for yourself. Bon appetit!
