## Tesla fuels new Palo Alto jobs Department of Energy loan drives construction of new plant 
### CRISTIANA GIANNINI 
Tesla Motors, maker of the electric
Roadster two-door sports car, has received
$465 million in U.S. Department of Energy
loans part of which will be used to build a
new facility in Palo Alto.
The Department of Energy estimates
that, together with another plant planned for
southern California, the loan will create
1,600 jobs in the company's plants over the
next few years. The deal was finalized Jan.
21.
Palo Alto Mayor Pat Burt expressed
optimism about this development and antic
ipated that the company will find a favor
able environment in Palo Alto.
"We have all the great research that is
being done at Stanford in a myriad of eco
friendly fields," Burt said. "We have the sup
port system."
Burt stated that the city's clean tech
"ecosystem" is "one of the greatest opportu
nities for Silicon Valley possibly the
greatest."
Perhaps indicative of that "ecosystem,"
Tesla's new facility will be located just down
the street from the headquarters of A Better
Place, a company that has met international
success in creating electric vehicle infra
structure support.
News reports have indicated that Tesla's
southern California site will focus on the
forthcoming Model S electric sedan, while
its Palo Alto plant will manufacture vehicle
equipment for the existing Roadster model's
power train and other vehicle manufactur
ing companies.
The Tesla Roadster, which currently
retails at $109,000, is advertised as twice as
efficient as the Toyota Prius, with a battery
that can take the car over 200 miles between
charges and achieve a zero to 60 mph time
of 3.7 seconds. As of December, Tesla had
sold just under 1,000 Roadsters.
Last week, an announcement released
with Tesla's initial public offering IPO stated
that the company intends to end production
of the Roadster in 2011. The Model S will
become available in 2012, assuming that
production goes as planned.
