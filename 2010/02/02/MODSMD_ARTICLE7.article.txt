## Tesla fuels new Palo Alto jobs Department of Energy loan drives construction of new plant 
### CRISTIANA GIANNINI 
Tesla Motors, maker of the electric
Roadster two-door sports car, has received
$465 million in U.S. Department of Energy
loans part of which will be used to build a
new facility in Palo Alto.
The Department of Energy estimates
that, together with another plant planned for
southern California, the loan will create
1,600 jobs in the company's plants over the
next few years. The deal was finalized Jan.
21.
Palo Alto Mayor Pat Burt expressed
optimism about this development and antic
ipated that the company will find a favor
able environment in Palo Alto.
"We have all the great research that is
being done at Stanford in a myriad of eco
friendly fields," Burt said. "We have the sup
port system."
Burt stated that the city's clean tech
"ecosystem" is "one of the greatest opportu
nities for Silicon Valley possibly the
greatest."
Perhaps indicative of that "ecosystem,"
Tesla's new facility will be located just down
the street from the headquarters of A Better
Place, a company that has met international
success in creating electric vehicle infra
structure support.
News reports have indicated that Tesla's
southern California site will focus on the
forthcoming Model S electric sedan, while
its Palo Alto plant will manufacture vehicle
equipment for the existing Roadster model's
power train and other vehicle manufactur
ing companies.
The Tesla Roadster, which currently
retails at $109,000, is advertised as twice as
efficient as the Toyota Prius, with a battery
that can take the car over 200 miles between
charges and achieve a zero to 60 mph time
of 3.7 seconds. As of December, Tesla had
sold just under 1,000 Roadsters.
Last week, an announcement released
with Tesla's initial public offering IPO stated
that the company intends to end production
of the Roadster in 2011. The Model S will
become available in 2012, assuming that
production goes as planned.
The company's plans for the Palo
Alto plant once Roadster produc
tion ends remain unclear. Tesla
spokespeople did not immediately
return a request for comment.
The new Model S will be a four
door vehicle with a predicted retail
price of $49,900 after federal tax
credits. It is designed to travel
approximately 300 miles on a three
to five-hour battery charge.
The young company's entry into
Wall Street may signal a break
through for the clean tech industry,
though Tesla has not been profitable
thus far; the company has lost $236.4
million since its 2003 founding.
Ending production of the Roadster
also means a shrunken revenue flow
until the Model S hits the market.
But Tesla's move to Palo Alto
could point to new opportunities
and closer ties between the company
and Stanford.
In fact, the University's connec
tion with Tesla has its roots in the
Stanford Solar Car Project: several
years ago, the group secured support
from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Sasha Zbrozek TO, who formerly
headed the Stanford Solar Car
Project, worked for Tesla in the past
as a mechanical engineering intern.
He predicts that the company will
increase efforts to reach out to stu
dents.
"They largely picked the location
for its proximity to all these Stanford
people," Zbrozek said.
He further added that the

Stanford solar car served as a tem
plate for an early version of Tesla's
battery technologies. Given these
recent developments, Zbrozek
believes that Silicon Valley has the
potential to succeed in the clean tech
industry, though he also sees China
as a strong competitor.

Zbrozek said that he enjoys
working in the industry because of
its innovative freedom and he feels
"that the work is beneficial on the
larger scale."
