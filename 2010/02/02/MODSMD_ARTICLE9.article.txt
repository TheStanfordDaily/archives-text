Arrillaga is a place for the adventur
ous. The fiberglass rock-climbing wall
was added to the Arrillaga Center for
Sports and Recreation about three year
ago after a student group took an interest in
rock climbing. Since then, the student-run
climbing wall has become a unique fixture of the
student experience.

"I had never done it before and it's free," said
Abraham Cabangbang 'lO. "So 1 figured out 1 might as well
do it. It's turning out to be a lot of fun."
According to Andy Fields, director of outdoor education,
the climbing wall receives an average of about 1,000 partici
pants per quarter, but actual participation is probably high
er.
Jon Denby 'll was introduced to rock climbing during his
freshman year at NSO and "fell in love with it."
"I basically started climbing a lot for the next year and
got really into it," Denby said.
Now a staffer at the wall, Denby explained that he was
originally an intense swimmer in high school and was look
ing for a new sport rock climbing was it.
"I've always loved climbing trees back home in New
Jersey," Denby said. "My friends were just like, let's go to the
climbing wall. And I said ok."
Robert Schiemann 'll, a rock-wall staffer, said that other
students had similar reactions to Denby, and that the climb
ing wall is seeing a spike in people trying climbing during
winter quarter.
"It can get busy and crazy here," Schiemann said. "There
can be rushes of about 60 people. There is a small group of
20 to 40 people who come in at least three or four times a
week." The capacity of the room is only about 50 to 60 peo
ple.
"I had someone from the manufacturer come down to
inspect our wall recently," Fields said. "And he was amazed
at how much we use our wall. At some point in the next few
years, we are going to wear it out."
"With the amount of interest there is on campus, we
could easily use a climbing wall seven times our size," Fields
added. "The Stanford community would love it."
Students say they've become hooked on climbing
because it not only provides a total-body workout but also a
test of endurance.
"It's pretty fun," said Rafael Olympia 'lO. "It's challeng
ing, but you have to really think about what to grip on and
what to step on."
Jake Zeller 'l3 was surprised that rock-climbing took so
much effort and energy.
"It's very humbling because you see a small little wall and
it's a challenge to get three feet up," he said.
Climbers must break down every step in front of them to
confront the wall as a whole. Fields said that this translates
to a real life skill, where you are handed a big problem, but

have
to hack at it
piece by piece.
"If you start
somewhere real
basic," Fields said, "the
step right in front of you,
it makes the goal a lot more
doable and attainable."
"There is goal setting and over
coming fears and problem solving," he added. "No mat
ter what level you are as a climber, there is always a barrier
to overcome. It definitely promotes strength and
endurance."
At the climbing wall, students have the option of either
bouldering or top-roping. Bouldering means that climbers
scale a 12-foot wall without rope while top-roping requires
climbers to be secured by ropes by a partner who will belay
them from the ground.
According to Fields, anyone who has access to Arrillaga
has access to free belay lessons, shoes and harnesses, versus
the $l5 to $2O daily passes at outside commercial gyms.
"I teach beginner climbing classes," Denby said. "People
usually get a lot more confident by the end of the class even
though they are innately afraid of heights. I was too, but now
I can be 500 feet off the ground and not care at all. It's a good
way to get over their fear of heights."
In general, climbing at Stanford costs much less than
climbing in other places. Lessons range from $5O to $75 dol
lars for eight weeks, depending on the length of the lesson.
"We want them to learn the skills so that if they like rock
climbing they can pursue it and do it in their lives," Fields
said. "Our goal is to provide as much as we can to the com
munity."
For many students, the climbing wall is a good workout
in and of itself, but other more serious climbers use
Arrillaga's climbing wall as practice for the real rock climb
ing experience outdoors.
"Problem solving, endurance and strength are the same,"
Fields said of outdoor climbing. "However, outside there is
exposure since you're not following a taped route. When it
comes down to it though, climbing is climbing."
Rock climbing aficionados often take trips to nearby out
door venues such as Yosemite, Lake Tahoe's Lover's Leap
and Castle Rock State Park.

"You're
in a beautiful
setting when
you're hanging off a
cliff," Denby said. "You
kinda get experience in
most of your senses when
you're climbing. You get the
feel of your hands on the rock.
You get the sounds of the wind
rushing at the cliff It's just you,
the sound of the wind, and the trees
below you."
"It's just rock, but it's more than
rock," Fields said.
