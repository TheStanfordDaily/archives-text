Stanford Continuing Studies Program and Stanford Historical Society Present
Stanford Pioneers in Science
Please join us this Winter as we continue the Stanford Pioneers in Science series.
These events offer the public an opportunity to learn about the scientific
contributions and lives of Stanford faculty members who have been awarded
Nobel Prizes, National Medals of Science or Technology, and Mac Arthur Fellowships.
Douglas Osheroff
Nobel Prize Winner in Physics
Douglas Osheroff began tinkering with the world of physics as a boy in the basement of his home
in Aberdeen, Washington. At six, he disassembled his toys to get at their electric motors, later he
blew a hole in two walls with a muzzle-loading rifle he built, and nearly blinded himself when a
makeshift miner's lamp exploded. But by the time he was a senior in high school, he had
constructed a 110 keV Xray machine, and everybody knew there was no stopping him. Osheroff
went to CalTech as an undergraduate (where he enrolled in Richard Feynman's legendary two-year
course on physics) and to Cornell as a graduate student, where in 1971 he and his colleagues
discovered the superfluidity in hclium-3. It was for this breakthrough that Osheroff shared the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1996.
Doug Osheroff's work will be introduced by his distinguished colleague, Alexander Fetter,
Professor of Physics, Emeritus, and former Director of both the Hansen Experimental Physics
Laboratory and the Geballc Laboratory for Advanced Materials.
