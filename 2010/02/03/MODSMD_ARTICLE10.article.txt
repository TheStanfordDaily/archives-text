## Stanford supports Google Book Search settlement agreement 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Christine McFadden 
Stanford has recently expanded its part in the Google
Book Search settlement agreement currently in federal
court which expands the Google Book project's scan
ning of millions of books to be made available to the public
online.

Provost John Etchemendy and University Librarian
Michael Keller expressed support for the project, which has
scanned more than 1.7 million Stanford-owned books in the
past five years, according to The Stanford Report.
The settlement additionally compensates authors for
putting their work online, allowing many authors whose
works are out of print to benefit from the settlement.
In the terms of the amended settlement agreement,
Stanford's endorsement of the settlement makes it a Fully
Participating Library. More than two dozen other major
libraries in the world are currently involved in the project.
