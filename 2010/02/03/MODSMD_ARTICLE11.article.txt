# ASSU execs look for Haiti 'czar'
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Daniel Khalessi 
In the wake of the disastrous Jan. 12 Haiti earthquake,
ASSU executives on campus are continuing their search to
fill a newly-created paid position: "Haiti relief czar."
The job, which would involve managing both on-campus
and off-campus relief efforts, has so far had four student
applicants. Currently scheduling interviews, the executives
said they will likely appoint a student by next week.
The "czar" would receive a $5OO stipend for 10 to 15

hours of work per week. Though the stipend will come out
of Gobaud's salary, some ASSU leaders last week ques
tioned the decision to pay the czar.

"The idea that we're paying someone to do a charity
position just doesn't go well with me," said Adam Beber, a
doctoral computer science student and member of the
Graduate Student Council, at last week's meeting. Other
members supported the creation of the job.
ASSU President David Gobaud, a coterminal computer
science student, has continued to push the job as a paid role.
"We believe that offering this stipend for what will be a
full-time cabinet position is both fair and in keeping with
our policy for other cabinet members [who are all paid],"
wrote Gobaud in an e-mail to The Daily. He also pointed
out that executives have created paid "czar" roles in the
past.
Gobaud said that whoever fills the position will focus
first and foremost on campus relief efforts.
"On campus, the HRC will work with individuals, dorms,
[volunteer student organizations] and other organizations
on events relating to Haiti relief," Gobaud said. "This
includes facilitating and collaboration among people with
similar project ideas, planning and organizing events, coor
dinating with the ASSU, [and] acting as a liaison between
students and administration."
"The HRC will be able to use his/her experience with
on-campus events to advise the group on the most success
ful strategies to raise money and awareness while working
to get more students and colleges involved throughout the
country," Gobaud added.
As to the rationale for making the position a long-term
job, Gobaud offered that "the thing to remember is there's
a lot more to rebuilding Haiti than money it'll take
years."
He said he will recommend that next year's executives
retain the czar job.
"At least through the end of our term we would hope
through at least the end of the year. We will recommend
that they [the next administration] keep this person on their
staff"
