## EDITORIAL Reform ASSU special fees refund process 
### 
As special fees legislation hits the
headlines, the special fees refund
process -begins to rear its ugly head.
Each quarter, students are allowed to apply
for a refund from programs that they do not
agree with, do not receive a benefit from or
think are ineffective. This is what the refund
program was created to do. Like many good
ideas, however, the refund process has been
corrupted by those taking advantage of the
system. The majority of those who request
special fees refunds appear to do so simply to
get the money.
Refund rates for special fees groups range
from 9.6 percent to 18.5 percent, the average
being around 16 percent. This amounts to a
total of $115,794 for the winter quarter, up
from last quarter's total of $79,604.This quar
ter's total of 1,132 refund requests marks the
highest number of students asking for re
funds in the last three years. The number of
students asking for full refunds also hit a
three-year high with 379 requests. With over
a third of refund-recipients refusing to sup
port any special fees group, it appears that
many students simply do not feel the need to
contribute to campus organizations, and
would rather just keep the money for them
selves.

A gaping hole in the process, however, is
that it is often difficult to prevent students
who have taken refunds from utilizing the
same services they declined to support.
Groups have the option of denying service to
those students who requested refunds, but
when only a list of SUID's of those asking for
refunds is published, there is no way for
groups to know the names of students who
received a refund from their budgets. With
out real repercussions, abuse of the refund

process is sure to continue. It is highly im
probable that any student disagrees with
every special fees group on campus, and
never derives benefits from any such group.
The Editorial Board urges the ASSU to
consider and explore other options to the
current special fees refund process. One sim
ple way to curb the refund amount is to cut
the window for refund application down
from three weeks to one week. Also, the re
fund could be made to the party paying the
University Bill, bypassing the student's hand
directly and removing the motive of quick
easy cash in order to make the student con
sider the choices made in asking for specific
group refunds. The best option would most
likely be to make the refund payment fit a
graduated scale. In this scenario, students
would have to rank the special fees groups by
refund request. The first choice receiving a
100 percent refund, the second 80 percent
and so on.

Whatever changes are made to the refund
process, the greatest need is in making sure
that there are repercussions for taking a re
fund. In the current system, the student
stands to gain without the risk of loss. The
special fees groups, on the other hand, re
main the perpetual loser. Let us not, as Stan
ford students, forget the value of these organ
izations to our campus, our community and
our diversity.
Stanford is a community, a marketplace of
ideas and services. The idea that students and
groups work together to promote campus di
versity benefits every student in equal yet
different ways. Unless the refund process is
reformed, it will remain the source of easy
cash for the cynical and thoughtless. And the
campus as a whole will pay the real price.
