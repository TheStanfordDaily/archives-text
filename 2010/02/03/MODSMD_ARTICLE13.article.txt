## The 						truth about Y2E2 
### HEATHER BENZ '10 
Let's get one thing straight: the Yang and
Yamazaki Environment and Energy
(Y2E2) building is doing fine. The re
sults from its first year are in, and Y2E2
building uses 42% less energy than similar
buildings built to code, just as planned. Ru
mors that Y2E2 is performing poorly are
making their way across campus, and some
are even claiming that it uses more resources
than a conventional building of the same size.
These rumors were fueled by a Stanford
Review article by Alex Katz that miscon
strues and obscures the facts about Y2E2.
His argument relies exclusively on a recent
report published by Stanford's Center for In
tegrated Facility Engineering (CIFE). Writ
ten by a group of graduate students who
admit to having no previous knowledge
about building modeling, the report is based
on data from faulty sub-meters in Y2E2 and
was never peer-reviewed by the building's
design team or Stanford's Sustainability &
Energy Management Department.
While researching the article, entitled
"Y2E2 Fails to Meet Efficiency Expecta
tions," Katz was informed by staff in the De
partment of Sustainability and Energy Man
agement that, based on measured consump

tion history, Y2E2 was performing just as ex
pected. It is unclear exactly whose efficiency
expectations Katz thinks failed, as they are
certainly not the efficiency expectations of
the university, contractor, or energy modeler,
who all expected the building to use 40% less
energy than a conventional building of the
same size, which it has.

Katz claims that Y2E2 is using 65% more
energy than its "original" specifications,
where "original" refers to very early models
created to estimate building cost effective
ness. Created before construction, those
models were not used to predict actual build
ing consumption. The model Y2E2 perform
ance is actually compared against by the uni
versity is called the "as built" model, which
includes Coupa Caf?, a longer occupancy
schedule, an extensive data center, and a bet
ter understanding of research equipments
and plugloads. Comparing the building's cur
rent energy performance to this early model
would be like comparing your home's actual
energy use to a model of your home with no
appliances or electronics in it - a model can't
be expected to predict your home's energy
use if it doesn't accurately account
for what's in your home. Based on an
accurate "as built" model of Y2E2
energy use, the building is perform
ing just as expected, far better than
buildings of similar size.
Following his flawed critique of
this green building on campus, Katz
launches an equally flawed attack on
the green building industry, giving
examples of buildings across the
world that have not performed as ex

pected. While the industry is still in
its infancy, there is no exclusive link
between energy efficient buildings
and "exceedence" models. Variation
in building performance is common
across all building types. If Stanford
is not a place for testing innovate
new technologies, where is? For each
example of a building that Katz gives
of a building that did not perform
quite as expected, there are many ex
amples of those that did, or even per
formed above expectations. Our
own Carnegie Global Ecology Cen
ter, the Sun Field Station at Jasper
Ridge, and yes, even Y2E2, are shin
ing examples of those that have suc
ceeded.

Stanford will continue to make
our campus more sustainable with
green new construction practices
and by optimizing energy perform
ance in existing buildings. Flawed at
tempts to find fault in doing good for
the environment -and our budget
will not stop us. The new GSB cam
pus will be certified LEED Plat
inum, joining the ranks of those
buildings that have been deemed the
greenest in the country. Katz and the
Review can try to find fault in that.
Meanwhile, we'll being saving the
planet.
