## The 						Transfer Student from Cal: Which School is Better? 
### Farbod Faraji 
I made the biggest switch that can be made.
From East bay to South bay. Public to Pri
vate. Blue and gold to Cardinal red. I
transferred from Cal to Stanford after my
sophomore year in college. While the memo
ries of both institutions are still fresh in my
mind, I have decided to have four rounds, one
point each, to decide which school is truly
better.

The Rivalry: Cal embraces this rivalry,
proliferates it, and engrains it from the mo
ment you step on campus and begin student
orientation. It helps build a sense of Berke
ley nationalism, gets that fire in your stom
ach going, and makes you proud to be a
Golden Bear. But this all comes at the ex
pense of an ?out-group? called Stanford Jr.
University.
Stanford is much lower key about the ri
valry. While it is mentioned at orientation, it
is not the cornerstone of your Stanford pride.
Sure we get the buildup during big game
week and the hype that accompanies a sto
ried rivalry between two of the best universi
ties, but we don?t have that year-round spew
ing of vitriol when we see the colors of an op-

posing university?s sweatshirts. For us here at
Stanford, life exists outside of the rivalry.
Dignity and point to Stanford.
Life outside campus: Stanford resides
near the city of Palo Alto. I say near because
it has basically built a 360 degree buffer zone
separating our campus from the rest of civi
lization. And unless your idea of fun is brows
ing around downtown Palo Alto looking for
an oversized Persian carpet for your dorm
room or dropping $2O a plate for lunch, the
surrounding city has nothing to offer a col
lege student. Don?t get me wrong, I would
LOVE to be able to afford those things (did
I mention I?m Persian and we average more
carpets than people in our houses?), but that
type of ballerific behavior lays on the horizon
for a guy like me.
In contrast, Cal offers a campus that feeds
right into the city. As a Berkeley student your
bus pass can take you from the heart of the
campus into Oakland and San Francisco
without a penny lost, and there?s the BART
(think Caltrain, but better in every way). The
campus is surrounded by an array of
ethnically diverse restaurants for
around $7 a plate, able to satisfy
even the most demanding of taste
buds. On the negative side, homeless
characters and weirdoes on the
streets of Berkeley are as copious as
rich 40-somethings are on the streets
of Palo Alto. Ladies that get
?hollered? by bums and hoodlums
in the middle of the night will attest
to how uncomfortable it can be.
However, at the end of the day com
mon sense practically ensures safety.
The vibrancy of Berkeley makes
me smile as I think of it. Cal gets
the point. EASILY
Academics: UC Berkeley is
ranked third according to the most
prominent world rankings. Stan
ford is ranked second. Both boast
highly accomplished faculty, of the
best in their field, who are world
class professors. The only differ
ence is that at Stanford, there are
about 20,000 fewer students com
peting for these professors' time.
Imagine trying to get that intern
ship or research job if there were

nearly three times as many appli
cants. Reasonable class sizes and
the ability to build a more personal
relationship with professors, as
well as fellow classmates, make
learning at Stanford that much
more enjoyable. Plus, Stanford has
Condoleezza Rice. I got into her
class. Point Stanford.

The Intangible: Berkeley kids
(including myself when I was
there) always accuse Stanford stu
dents as being bourgeois and enti
tled. After one quarter at Stanford
I know that the allegation is com
pletely false. But something else is
true. There is subtle lavishness
about life at Stanford: it?s the abil
ity to focus solely on our studies
that can be perceived as a luxury.
To be honest, it is the way learning
should be.

But Berkeley doesn?t have this
luxury. A student there engages with
the cold world: fruitless searches to
find a place to live, dealing with a
landlord, paying bills and buying
groceries, the threat of crime, losing
your way in a school with too many
students and not enough guidance,
and severe school budget cuts, all on
top of the stress of being a full time
student. This truth is best manifested
by the exorbitant increase in tuition
costs and the subsequent protests

and police clashes that occurred on
campus last semester at Cal. Such a
thing would never occur at Stanford
and I think all of us are glad it
doesn?t. But such events serve as a
reminder of what lays beyond our
four years of undergraduate learn
ing. The real world is a hard place.
Conditions for your success will
never be ideal. If you want some
thing, having the skills may not be
enough; you will need to be able to
manage the many moving aspects of
your existence. These experiences,
this adversity, though they can com
plicate the learning process, enrich
the lives of UC Berkeley students.
The struggle is beautiful and for
these reasons Berkeley gets the
point in this round.
The score is tied!

It is too simplistic and frankly
ridiculous for me or anyone else to
attempt to classify one as ?superior
to the other.? At the end of the day
they are both amazing schools that
anyone should be honored to at
tend; if someone disagrees, know
that it is ignorance that blinds their
judgment. While my decision to
transfer may be the most telling
sign, declaring a winner just feels
wrong. That in turn will make me
the most divided Stanford student
that ever attended the University.

well as fellow classmates, make
learning at Stanford that much
more enjoyable. Plus, Stanford has
Condoleezza Rice. I got into her
class. Point Stanford.

The Intangible: Berkeley kids
(including myself when I was
there) always accuse Stanford stu
dents as being bourgeois and enti
tled. After one quarter at Stanford
I know that the allegation is com
pletely false. But something else is
true. There is subtle lavishness
about life at Stanford: it?s the abil
ity to focus solely on our studies
that can be perceived as a luxury.
To be honest, it is the way learning
should be.

But Berkeley doesn?t have this
luxury. A student there engages with
the cold world: fruitless searches to
find a place to live, dealing with a
landlord, paying bills and buying
groceries, the threat of crime, losing
your way in a school with too many
students and not enough guidance,
and severe school budget cuts, all on
top of the stress of being a full time
student. This truth is best manifested
by the exorbitant increase in tuition
costs and the subsequent protests

and police clashes that occurred on
campus last semester at Cal. Such a
thing would never occur at Stanford
and I think all of us are glad it
doesn?t. But such events serve as a
reminder of what lays beyond our
four years of undergraduate learn
ing. The real world is a hard place.
Conditions for your success will
never be ideal. If you want some
thing, having the skills may not be
enough; you will need to be able to
manage the many moving aspects of
your existence. These experiences,
this adversity, though they can com
plicate the learning process, enrich
the lives of UC Berkeley students.
The struggle is beautiful and for
these reasons Berkeley gets the
point in this round.
The score is tied!

It is too simplistic and frankly
ridiculous for me or anyone else to
attempt to classify one as ?superior
to the other.? At the end of the day
they are both amazing schools that
anyone should be honored to at
tend; if someone disagrees, know
that it is ignorance that blinds their
judgment. While my decision to
transfer may be the most telling
sign, declaring a winner just feels
wrong. That in turn will make me
the most divided Stanford student
that ever attended the University.
