## The
						Transfer Student from Cal: Which School is Better? 
### Farbod Faraji 
I made the biggest switch that can be made.
From East bay to South bay. Public to Pri
vate. Blue and gold to Cardinal red. I
transferred from Cal to Stanford after my
sophomore year in college. While the memo
ries of both institutions are still fresh in my
mind, I have decided to have four rounds, one
point each, to decide which school is truly
better.

The Rivalry: Cal embraces this rivalry,
proliferates it, and engrains it from the mo
ment you step on campus and begin student
orientation. It helps build a sense of Berke
ley nationalism, gets that fire in your stom
ach going, and makes you proud to be a
Golden Bear. But this all comes at the ex
pense of an ?out-group? called Stanford Jr.
University.
Stanford is much lower key about the ri
valry. While it is mentioned at orientation, it
is not the cornerstone of your Stanford pride.
Sure we get the buildup during big game
week and the hype that accompanies a sto
ried rivalry between two of the best universi
ties, but we don?t have that year-round spew
ing of vitriol when we see the colors of an op-

posing university?s sweatshirts. For us here at
Stanford, life exists outside of the rivalry.
Dignity and point to Stanford.
Life outside campus: Stanford resides
near the city of Palo Alto. I say near because
it has basically built a 360 degree buffer zone
separating our campus from the rest of civi
lization. And unless your idea of fun is brows
ing around downtown Palo Alto looking for
an oversized Persian carpet for your dorm
room or dropping $2O a plate for lunch, the
surrounding city has nothing to offer a col
lege student. Don?t get me wrong, I would
LOVE to be able to afford those things (did
I mention I?m Persian and we average more
carpets than people in our houses?), but that
type of ballerific behavior lays on the horizon
for a guy like me.
In contrast, Cal offers a campus that feeds
right into the city. As a Berkeley student your
bus pass can take you from the heart of the
campus into Oakland and San Francisco
without a penny lost, and there?s the BART
(think Caltrain, but better in every way). The
