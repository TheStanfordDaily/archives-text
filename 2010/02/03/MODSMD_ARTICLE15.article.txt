# GET IT RIGHT
## Get a Grip, PETA 
### Erica Morgan 
I was prepared this week to offer blunt and
displeased commentary on Obama's State
of the Union speech. However, Obama's
address hardly seems worth remarking on: it
fit the typical State of the Union model, in
which the president pretends to have deliv
ered on promises, blames the nation's prob
lems on the former administration and then
proceeds to ask why we can't all just get
along.

Thus, I shall instead dedicate my column
this week to one of my favorite days of the
year: Groundhog Day! For reasons that I my
self do not fully comprehend, I eagerly antici
pate the approach of February 2 each year.
Born in Punxsutawney, Pa., the Ground

hog Day tradition has endured since 1886.
From the official Groundhog Club Web site:
"After Phil emerges from his burrow on Feb
ruary 2, he speaks to the Groundhog Club
president in "Groundhogese"(a language
only understood by the current president of
the Inner Circle). His proclamation is then
translated for the world."

A strange tradition perhaps: to wrest a hi
bernating woodchuck from his hole and gauge
his ground-hoggish antics for signs of an early
spring. Yet it possesses a sort of backwoods ap
peal. It is an excuse to watch the epic Bill Mur
ray film, ponder the imminence of an amazing
spring quarter at Stanford and feel a cozy (if
slightly ridiculous) attachment to nature.

Whether we celebrate Phil's foresight in pre
dicting an early spring or shake our fists at his
pessimistic prediction of extended winter, it is
hard to imagine that the quaint tradition
might offend anyone.
And yet the tragic truth reveals itself again:
that certain factions of society, no doubt suf
fering from a sense of aimlessness, tend to

latch on to insignificant "social evils"
to add purpose to their lives. Alas,
PETA has declared war against
Groundhog Day. The problem? Well,
groundhogs, naturally shy creatures,
ought not be subjected to the fanfare
of the Groundhog Festival. The cap
tive groundhog, victim of gross abuse,
is a prisoner of the superstitious hicks,
and must be freed forthwith to hiber
nate in peace.The alternative? PETA
suggests a robotic groundhog replace
Punxsutawney Phil on the day of cli
mate judgment. According to the
PETA executive Vice President,
"Switching to a robotic animal for
Groundhog Day celebrations would
be a win-win situation for the town.
An animatronic groundhog would at
tract new and curious tourists, and the
real groundhogs would finally get a
good winter's sleep."

Unless I mistake the desires of
tourists, it is unlikely that a robotic
ground beaver will have a vast deal of
crowd appeal. Does PETA really be
lieve that tourists will load up the car
and turn out for a weather prediction
by a lump of metal and synthetic fur?
Don't get me wrong: I love rodents. I
am just as fond of a hamster or gerbil
as your average pet-friendly student.
Pet rodents, like our friend Phil, are
certainly not naturally outgoing so
cial creatures.Through a rather amaz
ing process known as domestication,
these naturally shy creatures become
accustomed to human interactions.

Additionally, contrary to the
PETA portrayal, Phil the groundhog

is hardly subjected to tragic life be
hind iron bars. William Deeley, presi
dent of the Groundhog Club, re
marked that Phil is "being treated
better than the average child in Penn
sylvania." This statement is no doubt
an exaggeration, but it is true that the
groundhog's enclosure is climate
controlled and is annually inspected
by the state Department of Agricul
ture.

Perhaps PETA should be asking
more important questions, such as:
are raccoons being marginalized on
Stanford Campus? Is the impaling of
a teddy-bear on the Claw during Big
Game representative of an unhealthy
student hatred of grizzlies? Do cock
roaches really deserve extermina
tion?

Kidding aside, I hope you've all
had a fantastic February 2 and that
you enjoyed the innocent tradition as
much as I do!

Perhaps PETA should
be asking more
important questions
[...] are racoons being
marginalized?
