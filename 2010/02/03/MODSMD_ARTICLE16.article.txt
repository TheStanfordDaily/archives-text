# STRANGELY CHARMING
## Life, the Universe and Everything 
### Jack Cackler 
I have been called many things in my time
at Stanford: a gentleman, a scholar, a
friend, a wild man, a revolutionary, a men
ace to society and the savior of Stanford, but
most of all, I am a huge dork. My descent into
geekdom is far gone and extensive, past the
gentle waters of cheap puns, through the fer
tile valleys of random science trivia and into
the depths of the jungles of esoteric knowl
edge in abstruse fields nobody should know
about. And so, henceforth, each week I shall
be attempting to light the light of knowledge
in each of you with the blow torch of modern
science, by regaling you with a fascinating re
cent development in the research world, and
relating it to your every day lives.
To start us off, I thought I'd brief you on
some of the recent developments in the past
few months in the search for life on other
planets. Arthur C. Clarke may have jumped
the gun a little bit in predicting we'd make
contact in 2010, but there have been a host of
monolithic discoveries in just the last few
months. On January 4, NASA's Kepler Tele
scope (based right here in Mountain View!)
found not one, but five new planets, all
around the size of Neptune. Given that the
first extrasolar planet (a planet from another
solar system) was only found in 1995, finding
five in one mission is a resounding success.
Closer to home (well, relatively speak
ing), in December, the Cassini spacecraft

confirmed that Saturn's moon Titan has an
atmosphere that can sustain fog, and also
identified lakes on the surface, as well as pos
sible underground oceans. The climate on
Titan is quite alien (yes, you may groan) to
ours on Earth, and so the liquid in the fog and
the lakes is not water, but methane, CH4. For
you organic chemistry sleuths, the existence
of both organic material and liquid on anoth
er celestial body make a compelling case that
life could be there.

Finally, in one of the most exciting space
missions in recent history NASA's LCROSS
mission (also based in Mountain View at
Ames Research Center, not that I am biased)
launched a satellite into the South Pole of the
moon. Suspecting water beneath the surface,
the purpose of the mission was to see if
plumes of water would shoot out to confirm
the existence of water on the moon. The mis
sion was a success, and footage of the impact

is still available on NASA's website. The Indi
an Space Research Organization (ISRO), in
a rare dramatic move in the space communi
ty, preempted LCROSS by announcing
water on the moon on September 24, just two
weeks before the impact. Water is key to life
on Earth, and discovering water on other
moons or planets could be a key first step to
finding life there.

I want to stress that if we do find life some
where (and I believe we will), they will prob
ably not be elegant, blue, dragon-riding peo
ple that can mysteriously learn English, but
will probably bear a much closer resem
blance to the the tardigrades, the sulfitobac
ters and the other extremophiles on Earth
that have survived billions of years of aster
oids and ice ages with little effort. So while
we might eventually find talking blue people,
in the mean time, we should probably be con
tent with looking for "dumb" life.
The implications of such a discovery
would be vast. Would evidence of another civ
ilization give us insight into science and tech
nology and how to run our own? Would fight
ing with each other still seem meaningful at
all if we knew there was other life out there?
How would the existence of extraterrestrial
life affect religion or an anthropocentric

worldview in general? Would you
feel better about putting off that
IHUM paper? Believe it or not, the
Vatican already has a prepared
statement, written with the aid of
scientists, to read if life is ever dis
covered.

On the other hand, what if we are
alone? A macabre solution to the
Fermi Paradox (if there's life out
there, why hasn't it said hello yet?) is
that in the 4.6 billion year history of
the Earth, the development of
means of communication with other
worlds (radiotelescopes) and means
of our own destruction (nuclear
weapons) came within fifty years of
each other. Perhaps the deafening
silence is a grim reminder to play
nicely with each other. These are all
questions worth asking ourselves, so
that in the event that we should ever
meet a stranger from another world,
we will know how to say hello.
Hopefully, I've illuminated some
recent developments in the space
geek's universe about where life
might be found. While sometimes
(particularly after Thursday Senior
Nights) I question whether there is
intelligent life here at Stanford, I'm
confident that one day, perhaps in
our lifetimes, we will find it else
where.

Jack has a standing offer to bake
cookies (Earth cookies) for anyone
who can find a mistake in a column,
and can correct him. Let him know at
