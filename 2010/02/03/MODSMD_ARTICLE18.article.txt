## BOUNCE-BACK TIME 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball team
dropped in the rankings this week after a los
ing weekend, but it anticipates a change this
upcoming week against an unranked Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) oppo
nent, Pacific.
Last week, the Cardinal accumulated a total
of 18 team blocks and 41 service errors on the
weekend. For men's volleyball, one of the de
ciding factors between relatively equal teams
lies with the serving.
"I think serving is particularly important
considering how many serves we missed this
weekend at crucial points in both matches,"
said sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson.
However, last weekend Stanford also
proved it is capable of making a comeback. The
Card came from behind for a near victory
against current No. 1 Cal State Northridge, but
ultimately lost 15-13 in the fifth and final set.
"We pride ourselves in being a team that
never gives up," said senior setter Kawika
Shoji.
Last weekend, Pacific also faced No. 1
Northridge and fell 3-0 the Tigers are now

0-6 in MPSF conference play. The team was
freshman-led against Northridge, with outside
hitter Taylor Hughes recording 10 kills. With
the exception of senior outside hitter Jason
Borchin, Pacific features a relatively young
starting lineup that includes freshman setter
Patrick Tunnell, who had 31 assists against the
Matadors.

Pacific played No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara the
night before with a different mix of players
leading the team, showing the versatility in
their lineup. Sophomore opposite Sean Daley
led the offensive with 11 kills and senior setter
Kevin Downing racked up 31 assists.
"They pass very well which means that they
are 'in-system' and running their offense," said
Stanford head coach John Kosty. "When a
team has this luxury, they do not give up a lot of
points. We will have to bring our 'A' serving
game to create point scoring opportunities."
Last year in the Stanford-Pacific series,
Stanford swept the first match 3-0 in mid-Janu
ary and did it again in late March. In January,
senior opposite Evan Romero hit 16 kills and
10 digs, and Shoji had 45 assists on the match.
Pacific's offensive highs came from Kevin
Pratte and Clay Ostrander, who hit 11 kills

each. In March, junior outside hitter Spencer

McLachlin reached 12 kills, Lawson added in
11 and Romero had 10. Whereas Stanford's of
fense stepped it up the second time around,
only Nicolaas Schenk recorded kills in the dou
ble digits for the Tigers.

"Both teams have improved over last year,"
Kosty said. "Pacific has added two new players
to their lineup from last year, Hughes and [Flo
rian] Gornik, who are playing very well."

Other than the gained experience of having
another year under its belt, the Card encoun
tered a few positives in recent play. Newer
players, such as freshmen outside hitters Myles
Muagututia and Jake Kneller and redshirt
sophomore Charley Henrikson, all saw playing
time.
"A positive coming out of the weekend was
the experience that a number of our substi
tutes got," Lawson said. "A number of guys
who haven't gotten to play gained valuable
game experience, which will only make our
team stronger as a result."
In preparation for this week's games, the
team has focused on specific skills in the small
period of practice days before tonight's game.
"We went 'back to basics,'" Kosty said.
"With this short week, we have concentrated
on a few things that will better prepare us for
Pacific and Santa Cruz. We are excited to get
back on the court and compete for an MPSF
win."
The Stanford men's volleyball team will
take on Pacific tonight at 7 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.
