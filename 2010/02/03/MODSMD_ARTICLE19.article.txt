# Prepare for the real dead week

You want to know what rock
bottom feels like? Put your
self in the shoes of PGA
Commissioner Tim
Finchem.
A year ago this time, the golf world
was buzzing about the return of Tiger
Woods to the tour. After an eight
month injury-forced layoff, golfs mes
siah stepped back into the tee box, and
all was right again in the PGA. Atten
dance was back up, ratings stopped
their nosedive and some much-needed
revenue was being pumped back into
the tour.

A Thanksgiving night car crash, a
voice mail (Huge. Quickly.), and a
who's who list of over-the-hill porn
stars and strippers later, the PGA is left
with this: the most publicity it can arti
ficially manufacture has to do with the
grooves in Phil Mickelson's Ping-Eye 2
irons that are older than yours truly.
The controversy has to do with the
PGA banning square grooves on club
heads in favor of V-shaped grooves
that generate less spin.
