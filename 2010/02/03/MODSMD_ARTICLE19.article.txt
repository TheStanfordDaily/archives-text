# Prepare for the real dead week

You want to know what rock
bottom feels like? Put your
self in the shoes of PGA
Commissioner Tim
Finchem.
A year ago this time, the golf world
was buzzing about the return of Tiger
Woods to the tour. After an eight
month injury-forced layoff, golfs mes
siah stepped back into the tee box, and
all was right again in the PGA. Atten
dance was back up, ratings stopped
their nosedive and some much-needed
revenue was being pumped back into
the tour.

A Thanksgiving night car crash, a
voice mail (Huge. Quickly.), and a
who's who list of over-the-hill porn
stars and strippers later, the PGA is left
with this: the most publicity it can arti
ficially manufacture has to do with the
grooves in Phil Mickelson's Ping-Eye 2
irons that are older than yours truly.
The controversy has to do with the
PGA banning square grooves on club
heads in favor of V-shaped grooves
that generate less spin.
So we went from the world's most
recognizable athlete making his tri
umphant return to golf to a complex
physics lesson concerning an aspect
of the game of which the casual fan
has no knowledge, let alone interest,
in. The Tiger-Jack Nicklaus "greatest
player" debates have been replaced
by a Mickelson-Scott McCarron cat
fight about 20-year-old golf clubs.
Rock bottom.
Here's the real scary part. In less
than a week, Mickelson's groove
issue could be one of the few com
pelling sports stories. Once the Super
Bowl is over on Sunday, what do we
have left (besides two weeks of post
game recap and a few more Peyton-
Timberlake Sony commercials)?
The NBA playoffs are months
away, but the regular season is over.
Any team that has a chance to win the
championship has virtually clinched a
playoff berth.
Ditto for the NHL.
Unless you're a baseball nerd, I'm
assuming the Giants signing former
closer Byung-Hyun Kim to a minor
league deal isn't going to have you
running to the water cooler for dis
cussion and analysis.
The Australian Open is over, and
in a shocking upset, the British didn't
win.
Surely there must be some Stan
ford sports to entertain us, right?
While Cardinal men's basketball
(and every other Pac-10 team) is still
in the hunt for the conference title, in
terms of the NCAA Tournament in
March, these games mean little. The
Pac-10 has so underperformed (or
met expectations, depending on who
you ask), that most likely the only
conference team who will receive a
bid to March Madness will be the win
ner of the Pac-10 postseason tourna
ment.
No. 1 women's water polo started
its season last weekend, but unless
you're in KA or Kappa, I'm guessing
you didn't notice.
In short, come Monday morning,
get ready to learn all you never want
ed to know about the grooves in Phil
Mickelson's golf clubs. Is he cheating?
Is it against the spirit of the rule? Is
playing with 20-year-old golf clubs
even an advantage?
Any more and I'm going to be
launching my V-groove clubs through
the TV.

The good news is that the sports

drought will only last a week, as the
Winter Olympics begin Feb. 12. For
two weeks, we will be relieved from
the obligatory February lull. From
there, it's not too far from March
Madness. After that, you can practi
cally taste baseball Opening Day and
the NBA and NF1L playoffs.

Relief is on the way. You just need
to survive next week. Luckily for me, I
got two midterms to ease the pain.

Mike Lazarus needs to find a European
soccer team to follow for two weeks.
