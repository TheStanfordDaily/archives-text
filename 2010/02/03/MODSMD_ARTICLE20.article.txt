### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's and women's track and
field teams traveled to College Station, Texas this
past weekend to compete at the Texas A&M
Challenge. The meet featured Pac-10 schools as
well as competitors from the Big-12 and SEC.
Stanford, Oregon and Washington State repre
sented the Pac-10.The Big-12 was represented by
Texas A&M, Texas and Baylor, while the SEC
was represented by Arkansas, Florida and South
Carolina.

The men were led by an amazing performance
from junior Jake Riley, who won the 5,000 meters
with a personal best time of 13:52.87. Riley's time
was also enough to get him a provisional stan
dard. Following Riley was junior Brendan Gregg,
who finished in third with a time of 14:30.97.
The other Stanford runner who won an event
for the men was sophomore Dylan Ferris. Fie
captured the 800-meter title with a provisional
standard time of 1:48.67. Unfortunately, Ferris
missed the automatic qualifying time by less than
a second but did have the honor of setting an
indoor personal record, as well as moving into
second in the all-time Stanford indoor records
list.
"In the open 800 I just listened to coach
[Jason] Dunn and made a solid move from 350
meters out," Ferris said.
In the men's 3,000 meters, Stanford had three
provisional times, provided by senior Justin Mar
pole-Bird, junior JT Sullivan and sophomore
Benjamin Johnson. Marpole-Bird placed second
with a time of 7:57.15, Sullivan placed seventh
with a time of 8:01.61 and Johnson finished

eighth with a time of 8:04.54.
"Personally, the meet was a good
opportunity to gauge my readiness
and fitness level by running races on
consecutive days," Marpole-Bird
said. "I was very happy with a 3:58
mile split on the relay and even hap
pier that our team was able to run
well enough to probably make it to
nationals on time. I was also pleased
with how I fared in the 3K, although
I would have liked to have been able
to run a bit faster and hit the auto
matic standard in that event."

In his Stanford debut, freshmen

Andrew Berberick placed third in
the mile with a time of 4:04.74.

Also faring well for the Cardinal,
earning another provisional stan
dard, was the distance medley relay
of Sullivan, sophomore Amaechi
Morton, Ferris and Marpole-Bird.
The team finished in second place,
right behind Oregon, with a time of
9:30.25.

"Personally on the DMR I felt
like I ran a good split and got Mar
pole the baton in a good position,"
Ferris said. "Next time we go up
against Oregon we want to be sure to
cross the line in front of them. With
whoever runs we are ready to get a
solid DMR performance and get
ready for nationals."

In the field events, the men were
once more led by the consistently

strong performance of freshman
Jules Sharpe. Sharpe placed second
in the high jump with a mark of 6-11.
On the women's side, the distance
runners dominated as well, led by
sophomore Georgia Griffin, who
won the 5,000 meters with a provi
sional time of 16:38.25.

Another meet title was provided
by senior Whitney Liehr, who won
the triple jump. Liehr's mark of 41-
10.5 was a provisional standard.
Next up for the Cardinal is a vari
ety of meets that certain athletes
could attend, those being in either
Nebraska, New Mexico or Washing
ton.
