The Stanford men's and women's track and
field teams traveled to College Station, Texas this
past weekend to compete at the Texas A&M
Challenge. The meet featured Pac-10 schools as
well as competitors from the Big-12 and SEC.
Stanford, Oregon and Washington State repre
sented the Pac-10.The Big-12 was represented by
Texas A&M, Texas and Baylor, while the SEC
was represented by Arkansas, Florida and South
Carolina.

The men were led by an amazing performance
from junior Jake Riley, who won the 5,000 meters
with a personal best time of 13:52.87. Riley's time
was also enough to get him a provisional stan
dard. Following Riley was junior Brendan Gregg,
who finished in third with a time of 14:30.97.
The other Stanford runner who won an event
for the men was sophomore Dylan Ferris. Fie
captured the 800-meter title with a provisional
standard time of 1:48.67. Unfortunately, Ferris
missed the automatic qualifying time by less than
a second but did have the honor of setting an
indoor personal record, as well as moving into
second in the all-time Stanford indoor records
list.
"In the open 800 I just listened to coach
[Jason] Dunn and made a solid move from 350
meters out," Ferris said.
In the men's 3,000 meters, Stanford had three
provisional times, provided by senior Justin Mar
pole-Bird, junior JT Sullivan and sophomore
Benjamin Johnson. Marpole-Bird placed second
with a time of 7:57.15, Sullivan placed seventh
with a time of 8:01.61 and Johnson finished
