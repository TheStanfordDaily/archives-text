# Pac-10 basketball awards
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
The first half of the Pac-10
basketball season is in the
books, and since my editors
will introduce me to a guillo
tine if I use this space to talk
football again, it is incumbent upon us
to dole out some midseason awards.
The honorable Mike Lazarus already
gave out his Cardinal-specific team
honors last week; I'll focus on the Pac
-10 as a whole, for both men and women.
Let's get to it, shall we?

Player of the Year
Men: Landry Fields, Stanford
Fields currently stands atop the heap
in the conference's tightest race in both
sports. There are five players with legit
imate cases for POY: Fields, Washington
State's Klay Thompson, Cal's Jerome
Randle, Washington's Quincy Pondex
ter and Arizona's Nic Wise.
Why does Landry prevail? A quick
statistical look: Fields leads the Pac-10
in scoring, is second in rebounding (in
cluding fifth in offense boards), third in
steals, tenth in blocks and eleventh in as
sists. The only other two players who ap
proach that breadth of production are
Pondexter and Wise, and yet neither is
on Landry's level. Plus, while Fields has
been consistent both at Maples and on
the road, Pondexter and Wise have
floundered when away from home. Fi
nally, there is no player in the confer
ence who has had to assume the mas
sive leadership role that fell to Fields,
one that is equally impressive given that
he was never in such a position before.

Women: Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
Stanford
Outside readers are unlikely to con
tinue past this sentence — homerism, I
say! —but Nneka's main competition
for this spot comes from Cal's Alexis
Gray-Lawson and teammate Kayla Ped
ersen, and even then, Ogwumike is clear
ly above the rest. Like Fields, she leads the
conference in scoring and is second in re
bounding, both overall and on offense ex
clusively. But the statistic that stands out
is her inhuman shooting percentage:
she's nailing 64.7 percent of her shots,
while the next best, Arizona State 's Becca
Tobin, sits at 53.6 percent. But it gets bet
ter: Nneka has also attempted the most
shots in the conference she has 145
total while Oregon's Taylor Lilley, in
second, has 132 to her name.
Pedersen has a perfectly good case
of her own, and indeed, the final step of
her evolution into a true wing player has
been one of the best storylines of the
Cardinal's season. She's shooting
tremendously from beyond the arc
while also crashing the boards and play
ing the most minutes on the team. But
Stanford's strength stems from its post
play, and Ogwumike, with her constant
aggression and patented hanging
jumper, has made the Cardinal tick.

Coach of the Year
Men: Herb Sendek, Arizona State
Does Johnny Dawkins have a good
case? Absolutely. His optimization of
talent has been nothing short of out
standing, and his in-game coaching has
undressed luminaries like John Cali
pari. So why Sendek? He lost two first
team All-Pac-10 performers in James
Harden, the conference's Player of the
Year in 2008-2009, and Jeff Pender
graph, which forced the Sun Devils to
enter 2009-2010 without a featured
player (unlike Dawkins and Fields, for
instance) and instead, a motley crew of
decent starters and backups. Sendek
implemented a deeper rotation and, de
spite a generally star-less team (Ty Ab
bott is as close as they come), the Sun
Devils sit just one game behind Cal and
Arizona for the conference lead.

Women: Michael Cooper, USC
It was a tough choice between Coop
er and UCLA's Nikki Caldwell (al
though Tara VanDerveer could justifi
ably win this award every year). Cooper
gets the edge because, in his first season
coaching the college game, he has led
USC, a relatively young team, to wins
over Cal, UCLA and Arizona State. This
success has come despite losing Camille
LeNoir and Nadia Parker, both of whom
were All-Pac-10 honorees.

Freshman of the Year
Men: Derrick Williams, Arizona
Williams beats out Washington
State's Reggie Moore, but the reasons

are clear: Williams tops Moore in scor
ing, is in the top five in the conference in
rebounding and shooting percentage
and is tied with Fields for tenth in
blocked shots. Moore does dish out a
number of assists and is active defen
sively, too, but Williams has been asked
to do more for the Wildcats than Moore
has for the Cougars, and he has per
formed valiantly.

Women: Markel Walker, UCLA
On the surface, this appeared to be
a tough decision. Arizona's Davellyn
Whyte is third in the conference with
17.9 points per game and, despite
being a guard, is in the top ten in field
goal percentage and drains 40 percent
of her threes. But outside of her scor
ing ability, she's fairly one dimension
al, which opens the door for the more
well-rounded Walker.
She ranks in the top 10 in the con
ference in rebounds, offensive
boards, steals and field goal percent
age, all while leading the Bruins in
scoring over the course of the year

(Jasmine Dixon has a higher aver
age, but has played in less than two
thirds of UCLA's games). As with
most of the awardees, the full resume
matters more than a couple of im
pressive line items. This is certainly
true here.
Add in the Bruins' supremacy
over Arizona both head-to-head and
overall, and Walker takes home the
midseason honor in an upset.

Wyndam Makowsky has avoided the
guillotine, but sold his football-ob
sessed soul in doing so. Pass judgment
to makowsky@stanford.edu.

bounding, both overall and on offense ex
clusively. But the statistic that stands out
is her inhuman shooting percentage:
she's nailing 64.7 percent of her shots,
while the next best, Arizona State 's Becca
Tobin, sits at 53.6 percent. But it gets bet
ter: Nneka has also attempted the most
shots in the conference she has 145
total while Oregon's Taylor Lilley, in
second, has 132 to her name.
Pedersen has a perfectly good case
of her own, and indeed, the final step of
her evolution into a true wing player has
been one of the best storylines of the
Cardinal's season. She's shooting
tremendously from beyond the arc
while also crashing the boards and play
ing the most minutes on the team. But
Stanford's strength stems from its post
play, and Ogwumike, with her constant
aggression and patented hanging
jumper, has made the Cardinal tick.

Coach of the Year
Men: Herb Sendek, Arizona State
Does Johnny Dawkins have a good
case? Absolutely. His optimization of
talent has been nothing short of out
standing, and his in-game coaching has
undressed luminaries like John Cali
pari. So why Sendek? He lost two first
team All-Pac-10 performers in James
Harden, the conference's Player of the
Year in 2008-2009, and Jeff Pender
graph, which forced the Sun Devils to
enter 2009-2010 without a featured
player (unlike Dawkins and Fields, for
instance) and instead, a motley crew of
decent starters and backups. Sendek
implemented a deeper rotation and, de
spite a generally star-less team (Ty Ab
bott is as close as they come), the Sun
Devils sit just one game behind Cal and
Arizona for the conference lead.

Women: Michael Cooper, USC
It was a tough choice between Coop
er and UCLA's Nikki Caldwell (al
though Tara VanDerveer could justifi
ably win this award every year). Cooper
gets the edge because, in his first season
coaching the college game, he has led
USC, a relatively young team, to wins
over Cal, UCLA and Arizona State. This
success has come despite losing Camille
LeNoir and Nadia Parker, both of whom
were All-Pac-10 honorees.

Freshman of the Year
Men: Derrick Williams, Arizona
Williams beats out Washington
State's Reggie Moore, but the reasons

are clear: Williams tops Moore in scor
ing, is in the top five in the conference in
rebounding and shooting percentage
and is tied with Fields for tenth in
blocked shots. Moore does dish out a
number of assists and is active defen
sively, too, but Williams has been asked
to do more for the Wildcats than Moore
has for the Cougars, and he has per
formed valiantly.

Women: Markel Walker, UCLA
On the surface, this appeared to be
a tough decision. Arizona's Davellyn
Whyte is third in the conference with
17.9 points per game and, despite
being a guard, is in the top ten in field
goal percentage and drains 40 percent
of her threes. But outside of her scor
ing ability, she's fairly one dimension
al, which opens the door for the more
well-rounded Walker.
She ranks in the top 10 in the con
ference in rebounds, offensive
boards, steals and field goal percent
age, all while leading the Bruins in
scoring over the course of the year

(Jasmine Dixon has a higher aver
age, but has played in less than two
thirds of UCLA's games). As with
most of the awardees, the full resume
matters more than a couple of im
pressive line items. This is certainly
true here.
Add in the Bruins' supremacy
over Arizona both head-to-head and
overall, and Walker takes home the
midseason honor in an upset.

Wyndam Makowsky has avoided the
guillotine, but sold his football-ob
sessed soul in doing so. Pass judgment
