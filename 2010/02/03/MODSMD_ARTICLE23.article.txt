# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Cardinal sweeps Aggies 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Another drizzly day lead to a hec
tic pregame warm-up, but when the
Stanford women's tennis team (2-0)
finally played its matches against UC-
Davis, there were no problems as the
Cardinal came away with a 7-0 sweep.
Stanford won in straight-sets in all
six singles matches, surrendering a
mere 18 games combined compared
to 72 games won. Junior Hilary Barte
and sophomore Veronica Li posted
the best results, with two 6-0,6-1 wins
at the No. 1 and No. 6 spots, respec
tively. Barte's win came over an old
opponent, Desiree Stone.
"We actually go way back," Barte
said. "We've known each other since
we were 10, and that definitely played
into the psychology of the match a lot.
It's not like she didn't play well, I
think she just lost her will to fight at
the end."

Doubles were well contested by
the Aggies, but Cardinal domination
was the end result again. Barte and
her partner, senior Lindsay Burdette,
defeated their opposing team,
Legaspi and Stone, 8-1, putting them
at 15-1 for the year and now on a 14-
match winning streak.
Rain haunted the team all day,
coming down for a few minutes and
then letting up again. The women did
n't know how long they would be able
to play for, or if they could play at all.
"We spent a phenomenal amount
of time trying to get the courts ready,"
said head coach Lele Forood. "It driz
zled three times, and it was just an ef
fort to get the whole thing in. We were
delighted to get all the singles and
doubles done."

Unfortunately, Stanford's upcom
ing road trip to Texas won't prove the
escape to the sun that the team had

hoped. With expected forecasts in the
low 60s, it will be similar weather to
the Bay Area. The team is already
planning to use the indoor courts for
practice. Otherwise, preparation will
mostly involve getting ahead on
schoolwork.

"Tomorrow, hopefully if it doesn't
rain, we'll have regular practice," Barte
said. "We have a really early flight on
Thursday so we'll try to get a lot of
sleep and catch up on school work be
fore we leave. It's midterm week, and
that's tough on all the players."
One match today that proved the
effect midterms were having on the
players was freshman Stacey Tan's at
the No. 4 spot. With a final score of 6-
2,6-4, it was far from a horrible show
ing, but that just gives credit to her
focus on the court. She lost a little of
that focus at the end, showing some
anger in a ball smacked at the court,
but all that was put behind her as
Stacey stopped the slide and kept the
match from going to a third set.

"[Stacey] started really well, but
she dropped some games at the end
of the match and that's what made it
a little closer," Forood said. "She had
a lot of midterm stuff on her mind.
It's definitely something that affects
your physical play, when school gets
in your head."

Distractions will not end when
the weekend comes, as now the play
ers will need to contend with the rau
cous Texas crowd. With a fan base
that comes out in force for its players,
matches can get intense, and that will
be a big difference between Stan
ford's past two home matches and
this upcoming weekend.
"Being away is always different
from playing at home," Barte said.
"[Assistant coach] Frankie [Bren
nan] mentioned that Texas histori
cally has a hostile crowd, but we've
seen it before. I personally like it. I
don't mind when people are cheering
against me. It gets me pumped up."
Atmospheres like this one, away
from home and facing a tough home
crowd, are what Forood want for her
team. She believes the preparation
the team gets now will only help it
going into the bigger matches coming
later in the season.

"We've got to learn to play well at
both ends," Forood said. "This is a sea
son where we're going to play lots of
significant matches on the road this
quarter. We'll see,but we have to learn
how to handle both home and away."

Texas and Texas Christian Univer
sity will prove to be great measuring
sticks for the Cardinal as it prepares
to test out its limits for the season.
These matches, which will be played
on Friday and Saturday, may show
just how far this Stanford team can go.
