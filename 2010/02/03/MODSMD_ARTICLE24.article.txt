# CAL CRUSHED, AGAIN
## 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its third face-off of the season,
No. 2 Stanford crushed Bay Area
rival No. 7 Cal, 337.950-238.300 at
Saturday evening's Stanford Open.
With the Winter Cup Challenge in
Las Vegas, Nev. a Who's Who
event of men's gymnastics and gate
way to US Senior National Team se
lection just a week away, Stanford
head coach Thorn Glielmi allowed
veterans to rest up or compete as in
dividuals and rookies to shine during
Saturday's event.
"[The Stanford Open] was a great
opportunity for all the guys to com
pete," said assistant coach J.D. Reive.
Freshman Eddie Penev was the
only Stanford gymnast to compete in
all six events, earning a total score of
82.85 in his collegiate all-around
debut and posting the top scores of
the meet on floor exercise and vault.
Meanwhile, fellow freshman James
Fosco wowed the crowd with his
steady still rings routine, earning a
top score of 14.75.
Sophomores John Martin and
Cameron Foreman were just as im
pressive as their younger counter
parts. Martin earned the competi
tion's top score on parallel bars with a
14.55, while Foreman executed a

nearly perfect high bar routine for a
score of 14.6.

Redshirt sophomore Abhinav Ra
mani performed well in his first meet
of the season, earning scores of 14.45
and 15.0 on floor exercise and vault,
respectively. Not to be outdone, sen
ior Eric Hergenrader, considered a
veteran among his young teammates,
posted an impressive 15.6 on vault.
While Hergenrader has competed
in a number of meets throughout his
Stanford career, he has not often
been lauded for his performances.
And Ramani simply has not spent
much time on the competitive floor,
thanks to numerous injuries. Accord
ing to Reive, both are now in a situa
tion where they have a lot of poten
tial to contribute. In the coming
weeks, both may just shake things up
in the lineup.
While Stanford rose to the occa
sion thanks in part to strength and
talent of its youngsters Cal
seemed to lack much of its luster.
Like Stanford, Cal had many of its
athletes on the bench or competing as
individuals during the Stanford
Open, therefore sending just one or
two competitors to certain appara
tuses.
Still, Cal displayed its strength on
pommel horse, with sophomore Glen
Ishino and junior Kyle Bunthuwong

posting the top two scores on the
event with 15.2 and 14.1, respectively.
Bunthuwong also stole the high bar
show with a score of 15.05.
According to Reive, those in the
gymnastics community will not rule
out Cal as a gymnastics powerhouse
despite its near-100-point loss this
past Saturday. After two straight loss
es to Stanford early in January, Cal
was at a psychological disadvantage
coming into Saturday's meet. Addi
tionally, the meet was a low-key affair
compared to other competitions, es
pecially with the Winter Cup just
around the corner.
However, there was something to
be said for Stanford's performance as
well.
"[Us] putting up a decent team
score without our main counters car
ries much more intimidation weight,"
Reive noted.
Saturday's showing proves that
even without its top scorers, including
juniors Alex Buscaglia, Tim Gentry
and Ryan Lieberman, Stanford still
has an incredible amount of depth.
Next up, Stanford travels to Las
Vegas for the Winter Cup Challenge
Thursday through Saturday, Feb. 4
through 6.
