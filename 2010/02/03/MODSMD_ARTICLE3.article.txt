## Kishimoto campaign stops by Farm 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Graduate School of Business
alumna Yoriko Kishimoto, former
Palo Alto mayor and City Council
member, is running for a 21st district
state assembly seat the only
woman among three candidates in
the race.
Kishimoto made a campaign stop
at Stanford on Tuesday night to
share her background and her politi
cal ambitions.
Kishimoto immigrated to the
United States from Japan in elemen
tary school. A self-described shy stu
dent and avid reader, she eventually
went on to earn a bachelor's from
Wesleyan and an MBA in 1981 from
Stanford. After graduation,
Kishimoto spent 20 years working as
a management consultant for
Japanese and American technology
entrepreneurs.
In 2001, despite never previously
being interested in a political career,
Kishimoto ran for local City Council
and came in second out of 13 candi
dates. "It was a total grassroots cam
paign," she explained to representa
tives of Stanford Democrats last
night at Old Union. In 2007, she was
elected mayor of Palo Alto.
Throughout her political career,
Kishimoto's primary focus has been
environmentally sound infrastruc
ture in the Palo Alto region. "If Palo
Alto and Stanford, both on the cut
ting edge, cannot learn how to devel
op ourselves without having a nega
tive impact on the environment, who
can?" she asked Tuesday.
Reflecting on the progress made
during her time as a local elected
official and her motivation for run
ning for state office, Kishimoto said,
"I feel like we got so much done, it
was so rewarding. But working in
regional, I could see the negative
impact of what was happening with
our mother ship. I'm running
because our wonderful state is bro
ken, and we cannot continue in this
direction."

She said she feels passionately
about transportation issues, a pas
sion she wants to carry over to the
state legislature. "California is such a
car culture," she said. "But if there's
one thing you can bet on, it's that 50
years from now, transportation is
going to be different. That's going to
be true for all basic types of infra
structure — energy production and
use, water and hopefully food, as
well."
Kishimoto said she especially
looks forward to the future of
Senate Bill 375, a state law com
pelling areas of California to come
up with regional plans to lower
greenhouse gas emissions by 2013.
One of her goals if elected would be
to establish Bay Area incentives to
build charging stations and other
infrastructure to support electric
cars.

One member of Stanford
Democrats wanted to know how
Kishimoto would respond to and
work within the political gridlock of
Sacramento. Kishimoto replied that
she's not afraid to jump on complex
and difficult issues.

"I like to tackle problems that
other people think are unsolvable,"
she said.
When asked about what differen
tiates her from the other candidates,

Kishimoto responded that she feels
her track record of thinking in the
long term and with a global perspec
tive both set her apart as a potential
Assembly member. She also cited
her combination of experience as an
elected official and in the private
sector.

"I know how to move public pol
icy levers and make things happen,"
Kishimoto said. "Plus, I would also
be the first woman to represent the
district."
