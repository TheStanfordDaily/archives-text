alumna Yoriko Kishimoto, former
Palo Alto mayor and City Council
member, is running for a 21st district
state assembly seat the only
woman among three candidates in
the race.
Kishimoto made a campaign stop
at Stanford on Tuesday night to
share her background and her politi
cal ambitions.
Kishimoto immigrated to the
United States from Japan in elemen
tary school. A self-described shy stu

went on to earn a bachelor's from
Wesleyan and an MBA in 1981 from
Stanford. After graduation,
Kishimoto spent 20 years working as

"I feel like we got so much done, it
was so rewarding. But working in
regional, I could see the negative
impact of what was happening with
our mother ship. I'm running
because our wonderful state is bro
ken, and we cannot continue in this
direction."

She said she feels passionately
about transportation issues, a pas
sion she wants to carry over to the
state legislature. "California is such a
car culture," she said. "But if there's
one thing you can bet on, it's that 50
years from now, transportation is
going to be different. That's going to
be true for all basic types of infra
