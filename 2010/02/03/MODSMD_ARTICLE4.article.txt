# Researchers bypass stem cell stage
## Professor Marius Wernig's lab changes mice cells directly into nerve cells 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford researchers have discovered how to turn a
mouse skin cell directly into a nerve cell eliminating
the need to go through a stem cell stage.
"The fact that we're able to do this is extremely
stunning," said pathology Prof Marius Wernig, the pri
mary author of the paper.
Researchers in Wernig's lab took skin cells from
mice and, using three factors in the laboratory, trans
formed them directly into induced nerve cells. The
nerve cells are capable of creating an action poten
tial and creating synapses, along with other neural

functions.
"This is proof of principle that [direct transforma
tion] can happen," said Irving Weismann MD '65, a
pathology professor and leading stem cell researcher at
Stanford. "However, it still has to be done in humans."
Before this breakthrough, in order to transform
one type of cell into another, the original cell had to be
induced back into a stem cell. Then the stem cell could
differentiate into a number of different types of cells.
"[By] going backward,you can imagine it's possible
to induce, but this is a completely new way...a cell in
the body never has to [directly transform]," Wernig
said. "It's very artificial, if you will."
Though this process is extremely young and needs

more exploration, it has many possible clinical appli
cations, Weissman explained. For example, examining
the cells in culture could lead to breakthroughs in
many neurological diseases.

"[Someone could] take skin cells from someone
who has a disease, reprogram them into neurons and
see what's gone wrong if they have Parkinson's or
Lou Gehrig's disease," he said.

Wernig expressed similar hopes for the new cells.
"[We could] capture disease processes with these cells
in these systems. They can't be mimicked in animal
cells really we 11... [We're] intrigued to have the idea
