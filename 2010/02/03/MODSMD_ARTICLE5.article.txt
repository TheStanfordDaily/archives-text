## More concern raised over special fees bill Financial Officers debate with the ASSU 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate and a number of student
group financial officers battled it
out Wednesday night as groups
demonstrated continued concern
for a roster of new funding poli
cies— which passed in a unani
mous vote after final deliberation
that may constrict their func
tioning capacity.
The Senate Appropriations
Committee convened for a policy
review session on Sunday to
revise proposed amendments to
funding policies that will make
the rules about how groups may
spend special fees funds more
strict.
Many of the policies point at
creating firmer guidelines for how
groups spend money, leaving little
to luxury, let alone full coverage,
for travel expenses which remain
integral parts of some groups'
activities.
Some Spending Caps
Debilitating, FO Says
Adam Adler 'l2, financial offi
cer for Stanford Mock Trial,
pleaded against the amendments
to travel funding policies, suggest
ing that its limitations aren't
"going to allow [Mock Trial and
others] to function."
The caps on travel funding in
particular constrain the mobility
of the team and out-of-pocket
spending is something that "a sig
nificant portion of the team can't
do, and some of the team won't
do," Adler said.
The tug-of-war between sena
tors and FOs entered new territo
rial ground this week as the body
discussed judgments about the
utility that the Senate assigns to
each group in terms of its ability
to satisfy and enrich large groups

of students.
"We think that there are some
things that bring more value to
the student body than others,"
Alex Katz 'l2 said, suggesting that
activities, including student travel,
that benefit only a very limited
sector of the Stanford community
should not be funded by special
fees as heavily as they have been
in the past.
"We don't think it's totally jus
tified for when you pay your spe
cial fee of $lOO to then get thou
sands and thousands of dollars for
your Mock Trial group so that you
can travel around the country,"
Katz said.
Adler expressed views consis
tent with former Appropriations
Chair Stephanie Epps 'lO, who
suggested that the bill passed
after a re-vote last week would
only encourage groups seeking
special fees to request larger
budgets than before. If the goal of
the bill backfires, then the Senate
could face groups that go unap
proved and are not buoyed by
alternative funding that "cease to
exist entirely."
FOs Given Enough Time for
Input on Policies?
Some members of the Senate
voiced a lack of commitment on
behalf of FOs to contributing
more actively to the policy review
process.
"I received no suggestions
[regarding policies]," said Anton
Zietsman 'l2.
But questions seem to remain
among many FOs as to why the
policy review has only just begun
and why so little time has been
given to groups to offer their
opinions.
According to Zietsman, the
review session for the policies
considered had been discussed for
at least two weeks prior to con
vening formally on Sunday. "I
think there has been sufficient

time," he said.
Katz agreed that time for input
was plenty the issue was rather a
lack of interest by many in the policy
review process.

"There are four people on this
campus who seem interested in this
problem, or interested enough to
provide policy suggestions," Katz
said.

The Senate has reported that the
reforms written in the spirit of fiscal
responsibility are meant to drive
down the student activities fee,
which has reached exorbitant rates,
according to some senators.
Undergraduate students paid $ll9
per quarter in special fees this year,
and have the option to request
refunds later.

"I don't want you to assume that
the apocalypse is going to happen
when this takes into affect... we will
continue to give out money, but once
again, we're just trying to get people
to be more responsible with the
amount that they ask for," said
Senator Steven Singleton 'lO.

Funding Requests Still on the Rise,
But Senate Remains Under

Projected Budget
In a report of January's spend
ing, Zietsman outlined the contin
ued increase of groups' funding
requests, nearly $70,000 since last
year. Despite this increase, the num
ber of accepted requests remains at
a record low for the past few years at
only 34 percent approval rate, com
pared to 60 to 70 percent in the past
three years.

Meanwhile, as election season
approaches, elections commissioner
Quinn Slack 'll is finalizing modifi
cations to the elections process.
Polling stations will be arranged
across campus, Slack has said, along
with what he has called a "free to
run," policy which will delegate
some of the election commission's
marketing funds to be put to use by
candidates for their individual cam
paigns.

Without much of the dispute that
dominated the former part of its
meeting, the Senate passed all fund
ing bills as well as the new cabinet
level humanitarian aid position of
the Haiti relief "czar."
