## Lithuanain Prime Minister visits GSB 
### HEMING YIP 
In a special guest lecture at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
yesterday morning, Prime Minister of
Lithuania Andrius Kubilius provided
an overview of the Northern
European country and touted its com
mitment to innovation and higher
education, as well as its investment
friendly environment for foreign com
panies.

Prior to the lecture, the Prime
Minister met with Professor Garth

Saloner, Dean of the Graduate School
of Business, and Professor
Condoleezza Rice, who was instru
mental in helping Lithuania join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) in 2004 as Former President
Bush's National Security Advisor.
The lecture by Prime Minister
Kubilius, given in Professor Eric
Bettinger's Economics of Higher
Education class, emphasized infra
structure, innovation and higher edu
cation in Lithuania and how those fac
tors translate into economic competi

tiveness for the former Soviet
Republic. Kubilius praised Stanford as
the "best university in the world" and
urged the Graduate School of
Business students present to "watch
the Nordic-Baltic region," especially
Lithuania, for signs of rapid develop
ment in the coming years.
"What we are looking for is target
ed towards business development
goals in building Lithuania's long
term strategy for the next 10 years,"
Kubilius said in an interview with The
Daily after his lecture.
"I look forward to seeing how we
can develop Nordic-Baltic country
specific specialization on develop
ment of a high tech service hub," he
continued. "I just met with [the exec
utives of] Oracle, HP, Cisco. It is a very
good beginning, and we shall contin
ue. I hope those companies will see an
attraction in Lithuania."
He noted that he chose the GSB as
one of his stops in his visit to the
United States in part to see how deep
reforms in Lithuania's university sys
tem in making them more high tech
could be modeled after Silicon Valley.

The Prime Minister noted his
country's prime location at the center
of Europe and at the intersection of
Eastern Europe, the Baltic region and
the European Union (EU), of which
it became a member in 2004.
Membership in the EU has brought
Lithuania "economic assistance" and
the "the ability to be part of the huge
European market," Kubilius said.
Kubilius highlighted extensively
the economic growth and potential of
Lithuania. Before the 2008-2009 glob
al recession, Lithuania's economy had
one of the highest growth rates in the
EU, fueled by its innovation and inter
est in laser technology, medicine,
information technology, biotechnolo
gy, nanotechnology and materials sci
ence.

Nevertheless, the recent global
economic downturn has seriously
affected the Lithuanian economy.
Before the economic crisis, 60 percent
of Lithuania's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) was export-related,
and as a result, the country suffered
when other major economies and
trading partners were hit by recession.

Kubilius, however, remains confi
dent. "We are recovering," the Prime
Minister said. "When markets come
up [again] ... of course we shall
recover also."

To speed up his country's recovery
and strengthen its economy to weath
er another financial crisis, Kubilius
emphasized an aggressive attempt to
lure foreign investors to Lithuania.
Central to that effort is underscoring
the country's qualities, along with its
advantages as a strong hub of technol
ogy and investments.
While conceding that the country's
higher education system has "much to
improve," Kubilius stated it provides a
solid foundation for the knowledge

based economy that Lithuania is striv
ing to build. Moreover, 90 percent of
Lithuanians speak at least one foreign
language, usually English or Russian.

The Prime Minister went on to list
a series of noteworthy statistics of
Lithuania's development of necessary
infrastructure for a knowledge-based
economy and leadership in the
Internet and mobile communications
industries. Lithuania ranks first in the
world in Internet upload speed and
fourth in the world in broadband
quality. "I don't know how we have
150 mobile phones for every 100 peo
ple," he said, followed by laughs from
the audience.
In terms of Lithuania's economic
relationship with rising China, the
Prime Minister commented to The
Daily that Lithuania and China are in
good standing.
"We have good economic relation
ship in trade and manufacturing," he
told The Daily. "We are in good dis
cussions at an early stage to look into
possibilities to move goods from
China into Europe with railroads, not
shipping around Asia and Africa. We
are also preparing to participate in the
World Exposition in Shanghai [this
summer]."

The Prime Minister joked to The
Daily that Lithuania, which is known
to produce many professional basket
ball players such as Zydrunas
Ilgauskus of the Cleveland Cavaliers,
among others, covers three things in
their government agenda: "Economic
growth, [Lithuania holding] the EU
presidency in 2013 and winning bas
ketball."

However, another high item on
their agenda is energy and low-car
bon energy technology. Lithuania is
currently building a new nuclear
power plant and is in an ongoing
internal debate about reliance on
Russia for energy.
"We are restructuring our electric
ity system, a field where some kind of
new supplies can be [from] wind, solar
and biofuels," Kubilius said. "We are
also looking to all the new possible
technologies on how to save energy."

Graduate student Yukihiro
Kashima was in the audience and had
little previous knowledge about
Lithuania.

"I thought his talk was quite
impressive," he said. "He really
informed us about the Lithuanian
economy's future prospects and the
government's commitment to
growth."

In the remainder of his visit to the
United States, Prime Minister
Kubilius is expected to discuss trade
and technological investment with
high-level officials in New York and

Washington, DC, including Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner,
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke
and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke. Also part of this trip's
investment-promotion efforts were
meetings with the executives of IBM,
Oracle, HP, Cisco and other Silicon
Valley high-tech companies.
The Prime Minister expressed
hope that like Silicon Valley, Sunrise
Valley â€”in Lithuania's capital city,
Vilnius would some day become a
magnet for business, science and tech
nology startups.
Kubilius pointed to the shift in
recent years from a government-regu
lated system to a market-based one,
the creation of a modern financial and
legal framework (including intellectu
al property rights) and other changes
in policy for science and technology.
His central message: that Lithuania is
now actively "hunting."
"Before," Kubilius said, "our gov
ernment was just sitting and waiting
when some companies from Silicon
Valley would come." Now, "we are
running around; we have knowledge;
we have everything; come, and you
will see."

infrastructure for a knowledge-based
economy and leadership in the
Internet and mobile communications
industries. Lithuania ranks first in the
world in Internet upload speed and
fourth in the world in broadband
quality. "I don't know how we have
150 mobile phones for every 100 peo
ple," he said, followed by laughs from
the audience.
In terms of Lithuania's economic
relationship with rising China, the
Prime Minister commented to The
Daily that Lithuania and China are in
good standing.
"We have good economic relation
ship in trade and manufacturing," he
told The Daily. "We are in good dis
cussions at an early stage to look into
possibilities to move goods from
China into Europe with railroads, not
shipping around Asia and Africa. We
are also preparing to participate in the
World Exposition in Shanghai [this
summer]."

The Prime Minister joked to The
Daily that Lithuania, which is known
to produce many professional basket
ball players such as Zydrunas
Ilgauskus of the Cleveland Cavaliers,
among others, covers three things in
their government agenda: "Economic
growth, [Lithuania holding] the EU
presidency in 2013 and winning bas
ketball."

However, another high item on
their agenda is energy and low-car
bon energy technology. Lithuania is
currently building a new nuclear
power plant and is in an ongoing
internal debate about reliance on
Russia for energy.
"We are restructuring our electric
ity system, a field where some kind of
new supplies can be [from] wind, solar
and biofuels," Kubilius said. "We are
also looking to all the new possible
technologies on how to save energy."

Graduate student Yukihiro
Kashima was in the audience and had
little previous knowledge about
Lithuania.

"I thought his talk was quite
impressive," he said. "He really
informed us about the Lithuanian
economy's future prospects and the
government's commitment to
growth."

In the remainder of his visit to the
United States, Prime Minister
Kubilius is expected to discuss trade
and technological investment with
high-level officials in New York and

Washington, DC, including Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner,
Commerce Secretary Gary Locke
and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke. Also part of this trip's
investment-promotion efforts were
meetings with the executives of IBM,
Oracle, HP, Cisco and other Silicon
Valley high-tech companies.
The Prime Minister expressed
hope that like Silicon Valley, Sunrise
Valley â€”in Lithuania's capital city,
Vilnius would some day become a
magnet for business, science and tech
nology startups.
Kubilius pointed to the shift in
recent years from a government-regu
lated system to a market-based one,
the creation of a modern financial and
legal framework (including intellectu
al property rights) and other changes
in policy for science and technology.
His central message: that Lithuania is
now actively "hunting."
"Before," Kubilius said, "our gov
ernment was just sitting and waiting
when some companies from Silicon
Valley would come." Now, "we are
running around; we have knowledge;
we have everything; come, and you
will see."

In a special guest lecture at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
yesterday morning, Prime Minister of
Lithuania Andrius Kubilius provided
an overview of the Northern
European country and touted its com
mitment to innovation and higher
education, as well as its investment
friendly environment for foreign com
panies.

Prior to the lecture, the Prime
Minister met with Professor Garth

Saloner, Dean of the Graduate School
of Business, and Professor
Condoleezza Rice, who was instru
mental in helping Lithuania join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) in 2004 as Former President
Bush's National Security Advisor.
The lecture by Prime Minister
Kubilius, given in Professor Eric
Bettinger's Economics of Higher
Education class, emphasized infra
structure, innovation and higher edu
cation in Lithuania and how those fac
tors translate into economic competi

tiveness for the former Soviet
Republic. Kubilius praised Stanford as
the "best university in the world" and
urged the Graduate School of
Business students present to "watch
the Nordic-Baltic region," especially
Lithuania, for signs of rapid develop
ment in the coming years.
"What we are looking for is target
ed towards business development
goals in building Lithuania's long
term strategy for the next 10 years,"
Kubilius said in an interview with The
Daily after his lecture.
"I look forward to seeing how we
can develop Nordic-Baltic country
specific specialization on develop
ment of a high tech service hub," he
continued. "I just met with [the exec
utives of] Oracle, HP, Cisco. It is a very
good beginning, and we shall contin
ue. I hope those companies will see an
attraction in Lithuania."
He noted that he chose the GSB as
one of his stops in his visit to the
United States in part to see how deep
reforms in Lithuania's university sys
tem in making them more high tech
could be modeled after Silicon Valley.

The Prime Minister noted his
country's prime location at the center
of Europe and at the intersection of
Eastern Europe, the Baltic region and
the European Union (EU), of which
it became a member in 2004.
Membership in the EU has brought
Lithuania "economic assistance" and
the "the ability to be part of the huge
European market," Kubilius said.
Kubilius highlighted extensively
the economic growth and potential of
Lithuania. Before the 2008-2009 glob
al recession, Lithuania's economy had
one of the highest growth rates in the
EU, fueled by its innovation and inter
est in laser technology, medicine,
information technology, biotechnolo
gy, nanotechnology and materials sci
ence.

Nevertheless, the recent global
economic downturn has seriously
affected the Lithuanian economy.
Before the economic crisis, 60 percent
of Lithuania's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) was export-related,
and as a result, the country suffered
when other major economies and
trading partners were hit by recession.

Kubilius, however, remains confi
dent. "We are recovering," the Prime
Minister said. "When markets come
up [again] ... of course we shall
recover also."

To speed up his country's recovery
and strengthen its economy to weath
er another financial crisis, Kubilius
emphasized an aggressive attempt to
lure foreign investors to Lithuania.
Central to that effort is underscoring
the country's qualities, along with its
advantages as a strong hub of technol
ogy and investments.
While conceding that the country's
higher education system has "much to
improve," Kubilius stated it provides a
solid foundation for the knowledge

based economy that Lithuania is striv
ing to build. Moreover, 90 percent of
Lithuanians speak at least one foreign
language, usually English or Russian.

The Prime Minister went on to list
a series of noteworthy statistics of
Lithuania's development of necessary
infrastructure for a knowledge-based
economy and leadership in the
Internet and mobile communications
industries. Lithuania ranks first in the
