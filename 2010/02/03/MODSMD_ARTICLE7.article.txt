### 

WYATT ROY/The Stanford Daily
An emergency medical team from Stanford comprised of three doctors and five nurses return on Sunday from
helping victims of the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12. The Stanford team spent two
weeks working nearly non-stop on patients, sweating out 18 hour days of treating the effects of the disaster. The
team estimates that they treated thousands of patients, but regrettably were not able to help everyone that
approached them. Relief efforts on campus continue as the doctors and nurses return to their normal lives.
