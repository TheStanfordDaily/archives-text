## Stanford's Web site ranked second 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
Stanford's Web site is the second
most popular university site world
wide, a site ranking organization
said last week.

4icu.org, an organization that
ranks universities according to the
popularity of their Web sites, said
last week that Stanford trails only
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology among some 200 uni
versities in its 2010 ranking.
The group draws its data from

Google Page Rank, Yahoo! Inbound
Links and Alexa Traffic Rank.

Rounding out the top five were
Harvard, Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico and UC-
Berkeley.
"We do not by any means
claim to rank organisations, or their
programs, by the quality of educa
tion or level of services provided,"
the group said on its Web site.
