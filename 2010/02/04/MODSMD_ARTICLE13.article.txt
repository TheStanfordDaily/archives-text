## EDITORIAL High-speed rail a worthy cause 
### 
In November 2008, California voters ap
proved a $9.9 billion bond measure called
Proposition 1 A, which gave the state gov
ernment the approval to begin constructing a
high-speed rail line to connect cities in Cali
fornia from Sacramento to San Diego. An
update to the budget for this project now
puts the ultimate cost of this rail at over $42.6
billion a more than 25-percent increase
from what was projected in Prop IA. As a re
sult of these cost increases, a one-way ticket
from Los Angeles to San Francisco is expect
ed to cost $lO5, nearly double the projection
under Prop lA.The higher costs are expect
ed to decrease ridership by over 30 percent,
and has many Californians crying that the
proposed plan is not what they voted for.
The Editorial Board is disappointed in
the many impediments to high-speed rail
and the continuously increasing price tag
that this project requires. However, at the
same time, we also give our emphatic and
sincere support in favor of California's
High-Speed Rail project. Over the course of
this volume, we plan to publish a series of
opinions on the economic benefits, environ
mental impact and political obstacles of
high-speed rail projects, both in the state and
nationally.
Anyone who has ever taken a regional
train within the United States can attest to
the incredible inefficiency of the system.
Slow speeds, notorious delays and relatively
expensive ticket prices have become the
hallmarks of railway travel in the U.S. While
Japan and France were beginning to build
their high-speed rail systems as early as the
1960s and '7os, the U.S. chose to focus on its
then-thriving automobile and aviation in
dustries, convinced that the future to travel
was in the sky and on the highway. At that
time, Americans had been convinced that
developing its interstate highway system was
the key to mastering travel within this ex
pansive country. Today, with the crumbling
American auto industry, increasingly intense
airport security measures and the nation's

tremendous dependence on foreign oil, au
tomobile and air travel have become expen
sive, lengthy and environmentally harmful.
America's current lack of high-speed rail
ways is one of the many reasons that The
American Society of Civil Engineers' Infra
structure Report Card for 2009 gives the U.S.
a grade of 'D' on transit. As countries like
China invest hundreds of billions of dollars
in high-speed rail, the United States should
be worried that other countries that have al
ready been heavily investing in high-speed
rail will soon leave us in their dust, both
metaphorically and literally.
When the federal government announced
last month that it would be providing $2.3 bil
lion of funds from the Recovery Act, sup
porters of the rail rejoiced not simply be
cause there were more funds for this project,
but because these funds came with the stipu
lation that the rail must be started by 2012
and completed by 2017. This mandate simul
taneously addressed the two greatest imped
iments to the project thus far: money and ur
gency. Some expect ground breaking as early
as 2011. The Obama administration has
called this investment in developing high
speed corridors around the country the
greatest investment in domestic infrastruc
ture since President Eisenhower champi
oned the Interstate highway system. The ad
ministration has assured the populations
within these proposed corridors that this sum
is simply an initial investment and that the
government intends to provide much more
funding in the coming years, which when cou
pled with state and private investment will
meet the high costs of this project.

The Editorial Board believes that it is in
this country's best interest to complete the
proposed high-speed rail projects as soon as
possible, and to focus greater resources to
ward railway development in the future. By
bringing affordable high-speed rail options
to communities across America, these devel
opments will at once facilitate the mobility
and interconnectedness of all Americans.
