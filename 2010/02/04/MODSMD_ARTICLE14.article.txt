# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## The 						Busyness Epidemic 
### Danny Crichton 
We Stanford students are so overcome
with the Busyness, I wonder how we
get anything done at all.

It is an epidemic, far more insidious than
the piglet flu. Once one person is infected, the
entire social network around that person
seems to come down with the same strain.
Looking at population infection rates, the
Busyness takes a few weeks to reach critical
mass, generally about four to five weeks into a
quarter. Once it strikes, social lives are
crushed, tensions rise and Facebook encoun
ters increased Web traffic (this one did not
make any sense, but the Busyness strikes in
odd ways).
The sad part is I am apparently infected
with it. So are you. The Busyness seems to
have grown particularly virulent this year. The
economic shocks of the past year have low
ered immunity levels, and there is no vaccine
in the works. Even Vaden may not be able to
stop this latest affliction.
I am providing this information as a public
service announcement. They (third-person
conspiratorially plural) do not want you to
know about it. Imagine the fear and panic that
would sweep through the student body if stu
dents knew that a terrible scourge was being
transmitting. I thought long and hard about
the consequences of revealing this informa
tion, but the Busyness itself pretty much pre
vents any sort of panic from transpiring. Peo
ple are just too busy to respond to the Busy
ness.

The most important element in reducing
infection rates of the Busyness is identifying
possible carriers. My admittedly anecdotal re
search indicates that one of the most correlat
ed factors is location. Where does a person
spend the bulk of their time? The Busyness is
particularly virulent in places near engineer
ing and science buildings. In fact, it seems that
people who frequent these places are suscep
tible to a particularly dangerous side effect of
the disease known as PSS Problem Set
Shock. Our only defense against PSS appears
to be coffee, but thanks to an oversight by the
Obama Administration, the only dispensary
near Green remains shut down.

Just because a potential carrier is not visit
ing these dens of horror does not mean that
they cannot contract the Busyness. My evi
dence shows that students can be given a nu
merical score between 12 and 20 on how like
ly they are to receive the disease. That score
roughly correlates with the number of units a
person is taking. Perhaps being in more class
es raises the number of potential interactions
among carriers. It is difficult to speculate. It
appears the number of extracurriculars is also
similarly correlated.
Finally, there are physical manifestations
of the pathogen. The Busyness seems to cause

a decline in the mental faculties, causing an in
ability to weigh two options intelligently. This
leads to Busy people who choose to continue
working on an essay instead of taking a show
er. It leads them to read another journal arti
cle instead of washing their clothes. The smell
from people with the Busyness is often the
first indication that the person has become in
fected.

Time is truly running out if we are to save
the student body. There are no panaceas, only
natural remedies that appear to improve the
condition (warning: none of these are FDA
approved). My first recommendation is to
take fewer units. The virus' correlation with
heavy courseloads indicates one possible in
fection vector. Also helpful if those units are
not near engineering and science buildings,
but one can only do so much. Cutting ex
tracurriculars also appears to aid in fighting
the disease.

Another possibility is to take a relaxation
moment during the day. It seems that looking
at a plant for a couple of minutes or striking up
a new conversation seems to keep the
pathogen at bay. The lower heart rates associ
ated with such an activity may make Stanford
students nervous, but do not worry, the lower
blood pressure leads to a smaller risk of con
tracting Busyness. Sleeping a minimum of
seven hours, or sleeping at all, also increases
the human body's resilience.

Also, do not use the name of the disease in
everyday communication. When discussing
why you did not show up for the
lecture/party/performance, do not blame the
Busyness. It seems to feed on that. Instead,
provide a legitimate excuse that ignores the
underlying affliction.
The Busyness strikes at the very heart of
our institution and is leaving few students un
scathed. Its virulence unrivaled by past resur
gences, it is important that every member of
our community remain vigilant to the out
break. Beware smelly roommates, worka
holics and the west academic buildings. With
more attention and alertness, we should be
able to turn the tide against the greatest pub
lic health threat of our time.
