# ALTERNATIVE LIVING...WITHOUT THE NAKED
## A
						New Kind of Christmas 
### Samantha Toh 
I know it's February, but I'm writing from
Paris. Here, the snow is coming down in
sheets and streets are lighted like a cele
bration. I bought a barrel of cider and am
tucked up in three blankets, sipping from a
mug the size of my face. I'm wearing a tacky
green and red sweater. My host family's din
ing room still smells like pine. And so I
thought of Christmas again.
I grew up not celebrating Christmas.
Jesus' birth was cool, my parents thought, but
the whole tree, lights and second-guessing
every Christmas gift was just too much of a
hassle and not enough of a meaningful one. It
didn't help that I lived in a tropical country.
Stepping outdoors, Christmas morning hard
ly meant pearly snowflakes and crooning
reindeer, but rather, a feeling that I had just
been barbecued by the hellish flames of the
anti-Christ.

My first American Christmas experience
was, to say the least, a little shocking. Some
two years ago, I witnessed an over-caffeinat
ed old man in a Santa fat suit grapple with a
screaming child while his parents snapped
photograph after photograph. That first
Christmas, I beat my way through crowded
shopping malls, wrestled with giant hams, and
with all my pre-Christmas spirit, read my
friends' and acquaintances' wishlists involv
ing TVs, iPods and the newest line of Marc Ja
cobs sunglasses. Christmas had turned from a
quiet, secular dinner with my family to a
high-energy event involving old ladies hand
bagging one another trying to get the last
coveted toy for their beloved grandchild.
The thing was, I bought into it. On some
level, this energy was to me what America
was: a constant longing for bigger, better and

more, away of defining and then achieving
progress. It's not a kind of Christmas spirit to
disagree with altogether.
Things did change for me, however, this
past Christmas. In a small town in Northern
Arizona, far away from malls, fast cars and
any kind of bling, I finished a bite of some pie
I had made that morning, steaming and fresh
out of the microwave, a dollop of vanilla ice
cream melting on top. I looked out of the
window, prepared to enter a deep, grotesque
ly unconscious food coma.

It was then that I realized that it was snow
ing. Little flakes of it were illuminated only
by a streetlamp in the cold, and tucked up in

a fuzzy blanket, with a cup of tea in hand, I
felt a stupid, romantic feeling deep in the pit
of my stomach, and it was a surprisingly fuzzy
one.

I don't suppose revelations always come
like a sledgehammer, but this one did. I did
not need TVs, iPods or even the newest line
of Marc Jacobs sunglasses. It was nice being
in a place far away from the hectic expecta
tions of a commercialized Christmas. Christ
mas with money and bling would have been
nice, but to a large extent, I didn't really know
if that was what I wanted or if that was what
I was simply expected to want. And though
bigger, better and more would have been a
form of progress, there was more to Christ
mas Day or any day than that.
That led to my eventual revelation that I
can live the simplest life and still be happy.
Now, whenever tempted to shop like an ad
dict, I try to ask myself why I need these
things. While at first an awful experience
(Why should I not, I reasoned, have the exact
same tank top in 12 different colors?), I have
come to realize that there is a huge difference
between wanting something and needing
something.
Certainly, my situation has been compli
cated by being in Paris, where sales are amaz
ing and the temptation burns, sometime
more intensely than being handbagged in the
face by an old lady vying for that last coveted
toy. But I'm just over a month into absti
nence, and it's slowly getting easier. A full
month after New Year's, someone across the
Atlantic is still keeping her big resolution.
