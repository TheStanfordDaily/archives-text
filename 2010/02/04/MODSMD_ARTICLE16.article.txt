## A 						Provost's Pride 
### – By John Etchemendy, Provost 
I attended the counter demonstration last
Friday morning at Hillel, along with hun
dreds of other faculty, staff and students,
when the Westboro Baptist Church brought
its unfortunate message of hate to campus.
Through this opinion piece, I want to say
how proud I am of the way the campus react
ed. I also want to explain why the University
agreed to allow people with such an abhor
rent message to demonstrate on campus
and why we would do it again.
First the pride. There was a powerful feel
ing of goodwill and community among those
who turned out Friday morning to meet the
Westboro demonstrators. We all felt it, and
who knows, perhaps the Westboro folks
sensed it as well. In an odd way, it turned out
to be a wonderful, reaffirming event pre
cisely the opposite of what our unwanted
guests intended.
Unity among Stanford's diverse popula
tion was clearly not what they had hoped to
achieve. Instead, their intent wherever
they travel —is to encourage divisiveness
and the diminishment of groups ranging from
gays to Jews to members of the armed servic
es. It is an odd form of equal opportunity non
sense.

Obviously, they utterly failed at Stanford.
For instance, they probably didn't expect that
our Islamic students would send out fliers
asking members to show solidarity with Hil
lel. But such responses come as no surprise to
me as a member of the Stanford community
for nearly 30 years.
In my experience, people at Stanford
value diversity as one of the University's
greatest strengths. We embrace it in our re
search, teaching and learning. We exemplify it
in the way we work and live. We collectively
acknowledge a responsibility to set the stan
dard for how diversity can enhance an educa
tional community. In a diverse community,
people learn to understand one another and
resolve their differences, rather than letting
them fester. In a diverse community, scholars
and students contribute diverse insights and,

in so doing, push the forefront of knowledge
further.

But why didn't we choose to exclude the
Westboro demonstrators from campus?
Make no mistake: we could have prohibited
the demonstrators from coming onto the
Stanford campus. This is, after all, a private
university, and Stanford's rights are no differ
ent from any other private landholder.
But this is, first and foremost, a university.
And a university stands for nothing if not a
place where divergent beliefs true or false,
agreeable or distasteful can be aired.
Still, aren't there limits to what should be
allowed? Before Friday's event, we received
many requests from members of the commu
nity to prohibit the Westboro group from
demonstrating on campus. Their bizarre col
lection of beliefs hardly merits serious consid
eration. So many understandably felt we
should draw a line between legitimate points
of view that are perhaps false, and views so
abhorrent they should not even be allowed
expression.
The problem is that once we draw this line,

the University takes on a role it should not
have. The line between legitimate positions
and objectionable beliefs falls in very differ
ent places for different people, even quite
reasonable people. I regularly receive re
quests not to allow a person or group to speak
on campus people and groups who are
positively mainstream in comparison to the
Westboro cult. But once we go down the road
of silencing, rather than refuting, those whose
beliefs we consider objectionable, we stray
from one of the core values that defines the
University.
In the end, the demonstration by the West
boro Baptist Church provided us with the op
portunity to learn that our values are strong
as a university and as a community. We know
we stand for mutual respect and freedom of
speech. We learned that we are more power
ful in the face of hate, not less.
We did the right thing, and I couldn't be
prouder of the Stanford community.
