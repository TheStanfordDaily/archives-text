### HALEY MURPHY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the Cardinal heads "On the Road Again"
this weekend, this time to Los Angeles, it is hard
to believe anyone is as excited as Willie Nelson
was to get away.The twang of Nelson's voice has
never been as brutal as it is for Stanford basket
ball fans this season except perhaps for Stan
ford football fans in 2006, although even those
fans got a road win at Washington.
But, there's reason to hope: with half of con
ference play behind it already, Stanford (10-11,
4-5 Pac-10) is not down and out. Being 4-5 in the
Pac-10 this season is trendier than sorority girls
in leggings, and half the conference currently sits
with that record. UCLA (10-11,5-4) shares the
Card's overall record in case you couldn't
read that yourself and is just a game away in
the Pac-10 standings.
When the teams last met in Maples on Jan. 9,
Stanford beat up the Bruins 70-59, thanks to a
career-high 30 points from sophomore guard Je
remy Green. In usual fashion, senior forward
Landry Fields also posted 16 points, seven re
bounds and three steals.
Either Fields or Green has led the Cardinal
in scoring in every contest this season, and Fields
usually also manages to be the top rebounder. It
is no surprise, then, that head coach Johnny
Dawkins sang their praises, despite disappoint
ing losses at Arizona and Arizona State last
weekend.

"Landry Fields and Jeremy Green have been
terrific," he said. "Those kids are put in a posi
tion where they have to create offense for us to
have a chance, and to their credit, they've shoul
dered that responsibility."
Dawkins, though, acknowledged that for as
good as the duo is, their production is not strict
ly a positive for the team, citing the team's "de
pendency on them" as a weakness.
However, UCLA does not quite boast a
killer combination to match up with Fields and
Green but that does not mean the top few
Bruins are incapable of holding Stanford off.
UCLA's leading scorer, senior guard
Michael Roll, is averaging just 13 points per
game, good for a 12th-place tie among confer
ence scorers. But fellow guard, sophomore Mal
colm Lee, and junior forward Nikola Dragovic
are close behind, averaging another 12.7 and
11.5, respectively. Freshman Reeves Nelson av
erages 11 points and six rebounds per game,
UCLA also struggles at the line more than

any other Pac-10 team, shooting only 61.8 per
cent. Despite great guard play, the Bruins also
have no eye for the long ball, hitting only 33.7
percent of shots behind the arc.
Overall, the matchup is one that the Cardinal
can handle and has successfully once this sea
son. But without another big night from Green,
or someone else, things will be tighter.

There is also another reason to doubt: Stan
ford has not won on the road. Period. Unless you
count a win over the University of Virginia in
Cancun at Thanksgiving, and even in that meet
ing Stanford was technically the home team.
Most recently, the Cardinal fell apart at the Ari
zona schools to the point that in Thursday's
meeting with the Wildcats, 31 points by Fields
and 25 more by Green couldn't save the team,
nor (shockingly) could a cameo by senior and
Sun Bowl quarterback Tavita Pritchard on Sat
urday against the Sun Devils.
Given its record as visitors, an off night for
the Fields-Green dream team would spell al
most certain death for Stanford, especially since
the team as a whole is currently the league's
worst shooting team at only 43.7 percent.
Dawkins also says that the Card is not where he
would like it defensively.
"We need to continue to improve ... defen
sively; we need to shore that up," he said. "I think
when you look at our wins and losses games
that we've been very competitive and games
that we've won we've defended very well.

And that's something that we need to continue
to embrace and continue to work on."
Despite the flaws of the season's first half,
nothing is impossible, especially for a roster that
contains two of the conference's top five players
in a league of borderline disarray. While
Dawkins called conference play "competitive,"
Stanford fans call it a shot.
"I think it's very competitive," he said. "The
conference is terrific in regard to the balance
that it has, and we have an opportunity to con

tinue to improve. We've faced everyone now
once, we've realized we can compete against all
the teams in the league, and now we have to go
out there and try to get some more wins."
Try they will, and it all starts tonight in Pauley
Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. The Cardinal will head
cross-town to meet USC at 4:30 p.m. on Satur
day.

dered that responsibility."
Dawkins, though, acknowledged that for as
good as the duo is, their production is not strict
ly a positive for the team, citing the team's "de
pendency on them" as a weakness.
However, UCLA does not quite boast a
killer combination to match up with Fields and
Green but that does not mean the top few
Bruins are incapable of holding Stanford off.
UCLA's leading scorer, senior guard
Michael Roll, is averaging just 13 points per
game, good for a 12th-place tie among confer
ence scorers. But fellow guard, sophomore Mal
colm Lee, and junior forward Nikola Dragovic
are close behind, averaging another 12.7 and
11.5, respectively. Freshman Reeves Nelson av
erages 11 points and six rebounds per game,
UCLA also struggles at the line more than

any other Pac-10 team, shooting only 61.8 per
cent. Despite great guard play, the Bruins also
have no eye for the long ball, hitting only 33.7
percent of shots behind the arc.
Overall, the matchup is one that the Cardinal
can handle and has successfully once this sea
son. But without another big night from Green,
or someone else, things will be tighter.

There is also another reason to doubt: Stan
ford has not won on the road. Period. Unless you
count a win over the University of Virginia in
Cancun at Thanksgiving, and even in that meet
ing Stanford was technically the home team.
Most recently, the Cardinal fell apart at the Ari
zona schools to the point that in Thursday's
meeting with the Wildcats, 31 points by Fields
and 25 more by Green couldn't save the team,
nor (shockingly) could a cameo by senior and
Sun Bowl quarterback Tavita Pritchard on Sat
urday against the Sun Devils.
Given its record as visitors, an off night for
the Fields-Green dream team would spell al
most certain death for Stanford, especially since
the team as a whole is currently the league's
worst shooting team at only 43.7 percent.
Dawkins also says that the Card is not where he
would like it defensively.
"We need to continue to improve ... defen
sively; we need to shore that up," he said. "I think
when you look at our wins and losses games
that we've been very competitive and games
that we've won we've defended very well.

And that's something that we need to continue
to embrace and continue to work on."
Despite the flaws of the season's first half,
nothing is impossible, especially for a roster that
contains two of the conference's top five players
in a league of borderline disarray. While
Dawkins called conference play "competitive,"
Stanford fans call it a shot.
"I think it's very competitive," he said. "The
conference is terrific in regard to the balance
that it has, and we have an opportunity to con

tinue to improve. We've faced everyone now
once, we've realized we can compete against all
the teams in the league, and now we have to go
out there and try to get some more wins."
Try they will, and it all starts tonight in Pauley
Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. The Cardinal will head
cross-town to meet USC at 4:30 p.m. on Satur
day.

GAME NOTES ! Stanford will be searching for its first road win of the
season when it takes on UCLA at Pauley Pavilion. Both the Cardi
nal and the Bruins have been having disappointing seasons by
their programs' standards, yet both are still in contention in the
mediocre Pac-10. Stanford defeated UCLA 70-59 last month at
Maples Pavilion.



SCOTT STUK/The State Press
Junior guard Da'Veed Dildy and the rest of the Stanford men's basketball team have struggled on the
road this season. Sophomore guard Jeremy Green has been one of the go-to players for the Cardinal.
