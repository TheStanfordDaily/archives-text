# CARD TRIES TO FEND OFF BRUINS
## 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The second half of the Pac-10 season starts
at Maples Pavilion tonight, with a 7 p.m. tipoff
between the Cardinal and the Bruins.

Undefeated at home all season, No. 2 Stan
ford (19-1,9-0 Pac-10) will play host to its clos
est challengers this week, as UCLA (14-6,7-2)
and USC (13-7,7-2), the Cardinal's opponent
on Sunday, are tied for second in the confer
ence.

Apart from unanimous No. 1 UConn,
UCLA is the team that has played Stanford
closest all year, losing out in Los Angeles by
just four points. Even with home advantage
on the side of the nation's second best team, it
should be a challenging game.
UCLA swept the Oregon schools at home
last week, beating the Cardinal's 100-80 win
over Oregon with a 104-80 mark, and fresh
man forward Markel Walker claimed the Pac
10's current Player of the Week award, having
posted back-to-back double-doubles in those
contests.

The Bruins will be hoping to repeat the
form they showed in the second half of the
game in L.A., coming back from a 16-point
deficit to challenge Stanford right until the
final seconds.
"If we don't come out and if we're not
playing aggressively, they're a very explosive
team so they can kind of get hot," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer, "and [in
L. A.] we didn't go over some screens and they
hit some shots on us."
"They're a very aggressive team they're

a team that presses and traps, and they're a
very good shooting team," she continued. "So
they're not big inside, but they're very aggres
sive and they're very physical."
This style of play, especially on defense,
should differ from the style exhibited by Ari
zona last Saturday, where Stanford's two
starting guards were able to score just one
three-pointer between them. In contrast, red
shirt senior guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude col
lected a then-career record haul of 18 points
(since bettered with 19 against Arizona State)
in the first matchup between the Cardinal and
the Bruins.

"I definitely think that certain games suit
certain players better," Gold-Onwude said. "I
think a game like UCLA brings out the best,
because they're all up on you, they're pressur
ing, so you have the opportunity to come hard
off of screens, curl, drive and then also knock
down a three if you're wide open."
Having secured its 40th consecutive home
victory against Arizona, the Cardinal enters
Thursday's matchup on a six-game streak
against the Bruins. And with a commanding
44-22 all-time record, the team knows what it
needs to do to win.

"We have to play our game, which is get
ting touches and looks for Nneka [Ogwu
mike] and Jayne [Appel] and Kayla [Peder
sen] and Joslyn [Tinkle]," VanDerveer said.
"And then our perimeter people working re
ally hard defensively, getting some steals, get
ting out and running better. And we have to
do a great job on the boards... and then just

been the closest Pac-10 competitor to the Cardinal,
losing by only four to Stanford in Los Angeles.
really knocking down shots.
"But beyond that,it's letting the of
fense come to you, not pressing, not
forcing things, being patient and let
ting the offense come to you," she
said.
However, this game and the
final eight that follow it in the confer
ence comes at a difficult time for
the team.
Key players have either been kept
out of action or had their minutes re
stricted in important games recently,
and, as if to rub salt into the wound, it
seems the problems are contagious.
Gold-Onwude injured herself in prac
tice this week, while junior forward
Kayla Pedersen tweaked her ankle.
Senior forward Jayne Appel, nomi
nated yesterday as a finalist for the
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award, has
been unable to train due to a swollen
foot, and sophomore guard Grace
Mashore has also been sidelined.
Whether or not other players can
step up to fill in for their injured team
mates will be a crucial test for the
team if it hopes to take both the Pac
-10 and NCAA crowns at the end of
the year.
However, though the biggest ob
stacle to achieving that dream of a na
tional title will be UConn the only
team that has beaten the Cardinal in
the last 12 months the season is
more than just a single game.
"We definitely always remember
that we've lost to UConn," Pedersen
said. "That gives us a lot of motiva
tion. But we don't really look at it like
we're undefeated in the Pac-10 we
just keep each game, like, game by
game. USC just lost to Oregon, so
things like that can happen, and we
don't want any team to sneak up on us
like that."
It has been a great first half of the
season for Stanford, but nothing is yet
decided. The Cardinal tips off against
UCLA tonight at 7 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.
