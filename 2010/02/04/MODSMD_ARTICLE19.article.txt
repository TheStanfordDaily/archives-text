## Gymnasts try out for senior national team 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford men's gymnastics travels toward
the bright lights and extravagant opulence of
Las Vegas, Nev. this weekend for the 2010 Win
ter Cup Challenge. This meet, unlike other
meets, is not a challenge between the No. 3 Car

team members, the two are hoping to hold on to
their positions. So far this season, Buscaglia has
performed brilliantly on floor exercise and
vault, consistently posting scores in the 15.0 to
16.0 range on both events. Gentry has been just
as spectacular on his two best events, still rings
and vault, also earning scores of 15.0 to 16.0.
Joining Buscaglia and Gentry in Vegas are
fellow juniors Josh Dixon and Lieberman. Best
