# MEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Gymnasts try out for senior national team 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford men's gymnastics travels toward
the bright lights and extravagant opulence of
Las Vegas, Nev. this weekend for the 2010 Win
ter Cup Challenge. This meet, unlike other
meets, is not a challenge between the No. 3 Car
dinal and its bitter rivals. Instead, it is a man
versus-man competition to determine who will
make the U.S. senior national team.

At this year's meet, 136 gymnasts will be on
hand to display their power, strength and sheer
will. Three of those 136 will be 2008 Olympians

Alexander Artemev, Jonathan Horton and
Kevin Tan. And of those 136, only 14 will be
considered good enough to make the elite
squad. It all comes down to two days of compe
tition â€”just 12 routines, little more than 12
minutes per gymnast.
In those 12 minutes, things can either go fan
tastically well or depressingly rough, according
to junior Ryan Lieberman.
"It's an interesting meet," he said, "because
it's so early in the season that it can go either
way."

Of the 136 men trying to find their 12 min
utes of fame, six are Stanford athletes. Return

ing to Las Vegas are juniors Alex Buscaglia and
Tim Gentry. As current U.S. senior national
team members, the two are hoping to hold on to
their positions. So far this season, Buscaglia has
performed brilliantly on floor exercise and
vault, consistently posting scores in the 15.0 to
16.0 range on both events. Gentry has been just
as spectacular on his two best events, still rings
and vault, also earning scores of 15.0 to 16.0.
Joining Buscaglia and Gentry in Vegas are
fellow juniors Josh Dixon and Lieberman. Best
known for his explosive floor routines that reg-
ularly score 15.0 and above, Dixon
hopes to wow the judges on all six
events each day. Lieberman, having
already taken the individual all
around title during Stanford's season
opener against Cal, hopes to execute
another solid performance this week
end.

"It would be one of the biggest and
most important things that has ever
happened to me," Lieberman said
about a potential national team
placement. The closest he has ever
come to achieving this goal was a
sixth place all-around finish as a high
school senior in 2006.

Also traveling to Vegas are sopho
mores Cameron Foreman and John
Martin. While Foreman hopes to im
press with the floor exercise, high bar
and parallel bars routines that have
earned him solid scores so far this sea
son, Martin hopes to prove himself on
the pommel horse, high bar and par
allel bars.

To prepare for the meet, these
men have done what they do six days
a week get in the gym and focus on
consistency and form. With so many
men and so little time in the competi
tion, these gymnasts have no choice
but to hit all 12 of their routines if they
hope to make the national team.
The Winter Cup Challenges take
place Feb. 4-6 at the Las Vegas Sports
Center.
