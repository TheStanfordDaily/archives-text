## Singapore, Biodesign join forces 
### TROY YANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's biodesign program has
partnered with Singaporean organiza
tions to create Singapore-Stanford
Biodesign (SSB), a program with the
goal of training the next generation of
medical technology innovators in
Asia.

Although the biodesign program
was founded about a decade ago, glob
al collaborative programs such as SSB
did not begin to surface until more
recently. SSB's official launch was last
Friday.
Several years ago, "President
Flennessy put out a mandate to the
University," said Christine Kurihara,
associate director of SSB. "He said we
have the intelligence and resources
here to solve the world's problems, but
we've only been focused our own
problems. He said it was time for the
University to look at the world and see
what problems there are in healthcare,
climate, and energy."
"That prompted us to start a global
program," she added.
Since then, a pilot program that ran
for six months in Mexico and the
Stanford-India Biodesign program
were created, making SSB the third
global medical innovation program
designed by Biodesign.
"What's unique about Singapore
and why we're very attracted to
Singapore is that we saw a similar pat
tern [to Stanford] of them having a
confluence of strong academic institu
tions, research institutions and also
industry," said Chris Shen, executive
director of the SSB.
Singaporean fellows selected for
this program will work in teams of
four, consisting of one clinician and
three engineers. The teams will learn
what directors call the "biodesign
process," which comprises three phas
es clinical immersion, invention and
business-plan generation.
