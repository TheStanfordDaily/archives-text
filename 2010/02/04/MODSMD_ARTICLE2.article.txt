## Singapore, Biodesign join forces 
### TROY YANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's biodesign program has
partnered with Singaporean organiza
tions to create Singapore-Stanford
Biodesign (SSB), a program with the
goal of training the next generation of
medical technology innovators in
Asia.

Although the biodesign program
was founded about a decade ago, glob
al collaborative programs such as SSB
did not begin to surface until more
recently. SSB's official launch was last
Friday.
Several years ago, "President
Flennessy put out a mandate to the
University," said Christine Kurihara,
associate director of SSB. "He said we
have the intelligence and resources
here to solve the world's problems, but
we've only been focused our own
problems. He said it was time for the
University to look at the world and see
what problems there are in healthcare,
climate, and energy."
"That prompted us to start a global
program," she added.
Since then, a pilot program that ran
for six months in Mexico and the
Stanford-India Biodesign program
were created, making SSB the third
global medical innovation program
designed by Biodesign.
"What's unique about Singapore
and why we're very attracted to
Singapore is that we saw a similar pat
tern [to Stanford] of them having a
confluence of strong academic institu
tions, research institutions and also
industry," said Chris Shen, executive
director of the SSB.
Singaporean fellows selected for
this program will work in teams of
four, consisting of one clinician and
three engineers. The teams will learn
what directors call the "biodesign
process," which comprises three phas
es clinical immersion, invention and
business-plan generation.

During the clinical immersion
phase, the fellows will observe the
clinical setting in order to find areas
that may benefit from improvement
in medical technologies. Eventually,
the fellows will learn to construct a
plan in order to commercialize their
product.
Jointly funded by the Singapore
Economic Development Board and

Alliance for Science Technology and
Research, this program will take place
over a period of a year. The first six
months will be spent at Stanford and
the next six in Singapore.
Directors of the program are opti
mistic about its results. A fecal inconti
nence device, an intraosseus device
and the Jaipure knee, which was
selected by CNN as one of the top 10
inventions of 2009 and by TIME
Magazine as one of the top 50 inven
tions of 2009, have all come from
Stanford's biodesign students, faculty
and fellows.

"I think we've seen our graduates

have gone on to do some pretty amaz
ing things," Shen said. "We've treated
some 25,000 patients with inventions
that have been developed by stu
dents."
While applications to the program
are currently restricted to
Singaporean nationals, there are
future prospects that the program will
eventually work both ways not
only allowing Singaporean nationals
to come to Stanford, but also sending
Stanford students to Singapore.
