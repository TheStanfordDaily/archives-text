## Cardinal has mixed success 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
While several individual athletes have shined
this season, the Stanford wrestling team has had
middling success overall. The Cardinal (8-7-1,0-
3-1 Pac-10) started the season on a strong note in
November, winning three dual meets in a row at
the Northwestern Duals in Evanston, 111. Since
then, however, the Card has been unable to
gather any momentum. Pac-10 opponents have
been especially tough coming into last week
end, Stanford had lost dual meets to No. 21 Ore
gon State and No. 16 Cal Poly.

In two conference meets last weekend at the
Ford Center, the Cardinal tried to improve on its
current record. However, it was ultimately un
successful, falling 29-15 to No. 8 Boise State (12-
2,5-0) and tying Cal State Fullerton (2-6-1,0-5-
1) with a score of 20-20.
The Boise State meet was an especially tough
loss for the Cardinal, as Stanford wrestlers were
only able to win one non-forfeited weight class.
At 165 pounds, redshirt sophomore Nick
Amuchastegui shut out Boise State's Michael
Cuthbertson for a 4-0 victory. Amuchastegui is
currently ranked No. 1 in the Pac-10 in his weight
class and has an individual record of 24-4.

"I wrestled at least a solid match,"
Amuchastegui said. "I had the opportunity to be
more offensive and score more points, so that's
definitely something to improve upon."
There was one marquee matchup for the
meet the 184-pound weight class, where red
shirt junior Zack Giesen took on Boise State's
Kirk Smith. The wrestlers entered the meet na
tionally ranked at No. 12 and No. 1, respectively.
The first period was an indication of how the rest
of the match would play out, with Smith scoring
a takedown at 1:45 and Giesen getting a critical
escape at 2:52. The second period was an even
stalemate: Giesen started on the bottom and, de
spite numerous heroic and nearly successful at
tempts, was unable to escape from Smith all pe
riod.

The third period also saw a lot of action.
Smith started on the bottom and was let up to
score a point at 0:14. At that point, the score
stood at 3-1 in favor of Boise State. The match
ended at 4-1, as Giesen was unable to get a tying
takedown and Smith got an additional point for
riding time.
"I knew it was going to be a battle going out
there," Giesen said. "It was a test for
me to see what I need to do in the
month between now and Pac-lOs."
Giesen also talked about his mind
set in the final period.
"I knew I needed a score," he said.
"I was down by two and he had riding
time, so I had to either erase that riding
time or take him down to his back. I
was looking for ways to get my offense
going and against someone like him
who's really hard to score on, it's a lit
tle bit difficult to do."
"We definitely didn't accomplish
our goals," said head coach Jason Bor
relli. "Our goal was to win the match,
but there are smaller goals too. There
were some key matches ... you want
to see Zack Giesen win that match.
"We thought we had a good game
plan," he continued. "We just didn't go
out and execute."
Two days later, the Cardinal looked
to improve its fortunes against a weak
er Cal State Fullerton team. Amuchat
segui and Giesen both delivered big
wins and there were two very close
matches, both involving Stanford
freshmen.
At the 197-pound weight class,
freshman Richard Kessler held a 5-4
lead in the final period. Wrestling from
the neutral position, he held off a last
second takedown attempt as time ex
pired to preserve the win.
At 125 pounds, freshman Ryan

Mango trailed No. 19 Andre Gonzalez
the entire match until the third period.
Down 4-3, Mango scored a takedown
and took his opponent to his back for
three more near-fall points. While
Mango was unable to secure a pin be
fore time expired, his 8-5 win still
added three critical points to the Car
dinal's team total.

However, the day ended in a tie as
Fullerton outscored Stanford by eight
team points in its last two matches
five from a technical fall over fresh
man Bret Baumbach and a 5-2 loss by
redshirt senior Tyler Parker.
"Some of the guys came back after
Friday night's performance and
showed a lot of heart and what we've
preached all year when you get
knocked down, you've got to be able
to get right back up and be ready to
go," Borrelli said. "We had a strategy
we knew that if we wrestled hard
and went out there and got after our
positions, we'd have a chance to win
the dual... We lost a lot of close
matches. Some guys [executed] and
some guys didn't."
Next week, the Cardinal will travel
to face UC-Davis (2-9,1-3). The Ag
gies also lost to Boise State over the
weekend and the dual should be
winnable for Stanford.

"Obviously, we want to come away
with a win," Borrelli said. "We'll be fa
vored in some matches and they'll be
favored in some matches. You have to
win the matches you're favored in and
you have to score some upsets."
