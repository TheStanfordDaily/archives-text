## Cardinal has mixed success 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
While several individual athletes have shined
this season, the Stanford wrestling team has had
middling success overall. The Cardinal (8-7-1,0-
3-1 Pac-10) started the season on a strong note in
November, winning three dual meets in a row at
the Northwestern Duals in Evanston, 111. Since
then, however, the Card has been unable to
gather any momentum. Pac-10 opponents have
been especially tough coming into last week
end, Stanford had lost dual meets to No. 21 Ore
gon State and No. 16 Cal Poly.

In two conference meets last weekend at the
Ford Center, the Cardinal tried to improve on its
current record. However, it was ultimately un
successful, falling 29-15 to No. 8 Boise State (12-
2,5-0) and tying Cal State Fullerton (2-6-1,0-5-
1) with a score of 20-20.
The Boise State meet was an especially tough
loss for the Cardinal, as Stanford wrestlers were
only able to win one non-forfeited weight class.
At 165 pounds, redshirt sophomore Nick
Amuchastegui shut out Boise State's Michael
Cuthbertson for a 4-0 victory. Amuchastegui is
currently ranked No. 1 in the Pac-10 in his weight
class and has an individual record of 24-4.

"I wrestled at least a solid match,"
Amuchastegui said. "I had the opportunity to be
more offensive and score more points, so that's
definitely something to improve upon."
There was one marquee matchup for the
meet the 184-pound weight class, where red
shirt junior Zack Giesen took on Boise State's
Kirk Smith. The wrestlers entered the meet na
tionally ranked at No. 12 and No. 1, respectively.
The first period was an indication of how the rest
of the match would play out, with Smith scoring
a takedown at 1:45 and Giesen getting a critical
escape at 2:52. The second period was an even
stalemate: Giesen started on the bottom and, de
spite numerous heroic and nearly successful at
tempts, was unable to escape from Smith all pe
riod.

The third period also saw a lot of action.
Smith started on the bottom and was let up to
score a point at 0:14. At that point, the score
stood at 3-1 in favor of Boise State. The match
ended at 4-1, as Giesen was unable to get a tying
takedown and Smith got an additional point for
riding time.
