# NBA age limit hurts basketball
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Have you ever been
watching college bas
ketball, and thought to
yourself, "Damn, that
guy is still playing?" I
got that feeling the other night while
watching No. 2 Villanova. Wildcats
senior guard Scottie Reynolds was on
his way to another productive game
and continued to pad his resume for
what looks like a reasonable shot at a
Player of the Year trophy. This
shouldn't have been a big deal, yet I
had to keep reminding myself that
Reynolds is only 22 and that he in fact
was not eligible to fight in World War
I.

You see, the Wildcats are an
anomaly their best player is an up
perclassman! They have what the tra
ditionalists call leadership and expe
rience, They have legitimate title
hopes and appear to actually focus on
winning. On Senior Day, Reynolds
will be honored louder than any
other Wildcat in the history of the Vil
lanova program.
Unfortunately for the majority of
Division I men's basketball pro
grams, Senior Day has been thor
oughly bastardized by the NBA's age
limit. Instead of spending an evening
honoring four-year starters and
record setters, fans are left deciding
whether or not they should applaud,
let alone stand, in commemoration of
the walk-on that is known more for
his impossible-to-pronounce Eastern
European last name than for his skill
on the hardwood (Matei, be pre
pared).
You see, college basketball just
ain't what it used to be. The NBA's
age limit, which states that a player
must be 19 years old and at least one
year removed from high school be
fore entering the draft, has flooded
the college ranks with hoards of one
and-done future NBA stars. We've
heard about these guys, the Derrick
Roses, the Kevin Durants, the
Carmelo Anthonys, and we've heard
people like me bitch about them for
years. They are incredible basketball
players; it's impossible to deny that.
What is possible, however, is to deny
them the honor of "one of the best
college players ever." If Durant
stayed four or even three years at
Texas, we could have that conversa
tion but he didn't and we can't.
Louisville head coach Rick Pitino
recently said that the NBA should
adopt an age policy similar to that of
Major League Baseball players
can enter the draft immediately fol
lowing high school, but if they opt for
college, they must stay for at least
three years. This seems so rational
and beneficial for both parties.
For one, college basketball would
finally be able to regain some of the
consistency it once had. I guess you
could provide a counterargument
that this is one of the beauties of the
game we grow with the kids, fall in
love with them and then wish them
well in their future endeavors. This is
great, but since the age limit was insti
tuted, players abandon teams more
frequently than Mel Gibson aban
dons sobriety. The freshman phe
noms are incredibly fun to watch, but
we often forget that they are still very,
very raw basketball players. A
Kansas vs. Kentucky championship
game this year would be intriguing,
but nowhere near what a Final Four
with Durant, Beasley and Rose
would have been.

On the flipside, the NBA would be
unaffected by this rule change. If high
school kids want to jump to the NBA,
they can. We won't have to wait for
the next Le√üron to put in three years
at school, and Kansas State won't be
come a one-year powerhouse. For the
players that do decide to enter
school, they will be able to enter the
Association with three years of expe
rience, weight training and maturity.
All three are incredibly invaluable,
and we see the consequences of col
lege basketball deprivation on a
nightly basis in the NBA. Oh, and
three years of college education
be it ballroom dancing at USC or
MS&E at Stanford can't hurt ei
ther.

The age policy has just completely
changed the nature of the college
game. Kentucky freshman John Wall,
dubbed the unanimous No. 1 pick in
the 2010 NBA Draft, is already com
