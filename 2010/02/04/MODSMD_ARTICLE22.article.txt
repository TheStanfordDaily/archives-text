# BACK IN ACTION
## Golfers take on stacked field at Mauna Lani Invitational 
### ROXIE DICKINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Spring has sprung early for the No. 2 Stanford
men's golf team, which kicked off its season yester
day at the Mauna Lani Invitational hosted by Uni
versity of Hawaii-Manoa and UH-Hilo.
Of the 22 teams invited to the tournament, the
Cardinal is one of the 10 top-25 teams in the coun
try, including No.l Oklahoma, No. 4 TCU, N0.7 Ari
zona State, No. 8 Washington, No. 13 UCLA, No. 15
Texas, No. 16 USC, No. 17 Oregon State and No. 19
Texas Tech.

Regardless of the competition, Stanford is stay
ing focused on the NCAA crown with high hopes
for both this tournament and the rest of the season.

"We are excited to get over to the Big Island and
compete in a very strong field," head coach Conrad
Ray told GoStanford.com. "We have worked hard
in the off season and [we are] looking forward to
seeing that work pay off. The team is approaching
the event as the beginning of a whole new season,
and getting off to a good start will be important."
Clearly, the Cardinal's elbow grease both during
fall and over the break did not go unnoticed. Stan

ford began the season boasting the No. 9 golfer in
the nation, junior Sihwan Kim, and claimed the run
ner-up spot to Oklahoma. During the fall, the Car
dinal posted four top-four performances, with two
second places finishes leading up to its final tourna
ment win before break. After a pair of second-place
individual rankings in both of his last tournaments,
Kim is due for a win this spring.
Despite the hype, Stanford stacked up in fifth
place overall after yesterday's first round. No. 29
Oregon and UCLA are currently tied for first fol
lowed by Oklahoma State, Washington and USC to
make the top five. Junior Niles Floren of Texas Tech,
ranked N0.7 in the nation, holds first place going
into today's second round.

For Stanford, senior Jordan Cox and Kim are
leading the team at even par and are in a tie for 11th
in the individual ladder. Just four strokes separate
first place and 10th place, which shows that this
tournament is one of the toughest the Cardinal will
play this season.

junior Steve Ziegler, ranked No. 53, closed out
the day with a two-over-par in a tie for 30th place.
Ziegler grabbed three birdies, but they were not
enough to launch him back toward the top 10. Just
one stroke behind Ziegler is freshman Andrew Yun
in a tie for 40th. Yun also had a tough day on the
course, but managed to eagle the 15th hole. The
Cardinal hopes he will continue this good perform
ance in today's rounds.

Rounding out the Cardinal five is sophomore,

David Chung, ranked No. 23, in a tie for 64th with a
five-over-par for the day. Chung was really tripped
up by the back nine, but if his fall season perform
ance is any indication, he will bounce back during
today's rounds in sunny Hawaii.
