# Study: endowment hit harder than average
## 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
A study by the National Association of
College and University Business Officers
(NACUBO) and the Commonfund indicates
that Stanford's endowment took a significantly
greater hit than the national average in fiscal
year 2009. The University endowment was val
ued at $12.6 billion, a 27-percent decline from
the previous fiscal year.
NACUBO and Commonfund collected sta
tistics from 842 American institutions of higher
learning to produce their annual endowments
study. According to the groups' research,
endowments experienced an average reduction

of 18.7 percent in fiscal year 2009, which began
July 1,2008 and ended June 30,2009.
Stanford's investment portfolio was widely
diversified in previous years, said John Powers,
president and CEO of the Stanford
Management Company (SMC). SMC handles
the Merged Pool, the University's main invest
ment tool, and is in charge of the payout policy.
While the report revealed that many
endowment managers relied on alternative
investments that performed poorly last year,
including private equity, hedge funds, and ven
ture capital, according to Powers they were not
to blame for the endowment loss.
"The alternatives in general outperformed
the more conventional investments," Powers

said. "So, it's actually not the case that it was the
alternatives that created huge difficulties for
us."
Elaborating on this point, Powers said that
the decline in asset values was challenging
because SMC needed to make payouts to the
University for operating purposes while also
funding capital calls from the University's
investment partners.
"We didn't have enough liquidity and free
dom to be flexible in response to the market
conditions that we wanted," Powers said.
"Managing the liquid resources and improving
the level of liquid resources of the portfolio was
the biggest challenge,"
Powers noted that the market's strong

recovery in calendar 2009 was a saving grace.
Although he could not disclose exact figures,
Powers asserted that "the endowment is in bet
ter shape" at the moment than it was in fiscal
2009.
Furthermore, recent business reports have
indicated that Stanford is leading the pack
when it comes to fundraising money from pri
vate donors. The University beat out other col
leges and universities for the top spot for the
fourth consecutive year.
But Stanford's fundraising efforts were not
immune to the recession; the amount of
fundraised money dropped to $640.1 million in
FY2009 from $785 million in FY2OOB,
representing an 18.7-percent decline.
In comparison. Harvard took second
place and raked in little over $6Ol
million, a 7.5-percent drop from the
previous fiscal year.
Across the nation, university
expenditures are on the rise, increas
ing funding needs. The NACUBO-
Commonfund study found that 43
percent of institutions increased their
spending rate in FY2009. On average,
universities spent 4.4 percent of their
endowment assets, up by a slim 0.1
percent margin from the previous fis
cal year.
In comparison, Stanford's total
expenditures grew by approximately
one percent. The endowment payout
was $959 million, equal to 5.57 per
cent of the endowment value at the
beginning of FY2OII, Etchemendy
said.
Cost-cutting measures, however,
are in place on the Farm. The admin
istration began to make significant
budget cuts in FY2009, while the
majority of cuts will come into full
effect this year.
For Stanford and its peer institu
tions, there is no recourse but to
weather the storm and continue to
rely on the endowment, while reduc
ing strain on its resources. According
to Randy Livingston, Stanford's CFO

and vice president for business
affairs, the University reduced the
payout on individual funds by 10 per
cent for the current fiscal year, with
an anticipated 15 percent reduction
in FY2OII.
"We have made a number of
changes to our internal financial
structure to help buffer against rev
enue shocks of the sort we experi
enced last year," Etchemendy said.
"But ultimately, as long as we are
reliant on endowment income, we
will continue to be subject to sharp
changes in the investment climate."
Tuition, the most steady source of
revenue, does not generate enough
money to support all academic,
research and residential needs.
"To become less reliant on
endowment income, we would either
have to radically decrease the quality
of the education we offer... or radi
cally increase tuition," Etchemendy

asserted. "I don't think our students
or their parents would want us to do
either of these."

Indeed, barring the events of 2008
and 2009, the endowment model has
proven to be robust. Powers noted
that last year's financial performance
was an anomaly.
"Fiscal year 2009 was literally an
80-year flood because it hasn't been
that bad since the period of the
Depression," Powers said. "But nev
ertheless it creates a great laboratory
to say, 'Do we like the way our port
folio performs under all conditions,
including the most extreme condi
tions?"'

"We wouldn't be being responsi
ble unless we were willing to look at
our practices and ask ourselves what
we could do better," Powers added.
