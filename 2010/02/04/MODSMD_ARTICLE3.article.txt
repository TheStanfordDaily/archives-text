# Study: endowment hit harder than average

### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
A study by the National Association of
College and University Business Officers
(NACUBO) and the Commonfund indicates
that Stanford's endowment took a significantly
greater hit than the national average in fiscal
year 2009. The University endowment was val
ued at $12.6 billion, a 27-percent decline from
the previous fiscal year.
NACUBO and Commonfund collected sta
tistics from 842 American institutions of higher
learning to produce their annual endowments
study. According to the groups' research,
endowments experienced an average reduction

of 18.7 percent in fiscal year 2009, which began
July 1,2008 and ended June 30,2009.
Stanford's investment portfolio was widely
diversified in previous years, said John Powers,
president and CEO of the Stanford
Management Company (SMC). SMC handles
the Merged Pool, the University's main invest
ment tool, and is in charge of the payout policy.
While the report revealed that many
endowment managers relied on alternative
investments that performed poorly last year,
including private equity, hedge funds, and ven
ture capital, according to Powers they were not
to blame for the endowment loss.
"The alternatives in general outperformed
the more conventional investments," Powers

said. "So, it's actually not the case that it was the
alternatives that created huge difficulties for
us."
Elaborating on this point, Powers said that
the decline in asset values was challenging
because SMC needed to make payouts to the
University for operating purposes while also
funding capital calls from the University's
investment partners.
"We didn't have enough liquidity and free
dom to be flexible in response to the market
conditions that we wanted," Powers said.
"Managing the liquid resources and improving
the level of liquid resources of the portfolio was
the biggest challenge,"
Powers noted that the market's strong

recovery in calendar 2009 was a saving grace.
Although he could not disclose exact figures,
Powers asserted that "the endowment is in bet
ter shape" at the moment than it was in fiscal
2009.
Furthermore, recent business reports have
indicated that Stanford is leading the pack
when it comes to fundraising money from pri
vate donors. The University beat out other col
leges and universities for the top spot for the
fourth consecutive year.
But Stanford's fundraising efforts were not
immune to the recession; the amount of
fundraised money dropped to $640.1 million in
