## Teachers stage teach-in against budget cuts 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellen Huet 
Faculty, staff and students at three
San Mateo community colleges began a
teach-in yesterday to protest budget
cuts and new restrictions on student

services.
The three campuses of the San
Mateo Community College District
Canada College, Skyline College and
College of San Mateo planned
courses and events for Wednesday and
Thursday that focus on the impact of
financial cutbacks in the district, includ
ing film screenings, campus flyering,
and lectures on student activism and
education privatization.

A statement from organizers names
several changes facing campus opposi
tion, including cuts to library and coun
seling staff, faculty and staff layoffs, and
a 30-percent increase in student fees.
Organizers said the teach-in would
also serve as a starting point for a
statewide Strike and Day of Action
beginning March 4.
