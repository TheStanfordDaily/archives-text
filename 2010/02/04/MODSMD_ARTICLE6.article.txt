## STANFORD SIGNS 22 FOOTBALL RECRUITS FOR 2010 SEASON 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At 4:00 a.m. on Wednesday morning, Henry
Anderson sent in his letter of intent to play football at
Stanford University. With that short note, national
signing day had begun. By its end, 22 players had
pledged their allegiance to the Cardinal, laying the
foundation for a recruiting class that head coach Jim
Harbaugh called, "the best we've had in the three
years I've been here."
"It's neat to gather up this group and bring them to
Stanford," Harbaugh said. "This has been a lifelong
ambition for many of them. A lot of effort has been put
in by these youngsters, their parents and their teachers."
While the Cardinal did not land a five-star recruit
in 2010 (unlike the previous two years, when the team
signed linebacker Shayne Skov and quarterback
Andrew Luck), they were still able to add gems like
Blake Lueders, a linebacker from Indiana who made
a late switch from Notre Dame to Stanford.
"He's by far the most physical of the linebacker
recruits," Harbaugh said. "He's a true middle line
backer, a Brian Urlacher-type. He's a guy who can

shed blocks and go sideline-to-sideline."
Recruiting coordinator and defensive line coach
Lance Anderson said that the battle for Lueders was
the toughest of the cycle.
"He first came out here as a sophomore," he said.
"Even when he committed to Notre Dame, we didn't
give up."
Lueders is one of the many true freshmen that will
likely be asked to contribute immediately, be it on
special teams, in a reserve role or possibly as a starter.
"Probably more [kids will play right away] than
last year," Harbaugh said.
In particular, he identified linebacker Cleophus
Robinson as an immediate special teamer, athlete
Darren Daniel as a do-it-all offensive player, and
Anthony Wilkerson and Ricky Seale as members of
the running back rotation.
"[Wilkerson] is one of the best backs in the coun
try," Harbaugh said. "I expect Anthony to be much
like Stepfan [Taylor] and Tyler [Gaffney] were this
year."

"It's neat to gather up this
group and bring them to
Stanford."
head coach JIM HARBAUGH

In general, Harbaugh was pleased
with the Cardinal's ability to address
positions of "cardiac need," such as
linebacker, the offensive line and the
defensive backfield.
In addition to Lueders and
Robinson, the staff added two other
members to the linebacking corps
Joe Hemschoot, a 16-year-old late
bloomer with, according to Har
baugh, "tremendous athleticism that
jumps off the tape at you," and A.J.
Tarpley, the Minnesota Gatorade
Player of the Year.
The defensive backfield saw the
addition of safeties Devon Carring
ton "a big hitter" and Ed
Reynolds, as well as more amor
phous players like Barry Browning
and Keanu Nelson.
But while Harbaugh specifically
targeted defense, his weakest unit
last season, he and his staff were also
able to add to the offense, where they
landed two four-star quarterbacks in
Dallas Lloyd, whom Harbaugh com
pared to Steve Young (Lloyd will
take a mission and not enroll in the
fall), and Brett Nottingham, a late
switch from UCLA.
With the accurate Nottingham and
mobile Lloyd, Harbaugh has contin
ued his tradition of adding high-qual
ity passers to the Stanford roster, a
stark contrast from the mid-2000s,
when his predecessors struggled to
land any quarterbacks at all. When
asked if he was building the newest in
carnation of "Quarterback U," Har
baugh responded, "We seem to be."
At the other offensive positions,
the Cardinal reversed its actions
from 2009. Instead of keying in on a
number of wide receivers and tight
ends, and not as many linemen, the
team brought in a number of tackles
and guards while only adding a cou
ple of receivers and even then, the
lone remaining player to sign a letter
of intent, wideout Jarrod West, is still
waiting on admissions notice.
"The [offensive] line was ad
dressed very nicely for the Stanford
Cardinal," Harbaugh said. "We call
this group the 'War Daddies.' They
will fit right in with the Tunnel Work
ers Union" the existing line's
moniker.

cruited heavily as a result.
"When he did play, he was great,"
Anderson said.

Of course, it was not all roses for
the Cardinal. Stanford lost three
highly-rated recruits in the past four
days alone. Running back Brandon
Bourbon defected to Kansas, in a
move Anderson called "surprising."
Cornerback Louis Young, one of
Stanford's top commits throughout
the cycle, was not admitted, and will
instead attend Georgia Tech. And in
perhaps the most crushing blow,
four-star linebacker Jordan
Zumwalt, a prized player who began
looking at other schools a few weeks
ago, is now headed to UCLA. His de
cision, made Wednesday, was so
abrupt that he was included in early
drafts of Stanford's press releases.
"You get disappointments, and
that certainly was one," Harbaugh
said of Zumwalt. "With that said, we
won't have another thought about
him."
The emphasis, as it always is for
Harbaugh, was on recruiting team
oriented players who can qualify ac
ademically. This inherently limits the
pool of players Stanford can target,
yet the University's prestige can also
work to the staff's benefit. Anderson,
for example, said that nearly every

Anderson was particularly excit
ed about Dillon Bonnell, who, de
spite injuries that limited his produc
tion during his senior year, was a
force when on the field, and was re-

recruit met with Condoleezza Rice.
And indeed, Harbaugh was quick to
note the academic success of his
newest players. Hemschoot is a con
cert violinist; Lueders had "straight
A's across the board."
"If they've been wired to be a
youngster who wants to achieve as
much as they possibly can in the
classroom and on the playing field,
[the University] helps us a great
deal," Harbaugh said. "To the young
ster who is all about football only,
and treats school as only 'the easiest
classes I can take', and isn't con
cerned with what degree they get, if
any, then Stanford isn't the right
place for them."
But for those who match Har
baugh's zeal, there is a spot for them.
The notoriously ever-eager coach,
rarely nostalgic in public, harkened
back to his own days as a quarter
back recruit in the early 1980s.
"They had that enthusiasm and
energy that I remembered having
when I was making my college deci
sion," he said.
Which, if the feeling can translate
to the collegiate football field, bodes
well for the Cardinal's future.

Joe Hemschoot, a 16-year-old late
bloomer with, according to Har
baugh, "tremendous athleticism that
jumps off the tape at you," and A.J.
Tarpley, the Minnesota Gatorade
Player of the Year.
The defensive backfield saw the
addition of safeties Devon Carring
ton "a big hitter" and Ed
Reynolds, as well as more amor
phous players like Barry Browning
and Keanu Nelson.
But while Harbaugh specifically
targeted defense, his weakest unit
last season, he and his staff were also
able to add to the offense, where they
landed two four-star quarterbacks in
Dallas Lloyd, whom Harbaugh com
pared to Steve Young (Lloyd will
take a mission and not enroll in the
fall), and Brett Nottingham, a late
switch from UCLA.
With the accurate Nottingham and
mobile Lloyd, Harbaugh has contin
ued his tradition of adding high-qual
ity passers to the Stanford roster, a
stark contrast from the mid-2000s,
when his predecessors struggled to
land any quarterbacks at all. When
asked if he was building the newest in
carnation of "Quarterback U," Har
baugh responded, "We seem to be."
At the other offensive positions,
the Cardinal reversed its actions
from 2009. Instead of keying in on a
number of wide receivers and tight
ends, and not as many linemen, the
team brought in a number of tackles
and guards while only adding a cou
ple of receivers and even then, the
lone remaining player to sign a letter
of intent, wideout Jarrod West, is still
waiting on admissions notice.
"The [offensive] line was ad
dressed very nicely for the Stanford
Cardinal," Harbaugh said. "We call
this group the 'War Daddies.' They
will fit right in with the Tunnel Work
ers Union" the existing line's
moniker.

cruited heavily as a result.
"When he did play, he was great,"
Anderson said.

Of course, it was not all roses for
the Cardinal. Stanford lost three
highly-rated recruits in the past four
days alone. Running back Brandon
Bourbon defected to Kansas, in a
move Anderson called "surprising."
Cornerback Louis Young, one of
Stanford's top commits throughout
the cycle, was not admitted, and will
instead attend Georgia Tech. And in
perhaps the most crushing blow,
four-star linebacker Jordan
Zumwalt, a prized player who began
looking at other schools a few weeks
ago, is now headed to UCLA. His de
cision, made Wednesday, was so
abrupt that he was included in early
drafts of Stanford's press releases.
"You get disappointments, and
that certainly was one," Harbaugh
said of Zumwalt. "With that said, we
won't have another thought about
him."
The emphasis, as it always is for
Harbaugh, was on recruiting team
oriented players who can qualify ac
ademically. This inherently limits the
pool of players Stanford can target,
yet the University's prestige can also
work to the staff's benefit. Anderson,
for example, said that nearly every

And indeed, Harbaugh was quick to
note the academic success of his
newest players. Hemschoot is a con
cert violinist; Lueders had "straight
A's across the board."
"If they've been wired to be a
youngster who wants to achieve as
much as they possibly can in the
classroom and on the playing field,
[the University] helps us a great
deal," Harbaugh said. "To the young
ster who is all about football only,
and treats school as only 'the easiest
classes I can take', and isn't con

any, then Stanford isn't the right
place for them."
But for those who match Har

The notoriously ever-eager coach,
rarely nostalgic in public, harkened
back to his own days as a quarter
back recruit in the early 1980s.
"They had that enthusiasm and
energy that I remembered having

Which, if the feeling can translate
to the collegiate football field, bodes
well for the Cardinal's future.

Redshirt junior Zack Giesen has been one of the top performers for the Stanford
wrestling team this season. The Cardinal has had some great individual
performances from Giesen and redshirt sophomore NickAmuchastegui, but
the team has struggled, failing to win any of its four Pac-10 meets.
At 4:00 a.m. on Wednesday morning, Henry
Anderson sent in his letter of intent to play football at
Stanford University. With that short note, national
signing day had begun. By its end, 22 players had
pledged their allegiance to the Cardinal, laying the
foundation for a recruiting class that head coach Jim
Harbaugh called, "the best we've had in the three
years I've been here."
"It's neat to gather up this group and bring them to
Stanford," Harbaugh said. "This has been a lifelong
ambition for many of them. A lot of effort has been put
in by these youngsters, their parents and their teachers."
While the Cardinal did not land a five-star recruit
in 2010 (unlike the previous two years, when the team
signed linebacker Shayne Skov and quarterback
Andrew Luck), they were still able to add gems like
Blake Lueders, a linebacker from Indiana who made
a late switch from Notre Dame to Stanford.
"He's by far the most physical of the linebacker
recruits," Harbaugh said. "He's a true middle line
backer, a Brian Urlacher-type. He's a guy who can

shed blocks and go sideline-to-sideline."
Recruiting coordinator and defensive line coach
Lance Anderson said that the battle for Lueders was
the toughest of the cycle.
"He first came out here as a sophomore," he said.
"Even when he committed to Notre Dame, we didn't
give up."
Lueders is one of the many true freshmen that will
likely be asked to contribute immediately, be it on
special teams, in a reserve role or possibly as a starter.
"Probably more [kids will play right away] than
last year," Harbaugh said.
In particular, he identified linebacker Cleophus
Robinson as an immediate special teamer, athlete
Darren Daniel as a do-it-all offensive player, and
Anthony Wilkerson and Ricky Seale as members of
the running back rotation.
"[Wilkerson] is one of the best backs in the coun
try," Harbaugh said. "I expect Anthony to be much
like Stepfan [Taylor] and Tyler [Gaffney] were this
year."

"It's neat to gather up this
group and bring them to
Stanford."

In general, Harbaugh was pleased
with the Cardinal's ability to address
positions of "cardiac need," such as
linebacker, the offensive line and the
defensive backfield.
In addition to Lueders and
Robinson, the staff added two other
members to the linebacking corps
Joe Hemschoot, a 16-year-old late
bloomer with, according to Har
baugh, "tremendous athleticism that
jumps off the tape at you," and A.J.
