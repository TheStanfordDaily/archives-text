## STANFORD SIGNS 22 FOOTBALL RECRUITS FOR 2010 SEASON 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At 4:00 a.m. on Wednesday morning, Henry
Anderson sent in his letter of intent to play football at
Stanford University. With that short note, national
signing day had begun. By its end, 22 players had
pledged their allegiance to the Cardinal, laying the
foundation for a recruiting class that head coach Jim
Harbaugh called, "the best we've had in the three
years I've been here."
"It's neat to gather up this group and bring them to
Stanford," Harbaugh said. "This has been a lifelong
ambition for many of them. A lot of effort has been put
in by these youngsters, their parents and their teachers."
While the Cardinal did not land a five-star recruit
in 2010 (unlike the previous two years, when the team
signed linebacker Shayne Skov and quarterback
Andrew Luck), they were still able to add gems like
Blake Lueders, a linebacker from Indiana who made
a late switch from Notre Dame to Stanford.
"He's by far the most physical of the linebacker
recruits," Harbaugh said. "He's a true middle line
backer, a Brian Urlacher-type. He's a guy who can

shed blocks and go sideline-to-sideline."
Recruiting coordinator and defensive line coach
Lance Anderson said that the battle for Lueders was
the toughest of the cycle.
"He first came out here as a sophomore," he said.
"Even when he committed to Notre Dame, we didn't
give up."
Lueders is one of the many true freshmen that will
likely be asked to contribute immediately, be it on
special teams, in a reserve role or possibly as a starter.
"Probably more [kids will play right away] than
last year," Harbaugh said.
In particular, he identified linebacker Cleophus
Robinson as an immediate special teamer, athlete
Darren Daniel as a do-it-all offensive player, and
Anthony Wilkerson and Ricky Seale as members of
the running back rotation.
"[Wilkerson] is one of the best backs in the coun
try," Harbaugh said. "I expect Anthony to be much
like Stepfan [Taylor] and Tyler [Gaffney] were this
year."

"It's neat to gather up this
group and bring them to
Stanford."
