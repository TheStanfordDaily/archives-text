## Poll: would you turn in a cheater? GSC meeting covers Honor Code survey, student group financing, Easter 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
In a short meeting last night, Graduate Student
Council (GSC) members discussed the Honor Code
survey now circulating among students ahead of
today's Faculty Senate meeting, as well as ASSU
updates, event announcements and legislative action
on clarifying constitutional policy.
With regard to the Honor Code survey sent to stu
dents on Jan. 31, co-chair Eric Osborne, a law student,
said the survey was designed to help ASSU leaders
understand students' perceptions of the code. He said
that in 15 hours, he received 262 grad student respons
es and 600 undergraduate student responses.
The survey found that approximately 62 percent of
graduate students would turn a cheating student in.
Generally, the survey seemed to support that students
take the Honor Code seriously, with the majority of
students ranking its seriousness between three and five
on a scale of one to five, Osborne said.
The Faculty Senate is set to hear the survey results
and discuss the honor code Thursday afternoon.
The group also heard funding requests from several
student groups. GSC members approved $1,750 for the
Stanford Taiwanese Students Association, $2,500 for
the Educational Studies Program, $l5O for Spicmacay,
$1,700 for the Hindu Students Association and $1,250
for the Reformed University Fellowship at Stanford.
ASSU President David Gobaud, a co-terminal stu
dent in computer science, went on to discuss the
upcoming Wellness Week, which he said would attempt
to help students relieve stress and take care of their
health.
Additionally, the tentative date for FutureFest, an
ASSU-sponsored green sustainability summit, has
been set for April 17. Gobaud has touted the upcoming
event as one of the centerpieces of his tenure as stu
dent body president.
Past constitutional issues about the process of
appointing a member to the ASSU executive cabinet
also drew discussion. During fall quarter, Gobaud's
attempted appointment of Farah Abuzeid 'lO as co
chief of staff failed amid questions from the student
body legislature about his authority to make such an
appointment. The chief of staff position is paid.
After a short discussion of whether or not to amend
the bylaws through legislation, members settled on
having Gobaud bring it to the ASSU Constitutional
Council.
Elections Commissioner Quinn Slack 'll
announced several upcoming information sessions
designed to explain elections and special fees policy.
The deadline for special fees group requests is Feb. 19.
Co-chair Nanna Notthoff, a second-year graduate
student in psychology, gave an update about additional
charges from the recent Masquerade Ball. The council
was charged an extra $BO5 for requiring additional
security officers and an undetermined amount for
cleaning charges by the Alumni Center.
"[The Alumni Center] is probably less open to hold
ing large student events there in the future and allow
ing red wine at these events," Notthoff explained.
Notthoff announced that Provost John Etchemendy
has agreed to sponsor the 2010 Easter egg roll for grad
students and their families, and will host the event at
his house.
The meeting ended as ASSU Vice President Andy
Parker 'll arrived to pass out promotional bracelets
ahead of the upcoming Wellness Week. The bracelets
read, "I'm just the way I am," and GSC members
were given a marker to fill in the blank with an adjec
tive that affirms their well-being.
