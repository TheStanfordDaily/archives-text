the underlying materials science," Hawkins said.
Upon arriving in Washington, D.C., Farfan was
given a private tour of the Smithsonian Museum of
Natural History, met with Secretary of Education
Arne Duncan and conducted a series of live televi
sion interviews. Yet she was most surprised by the
motorcade that greeted her to escort her to the
White House.
"At first I didn't realize what was going on,"
Farfan said. "I saw all of these police cars and I
thought, there must have been an accident. Then I
realized, no, the police cars are following us."
Upon walking into the House of
Representatives Chamber, Farfan was excited to
see famous politicians filing into their seats.
Security guards motioned her into the room.
"I walked through the doors, and it was freezing
cold inside," Farfan said. "It turns out that the
lights are so hot and there are so many people
packed into the room that they don't want the
President to start sweating."
On her trip, Farfan was also asked to write on
the official White House blog, in which she com
mented on her feelings just after the address: "I am
still trying to calm down from the adrenaline rush
of tonight's events. I feel deeply honored to have
been invited to sit with the First Lady in her box at
the State of the Union Address."
The freshman sat on the stairs of Michelle
Obama's box, seated only a few rows away from
the First Lady. Despite Farfan's initial concerns
about her outfit choice, when the camera panned
across the First Lady's booth during the address,
there was Farfan, dressed in a sharp, newly pur
chased business suit.
Following the speech, she also had the honor of
meeting Michelle Obama and the President himself.
"I went to shake [the First Lady's] hand, and
she gave me a hug," Farfan said. "She was very,
very sweet. You felt like you were with a neigh
bor."
She also shook hands with the President and
congratulated him on his speech.
"I was there to represent science and math and
education, and I thought he touched on that quite

What am I going to wear to the
President's State of the Union
address?
That was the first thought that crossed the mind
of Gabriela Farfan 'l3 when she received the call
from the White House on Jan 21. On the request of
First Lady Michelle Obama, Farfan was asked to
attend President Obama's first State of the Union
address the following Wednesday.
Placing 10th of 1,600 competitors in the presti
gious Intel Science Talent Search last year, Farfan
was invited to be one of the First Lady's guests of
honor to underscore the President's "commitment
to science, technology, engineering and mathemat
ics education (STEM)," according to The White
House blog.
"They asked me, 'Do you want to sit with the
First Lady in her booth?"' Farfan said, recalling the
phone call.
Pausing in awe, it didn't take long for her
response: "Yes."
The White House selected Farfan and three
other young women to recognize their scientific
contributions and leadership potential.
"The young women were singled out for their
early achievements and their place among the
nation's next generation of leaders," said Wendy
Hawkins, executive director of the Intel
Foundation, in an e-mail to The Daily.
Farfan had been researching the relationship
between light and gem stone colors at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison while still in high
school over two years ago. What she found that
certain gemstones appear to change color when
viewed from different angles could break new
ground in nanotechnology and materials science.
"What struck me most particularly about
Gabriela's work was the length of time she had
pursued her passion, and the leap she had made
from loving rocks... to truly innovative work in

a bit," she said.
Yet despite the president's emphasis on math
and science in his address, Farfan expressed con
cern on the cultural weight given to the subjects in
today's generation.
"I think that a lot of people are scared of sci
ence and math, and that's something we need to
dispel," she said. "I think the President really wants
us to excel in science so that we can build future
technologies and clean fuels for future generations.
We aren't in a good spot right now."

Farfan returned to Stanford the next day to hit
the science books and catch up on sleep. She said
she planned to continue her geology research at
Stanford, and eventually attend graduate school in
geology.
"I would like to continue doing mineralogical
research I'm totally into minerals," Farfan
beamed.
