Darryl Anders, musician and creator of music for Guitar Hero, plays for students in the Naranja Lounge on Thursday. He, along with instrument designer Jimmy Coppolo,
led the conversation at "Technology and Music: Its Past and Its Future," which attracted students interested in learning more about professions in the music industry.
