## DAILY LIFE AT TRESIDDER UNION 
### HONG VAN PHAM 
It's noon, and a swarm of bikers frantical
ly rushes in one general direction
toward the candy cane pattern of red
chairs and white tables outside Tresidder
Union.
Between the stairs and the entrance to the
building, five girlfriends sit comfortably in
each other's familiar presence. From the side, a
shadow creeps up behind one of the girls, and
a pair of arms suddenly wraps itself around her
shoulders.
"That scared me so much!" Startled, the girl
hovers her palm over her chest, her other hand
clutching a cup of yogurt.
The friend who surprised her laughs and
launches into a story about a recent party.
"He and I were trying to dance, and then
there were people creeping around us and
we're like, 'Go away! We're trying to have fun
by ourselves!'"
Nearby, others are also discussing last
weekend.
"And then you wake up and you're like,
'Oh shit!"' the girl at the table next to them
exclaims, her oval-shaped mouth enunciating
each word to the boy sitting with her, who
leans in attentively.
From freshmen to professors, the Stanford

community has found an unlikely lunchtime
sanctuary in Tresidder Union. Just inside,
Subway, Fraiche and Peet's Coffee mark out
student territories in opposing corners. A
familiar smell of roast-beef sandwiches, mixed
with the grease and oil of chow mein and
orange chicken, escape into the atmosphere.
A girl in brown leather boots and a
turquoise dress licks her lips and orders her
favorite treat two of Fraiche's addicting
chocolate chip cookies.
Behind her, tables are filling up as cus
tomers receive their food orders, and disjoint
ed bits of conversation faintly surface over the
rustling crowd.
"I haven't seen you around, have you been
involved?" someone asks.
"No, just stressed out!" comes a reply.
Friends catch up for a brief moment or two
amid the hustle and bustle of the food court.
The brave bring their work, toiling with books
and open laptops until a familiar face greets
them and snaps them out of their state of pre
occupation.
Struggling to be heard over the rising din,
some customers resort to elaborate hand ges
tures. Across the bustling crowd, laughter
weaves together the foreign with the known.
"Hi! How are you?" Two friends eagerly
halt at the sight of one another, exchanging a

belated hug.
"I haven't seen you all of last quarter," one
of them remarks. Both are equally astonished
by the truth behind that observation.
Off to the side, two girls sit at a table,
engaged in the topic of love and relationships.
"You're still not over him?" one friend asks
the other.
The girl reluctantly admits, "No, not entire
ly, but at this point, if we got back together ...
" She draws her words out carefully, but her
friend cuts her off.
"You'd be disillusioned."
In another corner, a boy sits reading
"Absalom Absalom" by William Faulkner,
apple in hand, oblivious to the buzz around
him. A blonde girl with a ponytail perches over
a book, her yellow highlighter ready in hand.
One table down, someone exclaims,
"Woah! This thing is biodegradable! That's so
cool!" She's bursting with excitement over
today's remarkable revelation. "Let's compost
it!" "
Ten feet away, another girl sits with her lap
top, furiously typing away. A couple sits hand
in-hand, absorbed in each other's presence.
In the middle of this scene, an elderly man
in a green button-up shirt is present as an iso
lated yet observant reader. He sits immobile,
seemingly engrossed in his book, quietly mum

bling words from its pages. Occasionally, he
takes a break from his reading and glances up
at a passerby, observing the individual for a
brief second before resuming his original state
of concentration.
Toward the center of the room, a girl in a
bright, purple shirt cloaked with a black cardi
gan sits pointing to her laptop screen.
"So, I Facebook stalked her and found this
picture ..." She peers up expectantly at her
friend, her eyes crinkled at their corners with
mischief.
In line for Subway, three friends stand
among each other conversing, their hands
silently tucked in their pockets.
"Man, Math 42 exam and then this!" one of
the boys remarks. A minute later, something
else is bothering him "All you ever say is
'Let's celebrate! Let's drink!' and then we end
up on top of a toilet bowl." But he grins as the
other two boys chuckle at the comment.
As lunch hour ends, the crowd trickles out
of Tresidder. Conversations gradually end as
students walk in the direction of their dorms
or afternoon classes. Laughing, they exchange
last glances and waves as they mount their
bikes and move on with their days.

Come midday, students fill the tables outside of Tresidder Union to eat lunch, chat with friends, catch up on schoolwork or simply bask in the glory of White Plaza.
