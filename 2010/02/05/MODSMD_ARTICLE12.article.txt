# LENDING A HELPING HAND
## 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
It's 2 p.m. A group of freshmen walked
through White Plaza, which was plastered
with "Apply for Camp Kesem," "Be a
Hero" and Dance Marathon countdown
signs. Trailing behind was a short girl in a
Greenpeace T-shirt, holding brochures, poised
to deliver her spiel.
In a matter of minutes, the girl stopped the
freshmen, convincing them that they were not
doing enough social good and persuading them
that the world needs to be saved. She then hint
ed that the group should donate to the cause of
"Save the Oceans."
At the start of a Stanford experience, stu
dents are encouraged to join in on the public
service trend. As a freshman walks through the
Activities Fair, he is greeted with messages of
"Stop violence against women," "Support chil
dren in Africa" and "Dance for 24 hours to
raise awareness of HIV/AIDS."
"The millennial generation is very motivat
ed by the feeling of responsibility and the feel
ing of wanting to make a positive difference,"
said Abby Conover, the Haas Center post
graduate public service coordinator.
Throughout their years at Stanford, stu
dents are encouraged to perform service. In
fact, social good has become ingrained in stu
dents' minds, even as they pursue post-gradua
tion careers.
"There is a definite trend with students now
wanting to have an impact on the greater good
regardless of what specific field they are in,"
wrote Kristin Connor, Career Development
Center (CDC) career counselor, in an e-mail to
The Daily.
The save-the-world syndrome has been

around for a long time, but the intensity of
interest didn't spike until recent years.
"We are definitely seeing an increased
interest in public service," Conover said.
"Students are definitely checking out their
options."
The increased interest in public service can
be attributed to several factors, but the myriad
ways of doing social good could be one reason.
"I heard a phrase that really applies,"
Conover said. "Students are 'sawy altruists.'
That's what Frank Benest, former city manag
er of Palo Alto, described it as."
Stanford puts a great deal of emphasis

on bettering the world, both in and

out of the classroom.
Many public service focus

classes are becoming
incorporated in curricu
la, including an Asian- ™
American community
class to be offered in the 1
spring that provides
hands-on service experi
ence, as well as the political

science department's Ethics '
and Politics of Public Service
class. Thomas Schnaubelt, execi

tive director of the Haas Center,
wrote an e-mail to The Daily about
how ideas of working for the social
good are indeed becoming more
incorporated in academics.

"Public service can take place both inside
and outside the classroom," Schnaubelt said.
"Only in doing so can students explore deeply,
taking full advantage of our outstanding schol
ars, the exchange between theory and prac
tice."
The Haas Center is a large proponent of

encouraging social good. For the last 25 years,
the option of pursuing social-good-type careers
can be explored at this center.
According to Jeff Hawthorne, fellowship
programs director at the Haas Center, there
are usually 250 to 300 applications for 120
funded Haas fellowships.
"Our fellows are able to articulate both per
sonal and academic reasons for their interests
in specific areas of public service," Hawthorne
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
According to Lance Choy, the director of
the CDC, there are 3,700 subscribers to the

public service newsletter and 5,000 sub-

scribers to the business opportunities

newsletter.
\ "What I realize is that pub-

lic service is becoming a

_ more intellectual aca
demic professional
P* » nnth " coiU

career path, said
Tristana Pirkl 'lO.

Public service is
also seeing an upsurge

because it jives with stu
dent interests for exam-

pie, the upcoming Hack-a
thon and Dance Marathon

(DM).
Bill Loundy 'lO said that his

involvement in DM was his path
way into public service. According

to Loundy, his previous motives were to "beef
up [his] resume."
Lauren Piatt 'l2, a member of the DM core,
agreed that DM was away of channeling
Stanford students' vitality into a better cause.
"It's building the Stanford bubble and pop
ping it at the same," she said. "We're gathering
a bunch of Stanford students. But we're also

opening eyes to the global and larger picture."
To Hack-a-thon founder and ASSU
President David Gobaud, the Hack-a-thon was
a smart way of getting techies involved with
public service.
"In computer science, I think there is a lot of
slant toward industry," Gobaud added. "I hope
that the Hack-a-thon will increase people's
interest in public service."
Sam King 'l2, one of the current organizers
of Hack-a-thon, agreed with this concept.
"I feel like, particularly in engineering,
there are a lot of people interested in service
but don't think of it as a possible career path,"
King said. "One of the things we're trying to
work against is to change it so we use CS for
social good. Like the Haas Center says, service
is for everyone."
Public service postgraduate opportunities
are also being offered left and right. Teach for
America (TEA) programs, the Peace Corps
and Haas fellowships are growing programs
that are becoming increasingly popular.
TFA received 35,000 applications in 2009,
compared to the 32,000 applications to
Stanford for the Class of 2014. More people are
interested in Teach for America than attending
Stanford.
"People are thinking more creatively,"
Conover said. "Obama made public service a
clear part of his agenda. I think the national
conversation also plays a part."
But the move to social good is also individ
ually driven. As New York Times columnist
Nicholas Kristof put it, "Helping others may be
as primal a human pleasure as food or sex."
"We are in a privileged place and we have a

duty and obligation to society to use
our privilege to benefit more people
and bring opportunities to people
outside of us," said Lia Bonamassa
'lO, one of the DM coordinators.
"On some level it's a selfish
thing," Piatt said.
Guilt from privilege is another

factor in student giving. To Sugoon
Fucharoen 'l2, it's the idea of pass
ing the privilege forward.
"I guess it's like giving someone a
really, really good Christmas gift,"
Fucharoen wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "When you see the person
laughing with exhilarating joy of get
ting that special gift, you just some
how feel... fulfilled and even more
happy than getting one yourself."

way into public service. According

to Loundy, his previous motives were to "beef
up [his] resume."
Lauren Piatt 'l2, a member of the DM core,
agreed that DM was away of channeling
Stanford students' vitality into a better cause.
"It's building the Stanford bubble and pop
ping it at the same," she said. "We're gathering
a bunch of Stanford students. But we're also

opening eyes to the global and larger picture."
To Hack-a-thon founder and ASSU
President David Gobaud, the Hack-a-thon was
a smart way of getting techies involved with
public service.
"In computer science, I think there is a lot of
slant toward industry," Gobaud added. "I hope
that the Hack-a-thon will increase people's
interest in public service."
Sam King 'l2, one of the current organizers
of Hack-a-thon, agreed with this concept.
"I feel like, particularly in engineering,
there are a lot of people interested in service
but don't think of it as a possible career path,"
King said. "One of the things we're trying to
work against is to change it so we use CS for
social good. Like the Haas Center says, service
is for everyone."
Public service postgraduate opportunities
are also being offered left and right. Teach for
America (TEA) programs, the Peace Corps
and Haas fellowships are growing programs
that are becoming increasingly popular.
TFA received 35,000 applications in 2009,
compared to the 32,000 applications to
Stanford for the Class of 2014. More people are
interested in Teach for America than attending
Stanford.
"People are thinking more creatively,"
Conover said. "Obama made public service a
clear part of his agenda. I think the national
conversation also plays a part."
But the move to social good is also individ
ually driven. As New York Times columnist
Nicholas Kristof put it, "Helping others may be
as primal a human pleasure as food or sex."
"We are in a privileged place and we have a

duty and obligation to society to use
our privilege to benefit more people
and bring opportunities to people
outside of us," said Lia Bonamassa
'lO, one of the DM coordinators.
"On some level it's a selfish
thing," Piatt said.
Guilt from privilege is another

factor in student giving. To Sugoon
Fucharoen 'l2, it's the idea of pass
ing the privilege forward.
"I guess it's like giving someone a
really, really good Christmas gift,"
Fucharoen wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "When you see the person
laughing with exhilarating joy of get
ting that special gift, you just some
how feel... fulfilled and even more
happy than getting one yourself."

It's 2 p.m. A group of freshmen walked
through White Plaza, which was plastered
with "Apply for Camp Kesem," "Be a
Hero" and Dance Marathon countdown
signs. Trailing behind was a short girl in a
Greenpeace T-shirt, holding brochures, poised
to deliver her spiel.
In a matter of minutes, the girl stopped the
freshmen, convincing them that they were not
doing enough social good and persuading them
that the world needs to be saved. She then hint
ed that the group should donate to the cause of
"Save the Oceans."
At the start of a Stanford experience, stu
dents are encouraged to join in on the public
service trend. As a freshman walks through the
Activities Fair, he is greeted with messages of
"Stop violence against women," "Support chil
dren in Africa" and "Dance for 24 hours to
raise awareness of HIV/AIDS."
"The millennial generation is very motivat
ed by the feeling of responsibility and the feel
ing of wanting to make a positive difference,"
said Abby Conover, the Haas Center post
graduate public service coordinator.
Throughout their years at Stanford, stu
dents are encouraged to perform service. In
fact, social good has become ingrained in stu
dents' minds, even as they pursue post-gradua
tion careers.
"There is a definite trend with students now
wanting to have an impact on the greater good
regardless of what specific field they are in,"
wrote Kristin Connor, Career Development
Center (CDC) career counselor, in an e-mail to
The Daily.
The save-the-world syndrome has been

around for a long time, but the intensity of
interest didn't spike until recent years.
"We are definitely seeing an increased
interest in public service," Conover said.
"Students are definitely checking out their
options."
The increased interest in public service can
be attributed to several factors, but the myriad
ways of doing social good could be one reason.
"I heard a phrase that really applies,"
Conover said. "Students are 'sawy altruists.'
That's what Frank Benest, former city manag
er of Palo Alto, described it as."
Stanford puts a great deal of emphasis

on bettering the world, both in and

out of the classroom.
Many public service focus

classes are becoming
incorporated in curricu
la, including an Asian- ™
American community
class to be offered in the 1
spring that provides
hands-on service experi
ence, as well as the political

science department's Ethics '
and Politics of Public Service
class. Thomas Schnaubelt, execi

tive director of the Haas Center,
wrote an e-mail to The Daily about
how ideas of working for the social
good are indeed becoming more
incorporated in academics.

"Public service can take place both inside
and outside the classroom," Schnaubelt said.
"Only in doing so can students explore deeply,
taking full advantage of our outstanding schol
ars, the exchange between theory and prac
tice."
The Haas Center is a large proponent of

encouraging social good. For the last 25 years,
the option of pursuing social-good-type careers
can be explored at this center.
According to Jeff Hawthorne, fellowship
programs director at the Haas Center, there
are usually 250 to 300 applications for 120
funded Haas fellowships.
"Our fellows are able to articulate both per
sonal and academic reasons for their interests
in specific areas of public service," Hawthorne
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
According to Lance Choy, the director of
the CDC, there are 3,700 subscribers to the

public service newsletter and 5,000 sub-

scribers to the business opportunities

newsletter.
\ "What I realize is that pub-

lic service is becoming a

_ more intellectual aca
demic professional
P* » nnth " coiU

career path, said
Tristana Pirkl 'lO.

Public service is
also seeing an upsurge

because it jives with stu
dent interests for exam-

pie, the upcoming Hack-a
thon and Dance Marathon

(DM).
Bill Loundy 'lO said that his
