## EDITORIAL Senate blunders special fees bill 
### 
Earlier this week, The Editorial Board
proposed solutions to the challenge of
a rising special fees refund rate. Today,
we will address more broadly the rushed na
ture of ASSU Senate action and the lack of
public engagement in the process. Most stu
dents are aware that the Undergraduate Sen
ate is the largest source of undergraduate
student group funding on campus. Yet, in the
last few weeks, student concerns regarding
budgetary processes have been largely ig
nored or not sought after at all.
Following the recent passing of a contro
versial bill to revise the special fees process,
many students expressed their discontent
through a mass e-mail petition demanding
the reevaluation of the bill. Concerned stu
dents have begun to attend Senate general
body meetings, as well as the more obscure
policy and subcommittee meetings. In re
sponse to students' disapproval, Senate
Communications Chair Lee Jackson 'l2 re
leased a widely circulated e-mail stating that
the bill is meant to satisfy "Stanford's voters
who have to contribute more and more
money each year."

The Editorial Board is not dismissive of
the financial concerns of the student body as
they relate to special fees. Yet, in the course
of the Senate's deliberations on the special
fees bill, seeking the input of "Stanford's vot
ers" was largely abandoned for the sake of
expediency, and a compromising decision
was reached.

This special fees bill was formally pro
posed a week before it was voted on, which is
standard practice. However, student group fi
nancial officers were informed of the bill
through an e-mail sent by bill co-author and
Appropriations Committee leader Anton
Zietsman 'l2 to the leaders of approximately
1,500 student organizations. Concerns or
questions were, in turn, to be fielded through
e-mail and at a meeting scheduled for the day
after the final vote would be held. Subse
quently, a less-than-two-percenl response
rate from financial officers signified to those
advancing the bill that there were no sub
stantial concerns with the proposal. Similar-

ly, public meeting notes from the Senate
meeting following the passage of the bill note
Senator Shelley Gao's 'll disregard for "mi
nority interests trying to distort the process."
She also reminded those in attendance that
she does not merely represent financial offi
cers of special fees groups, but rather the
"silent majority" of undergraduates.
Judging approval or disapproval based on
a lack of response is no way to gauge public
sentiment. This past Monday, The Daily's
news section featured an article concerning
the increased tightening of the Appropria
tions Committee's policies. Changes to these
policies were decided upon after a sole meet
ing, which one group representative attend
ed. To say that a meeting publicized twice to
the public Senate mailing list represented
concerted outreach attempts is ludicrous.
This bill was proposed to address a rising
refund rate and is said to be an attempt to in
crease campus dialogue about special fees by
allowing voters to participate not only in the
approval, but also the size of proposed budg
ets. The Editorial Board, however, does not
believe that the rising refund rate was tied
solely to increasing fees. We believe the in
crease is a direct result of increased aware
ness of the refund process, aided by the con
certed campaign of the Stanford Conserva
tive Society to increase awareness of the re
fund process. This can be seen in the actions
of 379 students who asked for a full refund, a
three-year high. Clearly, many do not per
ceive the refund as a mechanism to inform
groups of their ideological disapproval, but
rather as away to put a quick $ll9 in their
pockets.
In passing this special fees bill, student
input was effectively cast aside in an attempt
to enact a proposal meant to empower stu
dents in the special fees process. By approv
ing a bill that does not accomplish its pur
ported aim and by failing to sufficiently en
gage students or student groups in the
process, the ASSU Senate is ignoring its re
sponsibilities as representatives. They disre
garded their constituents' input for the sake
of a more expedient process.
