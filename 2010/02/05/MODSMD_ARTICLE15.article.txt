# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## "Wittgenstein Is on My Mind" 
### Aysha Bagchi 
At the end of a wonderful fall quarter in
Oxford, my Oxford tutor (i.e. my
teacher and mentor for the quarter)
recommended a biography to me by Ray
Monk titled, "Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty
of Genius." Inspired by my time studying phi
losophy at such an ancient institution, I decided
to read about the life of this Cambridge
philosopher over the break. Now, everywhere I
go and everything I do, Wittgenstein is on my
mind.
As I was visiting some of the more beautiful
sights on my return to campus, a quotation on a
wall in MemChu caught my eye and, of course,
made me think of Wittgenstein. The quote
reads: "There is no narrowing so deadly as the
narrowing of man's horizon of spiritual things .
.. No widening of science, no possession of ab
stract truth can indemnify for an enfeebled
hold of the highest and central truths of human
ity. 'What shall a man give in exchange for his
soul?"'
In reading those words, I experienced a halt
ing feeling, as if I and the student body more
generally were being accused. The lines
were probably written with students in mind,
designed to warn against the supposed danger
ous forces within a university setting that might
stamp out the "spiritual" and narrow us. Inter
estingly, I think Wittgenstein would have
echoed this warning, and as I reflect anew on
life at Stanford, I cannot help feeling he had
something to fear.
Wittgenstein is generally not regarded as re
ligious. A professor told me Wittgenstein once
wrote a friend an exasperated letter when she
sent him a Christmas card because neither of
them was Christian. Yet Wittgenstein was very
spiritual in the sense that he valued human af
fectivity, holding a deep appreciation for the
arts, for moral contemplation, and for sensitive
human natures. He believed the "darkness of
this time" was directly attributable to the wor
ship of the "false idol of science," and he found
these modern faults even in himself. In mo
ments when he felt too theoretical or "wise," he
felt deadened, as if the spirit were being re
placed by machine.
For this reason, Wittgenstein normally ad
vised his students to leave the world of acade
mia and become doctors or manual laborers.
He would say there was "no oxygen" at Cam
bridge and they could not "breath" in that set
ting, as if such a life in its intolerance for as
pects of the human experience that cannot be
encapsulated by theory would smother the
human being. It was in the arts and in moral re
flection that Wittgenstein found oxygen and
felt human.

Do such reflections have bearing on our
own lives? Is the Stanford bubble oxygen-less?
In many ways, Stanford is the reverse: it is a

place that enlivens students, exposing us to an
exciting environment of swarming thoughts
and ideas. But there is also a deadening effect
inherent in our education. For example, the un
dergraduate experience leaves many students
feeling like they are on a conveyor belt in col
lege, working because it is what they have al
ways done and are expected to do. They see no
point in it, yet they trudge along.

Furthermore, some students show a lack of
value for the more "poetic" disciplines in the
humanities, perhaps because these fields can
not be reduced to formulaic method. And the
specialized mindsets we develop in our majors
encourage this dismissal.
Consider, for example, Immanuel Kant's fa
mous reflection: "Two things fill my mind with
awe: the starry skies above and the moral law
within." A little knowledge of neuroscience
might tell us that feelings of awe are particular
chemical reactions in the brain; evolutionary
theory then reminds us that we've developed
these feelings because they help advance the
species; finally, philosophy informs us that such
statements are meaningless in the first place.
Pretty soon, Kant's feeling of awe becomes for
eign, a language we don't even speak. Our Stan
ford experience risks distancing us from the af
fective, from ourselves.
It is useful to remember that a lot of the oxy
gen at Stanford comes from the outside. In
large part, it is our study abroad and public
service experiences that infuse Stanford life
with oxygen and student life with purpose. Stu
dents who study abroad or volunteer often re
turn to campus with a value for the question of
what is meaningful to them, and they bring
these emotional stirrings to the table when they
start to re-engage with the rigors of academia.
The University generally seems to get this,
forcing humanity's requirements on us early
and encouraging public service and study
abroad experiences. What it does not do is in
still in students an understanding of how these
things infuse oxygen into our education. Why is
a "liberal" education important? Alas, we may
need Wittgenstein for this one.
