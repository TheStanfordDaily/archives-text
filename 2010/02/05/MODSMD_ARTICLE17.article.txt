# MIDNIGHT FRYER
## The 						Walk of "Shame" 
### Yanran Lu 
The first time I heard the term "walk of
shame," someone had to explain to me
over and over again what it meant. I
just did not get the concept and could not re
late to it personally. The only possible reason
for its invention in my mind was to make
those people who did not get laid the night
before feel slightly better about themselves,
as if they did not have to suffer this "terrible"
thing called "walk of shame" the morning
after. But then the question becomes, how
would they have known that it is terrible if
they have never done it themselves?

I have never done a "walk of shame" ei
ther.To me the walk is not at all shameful, but
triumphant. Frankly, it is hard to not bask in
the glory of the victory of the night before.
Just think: how many people would kill to be
in your shoes! How they watched red-eyed
when you took your conquest out of the
party and into your nest. How they wished
that they had gotten some action. The feeling
of superiority resembles that of winning The
Nobel Prize, except it occurs at a higher fre
quency. Yup, it's only you, the one still
dressed in a crisp white dress shirt and Calvin
Klein jeans, and you, the one with sequined
mini-dress and four-inch stilettos eating your
pancakes with strawberries and whipped
cream, both of you who have beaten your
peers in securing the privilege of surviving a
night of scandalous pleasure.
In some ways for me, the mornings after
are not just about triumph, but also produc
tivity. Normally, after a weekend night party
ing, I get up sometime past noon, and by the
time I feel awake and ready to start my day it
is already 4 p.m. The mornings after are actu
ally the most productive weekend mornings I

have ever had at Stanford. I am never good at
sleeping with others, so I tend to wake up at
the brink of dawn (if I ever fell asleep).
One time, I got up as noiselessly as is pos
sible with two people sharing a twin bed, got
dressed, tiptoed outside and lightly slithered
the door closed behind me. After getting out

of his dorm, I felt a chill breeze embracing me
as I watched the golden-red light expand in
the horizon. As I took a deep breath, I knew
that it was going to be a good day. I had a
leisurely breakfast (something I usually
never have time for). Then, passing by Green
Library, I thought to myself, "Why don't I
start my PWR research?" So instead of sleep
ing through the day, I actually started re
searching! Before the morning was over, I
even had time to get coffee with a friend in
Town and Country to debrief on our con
quests the night before. And as we analyzed
my productivity curve, I realized that it real
ly pays to start my day with some "pleasura
ble extracurriculars."

Let's face it: sex (at least good sex) makes
us feel wonderful. It gives that sense of de
light that comes from treating yourself calo
rie-free and guilt-free. Even if the "walk of
shame" consists of figuring out, "Oh shit!
What (or shall we say whom) did I do?!," you
are still among the lucky minority (at Stan
ford) who just GOT LAID last night! So, ex
cuse your jealous friends who are comment
ing on your "walk of shame." What they real
ly mean is your walk of triumph, which puts
them to shame. Besides, you are the best
dressed early-riser. So excuse them for still
being in their sweats and PJs. For the record,
wearing just an American Flag on your body
does count as being "well dressed" you re
ally need to flaunt your American pride
while waiting for a fire drill to end. But that's
a story for another day.

Let s face it: sex (at least
good sex) makes us feel
wonderful. It gives us that
sense of delight that comes
from treating yourself
calorie-free and guilt-free.
