## Stanford tops private donations list 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Zach Zimmerman 
For the fifth consecutive year,
Stanford ranked first in total private
donations among American colleges,
according to a report released by the
Council for Aid to Education on
Wednesday.
Stanford netted $640.1 million in
the 2009 fundraising year, which
ended June 30, edging out Flarvard,
which raised $601.6 million. Cornell,
the University of Pennsylvania and
Johns Hopkins rounded out the top
five.
According to the report, which
surveyed 1,027 schools, American
colleges suffered a 12-percent decline
in total donations, falling to $27.9 bil
lion in 2009 from $31.6 billion in
2008. This decline was the largest
ever in the 40-year history of the sur
vey. Cornell saw the biggest increase
of any of the polled schools, receiving
a 9.1-percent boost from the previous
year.
Despite hanging on to the top
spot, Stanford fared even worse than
the national average: its total repre
sented an 18-percent decrease.
Nonetheless, University fundraisers
were grateful for donations amid the
2009 financial crisis.
"The fact that our donors
responded with this level of support
is a real testament to the generosity
of our alumni, parents and friends,"
said Martin Shell, Stanford's vice
president for development, to the
Los Angeles Times.
The single largest donation was
$5O million from Jay Precourt '59
M.S. '6O, a director at Haliburton
Company.
Precourt helped fund a $lOO mil
lion energy initiative in January
2009. The Precourt Institute now
houses energy and environment
researchers.
