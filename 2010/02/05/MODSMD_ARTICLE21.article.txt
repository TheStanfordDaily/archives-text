## SPIKING THE TIGERS 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
got back in the swing of things on
Wednesday night with a conference win
over visiting Pacific, 30-22, 28-30, 30-20,
30-26.
The No. 5 Cardinal (4-3, 4-3 MPSF)
badly needed a win after two close loss
es last weekend at home, and the Tigers
(4-7,0-7), along with their 44-game con
ference losing streak, came at the right
time on the schedule.
"This win was crucial to us getting

back on track," said senior opposite
Evan Romero. "In a league where teams
are very close, every win counts. Being
able to right the ship before playing
[UC-Santa Cruz] Friday and two big
MPSF matches the following week was
big."
Romero and sophomore outside hit
ter Brad Lawson led the Cardinal with
17 kills each. Sophomore middle blocker
Gus Ellis and senior middle blocker
Garrett Werner each contributed six
blocks, while senior outside hitter Jason
Palacios, who received his first start of
the season due to an injury, played solid

ly with eight kills and six digs.
"There wasn't anything different in
our game plan really," Palacios said. "Pa
cific's style of play is very similar to what
we have seen thus far this season, but our
play tonight was more consistent all
around than it was last week."
The Cardinal jumped out of the gate
to an early 8-5 lead in the first set and
never looked back. Attack errors
plagued the Tigers and they soon found
themselves down 20-11. A Palacios kill
closed out the set for the Cardinal, giving
the team some early momentum.
"I feel like we came out with a sense

of urgency tonight, while at the same
time focusing on our play and taking
care of any opportunities we got to
score easy points," said senior outside
hitter Ed Howell. "Our coaches stressed
the concept of'letting the score take care
of itself,' and I think it is a testament to
our focus during this match that we
played consistently."
In the second set, Stanford once again
jumped out to an early lead at 10-6, with
kills by Romero, Ellis and Palacios lead
ing the way. A quick five-point Pacific

rally put the Cardinal down by one,
and the teams continued to keep it
close throughout the remainder of
the set. With the score tied at 28, a
kill by Pacific's Florian Gornik and
a block of a Lawson kill on the sub
sequent play gave the Tigers the set,
30-28.
With the score tied at one set
apiece, the Cardinal rebounded
quickly, opening up an 8-3 lead to
start the third set. Kills by Werner,
Lawson, Romero and senior setter
Kawika Shoji paced the Cardinal
throughout the set. Two service
aces by Lawson capped off a domi
nating performance by the Card in
the set.
The fourth set provided some
tense moments, as Pacific went up
early 6-3 and the Cardinal was
forced to play catch-up. After Stan
ford regained the lead at 16-15, Pa
cific went on a 6-3 run to get on top
21-19. However, Stanford fought
back with kills by Shoji, and errors by
the Tigers put the Card back on top
24-22. Pacific tried to tie it back up,
but proved unable to do so. Kills by
Romero and Lawson gave the set,
30-26, and the match to the Card.
"We passed well, allowing Kawi
ka to run the offense," Romero
commented on the victory. "Our
serving was much improved as well.
Also, as we continue to improve our
block and defense, we will have
more confidence in our all-around
defensive game, knowing we could
score through our serving and
blocking."
The Cardinal will face local Di
vision 111 rival UC-Santa Cruz at
Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m. on Friday
before taking on conference oppo
nents No. 4 UCLA and No. 11 UC-
Irvine next week at home.
