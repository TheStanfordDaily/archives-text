# Scholarship system is unjust
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
In the NCAA, there are two types
of sports when it comes to scholar
ships: headcount sports and
equivalency sports. In a head
count sport, each athlete on schol
arship counts toward the maximum
number of athletes a school can have on
scholarship. So, no matter if a player is
given a full ride or just 10 cents a year, he
or she is counted toward the overall
scholarship limit for that sport. For this
reason, it is in the interest of these head
count sports to offer full scholarships to
attract the best players possible. So, any
one on the football, men's or women's
basketball, women's volleyball,
women's gymnastics or women's tennis
teams is usually on a full scholarship if he
or she is receiving aid. The number of
scholarships these sports give out almost
always equals the number of athletes on
the roster.
Equivalency sports are different. In
these sports, each team has a certain dol
lar amount in its scholarship "pot," so
the coach can split up the scholarship
amounts however he or she wants. Usu-

ally in these sports, partial scholarships
are given so that more athletes can be on
aid. So if the value of a scholarship at
Stanford is $50,000 per year, then Bob
on the water polo team can get $lO,OOO
per year in aid, James can get $15,000
and Joe can get $25,000, and that all falls
under one scholarship for the water
polo team (it would be three in a head
count sport). It follows from here that it
is harder to get a full scholarship in one
of these equivalency sports because the
coach would rather split up money and
try to get as many good athletes as pos
sible with the lure of at least some aid.
Equivalency sports are all the sports at
Stanford that are not headcount sports
baseball, Softball, soccer, water polo,
wrestling, etc. Coincidentally, the equiv
alency sports have some of the largest
rosters of all the athletic teams.

Let's take a look at these equivalen
cy sports. At Stanford, men's soccer gets

9.9 scholarships, men's volleyball and
men's water polo both get 4.5 and base
ball receives 11.7.The number of players
that actively contribute to these teams is
way more than the scholarship allot
ments. In fact, in soccer, volleyball and
water polo, not even the whole starting
lineup can be on full scholarship. Factor
in key reserves and players who are not
starters but definitely play a lot, and that
makes a lot of deserving players for such
a small amount of aid. In these sports, it
is often the case that if you can qualify
for financial aid and get more money
than athletic aid would give you, then
you will take the financial aid and open
up the athletic aid for someone else.
Now let's compare this to some
other teams. There are 15 scholarships
for women's basketball, 20 for women's
rowing, eight for tennis, 12 for volleyball,
12 for gymnastics, 85 for football, 13 for
men's basketball and 12 for women's
squash. In all these sports, there is clear
ly an abundance of money. The starters
are on full rides. The reserves are on full
rides. The benchwarmers that seldom
play are on full rides. Heck, someone
who is injured and hasn't competed in

three years is probably on a full ride.This
is where the scholarship picture gets
muddled. There are national champi
onship winners and contenders and
multiple-time All-Americans in equiva
lency sports that are getting little to no
scholarship aid. Yet there are people
who may not see playing time, or who
are third string, who have full scholar
ships. Speaking for the minds of many
across the nation... is this fair?
But I can't come down hard here.
The third-string player on a full ride is
probably quite good regardless. Ath
letes on teams at Stanford deserve to be
here and deserve a spot on the team and
a chance to compete. Whether they end
up making the starting lineup could be
argued as irrelevant. And there are also
several players on full rides who succeed
above and beyond most athletes at
Stanford, so their scholarships are ab
solutely justifiable. But it is frustrating
for some to see an unequal distribution
of scholarship aid and unequal compen
sation for what is deemed to be aid
based on outstanding performance.
So why are there equivalency and
headcount sports? The NCAA's basis

for that is that headcount sports general
ly bring in more revenue for schools
than equivalency ("Olympic") sports, so
they give the headcount sports more
money per athlete to spend. Excluding
football and basketball, which almost al
ways generate the most revenue at Divi
sion I schools, you can debate whether
the rest of the headcount sports are
among the highest grossing. If you take
headcount sports at Stanford, there is
one full scholarship for about every 1.13
athletes (almost 1:1) and in equivalency
sports, there is one full scholarship for
about every 2.5 athletes. That is more
than double for all you fuzzies out there.
So these six sports are unlike the rest of
the 25 teams on the Farm when it comes
to athletic aid.

And behind the drama of equivalen
cy and headcount sports is Title IX,
which is the reason that the number of
scholarships for females must equal the
number of scholarships for males. It is
often argued that females have an easi
er time getting athletic aid. Just think: 85
scholarships for the guys on the football
team, so because there is no female
equivalent to football, 85 additional

scholarships must be dispersed among
female sports to equalize. That gives an
average of about four to five more full
scholarships per female sport solely be
cause of the football team at any Divi
sion I institution. In fact, after some
math from GoStanford.com, I found
that there is one full scholarship for
every 2.15 male athletes and one full
scholarship for every 1.8 female ath
letes. Not a large difference, but a differ
ence indeed.

I think Title IX definitely has its place
in society and in sports. In the bigger
sense, it was a necessary change.
Whether the individual effects of Title
IX really evened the playing field, as was
the goal, is a separate issue. As far as
equivalency and headcount sports go, it
doesn't look like there is change coming
from the NCAA on that matter. But it is
something you can keep in mind when
wondering about scholarships to stu
dent-athletes.

Someone out there is going to argue,
"At least athletes are getting their edu
cation paid for... why are they com
plaining about the exact amount?" I will
say that scholarships are a reward for

talent and excellence exhibited for sev
eral years in the athletic arena (and at
Stanford, coupled with quality in the
classroom) just as your talent and excel
lence in and out of classroom got you
into Stanford. The issue is not why ath
letes are getting money â€”it is about
who is getting it and how much they are
getting.

Speaking with a male athlete in an
equivalency sport who has two All-
Americans to his name and a National
Championship ring on his finger and is
not getting any athletic aid he doesn't
like the system, not just for himself but
for all his other athlete friends who are
in the same position as him. They defi
nitely have a right to be upset.
I have presented a bunch of unbi
ased facts here that reveal the deeper
characteristics of athletic aid at colleges.
Is the NCAA dishing out a good schol
arship system? I think it's up to you to
decide.

Danny Belch almost opened up a huge
storm by talking about Title IX. Ask
