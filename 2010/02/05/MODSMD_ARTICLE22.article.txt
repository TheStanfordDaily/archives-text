# Scholarship system is unjust
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
In the NCAA, there are two types
of sports when it comes to scholar
ships: headcount sports and
equivalency sports. In a head
count sport, each athlete on schol
arship counts toward the maximum
number of athletes a school can have on
scholarship. So, no matter if a player is
given a full ride or just 10 cents a year, he
or she is counted toward the overall
scholarship limit for that sport. For this
reason, it is in the interest of these head
count sports to offer full scholarships to
attract the best players possible. So, any
one on the football, men's or women's
basketball, women's volleyball,
women's gymnastics or women's tennis
teams is usually on a full scholarship if he
or she is receiving aid. The number of
scholarships these sports give out almost
always equals the number of athletes on
the roster.
Equivalency sports are different. In
these sports, each team has a certain dol
lar amount in its scholarship "pot," so
the coach can split up the scholarship
amounts however he or she wants. Usu-
