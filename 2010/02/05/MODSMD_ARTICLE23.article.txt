# SWIMMING DOWN TO LOS ANGELES

### CHRIS DERRICK 
With rain forecasted for the weekend,
the Stanford men's swimming and diving
team will head south in favor of a warmer

climate.The No. 2 Cardinal (4-1,1-1 Pac-10)
will take on a pair of Californian rivals
Cal State-Bakersfield (4-1) and No. 13 USC
(8-1,1-1).
The road trip marks another chance for

the men to go for seasonal bests and com
pete against top-flight competition. Swim
ming head coach Skip Kenney has empha
sized that each meet this year is a chance to
"re-learn how to swim."

Beginning on Jan. 1, the full body swim
ming suits that led to an explosion in world
records were banned by FINA, the interna
tional federation that monitors swimming.
The suits provided buoyancy and support,
meaning that the athlete was held in a more
hydrodynamic position. Now, without the
suit, swimmers must use their own muscle
tension and improved technique to replace
what the suit once provided. Developing
these attributes has been a focal point for
the Cardinal this season.
Although the competition in Bakersfield
will not be as fierce as it will be at USC, it
will provide crucial experience that will help
the men later on at Pac-lOs and NCAAs.
Most of the top athletes will swim their sec
ond and third-best events.
"Our goal is to get our guys to make
NCAAs in three events . . . with the dual
meet format, you can usually only swim
your first and second event because there is
less time," Kenney explained.
The road trip also gives the Cardinal
something that has been rare during this
training-intensive portion of the season a
day of rest before the meet. The Cardinal
will be unable to complete a hard session on
Thursday, as they will be traveling down to
Bakersfield via bus.
USC is a young, talented squad that re
turns just one All-American from last year
in diver Harrison Jones. French Olympian
Clement Lefert, however, is a freshman who
figures to make a big impact. He is ranked in
the top 10 in four events: the 100- and 200-
yard butterfly, and the 200- and 500-yard
freestyle.
Another freshman, Alex Lundrum, has

As of Jan. 1, full-body swimsuits are no longer allowed in competitions. The Cardinal has been adjusting to the change and will put
its adjustments to the test this weekend. Stanford is looking to prepare for the upcoming Pac-10 and NCAA tournaments.
swum strongly in the individual med
ley and backstroke events. Dillon
Connolly is also ranked in the top 10
nationally in his event, the 100-yard
breaststroke. He will square off with
Stanford junior John Criste and
sophomore Curtis Lovelace, both of
whom are ranked in the top 20 for
both breaststroke distances.
Although the strength of the
Stanford squad is its depth, there
are a few top performers who have
stood out this year. Senior Eugene
Godsoe has excelled in the back

stroke events, in which he has the
fastest time in the nation in the 100-
yard event. Godsoe has also been
called on to contribute in the 100-
yard butterfly and relays.
Sophomore Chad la Tourrette
has been a revelation for the Cardi
nal in the distance swims. He has
posted top-five times at distances
ranging from 500 to 1,650 yards. Be
hind him is a very deep distance
group that includes sophomores
Michael Zoldos and Trevor Scheid
along with senior captain David
Mosko, all of whom are ranked in
the top 20 nationally.
Alex Coville has led the freestyle
sprints for the Cardinal and his con
tributions will be important, as USC
is weaker in those events.

The Cardinal has also seen
strong contributions from freshmen
Matthew Thompson and Matthew
Swanston in the backstroke events
behind Godsoe. Thompson is also a
major contributor in the 400IM.
U.S. Diving's winter nationals
are this weekend as well, and Stan
ford will send junior Brent
Eichenseer. Due to the conflict with
the USD meet, the diving portion of
the USC meet was completed last
weekend, though results have not
yet been released.
The Bakersfield meet is Friday at 1
p.m. and the USC meet is Saturday
at 1 p.m.
