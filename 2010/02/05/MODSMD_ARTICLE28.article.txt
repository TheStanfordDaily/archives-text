# Giving Love a Bad Name

With Valentine's Day fast
approaching, romantic
films fashioned for
lovey-dovey couples are shooting
onto the screens faster than a fleet
of Cupid's arrows. "From Paris
with Love" is not one of them.
Don't let the name
deceive you: there is nothing lov
able about this film. The movie
starts off with a "Bourne"-like
quality of suspense and intrigue
catalyzed by Irish heartthrob
Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who plays
character James Reese, a young
CIA official revving for his first
field job. For all of 10 minutes,
the cinematography appears to be
wonderfully creative, the sound
track enticing and the plot prom
ising. Then, John Travolta enters
the picture. Loud-mouthed,
uncouth and dressed in an outfit
that would put Hulk Hogan to
shame, Travolta struts on screen
in the character of Reese's
assigned partner, rogue agent
Charlie Wax.
From his very first line of
dialogue (or, rather, string of
expletives), Travolta's character
completely spoils the vibe of the
film, transforming it from a
potentially decent thriller to a
horribly trashy, hideously violent,
half-hearted comedy. Thereafter,
the movie is one long series of
agonizingly contrived chase
scenes. As Reese and Wax race to
the anti-climatic conclusion of
the film, they bust an illicit
cocaine-dealing ring in Parisian
China Town, shoot the streets to
pieces with their absurdly over
sized guns and trace the move
ments of an implausible terrorist
organization, all the while leaving
a wake of destruction behind
them. Their seemingly pointless
mission is littered with superflu
ous sub-plots flashes of inti-

Imacy between Reese and
his beautifully deceptive

French girlfriend, Caroline,
moments of male bonding
between Reese and Wax (some
thing like "Starsky and Hutch"
gone even more wrong) and ludi
crous attempts to give the film a
deeper meaning by linking it to
the War on Terror.
Clocking in at the shock
ingly short length of one hour
and 30 minutes, "From Paris with
Love" ineffectively endeavors to
throw in a little bit of everything:
comedy, violence, romance, espi
onage and current hot topics. The
result is catastrophic, and not in a
good way. Any acting talent from
the cast is diffused by their dys
functional pairing (John Travolta
should have stopped playing the
"bad boy" card decades ago), and
the terribly muddled plot leaves
the framework of the film in
shambles. Crude humor is inter
spersed with unceremonious
killings; romance is intertwined
with unfortunate dialogue; and
attempts to give the movie a glob
al edge render the result hilarious
ly bad. As plot lines criss-cross
and zig-zag off the screen, they
swerve in such different directions
that they fail to make any sort of

sense, right up to the downright
dull ending.

It never does become
clear what Reese and Wax were
meant to accomplish, and little
particulars are never resolved,
such as the question of how the
lugging around of a Chinese vase
filled with top-notch cocaine

throughout the first half of the
film was in any way linked to the
terrorist organization introduced
later on in the story. Furthermore,
the sheer amount of loud, unnec
essary violence and carnage leaves
the audience clutching their arm
rests for no apparent purpose. In
fact, there was so much unwar
ranted slaughter that the film's
title, misleading as it is now,
should be changed to "From Paris
with Blood."
So, as you contemplate
which romantic film to go see this
coming Valentine's Day, stay clear
of this crash-and-burn wreckage
of a movie. And should you
decide to hazard a peek bring
earplugs.
