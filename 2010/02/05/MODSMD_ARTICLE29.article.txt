Now more than ever, it
seems as though celebri
ties are expanding their
empire in ways unrelated to on
camera action. Fragrances, home
furniture, clothing lines and

liquors are all becoming very
popular enterprises. However, one
trend has been around for quite
some time and shows no sign of
going anywhere the celebrity
autobiography. With books from
Miley Cyrus and Sarah Palin, any
body can write a book these days,
author or not. Comedian Eugene
Pack decided to capitalize on this
with his show, "Celebrity
Autobiography: In Their Own
Words." A group of other comedi
ans and performers got together
to read excerpts from the most
ridiculous celebrity autobiogra
phies, and the simple recipe was a
smash success. In a limited
engagement at San Francisco's
SketchFest, Intermission got to see
what TIME magazine is calling
"the funniest docu-theater stunt
of the year."
Getting cozy at Cobb's
Comedy Club, we eagerly antici
pated the start of the show,
because after the city traffic, we
were in the mood to laugh. We
certainly were not disappointed.
"Saturday Night Live" superstar
Rachel Dratch (Debbie Downer!)
and the legendary Fred Willard
were standouts, with the grandfa
therly Willard hysterically reading
an excerpt from "The Man With
The Gold" by Mr. T. We also
heard about Ivanna Trump's
child-raising skills and, hilarious
ly, Tiger Woods' techniques for
"putting." Another highlight was

watching comedienne Maria

Bamford read from a collection of
Suzanne Somers' anthology of
poems, including one that was
actually titled, "The Quiet
Loneliness of Being Alone."
The real star power of
the night came with Jason Segel,
who was filling in for Neil Patrick
Harris, who had to cancel due to
prior commitments. Segel read an
awkward sex scene from David
Cassidy's memoirs, and was
drunkenly endearing. He mum
bled on stage and couldn't control
his own laughter, which made the
scenario even more funny, like we
were being let in on an inside
joke.
A moment that
Intermission particularly enjoyed
was the joint reading from
"Burnin Up!: On Tour With the
Jonas Brothers." As indicated,
many of the readings were from
stars who had faded even during
our parents' generation. While
they were certainly hysterical, it
wasn't as easy to identify with the
absurdity of Burt Reynolds as it
was with Frankie Jonas ("The
Bonus Jonas!"). Despite the gen
erational gaps, "Celebrity
Autobiography" is a must-see.
Besides getting to see respected
celebrities and comedians per
form in an intimate, live environ
ment, you are guaranteed to be
laughing the entire time.
