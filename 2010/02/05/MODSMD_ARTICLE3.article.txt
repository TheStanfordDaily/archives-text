## Ed. study begins this year Stanford begins major curriculum study 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
A top-level effort by the Universi
ty to examine and likely reshape
the undergraduate curriculum is
officially underway.
The Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation at Stanford University
(SUES) will attempt to achieve two
objectives: articulating the goals and
mission of undergraduate education
on the Farm, and translating that phi
losophy into a set of practical recom
mendations regarding University
wide educational requirements.
These recommendations, though
at least a year and a half away, could
potentially remake the fundamental
experience of Stanford undergradu
ates for a generation or, alternate
ly, solidify its current shape for years
to come.
While setting the requirements
for earning a major will remain the
responsibility of individual depart
ments, SUES will be expected to ad
dress the other issues that make up
the undergraduate academic experi
ence, including but not limited to cur
rent requirements for writing,
breadth, distribution, citizenship and
foreign language. SUES will also as
sess the role of programs like fresh
man and sophomore seminars, Intro
duction to the Humanities and the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric.
Stanford's last similar effort was
1994's Commission on Undergradu
ate Education (CUE), which at the
time "undertook the first compre
hensive study of Stanford's under
graduate program in 25 years." Dri
ving the new effort of SUES are
Provost John Etchemendy and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman '79, M.S. 'Bl,
Ph.D. 'B5. The formal charge for
SUES, co-written by the two, argues
for the new effort as a necessity and a
responsibility for a different world
and an evolved institution.
"It is approaching 15 years since
the current curriculum was de
signed," the charge reads. "During
this time, our world, our students and
Stanford University have changed
profoundly so in some instances.
