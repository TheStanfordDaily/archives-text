## Ed. study begins this year Stanford begins major curriculum study 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
A top-level effort by the Universi
ty to examine and likely reshape
the undergraduate curriculum is
officially underway.
The Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation at Stanford University
(SUES) will attempt to achieve two
objectives: articulating the goals and
mission of undergraduate education
on the Farm, and translating that phi
losophy into a set of practical recom
mendations regarding University
wide educational requirements.
These recommendations, though
at least a year and a half away, could
potentially remake the fundamental
experience of Stanford undergradu
ates for a generation or, alternate
ly, solidify its current shape for years
to come.
While setting the requirements
for earning a major will remain the
responsibility of individual depart
ments, SUES will be expected to ad
dress the other issues that make up
the undergraduate academic experi
ence, including but not limited to cur
rent requirements for writing,
breadth, distribution, citizenship and
foreign language. SUES will also as
sess the role of programs like fresh
man and sophomore seminars, Intro
duction to the Humanities and the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric.
Stanford's last similar effort was
1994's Commission on Undergradu
ate Education (CUE), which at the
time "undertook the first compre
hensive study of Stanford's under
graduate program in 25 years." Dri
ving the new effort of SUES are
Provost John Etchemendy and Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman '79, M.S. 'Bl,
Ph.D. 'B5. The formal charge for
SUES, co-written by the two, argues
for the new effort as a necessity and a
responsibility for a different world
and an evolved institution.
"It is approaching 15 years since
the current curriculum was de
signed," the charge reads. "During
this time, our world, our students and
Stanford University have changed
profoundly so in some instances.
It is time to review our curriculum, to
reaffirm or revise our goals for an under
graduate education and to ensure our
requirements reflect our stated goals."
"Much has changed in the 15 years
since the Commission," the charge contin
ues. "The growing social, political, eco
nomic and ecological interconnectedness
of the world certainly challenges us to
look more broadly at what it means to be
an educated citizen."
James Campbell Ph.D. 'B9, a history
professor, and Harry Elam, drama chair
and humanities professor, will co-chair
the 15-member SUES Task Force com
mittee.
Elam, who has been at Stanford since
1990, has been active in issues affecting
undergraduates since that time and has
served as senior associate vice provost for
undergraduate education. Campbell stud
ied at Stanford in graduate school and lec
tured during the 1988-1989 academic
year, but departed for work at other insti
tutions. He returned to the Farm as a
tenured professor in 2008, leaving Brown
University, where he chaired the universi

ty's Steering Committee on Slavery &
Justice.
The work of SUES will take at least a
year and a half, according to Etchemendy.
Its proposals are scheduled for presenta
tion in the spring and Fall 2011 to the
Committee on Undergraduate Standards
and Policies and the Faculty Senate.
Speaking before the Senate, both
Elam and Campbell emphasized that
they, and other committee members, will
enter the process with open minds.
"The work on SUES is not driven by
any prescriptive agenda or any answers,
but by a series of critical questions," Elam
said.
"I think we don't do this with an
agenda, or if there is one, we haven't
been informed of it," Campbell said. "We
are simply at a moment when the
University has gone through really quite
profound changes, and the society we
live in has gone through profound
changes... I think that it is time to see
where we are, see what we require of our
students [and] see whether the require
ments as they currently exist are effec

tive and coherent."
Elam added that he hopes SUES will
focus on building upon existing strengths
at Stanford.
"We will also look at our peers and
other external institutions to see what sort
of innovative and exciting things are hap
pening in terms of undergraduate
requirements," Elam said. "But most
importantly, and significantly, we want to
find something that is the right fit for
Stanford that works here, and is true to
us."
"What we do is a very good thing in
terms of undergraduate education," Elam
added. "In fact, we've been a leader in
that area, and it is our hope to continue
that."
The task force committee also includes
two students: chemistry major Nayoung
Woo 'l2, and history and philosophy
major Aysha Bagchi 'll, who is also a
Daily columnist. In addition to Stephanie
Kalfayan, vice provost for academic
affairs, the rest of the committee member
ship is made up of 10 faculty members.
These 10 represent a range of disci

plines involved in undergraduate educa
tion, including two professors from the
social sciences, three from the natural sci
ences and two from engineering.
Including Elam and Campbell, five of the
15 participants are humanities scholars
one-third of the total membership.
The complete faculty are: Lanier
Anderson, philosophy; Jonathan Berger,
music; Sarah Billington, civil and environ
mental engineering; Timothy Bresnahan,
economics; Christopher Edwards,
mechanical engineering; Susan
McConnell, biology; Kathryn Moler,
applied physics; Rob Reich, political sci
ence; Jennifer Summit, English; and Ravi
Vakil, mathematics.
Scott Calvert, Sharon Palmer and
LaCona Woltmon from the office of the
Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education will also serve as SUES staff.
SUES was first announced by Bravman in
the fall in a presentation to the Faculty
Senate.

profoundly so in some instances.
It is time to review our curriculum, to
reaffirm or revise our goals for an under
graduate education and to ensure our
requirements reflect our stated goals."
"Much has changed in the 15 years
since the Commission," the charge contin
ues. "The growing social, political, eco
nomic and ecological interconnectedness
of the world certainly challenges us to
look more broadly at what it means to be
an educated citizen."
James Campbell Ph.D. 'B9, a history
professor, and Harry Elam, drama chair
and humanities professor, will co-chair
the 15-member SUES Task Force com
mittee.
Elam, who has been at Stanford since
1990, has been active in issues affecting
undergraduates since that time and has
served as senior associate vice provost for
undergraduate education. Campbell stud
ied at Stanford in graduate school and lec
tured during the 1988-1989 academic
year, but departed for work at other insti
tutions. He returned to the Farm as a
tenured professor in 2008, leaving Brown
University, where he chaired the universi

ty's Steering Committee on Slavery &
Justice.
The work of SUES will take at least a
year and a half, according to Etchemendy.
Its proposals are scheduled for presenta
tion in the spring and Fall 2011 to the
Committee on Undergraduate Standards
and Policies and the Faculty Senate.
Speaking before the Senate, both
Elam and Campbell emphasized that
they, and other committee members, will
enter the process with open minds.
"The work on SUES is not driven by
any prescriptive agenda or any answers,
but by a series of critical questions," Elam
said.
"I think we don't do this with an
agenda, or if there is one, we haven't
been informed of it," Campbell said. "We
are simply at a moment when the
University has gone through really quite
profound changes, and the society we
live in has gone through profound
changes... I think that it is time to see
where we are, see what we require of our
students [and] see whether the require
ments as they currently exist are effec

tive and coherent."
Elam added that he hopes SUES will
focus on building upon existing strengths
at Stanford.
"We will also look at our peers and
other external institutions to see what sort
of innovative and exciting things are hap
pening in terms of undergraduate
requirements," Elam said. "But most
importantly, and significantly, we want to
find something that is the right fit for
Stanford that works here, and is true to
us."
"What we do is a very good thing in
terms of undergraduate education," Elam
added. "In fact, we've been a leader in
that area, and it is our hope to continue
that."
The task force committee also includes
two students: chemistry major Nayoung
Woo 'l2, and history and philosophy
major Aysha Bagchi 'll, who is also a
Daily columnist. In addition to Stephanie
Kalfayan, vice provost for academic
affairs, the rest of the committee member
ship is made up of 10 faculty members.
These 10 represent a range of disci

plines involved in undergraduate educa
tion, including two professors from the
social sciences, three from the natural sci
ences and two from engineering.
Including Elam and Campbell, five of the
15 participants are humanities scholars
one-third of the total membership.
The complete faculty are: Lanier
Anderson, philosophy; Jonathan Berger,
music; Sarah Billington, civil and environ
mental engineering; Timothy Bresnahan,
economics; Christopher Edwards,
mechanical engineering; Susan
McConnell, biology; Kathryn Moler,
applied physics; Rob Reich, political sci
ence; Jennifer Summit, English; and Ravi
Vakil, mathematics.
Scott Calvert, Sharon Palmer and
LaCona Woltmon from the office of the
Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education will also serve as SUES staff.
SUES was first announced by Bravman in
the fall in a presentation to the Faculty
Senate.
