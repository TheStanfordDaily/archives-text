# Remote Nomad: Where the accents are funny and the TV is excellent

While the TV world
spent this week salivat
ing over smoke mon
sters and temples, my anxiety
about the status of my Oxford
application manifested itself in a
return to British telly program
ming. A few hours of "Skins" and
"Secret Diary of a Call Girl" later,
I had to ask myself: why is British
TV so freaking awesome?
Admittedly, I'm not at all
familiar with what is probably
Britain's most significant contri
bution to the television universe,
"Doctor Who" and its innumer
able spinoffs. Nevertheless, there
is something to be said for British
forays into TV dramedy. Everyone
knows that NBC's "The Office" is
a pretty people's adaptation of the
"British Office" and that Ricky
Gervais brought "Extras" and
troves of celebrity guest stars to

America. But what is there to see
on British TV besides Ricky and
sci-fi? I'm glad you asked.
First there is "Skins,"
now in its fourth season. "Skins"
tells the story of a group of
teenagers in a London public
school (in England, the word
public actually means private
school, but for this article I'll
work off of the American usage).
Each episode focuses on a differ
ent character, showing us his or
her home life as well as his or her
interactions with the rest of the
ensemble cast. Highlights of the
cast include low self-esteem
Michelle, clarinetist Jal, crazy
Chris and anorexic Cassie.
The forward motion of
the plot coexists with examination
of character, resulting in one of
the most well-constructed televi
sion narrative concepts I've seen.

Having nine main characters
enables the writers to change up
couples and friendships without
upsetting the balance of the show
or frustrating the fan base (I'm
looking at you, "Gossip Girl").
The first season is by far the
strongest, in part because the sec
ond season has to address the
ramifications of the first season
cliffhanger and has to show the
gang preparing for university. In
the third season, we meet the
"new generation," which centers
on Effy, the younger sister of
Tony, who was at the center of the
first two seasons. Effy is the
strong silent type, and the spon
taneity that defined her guest
appearances in the first genera
tion casts her as the leader of the
new crew. For example, the love
triangle between Effy, Freddie and
Cook in Season Three is much
more believable than that of Tony,
Michelle and Sid in earlier sea
sons. The fourth season began
just last week, but it's already off
to an intense start.
One strength of the
British programs is their ability to
incorporate issues like drugs, sex
and psychological disorders with
out being overwrought or sepa
rating them from the normal pace
of the show. So often in American
TV, drugs and sex suffer from the
dreaded montage, and characters
with mental issues are not trusted
to carry an episode, let alone a
show itself. Maybe the British
equivalent of the FCC is less
strict, or the small size of the

island and centrality of London
make these subjects less taboo
than in America.
Another example of this
is "Secret Diary of a Call Girl," the
title of which is pretty self
explanatory. "Call Girl" is
rebroadcast on Showtime in
America, but in England, it is an
original program on a channel
that broadcasts "American Idol,"
"Gossip Girl" and "The Vampire
Diaries." You would never see
Showtime programming on Fox
or the CW alongside these shows,
particularly "Call Girl." I respect
"Call Girl" for its presentation of
nudity and sex from a female per
spective, not unlike "Sex and the
City," and for its ability to have a
sexually emboldened female pro
tagonist who isn't as grating as
any of the "SATC" women. The
pitfall of making Belle, the call
girl in question, so intriguing and
likeable in her call girl life is that
Hannah, her real life identity, and
her subplots about straddling
(zing!) the two worlds are inher
ently dull. The set up of the guy
friend who could be a boyfriend,
the madame and the uninformed
family is a little hackneyed, but
I'm always so impressed with the
performance of Billie Piper as
Belle and the show's subtlety in
dialogue and design.
My sunny portrait of
British TV may be a product of
"the grass is always greener" syn
drome, but the popularity of
these two programs in particular
suggests to me that the British can

afford to take creative risks with
the content of their shows. When
you add to this the fact that the
British gave us "American Idol"
and will be responsible for its
demise when Simon leaves "AI" to
work on another British import,
how can you not fall a little more
in love with the British accents
and the TV shows that showcase
them?
