# Snowchella: A Philanthropic Festival
##

American Apparel, giant
tents, sponsored bever
ages, concert T-shirts
and harried security guards
are all critical parts to large
music festivals. In a much
anticipated campus anomaly,
Stanford found its own legiti
mate music festival on Sigma
Nu's front lawn. One of the
most widely attended events
on campus this year,
Snowchella showcased
Stanford's own Young the
Giant (most know them as the
Jakes), hipster hop duo
Chiddy Bang and one half of
DJs extraordinaire Designer
Drugs.
Organized by and with
donations from Stanford
Concert Network, Sigma Nu
and Kappa Kappa Gamma,
Snowchella was a rare week
end night where students did
n't have to venture off campus
to find a concert worth
attending. The buzz built
strongly on campus due to
widespread posters and
Facebook advertising, but
things reached a climax on
Saturday afternoon, with the
professional tent, concert
flooring, and audio and visual

equipment proving to naysay
ers that this was actually going to be
a big deal.
After a crowd had amassed and
the lasers and snow machines were
fired up, Young the Giant took the
stage, playing both new material and
songs that the campus sang along to,
like "Texas Tea" and the crowd
favorite, "Cough Syrup." Lead vocalist

Sameer Gadhia yelled between songs,
"It's so great to be back at Stanford!"
and in traditional Cardinal pride, the
enormous-for-an-opener crowd
screamed their approval.
After Young the Giant, the guys
of Sigma Nu pulled off one of the
quickest set changes known to man,
preparing the stage and the crowd for
Xaphoon Jones, the affable producer

half of Chiddy Bang, who got the

crowd on its feet with a mix of the
impossible-to-avoid "Party in the
USA." Xaphoon's idle mixing was the
perfect prelude to Chiddy's (rapper
half) entrance. Halfway through the
set, Xaphoon declared, "My boy
Chiddy is the best freestyler! They all
say that in Philly, but Chiddy will

prove it!" and to the absolute frenzy

of the crowd, Chiddy rapped about
Stanford, expertly tailoring their per
formance to the campus. After per
forming the anticipated "All Things
Go" (a remix of Sufjan Steven's

"Chicago") and "Kids (The Opposite
of Adults)," where Xaphoon takes on
MGMT, Chiddy Bang left the stage
for Sigma Nu to do another set
change.

The highlight of the night came
around midnight, when half
(Michael Vincent Patrick) of the up
and-coming and insanely popular

Designer Drugs took the stage.
Without any introduction or interac
tion with the crowd, Patrick began
spinning mixes that were impossible

to not dance to. It seemed as though
the entire campus was raving togeth
er, with enough fist pumping that
even the cast of "Jersey Shore" would

be proud. Designer Drugs' set was a
non-stop party, with students danc
ing on stage a-la Girl Talk, and the
bass thumping so that even Suites

could feel it. Things reached their
peak with Patrick's mix of "Bad
Romance," a highlight for many con
certgoers that night.
While everybody on campus
knew that Snowchella was happen
ing, many didn't know why. The con
cert was thrown as a benefit for
Support for International Change
(SIC), an effort working toward the

relief of HIV/AIDS in Tanzania.
Intermission sat down with Taylor
Ray, 'lO, who spearheaded the event,
to talk about SIC.
"SIC fights HIV/AIDS through
three main programs there are
free volunteering and counseling
services, the other is HIV-positive
patient support and lastly through
education," he said. Ray, who

has volunteered in Tanzania for the
past two summers, says his time
spent there was "honestly, one of the
most fun times of my life."
When asked about the charity
choice for Snowchella's fundraising
efforts, Ray said, "SIC was the perfect
beneficiary for this particular event
because it's a small NGO. It doesn't
receive a huge amount of funding

from the government or any
thing. The amount of money for
SIC is going to make a very tan
gible impact."
As of print time, Ray estimates
that the proceeds from
Snowchella will amount to over
$5,000.
With a strict no-alcohol policy
and legions of security and police
force standing by, many were
concerned that potential trouble
could arise. Outside of an
appearance from Columbae resi
dents in nothing but body paint,
the show went off without a
hitch. When the show abruptly
ended at 1 a.m., the crowd dis
persed, shocked that it was so
late at night. One dancer was
overheard saying, "That was one
of the best nights I've ever had at
Stanford!" After the success of
Snowchella, something has
become quite clear Stanford
could use way more music festi
vals.
