The circus is in town!
Everything you have ever
heard about Cirque du Soleil
being the ultimate circus experience
is true. The newest creation, "Ovo,"
opens Feb. 4 in San Jose and runs
there until March 7. On an enor
mously blunt level, you must go see
it.
Cirque du Soleil was founded
in 1984 in Quebec, Canada as a per
forming troupe, eventually evolving
into what it is today a contempo
rary circus. The company now has
25 different productions, both tour
ing and permanent residency shows.
Similar to the average circus, these
spectacles showcase bizarre and
unusual performers; however,
Cirque pushes the envelope by not
only displaying truly unfathomable
feats, but also by creating an engag
ing story, with music, costumes and
scenery.
The story for "Ovo"
(Portuguese for "egg") revolves
around the life of insects, a theme
that allows for a lot of creativity and
fun. We are first introduced,
through dance, to numerous differ
ent bugs as they carry out their
daily routine. There are grasshop
pers, beetles, spiders, butterflies,
moths, a fly, a ladybug and many
more. Eventually the bugs
encounter an egg, and this discovery
generates change in the insects' per
functory way of life a metamor
phosis, if you will. The story covers
several moods; at times it's roman
tic, sometimes it's intense and often
it is comical. There are certain
recurring characters (the fly and the
ladybug) that add humor to the
performance, allowing for a perfect
balance between stunts and narra
tive.
The costumes were incredible
and extremely innovative, specifical
ly the grasshoppers. They brought
the bugs to life, adding color and
form, which expressed the energy of
the insects, and also somehow
allowed for the stunts to be per
formed. The scenery also played
into the theme, establishing an
appropriate setting with leaves,
flowers and rocks. The music was
beautiful classic, yet cheerful
and played live by a band of beetles.
Although these elements are

enough to amaze any audience
member, they are not even the best
part of the experience.
The tricks and talents you will
see in this show are like nothing you
have ever seen before. There are too
many great acts to name them all,
so let's just touch on some of the
favorites.
The show opens with six
women performing tricks as they
spin various items with their feet.
Three women would flip and pass
along the three other women as
they continued to spin things with
their feet. The precision and accura
cy of these performers was beyond
belief. Later in the show, a contor
tionist performs; not only is she
incredibly flexible and limber, but
she also pulls off stunts that show
case how she is unbelievably strong.
In a different act, a man performs
certain tricks on a tight rope,
including riding a unicycle! The
audience literally all had their jaws
dropped, remembering to breathe
only after applause for particularly
incredible tricks.
Before the show even started,
Intermission was given a backstage
exclusive look behind the scenes of
"Ovo." Our first stop was the cos
tume department, where we learned
that the show has over 600 cos
tumes, all of which get repaired and
washed every night! We then made
our way to the performers' area. It
was very interesting to see that most
of the performers were practicing
their routines; some were even
watching videos of themselves to
see how they could improve. It
seems that when they are not in
front of an audience, the performers
are trying to fine-tune their acts,
which means that most, if not all, of
their time is spent doing their
stunts. Entering the Big Top, we saw
the crew putting the stage and
props together.
We were even lucky enough to
get an interview with a few people
from the show. Two of the flyers we
met talked about how honored they
felt to be included in an original
cast for a Cirque du Soleil show.
"I feel so lucky to participate in
this show. Since we are the first cast,
we created it," said Sergei
Philleppenko.

Fellow flyer Roman Kharyrullin
agreed. "We have all gotten close,"
he said. "When we started to learn
the routines, all we knew was that
we were going to be beetles. Now
we have made it our own."
They discussed how they were
able to have some input and voice
as to how the show should be creat
ed. They admitted that the majority
of their life revolves around Cirque,
but had no qualms because they
loved to perform and are able to
travel to new places because of the
touring show. They claim that the
cast is somewhat of a family
because of all the time they spend
together.
Their time, along with the rest
of the cast and crew, is time well
spent. Cirque du Soleil shows, in
general, are always very profession
al, extreme, exciting and fun all
at the same time and "Ovo" is no
exception.
Andrew Corbett, assistant artis
tic director, said, "It had always
been a dream of mine to work for
Cirque du Soleil... After touring
all over the world for over 15 years,
I know there is nothing comparable
to Cirque. Nothing else is on this
level. I am so lucky to be a part of
this."
Now knowing how much effort
is put into the show, and also how
much time the performers spend
perfecting their acts, it is perfectly
clear why the shows are so incredi
ble. With the amount of work exe
cuted to create this show, the audi
ences' amazement is justified and
well deserved, and "Ovo'"s explo
ration of the creativity of insects is
nothing short of astonishing, and as
the French would say, merveilleux.

their feet. The precision and accura
cy of these performers was beyond
belief. Later in the show, a contor
tionist performs; not only is she
incredibly flexible and limber, but
she also pulls off stunts that show
case how she is unbelievably strong.
In a different act, a man performs
certain tricks on a tight rope,
including riding a unicycle! The
audience literally all had their jaws
dropped, remembering to breathe
only after applause for particularly
incredible tricks.
Before the show even started,
Intermission was given a backstage
exclusive look behind the scenes of
"Ovo." Our first stop was the cos
tume department, where we learned
that the show has over 600 cos
tumes, all of which get repaired and
washed every night! We then made
our way to the performers' area. It
was very interesting to see that most
of the performers were practicing
their routines; some were even
watching videos of themselves to
see how they could improve. It
seems that when they are not in
front of an audience, the performers
are trying to fine-tune their acts,
which means that most, if not all, of
their time is spent doing their
stunts. Entering the Big Top, we saw
the crew putting the stage and
props together.
We were even lucky enough to
get an interview with a few people
from the show. Two of the flyers we
met talked about how honored they
felt to be included in an original
cast for a Cirque du Soleil show.
"I feel so lucky to participate in
this show. Since we are the first cast,
we created it," said Sergei
Philleppenko.

Fellow flyer Roman Kharyrullin
agreed. "We have all gotten close,"
he said. "When we started to learn
the routines, all we knew was that
we were going to be beetles. Now
we have made it our own."
They discussed how they were
able to have some input and voice
as to how the show should be creat
ed. They admitted that the majority
of their life revolves around Cirque,
but had no qualms because they
loved to perform and are able to
travel to new places because of the
touring show. They claim that the
cast is somewhat of a family
because of all the time they spend
together.
Their time, along with the rest
of the cast and crew, is time well
spent. Cirque du Soleil shows, in
general, are always very profession
al, extreme, exciting and fun all
at the same time and "Ovo" is no
exception.
Andrew Corbett, assistant artis
tic director, said, "It had always
been a dream of mine to work for
Cirque du Soleil... After touring
all over the world for over 15 years,
I know there is nothing comparable
to Cirque. Nothing else is on this
level. I am so lucky to be a part of
this."
Now knowing how much effort
is put into the show, and also how
much time the performers spend
perfecting their acts, it is perfectly
clear why the shows are so incredi
ble. With the amount of work exe
cuted to create this show, the audi
ences' amazement is justified and
well deserved, and "Ovo'"s explo
ration of the creativity of insects is
nothing short of astonishing, and as
the French would say, merveilleux.
