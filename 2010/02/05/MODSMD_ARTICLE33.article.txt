When one thinks Nicolas
Sparks, more often
than not the buzz
words that pop up are 'romance,'
'cancer' and 'tragedy.' Movies like
"A Walk To Remember," "Nights
In Rodanthe" and, perhaps most
famously, "The Notebook," are all
film adaptations of our genera
tion's favorite romance author.
While teenage girls looking for a
sob story come out in droves for
all of these movies, hopefully this
review will steer them away from
the newest creation, "Dear John."
Starring Channing Tatum, of
"Step Up" and "G.I. Joe" fame,
and Amanda Seyfried ("Mamma
Mia!," "Mean Girls), this movie
tells the story of a modern-day
Romeo and Juliet torn apart by
school, the military and terrorism.
During a two-week
spring break, wide-eyed co-ed
Savannah falls hard for Special
Forces member John. Of course,
they fall in love. "Two weeks ...
that's all it took," Savannah writes
later in the movie. Their whirl
wind vacation reveals not one, but
two autistic characters (one of
which is John's father, unbe
knownst to John) and an undying
commitment to each other. They
say goodbye, with John returning
to duty post-9/11 and Savannah
to school. They promise to write
each other every single day for the
year they are apart.
If the movie sounds dull
until this point, the rest is expo
nentially more boring. The story
is not nearly enough to sustain

two hours of on-screen interest,

and both Tatum and Seyfried are
absolutely cringe-worthy to
watch. Of course, in true Nicholas
Sparks fashion, the war, separa
tion and mental illness aren't
enough. Cancer, death and heart
break all sprinkle the latter half of
the movie, making the outcome
seem almost laughable, despite
the attempt to be a tear-jerker.
After seeing their film,
Intermission had the chance to sit
down with both Channing Tatum
(his body is literally the only rea
son to see this movie) and
Amanda Seyfried to talk about
their project. Here are some of the
highlights of the interview:
Intermission(i): How did you
relate to the character of
Savannah? Did you meet with any
wives or girlfriends of military
men to try and empathize with
the role?
Amanda Seyfriend(AS): No,
I didn't, but I have been in a long
distance relationship for a while.
It's not easy, it's very severe. I
could understand because for
John, his duty and his career take
priority. In my life, sometimes my
career takes priority. I could iden
tify with how much she misses
John.
i: Did you read the novel when
you signed on for the film?
AS: I didn't, actually. I wanted to
stick with the script, because the
novel dives so deep into the char
acters, and they are so different. I

wanted to sort of create it for
myself. I feel like Savannah is
much more relatable in the
screenplay. I still haven't read the
book, and I don't feel like I need
to.
V How has making this film
changed your personal and pro
fessional life?
AS:I am definitely a romantic
person. I love spending time in
nature, traveling and seeing the
world. I absolutely love my family.
Filming in North Carolina was a
huge blessing; it allowed the
capacity for me to be inspired.
Channing and I would play

around when filming it taught
us to just accept our emotions. He
is the ultimate co-star. Working
with him showed me that you
can't take yourself too seriously.
i: Did you have any favorite
scenes from the movie?

Channing Tatum(CT): I real
ly enjoyed filming the hospital
scene, after my dad has a stroke
and I'm returning from
Afghanistan. It was such a person
al scene, and filming with Richard
[who plays his father] just ripped
my heart out. In contrast, I love
the scene where I'm tickling
Amanda on the bed. It was so

natural, and really embodied our
relationship.
i: You play a lot of characters in
the military ("StopLoss"G.l.
Joe"). What attracts you to these
characters?
CT: "G.I. Joe" isn't really military.
That is just a guy with a machine
gun. "Stop Loss" was a lot more
like this one. To prepare, I spent a
week in boot camp where I was
just surrounded by soldiers. Just
because I play a soldier though,
I'll never ever know what it is like.
You can read as much as you
want, watch as much as you want
you just aren't going to know.
Soldiers are just normal people
under extraordinary circum
stances. It's heartbreaking that
people can't understand what
they are going through. In "Dear
John," these two kids fall in love,
which just happens, and the fact
that John is in the military makes
things so much harder. These
things actually happen.
