## BRUINS EDGE CARDINAL IN TOUGH ROAD LOSS 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Add another note to the Cardinal men's sea
son-long list of near misses.
A seesaw second half begat a late UCLA run
and a subsequent Stanford comeback that the
Cardinal (10-12,4-6 Pac-10) could not complete.
The Bruins (11-11, 6-4) won, 77-73, at Pauley
Pavilion on Thursday night. With the win, UCLA
moved into a four-way tie for first place in the
conference.
Senior Landry Fields scored a career-high 35
points on 13-of-18 shooting to go along with 10
rebounds, and sophomore Jeremy Green added
18 points albeit on 37.5-percent shooting
but additional offensive help was hard to find.
No bench players scored, and the remaining
starters combined for just 21 points.
The game was a study in contrasts. Stanford,
as it has so often this year, relied almost entirely
on Fields and Green, with the former tallying his
third straight 30-point game. Sophomore Jarrett
Mann scored the Cardinal's first and last baskets
of the game (both threes), but otherwise added
just one point. Classmates Jack Trotter and
Matei Daian failed to create any inside presence.
Stanford played without sophomore forward
Andrew Zimmermann, whose earliest return
date from his stress fracture was set for this
week.
Regardless, on the UCLA side, even as Tyler
Honeycutt neared a triple-double he finished
with 12 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists
the rest of his teammates remained productive.

NOTES ! Stanford's road woes continued last
night as it fell to UCLA, which it had beaten
earlier in the season at Maples Pavilion. The
Cardinal fell to 4-6 in the Pac-10, just out of
last place. It will look to senior Landry Fields
to provide the bulk of the scoring on Satur
day at USC, which defeated Cal on Thurs
day 66-63.

bench, and Michael Roll and Nikola
Dragovic netted 16 and 15, respec
tively. Even Malcolm Lee, who had
eight points on just 2-9 shooting,
played an integral role with his dead
eye free throw shots down the stretch.
Every Bruin who played scored, and
UCLA only turned the ball over five
times, a point that their head coach,
Ben Howland, emphasized in his
post-game press conference.
Stanford remains winless on the
road in Pac-10 play and has not won
a game away from Maples in its past
nine attempts.
"We get a little bit out of our com
fort level on the road," Fields said.
The Cardinal led 60-54 with just
under eight minutes remaining when
UCLA tore off an 11-0 run to open
up a five-point advantage with just
over four minutes to play.
"They executed well and had a lot
of second-chance opportunities on
that run," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "They made key plays
down the stretch."
With the Bruins extending their
lead, Stanford did what it does best:
rode Fields to a close finish. He
scored eight of the next 10 Cardinal
points to bring UCLA's lead down to
one with a minute to play.
"Landry Fields is a load," How
land said. "I told everybody he was an
NBA player going into the season."
"If I came up with zero points and
11 turnovers, and we came up with a
win, I'd take it," Fields said.
Stanford appeared to luck out on
the next possession when Reeves
Nelson missed both of his free throws
a rare occurrence for the Bruins,
as they nailed all but four of their last
16 foul shot attempts but Honey
cutt was able to corral Nelson's sec
ond miss. A subsequent foul on Mal
colm Lee led to a three-point Bruins
lead with 24 seconds to play. On the
Cardinal's next possession. Green hit
a long two-pointer and was hit in the
process, giving Stanford the chance
to tie the game. But the officials whis

tied the foul before the shot, negating
Green's bucket. The ensuing in
bounds pass went back to Green,
who immediately hoisted from be
yond the arc; his attempt was off the
mark.

The immediate fouls that fol
lowed did the Cardinal no good, as
UCLA hit all of their remaining tries
from the charity stripe. Mann, who
guided the offense well down the
stretch, was able to keep the game in
teresting with a desperation-three
pointer that kept the margin close,
but Stanford simply ran out of time.
"You could feel they picked up
their intensity and they executed
down the stretch," Fields said.

The loss was yet another in a line

of close defeats Stanford has
dropped four games by less than four
points each, not including an over
time loss to Kentucky earlier in the
season.

"We have to be able to with
stand," Dawkins said.

The Cardinal must rebound
quickly, as the team will face USC at
the Galen Center on Saturday. Stan
ford defeated the Trojans in its clos
est victory of the season a one
point win at Maples in early January

but USC defeated conference
leader Cal on Thursday night.
Tip-off is set for 4:30 p.m.

a long two-pointer and was hit in the
process, giving Stanford the chance
to tie the game. But the officials whis

tied the foul before the shot, negating
Green's bucket. The ensuing in
bounds pass went back to Green,
who immediately hoisted from be
yond the arc; his attempt was off the
mark.

The immediate fouls that fol
lowed did the Cardinal no good, as
UCLA hit all of their remaining tries
from the charity stripe. Mann, who
guided the offense well down the
stretch, was able to keep the game in
teresting with a desperation-three
pointer that kept the margin close,
but Stanford simply ran out of time.
"You could feel they picked up
their intensity and they executed
down the stretch," Fields said.

The loss was yet another in a line

of close defeats Stanford has
dropped four games by less than four
points each, not including an over
time loss to Kentucky earlier in the
season.

"We have to be able to with
stand," Dawkins said.

The Cardinal must rebound
quickly, as the team will face USC at
the Galen Center on Saturday. Stan
ford defeated the Trojans in its clos
est victory of the season a one
point win at Maples in early January

but USC defeated conference
leader Cal on Thursday night.
Tip-off is set for 4:30 p.m.

Add another note to the Cardinal men's sea

A seesaw second half begat a late UCLA run
and a subsequent Stanford comeback that the
Cardinal (10-12,4-6 Pac-10) could not complete.
The Bruins (11-11, 6-4) won, 77-73, at Pauley
Pavilion on Thursday night. With the win, UCLA
moved into a four-way tie for first place in the
conference.
Senior Landry Fields scored a career-high 35
points on 13-of-18 shooting to go along with 10
rebounds, and sophomore Jeremy Green added
18 points albeit on 37.5-percent shooting
but additional offensive help was hard to find.
No bench players scored, and the remaining
starters combined for just 21 points.
The game was a study in contrasts. Stanford,
as it has so often this year, relied almost entirely
on Fields and Green, with the former tallying his
third straight 30-point game. Sophomore Jarrett
Mann scored the Cardinal's first and last baskets
of the game (both threes), but otherwise added
just one point. Classmates Jack Trotter and
Matei Daian failed to create any inside presence.
Stanford played without sophomore forward
Andrew Zimmermann, whose earliest return
date from his stress fracture was set for this
week.
Regardless, on the UCLA side, even as Tyler
Honeycutt neared a triple-double he finished
with 12 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists

NOTES ! Stanford's road woes continued last
night as it fell to UCLA, which it had beaten
earlier in the season at Maples Pavilion. The
Cardinal fell to 4-6 in the Pac-10, just out of
last place. It will look to senior Landry Fields
to provide the bulk of the scoring on Satur
day at USC, which defeated Cal on Thurs
day 66-63.

Dragovic netted 16 and 15, respec
tively. Even Malcolm Lee, who had
eight points on just 2-9 shooting,
played an integral role with his dead
eye free throw shots down the stretch.
Every Bruin who played scored, and
UCLA only turned the ball over five
times, a point that their head coach,
Ben Howland, emphasized in his
post-game press conference.
Stanford remains winless on the
road in Pac-10 play and has not won
a game away from Maples in its past
nine attempts.
"We get a little bit out of our com
fort level on the road," Fields said.
The Cardinal led 60-54 with just
under eight minutes remaining when
UCLA tore off an 11-0 run to open
up a five-point advantage with just
over four minutes to play.
"They executed well and had a lot
of second-chance opportunities on
that run," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "They made key plays
down the stretch."
With the Bruins extending their
lead, Stanford did what it does best:
rode Fields to a close finish. He
scored eight of the next 10 Cardinal
points to bring UCLA's lead down to
one with a minute to play.
"Landry Fields is a load," How
land said. "I told everybody he was an
NBA player going into the season."
"If I came up with zero points and
11 turnovers, and we came up with a
win, I'd take it," Fields said.
Stanford appeared to luck out on
the next possession when Reeves
Nelson missed both of his free throws
a rare occurrence for the Bruins,
as they nailed all but four of their last
16 foul shot attempts but Honey
cutt was able to corral Nelson's sec
ond miss. A subsequent foul on Mal
colm Lee led to a three-point Bruins
lead with 24 seconds to play. On the
