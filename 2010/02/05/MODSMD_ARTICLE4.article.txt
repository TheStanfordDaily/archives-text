## BRUINS EDGE CARDINAL IN TOUGH ROAD LOSS 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Add another note to the Cardinal men's sea
son-long list of near misses.
A seesaw second half begat a late UCLA run
and a subsequent Stanford comeback that the
Cardinal (10-12,4-6 Pac-10) could not complete.
The Bruins (11-11, 6-4) won, 77-73, at Pauley
Pavilion on Thursday night. With the win, UCLA
moved into a four-way tie for first place in the
conference.
Senior Landry Fields scored a career-high 35
points on 13-of-18 shooting to go along with 10
rebounds, and sophomore Jeremy Green added
18 points albeit on 37.5-percent shooting
but additional offensive help was hard to find.
No bench players scored, and the remaining
starters combined for just 21 points.
The game was a study in contrasts. Stanford,
as it has so often this year, relied almost entirely
on Fields and Green, with the former tallying his
third straight 30-point game. Sophomore Jarrett
Mann scored the Cardinal's first and last baskets
of the game (both threes), but otherwise added
just one point. Classmates Jack Trotter and
Matei Daian failed to create any inside presence.
Stanford played without sophomore forward
Andrew Zimmermann, whose earliest return
date from his stress fracture was set for this
week.
Regardless, on the UCLA side, even as Tyler
Honeycutt neared a triple-double he finished
with 12 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists
the rest of his teammates remained productive.
Reeves Nelson led UCLA with 18 points off the

NOTES ! Stanford's road woes continued last
night as it fell to UCLA, which it had beaten
earlier in the season at Maples Pavilion. The
Cardinal fell to 4-6 in the Pac-10, just out of
last place. It will look to senior Landry Fields
to provide the bulk of the scoring on Satur
day at USC, which defeated Cal on Thurs
day 66-63.
