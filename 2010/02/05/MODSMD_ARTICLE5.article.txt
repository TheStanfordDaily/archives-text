# ELBOWED OUT
## Cardinal crushes UCLA by 21 in rout 
### NATE ADAMS TOM TAYLOR 
Last night, No. 2 Stanford battled to a
74-53 win against UCLA, which is tied
for second place in the conference.
Meanwhile, across the Bay, Cal downed
USC 61-55 to give the Cardinal a three
game cushion for the second half of the
season.

The biggest headlines of the game
came from senior center Jayne Appel,
who hit season highs in both points and
rebounds with 23 points and 13 re
bounds. She was then ejected from the
game after a tussle with UCLA sopho
more forward Jasmine Dixon.

Early on, Stanford (20-1, 10-0 Pac
-10) remained competitive with the Bru
ins (14-7, 7-3) largely by going inside
and taking high-percentage shots. Near
ly all of the Cardinal's points from the
field (14 of 20 in the first half) came
from layups and jumpers in the paint, a
marked departure from last Saturday's
outing against Arizona, when Stanford
went 5-22 from the perimeter in the first
half alone. Last night, the Cardinal took
just one shot from beyond the arc be
fore halftime.

After a disappointing zero points
against Arizona last Saturday, senior
guard Roslyn Gold-Onwude broke the
tie in impressive style to get the crowd
going. She leapt under the hoop to re
bound Appel's missed layup, before
twisting around and netting the ball her
self. This brought the Cardinal alive, and

NOTES: No. 2 Stanford continued its domi
nation of the Pac-10 with a rout of UCLA.
The Cardinal have now won 41 straight
games at Maples Pavilion. Senior center
Jayne Appel led Stanford in scoring with
23 points. On Sunday, the Cardinal will
take on USC, which lost to Cal 61 -55 last
night.

Senior Jayne Appel powered Stanford to a big win over UCLA,
which is currently second in the Pac-10. Appel was ejected near the
end of the game for elbowing a Bruin during a struggle for a re-bound.
it went on a run to finish the first five
minutes 11-2 ahead.

Playing a physical game, the Bru
ins committed 13 personal fouls in
the first half, giving Stanford a
penalty bonus with nearly six min
utes remaining. The Cardinal
women seized these opportunities,
going 16 of 19 from the line, includ
ing 5-6 and 8-9 performances by
junior guard Jeannette Pohlen and
Appel, respectively.

In L.A. the Bruins had trailed by
16 points at the break, and after
clawing their way back to take tem
porary leads in the first period here,
they would have headed to the lock
ers feeling confident.
An early jumper by Dixon in the
second half narrowed the gap to two,
but that would be the closest UCLA
would get as the Cardinal built an
unassailable lead.

Everything looked like it was
going to be a great night for Stan
ford, with both Gold-Onwude and
Pohlen posting impressive totals
and, most importantly, a return to
form for Appel in one of her last Pac
-10 home games. But then Appel rose

to catch a rebound from a UCLA
shot and battled with the two UCLA
players pressing her. The referees
blew for a foul and went to review
the video.

For a while, it had looked like the
Bruins would be the team to suffer
with foul trouble, making a game
total of 26 to Stanford's 10. However,
a flagrant foul was ruled against
Appel for use of her elbow and she
was ejected from the game.
"On the play when Appel got the
rebound, we had plausible reason to
believe the contact was excessive or
severe in nature," said official crew
chief Scott Yarborough. "As we re
viewed the monitor, we found the
contact was excessive. Her elbow
caught [Dixon] in the face."

The crowd was on its feet and the
atmosphere in the stands turned
nasty.

Seconds later Gold-Onwude was
brought down by junior guard
Darxia Morris as she had a clear
lane to the basket, which put the
crowd right on edge and made
Maples a tough place to play for
both sides.

After the dust had finally settled,
and the game was over, the players
explained what happened in their
own words.

"I wasn't intentionally trying to
be flagrant," Appel said. "I was just
playing basketball."
"I think in every basketball
game, there will be plays where you
don't necessarily agree with the foul
call, but I agree with [head coach]
Tara [VanDerveer] and I think it
was a great win for us," Appel con
tinued. "I think it was just a heavy
weight game the whole way
through. Right now I'm just [want
ing] to know if I'll be able to play
against USC."
Unhurt, Dixon said that she had
no hard feelings about the play.
"Appel was just trying to get the
rebound and clear the board, and I
just happened to be in the wrong
place at the wrong time," Dixon
said. "I don't think she meant any
thing by it. Because, like coach said,
she's a great player and she would
n't try to hurt anybody. So I don't
think it was intentional."

The good news for the Cardinal
is that the Pac-10 reviewed the call

immediately after the game and de
clared that no further action will be
taken against Appel, allowing the
team to concentrate on the bright
points of a tough match.
"[At] the beginning of the game,
we took some ill-advised shots and
we had a couple turnovers and a
couple bad shots," VanDerveer said.
"But the second half was our kind of
game. I'm really excited about how
people came out and we battled and
got the shots that we wanted and
went inside . . . I'm so excited about
how our seniors are stepping up and
leading the way with their play."

Now the Cardinal will look for
ward to USC on Sunday, where it
could rack up its 42nd straight home
victory and Appel could write her
name in Stanford history by break
ing the school career rebounds
record set by Nicole Powell in 2004.
Tipoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.

NOTES: No. 2 Stanford continued its domi
nation of the Pac-10 with a rout of UCLA.
The Cardinal have now won 41 straight
games at Maples Pavilion. Senior center
Jayne Appel led Stanford in scoring with
23 points. On Sunday, the Cardinal will
take on USC, which lost to Cal 61 -55 last
night.

Senior Jayne Appel powered Stanford to a big win over UCLA,
which is currently second in the Pac-10. Appel was ejected near the
end of the game for elbowing a Bruin during a struggle for a re-bound.
it went on a run to finish the first five
minutes 11-2 ahead.

Playing a physical game, the Bru
ins committed 13 personal fouls in
the first half, giving Stanford a
penalty bonus with nearly six min
utes remaining. The Cardinal
women seized these opportunities,
going 16 of 19 from the line, includ
ing 5-6 and 8-9 performances by
junior guard Jeannette Pohlen and
Appel, respectively.

In L.A. the Bruins had trailed by
16 points at the break, and after
clawing their way back to take tem
porary leads in the first period here,
they would have headed to the lock
ers feeling confident.
An early jumper by Dixon in the
second half narrowed the gap to two,
but that would be the closest UCLA
would get as the Cardinal built an
unassailable lead.

Everything looked like it was
going to be a great night for Stan
ford, with both Gold-Onwude and
Pohlen posting impressive totals
and, most importantly, a return to
form for Appel in one of her last Pac
-10 home games. But then Appel rose

to catch a rebound from a UCLA
shot and battled with the two UCLA
players pressing her. The referees
blew for a foul and went to review
the video.

For a while, it had looked like the
Bruins would be the team to suffer
with foul trouble, making a game
total of 26 to Stanford's 10. However,
a flagrant foul was ruled against
Appel for use of her elbow and she
was ejected from the game.
"On the play when Appel got the
rebound, we had plausible reason to
believe the contact was excessive or
severe in nature," said official crew
chief Scott Yarborough. "As we re
viewed the monitor, we found the
contact was excessive. Her elbow
caught [Dixon] in the face."

The crowd was on its feet and the
atmosphere in the stands turned
nasty.

Seconds later Gold-Onwude was
brought down by junior guard
Darxia Morris as she had a clear
lane to the basket, which put the
crowd right on edge and made
Maples a tough place to play for
both sides.

After the dust had finally settled,
and the game was over, the players
explained what happened in their
own words.

"I wasn't intentionally trying to
be flagrant," Appel said. "I was just
playing basketball."
"I think in every basketball
game, there will be plays where you
don't necessarily agree with the foul
call, but I agree with [head coach]
Tara [VanDerveer] and I think it
was a great win for us," Appel con
tinued. "I think it was just a heavy
weight game the whole way
through. Right now I'm just [want
ing] to know if I'll be able to play
against USC."
Unhurt, Dixon said that she had
no hard feelings about the play.
"Appel was just trying to get the
rebound and clear the board, and I
just happened to be in the wrong
place at the wrong time," Dixon
said. "I don't think she meant any
thing by it. Because, like coach said,
she's a great player and she would
n't try to hurt anybody. So I don't
think it was intentional."

The good news for the Cardinal
is that the Pac-10 reviewed the call

immediately after the game and de
clared that no further action will be
taken against Appel, allowing the
team to concentrate on the bright
points of a tough match.
"[At] the beginning of the game,
we took some ill-advised shots and
we had a couple turnovers and a
couple bad shots," VanDerveer said.
"But the second half was our kind of
game. I'm really excited about how
people came out and we battled and
got the shots that we wanted and
went inside . . . I'm so excited about
how our seniors are stepping up and
leading the way with their play."

Now the Cardinal will look for
ward to USC on Sunday, where it
could rack up its 42nd straight home
victory and Appel could write her
name in Stanford history by break
ing the school career rebounds
record set by Nicole Powell in 2004.
Tipoff is scheduled for 1 p.m.

Last night, No. 2 Stanford battled to a
74-53 win against UCLA, which is tied
for second place in the conference.
Meanwhile, across the Bay, Cal downed
USC 61-55 to give the Cardinal a three
game cushion for the second half of the
season.

The biggest headlines of the game
came from senior center Jayne Appel,
who hit season highs in both points and
rebounds with 23 points and 13 re
bounds. She was then ejected from the
game after a tussle with UCLA sopho
more forward Jasmine Dixon.

Early on, Stanford (20-1, 10-0 Pac
-10) remained competitive with the Bru
ins (14-7, 7-3) largely by going inside
and taking high-percentage shots. Near
ly all of the Cardinal's points from the
field (14 of 20 in the first half) came
from layups and jumpers in the paint, a
