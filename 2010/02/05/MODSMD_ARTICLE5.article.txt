## Cardinal crushes UCLA by 21 in rout 
### NATE ADAMS TOM TAYLOR 
Last night, No. 2 Stanford battled to a
74-53 win against UCLA, which is tied
for second place in the conference.
Meanwhile, across the Bay, Cal downed
USC 61-55 to give the Cardinal a three
game cushion for the second half of the
season.

The biggest headlines of the game
came from senior center Jayne Appel,
who hit season highs in both points and
rebounds with 23 points and 13 re
bounds. She was then ejected from the
game after a tussle with UCLA sopho
more forward Jasmine Dixon.

Early on, Stanford (20-1, 10-0 Pac
-10) remained competitive with the Bru
ins (14-7, 7-3) largely by going inside
and taking high-percentage shots. Near
ly all of the Cardinal's points from the
field (14 of 20 in the first half) came
from layups and jumpers in the paint, a
marked departure from last Saturday's
outing against Arizona, when Stanford
went 5-22 from the perimeter in the first
half alone. Last night, the Cardinal took
just one shot from beyond the arc be
fore halftime.

After a disappointing zero points
against Arizona last Saturday, senior
guard Roslyn Gold-Onwude broke the
tie in impressive style to get the crowd
going. She leapt under the hoop to re
bound Appel's missed layup, before
twisting around and netting the ball her
self. This brought the Cardinal alive, and
