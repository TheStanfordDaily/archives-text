## TOP-20 RECRUIT HAUL BREAKING DOWN STANFORD'S CLASS OF 2010 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the wake of national signing day,
The Daily asked Matt Squeri 'O6, a re
cruiting analyst for The Bootleg, a
Stanford-centric Scout.com affiliate,
for his rapid reaction to the Cardinal's
2010 haul. Read on for his answers on
sleepers, impact players and areas of
improvement for future classes.
The Stanford Daily(TSD): What are
your general thoughts on the class?
Who are the sleepers? Which guys
should Cardinal fans keep an eye on?
Matt Squeri(MS): The 2010 recruiting
class was a strong one for Stanford that
continues the work coach Jim Har
baugh and his staff did with the 2009
recruiting class in improving the over
all talent on the roster. The Cardinal
faced major needs at offensive line and
linebacker, and did an adequate job filling those needs,
though both will remain recruiting priorities for next year
because the Cardinal still lacks strong quantity at those po
sitions.
The class is especially notable for its overall depth from
top to bottom. Stanford reached on very few prospects
and filled the class almost entirely with players coveted by
multiple major programs. Middle linebacker Blake Lued
ers, running back Anthony Wilkerson, quarterback Brett
Nottingham, safety Devon Carrington and running back
Ricky Seale were all elite national prospects [generally re
garded as in the top 300 overall players in the nation], but
the class's depth makes it plausible for virtually anyone to
make a difference for Stanford.
With such a deep class it is hard to characterize anybody
as a sleeper, but linebacker Joe Hemschoot is a year
younger than his classmates and really burst onto the scene
as a senior. "Slash" quarterback Darren Daniel may be the
most mysterious player in the class and could play early for
Stanford as a wide receiver or "Wildcat" quarterback.
TSD: While Stanford did not land any major "whales," like
an Andrew Luck, it does appear that they've added high
ly rated talent at positions of need. Where do you rate this
class among Harbaugh's previous ones?
MS: I rate this class as Harbaugh's second best and also
the second best of any class signed in the last nine years by
Buddy Teevens, Walt Harris or Harbaugh. However, one's
perspective on the class depends on how one prioritizes
elite national recruits or outstanding depth. This class has
[fewer] elite players than last year in the view of
Scout.com or Rivals.com, but is so deep from top-to-bot
tom that it may end up providing the Cardinal with even
more help on Saturdays in the fall than last year's group.
No class is perfect. And while the 2009 group could have
done better with large linemen, the 2010 group could have
done better with wide receivers.
TSD: Which players do you see making an immediate im
pact?
MS: It is always very difficult to predict which players
will make an immediate impact. Defensive back is cur
rently a relatively deep position on the Stanford roster,
but Devon Carrington is such a hard-hitting and confi
dent talent that he may push for early playing time. Stan
ford returns proven depth at running back in Stepfan
Taylor, Tyler Gaffney and Jeremy Stewart. But Jim Har
baugh expects Anthony Wilkerson to insert himself in
the mix as a freshman in the way Taylor and Gaffney did
this past fall. Blake Lueders, as the most highly touted
player in the class and one who plays a position of acute
need for Stanford, is probably the best bet in the class to
play as a freshman. Keanu Nelson and Ricky Seale are
versatile athletes who could be used as weapons on of
fense or depth on defense.
TSD: While the Cardinal's recruiting has certainly picked
up during Harbaugh's tenure, what are areas of improve
ment for the future?
MS: Stanford needs to recruit the physically biggest posi
tions on the field better. The last three classes combined
under Harbaugh have only provided the Cardinal with 10
players who reported weighing more than 260 pounds
coming out of high school. Positive early returns on some
athletic young offensive linemen on the roster and the
four quality offensive linemen Stanford signed on
Wednesday alleviate some of the concern on the offen
sive side of the ball.
But it remains a serious question who will man the mid
dle of the defensive line for Stanford once guys like Sione
Fua and Matthew Masifilo have completed their eligibili
ty. Strategically, Stanford faced an extremely complicated
task navigating the recruiting landscape this past year, as it
offered scholarships to over 200 players and had dozens of
players commit at one point or another. The staff can make
life easier for itself with some modifi
cations to its strategy. Nonetheless, the
overall strategy of expanding the pool
of recruits and aggressively courting
elite recruits from far-flung regions
serves as the core of the recruiting suc
cess the last two years and will almost
certainly continue.
