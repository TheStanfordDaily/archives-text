## Faculty Senate discusses cheating Profs, debate enforcement of Honor Code 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
A lengthy report and discussion of ongo
ing issues surrounding Stanford's Honor
Code dominated the Faculty Senate meeting
Thursday. Students, administrators and facul
ty members weighed in on the ongoing strug
gle to counter academic dishonesty fairly and
effectively, while presenting data about issues
of enforcement and student culture that star
tled some in the Academic Council.
The range of factors complicating the
enforcement of the Honor Code and the lack
of easy solutions to some of the problems
affecting it were the running theme of a range
of presentations. After more than an hour of
data and debate, Sunil Kumar, senior associ
ate dean of the Graduate School of Business,
concluded that these issues necessitated a sys
tematic review of Stanford's existing policies
comparing the need directly to the motives
underlying the Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES), also
announced at the meeting.
"One of the problems with the Honor
Code is the more broken it is, the less likely
you are to find that it's broken," Kumar said.
"And so therefore I think a systematic survey
is just called for, regardless of whether it's bro
ken or not."
To the extent that speakers agreed about
the nature of the problem of academic dis
honesty and its most effective solutions,
opinion converged in favor of fostering and
encouraging a student culture willing to

hold itself to high standards and possess
ing a clear understanding of faculty expecta
tions.
Computer science professor Eric Roberts
laid out the history of attempted evaluation
and revision of Honor Code policies, an ongo
ing negotiation between the preferences of
students and faculty members. He pointed in
particular to the importance of the 19905'
"Committee of 15," chaired by earth sciences
Prof. Mark Zoback, which preserved the prin
ciple of proof "beyond a reasonable doubt,"
but allowed for students to be found responsi
ble for a violation by the assent of only five
out of six Judicial Affairs panelists.
Following his remarks, Associate Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Christine Griffith
offered dramatic data about Honor Code vio
lations. She noted that in the 1999-2000 aca
demic year, the Office of Judicial Affairs han
dled 52 Honor Code cases, taking an average
of 83 days each. In 2008-2009, both the cases
and their average length of resolution had
increased: 123 cases, taking an average of 132
days to resolve.
Griffith's data also indicated that Honor
Code violations for unpermitted collabora
tion, the most frequent offense, made up 43
percent of cases. An additional 31 percent
involved plagiarism, 11 percent involved
copying work, five percent involved receiving
unpermitted aid and an additional five per
cent came from students representing others'
work as their own. The remaining five percent
represented other types of cases.
Griffith also broke down how the over

whelming majority of reported cases came
from the impetus of faculty members rather
than students or teaching assistants.
ASSU Undergraduate Senate Chair Varun
Sivaram 'll and GSC Co-Chair and law stu
dent Eric Osborne presented the results of a
student survey on attitudes toward the Honor
Code.
According to Sivaram, 55 percent of
undergraduates self-reported that they would
turn in a classmate for cheating compared to
62 percent of graduates.
Philosophy Prof. Kenneth Taylor strongly
criticized the reported numbers, expressing a
concern that they might disguise an even
more prevalent lack of reporting in practice,
stating that the University needed to "get
angry" about a culture of apathy among stu
dents.
Osborne discussed graduate student atti
tudes toward cheating. In particular, he
argued that graduate students serving as
teaching assistants felt unwilling to report
cheating from their students, out of a concern
that to raise an Honor Code issue would
annoy their academic advisers whose posi
tive opinion is a matter of significant concern
for most graduate students.
Humanities and Sciences
Prior to the spirited discussion of the
Honor Code, Richard Sailer, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences (H&S),
reported on his school's profile within the
University and its ongoing priorities.
H&S currently has the largest number of

"ladder" faculty in the University, more than
500 in total. While some faculty in attendance
expressed concern about the rate of hiring in
H&S, which slowed dramatically in the wake
of the University's budget cuts, Sailer said that
hiring remained the top priority of the school
and would pick up again when the proper
resources were in place. He pointed in partic
ular to pressing needs in South Asian and
Middle Eastern studies, an overall and ongo
ing weakness for the University despite the
efforts of current faculty members.

Encouraging news for the faculty search
were data indicating that the turbulent hiring
years of academic year 2007-08 to academic
year 2009-10 had seen an improvement in
both the University's faculty retention, and its
ability to lure away faculty from other institu
tions. The school looms even larger, however,
among the student population. Sailer noted
that 80 percent of undergraduate degrees at
the University are awarded from H&S. Sailer


XIN SHIN/The Stanford Daily
said, with evident pride, that 91 to 92
percent of undergraduates reported a
"good" or "excellent" experience
there, and reported an "excellent"
experience more frequently than at

peer institutions.
H&S also has approximately
2,000 doctoral students and 500 mas
ter's students. Sailer reiterated his
commitment to adding 50 graduate
fellowships to the school's resources.
The Faculty Senate is next sched
uled to meet on Feb. 18.
