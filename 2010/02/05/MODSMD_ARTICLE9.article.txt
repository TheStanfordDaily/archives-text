## Sexual assault judicial process under review SVAB raises concerns about sexual assault victims' experiences 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
A fuller picture is emerging of the University's efforts to
fix what some call a "broken" process for handling accusa
tions of rape among students.
An account released Thursday of a December meeting of
the Board on Judicial Affairs hints at a growing consensus
among those involved in Stanford's judicial system that the
process "does not benefit the victim, nor help the accused to
clear his name, nor does it protect the Stanford community
from predators."
That portrayal of the sexual assault adjudication process
comes from the minutes of the board's December meeting,
only the second set to be made public after the board began
releasing minutes in November.
The board is now months into consideration of a plan
they call an "alternative resolution process," which may fun
damentally change the way sexual assault complaints are
handled at Stanford.
As it stands, students who claim they are the victims of
campus sexual assault may file a complaint via the Office of
Judicial Affairs. The alleged offender â€”or "responding"
party, in judicial terminology then faces a Fundamental
Standard violation, which carries a variety of possible conse
quences, including expulsion.
But the number of sexual assault cases reported to police
here each year exceeds some at the meeting said far
exceeds the number of alleged victims who go on to pur
sue a Judicial Affairs case.
That is at least partly why, last spring, the campus Sexual
Violence Advisory Board (SVAB) and several individuals
began anew an effort to review the judicial process for sexu
al assault cases.
On Dec. 1, Laurette Beeson of the SVAB and Michele
Dauber, a law professor, spoke to the Board of Judicial
Affairs about what they see as a need for reform.
Dauber described her experience mentoring female stu
dents undergraduates, graduates and law students who
came to her alleging they had been sexually assaulted.
"In every case that I have been involved in, once the
alleged victim learned about the Judicial Affairs process, she
was extremely fearful and anxious," Dauber said in a copy of
her Dec. 1 comments provided to The Daily. "Those who
pressed ahead were incredulous that this was our process."
The major issue with the current system raised by Dauber
is that alleged victims must appear and participate in a panel
hearing with the alleged offender also present a practice
Dauber called "inhumane."
But as to what exactly the alternative process would look
like, those involved remain tight-lipped. Board co-chair Ben
Davidson, a law student, did say that a change in "sanctions,"
or punishments, for offenders would not be part of the alter
native process.
The board discussed the proposal again at its meeting this
week, and will again on Feb. 16, Davidson said. It could send
a recommendation to President Hennessy's desk by the end
of the quarter; Hennessy's approval would allow for a one
year pilot program for the alternative process.
A permanent change could require an amendment to the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997, which calls for approval by
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate, the Graduate Student
Council, the Faculty Senate and the University president.
