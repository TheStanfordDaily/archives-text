# Dancing the night (and day) away
## 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Early Saturday afternoon,
Dance Marathon first
timers and veterans alike
arrived at the Arrillaga
Alumni center. The new
comers were entirely unsure of what
to expect from the coming 24 hours of
the now-infamous around-the-clock
music and madness charity event.
Dancers in all kinds of attire, from
pragmatic marathoners in track shorts
and sneakers to more creative individ
uals in tutus and multi-colored span
dex, had begun to crowd the lobby in
anticipation of the 1 p.m. start time.
The energy filling the lobby was a
combination of nearly tangible adren
aline-fueled elation and equally pal
pable apprehension at the thought of
dancing or at the very least, stand
ing for a full 24 hours.
One continually cited motivation
for the full-day energy expenditure
was solidarity with the beneficiaries of
Dance Marathon's proceeds, primari
ly AIDS patients in developing
nations as well as Haitian victims of
the recent earthquake.
"I don't know how I'm going to do
this," one girl nervously told her
friends. "But it's for charity, right?"
The music coming from the direc
tion of the dance floor grew suddenly
louder, and they could hear the
pounding of dozens of maniacal
"moralers" drum-rolling on the floor
to announce the commencement of
the sixth annual Dance Marathon.
Suddenly, the doors to McCaw Hall
flew open and the many ranks of
dancers stampeded onto the dance
floor, yelling, laughing and busting
some serious moves.

In those first hours, they rocked,
grooved and boogied down to tracks
from across the decades, courtesy of
The Beatles and Lady Gaga.
Motivated by the cause and the
enthusiasm of flamboyantly-dressed
"moralers" students who signed up

to work in 3-hour shifts throughout
the event as dance floor motivators
they put aside the slowly growing
soreness in the dancers' feet and
pushed ahead.

One dedicated 24-hour moraler,
Elise Geithner 'l3, mentioned that
she'd brought practically an entire
wardrobe in preparation for a night of
costume changes.
At 5 p.m. the first (and only)
Dance Marathon casualty occurred
during a game of limbo, which broke
out under an impromptu limbo stick.
Four rounds in to the proceedings,
Kimmy Scheible 'l3, having just made
it through an impossibly low level,
ended up on the floor with a dislocat
ed knee. She didn't know how low she
could go. Stoic, high-spirited and still
sporting her tiara, Scheible was
removed from the marathon on a
stretcher and was unable to return to
the dance floor. Her comrades
though, progressed in her memory.
As the evening went on, tired
dancers began to filter out of the
room and fresh-faced, energetic late
comers arrived to replace them on the
floor. In an attempt to relax and
inspire the slowly fading dancers, DM
organizers brought in a huge variety

of student performing groups
throughout the marathon five a
cappella groups, dance performances
and lessons for anyone whose feet
weren't yet protesting too loudly, and
even an appearance by Wushu martial
arts, whose flips, flying kicks and
sword-wielding channeled Bruce Lee.
The period between 10 p.m. and 1
a.m. has earned a reputation for being
the highest energy shift of the event.
It's the time when hundreds of stu
dents who've exhausted their party
hopping options flood the dance floor
to support their friends and elevate
the mood for three intense (and intox
icated) hours of celebration.
Conversely, the following wee
hours of the morning were arguably
the hardest, as dancers struggled to
maintain enthusiasm in spite of throb
bing feet and knotted calves. These
were the hours when the coat check
room, initially a spot for quiet conver
sation and IHUM reading, became a
slumber party —at one point nine
dancers were asleep on their back
packs despite the anti-sitting rules.
This was also the time when a strange
and wonderful phenomenon
occurred. For all those dancers who've
been going at it like Energizer bun
nies for the past 12 hours, the once
new faces of the hardcore, 24-hour
dancers started to become familiar.

With all the rollercoaster-ing blood
sugar levels, diminishing numbers of
dancers on the floor, our ever-encour
aging moralers decided that 5:30 am
was the perfect time to bring in the big
guns: pillows. Why on earth would you
give pillows to people attempting to

stay awake and active for 24 hours?
A pillow fight, of course, set to
Pink's pump-up single "So What,"
seemed like just the thing to boost
adrenaline enough to make it through
the next six-and-a-half hours.
Unfortunately, a number of dancers
attempted to use these pillows for
more traditional purposes; napping
incidents increased exponentially in
that hour.

The final six hours of Dance
Marathon were some of the most
simultaneously painful and exhilarat
ing. As the sky slowly lightened to a
delicate periwinkle and a hearty,
quick-energy breakfast of bagels and
pastries arrived, all perception of time
and the past day seemed to vanish.
"Wait, that was yesterday?" mar
veled one student in the breakfast
line, astonished at the thought of hav
ing been on the dance floor for over
20 hours at that point.
Their feet hurt as badly as they
never had over the course of the past
day and night, and sugar crashes
abounded, but they forced their ener
gy levels up for the home stretch of
DM 2010. Even so, the exhaustion
even in those with a strong will to con
ceal it was evident.

They entered the home stretch: the
final half hour, the final fundraising total
over $174,000 for beneficiary
Partners In Health and a rousing
rendition of Europe's "The Final
Countdown." They celebrated the finale
at 1 p.m. on the dot to the LSJUMB, the
Tree and the Dollies cheering them on
with "All Right Now."
From their soles to their souls,

Dance Marathon definitely made an
impression on its participants, from
late night drop-in dancers to hardcore
24-hour marathoners to the dedicated
organizers behind it all.
"We're so honored to have worked
with all these fantastic directors, hack

ers, dancers and staff to put on the
best Dance Marathon yet," concluded
a tired Lia Bonamassa 'lO, one of the
DM directors. "See you next year!"

Early Saturday afternoon,
Dance Marathon first
timers and veterans alike
arrived at the Arrillaga
Alumni center. The new
comers were entirely unsure of what
to expect from the coming 24 hours of
the now-infamous around-the-clock
music and madness charity event.
Dancers in all kinds of attire, from
pragmatic marathoners in track shorts
and sneakers to more creative individ
uals in tutus and multi-colored span
dex, had begun to crowd the lobby in
anticipation of the 1 p.m. start time.
The energy filling the lobby was a
combination of nearly tangible adren
aline-fueled elation and equally pal
pable apprehension at the thought of
dancing or at the very least, stand
ing for a full 24 hours.
One continually cited motivation
for the full-day energy expenditure
was solidarity with the beneficiaries of
Dance Marathon's proceeds, primari
ly AIDS patients in developing
nations as well as Haitian victims of
the recent earthquake.
"I don't know how I'm going to do
this," one girl nervously told her
friends. "But it's for charity, right?"
The music coming from the direc
tion of the dance floor grew suddenly
louder, and they could hear the
pounding of dozens of maniacal
"moralers" drum-rolling on the floor
to announce the commencement of
the sixth annual Dance Marathon.
Suddenly, the doors to McCaw Hall
flew open and the many ranks of
dancers stampeded onto the dance
floor, yelling, laughing and busting
some serious moves.

In those first hours, they rocked,
grooved and boogied down to tracks
from across the decades, courtesy of
The Beatles and Lady Gaga.
Motivated by the cause and the
enthusiasm of flamboyantly-dressed
"moralers" students who signed up

to work in 3-hour shifts throughout
the event as dance floor motivators
they put aside the slowly growing
soreness in the dancers' feet and
pushed ahead.

One dedicated 24-hour moraler,
Elise Geithner 'l3, mentioned that
she'd brought practically an entire
wardrobe in preparation for a night of
costume changes.
At 5 p.m. the first (and only)
Dance Marathon casualty occurred
during a game of limbo, which broke
out under an impromptu limbo stick.
Four rounds in to the proceedings,
Kimmy Scheible 'l3, having just made
it through an impossibly low level,
ended up on the floor with a dislocat
ed knee. She didn't know how low she
could go. Stoic, high-spirited and still
sporting her tiara, Scheible was
removed from the marathon on a
stretcher and was unable to return to
the dance floor. Her comrades
though, progressed in her memory.
As the evening went on, tired
dancers began to filter out of the
room and fresh-faced, energetic late
comers arrived to replace them on the
floor. In an attempt to relax and
inspire the slowly fading dancers, DM
organizers brought in a huge variety

of student performing groups
throughout the marathon five a
cappella groups, dance performances
and lessons for anyone whose feet
weren't yet protesting too loudly, and
even an appearance by Wushu martial
arts, whose flips, flying kicks and
sword-wielding channeled Bruce Lee.
The period between 10 p.m. and 1
a.m. has earned a reputation for being
the highest energy shift of the event.
It's the time when hundreds of stu
dents who've exhausted their party
hopping options flood the dance floor
to support their friends and elevate
the mood for three intense (and intox
icated) hours of celebration.
Conversely, the following wee
hours of the morning were arguably
the hardest, as dancers struggled to
maintain enthusiasm in spite of throb
bing feet and knotted calves. These
were the hours when the coat check
room, initially a spot for quiet conver
sation and IHUM reading, became a
slumber party —at one point nine
dancers were asleep on their back
packs despite the anti-sitting rules.
This was also the time when a strange
and wonderful phenomenon
occurred. For all those dancers who've
been going at it like Energizer bun
nies for the past 12 hours, the once
new faces of the hardcore, 24-hour
dancers started to become familiar.

With all the rollercoaster-ing blood
sugar levels, diminishing numbers of
dancers on the floor, our ever-encour
aging moralers decided that 5:30 am
was the perfect time to bring in the big
guns: pillows. Why on earth would you
give pillows to people attempting to

stay awake and active for 24 hours?
A pillow fight, of course, set to
Pink's pump-up single "So What,"
seemed like just the thing to boost
adrenaline enough to make it through
the next six-and-a-half hours.
Unfortunately, a number of dancers
attempted to use these pillows for
more traditional purposes; napping
incidents increased exponentially in
that hour.

The final six hours of Dance
Marathon were some of the most
simultaneously painful and exhilarat
ing. As the sky slowly lightened to a
delicate periwinkle and a hearty,
quick-energy breakfast of bagels and
pastries arrived, all perception of time
and the past day seemed to vanish.
"Wait, that was yesterday?" mar
veled one student in the breakfast
