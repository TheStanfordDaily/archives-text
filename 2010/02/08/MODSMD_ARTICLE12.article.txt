## OP-ED Special Fees "Blunders"? More Like Misinformation and Sour Grapes 
### ZACHARY WARMA '11, ASSU Senator 
I would like to respond to last Friday's edi
torial ("Senate Blunders Special Fees
Bill"), but moreover the entire process
of special fees reform that the Senate has
undertaken this term. An unfortunate as
pect of ASSU's drive to preserve campus
life and protect students' wallets has been
the extraordinary amount of misinforma
tion that has been circulated. I will be the
first to admit the Special Fees system is ex
tremely complex. That, however, is not an
excuse to replace facts with fabrications.
First, to the bill in question that was
passed on January 12th; unlike the dracon
ian cap that " permits student groups to ask
only for an inflationary adjustment in their
budget " that the Daily conjured in a Feb. 2
article, the bill simply stipulates that any
student group that wants to ask for more
money over its previous year's budget must
come to us, the students, to petition to get
on the ballot. That's it. When in previous
years student groups were able to jack up
their budgets 10% plus inflation by only
asking Aprops, now if VSOs want more of
your money, then they have to petition.
This bill is part of our larger package of
reforms to address VSO budgetary respon
sibility and slash the refund rate. And that
is the thing- the bill is just a part of the
process. The Edit Board correctly notes
that the rising refund rate is tied to both in
creased fees and greater number of re
quests. They subsequently run off the cliff
by asserting that "the bill that does accom
plish its purported aim", a similar claim
made by that extremely fallacious petition
circulated by the Alternative Spring Break
Financial Officer. Really? The bill is meant
to force VSOs, when desiring to tax stu
dents more, to make their case to us. Stu
dent Groups are not getting budgets
capped, they are not being restricted from
money; they simply need to petition if they
desire substantial budget increases.
In regards to the lack of "transparency,"

the Daily's critiques are off the mark. Go to
the January 13 article, Senate moves on Spe
cial Fees, the story about the meeting in
which the bill was previous noticed to the
Senate and discussed for roughly 15 min
utes. Tell me where the VSO Special Fees
budget bill is mentioned. I'll save you the
hassle-it isn't. How can the Senate be trans
parent when the institution charged with
informing the campus fails in its mission?
From misstating the need for previous
noticing funding bills (last Tuesday's arti
cle), to the Edit Board claiming that there
are 1500 student organizations (nope) and
that less than two percent of financial offi
cers responded about these proposed
changes (60% of the 51 Special Fees groups
did respond), The Daily has not set the
record straight.
As a final note; I believe in the value of
transparency, and its necessity to support
ing truly democratic governance. While I
do personally wish that Financial Officers
had been given a few days more time on this
year's Special Fees policies, I will vocifer
ously defend the work of the Appropria
tions Committee, which has properly fol
lowed all procedures and has even gone
above and beyond in their work. Accusa
tions of back-door secrecy are patently ab
surd. All meetings are noted on the public
Senate list, which in my time at Stanford I
have never once heard The Daily refer to as
not public enough. For the first time ever,
this Appropriations committee has held
weekly public office hours for financial of
ficers. The vilification Anton and others
have received is misguided and simply
wrong. I will not deny there is still more we
can do, both in terms of publicity and re
forms. But I hope the Daily and thus the stu
dent body is adequately versed before rush
ing to judgments not entirely based on facts.
