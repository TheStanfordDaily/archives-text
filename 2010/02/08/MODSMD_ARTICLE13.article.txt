# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Title: Sincerely Yours 
### Emily Hulme 
Some of you may be aware of a neat little
feature the good people designing email
programs came up with a few years ago
to help you save time. It's called a signature,
and it saves a good 0.5 seconds per email. It's
not unlike the rubber stamps people once
used when they didn't have time to sign all
their letters. Or so I'm told.
At lesser institutions, perhaps students
use this to attach their name to the end of an
email. But, here, a name is simply not enough.
Standing alone, a name is a slippery thing, so
undefined. It's only a step away from ab
stracting your entire life into a number.
A horrible specter it would be, to only
refer to yourself by a name, unqualified by
any title or description. But, never fear
sensing that one line, two lines, six lines, might
not be sufficient space for a venerable Stan
ford student the prescient beings that
drafted this feature knew well enough to per
mit us to include various and sundry facts
about ourselves. No longer must the signed
name stand alone; it is accompanied by a ret
inue of qualifications.
Not to mention, it's simply a matter of free
expression.

However, I must don my advisory hat (it's
felt). I think we have exploited this feature
beyond the bounds of reason, sense, or even
sensibility. We've taken it not just too far, but
altogether in the wrong direction. Some peo
ple you know who you are publish only
a slightly abbreviated version of their resume
as a signature. Here's the deal: 99.99 percent
of people you will be emailing do not care
that you were a "Dance Marathon Partici
pant, 2007" or a member of the rock climbing
club. In fact, they will probably think you are
sort of ridiculous for including all this crap
about yourself. Take this from one who
knows: as a card-carrying member of the Bay
Area Sons of Norway and a Dance
Marathon, non-participant, 2010,1 asked my
friend who vaguely resembles Martha Stew
art what the proper etiquette was on includ
ing such feats. She replied, curtly: "Just no.
And pass the pastry bag, will you, dear?"
Lest you think I'm out to kill all the fun, I
do not mean to suggest we should reduce the
number of lines of personal biography on our
emails. This appendage is too important to
excise. Like a malfunctioning liver, we should
simply switch out the deficient style of email
signatures for a flashier type. I simply and
boldly suggest changing the content. Truth be
told, listing whatever clubs you are in and
what your major is does not do a great job of
describing who you are. And, so far as I am
aware, this is not supposed to be the place for

your resume. There are, so far, no rules for
what exactly should go beneath your name.
My suggestion? Actual biography. Not your
statistics.Take mine as an example:
Before: Emily Hulme, Stanford Universi
ty, Class of 2011, B.A.S. Candidate, Daily
Columnist, Amateur Playwright, Art Affair
Attendee, Sigma Chi Enthusiast.
After: E. Hulme, A Kindred Soul, To All
Who Might Study, at Stanford and also, a
Sparkling Water Connoisseur, Who Has
More Info Available on her Twitter, and
Never Uses Awkward Smileys in Texts.
Naturally, to get your point across, I think
it is rather imperative to retain the structure
of the antiquated form. It has a certain poet
ic quality. Indeed, it may very well be that
Greek lyric originally derives from these
fragmentary biographies. I think you will find
this a form of narrative that just pulses with
life. Experiment, and watch as your very
essence bubbles up through the disjointed
phrases which tell your story better than any
list of titles ever could.

Again, it's all about the freedom of ex
pression.

Armed with one of these signatures,
maybe your professor won't know that you
are an Exec for any given organization or a
Hum Bio major. In exchange, he'll know you
are either 1) stupid or 2) a hilarious maverick
who enjoys sparkling water. But, I would not
spend too many nights tossing and turning
worrying about the former. Progress, as you
know, demands risk, and this is a risk well
worth taking. One day, you can tell your
grandchildren about the time you walked up
hill both ways in the snow with no shoes to sit
down in front of the computer screen and
deleted the most boring possible account of
your life you could ever imagine and created
a whole new version of yourself, more accu
rate and more colorful, to show the world
that you truly are more than just a tired for
mula.

Emily would like to thank the illustrious
Samantha Penabad for inspiring this column.
