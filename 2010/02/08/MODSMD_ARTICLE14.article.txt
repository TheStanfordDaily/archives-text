# THE 						GAO REPORT
## Shared Governance Sham at Stanford 
### Shelley Gao 
At the Faculty Senate's Feb. 4 meeting
last Thursday, Provost John
Etchemendy announced the appoint
ment of an 18-member task force to pursue a
comprehensive review of Stanford's under
graduate education. The Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford (SUES) has
the potential to fundamentally transform the
intellectual experience at the Farm.
SUES seeks to re-examine and possibly
redefine Stanford's educational mission, and
provide recommendations regarding core
academic components like IHUM, PWR, In
troductory Seminars, and GERs. Underlying
the charge for the commission announced by
co-authors Etchemendy and Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John Bravman is
the need to best prepare students for active
citizenship in a world of "growing social, po
litical, economic and ecological intercon
nectedness."

The task force is composed of twelve fac
ulty members from various disciplines, four
administrators and two students. Wait. Was
there a public and widely advertised applica
tion inviting undergraduates to serve on this
taskforce?

So, who selected them? Why were they se
lected? What are their qualifications? These
questions do not center on the effectiveness
of the student representatives, but rather
concerns the undemocratic and opaque
process involved in their appointment. Nor
mally, the student-run ASSU Nominations
Commission is called upon to select students
for committees through an application and
interview process. It would appear that such
a democratic method was bypassed here.
Requiring student representation on uni
versity committees is founded upon the con
cept of shared governance at institutions of
higher education. Shared governance pro
vides different stakeholders away to have
their voice heard in the decision-making
process yet achieves a balance between max-

imizing participation and ensuring accounta
bility of the final outcome.
This concept of liberalizing governance
emerged in the 19605. It was affirmed in a
document entitled, "Statement on Govern
ment of Colleges and Universities," issued by
the American Association of University Pro
fessors, the American Council on Education,
and the Association of Governing Boards of
Universities and Colleges.

It is understandable that not all con
stituencies should be given an equal say in
every aspect of university policymaking. For
example, professors with expertise in their
fields are certainly more authoritative
sources at determining major requirements.
However, by paying $50,000 a year each in
their university bill, students have earned a
right in shaping issues related to academic
and campus life on the Farm. The student
voice cannot be discounted. More important
ly, transparency in selecting the student rep
resentation is crucial.

Passion for an issue does not singularly
warrant a place on committees that address
important matters in academic and campus
life. A peer-to-peer selection process is criti
cal to selecting students who are interested in
the issues and are capable of offering dissent
ing opinions in an often-intimidating setting
consisting of senior faculty and university
staff. This quality is inevitably jeopardized in
situations where administrators are responsi
ble for selecting the student representatives.

Admittedly, the task force on Under
graduate Education is at an early stage. No
doubt, it will be presented as a highly "inclu
sive" and "collaborative" process. Over the
next year or so, a series of town halls, open
forums, surveys and issue-driven "working
groups" will manifest. These activities will
imbue the findings legitimacy, justify their
implementation, and provide the ammuni
tion to crush potential discontent. This pat
tern of decision-making happens at almost
every organization small and large in
the world.

I guess I should not be so shocked. Two
years ago as a freshman, a tenured faculty
member, veteran of "university service" and
academic politics responded to my wide
eyed enthusiasm about propelling change
with an amused glance of pity. As an Under
graduate Senator, I read enlightening reflec
tions by student representatives on universi
ty committees lamenting their powerless
ness. In fact, some found the most useful part
of their experience was studying the tech
niques used by Committee Chairs to control
the agenda, and adroitly steer discussion to
wards predetermined outcomes.
Perhaps the root of the problem does not
lie with the institution. Indeed, why change
when you can get away with the status quo?
The real cause may lie with a largely apathet
ic and disengaged student body. Exerting an
influence in university policymaking does
not appear high in the priority list for already
over-committed students. However, it is im
perative to recognize that we are important
stakeholders at this University and we
should demand more to shape our Stanford
education and that of future generations of
Stanford students.
