# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
I thoroughly appreciate the new and re
freshing viewpoint presented on Friday
about the bright side of sex at Stanford.
Thank you for enlightening our campus as to
the sex solution to our problems. Feeling
down and unaccomplished? Need to boost
your weekend productivity? Or maybe you
just want to make unkempt in the a.m. a new
fashion statement? GET LAID. Not only
this, but you will be distinguished among
your red-eyed, sexless peers for your victori
ous triumph.
Taking away the shame in "walk of
shame" really puts the truth about sex out
there. Not only is it "calorie-free and guilt
free", but also it's a great workout. Sounds
like we've got a new fad diet on our hands!
Better call BeWell and start a campus-wide
campaign. The worst repercussions of sex re
ally are the sometimes loss of clothing (and
subsequent wearing of the American Flag,
who knew it was multifunctional!) and deal
ing with the intense jealousy your friends will
exhibit. Wait, these aren't repercussions, just
laughable moments and points of pride. Sex
has no consequences! I wish we could have
all known this earlier. But then that would
undermine the privilege of being in the Stan
ford Having-Sex minority. Let's not let
everyone in on this message too soon.
The sheer victory of sex is almost too
much for one to handle. Almost like passing
on the Olympic torch, walking back from
your "conquest" disheveled is a majestic and
life-changing act. As a Sex-ed Laureate, you
are crowned among your peers and bask in
the limelight of your victory. And it can last
more than fifteen minutes, this fame. Just
make sure your choice of co-conquerer lives
as far away on campus as possible. Then,
you'll not only get to strut by Green Library,
you might make it by Old Union and Lake
Lag too.
Let's face it: sex (and even bad sex) makes
us feel wonderful. And those "Oh shit!" mo
ments will be laughs by the next weekend
when you're out to conquer again. Who cares

if you don't remember your co-conquerers
name? Or wake up and don't remember any
thing but walking down the row towards the
party with your friends? Or may have lost
your wallet and car keys in the process? Your
name is forever engraved in the Sexed Stan
fordian history, which is kept right next to the

volumes of Accolades of Alcohol and Mov
ing Violations to Be Remembered. But those
are accomplishments to be considered an
other day.

Sincerely Changed by your Sex-ed,
ASHLEY ARTMANN 'l2
