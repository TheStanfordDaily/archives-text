## NEAR MISS Cardinal fall again in hard-fought loss to USC 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As near misses reach pandemic status for the Car
dinal men's basketball program, it is worth noting just
how close Stanford is to relative success.

Consider: in Saturday's 54-49 loss to USC (14-9,6-
5 Pac-10) at the Galen Center, the Cardinal (10-13,4-
7) had no post presence on either side of the court, suf
fered through an awful game from sophomore sharp
shooter Jeremy Green, and had few meaningful offen
sive contributions outside of senior forward Landry
Fields, who had 27 points.
And while no one will mistake the Trojans for ti
tans of eras past, the above does show that, even with
a depleted roster made up largely of walk-ons, Stan
ford can compete in a down Pac-10. Unfortunately for
the Cardinal, there is a large gap between winning and
doing just enough to lose. Although general expecta
tions were low for this season, after a team shows signs
of life, moral victories begin to fade. Yet it is still sur
prising that Stanford can compete with a conference
opponent, even when Fields accounts for 55 percent of
the team's production, no other player has more than
six points to his name and the Cardinal is severely lack
ing in entire parts of the sport.
Take Stanford's interior game, for instance. With
sophomore Andrew Zimmermann still recovering
from injury, the Cardinal's lack of ability in the paint
has been startling, with no better example than Satur
day's contest. Nikola Vucevic had 18 points and 14 re
bounds to lead the Trojans. He established himself at
will even sophomore Matei Daian, Stanford's best
post defender, could do little to slow him down.
And when the Cardinal had the ball, the physical duo
of Marcus Johnson and Leonard Washington prevent
ed the visitors from gaining any traction down low.
Sophomore forward Jack Trotter's six points came on
three-pointers, classmates Daian and Elliot Bullock
were held scoreless and both Trotter and Bullock blew
routine lay-ups. The end result? USC had 10 blocks;
Stanford had two. USC had 32 points in the paint;
Stanford had 12.
No sequence was more telling than the one result
ing in a Vucevic putback with 21 seconds remaining.
The Cardinal led 49-48, and seemed to be in position
to get the ball back after senior guard Drew Shiller
blocked Johnson's drive. But Johnson got his own re-

bound and, after he missed again, Vucevic was there
for the third chance opportunity, putting the Trojans
up for good. It was a visually stunning sequence: a
wall of white shirts preventing any Stanford players
from a shot at a rebound.

"Offensive rebounding down the stretch was big
for them," said head coach Johnny Dawkins. "They
had a chance to get a couple of putbacks that were
big."

The game played out in USC's favor from there.
Green missed a jumper he was 1-10 on the night
and Johnson, who was 0-3 from the line until that
point, made two foul shots to push the lead to 52-49.
With seven seconds left, the Trojans immediately
fouled to prevent a three-point attempt, and, after
Fields shanked his first attempt, the game was over.

That said, it is to the Cardinal's credit that it was in
a position to win to begin with. Stanford trailed 21-7
in the first half with Green on the bench because of
foul trouble, and sophomore point guard Jarrett
Mann also sitting for an extended period of time. But
the Cardinal proceeded to go on a 16-0 tear to take a
two-point lead.Trotter's two threes, the second giving
Stanford the advantage, were his first attempts and
makes from beyond the arc this year. The furious
comeback went almost until halftime, and USC's
early chances at pulling away were shot the Tro
jans led by just one at the half.
And yet, straight out of the locker room, USC went
on another streak, opening up an eight-point lead on
the back of Washington's defensive and offensive
prowess. But once again, the Cardinal fought back to
eventually open up a four-point advantage with under
eight minutes to play.
"We had them on the ropes twice and they never
quit," said USC head coach Kevin O'Neill. "We tried
to blow it."
The teams traded blows until Vucevic's fatal bas
ket, which kept the Cardinal winless on the road in
conference play and ensured that Stanford would
suffer just its second four-game losing streak in the

past 17 years.
Dawkins saw a silver lining.
"I thought our team played well in both [Satur
day's game and Thursday's 77-73 loss to UCLA]," he
said. "We were competitive. We didn't win either
game, but we were right in there. Under two minutes,
we were in one-possession games."
And so it is with the Stanford Cardinal: given the
conditions, losses cannot be viewed entirely negative
ly, but the same problems continue to persist. And yet,
at least in the immediate future, they may be alleviat
ed. Zimmermann could return this week, providing
the team with a post threat, and the Cardinal returns
to Maples, where all of the team's success has occurred
this season.

Stanford sits in last place in the Pac-10, but just
three games out of first. The Cardinal has shown it can
compete, and now, with conference play winding
down, it is time to finish.

day's contest. Nikola Vucevic had 18 points and 14 re
bounds to lead the Trojans. He established himself at
will even sophomore Matei Daian, Stanford's best
post defender, could do little to slow him down.
And when the Cardinal had the ball, the physical duo
of Marcus Johnson and Leonard Washington prevent
ed the visitors from gaining any traction down low.
Sophomore forward Jack Trotter's six points came on
three-pointers, classmates Daian and Elliot Bullock
were held scoreless and both Trotter and Bullock blew
routine lay-ups. The end result? USC had 10 blocks;
Stanford had two. USC had 32 points in the paint;
Stanford had 12.
No sequence was more telling than the one result
ing in a Vucevic putback with 21 seconds remaining.
The Cardinal led 49-48, and seemed to be in position
to get the ball back after senior guard Drew Shiller
blocked Johnson's drive. But Johnson got his own re-

bound and, after he missed again, Vucevic was there
for the third chance opportunity, putting the Trojans
up for good. It was a visually stunning sequence: a
wall of white shirts preventing any Stanford players
from a shot at a rebound.

"Offensive rebounding down the stretch was big
for them," said head coach Johnny Dawkins. "They
had a chance to get a couple of putbacks that were
big."

The game played out in USC's favor from there.
Green missed a jumper he was 1-10 on the night
and Johnson, who was 0-3 from the line until that
point, made two foul shots to push the lead to 52-49.
With seven seconds left, the Trojans immediately
fouled to prevent a three-point attempt, and, after
Fields shanked his first attempt, the game was over.

That said, it is to the Cardinal's credit that it was in
a position to win to begin with. Stanford trailed 21-7
in the first half with Green on the bench because of
foul trouble, and sophomore point guard Jarrett
Mann also sitting for an extended period of time. But
the Cardinal proceeded to go on a 16-0 tear to take a
two-point lead.Trotter's two threes, the second giving
Stanford the advantage, were his first attempts and
makes from beyond the arc this year. The furious
comeback went almost until halftime, and USC's
early chances at pulling away were shot the Tro
jans led by just one at the half.
And yet, straight out of the locker room, USC went
on another streak, opening up an eight-point lead on
the back of Washington's defensive and offensive
prowess. But once again, the Cardinal fought back to
eventually open up a four-point advantage with under
eight minutes to play.
"We had them on the ropes twice and they never
quit," said USC head coach Kevin O'Neill. "We tried
to blow it."
The teams traded blows until Vucevic's fatal bas
ket, which kept the Cardinal winless on the road in
conference play and ensured that Stanford would
suffer just its second four-game losing streak in the

past 17 years.
Dawkins saw a silver lining.
"I thought our team played well in both [Satur
day's game and Thursday's 77-73 loss to UCLA]," he
said. "We were competitive. We didn't win either
game, but we were right in there. Under two minutes,
we were in one-possession games."
And so it is with the Stanford Cardinal: given the
conditions, losses cannot be viewed entirely negative
ly, but the same problems continue to persist. And yet,
at least in the immediate future, they may be alleviat
ed. Zimmermann could return this week, providing
the team with a post threat, and the Cardinal returns
to Maples, where all of the team's success has occurred
this season.

Stanford sits in last place in the Pac-10, but just
three games out of first. The Cardinal has shown it can
compete, and now, with conference play winding
down, it is time to finish.

losing to UCLA by four, Stanford dropped a close
five-point game to the Trojans, marking Stanford's
