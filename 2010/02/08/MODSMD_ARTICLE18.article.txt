# The
						American Holiday

### Daniel Bohm 
I could write an analytical break
down of the Super Bowl right now.
I could discuss the intricacies of
how the Saints won the game by
being sound in special teams and wear
ing the Colts defense out by methodi
cally working the ball down the field.
But that would be boring. Plus, if
you wanted a detailed analysis of the
Super Bowl, although it is sad, I highly
doubt this is where you would turn to
get it. So instead, I'd rather look at the
larger meaning of the Super Bowl in
the context of American culture.

Is there anything more American
than Super Bowl Sunday?
It combines an over-the-top specta
cle, which is emblematic of American
exceptionalism, with a sense of group
camaraderie and tradition. Most every
family or group of friends has its
unique way of celebrating the Super
Bowl, be it a special guacamole dip, a
series of prop bets, or just a backyard
barbeque.
I say they are celebrating for a rea
son, because for all intents and purpos
es, the Super Bowl has become a na
tional holiday.
In 1984, Joseph L. Price wrote in an
article for Christian Century , "There is
a remarkable sense in which the Super
Bowl functions as a maj or religious fes
tival for American culture, for the
event signals a convergence of sports,
politics and myth."
While this was written 26 years ago,
his point has only become more valid
as the years have passed.

Of the 90 million or so viewers of
yesterday's Super Bowl, many of them
were football fans that cared deeply
about the Saints and the Colts, but just
as many, if not more, were not. TTiey
were watching to see the commercials,
or the halftime show, or simply because
it was what you do.
Price refers to the Super Bowl and
politics and he is right that a game
that has zero intrinsic political influ
ence can be used as an extraordinary
political tool.
