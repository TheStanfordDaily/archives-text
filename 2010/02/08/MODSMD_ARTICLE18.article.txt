# The 						American Holiday
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
I could write an analytical break
down of the Super Bowl right now.
I could discuss the intricacies of
how the Saints won the game by
being sound in special teams and wear
ing the Colts defense out by methodi
cally working the ball down the field.
But that would be boring. Plus, if
you wanted a detailed analysis of the
Super Bowl, although it is sad, I highly
doubt this is where you would turn to
get it. So instead, I'd rather look at the
larger meaning of the Super Bowl in
the context of American culture.

Is there anything more American
than Super Bowl Sunday?
It combines an over-the-top specta
cle, which is emblematic of American
exceptionalism, with a sense of group
camaraderie and tradition. Most every
family or group of friends has its
unique way of celebrating the Super
Bowl, be it a special guacamole dip, a
series of prop bets, or just a backyard
barbeque.
I say they are celebrating for a rea
son, because for all intents and purpos
es, the Super Bowl has become a na
tional holiday.
In 1984, Joseph L. Price wrote in an
article for Christian Century , "There is
a remarkable sense in which the Super
Bowl functions as a maj or religious fes
tival for American culture, for the
event signals a convergence of sports,
politics and myth."
While this was written 26 years ago,
his point has only become more valid
as the years have passed.

Of the 90 million or so viewers of
yesterday's Super Bowl, many of them
were football fans that cared deeply
about the Saints and the Colts, but just
as many, if not more, were not. TTiey
were watching to see the commercials,
or the halftime show, or simply because
it was what you do.
Price refers to the Super Bowl and
politics and he is right that a game
that has zero intrinsic political influ
ence can be used as an extraordinary
political tool.

ESPN found it necessary to put an
article about President Obama picking
the Colts to win, but rooting for the
Saints on the front of its website the
morning of the game.
More precisely, the battle for adver
tising during the Super Bowl has be
come political, as CBS, somewhat con
troversially, allowed a commercial for
a pro-life group starring Tim Tebow to
air during the game, but not a racy
commercial starring a homosexual for
mer football player.
Sports are normally a venue that
transcends politics, allowing Democ
rats and Republicans to root for the
same teams and share a common in

terest. Politics should never become
the story of sport, but, come Super
Bowl time, interest groups know that
this is the most watched event annual
ly in the U.S., so it is a great time to
spread a message. That said, the open,
public debate over the Tebow com
mercial is truly illustrative of the
American democracy at work.
In addition to politics, Price refers
to the myth around the Super Bowl.
What better example of that than this
year and the talk about the Saints win
ning the Super Bowl being good for
New Orleans.

No one will argue that the city has
been depressed and the people beat
down in the aftermath of Hurricane
Katrina, but if you read some of the
articles in the lead up to the Super
Bowl, it sounded as if a Saints' victo
ry would turn back the clock four and
a half years and stop the hurricane

from ever hitting.
Sports are great, but they cannot
prevent tragedy, fix dysfunction or re
build an economy. Ultimately, they
are games maybe not just games,
but they are games.
The Super Bowl, however, is much,
much more to America.

The United States is probably the
most grandiose country in the world.
Only here would it seem appropriate
to spend close to $3 million on a 30-sec
ond advertisement as is done for the
Super Bowl. Only here would celebri
ties such as Stevie Wonder, Charles
Barkley, Ice Cube, Leßron James,
Dwight Howard and Larry Bird all
make appearances in those commer
cials.

It's America. It's over the top and
extravagant. Just like Times Square is
the center of New Year's celebrations
worldwide, and Hollywood is the cen

ter of film production, the Super Bowl
is the ultimate media event and it is
America's.

Only here, a country built by the
minds and muscles of immigrants,
would we see it appropriate to co-opt
one of Britain's finest bands for our

halftime show

It is all part of creating the biggest,
most exceptional event possible be
cause that is what America does.

No matter your religious beliefs or
level of observance, if you are Ameri
can, the Super Bowl is a holiday for

you. Jew or Muslim, Christian or
Hindu. The Super Bowl is America's
holiday.
