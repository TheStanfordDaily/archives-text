## Assortment of players contributes to win 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball dominated UC-Santa Cruz 30-
23,29-31,30-22,30-18 on Friday night.
Sophomore setter Evan Barry started his first game of the sea
son in place of senior Kawika Shoji after having played in four
games in 2009. In his season debut, Barry excelled with a career
high 58 assists.
Last year, Barry started his first collegiate match versus Long
Beach State and later had a previous career best against UC-Irvine
with 26 assists. He is currently expected to take over Shoji's job after
graduation.
"It was great to finally get out there and set a full match. All of
the guys who got in really stepped up to allow me to set the whole
match," Barry said. "Although it wasn't an MPSF match, our team
really needed a win and so I think everyone is happy with that vic
tory."
The Card played a hard-fought game that started with a quick
attack in the first set. Barry instantly connected with sophomore
outside hitter Brad Lawson and soon after found senior opposite
hitter Evan Romero and senior middle blocker Garrett Werner.
Stanford controlled the tempo of the game as the team spread out
its attack. UC-Santa Cruz fell behind after the Card went on a five
point run, increasing its lead to 22-18. A Jason Palacios kill finally
won the set for the Card at 30-23.
