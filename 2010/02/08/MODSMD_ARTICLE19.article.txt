# TEAM EFFORT LIFTS CARD
## Assortment of players contributes to win 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball dominated UC-Santa Cruz 30-
23,29-31,30-22,30-18 on Friday night.
Sophomore setter Evan Barry started his first game of the sea
son in place of senior Kawika Shoji after having played in four
games in 2009. In his season debut, Barry excelled with a career
high 58 assists.
Last year, Barry started his first collegiate match versus Long
Beach State and later had a previous career best against UC-Irvine
with 26 assists. He is currently expected to take over Shoji's job after
graduation.
"It was great to finally get out there and set a full match. All of
the guys who got in really stepped up to allow me to set the whole
match," Barry said. "Although it wasn't an MPSF match, our team
really needed a win and so I think everyone is happy with that vic
tory."
The Card played a hard-fought game that started with a quick
attack in the first set. Barry instantly connected with sophomore
outside hitter Brad Lawson and soon after found senior opposite
hitter Evan Romero and senior middle blocker Garrett Werner.
Stanford controlled the tempo of the game as the team spread out
its attack. UC-Santa Cruz fell behind after the Card went on a five
point run, increasing its lead to 22-18. A Jason Palacios kill finally
won the set for the Card at 30-23.

Sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson hammers a
kill against the UC-Santa Cruz. Four Cardinal players
recorded career highs in kills, while sophomore
setter Evan Barry had a career-high 58 assists.
"I think the tempo was similar to
that of any other game. Everyone on
our team who got [playing time] really
wanted to win," Barry said. "I don't
think that it was any less competitive
than most league games."
The second set saw new players and
a Santa Cruz comeback. Most signifi
cantly, redshirt sophomore outside hit
ter Garrett Dobbs, redshirt sophomore

middle blocker Charley Henrikson,
and freshman outside hitter Myles
Muagututia stepped in. The three came
out powerfully against the Banana
Slugs. Combined, they hit 17 kills. Un
fortunately, Santa Cruz met the Card's
attack and tied up the game at 26,27,28,
and 29.Tw0 attack errors lost the set for
the Card, 31-29.
"Santa Cruz definitely came out fir
ing," Barry said. "They were not going
to fold just because we are the better
ranked team so they made it a fun, com
petitive match."
The substitutions continued as jun
ior outside hitter fan Connolly stepped

into the third set.This time Stanford was
relentless and never let the Banana
Slugs see a lead. Though Santa Cruz's
Justin Lam and Salvatore La Cavera
were continual threats, sophomore
libero Erik Shoji directed the defense
with skill.The Card took the set by eight
points, 30-22.
"I think the most challenging part of
the game was keeping a steady rhythm
going with all the substitutions we
made. However, we did a really good
job of managing it," Barry said. "1 think
we had 16 guys play, but not one of them
negatively changed the tempo of the
game when they came in. I'm really

proud of everyone for stepping up and
playing well."
In the fourth and final set, errors
troubled the Banana Slugs and kept
junior middle blocker Max Halvorson
serving to take an early 5-3 lead. Dobbs
hit seven kills in the fourth set alone and
at one point helped secure a nine-point
lead over Santa Cruz. Dobbs ended the
set with a service ace for the 30-18 win,
ending the match as well.
"I think trust played a big part in
the win," Barry said. "Everyone on
our team trusted whoever was in at
the time and that really allowed them
to step up and make a difference. It

gave them the confidence they need
ed to play well in an important game
like this."

The men's volleyball team earned
its second victory of the week against
Santa Cruz, the first being against Pacif
ic on Wednesday, with many players
coming off the bench in the much-need
ed wins. Next weekend, the Card will
face two MPSF opponents: UCLA, Fri
day at Maples Pavilion, and UC-Irvine,
Saturday at Burnham Pavilion. Both
matches will begin at 7 p.m.
