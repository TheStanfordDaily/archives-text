# Strong doubles play leads Card to victory over Hawaii
## 
### MIKE LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford faced Hawaii over
Thanksgiving break, the Cardinal, play
ing on the road for the first time and with
out its top-ranked player sophomore
Bradley Klahn, still won easily, 7-0. On
Saturday, playing in the friendly confines
of the Taube Family Tennis Center with
Klahn back in the singles lineup, the re
sult was vaguely familiar.
The No. 9 Stanford men's tennis team
defeated the Hawaii Warriors, 6-1, to ex
tend its perfect record to 4-0 on the sea
son. It was the first match this season the
Cardinal did not sweep.
On the singles side, Klahn, junior
Alex Clayton, and freshmen Denis Lin
and Matt Kandath all won in straight
sets, while sophomore Ryan Thacher
needed three sets to seal the victory. Se
nior Richard Wire was the lone Cardinal
player to lose, dropping in straight sets
6-2,6-2.

On the doubles side, Stanford record
ed a near-perfect showing as Clayton and
Wire won 8-1, Kandath and Lin won 8-0
and junior Greg Hirshman and freshman
Walker Kehrer won 8-2.
Once again, the weather impacted the
match. Originally scheduled to begin at 1
p.m., head coach John Whitlinger post
poned the starting time until 3 p.m. to
give the courts enough time to sufficient
ly dry.
"We thought we really weren't going
to play at all," Clayton said. "Getting to
the courts and seeing that we were going
to play was a little bit of shock."
Still unsure of the forecast, the order
of the match was reversed, with the teams
playing the singles matches before the
doubles. In collegiate tennis, a team
needs to win four points out of a possible
seven to win the match. One point is
awarded for winning the doubles side,
and each of the six singles matches are
also worth one point. Thus, a team can
clinch the match solely on singles.
The rain, of course, did not come. The
result? Three doubles matches that had
no impact on the overall match.
"It was definitely a little bit different

Sophomore Bradley Klahn prepares
to hit a backhand in Stanford's match
against Hawaii. The Cardinal lost
three total games in doubles matches
on its way to a solid 6-1 victory.
[playing doubles after the match
had already been clinched]," Clay
ton said. "But we still came out and
only lost three doubles games."
The fact that the match was al
ready decided after singles did
allow Whitlinger to mix up his dou
bles lineup, swapping out the No. 1
squad of Klahn and Thacher for
Hirshman and Kehrer.
For Klahn, Saturday was a
whirlwind day. It began at 9 a.m.
when he faced Tim Smyczek in the
first round of the SAP Open in
San Jose a tournament head
lined by Andy Roddick. Klahn lost
6-2,7-6.
He then returned to campus, un
sure if he had another match to
play. "I stopped by the courts on
my way back and they were look
ing pretty dry, so I knew there was
a shot we could play," Klahn said.
After receiving word from his
coach, Klahn got his body and
mind back into game form. "I did
n't feel too tired after playing the
two sets," he said. "I've played two
matches in a day in a number of sit
uations."
Once the singles were over and
Stanford had won, Whitlinger fi
nally gave Klahn a rest, allowing
Hirshman and Kehrer to get some
playing time though Klahn in
sisted he would have been ready to
go if needed.
Next up for Stanford is the
Round of 16 in the National Team
Indoor Championships, where
weather will not be a factor. The
Cardinal will fly to Charlottesville,
Virg. on Wednesday and play No. 8
Texas Friday morning.
"We beat them last year second
round, so it should definitely be a
good rematch," Clayton said.
If Stanford wins, it will face ei
ther USC or Fresno State on Satur
day in the quarterfinals. The cham
pionship is at noon on Monday.
