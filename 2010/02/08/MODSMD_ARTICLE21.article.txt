### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal swept the competi
tion at its home tournament this week
end. The No. 1 women's water polo
team started its tournament play Satur
day bright and early at 8:30 a.m. against
No. 6 Michigan at the Avery Aquatic
Center. Freshman two-meter Annika
Dries started the Cardinal off with a
goal, one of five Stanford scored be
fore the Wolverines could get on the
board. By halftime, the Cardinal was
leading 8-3 and stayed in control
throughout the second half as the
game ended with a 12-5 victory for
Stanford.
Sophomore two-meter Melissa
Seidemann shot a whopping total of
four goals throughout the match;
Dries skipped three into the net: soph
omore driver Pallavi Menon scored
two goals; senior driver Kelly Eaton,
senior driver Kelsey Holshouser, and
senior two-meter Alex Koran each
had a single goal. Junior goalkeeper
Amber Oland saved five shots and
freshman goalkeeper Kate Baldoni
also recorded a save of her own.
Later on Saturday, the Cardinal
faced off against No. 2 USC. Like the
morning match, Stanford started the
game off strong with a 4-2 lead by the
end of the first period. During the sec
ond and third periods, each team
scored three points, keeping the game
close.
In the final period, the Cardinal
outscored its opponent 3-2, giving
Stanford the 10-7 victory. Eaton and
Seidemann each contributed four
goals while Holshouser and junior
driver Kim Krueger each skipped in a
goal. Oland stopped seven shots
throughout the game.
On Sunday morning, the Cardinal
again started the day early at 8:30 a.m.
against No. 7 San Jose State. During
the first half the Cardinal only had a
two-point advantage at 7-s,but, during
the second half, Stanford dominated
and stole a win from the Spartans. In
the last two periods, the Cardinal
outscored the Spartans 8-1 en route to
a 15-6 win. Stanford benefitted from a
well-spread offensive attack, with mul
tiple players making offensive contri
butions.

Dries shot three goals; Krueger,
Menon and senior two-meter Jessica
Steffens each contributed two goals;
sophomore driver Cassie Churnside,
freshman driver Vee Denlevie, Eaton,
Holshouser, freshman driver Victoria

Kennedy, and Koran each shot a single
goal. Baldoni had a total of 10 saves.
At 4:30 p.m., the Cardinal played
No. 4 UC-Berkeley for the Stanford
Invitational Championship title. The
Cardinal started oil the match more
slowly than in the other games this
weekend. After the first period, the
Bears led 1-0. However, by the end of
the second period, the Cardinal took a
small 4-3 lead.
During the third quarter, Stanford
showed why it is the top team in the na
tion as it scored five goals.
The fourth quarter solidified the
win for Stanford as each team scored
once. The final score was a victorious
10-7, making the Cardinal women's
water polo team the champion of the
Stanford Invitational.
"We haven't won this tournament
since 2003," said head coach John Tan
ner after the match.
Overall, the coach seemed happy
with this weekend's performance with
a few minor exceptions.
"We were inconsistent but good at
some critical times,"Tanner said."[Sat
urday] we really struggled and created
and scored some more difficult oppor
tunities. We converted more efficiently
[Sunday], Our one-on-one defense is
too spotty."
Although the defense could have
executed better, the team as a whole
provided great competition for the
other teams.
As seen on Sunday morning, many
freshmen and new players were in the
pool, while by the end of the day more
upperclassmen were playing. Whether
a more experienced player or a new
player, each Cardinal woman con
tributed to the championship.
"When you play four games in two
days, people are going to have differ
ent energies," Tanner said.
Winning such a competitive tour
nament gave Tanner high expectations
for the season.
"The bar is set pretty high with our
team," he said. "The tradition of great
play and great water polo expectations
are high, and I am sure we will be
ranked No. 1 again."
The Cardinal played four games in
two days against Michigan, USC, San
Jose State University and UC-Berke
ley, winning each match. The next
match will be at the Avery Aquatic
Center on Saturday at 10 a.m. against
Sonoma State.
