# Card gain experience on Texas roadtrip
## 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 14 Stanford women's tennis team (4-0) passed its
first major test this season with flying colors as it took down No.
24 Texas Christian University (1-2) by a score of 6-1 on Friday,
followed by a 5-2 victory over No. 27 University of Texas (1-3)
Saturday afternoon.
Despite being the first ranked team Stanford played this
ycar.TCU proved to be little challenge for the Cardinal. With
a sweep of the doubles, Stanford earned the tiebreak point and
proceeded to win the next three matches to clinch the day.
"I think we handled two pretty good teams well," said head
coach Lele Forood. "We won the doubles both days and that
was key. We swept againstTCU and the singles were pretty well
contested both days."
Both freshmen appeared to struggle against TCU though,
as Stacey Tan had to come back from a set down to defeat
Idunn Hertzberg 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (5). Mallory Burdette suffered
only her fourth loss on the season in a 5-7,7-6 (4), 1-0 (10-5) loss
to Katariina Tuohimaa at the No. 3 position. Both players expe
rienced some pre-match jitters as they adjusted to their first
dual match play on the road.
"That match was a bit of getting adjusted to the place and
my opponent's style of tennis," Tan said. "We played indoors
for that match and it was different
having a wall pretty close to the base
line and having a roof up top. If you
hit the ceiling, then the point ends. I
did that a few times."
All other matches were won in
straight sets, with only one other set
being closely contested. The cleanest
win came from Carolyn McVeigh at
the No. 5 spot, 6-1,6-0. Lindsay Bur
dette also defeated TCU's Kayla
Duncan 6-1,6-1 in another solid win.

Weather forced the women to
constantly move around their play
ing schedule. It was too cold Friday to
play outside and matches were
moved indoors. Saturday was slightly
warmer but play was still slow.
"Indoors are very different condi
tions, absolutely different," Forood
said. "Inside were more slam-bang
matches. Texas was outside and those
matches were very gritty, very slow."
Despite the adversity, the Cardi
nal dispatched Texas 5-2 in front of a
rowdy crowd. They lost only two
matches in straight sets at the No. 3
and No. 6 positions. In order of play,
Texas and Stanford were tied with
one win apiece before Stanford won
the next three matches to clinch the
day.

Stacey Tan and Veronica Li both
lost their singles in straights while
No. 1 Hilary Barte was forced to a
third set tiebreak before she won her

match 6-3, 3-6,1-0 (10-7). The other
matches were all straight set wins for
the Cardinal.The biggest factor in the
match against Texas proved to be a
very rowdy fan base, highlighted by
the Texas men's tennis team and their
chants that bordered on disrespect.
"In my opinion at times, it was a
bit of crossing the line," Tan said.
"Just because of how they would yell
in the middle of a point or right when

you're about to serve or return. Per
sonally, I wasn't used to having a
large crowd cheering against me. It's
hard because they pressure you while
you're playing and you really need to
block it out."

Looking forward, the experience
of facing such an intense crowd can
only be beneficial for the players.
Texas proved to be a challenge
one of the louder crowds that the
team will face but Forood is feel
ing positive about the way the girls
handled the pressure.
"It's very eye opening, especially
for the freshmen," Forood said.
"They really have to experience this.
Quite frankly, it was a great experi
ence to play against hostile stands be
cause the guy's team knows how to
heckle, what to say and how to get
under your skin. They chanted 'fault,
fault, fault' when you missed your
first serve."

At the end of the weekend, it was
a successful trip. With two hard
fought wins behind it, the Cardinal is
well-prepared moving forward
against Pac-10 opponents that are
coming up in a few short weeks. The
team took a few lessons away from
the weekend that will serve it for the
rest of the season.

"You have to be ready for whatev
er faces you," Tan said. "Not just on
the court, but also being able to go
from traveling to recovering and fi
nally being able to play your match
and win."
