## Janitor rehired post controversy 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
When Karina Reyes walked into
Terman Engineering Building at 11 p.m.
on Jan. 18 to clean, she was gearing up
for a normal night of work, no different
than any other of her two years working
for ABM Industries as a janitor at
Stanford.

Reyes was vacuuming and disposing
of trash in the laboratories when her cell
phone's battery ran out, so she decided
to charge it in one Terman's basement
offices, plugging it into the computer of
Lee Merrick, an information technology
manager in the Office of Research
Administration.

She left to continue her work;
Terman's recently installed video sur
veillance system captured Reyes' stop
on tape.

Twenty minutes later, two campus
security officers arrived at Terman to
investigate a case of potential data steal
ing; the following day, Reyes was sus
pended for three days from her job.
Later that week, she was fired.

Now, Reyes is back into the job: on
Feb. 4, ABM settled the dispute with her
and a union representative and rehired
her, but not before the events on the
night of Jan. 18 kicked off a labor dispute
case that rocked the campus chat lists
and had student activists up in arms.

Stanford Labor Action Coalition
(SLAC) took up Reyes' case, as they
have done in other labor disputes here
since 1998.

According to Dan Weismann, a PhD
in physics and spokesperson for the
activist group, ABM gave two reasons
for firing Reyes. The first: that by charg
ing her cell phone Reyes had "used" the
computer, violating a company policy.
Second: that Stanford requested that she
be fired.

Weissman said ABM later said
Stanford did not request that Reyes be
fired.

A spokesperson for ABM did not
immediately return a request for com
ment last week.

Tom Sheehan, a professor of reli
gious studies and chairman of the
Faculty Coalition of Labor Rights at
Stanford, said Reyes's case was distinct
from other labor issues with which
SLAC has been involved because Reyes
had admittedly made a "stupid mistake"
by plugging in her phone to Merrick's
computer.

Though SLAC's list of grievances
against ABM is long,' 'in this case, Karina
Reyes actually did commit a real foolish
offense by charging her cell phone
through the computers," Sheehan said.
"The danger's that she might be down
loading sensitive data."
