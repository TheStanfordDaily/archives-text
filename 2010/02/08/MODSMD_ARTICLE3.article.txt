## Janitor rehired post controversy 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
When Karina Reyes walked into
Terman Engineering Building at 11 p.m.
on Jan. 18 to clean, she was gearing up
for a normal night of work, no different
than any other of her two years working
for ABM Industries as a janitor at
Stanford.

Reyes was vacuuming and disposing
of trash in the laboratories when her cell
phone's battery ran out, so she decided
to charge it in one Terman's basement
offices, plugging it into the computer of
Lee Merrick, an information technology
manager in the Office of Research
Administration.

She left to continue her work;
Terman's recently installed video sur
veillance system captured Reyes' stop
on tape.

Twenty minutes later, two campus
security officers arrived at Terman to
investigate a case of potential data steal
ing; the following day, Reyes was sus
pended for three days from her job.
Later that week, she was fired.

Now, Reyes is back into the job: on
Feb. 4, ABM settled the dispute with her
and a union representative and rehired
her, but not before the events on the
night of Jan. 18 kicked off a labor dispute
case that rocked the campus chat lists
and had student activists up in arms.

Stanford Labor Action Coalition
(SLAC) took up Reyes' case, as they
have done in other labor disputes here
since 1998.

According to Dan Weismann, a PhD
in physics and spokesperson for the
activist group, ABM gave two reasons
for firing Reyes. The first: that by charg
ing her cell phone Reyes had "used" the
computer, violating a company policy.
Second: that Stanford requested that she
be fired.

Weissman said ABM later said
Stanford did not request that Reyes be
fired.

A spokesperson for ABM did not
immediately return a request for com
ment last week.

Tom Sheehan, a professor of reli
gious studies and chairman of the
Faculty Coalition of Labor Rights at
Stanford, said Reyes's case was distinct
from other labor issues with which
SLAC has been involved because Reyes
had admittedly made a "stupid mistake"
by plugging in her phone to Merrick's
computer.

Though SLAC's list of grievances
against ABM is long,' 'in this case, Karina
Reyes actually did commit a real foolish
offense by charging her cell phone
through the computers," Sheehan said.
"The danger's that she might be down
loading sensitive data."
Sheehan said that heightened securi
ty had been added to Terman fairly
recently amid growing faculty concerns
that people were breaking into the
offices to steal data. Terman is open
around to the clock to students and fac
ulty with key-card access.
Reyes who said she is the sole
breadwinner for her mother, ill brother
and sister in Mexico approached her
tutor at Habla la Noche, the student
worker English tutoring program, for
help when she was first suspended from
her two-year job. Habla coordinator
Adriana Campos 'll then e-mailed the
labor coalition.

The group released a petition on Jan.
25 demanding that Reyes be rehired
with back pay and pressing for Stanford
to make it clear to ABM that the
University wanted Reyes to keep her
job.

The petition eventually gained 1,650
Stanford-affiliated signatures before the
group sent it to Tom Cazale, an ABM
human resources representative;
Reyes's direct supervisor, Jose
Gonzales; and Sam Steinhardt,
Stanford's interim director of
Procurement.

This was SLAC's sixth campaign
using an online petition since 2007.
"This is the most petition-centered
campaign we've done, and the most suc

cessM petition in terms of getting a lot
of signatures quickly," Weissman said.
Dave Mitchell 'O9, a SLAC alumnus
and contributor to the petition drive,
said distribution involved signing people
up in White Plaza, gathering online sig
natures and having Reyes' coworkers
push for an "on the ground" effort. Five
other night-shift janitors helped pass out
the petition by foot.
Sheehan also approached Merrick
to write a letter to Gonzalez, Reyes's
supervisor. In the letter, Sheehan asked
that Reyes be transferred to cleaning a
different corridor but requested that she
get her job back.
Under Stanford's contractual agree
ment with ABM, the University takes a
hands-off approach in dealing with
internal ABM affairs, allowing the sub
contractor to operate independently
under the assumption that ABM will
abide by the rules of its union, SEIU
Local 187, and other general labor laws.
ABM settled the dispute with Reyes
and her union representative and she
was rehired on Feb. 4 at the same wage
rate and benefits package effective
before being laid off. She will be paid for
five of the nine days she was out of
work.

In an interview with The Daily,
Reyes expressed gratitude to SLAC and
Stanford students for their help. Reyes
will officially thank students at a party
put on by SLAC, set for Thursday at
noon at El Centra Chicano.
