# The 						biggest party
## Marathon raises money for Haiti, AIDS 
### ALYSSA AHLUWALIA 
More than 1,000 students and community
members and at least one Teletubby are
putting up their feet today after dancing for this
weekend's 24-hour Stanford Dance Marathon.
Dancers, "moralers," hackers and observers
gathered in the Arrillaga Alumni Center Friday
and Saturday for the sixth annual event; togeth
er, with matching funds from FACE AIDS, they
raised about $178,000 for HIV/AIDS philan
thropy.
Advertised through the year as campus'
"biggest and longest party," the fundraiser also
featured the second annual 24-hour Stanford
Hack-a-thon, where computer science students
gear their programming knowledge toward spe
cific public service projects.
Funds raised during the 24-hour period are
set to benefit Partners in Health, a four-year
beneficiary, and Bay Area Young Positives.
Dancers agreed raise a minimum of $192
each ahead of the marathon; the proceeds are
matched by FACE AIDS, a non-profit founded
by Stanford students with which the event has
partnered since 2008.
Partners in Health will receive 90 percent of
the money raised by Dance Marathon partici
pants, organizers said. The non-profit organiza
tion addresses health-related needs of communi
ties in Haiti, Rwanda, Russia, Peru and Boston.

This year, marathon organizers said. Partners
in Health will choose where to direct the funds
likely toward Haiti.
"Usually our donations go specifically
toward comprehensive health care reforms in
Rwanda," said Gino Mazzoti TO, Dance
Marathon's communications director. "This year
we are leaving allocation of funds up to PlH's
discretion; the money we donate will go to the
places that need it most at present... that could
mean that PIH uses our money to aid relief in
Haiti in light of the recent disaster."
The remaining 10 percent of Dance
Marathon's proceeds will go to a San Francisco
non-profit organization, Bay Area Young
Positives, to aid efforts to raise awareness of
HIV/AIDS in local communities and provide
services to local 14- to 25-year-olds living with
the virus.
Hack-a-thon also contributed to the service
atmosphere surrounding the weekend. The proj
ect, now in its second year, has grown substan
tially from its inaugural event.
According to organizer Sam King 'l2 in an e
mail to The Daily, 2010 saw about 70 hackers, up
from 30 in 2008.
"The event as a whole is away for people to
be a part of a community engaged in public serv
ice ... the dancers do this through fundraising,
and the hackers do this through coding," King
said.

One coding project this year involved work
with the organization Sirum and aims to reduce
medical waste by facilitating the movement of
excess medical supplies from rich hospitals to
free clinics.
Hackers and dancers were joined throughout
the night by high-energy moralers: students who
sign up to dance for three hours at a time to
boost spirits.
About 19 Stanford student music and dance
groups and occasional curious observers
stopped by to show support their dancing
friends.

"It's wonderful to see all the energy out on
the dance floor," said moraler Dylan Kim 'l2.

"I'm here because it's an exciting event, and it's
great to see such a huge percent of our campus
taking part in the worldwide issue."
Clay Ramel 'l2, a community relations exec
utive for Dance Marathon, put the night into
perspective.
"I think people keep dancing because they
feel empowered when surrounded by a lot of
other people that care about the prevention of
HIV/AIDS," Ramel said. "It really speaks to the
idea of solidarity, as overused as that word is. As
a community we're banding together."
