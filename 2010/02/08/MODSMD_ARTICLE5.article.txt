The No. 2 Cardinal women's basketball team added
some security to its lead in the conference standings last
night, dominating USC by a score of 77-39. Despite some
early troubles, Stanford took control of the game near the

end of the first half and
had four players with
double-digit point totals,
led by junior forward
Kayla Pedersen's 18.
Things got off to a
slow start, with both
teams struggling to find
the basket in the game's
opening minutes. The
Trojans (13-9, 7-4 Pac
10) were 1-6 from the
field until redshirt soph
omore guard Stefanie
Gilbreath stole a ball at
half court and broke
away for a layup to
make it 4-2 at 16:05.
Stanford (21-1,11-0) had
a hard time as well,
going 1-10 from the field
until senior center Jayne
Appel knocked down a

shot from the top of the key, a somewhat unusual place for
the six-foot-four center to square up. With the basket, the
score was tied at just 4-4 after five minutes of play.
The Cardinal then went on a brief run, including a fast
break layup by redshirt senior guard Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude to make it 8-4 at 13:38. Pedersen followed that with
a nothing-but-net three-pointer from straight out, electrify
ing the crowd and forcing USC to use its first timeout.

GAME NOTES: The N0.2 Cardinal looks to
continue its conference dominance against
Washington. Led by Jayne Appel, who
became Stanford's career rebounding leader
last game, the team has not lost a confer
ence game all season and, with yesterday's
win over (JSC, has won 42 consecutive
games in Maples Pavilion.

Senior center Jayne Appel takes a tough shot over Kari LaPlante
against USC on Sunday afternoon. Appel's 13 rebounds in the
game pushed her past Nicole Powell as Stanford's career
rebounds leader, with 1,153 rebounds.

After going up 11-4 on the small out
burst, though, the Cardinal continued to
struggle with its shooting accuracy. Stan
ford's shooting percentage sunk as low
as 29 percent midway through the half
while the Trojans finished at just 9.7 per
cent, making only three field goals.
"I think we were just not as patient
as we needed to be," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "We
wanted to win this game very badly...
and I just felt people were pressing a
little bit, missing free throws that we've
been making, missing O-boards and
making some turnovers that are un
characteristic."

USC head coach Michael Cooper,
watching his team struggle even more
severely, had similar thoughts.
"I don't really think Stanford's de
fense was a big issue to us, we just missed
a lot of wide open shots," Cooper said.
"When you're playing the second-best
team in the country, you've got to hit
your shots."
The poor shooting meant plenty of
opportunities for rebounding, however,
and the Cardinal was able to capitalize,
Pedersen, in particular, was raking in re
bounds, picking up 10 in less than 11
minutes. She finished with 14 of her
team's eventual 59 rebounds. Appel,
meanwhile, picked up enough boards to
pass Nicole Powell's mark of 1,143 to
become Stanford's all-time rebounds
leader.

"I think it's an honor to be up there,"
Appel said. "But I want a national
championship."

Stanford went on another short
burst before halftime, going 3-4 from the
field as Pedersen sunk a three from
straight out and followed it up with a
pair of successful free throws, which
helped send the Cardinal to the locker
room with a 29-10 lead. Pedersen
earned a double-double with 50 sec
onds remaining in the half.
Stanford took off in the second half,
improving its accuracy and quickly ex
tending its lead. Two and a half minutes
in, Gold-Onwude scored a crowd-pleas
ing fast break layup that drew a foul,

putting the Cardinal up 34-10 with the
and-one free throw. That came in the
midst of a 26-9 run that lasted until 10:07
of the half, when Stanford led 55-19.
As the half continued, Stanford
began to make better shots, posting
64.5-percent accuracy in the second half
after shooting 35.7 percent in the first.
After the ten-minute mark, Stanford re
lied less on driving to the basket and
made 14 of its next 16 points from the
field on jump-shots.
With about five minutes remaining
and the win lookinag secure, Van-
Derveer began to sub in her bench
players. By that time, though, four of
Stanford's starters had double-digit
point totals: Pedersen (18), Ogwu
mike (16), Appel (15), and Gold-On
wude (11).
As USC continued to fade, one of its
players redshirt junior Jacki Geme
los did not. The Stockton, Calif, na
tive, a high school teammate of Appel,
had been plagued by knee injuries since
being the nation's top recruit in 2006.
She played her first NCAA game only
three nights ago, against Cal, and was
her team's points leader against the Car
dinal with 13.
"I thought Jacki Gemelos played an
excellent game for her second game
back," Cooper said. "Other than the
loss, it's just a very happy moment for
me personally, and I'm quite sure for her
family, that she's out on the court doing
the things she loves doing."
"It's definitely been bittersweet,"

Gemelos said. "It's unfortunate that we
came downand got two losses, but at the
same time I'm very happy [to be back]."
While Gemelos's fellow Trojans and
her friends and family were certainly de
lighted to see her playing again, the Car
dinal had a special source of inspiration
as well. Stanford's 1989-1990 national
championship team, coached by Van-
Derveer, was honored following Sun
day's game and was on campus this
weekend to speak with the current Car
dinal women.
"There are some teams that say,'Oh,
that was 20 years ago, that was then,' but
I really like how our team really em
braced their message and listened,"
VanDerveer said. "Obviously our teams
are really different, but there are a lot of
similarities with what we're doing now
and what we did and what things will
work for us. The biggest thing that this
team felt was just the pride that the '9O
team has in them."
With two wins over the Los Angeles
schools last weekend, the Cardinal has
secured a season sweep over the confer
ence's second- and third-place teams,
owning a three-game cushion in the loss
column over the Bruins with only seven
regular season games remaining. Up
next for the Cardinal is a road trip to the
Northwest, where it will take on Wash
ington on Friday at 7 p.m. and Washing
ton State on Sunday at noon.
