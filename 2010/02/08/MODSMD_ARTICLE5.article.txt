The No. 2 Cardinal women's basketball team added
some security to its lead in the conference standings last
night, dominating USC by a score of 77-39. Despite some
early troubles, Stanford took control of the game near the

end of the first half and
had four players with
double-digit point totals,
led by junior forward
Kayla Pedersen's 18.
Things got off to a
slow start, with both
teams struggling to find
the basket in the game's
opening minutes. The
Trojans (13-9, 7-4 Pac
10) were 1-6 from the
field until redshirt soph
omore guard Stefanie
Gilbreath stole a ball at
half court and broke
away for a layup to
make it 4-2 at 16:05.
Stanford (21-1,11-0) had
a hard time as well,
going 1-10 from the field
until senior center Jayne
Appel knocked down a

shot from the top of the key, a somewhat unusual place for
the six-foot-four center to square up. With the basket, the
score was tied at just 4-4 after five minutes of play.
The Cardinal then went on a brief run, including a fast
break layup by redshirt senior guard Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude to make it 8-4 at 13:38. Pedersen followed that with
a nothing-but-net three-pointer from straight out, electrify
ing the crowd and forcing USC to use its first timeout.
