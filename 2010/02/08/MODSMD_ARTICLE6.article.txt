## One campus Zipcar recalled 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
Following Toyota's announcement to
recall several of its models, including the
latest generation of Priuses, due to poten
tial problems with the brake system,
rental company Zipcar has pulled several
cars out of its reservation system across
the country including one vehicle at
Stanford.

Of the five percent of the fleet impact
ed, one car on Stanford's campus a
Toyota Matrix is affected, a Zipcar
spokesperson said Friday. Zipcar current

ly offers 29 cars, including 10 Priuses, to
Stanford's 1,200-plus subscribers.

"There are 30 different makes and
models in the Zipcar fleet, so Zipsters
[Zipcar users] will have other vehicle
model options to choose from while
Toyota resolves the vehicle issues related
to safety recalls," wrote company
spokesperson Nancy Scott in an e-mail to
The Daily.

According to an e-mail sent to regis
tered Zipcar users, only the Toyota

One Toyota Matrix Stanford Zipcar on
campus will be affected by the company's
recall. The Matrix (pictured) will not
be available for reservations until the
acceleration pedal issue is resolved.
Matrix is currently of concern to the
company. "Affected vehicles will not
be available for reservation until the
situation has been resolved," the e
mail said, and any person with a reser
vation for a Matrix will be moved to a
different car.

"In the event of a 2010 Prius recall,
we will act as we did with the 2009 and
2010 Matrix recall and remove the
vehicles from the fleet to await a fix
from Toyota," Scott said. The 2010
Prius model represents less than one
percent of the entire Zipcar fleet.
Toyota is recalling several of its
vehicles manufactured over the last
few years as a result of two different
reported issues related to the acceler
ator pedal. The first, a "floor mat
entrapment," is caused by interfer

ence; the "pedal" recall is due to
potential sticking of the pedal while
depressed. The faulty acceleration
pedal is assumed to be the cause of at
least four accidents in the United
States.
Registered Stanford Zipcar uses
can still book Priuses online, but the
Matrix is not an option. Scott did not
say if and when the Matrix would be
available for use again.
Jason Chua 'll uses Stanford
Zipcar at least a few times a month to
pick up materials for class projects, but
is not concerned about the recall.
"I noticed that [Zipcar] sent out an
e-mail, and I figured that they're
aware of the situation and making
sure that they're covered, so we're
covered also," Chua said.
"I figure if something is wrong,
they're going to deal with it before it
becomes a problem for me," he added.
