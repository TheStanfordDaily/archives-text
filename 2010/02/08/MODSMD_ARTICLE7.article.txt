# STUDENT LIFE
## Greeks target sexual violence 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Across campus, one topic of discussion is by turns broadcasted and
quieted: "forcible sexual offenses," including rape of which 10 cases
were reported to Stanford police in 2008.
ASSU and some student groups champion anti-assault campaigns
periodically; freshmen hear words of warning at "Real World:
Stanford" annually.
But in many sectors of campus, including housed Greek life, some
say that sexual assault cases nine of them in student residences in

2008 go unmentioned.
This quarter, a group call
ing itself Fraternity Men
Against Violence believes it
can change that discussion.
The numbers "seem
low," said Phil Nova 'lO, a
chairperson of the group
and a member of Theta
Delta Chi fraternity, "which
is part of the skepticism that
a lot of people have. They
say that there have only
been 10 sexual assaults, to
which I respond, 'How many
is acceptable to you?"'

Leaders of the men's
group, new to the Greek sys-

tem here, says it wants to remind the Stanford community that sexual
assault and relationship abuse are still a threat to students, especially
women.
Each of the men involved had his own reasons for getting involved.
Philippe de Koning 'lO, a member of Sigma Nu, said he has felt strong
ly about the issue of violence against women since he learned about
the issue as a resident assistant (RA) for freshmen. Duncan Fisher 'l2
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon said he gained an appreciation for the female
perspective after getting together with his girlfriend last spring.
Michael Flynn 'lO of Theta Delta Chi said a member of his family has
experienced relationship abuse.
How the group will accomplish anything in the Greek community,
however, seems it will take some time.
De Koning explained that groundwork for an anti-violence pro
gram in fraternities began last winter. Former ASSU Vice President
Jay de la Torre'lo, who would go on to make sexual assault prevention
part of his ASSU executive campaign, and others helped develop
ideas.
Today, the group has at least one representative in each of
Stanford's seven housed fraternities except Phi Psi; the group meets
weekly. Each coordinator has or will be trained for the in-house posi
tion, Nova said.
They hope to host a charity Softball tournament to benefit a
women's shelter in Palo Alto, to develop an online true and false quiz
for students about dating violence and to hold discussion panels inside
fraternity houses. But their goals don't come without challenges.
"Most people I've come across aren't willing to say it's a problem
at Stanford," said Sam Gould 'll, Kappa Sigma's coordinator for the
group. "They think we live in this perfect bubble where nothing like
this happens."
"There's a small, small minority of guys who are actually perpetrat
ing these crimes," Nova added, "but the majority sees this going on and
say to themselves, 'lt's not something I'm directly doing, so it's not my
