## HEALING HAITI STANFORD HOSPITAL SENDS EIGHT TO PATCH UP A BROKEN NATION 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR 
For Dr. Bob Norris and his team, the
term "call of duty" took on new
meaning the morning of Jan. 13. Less
than 24 hours after a 7.0 magnitude
earthquake rocked Haiti, Norris, the
chief of the Division of Emergency Medicine
at Stanford, was leading a departmental meet
ing when he received a phone call. It was a
colleague from the Washington, D.C.-based
International Medical Core (IMC).
Dr. Paul Auerbach, Stanford physician and
the former chief of the ER Division, saw
Norris on the phone and immediately knew

what the call would be about.

"We looked at each other," Auerbach said.
"I asked him.'We're going someplace, right?"'
IMC had requested that Norris put togeth
er a medical team to assist in the relief efforts
in Haiti. Dr. Lan Brown and Dr. Anil Menon,
two emergency medicine physicians present
at the meeting, volunteered immediately.
Norris then sent out an e-mail asking for nurs
es. Three Stanford Hospital nurses, Gaby
McAdoo, Heather Tilson and Julie Rachioppi,
as well as one traveling nurse, Jonathan
Gardner, answered the request.
In the two days between the call and their
Friday departure, the eight-person team could
only imagine the devastation that awaited
them. News reports estimated that over
200,000 had perished from the natural disas
ter, with another 300,000 injured. Over a quar
ter of a million homes had been leveled by the
quake, which had its epicenter about 16 miles
from the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince.
"I don't think any of us really knew what
we were going to face," said Menon, who had
also worked in the field in Afghanistan. "It's
one thing to watch the news and it's another
thing to see bodies and smell infection."
With $lB,OOO worth of medical supplies in
tow, the team traveled for three days, depart
ing from San Francisco International Airport
and stopping in Santo Domingo in the
Dominican Republic. They waited in Santo
Domingo for a half a day for a scheduled
flight that never materialized with planes
working overtime to ship in needed aid.

Rightfully impatient, the team soon real
ized their utility was dwindling with each pass
ing minute.
"Every moment we weren't there, we
knew there was somebody we could have
saved," said Gardner, who been on vacation in
Lake Tahoe when he received Norris' e-mail.
By late Saturday evening, the physicians
and nurses, unable to wait any longer, piled
their supplies into rented vans. After a 10-
hour ride, the group arrived at the Haitian
border Sunday morning. With the sun rising,
after making their way through the Haitian
mainland to the coast, team members finally
laid eyes on the devastated capital, the streets
filled with debris and human bodies.
"Hands were reaching up everywhere,"
Norris said. "Everyone was trying to get help
for their loved ones."
With the aid of Haitian police, the convoy
arrived safely at the University Hospital com
pound in Port-au-Prince, Auerbach estimated
that upon their arrival, the compound was
holding between 750 and 800 patients and
their families. Due to the structural instability
of the building, which made it vulnerable to
aftershocks, and the sheer crowding of the
complex, workers began setting up tents out
side.

Splitting up to assess the severity of vic
tims' injuries, the team began an arduous task
of treating what seemed like an endless
amount of patients. Auerbach and Gardner
worked in an area known as "The Forest," a
central courtyard where hundreds of patients
lay beneath tarps and trees waiting for care.
The first two days on-site, the team prac
ticed nonstop clinical medicine, treating
amputations, fractures, facial injuries and
burns alongside teams from Canada,
Nicaragua and Switzerland. Physicians oper
ated on cots and gurneys, while nurses and
other staff circulated outside, dispensing med
ication and narcotics from fanny packs.
Because medical staff were required to
leave the compound at nightfall because of
"security reasons," the Stanford physicians
and nurses slept in a conference room at a
nearby hotel, averaging three to four hours of
sleep nightly and having little time for nour
ishment. Auerbach recalled a point where he
was so dehydrated he had to receive nine
liters of fluid through an IV before he could
continue working.
"We started a marathon at a sprinting

pace," said Menon, who survived on two
Power Bars for his first three days in Haiti.
Although a 6.0 earthquake the morning
of Jan. 20 caused some disorganization, med
ical staff transitioned relatively smoothly
from critical to primary care over the next
week and a half, with Auerbach appointed
lead physician at the compound. Over that
time period, each member of the team
forged connections with the people that they
worked with. Stanford nurse Gaby McAdoo
formed an especially strong bond with a five
year-old Haitian boy named Monley, who
had been trapped under rubble next to his
deceased father for eight days before he was
rescued. Monley also lost his mother and his
brothers in the disaster, making him the only
survivor of the quake from his immediate
family.
Though McAdoo was technically
Monley's nurse for only a few days, she con
tinued to visit and interact with him through a
French translator. When it came time for the
team to leave, IMC psychologists gave
Monley a family of four mice, hoping they
would help him cope with the loss of his fam
ily and nurse.
"Monley grabbed the tail of the mom
mouse and the tail of the boy mouse and tied
them together," McAdoo said. "Even though

we couldn't communicate with each other,
that was his way of saying he didn't want me
to go."

Gardner echoed McAdoo's respect for the
Haitian people, saying they demonstrated a
strength and resilience uncommon in these
types of disasters.
"[The Haitians] had no unreal expecta
tions of people doing anything for them," he
said. "They were extremely grateful for any
care they received instead of feeling like it
was owed to them."
The Stanford team remained in Haiti for
approximately two weeks, flying out on the
morning of Jan. 29 after handing over the
reins to Haitian physicians. Though they
accomplished much during their stay, the
team members realized the work has only
begun.
"We wanted to do what was right and
empower other people," Auerbach said. "The
earthquake created an entire generation of
amputees, people who will need prosthetics,
therapy, plastic surgery. There's infectious dis
ease and homelessness. We weren't so much
rebuilding a medical infrastructure as creating
one."

aftershocks, and the sheer crowding of the
complex, workers began setting up tents out
side.

Splitting up to assess the severity of vic
tims' injuries, the team began an arduous task
of treating what seemed like an endless
amount of patients. Auerbach and Gardner
worked in an area known as "The Forest," a
central courtyard where hundreds of patients
lay beneath tarps and trees waiting for care.
The first two days on-site, the team prac
ticed nonstop clinical medicine, treating
amputations, fractures, facial injuries and
burns alongside teams from Canada,
Nicaragua and Switzerland. Physicians oper
ated on cots and gurneys, while nurses and
other staff circulated outside, dispensing med
ication and narcotics from fanny packs.
Because medical staff were required to
leave the compound at nightfall because of
"security reasons," the Stanford physicians
and nurses slept in a conference room at a
nearby hotel, averaging three to four hours of
sleep nightly and having little time for nour
ishment. Auerbach recalled a point where he
was so dehydrated he had to receive nine
liters of fluid through an IV before he could
continue working.
"We started a marathon at a sprinting

pace," said Menon, who survived on two
Power Bars for his first three days in Haiti.
Although a 6.0 earthquake the morning
of Jan. 20 caused some disorganization, med
ical staff transitioned relatively smoothly
from critical to primary care over the next
week and a half, with Auerbach appointed
lead physician at the compound. Over that
time period, each member of the team
forged connections with the people that they
worked with. Stanford nurse Gaby McAdoo
formed an especially strong bond with a five
year-old Haitian boy named Monley, who
had been trapped under rubble next to his
deceased father for eight days before he was
rescued. Monley also lost his mother and his
brothers in the disaster, making him the only
survivor of the quake from his immediate
family.
Though McAdoo was technically
Monley's nurse for only a few days, she con
tinued to visit and interact with him through a
French translator. When it came time for the
team to leave, IMC psychologists gave
Monley a family of four mice, hoping they
would help him cope with the loss of his fam
ily and nurse.
"Monley grabbed the tail of the mom
mouse and the tail of the boy mouse and tied
them together," McAdoo said. "Even though

we couldn't communicate with each other,
that was his way of saying he didn't want me
to go."

Gardner echoed McAdoo's respect for the
Haitian people, saying they demonstrated a
strength and resilience uncommon in these
types of disasters.
"[The Haitians] had no unreal expecta
tions of people doing anything for them," he
said. "They were extremely grateful for any
care they received instead of feeling like it
was owed to them."
The Stanford team remained in Haiti for
approximately two weeks, flying out on the
morning of Jan. 29 after handing over the
reins to Haitian physicians. Though they
accomplished much during their stay, the
team members realized the work has only
begun.
"We wanted to do what was right and
empower other people," Auerbach said. "The
earthquake created an entire generation of
amputees, people who will need prosthetics,
therapy, plastic surgery. There's infectious dis
ease and homelessness. We weren't so much
rebuilding a medical infrastructure as creating
one."

aftermath. Gardner was part of an eight-person team including four Stanford doctors
and four nurses that traveled to Haiti to provide aid and medical support.
For Dr. Bob Norris and his team, the
term "call of duty" took on new
meaning the morning of Jan. 13. Less
than 24 hours after a 7.0 magnitude
earthquake rocked Haiti, Norris, the
chief of the Division of Emergency Medicine
at Stanford, was leading a departmental meet
ing when he received a phone call. It was a
colleague from the Washington, D.C.-based
International Medical Core (IMC).
Dr. Paul Auerbach, Stanford physician and
the former chief of the ER Division, saw
Norris on the phone and immediately knew

what the call would be about.

"We looked at each other," Auerbach said.
"I asked him.'We're going someplace, right?"'
IMC had requested that Norris put togeth
er a medical team to assist in the relief efforts
in Haiti. Dr. Lan Brown and Dr. Anil Menon,
two emergency medicine physicians present
at the meeting, volunteered immediately.
Norris then sent out an e-mail asking for nurs
es. Three Stanford Hospital nurses, Gaby
McAdoo, Heather Tilson and Julie Rachioppi,
as well as one traveling nurse, Jonathan
Gardner, answered the request.
In the two days between the call and their
Friday departure, the eight-person team could
only imagine the devastation that awaited
them. News reports estimated that over
200,000 had perished from the natural disas
ter, with another 300,000 injured. Over a quar
ter of a million homes had been leveled by the
quake, which had its epicenter about 16 miles
from the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince.
"I don't think any of us really knew what
we were going to face," said Menon, who had
also worked in the field in Afghanistan. "It's
one thing to watch the news and it's another
thing to see bodies and smell infection."
With $lB,OOO worth of medical supplies in
tow, the team traveled for three days, depart
ing from San Francisco International Airport
and stopping in Santo Domingo in the
Dominican Republic. They waited in Santo
Domingo for a half a day for a scheduled
flight that never materialized with planes
working overtime to ship in needed aid.

Rightfully impatient, the team soon real
ized their utility was dwindling with each pass
ing minute.
"Every moment we weren't there, we
knew there was somebody we could have
saved," said Gardner, who been on vacation in
Lake Tahoe when he received Norris' e-mail.
By late Saturday evening, the physicians
and nurses, unable to wait any longer, piled
their supplies into rented vans. After a 10-
hour ride, the group arrived at the Haitian
border Sunday morning. With the sun rising,
after making their way through the Haitian
mainland to the coast, team members finally
laid eyes on the devastated capital, the streets
filled with debris and human bodies.
"Hands were reaching up everywhere,"
Norris said. "Everyone was trying to get help
for their loved ones."
With the aid of Haitian police, the convoy
arrived safely at the University Hospital com
pound in Port-au-Prince, Auerbach estimated
that upon their arrival, the compound was
holding between 750 and 800 patients and
their families. Due to the structural instability
of the building, which made it vulnerable to
aftershocks, and the sheer crowding of the
complex, workers began setting up tents out
