## Investment responsibility panel meets 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Caroline Chen 
The Advisory Panel on
Investment Responsibility held a
town hall meeting last night to
inform the Stanford community
about their role in the University's
investment policies. Subcommittees
on diversity, sustainability, human
rights and labor presented overviews
of their issues and goals for the
upcoming year.
The panel comprises undergradu
ate and graduate students, faculty,
alumni and senior administrators.
Together, they review shareholder
resolutions, monitor companies and
advise the University's Board of
Trustees on important social and eth
ical issues.
Internet access and privacy has
become one of the most important
issues for the panel this year.
"Since the Beijing summer
Olympics last year, we have noticed
an increase in shareholder resolution
concerning Internet access," said
Linda Kimball, manager of
Investment Responsibility.
Panel intern Xochitl Watts 'l2 also
reported on concerns about censor
ship and confidentiality since the
recent cyber attack on Google that
originated in China. One of the
hacked Google accounts belonged to
a Stanford student, Tenzin Seldon 'l2.
In response to these concerns, the
panel members said they will careful
ly monitor shareholder resolutions
concerning Internet confidentiality
and update their proxy voting guide
lines accordingly.
However, Stanford does not initi
ate or sponsor resolutions, and the
panel only considers advising divest
ment when a company does not
respond to shareholder resolutions.
"I know the process sounds slow
to students who are only here for
four years," Kimball said. "But that's

the way things are. And in the end,
down the road, things will change."
