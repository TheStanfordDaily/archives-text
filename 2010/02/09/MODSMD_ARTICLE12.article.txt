# NSF funds Stanford-Cal biotech lab

### DAILY NEWS STAFF – An Le Nguyen 
The National Science Foundation
(NSF) recently awarded a $1.4 mil
lion grant to scientists at Stanford
and UC Berkeley to fund Biofab, a
biofabrication laboratory that aims
to manufacture standardized DNA
parts.
The NSF grant is supplemented
by matching funds from the
Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory (LBNL) and the
Bioßricks Foundation.
Drew Endy, an assistant profes
sor of bioengineering at Stanford,
will head the project with Bio Fab
co-director Adam Arkin, a profes
sor of bioengineering at UC
Berkeley. Endy also serves as the
president of the Bioßricks
Foundation.
Endy said Biofab will be dedicat
ed to making synthetic DNA parts
more accessible. Standardized DNA
pieces present numerous opportu
nities to the biotechnology industry
and academia, but are both expen
sive and time-intensive. The manu
facture of a single synthetic DNA
part can cost millions of dollars and
requires years of work.
The Biofab researchers hope to
make these DNA parts readily avail
able to scientists in the near future.
