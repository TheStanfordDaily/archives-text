## JUST A THOUGHT Full of sound and fury 
### Nikola Milanovic 
Gee whiz, I hope we go to war with a
foreign power or get invaded by
aliens soon. Imagine the camaraderie
and sense of unity that would emerge: cohe
sive bonds formed between flagrant abor
tionists and hard-line Catholics, rural white
supremacists and Marxist Black Panthers,
vehement feminists and old-boy male chau
vinists. The "us vs. them" mentality is a useful
tool both for erecting and for overcoming in
terpersonal boundaries in society.
The sense of the "other" is an om
nipresent reality. As people, we find it easier
to conceptualize the world broken down into
the groups we identify with versus those we
do not. As a philosophy major, I tend to over
think these things. As a Serb, this question
has a poignantly personal relevance (yes, this
column is all about me). I found myself won
dering a few years ago exactly how people
who live as neighbors for so long become
such fervent enemies.
This is not a novel point. Daily columnists
probably write this same article on average
once a quarter. My predecessor Molly
Spaeth eloquently noted in the fall how cam
pus liberals tend to demonize campus con
servatives. Though the thought is not new,
there is something I want to flesh out: the un
derlying implications for us when we use po
larizing language to paint "them" in a bad
light.
This is something relevant to any group of
people who contrast themselves from their
opponents: Republicans, immigrants, De
mocrats, homosexuals, Muslims. Rhetoric
tends to be bitingly divisive and polarizing in
order to establish who the good guys and bad
guys are.
But this feature goes beyond slogans and
rallying cries: it exists in our basic framework
for understanding ourselves. In each group's
categorization of itself rests an implication of
who the "enemy" is. Pro-life and pro-choice
are two categorizations that make this obvi
ous: no group would classify itself as anti-life
or anti-choice. By placing the value in the
name, these groups create the implication
that their opponents are against their ideals.
Nobody thinks life is not valuable, but the
classification of people as "pro-life" is meant
to make us presuppose that those outside
their group are against life.
Though this thought is not a revelation, its
implications are rarely hashed out as much as
they should be. In every group's rhetoric is
the message that the enemy exists to thwart
the group's agenda. However, no group ex
ists solely for schadenfreude, and this is oft
overlooked. Gay rights activists will demo
nize Prop. 8 supporters, arguing that Prop. 8
exists only to marginalize homosexuals.
Prop. 8 supporters will paint a picture of gay
rights activists asserting that they only want
to undermine marriage.
The truth is that group agendas are self-in
terested. Gay rights activists want civil liber
ties they feel are due to them; Prop. 8 sup
porters want to protect the sanctity of an in
stitution they hold sacred. Neither side works
with the sole sadistic motive of thwarting the
other. But civil leaders, all spit and spite and
no delight, misconstrue this fact. Tliey use
these divisions to categorize people who are
much more complex than their simplified at
tributes. My being pro-choice would associ-

ate me with others who are, implying that I
am not Christian and I am likely a supporter
of gay marriage, a liberal and a Democrat.
And so the us-them mentality allows us to
conveniently compartmentalize people who
would otherwise be much more multifac
eted. In a sense, it lets us see who our friends
are and (just as importantly) who they are
not. This mentality explains why polemics
like Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich come
to be figureheads of their parties. Well I have
had it! I hope others will join me in my hope
that we get involved in some all-encompass
ing war that allows us to overcome these arti
ficial barriers to collaboration. The only way
to get past the us vs. them mentality that di
vides us is by creating a bigger us vs. them.
For historical examples of the rally
round-the-flag effect of a higher cause, just
look at black soldiers who came home from
World War 11. The mentality of many who
were formerly complacent with segregation
changed abruptly. People began thinking, "if
this man is worthy enough to serve our coun
try on the battlefield, he's worthy enough to
share my drinking fountain." Heck, maybe if
we have World War 111, we'll finally knock
out all the divisions that separate us and gain
an appreciation for the values we hold in
common! (Whoever said that total war was
such a bad thing?)

I, for one, will be happily flagging down
the Martians when they start invading, secure
in my belief that, with a new "them," we will
all become "us."

I forgot to introduce myself. Hi, I'm Nik. This is
my column. Any thoughts? E-mail them to

I found myself
wondering [...]
exactly how
people who live
as neighbors for so
long become such
fervent enemies.
