## Consider boycotting marriage as an institution 
### 
In the arena of queer rights, I can think of
several issues more important to me than
marriage: trans-bashing, safe sex educa
tion, religious intolerance, employment dis
crimination, adoption rights, hospital visita
tion, immigration laws, military provisions,
internalized racism and so on. And yet, I
work for the National Marriage Boycott, an
organization that seeks to overturn the De
fense of Marriage Act (DOMA) through
grassroots organizing, and a pledge not to get
married until we all can. Don't get me wrong
the arguments for marriage equality are
powerful. Same-sex couples are denied 1,138
rights as a result of discriminatory policy,
among them social security pension, survivor
benefits and medical decision-making. I am
more interested in the rights themselves than
the label "marriage." So why do I support a
boycott on marriage? It seems radical, un
necessary even. Perhaps we can go on sup
porting the heterosexual exclusivity of the in
stitution while working for queer rights in
other contexts.

And if social justice activism operated in a
vacuum, I would wholeheartedly support
that notion. Yet the fundamental nature of
fighting for rights, or speaking up for margin
alized communities, means that what plays
out on a grand national scale affects every in
dividual in that particular community. Mar
riage equality is no longer a battle over tax
incentives or churches, but about real human
lives. I am not totally satisfied that the queer
rights movement has chosen to focus on mar

riage, which at its core is an overly tradition
al and dated institution. But such is the na
ture of current politics and I will work
with it. My friends, fellow activists and I will
work within this framework because this is
our best shot at raising public consciousness
and telling queer youth everywhere that the
world cares. Queer youth are over eight
times more likely than their straight peers to
attempt suicide, and many feel unsafe in their
schools and neighborhoods. I contend that
boycotting marriage, in this context, is not
radical but an act of fundamental compas
sion. This is not to say that I do not appreci
ate the sacrifice that straight allies make
when they sign the marriage boycott pledge
or wear an equality ring in support. I under
stand that marriage is a social institution with
deep roots and one that carries a lot of cultur
al value, but is this pledge too outlandish
when it can express kindness and build a sup
port network?

With Valentine's Day fast approaching, I
ask that you think about the often commer
cialized, but well-intentioned manifestations
of love that accompany this holiday and con
sider how pledging to boycott marriage can
be another outlet for this love. It seems a con
tradiction in terms, but truly, by emphasizing
connectedness, we better our social and po
litical environments. And perhaps then
Valentine's Day can take on a more ideal
meaning as an occasion rooted in social jus
tice and compassion.
