# INNOVATE AMERICA
## Educating the Energy Generation 
### Teryn Norris 
Last week, the Obama administration
introduced a proposal that every col
lege student in the country should
know about. It represents the nation's first
comprehensive federal program for clean en
ergy education, and it is a critical step toward
regaining American leadership in one of the
most important industries of our time.
Over the past two years, a growing num
bers of experts have called for federal pro
grams to develop the country's clean ener
gy workforce. In April 2009, President
Obama took up these calls by announcing
the first nationwide initiative to inspire and
train young Americans "to tackle the single
most important challenge of their genera
tion the need to develop cheap, abun
dant, clean energy and accelerate the tran
sition to a low carbon economy."
The proposal, called RE-ENERGYSE
(Regaining our Energy Science and Engi
neering Edge), is part of the administra
tion's 2011 budget request, which will be
considered by Congress in the months
ahead. With oversight by the Department
of Energy and National Science Founda
tion, it would educate thousands of clean
energy scientists and engineers, beginning
with $74 million for energy-related pro
grams at universities, community and tech
nical colleges and K-12 schools.
"In order to make the leap in global en
ergy technology leadership, the U.S. must
also make the leap in energy education,"
states the Department of Energy's propos
al. "This effort will help universities and
community colleges develop cutting edge
programs, with redesigned and new curric
ula to produce tens of thousands of other
highly skilled U.S. workers who can sustain
American excellence in clean energy in in
dustry, trades, academia, the federal gov
ernment and National Laboratories."

The U.S. is falling behind in the rapidly
growing clean energy industry, and our ed
ucational system and workforce is not pre
pared to compete. The U.S. energy industry
expects that half its employees will retire
over the next decade, and while Stanford

has significant programs in the area, the
majority of our colleges and universities
lack degree programs focused on energy.
Americans students earned only 11 percent
of the world's 4 million science and engi
neering bachelor's degrees in 2006, com
pared to 21 percent in China and 19 percent
in the European Union. These degrees are
only about one-third of U.S. bachelor's de
grees, compared to 63 percent in Japan, 53
percent in China and 51 percent in Singa
pore.

Fortunately, the U.S. has a history of
catching up in strategic industries, and fed
eral investment in education is a core strat
egy. Fifty years ago, immediately after the
Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the United
States mobilized to lead the space race and
regain our scientific and technological com
petitiveness. The National Defense Educa
tion Act of 1958, for example, trained thou
sands of young scientists and engineers who
helped put a man on the moon and develop
the technologies that catapulted our world
into the Information Age.

In 2008, my colleagues and I at the
Breakthrough Institute proposed a Nation
al Energy Education Act, modeled after
this legislation for the clean energy sector.
RE-ENERGYSE is a significant step to
ward such a full-scale program. The federal
government has started to address the need
for green technician training, but it has not
implemented a higher education strategy to
keep the U.S. at the leading edge of energy
science, technology and innovation. Ac
cording to the Department of Energy, "The
U.S. ranks behind other major nations in

making the transitions required to educate
students for emerging energy trades, re
search efforts and other professions to sup
port the future energy technology mix."
That is why an alliance of student and
youth-led groups, including groups at Stan
ford University, is launching the ReEner
gyse Campaign to mobilize and empower
young people to advance this proposal
through Congress in 2010. In the current
political climate, RE-ENERGYSE needs a
strong base of support to pass Congress,
and as the primary stakeholders in the pro
gram, young people can be particularly in
fluential in organizing a coalition of sup
porters and directly voicing their concerns
to members of Congress.

This national campaign, coordinated by
Americans for Energy Leadership
(www.leadenergy.org), will feature a vari
ety of activities, including a student govern
ment presidents sign-on letter organized by
Stanford's David Gobaud, a RE-ENER
GYSE lobby day in DC, meetings and pub
lic events with members of Congress, op
eds in newspapers and online outlets, re
search reports and articles about energy ed
ucation programs, video and photo peti
tioning and more. Through smart organiz
ing and advocacy, young people can be the
driving force to achieve this program.
The global clean energy race represents
one of the greatest challenges and opportu
nities for American leadership in a genera
tion, and now is a critical moment. If we do
not immediately implement a national
strategy for energy leadership including
smart investments to educate the energy
generation we will miss a historic oppor
tunity to strengthen our economy, create
new jobs, improve our energy security and
lead the world in confronting climate
change. The choice should be clear.

The global clean energy race represents
one of the greatest challenges and opportu
nities for American leadership in a genera
tion, and now is a critical moment. If we do
not immediately implement a national
strategy for energy leadership including
smart investments to educate the energy
generation we will miss a historic oppor
tunity to strengthen our economy, create
new jobs, improve our energy security and
lead the world in confronting climate
change. The choice should be clear.
