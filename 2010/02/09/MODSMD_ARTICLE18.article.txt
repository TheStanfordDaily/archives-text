## Head-to-Head: Do we need more March Madness? Bigger is better, and only fair 
### Taylor Savage 
March Madness one
month of high-intensity
basketball. The most uni
versally cherished college
sport playoff system, espe
cially when put side-by-side with the
money-filled cesspit that is the BCS. And it
could get bigger. And bigger is always better.
Expanding the NCAA Tournament
from 65 to 96 teams would not be the com
petitive Armageddon that my esteemed
colleague Sawhney may claim. I'll concede
one point: it's all about the money. But what
isn't? The added revenue and exposure
would benefit not only the league but also
the schools and ultimately the student
athletes. Along with an expansion, the
NCAA would most likely sell the TV rights

to cable (likely
the biggest cap
ture for ESPN
since Monday
Night Football),
greatly expanding
the viewing avail
ability of games.
And for me, the ex
perienced couch
sitter and channel
changer extraordi
naire, my month
long LCD trip could be lengthened
and strengthe.ne.d.

An expanded field of play would also
take some power from the Men-Behind
the-Curtain Selection Committee and
allow the bubble teams and mid-major
standouts to have a better chance of pro
longing their season. As it stands, the 65-
team tournament only includes 18 percent
of teams in the league compare this to
the 56 percent of college football teams or
53 percent of NBA teams that make it to the
postseason. That makes the Big Dance a
very exclusive club with an already largely
arbitrary bouncer.
And dilute the competitiveness of the
tournament? Please. Never, since the instal
lation of the 64-team tournament in 1985,
has a 16-seed beaten a one-seed. Only five
have come within five points. Expanding
and inserting a pre-round of sorts would
add well-matched competitive games and
more upsets, overtimes and bracket
busters. It would make sure that the most
qualified low-end teams end up challenging
the one-seeds, supplementing everything
we know and love about March Madness.
