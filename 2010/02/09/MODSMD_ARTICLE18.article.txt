## Head-to-Head: Do we need more March Madness? Bigger is better, and only fair 
### Taylor Savage 
March Madness one
month of high-intensity
basketball. The most uni
versally cherished college
sport playoff system, espe
cially when put side-by-side with the
money-filled cesspit that is the BCS. And it
could get bigger. And bigger is always better.
Expanding the NCAA Tournament
from 65 to 96 teams would not be the com
petitive Armageddon that my esteemed
colleague Sawhney may claim. I'll concede
one point: it's all about the money. But what
isn't? The added revenue and exposure
would benefit not only the league but also
the schools and ultimately the student
athletes. Along with an expansion, the
NCAA would most likely sell the TV rights

to cable (likely
the biggest cap
ture for ESPN
since Monday
Night Football),
greatly expanding
the viewing avail
ability of games.
And for me, the ex
perienced couch
sitter and channel
changer extraordi
naire, my month
long LCD trip could be lengthened
and strengthe.ne.d.

An expanded field of play would also
take some power from the Men-Behind
the-Curtain Selection Committee and
allow the bubble teams and mid-major
standouts to have a better chance of pro
longing their season. As it stands, the 65-
team tournament only includes 18 percent
of teams in the league compare this to
the 56 percent of college football teams or
53 percent of NBA teams that make it to the
postseason. That makes the Big Dance a
very exclusive club with an already largely
arbitrary bouncer.
And dilute the competitiveness of the
tournament? Please. Never, since the instal
lation of the 64-team tournament in 1985,
has a 16-seed beaten a one-seed. Only five
have come within five points. Expanding
and inserting a pre-round of sorts would
add well-matched competitive games and
more upsets, overtimes and bracket
busters. It would make sure that the most
qualified low-end teams end up challenging
the one-seeds, supplementing everything
we know and love about March Madness.

More long-shots make for more Cin
derellas, and God knows we love our
Cinderellas.

The current format is not some age
old tradition handed down to us on
stone tablets along with the Ten Com
mandments. The tournament has ex
panded 10 times since 1939 from eight
teams to the current 65, the last change
coming in 2001 as the opening-round
play-in was added. A bump up to 96
would not be that radical; the league
has grown from 282 D-I teams in 1985,
when the tournament first grew to in
clude 64 teams, to 334 teams today.
That's a lot of new teams being robbed
of their playoff berths.
Additional spots in the tournament
would bring in more of the grossly
overlooked, awkward middle children

of college sports the mid-major
teams giving them their overdue
shots at titles. Teams from what are es
sentially one-bid conferences must win
their conference tournament to play in
March Madness; their regular seasons
become completely irrelevant. These
potential dark horses are cast aside
with little thought. Take Hofstra, 2006,
Colonial Athletic Association. The
team beats George Mason twice in
four games, including in the semis of
the conference tournament, but loses
in the finals. Their bubble is popped,
they're passed over like the ugly girl at
a party, but George Mason makes it in
and continues on an unlikely streak to
the Final Four. With an extra round,
teams like Hoftstra have a shot to show
what they can do. Get rid of the mid
major-devouring and shamefully irrel
evant NIT; hand out automatic bids to
conference tournament winners as
well as regular season winners, and
spread the love.
For all the noise being made by

change-haters about the expansion, it
has a large number of proponents.
Coach K likes it, saying, "That would
add more relevance to the regular sea
son, instead of just having big games
being bracket busters and things like
that." Pat Knight likes it, saying, "If
you're talking about adding more
teams, I don't think the games would
change a bit. They'd be just as competi
tive and I think you'd see more Cin
derella stories, more teams people did
n't think had a chance and there'd be a
lot more upsets if the NCAA expand
ed the tournament." The NCAA cer
tainly likes it, coming off an 11-year, six
billion-dollar contract with CBS and
looking to up the ante. And the average
fan will like it, with more basketball
and more excitement.

In a year or two, expect to be happi
ly filling out your beautifully lopsided
brackets.
