# NCAA shouldn't change a good thing
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
As we get closer to the excite
ment of March Madness, nu
merous stories have emerged
indicating that the NCAA is
strongly considering expand
ing the NCAA men's basketball tourna
ment, which currently includes 65 teams in a
single-elimination format, to a field of 96
teams. Such an expansion would have many
downsides and only a single benefit: more
money for the NCAA and its member
schools. In light of this, it is obvious that ex
pansion would be bad for competition and
for college basketball fans everywhere.
To start, let's look at the motivation for
expansion.There are two college sports that
are major revenue earners: football and
men's basketball. However, the conferences

and the individual
schools control most
of the revenue in
football. The schools
take all ticket re
ceipts and merchan
dising revenue, and
) the conferences control
y the (highly lucrative)
media contracts. For exam
ple, the Southeastern Conference
recently signed a 15-year deal with
ESPN, worth around $2 billion, to tele
vise SEC football. Out of this money,
e NCAA only gets a small cut.

By contrast, the NCAA controls the bas
ketball tournament and thus receives its
media revenue. Given the popularity of
March Madness, it is no surprise that this
deal is the NCAA's single largest source of
money. By one estimate from the Sports
Business Journal, more than 90 percent of
the NCAA's annual revenue comes from
this one deal.
Numerous college basketball coaches
have also come out in support of expansion.
Obviously, a bigger field would give more
schools a chance to get in the tournament
and thus to get a slice of the money it gener
ates. Given the tournament's wild unpre
dictability, it would also give more teams a
chance to go deep into the tournament, even
if they had a sub-par regular season.
However, the downsides to expansion
would be significant for fans and certainly
outweigh the proposed financial benefits for
the NCAA. To start, an expanded tourna
ment would render the regular season even
more meaningless than it already is. When
mediocre teams can make the 96-team field
and have the same chance at a title as
the top-ranked teams in the nation,
what's the point of playing to win in the
regular season? It could come to the
point where the only people who care
about the regular season are fans of
.500 teams that end up on the bubble
going into Selection Sunday.
Expansion would also be to the
detriment of the so-called "mid-ma
jors," whose tendency to generate big
upsets of established programs has
been a key feature of recent tourna
ments. The majority of the extra at
large bids would probably go to schools
from the major BCS conferences. Even
the atrocious Pac-10 would probably
get three or four bids in such a system.
Perhaps even more importantly,
the 32 games of the first round would
essentially be play-in games to take on
the 32 highest seeds, which would re

ceive a bye. The seeding would also
favor schools from the bigger confer
ences, as mid-majors have historically
received lower seeds even with equiv
alent or better records (since major
conference competition is seen as
tougher). Thus, smaller schools would
knock each other out of the tourna
ment in the play-in games and there
would be fewer in the main tourna
ment, even if they nominally received
more bids than before.

Tournament expansion would also
destroy one of the most hallowed parts
of the tournament: the bracket. The
bracket is already quite large, so ex
panding it further would just add chaos
and confusion for the average fan. It
would also make the ritual of filling out
the bracket more difficult, as an ex
panded bracket wouldn't fit on the av
erage piece of paper.
The tournament's new format, with
two rounds of 64, would also destroy
the bracket's simplicity. It would be
asymmetrical and daunting to fill out,
diminishing its appeal. The bracket has
been arguably the most important fea

ture of the tournament fans that
never watch college basketball during
the season even fill them out and follow
their picks through the ups and downs
of March.

Lastly, and perhaps most important
ly, a bigger tournament would be detri
mental to student-athletes. The tourna
ment already spans three weeks and
causes athletes to miss a lot of class
time. In its pursuit of profits, the N CAA
has conveniently ignored the academic
ramifications of expansion. This lack of
recognition becomes even more ridicu
lous when you consider the fact that op
ponents of a football playoff (many of
whom are inside the NCAA) cite ath
letes missing class as an argument
against instituting a playoff.
The NCAA risks falling into the
same trap as the football conferences
pursuing profit even if it detrimen
tally affects the sport. I can only hope
that it comes to its senses and maintains
some semblance of athletic purity.
