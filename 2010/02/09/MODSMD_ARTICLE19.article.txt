# NCAA shouldn't change a good thing

As we get closer to the excite
ment of March Madness, nu
merous stories have emerged
indicating that the NCAA is
strongly considering expand
ing the NCAA men's basketball tourna
ment, which currently includes 65 teams in a
single-elimination format, to a field of 96
teams. Such an expansion would have many
downsides and only a single benefit: more
money for the NCAA and its member
schools. In light of this, it is obvious that ex
pansion would be bad for competition and
for college basketball fans everywhere.
To start, let's look at the motivation for
expansion.There are two college sports that
are major revenue earners: football and
men's basketball. However, the conferences

and the individual
schools control most
of the revenue in
football. The schools
take all ticket re
ceipts and merchan
dising revenue, and
) the conferences control
y the (highly lucrative)
media contracts. For exam
ple, the Southeastern Conference
recently signed a 15-year deal with
ESPN, worth around $2 billion, to tele
vise SEC football. Out of this money,
e NCAA only gets a small cut.

By contrast, the NCAA controls the bas
ketball tournament and thus receives its
media revenue. Given the popularity of
March Madness, it is no surprise that this
deal is the NCAA's single largest source of
money. By one estimate from the Sports
Business Journal, more than 90 percent of
the NCAA's annual revenue comes from
this one deal.
Numerous college basketball coaches
have also come out in support of expansion.
Obviously, a bigger field would give more
schools a chance to get in the tournament
and thus to get a slice of the money it gener
ates. Given the tournament's wild unpre
dictability, it would also give more teams a
chance to go deep into the tournament, even
if they had a sub-par regular season.
However, the downsides to expansion
would be significant for fans and certainly
outweigh the proposed financial benefits for
the NCAA. To start, an expanded tourna
ment would render the regular season even
more meaningless than it already is. When
mediocre teams can make the 96-team field
