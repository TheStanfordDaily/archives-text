# SWIMMING PAST SOCAL

### CHRIS DERRICK 
Stanford swimming has a long tradition of ex
cellence in a variety of events. That tradition was
alive and well this weekend, as Stanford was led
by a trio of senior All-Americans to wins over
Cal State Bakersfield and No. 13 USC. Satur
day's 174-124 victory over the Trojans was the
more important victory for the No. 2 Cardinal.
Seniors David Mosko, David Dunford and
Eugene Godsoe each won two individual events.
Godsoe swept the backstroke events and also
came in second in the 100-yard butterfly. Dun
ford took the freestyle sprints (50 and 100 yards)
and led off the winning 200-yard freestyle relay
while Mosko won the 200-yard butterfly and
500-yard freestyle.

Godsoe has been dominant all season, but
Mosko and Dunford arguably had breakout
performances. They appear poised to step up for
the Cardinal as the team tries to rebound from a
dual-meet loss to Arizona two weeks ago and
the loss of NCAA 100-yard butterfly champion
Austin Staab. A junior, Staab is on a leave of ab
sence from the team.

"Personally, it was nice to get a couple of vic
tories against USC," Dunford said. "The times
weren't quite as fast as I had hoped, but at this

point it's still all about racing and so I'm happy
that I managed to get my hand on the wall first."
Dunford's assessment echoed the pre-race
comments of head coach Skip Kenney, who said
that this year is all about "relearning how to
swim."

The seniors were not the only group of Cardi
nal men to make strong contributions this week
end. The sophomore class, headed by Curtis

Lovelace and Chad La Tourette, also had some
standout performances. Lovelace won the 200-
yard breaststroke and La Tourette lead a first
second-third sweep of the 1650-yard freestyle.
Following la Tourrette were fellow sopho
mores Justin Scheid and Michael Zoldos. The
Cardinal men also swept the 200-yard back
stroke with a quartet of Godsoe, freshmen
Matthew Thompson and Matthew Swanston
and sophomore Geoff Cheah. Thompson also
added a win in the 200-yard IM.
The meet was close until the ninth event,
when four consecutive wins by Godsoe, Dun
ford, Mosko and Lovelace gave the Cardinal a
commanding lead that it would not relinquish.

"The meet was still close before the 100 free
and we knew that as they were announcing the
score before each event, so I knew how impor
tant it was for us to win the 100 free," Dunford
said. "After that they didn't have much chance of
stopping us."

Ilie Bakersfield meet on Friday saw a num
ber of athletes swimming in their off-events.
Long distance specialist Scheid, for example,
swam the 50-yard freestyle. The Cardinal still
bested its weaker opponent 162.5-121.5, win-

GAME NOTES: The No. 2 Cardinal soundly defeated USC

Feb. 20.

Senior swimmer David Mosko, above, helped lead his team to victory over No. 13 USC by winning both the 200-yard butterfly and 500-yard freestyle.
Two of his classmates, David Dunford and Eugene Godsoe, also won two indvidual events as Stanford defeated the Trojans, 174-124.

ning 11 individual events and two
relays in the process.
Stanford's winners included jun
ior John Criste in the 200-yard
breaststroke, sophomore Bobby
Bollier in the 200-yard freestyle, and
Swanston in the 50-yard freestyle.
A number of the times posted
this weekend were fast enough to
earn NCAA 'B' cuts, meaning they
have a possibility of reaching the
NCAA championships. Three swim
mers, La Tourette in the 1650-yard
free, Mosko in the 200-yard butter
fly and Godsoe in the 100-yard
backstroke, posted times that would
traditionally qualify them for
NCAAs, but it is unlikely that they
will have to rely on those marks, as
they have either swum faster this
year or will likely do so at Pac-lOs
when they are more rested.
The Cardinal will end its regular
season on February 20th at home
against Cal.
