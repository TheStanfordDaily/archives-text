# CARD SENDS ONE TO NATIONAL TEAM
## 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One Stanford gymnast remains on the
U.S. Men's Senior National Team after this
weekend's Winter Cup Challenge in Las
Vegas, Nev. Traveling with five of his fellow
Cardinal gymnasts, junior co-captain Tim
Gentry emerged from the two-day competi
tion with a fifth place finish in the all-around,
winning him an automatic berth on the na
tional team.

National team membership is both much
coveted and extremely temporary. Each year,
gymnasts have two opportunities to make the
national team the first chance in February
at the Winter Cup Challenge and the second
in August at the Visa Championship. At each
competition, 15 men are selected to represent
the US in national and international compe
tition. Ten of those 15 are the gymnasts who
earned the greatest number of points in each
challenge; the other five are chosen by the
Men's Program Committee or petition. Thus,
the makeup of the team essentially changes
every six months.
For Gentry, a 2009 national team member,
this year's Winter Cup was filled with a bit
more pressure than last year's competition
for that very reason.
"Last August, when I first made the team,
there really wasn't any pressure to perform
because no one expected me to make the
team," Gentry said. "This time, the expecta
tions were a little bit higher because I wanted
to keep my spot on the team."
For junior Alex Buscaglia, another 2009
national team member, the pressure was al
most too much.
"I put more pressure on myself" he said. "I
didn't want to let myself down or my coach."
In the end, though, Buscaglia who has
looked up to the guys on the national team
since he was a little kid, flipping and twisting
on the mats at his local gym —came just short

of the stellar performance he needed to se
cure a spot on the 2010 team.
In his first day of competition, Buscaglia
posted a stellar 16.0 on vault and a solid 14.3
on floor exercise. In the second day of compe
tition, he posted a nice 14.5 on high bar and a
decent 15.85 on vault, but flopped with a 9.75
on pommel horse. By hitting just three rou
tines in two days of competition, he placed
15th in the national points system and just
missed being named to the national team.
Also traveling with Gentry and Buscaglia
to Las Vegas were juniors Josh Dixon and
Ryan Lieberman. Both were legitimate con
tenders for the national team, but had obsta
cles get in the way of their placements.
Dixon, for example, fell ill over the week
end. Lieberman, on the other hand, had a dis
appointing first day that was followed by a
stellar second day, but had lost too much mo
mentum after his debut to make the national
lineup.
In the future, however, Stanford head
coach Thorn Glielmi says the four juniors are
the ones to watch.
"Tim prepared well in practice and deliv
ers in meets ... Alex will make the improve
ments to earn a spot on the team again,"
Glielmi said. "Josh was ill, and I was im
pressed with his ability to get through. These
four are definitely the ones to watch, and our
plan is to get all of them on the national
team."
Besides the juniors, sophomores Cameron
Foreman and John Martin were also present
in Las Vegas. For them, the meet was more to
gain experience at the elite level than to com
pete for a spot on the team.
Joining Gentry on the 2010 senior nation
al team are fellow northern Californians Kyle
Bunthuwong and Glen Ishino of Cal, as well
as 12 other men from universities and gym
nastics training centers across the country.
