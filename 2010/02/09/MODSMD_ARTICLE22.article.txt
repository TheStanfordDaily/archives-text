# Farewell football, hello heartbreak
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
Cue the funeral music, the
black clothes, the tears and
the somber speeches. No,
it's not because the Colts
blew a halftime lead and
Tracy Porter stabbed me straight
where my heart used to be and left me
(and Colts fans everywhere) with the
unbearable pain of a lost Super Bowl.
Okay, so it kind of is.
But most of you out there still lost,
even if you don't know it. Although
you may not care about the Colts and
Saints, or you may get a sadistic pleas
ure in Peyton Manning's pain, or you
may just feel good for the rejuvenation
of New Orleans, you should still be
grieving.
Why?
It is now Feb. 9. The Super Bowl is
over. The Pro Bowl —silly and ridicu
lous as it might be —is over. Even the
Senior Bowl and Signing Day are over.
We are now staring at over half a year
with no football.
I'll just let the weight of that state
ment sink in for a moment here. Sure,
you may say there are glimpses of foot
ball in these intervening months. NFL
Draft talk, spring practices in college
and training camps are ahead. But
when the best thing I have to look for

ward to is debates over how well Tim
Tebow's game will translate to the
pros (it won't, sorry to break it to you),
I can't really count that as football.
I'm sure lots of you aren't ap
proaching the heart attack levels that
I am over the lack of football in our
future. You are just sitting back and
thinking of the other sports you
love —maybe football being over
isn't such a bad thing. I love other
sports too, and I'd just love to agree
and shift my attention to other sports.
But for me, other sports just aren't
cutting it right now.
The main sport on the minds of
Americans right now is basketball
(sony, NHL fans). Stanford basket
ball, as much as I love it, is not the most
fun to watch at the moment. The
women are amazing and dominant,
but no matter what they do now, we're
all just waiting for their seemingly in
evitable matchup with UConn for all
the marbles. So it's hard to get too ex
cited over another Pac-10 thrashing.
The men, on the other hand, seem to
be inclose games every week. The only
problem there is that they can't win
those games. Landry Fields is great to
watch, and when Jeremy Green is on
his game, you can see glimpses of
hope. But last-minute losses and a win
less road record in the Pathetic-10 fail
to get me too excited.

What about the NBA? Leßron
and Kobe battling it out, Dwight
Howard making circus dunks, Kevin
Garnett fighting for every basket...and
that's just the commercials. Well, un
fortunately, the NBA can't seem to
create better entertainment in its
games than in its commercials. Sure,
there are highlights—dunks and
buzzer-beaters are never hard to come
by. But any true basketball fan has to
shiver with fear when turning on an
NBA game, even one without Charles
Barkley's commentary. The NBA has
become more and more like a play
ground, so that now a player getting
randomly slapped in the head at the
buzzer and a "superstar" taking five
steps on a routine drive are common
place, The new "peak" of basketball is
Leßron holding the ball and jab-step
ping for 23 seconds and throwing up a
turnaround 40-footer. Sure, it's im
pressive when he makes it, but I find it
hard to equate that to a two-minute
drill in football or even a really good
end of curling (yeah,it's actually called
an end).
So basketball isn't giving me much
besides March Madness, which is al
ways fun but means a lot more when
Stanford is in contention. And while I
might watch a bit of the Finals, I must
say I'm in the 99.9 percent of the pop
ulation that doesn't really care about

hockey. I try, I really do, but it's hard to
get into it.

What does that leave? The
Olympics are fun, but they're still the
Winter Olympics, so I may actually
have to live up to my promise of
watching curling. Tennis can be fun,
but Nadal is hurt and no one else has
shown the ability to beat Federer con
sistently when it counts. Golf..the fact
that I'm even talking about it says
enough about how bored I'll be. And
who's going to watch golf without
Tiger? There's always baseball, but
games that count are over a month
and a half away, and the stretch run is
still far in the distance.

Which leaves me plenty of time to
replay Sunday's fourth quarter in my
mind. Over and over again.

more hockey at jwjajfe@stanford.edu.
