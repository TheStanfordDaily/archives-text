# CARD WINS QUAD-MEET
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team continues through its win
ning season, it is beginning to realize
how true it is that there's no place like
home. On Sunday, the No. 8 Cardinal

claimed another victory to extend its
unbeaten streak against Pac-10 com
petition at Burnham Pavilion to 30.
Since 1998, the team is 42-1 in its
home gymnasium. At this point, virtu
ally any opposing team can come to
the Farm and expect to come up short
at the end of competition. Thus it was

with great confidence and comfort
that Stanford (196.650) overtook No.
24 Washington (194.075), Sacramento
State (193.225) and San Jose State
(192.800) on Sunday.
Though the win was a product of a
solid team effort, one individual in
particular proved to her coaches and
teammates just how deserving she is
of a spot in the lineup for all four
events. Freshman sensation Ashley
Morgan, who debuted in the all
around, was the primary contributor
to the team's quad-meet victory
Morgan won the vault (9.875) and bal
ance beam (9.875), was second on the
floor (9.90) and sixth on the uneven
bars (9.80). These scores led her to
capture the all-around title with
39.450, which was the most for a
Stanford freshman in three years.
"Morgan had a tremendous day,"
said Stanford head coach Kristen
Smyth, whose team improved to 6-2 as
a result of the win. "She's been work
ing on upgrades on her routines, such
as her dismount on bars. She's a
gamer. She's going to be solid for us."

GAME NOTES: The No. 8 Cardinal women
continued their stellar season last weekend,
taking first in a four-school meet. Freshman
Ashley Morgan set the pace for Stanford,
winning the vault and balance beam while
finishing second on the floor. On Sunday the
Cardinal women will face UCLA, who they
bested 196.425-195.875 two weeks ago.

Freshman Ashley Morgan, above, led her team to victory in last Sunday's quad-meet,
winning both the vault and balance beam events. The Danville, Calif,
native was a four-time Junior Olympic national qualifier.

Pac-10 champion, senior Carly Janiga,
for the all-around title with Stanford's
best all-around individual score of the
season. Yet, both Alexander and Jani
ga were also major contributors to
Stanford's overall season-high team
score, as Alexander scored a 39.300
and Janiga a 39.100.
The highlight of the day for the
team this time came on the beam,
where the Card achieved a season
high 49.075 despite a leadoff fall. Mor
gan, Alexander and junior Danielle
Ikoma tied for first place in the event.
The uneven bars were certainly an
area of success for the team as well, as
Stanford matched its season-best
team score in the event. Janiga and
senior Allyse Ishino, who each scored
9.9255, tied for first, and Ishino's per
formance was a career best.

In fact, Ishino scored a 39.350 in
what was her unofficial first collegiate
all-around.The 2004 Olympic team al
ternate averaged a 9.83 in three events
and scored a 9.85 in the floor exercise
exhibition. Though she has not offi
cially made it into the floor lineup, that
is expected to change next Sunday at
No. 6 UCLA. Her self-choreographed
routine is particularly dynamic and
unique because of only two tumbling
passes and the incorporation of her
dance skills into each performance.
Sophomore Nicole Pechanec also
owned the floor, scoring a 9.925 to
claim first place in the event. The for
mer Czech Republic international has
averaged a 9.91 on floor over the past
three meets.

"She's really a beautiful and artis
tic performer," Smyth said of
Pechanec. "She's really improved her
tumbling and I think she's finally get
ting out the work that she puts in."
Thus due to numerous outstanding
individual performances, Stanford en
ters its next meet with another victory
under its belt. The team is certainly
improving, but it will have to continue
to do so in order to earn a spot in the
Super Six at the end of April.
"We're taking steps in the right di
rection," Smyth said. "We're getting a
little bit better every weekend."
With only one more home meet on
Feb. 28 at Maples Pavilion against
Pac-10 rival California, North Caroli
na and Eastern Michigan, the team
first looks to take down UCLA next
Sunday for the second time this sea
son. The challenge will be greater this
time in the Bruins' gymnasium, but if
the Cardinal women can produce
some of the same high-scoring per
formances from last Sunday, another
upset could be possible.

area of success for the team as well, as
Stanford matched its season-best
team score in the event. Janiga and
senior Allyse Ishino, who each scored
9.9255, tied for first, and Ishino's per
formance was a career best.

In fact, Ishino scored a 39.350 in
what was her unofficial first collegiate
all-around.The 2004 Olympic team al
ternate averaged a 9.83 in three events
and scored a 9.85 in the floor exercise
exhibition. Though she has not offi
cially made it into the floor lineup, that
is expected to change next Sunday at
No. 6 UCLA. Her self-choreographed
routine is particularly dynamic and
unique because of only two tumbling
passes and the incorporation of her
dance skills into each performance.
Sophomore Nicole Pechanec also
owned the floor, scoring a 9.925 to
claim first place in the event. The for
mer Czech Republic international has
averaged a 9.91 on floor over the past
three meets.

"She's really a beautiful and artis
tic performer," Smyth said of
Pechanec. "She's really improved her
tumbling and I think she's finally get
ting out the work that she puts in."
Thus due to numerous outstanding
individual performances, Stanford en
ters its next meet with another victory
under its belt. The team is certainly
improving, but it will have to continue
to do so in order to earn a spot in the
Super Six at the end of April.
"We're taking steps in the right di
rection," Smyth said. "We're getting a
little bit better every weekend."
With only one more home meet on
Feb. 28 at Maples Pavilion against
Pac-10 rival California, North Caroli
na and Eastern Michigan, the team
first looks to take down UCLA next
Sunday for the second time this sea
son. The challenge will be greater this
time in the Bruins' gymnasium, but if
the Cardinal women can produce
some of the same high-scoring per
formances from last Sunday, another
upset could be possible.
