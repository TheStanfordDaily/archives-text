# CARD WINS QUAD-MEET
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team continues through its win
ning season, it is beginning to realize
how true it is that there's no place like
home. On Sunday, the No. 8 Cardinal

claimed another victory to extend its
unbeaten streak against Pac-10 com
petition at Burnham Pavilion to 30.
Since 1998, the team is 42-1 in its
home gymnasium. At this point, virtu
ally any opposing team can come to
the Farm and expect to come up short
at the end of competition. Thus it was

with great confidence and comfort
that Stanford (196.650) overtook No.
24 Washington (194.075), Sacramento
State (193.225) and San Jose State
(192.800) on Sunday.
Though the win was a product of a
solid team effort, one individual in
particular proved to her coaches and
teammates just how deserving she is
of a spot in the lineup for all four
events. Freshman sensation Ashley
Morgan, who debuted in the all
around, was the primary contributor
to the team's quad-meet victory
Morgan won the vault (9.875) and bal
ance beam (9.875), was second on the
floor (9.90) and sixth on the uneven
bars (9.80). These scores led her to
capture the all-around title with
39.450, which was the most for a
Stanford freshman in three years.
"Morgan had a tremendous day,"
said Stanford head coach Kristen
Smyth, whose team improved to 6-2 as
a result of the win. "She's been work
ing on upgrades on her routines, such
as her dismount on bars. She's a
gamer. She's going to be solid for us."
