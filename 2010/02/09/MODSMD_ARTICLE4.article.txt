## Obama proposes more aid 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
President Obama's proposal
last week to increase the federal
education budget could impact
the 14 percent of Stanford stu
dents receiving Pell Grants, fac
ulty and financial aid staff said
this week.
Established in 1972, the Pell
Grant was created to help low
income students get a college
education. The grant is awarded
annually to students who are
able to prove their financial
need via the Free Application
for Federal Student Aid, or
FAFSA, which calculates stu
dents' "expected family contri
butions" to their education
costs. Obama's plan would
bring the federal education dis
cretionary budget to $49.7 bil-
lion a 7.5 percent increase over this
year and step up the amount of
assistance offered to each student
who depends on financial aid. The
amount of the Pell grant would grow
by the rate of inflation plus one per
cent, bringing the grant from today's
$5,550 to about $6,900 in 2019.
"This is one of the largest federal
programs to affect low-income stu
dents," said Eric Bettinger, a professor
in Stanford's School of Education.
"It's this program. We don't have
much else."
According to Bettinger, Pell
Grants have not grown with the infla
tion rate or the rising cost of educa
tion in past decades. Anthony
Antonio, another education professor
at Stanford, agreed.
"The value of the Pell Grant has
not kept up with rising college costs so
their effectiveness in providing access

to low-income students has dimin
ished greatly," Antonio wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
According to both professors, this
additional federal aid could create sig
nificant opportunities: more students
could opt to attend a higher-cost uni
versity rather than limit their choices
to lower-cost community colleges.
"This isn't going to be a magic bul
let that would make families who
weren't originally going to attend go,"
Bettinger said. "But it's a step in the
right direction for bringing in low
income families."
Simplifying the EAFSA, which is
notoriously long and tedious, may
present a welcome change for stu
dents. According to Karen Cooper,
director of the Office of Financial
Aid, about 50 percent of undergradu
ates and 1,000 graduate students fill
out the FAFSA each year.
"This used to be a form that made
you cry when you had to do it,"
Bettinger said. "It has definitely
become simpler."
Though many students rely on the
FAFSA, Bettinger believes that its

impact will be felt less at Stanford
than on other campuses.
"If you're savvy enough to get into
Stanford, you're probably savvy
enough to ... get all of these forms
done on your own," Bettinger said.
Bettinger and Antonio both
expect that increased Pell Grant fund
ing, while valuable, would have a lim
ited impact at Stanford.
"Stanford students are fairly
affluent and are not the target recip
ients of Pell Grants... Stanford
financial aid programs are quite
good for low-income students, espe
cially with the recent policy
changes," Antonio said.
Cooper added, however, that the
plan might loosen strain on the
University budget, making it easier
for Stanford to uphold its financial aid
commitments.

"The Pell Grant is not going to
cover most of the Stanford tuition,"
Cooper said. "But we're certainly
never going to turn any help away."
