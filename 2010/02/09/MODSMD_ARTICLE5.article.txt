# SCHOOLS FUND HAITI RELIEF
## 23 colleges have raised more than $305,000 in a unified relief effort 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
According to the latest statistics
from the ASSU Haiti Earthquake
Response Web site, 3,388 people
from 23 colleges have raised more
than $305,000 in a unified relief
effort benefitting Partners in
Health since the Haiti earthquake
struck Jan. 12.
For the community members
who rallied around the tragedy, the
money was an immediate way to
help an estimated 200,000 injured
and 2 million homeless Haitians in
the wake of the magnitude 7.0
quake.
Dartmouth emerged as a leader
in the fundraising effort, raising
more than $189,000 for the relief
effort in conjunction with Partners
in Health more than any other
participating school.
"We are fundraising because the
one thing we can provide as stu
dents is money for health care and
medicine," said Maura Cass, a co
founder of Students at Dartmouth
for Haiti Relief.
"It's so easy to get captured in
your own moment, your own envi
ronment," Cass added. "But the
Utopia of college is not the real
world, so I think that if you don't
act then no one else will."
Universities across the country
found similar ways to raise money
for Haiti. Facebook groups, which
aimed to raise awareness, sprung
up in a matter of hours. Duke
University, Harvard University,
Howard University, San Jose State
University and UC-Berkeley all
held benefit concerts.
Some schools also found unique
ways to fundraise for Haiti. Notre
Dame donated concession revenue
and collected donations from fans
at men's and women's basketball
games, raising $250,000 in total.
Yale University held a silent auc
tion of student and faculty artwork.
The University of Miami sold shirts
featuring words like "resilience,"
"service" and "pride."
At Stanford, ASSU executives
organized a nationwide university
challenge to raise money for
Partners in Health. The idea for this
competitive fundraiser arose after
ASSU President David Gobaud, a
co-terminal student in computer
science, contacted the Stanford stu
dent body in a campus-wide e-mail.
"We knew we wanted to do
something more ... we knew that
we wanted to get other schools
involved," Gobaud said.
The executives soon introduced

the ASSU Haiti Earthquake
Response Web site. Since the site's
launch, 24 schools have joined the
challenge.
FACE AIDS, a Stanford-found
ed group, joined the Haiti relief ini
tiative with the goal of fundraising
$50,000. The group exceeded its
target goal in six days and accrued
$51,775, said FACE AIDS
Executive Director Julie Veroff 'O7.
"I think one of the fundamental
values underlying Stanford
University and FACE AIDS is
social justice, and I think people
really rallied around the idea that
with a small contribution, people
could really make a difference in
the lives of people who need it
most," Veroff said.
Sterling Stamos, a Menlo Park
based investment firm, matched
the first $50,000 that FACE AIDS
raised. Including this matching
grant, participants in the national
college fundraising challenge have
raised $354,829.
Dartmouth was the first institu
tion to join Stanford's initiative and
expressed its eagerness to partici
pate even before site was launched.
As of Monday, Dartmouth raised
$189,068.
"Dartmouth had an amazing
response," Gobaud said. "I think
Dartmouth, as far as going beyond
fundraising ... did a lot more. And
we want to do more like what they
did."
Leaders at Dartmouth organ
ized immediately. Cass pulled an
all-nighter with fellow Dartmouth
students Alex Schindler and
Frances Vernon to form commit
tees on outreach, communication
and collecting supplies.
"The way to mobilize these 300-
plus people was to break up into
the committees who had already
had a working to-do list of what
needed to be accomplished, so peo
ple could walk away with a specific
set of instructions," said Vernon,
who is also Dartmouth's student
body president.
"It was very grassroots to get
people together," Vernon added.
The other top contributors were
University of Colorado at Boulder
with $10,125, Brown University
with $8,530, and Caltech with
$8,391.
Stanford fundraising was largely
done through outreach to dorm
presidents, collaboration with
Frosh Council and door-to-door
visits by leaders of different cam
pus groups. Stern dining ambassa
dors organized an event called "Heal
Haiti," which raised more than
$3,000. The Graduate School of
Business donated more than $2,000
to Haiti from their weekly social
events.

Medical schools around the coun
try also fundraised to help Haiti.
Teams from the medical schools and

affiliated hospitals at Columbia,
Cornell, Dartmouth, George
Washington, Harvard and Yale trav
eled to Haiti to provide medical serv
ices to the injured. Eight Stanford
physicians and nurses also traveled
to Haiti, carrying with them $lB,OOO
worth of medical supplies.
Michele Barry, senior associate
dean of global health in the School of
Medicine, said that students, staff,
faculty and community members
raised over $182,000 in total.
Stanford University, its medical
school and hospital pledged $167,000

in matching funds. The money will be
donated to Hopital Albert
Schweitzer, one of the few hospitals
still standing in Haiti, Barry said.
"This is going to be a long process
of rehabilitation," Barry said. "This
particular hospital, which has been
there for 50 years, will need more
support, and I'm going to try to
develop a program to support them
in manpower as well as send physi
cians."

co-terminal student in computer
science, contacted the Stanford stu
dent body in a campus-wide e-mail.
"We knew we wanted to do
something more ... we knew that
we wanted to get other schools
involved," Gobaud said.
The executives soon introduced

the ASSU Haiti Earthquake
Response Web site. Since the site's
launch, 24 schools have joined the
challenge.
FACE AIDS, a Stanford-found
ed group, joined the Haiti relief ini
tiative with the goal of fundraising
$50,000. The group exceeded its
target goal in six days and accrued
$51,775, said FACE AIDS
Executive Director Julie Veroff 'O7.
"I think one of the fundamental
values underlying Stanford
University and FACE AIDS is
social justice, and I think people
really rallied around the idea that
with a small contribution, people
could really make a difference in
the lives of people who need it
most," Veroff said.
Sterling Stamos, a Menlo Park
based investment firm, matched
the first $50,000 that FACE AIDS
raised. Including this matching
grant, participants in the national
college fundraising challenge have
raised $354,829.
Dartmouth was the first institu
tion to join Stanford's initiative and
expressed its eagerness to partici
pate even before site was launched.
As of Monday, Dartmouth raised
$189,068.
"Dartmouth had an amazing
response," Gobaud said. "I think
Dartmouth, as far as going beyond
fundraising ... did a lot more. And
we want to do more like what they
did."
Leaders at Dartmouth organ
ized immediately. Cass pulled an
all-nighter with fellow Dartmouth
students Alex Schindler and
Frances Vernon to form commit
tees on outreach, communication
and collecting supplies.
"The way to mobilize these 300-
plus people was to break up into
the committees who had already
had a working to-do list of what
needed to be accomplished, so peo
ple could walk away with a specific
set of instructions," said Vernon,
who is also Dartmouth's student
body president.
"It was very grassroots to get
people together," Vernon added.
The other top contributors were
University of Colorado at Boulder
with $10,125, Brown University
with $8,530, and Caltech with
$8,391.
Stanford fundraising was largely
done through outreach to dorm
presidents, collaboration with
Frosh Council and door-to-door
visits by leaders of different cam
pus groups. Stern dining ambassa
dors organized an event called "Heal
Haiti," which raised more than
$3,000. The Graduate School of
Business donated more than $2,000
to Haiti from their weekly social
events.

Medical schools around the coun
try also fundraised to help Haiti.
Teams from the medical schools and

affiliated hospitals at Columbia,
Cornell, Dartmouth, George
Washington, Harvard and Yale trav
eled to Haiti to provide medical serv
ices to the injured. Eight Stanford
physicians and nurses also traveled
to Haiti, carrying with them $lB,OOO
worth of medical supplies.
Michele Barry, senior associate
dean of global health in the School of
Medicine, said that students, staff,
faculty and community members
raised over $182,000 in total.
Stanford University, its medical
school and hospital pledged $167,000

in matching funds. The money will be
donated to Hopital Albert
Schweitzer, one of the few hospitals
still standing in Haiti, Barry said.
"This is going to be a long process
of rehabilitation," Barry said. "This
particular hospital, which has been
there for 50 years, will need more
support, and I'm going to try to
develop a program to support them
in manpower as well as send physi
cians."
