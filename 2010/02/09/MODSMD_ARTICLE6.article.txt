## Florence, the Italian job BOSP contemplates new ways to attract students to its Florence program 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR 
The composer Virgil Thomson once wrote, "In
Paris you learn wit, in London you learn to crush your
social rivals, and in Florence you learn poise."
The Florence Bing Overseas Program is putting its
grace to work navigating a shifting position within the
ranks of Stanford's overseas offerings and staff, stu
dents and administrators are increasingly defining the
program by its uniqueness, rather than its prominence.
Enrollment rates for the Florence Bing Overseas

Studies Program have consistently lagged behind
those of the other locations in recent years, according
to overseas program director and history professor
Norman Naimark '66 Ph.D. '72.
Twenty-six students submitted first-round applica
tions to Florence for autumn 2010, and second round
applications are still to come. The program's capacity is
40 students.
Naimark wrote in an e-mail to The Daily that "it's
only been over the last few years that the Florence
enrollments have gone down in comparison to the
most popular programs in Oxford, Berlin and Paris, for
example."
Linda Campani, on-site director of the Florence
program, said the program has
attracted 25 to 35 students per quar
ter since she joined the program in
1993.

"Our current numbers are more
or less in line with the usual numbers
and their fluctuations," Campani
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"What has drastically changed
since the early nineties is that back
then we had at least two thirds of
each group of students spending two
quarters in Florence," Campani
added. "Now we have around one
third or less of students who decide

to stay for two quarters."
The program's year-long Italian
language requirement may pose an
obstacle for some students, Campani
conjectured.
"This requires quite a commit
ment, and students, especially of cer
tain majors, tell us they find it diffi
cult to ... factor three quarters of a
language they have never studied
into an already busy curriculum,"
Campani said.
There has been discussion of
dropping or lessening the language
requirement. The Beijing program,
for example, last week dropped its
year-long Chinese requirement for
fall quarter 2010. The change aims to
attract non-Chinese speaking stu
dents — and to determine if these
students can succeed academically.

Staff and students affiliated with
Florence, however, emphasized that
some prior knowledge of Italian
greatly enhances students' time in
the city.
"The Florence program values
the ability of students to speak to
their host families, to go to a restau
rant and be able to order in Italian,"
said Ana Maria Sanchez 'lO, one of
the student advisors for Florence.
"Italy is filled with American stu
dents who can't speak Italian."
Kip Hustace 'll agreed that
Florentines appreciate students'
efforts to speak Italian. He said
prospective applicants should not be
discouraged if their language skills
are lacking.
"Florentines view Italian lan
guage and culture very highly, as
they should," Hustace said. "I do
think, however, that advertising for
the program should suggest that it's
not a life-or-death thing if you don't
feel confident speaking in Italian to
someone else,"
Naimark added that the language
requirement related to a number of
other challenges for the program in
maintaining enrollment.
"Part of the story is the establish
ment of a center in Madrid, which
attracts some of those students who

might have otherwise used their
Spanish background to study Italian
and then go to Florence," Naimark
said. "Part of the story may be the
lack of appreciation among some
students of just how important
Florence and Italy are to central
questions about the past, present
and future. There is so much to learn
there and not just about the
Renaissance."
Program staff are investigating
several ways to make Florence more
appealing. Proposed changes includ
ed the addition of more classes that
fulfill general education and major
requirements, as well as the expan
sion of Florence's internship pro
gram.
At the moment, students are usu
ally only eligible for internships if
they remain in Florence for two
quarters. The program may make
summer internships more readily
available.
Sanchez's fellow student advisor,
Joe Oehmke 'lO, said that of the
group preparing to go to Florence in
the spring, almost a third have
inquired about remaining in the
summer to do an internship.
"More funding is definitely wel
come, and we're investigating this
opportunity," Oehmke said.

Oehmke and Sanchez have tried
to spread the word about the
Florence program, visiting Italian
classes and distributing flyers in e
mail and print. Staff also set up
Skype sessions once a quarter at
Casa Italiana, where interested stu
dents can speak with faculty in
Florence.

Campani was also quick to point
out that there are some advantages
to being a so-called "boutique," or
niche, program.
"The program prides itself on
offering students unique and indi
vidualized academic experiences
that would not be possible if our
groups were too large," Campani
said. "After all, how could they walk
in between the outer and inner shell
of Brunelleschi's cupola in one of
their on-site classes if they came in

hordes?" Oehmke reiterat
ed that when it comes to students
who enroll, the Florence program
emphasizes quality, not quantity.
"Florence has a niche group of
people who want to go and are will
ing to do what it takes to get there,"
he said. "Numbers don't tell the
whole story."

Renaissance."
Program staff are investigating
several ways to make Florence more
appealing. Proposed changes includ
ed the addition of more classes that
fulfill general education and major
requirements, as well as the expan
sion of Florence's internship pro
gram.
At the moment, students are usu
ally only eligible for internships if
they remain in Florence for two
quarters. The program may make
summer internships more readily
available.
Sanchez's fellow student advisor,
Joe Oehmke 'lO, said that of the
group preparing to go to Florence in
the spring, almost a third have
inquired about remaining in the
summer to do an internship.
"More funding is definitely wel
come, and we're investigating this
opportunity," Oehmke said.

Oehmke and Sanchez have tried
to spread the word about the
Florence program, visiting Italian
classes and distributing flyers in e
mail and print. Staff also set up
Skype sessions once a quarter at
Casa Italiana, where interested stu
dents can speak with faculty in
Florence.

Campani was also quick to point
out that there are some advantages
to being a so-called "boutique," or
niche, program.
"The program prides itself on
offering students unique and indi
vidualized academic experiences
that would not be possible if our
groups were too large," Campani
said. "After all, how could they walk
in between the outer and inner shell
of Brunelleschi's cupola in one of
their on-site classes if they came in

hordes?" Oehmke reiterat
ed that when it comes to students
who enroll, the Florence program
emphasizes quality, not quantity.
"Florence has a niche group of
people who want to go and are will
ing to do what it takes to get there,"
he said. "Numbers don't tell the
whole story."
