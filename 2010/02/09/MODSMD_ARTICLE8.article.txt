## HAPPILY EVER AFTER Married profs, sound off on dual-career academic hiring 
### STEPHANIE LIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Whether they have
shared last names,
work in similar
fields or have com
pletely separate
academic identities, married profes
sors are not uncommon at Stanford
and add a certain "nerdy-romantic"
dynamic to the Farm.
Sociology Prof. Andrew Walder
and his wife, political science Prof.
Jean Oi, were jointly recruited to
Stanford and have collaborated on
publications and other academic
endeavors.

"We definitely wanted to work at
the same school, not only for con
venience, but because we share sim
ilar interests and it's nice to already
have a colleague you like to work
with," Walder said. "Harvard, where
we worked before, was definitely
more discouraging [of having mar
ried faculty]."
Current freshmen may be well
acquainted with another academic
power couple, Michele Elam,
English professor, and Harry Elam,
Jr., drama professor. Aside from
moderating the Three Books talk at
the beginning of the year, the Elams
taught the "Beyond Survival"
Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) class together this fall
quarter.
"We share similar tastes, interests
and commitments and are close
intellectual companions," said
Michele Elam. "We submitted a pro
posal together to teach an IHUM
because we are both interested in
diversity, art and politics. Students
quickly realized that we were mar
ried, and I guess this led to some
entertainment value during class
when we would appear to disagree."

The Elams also collaborate on
research and are currently writing a
book together. They said they are
not fazed by the overlap between
their professional and personal lives.
"No I absolutely love working
with my wife!" exclaimed Harry
Elam. "We are excited by each oth
ers' work, intellectual curiosity and
love of teaching."
Working closely together has
only enhanced their relationship, the
Elams revealed. They share an office
at home and enjoy "talking about
Stanford all the time." And while
occasional confusion occurs when
students contact the wrong Dr.
Elam, they say they are incredibly
happy with their situation.
Christine Wotipka, education
professor, shared similar sentiments
about work with her husband.

"We're both workaholics," Dr.
Wotipka admitted. "With such busy
lives and two young kids, any chance
to be together is appreciated. Even
if it's a meeting, work becomes time
together."
However, she and husband
Anthony Antonio, education profes
sor, also work in the same depart
ment, which has the potential to
complicate matters.
"I feel like having an academic
couple work in the same department
would be less beneficial due to issues

with voting," Walder said. Michele
Elam agreed, pointing out the
increased opportunities for conflicts
of interest as well as the constant
perhaps excessive contact.
"Because we still work with dif
ferent programs, there are no con
flicts of interest," Wotipka said.
"Plus, I benefit from having a nur
turing, 'in-house' mentor, which can
be difficult for many junior faculty
to find."

The University also stresses the
attention it pays to Dual-Career
Academic Hiring.
"[lt's] a very serious topic," noted
Londa Schiebinger, history profes-

sor and director of the Clayman
Institute for Gender Research. In
addition to being the wife of Dr.
Robert Proctor, a fellow history pro
fessor, Dr. Schiebinger published a
detailed research paper and policy
guide regarding dual-career aca
demic couples in 2008.
According to her research, over a
third of academic professionals are
married to another academic profes
sional, and finding suitable employ
ment for a spouse is considered a
very high priority by most. Over the
past decade, the joint hiring of aca
demic couples has increased signifi
cantly, and many universities have
started to realize the potential value
in having a couple work together to
recruit and retain top talent.
The Elams and Walder agreed
that they would have had no qualms
about choosing a less prestigious
institution if Stanford had not hired
their respective spouses. Their opin
ions reflect Dr. Schiebinger's
research, which found that 88 per
cent of dual-career faculty nation
wide would have refused their cur
rent position if their spouse had not
also been hired.

"Even if it's a
meeting,
work
becomes
time
together."
