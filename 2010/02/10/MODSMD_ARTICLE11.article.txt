## EDITORIAL High-speed rail will bring sustainable future 
### 
Last week, the Editorial Board voiced
our support for timely construction of a
high-speed rail line through California
in accordance with the proposition that vot
ers approved in 2008. Recently, the federal
government provided a boost to California's
plan by announcing $2.5 billion in support of
this plan. Despite the substantial institution
al support for this project, there are several
community organizations throughout Cali
fornia that have expressed their reservations
about going through with this plan. Those in
opposition claim that high-speed rail author
ity has overestimated the projected ridership
on these rails, and are increasingly skeptical
of the proposed project's profitability.
The Editorial Board also has concerns
about what this project will hold for the
short-term financial stability of California,
but we reiterate that the object of this rail is
not profitability but rather creating an effi
cient and sustainable mode of transportation
for California. One of the greatest challenges
facing the United States today is its heavy de
pendence on oil, especially foreign oil. This is
a problem that has deep a environmental as
well as economic impact on us all, and this
project is a unique opportunity to decrease
this dependence.
Comparing the energy required by each

mode to carry a passenger one mile, a Cali
fornia high-speed train needs only about
one-third of the energy required by an air
plane and roughly one-fifth of the energy re
quired by a commuter automobile trip. Prop
er implementation of this rail project can re
duce the vehicle miles traveled in the state by
2.3 percent and reduce approximately 12 bil
lion pounds of CO2 emissions, according to
the High-Speed Rail Authority of California.
This will mean long-term sustainable ad
vancement for California, which will be
merely a byproduct of a more convenient
mode of transportation.
In order to construct this rail, the greatest
challenge facing the state is building new rail
ing that is fitted for a train running on electric
power, and not the gasoline diesel trains that
currently operate throughout California.
There are many different ways to provide
power to this project, and the state can utilize
solar and wind power to operate these trains.
Investing in these alternate power sources is an
investment in our state's future as well as the
future of this planet. We remain confident that
the citizens of California are among the most
progressive people in the world. We are confi
dent that the people of California will take this
opportunity to join the rest of the world in rev
olutionizing their transportation model.
