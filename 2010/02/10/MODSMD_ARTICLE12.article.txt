## Stanford University Exposed 
### Ann Tyler Moses 
It's time to face the bare truth of the mat
ter: the undergraduate sector of Stanford
University has a bit of an obsession with
nudity. And though that is somewhat to be
expected in a collection of suddenly free and
slightly befuddled 18 to 22 year olds, our case
seems to be exceptional. Save convocation,
none of our cherished traditions can truly
commence until someone takes their clothes
off.

There is Gaieties. There is essentially
every event involving the band. There is Se
cret Snowflake, which for some Freudian rea
son is one of the most dearly loved events of
freshman year. This year, there was the slight
ly altered Full Moon on the Quad, during
which the threat of swine flu was combated
with getting naked apparently a panacea.
Then comes exam week, and does the best
way to calm the nerves of anxious, library
bound classmates even need to be ques
tioned? Simply treat them to a view of your
self in the buff, and all their worries will fade,
Duh.

So what's the reason for all this exhibi
tionism? It stands in stark contrast to many
other institutions of higher learning. Our stu
dent body seems so buttoned-up and practi
cal until the buttons are undone, and our
true wild nature is exposed. We go to class, we
do our "econ p-sets," we chat with our par
ents, we engage in some sort of intimidating
ly global social activism, and then, well,
what's left but to shed our sartorial trappings
and run around like a mischievous three
year-old who doesn't want to take a bath?
One could argue, I suppose, that clothes
are quite a bit environmentally unfriendly. So
if we're composting like mad and buying or
ganic and killing ourselves on our earth sys-

terns homework, why should we sabotage
our efforts by sporting cloth made by op
pressed children and pollution-belching ma
chines? That isn't the spirit of Stanford.
Or maybe our biology classes cannot con
tain our appreciation for the majesty of the
human body. After long nights spent studying
anatomy, who can blame us for wanting to
bring our learning to life? After all, we want
to be the best doctors possible. So any extra
exposure to the human physique must be
helpful. Basically, school-wide events are a
continuation of lab class.
Perhaps the prevalence of nudity intends
to bolster our faith in progress and liberal
ism. So your school helped campaign to put
the first black president in office, so what?
We're way past that. Seventeen percent of
freshmen are first-generation college stu
dents, AND we run around naked at school
sanctioned functions! Beat that!
And there's our intense pride in being
"quirky." Stanford is a place where fun exists
alongside academic rigor, and where any stu
dent goal, no matter how ambitious or off
beat, can be realized. You can build and pro
gram a smarter computer. You can start a
nonprofit in Djibouti. You can strut around
in nothing but your skin, and it's totally cool.
You can have it all.
Of course, we could just be immature
teenagers, excited to uncouth proportions by
our new-found freedom and the opportunity
to indulge our proud wackiness at none other
than Stanford University.
Nope. It's definitely more profound than
that.
