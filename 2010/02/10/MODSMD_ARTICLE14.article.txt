# STRANGELY CHARMING
## Raging Hadrons 
### Jack Cackler 
Last week's column searched far off into
the cosmos for signs of life. This week's
column will instead search deep within
the world all around us, to the tiny subatom
ic particles that make up every aspect of our
lives. In particular, the column will look into
the quest for the Higgs Boson, the mythical
"God particle" whose existence could help
address the nature of the universe once and
for all, that eluded Einstein to his dying day.
The Higgs Boson (if it exists) would explain
how things with mass (just about everything)
work. Needless to say, it's a pretty high prior
ity to find, and it's basically understood that
whoever finds it gets a free Nobel Prize. Con
sidering you may have several trillion in you
right now, I suggest you start looking.
For a brief overview on particle physics,
the Standard Model is the current front run
ner in the race to describe the universe. The
Standard Model predicts a host of fun parti
cles and forces that theoretically make up
everything in the universe. Quarks, three of
which are in every proton and neutron in the
universe, are a crucial component of the
model. Murray Gell-Mann derived the name
from a single line in T. S. Eliot's Finnegan's
Wake, basically because the name sounded
cool. Quarks were first experimentally veri
fied in 1968 right here at SLAC (formerly the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center)! The
first two identified quarks were classified as
"up" and "down" to indicate that they op
posed each other. Having nothing left to op
pose "up" and "down," Gell-Mann dubbed
the third quark he found "strange," and the
name stuck. "Charmed" (strange's pair),
"top," and "bottom" round out the final three
quarks of the Standard model.
While quarks (along with leptons) make
up the matter in the universe, bosons mediate
force between quarks and leptons.The major
identified bosons to date are photons, the
weak nuclear force, Z bosons and gluons
(which hold quarks together). Finding the
Higgs Boson would complete the set, which
particle physicists would be able to place on
their shelves next to their action figures and
trading cards.
So how do you find a Higgs Boson? Parti
cle accelerators are generally either long
straight or circular tubes in which particles
are sped up faster and faster until they collide
with a target. The collision, the particle
physics equivalent of a pi?ata bursting, can

emit several subatomic particles. Building
bigger and more energetic accelerators is
like hiring the big kid down the street to
whack the pi?ata so hard that even the can
dies wedged deep in a corner fly out.
The recently opened Large Hadron Col
lider (LHC), is the world's most energetic ac
celerator. Located deep underground near
Geneva, Switzerland, the LHC is about 5
miles in diameter, and was first tested in late
2008. Its very existence has caused some con

troversy, causing conspiracy theorists to
protest its opening, claiming it would create
black holes that would swallow the Earth
(though it could create tiny black holes, they
are too small to do any damage. Really.), and
was even featured in a Dan Brown book.
While the LHC was plagued by malfunctions
for months, all problems have been fixed, and
the LHC officially became the most ener
getic accelerator last November. Just last
Wednesday, LHC officials formally an
nounced a plan over the next two years to ac
celerate collisions up to 14 TeV (for refer
ence, about 70,000 times the energy released
during nuclear fission of a Uranium atom).
While the LHC also does important research
looking for antimatter, dark matter and a
whole host of other physical mysteries, the
search for the Higgs Boson is a central func
tion of the LHC.

In addition to aiding the search for
stealthy subatomic particles, particle acceler
ator technology has given boundless gifts to
the world. Technology developed for particle
accelerators is often used in cancer therapy
to specifically target malignant tumors. Com
puter chips are made of semiconductors that
are doped with ions, a process performed by
accelerators. There are hundreds more ex
amples of successful spin-offs from particle
physical technology that effect practical and
powerful change in our everyday lives. It is
extraordinary to see technology developed
to answer curious questions about the uni
verse being put to work to save and improve
lives all around the world.

Having said that, I think there is a lot to be
said for the quest for knowledge for its own
purpose. One of the greatest things about sci
ence is that it seems that the more we learn,
the more we realize we don't know. Figuring
out the answers to the riddles of the universe
is incredibly rewarding, and propels us into
the future. Regardless of what you study, a
healthy mixture of curiosity and hard work
will hopefully light up some of those myster
ies for you and for the world, and maybe, just
maybe, one day you'll get the chance to
smash your own research together at the
speed of awesome.

Jack is still offering free cookies to anyone who
finds a mistake, or free Nobel prizes to anyone
who finds a Higgs Boson in his column. Con
