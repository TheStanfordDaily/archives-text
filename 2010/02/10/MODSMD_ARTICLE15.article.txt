## VAULTING ABOVE THE REST 
### ANARGHYA VADHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This past weekend, a small contingent of Stanford
track and field athletes traveled to Albuquerque, N.M.
to compete in the New Mexico Classic, Although the
main focus of the meet was to offer some experience to
multi-event competitors, Stanford was led by a pole
vaulter, sophomore Katerina Stefanidi.
A native of Greece, Stefanidi has solidified herself as
one of the top pole vaulters in the nation early on. In
New Mexico, Stefanidi improved upon her own school
record and NCAA automatic qualifying standard
tying for the meet title with a vault of 14-0. Additional
ly, she cemented herself among the Stanford greats, be
coming the first Cardinal female to vault 14 feet.
In the national rankings, Stefanidi is currently tied
for seventh. The highest vault this year is a mark of 14-
feet-4.5-inches, meaning that Stefanidi will have to
vault more than 4.5 inches to take over that spot a
highly doable challenge for the burgeoning athlete.
Another Stanford athlete that has been making his
mark in the field events is freshman high jumper Jules
Sharpe. As of Jan. 23, Sharpe is ranked 19th in the na
tion, a position that could quickly be improved upon.
Sharpe's best height so far this season has been seven
foot-one, while the No. 1 position is occupied by a three
way tie between athletes from Washington State, Indi
ana and Mississippi, all of whom jumped 7-foot-4.25.
"I'm glad to be heading in the right direction with
my jumps so far, and I'm anxious to jump higher,"
Sharpe said. "My coach is training me well, and my goal
for the end of the indoor season is just to jump higher,
and hopefully win an NCAA title."
In terms of his quick transition from high school to
college, Sharpe asserted that there is more competition
and more pressure, but at the same time, more fun. He's
also been helped out by the squad's veterans.
"I look up to our senior captain, Durrell Coleman,
the most," he added.
With Sharpe comes one of Stanford's first chances to
compete in high jump on a national level in many years.
His young talent also promises the Cardinal a bright fu
ture in the event.
Another budding freshman with great potential is
Karynn Dunn, a native of Diamond Bar, Calif. While
Dunn was initially recruited to compete in the long and
triple jump, as well as the short hurdles, she is now look
ing to be a multi-events athlete,
"For MPSF, I plan to do the pentathlon," she said,
"because I feel that I have a better chance of making it
to NCAAs in that event."
The pentathlon includes the long jump, shot put,
high jump, 800 meter run and 60 meter hurdles. Dunn
feels that she can succeed in this event, as she has two
specialties, the long jump and the 60 meter hurdles. In
many cases, pentathletes are relatively good at all the
events, but Dunn feels that her advantage will be that
she is very good at two of the events.
The transition from high school to college track and
field has indeed been challenge to
Dunn as well.

"College track is different from

high school track because in high
school you already know everyone
so you're not intimidated, but in col
lege you have no idea what that per
son can do," she said.
Yet she is grateful for the leader
ship and role models on the team. In
particular, Dunn looks up to junior
Arantxa King, because of her athlet-

ic prowess, as well as her great
sportsmanship on and off the field.
Next up for the Cardinal is a pair
of meets, the Tyson Invitational in
Arkansas and the Husky Classic in
Seattle.
