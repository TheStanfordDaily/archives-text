# ICING ON THE FARM
## 
### KATHRYN ROETHEL 
It's 10 minutes to midnight at Red
wood City's Nazareth Ice Oasis, a
skating rink where halogen lights
hang from an aluminum roof and
two rows of concrete serve as
bleachers and encircle only half the ice.
Two Monday Night Adult Hockey
League teams in mismatched jerseys
Blue Martini and Danger have just
completed their consolation bracket
game. Now, it's time for the Stanford Uni
versity club hockey team to take the ice
for practice.

Seventeen players, ranging in age
from 18 to 23, file through the scuffed,
blue locker room door. They're not here
because they were recruited or because
they're on scholarship to play hockey for
Stanford. In fact, they have to pay 350
dollars in dues to keep their spots on the
team.

Nor are they here for fame and glory.
The club team isn't officially part of Stan
ford Athletics. They rarely get media at
tention, and frequently play home games
in front of only a dozen fans.
Their coaches are volunteers. They
schedule their own games, and practice
whenever they can get ice time at the
closest public ice rink; this season, it's
from midnight to 1:30 a.m. on Mondays
and Wednesdays. They pack up their own
hockey gear and pile into their own vehi
cles to drive themselves to most road

games sometimes as far as Los Ange
les, six hours away.
And they absolutely love what they

"I play because I've grown up with
hockey, and this is a really great group of
guys," said 23-year-old Pitch Lindsay, a
left wing and senior studying internation
al relations. "This is one of the few com
mitments I've done consistently in my
time here at Stanford. People wouldn't
be out here at 12 a.m. if they didn't really
want to play."
"It's hockey," added 18-year-old Sam
Bowers, the team's starting goalie, and a
freshman studying human biology. "It's
the sport I love."
It's the sport all of them love.The team
roster includes several graduate students,
a freshman, two Canadians, one Swede
and even a female player 23-year-old
graduate medical student and forward
Stephanie Brenman. She played
women's NCAA hockey in her under
graduate years at the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology before joining Stan
ford's club team.
"It's the first time I've played with
boys since elementary school," Brenman
said. "And I've never played full-contact
hockey before,"
"The biggest challenge is the lack of
resources [for a club team]," she added.
"We don't have a trainer, you're on your
own with injuries, and we don't get good
practice times. But we have fun."
They also have a small but mighty
group of diehard fans. Kevin Crabb and
Ben Almquist, former and current gradu

ate students in materials science, respec
tively, come to as many home hockey
games as they can. Dressed in Cardinal
red, they've been cheering the team on
for three years, and always sit against the
glass.
"Hockey is the greatest sport there is,"
Crabb said. "Three years ago, when we
started coming, there were only three of
us [in the stands]."
"But it's fun because you get to be so
close to the action," Almquist added.
"And when you heckle the other team,
they hear you!"
Jim Young, director of media relations
for Stanford Athletics, said that the Uni
versity has never seriously considered
having an official university hockey team
due to "the lack of other universities in
the west playing hockey at a NCAA level
and adequate facilities."
Besides Alaska, there aren't any
NCAA Division-I schools west of Col
orado that have university hockey teams.
Stanford's club team is part of the Pac-8
conference of the American Collegiate
Hockey Association.
As a Stanford club, the team receives
$B,OOO in University funding, or about 35
percent of its annual expenses, according
to the team president, 20-year-old psy
chology major and right wing Matt Wong.
Most of Stanford's team members
have played hockey nearly all their lives,
but none of them were discouraged from
attending Stanford when they learned it
only had a club team.

The Stanford hockey team is not an official varsity sport, nor does it get much recognition on campus, but that doesn't stop its 17
players from continuing to play the game that they love. The team just ended its home season with a thrilling 5-3 win over Cal.
"NCAA hockey plays at a pretty
high level," said James Dudley, a 21-
year-old senior defenseman study
ing mechanical engineering and ar
chaeology. "I don't think any of us
were good enough for that... Stan
ford club hockey takes anybody."
"I always knew I'd be coming to
school for school," Bowers added.
"[Hockey] is what I do for fun."
Fun is definitely something the
team has.

Their self-maintained Web site,
which hasn't been updated since
September 2009, lists the team roster
with several player nicknames.
There's captain defenseman Jack
"Daniels" Jorgensen and forward
Chris "Sean Avery" Grieco, in refer
ence to the penalty-prone NHL
player. In the locker room, team
mates also coined a nickname for
their team president: "If it ain't right,
it's gotta be Wong."
While scraping ice from their
skates and flinging it at one another,
the teammates recounted a story
about one of their road games in
Washington.
"We ate at Shari's Family Restau
rant seven times in three days," Dud
ley said. "They had 99-cent, all-you
can-eat pancakes. They knew our
names by the end of the third day."
Jokes aside, the team cama
raderie is clear. Taku Ide, one of the
team's coaches and a graduate stu
dent in energy resources engineer
ing, has been with the team for nine
years. He started playing as a fresh
man in 2000 and played for six years
until he exhausted his eligibility as a
player. He didn't want to leave the
team, so he has coached the last
three years.
"A lot of these guys are my friends
as well," Ide said. "You get to be real
close. We watch out for each other."
Head coach Howard Neckowitz
has coached the team for five years.
He played four years of college hock
ey at the University of Connecticut
and now volunteers his time to coach
Stanford.

"I've played hockey my whole
life, and I love being on the ice as
much as possible," Neckowitz said.
"These guys get the opportunity to
participate in the sport that they love,
and also make some friendships on

the team. It's great seeing these guys
build up academically and physically
over the years."
Most of Neckowitz's players
quickly recall fun memories with the
team, and all will eagerly rattle off
stats and highlights from one or
more victories against Cal. But the
one thing no player or coach admit
ted to remembering was this year's
record.

"If we win our last two games, it
might be about .500," Dudley said.
In actuality, it's 4-10.
"It's one of those years you try not
to remember the record too much,
and focus on the future," Ide admit
ted.

Although Stanford did not make
the Pac-8 playoffs this year, it had a
lot to play for in its last home game
on Feb. 5. The opponent: Cal. The
Cardinal and the Bears split the pre
vious meetings this season, 1-1.
Thanks to the team's grassroots
Facebook campaign to get fans to the
game, more than 75 supporters came
to cheer on the Cardinal Stan
ford's highest home attendance of
the year. Crabb and Almquist were in
their usual seats against the glass, this
time waving a teddy bear with a
noose around its neck.

"It's our last home game of the
season, and we've got a lot of fans out
there, so let's show 'em a good game,"
Jorgensen told his teammates in a
pre-game pep talk.
And a good game it was. It had
scoring a total of eight goals be
tween the two teams.
It had tension Cal tied the
game 3-3 at the beginning of the third
period.

It had drama a brutal check at
the end of the second period sent 23-
year-old forward and five-year team
veteran Max Guise to the hospital
with signs of a concussion.
It had a good, ol' fashioned hock
ey fight a scrum broke out to the
left of the Cal goaltender with 38 sec
onds to play, sending six players to
the penalty boxes and earning ejec
tions and one-game suspensions for
Cal's goalie, Matt Bloomfield, and
Stanford's Grieco.

And, it had a Stanford victory
the Cardinal finished off the Bears 5-
3. In its final home game of the 2009-
2010 season, Stanford's club hockey
team earned a standing ovation ...
from a packed house.

"And when you heckle the other team,
they hear you!"
Jim Young, director of media relations
for Stanford Athletics, said that the Uni
versity has never seriously considered
having an official university hockey team
due to "the lack of other universities in
the west playing hockey at a NCAA level
and adequate facilities."
Besides Alaska, there aren't any
NCAA Division-I schools west of Col
orado that have university hockey teams.
Stanford's club team is part of the Pac-8
conference of the American Collegiate
Hockey Association.
As a Stanford club, the team receives
$B,OOO in University funding, or about 35
percent of its annual expenses, according
to the team president, 20-year-old psy
chology major and right wing Matt Wong.
Most of Stanford's team members
have played hockey nearly all their lives,
but none of them were discouraged from
attending Stanford when they learned it
only had a club team.

The Stanford hockey team is not an official varsity sport, nor does it get much recognition on campus, but that doesn't stop its 17
players from continuing to play the game that they love. The team just ended its home season with a thrilling 5-3 win over Cal.
"NCAA hockey plays at a pretty
high level," said James Dudley, a 21-
year-old senior defenseman study
ing mechanical engineering and ar
chaeology. "I don't think any of us
were good enough for that... Stan
ford club hockey takes anybody."
"I always knew I'd be coming to
school for school," Bowers added.
"[Hockey] is what I do for fun."
Fun is definitely something the
team has.

Their self-maintained Web site,
which hasn't been updated since
September 2009, lists the team roster
with several player nicknames.
There's captain defenseman Jack
"Daniels" Jorgensen and forward
Chris "Sean Avery" Grieco, in refer
ence to the penalty-prone NHL
player. In the locker room, team
mates also coined a nickname for
their team president: "If it ain't right,
it's gotta be Wong."
While scraping ice from their
skates and flinging it at one another,
the teammates recounted a story
about one of their road games in
Washington.
"We ate at Shari's Family Restau
rant seven times in three days," Dud
ley said. "They had 99-cent, all-you
can-eat pancakes. They knew our
names by the end of the third day."
Jokes aside, the team cama
raderie is clear. Taku Ide, one of the
team's coaches and a graduate stu
dent in energy resources engineer
ing, has been with the team for nine
years. He started playing as a fresh
man in 2000 and played for six years
until he exhausted his eligibility as a
player. He didn't want to leave the
team, so he has coached the last
three years.
"A lot of these guys are my friends
as well," Ide said. "You get to be real
close. We watch out for each other."
Head coach Howard Neckowitz
has coached the team for five years.
He played four years of college hock
ey at the University of Connecticut
and now volunteers his time to coach
Stanford.

"I've played hockey my whole
life, and I love being on the ice as
much as possible," Neckowitz said.
"These guys get the opportunity to
participate in the sport that they love,
and also make some friendships on

the team. It's great seeing these guys
build up academically and physically
over the years."
Most of Neckowitz's players
quickly recall fun memories with the
team, and all will eagerly rattle off
stats and highlights from one or
more victories against Cal. But the
one thing no player or coach admit
ted to remembering was this year's
record.

"If we win our last two games, it
might be about .500," Dudley said.
In actuality, it's 4-10.
"It's one of those years you try not
to remember the record too much,
and focus on the future," Ide admit
ted.

Although Stanford did not make
the Pac-8 playoffs this year, it had a
lot to play for in its last home game
on Feb. 5. The opponent: Cal. The
Cardinal and the Bears split the pre
vious meetings this season, 1-1.
Thanks to the team's grassroots
Facebook campaign to get fans to the
game, more than 75 supporters came
to cheer on the Cardinal Stan
ford's highest home attendance of
the year. Crabb and Almquist were in
their usual seats against the glass, this
time waving a teddy bear with a
noose around its neck.

"It's our last home game of the
season, and we've got a lot of fans out
there, so let's show 'em a good game,"
Jorgensen told his teammates in a
pre-game pep talk.
And a good game it was. It had
scoring a total of eight goals be
tween the two teams.
It had tension Cal tied the
game 3-3 at the beginning of the third
period.

It had drama a brutal check at
the end of the second period sent 23-
year-old forward and five-year team
veteran Max Guise to the hospital
with signs of a concussion.
It had a good, ol' fashioned hock
ey fight a scrum broke out to the
left of the Cal goaltender with 38 sec
onds to play, sending six players to
the penalty boxes and earning ejec
tions and one-game suspensions for
Cal's goalie, Matt Bloomfield, and
Stanford's Grieco.

And, it had a Stanford victory
the Cardinal finished off the Bears 5-
3. In its final home game of the 2009-
2010 season, Stanford's club hockey
team earned a standing ovation ...
from a packed house.

It's 10 minutes to midnight at Red
wood City's Nazareth Ice Oasis, a
skating rink where halogen lights
hang from an aluminum roof and
two rows of concrete serve as
bleachers and encircle only half the ice.
Two Monday Night Adult Hockey
League teams in mismatched jerseys
Blue Martini and Danger have just
completed their consolation bracket
game. Now, it's time for the Stanford Uni
versity club hockey team to take the ice
for practice.

Seventeen players, ranging in age
from 18 to 23, file through the scuffed,
blue locker room door. They're not here
because they were recruited or because
they're on scholarship to play hockey for
Stanford. In fact, they have to pay 350
dollars in dues to keep their spots on the
team.

Nor are they here for fame and glory.
The club team isn't officially part of Stan
ford Athletics. They rarely get media at
tention, and frequently play home games
in front of only a dozen fans.
Their coaches are volunteers. They
schedule their own games, and practice
whenever they can get ice time at the
closest public ice rink; this season, it's
from midnight to 1:30 a.m. on Mondays
and Wednesdays. They pack up their own
hockey gear and pile into their own vehi
cles to drive themselves to most road

games sometimes as far as Los Ange
les, six hours away.
And they absolutely love what they

"I play because I've grown up with
hockey, and this is a really great group of
guys," said 23-year-old Pitch Lindsay, a
left wing and senior studying internation
al relations. "This is one of the few com
mitments I've done consistently in my
time here at Stanford. People wouldn't
be out here at 12 a.m. if they didn't really
want to play."
"It's hockey," added 18-year-old Sam
Bowers, the team's starting goalie, and a
freshman studying human biology. "It's
the sport I love."
It's the sport all of them love.The team
roster includes several graduate students,
a freshman, two Canadians, one Swede
and even a female player 23-year-old
graduate medical student and forward
Stephanie Brenman. She played
women's NCAA hockey in her under
graduate years at the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology before joining Stan
ford's club team.
"It's the first time I've played with
boys since elementary school," Brenman
said. "And I've never played full-contact
hockey before,"
"The biggest challenge is the lack of
resources [for a club team]," she added.
"We don't have a trainer, you're on your
own with injuries, and we don't get good
practice times. But we have fun."
They also have a small but mighty
group of diehard fans. Kevin Crabb and
Ben Almquist, former and current gradu

ate students in materials science, respec
tively, come to as many home hockey
games as they can. Dressed in Cardinal
red, they've been cheering the team on
for three years, and always sit against the
glass.
"Hockey is the greatest sport there is,"
Crabb said. "Three years ago, when we
started coming, there were only three of
us [in the stands]."
"But it's fun because you get to be so
close to the action," Almquist added.
"And when you heckle the other team,
they hear you!"
