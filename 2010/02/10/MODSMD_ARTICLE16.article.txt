# ICING ON THE FARM

### KATHRYN ROETHEL 
It's 10 minutes to midnight at Red
wood City's Nazareth Ice Oasis, a
skating rink where halogen lights
hang from an aluminum roof and
two rows of concrete serve as
bleachers and encircle only half the ice.
Two Monday Night Adult Hockey
League teams in mismatched jerseys
Blue Martini and Danger have just
completed their consolation bracket
game. Now, it's time for the Stanford Uni
versity club hockey team to take the ice
for practice.

Seventeen players, ranging in age
from 18 to 23, file through the scuffed,
blue locker room door. They're not here
because they were recruited or because
they're on scholarship to play hockey for
Stanford. In fact, they have to pay 350
dollars in dues to keep their spots on the
team.

Nor are they here for fame and glory.
The club team isn't officially part of Stan
ford Athletics. They rarely get media at
tention, and frequently play home games
in front of only a dozen fans.
Their coaches are volunteers. They
schedule their own games, and practice
whenever they can get ice time at the
closest public ice rink; this season, it's
from midnight to 1:30 a.m. on Mondays
and Wednesdays. They pack up their own
hockey gear and pile into their own vehi
cles to drive themselves to most road

games sometimes as far as Los Ange
les, six hours away.
And they absolutely love what they

"I play because I've grown up with
hockey, and this is a really great group of
guys," said 23-year-old Pitch Lindsay, a
left wing and senior studying internation
al relations. "This is one of the few com
mitments I've done consistently in my
time here at Stanford. People wouldn't
be out here at 12 a.m. if they didn't really
want to play."
"It's hockey," added 18-year-old Sam
Bowers, the team's starting goalie, and a
freshman studying human biology. "It's
the sport I love."
It's the sport all of them love.The team
roster includes several graduate students,
a freshman, two Canadians, one Swede
and even a female player 23-year-old
graduate medical student and forward
Stephanie Brenman. She played
women's NCAA hockey in her under
graduate years at the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology before joining Stan
ford's club team.
"It's the first time I've played with
boys since elementary school," Brenman
said. "And I've never played full-contact
hockey before,"
"The biggest challenge is the lack of
resources [for a club team]," she added.
"We don't have a trainer, you're on your
own with injuries, and we don't get good
practice times. But we have fun."
They also have a small but mighty
group of diehard fans. Kevin Crabb and
Ben Almquist, former and current gradu

ate students in materials science, respec
tively, come to as many home hockey
games as they can. Dressed in Cardinal
red, they've been cheering the team on
for three years, and always sit against the
glass.
"Hockey is the greatest sport there is,"
Crabb said. "Three years ago, when we
started coming, there were only three of
us [in the stands]."
"But it's fun because you get to be so
close to the action," Almquist added.
"And when you heckle the other team,
they hear you!"
Jim Young, director of media relations
for Stanford Athletics, said that the Uni
versity has never seriously considered
having an official university hockey team
due to "the lack of other universities in
the west playing hockey at a NCAA level
and adequate facilities."
Besides Alaska, there aren't any
NCAA Division-I schools west of Col
orado that have university hockey teams.
Stanford's club team is part of the Pac-8
conference of the American Collegiate
Hockey Association.
As a Stanford club, the team receives
$B,OOO in University funding, or about 35
percent of its annual expenses, according
to the team president, 20-year-old psy
chology major and right wing Matt Wong.
Most of Stanford's team members
have played hockey nearly all their lives,
but none of them were discouraged from
attending Stanford when they learned it
only had a club team.

The Stanford hockey team is not an official varsity sport, nor does it get much recognition on campus, but that doesn't stop its 17
players from continuing to play the game that they love. The team just ended its home season with a thrilling 5-3 win over Cal.
