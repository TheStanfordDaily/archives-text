# CARD EARNS COMEBACK WIN
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford wrestling team notched its first Pac
-10 win of the season this past weekend with a close
20-19 victory over UC-Davis at Davis's Hicky Gym
nasium. The meet came down to the final match, but
the Cardinal (9-7-1,1-3-1 Pac-10) was able to pull out
the win over the Aggies (2-10,1-4).
The match started at the 125-pound weight class,
and the Card quickly took the lead. Freshman Ryan
Mango scored a quick pin in one minute 11 seconds,

his fastest of the
season. His
record is now 20-
11, and he is
poised for a deep
run in postsea
son competition.
However,
Stanford was un
able to build on
its early lead, los
ing four straight
matches includ
ing a major deci
sion by Davis's
Trevor Macha
do-Ching over
redshirt fresh
man Mike Kent.
"When [los
ing four straight

matches] happens, you really start worrying," said
head coach Jason Borrelli.

The Cardinal were able to come back beginning
with the 165-pound weight class, where redshirt
sophomore Nick Amuchastegui took a 4-1 decision
over UC-Davis's Joey Wilson. He is currently ranked
first in the conference and owns a record of 25 wins
and four losses, including a 15-1 record in conference
competition.

From there, the Cardinal was able to pick up two
more wins, with senior Jake Johnson and redshirt
junior Zack Giesen picking up wins in the 174- and
184-pound classes, respectively. Giesen continued to
show that he will be a force to be reckoned with in the

upcoming postseason he is currently ranked No.
13 in the nation.
With two weight classes, 197 pounds and heavy
weight, remaining, Stanford held a slim 16-13 lead.
However, due to injury, the Card was forced to forfeit
the heavyweight class, so the Aggies effectively held
six more points and a three-point lead. That meant
that freshman Richard Kessler had to score a major
decision or better against UC-Davis's Shawn
Hoehne at 197 in order to secure the dual for the
Card.
"I wanted to make sure I got a takedown early to
give myself a chance to get a turn in the first period,"
Kessler said. "I knew that was big if I was going to get
the major.
"I knew I was going to be wrestling last, so there's
always a chance that the meet is going to come down
to your match," he continued. "As the meet pro
gressed, I figured that it was going to be my match
that decided the meet."
Kessler's strategy did eventually pay offf and he

secured Stanford's first Pac-10 win with a 9-1 major
decision.
While the Cardinal did win the dual, Borrelli felt
that the results could have been even stronger.
"Individually, we lost a couple of matches that I
was disappointed in," he said. "But I think our upper
weights did a good job of keeping their composure
and just worrying about it match by match."
This weekend, Stanford will play in its final dual
meets before the Pac-10 tournament, as it will take
on Cal State Bakersfield (5-5,1-4) on Friday and then
travel to Arizona State (8-7,3-2) on Sunday.
Of the two meets, the Roadrunners will most like
ly pose a lesser challenge. They currently have four
wrestlers ranked in the top 32 nationally in their
weight class. Over the past four seasons, Stanford has
a 3-1 head-to-head record against Bakersfield, but
the Runners won their most recent meeting last sea
son, 28-13.
