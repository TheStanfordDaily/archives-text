# A 						glimpse into my future?
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
I woke up a few days ago and saw
that I had a new e-mail from my
mom. Not entirely unusual; I
think she mastered the art of elec
tronic communication a few
months ago. Still, pretty rare.

What was unusual was that the e-mail
was a forward from a Google alert she re
ceived on "Michael Lazarus." Somehow,
she figured out how to set up a Google
alert system so she could keep track of
my Daily articles and columns. (For some
reason, she's interested in my sugges
tions on how to improve IM Sports or
how the rain is impacting a men's tennis
match. Powerful stuff. I know).
Pretty impressive, considering this is
the same woman who can't figure how to
use the tabs on her web browser or
that there are web browsers other than
Internet Explorer, for that matter.
The story gets weirder, though. The
alert was from Twitter. Not only do I not
have aTwitter account, I don't believe my
mom knows what the word "tweet"
means. Yet a man named Michael
Lazarus has aTwitter account.
The fact that there is another Michael
Lazarus out there is not surprising. On
the block I grew up on, there was a
Michael Lazarus who lived five houses
away. I'm told he received a few teddy
bears on my birthdaya
But this is where the story gets down
right creepy. The topic the other Michael
Lazarus was tweeting about? Pac-10 bas
ketball a topic I regularly cover in this

column. His most recent tweet: "I'm now
convinced the Pac-10 is finishing in a 10-
way tie at 9-9."
My most recent column: "The Pac-10
has so underperformed (or met expecta
tions, depending on who you ask) that
most likely the only conference team
who will receive a bid to March Madness

will be the winner of the Pac-10 postsea
son tournament."

In other words, the Pac-10 will beat
each other up and only send one team to
the NCAA tournament. Or, in the other
Michael Lazarus' words,"a 10-way tie at
9-9."

So there is another guy out there,
with my name, writing on the same
things I do, coming to the same conclu
sions I make. Only he's doing it on one of
the biggest social network sites in the
world and I'm—well, other than my
mom, I have no idea how many people
actually read my columns.

So who is this guy?
Based on his profile picture, he looks
to be a middle-aged, balding white man.
His Twitter bio says he lives in Los Ange
les and is the Sports Product Manager at
Yahoo! He is a "crazy college basketball
fan and dad-to-be soon."
Seems like a cool dude.

This is where the story comes full cir
cle. I think I may be looking at myself in
20 years, and you know what, I kind of
like what I'm seeing. Good job, a family,
love of sports sign me up. It definitely
beats a lot of other possibilities.
I really don't know what a Sports

Product Manager does, but it can't be
that bad. I like all three of those words.
Plus, doesn't Yahoo! have an all-you
can-eat buffet in its headquarters? I
could get used to that.
Now, I know what you're thinking.
Should I really be basing my life deci
sions off of some guy if the only connec
tion I have to him is reading his Twitter
account for five minutes?
Umm...
I don't have an answer for that. All I
know is other than male-pattern bald
ness and living in L.A., that Michael
Lazarus is a decent aspiration for this
Michael Lazarus. And if you're listening,
Mr. Lazarus, keep on tweeting, and if
you feel like retweeting my column, it
would be much appreciated.

Are you Mike Lazarus' mother? If not,
let him know that you too are reading at
