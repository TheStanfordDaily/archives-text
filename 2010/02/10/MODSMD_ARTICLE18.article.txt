						glimpse into my future?

### Mike Lazarus 
I woke up a few days ago and saw
that I had a new e-mail from my
mom. Not entirely unusual; I
think she mastered the art of elec
tronic communication a few
months ago. Still, pretty rare.

What was unusual was that the e-mail
was a forward from a Google alert she re
ceived on "Michael Lazarus." Somehow,
she figured out how to set up a Google
alert system so she could keep track of
my Daily articles and columns. (For some
reason, she's interested in my sugges
tions on how to improve IM Sports or
how the rain is impacting a men's tennis
match. Powerful stuff. I know).
Pretty impressive, considering this is
the same woman who can't figure how to
use the tabs on her web browser or
that there are web browsers other than
Internet Explorer, for that matter.
The story gets weirder, though. The
alert was from Twitter. Not only do I not
have aTwitter account, I don't believe my
mom knows what the word "tweet"
means. Yet a man named Michael
Lazarus has aTwitter account.
The fact that there is another Michael
Lazarus out there is not surprising. On
the block I grew up on, there was a
Michael Lazarus who lived five houses
away. I'm told he received a few teddy
bears on my birthdaya
But this is where the story gets down
right creepy. The topic the other Michael
Lazarus was tweeting about? Pac-10 bas
