# The
						power of the punter

### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
In my endless search for new ways
to procrastinate, I started watch
ing Spike's oddly addicting but
overly stereotypical football/sex
comedy "Blue Mountain State."
In a recent episode, the main character
gets demoted to special teams, and all
of the normal labels apply the spe
cialists are isolated, deemed not to be
"real" players, and are given hand-me
downs from equipment to girls.
It is a common if not outdated
meme, and the underlying message
isn't particularly subtle: in the football
world, punters and kickers are inconse
quential.
If only it were true.
Despite perception, kickers have re
ceived their due (and scorn) because of
their immediate impact on the score
board. But punters have rarely been ac
knowledged, despite their importance.
A good punter is a tremendous asset in
the field position realm of the game
on a single kick, good punters can ac
count for a disparity of 20 yards, and
over the course of the game, can rou
tinely pin opponents deep within their
own territory. The contrasts are stark,
but they're created through the small
est of differences half a second sep
arates good and average hang time, and
the angle of the boot determines
whether a kick will sail to its intended
destination or land at an entirely differ
ent part of the field. A good punter can
hit the coffin corner when needed and
boom it when backed up, all the while
giving his gunners enough time to ei
ther down the ball or meet the returner
before he's able to make much of a run.
What does this mean? Shocking as
it sounds, a punter can quite literally
win a game for his team. Hard to digest,
but consider a Sports Illustrated profile
on Dave Zastudil of the Baltimore
Ravens from this past December. In a
6-3 win over Buffalo, he "punted nine
times: seven of the boots forced the
Bills to start from inside their 20, and
three of those put them inside their five.
The Bills have a fine return man in
Roscoe Parrish, but Zastudil and the
Browns' cover team limited him to
seven yards."
Zastudil is one example. Mike
Scifres of the San Diego Chargers was
the most important player in the
Chargers' 23-17 Wild Card Playoff win
over the Indianapolis Colts in 2009. All
six of his punts were downed inside the
20-yard line including two inside the
10 and his net average was an aston
ishing and record-breaking 51.7 yards
per kick. Colts coach Tony Dungy
called Scifres the game's MVP, and for
good reason.
But beyond these scarce accolades,
punters still do not receive their due. It
is easy to see why kickers such as Adam
Vinatieri are such assets, while ones like
Scott Norwood are painful failures. But
punters are frequently forgotten
they don't put up points (at least tangi
bly), and they only come in when your
offense, much to your frustration, has
stalled. The punter is an afterthought
when you're still trying to figure out
how the quarterback missed an open
receiver, and if the returner has enough
wheels to make you pay.
So too is the punter treated on a
broader scale. Look no further than last
week's Hall of Fame class of 2010 an
nouncement, when once again, a
punter was not elected. Of the 260 peo
ple honored since 1963, exactly zero
have been full-time punters. Some
players have pulled double-duty, but
there has been no equivalent to Jan
Stenerud, the lone true placekicker in
the Hall. While it remains difficult for a
kicker to be enshrined, with Stenerud's
precedent set, it becomes all the more
plausible that someone like Vinatieri,
for instance, will one day have a plaque
in Canton.
Not so with punters. The standard
bearer for the cause, willingly or not, is
Ray Guy, commonly believed to be the
best ever at the position. The only
punter to be selected in the first round,
his punting ability is the thing of folk
lore he'd put so much leg behind his
punts that he'd boot himself in the face;
teams had to raise their scoreboards
because of how high his kicks sailed.
Although all-time greats are cur
rently active, like Jeff Feagles and
Shane Lechler, it seems illogical that
one of them would get into the Hall be
fore Guy, who has been on the ballot
for 17 years but has yet to be elected.
Guy was one of the 25 finalists for the
2010 class but once again came up
