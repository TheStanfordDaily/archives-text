### ROXIE DICKINSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's golf team won its spring season
opener last week at the Mauna Lani Invitational, hosted by
University of Hawaii-Manoa and UH-Hilo. The Cardinal
started out the tournament slowly, ending the first round in
a tie for sixth, but really stepped up in the second round,
posting a five-under-par to eventually bask in a come-from
behind win.

Stanford came in a full three strokes ahead of the pack,

beating some of the
top teams in the na
tion and potential
NCAA crown con
tenders. Pac-10
teams dominated
the top five — No. 29
Oregon and No. 12
Washington tied for
second with a five
over overall score.
No. 8 Texas finished
in fourth with six
over, while the No. 1
team in the nation,
Oklahoma, finished
fifth with seven-

over-par for the tour
nament.

"It's really excit
ing to win in a field with 10 teams ranked in the national top
25," said head coach Conrad Ray. "We put in a lot of hard
work in the offseason to be able to come out strong and put
on a show."

No. 5 junior Sihwan Kim led the Cardinal to victory, post
ing consistent scores of 72,70 and 71 to come out with an
overall three-under 213. Kim finished the tournament in a
tie for fourth individually in a tight competition for the indi
vidual crown. Kim was only four strokes behind tournament
winner Buddy Hudson of Texas, who posted a six-under
final round score to seize the tournament individual title.

"This finish was really great for Sihwan," Ray said. "He
has been putting really well and is using a really positive
mental approach that has been helping his game. He defi
nitely led us the whole way through the tournament."
"Sihwan was a little frustrated during the closing round,"
Ray continued. "He hit a ball out of bounds on the 16th com
ing down the final stretch, but he birdied on the 18th to make
up for it. He knew he had a good chance to win in that field,
but regardless, every day he is getting better, and this should
be a really exciting season for him."
No. 19 sophomore David Chung carded a two-over over
all score that put him in a tie for 16th. Chung posted a seven
over 79 for the first round, but then dominated the links with
a four-under 68 and a one-under 71 to finish strong.

Senior Jordan Cox and freshman Andrew Yun came in
with a tie for 29th. Cox was in a tie for eighth after the sec
ond round, earning his best individual round score of his ca
reer. A four-over 76 in the final round yanked him back to
29th. Conversely, Yun struggled in the first two rounds, post
ing two consecutive three-over 755. Yun settled down in the
final round with a one-under 71 to help launch his team to
victory.

Junior Steve Ziegler rounded out the Cardinal five with
a seven-over score of 233.

"We're usually a team that starts a little slower and fin
ishes strong," Ray said. "I don't mind that about us. We
weren't too far back after the first round so we kept plugging
away and were able to put together some good rounds to
give us the win. It's nice to have such a deep team."
The Cardinal hopes to bring this momentum to next
month's tournament against its sworn enemy, USC.
"We are going to do our job to get prepared for a good
week at USC," Ray said. "Hopefully, we will continue to
have a place in the winners' circle."
