## CS team places fourteenth at World Finals 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
A Stanford computer science team
was named North American champi
on last weekend at the ACM
International Collegiate
Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC)
World Finals in Harbin, China.
The team won 14th place overall.
The Stanford team of three was
among about 22,000 contestants from
1,931 universities and 82 countries
who competed in regional contests,
according to team member Jaehyun
Park 'l2.
Park, Jeffrey Wang 'lO and first
year computer science graduate stu
dent Philipp Krahenbiihl qualified to
compete in Harbin after coming in
second in the Pacific Northwest
Regional preliminaries in November.
The United States sent 18 other teams
to compete against 84 other teams.
The team left California Jan. 30 to
compete in Harbin for a week, return
ing on Feb. 6. The team members
missed a week of school to compete,
rescheduling midterms to travel to the
sub-zero temperatures in northern
China.
In the competition, teams are given
five hours to solve challenging com
puter science problems individually.
The team who solves the most prob
lems in the least amount of time wins.
"The problem can be anything
computable and verifiable by com
puters," Park explained in an e-mail.
"The core of a problem is purely
mathematical, but usually the prob
lem setters hide it in a fun and inter
esting story."
Park is no stranger to the world
finals, having competed last year as a
freshman in Stockholm, Sweden
along with Wang and Andy Nguyen
"09. Nguyen is now the team's coach.
"Compared to the last year's
world finals, this year's problem set
was a bit more 'standard,' and per
haps a bit more easily accessible,"
Park said.
A team from Shanghai Jiaotong
University came in first place, correct
ly solving seven problems, followed
by Moscow State University and
National Taiwan University in second
and third, respectively.
Park said that he was half-sur
prised and half-disappointed by
Stanford's win as North American
champion.
"During the first two hours,
Stanford was in first place," Park said.
"We solved the problems really
quickly and precisely. But then we
were stuck and couldn't get more

problems, while other teams slowly
took us over."

The scoreboard, which freezes
during the last hour of competition,
indicated that Stanford was in fifth
place. During the last hour, nine other
teams solved more problems, pushing
Stanford's team ranking down to
fourteenth.
"It was kind of sad considering our

good performance at the beginning,"
added Park. "But we were also star

tied to realize that no schools from
North America did better than us."
Stanford has won the World
Championships three times in ACM
ICPC history, most recently in 1991.
Last year, Stanford placed twentieth;
its team finished seventh in 2008. Next
year's World Finals are scheduled to
be held in Cairo.
