# Vaden revamps insurance
## University officials announce new plan for September 2010 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN DESK EDITOR 
University officials on Tuesday
announced a new dependent health
care offering for students, which
Stanford has lacked since 2006.
Significant changes to Cardinal Care,
the student health insurance plan, were
also announced; changes to both pro
grams will go into effect Sept. 1.
Cardinal Care will extend to a
mandatory 12-month period will
become mandatory for international
students, about 80 percent of whom
already buy that coverage, said Ira
Friedman, director of Vaden Health
Center.
The new dependent insurance plan
will limit enrollment, be subsidized by
the University and offer a cost-effective
pricing brought about by a new insur
ance carrier, Friedman said.
Health Net of California outbid pre
vious Stanford carrier Aetna in a com
petitive bid, according to Friedman.

A plan similar to the new dependent
insurance plan has been offered in past
years, but was stopped in 2006.
"[The previous plan] suffered from
having small numbers of people in it
lots of medical expenses because of
what we call 'adverse selection,'"
Friedman said. "The plan became finan
cially too expensive and in the end,
unsustainable."

Dependent Insurance
The new, optional dependent insur
ance plan for the spouses, domestic
partners and children of Stanford stu
dents comes with thorough changes to
its enrollment period. Starting next aca
demic year, students will only have the
option of enrolling their dependents
upon initial matriculation, unless they
have a "qualifying life event."
"That means that there is a one-time
open enrollment for any student family
that wants to be in the plan," Friedman
said. "For new students, that's going to
be a period of time right before they
first arrive at the University."
According to Friedman, this restric
tion will prevent students from joining
the plan and then dropping it based on
when they may or may not need health
care. For students, he notes, this means
that they should plan well in advance.
"It makes it more efficient, and it

means that the experience for the plan
will be better," he said. "One of the
problems with the previous plan was
that it was left open so that people
could come onto the plan [they]
could leave when they chose based on
when they needed it."
"Qualifying life events," a term refer
ring to such instances as involuntary
loss of previous coverage, the birth of a
child or marriage, when students might
involuntarily lose their coverage, are
the only exception to enrolling in the
plan past the arrival deadline.
Additionally, Stanford will subsidize
some of the plan, although how much it
will cover is unclear. That number, says
Friedman, will depend on the number
of people who enroll in the plan, which
is uncertain until it is officially imple
mented in September.
Overall, Friedman said that Health
Net is offering cost-effective pricing,
with spouse, domestic partner and child
premiums at $202 and $lO3 a month,
respectively.
"Our hope is by offering a very low
premium that we'll get a relatively high
number of healthy people in the plan to
help support it over time," he contin
ued. "It's attractive for people arriving
at the University who say, 'Yes, I want

my spouse, domestic partner, child
covered, and that's what we want.
It's not only for people facing
immediate medical expenses ... It's
a long-term plan."
The application for the plan and
further details will be posted on
Vaden's Web site as they become
available, Friedman said.

Changes to Cardinal Care
Changes to Cardinal Care
involve making the package an
annual enrollment plan, rather than
by-the-quarter. Once Cardinal Care
is purchased, it would last for the
rest of the academic year, eliminat
ing the option for students to pick
which portion of the year for which
they buy coverage.
"It [the previous plan] was leav
ing people uninsured for the quar
ter that they weren't in the
University ... We're trying to elim
inate this uncovered period for stu
dents."
The cost of Cardinal Care, how
ever, is now prorated for students
entering school after fall quarter.
For students that enroll in the
autumn, the cost is $1,024 per quar
ter, increasing to $1,152 for students
who enter Stanford during winter
quarter and $1,536 for students who
enroll in the spring. Students will
not be billed during the summer.
In total, for students who choose
to have Cardinal Care in the fall,
the annual cost will be $3,072.
Although there will be a four per
cent decrease in costs for the new
plan, the quarterly bill will increase.
Whereas the new quarterly cost

equates to $768 evenly throughout
the year in comparison to this year's
current charge of $BOO, students
must pay for summer quarter cov
erage and are billed during three
quarters, increasing the quarterly
bill by $224 if the student enters in
the fall.
"I think the other students, when
they see that it's going to cover
them when it's going to cover them
they're going to appreciate that
they now have full year coverage,"
Friedman said.
The plan in similar to the current
Cardinal Care package in that stu
dents are automatically enrolled
during their first registered quarter.
Students can defer enrollment by
proving that they have equivalent
health insurance in Axess. The
deadline for students to waive
Cardinal Care this year is Sept. 15 if
the student matriculates in the fall.
Other changes to the new plan
include an added transgender surgi
cal benefit and a specialist visit
copay increase to $2O. International
students will also be required to pay
for Cardinal Care and no longer
have the option to waive.
"About 80 percent of interna
tional students are already on
Cardinal Care," Friedman said. "We
find that the 20 percent who are not
many of them have plans that
don't have adequate coverage in
the US."
The mandatory coverage,
according to Friedman, was a rec
ommendation from the Student
Mental Health and Wellbeing task
force during discussions about men
tal health coverage. The task force
determined that mental health care
was inadequately covered.
International students who have
difficulty paying for this fixed cov
erage may get the option for finan

cial aid.
Information on both plans was
published yesterday on Vaden's
Web site. The center will e-mail stu
dents this week, Friedman said.
