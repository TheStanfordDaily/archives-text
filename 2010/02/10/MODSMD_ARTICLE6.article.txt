## Undergraduate tuition raised by University trustees 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University trustees yesterday
approved a 3.5 percent hike in under
graduate tuition, room and board for
the 2010-11 academic year, bringing
the annual cost of a Stanford under
graduate education to $50,576.
Next year will be the first in which
the Stanford undergraduate bill
exceeds $50,000.
The Board of Trustees said the
University next year "expects to pro
vide an equal amount" of financial
aid as this year, when about 50 per
cent of undergraduates received
some $ll2 million in need-based aid.

The contribution that undergrad
uate students are expected to make
toward their college costs will grow
to an annual $4,750 per student, up
from $4,500 this year an increase
of just over 5.5 percent.
Leslie Hume, the chair of the
Board of Trustees, said the board felt
"good" about the adjustments it
approved at its Feb. 8-9 meeting.
"Given the impact that the down
turn has had on so much of our com
munity, we need to be fiscally respon
sible about managing the finances of
the University," Hume said. "This is a
tuition increase that we feel comfort
able with."
In other financial news, Hume

reaffirmed that the University will
temporarily suspend the smoothing
formula usually used on the endow
ment payout. The board has
approved the University reducing
the endowment payout this year by
10 percent, with a further 15 percent
reduction during the 2010-11 aca
demic year.
"Some of our peer institutions are
going to be reducing payouts over a
longer time frame, say over the next
five or six years," Hume said. "We
hope to see payouts increasing again
by 2011 or 2012."
The board also approved a 5.8
percent jump in tuition at Stanford
Law School, to $44,880 from this

year's $42,420.
General graduate tuition is set to
increase 3.5 percent to $38,700 next
year, up from $37,380 this year.
Engineering graduates and entering
MBA students will also face a 3.5
percent increase.
Returning MBA students' tuition
will remain in line with this year's
charge.
For undergraduates, the increase
they or their families may see
on their bill next year includes hikes
in tuition and in room and board fees.
Tuition will grow 3.5 percent to
$38,700, while room and board
charges will rise 3.6 percent to
$11,876, including $6,700 for dorm
rooms and $5,176 for meal plans.
Hume confirmed that Stanford
will uphold a financial aid program
established in 2008 that covers
tuition, room and board costs for
students whose families earn less
than $60,000 a year. For families
earning less than $lOO,OOO a year,
Stanford covers tuition.
Reporting on land and building
projects, Hume said the board gave
final approval for the construction of
Bing Concert Hall, which will be
able to seat 877 people.
Construction is expected to begin in
this May and wrap in November
2012. The budget for the Bing
Concert Hall is $llO million.
The board also approved con
struction of the Mulberry House, a
$4.9 million new childcare center,
and the East Campus Dining
Commons, a two-story dining hall
planned for the parking lot between
Toyon Hall and Crothers Hall.
The next Board of Trustees meet
ing, in April, will be held at Yale
University.
