## Senate debates bill to cap election spending 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As ASSU election season approaches, undergraduate senators and the
elections commission seem to agree on one thing: creating an equal oppor
tunity for all students to run for ASSU positions.
The floor, however, remains divided about how best to achieve those
ends. Central to Tuesday evening's "equal opportunity" debate over elec
tions were crucial questions about spending for executive candidates.

Exec Spending Caps for Equal Opportunity Campaigning?

A bill that would enforce
spending caps of $2,000 on
elections campaigns and
authored by ASSU Vice
President Andy Parker 'lO was
opposed by several senators,
some of whom feared the caps
would do all but level the play
ing field as groups solicit third
parties to offer additional
funding.
According to Quinn Slack
'll, the elections commission
er, passing the bill could
"affect the quality of elec
tions."
"I don't think that we can
presuppose that it will be non
controversial, that it will be
enforceable," Slack said.
"Candidates are going to try to
get around it, and that will
greatly affect the legitimacy of
the elections."

The public financing option
that Slack is pressing, which
would allow candidates to be
reimbursed up to $750, aims to
allow students more freedom
for innovation rather than to
govern their spending limits.
Slack, however, said that he
wants to increase that amount

the matching funds may be
slightly different from reim
bursement, although he hasn't
said yet how much they could
potentially increase.
Proponents of the bill sug
gested that the legislation be
held until next year to allow
adequate time for its review
and to give candidates proper
notice and time for adjustment
as well as for consideration of
other equity challenges.
Senator Shelly Gao 'll said
she thought spending caps
would challenge the freedom
of speech. Caps were rejected
