## Senate debates bill to cap election spending 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As ASSU election season approaches, undergraduate senators and the
elections commission seem to agree on one thing: creating an equal oppor
tunity for all students to run for ASSU positions.
The floor, however, remains divided about how best to achieve those
ends. Central to Tuesday evening's "equal opportunity" debate over elec
tions were crucial questions about spending for executive candidates.

Exec Spending Caps for Equal Opportunity Campaigning?

A bill that would enforce
spending caps of $2,000 on
elections campaigns and
authored by ASSU Vice
President Andy Parker 'lO was
opposed by several senators,
some of whom feared the caps
would do all but level the play
ing field as groups solicit third
parties to offer additional
funding.
According to Quinn Slack
'll, the elections commission
er, passing the bill could
"affect the quality of elec
tions."
"I don't think that we can
presuppose that it will be non
controversial, that it will be
enforceable," Slack said.
"Candidates are going to try to
get around it, and that will
greatly affect the legitimacy of
the elections."

The public financing option
that Slack is pressing, which
would allow candidates to be
reimbursed up to $750, aims to
allow students more freedom
for innovation rather than to
govern their spending limits.
Slack, however, said that he
wants to increase that amount

the matching funds may be
slightly different from reim
bursement, although he hasn't
said yet how much they could
potentially increase.
Proponents of the bill sug
gested that the legislation be
held until next year to allow
adequate time for its review
and to give candidates proper
notice and time for adjustment
as well as for consideration of
other equity challenges.
Senator Shelly Gao 'll said
she thought spending caps
would challenge the freedom
of speech. Caps were rejected
in a 1999 attempt.

Short Term Special Fees Reform, A
Three-Pronged Approach
The Senate continued with addi
tional strides in special fees legisla
tion in what Administration and
Rules Committee Chair Alex Katz
'l2 called a "three-pronged
approach," with several measures
intended to address short-term solu
tions to an explosion in refund rates.
Although previously students
were allowed three weeks at the
beginning of the quarter to submit
refund requests, the proposed bill
suggests shortening the refund period
to two weeks with the hopes of
reducing refunds. ASSU Financial
Manager Matt McLaughlin 'OB antic
ipates that such a measure could cut
between 100 and 150 refunds each
quarter.
Additionally, a formal survey and
a measure to apply the refund to the
University account rather than as a
check issued to the student might dis
courage refund requests, some sena
tors said.
A final component of the bill
would cover refund rates for student
groups up to 16 percent this quarter,
then drop down to 13 percent refund
coverage in the spring and ten per
cent by next fall. The general fee
would continue to be covered at a
hundred percent.
Although the buffer fund hovers
at $250,000, with the unprecedented
increase in refund rates, this pool
could evaporate rapidly if no changes
are issued.
"We'd have two to three years of
covering everything probably
even less." Katz said, adding, "We
don't have the money."
Katz also sees the measure as a
step toward jumpstarting accounta
bility for individual special fees
groups.
"We want to help groups, but we
also need to give them a kick in the
butt and start getting out there to
protect their own groups," he said.

Joint Bylaws Amendment: Releasing
SUID Numbers to VSOs
While increasing accountability
for students that request refunds
remains an agenda item for the
Senate as it seeks to mitigate sky

rocketing refund rates, many seem to
agree that these aims cannot under
mine student privacy.
Privacy was formally articulated in
a bill intended to remove language
that allows access to SUID numbers
by student groups from the joint
bylaws. As McLaughlin put it: "You
have no choice but to pass this bill."
Nanci Howe, associate dean and
director of student activities, agreed
that a bill that protects student priva
cy is crucial.
Senator Zachary Warma 'll also
enlisted his support for the bill for
fear of "backlash" by "particularly
vehement" VSOs.
Tommy Tobin TO returned to the
Senate floor to again appeal to issues
of the body's transparency and con
sistency on matters of funding poli
cies. He expressed disappointment
with what he calls the inconsistency
with which the Appropriations
Committee exercises its discretion.
Tobin compared the case of
SPOON, which was denied funding

for some travel expenses in October,
and that of the Black Student Union
which recently was approved for
funding for other reasons â€”to
demonstrate how the groups were
treated with differently with regard
to funding modifications.

Next Week
Among the action items for next
week are several bills aimed at estab
lishing a formal process in the future
for the replacement of ASSU vice
president in the event of resignation
or removal, as well as establishing a
formal process for approval of mem
bers of the executive and legislative
bodies. A public hearing to determine
sophomore Daniel Limon's status as
a senator for the remainder of the
term, after a fall quarter leave of
absence, will also be held next week.
All funding bills for this past week
were unanimously passed.
