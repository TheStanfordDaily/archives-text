# Student groups attend mandatory special fees information session
## 
### LAUREN WILSON 
About 25 student group and ASSU
representatives filled Old Union 200
on Monday night for an informational
meeting about how to prepare their
2010 budgets ahead of application sea
son for special fees funding.
The session came on the heels of
several weeks of action on and debate
over special fees reform, which elected
student leaders have called necessary
for the long-term health of ASSU's
and student groups' budgets.
ASSU leaders last week approved
changes to next year's special fees
funding policies that will tighten how
special fees groups about 50 of
Stanford's largest student clubs and
organizations may spend the
money students vote to allocate them
in spring elections. The ASSU
Undergraduate Senate continued
debate at its meeting Tuesday night.
Financial officers for groups hop
ing to apply for special fees were
required to attend an information ses
sion; another is set for today at 7 p.m.
Few officers attended committee
meetings in recent weeks where many
of the reformed policies were devel
oped.
On Monday, Quinn Slack 'll, the
ASSU elections commissioner, led off
with a walk-through about how groups
can secure a spot on the special fees bal
lot this spring. Roxna Irani 'lO, the fund
ing coordinator for Stanford Student
Enterprises, discussed how to use the
"myGroups" Web site for submitting
group budgets.

Anton Zietsman 'l2, chair of the
Senate Appropriations Committee,
told groups that the Senate will not
extend deadlines and expects student
groups to prepare their applications
early. He said undergraduate and joint
groups should come to mandatory
interviews with the Appropriates
Committee prepared to justify any
increase in their budget.
The committee implemented
more stringent guidelines this year
for many line items, including event
food, which it disallowed unless
"absolutely necessary for the success
or occurrence of the event."

Countdown to Election
In the first three weeks of every
quarter, undergraduates, who this
academic year have paid $ll9 per
quarter in special fees, are allowed to
apply for a refund from groups they
do not wish to fund. ASSU financial
leaders have expressed a concern
that many students request refunds
but continue to use special fees
groups' services and programming.
Refund rates have continued to
rise; after this quarter's seven-quarter
high of 379 student requests for full

refunds of special fees, the ASSU
began reforming the special fees
process to keep from overspending
its budget.
The process to get special fees
begins with groups submitting a
budget and application, as well as
scheduling an interview with the
Undergraduate Senate or Graduate
Student Council, depending on which
student population the group serves.
Once a club receives approval,
provided that its budget request does
not increase from the previous year
by more than the 2.7 percent infla
tion rate and that the group was
approved by voters last year, the
group gets placed on the ballot.
Groups that request more than a
2.7 percent increase must submit a
petition with the signatures of at least
10 percent of their student popula
tion â€” graduate, undergraduate or
both.
If the Senate or GSC deny a
group's application for an increase,
the group can still get on the ballot by
going through the same petition
process, but with signatures from 15
percent of the appropriate popula
tion.
The special fees application dead
line is Feb. 19; the petition deadline is
March 5. The spring election is set for
April 8-9.
