About 25 student group and ASSU
representatives filled Old Union 200
on Monday night for an informational
meeting about how to prepare their

The session came on the heels of
several weeks of action on and debate
over special fees reform, which elected
student leaders have called necessary
for the long-term health of ASSU's
and student groups' budgets.
ASSU leaders last week approved
changes to next year's special fees
funding policies that will tighten how
special fees groups about 50 of
Stanford's largest student clubs and
organizations may spend the
money students vote to allocate them
in spring elections. The ASSU
Undergraduate Senate continued
debate at its meeting Tuesday night.
Financial officers for groups hop
ing to apply for special fees were
required to attend an information ses
sion; another is set for today at 7 p.m.
Few officers attended committee
meetings in recent weeks where many
of the reformed policies were devel

On Monday, Quinn Slack 'll, the
ASSU elections commissioner, led off
with a walk-through about how groups
can secure a spot on the special fees bal
lot this spring. Roxna Irani 'lO, the fund
ing coordinator for Stanford Student
Enterprises, discussed how to use the
