# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Learning to Think and Learning to Do 
### Danny Crichton 
r I ihe liberal arts have not had a strong few
decades considering the steep decline of
A the humanities major and the concomi
tant rise of business degrees. However, recent
and thought-provoking discussions on the
value of the liberal arts in business curriculums
have rekindled an age-old debate on the value
of education: is it about learning to think or
learning to do?
This divide in education is at the heart of the
so-called 'techie' versus 'fuzzy' divide here at
Stanford. Engineers build bridges, write soft
ware programs and design processors. They are
doers, not thinkers. Those in the humanities and
social science ponder deep thoughts, write pa
pers elucidating these thoughts and then go to
lunch to talk about Keats or Hume. They are
thinkers, not doers.
For such sophisticated consumers of infor
mation, Stanford students appear to have
bought into this stereotype and have agreed to
this core divide. That is unfortunate, because I
fervently believe that this divide does not exist
at all. Having spent time on both sides (I consid
er myself a 'tezzy,' which is fortunate because
the alternative combination is unprintable), I
can state that both the social science and hu
manities students and the engineers are
thinkers and doers.
The social sciences focus on devising a sci
ence of humanity, with the ability to predict ac
tions and explain phenomenon. They generate
hypotheses, collect data and determine theories
that provide predictive power. In this way, they
devise solutions to problems, such as how to dis
tribute resources fairly. The same action mental
ity exists in the humanities. History pieces to
gether evidence from the past to explain our
world and to provide better information about
our current environment. Philosophy can deter
mine the best course of action given a set of cir
cumstances.
Those in the humanities and social sciences
are doers, just as engineers are thinkers. Few
computer programs are mere duplications of
past work. Even similar requirements for a
piece of software will require different choices
due to context. A slightly higher number of
users or a change in the speed of the processor
can have repercussions, and such trade-offs re
quire experience and indeed, thinking, to deter
mine the best outcomes. Such trade-offs and
changes are similar in all the engineering sci
ences. Without engineers thinking, much of our
technology would simply be inoperable (or
nonexistent).
Why, then, are the fuzzy and techie stereo
types so ingrained? For that matter, why is the
central division between doers and thinkers still
prevalent? I believe that their source is an issue
of culture. The two supposed sides have differ
ent means of solving problems, and to a certain
degree, they are incompatible with each other.

However, that incompatibility has led to the
meltdown of the economy, as those in quantita
tive fields failed to consider other traditions
among dozens of other examples. For this rea
son, business schools are starting to add the lib
eral arts to their curriculums (most notably at
Stanford's GSB). Why graduate someone with
only one type of skills? Instead, use both
sources to create students with a strong and di
verse fountain of knowledge on which to build
a career.
With all the discussion of changes to the
freshman year, now is an excellent time to con
sider the necessary skills and background that
should be taught to all graduates of our school.
IHUM,for all of its controversy, meets its objec
tives well. The problem is that its goals are in
consistent with the broad background needed
for an introductory course in the freshman year.
Instead, I would like to see a freshman year
course focused on trade-offs in a broad range of
disciplines. Trade-offs are at the heart of living
in a democratic society and any discipline
where resources are not infinite. Imagine a
class that focused on questions of ethics (asking
which of multiple options is most ethical), so
cial sciences (asking which policy is best) and
engineering/sciences (considering resource al
location and choices between multiple techni
cal options). The integrated and interdiscipli
nary sequence could create a consilience of the
humanities and sciences a critical asset in
the world we now find ourselves.
From there, we need to better integrate lit
eracy in both technical and humanities disci
plines for all students, regardless of major. It is
still unbelievable to me that engineers and sci
entists can graduate without a grounding in
ethics, and that humanities students can gradu
ate without a basic understanding of statistics.
Opening the minds to the entire intellectual
legacy of humanity is a worthy and necessary
goal.
The divide between doing and thinking in
education has endured since the time of the
Greeks, and it seems almost impregnable. On
the micro-level though, we can create the out
reach and the bridges necessary to fill in the di
vide. We are all tezzys now, or, if you prefer, that
other label.
