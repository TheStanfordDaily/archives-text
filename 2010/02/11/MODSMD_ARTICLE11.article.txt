# ALTERNATIVE LIVING...WITHOUT THE NAKED
## Dorks Are Awesome 
### Samantha Toh 
The weekend after my first column, I
woke up to a flurry of e-mails from
friends and a couple of strangers. Com
ments, as all narcissistic writers will tell you,
cause great excitement, and I, being particu
larly narcissistic, was abuzz with glee.
"Hooray!" I said to myself, clicking
through my e-mails.
Tragically, my glee began to diminish rap
idly. While comments ranged from strong, in
telligent opinions to the glorification of my
awesomeness, most of them at least men
tioned the bizarre nature of my profile pic
ture.To quote one,"You look angsty with rolls
of fat coming out of your face."
Thank you, Michael, for destroying into
small pieces what was once my ego. However,
despite many days of mulling over the prob
lem, one will probably notice that I (a) still
look angsty (unfortunate photography) and
(b) still have rolls of fat coming out of my face
(an unfortunate scarf). While the lack of
change was due more to laziness than to a
sudden decline in vanity, all that mulling
caused me to wonder if my very laziness is
what helps me embrace and occasionally em
body the undignified, the weird and the en
dearingly stupid.
There is something to say for that. While
there is nothing wrong with aspiring to stan
dards of beauty or perfection, I feel that the
awkward and the lame have been overlooked
for far too long. Why not welcome a bit of
dorkiness?
While standards change depending on the
city, I feel this particularly strongly in Paris.
Here, even my friends, long comfortable with
my crazy socks and giant T-shirts, tell me off
for wearing a sweatshirt on a Saturday after
noon. My stripy, wool-stuffed hand-warmers
are even less of an acceptable phenomenon.
"You look like you're wearing boxing
gloves," one friend told me.
"They keep me warm," I said.
"You're in Paris" was the reply.
Well, Paris needed a fistwich, I said to my
self through gritted teeth.

At the root of this fiasco, however, is real
ly the question, why not? Why not embrace,
with enthusiasm and great delight, the am
biguously stupid and the vaguely bizarre?
Sometimes, the most awkward admissions
can shape a personality, and even more so, the
weird and unsophisticated.
Some of my favorite engagements with
people have been defined by such cases. I
began getting to know one of the girls from
my Bing program a few weeks ago, at a lovely

outdoor market outing. We traversed rows of
men and women, their foodstuffs displayed
beneath colorful tents. We looked at piles of
breads and pastries, some still warm. And sud
denly, before a fishmonger, giant salmon fil
lets lain out pink and moist on ice, she said, "I
really like dead fish."
"What?" I said.
"I really like looking at dead fish. Their
eyes are so cool."
I stared at the tuna she was ogling at it
eyeballed me back. I imagined it feebly
twitching with the last pulses of life.
"Cool?" I said, hesitantly.
That moment, however, has stuck with me,
and I think of it frequently when I meet up
with her. It is a hilarious personality brand,
something to remember fondly. Likewise for
other people I have met, I remember their
disastrous moments of hilarity more than I do
their moments of dignity or sophistication.
Walking around unintentionally with a milk
moustache, talking to me for an hour with a
booger in their nose, running to greet me and
then hitting a glass d00r... or even more
simply, all those moments where people have
said something ridiculous, unbelievable or
just plain stupid.
I sometimes wonder if I am the only one
who receives a text message with bad gram
mar and thinks it is sexy. I love people in
sweatpants, wearing their sloppy weekend
sleepy looks, and I love people yodeling on
about their favorite 18th-century English
novel. I love mismatched socks, and some
times very occasionally and God forbid
I find people wearing Crocs slightly endear
ing. And I sincerely hope that I'm not the only
one who embraces the dork, because I'm one
of the biggest ones woolly hand-warmers
and all. This dork wants some love in Paris, or
perhaps just some company. Make my day
and join me. Be a dork. Be an awesome dork.
