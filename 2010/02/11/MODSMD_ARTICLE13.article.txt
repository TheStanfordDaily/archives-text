## BACK ON THE FARM 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If there was ever a time for the Cardinal to
come home, it is definitely right about now.
Stanford (10-13,4-7 Pac-10) returns to the
friendly confines of Maples Pavilion tonight
when it faces Washington State (15-8,5-6) at 7
p.m. The game and this weekend's homes
tand, for that matter will be extra important
as Stanford is looking to recover from a 0-4
stretch over the last two weeks on the road.
Despite the close losses the Cardinal suf
fered down in Southern California this past
weekend, head coach Johnny Dawkins re
mained optimistic about the course of his
team's season.
"They were tough games for us," he said of
the Cardinal's close losses to UCLA and USC.
"But I think we grew. We had opportunities to
win each game at the end, and I think we just
have to learn to minimize our mistakes. If we
can cut down on mistakes, I think the rest will
kind of take care of itself."
Things seem to take much better care of
themselves at Maples Pavilion for the Cardi
nal. Dawkins' squad is just as good at home as
it is poor on the road: Stanford has won every
conference home game it has played this sea
son, while losing every one it has played on the
road. Tonight's game will be all the more cru
cial considering that, while only three games
behind first-place Cal, the Cardinal currently
stands alone at last place in the conference (al
beit by a half game) with a record of 4-7.
"We have a chance to make up some
ground," Dawkins said. "We have five out of
our last seven games at home. It would have
been nice to win some games on the road, but
we can still take care of business and we'll have
a chance to be in this conference race."
The Cougars are coming into Thursday's
game fresh off an impressive win over then
first-place Arizona by the score of 78-60. Dick
Bennett's team is led by one of the best, if not
the youngest, backcourt duos in the confer
ence sophomore shooting guard Klay
Thompson and freshman point guard Reggie
Moore. Thompson is the second-leading scor
er in the conference behind Stanford's own
senior forward Landry Fields at 21.2 points
a game, while Moore has made a solid case for
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year with an average
of 14.1 points and 4.3 assists a game.
"We have to be good defensively. They're
an explosive offensive team," Dawkins said.
This year's Washington State squad marks
a break from the past, as the Cougars have

been known for their stifling defense and me
thodical half-court sets in recent years. The
team has picked up the pace on the offensive
side of the ball, however, averaging more than
75 points a game this season.
The outcome of Thursday's game will like
ly be determined by the play of the respective
backcourts. Fields, likely on his way to Player
of the Year in the conference, is bound to get
his points and rebounds. What will be truly
crucial for Stanford will be whether or not the
backcourt trio of senior Drew Shiller and
sophomores Jeremy Green and Jarrett Mann
will be able to neutralize the threat posed by
Moore and Thompson. In particular, the
matchup between two up-and-coming shoot
ing guards Green and Thompson will be
one to watch.
A win tonight would help keep the Cardi
nal afloat in the Pac-10, but a loss would be
de vastating to its hopes of finishing the regular
season with a decent seed for the conference
tournament. Saturday's opponent Washington
presents an even greater threat than its state
counterpart, so a victory tonight is basically a
must for Dawkins and his team going into Sat
urday's game.
"It's a big weekend," the second-year coach
said. "[We're facing] two good teams with ter
rific players. For us, we look forward to the
matchups ... we're excited about the oppor
tunity we see in front of us."

GAME NOTES : Stanford looks to extend its homecourt dom
inance after its road woes continued last weekend. The
Cardinal lost its fourth straight game (and 10th straight
road game) Saturday against USC, dropping the team to
last place in the conference. Stanford will try to rebound
against Washington State, which is coming off a 78-60
win over the then-conference leader Arizona on Saturday.
