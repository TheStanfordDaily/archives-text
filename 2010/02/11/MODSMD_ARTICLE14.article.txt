# SOFTBALL LOOKS TO RELOAD

### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford Softball team opens its season today
when it takes on Texas A&M-Corpus Christi in the first game of
a tournament at the University of Hawaii.
The Cardinal will play four more games this weekend, one
each against McNeese State and the University of Hawaii be
fore the teams conclude with a mini four-team, single elimina
tion tournament on Saturday.
The trip to Hawaii is the beginning of a highly anticipated
season for the Cardinal, as it tries to achieve its goals of winning
the Pac-10 Conference title and reaching the College World Se
ries.
Last season ended on a sour note for Stanford, losing a three
game series to the University of Arizona in the Super Regionals
and thus missing out on a chance to go to the College World Se
ries.
Stanford, picked to finish fourth in the conference, returns
eight starters from last year's team, though it will be difficult to
replace the two seniors that did graduate Missy Penna and
Maddy Coon.
Penna was Stanford's No. 1 pitcher for all four of her years on

Senior third baseman Shannon Koplitz and the No. 10 Cardinal look to surpass
last year's Super Regional team in 2010. Stanford will have to replace
Ail-American pitcher Missy Penna and second baseman Maddy Coon.
the Farm, compiling 119 wins and
1,267 strikeouts.
Head coach John Rittman admit
ted the difficulty in losing Penna and
Coon.
"To replace two kids that started
pretty much every game in their ca
reers is difficult," Rittman said.
"Maddy and Missy meant so much to
this program."
Rittman, however, brought in one
of the nation's top recruiting classes
this year to help ease the losses.
Charged with replacing the All-
American Penna in the circle will be
a combination of highly-touted
freshman Teagan Gerhart sister of
Stanford football running back Toby
Gerhart and freshman catcher
Kelsey Gerhart and junior Ashley
Chinn.
Although Rittman doesn't expect
either pitcher to be Penna immedi
ately and admits that he doesn't have
a No. 1 yet, he does have faith in both
of their abilities.
"Ashley has a lot of experience,
and I believe she is ready to step up
and be a go-to pitcher," Rittman said.
"Teagan was highly recruited and we
are looking for her to pitch big in
nings for us."
Teagan Gerhart understands that
there may be some bumps in the road
early on, but she appears to be ready
to play whatever role Rittman asks of
her.
"I know it's going to be hard," she
said. "But I'm up for the challenge
and I can't wait for the season to
start."
Taking over for Coon at second
base will be sophomore Ashley
Hansen. Hansen was a Second-Team
All-American a year ago, playing
shortstop for the Cardinal. But this

year, she will take her leadership
skills and rocket arm to the right side
of the infield.

Although it is a move she may not
be completely thrilled about, Hansen
who was one of two Stanford play
ers to play for the U.S. National Team
this summer says she is prepared
to do what is best for the team. If that
is for her to play second base, then
that is what she will do.
"I'm comfortable at wherever
coach puts me on the field," Hansen
said. "Obviously I love playing short
stop, but I'll do what I need to do to
make the team better. It's a new chal
lenge, and I can still be a leader at sec
ond base."
Replacing Hansen at shortstop is
one of the headliners of Stanford's
seven-woman freshman class, Jenna
Rich.
Rich will also serve as the team's
third pitcher and No. 3 hitter in the
lineup. How she fares this season
could be a strong indicator of Stan
ford's success. She will also have the
task of hitting behind two All-Amer
icans in the lineup: senior leftfielder
and leadoff hitter Alissa Haber and
Hansen.

Haber is a three-time All-Ameri
can and the other Stanford player to

play for Team USA this summer. She
is a five-tool player who will again be
looked at to lead the Stanford of
fense. She also understands that this
is her last shot at making a College
World Series.

"I'm just trying to get better every
day I understand that the end
point is drawing near," Haber said.
"I'm trying not to put too much pres
sure on myself because I know this
team has a lot of talent and depth."
Haber has been remarkably con
sistent for three years and, along with
Hansen, is expected to get on base
and make sure that the team scores
enough runs to offset the loss of
Penna.

Rounding out the projected start
ing lineup is senior catcher Rosey
Neill, who is a two-time Pac-10 De
fensive Player of the Year and the
team's biggest power threat; senior
third baseman Shannon Koplitz, who
is expected to occupy one of the slots
in the middle of the Cardinal lineup;
sophomore centerfielder and speed
ster Sarah Hassman; and sophomore
rightfielder Maya Burns.
There will be a tight position battle
at first base between junior Melisa
Koutz and sophomore Jenna Becerra,
with the loser likely to occupy the des
ignated player spot in the lineup. (Al
though whenTeagan Gerhart pitches,
she will probably hit for herself).
This Cardinal team should be very
different from the ones over the past
few years, as offense will likely be
abundant. One thing has not
changed, however, and that is the ulti
mate goal of winning a national title,
Hansen put it best, saying, "The
goal is to win the last game of the sea
son. Everything else is a disappoint
ment."
That goal starts today in Hawaii,
and if all goes well, ends in Oklahoma
City in June.
