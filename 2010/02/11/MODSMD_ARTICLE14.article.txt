### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford Softball team opens its season today
when it takes on Texas A&M-Corpus Christi in the first game of
a tournament at the University of Hawaii.
The Cardinal will play four more games this weekend, one
each against McNeese State and the University of Hawaii be
fore the teams conclude with a mini four-team, single elimina
tion tournament on Saturday.
The trip to Hawaii is the beginning of a highly anticipated
season for the Cardinal, as it tries to achieve its goals of winning
the Pac-10 Conference title and reaching the College World Se
ries.
Last season ended on a sour note for Stanford, losing a three
game series to the University of Arizona in the Super Regionals
and thus missing out on a chance to go to the College World Se
ries.
Stanford, picked to finish fourth in the conference, returns
eight starters from last year's team, though it will be difficult to
replace the two seniors that did graduate Missy Penna and
Maddy Coon.
Penna was Stanford's No. 1 pitcher for all four of her years on
