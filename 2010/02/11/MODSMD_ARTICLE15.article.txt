Coming home after a successful weekend in
Texas, the No. 14 Stanford women's tennis
team (4-0) hopes to keep this year's undefeat
ed streak going as it takes on No. 59 Sacramen
to State (3-1).
The Cardinal was faced with two challeng
ing Texas teams that proved to play above
their rankings and against a home crowd
that was out for blood. Successfully rising to
the task, Stanford defeated TCU, 6-1 and
Texas, 5-2 to come home with the wins. Now,
the Cardinal faces a team back at Taube Fam
ily Tennis Stadium with all the force of history

on its side. The Cardinal's streak of 153 home
wins in a row, the longest active home winning
streak in NCAA Division I athletics, means it
has not seen a loss here since Feb. 27,1999.
"That's the way we look at it," said senior
captain Lindsay Burdette. "If we play at home,
we win. We obviously expect to win every time
we step on the court no matter where we are.
However, if [the streak] ends, we as a team are
strong enough this year that we can have some
thing catastrophic happen and still recover."
Does a streak like that add to the pressure
faced by some of the newer players on the
team?
"Not so much the winning streak," said
freshman Mallory Burdette. "I feel like the

Stanford legacy in general is more I don't
want to say pressure, but it's definitely in the
back of your mind. I just really want to contin
ue that. It motivates you."
What has really helped the team rush out to
a 4-0 start this year has been the doubles action.
Stanford had not lost a doubles match, nor re
ally been challenged, until this weekend at
Texas when freshmen Stacey Tan and Mallory
Burdette lost at the No. 2 spot, 9-8 (5). Even in
that match, they were ahead until a spirited
comeback by the Texas duo brought it to a
tiebreak.
"Stacey and I pretty much lost the doubles
because we got heckled a lot," Mallory
said. "We were up match point when
[the Texas men's team] came over and
started talking to us between points.
We ended up losing in a tiebreaker,
which was frustrating."
Junior Hilary Barte and Lindsay
Burdette lead the Cardinal as the No. 2
team nationally. They have won 16
consecutive matches, including tour
nament play, and are 17-1 overall and
5-0 in dual play. Their closest dual
match win was 8-3 against Texas, and
their one loss came at the beginning of
the year against Tennessee, when they
dropped an 8-4 decision.
"Doubles is really great," Lindsay
said. "We still have that confidence
that if we stick to our bread and butter,
we're going to be competitive no mat
ter who we play."
The two have been partners for
three years and amassed an overall
record of 61-21. They have achieved
their highest national ranking this year
at No. 2, and they went all the way to
the NCAA Doubles Championships
last year before losing to Cal's Mari
Andersson and Jana Juricova, 6-3,6-4.
The pair has come together and con
stantly improved with each match they
play.

"It's been a long road, but I love
playing doubles with Lindsay," Barte
said. "It's pretty special because I feel

of its matches this season. Stanford now returns
home, where it has won 153 matches in a row, to
take on No. 59 Sacramento State.

like we're at that point where if I
closed my eyes, I'd still know exactly
where she's staying and how she'd hit
the ball."

Stanford's opponent this week is
Sacramento State. Despite dropping a
dual match to Cal, the team has
toughed out several wins, including a
4-3 decision over the Oregon Ducks.
When the Hornets have won the dou
bles point, they have gone on to win
the day every match this year. Against
Cal, the No. 1 team of Clarisse Baca
and Katrina Zheltova was actually
fairly close behind Cal's team of Juri
cova and Andersson when play was
halted at 6-4.

In singles play, Sacramento State
boasts a powerful player in senior Ka
trina Zheltova, last week's Big Sky

Tennis Player of the Week. She took
No. 2-ranked Juricova to three sets be
fore succumbing, and has a ranking for
herself at No. 26. Under her leadership,
the Hornets have been picked to re
peat as Big Sky Champions for the

eighth consecutive time.
The match begins at 1:30 p.m. today
against Sacramento State.
