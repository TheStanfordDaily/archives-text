Coming home after a successful weekend in
Texas, the No. 14 Stanford women's tennis
team (4-0) hopes to keep this year's undefeat
ed streak going as it takes on No. 59 Sacramen
to State (3-1).
The Cardinal was faced with two challeng
ing Texas teams that proved to play above
their rankings and against a home crowd
that was out for blood. Successfully rising to
the task, Stanford defeated TCU, 6-1 and
Texas, 5-2 to come home with the wins. Now,
the Cardinal faces a team back at Taube Fam
ily Tennis Stadium with all the force of history

on its side. The Cardinal's streak of 153 home
wins in a row, the longest active home winning
streak in NCAA Division I athletics, means it
has not seen a loss here since Feb. 27,1999.
"That's the way we look at it," said senior
captain Lindsay Burdette. "If we play at home,
we win. We obviously expect to win every time
we step on the court no matter where we are.
However, if [the streak] ends, we as a team are
strong enough this year that we can have some
thing catastrophic happen and still recover."
Does a streak like that add to the pressure
faced by some of the newer players on the
team?
"Not so much the winning streak," said
freshman Mallory Burdette. "I feel like the

Stanford legacy in general is more I don't
want to say pressure, but it's definitely in the
back of your mind. I just really want to contin
ue that. It motivates you."
What has really helped the team rush out to
a 4-0 start this year has been the doubles action.
Stanford had not lost a doubles match, nor re
ally been challenged, until this weekend at
Texas when freshmen Stacey Tan and Mallory
Burdette lost at the No. 2 spot, 9-8 (5). Even in
that match, they were ahead until a spirited
comeback by the Texas duo brought it to a
tiebreak.
"Stacey and I pretty much lost the doubles
