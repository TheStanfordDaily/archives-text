# Big Meet for women's swimming
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's swimming and diving
team has established itself as the team to beat in
the Pac-10, with big wins over No. 9 Southern Cal
ifornia and No. 2 Arizona. Only one obstacle re
mains for the No. 4 Cardinal (8-0, 4-0 Pac-10) to
earn a second consecutive undefeated season: its
meet this weekend on the Farm against No. 5 Cali
fornia (5-1,3-1).

While the swimmers' current focus is on the
dual meet, these results will have little bearing on
the postseason. Last year, Stanford defeated Cal
169-129 in Berkeley, but the Golden Bears went on
to claim the Pac-10 and NCAA championships
while the Cardinal finished in third and fourth
place at those meets, respectively. Indeed, Stanford
has been unable to win the Pac-10 Tournament de
spite defeating the Golden Bears in the Big Meet
the last three years in a row.

"I think we're really looking toward Pac-lOs
and NCAAs," said head coach Lea Maurer. "[The
meet] will give me a lot of insight that I need to do
a lot in the next week and a half to get ready."
This year, the Cardinal appears to be stronger
and poised to make a run at both titles. It has
cruised past its conference competition its sig
nature win came on Jan. 22 against Arizona, when
it defeated the Wildcats 173-125. By contrast, Cal
has struggled against these teams. It defeated Ari
zona 165-134, but fell to USC 147-153.
In the meet, the Cardinal will look to the trio of
senior Julia Smit, senior Elaine Breeden and jun
ior Kate Dwelley to provide the firepower neces
sary to overcome Cal. Smit is the world record
holder in both the 200- and 400-meter individual

GAME NOTES: No. 4 Stanford closes out its regular season
against its rival, No. 5 Cal, in the Big Meet this Saturday.
The Cardinal is looking to finish the regular season un
defeated for the third time in four years. Despite beating
Cal in last year's Big Meet, the Cardinal fell to Cal in
Pac-10s and nationals, so Stanford is out for redemption.
