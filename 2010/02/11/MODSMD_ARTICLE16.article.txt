# Big Meet for women's swimming
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's swimming and diving
team has established itself as the team to beat in
the Pac-10, with big wins over No. 9 Southern Cal
ifornia and No. 2 Arizona. Only one obstacle re
mains for the No. 4 Cardinal (8-0, 4-0 Pac-10) to
earn a second consecutive undefeated season: its
meet this weekend on the Farm against No. 5 Cali
fornia (5-1,3-1).

While the swimmers' current focus is on the
dual meet, these results will have little bearing on
the postseason. Last year, Stanford defeated Cal
169-129 in Berkeley, but the Golden Bears went on
to claim the Pac-10 and NCAA championships
while the Cardinal finished in third and fourth
place at those meets, respectively. Indeed, Stanford
has been unable to win the Pac-10 Tournament de
spite defeating the Golden Bears in the Big Meet
the last three years in a row.

"I think we're really looking toward Pac-lOs
and NCAAs," said head coach Lea Maurer. "[The
meet] will give me a lot of insight that I need to do
a lot in the next week and a half to get ready."
This year, the Cardinal appears to be stronger
and poised to make a run at both titles. It has
cruised past its conference competition its sig
nature win came on Jan. 22 against Arizona, when
it defeated the Wildcats 173-125. By contrast, Cal
has struggled against these teams. It defeated Ari
zona 165-134, but fell to USC 147-153.
In the meet, the Cardinal will look to the trio of
senior Julia Smit, senior Elaine Breeden and jun
ior Kate Dwelley to provide the firepower neces
sary to overcome Cal. Smit is the world record
holder in both the 200- and 400-meter individual

GAME NOTES: No. 4 Stanford closes out its regular season
against its rival, No. 5 Cal, in the Big Meet this Saturday.
The Cardinal is looking to finish the regular season un
defeated for the third time in four years. Despite beating
Cal in last year's Big Meet, the Cardinal fell to Cal in
Pac-10s and nationals, so Stanford is out for redemption.

medley, and she will try to claim victo
ry in both events for the Cardinal. She
also currently holds the top times in
the nation at both distances.
After outdueling USC's Katinka
Hosszu, a Hungarian Olympian, in
the 200-yard butterfly, Breeden will
face another stiff challenge this
weekend from Cal's Amanda Sims.
Breeden is the defending NCAA
champion in the 200 fly while Sims
won last year's 100 fly championship;
they will clash in both events this
weekend.
This weekend, it will be Dwelley's
turn to take on an Olympic medalist.
Cal's Sara Isakovic took home a sil
ver medal from the Olympics in the
200-meter freestyle while competing
for Slovenia. She currently holds the
second-best time in the nation in the
200-yard free. Dwelley currently
leads the Cardinal in the 100 and 200
free, although her season best of 1
minute, 45.32 seconds in the 200 lags
behind Isakovic's season best of

1:44.95.
Indeed, the short freestyle dis
tances (50,100 and 200 yards) are all
expected to be very closely contested.
In addition to Dwelley, sophomores
Betsy Webb and Sam Woodward will
lead the Cardinal.
"There's obviously going to be
heightened tension because they're
our rival," Woodward said. "It'll be a
really good warm-up meet for the
postseason."
"Cal's always a tough competitor,"
Maurer said. "On paper, I think it's
going to come down to four points
and we lose both relays."
After the Big Meet, Stanford will
only have its two postseason meets re
maining. While the Card may appear
to be the favorite, especially if it is able
to defeat Cal, Maurer does not share
that view.
"Cal is the NCAA champion, Ari
zona was third last year and we were
fourth," she said. "They are the de
fending champion and they were

ahead of us both last year and at
NCAAs. I think we are underdogs,
but we're hungry."
With a win on Saturday, Stanford
would build momentum for the post
season, as well as cement a third unde
feated dual meet season in the past
four years. Current Cardinal seniors
have only lost one dual meet in their
entire careers on the Farm.
"It's definitely a linear progres
sion, from Cal to Pac-lOs to NCAAs,"
Woodward said. "I'm looking to see
where I'm at and then make adjust
ments from there."
"We are totally committed to the
good of the group, and individual
goals are only relevant in terms of
how many points we can put on the
board," Maurer added.
Stanford will take on the Golden
Bears this Saturday at 1 p.m. at Avery
Aquatics Center.
