# Landry is the Fields of Dreams

### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
After my column last week
regarding the value of
seniors in college basket
ball, I thought it would
only be fitting to discuss
one of our own.
Ladies and gentlemen, Landry
Fields is the future.
After a junior season in which he
quietly led the Card in rebounding and
shot nearly 50 percent from the floor,
Fields has now emerged from the shad
ow of last year's seniors, and has turned
his final campaign into one of the best
in Stanford history.

With the loss of guards Mitch John
son, Anthony Goods and "Downtown"
Kenny Brown, as well as forward
Lawrence Hill, we Stanford fans were
less than optimistic regarding the for
tunes of this year's squad. By now, all of
you have heard that Stanford was
"picked to finish last in the Pac-10" and
that this is simply a "rebuilding year"
for a team "deprived of talent."
Landry couldn't have cared less.

The six-foot-seven star forward has
emerged as the frontrunner for Pac-10
Player of the Year and is having as
good of a year as anyone in the nation.
He may not look or act like the proto
typical superstar, but for the relatively
little hype that he receives, Fields has a
very good shot at being a solid NBA
player.

This season, Fields is leading the
Cardinal in virtually every statistical
category except for assists, where he
ranks a measly second. He's tied for
fourth in the nation in points per game
with 23, and accounts for more than a
third of the Cardinal's offensive output
on any given night.

Right now you're saying, "That's
tight and all, but he plays in the dregs of
the NCAA, for a team starting several
mediocre-at-best players, for a school
that has quickly abandoned whatever
basketball culture it once had and in an
era where players in their 20s are con
sidered old on draft day."
And you'd be partially right. Fields,
with productive but streaky help from
sophomore guard Jeremy Green, is the
only reason that Stanford, who cur
rently sits at the bottom of the Pac-10,
is just three games back of first place in
the conference. He's relied on more
than any one player in recent Cardinal
history and his numbers have un
doubtedly been inflated as a result. It
also may help that the Pac-10 is having
its worst collective season of all time
and will be extremely fortunate if they
put two teams in the Big Dance. Lastly,
his numbers became relevant just last
year, and NBA teams will be highly
skeptical over whether this year's sta
tistics are a legitimate reflection of his
talent, or a one-year fluke as a product
of situation.

However, Fields is doing serious
work with alarming efficiency. Those
23 points don't come from jacking
up O.J. Mayo 35-footers Fields is
shooting an insane 48 percent from
the floor. However, when need be,
he can also step back and hit the
three, with 23 makes from deep on
the year. With limited assistance
from teammates, Landry has devel
oped a superb one-on-one game and
an ability to handle a double team,
and uses his athleticism to get to the
rim at ease. (Questioning his athleti
cism? You Tube his dunk over NBA
center Adonal Foyle during an off
season game and then come talk to
me). Yes, his jump shot is undeniably
flat, but you can't complain about a
guy that is nailing nearly half of his
attempts. Think his shot won't work
at the next level? Meet my friend
Shawn Marion.

Stanford's lack of size has called for
him to play the role of an undersized
power forward. Although this has put
him at a defensive disadvantage sever
al times this season, it has only expand
ed his skill set. He averages 8.8 re
bounds per game as a natural small for
ward. In addition, Fields leads Stanford
in both blocks and steals, which speaks
wonders about his improvements as
both a help and post defender. His
prowess on offense and his dramatic
improvements on the defensive end
have allowed him to expand his versa
tility and play nearly every position on
the floor.

ESPN.com still lists him as a late sec
ond-round to undrafted prospect, but
come April, don't be surprised if his
name is called well before this current
projection. When Stanford was playing
