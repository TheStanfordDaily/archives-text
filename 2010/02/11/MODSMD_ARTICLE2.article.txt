# Munger finds money error
## Residence staff troubled by discrepancies with credit union 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Ninety cents isn't much money in
the scheme of a Stanford dorm budg
et â€” but when a Munger treasurer
noticed a discrepancy of that amount
during her recent review of the resi
dence's banking records, she began to
worry.

An Nguyen, a treasurer and com
munity assistant in the Munger grad
uate residence, saw that three checks
written fall quarter from the Munger
Graduate Residence's joint account
with the Stanford Federal Credit
Union (SFCU) were deposited in
payees' accounts in slightly lower
amounts than those for which the
checks were written 90 cents short,
in total.

Though the difference is small, it
has Munger staff worried about
banking with the credit union, where
173 student-related groups, including
50 residences, do business.
"If you add it up, it can grow
quickly," said Nguyen, a mechanical

engineering and medical school grad
uate student.
Nguyen expressed concern that
the problem could affect other stu
dent groups who handle finances
through SFCU, especially if they are
less diligent about their bookkeeping.
"Most groups just toss all their
receipts into a box," she claimed.
According to Nguyen, the three
checks were each written from
Munger's account to reimburse other
Munger community assistants and
were deposited at banks between
Dec. 2 and Dec. 16,2009.
Two of the check amounts were
rounded down to the nearest dollar
upon deposit, and the third was debit
ed as 10 cents less than the written
amount.
SFCU's chief operating officer,
Sam Tuohey, insisted that the deposit
ing banks, not SFCU, were responsi
ble for the transaction discrepancies.
Fie noted that SFCU is "unable to
tell" which banks received the checks.
Tuohey also said the checks would
have passed through several institu

tions before deposit, further compli
cating the process of finding those 90
cents.

Nguyen said she received conflict
ing answers from SFCU when she
tried to track down the source of the
error.

"[SFCU] talked like they knew
what they were saying, and then
called me back and retracted their
statements," she said.
Tuohey said the SFCU staff with
whom the Munger staff member
spoke may not have been clear on the
situation.

Because the three checks were
deposited at three different banks,
Nguysen said she considers it unlike
ly that the problem stems from the
depositing banks. Another Munger
treasurer, Jeff Peterson, seconded the
difficulty in locating the source of the
discrepancy.
"Without knowing all the steps
that happen between the deposit of a

Munger treasurers found small discrepancies in transaction values for three checks written in fall quarter from the residence's
account with Stanford Federal Credit Union (SFCU). SFCU manages accounts for 173 student-related groups.
