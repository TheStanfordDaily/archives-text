# Munger finds money error
## Residence staff troubled by discrepancies with credit union 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Ninety cents isn't much money in
the scheme of a Stanford dorm budg
et — but when a Munger treasurer
noticed a discrepancy of that amount
during her recent review of the resi
dence's banking records, she began to
worry.

An Nguyen, a treasurer and com
munity assistant in the Munger grad
uate residence, saw that three checks
written fall quarter from the Munger
Graduate Residence's joint account
with the Stanford Federal Credit
Union (SFCU) were deposited in
payees' accounts in slightly lower
amounts than those for which the
checks were written 90 cents short,
in total.

Though the difference is small, it
has Munger staff worried about
banking with the credit union, where
173 student-related groups, including
50 residences, do business.
"If you add it up, it can grow
quickly," said Nguyen, a mechanical

engineering and medical school grad
uate student.
Nguyen expressed concern that
the problem could affect other stu
dent groups who handle finances
through SFCU, especially if they are
less diligent about their bookkeeping.
"Most groups just toss all their
receipts into a box," she claimed.
According to Nguyen, the three
checks were each written from
Munger's account to reimburse other
Munger community assistants and
were deposited at banks between
Dec. 2 and Dec. 16,2009.
Two of the check amounts were
rounded down to the nearest dollar
upon deposit, and the third was debit
ed as 10 cents less than the written
amount.
SFCU's chief operating officer,
Sam Tuohey, insisted that the deposit
ing banks, not SFCU, were responsi
ble for the transaction discrepancies.
Fie noted that SFCU is "unable to
tell" which banks received the checks.
Tuohey also said the checks would
have passed through several institu

tions before deposit, further compli
cating the process of finding those 90
cents.

Nguyen said she received conflict
ing answers from SFCU when she
tried to track down the source of the
error.

"[SFCU] talked like they knew
what they were saying, and then
called me back and retracted their
statements," she said.
Tuohey said the SFCU staff with
whom the Munger staff member
spoke may not have been clear on the
situation.

Because the three checks were
deposited at three different banks,
Nguysen said she considers it unlike
ly that the problem stems from the
depositing banks. Another Munger
treasurer, Jeff Peterson, seconded the
difficulty in locating the source of the
discrepancy.
"Without knowing all the steps
that happen between the deposit of a

check and the transfer of funds, it's
really difficult to nail down what
could have gone wrong," Peterson
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Because of the accounting prob
lems, Munger has switched to Pay Pal
to route reimbursements electroni
cally. Peterson hopes an electronic
payment system will "reduce the risk
of bank errors in the future."
According to Tuohey, SFCU is set
to meet Thursday with Munger staff
and other involved parties to address
the problem.
Laurette Beeson, assistant dean
for graduate life, wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily that she does not have
"any reason to believe there is a sys
tematic problem that affects other
residences."
Michael Albada 'll, Haus
Mitteleuropa's financial manager,
also handles his residence's finances
through an account at SFCU. He
explained that he keeps his own
records and only checks the amounts
with SFCU at the beginning and end
of each quarter.
"If there were a small deviation, I
would probably find it, but it might
be tricky," Albada said.
"Even though it's a small amount,
I think it's important that people
remain careful," he added. "It's area-

sonable issue, and it happened close
to home."
Despite the discrepancy and its
implications for other groups,
Peterson doesn't think much will
change overall in future student
group-SFCU relations. He said
Munger staff on their own have
begun limiting their use of SFCU
checks and are considering switching
to a different bank.
"A good treasurer should be bal
ancing the budget and accounting for
credits and debits anyway," Peterson
said. "As long as the treasurers do
their jobs, I don't foresee any major
changes."

"However, if SFCU continues to
be a source of problems, then we may
push harder for change," he added.
