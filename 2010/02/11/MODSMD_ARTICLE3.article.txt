## Sachs mixes laughs, human rights 
### CAITY MONROE 
After surviving months of solitary confinement, los
ing an arm in a car bombing and fighting against one of
the most oppressive regimes in recent history, former
South African Constitutional Court Justice Albie Sachs
has sufficient cause for a less-than-optimistic disposi
tion.

Yet in a lecture he gave Wednesday as part of the
Stanford Center on Democracy, Development and
Rule of Law's new Program on Human Rights, he
proved that his optimism and sense of humor have
remained intact throughout his lifelong battle against
apartheid in South Africa.
Although his 15 years as a judge on the
Constitutional Court of South Africa have been
marked by socially progressive decisions, his lecture
"Does the Law Have a Sense of Humor?" focused
mainly on his lifelong advocacy for the power of
humor.
Addressing a crowd of students, faculty and commu
nity members in the Bechtel Conference Center, Sachs
relayed anecdotes on using humor to combat the dark
er times in his life.
He recounted a moment in 1988 when he awoke in
a hospital, learned that he had been the target of a car
bomb and that his arm was in "lamentable condition"
and reacted by telling himself a joke.
"Humor was a big part of [the anti-apartheid
activists'] struggle," he said. "We needed it to cope."
Sachs' reliance on and admiration for humor was a
prevailing theme throughout his lecture. He cited a
court case in which he supported the "Laugh it Off" T
shirt company, which sold shirts displaying an altered
version of a South African Brewery's logo and criti
cized their racist labor policies.
The former justice defended the use of humor, say
ing, "Laughter was being used to resist ideological
hegemony and advancing human dignity."
Sachs stressed that his message was pertinent not
just to South Africa, but to the global community as
well.
"One thing that really worries me about the inter
national human rights movement is that it's so damn
serious," he said. "It's pretty gloomy."

"A society that takes itself too seriously risks bot
tling up its tensions," he added.
Sachs started his involvement in the anti-apartheid
movement as a 17-year-old in South Africa and spent
much of his life defending those charged under racist
statues and discriminatory security laws. He was
appointed to South Africa's Constitutional Court in

1994 by Nelson Mandela and retired in October 2009.
Sachs told The Daily that his position as a white
male gave him a special role in demonstrating that the
anti-apartheid effort was more than just about race.
"It was a struggle of principals and values ... a just

he said.
Those in attendance reacted to
the message and to Sachs him
self very favorably.
"I just wanted to see him," said
international policy masters stu
dent Sandile Hlatshwayo, who
came to hear about Sachs and his
life story. "It's a once in lifetime
experience to be around great
ness."

of interest for South Africa and
Africa in general.
"I had heard he was part of the
anti-apartheid movement and
wanted to see him," he said. "I was
not disappointed he's quite a
character."
Mia Newman 'l2, agreed that it
was an inspirational talk, and one
that carried a very necessary, yet
often overlooked, message.
"It's easy for [the human rights
community] to take ourselves too
seriously and forget that we're
fighting for humanity," she said.
"And the best part of humanity is
joy and laughter ... it's important
to keep that in perspective."
