# STUDENT LIFE
## Students weigh in on Google's newest "Buzz" Opinions remain mixed on newly released social networking tool 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
For Stanford users of the Ã¼biquitous Gmail,
there's a new buzzword in town.

Google, the Mountain View-based search

engine giant founded by two Stanford stu
dents, on Tuesday fixed its eyes on breaking
into the social networking scene with its
newest feature: Buzz, which the company bills
as "a new way to start conversations" in Gmail
by sharing status updates, photos, videos and
content from other Web sites like Twitter and
Flickr.

Buzz, which now appears in Gmail users'
left-hand menu, was made accessible to all
users this week.

"Increasingly, it's becoming hard
er and harder to make sense and find
the signal in the noise," said Bradley
Horowitz, Google's vice president of prod
uct management, at a press conference
Tuesday announcing the new application.
At Stanford, RJ Walsh 'll, a resident
computer consultant (RCC) in Cedro, said he
was "a little disappointed" with Google's

newest product.
"It's still kind of early to tell,
but at this point, it's really just
adding a social network to the list
of networks I'm already on," he
said. "We'll have to wait and see if
it adds any real value for me in the
future. As of right now, it's one
more thing to add to the equa
tion."
Conspicuously missing are
updates from Facebook, Google's
top competitor in the social net
working field, thus calling into
question how successful the Gmail
feed will be, as Facebook boasts 400
million members worldwide.
"As far as offering you features,
they didn't really do anything that
Facebook and Twitter haven't
already done," Walsh said.
Rob Balian 'll, the RCC in
Jerry, began using Buzz on
Wednesday. He said he finds Buzz
different because Web sites such as
Facebook and Twitter require the
"incremental work" of finding
friends.
"On Facebook, there are the 10
to 20 percent of friends that you
actually talk to, and the rest are ran
dom people that you don't really
care what they post," Balian said.
Buzz sends posts directly to the
user's inbox and recommends posts
from people outside of one's
Internet social circle. A mobile ver
sion is also available.
Balian said that Buzz is easy
because it sends posts directly to
one's inbox, and that Google has
done "a pretty good job" knowing
who he will care about.
"All my friends are already on
[Buzz]," he said. "I follow people
that I care about and chat with the
most, and they're already posting
stuff."
He said he anticipates that Buzz
will play a large role for users look
ing to use a social network solely
for tightly-knit groups.
"It's a nice thing for your very
close social network, when you're
not really looking to expand your
social network, but looking to keep
in touch with what you've already
got," Balian added.
Walsh agreed that the auto-fol
low feature is the best way for Buzz

to separate itself from current
social networking sites.
"It figures out your social net
work for you," he said. "This com
bats the initial 'building a social net
work' issue by adding people in
you don't frustrate users who don't
want to go through the process of
finding friends over and over
again."

Although disappointed, Walsh
said to take initial feelings "with a
grain of salt." Both he and Balian
agreed that new features would
probably help better define Buzz
and establish its long-term presence
in social networking.
