## GSC revamps special fees, group funding New internal auditor is hired for student group financial regulation 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wednesday's Graduate Student Council (GSC)
meeting ran the gamut of issues, from special fees
policy to campaign spending caps for ASSU exec
utive races to the appointment of an internal audi
tor for student group finances.

Special Fees and Funding Abuse
In an effort to increase fiscal responsibility in
student groups, the council approved $5OO to pay a
new internal auditor, Julia Guo, to investigate pos
sible abuse of funds by student groups. She will
work at a rate of $lOO per investigation, and will be
hired on a case-by-case basis.
Following concern over record numbers of stu
dents requesting special fees refunds, council
members voted unanimously to strike the current
joint bylaw that says the SUID numbers of stu
dents requesting special fee refunds may be
released. The council plans to create an alternate
system, possibly allowing the release of a list of
students' names instead.
Additionally, two bills relating to special fees
refund rates were approved at the meeting. The
first, the refund bill, shortens the refund request
period from three to two weeks and could allow
the ASSU to respond faster to budget changes.
The second, the buffer bill, moves to try spend
ing some of the money currently in the refund
buffer funds in response to some special fees
groups' nervousness about high refund rates.
The funding committee also extended the
deadline for response from a group president or
CFO suspected of funding misuse from 48 hours to
one week.
ASSU Executive Update
ASSU President David Gobaud, a co-terminal
student in computer science, called Tuesday's
changes to Cardinal Care by the University "phe
nomenal."
Starting Sept. 1, Cardinal Care, an optional
health insurance plan for Stanford students, will
decrease four percent in cost and require that
summer months be included in a buyer's plan; it
will also cover transgender surgery. The University
also offered a dependent health care plan on
Tuesday, the first of its kind since 2006.
"[lt's] the best news of the year," Gobaud said.
Gobaud also announced a goal of capping
spending in races for ASSU executive positions.
The ASSU have developed two options: a limit of
$2,000 where the candidate can still
use $750 from public financing, or
an expansion of public financing to
$l,OOO for each candidate with a
total cap of $2,500, combined with
an increase of required petition sig
natures from 200 to 400.

Partially in response to a lack of
precedent, the council established
and unanimously approved a
process for the replacement of the
ASSU vice president in the event
that the current vice president
vacates for any reason, allowing the
president to make an appointment
subject to legislative approval.

The State of the Association is
slated for Feb. 18.
The executives have also been
interviewing applicants for the Haiti
relief "czar" position, which they
said would pay $5OO for the year and
be responsible for coordination of
Stanford fundraising for future dis
asters, too.

Stanford Student Enterprises board
of directors will take place over the
next few weeks, and applications for

Nominations Committee will go live
in the next few days.

The GSC also announced that
Stanford will not be renewing its
membership with the National
Association of Graduate-
Professional Students (NAGPS).
"This group has a bad reputation
in [Washington] D.C.," said GSC
financial officer Ryan Peacock. The
council decided the $5OO member
ship costs would be better spent
sending individual Stanford repre
sentatives to lobby in the capital.
The GSC also approved funding
at Wednesday's meeting for events
sponsored by the Hindu Students
Association, the Persian Students
Association, Atheists, Humanists,
and Agnostics and the Organization
of International Health.
