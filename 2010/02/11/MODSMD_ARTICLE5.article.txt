## GSC revamps special fees, group funding New internal auditor is hired for student group financial regulation 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Wednesday's Graduate Student Council (GSC)
meeting ran the gamut of issues, from special fees
policy to campaign spending caps for ASSU exec
utive races to the appointment of an internal audi

Special Fees and Funding Abuse
In an effort to increase fiscal responsibility in
student groups, the council approved $5OO to pay a
new internal auditor, Julia Guo, to investigate pos

refund rates were approved at the meeting. The
first, the refund bill, shortens the refund request
period from three to two weeks and could allow

buffer funds in response to some special fees
groups' nervousness about high refund rates.
The funding committee also extended the
deadline for response from a group president or
CFO suspected of funding misuse from 48 hours to
one week.
ASSU Executive Update
ASSU President David Gobaud, a co-terminal
student in computer science, called Tuesday's
changes to Cardinal Care by the University "phe
nomenal."
Starting Sept. 1, Cardinal Care, an optional
health insurance plan for Stanford students, will
decrease four percent in cost and require that
summer months be included in a buyer's plan; it
will also cover transgender surgery. The University
also offered a dependent health care plan on
Tuesday, the first of its kind since 2006.
"[lt's] the best news of the year," Gobaud said.
Gobaud also announced a goal of capping
spending in races for ASSU executive positions.
The ASSU have developed two options: a limit of
