## SO THIS IS THE NEW YEAR WITH CHINESE NEW YEAR RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, STUDENTS REFLECT ON FOREIGN NEW YEAR EXPERIENCES 
### FEDERICO DE LA BALZE 
Fireworks, dinners and parties.That's essentially
New Year's Eve for most Stanford students
and for most of the globalized world.
Ushering in the New Year with a bang isn't just an
American tradition. In major cities around the world
from Hong Kong to Dubai, the New Year consists of
extensive displays of fireworks and classy partying.
Many international students at the Farm celebrated the
New Year overseas.
"In Hong Kong, you have a huge skyline that just
lights on fire," said Masato Kuok 'l3. "You have fire
works on the harbor and on buildings," he said. "The
most popular is the IFC building where the fireworks go
from bottom to top in the countdown. I watched the
countdown on the 31st and partied [on] the rooftop of a
building next to IFC."
Dubai, despite having experienced a tough year
financially, welcomed the New Year in style.
"New Year in Dubai was amazing!" said Julie
Saffarian 'l3. "Dubai is pretty intense. They try and
make it really big. Everything is big there. The fireworks
were really amazing."
However, not everyone celebrates New Year's Eve
in the same way or even at the same time. Cultural dif
ferences, quirky traditions and national realities color
the celebration and reinforce national identities around
the world.
Puerto Rico offers a rich example of how traditional
celebration can coexist with the western ritual of party
and fireworks.
"We've been Americanized in many ways," said Sara
Rodriguez 'l3. "For example, with the whole, 'Oh let's

all kiss and hug at midnight.' There are also fireworks
and parties."
Whereas celebrations on Dec. 31 are homogenous
with the rest of the global world, Puerto Rico has anoth
er unique holiday in the summer to mark the passage of
time.
"We do crazier stuff for other occasions," she added.
"On San Juan Day, people throw themselves backward
in a body of water seven times to have good luck for the
rest of the year."
Nishant Parekh 'l3, a native of Mumbai, declaimed
some of the realities of life in India and the dangers of
Mumbai during the New Year.
"It's so easy to get away from the cops in India that
there is much drunk driving," Parekh said. "People pret
ty much pay the cops a few dollars and get away with it.
When they ask for your license, you slip a bill under the
license and you can go."
Puerto Rico also has some New Year's troublemakers.
"A negative thing about New Year's in Puerto Rico
is that some idiots shoot into the air and bullets come
down crashing from the sky," Rodriguez said.
"In the metropolitan areas, we tend to stay indoors
because we don't want bullets crashing on our heads,"
she added in a joking manner. "It really isn't that bad
though."
In Bangladesh, according to Rajendra Kumar 'lO,
Dec. 31 has little relevance and is not widely celebrated.
"Most people in Bangladesh really don't care about
the 31st of December," Kumar said. "New Year is a very
western thing. Our New Year is on April 14. Bangladesh
in that way is insulated from the global culture."
Now, a little more than a month after we've kissed
away 2009, a different New Year is upon us: Chinese
New Year, meaning a whole series of cultural celebra
tions.
In Taiwan, as in China, the New Year is traditionally

celebrated sometime between January and February,
depending on the year.
"Since the Lunar Chinese New Year is in February,
celebrating New Year on New Year's Eve is more of a
thing for young people," said Vincent Chen 'lO, who
spent Dec. 31 in Taipei. "Most of the Taiwanese still con
sider the Lunar New Year to be the official New Year."
The Stanford community is not insulated from the
local cultures of its students and faculty. This coming
Sunday, several groups on campus are co-hosting the
"Stanford Chinese New Year Party."
No, it's not your usual New Year party there will
be no fireworks, no drinks, no frenzied parties. It is,
instead, a popular cultural event that year after year
attracts over 700 people from Stanford and the Bay
Area.
"It's our chance to show the Stanford community

what Chinese culture is about," said Yuankai Ge, a grad
uate student in electrical engineering and co-president
of the Association of Chinese Students and Scholars at
Stanford (ACSSS), one of the student groups organiz
ing the event. "This year, we have 12 different perform
ances, including drama, dancing and wushu."
Celebrations matter. They reflect a sense of identity
and remind us that the struggle to compromise the glob
al and the local is at our doorstep even here at Stanford.
"Last week I attended a meeting with all the student
association leaders," Ge added. "There are about 40
countries or regions represented and they were all plan
ning their own holidays. It's great, people can then
explore other cultures and see [Stanford] as a global vil
lage. This is what we hope."
