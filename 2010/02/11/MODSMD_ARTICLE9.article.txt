## EDITORIAL Nostalia fuels Palin's rhetoric 
### 
Last week, amid fervent chants of "USA!
USA!," Sarah Palin trumpeted Ameri
ca's position as "that shining city on a
hill" to the National Tea Party Convention,
while repeatedly wishing the late Ronald Rea
gan the man behind this famous quote a
happy birthday. One of the saddest aspects of
Palin's speech was the feeling that, for her and
her supporters, America today is the same
America as when Reagan was elected almost
30 years ago.
This sort of rhetoric from Palin is not new.
Roger Cohen wrote a 2008 column in the New
York Times noting Palin's constant proclama
tions of American exceptionalism and derid
ing her beliefs as "the angry refuge of the
America that wants to deny the real state of
the world." In the Tea Party movement, and
the "shining city" rhetoric of Palin, the Edito
rial Board sees the epitome of what Cohen de
scribes as an inertial unwillingness to accept
the challenges facing continued American su
premacy, as well as a nostalgia for an Ameri
can past that did not ever really exist.
The idea that America is the greatest na
tion on Earth arose out of the post-World War
II reality that America alone had escaped the
war without suffering massive social devasta
tion. The 1950s saw America further its pros
perity through unprecedented economic and
consumer growth. Truthfully, America never
had it so good. Yet despite the challenges that
America faces today and the continued
success of economic rivals abroad a great
many Americans today have turned nostalgia
for the past into a certified ideological world
view founded on a yearning to return to, in the
words of "Mad Men" character Don Draper,
"a place where we ache to go again," namely
the idealized America of a time long ago.
In the 1980s, President Reagan capitalized
on nostalgia by proclaiming that it was "morn
ing in America" once again, that America had
shrugged off the problems of the '6os and '7os

and was back on the up and up. Today, much of
the Tea Party movement, and even main
stream conservatism, is driven by nostalgia for
the nostalgia of the Reagan era. As Palin told
her supporters, Reagan's "spirit lives on" in
the political consciousness of the present. To
many conservatives today, Reagan represents
the ultimate vindication of their ideologies
he cut taxes, boosted the economy and made
government smaller. That is his legacy, accord
ing to his nostalgic, sentimental disciples.
But unfortunately, the conservative vener
ation of Reagan and his massive tax cuts are
based more on a glamorized vision of the past
than on straight statistical facts. Contrary to
popular belief, the 1980s saw the slowest eco
nomic growth in America of any decade since
World War 11, while middle-class wages stag
nated and poverty rates rose. Furthermore,
Reagan did not pay for his tax cuts because he
did not decrease spending. As a result, the na
tional debt nearly tripled under his watch.
Yet, with Reagan occupying a high
pedestal in many hearts and minds, it comes as
no surprise that there is a long line of politi
cians trying to copy his ideas. In some cases,
living up to Reagan's legacy even trumps fiscal
responsibility Tea Party hero Jim DeMint's
(R-SC) tax cut proposal would cost $3.5 tril
lion, more than three times the stimulus bill.
Meanwhile, Palin and the Tea Party move
ment appear to remain firm in their belief that
America fundamentally excels above all other
nations, despite United Nations rankings that
show America ranks 33rd in the world in
terms of infant mortality rates and 37th in
health care.
The longer Americans continue to remain
fixed on the past, especially the idealized past,
the more difficult it will be to address the
major challenges of the present in ways that
do not make things worse. History cannot
move backward; it can only stagnate or
progress.
