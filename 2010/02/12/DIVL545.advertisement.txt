Stanford Continuing Studies Presents
Hal Buell: Defining Moments in Photographic History
There are dozens, perhaps hundreds, of great
photographs of historic events that occupy
special places in our collective memory. Some
of them are so familiar that they come to
mind with the briefest description—"Marines
raising the flag on Iwo Jima" — while others
are harder to describe, but are no less indelibly
burned into our memories, such as Eddie
Adams Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of
General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a
Viet Cong officer.
Monday, February 15
7:30 pm
Annenberg Auditorium
Cummings Art Building
FREE; Open to the public
*
Join us this President's Day with a
presentation by Hal Buell, who will draw on
his forty-year career in photojournalism to
tell the stories behind these photos, many of
which became "defining moments" and are
entries in a kind of "History's Notebook."
Buell will tell how these pictures were made
(often with video recollections by the
photographer) and discuss world reaction to
their publication. More often than not, the
stories behind the photos are as compelling
as the pictures themselves.
