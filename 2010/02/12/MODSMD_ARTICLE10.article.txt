## A 						NEW NASA OBAMA'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SHIFTS NASA'S FOCUS 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Early Monday morning, the
space shuttle Endeavor lit
up the heavens as it
climbed toward the sky, en
route to the International
Space Station for its second-to-last
flight. Endeavor and Atlantis each
have one more mission; Discovery
has two. By October, the shuttle will
never fly again.

With the shuttle out of commis
sion, the U.S. will not have a vehicle
to launch humans into space. A
replacement dubbed "Constellation"
was introduced in 2004, but quickly
encountered funding shortages; its
maiden voyage was delayed beyond
2014. President Obama's NASA
budget proposal for 2011 scraps the
program, instead redirecting billions
of dollars to engine research, robot
ics and commercial space contracts.
"It's the kind of thing that I
wanted to see happen years ago, but
[NASA] went in a different direc
tion," said Scott Hubbard, professor
of aeronautics and astronautics. "I
think NASA is returning to its roots
in terms of building advanced
work."

With the space shuttle's retire
ment and the Constellation pro
gram's cancellation, Hubbard says
shifting NASA from a launch sys
tem developer to a launch system
purchaser will free up funding to
focus on cutting edge technologies.
His lab is focusing on astrobiology,
concentrating on technologies for
obtaining and returning samples
from Mars to Earth.

NASA has the budget for "build
ing one-of-a-kind things that are not
commercially viable at all,"

Hubbard said.
With the budget increase, he
hopes some dollars will return to
Stanford.
Annual NASA research spend
ing at Stanford peaked at $98,383
during fiscal year 2004. It has steadi
ly declined, reaching $24,850 in
2009.
"It doesn't play near as big a part
for Stanford as it used to," said
Barbara Cole, director of the Office
of Sponsored Research.
Since the budget hasn't been
finalized and no grant proposals
have been written, "it's too soon to
tell just how it's going to impact us
in what area," Cole said.
Alonso predicts Stanford robot
ics, rocket research, and aerospace
design will see NASA funding in the
near future.

"Putting people in space, and try
ing to either colonize or visit other
planets or the moon or Mars it's
motivated by the exploration drive
that humans have had from discov
ering new countries or new conti
nents to now discovering other
worlds," said Juan Alonso, professor
of aeronautics and aerospace.

Alonso's lab focuses on aero
space systems, developing design
models for hypersonic aircraft, effi
cient engine technologies and pas
senger load that one day could form
the basis for orbital aircraft.

The budget will "make NASA
more like what it should be, the
pointy end of the spear, out there
doing the kinds of things that
nobody else would do, and leaving
the more routine launch services to
the commercial sector," Hubbard
said.

"The traditional role of govern
ment is to invest in things that aren't

ready for commercial business, and
that's what NASA's going to be
doing," Hubbard said. 'And buy
those things that the commercial
sector is producing as a service."
"There are a lot of analogies to
the early days of aviation,"
Hubbard said. "I always use the
analogy to 1916-1920, when the
government offered or said they
would buy mail services. This is
where Bill Boeing got his start, this
is where the Loughead brothers,
which became Lockheed, got going.
These early mail routes that got
purchased by the government
moved aviation from just barn
storming drill figures to a real, com
mercially viable, routine business. I
think we're in a transition mode for
launch services for NASA in the
same way, now in the 21st century,
and 1 think that's exactly the right
thing to do."

Before suborbital tourism
emerged, for years companies inde
pendently developed and built rock
ets and satellites. Hubbard said

more money is spent in the com
mercial space industry today than in
the government sector. As a result,
he predicts that five years from now,
commercial providers will transport
cargo to the International Space
Station on behalf of NASA.

And over the next two decades,
Hubbard anticipates even greater
international collaboration on space
exploration. He expects robots will
return surface samples from Mars
and Titan, scientists will find evi
dence of more Earthlike planets
nearby and satellites will capture a
clear picture of climate change on
Earth. In the meantime, he supports
a "flexible path," where human
exploration gradually escapes

Earth's orbit to visit an asteroid,
which is less expensive than landing
on the moon.

In twenty years, he expects
humans will almost be ready for a
trip to Mars.
"The moon might be a stepping
stone maybe we partner with the
Chinese or other nations," Hubbard
said. "But Mars is the human target
that I think is the most interesting."
Until then, a quick jaunt to space
is available for $200,000 from Virgin
Galactic. By the time astronauts are
preparing to leave for Mars, he
expects daily launches of suborbital
and orbital commercial spacecraft,
some en route to private orbiting
space stations both for research and
tourism.

"We'll have set up some kind of,
instead of air traffic management,
space traffic management,"
Hubbard said.

Alonso expects the gap in
American spaceflight to be more
significant. He predicts the private

sector will catch up to NASA's cur
rent spaceflight capabilities given
enough investment and time, but
doubts it will happen more quickly
than if the Constellation Program
were continued. With budget short
falls, Alonso expected it would be
delayed to 2015 or 2016, but doesn't
expect commercial companies to
develop human-rated orbital space
craft for six to ten years.
But is a ten-year hiatus from
human space travel a problem?
"Probably not," Alonso said.

He cautions that if NASA tem
porarily avoids direct involvement
in human spaceflight, the "greater
goal" human exploration of the
solar system could slide to the
backburner.

On the other hand, he says, a lot
of space exploration can be accom
plished without humans. Robotic
exploration has come a long way,

and if it improves significantly we
may be able to do many more things
that were reserved to astronauts with
robots.
"So my opinion is that you need a
balanced approach between the two.
And at the moment, the plans seem
to sort of focus on robotic explo
ration and developing technologies
that may one day enable human
exploration," Alonso said.
In his view, establishing a lunar
base is a good first step for humans.
"It's closer to Earth such that
humans can learn how to live in a dif
ferent planet," Alonso said. "It's far
enough to learn how to live in a dif
ferent planet, but its close enough in
case we don't learn very quickly,
stumble and fall a few times, and
need to recover gracefully."

Alonso agrees with Hubbard that
the budget will have a positive impact
on research at universities and pri
vate companies, because work that
was going into a rocket will now pro
ceed to develop more advanced tech
nology.
But there is an earthly catch.
"It's an expensive proposition, all
of this space exploration," Alonso
said. "And it's actually hard to justify
some of these efforts when the nation
is embroiled in economic crisis and
budget deficit and various other
things that more directly impact peo
ple who live here on Earth."
But regardless of the price tag,
Hubbard and Alonso are excited for
the Obama budget potential benefits
to aerospace.
"With the shift back to technolo
gy, I think that you're going to see a
lot more opportunities," Hubbard
said.
