## EDITORIAL Wellness Week works, but more can be done 
### 
Stanford has been "Finding Balance and
Happiness" this week during the ASSU
Wellness Week 2010 campaign. Stan
ford students enjoyed a variety of study
breaks, lectures and free yoga between
midterms, internship applications and spring
break planning. This group collaboration
orchestrated by various groups ranging from
the Bridge Peer Counseling Center to
STAMP (Stanford Theater Activist Mobi
lization Project) really helped to bring
some needed stress relief to campus at a
busy time in the quarter. While these oppor
tunities were definitely welcomed, a broader
campaign is necessary to affect greater Well
ness promotion on campus throughout the
year. The Editorial Board applauds the
ASSU for putting Wellness Week on, but
would urge a re-evaluation of the Week's
structure.
One of the logistical difficulties of the
Week's plan is that it requires students to
actively seek out the events. Integrating
dorm staff and programming into the plan
ning of the events could provide additional
access to students who may not want or be
able to attend events across campus. Flyer
ing dorms can provide a laugh here and
there, but involving dorms in the effort
would amplify the results of the week as well
as broaden the scope of students participat
ing in such activities.
The Week allows student engagement
with the various organizations that helped
put the activities together, but does not do
enough to educate and orient students to

the facilities available. Creating a safe space
in the Bridge is definitely an instance where
students could enter a space that may have
a negative stereotype on campus and famil
iarize themselves with the center's re
sources. Wellness Week has highlighted the
lack of general education on the psycholog
ical counseling services and support groups
available at Stanford. Yes, it is the burden of
the student to seek out these services and
they are voluntary, but the negative conno
tation of "counseling" or stereotype of seek
ing help must be combated if these centers
are truly going to benefit the campus. The
blame for under-use of facilities cannot be
the burden of only the students undergoing
mental duress an outreach effort to en
dorse and mitigate negative images of such
centers would truly serve the student popu
lation well.
One dose of wellness is a start, but is not
truly enough to sustain a real impact against
Stanford's mental health. It may be cliche,
but the old adage of "if you give a man a fish,
you will feed him that day; if you teach him
to fish, he will be fed for a lifetime," truly en
capsulates what campus wellness efforts
need to initiate. An engagement of the or
ganizing groups with dorm programming
and throughout-the-year outreach to stu
dents will truly change how we find balance
and happiness while at Stanford. The ASSU
has definitely laid a foundation for what
wellness outreach can look like at Stanford,
and hopefully more comprehensive out
reach will follow in the future.
