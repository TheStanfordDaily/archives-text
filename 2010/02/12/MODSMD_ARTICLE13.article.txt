# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## "Sharing the Stanford Love" 
### Aysha Bagchi 
I remember what it felt like to apply to col
lege it was an uncertain time, I had no
idea how applicants got into places like
Stanford (and I still don't). Since then, my
school colors have changed. I have formed
my closest friendships, and a world of new
opportunities has been opened. While there
are dozens of universities in the U.S. that
offer outstanding educations and whose
graduates go on to do amazing things, I know
that going to Stanford in particular has made
a big difference.
Almost two years ago, President Hen
nessy introduced the question of gradually
expanding the size of the student body by 800
students, 200 more to each class (on top of the
1650 or so per class now). In his Stanford
Magazine column, he emphasized maintain
ing the present wealth of resources available
to students while responding to the increas
ing number of qualified applicants, so many
of whom are rejected simply because we lack
spots for them.
President Hennessy's suggestion was met
with mixed reviews and some resistance. Some
concerns had to do with ensuring student re
sources are not diminished or preventing a big
ger housing crunch, concerns the administra
tion surely shares and would address before
changing the admissions policy. But other con
cerns seemed to have more to do with the
value of a Stanford education in virtue of its ex
clusivity. If a couple hundred more students get
the same degree, that degree will be worth a lit
tle less (or so the argument goes).
In thinking about admissions policy, I try
to keep in mind that getting into Stanford is a
crapshoot. We are lucky, mostly because it is
hard to distinguish us from at least several
hundred similarly impressive students who
are rejected each year. Accepting this reality
of admissions that reasons for one top ap
plicant being admitted and another being re
jected are often nonexistent should help
us to extend our empathy and support expan
sion. With a 2009 admissions rate of 7.6 per
cent (which will be even lower this year), it is
difficult to overstate the cruelty attending
admissions. Providing relief should be
thought of as humanitarian action.
And if we consider all the remarkable
things Stanford graduates go on to do, we see
such a strong reason for expansion! A Stan
ford education is a public service not only be
cause it educates students from across the
country and around the world, but also be
cause those students go on to contribute and

benefit others, be it through creating start
ups, joining non-profits, working in govern
ment or embarking on countless other ca
reers that Stanford equips us for. Expanding
the undergraduate population would mean
200 more Stanford graduates a year would
use the education and resources Stanford
gave them to do wonderful things!
Expanding the student body would also
lessen the impact of some of the more con
troversial aspects of admissions. Each year,
many applicants will be given a boost be
cause of geographic location, because of
legacy, minority or first-generation college
status, because they go to a high school that
has never sent a student to Stanford or sends
ten each year, and the list continues. There
are some very good reasons why certain ap
plicants are given a boost, but the process in
evitably leaves some out for reasons beyond
their resumes. Expanding the class size will
help counter this inequity.
But beyond all these arguments argu
ments which show why all top schools should
look to expand their undergraduate popula
tions I cannot help feeling there is some
thing uniquely Stanford-like about the pro
posed move. One of the many things I love
about my school is its openness, the egalitar
ian appearance of the mellow Cardinal who
meets others with an unassuming mind. Stan
ford's high standards render it necessarily ex
clusive, and yet it lacks some of the elitist feel
attending exclusive places, in part because of
its down-to-earth spirit (that, and we're not
trying to look like Hogwarts!). Letting in a
few more remarkable students each year
would not diminish the talent or reputation
that characterizes Stanford, but it would
demonstrate the welcoming attitude that
most at Stanford have. It is the sort of thing
Stanford would do, and I hope it does.

In honor of Valentine 's Day, Aysha thinks we
should share the Stanford love! Send her your
