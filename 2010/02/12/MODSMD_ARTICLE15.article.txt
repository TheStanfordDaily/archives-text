# MIDNIGHT FRYER
## The 						"Sketchy" Grad Student 
### Yanran Lu 
You were a graduate student in the
GSB; I was a sophomore at Stanford
when we met. You were the person I
almost fell in love with, and I was the almost
twenty-year-old you would lose your reputa
tion for, becoming a "sketchy grad student." I
am not so sure now, a year later, if the rela
tionship carried as much resonance in your
life as it did in mine. Maybe that is the down
side of being with someone nine years older
I am not really sure if it is infatuation or
love. And maybe that is the downside of being
with someone nine years younger; you are not
really sure if people would see it as lust or
love. Even still, when I think about your
warmth embracing mine, I am still overcome
with loneliness.

We are two fringe people trying to find our
spotlight. You told me that you wanted a gen
uine friendship, one exemplified by a person
calling you for Sunday brunches instead of
Friday parties. You also told me that you
make conscious efforts to establish yourself
as "the party guy" while you are really "the
corner guy." And I laughed because I tried
that social experiment back in middle school,
but found out that I was just better at being
the observer. I told you I believed in true love
and I had this dream about a new acquain
tance whom I fell in love with because he un
derstood me more than any other being in
cluding myself. You said in your gentle melo
dious voice that you believed in love too, but
also confessed to being selfish. And I said,
"Yes, because the self, the "I," is the only per
son who would be with us 24/7 and live the
consequences." You were glad that I under
stood.

The second time we met, the time I was
painting the painting I never finished, you
told me that you graduated from Harvard
with a psychology degree, worked as a thera
pist for abused children and cried every night
because you were so affected by them. Then
when you worked in China, my motherland,
you hung out with children of the homeless

who collected garbage for a living. I thought
to myself, who is this guy kidding? Did he pre
pare the speech so he would sound like per
fection?

We had study sessions before and after we
first kissed. And you would read case studies
and explain to me what they were using Coke
and Pepsi as an example. Of course some
times I didn't really care what you said as long
as you said it in your deep-gentle-radio-host
of-a-night-jazz-station-voice. That one night I
came over to study, I sat myself on the little
corner you reserved for your guests because I
didn't know how I fit into your life or into
your room. Then I asked you some random
question concerning butter on your lamp, you
knelt down, nose level, face inches away from

mine, and your magnetic voice spoke, "You
know what, it's because...." My heart took a
skydive,my brain pulled the siren, and I glued
myself to the chair so I wouldn't stop you mid
sentence with my craving lips.
The morning you left was dark and gray. I
didn't have my glasses on, so even my memo
ries are vague. You said you couldn't be in my
life anymore because of what they would say.
I lay in your lap and sighed. In my heart I was
begging you not to go, but I did not tell you to
stay because you were doing it out of your
free will. My body trembled with loneliness
beneath my skin: I am the fringe person again
and I am by myself. So as I treasured the last
seconds with you, my heart felt just as silent as
the night we first kissed, the night I told you,
"I'm scared," and you told me not to be
afraid.

Perhaps I was afraid that you would give
up your fringe-self for the spotlight, or your
free spirit for public scrutiny. The experience
we shared from November through January
is bittersweet, like the heart-shaped, choco
late-covered espresso beans I made last
Valentine's Day. I joked to my friends that the
one looking like Africa was for you how I
missed your deep but gentle voice, your
smooth chocolate skin and your amber gaze.
But most of all I missed and still miss our con
versations and our level of understanding. I
miss being around you as a free spirit who is
exactly as is without a disguise. So if I were to
relive my life, I would tell you without hesita
tion that age really doesn't matter when it
comes to love. Love knows no boundaries no
matter what age, race, sex ... it is what I knew
when I was eight; it is what I know again now.
And it is something worth celebrating this
Valentine's Day.

Love knows no boundaries
