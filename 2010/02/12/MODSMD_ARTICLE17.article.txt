## SPARRING WITH FAMILIAR FOES Cardinal set to take on Cal once again 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, the No. 4 Stan
ford men's gymnastics team will
once again have a chance to flex
its strength and test its lineup
against Bay Area rival California.
The two teams will duel it out at
the Gold Country Classic meet in
Livermore, CA during the elite
and collegiate session at 7 p.m. on
Saturday.
The Gold Country Classic was
previously hosted on the pier in
San Francisco and has now
moved to the Robert Livermore
Center a new, multi-million
dollar complex with a 13,000
square-foot gymnasium.
"I think it's beneficial to com
pete in different environments
and get comfortable in any situa
tion," said redshirt freshman
John Martin.
Though Cal beat the Cardinal
last year at the event, this season
Stanford has won every time it
has faced the Golden Bears and
plans to follow that trend all the
way until the NCAAs. This meet
will be no exception.
"If Cal doesn't rest too many
guys, then it will be a good com
petition," said senior captain Ab
hinav Ramani. "Our guys have
been working hard on refining
the routines, and I think we're

going to have a good showing this
weekend."
Senior captain Greg Ter-Za
khariants agreed.
"Since we are not going to see
major competitors other than Cal
till the end of the season, Cal is a
good measure by which to gauge
how we are doing," he said.
The captains still stress that no
matter whom they compete
against, the preparations and the
goal in mind are the same for
each meet.
"We're competing against
ourselves, so we focus on our own
gymnastics so as to stream to
ward our full potential," Ter-Za
khariants said.
The team realizes that it can
only control what it does, and
therefore does not pay much at
tention to the other team.
"It does not matter against
whom we compete, as long as we
maintain a clear head and don't
get worked up about the good
and bad routines the other team
puts up," Ter-Zakhariants reiter
ated.
The team is on track in its
training for this time of year.
Soon, its training focus will shift
as it approaches the halfway
point in its season.
"At this point, we are starting
to focus on details in presenting
and perfecting our routines," said

junior Tim Gentry.
As a short-term goal, the Car
dinal is hoping to improve upon
its team performance from the
Stanford Open two weeks ago.
The lineups from both meets are
very similar in that they will give
underclassmen a chance to earn
their spots to compete. Juniors
Gentry, Alex Buscaglia, Ryan
Lieberman and Josh Dixon com
peted at last week's Winter Cup
Challenge and will take a week
end of rest while their teammates
take their place on the mat. Those
competing are eager to experi
ence more action and have a
chance to demonstrate what they
are capable of.
"We're ready to show the rest
of the country how deep our team
really is," Martin said, who will be
competing on the pommel horse,
parallel bars and high bar. Martin
and his fellow underclassmen are
excited to be contributing more
this season.
"I feel like our class and the
freshmen have a lot to offer this
year," Martin continued. "My
class has really stepped up since
last year. We watched as our
teammates won the national title
and we have learned what it is
going to take to do that again."
