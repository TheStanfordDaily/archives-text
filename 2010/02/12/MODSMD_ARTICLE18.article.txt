# Rematch in SoCal: Card set to face Bruins
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the first half of its regular sea
son finished, the No. 8 Stanford
women's gymnastics team is right
where it needs to be. The past five
weeks of competition have been de
manding, including a face-off with five
time defending NCAA Champion and
current No. 9 Georgia as well as a dual
meet with then-No. 1 UCLA. But with
three victories and two close second
place finishes, the Cardinal (6-2) has
proven just how prepared it is to take
down its opponents in its five remaining
meets.
First, and perhaps most importantly,
No. 8 Stanford will again meet up with
No. 5 UCLA (5-1) on Sunday in what
will be another opportunity to upset the
national rankings. The Bruins' only loss
came on the Farm three weeks ago. Be
fore Jan. 24, UCLA reigned supreme in
collegiate gymnastics, but following its
196.425-195.875 loss to the Cardinal, it
plummeted from the No. 1 ranking,
which it has been unable to regain.
However, Stanford did not overtake
the Bruins with extreme ease. In fact,
UCLA's overall score edged the Cardi
nal's up until the final event when Stan
ford's outstanding floor performances
handily outscored UCLA's low floor
scores, which were the result of multiple
falls. The win for Stanford was a prod
uct of confidence and consistency in all

four events, both of which Head Coach
Kristen Smyth emphasizes as key com
ponents of the team's success.
Now, as they prepare to travel to Los
Angeles for Sunday's dual meet, the
Cardinal gymnasts plan to employ gen
erally the same approach as last time,
with a few additions to the lineup.
Sophomore Nicole Pechanec and jun
ior Shelley Alexander will be adding
new dismounts to their bar routines,
which should make the team's bar diffi
culty a lot stronger as a whole.
Senior Allyse Ishino will also be an
important addition to the floor rota
tion, as she will be competing for the
first time after only performing exhibi
tions in the past several meets. Ishino's
teammates and coaches are excited to
get her out on the floor because they
expect that her addition to the lineup
will change the team's overall look in
the event.
It is this energy the team hopes to
gain from additions like Ishino that
Stanford will use to compete in the
away gymnasium. Performing in Burn
ham Pavilion has proven to be advanta
geous to the team, but now the Cardinal
gymnasts will have to compensate for
being on the road by feeding off each
other's confidence and enthusiasm.
"It's always wonderful to be at home
because of the energy and excitement,"
Smyth said. "The crowd is so involved
in what we do, so we definitely miss that
no matter where we go. But a team that

can compete well on the road is a team
that can compete at the end. We need to
bring our A-game and build off of each
other rather than rely on outside stimu
lus to give us anything extra."
A tremendous incentive in its own,
however, is the intense rivalry that has
developed between the Stanford and
UCLA gymnastics programs over the
years. The two Pac-10 powers have
been battling back and forth, swapping
conference titles every year since 2003.
In fact, in their last eleven matchups, the
Card has claimed six wins and the Bru
ins have taken five. In order to break
the trend of trading victories, "We will
automatically have to bring a little bit
extra," Smyth said.
Though it has had significant success
so far this season, the team has nowhere
to head but up.
"We still haven't had that meet
where we're hitting 24 routines, but
we're exactly where we need to be as
far as being able to get 196-plus scores,"
Smyth said. "We still have improve
ments and adds to be made, so we're in
a really good position."
The team heads to Los Angeles
armed with confidence from a solid first
five weeks of competition and is hope
ful of a repeat of the last face-off with
the Bruins. UCLA and Stanford will
battle on Sunday at 2 p.m.
