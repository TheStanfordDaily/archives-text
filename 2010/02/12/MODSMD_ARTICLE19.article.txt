# Pac-10 should not expand
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
In a statement on Tuesday, Pac-10
Conference commissioner Larry
Scott said that the Pac-10 is giving
"serious evaluation" to the idea of
expanding the conference. By the
end of 2010, the Pac-10 could have two
more teams enter, as the conference is in
the midst of renegotiating its television
contracts. According to Scott, the confer
ence has not had much conversation
with other potential schools, but I think
the consideration is pretty serious, and
we could definitely see the Pac-12 by the
end of this year.
I personally think the Pac-10 is just
fine the way it is. The 10 schools are per
fect, the geographical locations are per
fect and the teams succeed wildly as it is.
Adding two more teams will just dilute
the conference, make the pie bigger and
each school's slice smaller. It will also
probably mess up the perfect round
robin format that the conference has in
several sports, including basketball and
women's volleyball (that is, playing each
team at home and on the road in a season
compare this to the other conferences
that play some schools once, some
schools twice and some schools not at all
during their regular seasons).
Getting 12 teams would probably
mean that the Pac-10 goes to a split-con
ference in football and then has a cham
pionship game at the end of the season. I
am not a fan of the split-conference be
cause it all but ruins competitiveness,
parity and the chance for success. Look
at the Big 12 North and South if you want
evidence.
But if the Pac-10 is going to expand
(because the financial implications may
be looking too good), they should ex
pand strategically. And by strategically, I
mean bringing in two schools in the West
that are Pac-10 caliber and have close ge
ographic proximity to each other. The
two best candidates would be BYU and
Utah.
I think it makes the most sense for
Scott to consider these two. They are
great athletic schools. They align with
one of the Pac-10's biggest assets geo
graphic proximity so teams can play
both of them on one road trip to Utah.
They bring competitiveness to almost all
of the sports in which the Pac-10 com
petes and thrives, and many of their
teams have even seen more success than
many of their Pac-10 counterparts over
the years. They are beginning to domi
nate and overwhelm the conference that
they are currently in the Mountain
West Conference a conference made
up of smaller, less endowed schools that
have smaller talent pools and offer fewer
sports and scholarships. It might be time
for BYU and Utah to "graduate" to a
better, more well-known and respected
conference. Miami, Boston College and
Virginia Tech all made the jump from the
Big East to the ACC in the early 2000s in
quite a similar fashion. BYU and Utah to
the Pac-10 (and a subsequent replace
ment of those schools in the Mountain
West) would be almost no different.
In terms of travel, the Utah schools
are decently equidistant from all the cur
rent Pac-10 schools. The conference
could minimize expansion costs by
bringing in those schools that are easy to
get to (maybe not in December or Janu
ary) and close to each other (a 45-minute
drive separates them). Another plus is
the already-established rivalry between
the two schools. A great thing about the
Pac-10 is that all the in-state schools have
big rivalries with each other. BYU and
Utah would fit in perfectly here, as their
"Holy War" is already on par with the
likes of the Big Game, the Apple Cup
and the Civil War.
Then again, adding the Utah schools
would throw off the whole idea of the
"Pac-10" because the schools would no
longer represent a trek up and down the
West Coast of the United States. Instead,
we must call it the "West-12" or some
thing like that. Adding the two Utah
schools would also ruin the pretty picture
in those Pac-10 commercials of Washing
ton, Oregon, California, and Arizona all
in a row down the coast. Now it would
have to jump over to Utah (poor Neva
da), which is borderline Rocky Moun
tain territory. However, I'm guessing that
the Pac-10 doesn't really care about pret
ty pictures.
If the Pac-10 isn't looking to go as far
East as Utah, the other suggestion I have
for two additional teams are San Diego
State and the University of San Diego.
Again, going with the geographical
theme here, the two San Diego schools
make good sense to add to the Pac-10

(San Diego State already is in the Pac-10
for men's soccer). And the whole "Pacif
ic" thing does not get lost here as the
schools are in California, so the Pac-10
would still keep its nice shape of schools
up and down the Pacific coast. While
BYU and Utah are better athletic
schools on the whole than SDSU and
USD (though the San Diego schools do
bring some talent in various sports a la
Oregon State and Washington State), I
could understand the San Diego picks
because of location alone.

Other schools to consider could be
Boise State (but really,do they have any
thing besides football?), UNLV, Gonza
ga, UC-Davis and Saint Mary's. Howev
er, I think the previous four schools I
mentioned would be better picks than
these schools. If the Pac-10 is going to ex
pand to these schools, it seriously needs
to reconsider.

Actually, if expanding would bring
more lucrative media deals like Scott
is hinting at â€”then perhaps it is not a
bad idea that the Pac-10 adds schools. If
that is what it takes to get better TV con
tracts and thus become more noticed,
then perhaps that is the price the Pac-10
has to pay. But if the Pac-10 thinks that
these schools are going to enter and be
stepped all over, they should think again.

Adding Utah and BYU would make the
conference pretty competitive in a lot of
sports, and I could definitely see one of
their teams winning a Pac-10 title in its
first year.

So can I understand why Scott and
the conference are considering expan
sion? Yes, I do. Do I think the Pac-10
should expand? No, I do not. I think the
conference is doing just fine as is, and
things can be done in terms of money
and media with the 10 teams. But to offer
my best prediction, I think you better
start getting used to saying Pac-12.

BYU and Utah are better athletic
schools on the whole than SDSU and
USD (though the San Diego schools do
bring some talent in various sports a la
Oregon State and Washington State), I
could understand the San Diego picks
because of location alone.

Other schools to consider could be
Boise State (but really,do they have any
thing besides football?), UNLV, Gonza
ga, UC-Davis and Saint Mary's. Howev
er, I think the previous four schools I
mentioned would be better picks than
these schools. If the Pac-10 is going to ex
pand to these schools, it seriously needs
to reconsider.

Actually, if expanding would bring
more lucrative media deals like Scott
is hinting at â€”then perhaps it is not a
bad idea that the Pac-10 adds schools. If
that is what it takes to get better TV con
tracts and thus become more noticed,
then perhaps that is the price the Pac-10
has to pay. But if the Pac-10 thinks that
these schools are going to enter and be
stepped all over, they should think again.

Adding Utah and BYU would make the
conference pretty competitive in a lot of
sports, and I could definitely see one of
their teams winning a Pac-10 title in its
first year.

So can I understand why Scott and
the conference are considering expan
sion? Yes, I do. Do I think the Pac-10
should expand? No, I do not. I think the
conference is doing just fine as is, and
things can be done in terms of money
and media with the 10 teams. But to offer
my best prediction, I think you better
start getting used to saying Pac-12.

In a statement on Tuesday, Pac-10
Conference commissioner Larry
Scott said that the Pac-10 is giving
"serious evaluation" to the idea of
expanding the conference. By the
end of 2010, the Pac-10 could have two
more teams enter, as the conference is in
the midst of renegotiating its television
contracts. According to Scott, the confer
ence has not had much conversation
with other potential schools, but I think
the consideration is pretty serious, and
we could definitely see the Pac-12 by the
end of this year.
I personally think the Pac-10 is just
fine the way it is. The 10 schools are per
fect, the geographical locations are per
fect and the teams succeed wildly as it is.
Adding two more teams will just dilute
the conference, make the pie bigger and
each school's slice smaller. It will also
probably mess up the perfect round
robin format that the conference has in
several sports, including basketball and
women's volleyball (that is, playing each
team at home and on the road in a season
compare this to the other conferences
that play some schools once, some
schools twice and some schools not at all
during their regular seasons).
Getting 12 teams would probably
mean that the Pac-10 goes to a split-con
ference in football and then has a cham
pionship game at the end of the season. I
am not a fan of the split-conference be
cause it all but ruins competitiveness,
parity and the chance for success. Look
at the Big 12 North and South if you want
evidence.
But if the Pac-10 is going to expand
(because the financial implications may
be looking too good), they should ex
pand strategically. And by strategically, I
mean bringing in two schools in the West
that are Pac-10 caliber and have close ge
ographic proximity to each other. The
two best candidates would be BYU and
Utah.
I think it makes the most sense for
Scott to consider these two. They are
great athletic schools. They align with
one of the Pac-10's biggest assets geo
graphic proximity so teams can play
both of them on one road trip to Utah.
They bring competitiveness to almost all
of the sports in which the Pac-10 com
petes and thrives, and many of their
teams have even seen more success than
many of their Pac-10 counterparts over
the years. They are beginning to domi
nate and overwhelm the conference that
they are currently in the Mountain
West Conference a conference made
up of smaller, less endowed schools that
have smaller talent pools and offer fewer
sports and scholarships. It might be time
for BYU and Utah to "graduate" to a
better, more well-known and respected
conference. Miami, Boston College and
Virginia Tech all made the jump from the
Big East to the ACC in the early 2000s in
quite a similar fashion. BYU and Utah to
the Pac-10 (and a subsequent replace
ment of those schools in the Mountain
West) would be almost no different.
In terms of travel, the Utah schools
are decently equidistant from all the cur
rent Pac-10 schools. The conference
could minimize expansion costs by
bringing in those schools that are easy to
get to (maybe not in December or Janu
ary) and close to each other (a 45-minute
drive separates them). Another plus is
the already-established rivalry between
the two schools. A great thing about the
Pac-10 is that all the in-state schools have
big rivalries with each other. BYU and
Utah would fit in perfectly here, as their
"Holy War" is already on par with the
likes of the Big Game, the Apple Cup
and the Civil War.
Then again, adding the Utah schools
would throw off the whole idea of the
"Pac-10" because the schools would no
longer represent a trek up and down the
West Coast of the United States. Instead,
we must call it the "West-12" or some
thing like that. Adding the two Utah
schools would also ruin the pretty picture
in those Pac-10 commercials of Washing
ton, Oregon, California, and Arizona all
in a row down the coast. Now it would
have to jump over to Utah (poor Neva
da), which is borderline Rocky Moun
tain territory. However, I'm guessing that
the Pac-10 doesn't really care about pret
ty pictures.
If the Pac-10 isn't looking to go as far
East as Utah, the other suggestion I have
for two additional teams are San Diego
State and the University of San Diego.
Again, going with the geographical
theme here, the two San Diego schools
make good sense to add to the Pac-10

(San Diego State already is in the Pac-10
for men's soccer). And the whole "Pacif
ic" thing does not get lost here as the
schools are in California, so the Pac-10
would still keep its nice shape of schools
up and down the Pacific coast. While
BYU and Utah are better athletic
schools on the whole than SDSU and
USD (though the San Diego schools do
bring some talent in various sports a la
Oregon State and Washington State), I
could understand the San Diego picks
because of location alone.

Other schools to consider could be
Boise State (but really,do they have any
