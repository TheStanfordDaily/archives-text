It has come again the most
agonizing reality of February.
No, it's not the reincarnation
of your STD, it's only the
onslaught of the release of the
newest Valentine's Day movies.
This one is suitably titled
"Valentine's Day," which Anne
Hathaway informs us is the most
popular day for phone sex calls of
the year. If you haven't heard of it,
you clearly haven't followed any
celebrity gossip news sources, as
statistics show that the movie
employed more than half of
Hollywood in some form or
another.
Boys, is it worth it to go
with your girls? Girls, will it live up
to your highest Rom Com stan
dards? Whoever hired TayLaut and
T-Swiff (gag me please) would like
you to think so. At least they were
smart enough to employ true tal
ent in the form of Ashton Kutcher,
Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Garner,
Julia Roberts, Jessica Biel, George
Lopez, Hector Elizondo, Shirley
MacLaine, Jamie Foxx, Bradley
Cooper and Eric Dane ... and
that's roughly half of the cast.
One thing to be noted:
this movie is definitely the
American attempt to dethrone
Britain's glorified "Love Actually"
the similarities are rather obvi
ous and deja vu moments abound,
we promise. Shall we numerate
them? One. An old couple makes
you want to truly love someone for
50-something years. Two. There is
an adorable little boy who is
attempting to ascertain a cute, but
obviously unrealistic, understand
ing of the various facets of "true
love." Three. Some people are
promiscuous and will make some
one's V-Day be filled with the sads.
Four. Everyone is in love. Really.

"Valentine's Day" begins
with Kutcher's character, Reed
Bennett, proposing to his long
time girlfriend played by the
waste-of-space Jessica Alba. We
then kick into gear, roaming the
streets and neighborhoods of Los
Angeles as our naturally intercon
nected characters begin the Day
Everyone Loves To Hate. Teachers,
florists, football stars, sports
agents, airplane seatmates and
children, on the surface, have little
in common, but the way that they
all interact and care about each

other convinced us of the reality of
their situations. The movie reaches
its climax when infidelity of many
kinds rears its ugly head in multi
ple accounts, causing some charac
ters' lives to come crashing to the
ground. (Tired of our cliches?
We're not, because "Valentine's
Day" certainly employed a few, but
successfully, we might add.)
Where the movie really
shines is in constructing the
dynamics between all the big stars,
even though when their collective
values are taken into account, you
feel like all you should see are stars
and dollar signs. In fact, it's almost
as if these characters act, laugh and
just live like gasp real people.
We can all relate to the friendship
network and support system that
these characters have. The manner
in which they go about accom
plishing even the most basics of
their daily routines flows naturally,
with an abundance of quirky yet
comedic twists. Speaking of
humor, the integral part of any
romantic comedy is the latter half
of the eponymous name and
like everything else is this movie, it
suited the story well. The jokes
span across all ages, is cute without
being overbearingly sappy (as is

often the case for this genre during
this time), and genuinely made us
laugh and smile.
What it all comes down
to, in the end, is that we all love to
be loved. Even more, we hate that
Valentine's Day reminds us that we
not only love to be loved, we
absolutely need to be loved. It's
what makes us human. Take our
exceptionally fabulous word for it:
go see "Valentine's Day" on
Valentine's Day with your
Valentine. (We're going to go
vomit now.)
