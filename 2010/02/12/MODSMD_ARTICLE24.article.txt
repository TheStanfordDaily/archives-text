For a lot of us, Feb. 14 is just
another day of the year.
However, as much as we try
to fight it, Valentine's Day is going
to hit this Sunday, whether we like
it or not. While those in and out
of love don't necessarily need to
embrace the tasteless chocolate
hearts and the overpriced teddy
bears, Valentine's Day is a great
excuse for anyone to make a new
playlist. Unless you are using the
Genius tool, creating playlists is a
tedious and daunting task, mak
ing sure each song is significant
not only in its quality, but also in
its placement on the track list.
Luckily for you faithful readers,
Intermission is going to be your
own personal playlist Genius this
Valentine's Day. Whether you are
looking for, have found or are not
at all interested in love, sync your
iPod with this sampler to perfect
ly set the mood this Sunday.

1. "Your Love Is My
Drug" Kesha

Fan of this party girl or
not, this song is perfect to dance
to with your girlfriends or sing
along to at a party. It's catchy and
sassy, and there is certainly a rea
son why it is the opener on her
smash-hit album, "Animal," and
why it makes the perfect opener
for this playlist.

2. "Pon De Floor (feat.
Vybz Kartel)" Major
Lazer

Major Lazer, the reggae
electro project from Switch and
Diplo (he played on campus last
year!), has such a wide variety of
dancehall tracks that it was tough
to choose just one. "Pon De
Floor" is perhaps the most infec
tious, and is literally impossible
not to dance to. Also, it has a
notable lack of lyrics, which you
will definitely appreciate by the
end of this list.

3. "Heartbreaker (feat.
John Legend)"
MSTRKRFT
Electronic gods
MSTRKRFT stayed true to their
successful formula in their sopho

more album, "Fist of God," with
retro synths and that thunderous
bass. However, they lined up sig
nificantly more guest vocalists this
time around. Soul-pop artist John
Legend lends his skills to
"Heartbreaker," and his voice will
not only melt your heart, but
MSTRKRFT's beats will get you
dancing.

4. "Home" Edward
Sharpe and the
Magnetic Zeros

Giving this sampler a
dash of a different flavor, L.A.-
based folk group Edward Sharpe
will work its way into your heart
with an endearing collaboration
of banjos, tambourines, accor
dions and the like. "Home" is an
impossibly sweet duet with a jan
gling chorus and enthusiastic
hand claps. Halfway through the
song, you will find yourself
singing along with your friends or
significant other, or to yourself—

the song being special no matter
what the situation.

5. "Laura" Girls

San Francisco-based
group Girls is poised to take the
indie music scene by storm, and
"Laura" is included on this list for
more reasons than its impossibly
hip status. Singer Christopher
Owens pleads throughout the
song, "I really wanna be your
friend forever," showing that not
all guys are after just one thing.
Their Beach Boys-esque sound
alone will win you over, but Girls
shows that they can be romantic
with the best of them on "Laura."

6. "I Want You Back"
Discovery

Summer's coolest collab
oration between Ra Ra Riot's Wes
Miles and Vampire Weekend's
Rostam Batmanglij gave us the

light and bubbly electo-pop
record, "LP," which featured a
cover of this Jackson 5 classic.
While some may be skeptical
about the efficacy of remaking a
song featuring the impossible-to
duplicate late King of Pop's voice,
Discovery utilized the tool of the
hour Auto Tune and to great
success. The result is an over
processed yet addictive track that
you'll want to blast out your
speakers long after Valentine's Day
has come and gone.
