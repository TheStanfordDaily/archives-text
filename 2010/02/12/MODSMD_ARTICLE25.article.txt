As I left the movie theater after seeing "Dear John," sobbing not out
of sadness, but because the film was heartbreakingly boring, I start
ed reminiscing about the best chick flicks in the last 10 years.
Usually, one of the highlights of Valentine's Day is the influx of romantic
comedies and sappy love stories in theaters. After all, candlelit dinners are
fine, but an ideal Valentine's Day week should also incorporate a quality
chick flick and a big bowl of popcorn. Some of the best chick flicks and
their essential food pairings are:
1. "He's Just Not That Into You"
While some critics were not enamored with the film adaptation of
the popular self-help book, the movie, helmed by a star-studded cast, is the
perfect way to deflect relationship worries onto the screen. Watch as multi
ple storylines unfold about the all-too-relatable perils of love.

Perfect Pairing: Those Sweethearts with messages like "Call me", "Kiss me"
and "Be Mine."
2. "How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days"
Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey are the same in every
single movie, but in this one, it works. Male or female, it was almost impos
sible to get away from this movie, and quite frankly, why would you want
to? Hilarity ensues when a Knicks game is replaced with a Celine Dion con
cert, and in the memorable scene where Hudson's character crashes the all
male poker night.
Perfect Pairing: Buffalo wings (eat them with your hands), food with lots of
garlic or caramelized onions, or anything else you'd never eat on a date.
3. "Sex & the City: The Movie"
In theory, this does not even need an explanation. The classic
HBO series-turned-movie has brought women of all backgrounds and
interests together, bonding over relatable situations and beautiful guys.
Every woman sees herself in Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda or Samantha, so get
your girls together for the ultimate estrogen-fest.
Perfect Pairing: Yumi Yogurt. Pretend you bought it at Tasty D-Lite. Follow
with a Cosmopolitan.
4. "Love Actually"
This may technically be considered a Christmas movie, and while
all of the events revolve around the holiday season, the storyline makes for
a perfect Valentine's Day flick. This mostly British ensemble cast delivers a
heart-wrenching, heartwarming performance that endears itself to even the
stoniest of viewers. Christmas or not, love is all around us.
Perfect Pairing: Chocolate-covered strawberries.
5. "Bridget Jones's Diary" (and the sequel)
In Renee Zellweger's star turn, "Bridget Jones's Diary" provides
female audiences with a character that we can all relate to. Who doesn't
worry about their weight, taste in men or bad habits from time to time?
While absolutely hysterical, this movie was also realistic unless you think
about the likelihood of Colin Firth and Hugh Grant fighting over you.
Perfect Pairing: Wine, cigarettes, entire pints of Ben & Jerry's, any other
vices you and Bridget share.
