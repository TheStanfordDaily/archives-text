Valentine's Day weekend is finally here, and of course it's a social-packed
weekend with your friends, your hot date or, let's be honest, Ben &
Jerry's. But of course, this weekend is just as much about sending that
Valentine as it is about looking your best. Even if you don't have a 'Valentine,'
why not make sure you are on top of your fashion game? Valentine's Day does
n't have to be only date time or frump city, ladies. It's the time to look your
best in pink and red which are two colors that look great on everyone, in
my opinion. There are different kinds of social events this weekend, all of
which require different wardrobes. Let's go through the scenarios:

The Date fl
You have that upscale reservation (hopefully in San Fran!) and your hot
date. Getting all gussied up is fun, but it can be daunting to figure out what to pick
out from your closet. Bring out that nice shift dress that you brought to school, but
never get a chance to wear. This can also call for your fancy jewelry, because girl, it's
time to strut on the town! Either nice flats or leather boots go well with a mid-thigh
shift. Anything below mid-thigh requires heels. For heels, work those new platform stilettos. Pair with a lightweight
cardigan or a peacoat, especially if it's a cold night. Don't let the weather ruin how fly you want to look and feel
tonight.

The Night With the Girls
Before you prepare those martinis and go out to a relaxed night with the girls, you should put some
thought into your look before you prepare to laugh, gossip and maybe even come home to watch Sex and the
City. For this occasion, you do not have to dress to the nines, but you still want to look good and feel good about
how you look. Hey, you may wind up finding love even when you are not looking! This relaxed-yet-chic look can
be as simple as slipping on the jeggings, tunic and leather jacket to putting on that two-toned skin-tight American
apparel dress and ballet flats. You should feel comfortable, but still look cute. This night is all about having fun!
The Party
Whether it's a room party or a frat party, you need an outfit in which you can dance and have a good
time! This is probably the time you will dress most to theme, meaning lots of pink and red, and even heart pat
terns if you have them. If you have red pumps or a quasi-novelty pink mini dress or skirt, bring them out! This
could be a time for wearing some serious "rally" gear, meaning anything goes (within reason). There is away to
dress to theme and look cute, and there is definitely away to miss the idea completely. Something key to remember
in wearing a fun, costume-y outfit is to go with a somewhat matching color palette, and wear things that genuinely
do look good on you and do not hug in the wrong places. Whether
you're dressing up for fun or keeping it classy, have fun with your
outfit!
