I was initially against writing this
food guide because I fundamen
tally oppose anything that fur
thers the association between Feb.
14 (an otherwise innocuous date)
and the saccharine, Hallmark-creat
ed aberration of a holiday that is
Valentine's Day. But food is general
ly a wonderful way to bring people
together, and the cultural, emotion
al and aesthetic experience of shar
ing an out-of-the-ordinary meal on
Valentine's Day need not be limited
to those in a romantic relationship.
So whether you're committed for
life, just trying to get some or are
Stanford's very own version of
Jennifer Aniston, hopefully this
guide helps you enjoy the Stanford
area's culinary bounty on Sunday.
On a personal level, compiling this
guide helped me realize that

Valentine's Day need not be about
tacky stuffed animals, awkward
dates or the exchange of heart
shaped chocolate boxes that no one
will ever eat. In the middle of a mis
erably rainy winter, it can be a day
to appreciate love in any form
romantic love, but also love
between friends and family or even
love of self. And in my mind, love
and food are inexorably tied.

Cheap Date

So you're broke (unless
Cardinal Dollars count, which they
don't) and it's Valentine's Day. Sure,
you could pretend to come down
with a gnarly case of pink eye to
avoid seeing anyone, but there are
also creative ways to enjoy a

Valentine's Day meal without
breaking the bank. My
favorite idea is a picnic. Go
wild at Palo Alto's new Trader
Joe's and laze away an after
noon somewhere scenic. Some
location suggestions: an
arcade in the Main Quad, the
isolated lawn at the end of
Mayfield, the top of the Dish,
Gamble Gardens in Palo Alto
(a hidden gem two miles off
campus, just past Castilleja
School) or somewhere on the
shores of Lake Lag. As for the
contents of your picnic bas-

ket? Try brie and a fresh baguette,
prosciutto with melon and man
darin oranges.
Another well-priced and
yummy option is the Vietnamese
restaurant Pho Vi Hoa in Los Altos.
Just 10 minutes off campus (on the
way to Target), Pho Vi Hoa serves
up simple but incredible plates of
grilled chicken and steamed rice for
just $7.50, and steaming bowls of
pho (Vietnamese noodle soup) for
just $6. The ambiance leaves some
thing to be desired, but it's hard to
find a more satisfying price to taste
ratio anywhere nearby. For people
willing to explore even more grungy
venues, don't discount the Stanford
area's abundant taquerias. My
favorite is Taqueria La Bamba in
Mountain View, whose carnitas
burritos and traditional Salvadoran

pupusas (deep fried corn tortillas
stuffed with cheese and/or pork) are
irresistible and both under $7.

Traditional

Whether you're trying to
sweep that special someone off their
feet or want a classy night out with
friends you usually only see in, say,
Manzanita Dining, Valentine's Day
and fancy restaurants are nearly
synonymous. While Palo Alto gen
erally sucks at fulfilling Stanford
students' entertainment needs, it
does have a few good bets to get a
nice dinner. My favorite is Zibibbo,
located in a beautifully renovated
Victorian home, which specializes
in small plates and rotisserie grilled
items with a California-meets-the-
Mediterranean feel. I'm especially

into the prawns, "Israeli Cigars" and
suckling pig. You also can't go
wrong with La Strada, an intimate
Italian-meets-Californian restau
rant; when my life takes a turn for
the worse, the only thing I want to
eat is their wild boar ragu. A third
option is Ewia, whose Greek-slash-
Californian (noticing a trend here?)
food mixes perfectly with the cozy
atmosphere. The only downside to
all three? Dinner will set you back
about $4O per person, including tax
and tip.

Something
Different

If you're looking to move
beyond typical fusion-y California
cuisine, the area around
Stanford has a few (if limited)
options for adventurous gas
tronomes. Shiok!, in downtown
Menlo Park, features
Singaporean food, which is a
hodgepodge of Indian, Chinese,
Malaysian and uniquely
Singaporean items. Their roti
prata (a fried pancake-like
bread dipped in curry sauce)
alone is worth a trip. Also in
downtown Menlo Park, Juban
is a Korean restaurant where
diners sit around open grills
embedded in the middle of

tables. You can pick from a pretty
big selection of meats and vegeta
bles, which you then cook yourself
on the central grill, and then eat
alongside steamed rice and a soy
sauce-based dipping sauce. Juban is
an especially good option if you're
worried about potential awkward
ness; because it's so interactive,
when conversation lags, you can just
shift focus to determining whether
the chicken has been cooked all the
way through (although the symp
toms of salmonella might not be
the sexiest thing to discuss with a
date).
