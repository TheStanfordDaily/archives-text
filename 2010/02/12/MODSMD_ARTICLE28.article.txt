With Valentine's Day quick
ly approaching, it is
inevitable that boxes of
chocolate, red roses and stuffed ani
mals will soon be everywhere. You
really can't have Valentine's Day
without these various items at

least if you want a Valentine. People
will soon be decorating their rooms
red and pink, and be given
Hallmark cards covered in hearts.
Another critical staple of V-day
the heart symbol. Trust me, on
Sunday you won't be able to escape

it! If you ask me, it really doesn't
make any sense. I've taken sciences
classes and I know my heart does
not look anything like that! I've
always wondered where the symbol
came from, so I conducted a little
investigation in preparation for the

coming holiday; and it turns out the
symbol for the heart has undergone
quite a transformation. Let's start at
the beginning.
In ancient India, the word
"yoni" was mentioned in The Vedas,
a collection of religious texts, in
several different contexts. From this
source, "yoni" came to mean "origin
of life," epitomizing femininity and
symbolized by a shape conveying

the external female genitalia. It hap

pens to look like a crude, unrefined
heart. The belief was that women
were endowed with divine energy
because of their ability to create life,
The yoni symbol can be found on
thousands of ancient Indian arti
facts as an image of fertility and
womanly energy. This figure laid
the foundation for what we today
call a heart.
Alchemy is responsible for
the symbol's next mutation.
Eventually, the yoni symbol evolved
into an upside down triangle.
Alchemists used this symbol to rep
resent water, or down-
flow.

This
graphic mirrors that of the
bone and the image continued to
represent femininity and woman
hood. One particular alchemist,
Aristotle, believed that the human
heart was the center of all emotions
because it is so easily affected by
how we are feeling; for example, it
beats faster when we are excited or
nervous. Although he was incorrect,
due to his theories and because the
symbol was related to affection and
intimacy (having sex and giving

birth), the shape that evolved from
the yoni was soon called a "heart."
Over time, the upside
down triangle's shape was modified,
reworked and commercialized to
become the form it is known as
today. So this Valentine's Day,

whenever you see the classic heart
shape, and you definitely will see it
a lot, you will now know that it
originated from a shape represent
ing a woman's capacity to make life
and give birth, and that it slowly
evolved into the quintessential sym
bol for love and affection.
