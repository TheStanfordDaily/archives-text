# Remote Nomad: Love in the Time of College
## 
### â€“ liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
I don't think about love often,
so when I was informed that
this week's Intermission was a
Valentine's Day explosion of red,
chocolate and rose petals, I con
templated writing a rant against
Valentine's Day-themed episodes.
But I've had a good day, so I'm
feeling generous and balanced
and list-y.
Television and
Valentine's Day don't mix well in
my opinion, because, if you're in a
relationship, let's hope you're
doing something more stimulat
ing than watching TV on Feb. 14.

This column goes out to all those
other people on this vomitously
romantic day, and by "all those
other people," I mean both those
who are optimistic about love and
those who are not. For the former
group, good for you for buying
into the hype and the Disney
movies; for the latter, good for
you for keeping it real.
Three TV Shows for
People Who Love Love:
"United States of Tara"
John Corbett's charac-

ter's allegiance to his wife's four
identities (she suffers from disso
ciative identity disorder .. . new
tongue twister!) will make every
viewer melt with hope for
mankind. Toni Collette's four
identities each presents a unique
perspective on love and sex that
will make you reevaluate your
worldview.
"How I Met Your Mother"
The premise of this
show, a father telling his children
about how he met their mother,
uses love as the mirage at the end

of the desert horizon: it guides
the course of the show and pro
vides its endpoint, but doesn't
overpower every episode with a
saccharinely romantic plotline.
Love, on "HIMYM," is the latent
objective of every character's exis
tence, and what's more romantic
than that?
"Modern Family"
Love comes in all shapes,
sizes, genders, ages and intellects
on this standout ABC comedy
from the Fall 2009 season. If
"HIMYM" is about finding love,

"Modern" is about how we
express our love in the most sim
ple ways. The thesis of "Modern
Family" seems to be that love is
universal and undiscriminating
a lesson from which America
and the world can always benefit.
Three TV Shows for
People Who Don't Love
Love:
"Big Love"
This depiction of mod
ern polygamy could swing either
way when it comes to love. To a
certain extent, even if the hetero
sexual marriage of Bill to Barb,
Nicki or Margene is in a funk, the
wives' love for each other can rise
above. In the current season,
however, loving your significant
other (or all three of them) while
loving yourself presents a nearly
insurmountable task.
"Mad Men"
If Betty and Don can't
stay together, what hope is there
for ugly people like us?
"Teen Mom"
'nuff said.
