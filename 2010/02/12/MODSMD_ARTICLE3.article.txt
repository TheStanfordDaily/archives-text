## Rehired janitor celebrated Students gather in honor of Karina Reyes at El Centro Chicano 
### CRISTIANA GIANNINI 
Karina Reyes joined friends, Stan
ford Labor Action Coalition (SLAC)
members and students Thursday af
ternoon at El Centro Chicano to cel
ebrate her reemployment after being
fired from her position as a campus
janitor in January.
Reyes was initially suspended and
then dismissed by the janitorial sub
contractor ABM Industries, for
whom she has worked for two years,
after connecting her cellphone to a
computer in a Terman Engineering
Center office she was cleaning on Jan.
18. Newly installed video surveillance
cameras captured her actions, and
campus security officers arrived
shortly afterward concerned about
whether she was stealing data. Reyes
said she was charging her phone.
Following her suspension, Reyes
sought help from Adriana Campos
'll, the director of Habla la Noche, a
student-worker English tutoring pro
gram in which Reyes participates.
Campos put her in touch with SLAC,
which took up the case,
SLAC members met with Reyes
to develop a campaign plan involving
other night-shift co-workers. Claudia
Lopez 'l3, Reyes' tutor at Habla la
Noche, and other students helped
them translate Reyes' story into Eng
lish so that they could reach out to the
larger community. Reyes and her
friends handed out fliers in White
Plaza informing people of what had
happened and visited campus dorms
and dining halls to gather support.
They obtained 1,650 petition signa
tures, and on Feb. 4, Reyes was re
hired.
An ABM spokesperson, citing
Reyes' case as a personnel matter, de
clined to comment.
At the Thursday celebration,
Reyes, with the help of a translator,
described her experience.
"At first, when I approached Adri
ana, I felt scared, alone and didn't
know what to do," she said.
Reyes expressed happiness to be
back at work and gratitude to every-
one who was involved in her cam
paign. Supporters were inspired by
the degree of solidarity they saw
between workers and the student
body, and Reyes said she plans to
continue working among her co
workers to coordinate and organize
their efforts.
Nayeli Gallardo 'l3, who
learned about the story through an
e-mail from SLAC and signed the
petition, was among many students
present at the Thursday celebra

tion.
"We need to recognize that the
Stanford community is not just stu
dents and faculty," Gallardo said.
"There're a lot of other people that
make the University what it is."
Although the University denies
having made any request to have
Reyes dismissed, SLAC member
Dave Mitchell 'O9 was critical of the
janitorial subcontracting system
Stanford uses to hire workers like
Reyes through companies like

ABM; he stressed the importance
of workers' initiative in this and
similar projects.
"Every step of the way Karina
was driving the agenda, and it was
her campaign," Mitchell said. "That
was really important to us ... she
has been a remarkable advocate
and an incredible resource for her
self."
