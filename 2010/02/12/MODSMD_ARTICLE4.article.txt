## Green leads Stanford to last-minute win 
### HALEY MURPHY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For 30 minutes of play last night,
it looked as if the Cardinal might as
well have been playing in Pullman,
Wash, collapsing on the road under
the weight of a hostile environment
and a Pac-10 foe. But, for every
close game Stanford has dropped
on the road, the team has somehow
rallied for victories on the floor of
Maples Pavilion.
Last night, the home court ad
vantage saved the Card again. Stan
ford dropped to a significant early
deficit, but slowly clawed its way
back against Washington State, In
the end, the Card made its largest
comeback since Jan. 28, 2007
when it trailed UCLA by 19 to
finally winning the nail-biter
against the Cougars, 60-58.
In the battle with Washington
State, this season's trend of homes
tand redemption was challenged
closely by the Cougars (15-9, 5-7
Pac-10), who gave Stanford (11-13,
5-7) the contest's first bucket a
layup by senior forward Landry
Fields and not much more in the
opening period. Washington State
took off on a 19-4 run, and didn't
allow Stanford closer than five.
Cougar forward DeAngelo
Casto had nine of his eventual 15
before the break, and fellow guard
Klay Thompson added another
eight. Meanwhile, the Cardinal's
best responses came from the usual
suspects fields and sophomore
guard Jeremy Green with five and
six, respectively.
Green said that he, Fields and

the rest of the team tried not to let
poor shooting (33 percent) discour
age them.

"As a basketball player, you
have to always compete no matter
what is going on in the game," he
said. "Making baskets doesn't de
fine you as a player, so if the shot
isn't going, you've got to find other
ways to help the team. You've got to
keep competing."
By the half, though, Washington
State led 33-18, and Stanford went
into the locker room looking for
new energy and more than 18
points of offensive production
in the back half of the play.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins
said he used halftime to help the
team "settle" back into playing at
home, but that his pep talk was full
of more disappointment than
anger.

"[My] pep talk at halftime was
n't a loud one, to be quite frank,"
Dawkins said. "It was a little more
subdued. I was a little more disap
pointed with how we played the
first half, so it came across that way
instead of fire and brimstone."

"It was probably one of the first
times it hasn't been fire and brim
stone," he added with a laugh.

After Dawkins addressed the
players, Green said the team made
an executive decision to win, setting
a new tone for the second period.
"In the locker room, we all
talked it out and said we had no
choice but to win," said Green. "It
was mandatory. And we came out

18-point deficit and defeat Washington
State last night, 60-58. Sophomore Jere

Cardinal in the conference standings.

the second half."
Immediately after the break,
though, signs of life were few, far be
tween and brief. When Thompson
opened the half with a three that
could have been the nail in the coffin
for Stanford, senior guard Drew
Shiller responded with a long ball of
his own at 19:17, and followed it up
with a layup to earn five of his nine
points and his only two field goals
of the half during the two-minute
stretch.
Stanford then fizzled for nearly 10
minutes, not earning another field goal
until Green hit again from behind the
arc at 11:32.
Sloppy possessions from both
teams made production slow: the
Cougars shot only 41 percent on the
game, edged by Stanford's hard-to-be
lieve 47. The teams also finished with
11 and 17 turnovers, respectively, mak
ing play especially rough.
But, as the clock dwindled or oc
casionally didn't on a Washington
State possession at 10:06, when no one
seemed to notice the old ticker wasn't
working the Cardinal snuck back
into the game, finally breaking a dou
ble-digit lead with 9:18 to go.
Fields and Green spearheaded the
10-2 run to get Stanford there, culmi
nating in Fields' drive of a crowded
lane, collecting a bucket and a foul to
earn three the old-fashioned way.
Fields eventually finished with 15
points and nine boards, but the Cardi
nal got important additions from

Shiller (9 points), senior guard Em
manuel Igbinosa (5) and junior guard
Da'Veed Dildy (5).
More importantly, though, were
the efforts given by Igbinosa and soph
omore guard Jarrett Mann down the
stretch, holding the Cougars' key scor
ers, like Thompson and guard Reggie
Moore, at bay Moore finished with
only five points and keeping Wash
ington State scoreless from 7:27 to
1:49, in which time the Cardinal finally
took the lead.

At 5:31, Stanford really made it a
game. Igbinosa hit both free throws
from a transition foul by Thompson to
pull within five and Shiller earned two
more at the stripe 30 seconds later.
In the string of turnovers and fouls
that ensued, WSU's Casto missed his
own free throws at 4:32, opening the
door for the Card. In the doorway
stood Green, who picked one off at
other end, only to get the ball back on
Stanford's possession to hit a three
that put the Card up, 53-52.

Fouls and free throws continued to
fly, and Stanford hit an uncharacteris
tically impressive 10 of its last 11 from
the line to give the Cardinal an edge
down the stretch.

With 24 seconds to play, Dildy
broke the streak of made shots from
the line to keep the Cardinal's lead at
two, and Casto took full advantage,
tying the score at 58 with a dunk with
12 seconds left.

With the final possession, Stanford
turned to the game's steady hand,
Green, who already led the team with
22 points. It proved to be the right call,
as a screen by Fields left the guard
open for a long jumper, solidifying the
win for Stanford.

Despite the downs of the first half,

Dawkins was proud of the final
stretch, especially of Green's compo
sure on the final play.
"Jeremy Green at the end was ter
rific," he said. "I had a decision with 11
seconds: do I call a timeout or go with
the ball already in his hands? I decided
to go with the ball in his hands... and
I'm pretty proud of the outcome."
Green was also pretty proud of the
decision, and rightfully so.
"I was hoping [Dawkins] didn't call
a timeout," Green said. "I thought that
the defense was scrambling, they were
trying to get back, they were
backpedaling. I was just hoping to
make a play. Landry set a great screen,
got me open free for the J and I hit it.
.. I was surprised I was open and that
Landry's man didn't step up and help,
but that's their fault. So I made the
shot."
Landry's man, Thompson regret
ted the play as well, saying, "I was sup
posed to switch. I didn't. I just had a
bad lapse at the worst part of the
game."
"I thought it was a tale of two
halves," Dawkins reflected. "It was
similar to the game we played up at
Washington State [a 77-73 loss for
Stanford], They got out to another
great start, and our guys responded in
the second half and were able to whit
tle the lead down. And this time, fortu
nately, we were able to overcome."
Stanford will look to overcome
again on Saturday, though hopefully
not so narrowly. The team takes on
Washington who fell to Cal last
night, 93-81 at 5 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.

NOTES: Stanford rallied to overcome an
18-point deficit and defeat Washington
State last night, 60-58. Sophomore Jere
my Green carried the Cardinal with 24
points, including the game-winning bas
ket. The Card will now turn its attention
to Washington, which lost 93-81 to Cal
last night. The Huskies are 6-6 in the
Pac-10 and sit just a game ahead of the
Cardinal in the conference standings.
They will look to guard Quincy Pondex
ter to lead the offense against Stanford.

the second half."
Immediately after the break,
though, signs of life were few, far be
tween and brief. When Thompson
opened the half with a three that
could have been the nail in the coffin
for Stanford, senior guard Drew
Shiller responded with a long ball of
his own at 19:17, and followed it up
with a layup to earn five of his nine
points and his only two field goals
of the half during the two-minute
stretch.
Stanford then fizzled for nearly 10
minutes, not earning another field goal
until Green hit again from behind the
arc at 11:32.
Sloppy possessions from both
teams made production slow: the
Cougars shot only 41 percent on the
game, edged by Stanford's hard-to-be
lieve 47. The teams also finished with
11 and 17 turnovers, respectively, mak
ing play especially rough.
But, as the clock dwindled or oc
casionally didn't on a Washington
State possession at 10:06, when no one
seemed to notice the old ticker wasn't
working the Cardinal snuck back
into the game, finally breaking a dou
ble-digit lead with 9:18 to go.
Fields and Green spearheaded the
10-2 run to get Stanford there, culmi
nating in Fields' drive of a crowded
lane, collecting a bucket and a foul to
earn three the old-fashioned way.
Fields eventually finished with 15
points and nine boards, but the Cardi
nal got important additions from

Shiller (9 points), senior guard Em
manuel Igbinosa (5) and junior guard
Da'Veed Dildy (5).
More importantly, though, were
the efforts given by Igbinosa and soph
omore guard Jarrett Mann down the
stretch, holding the Cougars' key scor
ers, like Thompson and guard Reggie
Moore, at bay Moore finished with
only five points and keeping Wash
ington State scoreless from 7:27 to
1:49, in which time the Cardinal finally
took the lead.

At 5:31, Stanford really made it a
game. Igbinosa hit both free throws
from a transition foul by Thompson to
pull within five and Shiller earned two
more at the stripe 30 seconds later.
In the string of turnovers and fouls
that ensued, WSU's Casto missed his
own free throws at 4:32, opening the
door for the Card. In the doorway
stood Green, who picked one off at
other end, only to get the ball back on
Stanford's possession to hit a three
that put the Card up, 53-52.

Fouls and free throws continued to
fly, and Stanford hit an uncharacteris
tically impressive 10 of its last 11 from
the line to give the Cardinal an edge
down the stretch.

With 24 seconds to play, Dildy
broke the streak of made shots from
the line to keep the Cardinal's lead at
two, and Casto took full advantage,
tying the score at 58 with a dunk with
12 seconds left.

With the final possession, Stanford
turned to the game's steady hand,
Green, who already led the team with
22 points. It proved to be the right call,
as a screen by Fields left the guard
open for a long jumper, solidifying the
win for Stanford.

Despite the downs of the first half,

Dawkins was proud of the final
stretch, especially of Green's compo
sure on the final play.
"Jeremy Green at the end was ter
rific," he said. "I had a decision with 11
seconds: do I call a timeout or go with
the ball already in his hands? I decided
to go with the ball in his hands... and
I'm pretty proud of the outcome."
Green was also pretty proud of the
decision, and rightfully so.
"I was hoping [Dawkins] didn't call
a timeout," Green said. "I thought that
the defense was scrambling, they were
trying to get back, they were
backpedaling. I was just hoping to
make a play. Landry set a great screen,
got me open free for the J and I hit it.
.. I was surprised I was open and that
Landry's man didn't step up and help,
but that's their fault. So I made the
shot."
Landry's man, Thompson regret
ted the play as well, saying, "I was sup
posed to switch. I didn't. I just had a
bad lapse at the worst part of the
game."
"I thought it was a tale of two
halves," Dawkins reflected. "It was
similar to the game we played up at
Washington State [a 77-73 loss for
Stanford], They got out to another
great start, and our guys responded in
the second half and were able to whit
tle the lead down. And this time, fortu
nately, we were able to overcome."
Stanford will look to overcome
again on Saturday, though hopefully
not so narrowly. The team takes on
Washington who fell to Cal last
night, 93-81 at 5 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.

For 30 minutes of play last night,
it looked as if the Cardinal might as
well have been playing in Pullman,
Wash, collapsing on the road under
the weight of a hostile environment
and a Pac-10 foe. But, for every
close game Stanford has dropped
on the road, the team has somehow
rallied for victories on the floor of
Maples Pavilion.
Last night, the home court ad
vantage saved the Card again. Stan
ford dropped to a significant early
deficit, but slowly clawed its way
back against Washington State, In
the end, the Card made its largest
comeback since Jan. 28, 2007
when it trailed UCLA by 19 to
finally winning the nail-biter
against the Cougars, 60-58.
In the battle with Washington
State, this season's trend of homes
tand redemption was challenged
closely by the Cougars (15-9, 5-7
Pac-10), who gave Stanford (11-13,
5-7) the contest's first bucket a
layup by senior forward Landry
Fields and not much more in the
opening period. Washington State
took off on a 19-4 run, and didn't
allow Stanford closer than five.
Cougar forward DeAngelo
Casto had nine of his eventual 15
before the break, and fellow guard
Klay Thompson added another
eight. Meanwhile, the Cardinal's
best responses came from the usual
suspects fields and sophomore
guard Jeremy Green with five and
six, respectively.
Green said that he, Fields and

the rest of the team tried not to let
poor shooting (33 percent) discour
age them.

"As a basketball player, you
have to always compete no matter
what is going on in the game," he
said. "Making baskets doesn't de
fine you as a player, so if the shot
isn't going, you've got to find other
ways to help the team. You've got to
keep competing."
By the half, though, Washington
State led 33-18, and Stanford went
into the locker room looking for
new energy and more than 18
points of offensive production
in the back half of the play.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins
said he used halftime to help the
team "settle" back into playing at
home, but that his pep talk was full
of more disappointment than
anger.

"[My] pep talk at halftime was
n't a loud one, to be quite frank,"
Dawkins said. "It was a little more
subdued. I was a little more disap
pointed with how we played the
first half, so it came across that way
instead of fire and brimstone."

"It was probably one of the first
times it hasn't been fire and brim
stone," he added with a laugh.

After Dawkins addressed the
players, Green said the team made
an executive decision to win, setting
a new tone for the second period.
"In the locker room, we all
talked it out and said we had no
choice but to win," said Green. "It
was mandatory. And we came out
and had a better performance in
