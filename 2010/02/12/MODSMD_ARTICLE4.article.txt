## Green leads Stanford to last-minute win 
### HALEY MURPHY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For 30 minutes of play last night,
it looked as if the Cardinal might as
well have been playing in Pullman,
Wash, collapsing on the road under
the weight of a hostile environment
and a Pac-10 foe. But, for every
close game Stanford has dropped
on the road, the team has somehow
rallied for victories on the floor of
Maples Pavilion.
Last night, the home court ad
vantage saved the Card again. Stan
ford dropped to a significant early
deficit, but slowly clawed its way
back against Washington State, In
the end, the Card made its largest
comeback since Jan. 28, 2007
when it trailed UCLA by 19 to
finally winning the nail-biter
against the Cougars, 60-58.
In the battle with Washington
State, this season's trend of homes
tand redemption was challenged
closely by the Cougars (15-9, 5-7
Pac-10), who gave Stanford (11-13,
5-7) the contest's first bucket a
layup by senior forward Landry
Fields and not much more in the
opening period. Washington State
took off on a 19-4 run, and didn't
allow Stanford closer than five.
Cougar forward DeAngelo
Casto had nine of his eventual 15
before the break, and fellow guard
Klay Thompson added another
eight. Meanwhile, the Cardinal's
best responses came from the usual
suspects fields and sophomore
guard Jeremy Green with five and
six, respectively.
Green said that he, Fields and

the rest of the team tried not to let
poor shooting (33 percent) discour
age them.

"As a basketball player, you
have to always compete no matter
what is going on in the game," he
said. "Making baskets doesn't de
fine you as a player, so if the shot
isn't going, you've got to find other
ways to help the team. You've got to
keep competing."
By the half, though, Washington
State led 33-18, and Stanford went
into the locker room looking for
new energy and more than 18
points of offensive production
in the back half of the play.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins
said he used halftime to help the
team "settle" back into playing at
home, but that his pep talk was full
of more disappointment than
anger.

"[My] pep talk at halftime was
n't a loud one, to be quite frank,"
Dawkins said. "It was a little more
subdued. I was a little more disap
pointed with how we played the
first half, so it came across that way
instead of fire and brimstone."

"It was probably one of the first
times it hasn't been fire and brim
stone," he added with a laugh.

After Dawkins addressed the
players, Green said the team made
an executive decision to win, setting
a new tone for the second period.
"In the locker room, we all
talked it out and said we had no
choice but to win," said Green. "It
was mandatory. And we came out
and had a better performance in
