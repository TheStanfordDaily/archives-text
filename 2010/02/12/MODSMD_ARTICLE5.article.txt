# APPLE STATE SWING
## Cardinal looks to stay perfect in Pac-10 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The postseason is officially
looming next week, the Cardinal
will be able to count the number of
remaining regular season games on
a single hand. Hungry for a champi
onship after falling to UConn in the
Final Four last year, No. 2 Stanford
can take some big steps toward get
ting in tournament shape and
clinching a 10th consecutive Pac-10
regular season title this weekend as
it heads north to take on Washing
ton (9-12,4-7 Pac-10) and Washing
ton State (6-16,1-10).
The two-game series marks the
penultimate road trip for the Cardi
nal (21-1, 11-0), which swept sec
ond-place UCLA and third-place
Southern California last weekend.
With a three-game cushion over the
Bruins and only seven games re
maining in the season, every win is
critical for Stanford to stay in top
form and maintain a strong seed
throughout the postseason.
"This is a big weekend for us,
going up to Washington," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Washington and Washington State
aren't in the race, so to speak, but
they can knock us out of the race.
We've got to keep improving.That's
what I'd like to see, just come out
and be aggressive, and come out
and play really hard and improve.
"Everything we're doing now
has to be geared to helping us do

well in the NCAA tournament and
sharpening up our offense, really
making sure we're boxing out on
every play, tweaking little things
and running our out-of-bounds
plays better," she continued.
There may be plenty of areas in
which Stanford would like to im
prove in the coming weeks, but the
team has already come a long way
from some of the struggles that
began in January. The Cardinal had
a few close calls and unimpressive

NOIES ! The No. 2 women's basketball team
will look to remain undefeated in Pac-10
conference play this weekend. Senior center
Jayne Appel, who recently became Stanford's
all-time leader in rebounds, will lead the Car
dinal's attack. Stanford will also look to for
wards Kayla Pedersen and Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike to drive the offense. Washington is cur
rently reeling, having lost six of its last seven
games, while Washington State scored its first
Pac-10 win of the season last weekend
against Arizona State.

The Cardinal women will face the Washington schools on
the road this weekend. Stanford's only loss this season
came away from Maples Pavilion at No. 1 Connecticut.


games over that stretch, including a
65-61 win over UCLA and two
games against the Arizona schools
in which Stanford trailed at half
time. The team looked much
stronger last weekend in fact,
three starters (senior center Jayne
Appel, junior forward Kayla Peter
sen and sophomore forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike) had double
doubles against USC on Sunday.
"You never want to be the team
that is playing the best in January,
because it is kind of hard to keep
improving," Appel said. "I think it
slowly turned into a blessing for us
that we weren't playing so well [last
month], because we had something
to build on."
Stanford may have received an
extra inspirational spark last week
end when VanDerveer's 1989-1990
national championship team came
to speak with the current Cardinal
squad.
"I thought it was great for the '9O
team to come back . . . for our
young team to meet them and talk
with them," VanDerveer said. "I
think it did make a really positive
impression. We had a very spirited
practice [Tuesday], and I saw peo
ple being aggressive and really con
centrating on doing what we asked
them to do."
Moving forward, the Cardinal's
first opponent of the weekend is
Washington. The Huskies fell to the
Cardinal last month at Maples
Pavilion, 66-51. Despite the com
fortable margin of victory and
the conference-record 112-35 drub
bing her team handed the Huskies
last season VanDerveer gives re
spect to head coach Tia Jackson's
squad.
"We need to do a better job
against their zone defense especial
ly," she emphasized. "Last time they
played us in a zone, and we didn't
attack as well. We weren't as aggres
sive as we needed to be."
The Huskies, led by Sami Whit
comb (14.6 points per game, 6.0 re
bounds per game) and Kristi King
ma (9.2 ppg, 2.7 rpg), had a solid
start to the Pac-10 season, winning
three of their first four games.
Things went badly after their trip to
the Bay Area, and Washington has
lost six of its past seven games.

On Sunday, the Cardinal will
head east to Pullman, Wash, for a
matchup with Washington State.
The Cougars have struggled im
mensely in the conference season,
but won their last game against Ari
zona State, 66-62. Guard April
Cook scored 33 points, accounting
for exactly half of her team's of
fense, and earned Pac-10 Player of
the Week honors.

"Cook's a great player, and
they're a dangerous team and
they're a young team," VanDerveer
said. "They're not intimidated
they come out and play hard. They
don't have the expectation to win a
lot of games necessarily they're
young but they're athletic and
they can knock down shots, and
hopefully they can earn some more
fans up there."
The Cardinal played their previ
ous two contests against the Wash
ington schools with limited contri
butions from junior guard Jeanette
Pohlen, who suffered a freak injury
to her right ankle against the
Cougars. She only played 11 min
utes that weekend, missing her first
game in her team's previous 92. For
tunately for Stanford, Pohlen
currently second in the Pac-10 with
4.52 assists per game was ready
to go the following weekend and re
mains healthy.

"We missed Jeanette a lot in
those games," VanDerveer said.
"Obviously it was a good experi
ence [for some of the bench play
ers], but we didn't have the pace of
the game or the enthusiasm we do
when Jeanette is out there leading
the way."

In addition to Pohlen, two criti
cal players for the Cardinal this
weekend will be Appel, the reigning
Pac-10 Player of the Year, and red
shirt senior guard Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude. In the last year of NCAA
basketball for both, the duo has
been heating up recently. Appel
posted double-doubles in both
games last weekend, while Gold-
Onwude averaged 12.5 points and
shot 71.4 percent from the floor.
She also played solid defense, hold
ing her counterparts UCLA's
Jasmine Dixon and USC's Ashley
Corral to poor shooting days.
When asked if Gold-Onwude is

playing the best basketball of her
soon-to-be-over college career,
VanDerveer's opinion was clear.

"Yes, I do," she said. "The num
ber one thing is her confidence, and
she's not making what I affection
ately refer to as 'knuckle-headed
plays.' She's making better deci
sions. I'll tell you right now, I think
she is hands-down the Defensive
Player of the Year. She guards peo
ple and she gets after it."
"And now she's hitting her shots
and getting the ball inside," she con
tinued. "She's running the floor and
she's practicing harder. And she's
playing with confidence and feeling
some urgency, which seniors do .. .
she's being a leader and doing a
great job for us."
Appel has been a dominant
force on offense recently, earning
her eighth and ninth double-dou
bles of the year last weekend while
averaging 19 points and 13 re
bounds over the two games. Those
marks are both well above her sea
son averages of 13.1 ppg and 9.6
rpg-

Against USC, she passed Nicole
Powell's school rebounding record,
reaching a total of 1,153 boards.
Oddly enough, Appel may be de
veloping yet another offensive tool
as her college career winds down
better accuracy from outside the
paint. The six-foot-four center took
a pair of shots from the top of the
key against the Trojans on Sunday,
making one and narrowly missing
the other.

"[The long shot is] definitely
something I've been working on the
past couple of weeks, I've been try
ing to develop that," Appel said.
"But I wouldn't say that is my first
option. But it is a good thing that I
took two outside shots and made
one of them, so that does kind of get
that into the opponent's mind that
they have to step out."
Appel, Gold-Onwude and the
rest of the Cardinal women will
look to continue building momen
tum tonight at 7 p.m., when they
take on Washington in Seattle. They
will face Washington State at noon
on Sunday in Pullman.
