## Cardinal looks to stay perfect in Pac-10 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The postseason is officially
looming next week, the Cardinal
will be able to count the number of
remaining regular season games on
a single hand. Hungry for a champi
onship after falling to UConn in the
Final Four last year, No. 2 Stanford
can take some big steps toward get
ting in tournament shape and
clinching a 10th consecutive Pac-10
regular season title this weekend as
it heads north to take on Washing
ton (9-12,4-7 Pac-10) and Washing
ton State (6-16,1-10).
The two-game series marks the
penultimate road trip for the Cardi
nal (21-1, 11-0), which swept sec
ond-place UCLA and third-place
Southern California last weekend.
With a three-game cushion over the
Bruins and only seven games re
maining in the season, every win is
critical for Stanford to stay in top
form and maintain a strong seed
throughout the postseason.
"This is a big weekend for us,
going up to Washington," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Washington and Washington State
aren't in the race, so to speak, but
they can knock us out of the race.
We've got to keep improving.That's
what I'd like to see, just come out
and be aggressive, and come out
and play really hard and improve.
"Everything we're doing now
has to be geared to helping us do

well in the NCAA tournament and
sharpening up our offense, really
making sure we're boxing out on
every play, tweaking little things
and running our out-of-bounds
plays better," she continued.
There may be plenty of areas in
which Stanford would like to im
prove in the coming weeks, but the
team has already come a long way
from some of the struggles that
began in January. The Cardinal had
a few close calls and unimpressive

NOIES ! The No. 2 women's basketball team
will look to remain undefeated in Pac-10
conference play this weekend. Senior center
Jayne Appel, who recently became Stanford's
all-time leader in rebounds, will lead the Car
dinal's attack. Stanford will also look to for
wards Kayla Pedersen and Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike to drive the offense. Washington is cur
rently reeling, having lost six of its last seven
games, while Washington State scored its first
