## Top Ranked Gauntlet Stanford set to face two top-10 MPSF foes on the Farm 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball team has
a big weekend ahead.
The Card, which will face two conference
foes this weekend in No. 3 UCLA and No. 11
UC-Irvine,is looking to capitalize on its momen
tum from two big wins last weekend over Pacif
ic and UC-Santa Cruz. The win over Pacific was
vital, as it snapped a two-match conference-los
ing streak and got Stanford back on track in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF).
However, this weekend will bring bigger
challenges in the form of the Bruins and the
Anteaters.The Bruins have won five of their last
six MPSF matches, including two wins over No.
8 Hawaii and a sweep of No. 1 Cal State North
ridge.
This weekend the Cardinal will look to capi
talize on home-court advantage to earn MPSF
wins over two ranked opponents. In a confer
ence as strong as the MPSF, which boasts the
country's top eight teams, every win counts for
the Card, which will play nine of its last 13 con
ference matches on the road.
The UCLA match also brings intrigue in the
form of a sibling rivalry. Cardinal freshman out
side hitter Myles Muagututia is the younger
brother of one of UCLA's stars, senior outside
hitter Garrett Muagututia. The elder
Muagututia earned MPSF Player of the
Week honors last week after he pounded 46
kills in a two-match road trip to Hawaii,
while the younger achieved a new career
high with 12 kills for the Card in the win over
the Banana Slugs last Friday.
The Bruins are also led by redshirt soph
omore opposite Jack Poales, who is second
on the team to Muagututia with 3.7 kills per
set, and senior setter Kevin Kerr, who leads
the team with 9.12 assists per set.
While the focus may be on the UCLA
match, with the sibling storyline and the
clash of two top-five teams, the Irvine match
promises to be a thriller as well. The
Anteaters have struggled through some
hard times recently. They just broke a six
match conference-losing streak with a win
against BYU last Saturday, but still remem
ber better times.
Just last year, UC-Irvine was crowned na
tional champion after beating USC, and al
though this is a rebuilding year after losing
five seniors to graduation, the Anteaters re
main a formidable force with lots of young
talent.
The team is led by its three returning All-
Americans, sophomore opposite Carson
Clark, sophomore middle blocker Kevin
Wynne and sophomore outside hitter Jor
dan DuFault. Clark was the MPSF Fresh
man of the Year last year and is averaging 5.2
kills per set for the Anteaters this season.
While the challenges these teams present
may seem intimidating, Stanford has a few
tricks up its sleeve.
The Cardinal boasts the conference lead
ers in many statistical categories, including
senior setter Kawika Shoji in assists per

game and sophomore middle blocker Gus
Ellis in blocks per game.
Against Pacific and Santa Cruz, the Car
dinal utilized its strong offense by serving
and passing well, and will likely look to do
the same against the Bruins and Anteaters
this weekend. Additionally, the Cardinal will
look to end its six-game homestand strongly,
with wins this weekend making close losses
to UCSB and Cal State Northridge two
weekends ago a distant memory.
The Cardinal will take on the Bruins
tonight at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion and will
switch to the smaller, more rowdy atmos
phere of Burnham Pavilion for Saturday's
contest against Irvine, also at 7 p.m.

Sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson, above right, will be a key factor in Stanford's effort to notch two
more MPSF wins this weekend. Along with senior opposite Evan Romero, Lawson will be tasked with
providing the bulk of the Cardinal's offensive firepower against UCLA and UC-Irvine.
