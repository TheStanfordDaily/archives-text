## NEWS BRIEFS Court ruling clears way for University trails project 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kate Abbott Adam Cole 
The California Supreme Court
ruled Thursday that the building
process could resume by Stanford
on two pedestrian trails, one of
which will be located south of Page
Mill Road. Building of the pedestri
an trail came to a halt following a
lawsuit by the Committee for
Green Foothills in 2006.
The Committee for Green
Foothills, an environmental watch
dog group, filed suit following an
agreement between the University
and Santa Clara County pertaining
to trail alignment.

The trails are part of a deal
made between Santa Clara County
and Stanford in 2000. Stanford
started construction of the first
trail, located south of Page Mill
Road, but when the University
tried to move the second trail
across Alpine Road into San Mateo
County, Green Foothills raised con
cerns about the effect on land near
a local creek.
The group cited concerns about
a proper environmental assessment
before a decision was made to
move the trail to the opposite side
of the road.
The court today declared that
the lawsuit was invalid because it
was filed months after the statute of
limitations expired.
Larry Horton, senior associate
vice president for public affairs at
Stanford, said Stanford will move
ahead with the project, which now
needs approval by the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors.
