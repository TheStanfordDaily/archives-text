## Stanford Web pages experience problems 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Campus web pages suffered
"degraded service" Thursday after IT
Services staff said they experienced
problems with a network traffic
shaping device.

The problems began at 7:37 a.m.,
when a software patch applied
overnight to correct other problems
with the device's performance caused
an "unexpected degradation of net
work performance," according to
Matthew Ricks, the executive direc
tor of IT Services, in an e-mail to The
Daily. As a result, the University's
Web traffic came to a "crawl."
"During the disruption ...

University Web pages would not load
and in some cases e-mail service was
disrupted," Ricks said. "The disrup
tion effected [sic] those attempting to
access Stanford Web pages from
campus as well as off-campus com
puters."
Visitors to some Stanford Web
sites on Thursday encountered an
error message stating that the site
was operating on "emergency mode"
and that the page was not available.
IT Services posted a message stating
that it was working to resolve the
problem, and that there was no emer
gency situation on campus.
The network-shaping device is
used to fairly and evenly allocate
bandwidth to support Stanford's
Internet traffic needs.
