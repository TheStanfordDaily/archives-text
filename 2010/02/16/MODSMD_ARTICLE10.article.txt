# The 						snark side of "New Moon"
## 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
It's Valentine's Day, and a new
moon is rising tonight. No, seriously
check your calendar. It's almost
fitting, since it's quite a stretch to
claim that the warped emotional
logic behind Twilight's "New
Moon" qualifies the movie as a cel
ebration of love. It's more comfort
ing to think that Flicks chose to
play it on Sunday night to celebrate
the lunar cycle instead.

As Stanford's cream of the hard
core crop began prepping for a
third weekend night out, students
with less stamina and far less digni
ty headed over to Memorial
Auditorium to experience the
nightmarish sophomore installment
of the Twilight franchise, apparently
under the guise that it was roman
tic.

For a film whose fan base con
sists mostly of vapid, twitter-pated
girls and their devoted (read:
whipped) boyfriends and at a
school whose admissions office usu
ally tries not to accept said speci
mens the auditorium was sur
prisingly full of students who claim
to be seeing the movie "ironically."
Let's give them the benefit of the
doubt.

At 8 p.m., the lights dim, and a
hush falls over the crowd. As the
title slowly dissolves from the
screen, the eerie background music
is punctuated by the distinct clink
of bottles in the audience the
writer will neither confirm nor deny
contributing.

For those unfamiliar with the
film or its predecessor, the casual
observer can use the evidence pre
sented to deduce several important
things regarding human-vampire
werewolf interactions. Vampires are
pale. They glitter in the sun, and
when they walk toward you pur
posefully, time slows a bit and dra
matic music begins to play.
Everyone is aware of their condi
tion but it is never a problem until
the plot needs thickening. Think of
it like cornstarch for screenplays.
Regarding Bella, it quickly
becomes clear that there are sever
al ways to a man's heart. Bite your

lip, sullenly and often the unoffi
cial tally for New Moon clocks in at
about 18 individual instances of
bottom-lip-to-tooth contact. Flirt
with younger men and older men
on motorcycles. Run around in the
woods best if you're alone and
without a map. Blink like a butter
fly and fall dramatically to the
ground every once in a while for
good measure. And you must
remember to share your sharp witti
cisms with the world for exam
ple, "Hello, biceps" and "Jacob,
you're, like, buff."
Thirty minutes in, Edward is in
Bella's room, creepily stroking her
belongings no, wait, just kidding,
now he's in the woods wearing a
nice suit. He turns to Bella, and with
wrinkled, tortured brow, tells her
he's leaving. Five second pause. "I'm
coming," she says, with equally con
stipated countenance. Three sec
onds. "I don't want you to come."
Cue inappropriate —or appropri
ate laughter.
After he leaves, Bella collapses
of exhaustion and is saved by a
shirtless man with prominent pecs.
She's received with gratitude and no
questioning about the sketchy
nature of the rescue. Once she's
home, she expresses her grief
through a rotating camera shot and
a time warp montage of Hallmark -
esque seasons passing.
"I'm dizzy," said Jackie Lho 'll,
trying to track the cinematography.
Jacob finally displays his pecs
er, talents in the climactic scene
when he helps Bella after the
motorcycle crash. As the crowd
jeers, "Take off your shirt!" and
whoops with glee when the were
wolf willingly obliges, several linger
ing cheers of "Take off your shirt,
Bella!" float up from the crowd
futile attempts to salvage masculine
dignity. Too late, guys sorry.

9:30 p.m. The film trudges along
Bella screams a lot, she tries to
drown herself what she calls
"rccreationallv cliff diving" and a
nearby group of spectators gets into
a spirited argument about whether
or not Jacob's high-rising shorts are
indeed jorts and not just basketball
shorts. The crowd laughs as Jacob
explains his lycanthropy, saying, "It's
not a lifestyle choice I was born
this way." Interesting choice of
words from the conservative
Mormon author.
Following the franchise's pen
chant for underhanded references
to sexual tension, Jacob growls to
Bella, "You don't even know how
tight I'm wound" subtle. The cou

pie then proceeds to almost, almost
kiss, and as they break apart, some
one shouts angrily, "Grow a pair!"
What a letdown.
All of a sudden, the scene switch
es to Italy, and Bella is running fran
tically through a crowd of red
cloaks. A nearby girl asks loudly,
"Wait, where's Jacob?" and some
one shouts back, "He's at the gym!"
After the red cloaks comes a
very strange series of events in a
possible homage to Stanford, Bella
briefly fountain-hops —in slo-mo!
on her way to "save" Edward
from the sun's rays, and then
Dakota Fanning appears and takes
everyone on the most awkward ele
vator ride .. . ever. Eventually
everything rises to a climactic fight,
during which Edward's face cracks
and instantly heals. Who knew?
The denouement proceeds with
less action and equal disturbing
ness Edward agrees to "change"
Bella into a vampire on the condi
tion that they will marry first. Keep
in mind that she is 18 and he is 17
or 109, depending on your point of
view so it's either pedophilia or
statutory rape.
Audiences, despite the negative
stigma surrounding the film's quali
ty, expressed enthusiasm as they
gathered their belongings (read:
flasks) and filed (read: stumbled)
out of the auditorium.
"It was so thrilling," said staunch
Team Edward supporter Ericka
Sohlberg 'll. "I was so moved by
Edward's pain that I wanted to rip
off my own clothes in tandem with
his own shirt-ripping."
