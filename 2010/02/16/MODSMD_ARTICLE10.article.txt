# The
						snark side of "New Moon"

### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
It's Valentine's Day, and a new
moon is rising tonight. No, seriously
check your calendar. It's almost
fitting, since it's quite a stretch to
claim that the warped emotional
logic behind Twilight's "New
Moon" qualifies the movie as a cel
ebration of love. It's more comfort
ing to think that Flicks chose to
play it on Sunday night to celebrate
the lunar cycle instead.

As Stanford's cream of the hard
core crop began prepping for a
third weekend night out, students
with less stamina and far less digni
ty headed over to Memorial
Auditorium to experience the
nightmarish sophomore installment
of the Twilight franchise, apparently
under the guise that it was roman
tic.

For a film whose fan base con
sists mostly of vapid, twitter-pated
girls and their devoted (read:
whipped) boyfriends and at a
school whose admissions office usu
ally tries not to accept said speci
mens the auditorium was sur
prisingly full of students who claim
to be seeing the movie "ironically."
Let's give them the benefit of the
doubt.

At 8 p.m., the lights dim, and a
hush falls over the crowd. As the
title slowly dissolves from the
screen, the eerie background music
is punctuated by the distinct clink
of bottles in the audience the
writer will neither confirm nor deny
contributing.

For those unfamiliar with the
film or its predecessor, the casual
observer can use the evidence pre
sented to deduce several important
things regarding human-vampire
werewolf interactions. Vampires are
pale. They glitter in the sun, and
when they walk toward you pur
posefully, time slows a bit and dra
matic music begins to play.
Everyone is aware of their condi
tion but it is never a problem until
the plot needs thickening. Think of
it like cornstarch for screenplays.
Regarding Bella, it quickly
becomes clear that there are sever
al ways to a man's heart. Bite your

lip, sullenly and often the unoffi
cial tally for New Moon clocks in at
about 18 individual instances of
bottom-lip-to-tooth contact. Flirt
with younger men and older men
on motorcycles. Run around in the
woods best if you're alone and
without a map. Blink like a butter
fly and fall dramatically to the
ground every once in a while for
