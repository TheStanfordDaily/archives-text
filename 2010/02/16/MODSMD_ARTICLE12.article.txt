## Researchers release GAD study 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
People with Generalized Anxiety
Disorder (GAD) suffer from abnor
malities in the way their brains con
trol negative emotions, a new
Stanford School of Medicine study
found. These findings lend insight
into how to better treat the disorder.
According to Amit Etkin, a pro
fessor in the School of Medicine,
anxiety is normally healthy and
adaptive. Patients are diagnosed
with GAD only when their worries
are "frequent, pervasive and uncon
trolled."
Moreover, patients suffering
from GAD tend to avoid things that
make the anxiety worse.
"An example is interpersonal
conflict," Etkin stated. "Someone
may have said something negative
and it may take [the GAD patient]
hours of the day before they can get
back to rebut their point. They're
just unable to deal with the negative
emotions and their mind just spins
and spins. They have a deficit in reg
ulating emotion."
Through the use of functional
magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), away of monitoring brain
activity by registering blood flow to
active parts of the brain, Etkin and
his team of scientists examined a
part of the brain called the amyg
dala in 17 GAD patients and 24
healthy comparison subjects.
During the scan, the participants
were shown a series of pictures of
happy or fearful faces overlaid with
the word "fear" or "happy." To cre
ate a sense of emotional conflict

among participants, the words and
faces did not always match.
When the face and accompany
ing adjective did not match up, sub
jects took longer to identify the cor
rect expression. The study found
that healthy participants were able
to adapt to the change quickly rela
tive to GAD patients, who struggled
when the preceding image was also
incongruent.
A previous study published by
Etkin in 2009 determined that the
function of the amygdala region is
altered in patients diagnosed with
GAD.
According to this year's study,
the pregenual anterior cingulate,
located in the prefrontal cortex at
the front of the brain, lights up dur
ing times of emotional conflict
among non-GAD patients to inhibit
the amygdala, but fails to do so in
GAD patients' brains.
"[The amygdala] has been better
studied in animals," Etkin said. "We
wanted to study it more in detail in
people."
These results are expected to
lead to better diagnosis of anxiety
disorders and the development of
more effective strategies to deal
with these disorders. Understanding
and analyzing GAD is important for
advancements in treatment.
"fMRI-using tasks like this that
Amit [Etkin] developed and uses
here could potentially be used not
only as a probe to assess treatment
efficacy, but also as biomarkers to
predict prognosis and who may
respond to particular treatments
such as psychotherapy," wrote
Fumiko Hoeft, a psychiatry and

behavioral sciences instructor in the
School of Medicine, in an e-mail to
The Daily.

A chronic disease, GAD can
affect anyone, regardless of socioe
conomic status, race or educational
background. According to Ronald
Albucher, the director of
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), approximately 13
percent of Stanford students seek
help at CAPS. Anxiety is one of the
top four reasons why they visit,
along with depression, relationship
problems and self-esteem issues.
"There were plenty of Stanford
students in the study," Etkin said.
"We recruited all over the place."
"There is no doubt that the envi
ronment at Stanford, like any other
college, can contribute to worsening
the symptoms [of anxiety]," Etkins
added.
Nationally, 18 percent of
Americans have an anxiety disor
der, according to the National
Institute of Mental Health.
"We know that anxiety disorders
are one of the most common psychi
atric disorders," Albucher said. "The
top and most common ones are anx
iety and depression."
"These results make sense," he
added. "We often see that anxiety
leads up to depression, so if they are
unable to regulate negative emo
tions then that explains the path
leading to depression."
