## JUST A THOUGHT Anonymity makes us honest 
### Nikola Milanovic 
There are a lot of smart people at Stan
ford. I like that. But hey, I'm an intel
lectual elitist who finds common peo
ples' discourse to be banal and irritating. For
this reason, I was somewhat surprised to find
out about two Web sites: College ACB (col
legeacb.com/sb/Stanford) and Good Crush
(stanford.goodcrush.com).
For those who don't know, College ACB is
the extension of the old Web site Juicy Cam
pus, which existed as an anonymous forum
for college students to post gossip or initiate
slanderous smear campaigns. Because I am a
manipulative social engineer, I was thrilled at
the prospect of having an Internet source to
update me on my campus gossip, and this
Web site promised to give me intimate de
tails into peoples' lives that I could then
leverage against them for my own social gain.
Sadly, though, I found that the site was
being used for a very different purpose. Col
lege ACB essentially offers an electronic for
mat of what is available to students on Stan
ford's restroom walls. To clarify, whenever I
require a dose of racism and middle school
sexual humor unavailable to me in most cam
pus discourse, I go to the bathroom. Written
in marker on the walls of most stalls, one will
normally find conversations and diatribes
heavily peppered with racial slurs, genital ref
erences and sketches of fellatio. (I'm hopeful
that this only applies to men's restrooms.)
This is only surprising to me because we
go to Stanford, the paragon of politically cor
rect tolerance and diversity among the San
Jose-area private university set. The surpris
ing dialogue on our bathroom walls is noth
ing in comparison to College ACB. Included
in the discussion topics are "Who is the slut
tiest girl on campus," "Mexicans: why do they
always smell like burritos" and "Who wants
to blow me in Zapata's 2nd floor bathroom?"
These are conversations between Stanford
students.
It is fair to assume that because we go to
such a progressive university we have the
privilege of being isolated from idiots. I guess
that is not true. College ACB provides a win
dow into the intellectual maturity of some
Stanford students. Your good friends, your
RA or the smart fellow sitting next to you in
lecture might be the very same people rank
ing the sororities by sexual promiscuity or
imploring Latinos to "go sell some strawber
ries on campus drive."
Is it troubling that these same students are
the future intellectual leaders of the world?
This caliber of dialogue would be unsurpris
ing in a trailer park, but among Stanford stu-

dents it is shocking to realize such a subset
exists. People here are supposed to be really
smart and therefore above this.
Less disheartening and more innocent is
Good Crush. This Web site offers a similarly
revealing glimpse into the anonymous world
of student interactions. It allows users to
anonymously e-mail an invitation to their
crushes, who can then join the Web site and
list their own crushes. The initial user is then
notified of a match. The site also has a missed
connections forum, where students can pine
for each other and express their disappoint
ment at not having connected.
Good Crush does not seem to be populat
ed by the same uninventive morons who troll
College ACB. Instead, most missed connec
tions discourse is rather witty, such as that of
the girl who noticed an attractive boy at
Wushu practice: "Spotted: Boy with sharp
moves. Will you let me play with your sword?
I want to handle it with as much finesse as
you."
The two Web sites demonstrate an in
escapable truth about ourselves and people
in general: anonymity makes us very honest.
The absence of personal repercussions for
admissions made on bathroom walls and on
line forums gives people the ability to freely
express themselves. Turns out that "express
ing oneself" to some Stanford students
means either openly indulging in racism and
gratuitous sexual references or hoping
that the cute girl or guy in lecture has an in
terest in missed connections Web sites that
will bring you two together.
This is not to condemn either of the two
Web sites. Good Crush, if anything, presents a
positive tool for patching the gaps in our ex
istences as billiard balls bouncing off one an
other. I have misgivings about acknowledg
ing the contribution of College ACB to cam
pus life, but ultimately I believe that the exis
tence of an open forum that allows us to see
who we really share our school with is a pos
itive. And it turns out that maybe honesty
isn't the best policy.

Nikola Milanovic is a funny name. Ask him
