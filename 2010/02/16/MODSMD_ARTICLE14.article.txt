## Curbing Transphobic Humor in Stanford Performances 
### JANANI BALASUBRAMANIAN '12 
As a queer activist, I am delighted to
see Stanford's live arts groups more
aware than ever of how they deal with
jokes around sexual orientation. For the
most part, I can see them making a conscious
effort to curb heterosexist remarks and
humor in their dialog and skits. Of course, I
still see assertion of hyper-masculinity
through the rejection of gayness, the pigeon
holing of lesbians as stone butches, and the
use of female bisexuals as fodder for straight
male fantasies. We operate in a framework
where heterosexuality is the norm and often
our ideas about attraction and sexuality go
unquestioned. Accordingly, all these tropes,
and more, are still used I just see them de
creasing in frequency. Instead, I'm seeing
now a different, alarming trend: Stanford arts
groups are using gender identity as a source
of humor.

Perhaps I should offer some examples. I
have seen shows that used men dressed in
wigs and high heels as stand-ins for "really
ugly girls." This type of drag is not playful,
and insults both women and trans women. (A
note to my readers: trans is an abbreviation
of transgender, which is an umbrella term
that encompasses anything outside of the
norm that dictates that XY-chromosomed
people must be men and XX-chromosomed
people, women. Trans women, then, refers to
individuals born biologically male but identi
fy as women, regardless of their surgical sta
tus). I have seen skits that imply that athletic,
overly masculine women "have more balls"
than many of their male companions. I have
seen dialogs in which the "dangerous sur
prise" a girl was hiding from her male partner
was that she was biologically male. I have
seen too many performances that focus on
guessing at or questioning an individual's
gender based on the presence of a mustache
or certain body characteristics. Yes, these are
only instances of theatrical groups showing
off their creativity, but in doing so they deval
ue the identities of several members of our
community.

I am not one to curb free sexual expres
sion, or put a damper on anyone's fun. I think
a certain level of gender transgression (or
gender****ing as it's often called) and ques
tioning can be a free-spirited and quite

healthy part of an artist's repertoire. Let me
say that another way: gender-play can be fab
ulous. Stanford's Queer-Straight Alliance
each year hosts Genderf?k, a drag show gala
which is indeed fabulous. But the difference
here is that Genderf?k probes and decon
structs the gender binary (the idea that gen
der only comes in two flavors: man and
woman), while less self-aware performances
only reinforce hurtful norms. And the most
insidious part of this kind of transphobia is
that it largely goes unchallenged, and most of
us don't even register it as a fundamentally
offensive.

Everyone is negatively affected by gen
der policing in media and performances.
Perpetuating ideas about gender norms
boxes us in, and makes us believe there is
only one right way to be a man or woman.
Yet these norms disproportionately impact
queer people, and especially trans-folk. Last
week was transgender awareness week on
campus, hosted by the Emma Goldman So
ciety for Queer Liberation. One of the
guidelines discussed for being a better trans
ally was not to tolerate transphobic remarks
or humor in public spaces. We would not tol
erate outwardly racist, homophobic, or sex
ist comments in our performances (I hope),
so why should transphobic ones be treated
any differently?

I realize that gender norms are deeply en
trenched in our culture, and that many of us
don't give them a second thought on a day
to-day basis. I'm not asking that everyone im
mediately break out of this framework
(though that would be wonderful!). I am just
hoping to highlight several instances of trans
phobia on our campus. This is a case where
we can take immediate action. If you or your
friends are in performing arts groups, I ask
that you speak up when you know that some
thing is off and the gender jokes have gone
too far. If you are uncertain whether a certain
performance borders on offensive, seek ad
vice from groups like Emma Goldman and
Queer-Straight Alliance. Yes, I'm asking for
some extra work on your parts, dear readers,
but I feel you're smart, talented, and compas
sionate enough to handle it.
