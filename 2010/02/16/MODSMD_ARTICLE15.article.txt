## Remaking the Global Climate Framework 
### Teryn Norris 
Two months ago, hundreds of world
leaders and tens of thousands of ac
tivists gathered in Copenhagen to craft
a new global treaty to replace the Kyoto Pro
tocol in 2012. Green groups put on a specta
cle yes, Greenpeace even docked two of
its famous boats nearby to "help in pushing
the delegates" and some observers de
clared it a make or break event in global cli
mate history.

Today, there is strikingly little to show for
the whole affair, momentum has slowed to a
crawl and hardly anyone is discussing the af
termath. For good reason: the Copenhagen
Accord is basically a voluntary agreement
with obscure objectives, and its impact will be
negligible. Michael Cutajar, the former chair
man of the United Nations Framework Con
vention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ne
gotiation group, said that "Beyond the lack of
clarity in its drafting, its main weakness is the
lack of ambition and identifying responsibil
ities ... Who should do what, and when, in
order to limit warming to two degrees?"
What went wrong at Copenhagen? As I
recently argued on BBC World View, the out
come was primarily the result of a flawed
UNFCCC process and policy framework.
The first and most obvious problem was
imagining that 192 countries some of
which represent thousands of times more
people than others could produce a
meaningful climate mitigation treaty. The
UNFCCC process is kind of like the U.S. Sen
ate (today one of the most dysfunctional na
tional legislative bodies in the world) but at
least four times as complicated.
There is growing consensus that global cli
mate mitigation policy should be moved into
a setting like the G-20 or Major Economies
Forum on Energy & Climate (the members
of which effectively constitute a super-major
ity of the world). David Victor, a former Stan
ford professor and leading international en
ergy expert, recently put it this way: "With a
deal this complicated and difficult, the fewer
countries you need to reach an agreement,

the better the chances are."
The second overarching problem was the
policy framework. For nearly two decades,
the dominant national and global policy ap
proach to climate change mitigation has de
pended on establishing strong, "legally bind
ing" caps on carbon dioxide pollution, partic
ularly through cap and trade and other meas
ures aimed at making fossil fuels more ex
pensive.
Today, the writing is on the wall: the Kyoto
Protocol failed to achieve significant emis
sions reductions, even with a "legally-bind
ing" agreement. As President Obama himself
noted in his post-Copenhagen press confer
ence, "Kyoto was legally binding and every
body still fell short anyway." Copenhagen
failed to produce a binding treaty, even with
great pressure and expectations. If the world
moves ahead with this approach once again,
negotiations will again fail to produce a
meaningful outcome.
The time has come to remake the global
climate policy framework to focus on global
energy technology policy. Instead of debat
ing emissions targets and timetables like ac
countants, we need the largest emitters to
think like engineers and concentrate on iden
tifying specific technical hurdles and mobiliz
ing the resources to solve them. Most impor
tantly, policymakers need to focus on the
goal of "making clean energy cheap," or as
Google puts it, "renewable energy cheaper
than coal."

How much money will each major emitter
put on the table to invest in development, de

ployment and infrastructure of low-carbon
technology? What hurdles will those policies
confront, and what is each country's low-car
bon technological roadmap? How will the
policies be structured, and how can nations
productively collaborate and compete on tech
nological development? These are the kind of
critical questions that should be negotiated.

Some advocates claim that if the U.S. Sen
ate passes climate legislation similar to the
American Clean Energy & Security Act
(ACESA), the UNFCCC will achieve a
breakthrough. But little evidence suggests
that China, India and other countries will re
spond by implementing strong binding tar
gets, or that signatories will even uphold their
emissions targets. ACESA is weak technolo
gy policy at best, given that its clean energy
investments represent only a small fraction
of expert consensus, and not the kind of ex
ample we want to set for the world.
The irony is that while the U.S. and Eu
rope continue playing the accountants game
of targets and timetables, Asian governments
are the ones beginning to move forward with
serious technology policies, investing mas
sive amounts in clean-tech development and
deployment while the U.S. falls behind.
This is motivated not by climate mitigation
nor international law, of course, but econom
ic competitiveness. We should leverage these
efforts to motivate the policies we need in the
U.S. and abroad, and to develop a new global
climate framework.

Ultimately, technology policy is the single
the most important lever the world has for
overcoming this challenge. The good news is
that our civilization possesses enormous ca
pacities for invention and innovation now
we must develop a global climate policy
framework that finally puts them to good use.
