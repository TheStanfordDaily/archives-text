## WOMEN'S BASKETBALL NORTHWEST SWEEP Card defeats Huskies, Cougars on the road 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal women swept the Washington
schools over Valentine's Day weekend to go four
games ahead of second-place UCLA in the con
ference with only five contests remaining.
Stanford (23-1,13-0 Pac-10) held Washington
(9-14,4-9) to a 58-38 loss on Friday before crush
ing Washington State (6-18,1-12) 98-67 on Sun
day to bring up the chance of sealing the confer
ence this week in the final two regular season
games at Maples Pavilion.
All-American senior forward Jayne Appel
broke the hearts of two teams that have struggled
in the Pac-10, posting her best two-game stretch
of the year with an average of 21.5 points and 13.5
rebounds. She earned Pac-10 Player of the Week
honors for her efforts.
Friday's game marked a season-low offensive
output for Stanford, but more significant than its
small haul of 58 points was the fact it held the
Huskies to just 36. At half time Washington was 4-
31 from the floor, and by the final buzzer its two

leading scorers, Sami Whitcomb and Kristi King
ma, had been kept to just eight and zero points,
respectively.
Washington actually outrebounded the Car
dinal 35-33 over the whole contest, but this game
was about defense, Stanford had the upper hand
with 29 defensive rebounds compared to the
Huskies' 21, with 11 of those boards picked up by
Appel.

"She's showing everyone why she is an All-
American," said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "She's getting it done at both ends of the
floor."
Appel was not alone, as redshirt senior guard
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude had the task of marking
Kingma. The Queens, New York native kept
Kingma scoreless, allowing her to take just four
field goal attempts, all of which she missed.
"We're not like a flashy, pressing, trapping
[defense]," VanDerveer said. "We're more of a
grit, grind-it-out, position-playing defense."
That grit was apparent when Gold-Onwude
received a cut above her eye midway through the
second period for her defensive efforts, but after
a couple of minutes of treatment came back into
the thick of the action.

While the first game of the weekend was a
low-scoring affair, on Sunday the Cardinal post
ed its third highest point-total of the year against
the Cougars, with five players scoring in double

figures and Appel turning in her fourth straight
double-double, this time coming before halftime.
The game looked close halfway through the
first period with the teams separated by just three
points at 24-21, but by the end of the half the Car
dinal led 50-28. At that point, the writing seemed
to be on the wall for Washington State.
Sophomore guard Jazmine Perkins did all
she could to narrow the gap for the Cougars,
eventually scoring a game-high 26 points, but
with reigning Pac-10 Player of the Week sopho
more guard April Cook shut out by Stanford,
the game was lost.
The Cardinal dominated inside, outrebound
ing its opposition 51-29 and outscoring WSU 61-
32 in the paint. Appel and sophomore forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike posted scores of 25 and
21, respectively.
"When it comes down to it, there was just too
much Jayne," VanDerveer said. "She has a sense
of urgency and you can't underestimate the sense
of urgency."
Appel's return to form since the midway
point of Pac-10 play should be a worry to every
other contending team. She may have already
written herself into the history books of Stanford
basketball, but she knows this will be her last
chance to claim a national title.

"It's my senior year," Appel said. "I think
about that every day. I think about it every

minute I'm on the court. I have 51 days left. When
I am out there I want to make the most out of
every minute."
After an injury-stricken January, the Cardi
nal women's basketball program seems to be in
good health. Both starting seniors, Appel and
Gold-Onwude, are playing at the top of their
form, junior guard Jeanette Pohlen scored dou
ble figures in both of last weekend's games and
from the bench VanDerveer has an increasing
number of options.
Redshirt junior guard JJ Hones played over
20 minutes on Friday and freshman forward
Joslyn Tinkle notched up her first double-double
in her Cardinal career after just 17 minutes of
play on Sunday. The future looks bright, as the
team seems to be peaking just as the postseason
comes into view.

Stanford returns to campus this week for its
last conference home games, facing Oregon on
Thursday and then Oregon State on Saturday.
