# NO MAGIC AT MAPLES
## Card suffers first home conference loss 
### HALEY MURPHY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Until Saturday, there were two Pac-10 teams still hunting for
their first conference road win: Stanford and the University of
Washington. But that number dwindled to one when the Huskies
found that elusive victory on none other than the Cardinal's home
turf, beating Stanford 78-61.
Stanford (11-14,5-8 Pac-10) opened up an early lead, making it
8-2 by the 17:40 mark. Sophomore guard Jeremy Green had five of
these first eight, but both his personal and the team's success proved
fleeting: Green did not score again in the half, and the Cardinal's
lead evaporated as the Huskies (17-8, 7-6) pulled even within two
minutes.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins noted that the collapse of early
play set a trend for the rest of the game.
"We got off to an absolutely bad start," said Dawkins. "And our
free throw shooting [ll for 24] was pretty bad tonight. That stuff be
comes contagious. One guy misses, then the next guy misses a cou
ple and leads are being built while that's happening."
But Green was not the only guy missing. Senior Landry Fields
didn't have a field goal in the first 14 minutes of play, and by the half,
not a single Stanford player had reached double digits. (Despite his
cold streak, Fields still led Stanford with eight points.)
Difficulty at the line was also apparent from early on, as Stanford
missed its first six free throws and went on to shoot six-for-14 from
the stripe in the first half, as compared to U-Dub's 13 of 17. More
over, Stanford only snagged four offensive boards in the first peri
od and was subsequently outscored 11-0 on second-chance oppor
tunities.
The comedy of errors led to a 43-32 deficit at intermission, but
Dawkins' halftime speech wasn't quite enough to lift the Card.
Immediately after the break, Stanford missed eight of its first 10
scoring opportunities, including three from long range and three
layups.
"We've got to do a better job of finishing around the basket,"
Dawkins said. "We had some opportunities ... and those are things
you've got to convert. To win, you have to make plays like that."
"We gave up too many second-chance points in the first half,"
Dawkins continued. "But mainly we didn't make our free throws
and we had a couple missed finishes. That's the bottom line: I think
it would've been very close if we made those plays."
Fields and Green both finished with 17, and sophomore Jack
Trotter put up another 10, but they were outshone by the four Wash
ington players in double digits: forwards Justin Holiday (10), Matt
Bryan-Amaning (11) and Quincy Pondexter (18) went to work in
side to help the Huskies finish with 26 points in the paint and 17 sec
ond-chance points. Five-foot-eight guard Isaiah Thomas led all scor
ers with 20, and the Huskies' bench also offered another 17.
"Give Washington credit," Dawkins said. "They came in, they
played their game they were aggressive defensively, they were
attacking offensively, and that's what they do. I think it's something
that wore us down during the 40-minute game, the sheer depth that
they have."
The aggressive defense by UW kept the Card especially silent
from behind the arc, as Stanford went four-for-18 on threes, and

Green alone went one-for-nine,
"They did a good job of pushing up on him they tried to speed
him up, and he has to learn [as he develops] that you don't settle in
those situations," Dawkins said of Green. "We need his bravado, his
wanting to do things on his own out there, because that can be con
tagious for us, too."
Despite less-than-stellar numbers for the Cardinal, the Huskies,
too, were far from perfect. Washington grew quiet at the 17-minute
mark in the second half, allowing a 9-1 run from Stanford to shrink
UW's lead to two at 50-48. A dunk by Bryan-Amaning reignited
Washington's offense, but the game stayed close for the next four
minutes.
For Fields, the 17-point difference at home made the game no
more or less frustrating than the close losses on the road that have
plagued the Cardinal recently.
"Every loss is frustrating," he said. "You want to win everything."

It wasn't enough, however, as the Cardinal fell to the Huskies.
