# WOMEN'S SWIMMING
## Card exceeds expectations, crushes Cal 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After two weeks of anticipation, the Big
Meet was somewhat anticlimactic. No. 4 Stan
ford and No. 5 California were expected to
wage a close, back-and-forth battle. Instead,
the Cardinal (9-0,5-0 Pac-10) thoroughly dom
inated its Bay Area rival, winning the meet by
a final score of 167-131.

While Cal (5-2,3-2) is the defending nation
al champion, it came into Saturday's meet with
a weaker record than the Cardinal. The Gold
en Bears had also lost a meet two weeks ago
against No. 9 Southern California, a team that
Stanford later defeated by a wide margin.

At the start, the meet looked set to be a

tight affair, with Stanford holding a slim six
point lead halfway through the meet. The Car
dinal notched a big win in the 200-yard
freestyle when Stanford senior Julia Smit beat
Cal's Sara Isakovic by more than a second.
Isakovic won a silver medal in the 200-meter
free in the 2008 Olympics.
The 100-yard breaststroke was also closely
contested, with junior Liz Smith dueling Cal's
Caitlin Leverenz. The meet came down to the
final touch-out, with Leverenz beating Smith
by a .02-second margin. The Bears took the 50
free in a similarly close fashion, with Liv Jensen
beating junior Kate Dwelley by .14 seconds.
"Liv and I have been swimming against
each other for a long time and she tends to be
better at the shorter things," Dwelley said.

"With more rest, I think I'll be able to go faster
[in the postseason]."

When asked if she was worried about Cal's
early lead, head coach Lea Maurer responded,
"A little bit. I wouldn't want to change my
preparation, but I did think that we were good
but not great. I thought that we had to find a
way at the end of our races to get a few touch
outs ... the close ones weren't going our way."
After a short break, the teams returned to
the pool for the 100 free, which culminated in
another close finish. Dwelley won the race by
.03 seconds over freshman teammate Andi
Murez and by .25 seconds over Jensen. From
there, the Cardinal only lost one more event en
route to the victory.
The biggest upset of the afternoon
came in the 500 free. Two Cal stand
outs, Isakovic and Lauren Boyle,
came in as favorites and were poised
to retake the momentum from Stan
ford. But freshman Natalie Durant
swam a career-best 4:45.17 from the
second lane to win the race by nearly
a second over junior teammate Kelsey
Ditto. While Isakovic held the lead for
the first half of the race, Durant pow
ered back in the second half to draw
even with 200 yards left, and finally
grab the lead in the final 150 yards.
"It came as a surprise," Durant said.
"I wasn't even sure during the race
until the last bell whether I was winning
or not. I was just trying to beat the girl
next to me."

"I was actually a bit worried that I'd

miscounted," she continued. "I was just
trying to focus on getting to the end of
the race."

In their last meet at Stanford, Smit
and fellow senior Elaine Breeden did
not fail to impress. Smit won the 200
free, the 200-yard backstroke and the
200-yard individual medley while
Breeden took the 100- and 200-yard
butterfly.
With the win, Stanford also sealed
its second consecutive undefeated
dual-meet season and its third in four
years. In that span, Maurer's squad has
gone 46-1 in dual meets. However, the
Cardinal's primary focus remains on
the postseason tournaments. Indeed,
despite last year's undefeated record
which included a road victory over
Cal Stanford only managed to fin
ish fourth at the NCAA tournament.

"We're just trying to go in with a
great attitude with the team," Durant
said. "The team's been doing absolute
ly fantastic this season and I'm really
excited to see what we can do in the
coming meets."

Maurer said that her current plan is
to rest the team so it can be fully pre
pared for the Pac-10 tournament, set
for Feb. 24 in Long Beach, Calif

"I'm more confident about their
tenacity," she said. "You talk all the
time about digging deep and finding a
way, but it comes down to execution. I'll
lead them to the last 15 meters or to the
races and then they've got to find away
and they found away today. If they
keep doing what they did today in
terms of swimming with a lot of heart
and not over-thinking things, we'll be
dangerous."
