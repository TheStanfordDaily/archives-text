# WOMEN'S SWIMMING
## Card exceeds expectations, crushes Cal 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After two weeks of anticipation, the Big
Meet was somewhat anticlimactic. No. 4 Stan
ford and No. 5 California were expected to
wage a close, back-and-forth battle. Instead,
the Cardinal (9-0,5-0 Pac-10) thoroughly dom
inated its Bay Area rival, winning the meet by
a final score of 167-131.

While Cal (5-2,3-2) is the defending nation
al champion, it came into Saturday's meet with
a weaker record than the Cardinal. The Gold
en Bears had also lost a meet two weeks ago
against No. 9 Southern California, a team that
Stanford later defeated by a wide margin.

At the start, the meet looked set to be a

tight affair, with Stanford holding a slim six
point lead halfway through the meet. The Car
dinal notched a big win in the 200-yard
freestyle when Stanford senior Julia Smit beat
Cal's Sara Isakovic by more than a second.
Isakovic won a silver medal in the 200-meter
free in the 2008 Olympics.
The 100-yard breaststroke was also closely
contested, with junior Liz Smith dueling Cal's
Caitlin Leverenz. The meet came down to the
final touch-out, with Leverenz beating Smith
by a .02-second margin. The Bears took the 50
free in a similarly close fashion, with Liv Jensen
beating junior Kate Dwelley by .14 seconds.
"Liv and I have been swimming against
each other for a long time and she tends to be
better at the shorter things," Dwelley said.

"With more rest, I think I'll be able to go faster
[in the postseason]."

When asked if she was worried about Cal's
early lead, head coach Lea Maurer responded,
"A little bit. I wouldn't want to change my
preparation, but I did think that we were good
but not great. I thought that we had to find a
way at the end of our races to get a few touch
outs ... the close ones weren't going our way."
After a short break, the teams returned to
the pool for the 100 free, which culminated in
another close finish. Dwelley won the race by
.03 seconds over freshman teammate Andi
Murez and by .25 seconds over Jensen. From
there, the Cardinal only lost one more event en
