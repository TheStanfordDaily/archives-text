## Senate lags on minutes publication 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For students looking for minutes
from ASSU Undergraduate Senate
committee meetings, where stances
on student group funding, advocacy
issues and ASSU operations are
decided, their search may yield frus
tration.

There aren't many minutes.
In a check-in by The Daily about
the status of a quarter and a half's
worth of committee meeting min
utes, Senate leaders acknowledged
that, despite a requirement in the
ASSU Constitution that minutes be
made available electronically within
seven days of approval, the body has
failed to "do so nearly all year.
Their justification?
"No one would read the minutes,"
said Anton Zietsman 'l2, chair of the
Senate Appropriations Committee,
said in a recent interview.
"Not a chance," Varun Sivaram
'll, Senate chair, agreed.
Chairs of each of the Senate's five
committees said they have held at
least seven or eight meetings since
the beginning of their term last
spring, but only one set of minutes,
from a Jan. 26 Appropriations &
Rules meeting, appears on the com
mittees' pages of the Senate's Web
site.
"No one was aware" that posting
minutes is required by the
Constitution, Zietsman said, adding
that details of Appropriations meet
ings could be gleaned from funding
bills the committee submits each
week to the entire Senate; he said
those bills serve as an adequate
proxy for minutes.
Alex Katz 'l2, who chairs the
Administration and Rules
Committee, acknowledged that the
Senate is obligated to carry out all of
its duties.
"I think our job is to follow the
Constitution," Katz said.
