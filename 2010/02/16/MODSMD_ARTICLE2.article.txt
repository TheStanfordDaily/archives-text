## Senate lags on minutes publication 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For students looking for minutes
from ASSU Undergraduate Senate
committee meetings, where stances
on student group funding, advocacy
issues and ASSU operations are
decided, their search may yield frus
tration.

There aren't many minutes.
In a check-in by The Daily about
the status of a quarter and a half's
worth of committee meeting min
utes, Senate leaders acknowledged
that, despite a requirement in the
ASSU Constitution that minutes be
made available electronically within
seven days of approval, the body has
failed to "do so nearly all year.
Their justification?
"No one would read the minutes,"
said Anton Zietsman 'l2, chair of the
Senate Appropriations Committee,
said in a recent interview.
"Not a chance," Varun Sivaram
'll, Senate chair, agreed.
Chairs of each of the Senate's five
committees said they have held at
least seven or eight meetings since
the beginning of their term last
spring, but only one set of minutes,
from a Jan. 26 Appropriations &
Rules meeting, appears on the com
mittees' pages of the Senate's Web
site.
"No one was aware" that posting
minutes is required by the
Constitution, Zietsman said, adding
that details of Appropriations meet
ings could be gleaned from funding
bills the committee submits each
week to the entire Senate; he said
those bills serve as an adequate
proxy for minutes.
Alex Katz 'l2, who chairs the
Administration and Rules
Committee, acknowledged that the
Senate is obligated to carry out all of
its duties.
"I think our job is to follow the
Constitution," Katz said.
Minutes Taken on Ad Hoc
Basis, Senator Says

What, then, explains the missing
minutes?

"I wasn't aware, to be honest,"
said Lee Jackson 'l2, chair of the
Communications Committee.
Jackson explained that the call for
published meeting minutes in the
constitution had escaped him.
He said it appears that even basic
notes have not been taken during
some committee meetings.
"Of the five committees, I'd say
three of them take minutes," Jackson
said. "To put it bluntly, I think it's just
laziness... people tend to check out
after the first few months."
In an e-mail to The Daily, Zachary
Warma 'll, Student Life, Housing &
Education chair, said that he has held
seven committee meetings since the
start of his term last spring. The min
utes for these meetings were "spo
radic" at best, Warma said.
"For the meetings when
they've occurred there has not
been a designated secretary," Warma
said. "For a few of those I believe
there [is] documentation, but the
meetings have unfortunately been of
a more ad hoc nature than they
should have been."

Earlier this year, financial officers
of student groups questioned the
Senate regarding the absence on its

Web site of funding policies applica
ble to their groups.
Katz pointed to one set of min
utes from an A&R meeting last
month that was uploaded to the com
mittee's page. However, he said,
much of his work with the committee
has been completed on an individual
basis, without formal substantive
meetings.
"There's really not very much to
report," Katz stated.
Committee minutes aside, even
the posting of minutes from the
Senate's general meetings to its Web
site have trickled to a standstill since
Nov. 10.

Elaborating on the Web site chal
lenges that have hindered the
Senate's communication capabilities,
Jackson revealed that some parts of
the Senate's original site were
erased; that information remains
lost, he said.
Jackson added that minutes are
expected to appear on the new Web
site, which is set to debut on Mar. 1.
"The old [Web site] has kind of
been abandoned," Jackson said.

Web site Challenges Continue
to Hold Back
Communication Efforts
Some chairs have suggested that
the sparse nature of the Senate's
Web site is a reflection of Web site
construction complications fielded
by the Senate's Webmaster,
Leonard Parker 'lO, hired in
November. But others seem to
acknowledge that the problem goes

beyond a defunct Web site.
Warma said that "as a committee
chair, I was remiss in both asking my
ad-hoc note keepers to send me
along their minutes, as well as pass
ing them along to the necessary
sources to have them put online."
"I don't think you can argue that
this is some flagrant disregard," said
Brian Wanyoike 'l2, chair of the
Advocacy Committee.
Wanyoike suggested that the
body strives to adhere to its constitu
tion and that when requested by
individuals, meeting minutes "were
[made] available."
Senate members cite other efforts
this year to improve communication
and transparency, including through
the Senate's Facebook page and
weekly one-minute video sum
maries, Jackson noted.
Many chairs seem to acknowl
edge a collective responsibility to
enforce formal note-taking at each
meeting, followed by timely publica
tion on the Web site,
"The Senate has screwed up in its
Web capacity," Warma said, implying
that the body's overall vigilance
regarding the Web site's status has
been lacking thus far.
"The Senate can rightly be faulted
for the past three months of our Web
site not being up to date," Warma
said.
"We all ignorantly assumed [the
Web site] was being updated," he
added.
