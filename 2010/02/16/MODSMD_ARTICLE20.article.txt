## Card starts the season hot, but falls to Hawaii 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Softball team opened up its season
this weekend in Honolulu, Hawaii as one of four
teams competing in the Paradise Softball Classic.The
tournament saw the Cardinal take on Hawaii (3-2),
McNeese State (1-4) and Texas A&M-Corpus Christi
(2-3) in five games over three days. No. 10 Stanford
(4-1) won its first four games but lost in the tourna
ment final to Hawaii.

Stanford started
the weekend off on
a high note, taking
its first game by a
final score of 10-2 in
five innings over
Corpus Christi.
Freshman shortstop
Jenna Rich and sen
ior catcher Rosey
Neill led the Cardi
nal offense with
three hits apiece.
Rich hit the game's
only homerun.
Stanford's pitch
ing was equally im
pressive in the sea
son opener. Junior
Ashley Chinn and
freshman Teagan
Gerhart combined

to shut down Corpus Christi's offense, allowing a
total of three hits. Chinn allowed no runs in three in
nings while striking out six, while Gerhart allowed
two runs over her two innings of work in her Stanford
debut.

The next day, the Cardinal returned for two more
games against McNeese State and Flawaii. As expect
ed, Stanford rolled against the Cowgirls, winning an
other mercy-rule shortened game. The offense rapid
ly scored runs, starting with senior outfielder Alissa
Haber's leadoff home run. Sophomore outfielder
Maya Burns led all Stanford hitters with three RBIs.
In her first collegiate start, Gerhart was impres
sive in shutting down the McNeese State lineup. She
allowed only three hits and no runs and pitched the
entire game. The Cardinal took home the win with a
final score of 9-0 in five innings.

The Card's first real test of the weekend came on
Friday afternoon against Hawaii. Unlike its first two
games, the Stanford offense struggled against
Hawaii's pitching. It only managed to get six hits and
two runs (one of them unearned) off Hawaii's
Stephanie Ricketts.
However, Stanford's pitching continued to be
dominant. In her second start in as many days, Chinn
completely shut down Hawaii's hitters for the full
seven innings. She allowed only one hit and gave up
three walks while setting down 10 batters on strikes.
On the back of this performance, Stanford took its
third straight victory, 2-0, and won the first seed for
Sunday's playoff.
The Cardinal opened up Sunday's knockout
round with a decisive 5-2 victory over A&M-Corpus
Christi. Rich once again led the offense, with two
home runs in back-to-back at-bats. Neill also con
tributed with two RBIs.

On the mound, Gerhart and Chinn combined
again to shut down the Islanders' offense. Gerhart
got the start and allowed only one earned run over six
innings, striking out five batters and walking none.
While the Cardinal was expected to roll past
Hawaii to the Paradise Softball Classic champi
onship, the Rainbow Wahine refused to go down eas
ily. In a big upset, Hawaii came alive and pounded
Stanford in the final, winning the game 11-5.

While Stanford's pitching had

the duo of Chinn and Gerhart. Chinn
started the game by giving up a run in
the top of the first inning. While she
shut down Hawaii's hitters for the
next two innings, they scored runs in
the fourth, fifth and sixth innings.
Going into the seventh and final in
ning, Hawaii held a slim 6-5 lead.
In the top of the seventh, after giv
ing up another run, Chinn came out
of the game in favor of Gerhart, a
switch that proved costly for Stan
ford. Gerhart proceeded to give up
four more runs to the Rainbow
Wahine (though only one of them
was earned), allowing the hosts to
take a commanding 11-5 lead with
only half an inning remaining. Stan
ford failed to rally in the bottom of
the seventh inning, and Hawaii pre
served its six-run lead for the win.

In her second outing against the
Cardinal, Ricketts pitched a strong
game, allowing eight hits and five
runs in seven full innings. While Rick
etts' performance was not as strong as
her first game against Stanford, it was

enough to deliver victory for the
