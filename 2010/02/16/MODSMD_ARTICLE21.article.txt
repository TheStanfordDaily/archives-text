# NBC is ruining the Olympics
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
ESPN is one of my best friends.
Yes, I realize how pathetic
that may sound, but it's true. I
spend hours a day watching
ESPN and hours more
browsing ESPN.com, and I'm fine with
that. I love reading about sports and
watching sports and analyzing sports,
so ESPN is the place for me.
Unfortunately.for the past few days,
ESPN has become my enemy.
Why?
Because it's Olympics time. And
while people all over will point out that
the Winter Olympics aren't nearly as
fun as the Summer Olympics, they're
still a major event and they can still be
thrilling to watch.
Unless you already know the re
sults.

See, NBC has a monopoly on
Olympics coverage, so it chooses to
maximize its ratings by tape delaying
events so they can be shown in prime
time. This means that, even though we
West Coasters are in the same time
zone as the actual events in Vancouver,
we have to watch the events three
hours later than people on the East
Coast. Yet again, my sports life has been
ruined by East Coast bias.

What does ESPN have to do with
this? Well, ESPN gets the results when
they happen, and, being a media source
that strives to be first to a story, displays
the results immediately.This effectively
means that anyone who checks
ESPN.com or watches Sports Center or
even glances at ESPN's Bottom Line
will inevitably have the day's Olympic
results ruined before ever having a
chance to watch them happen.
In reality, this isn't ESPN's fault, and
I know it. ESPN is doing what many
media sources do, and plenty of people
are content with learning the results of
the Olympics through ESPN and not
even watching them. Even NBC's own
website announced Bode Miller's
bronze medal before NBC aired his
event.

And I suppose it's up to me to avoid
finding out what happens each day in
the Olympics before watching it. I
could just watch NBC and only NBC
for the next two weeks and none of the
results would be spoiled for me. And
that's exactly what NBC wants.
But you know what? I want to be
able to watch ESPN, or any other chan
nel for that matter. I want to be able to
flip between moguls and the NBA All-
Star Game (defense sold separately),
or to watch college basketball high
lights in between speed skating races.
And I think I have the right to do so
without seeing medal results before I
see the races.
So this all comes back to NBC. NBC
is the reason I get so many results ru
ined for me, and NBC doesn't care at
all. The network pays a huge sum of
money to be the sole broadcaster of the
Games, and it does so because of the
enormous amount of money and pres
tige it gets in return. And to maximize
this revenue, it saves the biggest events
for primetime, which means delaying
them several hours, especially for peo
ple on the West Coast.
This obviously makes sense for
NBC, because the most people watch
at primetime (hence the name) and
therefore NBC gets the most money
and publicity for the Games at that
time. NBC doesn't care if the couch po
tato has to wait longer and risk hearing
the results.

I care, though. In an age where the
majority of people have some sort of
VCR, TiVo or DVR, everyone has a
chance to watch the Olympics when
they happen, and not just at primetime.
Especially on weekends like this past
one, NBC could get tons of viewers at
noon for an event without having to
delay coverage until eight.
This is not a revolutionary concept,
either. Take ESPN's coverage of the
Australian Open. Sure, it's a smaller
event than the Olympics, but it's still a
Grand Slam. ESPN showed live cover
age AND tape delayed coverage so
that intense fans and casual fans could
watch it when they desired.
The Winter Olympics are in Van
couver, not Sydney, so live coverage
would be at 3 p.m. instead of 3 a.m. Peo
ple all over the country would love to
watch the events live, and those that
could not could either record them or
watch them in primetime on tape delay.
NBC has many networks showing
the Olympics (NBC, CNBC, MSNBC,

USA, etc.), so it's not as though it
wouldn't have enough space to show
live and tape delayed events. And
NBC would not lose any viewers or
money by showing more events live,
because viewers would still be watch
ing NBC.
So come on, NBC. Don't you want
to be my friend too?

Jacob Jaffe clearly has no real friends.
