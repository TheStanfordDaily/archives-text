# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Stanford defeats pair of SoCal rivals 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball
team took a stand this weekend and
crushed No. 3 UCLA (30-24,30-23,30-
24) and defending NCAA champion
No. 11 UC-Irvine (30-25,21-30,30-28,
30-26). The wins extend the Cardinal's
win streak at home to four games.
"Our confidence is back after losing
to Santa Barbara and Northridge, We
were so close in those two matches,"
said sophomore outsider hitter Brad
Lawson. "To come back and beat
UCLA and UC-Irvine shows that we
are getting back on track to our goal
[of] being there in the end of win
ning a national championship."
Lawson highlighted the Cardinal's
(7-3,6-3 MPSF) weekend with 37 kills,
becoming the team's new offensive
leader in the process. Senior opposite
hitter Evan Romero chipped in with 27
kills on the weekend. His classmate, set
ter Kawika Shoji, registered 96 assists,
with a stellar 58 against UC-Irvine.
The Card's Friday night sweep
showcased its ability to stay ahead of
the competition and truly finish. The
first set of the night started off slow for
Stanford as it fell behind early to the
Bruins (7-6,6-4) by a score of 6-4. But
kills from Lawson and Romero, fol
lowed by UCLA hitting errors, gave
Stanford an edge. While the set contin
ued to be a back and forth battle, Stan
ford's sophomore libero Erik Shoji was
able to hold down the defense against
Bruin powerhouse Jack Polales. At 16-
16, the Card was cutting it close, but an
Ellis block put Stanford up again. After
a combination of service errors and hit
ting errors, the Bruins approached de
feat. A Nick Vogel service error con
cluded the set at 30-24 and gave Stan
ford the 1-0 advantage.
The Card came out swinging in the sec
ond set. Back from injury, junior out
side hitter Spencer McLachlin fired a
kill from Ellis. After two UCLA kills,
Stanford took time to regain focus and
slow the Bruins down. It was effective,
as UCLA came out making errors,
forcing a Bruin timeout at 20-14. Law
son and Werner held the lead and
Romero finished it off at 30-23.

"It was important getting Spencer
[McLachlin] back. He's a great player
a steady passer and a great hitter,"
Lawson said.

Looking for a comeback, UCLA
kicked off the set on the attack and held
the lead until McLachlin tied it up 11-
11. While the Bruins offense stay close
with a few crucial kills, Lawson ended
the set at 30-24 for the match victory.
After a 3-0 sweep, the Card moved
on to the defending champions on Sat
urday for a clutch win.
In a strong start to set one, a four
point run and kills from Werner,
McLachlin, Lawson and Shoji posi
tioned Stanford with a 13-7 lead. Un
able to gain the lead, the Anteaters (7-
8, 3-7) failed to respond to Stanford's
offense. With strong hitters on all sides,
the Anteaters yielded to Ellis as he
closed the set at 30-25 for the Card.

The second set displayed a changed
Stanford team one that was incon
sistent, but still able to battle it out. Ellis
and Lawson were able to connect with
the ball and deliver big kills to keep
them in the game. But a slight lack of
focus on the Card's part benefited the
Anteaters as an Austin D'Amore kill
finished it off at 30-21 for UCI.

The Cardinal regrouped after its
first lost set of the weekend and came
out reenergized. Despite falling behind
early, Stanford tied the match 14 times
before finally taking the lead after 22-
22. McLachlin and Romero helped get
the Card to 26-24 before Lawson
ended the third set, 30-28.
Romero targeted the Anteaters in
the fourth with powerful serves for four
straight aces . The Card capitalized on
the momentum and jumped to a 10-5
lead when Lawson knocked in another
kill. Irvine hung tough, but Romero
finished the set strong with three kills in
the 30-26 victory.
With the two wins, Stanford moved
up in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration, ranking second below North
ridge. This upcoming weekend the Car
dinal travels to southern California to
play Pepperdine in Malibu and USC in
Los Angeles.
