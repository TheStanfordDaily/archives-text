# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Card tops Sonoma State 
### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a smashing performance this
weekend as the No. 1 Stanford women's
water polo team crushed Sonoma State
(1-8) by a score of 17-6 on Saturday.
Last weekend, the Cardinal (8-0) de
feated Michigan, USC, San Jose State
and UC-Berkeley. Momentum from
winning the Stanford Invitational
seemed to make the Cardinal win this
weekend even more glorious. The first
quarter was not the best of the entire
game, as the score was tied 4-4 by the
end of the period.
"I think it was execution," said fresh
man two-meter Annika Dries. "We
took a lot of shots early on that just did
n't convert. We knew we needed to step
it up."
And the Cardinal did just that dur
ing the second period, outscoring Sono
ma State 3-1 to give Stanford a 7-5 ad
vantage by halftime.
During the third period, the Cardi
nal dominated Sonoma State. Not a sin
gle shot made it into the Stanford net;
however, unlike Sonoma State, the Car
dinal was able to skip six shots into the
Sonoma goal. Now with a huge advan
tage, Stanford was set for a win.
"We came out fast and determined

to put goals in the cage," Dries said re
garding the explosion during the third
period. "We knew we were better than
how we started the game."
During the fourth period, Stanford
was still riding on the momentum from
third period and scored goals, outnum
bering Sonoma's single goal.
The Cardinal victory was made pos
sible by a variety of players, demonstrat
ing the wide array of talent on this top
ranked team. Sophomore driver Pallavi
Menon scored the most goals during
the game with a total of four. Freshman
driver Victoria Kennedy also con
tributed to the overwhelming Cardinal
victory by skipping in three shots of her
own.
Freshman driver Vee Dunlevie,
freshman driver Jillian Garton and
sophomore two-meter Melissa Seide
mann each scored two goals while soph
omore driver Mimi Bury, senior two
meter Alex Koran, freshman driver
Alexis Lee and sophomore driver
Alyssa Lo each skipped in a single goal.
Also, during the first period and
fourth period, junior goalkeeper Kim
Flail saved a total of three shots. During
the second and third period, freshman
goalkeeper Kate Baldoni had a whop
ping five saves.
"I think this game showed the depth

of our team as we had so many different
people scoring throughout the game,"
Dries said.
With six freshman, six sophomores,
three juniors and four seniors, the team
has a wide variety of players with differ
ent levels of experience; yet by the end
of the game each player seems to con
tribute to continuing the team's flawless
record.
The collaborative team effort
helped the Cardinal earn its eighth con
secutive win as it works toward the Na
tional Collegiate Championship and
MPSF Championship.
"Every game is important to us de
veloping as a team and getting to know
how we will perform in key situations,"
Dries said.
The last time Stanford women's
water polo team had a win this big was
on Jan. 31 at the NorCal Invitational,
when it beat Cal State Monterey 16-2
and Pacific 19-8. However, most of the
Cardinal's recent games have been won
by at least three points.
With high hopes for the rest of the
season, the team will be having its next
match against San Jose State at the San
Jose Aquatic Center Saturday at noon.
