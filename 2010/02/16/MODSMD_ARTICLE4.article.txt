## Pre-meds attend SUMMA 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford University Mini
Medical Alliance (SUMMA) welcomi
some 460 students to its annual pre
medical conference this Saturday.
Recognizing the growing health
care needs of the country's minority i
populations, the conference aimed to '
attract and provide support for med
ical professionals who can meet these
needs.

"Our goal is to encourage minor
students or students from underserved
grounds to apply to medical school or to
any kind of health-related field," said
SUMMA Conference coordinator Luis
Gutierrez.

A third-year M.D. candidate, Gutierrez said that
the conference serves as a venue where minority pre
med students can network with each other and with

medical school recruiters.
This year's event opened with a welcome address
from Medical School Dean Philip Pizzo and
itrics Prof. Fernando Mendoza, who
10 serves as the associate dean of
Minority Affairs and Programs.
The conference featured a number
of keynote faculty speakers from the
School of Medicine, as well as a series
of workshops ranging from MCAT
preparation and the medical school
application process to successful grant
vriting and civic activism.
According to Gutierrez, one of the
memorable segments of the conference
was Faces of the Community, a student
speaker series that offered a personal look
at the challenging path to a medical career.
"We have three Stanford medical students who tell
very personal stories about their roads towards medi-

/The Stanford Daily
cine ... That's always one of the
things that the students who attend
the conference remember the most
because these are stories that could
be very similar to their own,"
Gutierrez said.

Human biology major Ulysses
Rosas 'lO agreed that Faces of the
Community offers a unique perspec
tive on the medical school experience,
saying that it reminded him of a simi
lar program during New Student
Orientation.
Rosas further noted that the event
left attendees with "the sense that
medical students come from all back
grounds— that there's no specific
profile."

On a more pragmatic level, the
conference grants attendees the
opportunity to mix and mingle with
representatives from different med
ical schools.

"Getting to talk to recruiters from
different schools, I think, is another
huge highlight," Gutierrez said. "It's
just a huge networking process."
Rosas, who plans to apply to med
ical school this coming cycle, quickly
added that the chance to talk to
recruiters was another major motiva
tion for his participation in
SUMMA. He stated that the net
working aspect of the conference
allows attendees to learn about what
a particular institution offers and
how well it meets the needs of its stu
dents.

"I would say a good 25 percent of
the recruiters I talked to were friends
who went on to med school and came
back to be reps for this conference,"
Rosas said.

Though Rosas attributes this
reunion to mere coincidence, it may
signal a surge in success for the con
ference. When SUMMA began 19
years ago, it was a completely student
run program. The alliance has since
evolved into a collaboration between
various entities in the School of
Medicine.
"Over the years, it's actually
become a giant effort between the
medical students and the faculty and
staff at the Center of Excellence in
Diversity," Gutierrez said.
Pre-med students from both
Stanford and other California col
leges attended.
