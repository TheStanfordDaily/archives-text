# WASTE NOT, WANT NOT
## Campus eliminates trash sustainably 
### ANN TYLER MOSES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The recent installation of compost
bins at some campus eateries and lessons
in a new civil and environmental engi
neering class may signal a change in the
way Stanford manages waste.
Union Square, The Axe & Palm and
Russo Cafe became billed as "waste
free" last week; through the combined
efforts of Students for a Sustainable
Stanford (SSS) and Stanford Hospitality
and Auxiliaries, the eateries agreed to
use only compostable or recyclable
materials and were equipped with bins to
dispose of these items.
Meanwhile, a new course on campus
sustainability has students analyzing the
impact of waste at places like Tresidder's
Union Square, where hundreds of stu
dents eat daily.
This concerted effort raises questions
about how the University as a whole as
has fared in matters of waste disposal.
Julie Muir, director of Stanford's
Recycling Program, has sifted through
the University's rubbish for 16 years to
better understand its waste patterns.
"I do not really need to sort trash
myself [at this point]," she said.
But Muir headed to the bins once
again this quarter while working with
students in "Creating a Green Student
Workforce to Help Implement
Stanford's Sustainability Vision," a new
class that teaches students about campus
sustainability.
The class focuses on facets of sustain
ability like waste management, green
buildings and water and energy conser
vation that are integral to reducing waste
at Stanford.

"I think people's minds are opened
when they see what we're throwing
away," Muir said. "You don't think about
it once it goes in the trash can, but this
brings it right back up to you."
Muir oversees a recycling program
that uses more than 4,000 bins on campus
to divert 65 percent of waste away from
the landfill, but she said this system
depends entirely on the cooperation of

its users.

"Twenty percent of what we send to
the landfill is bottles and cans and
paper," Muir said. "That could be han
dled today, with no new programs and no
extra dollars just Joe Citizen and Julie
Citizen putting the right thing in the right
bin."

The same problem occurred when
another set of compost bins were
installed in Tresidder several years ago.
The receptacles were regularly contami
nated with non-compostable material,
forcing the University to pay a fine. The
bins were eventually removed.
Leah Kuritzky 'lO, a SSS outreach
coordinator who spearheaded the latest
installation, believes that the outcome
will be different this time. Students have
adorned the bins with signs and members
of SSS plan to help customers sort their
refuse during the program's fledgling
weeks.
"I think going toward zero waste in
the unions is going to be successful,"
Kuritzky said. "It's just a matter of get
ting over the first hump and letting peo
ple know that the alternatives are there."
"We can literally recycle materials
into new products, and that diverts the
need to find new natural resources,"
added Noel Crisostomo 'lO, an SSS out
reach coordinator and teaching assistant
for the course. "Educating others about
those little-known benefits of waste
diversion is empowering."
Jeff Koseff, a civil and environmental
engineering professor who oversees the
class, agrees.
"To me, it's a great way to bridge the
academic and operational divide and
bring the passion and the interest of the
students to play in a very productive
way," Koseff said.
Despite these developments, Stanford
has a long way to go in order to eliminate
waste entirely. Instructor Fahmida
Ahmed recognizes that scaling these pro
grams to the University level quickly will
be a challenge. Ahmed co-teaches the
course and is the associate director of
sustainability and energy management
within the Office of Sustainability.
"How do we —lO people, 15
people or even 90 people serve a
campus of 35,000 and change their
behavior in a reasonably short peri
od of time?" Ahmed said. "I'm very
cautiously optimistic."
