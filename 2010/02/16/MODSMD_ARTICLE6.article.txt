# A 						SURFER'S PARADISE
## Half Moon Bay hosts big-wave surf contest 
### BRENDAN WEINSTEIN 
Last Saturday the 24 best surfers in the
world braved cold waters, the looming threat
of sharks, jagged rocks and powerful currents
at the Mavericks surf competition, the biggest
paddle-in big wave surf competition in the
world. The competition boasts the largest cash
prize total of any surfing competition in the
world at $150,000 dollars. This year's contest
champion, Chris Bertish of South Africa,
walked away with $50,000 dollars in prize
money after beating out fellow finalists Shane
Desmond, Anthony Tashnick, Dave Wassel,
Carlos Burle and Kenny Collins.
Seasoned surfers and judges alike pro
claimed that paddle-in history was made on
Saturday, with waves reaching heights of 40-45
feet on the face.

"The entire book of big wave surfing was
rewritten today," said 2008 Mavericks champi
on Greg Long. Finalist David Wassel, recipient
of the Jay Moriarity Award, said, "It was
undoubtedly the largest surf any paddle-in
contest has ever seen."

Mark Sponsler, founder of stormsurf.com
and the official forecaster of the event, spoke
with The Daily to explain what makes the
waves at Mavericks so massive.

"[Mavericks is] exposed to all the energy

from storms coming from Japan," Sponsler
said. "There is a shallow reef off the ocean and
the waves hit this shallow reef and double in
size. The water is 20 feet deep where the waves
are and can be 60 feet deep off the peak."
Sponsler forecasted correctly that the
waves would be a "solid 20 to 25 feet; 40-45
feet on the face."

Although there were worries about south
ward winds creating a rougher wave to ride,

the winds died off overnight and northeast
ward winds of two knots created what
Sponsler described as "perfect surfing condi
tions for Mavericks."

One of two local pro surfers to make the
lineup for Mavericks, Tim West, spoke with
The Daily the day before the contest about his
preparations.

Spectators came out in droves to take in the massive waves and talented surfers last Saturday.
Eventually, they saw South African contestant Chris Bertish earn first place and $50,000.
"I am basically around like a
chicken with its head cut off: watch
ing the ocean all day and keeping an
eye on the winds," West said. "Eating
healthy is really important. I've been
really focusing on that."
West reported that recently he's
managed to get in "a lot of big wave
sessions, about 15." According to
West, "Mavericks easily has the
biggest, heaviest paddle waves in the
world. It's really hard to paddle in on
heavier waves. It's not going to be 70
feet, but there should be some good
40 feet waves. When it comes down
to it, tomorrow's just about a passion
for surfing."
West and fellow pro-surfers were
not the only ones to experience the
power of waves 40 to 45 feet on the
face, as a rogue wave early in the day
knocked out a stand set up for spec
tators which led to the closing of the
main beach for spectators. Police
officers and medics at the beach
reported that several people suf
fered broken bones from the inci
dent.
