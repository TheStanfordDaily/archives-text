## SIXTH MAN OFF THE BENCH 
### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
w ust two minutes into Thursday's
I men's basketball game against
Washington State, a WSU player
I falls off the basketball court and
u into the crowd, forcing a couple of
cameramen, Dollies and unsuspecting
fans to all frantically scramble out of the
way.
To members of Sixth Man, the student
cheering section, the opponent's fall is no
positive sign for the Stanford Cardinal.
"C'mon, your parents are watching!
Pick it up!" yells a fan in a rather weak
attempt at motivating his team.
Pointing to a Stanford player on the
court, one athletic-looking but rather
brash student asks, "Am I better than
him, by the looks of it?"
"Yeah, dude, I think so," responds his
friend.
The insults directed at the opponents
are no less biting.
"Look at the Washington State coach
ing staff. They look like such a ragtag
group," mocks one home team supporter.
"Is that one wearing a blazer with a v
neck?"
After one of Stanford's players pulls
off a Jordan-esque slam dunk, the decibel
level in Maples Pavilion rapidly intensi
fies. Students begin chanting, "Here we
go, Stanford, here we go!" and alumni
and non-students follow suit. It doesn't
hurt that the band never fails to fill every
moment with music, drumming and
expert heckling.
The noise level peaks when the over

head screen zooms in on Sixth Man's
most prominent member Robin
Lopez, a Stanford alum and profession
al basketball player for the Phoenix
Suns.
By the end of the first half, Stanford is
down 18-33, but that doesn't stop fans
from cheering on the Stanford Soul Line
dancers, first up for the halftime show.
Even as some students wonder, "Who
are these people?" some are less particu
lar about their choice of entertainment.
One enthusiast screams, "I see you!" as
Soul Line's middle and old-aged dancers
bust out moves from dances like the elec
tric slide and the "Stanford bounce."
"Next up is Sixth Man Marco Polo!"
booms the announcer. A blindfolded stu
dent, proudly sporting his black Sixth
Man shirt, steps onto the court. Assisted
by the cheers of the crowd, he wanders
over to the Tree, who embraces the victo
rious seeker with a giant tree not bear
hug.
At the start of the second half, a few
pessimists take the chance to express
their views of the game.
"I want to sit down," complains a stu
dent, as he returns from the concession
stand with a loaded hotdog and a 24-
ounce lemonade. "I wish we had seats."
The rest of Maples Pavilion, however,
is just beginning to get into the game.
Sixth Man members take the lead with
enthusiastic "Nays!" whenever WSU
