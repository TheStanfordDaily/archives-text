Sankofa: A Ghanaian word meaning to
go forward while facing backward,
learning from the lessons of the past.
Talisman's 20th reunion concert

pella group finding a perfect harmony of old
and new.
Current members joined more than 100
Talisman alumni who flooded back onto cam

pus for the concert. Talisman brought their
history to life in word and song, encouraging
the audience to grapple with questions of
identity and purpose as they move into the
future.
"Is it OK that we sing stories that may not
directly be our own?" director Scott Frank 'lO
asked the audience. "Is it OK that we sing of
struggle in one of the most affluent regions of
the world? We can no longer pass this conver
sation onto the next year, this is not sustain
able."
With these questions, Frank explored

Talisman's history, defined by some of the con
flicts that arise in singing songs from other cul
tures and finding passion in others' words. By
sharing stories of struggle in a respectful way
and blending specifics with universalities,
Talisman hopes to let the voices of the past
ring into the future. Sankofa, indeed.
Joseph Pigato '92 founded Talisman in 1990
as an alternative to what he saw as the rela
tively homogenous a cappella scene at
Stanford at the time. After he spent months
