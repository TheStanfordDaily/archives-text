# 20 YEARS OF TALISMAN

Sankofa: A Ghanaian word meaning to
go forward while facing backward,
learning from the lessons of the past.
Talisman's 20th reunion concert
struck that chord last night in a nearly
packed Memorial Auditorium, with the a cap
pella group finding a perfect harmony of old
and new.
Current members joined more than 100
Talisman alumni who flooded back onto cam

pus for the concert. Talisman brought their
history to life in word and song, encouraging
the audience to grapple with questions of
identity and purpose as they move into the
future.
"Is it OK that we sing stories that may not
directly be our own?" director Scott Frank 'lO
asked the audience. "Is it OK that we sing of
struggle in one of the most affluent regions of
the world? We can no longer pass this conver
sation onto the next year, this is not sustain
able."
With these questions, Frank explored

Talisman's history, defined by some of the con
flicts that arise in singing songs from other cul
tures and finding passion in others' words. By
sharing stories of struggle in a respectful way
and blending specifics with universalities,
Talisman hopes to let the voices of the past
ring into the future. Sankofa, indeed.
Joseph Pigato '92 founded Talisman in 1990
as an alternative to what he saw as the rela
tively homogenous a cappella scene at
Stanford at the time. After he spent months

mapping out small steps in his head,
a friend finally pushed him to take
the plunge and start his own group.
At the ASSU student group registry,
a fortuitous naming mistake defined
the group's identity as now know it.
"They asked me for a name, and
Talisman came to mind," Pigato
recalled. "I thought I'm not sure
why that it meant an African sto
ryteller. Then I found out it didn't
mean that at all."

"It was the right name for the
wrong reason," he added. "I don't
think it's a complete coincidence
that the meaning still fits for our
group."
For Alicia Easley '92, one of
Talisman's first members, the lure of
a meaningful musical experience
made Talisman a perfect fit for her.
"I didn't go back for the callbacks
[of the other a cappella groups]," she
said. "I didn't feel like they were
right for me. Talisman was just dif
ferent from all the other groups try
ing to compete against each other
with the same songs."
Talisman's repertoire combines
African folk songs, African-
American spirituals and music of
indigenous peoples from all over the
world. The singers hope the music
will speak to others' emotions and
stir up the strong reactions they
believe music should inspire.
"We're singing music that was
meant to be sung," Pigato said.
"College a cappella is just peppy and
pippy and fun, which is great when

you just want an upbeat show, [but]
Stanford has a very diverse student
body, very cerebral, so it's a credit to
the student body that they gave
world music a chance."
From its first concert at Chi Theta
Chi, in which the group had to
decline requests for an encore
because they had already sung every
song they knew, Talisman's reach has
spread beyond campus, stretching
across the world. After the group
almost disintegrated in 1993 under
the pressures of recruiting singers
and publicizing the emerging group,
Talisman now has an entrenched
presence. Within two years
between 1996 and 1997 Talisman
performed at the Olympics, sang for
Bill Clinton in the White House on a
personal invitation, and became the
1997 National a cappella champions.
Despite their impressive vocal
achievements, members of Talisman
have always felt a deep connection
to the group that extends beyond the
music. In addition to music, Talisman
also puts an emphasis on community
service. Talisman's service aspect
began soon after its inception, with
visits to East Palo Alto and local
nursing homes. In 1993, Talisman
became connected with the Amy
Biehl Foundation an organization
started by the parents of Amy Biehl
'B9, a Stanford graduate who was
murdered in a township outside
South Africa.

Supported by the Amy Biehl
Foundation, Talisman traveled to
South Africa for the first time in
2000 and has made the trip several
times since. The group helps pro
grams supporting school children
through music and has sung at
churches, schools, restaurants and a

textile factory. While at first
Talisman was nervous about per
forming to different cultural groups
in their own local dialect, the reac
tions of the South Africans more
than reassured them.
"South Africa was absolutely the
most ridiculous highlight â€”it was
life-changing," said Grace Chen 'O4.
"We saw a different Africa than a lot
of tourists see. I don't know how
many times I cried seeing [the ele
mentary school children's] reactions
to us singing their language, showing
that we respect their music."
In their future concerts, Talisman
hopes to bring back the African cul
tural response to music.
"Music is so engrained in the cul
ture [in Africa] so if they know a
song, they won't just nudge each
other, they'll join right in," Pigato
said. "Usually the audience gets
involved real fast."
Sankofa's finale yesterday, which
brought together all 100 singers for
the final four songs, certainly stirred
up the audience. The strong bonds
evident between the singers of all
ages also added meaning to the
music.
"It's like coming back with your
family," said Ron Ragin 'O5 of
reuniting with the group.
As Talisman prepares for another
trip to South Africa this spring, they
plan to build off of the inspiration of
past voices and surpass Pigato's 20-
year-old-dream.
"[Talisman] has really become
what we always thought it would be,
what we always wanted it to be,"
Easley said.
