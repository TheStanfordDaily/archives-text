## EDITORIAL As costs rise, student groups must tighten their belts 
### 
With a 3.5 percent increase approved
by University trustees last week,
the cost of attending Stanford for
the 2010-2011 school year will, for the first
time, exceed $50,000. Such increases are, of
course, periodically necessary and can cer
tainly be expected in a time of budget cuts
and widespread economic downturn. But
these expectations do not change the added
pressure and worry associated with the extra
bills. After all, a 3.5 percent increase
amounts to more than $1,500 extra each
year, which is by no means an insignificant
amount to most families.
Given these stakes, the Editorial Board
would like to remind students to take seri
ously their own role in fiscal responsibility
management of student group budgets.
We feel that the overwhelming tendency
is for student groups to increase their budg
ets by trying to approve as much spending as
possible. And as many of us who have
worked with student groups know, more
spending can usually be justified than is ac
tually needed.
The passion that goes into planning all
the uses for that money should not be at
tacked we think it necessary that each
student group should view their own pur
pose as worthwhile. We also think, however,
that a lot of the success of student groups
hinges less on the extra funds at the margins
than some might realize.
Examples of spending the Editorial

Board envisions student groups cutting back
on include “social” budgets that too often re
sult in meals at expensive restaurants, par
ties and special events that seem to serve no
real purpose besides affording some stu
dents unnecessary luxury at the expense of
the University. The Editorial Board fails to
see the purpose of expenditures that do not
contribute directly to a group’s purpose, and
hopes that they will be rooted out.
Rather than taking issue with any partic
ular group, or venting our personal anec
dotes about “wasteful” spending, we would
instead like to offer a courteous reminder to
student groups that the funds at your dispos
al represent a cost to all those attending this
University. The bureaucratic infrastructure
to check spending simply does not have the
power to consider the value of each dollar
spent. That is a responsibility unique to stu
dent groups themselves, and one we hope
that they begin to take more seriously in the
current climate.
Thus, we hope groups continue to judi
ciously budget when planning events and
projects. When deciding on an expenditure,
ask yourself what it contributes to your
selves, to Stanford and to the audience your
group aims to affect. We ask for this caution
because we understand the reality that stu
dent groups do not pay for the frivolity of
dollars spent in waste. Instead, when costs of
attendance rise, we all are forced to pay the
bill.
