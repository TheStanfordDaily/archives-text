# GET IT RIGHT
## A 						Cold Dose of Reality, Courtesy of Professor Phil Jones 
### Erica Morgan 
Jumping on the climate change bandwag
on would be a convenient course to take.
The temptation is sometimes over
whelming. After all, scientists have reached a
“consensus,” Stanford professors speak with
one mind and Stanford students are down
right evangelical when it comes to the global
warming gospel. I could join the sustainabili
ty community (hooray solidarity), receive re
search funding from the federal government
(assuming my results supports the political
platforms of the powers that be) and drive a
Prius (the name is so similar to “pious”). I
could nod knowingly as all weather phenom
ena are attributed to human evils and shake
my head sadly at the ignorance of cynics. Cli
mate change skeptics are an ostracized lot at
the moment: they stand in the way of the
greater good, naively question accepted par
adigms and, more generally, hate the planet. I
could distance myself from this motley crew
and experience the self-righteous glory of the
earnest makeshift climatologist out to make
her mark in this troubled world.
Why then, do I not pursue the prescribed
path? Because I am simply not convinced. I
do not blindly deny the possibility of man
made climate change nor presume to claim
expertise in climatology. I maintain a healthy
dose of skepticism that seems prudent in
light of the unprecedented changes being
suggested and implemented in our lives. The
“better safe than sorry” argument is a fa
vorite of the uninformed climate change lem
ming, but it holds no water. How can educat
ed, intelligent individuals possibly accept
that line of reasoning? When our futures are
to be impacted by potential legislation we
should demand accuracy and honesty from
scientists, politicians and the media. Not fifty
years ago, dire warnings of global cooling
filled the papers. More recently, proclama
tions that ethanol would save us all from for
eign oil dependency ran rampant. Is it so im
possible that the scientific “certainties” of
today may undergo radical changes fifty
years from now?
Maybe we should ask Professor Phil
Jones, former Director of the Climate Re
search Unit at the University of East Anglia.
In November, Phil Jones became the focal
point of the so-called “Climategate” scandal
when e-mails surfaced suggesting the modifi
cation of climate data, the withholding of in
formation and the inaccuracy of testing
equipment. At the time, Jones desperately at
tempted to rationalize the e-mails, which
mention “tricks” to “hide the decline,” be
moan the “travesty” that “we can’t account
for the lack of warming at the moment” and
advise to “delete as appropriate.” Phil stood
by the IPCC and his data and boldly de
clared; “the facts speak for themselves.”
However, it seems that the facts may not
get a chance to voice their opinions. Jones re-

fused Freedom of Information requests for
crucial data behind the theory of man-made
climate change. Colleagues speculate that
Jones misplaced the data. The aforemen
tioned e-mails indicate that it may have been
intentionally eliminated. In any case, Jones
conceded to BBC News on February 13 that
“there is some truth” to the suggestion by his
colleagues that he has not kept an accurate
paper trail of the data behind the infamous
hockey stick graph. He has also confirmed
that there has been no statistically significant
warming in the past 15 years, and that tem
peratures may well have been warmer in the
medieval warming period than they are
today.
BBC Interview:
Q; “Do you agree that from 1995 to the
present there has been no statistical
ly significant global warming?”
Jones; “Yes, but only just.”
Q: “Do you agree that natural influ
ences could have contributed signifi
cantly to the global warming ob
served from 1975-1998?”
Jones: “This area is slightly outside my area
of expertise.”
Q: “How confident are you that warm
ing has taken place and that humans
are mainly responsible?”
Jones; “I'm 100 percent confident that the
climate has warmed ... there’s evi
dence that most of the warming since
the 1950s is due to human activity.”
So ... there is no statistically significant
evidence that the climate has warmed in the
past 15 years, Jones has admitted that he is no
expert in natural sources of climate change
and yet he claims with 100 percent conviction
that man-made warming is scientifically de
fensible. I find this highly suspect.
Perhaps there is warming. Perhaps it is
manmade. But when one of the figureheads
of the movement is forced to eat his words
and admit faulty record-keeping and re
search practices, I think the issue bears fur
ther scrutiny. Stifling the productive capacity
of our nation with carbon caps and pouring
federal money into clean energy research
may not be the best policy in the current eco
nomic crisis. Food for thought.
