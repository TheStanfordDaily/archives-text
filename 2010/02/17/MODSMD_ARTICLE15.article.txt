# STRANGELY CHARMING
## Treemendous Scientists 
### Jack Cackler 
While here at Stanford scientists
clearly stride at the top of the social
strata, the public face of modern sci
ence is often painted as dry and repetitive,
and conducted by nebbish, bespectacled men
and women in windowless labs. This is a
tragedy, as it conceals how truly exciting and
wonderful the world of modern science can
be. While it is easy to get lost in a world rac
ing for grant funding, IRB approvals and re
peat trials, the simple fact is that science has
landed people on the moon, enabled instant
communication around the globe and cured
countless diseases, all of which would have
seemed absurd a hundred years ago. Every
so often, there comes along a scientist who
throws caution to the winds and discovers
something really cool not just through clever
reasoning, but also through sheer brazen au
dacity. Today I would like to take a step back
to celebrate some of the true badasses in sci
ence history.
Edward Jenner was a surgeon from
Berkeley, England (don’t worry, not that
Berkeley), who developed the concept of
vaccination. Jenner theorized that cow pox
(a non-lethal relative of small pox) exposure
helped generate immunity to small pox after
noticing with local farmers that milkmaids
tended not to get small pox. Incidentally, the
term vaccine is derived from the latin word
vacca for cow, bearing homage to Jenner’s in
genuity. The real hero of the story, however,
is an eight-year-old boy named James
Phipps, who Jenner tested his theory on in
1796. Somehow, vaccination being an undis
covered and certainly not well understood
concept, Jenner convinced both the boy and
his mother that it was a good idea to a) infect
him intentionally with cow pox b) expose
him to attenuated small pox and c) hope for
the best. Having given more than a couple
tours to Stanford parents, I am not sure how
many of you reading this would have been al
lowed to volunteer for this experiment at age
eight. Nevertheless, the test was a success,
and vaccination spread rapidly throughout
the world. It is arguable that because a young
James Phipps volunteered his life to science
on little more than a hunch, more lives have
been saved than have been saved by any
other single action in history.

No matter what you
are passionate
about, never be
afraid to be bold.
Sometimes it is the
craziest ideas we
learn from the
most.

Werner Forssmann was a German sur
geon who was looking for a method to access
the heart to deliver drugs locally, rather than
throughout the body. He had worked in urol
ogy and had the bright idea that a urinary
catheter could be modified to be threaded to
the bloodstream eventually reaching the
heart, a process now known as cardiac
catheterization. After being told it was in
credibly dangerous, he decided the only per
son he could ethically test out the procedure
on was himself. Read the next sentence care
fully. After his assistant tried to stop him, he
tied her to a table, anesthetized his arm, cut
open, and threaded a catheter through his
veins into his heart. He proceeded to walk

down the hall to the X-Ray room, and asked
for a picture of his handiwork, to confirm
that the catheter had indeed gone into his
heart. While the stunt cost him his job, he
eventually won the 1956 Nobel Prize in Med
icine and has since saved countless lives.
Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were
doctors in Australia who were studying gas
tric ulcers. As the stomach is filled with hy
drochloric acid, it was long thought to be
much too harsh an environment for any bac
teria to survive. Despite substantial evidence
that bacteria, particularly Helicobacter py
lori, were indeed the cause of ulcers, the sci
entific community was reticent to modify
their accepted principle that nothing could
survive in HCI. Growing frustrated, Marshall
decided to prove them wrong the easiest way
he knew, by chugging a beaker of H. pylori
Unlike Phipps or Forssman, who were hop
ing their daring adventures would surprising
ly end safely, Marshall’s goal from the outset
was to get sick in order to prove that bacteria
were the source of the ulcers. Dangerous?
Yes. Outrageous? Certainly. But effective?
Absolutely. His work revolutionized the sci
entific community’s understanding of bacte
ria and aided countless people who have now
used antibiotics to cure stomach ulcers. For
their work, Marshall and Warren received
the 2005 Nobel Prize in Medicine.
I have two real points here.The first is that
science is very exciting. While the pursuit of
enlightenment is enough to fascinate me, it is
good to know that there is science out there
every bit as riveting as the latest Hollywood
blockbuster. The larger point is that while
“conventional” science is usually a great
method toward lighting the lamp of knowl
edge, sometimes bold determination, backed
by carefully reasoned scientific insight, can
be tremendously effective. I am not advocat
ing that each of you run down to Herrin to
pound a flask of your favorite bacteria, but I
do have one request. No matter what you are
passionate about, never be afraid to be bold-
Sometimes it is the craziest ideas we learn
the most from.
