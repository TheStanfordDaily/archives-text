### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men’s and women’s track and
field team had a spectacular weekend in Seat
tle, Wash, at the Husky Classic, posting multi
ple provisional and automatic standards. As
the NCAA National Championship draws
closer and closer, the pressure is on for these
times, especially the automatic marks, as they
guarantee the athlete a spot at nationals.
Leading the way for the Cardinal was an in
credible performance by the distance running
duo of senior Justin Marpole-Bird and sopho
more Dylan Ferris. Marpole-Bird and Ferris
both achieved the remarkable feat of running
the mile under four minutes for the first time,
posting times of 3:58.76 and 3:58.90, respec
tively. These times moved the pair into fifth
and sixth on the all-time Stanford list. Both of
these blazing times were NCAA automatic
qualifying times for the two Stanford men, giv
ing them a chance to compete at nationals for
the first time.
“It was great to come off of a slight injury
that had hampered some training and still
break four minutes for the mile,” Marpole-
Bird said.
“This weekend was really big for a lot of us
on the team,” Ferris added. “With two auto
matics and two provisionals, the mile was a
great race.”
Also faring well in the mile was junior JT
Sullivan, who barely missed breaking the four
minute mark, finishing with a time of 4:00.02, a
provisional standard. Sophomore Miles Un
terreiner also achieved a provisional time in
the mile, finishing with a time of 4:03.21.
Also earning provisional standards for the

men were juniors Elliott Heath and Jake Riley
in the 3,000 meters, and sophomore Geoffrey
Tabor in the shot put. Heath and Riley finished
with times of 8:01.74 and 8:02.73 respectively,
while Tabor finished second in his event with a
mark of 58-s.2s.Tabor’s mark was also third on
the all-time Stanford list.
“Our team will definitely try to continue to
build on these great performances as we now
enter the championship part of the season,”
Heath said. “It was really special to watch
Dylan, Justin and JT all compete so well this
weekend and to see some of the results from
all the hard work they have been putting in.”
Leading the way for the women was junior
Stephanie Marcy, who ran a provisional stan
dard time of 16:19.72 in the 5,000 meters. The
other provisional standard for the women
came from junior Whitney Liehr in the triple
jump. Liehr leapt a personal best indoor dis
tance of 41-8.5, putting her fourth on the Stan
ford all-time list.
Also faring very well for the women were
senior Griffin Matthew and freshman Carissa
Levingston in the sprints. Matthew won the
meet title in the 60 meters, finishing with a time
of 7.46 seconds. The young Levingston quickly
followed her, placing second with a time of 7.47
seconds. For Levingston, this time was a per
sonal best. The sprinting duo finished in first
and second again in the 200 meters, with times
of 24.14 and 24.24 seconds.
Next up for Stanford will be the MPSF
Championships in two weeks in Seattle. The
MPSF is the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion, the league in which the Cardinal com
petes for indoor track. The women will try to

while the men are looking to secure
a title as well.
“I look forward to the confer
ence championships and watching
our team continue to improve,”
Marpole-Bird said.
“Overall, we keep taking steps
forward to get ourselves ready for
MPSF and NCAAs,” Ferris added.
