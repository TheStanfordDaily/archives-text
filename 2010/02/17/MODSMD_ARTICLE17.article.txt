# GOLF FIRST AT HOME

### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 14 Stanford women’s golf
team swung into the spring season of
its schedule and got first place at its
own 36-hole Peg Barnyard Invitation
al on Saturday and Sunday. The Car
dinal played at the Stanford Golf
Course and won by just one stroke
over No. 10 Cal, which was the high
est-ranked team in the tournament.
Other teams competing were Fresno
State, Hawaii, Long Beach State, Ore
gon, San Jose State, Santa Clara,
Texas, UC-Davis and Washington.
Stanford shot an opening round of
304, tying for second place with Wash

ington at 20 shots above par. The team
was trailing Cal (296) by eight strokes
going into the second day of the tour
nament, but the players immediately
redeemed themselves on Sunday. The
Cardinal made up its eight-stroke
deficit and pulled ahead of both
Washington and Cal with a 292, a 12-
stroke improvement from the first
day.
“It was an amazing feeling know
ing that we bested Cal, especially be
cause this year they have such a fan
tastic team,” said sophomore Sydney
Burlison. “They beat us in Washing
ton in the fall, but it just made our vic
tory against them this weekend that
much sweeter.”

While Stanford has an intense ri
valry with the Golden Bears, the Card
golfers have a good relationship with
their fellow Bay Area golf team.
“It’s fun to see that both of us are
continuing to improve our programs
and gaining notoriety on the national
scene,” Burlison said.
The competition also showed how
small a margin of error there is in col
legiate golf.
“It’s funny, after 36 or 54 holes of
golf and with so many of us out there
playing, in the end it always does seem
to come down to one or two strokes,”
Burlison said. “It’s times like these
that really motivate us to stay com
mitted to every shot out there, and to
never give up, because at the end of
the day one swing could make all the
difference.”
Sophomore Lila Barton agreed,
adding, “Even over several rounds of
golf, you can never take any shot for
granted.”
After struggling with the first
round and shooting an 81 as an indi
vidual, Barton came back strong in
the second round and shot a 71 to end
up 10th in the tournament. She tied
with her freshman teammate Kristina
Wong (78-74-152).
Improvements from the fall have
also paid off in the new spring season
for freshman Sally Watson. Watson
shot a 73 the first round and a 71 the
second round to tie for the individual
title with Cal’s Joanne Lee (74-70-
144).
“She has done a great job this year
and is already a team leader, even as a
freshman,” Barton said of her team
mate Watson. “I have a lot of respect
for her game and for her as an individ
ual.”
Junior Rebecca Durham also
fared well, shooting a 77 the first day
and a 70 in the final round to place
third, three strokes behind Watson
and Lee.
Though the Card did not host the
tournament last year, this was Stan
ford’s third consecutive win at the In
vitational after claiming first place in
2007 and 2008. It was also the team’s
first victory of the year.
Next week. Stanford will continue
its upward climb as it heads to the Ari
zona Wildcat Invitational in Tucson,
Ariz.
The Cardinal will tee off and play a
long 36 holes on Monday that will
continue onto Tuesday for a final
round of 18 holes.
At the 54-hole event the team will
prepare to go up against some serious
competition in the Pac-10, always one
of the strongest conferences in
women’s golf. With its tough field, the
