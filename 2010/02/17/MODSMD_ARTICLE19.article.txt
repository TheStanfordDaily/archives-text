# Card wrestlers split weekend
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In its final home meet of the sea
son, Stanford wrestling scored its
first decisive victory over a Pac-10
opponent when it defeated visiting
Cal State Bakersfield 23-14. The
Cardinal (10-8-1,2-4-1 Pac-10) lost
only two matches to the Roadrun
ners (7-6, 2-5) and forfeited one
weight class (heavyweight) due to
injury.
After the forfeit to start the
meet, Stanford freshman Ryan
Mango took on Bakersfield’s Frank
Lomas in the 125-pound weight
class. The match was close through
the first two periods, and at the start
of the third period, the score was
tied 4-4. In the third period, Lomas
scored a quick reversal at 0:11 to
take a 6-4 lead. However, Mango
refused to give in, getting an escape
to draw within one point at 0:38. He
proceeded to score a takedown and

grab a 7-6 lead at 1:12 and hung on
for a tough 48 seconds to preserve
his lead and get the victory, despite
a nearly-successful escape attempt
in the closing seconds. Mango’s
record for the season is now 21-11.
“I was down, so I knew I jusfhad
to stay composed and come back,”
Mango said. “One takedown would
get the match for me, so I just tried
to keep my composure and go out
there relaxed.”
When asked about holding off
the last-second escape attempt.
Mango responded, “That’s an area
I’ve struggled in all year.The match
was on the line, and I knew I had to
do it. It wasn’t that tough it just
came.”
After the win at 125, the next
three weight classes were split 2-1 in
favor of the Card. Redshirt junior
Justin Paulsen and redshirt senior
Tyler Parker won the 133- and 149-
pound weight classes, respectively.
However, freshman Bret Baum
bach's struggles continued at 141,
where he was defeated 15-0 for a
technical fall by Bakersfield’s Elijah
Nacita.
“Bret’s performance wasn’t
what we were looking for,” said
head coach Jason Borrelli. “He’s re
ally in a tough stretch here, and we
have to get through it.”
The meet’s next close match
came at 157 pounds, where redshirt
freshman Mike Kent and Bakers
field's Andrew Balch wrestled each
other to a standstill. Through the
first two periods, the score was 1-0 in
Balch's favor on an escape at 1:27 in
the second period. In the third peri
od, Kent started down and scored a
quick escape to tie it at 1-1. From
there, Kent survived a last-second
takedown attempt and won 2-1
after getting the bonus point for rid

ing time.
Stanford proceeded to win the
next three weight classes to secure
the dual. However, freshman
Richard Kessler was unable to repli
cate his recent success in the meet’s
final match, falling to Riley Orozco
8-3.
“We're finally going out there
healthy and wrestling like the team
I know we can be,” Borrelli said.
“That was almost as happy as I’ve
been all year with our guys’ per
formance. Everyone, top to bottom,
went out and wrestled hard and did
n’t stop before the seven minutes
was up. When you do that, good
things happen.”
The team then traveled to
Tempe, Ariz. to take on Arizona
State (9-7,4-2) on Sunday. In the be
ginning, it seemed as though the
Cardinal would be able to continue
riding its momentum from Friday’s
match. The meet started at the 165-
pound weight class, and the Card
reeled off four straight victories, in
cluding a major decision by redshirt
sophomore Nick Amuchastegui at
165.
However, in the end the Sun

Devils proved to be too much for
Stanford, as they took the remaining
six matches after Kessler won at 197.
The Card suffered two close losses at
133 (Paulsen) and 149 (Parker)
losing both matches by one point.
The final score was 24-13 in favor of
Arizona State.
With its dual-meet season now
completed, the next challenge for
Stanford is the Pac-10 Champi
onships, which will be held in Davis,
Calif on Feb. 26-27. The Cardinal’s
best hope for victory lies with
Amuchastegui and redshirt junior
Zack Giesen, who are both current
ly first in the conference in their
weight classes —165 pounds and
184 pounds, respectively.
Borrelli believes that Stanford
has a significant amount of momen
tum heading into Pac-lOs and be
yond to the NCAA tournament.
“Right now, the guys are starting
to get healthy,” Borrelli said. “Once
you start to get healthy and you have
a win like that, it does a lot for your
confidence.”
