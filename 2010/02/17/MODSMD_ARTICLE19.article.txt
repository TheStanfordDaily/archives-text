## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In its final home meet of the sea
son, Stanford wrestling scored its
first decisive victory over a Pac-10
opponent when it defeated visiting
Cal State Bakersfield 23-14. The
Cardinal (10-8-1,2-4-1 Pac-10) lost
only two matches to the Roadrun
ners (7-6, 2-5) and forfeited one
weight class (heavyweight) due to
injury.
After the forfeit to start the
meet, Stanford freshman Ryan
Mango took on Bakersfield’s Frank
Lomas in the 125-pound weight
class. The match was close through
the first two periods, and at the start
of the third period, the score was
tied 4-4. In the third period, Lomas
scored a quick reversal at 0:11 to
take a 6-4 lead. However, Mango
refused to give in, getting an escape
to draw within one point at 0:38. He
proceeded to score a takedown and

grab a 7-6 lead at 1:12 and hung on
for a tough 48 seconds to preserve
his lead and get the victory, despite
a nearly-successful escape attempt
in the closing seconds. Mango’s
record for the season is now 21-11.
“I was down, so I knew I jusfhad
to stay composed and come back,”
Mango said. “One takedown would
get the match for me, so I just tried
to keep my composure and go out
there relaxed.”
When asked about holding off
the last-second escape attempt.
Mango responded, “That’s an area
I’ve struggled in all year.The match
was on the line, and I knew I had to
do it. It wasn’t that tough it just
came.”
After the win at 125, the next
three weight classes were split 2-1 in
favor of the Card. Redshirt junior
