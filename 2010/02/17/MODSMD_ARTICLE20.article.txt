# Card D’s new look in 2010?
## 
### Wyndam Mokowsky Between the lines 
The early weeks of February
belong to recruiting in the
college football world, and
accordingly, major Stanford
news has been overlooked.
With the hiring of former Baltimore
Ravens linebackers coach Vic Fangio
as the Cardinal’s new defensive coor
dinator, head coach Jim Harbaugh has
indicated that Stanford will begin im
plementing parts of a 3-4 package.
It will not be a full transition, at
least initially, but it does show a shift in
doctrine from the first three years of
Harbaugh’s tenure, when the defense
operated out of a 4-3 base.
What changes when your front
seven goes from three linebackers and
four linemen to the reverse? At the
most basic level, your defensive line
assumes more rush than pass respon
sibilities. The nose tackle, generally a
gargantuan individual, is charged with
plugging two gaps, while the defensive
ends could be converted 4-3 tackles
who, in the 3-4, are not expected to get
to the quarterback with the same fre
quency as their 4-3 counterparts. This
theoretically frees up the linebackers
the backbone of the 3-4 is disguis
ing the fourth pass rusher, who gener
ally comes from the outside. The two
inside linebackers split coverage and
rush responsibilities, and the strong
safety is more free to move around in
the box, although the duties of the de
fensive backfield remain largely the
same.
That’s the Reader’s Digest version.
It can obviously be changed around
quite a bit, from the “okie” to “eagle”
adaptations and more, and with Fan
gio alternating between the 4-3 and 3-
4, it will surely take on even newer
looks. But that is not our charge, at
least not until spring practice. Instead,
it is to look at the Cardinal’s current
roster and see what changes will have
to be made to create an effective 3-4
front.
Let’s start from the line and move
back, as there is some stability among
the starters. The 4-3 look is fairly set:
Chase Thomas and Tom Keiser at end,
Matt Masifilo and Sione Fua at tackle.
This shifts in the 3-4. Keiser would
likely retain his spot he has excel
lent size for an end but not the speed
to be an outside linebacker. And, of
the remaining players at the position,
he stands as the best against the run, a
more crucial part of the 3-4 end’s
game. Unfortunately, Reiser’s top trait
is his pass rushing ability, and that
stands to be fairly neutralized he
may be the athlete most hurt by such a
move.
The major issue with the switch to a
3-4 is that Stanford lacks a traditional
nose tackle. Think Terrence Cody.
There is no one on the Cardinal’s ros
ter that resembles him. The closest is
Fua, who would likely be helped out
by someone like Terrence Stephens,
but even then, it would be surprising if
Stanford let the nose tackle assume
the entirety of the two-gap responsi
bilities. This would in turn move Masi
filo, who is a bit smaller, to defensive
end, which may be a beneficial move
for him he’s already stout against
the run and is swift enough to handle a
position that requires slightly more
versatility.
With the line filled, Thomas would
go to outside linebacker, a potentially
wonderful switch with many ques
tions. He’s already demonstrated that
he is fast and can get after the quarter
back. But will his speed translate to
the open field? Can he cover? Answer

affirmatively, and Thomas could
wreak havoc; respond negatively, and
he becomes a situational guy.
The rest of the linebacking corps is
similarly up-in-the-air. Shayne Skov,
who saw extended work on the out
side in the 4-3, will likely move inward,
a more natural spot for him given his
physicality. But what of the rest?
Chike Amajoyi, who has extensive
starting experience's better suited for
the inside. Top recruit Blake Lueders
was described as a middle linebacker
by Harbaugh —he factors into the
equation as well.
And as for the final outside spot,
the major wildcard is Alex Debniak,
who was one of the most impressive
players in spring ball last year, but

missed the entirety of 2009 to injury.
Very fast and instinctual, he could be a
nice addition opposite of Thomas.
As noted, the secondary should
stay fairly similar to the current 4-3
look, but if one player will benefit, it
would be Delano Howell. He would
likely get more opportunities to play
in the box, where has excelled thus far
in his career.
There are even more shifts among
the backups Trent Murphy, for in
stance, who was highly lauded as a
scout team player throughout the
year, would likely make the DE to LB
move, much like Thomas. It is a shake
up, to be sure, but when your defense
finishes the year ranked No. 90 in the
nation, a little change can be a good
thing.

Only six and a half more months until
we see ifWyndam Makowsky’s pre
dictions come true. Count down with
