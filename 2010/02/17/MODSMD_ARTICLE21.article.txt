# Canada’s Olympics underwhelming
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
I’ve never been to Canada be
fore, but if NBC has taught me
anything, it consists only of pic
turesque snow-capped moun
tains, stunning waterfalls and
those bears from the Coca-Cola com
mercials. Also thanks to NBC, I now
know that Canada and America have
peacefully shared a long border for a
long time. And, contrary to popular be
lief, Canada has produced famous peo
ple.
So I guess Canada isn't completely
worthless, but with all due respect,
Canada, your Olympics blow.
This is your third time hosting the
Olympics, so you think you would

have figured out how to throw a good
one. Not even close.
How long have you been planning
the opening ceremonies? 12 months?
24 months? All that time you spent, all
that money you invested, all that
grandeur you had envisioned all ru
ined by a technical difficulty. You can
not mess up the opening ceremonies.
You just can’t.
And if you’re going to ruin some
part of the ceremony, choose any part
besides the actual lighting of the torch.

Forgetting to announce the Latvian
delegation or having k.d. lang’s mic go
out during her rendition of “Hallelu
jah” would be one thing. But leaving
Wayne Gretzky your hero, your
savior, your God stranded on stage
for nearly five minutes waiting for the
fourth cauldron to rise out of the floor
of BC Place (which never came) is sim
ply unacceptable.
It’s slightly karmic that the cere
monies ended in a complete flop, con
sidering how much you over-hyped
them. You tried claiming that three bil
lion people watched the opening cere-
monies. What the hell is in the Canadi
an tap water? Three billion? There are
about seven billion people in the world
and you’re saying more than 40 per
cent of them watched the ceremonies.
Hell, more than 20 percent of the
world's population doesn’t even have
electricity.
Outside of the BC Place, your
weather could not be worse. Rain and
fog is not good for snow sports. Did you
not leam anything from the Beijing
Olympics? You can control the weath
er. Amidst fears that the city was too
smoggy for athletes to compete in, Bei
jing officials used cloud-seeding can
nons to cause a rainstorm a few days
prior to the start of the games to wash
the air pollution away and prevent it
from raining during the games.
You? You just sat idly by and
watched as Mother Nature continues
to wreak havoc with your games.
Even the indoor athletes are under
pressure. Figure skaters are being
threatened for wearing fur. The fact
that this is one of the biggest headlines
coming out of the games thus far is de
pressing. I don’t care about figure skat
ing. I don't care about fur. And I cer
tainly don’t care about figure skaters
wearing fur. Yet whenever I tune into
NBC or its affiliates, I still hear U.S.
skater Johnny Weir talking about nut
job anti-fur activists. Is there really
nothing else to talk about?
And to top it off, an Olympian died
during a practice run. A few rain drops
here and there and discussions about
fur are not going to kill anyone, but ac
tually killing someone? That’s the ulti
mate no-no.
What are the Olympics supposed to
be a celebration of, again?

Mike Lazarus is totally blaming
Canada. Calm him down by sending
Anne Murray songs to mlazarus@
