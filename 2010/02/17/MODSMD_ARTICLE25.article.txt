# Men's tennis finds consolation at indoors

After three victories against lesser oppo
nents, the Stanford men’s tennis team faced ad
versity for the first time this year at the ITA Na
tional Team Indoor Championships in Char
lottesville, Va. this weekend.
Nine of the top 10 teams in the nation quali
fied for the prestigious tournament, which serves
as a barometer for the best teams in the country
and a preview of the NCAA Championships in
May.
On Friday, No. 8 Texas blanked No. 9 Stan
ford 4-0 in the first round of the sixteen-team
tournament. The Longhorns controlled the
match from start to finish.
For a team that has its sights set on an NCAA
title, it was a disappointing start to the weekend.
“They came out very inspired,” said Stanford
head coach John Whitlinger. “I think they re
membered losing to us at last year’s Indoors.”
Whitlinger refused to blame the loss on the
fact that the match was played indoors, but he
did suggest that it can be difficult for players to
adjust after months of outdoor tennis.
“Everything is controlled indoors,” he said.
“There’s no wind or sun. It definitely benefits
some styles more than others, but it’s still a ten
nis court.”
The Cardinal never recovered from a clean
sweep in the doubles matches. Dimitar Kutro
vsky and Josh Zavala of Texas upset Stanford’s
No. 1 ranked doubles team of sophomores
Bradley Klahn and RyanThacher, 8-6.
“They’ll [Klahn andThacher] admit that they
could have played better,” Whitlinger said. “But
I’m not worried about those guys. They’re so
good.”
The singles slate was equally disappointing
for Stanford. Thacher, junior Alex Clayton and
senior Richard Wire lost their matches in
straight sets. Klahn, freshman Matt Kandath and
senior Greg Hirshman were also losing when the
match was suspended.
After losing, Stanford was sent to the conso
lation bracket for the rest of the weekend.
“I was interested to see how our guys would
bounce back after a loss like that,” Whitlinger
said.
“No one was happy on Friday night,” Hirsh
man added.“ But a loss at this point in the season
can motivate you and force a little bit of intro
spection.”
Hirshman pointed out that USC lost in the
quarterfinals of last year’s indoor champi
onships, but went on to win the NCAA title.
“No one remembers that USC lost in Char
lottesville, they remember the national title,”
Hirshman said. “We can win the national title.”
Stanford rebounded with its two most im
pressive victories of the year against No. 30 Fres
no State on Saturday and No. 10 Kentucky on
Sunday.
The Cardinal swept the doubles matches
against Fresno State and quickly clinched a 4-0
victory. No Stanford player lost a set in the sin
gles matches.
Sunday’s match with Kentucky seemed like it
would be a tough one to win. Kentucky plays in
door tennis regularly and defeated No. 2 Virginia
the weekend before the National Indoors.
“We knew it was going to be a test,”
Whitlinger admitted.

In the top doubles slot, Klahn and Thacher
won their doubles match 8-4 against Brad Cox
and Eric Quigley. Wire and Clayton clinched the
doubles point with a breezy 8-1 victory over
Kentucky’s Alberto Gonzalez and Alex Lam
bropoulos.
Whitlinger expressed excitement about Stan
ford’s doubles teams, especially because of the
recent play of the upperclassman tandem of
Wire and Clayton.
“If they can continue to do that,” he said, “I’ll
feel really good about our doubles heading for
ward.”
In the sixth singles slot, Hirshman played his
best tennis of the weekend and made quick work
of Graham Dyce, 6-1,6-1.
Thacher beat Cox 6-4,6-4 to give Stanford a
3-0 lead.
The top two matches were tight battles. In the
top spot, Klahn eventually fell to Quigley, 6-2,7-
6. Clayton went to three sets with Alex Musialek,
but the match was never finished because the
team’s win had already been clinched.
It looked like Kentucky might stage a come
back when Gonzalez defeated Stanford fresh
man Matt Kandath, 6-4,7-5, and made the over
all match score 3-2.
But the senior Wire came through in the
fourth singles Spbt with a victory and clinched
the match for the Cardinal, 4-2.
Stanford finished the weekend with a 2-1
record and witfr& better idea of what it needs to
work on to become NCAA champion.
“We’re only at mile eight or nine in the
marathon,” Hirshman said. “What matters is
where you are at mile 26.2.”
Stanford now has a busy weekend, with home
matches against Boise State on Friday and Cal
on Saturday.
