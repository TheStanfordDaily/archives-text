A dominant performance against No. 59
Sacramento State (3-2) kicked off a three
game home stand for the newly No. 8 Stanford
women’s tennis team (5-0) as it blanked the
Hornets 7-0 at Taube Tennis Stadium.
February has been a good month for the
women’s team so far. Highlighted by a 5-0 start
to the season, the team has also garnered some
individual awards. Senior Lindsay Burdette
took home the Pac-10 Player of the Week title
for the first week of the month after matches
against two Texas teams.
Losing only nine games in two singles
matches, Burdette defeated No. 67 Kayla Dun
can and a day later defeated No. 27 Krista
Damico. She is 9-4 overall, 5-0 in duals and is
currently on a four match winning streak.
Teaming with junior Hilary Barte, she went 2-0
over the weekend in doubles as well.The award
was her first career Player of the Week title and
the first for Stanford since last April.
“I actually didn’t know about it until other
people told me,” Burdette said. “I think it’s an
opportunity to look back on what we’ve al
ready accomplished this year as a team and just
feel good about the extra work. Obviously, I’m
individually proud, but the most rewarding
part is that I feel like it’s helping the team out.”
The Cardinal swept the doubles point in the
match against Sacramento State to open up a
1-0 lead that it never relinquished. Stanford’s
No. 1 duo of junior Hilary Barte and Lindsay
Burdette defeated the Hornets’ Clarisse Baca
and Katrina Zheltova 8-0 to start the day off
well.
With an 8-3 victory at the No. 2 spot and an
8-5 victory at No. 3, Stanford swept the doubles
for the fourth time this season. Tbe team’s one
doubles loss came against Texas, when fresh
men Stacey Tan and Mallory Burdette lost 9-8
(5) despite being ahead for most of the match.
“[The Hornets] were a lot better than
they’ve been in past years,” Lindsay Burdette
said. “We all took care of business, but it was
great to get in another quality match against a
quality opponent before we go down and play

in LA. Everyone played really well, and they
pushed us in doubles.”
Singles proved to be relatively straightfor
ward as well. Sophomore Veronica Li cruised
through her match 6-1,6-2 over Aileen Tsan to
record the first singles victory on the day for
the Cardinal, and Barte recorded a convincing
6-3, 6-4 victory over No. 26 nationally ranked
Zheltova. Junior Carolyn McVeigh was pushed
in her first set against Baca before winning 7-5,
6-2 to clinch the match at the No. 5 spot.
“Fve played [Zheltova] the last two years I
was here, and I don’t think she’s a huge fan of
how our games match up,” Barte said. “She
likes to hit the ball really hard when it is in her
strike zone. Especially since I’m left handed, I
can get it out of her strike zone, so she doesn’t
like that very much.”
With the Hornets dispatched and the
weather beginning to look better, Stanford
looks to welcome No. 35 Boise State to its
home court. Boise State has a winning season
so far at 3-2, and both losses have come against
teams ranked in the top 50. The Broncos were
blanked by No. 17 North Carolina at the ITA
National Team Indoors before losing again at
the same tournament to No. 46 DePaul, a
minor upset. Their wins have come against un
ranked Montana and Montana State and a
home-win over No. 60 Colorado.
“I don’t think we’ve played them, at least
not since I’ve been here,” Barte said. “I know
that their top doubles team and top few singles
are great. We’ll handle them, but it will be a
good test. It’s just good to keep sharp.”
These few weeks of matches have set a
pleasant pace for the team. With only one
match a week, the players are using the extra
time to catch up on all their activities outside of
tennis.
“I appreciate the break,” Barte said. “There
is just a ton of work to do and something every
hour, but I’d rather have it that way than just be
sitting around all day.”
The team plays Boise State today at 1:30
p.m. at Taube Family Tennis Stadium, looking
to remain undefeated in dual match play.
