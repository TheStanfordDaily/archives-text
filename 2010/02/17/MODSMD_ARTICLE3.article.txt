## Researchers call for North Korea policy Former' CIA analyst gives nuclear diplomacy opinion 
### PHILIPPE DE KONING 
Stanford University researchers
issued a call last week to the
Obama administration for a new
policy toward nuclear diplomacy
with North Korea in “Activating a
North Korea Policy,” an article pub
lished in the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists.
Robert Carlin, a former top
North Korea analyst at the CIA
and the State Department, and
John Lewis, a senior fellow at the
Freeman Spogli Institute, authored
the article.
The plea comes just as North
Korea has signaled a willingness to
discuss its nuclear weapons pro
gram with envoys from China, the
United States and the United
Nations. Carlin’s and Lewis’s piece
invites the Obama administration
to shift away from a hard-line strat
egy toward Pyongyang and use the
current period of relative calm to
pursue a strategy of engagement.
Last year. North Korea defied
the international community by
launching its first nuclear test since
2006, sparking an international out
cry and jeopardizing the already
fragile international nonprolifera
tion framework. North Korea is
currently estimated to have
between six and 10 plutonium
based nuclear weapons.
North Korea also heightened
tension with the United States
when it sentenced two American
journalists to 12 years in prison last
year, though the journalists were
eventually released after a visit
from former President Clinton in
August.
For Carlin, as well as for Lewis,
who has visited North Korea more
than 15 times since 1986, any recent
tensions should not drive policy
determinations.
“Washington appears to be suf
fering from severe amnesia,” Carlin
said in an interview with The Daily.
Paradoxically, he said, a successful
1994 agreement that took signifi
cant steps toward a non-nuclear
North Korea is being used by
Washington as a justification for a
hard-line policy demanding noth
ing less than total denuclearization.
Carlin highlighted the period
from 1994 to 2000 as one of suc
cessful talks between the United
States and North Korea: the North
Koreans agreed to discontinue the
construction of two large nuclear
reactors and decrease their produc
tion of the fissile material used in
nuclear weapons.
Early last decade, however, the
North Koreans were accused by the
Bush administration of violating the
1994 Agreed Framework, resulting
in North Korea’s departure from
the agreement. Carlin claims that
the extreme focus Washington
places on the failure of this agree
ment is an oversimplification that
hinders the Obama administration
in its ability to craft a coherent and
realistic policy for the eventual
denuclearization of North Korea.
“The Agreed Framework was
successful in many ways,” Carlin
said. “Both sides learned to

strengthen the foundations for a
process that could meet their
respective needs. Why wouldn't we
want a deal of this kind again?”
He and Lewis further argue that
the current shape of sanctions is not
accomplishing much to advance the
goal of a non-nuclear North Korea.
“We’re not trying to say the
sanctions policy should be com
pletely altered,” Carlin said. “It
should be refined as the diplomatic
process starts to gain traction.”
“Given how China has ramped
up its trade with North Korea, what
can we really expect sanctions to
accomplish?” Carlin added.
Carlin suspects that the
Americans did not design any gen
uine “exit strategy” for sanctions,
which could be employed as the
North Koreans move closer to the
American position.
Although the U.S. envoy to
North Korea, Stephen Bosworth,
has started to hold informal talks
with the North Koreans, Lewis and
Carlin warned that this move will
ultimately be fruitless unless
Washington adjusts its rigid stance
toward the country.
“All we have done in the past
year is give[n] the North Koreans
free reign,” Carlin said.
