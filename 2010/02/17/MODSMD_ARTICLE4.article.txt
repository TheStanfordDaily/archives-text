# Admins explain tuition increase
## Details regarding the new $50,576 cost of undergraduate education for 2010-11 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Board of Trustees’
announcement last week of an increase in the
cost of attendance for the 2010-11 academic
year marks an attempt by the University to
find a difficult balance between its stated rev
enue needs and the concerns of students and
families weathering a trying economic cli
mate.
Last week, the board voted to approve a
3.5 percent increase in total undergraduate
charges tuition, room and board for the
2010-11 academic year. The increase will
bring the total annual cost of a Stanford
undergraduate education to $50,576.
While the cost of attendance will reach a
historic high, this is the lowest that the annu
al tuition increase has been in over 30 years, a
fact that board members and administrators
attribute to their attempt to alleviate the

effect of the current state of the economy on
students’ and families’ wallets.
“In deciding upon a figure for this year, we
were mindful of the recent economic crisis
and the effect that it has had on household
budgets,” said Tim Warner, the vice provost
for budget and auxiliaries management. “We
are trying to balance the twin objectives of, on
the one hand, keeping Stanford competitive,
but, on the other hand, recognizing that a
tuition increase does affect families and stu
dents.”
Leslie Hume, chair of the board of
trustees, also emphasized moderation in her
initial announcement, saying that the
University was “mindful of the economic
hardships facing many Stanford students and
their families.”
“We have tried both to moderate tuition
and to ensure generous financial aid for those
most in need,” Hume said following the
board’s Feb. 8-9 meeting.

Some of the additional revenue from these
increases could help fund salary increases for
the University’s faculty and staff. The money
will also help cover the University’s ever
increasing operating costs, according to
Warner.
“One thing that is important to keep in
mind is that revenue from tuition represents
the school’s main source of unrestricted
income, which is really critical because it gives
us the most flexibility in terms of the projects
that we can fund,” Warner said. “We use it to
support pretty much all aspects of operating
the University, as well as the fact that we hope
to increase salary for our faculty and staff
next year, which is something we were not
able to do last year.”
These revenues will not come only from
the undergraduate population. Trustees
approved increases in graduate tuition as
well, ranging from a 3.5 percent increase in
tuition for general graduate students, entering

MBA students and continuing medical stu
dents, to a 5.8 percent increase in law school
tuition.
For undergraduates and their families, in
particular, attention immediately turned from
the cost of attendance to financial aid.
“One of the things that makes this tuition
increase more manageable for families is the
financial aid program that we have in place
here at Stanford, which we feel is very com
petitive,” Warner said.
The board stated that the amount of
money dedicated to undergraduate financial
aid would increase proportionally to the
tuition increase. In a news release, trustees
said the University “expects to provide an
equal amount” of financial aid as this year,
when about 50 percent of undergraduates
received approximately $ll2 million in aid.
Administrators thus confirmed that the
