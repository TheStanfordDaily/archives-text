## THE
						WILD LIFE For conservationist George Schaller, it's all animals, all the time 
### ADAM COLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
George Schaller has locked eyes
with tigers, babysat lions and
crossed paths with gun-wielding
militias from Rwanda to
Afghanistan, all in an effort to
protect the world’s most engaging and most
threatened animals.
“I went into this whole business because I
enjoy watching animals, but you learn very
quickly that you have a moral obligation to
protect what you study,” he said.
Over the past five decades, Schaller has
done research in 23 countries, written 19
books and helped establish reserves that
cover an area almost as big as Spain.
Traveling with his wife and two sons, Schaller
has studied snow leopards, pandas, gorillas,
tigers, lions and antelopes all species
whose numbers are dwindling.
“Conservation is basically ethics, spiritual
value, beauty,” Schaller said. “It’s not hard
science per se, but it must be based on hard
science.”
Today at 7 p.m. in Bishop Auditorium, the
veteran conservationist will share some of
his memories and photos with the Stanford
community and high school students from
the Bay Area.
The presentation, titled “Science and
Adventure,” is the first in a series honoring

Jhumki Basu ‘9B, who passed away in 2008
after a long fight with breast cancer. Basu
was a New York University professor who
fiercely promoted high-quality science edu
cation for under-privileged students.
Schaller, currently the senior conserva
tionist with the Wildlife Conservation
Society, knows the importance of an early
introduction to science. Seventy-seven, gray
haired and lean, Schaller still speaks with a
hint of childhood excitement about conser
vation.
“Like most naturalists, I started out as a
kid interested in the outdoors,” he said.
Schaller’s work has taken him to remote
corners of the globe where gumption is a
prerequisite for research. He has donned
layer after woolly layer to follow hairy
antelopes across the frozen Tibetan plateau
and driven for hours in a Land Rover to
track down lion scat in the Serengeti.
“Scientific papers all sound very neat and
tidy,” Schaller said, “but I spend as much
time picking vehicles out of mud as doing
science.”
“If there’s a rock star in field biology,
George Schaller’s the guy,” added Alan
Launer, a research associate with the
Stanford Center for Conservation Biology.
“He’ll go out in the middle of nowhere for
months, even years, just to get important

“You learn
very quickly that
you have a moral
obligation to protect
what you study.”
