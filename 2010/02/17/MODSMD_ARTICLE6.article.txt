## Perspectives on coverage of trans surgery Students react to inclusion of sex reassignment operations in Cardinal Care 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
With the addition next year of transgen
der surgery coverage to Cardinal Care,
Stanford’s student health plan, some stu
dents say there are quality-of-life improve
ments on the horizon for transgender stu
dents here.
Some international students, who next
year are required to buy into Cardinal Care,
are expressing frustration with the plan,
whose transgender coverage they say they
won’t need.
By and large, however, many students
have welcomed the change.
“It is fantastic that Stanford is leading the
world in trans rights and equality by making
sure that trans students at Stanford are well
supported in the student health care plan,”
said ASSU executives David Gobaud, a
coterminal student, and Andy Parker ‘ll in a
statement.
The decision to cover transgender surgery
aimed to provide adequate medical
treatment for students with gender
identity disorder, according to Ira
Friedman, the director of Vaden
Health Center at Stanford.
Friedman said he does not expect
the coverage option to be widely
used.
“We do not anticipate a large
number of surgeries,” Friedman
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
“Having this benefit opens the plan
to additional expenses, but for the
plan as a whole we do not anticipate
that the impact will be very costly.”
He said the decision to cover
transgender surgical treatments was
made after students and staff articu
lated the transgender community’s
needs and concerns.
According to Juno Obedin-
Maliver, a fifth-year medical student
and co-founder of the Stanford
LGBT Medical Education Research
Group, the move is a statement
toward tolerance and acceptance of
the transgender community.
“By providing this surgery,
they’re saying that they’re willing to
think about and create a welcoming
environment for transgender

patients,” she said.
Obedin-Maliver said that trans
gender health care challenges can be
many; doctors may refuse to treat a
transgender person due to fear,
transphobia or inexperience, and
without proper insurance, health
care costs for transgender people
can skyrocket.
“Denying care to transgender
individuals is inappropriate and dis
respects their diagnosed condition,”
Obedin-Maliver said.” By covering
this care, we can make sure it’s done
in a quality way that avoids compli
cations in the future.”
Charles Syms ‘ll, an LGBT

Community Resources Center stu
dent staff member, pointed out that
the change allows transgender stu
dents to live more comfortably in
general.
“There are still many ways in
which transgender students face dis
crimination here,” he said. “For
example, changing one’s registered
name is an extremely cumbersome
process, and students have reported
different names appearing on the
diploma and the Cardinal Careers
recruiting Web site.”
For some international students,
however, the addition of transgen
der surgery coverage raises cost con
cerns as. it coincides with a new
requirement that all foreign students
buy into Cardinal Care next year.
“Most students in my community
(Chinese community) find Cardinal
Care super expensive and complete
ly unnecessary as things that would
never be helpful to most of us, such
as transgender surgery, are now cov
ered,” wrote Crystal Yin, a first-year
graduate student in management
science and engineering, in an e-mail
to The Daily.
Across the bay, UC-Berkeley
instated services for transgender
members in their Student Health
Insurance Plan in August 2009.
