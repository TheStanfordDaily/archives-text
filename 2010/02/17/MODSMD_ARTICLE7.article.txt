## Senators debate SSD stipends for officers 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With special fees petitioning season on
its way, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
last night considered the projected Student
Services Division (SSD) budget, which will
move SSD to special fees for the first time
this year. A number of senators expressed
clear opposition to the allotted stipends,
suggesting that SSD officers ought not be
paid through the special fee at all.
SSD envelopes the ASSU Shuttle
Service, the Green Store, the Wellness
Room, the Tutoring for Community pro
gram and Technology Consulting Services.
According to ASSU Vice President
Andy Parker Tl, who presented the budg
et, last year’s Senate approved stipends for
nearly “twice as much” for SSD officers.

However, as this year’s Senate tightens
its financial belt, many remain skeptical
if not firmly opposed to the proposed
SSD budget.
Slow Move Toward Elimination of
Stipends?
“We don’t just hand out money for
director stipends,” said Alex Katz ‘l2, the
chair of the Administration and Rules com
mittee. The Senate typically does not sup
port officer stipends for special fees groups,
he added. Katz was particularly opposed to
the more than $lO,OOO spent on director’s
salaries, which represents nearly 30 percent
of the budget right now.
Many senators agreed with Katz’s call
toward “eliminating, not trimming,” officer

The ASSU argues over the Student Services Division (SSD) budget and questions the legitimacy of
director's salaries for VSOs, citing compensation for a "substantial" workload at yesterday's meeting.
