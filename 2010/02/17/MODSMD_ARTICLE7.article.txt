## Senators debate SSD stipends for officers 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With special fees petitioning season on
its way, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
last night considered the projected Student
Services Division (SSD) budget, which will
move SSD to special fees for the first time
this year. A number of senators expressed
clear opposition to the allotted stipends,
suggesting that SSD officers ought not be
paid through the special fee at all.
SSD envelopes the ASSU Shuttle
Service, the Green Store, the Wellness
Room, the Tutoring for Community pro
gram and Technology Consulting Services.
According to ASSU Vice President
Andy Parker Tl, who presented the budg
et, last year’s Senate approved stipends for
nearly “twice as much” for SSD officers.

However, as this year’s Senate tightens
its financial belt, many remain skeptical
if not firmly opposed to the proposed
SSD budget.
Slow Move Toward Elimination of
Stipends?
“We don’t just hand out money for
director stipends,” said Alex Katz ‘l2, the
chair of the Administration and Rules com
mittee. The Senate typically does not sup
port officer stipends for special fees groups,
he added. Katz was particularly opposed to
the more than $lO,OOO spent on director’s
salaries, which represents nearly 30 percent
of the budget right now.
Many senators agreed with Katz’s call
toward “eliminating, not trimming,” officer

The ASSU argues over the Student Services Division (SSD) budget and questions the legitimacy of
director's salaries for VSOs, citing compensation for a "substantial" workload at yesterday's meeting.
salaries.
“That’s why they’re called volun
tary student organizations,” added
Anton Zietsman T2, chair of the
Appropriations committee, saying
that in the budget’s current form, he
would not support its approval.
“[The stipends are] not reasonable
and not justified,” he added.
While Parker suggested that the
“substantial” workload for these
positions was reason enough to pay
officers, Katz remained uncon
vinced.
“I believe small stipends are
appropriate,” Parker said in an
interview with The Daily. He noted
two other organizations FLiCKS
and the Speakers Bureau which
are both on special fees and also
provided officer stipends in their

budget last year. “[SSD’s budget]
would actually be keeping with that
trend,” he said.
According to Parker, the original
vision for SSD was to cover it with
the reserve funding for up to a year
and then move it to special fees for
funding this year. However, in its
current form, this goal may be easi
er said than done.
“This is going to be a very con
tentious issue among special fees
FOs [financial officers], and as a
special fees FO, I’d be pretty
pissed,” Katz said.
Parker suggested that SSD will
not follow the most common route
to funding by first seeking Senate
approval and then garnering an
additional 10 percent approval vote
from students. Instead, SSD’s peti
tion will directly solicit 15 percent
approval from the student body for
the budget increase.
Brian Wanyoike ‘l2, chair of the
Advocacy committee, warned that it
would be “absolutely ridiculous” for

SSD to seek 15 percent student
approval without soliciting Senate
support at all.
“It’s like there’s no good faith
[SSD] should come to the Senate,”
Zietsman added.
Parker defended the decision by
acknowledging that the SSD budget
sidesteps the funding policies put in
place by Appropriations and, as a
result, suggested that it would not
make sense to seek Senate
approval.
With an eruption of questions
about SSD as a protectorate of a
number of organizations that ought
to be running independently, the
budget discussion was tabled for
further discussion until next week.
Previous Notice Bills Passed
Tuesday’s meeting saw the pass
ing of all its funding bills, along with
an assortment of other legislative
bills, including several that dealt
directly with alleviating special fees
pressure for both students and

VSOs and one that removed a
clause from the joint by-laws which
would allow VSOs access to SUNet
ID numbers. The clause was deleted
to align the body with student pri
vacy concerns raised by the
University.
Minh Dan Vuong Tl, the finan
cial officer for Alternative Spring
Break, appeared on the Senate floor
during open forum to encourage the
Senate to think carefully about
future measures to secure VSOs
more control to grant or deny serv
ices for students who requested
refunds from their group.
“My concern is they’re just strik
ing it, but are they going to put in a
new system?” Vuong said after the
meeting.
The Senate has suggested that it
will work to find an alternate system
to ID numbers, perhaps drafting leg
islation that would allow access sim
ply to SUNet IDs so that VSOs
would have a list of compiled names
of those who requested refunds

from them in order to deny services
if they so chose.
Elections commissioners Quinn
Slack ‘ll and Cods Mitchell ‘l2
announced that polling stations are
scheduled to be set up at major din
ing halls, including Wilbur, Stern and
Lagunita, for the spring election.
They will also consider the possibili
ty of holding polling outside of
Green Library and areas more fre
quently visited by upperclassmen.
Senator Zachary Johnson TO
said he has begun drafting legisla
tion to create a buffer fund to
address future funding challenges
for student events, such as the fund
ing crunch faced by the junior class
cabinet with Mausoleum Party earli
er this year.
Tommy Tobin TO has been rec
ommended by the Nominations
Commission for the Board of
Judicial Affairs for spring quarter.
