## Bidding pride adieu Athletes sing, dance and strip down for charity 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
a m ive, Six, Seven, Eight!” yelled a
|H girl to her teammate, who went
A shooting into the air. The cheer
squad, a mass of red t-shirts and white hair
ribbons, was practicing a routine they had
run through at least a thousand times in the
last month in preparation for Nationals
but, more immediately, for the Athlete
Date Auction.
The cheerleader fell with a small thud
into the arms of several teammates, and the
squad skipped off-stage and into the crowd
as students filed into Cubberly Auditorium
Tuesday night.
A picture of the women’s lacrosse team
flashed on the screen in front, signaling the
beginning of the evening’s festivities. It was
Date Auction time.
The annual Athlete Date Auction fea
tured 23 varsity and club teams who
danced, pranced and showed more than a
little skin on stage to encourage bidding
from the audience.
The funds raised by the date auction
benefit Camp Kesem, a Stanford student
run summer camp provided free of charge
to children whose parents suffer from can

cer. This year’s goal was to improve upon
last year’s fundraising and make an
unprecedented $5,000 all in roughly
three hours.
“We’ve started raising a lot more money
over the years,” said coordinator Corinne
Smith Tl, who planned Date Auction from
behind the scenes. “There was a lot more
participation from different teams, and
we’re also trying to get people outside of
the athletic department. Increasing
involvement has been important in raising
the money.”
Cardinal Council, a group of athletes on
campus that promotes student welfare,
hosted the event. Smith said the date auc
tion “is away for athletes to get involved in
community service.”
“This is an awful lot of spandex,” one
attendee whispered to a friend as the event
kicked off.
Teams sat together and planned their
bids for the evening, encouraging girls to
raise their hands for male athletes, many of
whom took their shirts off. Indeed, remov
ing clothes seemed to be a winning strate
gy in encouraging audience members to
bid. To encourage larger contributions, co
host Austin Quarles Tl even promised “a
kiss from Andrew Luck” following a sere

nade by one of the football players.
Routines ranged from the men’s golf
team telling dirty jokes about Tiger Woods
to both gymnastics teams performing
stunts on stage and at least three teams
sang along to 90s hit “Bye Bye Bye.”
The charity event did experience a brief
somber note after the ninth act when
Quarles reminded the audience that the
goal of $5,000 was not close to being
reached.
Following Quarles’ exclamation that
“we’re gonna make it rain up in here!” a
football signed by coach Jim Harbaugh and
two sideline football tickets sold for $550,
the highest bid up to this point.
Entire teams were also up for grabs,
and their prizes included laser tagging
dates and pool parties. Many of the pur
chases seemed to be made by athletes on
other teams, while acts consisted mostly of
freshmen athletes performing pelvic
thrusts and girls doing renditions of the
“stanky leg.”
Bids began at $5O. In a record-breaking
bid, the men’s rowing team raised $6OO fol
lowing a choreographed dance and chan
neling of Napoleon Dynamite onstage. Co
host Kelly Hill Tl, a redshirt sophomore
on the women’s rowing team, contributed

$B7 to make up the difference and meet the
$5OOO goal.
“I’m super stoked,” Hill said. “We raised
$2OOO last year and this year really pushed
the limits. The venue was packed, and we
raised [the] goal, which was absurd.
“What this does for Camp Kesem is
awesome,” she added.
All of the money raised is distributed
throughout different programs for the
camp.
“It’s a high goal and a lot to expect, and
I was nervous we weren’t going to get it,
but right at the end we pulled through,”
Smith said.
Cheerleader Julia Wycliff ‘l2 said that
while the atmosphere surrounding the
Date Auction is typically a fun one, it was
still “scary to perform.”
“It was a lot of fun, though, and I’m glad
we got to help out Camp Kesem,” she said.
“I’d say the general atmosphere is pretty
goofy, and it was kind of fun to see a bunch
of athletes let loose and dance around.”
“Plus, the soccer team took their shirts
off... definitely the best moment of the
night,” Wycliff added.
