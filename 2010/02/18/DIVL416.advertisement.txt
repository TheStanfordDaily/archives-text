There's a difference between communicating ideas and experiencing them. It's the difference
between memorizing a foreign language and thinking in one. Between studying ruins and
excavating them. Between analyzing dreams and living them. The difference is huge. And
it's the very essence of the University of Chicago Summer Session. Where students are
engaged at every level —intellectually, socially, personally, and professionally. Where you
can benefit from the value of taking university courses in an accelerated, intensive format.
Join us this summer for an extraordinary learning experience at the academic home to
85 Nobel laureates.
FOR STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND BEYOND.
