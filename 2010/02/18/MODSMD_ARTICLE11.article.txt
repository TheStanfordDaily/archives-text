## MAAN raises awareness through peformances 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
"I'm a MAAN."

That was the message boasted from T-shirts at
Wednesday's "MAAN Up" event, hosted at the
CoHo by the all-male group Men Against Abuse
Now (MAAN) as part of V-Week, a campus effort
to raise awareness about violence against women.
Donnovan Yisrael, MAAN's faculty advisor
and a manager for relationship and sexual health
programs at Vaden Health Center, introduced the
event sporting both a thick mustache and a skirt.
"What is Donnovan wearing... on his upper
lip?" Yisrael asked. He said that while growing
mustaches has nothing to do with violence against
women, the questions they generate do help to
raise awareness. His skirt also highlighted the seri
ous undercurrents of the event.

"Try putting on a skirt if you're a man and see
how you feel," Yisrael said. "The feeling that you
feel that shame or the embarrassment is tied
to the pain and guilt we feel like when we're not

acting like a man."
The event tried to adopt a humorous atmos
phere "to find away to get us to laugh at our
selves," according to Yisrael.
"We use humor to catch people's attention and
to attempt to bring men in to the dialogue, as men
sometimes feel with the issue of sexism that they
are being blamed," said Ted Westling 'l2, president
of MAAN.
Performances included pieces read by mem
bers of the Stanford Spoken Word Collective,
short speeches by MAAN members and skits
about not being a "bystander."
"The prompt was, 'Why are you involved?' and
I had never put that down in words. It was empow
ering," said speaker and MAAN member Trac
Dang 'l2. "And I think the variety of different
approaches [the event] took helps the message."
During his reading Dang said, "I'm a man
because of the men in my life ... men who, like
me, are not perfect. I will never know what it's like
to be anything other than a man in this world a
world [that], as men, we are responsible for chang

ing."
This echoed Westling's explanation of
MAAN's mission: leading men to join women in
ending violence against women.
"It's not about us, but about joining a move
ment," he said.
The group also tried to raise money throughout
"Manuary," a mustache-growing contest that
began in January and ended last night. Initially,
participants planned to auction off the opportuni
ty to shave off their facial hair, but for hygienic
reasons, canceled those plans.
Westling and Yisrael hoped that the event at
the CoHo would spread the message to a new
audience. Yisrael said that he believes that rela
tionship abuse and violence against women are
serious problems on campus.
"When you start opening up lines of reporting,
you find out that everybody you know or their
friends has been in a situation that is borderline or
is actually relationship abuse," Yisrael said.
