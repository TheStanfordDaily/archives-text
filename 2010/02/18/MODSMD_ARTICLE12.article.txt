## EDITORIAL Set spending caps for ASSU election campaigns 
### 
Every spring, as the ASSU election
nears, potential ASSU senators and
executive slates begin to canvass the
campus with flyers, banners and the other ac
coutrements of the campaign season. A num
ber of candidates even go one step further,
incorporating elaborately produced
You Tube videos, Web sites and other fea
tures into their campaigns. In the end, all of
the candidates collectively spend a hefty sum
just to reach their goals of getting elected to
student government. Now, it is time to cap
the amount of money candidates can spend
in pursuit of their election goals.
At the ASSU Senate meeting on Monday,
ASSU Vice President Andy Parker 'lO pro
posed a mandatory spending cap that, if ap
proved, would limit ASSU executive cam
paigns to $2,500 in financing while increasing
public financing to $l,OOO. There was consid
erable disagreement, however, over the con
stitutionality and practicality of Parker's pro
posal. As an alternative, ASSU Elections
Commissioner Quinn Slack 'll suggested
that the ASSU simply increase public financ
ing to $2,000 without capping the total
amount that can be spent on an election. In
the end, for the second week in a row, the sen
ators put off the issue of campaign spending
caps until another time.
The Editorial Board recommends that
the ASSU Senate not only enact the spend
ing caps proposed by Parker, but also cre
ate additional spending caps for ASSU Sen
ate candidates as well as the executive
slates. This is the best option for ensuring
that all candidates for ASSU positions are
elected based on their qualifications and
campaign platforms, rather than simply
their ability to make their names visible on

campus. Every year, along with all of the ac
tual serious policy discussion, the ASSU
election also sparks a publicity arms race
that oftentimes seems as gimmicky as the
competition to become the next Tree. If
candidates had a more limited amount of
funds with which to work, then maybe they
would be more inclined to center their cam
paigns on actual issues rather than slogans
and buzzwords.
Slack's alternative proposal to increase
public financing without spending caps
would be worse than doing nothing —it
would mean dramatically increasing ASSU
spending for elections, without actually level
ing the field of competition. Even with $2,000
in public financing, a less affluent executive
slate would still be at a considerable disad
vantage against a slate with greater personal
resources at their disposal. At a university
like Stanford, where students are given equal
opportunities despite the significant gap be
tween those on financial aid and those who
are wealthier, it is important to have a stu
dent government that reflects the diversity of
its student population, economically as well
in ethnicity and gender.
The Editorial Board recommends that
the ASSU Senate devote some serious atten
tion to actually pushing through election fi
nance reform. The last time that an election
spending cap came to a vote was in 1999, and
it was defeated. Now, in the year 2010, there
are even more reasons to cap election spend
ing than there were then. It is time to actual
ly do something about this issue. It may be
too late for the upcoming ASSU elections,
but maybe, if the Senate commits itself to this
issue, something can actually be done by the
spring of 2011.
