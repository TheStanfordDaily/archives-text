# ALTERNATIVE LIVING ... WITHOUT THE NAKED
## One-Day-Long Pretzel-Shaped Kama Sutra Techniques Are Not The Way To Go 
### Samantha Toh 
Last week, I told myself that I wouldn't
write about Valentine's Day. There is
just too much to be said about this
event to fit into my 800-word limit; and be
sides, most of it has already been said.
A week later, I realized I could not resist.
I excuse this atrocity with two reasons. First,
I am always late on the boat, so why should
writing a week-late Valentine's spiel deter
me? Second and even better, this time I am
not railing on about how consumerism
sucks, so there is little of my dictatorial yowl
ing you have to suffer.
Rather, it is a small and peculiar thought I
have to share. Two days before Valentine's, I
began thinking about the event quite a bit.
While I would like to think of myself as a bit
ter and vaguely shriveled isolationist, disillu
sioned by all romance, I actually spend many
a cold evening in Paris wrapped up in fluffy
blankets, getting teary and snot-nosed at clips
of "Tove Actually."
It is now, as my diehard, soppy and tradi
tional romantic side exposes itself to the
nude, that I would really like to talk about
love. Yes, I am in fact hearing your gags of
disgust from across a continent and the At
lantic. Over the dulcet tones of your vomit
ing, however, I would really like you to lend
me an ear, because I have not just been
thinking about a Disney prince and princess
love. Rather, I have been thinking about love
as the basis of how people, in relationships or
not, treat one another.
Valentine's Day is usually an event with
lots of bling. That day last year, I looked out of
my window at some absurd hour of the morn
ing, awoken by Stanford's Mariachi band
trooping into the front courtyard, strumming
and belting out a series of fancy songs. The
couple by the front door stood awkwardly
around as they played, the girlfriend looking
a bit like she was wilting.
"Oh my God," I saw her mouthing, look
ing like she was about to die.
It was probably from love. The whole
thing was very sweet and even ended with a
bit of snogging, of which I always approve.
But holidays like this always make me won
der if the bling manages to eclipse the small,
little things that people can do for one an
other things that involve more than just
serenades and men in costumes. The smallest
things, like sending thank you e-mails, open
ing a door, inviting somebody out to lunch
and letting them know that their company is
wanted, are all such important things that
can really make a person's day.
Keep in mind that you are talking to a girl
who needs constant excitement, a fact that
probably explains my bias against Valen
tine's. Rather than waiting a year for a day of

solid surprise, where crazy restaurant-going,
gift-wrapped packages and pretzel-shaped
Kama Sutra techniques abound, I would
rather little things happen all the time. I try
to do that in all my relationships, be it with
my friends, family or particularly sexy men. I
think the littlest things are important, and in
my defensive, mother fox way, I almost re
sent Valentine's for eclipsing the smaller mo
ments of effort.

To prove a point, I made a note whenever
something made me happy this week, and
frequently, my daily pick-me-ups were not
all that grandiose. From requests to Skype
with me to being named somebody's official
Love Advisor, from being affectionately
called a "picky cat" to receiving a brief note
from someone 1 had not heard from in a
while ... they were all fleeting, but great in
net endearment.

It's so much easier to remember the gi
gantic shows of love, but I resist it, perhaps to
please my reluctant isolationist, buried deep
in a corner of my personality. And though
sometimes it gets difficult keeping up a con
stant love of people, I still keep doing it, how
ever much it is trying sometimes to see the
appreciation of such an effort. Am I
masochistic? Probably. Am I irrationally
stubborn? Most definitely.
But all I can say to that is, every day
should be Valentine's Day!
Not really, but I hope you get what I
mean. I said that mainly to hear more clear
ly some trans-Atlantic puking.

Do you value small loves? Is Sam just crazy?
Tell her she is not at samtoh@stanford. edu.

Valentine s Day is usually
an event with lots of
bling.
