# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## The 						Dangers of (Over) Specialization

Choosing a major used to be a relative
ly simple proposition. In the 12th cen
tury, the University of Paris had four
faculties — law, medicine, arts and theology.
They must have done something right, as
these are the same disciplines that underlie
much of Stanford's organization (with a cou
ple of additions over the years).
Those four original subjects lasted for
centuries, gradually expanding as new forms
of scholarship emerged, such as the engineer
ing fields and the social sciences. The modern
era of globalization and specialization, how
ever, has changed this dynamic. Universities
are founding disciplines and programs with
remarkable alacrity. What was once a trickle
of new disciplines has turned into a flood.
Some universities in the United States now
actively advertise hundreds of majors, and
Stanford has crept past three digits between
undergraduate and graduate programs.

This reflects a broad trend at Stanford
and in American society over the past sever
al decades— the forceful push toward
greater levels of specialization. No under
graduate would be foolish to gain a broad
education when tightly-defined specialties
are the best economically. Or so the conven
tional wisdom used to say.
Today, however, the trend is not further
disintegration of the disciplines into smaller
pockets, but rather the reintegration of disci
plines into larger areas of knowledge, Neu
roeconomics, for example, is not a new disci
pline, but a unifying one of two social sci
ences. The people who will make the largest
impact in these fields are not the ones who
are trapped within one area, but those who
can see the connections between multiple
paradigms.
As students, we have the biggest advan
tage in this coming change. We have the tab
ula rasa necessary to understand these
changes, but we need to rethink how we
choose our classes and conceive our aca
demic programs to be truly successful. We
do not need to settle for one paradigm; we
need to demand to see as many of them as
possible.
First, let me be clear: some level of spe
cialization is good. I am reminded of the
adage, "When you are one in a million in
China, there are a thousand people just like
you." But choosing a single class in every de
partment is not a thoughtful plan. A well-de-

fined foundation is a necessary first step.
The danger of specialization, then, is
going too far. There is a necessary opportu
nity cost made when choosing classes or
reading a book. The more specialized one
becomes in an area, the less time there is to
develop connections with other disciplines.
Without those other connections, however,
it is difficult to channel ideas to others with
slightly different specialties. Overlap is nec
essary for even basic communication —just
place a theoretical math major and an art
history major into the same room and have
them talk about their work. Does one under
stand the other clearly? Probably not.
In some respects, we will all be special
ists — it's the natural order of higher educa
tion. But the world also demands what
Thomas L. Friedman calls "the Great Syn
thesizers," people who specialize in interact
ing between disciplines and ideas. Commu

nicating complex ideas that incorporate
multiple bodies of knowledge is the skill that
graduates and students need to have today.
Paul Krugman won the Nobel Prize in
economics last year— the highest award in
that field. At the same time, he discusses eco
nomics and politics in his column with The
New York Times. He expanded the theoreti
cal horizons of his own discipline, but he can
also communicate those ideas at a wide
range of levels. His writings also go beyond
economics, freely connecting his work with
that of others.

It is not just individuals who are chang
ing, but whole areas as well. On medicine,
Voltaire wrote, "Doctors are men who pre
scribe medicines of which they know little, to
cure diseases of which they know less, in
human beings of whom they know nothing."
Our knowledge increased over the last few
centuries, but enter any hospital, and such
words are likely still spoken by patients.
More than any other area, medicine has
radiated out to connect with the sciences, so
cial sciences and engineering disciplines.
Connecting the basic sciences with medicine
was given the particularly apt term "transla
tional medicine," and the concept now forms
a foundation of many medical schools, in
cluding Stanford's Medical School. Medi
cine can no longer be just about biology, but
instead must create a whole web of connec
tions with fields across the University.
In the final analysis, balance is key. There
is a risk of being both too general and too
specialized. Neither result is desirable.
Thankfully, Stanford is a particularly strong
school to get an interdisciplinary education.
As students, our responsibility is to realize
these nascent connections. That adaptability
will be particularly beneficial in a world that
seems to change by the second.
Receiving the broadest undergraduate
education possible is the best way to make
an impact on the world. Consider it the liber
al arts of the 21st century: engineering, sci
ences, social sciences and humanities work
ing together in one grand web of knowledge,
each informing the others.
And as each field begins to reform, we
may once again return to a smaller course
bulletin. Freely quoting Bill Gates, four dis
ciplines should be enough for anybody.
