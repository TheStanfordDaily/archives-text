To the Editor,

I would like to comment on your recent
Op-Ed, Curbing Transphobic Humor in Stan
ford Performances by Janani Balasubraman
ian 'l2. Encouraging public acceptance of
transpeople is a laudable goal. However, Bal
asubramanian implies that tolerance for sex
ual minorities is more important than free
dom of expression, a stance that needs to be
questioned.
Balasubramanian argues that transpho
bic remarks made in public should not be
tolerated, noting "We would not tolerate
outwardly racist, homophobic, or sexist re
marks in our performances." Perhaps I'm
splitting hairs, but I believe there is a cru
cial distinction to be made between speak
ing out against bigotry and refusing to tol
erate it. The first is courageous and quite
necessary; the second smacks of authoritar
ianism.

There is a dangerous sense on this campus
that if something is offensive, it should not be
said. Follow this to its conclusion and one
sees how political correctness turns into cen
sorship. Though Balasubramanian's goals are
worthy, I disagree with the means she advo
cates for achieving them. Calling for those
who disagree with you to be silenced is a dan
gerous precedent.

Yours,
Ben Casement Stall 'lO
