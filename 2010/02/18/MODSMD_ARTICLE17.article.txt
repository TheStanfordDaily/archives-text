## PIT BATTLE Card travels to famed McArthur Court to take on Oregon 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This weekend may mark Stanford's final road
trip of the season, but the Cardinal is still looking
for its first road win of the year when it faces Ore
gon tonight.
As if a routine trip on the road were not
enough, the Ducks' McArthur Court, fondly
known as "The Pit," is widely considered to be
one of the toughest venues in the country for vis
iting opponents to play in. The arena is known
for its unique acoustics the steep configura
tion of the stands coupled with raucous fans
makes for one of the most difficult places to play
in the country.
All of this does not bode well for a Cardinal
squad (11-14, 5-8 Pac-10) that has yet to win a
road game all season, not counting a win on a neu
tral court against Virginia in the Cancun Chal
lenge.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins remained confi
dent this week, however, seeing tonight's game as
more of an opportunity than anything else.
"We're looking forward to this road trip,"
Dawkins said. "This is our last time on the road
and we have an opportunity to get a win or two
here and we have to approach it that way. We have
to approach it one game at a time, though, and un
derstand our biggest game is Oregon. Oregon
State follows that."
Dawkins does have reason to be optimistic,
however. Oregon head coach Ernie Kent has built
a solid program in Eugene over the years, but his
Ducks (12-12, 4-8) are definitely having a down
year as they currently sit in last place in the con
ference. Stanford also had little trouble in the first
match-up between the two teams, disposing of the
Ducks by the score of 84-69 last month at Maples
Pavilion.
Oregon is led by its backcourt duo of sopho
more Malcolm Armstead and senior Tajuan
Porter, both of whom stand less than six feet. The
five-foot-six Porter burst onto the collegiate scene
as a freshman, helping his team reach the Elite
Eight in 2007, but he seems to have regressed (at
least in terms of points) in his senior year. Porter
averages 11.3 points a game, tying him with Arm
stead for the team lead.
That said, the Ducks are still a tough team to
face at The Pit Oregon is 10-5 at home, and
swept UCLA and USC in its most recent homes
tand. Considering the fact that Stanford is 0-10 on
the road, tonight's game will be anything but an
easy win for Dawkins's squad.
If the Cardinal is unsuccessful tonight, it will

have another decent shot at getting the road mon
key off its back when it faces Oregon State on Sat
urday. The Beavers have shown signs of life up in
Corvallis since head coach Craig Robinson
(brother-in-law to President Barack Obama)
took over, managing a 5-7 record in conference up
until this point.

Robinson used to coach in the Ivy League,
which is known for its ball control and methodical
half-court sets that ultimately result in fewer
points being scored. For better or worse, his team
seems to play like an Ivy League team: the
Beavers average fewer than 60 points a game,
Dawkins won't have to search through much film
to find a solution for the Beavers' offense, as Stan
ford held Oregon State to just 35 points in a 59-35
win at Maples Pavilion back in January.
All in all, while the Cardinal has not won a
game on the road this season, it probably has its
best shot to do just that in its final attempts. In any
case, Dawkins is confident in his squad and its di
rection.

"I like where our guys are headed," the sec
ond-year coach said. "Our guys have been work
ing very hard. They've gotten better on the road as
the season progressed. We just have to find away
at the end of the games to close, and that's some
thing that's going to require a little more attention
to detail, a little more of us being together in those
moments to pull each other through."
