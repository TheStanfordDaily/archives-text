# WOMEN SET FOR FINAL HOME GAMES
## 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
With the regular season winding down,
the No. 2 Cardinal can take a big step toward
clinching its 10th consecutive Pac-10 title
this weekend, hosting the Oregon schools in
its final home series of the conference
schedule. The Cardinal will face Oregon
(16-8,7-5 Pac-10) tonight and Oregon State
(9-14,1-11) on Saturday.

Still undefeated in Pac-10 play, the Car
dinal (23-1,13-0) is coming off a dominant
weekend in Washington, where it bested the
Huskies 58-36 and routed the Cougars 98-
67. Those victories put Stanford 3.5 games
ahead of second-place UCLA with just five
games remaining on the schedule, so a
sweep this weekend would secure at least a
share of the conference championship for
Stanford.

Tonight's opponents, the Ducks, should
certainly make for a competitive contest.
Oregon is currently on a four-game winning
streak, and head coach Paul Westhead in
his first year with the squad has molded
them into the nation's current No. 2 offen
sive team, averaging 85.3 points per game.
Last time Stanford faced the Ducks, the
Cardinal earned a solid victory, but still al
lowed a season-high point total, 100-80.
"I think it's a great fit, with [Westhead's]
style and the players [they've] recruited,"
said Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Their style fits their personnel, and they're
a very dangerous team because they're
never out of it, and they can shoot the ball so
well. They have very good, fundamental in
dividual players, plus they fit together really
well and a lot of them have played together
for a long time."

Oregon's explosive offense is headed up
by Taylor Lilley (17.8 points per game, 3.29
assists per game), Micaela Cocks (15.2 ppg,
3.2 rebounds per game) and Amanda John
son (13.1 ppg, 9.1 rpg).The trio has started in
all 24 games this season, and over the last
two weeks has led the team into a three-way
tie for third place in the conference.
The Beavers haven't fared quite as well
as their in-state counterparts recently, strug
gling to a 1-11 record in the Pac-10 after
playing a solid nonconference season. They
managed to challenge the Cardinal in the
teams' last meeting, however, holding Stan

ford scoreless for long stretches in the first
half and trailing just 29-27 at halftime. Stan
ford was able to rebound as the game
wound down, eventually winning 63-47.
"They played that game with an intense
tempo, and they are a very physical team,"
VanDerveer said. "They're not a big team.
