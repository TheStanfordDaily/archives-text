# WOMEN SET FOR FINAL HOME GAMES
## 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
With the regular season winding down,
the No. 2 Cardinal can take a big step toward
clinching its 10th consecutive Pac-10 title
this weekend, hosting the Oregon schools in
its final home series of the conference
schedule. The Cardinal will face Oregon
(16-8,7-5 Pac-10) tonight and Oregon State
(9-14,1-11) on Saturday.

Still undefeated in Pac-10 play, the Car
dinal (23-1,13-0) is coming off a dominant
weekend in Washington, where it bested the
Huskies 58-36 and routed the Cougars 98-
67. Those victories put Stanford 3.5 games
ahead of second-place UCLA with just five
games remaining on the schedule, so a
sweep this weekend would secure at least a
share of the conference championship for
Stanford.

Tonight's opponents, the Ducks, should
certainly make for a competitive contest.
Oregon is currently on a four-game winning
streak, and head coach Paul Westhead in
his first year with the squad has molded
them into the nation's current No. 2 offen
sive team, averaging 85.3 points per game.
Last time Stanford faced the Ducks, the
Cardinal earned a solid victory, but still al
lowed a season-high point total, 100-80.
"I think it's a great fit, with [Westhead's]
style and the players [they've] recruited,"
said Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Their style fits their personnel, and they're
a very dangerous team because they're
never out of it, and they can shoot the ball so
well. They have very good, fundamental in
dividual players, plus they fit together really
well and a lot of them have played together
for a long time."

Oregon's explosive offense is headed up
by Taylor Lilley (17.8 points per game, 3.29
assists per game), Micaela Cocks (15.2 ppg,
3.2 rebounds per game) and Amanda John
son (13.1 ppg, 9.1 rpg).The trio has started in
all 24 games this season, and over the last
two weeks has led the team into a three-way
tie for third place in the conference.
The Beavers haven't fared quite as well
as their in-state counterparts recently, strug
gling to a 1-11 record in the Pac-10 after
playing a solid nonconference season. They
managed to challenge the Cardinal in the
teams' last meeting, however, holding Stan

ford scoreless for long stretches in the first
half and trailing just 29-27 at halftime. Stan
ford was able to rebound as the game
wound down, eventually winning 63-47.
"They played that game with an intense
tempo, and they are a very physical team,"
VanDerveer said. "They're not a big team.

GAME NOTES: No. 2 Stanford begins its final two
game homestand of the season when it faces the
Oregon Ducks. Oregon has the second-highest
scoring offense in the nation. This offense scored 80
points against the Cardinal in the teams' first
matchup, but the Ducks also allowed 100 points in
Stanford's victory.

but they don't beat themselves. They
screen and box out and do a lot of the
fundamental things, but they're also
not the offensive juggernaut that
Oregon is."
Junior guard Jeanette Pohlen, who
played against the Beavers last month
despite suffering an ankle injury
against Washington the week before,
thinks that Oregon State shouldn't be
underestimated.
"Oregon State's a dangerous team
... they're young, they play hot, and
Oregon State's a tough place to play
at, so hopefully we'll come out a little
tougher," Pohlen said. "I don't think
we really showed them what we can
do [last time], both offensively and
defensively, so we'll really try to take
it to them this time."
Pohlen has been a key contributor
for the Cardinal recently, averaging
9.5 ppg in her last four outings. She's

been impressive with her accuracy,
shooting 46.2 percent overall and a
tremendous 43.8 percent from the
perimeter. The Brea, Calif, native has
averaged 30.7 minutes per game this
season, second behind only junior for
ward Kayla Pedersen, and has been a
staple of Stanford's staunch defense
this season.
"Jeanette is working really hard in
practice, and watching a lot of video
tape," VanDerveer said. "I think she's
really taken ownership of improving,
and she's making better decisions and
really playing smarter. She has great
skills, and I think she's just taking her
time to play with a real purpose in
stead of just going out there and going
up and down the court."
While she acknowledges the re
cent improvement in her perform
ance, Pohlen herself says that her of
fense hasn't been a particular concern
for her lately.
"I try not to focus so much on my
offense, believe it or not," she said.
"Sometimes your offense will come
when your defense comes, and I've
been trying to focus on my defense a

lot and just trying to let my offense
come. A lot of it's just shot selection
too, taking a good shot when you're
open."
Pohlen is not the only one hitting
her stride recently, as freshman for
ward Joslyn Tinkle posted her first
double-double of the season (12
points, 10 rebounds) against Washing
ton State last weekend in just 17 min
utes of play. The Missoula, Mont, na
tive missed several games with a
stress reaction in her foot earlier this
season, but has played in 20 games
since. She's currently shooting 44.7
percent from the field.
"We're really hoping and counting
on her to give us that kind of produc
tion and come off the bench," Van-
Derveer said. "1 think she played
about 17 minutes, and we need her to
play more. We need her to rebound
more and be more aggressive... I
think Joslyn's awesome and I'm glad
she had that breakout game, and now
we want it every game."
Another Cardinal player heating
up recently should certainly be famil
iar to even casual Stanford fans

senior center Jayne Appel.The reign
ing Pac-10 Player of the Year who
recently became Stanford's all-time
rebounding leader averaged 21.5
points and 13.5 rebounds last week
end, and has shot 58.9 percent from
the field over her last four games.
"I'm really excited about how ag
gressive Jayne is playing... She's an
All-American and she's playing like
an All-American," VanDerveer said.
"I just love her aggressiveness and
how well she's playing now, and we're
a contending team with her getting
that done inside."
While the possibility of a national
championship is at the top of every
one's mind as the postseason looms, it
is also a somewhat bittersweet time of
year for VanDerveer and the Cardi
nal faithful, as Appel and fellow sen
ior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude play some
of their last games at Maples Pavilion.
The graduating class will be honored
during Saturday's game, when Stan
ford holds its annual Senior Day.
"It's hard," VanDerveer said of
seeing her seniors near the end of
their careers. "It goes really fast. And
with someone like Ros, being a fifth
year senior, even that goes so quickly.
Sometimes I just want to stop some of
our freshmen and say, you know, 'feel
a sense of urgency,' because you want
them to get after it in every practice
and every game [like the seniors do.]"
Stanford will kick off its final regu
lar season homestand tonight at 7
p.m. against the Ducks. The action at
Maples Pavilion will continue on Sat

Pohlen is not the only one hitting

since. She's currently shooting 44.7
percent from the field.
"We're really hoping and counting
on her to give us that kind of produc
tion and come off the bench," Van-
Derveer said. "1 think she played
about 17 minutes, and we need her to
play more. We need her to rebound
more and be more aggressive... I
think Joslyn's awesome and I'm glad
she had that breakout game, and now
we want it every game."

recently became Stanford's all-time
rebounding leader averaged 21.5

the field over her last four games.
"I'm really excited about how ag
gressive Jayne is playing... She's an
All-American and she's playing like
an All-American," VanDerveer said.
"I just love her aggressiveness and
how well she's playing now, and we're

While the possibility of a national

With the regular season winding down,
the No. 2 Cardinal can take a big step toward
clinching its 10th consecutive Pac-10 title
this weekend, hosting the Oregon schools in
its final home series of the conference
schedule. The Cardinal will face Oregon
(16-8,7-5 Pac-10) tonight and Oregon State
(9-14,1-11) on Saturday.

Still undefeated in Pac-10 play, the Car
dinal (23-1,13-0) is coming off a dominant
weekend in Washington, where it bested the
Huskies 58-36 and routed the Cougars 98-
67. Those victories put Stanford 3.5 games
ahead of second-place UCLA with just five
games remaining on the schedule, so a
sweep this weekend would secure at least a
share of the conference championship for
Stanford.

Tonight's opponents, the Ducks, should
certainly make for a competitive contest.
Oregon is currently on a four-game winning
streak, and head coach Paul Westhead in
his first year with the squad has molded
them into the nation's current No. 2 offen
sive team, averaging 85.3 points per game.
Last time Stanford faced the Ducks, the
Cardinal earned a solid victory, but still al
lowed a season-high point total, 100-80.
"I think it's a great fit, with [Westhead's]
style and the players [they've] recruited,"
said Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Their style fits their personnel, and they're
a very dangerous team because they're
never out of it, and they can shoot the ball so
well. They have very good, fundamental in
dividual players, plus they fit together really
well and a lot of them have played together
for a long time."

Oregon's explosive offense is headed up
by Taylor Lilley (17.8 points per game, 3.29
assists per game), Micaela Cocks (15.2 ppg,
3.2 rebounds per game) and Amanda John
son (13.1 ppg, 9.1 rpg).The trio has started in
all 24 games this season, and over the last
two weeks has led the team into a three-way
tie for third place in the conference.
The Beavers haven't fared quite as well
as their in-state counterparts recently, strug
gling to a 1-11 record in the Pac-10 after
playing a solid nonconference season. They
managed to challenge the Cardinal in the
teams' last meeting, however, holding Stan

ford scoreless for long stretches in the first
half and trailing just 29-27 at halftime. Stan
ford was able to rebound as the game
wound down, eventually winning 63-47.
"They played that game with an intense
tempo, and they are a very physical team,"
VanDerveer said. "They're not a big team.

GAME NOTES: No. 2 Stanford begins its final two
game homestand of the season when it faces the
Oregon Ducks. Oregon has the second-highest
scoring offense in the nation. This offense scored 80
points against the Cardinal in the teams' first
matchup, but the Ducks also allowed 100 points in
Stanford's victory.

but they don't beat themselves. They
screen and box out and do a lot of the
fundamental things, but they're also
not the offensive juggernaut that
Oregon is."
Junior guard Jeanette Pohlen, who
played against the Beavers last month
despite suffering an ankle injury
against Washington the week before,
thinks that Oregon State shouldn't be
underestimated.
"Oregon State's a dangerous team
... they're young, they play hot, and
Oregon State's a tough place to play
at, so hopefully we'll come out a little
tougher," Pohlen said. "I don't think
we really showed them what we can
do [last time], both offensively and
defensively, so we'll really try to take
it to them this time."
Pohlen has been a key contributor
for the Cardinal recently, averaging
9.5 ppg in her last four outings. She's

been impressive with her accuracy,
shooting 46.2 percent overall and a
tremendous 43.8 percent from the
perimeter. The Brea, Calif, native has
averaged 30.7 minutes per game this
season, second behind only junior for
ward Kayla Pedersen, and has been a
staple of Stanford's staunch defense
this season.
"Jeanette is working really hard in
practice, and watching a lot of video
tape," VanDerveer said. "I think she's
really taken ownership of improving,
and she's making better decisions and
really playing smarter. She has great
skills, and I think she's just taking her
time to play with a real purpose in
stead of just going out there and going
up and down the court."
While she acknowledges the re
cent improvement in her perform
ance, Pohlen herself says that her of
fense hasn't been a particular concern
for her lately.
"I try not to focus so much on my
offense, believe it or not," she said.
"Sometimes your offense will come
when your defense comes, and I've
been trying to focus on my defense a

lot and just trying to let my offense
come. A lot of it's just shot selection
