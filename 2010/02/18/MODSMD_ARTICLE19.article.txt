## CARD HIRES NEW FOOTBALL COACHES Harbaugh adds Ron Turner and Derek Mason to staff 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An offseason of turnover is seemingly over, as the
Stanford football team finalized its coaching hires on
Wednesday. The Cardinal announced several long
expected moves that shake up the staff on both sides
of the ball.
The most recent additions, quarterbacks and wide
receivers coach Ron Turner and defensive backs
coach Derek Mason, both come to The Farm after
stints in the NFL. Turner most recently served as the
offensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears, and was
previously an assistant at Stanford in the late 1980s
and early 19905.
"Not only does Ron Turner have a great deal of fa
miliarity with Stanford University, but he also was my
coordinator and position coach in Chicago, and I
have long held a tremendous amount of respect for
the job he does," said head coach Jim Harbaugh.
Mason comes from the Minnesota Vikings, where
he was the assistant defensive backs coach for three
seasons.
"Derek is a tremendous person, an outstanding
teacher, a spiritual model, a strong communicator, a
hard worker and a consummate winner," Harbaugh
said. "I feel very confident that we hired the best sec
ondary coach for Stanford in the country."
They join three other, previously announced new
comers to the Cardinal ranks: defensive coordinator
and linebackers coach Vic Fangio, special teams coor
dinator Brian Polian and defensive line coach Randy
Hart. Both Polian and Hart come over from Notre
Dame, where they served in their current capacities,
while Fangio heads to Stanford from the Baltimore
Ravens, where he was last the linebackers coach and
special assistant to head coach John Harbaugh, Jim's
brother.
The five additions to the Cardinal staff replace a
number of departed coaches. Co-defensive coordina
tor and linebackers coach Andy Buh left to be the de
fensive coordinator at Nevada, his alma mater. Run
ning backs coach Willie Taggart assumed the head
coaching job at Western Kentucky, where he was a
star quarterback in the 19905. He was
joined by defensive backs coach
Clayton White, who left to assume
the same position for the Hilltop
pers. Special teams coordinator and
defensive ends coach D.J. Durkin left
to coordinate special teams and
coach linebackers at Florida. Assis
tant head coach and co-defensive co
ordinator Ron Lynn has moved on
from his role with the team but has
remained at Stanford, where he will

take the role of Director of Player
Development.

Other members of the staff will
also take on new responsibilities.
Greg Roman, the offensive tackles
and tight ends coach, will be the as
sociate head coach and assistant
head coach of the offense, while still
maintaining his positional role. Of
fensive coordinator David Shaw
will also take on the running backs
coach job his dual position had

earlier been coordinator and wide
receivers and Lance Anderson
will switch from defensive tackles
to outside linebackers. He will re
tain his duties as recruiting coordi
nator.

The new staff and their players
will begin spring practices on
March 1.
