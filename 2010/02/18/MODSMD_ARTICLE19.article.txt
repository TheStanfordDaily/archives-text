An offseason of turnover is seemingly over, as the
Stanford football team finalized its coaching hires on
Wednesday. The Cardinal announced several long
expected moves that shake up the staff on both sides
of the ball.
The most recent additions, quarterbacks and wide
receivers coach Ron Turner and defensive backs
coach Derek Mason, both come to The Farm after
