## Etchemendy addresses tuition hike Provost, ASSU discuss health care, construction 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Provost John Etchemendy last
night defended the recently
announced increase in undergradu
ate tuition and room and board in
front of a joint session of the ASSU
legislature.
In a wide-ranging discussion,
undergraduate senators and
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
members quizzed Etchemendy on
campus health care, academic stan
dards and campus construction.
The increased cost of attendance
beginning next year, for both under
graduates and graduates, will come
with a maintained but not expanded
financial aid program. But
Etchemendy said that full tuition
covers only about 58 percent of the
cost of providing a Stanford educa
tion.
"A three-and-a-half-percent
increase is remarkably reasonable,
given the drop [in the value of the
endowment]," he said.
While Etchemendy did acknowl
edge that higher education cost
growth outpaces inflation, partly
because education is very labor
intensive, he insisted that it is the
drop in the endowment that is put
ting pressure on the price of a
Stanford education.
He said that the endowment sub
sidizes the remaining 42 percent of
the cost of a Stanford education.
"Anytime you have a subsidy that
drops 25 percent, as ours dropped,
we have to then make a choice
how much can we cut out of the
budget, how much can we decrease
the quality and how much is going to
end up having to be picked up by
the people who pay?" he said.
On the cost side of the equation,
Stanford's building boom and finan
cial aid increase have contributed to
the growth of the University's cost
structure.
According to Etchemendy, the
biggest recent driver of cost growth
is the expansion of undergraduate
aid. When the expansion was
announced in 2008, the University
projected that it would cost $2O mil
lion; the actual expense ended up at
$3O million.
Like other universities, however,
Stanford has also heavily invested in
premium buildings amenities like
a gym with rock walls.
"There has been an escalation in
overall costs that we've seen across
the country, and part of that is com
petition for nicer and nicer services,
