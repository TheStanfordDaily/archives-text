# Can't deny LeBron's greatness

### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
I spent part of my Valentine's
Day weekend fighting with my
girlfriend over what type of
dessert we should buy at Safe
way. The other half was spent
wondering why the hell Leßron
James took 22 shots in the NBA All-
Star Game.

This year, the annual streetball
spectacle took place in front of over
100,000 fans at the new Cowboys Sta
dium. I didn't watch the whole game
I got my fill in the first quarter and
didn't feel like sticking around to see
280 combined points but from
what I did observe, no one gave Le-
Bron the memo that this game wasn't
serious. In fact, he put the Mike
Brown Offense on the map.
My friends and I always joke about
the Mike Brown Offense (MBO).
Brown, the head coach of the Cleve
land Cavaliers and perhaps the lucki
est person on the planet, has won a
Coach of the Year award for leading
the Cavs to a 66-win season and a No.
1 overall seed in the 2009 playoffs. Yet
he appears to understand basketball
as much as I understand the plot of
Lost.

The MBO consists of the follow
ing: handing the ball to Leßron, let
ting him jab-step 20 seconds off the
shot clock and requesting that he
takes a contested 22-foot jump-shot
preceded by an unnecessary spin
move. James used this strategy time
and time again in the All-Star Game,
and shockingly, it failed, time and time
again.

Until this week, I would just mar
vel at how unbelievably wasteful and
inefficient this strategy is. When Le-
Bron goes to the rim,he's virtually un
stoppable. Yet he continues to rely on
the MBO on a game-to-game basis.
This system is what prevents his field
goal percentage from reaching an as
tronomical number for a wing player
it's what gives him the reputation
of an overly flashy player and it's what
has prevented him from winning an
NBA title.

Still, James is the most freakishly
gifted professional athlete of all time
and has taken one of the most incom
petent franchises and turned it into a
mirage of a dynasty. We have all been
dubbed "witnesses" of his dominance,
and he has become so famous that
Michael Jordan now feels obligated to
buy the Charlotte Bobcats in order to
remain a blip on the basketball radar.
It was during the All-Star Game
that, for the first time, I became con
flicted over my opinions of Leßron.
On one hand, I have a very difficult
time rewarding a player dedicated to
shooting contested jump shots as a
first priority with my support. A guy
built like a Hummer should live and
die in the lane. There are literally two
centers Dwight Howard and Shaq
that could possibly stop him at the
rim and one of them resides on his
own team. His antics on the court, his
dancing on the sideline and his vocal
disapproval whenever he is whistled
for fouls doesn't sit too well with me
either.
On the other hand, he's just really,
really freaking good. Despite the
MBO, Leßron is averaging 29.9
points on 50.6 percent shooting, 7.1
rebounds and 8.3 assists per game. He
is the best point guard, shooting guard
and small forward in the league. Until
Leßron, the likelihood of any player
repeating Oscar Robertson's historic
season of averaging a triple double
was deemed impossible. His ability to
find open teammates is remarkable,
and his tendency to garner players
like Anderson Varejao contract ex
tensions is unbelievable.
Right now, and I've been just as
guilty as anyone, it's extremely trendy
to make the case that Kobe Bryant is
a better player. The most common
statements/comments are: "Kobe
plays real basketball," "Leßron can't
shoot," "Where are Leßron's rings?"
and "When was the last time 'The
King' had 81 points?".
I can't answer the first two, be
cause I have no idea what is meant by
"real basketball" and I'd gladly give
up fast food, FIFA 'lO and my dignity
to make half of my shots in the NBA.
Leßron's rings? Pair him with Shaq
or Pau Gasol in their primes and
come talk to me after the subsequent
75-win seasons. 81 points? Kobe only
had two assists. Leßron is perfectly
capable of rampaging a defenseless

Raptors team if he chooses not to
pass the ball.
I feel guilty supporting the guy, but
I can no longer come up with enough
counterarguments. He is the best
player that I've ever seen and he's
probably the best player that I will
ever see. It's disturbing to think that

he is only 25 years old, and will con
tinue to get better. The very last thing
he needs is an ego boost, but this is
less of an admittance of a man-crush
and more of a surrender on my be
half.

So take your 22 All-Star shots, Le-
Bron. Just stop jab-stepping. Please.

Zach Zimmerman finds it much hard
er to give up FIFA 'lO than his dignity.
