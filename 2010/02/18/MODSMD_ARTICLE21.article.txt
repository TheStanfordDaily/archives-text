# MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Card's last dual meet is Big 
### CHRIS DERRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Head coach Skip Kenney often
preaches about "conserving emotion
al energy" throughout the season, and
the men's swimming and diving team
will look to release some of that ener
gy when archrival Cal comes to town
this weekend.
The No. 2 Cardinal will face the
No. 4 Golden Bears in the annual Big
Meet, the last dual meet of the season
before the Pac-10 Championships.
The meet will feature more than
just top-five talent, as the rivalry of
the two storied programs often brings
out an intensity not seen during the
rest of the dual-meet season.
"Both programs have had a lot of
success over the years, and every year
proves to be a close meet... it gets

heated and every victory is filled with
emotion," said senior Ail-American
Eugene Godsoe.
Although swimming is a sport that
tends to foster a lot of friendship and
mutual respect among competitors,
those connections will be forgotten
when the Big Meet title is at stake.
Sophomore Ail-American Chad
La Tourette explained, "I grew up
with a lot of these guys ... but when
we get on the pool deck, we stop being
friends."
La Tourette has been a key con
tributor in the distance swims for the
Cardinal this season. He and fellow
sophomores Trevor Scheid and
Michael Zoldos will look to take ad
vantage of a Cal distance corps that is
weaker than the rest of the Golden
Bear team. All three will likely swim
both the 500- and 1,000-yard

freestyle.
If the Cardinal looks to have an ad
vantage in the long distance events,
the Golden Bears will have the edge
in the short sprints. Nathan Adrian is
one of the best short sprinters in the
country, if not the world, and has the
top 50-yard freestyle time in the
NCAA to go with the second-best
time in the 100-yard free.
The Cardinal will attempt to
counter Adrian with All-Americans
senior David Dunford and junior
Alex Coville.
The rest of the meet's competi
tions will be hotly contested battles.
The meet could hinge on the results of
the relay events. Dual-meet scoring
awards 11 points for first place and a
mere four points for second. In indi
