# MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Card's last dual meet is Big 
### CHRIS DERRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Head coach Skip Kenney often
preaches about "conserving emotion
al energy" throughout the season, and
the men's swimming and diving team
will look to release some of that ener
gy when archrival Cal comes to town
this weekend.
The No. 2 Cardinal will face the
No. 4 Golden Bears in the annual Big
Meet, the last dual meet of the season
before the Pac-10 Championships.
The meet will feature more than
just top-five talent, as the rivalry of
the two storied programs often brings
out an intensity not seen during the
rest of the dual-meet season.
"Both programs have had a lot of
success over the years, and every year
proves to be a close meet... it gets

heated and every victory is filled with
emotion," said senior Ail-American
Eugene Godsoe.
Although swimming is a sport that
tends to foster a lot of friendship and
mutual respect among competitors,
those connections will be forgotten
when the Big Meet title is at stake.
Sophomore Ail-American Chad
La Tourette explained, "I grew up
with a lot of these guys ... but when
we get on the pool deck, we stop being
friends."
La Tourette has been a key con
tributor in the distance swims for the
Cardinal this season. He and fellow
sophomores Trevor Scheid and
Michael Zoldos will look to take ad
vantage of a Cal distance corps that is
weaker than the rest of the Golden
Bear team. All three will likely swim
both the 500- and 1,000-yard

freestyle.
If the Cardinal looks to have an ad
vantage in the long distance events,
the Golden Bears will have the edge
in the short sprints. Nathan Adrian is
one of the best short sprinters in the
country, if not the world, and has the
top 50-yard freestyle time in the
NCAA to go with the second-best
time in the 100-yard free.
The Cardinal will attempt to
counter Adrian with All-Americans
senior David Dunford and junior
Alex Coville.
The rest of the meet's competi
tions will be hotly contested battles.
The meet could hinge on the results of
the relay events. Dual-meet scoring
awards 11 points for first place and a
mere four points for second. In indi

vidual events, a team can offset the
nine points awarded for a victory by
scoring multiple athletes in the rest of
the top five.
With such a close contest expect
ed, the Cardinal will once again rely
on its experience. Captains Godsoe
and junior David Mosko will be
counted on for big performances.
Godsoe has been a standout in back
stroke events this year. He has the top

time in the country in the 100-yard
backstroke and is ranked in the top 15
in the 200-yard event, but will be chal
lenged by Guy Barnea and Mathias
Gydesen, two of the top backstrokers
in the country.
Mosko is top 15 in both the 500-
yard freestyle and the 200-yard but
terfly. He will most likely team up
with the trio of sophomores at 500,
and with sophomore Robert Bollier
and junior Josh Charnin-Aker in the
200.

The top Stanford breaststrokers
are sophomore Curtis Lovelace and
junior John Criste.The Cardinal will
also expect contributions from

freshmen Matthew Swanston and
Matthew Thompson. Both are
ranked nationally in the 200-yard
backstroke, and Thompson is also
ranked in the 400-yard individual
medley.
The Stanford diving squad will be
led by junior All-American Brent
Eichenseer. Senior All-American
Dwight Dumais is still sidelined by a
shoulder injury and his return for the
season is in doubt.

The action kicks off at Avery
Aquatic Center on Saturday at 1 p.m.
