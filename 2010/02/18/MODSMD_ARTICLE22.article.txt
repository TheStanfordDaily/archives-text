## Cardinal continues dominance of UCLA 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Saturday, the Stanford women's gymnastics
team made a strong case for a position in the Super Six
in late April. The No. 8 Cardinal had the confidence
and depth it needed to beat then-No. 5 UCLA,
195.975-195.625, in a dual meet at Pauley Pavilion.
Stanford (7-2) and UCLA (6-2) have dominated the
conference for the past 13 years, swapping Pac-10
championships every year since 2003. The tide seems
to be turning in the Cardinal's favor this year, as Satur
day's victory over the Bruins was the second one for
Stanford this season, even though UCLA held the
higher national ranking in each matchup.

In similar fashion to the Jan. 24 meet between the
Cardinal and the Bruins, Stanford slightly trailed after
the first two rotations on the uneven bars and the
vault, 98.525-98.050. The team was able to overtake
UCLA on the third rotation, however, due to two
Bruin falls on the balance beam that caused a dip in the
team's score and a slow in its momentum.

Meanwhile, Stanford was able to score a 49.275 on
the floor, which was by far the team's best event score
of the day. Here, senior captain Carly Janiga shared
first place with a 9.90 in what was Stanford's only indi
vidual victory of the day. But the overall floor exercise
score was also given a boost with a pair of 9.875 marks
from both freshman Ashley Morgan and sophomore
Nicole Pechanec.

The Card then maintained the lead by sticking five
of its six beam routines on the final rotation and get
ting a team-high score of 9.85 from junior Shelley
Alexander. This success on the beam was a particular
accomplishment for Stanford, as historically it has
struggled with consistency in the event.
Multiple team members debuted in various areas of
competition on Saturday, and their promising returns
served to fuel the team's enthusiasm as a whole.
Among these individual highlights was the 9.825 on
the vault by freshman Nicole Dayton, who placed sec
ond. Dayton had only competed once previously, but
