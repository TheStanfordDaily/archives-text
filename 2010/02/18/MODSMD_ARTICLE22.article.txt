## Cardinal continues dominance of UCLA 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Saturday, the Stanford women's gymnastics
team made a strong case for a position in the Super Six
in late April. The No. 8 Cardinal had the confidence
and depth it needed to beat then-No. 5 UCLA,
195.975-195.625, in a dual meet at Pauley Pavilion.
Stanford (7-2) and UCLA (6-2) have dominated the
conference for the past 13 years, swapping Pac-10
championships every year since 2003. The tide seems
to be turning in the Cardinal's favor this year, as Satur
day's victory over the Bruins was the second one for
Stanford this season, even though UCLA held the
higher national ranking in each matchup.

In similar fashion to the Jan. 24 meet between the
Cardinal and the Bruins, Stanford slightly trailed after
the first two rotations on the uneven bars and the
vault, 98.525-98.050. The team was able to overtake
UCLA on the third rotation, however, due to two
Bruin falls on the balance beam that caused a dip in the
team's score and a slow in its momentum.

Meanwhile, Stanford was able to score a 49.275 on
the floor, which was by far the team's best event score
of the day. Here, senior captain Carly Janiga shared
first place with a 9.90 in what was Stanford's only indi
vidual victory of the day. But the overall floor exercise
score was also given a boost with a pair of 9.875 marks
from both freshman Ashley Morgan and sophomore
Nicole Pechanec.

The Card then maintained the lead by sticking five
of its six beam routines on the final rotation and get
ting a team-high score of 9.85 from junior Shelley
Alexander. This success on the beam was a particular
accomplishment for Stanford, as historically it has
struggled with consistency in the event.
Multiple team members debuted in various areas of
competition on Saturday, and their promising returns
served to fuel the team's enthusiasm as a whole.
Among these individual highlights was the 9.825 on
the vault by freshman Nicole Dayton, who placed sec
ond. Dayton had only competed once previously, but
she came through in the clutch
against UCLA in what was her
strongest career performance. Se
nior captain Allyse Ishino also
competed on the floor for the first
time in her collegiate career, scor
ing a 9.80 with a self-choreo
graphed routine. Her performance
was highly anticipated by head
coach Kristen Smyth, who has been
looking to incorporate Ishino into
the floor rotation because of her
"show-stopping" routines.
The victory for the Card al
lowed the team to hold its steady
position at No. 8 in the national
rankings. More importantly, it fur
ther boosted the gymnasts' mo
mentum for the end-of-season
competitions, for which they con
tinually strive to prepare. First,
however, the team will travel to
No. 24 Arizona State for a dual
meet on Friday. Last year, the Car
dinal handily defeated ASU,
196.775-194.6, and it looks to re
peat the win in the away competi
tion this weekend.

Although the matchup should
n't pose as much of a challenge as
UCLA did, it will provide the team
with an excellent opportunity to
continue doing what Smyth deems
the number-one team goal: "build
ing confidence through consisten
cy."

"We still haven't had that meet
where we're hitting 24 routines, but
we're exactly where we need to be
as far as being able to get 196-plus
scores. We still have improvements
and adds to be made, so we're in a
really good position," Smyth said.
From this good position, the
team heads to face the Sun Devils
before returning for its final home
meet against rival California,
North Carolina and Eastern Michi
gan on Sunday, Feb. 28 in Maples
Pavilion. Though the most difficult
meets of the regular season may be
behind them, Pac-10 Champi
onships and NCAA Finals still lay
ahead, so the women of the Stan
ford gymnastics team are keeping
their eyes on the prize.
