# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford starting season strong 
### JUSTIN MARPOLE-BIRD 
After a convincing win at the
Stanford Invitational, the No. 1 Stan
ford women's water polo team looks
to continue its strong start at its next
tournament at the UC-Irvine Invita
tional Feb. 27-28. In between, the
Card will sandwich last week's home
match against Sonoma State (a 17-6
win) and an away match against San
Jose State on Saturday.
After not winning the Stanford
Invitational for six years, the victory
provided the team a good measure to
gauge its readiness. With preseason
rankings often shifting very early on
in the schedule, Stanford did well to
come out on top of a field that had
eight teams ranked in the top 10 of
Division I.
Although Stanford has been very
successful in its two tournaments so
far this season, the NorCal Invita
tional and Stanford Invitational,
most of its remaining matches are
duals against a single opponent.
"The 'tournament season' and
'dual-match season' are very differ
ent," said sophomore driver Pallavi
Menon. "Either way, every game

matters to us. We prepare for every
opponent. Our team is a huge target
with this number one ranking."
To maintain that ranking, the
team must keep composed through
both its tournament matches and sin
gle-day competitions. Despite its re
cent success, senior driver Kelly
Eaton was quick to point out that the
Card has yet to face some difficult
opponents among them, UCLA,
Arizona State and Hawaii, all of
whom participated in the Invitation
al but did not draw the home team.
This weekend, Stanford will take
on San Jose State, one of the Cardi
nal's opponents in the Stanford Invi
tational. The Cardinal defeated the
Spartans 15-6 earlier this month.
The players are looking forward
to this rematch with a top-10 team
and the tournament at Irvine
viewing the games as early opportu
nities to refine their skills before
championship season.
"Each competition is a chance for
us to improve," said senior defender
and Olympian Jessica Steffens.
