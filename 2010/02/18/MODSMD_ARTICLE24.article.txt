# BACKUPS BEAT CAL
## 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In yet another Bay Area faceoff
this season. No. 4 Stanford brought
down No. 18 Cal, just edging its neigh
borhood rivals 342.70-340.85, at the
Gold Country Classic in Livermore,
Calif. Stanford remains undefeated
this season after winning all four of its
competitive meets.
After an exhausting weekend at
the Winter Cup Challenge in Las
Vegas, co-captain Tim Gentry and fel
low juniors Alex Buscaglia, Josh
Dixon and Ryan Lieberman rested
up on the sidelines at the Classic and
allowed some of Stanford's under
classmen to shine.
"The meet was a great opportuni
ty for the guys trying to break into the
lineup and gain needed experience,"
said head coach Thom Glielmi.
And with Cal bringing all of its
high-scoring stars to the meet, Stan
ford knew it had to hit all of its rou
tines in order to take home the Classic
title.
While some routines were gently
slapped rather than hit, Stanford had
a strong showing overall evidence
that even without some of its key
players, the Card is still a formidable
opponent.
Both senior Eric Hergenrader and
sophomore Jordan Nolff hit their
pommel horse routines, with Hergen
rader stealing the event title. Fresh
man James Fosco, who has long been
known as a serious contender on the
still rings, won that event with a 15.0,
while Nolff debuted a new routine
that earned a solid 14.65.
Freshman Eddie Penev again dis
played his athletic prowess on floor
exercise, earning the top score of
15.45, while co-captain and redshirt
sophomore Abhinav Ramani proved
to be a serious contender with a 14.65.
Penev also vaulted to victory with a
score of 15.65 on that apparatus.
Late in the evening, Stanford
struggled on parallel bars and ended
up with a team total of just 56.45 on
that event, sinking below expecta
tions for the meet.
Poor landings, extra swings and
botched difficulty contributed to
major and minor point deductions,
according to Glielmi.
Redeeming themselves, the Stan
ford men hit all four of their high bar
routines, with Ramani getting the

men off to a great start and Penev giv
ing them a nice conclusion.
Cal, for its part, had a particularly
weak showing at the Classic, seem
ingly troubled on every single event.
Several of its gymnasts belly-flopped
off the high bar, normally an out
standing event for Cal. According to
Glielmi, had Cal's men hit their sets,
Cal could have stolen the Classic tro
phy.
Next up, Stanford travels north to
Oakland for the 2010 Pacific Coast
Classic (PCC). Joining Stanford will
be Cal, Arizona State University, the
University of lowa, the University of
Washington and the Japan Collegiate
All-Star Team.
Japan has traveled several thou
sand miles across the ocean to defend
its Pacific Coast Classic title and has

been sizing itself up against Stanford
all week in practice at Burnham
Pavilion on campus.
Returning for Japan are Riku Mu
nakata, Go Tagashira and Kazuaki
Koizumi. Tagashira and Munakata
placed first and second on vault at the
2009 PCC. Koizumi placed third on
high bar at last year's event.
For Stanford, this is an opportuni
ty to size itself up against national and
international competition before it
heads east next month for a series of
out-of-state meets that lead up to
April's NCAA Championship.
The Pacific Coast Classic will be
held at the Oakland Convention Cen
ter on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
