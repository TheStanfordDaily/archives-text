# TRAGEDY IN E.P.A.
## Plane crashes into East Palo Alto, knocks out power in Palo Alto, hospital

EAST PALO ALTO A twin-engine
Cessna 310 crashed soon after takeoff from
Palo Alto Airport early Wednesday, killing
three Tesla Motors employees on board, cut
ting off power to Palo Alto and parts of
Stanford for much of the day and giving the
residents of a small neighborhood a fiery
awakening.
The plane took off in thick fog just before
8 a.m., bound for Hawthorne Municipal
Airport south of Los Angeles, according to
Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold
Schapelhouman. But instead of turning right
after takeoff, as is customary to comply with
the airport's noise abatement procedure, the
plane flew straight toward a residential area
of East Palo Alto, clipping three power lines
attached to a 100-foot transmission tower at
the eastern end of Beech Street.
Reconstructing the crash for reporters,
Schapelhouman said one of the plane's wings
and a landing gear unit broke off after impact
with the power lines and struck a Beech
Street home and day care center. No children
were in the day care at the time of the crash,
and seven people, including a baby, safely
escaped the burning house.
The remaining fuselage of the aircraft con
tinued flying for half a block before hitting
the street, spraying burning fuel onto another
house, skidding into a BMW, lighting two
other vehicles on fire and coming to a rest
between 1180 and 1188 Beech St.
National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) officials arrived in East Palo Alto
late Wednesday to begin their investigation of
the official cause of the crash.
Destroyed homes and cars aside, the resi
dents of Beech Street may consider them
selves lucky: no one on the ground was seri
ously injured. Schapelhouman told reporters
it was "either very fortunate or intentional"
that the Cessna's pilot brought the plane
down on the street and not on houses.

Tesla Loses Three
Tesla Motors, the San Carlos-based com
pany that just last month signaled its intent to
go public, lost three of its own in Wednesday's
crash. In a statement Wednesday, CEO Elon
Musk said the company withheld the identi
ties of the plane's passengers while their fam
ilies were notified.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with
them," Musk said. "Tesla is a small, tightly
knit company, and this is a tragic day for us."
According to media reports, the Cessna
was registered to a company owned by Doug
Bourn, a senior electrical engineer at Tesla.
Bourn received a B.S. in electrical engineer
ing from Stanford in 1973. Neither Tesla nor

authorities at the scene would confirm
whether Bourn was at the controls or even on
board.

According to a biography on the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers
Web site, Bourn played a key role in design
ing and testing the power electronic module
for the Roadster, Tesla's flagship vehicle.

Damaged Tower Zaps Power

Less than half a minute after takeoff, the
aircraft met its first obstacle: power lines
attached to a 100-foot Pacific Gas and
Electric (PG&E) transmission tower at the
eastern end of Beech Street. The lines serve
municipal utilities in Palo Alto, said Joe
Molica, a PG&E spokesperson.
Palo Alto immediately lost power, stalling
traffic signals and backing up traffic along
major roads. The outage also stripped power
from Stanford Hospital & Clinics, which
issued an alert at 9:30 a.m. that its buildings
and the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
were operating on emergency power. The
centers put non-emergency cases on hold,
canceled clinic appointments and continued

operating cases and care for women in deliv
ery and labor. The hospital's emergency room
was open "only for the most urgent situa
tions."

Caltrain officials advised drivers in Palo
Alto to take extra caution when driving
across train tracks on Wednesday, as the out
age raised concerns at crossing gates at two

intersections.

"The traffic signals are connected to train
signals," said Christine Dunn, a Caltrain
spokesperson. "[The gates] are coordinated
so that when traffic signals turn red, they cor
respond to that."
Dunn said Caltrain officials immediately
set up generators at Charleston Road and
Churchill Avenue to ensure that gates were
working properly. Caltrain also dispatched
personnel to monitor both intersections for
safety. Trains were "required to slow down" to
15 miles per hour when entering each of the
two intersections, Dunn said.
Because of the outage, trains experienced
delays of up to 10 minutes throughout the
day.
The outage also affected Palo Alto
schools, where students enjoyed a laid-back
Wednesday playing board games and soaking
up the sunlight instead of sitting in dark class
rooms.
"We had moved our class from our normal
classroom into the library, where the windows
were bigger and it would be easier to see,"
said Spencer Schoeben, a sophomore at Palo
Alto High School. "Not much work got done,
though."
Power was restored to Palo Alto before 6
p.m. Wednesday. Stanford's central campus
was not affected by the outage.
A 'Miracle' on Beech Street
Art Jonas, 43, opened the front door of his
Beech Street home Wednesday morning to
take his son to elementary school. The air was
chilly and smelled of Bay saltwater, and a
soupy fog shrouded the quiet neighborhood.
Then: a flash, followed by a boom.
Just up the block from Jonas' home, a
twin-engine Cessna plowed into three power
lines, and a section of the aircraft separated
from the fuselage.

I heard a whirl," Jonas said. "That was
