## 
### 
1 TRANSMISSION TOWER: Less then half a
minute after takeoff, the Cessna clipped three power
lines attached to a 100-foot-tall PG&E transmission
tower. The impact dismembered the plane and result-

Ed in a citywide power outage for much of
Wednesday.

2 HOME AND DAY CARE: One of the Cessna's
wings and landing gear units impacted this house,
setting it ablaze. A nearby children's day care was
untouched. No children were inside.

3 CARPORT: The wing and landing gear sheered
off the top of this carport and came to rest atop a
Chrysler Sebring.

4 FUSELAGE IMPACT: The plane's fuselage
continued flying for half a block before striking the
street here. The impact sprayed burning fuel on the
facade of a nearby house.

5 RESTING PLACE: The fiery aircraft came to a
stop between two houses after skidding along the
street and lighting three cars ablaze. The bodies of
the three passengers remained inside the wreckage
until Wednesday afternoon.
