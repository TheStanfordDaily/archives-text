## Bing Concert Hall approved Music faculty, students look forward to new venue 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI STAFF WRITER 
Performers won't strike their first
notes in the newly planned Bing
Concert Hall for at least two years,
but the music community here is
already abuzz with anticipation.
University trustees last week
announced that construction plans
have been approved for the new $llO
million Bing Concert Hall, scheduled
to be completed in the summer of
2012, with its first performances

expected to occur in winter of 2013.
The facility will be located behind
the Arrillaga Alumni Center on
Lasuen Street at the intersection of
Museum Way and Palm Drive.
The project marks an important
stage in Stanford's almost 120-year
history, as the campus has never had
its own true concert hall.
The project cost has been under
written by a donation made by Peter
and Helen Bing, institutional fund
ing, senior donors and friends of the
University.
"What the Bings have done for us
here is unbelievable," said Karen
Nagy, vice president of the arts. "I
think it's going to enable a genera
tion of music-making and art-making
on this campus that will make every
one proud."
TTie current plan envisions a
112,635-square-foot structure
designed by Polshek Partnership
Architects, a New York company.
The structure is planned to feature a
sandstone-colored stucco exterior, a
glass-paned lobby and an 844-seat
performance space.
Yasu Toyota, designer of the
acoustics of Disney Hall in Los
Angeles, was contracted to develop
the acoustical design, conducive to
not only unamplified solo and
orchestral performances, but also to
computer and electronic music,
including Stanford's laptop orchestra
and other electronic music ensem
bles.

The hall will be used by campus
organizations including the Stanford
music department and its orchestral
and choral ensembles, Lively Arts
and the Center for Computer
Research in Music and Acoustics
(CCRMA), but also the surrounding
Palo Alto community.
The campus arts community is
uniformly enthralled about the
project.

"I'm joyful and emotional," said
music professor Jindong Cai.
"Nothing can be better as a musician
than to play in a state-of-the-art con
cert hall."

Nagy affirmed that the arts com
munity has been anxiously awaiting a
new venue for some time.
"There has been a desire and a
conversation to build a new concert
hall for over a decade," Nagy
explained. "The major impetus in this
direction was a capital campaign that
made the arts a key area to strength
en in this community. Strengthening
the facilities is a pretty obvious tar
get."

The music community agreed that
Stanford has been in desperate need
of a true concert facility. Current per
formance spaces such as Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, Memorial Auditorium
and Memorial Church were all con
structed as multi-purpose structures,
and lack satisfactory acoustics, they
say. Nagy conceded that CCRMA

has a gem of an acoustical space at
The Knoll, but its capacity is limited
to about 90 people.
Performers often find that they
cannot adequately hear themselves
in current auditoriums, and sound
does not reverberate well through
out the audience.
"What we have now is
[Dinkelspiel Auditorium], which is
basically an acoustical dead-zone,"
said Nick Hersh 'lO, a music and con
ducting student.
"[Dinkelspiel] is not really built
for an orchestra to sound really good
in it," he said.

Not only is Bing Concert Hall
expected to surpass Dinkelspiel
Auditorium both technologically and
acoustically, but it will also employ an
entirely different internal design.
Instead of retaining the traditional
shoebox style performance space, the
hall will be built in vineyard style,
with seats encircling a slightly ovular

stage, and will also include sails
swelling from the walls of the hall,
which are pivotal to Toyota's acoustic
vision.
The hall will also have large pro
jection screens that can be coordinat
ed with film, light, and sound.
"It's a very intimate space," said
Jenny Bilfield, the executive director
of Lively Arts. "We want school chil
dren, students and community mem
bers to be able to hear the musicians
breathing. We want to reanimate the
experience of a live performance."
In addition to providing a great
physical performance space, Bilfield
also hopes the hall will help attract
guest artists.

"There are certain ensembles that
we would just love to have, but we've
just never historically had a place to
present them in an appropriate and
responsible way," said director of
choral studies Stephen Sano. "And
now we will."

The only complaint among music
advocates for now, it seems, is the
wait Bing Concert Hall will require:
it won't be operable for another
three years, even though mass exca
vation is targeted to begin as early as
this May.
"I'm really excited for it," Hersh
said. "But I'm disappointed that it
will be finished two years after I
graduate."
But the music department has
high hopes that the Bing Concert
Hall's place in the future of music
making will be worth the wait.
"If you look at concert halls
around the world, there are halls that
were built hundreds of years ago that
are still the best halls in the world,"
Sano said. "And it would be fabulous
to see this hall be one of those kinds
of spaces."

The proposed plans for the new Bing Concert Hall include an 844-seat capacity, advanced acoustics and an oval stage
surrounded by the audience. Construction will begin in Summer 2010, and the hall is projected to be completed in 2012.
