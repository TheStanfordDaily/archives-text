Six hopefuls are performing stunts across campus as they
compete for the coveted title of the Leland Stanford Junior

The 10-day competition, which began on Monday and
ends with the announcement of the new Tree next
Thursday morning, is the period during which Band man
agement and former Trees judge the current contestants
