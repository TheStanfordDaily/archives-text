## Student stunts kick off Tree Week 
### LAURA STAMPLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
IHUM professors, lock your classroom doors, and stu
dents, start flocking to White Plaza it's Tree Week.
Six hopefuls are performing stunts across campus as they
compete for the coveted title of the Leland Stanford Junior
University Band's beloved mascot: the Stanford Tree.

The 10-day competition, which began on Monday and
ends with the announcement of the new Tree next
Thursday morning, is the period during which Band man
agement and former Trees judge the current contestants

often called Saplings.
"Before Tree Week, everyone is
nothing, and just in Tree Week you
have to show us you deserve an
interview and by the most creative
means possible," said current Tree
Jonathan "Shu-Fry" Strange 'll.
The current competitors include
band and non-band affiliates alike.
The band contingent includes Ben
"Bollox" Cortes 'll and Kirk "Big
Dickosaurus" Erickson 'lO, both in
the drum section, and Robbie
"Donkey Fluffer" Zimbroff 'l2,
who joined the trumpet section in
the fall. He is still learning the
instrument.

Non-band Saplings include Chris
Hadley 'lO, who ran for Tree in
2007, and Rachel Lindee 'l2, the
only female candidate. The final
candidate, Victor Em 'l3, has yet to
perform a stunt, but appeared at the
Band Shak dressed in boxers, a
wifebeater and a cape-like costume
covering his face.
"Someone actually told me I was
too creepy for the Band for some
reason," said Em.
There are currently four main
ground rules: no fire, no electrocu
tion, no serious bodily harm that
would result in a trip to the hospital
(even if the candidate chooses not
to go) and nothing illegal. "I always
forget about that one," Strange said.
If Saplings violate these rules, they
face disqualification.
Even though the week is young,
there have already been numerous
colorful public stunts.
Zimbroff, who has been publicly
endorsed by quarterback Andrew
Luck 'l2, kicked off his America
themed campaign by driving up to
the Shak in a covered wagon
which is currently camped out in
White Plaza and performing a
choreographed dance with numer
ous supporters.
On Tuesday, Zimbroff and sup
porters stormed an IHUM class
room with a rehearsed skit in which
Zimbroff, in colonial gear, was tried
for treason and faux-tarred-and
feathered before performing a short
rap.
Thus far, Hadley has been cov
ered in red, white and green paint

a homage to Stanford and Tree
pride and he shopping-cart joust
ed with a contingent of Sigma Nus
in White Plaza on Tuesday at noon.
Carts were decorated with slogans
including, "Wake up in the morning
feeling like Tree Diddy."
Lindee, whose campaign slogan
is "Lindee for Tree, Lindtree for
life," has performed two stunts as
well. On Monday, she performed
the rap "Lean Like a Tree," a spoof
on the Kilo song, supported by
backup dancers, and she made her
self into a "human birdfeeder" in
White Plaza on Tuesday, covering
herself with syrups and cereals.
Cortes has been serenading the
band and bystanders thus far. He
played ACDC's "Thunderstruck"
on the roof of the Shak, and recited
"The Devil Went Down to Georgia"
after inhaling a variety of gases
from balloons that altered his voice
between high and low ranges.
Erickson announced his candida
cy from the top of a tree more than
40 feet tall.
"I wanted to swim through bar
racudas in the Claw, but it turns out
that you need an exotic animals'
license for barracudas, and the Claw
doesn't have any water, so it just
became a little too much trouble to
go for," Erickson said.
But much of the excitement
remains to be seen. Lindee is plan
ning a public event in White Plaza
on Thursday after the basketball
game at 10 p.m. Cortes is planning
a "Twilight" tribute and encourages
readers to "keep their ears to
ground" to join in a "roaming goril
la zombie party." Other candidates
have stunts planned throughout
the week, but are holding off on
details in efforts to surprise stu
dents.
Although many stunts are public,
many others happen in a more
secretive manner, with a Band-only
audience. At the end of the day, only
Band management and the former
Tree decide the winner.
"You really gotta prioritize who
you really are trying to impress,"
Strange said, "and if you aren't
impressing me then you aren't going
to be Tree."
According to Band officials, any
remaining Tree hopefuls have until
Friday to announce their candidacy.
