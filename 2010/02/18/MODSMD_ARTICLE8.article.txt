## Rooted IN History

o back
to the first time you ever
came to Stanford.
Maybe you were visiting with
parents or maybe you came for the first
time before orientation week in
September.
Regardless of how or why we came,
most of us remember the same thing: our

first trip up Palm Drive.
There is a professor jogging on the
pedestrian path, pushing her baby in a
stroller. Cyclists blur past in bright jerseys,
while students chatting excitedly in a
pack head to the Caltrain for a day in
San Francisco.
Then, there are the palms —166 tower
ing jungle masses lining a stunningly bold
alley. You sense how they enclose you, as if
to say, "You have arrived, and there is no
turning back." They nudge you gently
along a mile-long path until you are

released, and the shining panorama of the
Quad and Memorial Church greet you
from across the oval.
Palm trees have been a significant fea
ture of campus since the University first
opened in 1891. From the very start, the
palms have played a nuanced role in cam
pus allure and culture not just the 166
palms lining the iconic Palm Drive, but
also the 434 other specimens dispersed
across campus.
Fourteen genera of palms grace the
campus, the most common being the
Canary Island Date Palms and the
Mexican Fan Palms, both of which line
Palm Drive.

The Canary Palms, a short and stout
variety, comprise about 66 percent of the
palms campus. Mexican Fans, a taller
plant, make up about 13 percent.
According to Julie Cain, landscape his

torian, many of the palms were
imported from outside of the United
States and started out on campus as
seedlings.
Campus legend has it that the
first University President, David
Starr Jordan, suggested to Leland
Stanford that palms be planted along

Palm Drive.
"The palms were definitely a Victorian
favorite," Cain explained.
"JJiere was a huge interest in exotics
plants that you bring in from an outside
area. And the campus is covered in them,"
she added.
She went on to explain that Frederick
Law Olmsted did not come up with the
idea for the palms, as is commonly
believed.
More than 130 years later, palms are
the tree —or scientifically speaking, the
grass that visitors remember. Some of
the palms on campus today were planted
here before the University was even
designed, and campus architects and land
scapes still choose them today to accentu
ate new structures.
Clearly the palms have some kind of
intriguing power.
"I think you would be hard-pressed to
find any more dramatic entrance to a uni
versity than Palm Drive," said Director of
Admission Shawn Abbott. "It evokes a
sense of grandeur that I don't think you
find at any other university in the U.S."
Abbott explained that the palms
attract prospective students who are
unaccustomed to Stanford's
Mediterranean climate. While the palms
are perceived as being quintessentially
Californian, however, they are not indige
nous to the Bay Area.
"The palm trees symbolize warmth and
provide a welcoming element," Abbott
said. "I think that resonates more with stu
dents who are not from California."
The palms are so prominent that even
design consultants working on publica
tions for the Office of Admission have
been concerned about the impressions
that the trees make on potential students
on behalf of the University.
"When we were in the process of
developing our publications, one of the
design consultants wondered whether the

use
of palm
trees would
suggest that the
University was too laid
back or not serious enough,"
Abbott said. "I don't think they sym
bolize a lack of intellectual rigor at all
I mean, they're a tree."
Some do see the palms, however, as a
reflection of campus culture.
"When I think of Stanford, I think of
palm trees, and hammocks and skate
boarding to class," said Elise Geithner 'l3.
"The palms show that people are laid back
and enjoy the outdoors."
President John Hennessy said that the
palms emanate campus positivity.
"They seem to reflect a sunny and
bright disposition, which I think is part of
our culture," he said. "People tend to be
happy at Stanford."
Geithner believes campus palms
induce the release of healthy endorphins,
likening the campus to a "tropical island."
That said, however, the palms don't
exist entirely without contention. Campus
legend has it that one palm tree costs as
much as one year of Stanford tuition.
"I've heard $50,000 [per tree]," said C.J.
Jameson 'lO. "Your tuition is going to a
palm tree that can be seen as contro
versial."
Hennessy refuted this myth.
"Most of the palm trees that we have
obtained over the years have been donat
ed," Hennessy said. "And in some cases,
even the upkeep has been donated."
"We've never spent very much
University resources on the palm trees,"
he added. "People like them enough that
they're willing to give us money for palm
trees."
