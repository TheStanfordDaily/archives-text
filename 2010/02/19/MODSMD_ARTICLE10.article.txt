## Stanford pair warns of Quadrophobia Law professor, GSB student author new business study 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Lending insight on potential management manipula
tion of earnings reports, a new study by Stanford
researchers suggests that some companies may slightly
tweak their reported earnings per share (EPS) and
that companies that engage in such adjustments are more
likely to be charged with accounting violations.
Stanford Law School professor Joseph Grundfest and
Nadya Malenko, a doctorate candidate at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business (GSB), co-authored the

study, "Quadrophobia: Strategic Rounding of EPS,"
based on research and analysis they have conducted since
the summer of 2007.

The two analyzed annual and quarterly filings for
22,460 companies from 1980 to 2006 and found statistical
ly significant infrequent appearances of the number four
in the tenth-of-a-cent decimal place of reported EPS fig
ures.

"Changing the EPS number by .1 cent from .4 to .5 will
change the reported EPS figure by one cent," Malenko
explained.

Through statistical analysis, Grundfest and Malenko
found that there were very few fours in the hundredth
place of unrounded EPS data a phenomenon they
dubbed "quadrophobia" and a strong indication that firm
managers tend to round up figures.
"In the past, people had tested for
rounding behavior, not specifically
for quadrophobiaGrundfest said.
"What we did was analytically a little
different: we looked at the number
four, rather than a clusters of num
bers, and we found patterns that had
not yet been appreciated in the liter
ature."

In addition to pinpointing the
prevalence of "quadrophobia," the
study also looked at characteristics of
companies that exhibited
quadrophobic behavior in order to
determine potential causes of the
phenomenon.

"One of our results is that analyst
coverage is a good determinant of
quadrophobia," Malenko said. "The
behavior is more pronounced among
companies that are covered by ana
lysts, and when a company gains ana
lyst coverage, the behavior is more
pronounced than before."
"It's likely that one of the incen
tives is to beat analyst forecasts," she
added.

Furthermore, Grundfest and
Malenko found a strong correlation
between companies that exhibited
quadrophobia to incidence of restate
ments, class action securities fraud lit
igation and Security and Exchange
Commission enforcement actions
alleging accounting violations.
These findings contribute to exist
ing studies on potential management
manipulation of reported earnings
data, though the most immediate

application of the study may be for
regulators and audit firms.

Both co-authors cautioned
against using "quadrophobia" as a
determinant or predictor of individ
ual companies' characteristics, as a
company may have historically
exhibited the tendency simply out of
chance rather than managers' active
manipulation of EPS reporting.
"Quadrophobia should be one of
many factors to consider," Grundfest
said. "Statistically, it is very hard to
use quadrophobia as a measure of
the likelihood that one individual
company will get into trouble."
"Instead, the study and its conclu
sions would be better used as a
descriptor of a pool of companies,"
he said.
