# Condoleezza Rice speaks at GSB

### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Amy Julia Harris 
In a rare public appearance,
Condoleezza Rice spoke about effec
tive leadership and her role in steer
ing America's foreign policy under
the Bush administration in front of
an overflowing audience at the
Graduate School of Business' Bishop
Auditorium Thursday.
The 66th Secretary of State and
former Stanford provost was the
third speaker in the GSB's 2010 stu
dent-run speaker series called "View
from the Top."
Rice's 25-minute talk, followed by
a 40-minute question and answer
period, charted her leadership mind
set during her tenure as George W.
Bush's first-term national security
advisor and, from 2005 to 2009, as
U.S. Secretary of State.
In a departure from the political
fireworks that sometimes character
ize Rice's public appearances, the
recap of her experiences in
Washington was warmly met by the
audience yesterday.
"First and foremost, in challenging
times the thing to do is to stay focused
on what's important, not what's
urgent," Rice said, underscoring a
major theme of her talk: that today's
headlines and history's judgment are
rarely the same. That principle
being perpetually cognizant of a long
term foreign policy picture was
Rice's personal mantra during her
time in Washington.
"If you were in a position of
authority, every day after September
11 was September 12," Rice said,
explaining the post-9/11 crisis mode
of Washington politics. But keeping a
level head during that high-intensity
time was essential to effective govern
ing, she said. "Everything is always a
crisis."

But she said her time in the Bush
administration wasn't without inci
dent— the period saw an escalation

of sectarian violence in Iraq, the elec
tion of Hamas in Pakistan and the
threat of a nuclear Iran she said
that on most days, "it was just paper
clips, not nuclear war."
After her speech, Rice fielded
questions from GSB students about
what the United States' commitment
should be in Iraq to her decision to
forego a classical piano career and
ended her talk before a standing ova
tion from the crowd.
