## A 						PACIFIC ALLIANCE. SJEC promotes cross-cultural learning and friendship 
### AMY ILANCTOT 
It took an 11-hour plane ride, extensive
English lessons and a series of rigorous
interviews for 15 Japanese exchange stu
dents to finally set foot on The Farm. But
on Feb. 5, the smiling batch of exchange
students were greeted by their Stanford hosts
for a month-long campus stay.
45 Stanford students in the Stanford
Japanese Exchange Club (SJEC), a 59 year-old
program designed to encourage cross-cultural
friendship, welcomed their Japanese guests
from Doshisha University, Kyoto University
and the Keio University in Tokyo. Josh Koplin
TO, the leader of the six decades old, student
run program, says the goal of the exchange is to
"promote cultural understanding between the
U.S. and Japan."

Each of the 15 Japanese students stays with
three separate hosts for a 10-day interval.
Living in the dorms, attending classes and
hanging out with their hosts, the Japanese stu
dents get a real taste of Stanford life.
"We start planning for the students' arrival
in the fall," said sophomore Hwee Lee, one of
the 12 core officers handling the logistics of the
program. "The schedule is pretty fixed because
the program's been going on for so long."
The program's history and prestige, both at
Stanford and Japan, was a major draw for many
participants.

"I've wanted to study in the U.S. for a long
time," said Rena Isomura, a freshman from
Keio University. "I planned on taking a year
abroad here, but when I saw the poster on a
campus billboard, I knew I had to apply to this
program."

She recalled the rigorous application
process for the SJEC program.

"There were many essays and interviews,"
she explained. "It started with 20 initial appli
cants and at the end, there were only six or
seven of us."
Cheryl Miyake 'l3, Isomura's first host,
became interested in SJEC because "at
Stanford it seems like there are many interna
tional students from China, but no Japanese
students." As a Japanese-American student
herself, she jumped at the chance to interact
with contemporaries from Japan and share
Stanford culture with them. Miyake and Xian
Shan 'l3, other host students, also have big
plans for their guests.
"We should totally go fountain hopping!"
Miyake said excitedly, deaf to Shan's protests
about the less-than-ideal weather.
But fountain hopping wasn't the only new
thing that Japanese exchange students were
exposed to for many, there was a degree of
culture shock in everyday and classroom inter
actions on campus.
"In Japanese classes the students are too shy
to put their hand up," Isomura said. "There are
300 people in the lecture hall and one professor
talking; he doesn't even notice we are existing."
Isomura attended a Stanford humanities
lecture the day she arrived, and the differences
in class dynamics were immense.
"There were 20 people, and everyone put
their hand up, argued, asked questions to each
other," she recalled. "The students were doing
the work, not the professor. The professor
called the students by name, too."
Charlie Dunn *ll, who went on the Bing
Overseas program in Kyoto, said he under
stands the cultural gap between Japanese and
American norms.
"In Japan, everyone's looking to serve you
in a restaurant or even just ordinary peo
ple," Dunn said. "In America, the feeling is kind

of, 'Just leave me alone.' We tend to value our
freedom more, have a more individualist atti
tude, doing what you want to do, not what's i
best for everyone." /
He also found the workplace hierarchy A
in Japan gratingly different from the U.S.,
telling the story of how he asked his I j
mentor from his summer internship for m
a letter of recommendation. /|
"He explained to me how that was Vt*#
going to be difficult," he said. "It turns
out that what makes a good letter of rec- i
ommendation in Japan is how important
the person is who wrote it; he thought he
was going to have to go to the vice presi
dent. It's very hierarchical you don't
leave the office until the person above you J
has left."
Socially, many of the exchange students
found Stanford a drastic departure from
the social scene in Japan. Ruryko M
Mitsuishi, a freshman from Doshisa fWI
University, went to Theta Delta's fifth
Avatar-themed party with her miff

Stan lord host-arid iound the"experi
ence extremely different than home
life,
"There are no parties like that in
Japan," she said. "We usually do k
karaoke on the weekend." fa
But despite the cultural differ- Â£f
ences, the Japanese students r-"
were committed to making the
most of their SJEC stay.
"In Japan, we just learn
English," said Isomura. "I
want to learn something
through English."
