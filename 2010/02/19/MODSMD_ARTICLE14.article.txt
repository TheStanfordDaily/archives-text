# ELOQUENCE OR ELITISM?

CC onsequently, the afore-
I mentioned juxtaposition
presents an irrefutable
manifestation of the inherent
dichotomy of insert-another-really
long-word-here in a post-9/11
world."
Admit it. At some point during
one's academic career, probably at
an ungodly hour closer to sunrise
than sunset, almost every Stanford
student has conjured up a sentence
â€”or two pages like the one
above. Many have been caught in
the act of integrating complex
vocabulary into everyday speech.
But why is this just another part
of the intellectual atmosphere of
life on the Farm?
"Most students write as if they
are trying to be pedantic, as if they
wanted to sound like stuffy academ
ics or old fogies I am astonished
at the lengths they go to!" exclaimed
psychology professor Herbert

Clark. While he has preached that
students should "never write a word
or phrase you wouldn't use in con
versation," some tend to blur these
lines, to the chagrin of friends and
peers.

Daniel Oppenheimer, a former
Stanford student and professor who
currently teaches at Princeton, con
ducted a study while on the Farm to
investigate what he called
"Consequences of Erudite
Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of
Necessity: Problems with Using
Long Words Needlessly." His
research produced very interesting
results.

"A majority of undergraduates
admit to deliberately increasing the
complexity of their vocabulary so as
to give the impression of intelli
gence," the study revealed.
However, Oppenheimer found that
such "needless complexity" leads to
negative evaluations.
Stanford students and professors
alike expressed frustration when
they encountered unnecessarily

complicated vocabulary in written
text, and considered overly verbose
writers less intelligent because of
their diction.

"It seems possible that other
dimensions such as liking, sociability
or trustworthiness could be impact
ed as well," Oppenheimer conclud
ed. "Students everywhere I have
ever taught underestimate the
importance of being clear and con
cise."

And when it comes to speech,
these negative effects seem to be
magnified.
"I say that people who use the
phrase 'incredibly problematic'
ought to insert their name as the
subject of the sentence!" joked
Justin Lee 'l3.

"At Stanford, you don't get cool
points for trying to look smart,"
added Chanh Nguyen 'll.
Lee and Nguyen are part of a
large group of students who tend to
frown upon what they view as pre
tentiousness, and will actively point
out that "you're just not supposed to

say that in real life."

Most of the accused are aware
that "using big words" could poten
tially be problematic, but find it dif
ficult to separate academic writing
from everyday speech when they
devote so much conscious effort to
the former.

"What I say sounds like it should
be written down," explained Jamie
Ray 'f3. "But it is just weird when
spoken."

A few brave souls, however,
embrace lexiphanicism the use of
excessively learned and bombastic
terminology both in and out of
class.

"I find no problem with my use
of a diverse lexicon," said Taylor
Brady 'l3. "But, only if you don't
pause on a word to emphasize it,
because that indicates that you care
whether or not people find your
vocabulary impressive, and that's
pretentious bu11..."
Brady attributes his speech and
writing habits to nature rather than
conscious intention.

"My style of conversation
comes from years of gifted educa
tion, personal exploration of clas
sic literature and a vigorous
curiosity about language begin
ning when I read the dictionary as
a kid," he said.
Brady also pointed out an oft
overlooked benefit of having a wide
vocabulary.
"When I learned Spanish, I found
it facile to understand many words
because I could recognize their
English conjugates, even if the word
was not a common part of modern
American vernacular," he explained
misusing the word "conjugates"
when he meant "cognates."
Other students have a more light
hearted take on the subject.

"One of my favorite words is
'lexiphanicist' someone who
uses big words to show off," said
Maia Peirce 'l3. "It's awesome
because you kind of can't use it
without being one."
"I like people who say big words
because they make me laugh,"
added Ruby Lee 'l3.
Rachel Liaw 'll probably had the
most interesting take on appropriate
vernacular.

"I personally think that every
one should revert back to Jane
Austen-era speech," she said.
"That's how I'm going to reject all
my suitors!"
