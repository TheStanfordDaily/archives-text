## EDITORIAL Climate change skeptics falsely tout snow storm 
### 
Several politicians enjoyed a field day this
past week, touting the epic snowstorms
in the northeast as evidence against
global warming. With the onslaught of bliz
zards and knee-deep snow, the weather set
the perfect stage for an assault on the credi
bility of climate change.
The Virginia Republican party took out a
mocking television ad evoking images of
the storm and inviting voters to call con
gressmen who voted for the climate bill to
"tell them how much global warming you
get this weekend. Maybe they'll come help
you shovel."
Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC) even twit
tered that it is "going to keep snowing in
D.C. until A1 Gore cries 'uncle.'"

Senator James Inhofe (R-OK), one of the
most ardent skeptics to climate change,
took the gleeful scorn even farther, having
his staffers build an igloo on Capitol Hill
with a sign reading "A1 Gore's New Home."
These publicity stunts have likely suc
ceeded in driving public perception on the
issue into further chaos. The salience of
pointing out winter weather while it afflicts
millions of Americans cannot be understat
ed. As these congressmen point out, how
can we worry about global warming when
there is so much snow?

The problem, however, is that their rea
soning is completely wrong.
These appeals to reject global warming
science on the basis of this snowstorm come
out of unscientific and unfounded logic.
Not only does this snowstorm not actually
disprove the science, but it actually con
firms the predictions of climate models.
Contrary to what the uninformed might
think, "global warming," or rather climate
change, can lead to extreme conditions on
both ends of the spectrum. In short, the hot
places get hotter, the dry places get drier
and snowy areas see more snow than ever.
The weather event in question actually
lies perfectly within the expected trends of
climate science. In fact, the U.S. Global

Change Research Program predicted in
2009 that in the northeast, "strong cold sea
son storms are likely to become stronger
and more frequent."
The science, as meteorologist Jeff Mas
ters explains it, is simple. Warmer air from
rising temperatures holds more moisture.
Water vapor levels in the atmosphere have
risen four percent since 1980, and when
temperatures drop below freezing, that
moisture will unleash itself in intensified
snowstorms. Surely enough, these predict
ed blizzards have increased in severity.
Three of the 10 heaviest snowstorms in Bal
timore since 1870 have occurred in the last
seven weeks.

These weather events, in their harsh con
firmation of climate change predictions,
should actually be sounding alarms about
the urgent need for the Senate to pass a
comprehensive climate bill. But instead, the
outright duplicity of elected officials look
ing to score quick political points has led
them to flaunt the exact opposite interpre
tation in the faces of the American people.
Their claims, making no attempt to rest
on science, are extremely clever in their
cynicism. Sarcastic jabs that do not even at
tempt to start a serious dialogue offer no
real opportunity for rebuttal.
Unfortunately, politicians like Inhofe
and DeMint count on the American people
to pay attention just long enough to laugh
at their witticisms and internalize the intu
itive contradiction between intense snow
storms and global warming. Without the sci
ence on their side, opponents to climate leg
islation have made it clear that they will use
any justification necessary to prevent leg
islative action on the issue. Poking fun at
global warming science in the midst of a
snowstorm might seem like fun and games,
but with the Senate's climate bill hanging in
the balance, the stakes of public opinion are
real and they are enormous. On this issue,
like so many others, the American people
deserve to hear the truth.
