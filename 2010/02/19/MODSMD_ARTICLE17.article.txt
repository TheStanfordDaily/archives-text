# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## "The Dogmatic Instinct" 
### Aysha Bagchi 
Most of us tend to assume we have a
special claim on the truth. Call it our
dogmatic instinct. Particularly in a
university setting, it seems almost common
place to find two parties standing in opposi
tion, one claiming to know the truth while the
other insists on an incompatible piece of wis
dom.

This attitude has some good conse
quences. It encourages us to argue with pas
sion, exposing others to the strongest ap
peals. It gives us the comfort of viewing be
liefs as grounded and worthy of pursuit. It
can direct our lives in ways that have mean
ing to us. But our dogmatic instinct also leads
to an instinctual intolerance of the views of
others, an intolerance that prevents us from
listening properly. We already know that the
opposition's train of thought leads to their
calamity, so why hop on for a ride?
I have been thinking about these issues
ever since I read William James's essay, "The
Will to Believe," a couple weeks ago. In it,
James distinguishes between two ways of un
derstanding the pursuit of truth: the empiri
cist way and the absolutist way. The empiri
cist way is to view truth as something we can
attain but cannot know we have attained.
This view, notably prevailing in the physical
sciences, helps us overcome our instinctively
assuming attitudes and be more hesitant to
assert the finality of our conclusions. It ren
ders the latest discoverer a little less smug.
The absolutist way, by contrast, views
truth as something we can attain and can
know we have attained. This view is more
commonplace, pervading our public forums
and inner thoughts. We may not express it,
but our language suggests our assumption of
infallibility (that is, up to the moment we
change our minds).
The most obvious examples of this atti
tude occur where debate is most heated: in
the realms of politics, faith and personal rela
tions. Last year, a friend told me and two oth
ers at a dinner table that she had never been
in the habit of believing other people are
plainly wrong, but when it came to gay mar
riage, those who oppose it are completely
and plainly wrong. In a somewhat ironic
twist, the two others at the table said they op
posed gay marriage, one because his faith
obliged him and the other because she be
lieved the definition of marriage is a union
between man and woman. In remembering
this exchange, I wonder, what is the best way
to understand disagreement in a diverse
world?

The history of ideas is largely a history of
mistakes. From geocentric to heliocentric

views of our solar system, from Creationism
to Evolutionary Theory, from ancient medi
cine to modern medical practices, the human
population seems to be constantly denounc
ing the beliefs of the past. And our fallibility
is further highlighted in the present contin
gencies that shape our beliefs. A person from
rural America is more likely to favor gun
rights; a woman is more likely to support
Hillary Clinton's campaign.
The contingencies of our beliefs and our
history of mistakes should encourage us to
think and speak less dogmatically, to eagerly
pursue the strongest arguments on the other
side and listen to dissenters with an open
mind. This is hard work. The dogmatic in
stinct is well ingrained. Being open to justifi
cations for prohibiting same-sex marriage,
using torture in interrogations, allowing
abortions, discontinuing foreign aid, legaliz
ing prostitution and a whole host of other
passion-filled issues can wear on our moral
instincts in different ways. Just considering
opposing arguments feels like a betrayal on
the heart. So what are we to do?

As I see it, we have two options: tran
scending or suppressing the dogmatic in
stinct. We can transcend it by adopting the
empiricist way of understanding the pursuit
of truth. Once we purge ourselves of a feeling
of absolute certainty about our beliefs, chal
lenging and improving them becomes much
easier. But maybe this is an impossible task.
Maybe the dogmatic instinct is too funda
mental to our natures for us to ever throw it
out. If this is the case, then knowledge of our
fallibility should teach us to suppress our as
suming attitudes, to fight against our dogma
tism. This does not mean we should not
argue for our beliefs or campaign with pas
sion in defense of them, but it does mean we
should question them all the while. It will be
a constant battle of head versus heart, and it
will never get easy. But why should that stop
us?
