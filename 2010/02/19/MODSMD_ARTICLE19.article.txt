# MIDNIGHT FRYER
## "She Consented!" â€” the Blowjob Scenario Part I 
### Yanran Lu 
"Freshman year, I hooked up with a guy.
Five minutes in, he asked me if I wanted to
give him a blowjob. Stunned, I said no. He
asked, 'why not?' I glided uncomfortably, not
wanting to 'ruin' the moment, 'Because... I
don't want to?' 'Come on!' 'No,' Shaking my
head, trying to play it off and still be cute, 7
don't want to.' 'Ah, come on! Look at him [the
penis], this is all your fault! You gotta do
something about it!' 'N0....' 'Why not?
Come on!' I felt very uncomfortable, but did
n't want to flip on him ... because... we 11...
at least he asked nicely... right? And he is
cute, and he is a friend, and this is Stanford
and this cannot be one of those situations ...
I mean that is so far away ... only in books
and workshops, right? 'Come on! Just five
seconds!' 'No ' 'Just five seconds! Come
on! Put your mouth on it! Wet it!' He persist
ed with a smirk on his face, waving his penis
at me..."
Some guys do not seem to get that when
a girl says no, she is not being an Asian
guest at the dinner table trying to be po
lite and only have what is offered after the
third time asking. She is genuinely disinter
ested. It could be that she is not really turned
on (then maybe the guy should try harder to
please her first) or simply that she does not
feel comfortable. One should respect her de
cision no matter what. However, the audi
ence might be tempted to ask, if she is so un
comfortable, why does she not walk out?
Why does she go through with it? Why is she
in the situation in the first place? It is her
fault that she is not standing up for herself..
. And quickly we blame the girl's involve
ment or passivity in the situation. Suddenly
the one at fault is the girl, and the guy vanish
es from the equation.
The guy could even argue that he has
done nothing wrong, that he has not "co
erced" her into doing anything she does not
want to do, that he has not used physical vio
lence. He has "merely" persisted verbally. Yet
what he has done is enough to pressure a pas
sive girl into doing something she does not
want to do. Firstly, his tone is friendly, making

it harder for the girl to refuse his requests.
Secondly, he is firm in his demand and never
backs down even though the girl refuses him
again and again. Thirdly, he perpetuates guilt
by framing it to be the girl's fault that he has
a "boner" and therefore, the girl is "responsi

ble" for taking care of "it." Last but not least,
he makes "reasonable" demands by asking
her to take smaller steps such as "just putting
her mouth on it" or "just five seconds," so she
would be "unreasonable" if she refuses.

As a result of these tactics, the girl feels
compelled by the situation. She does not
want to be disagreeable. She does not know
what she should do; she does not want to
think of herself as a "victim" or to blame him
as an "offender" because he is otherwise a
"nice guy" ... a "Stanford Man" ... and bad
things do not happen at Stanford ...
She feels cornered, accepts the situation
to be the norm, and considers "giving
blowjobs" to be something that is expected of
her. Although she does not want to get more
physically intimate with this partner and con
front his genitals, she questions herself and
feels that there is no other option because of
the persistence. She is to "blame" for his
erection. Other girls probably have to do the
same in similar situations. The only way to re
solve the matter is to appease him, to put her
mouth on his penis for "just" five seconds, but
he will probably ask for more ... but this will
not end until he gets off. And if she flips on
him and walks out of the door, she is going to
be "aggressive," "angry," "unreasonable," the
"slut he hooked up with" or the "bitch who
gave him blue balls" ... so the only way to
get out of the situation is to do the deed un
willingly ...
Consequently, the guy manages to get
what he wants from a sexual situation
through various tactics of guilt and coercion.
I hope to have shed some light on why girls
give blowjobs or have sex or get into sexual
situations they do not want to be in. I implore
you to ask yourselves: is this ok? What does it
mean to "consent"? Is it consent if it is silent?
Is it consent if he asks a second time? How
about the third? The nth?

Let Yanran know your answers to these ques
tions, how you feel about the issue, what "sexu
al assault/abuse" means, or if this scenario
