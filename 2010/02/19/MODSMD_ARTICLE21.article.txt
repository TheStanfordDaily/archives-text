## Fac. Sen. focuses on adaptation 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Change and adaptation challenge
even top universities, and Stanford is
no exception.

That was the message at
Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting,
where focus was on an increasingly
prominent set of institutions on cam
pus that could be the key to pushing
the University forward in its research
and scholarship and in raising its
real-world impact.
Alongside traditional University
institutions that define Stanford's
perceived strengths and carry out its
core activities, the Farm also has 15
independent centers, laboratories
and institutes; they do not operate
within any of the traditional schools
like Law, Medicine or Humanities &
Sciences.

Addressing the Faculty Senate
Thursday, faculty and administrators
emphasized the role that these small
er, specialized organizations play in
bringing Stanford's resources to bear
on formulating policy and solving
real-world problems and on
spurring on advances within the tra
ditional scholarly disciplines.

Vice Provost and Dean of
Research Ann Arvin said that
Stanford's set of research organiza
tions give the University an uncom
mon resource with many benefits.
"At least as far as I know, this is a
fairly unusual structure, not common
to our peer institutions, beginning to
be perhaps imitated," Arvin said.
"We see many of the funding
agencies very interested in going in
this direction and we, I think, as a
result of this history, have been pret
ty well poised to take advantage of
those opportunities," she added.
Of Stanford's independent
research organizations, four are insti
tutes with a specific focus on policy:
the Stanford Institute for Economic

Policy Research (SIEPR), the
Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies (FSI), the
Woods Institute for the Environment
and the Precourt Institute for
Energy.
Lynn Orr, the director of
Precourt, described how, in the 1980s,
interest in energy issues and policy
trailed off so significantly that
Stanford had no institute dedicated
to its study. He said that the birth of
Precourt in early 2009 represented a
second chance.

"Our job now is not to waste the
next twenty years the way we've
wasted the last twenty years," Orr
said. "This is so important to the way
that the world operates in the future
that we need to be playing in all the
parts of it. And we do have a lot to
contribute."
FSI Director Coit Blacker said
that the search for solutions, even if
relying on the exploration of interdis
ciplinary measures, rested on tradi
tional scholarship and the
University's established strengths.
"I would start with something that
Lynn Orr said: you cannot have
excellence in these places unless we
have robust strength within the disci
plines," Blacker said. "So it cannot be
an either-or. It's no accident that the
quality of the work that goes on at
FSI, which I think is quite high, is a
function of the fact that we have real
ly good faculty, really good graduate
students and remarkable undergrad
uates, who keep us honest."
Blacker also emphasized the key
effect the institutes have on the
momentum of research.

"My own view is moving for
ward, we have to balance .. .

between work that must take place
within the disciplines and that that
can't take place within one because
the problems are so vast," Blacker
said. "That I think is the challenge
that is confronting the American

research university. I think we have
the best chance to get it right
because I think we're very self-con
scious about trying to get that right."
Jeffrey Koseff, co-director of the
Woods Institute for the
Environment, noted that the energy
behind interdisciplinary research
often reverberates back to influence
departments.

"I can think of at least three or
four examples where departments
have been transformed, resuscitated,
revived, invigorated, by the existence
of these interdisciplinary initiatives,"
he said.

He described the scholarship evo
lutions that turned the study of
petroleum engineering into energy
resource engineering, increased the
sustainability emphasis in civil &
environmental engineering and
encouraged materials science and
engineering's "huge alternative ener
gy focus."
William Newsome, a neurobiolo
gy professor and director of the Bio-
X program's "NeuroVentures" proj
ect, also described how the discipline
of neuroscience emerged out of the
kind of interdisciplinary research
now emphasized at the independent
institutions.

In comparison to the expansive -
ness of other speakers, Arvin had a
more conservative outlook, stressing
the independent institutions' crucial
strengths but saying that they
remained firmly secondary to tradi
tional schools and departments.
"I don't personally think we're at
a tipping point, because I think we
see the vast majority of faculty effort
going on in their departments, in
their disciplines," Arvin said. "This is
something that is ... layered on. I
believe it gives us an awful lot of flex
ibility, agility, to do new things."
