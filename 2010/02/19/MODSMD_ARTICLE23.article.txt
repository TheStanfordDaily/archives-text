## BASEBALL OPENS SEASON WITH RICE 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 2009 season was an uncharacter
istic down year for the Stanford baseball
team, which finished in the bottom half
of the Pac-10 Conference and spent the
end of June on the Farm instead of in
Omaha. As a baseball program that has
appeared in 14 of the last 28 College
World Series and won more games than
any other Pac-10 club since 1999, this
year's squad hopes to revert back to the
team it used to be and regain Stanford
baseball's tremendous reputation.
With this weekend's three-game
home-opening series against No. 4 Rice,
the No. 25 Card has no time to waste.
Head coach Mark Marquess arranged a
brutal nonleague schedule in order to
prepare his team for the difficult Pac-10
matchups later in the season, in addi
tion to potential postseason play. By
facing Rice at Sunken Diamond this
weekend and traveling to No. 2 Texas
next weekend, Stanford enters its first
two series with confidence and excite
ment, as well as a touch of apprehen
sion.

"There is no substitute for playing
teams like these," Marquess said. "If we
have a weakness, it's going to become
obvious. So if we can keep our heads
above water and play well against these
two teams, it will get us ready for Pac-10
play. If it doesn't kill us, it will make us
stronger."
Rice is a relatively unknown entity
to the Cardinal, as this will be only the

third meeting between the two teams in
the history of the Farm's baseball pro
gram. Their last matchup came in the
2003 College World Series, when the
Owls beat the Ryan Garko-and Carlos
Quentin-led Stanford team to claim
Rice's first and only national title. But
Stanford has won seven of its last eight
opening series since 2002. If the Cardi
nal can continue this trend of early-sea
son success, an upset is certainly possi
ble.

This would be due to a combination
of factors, and according to junior start
ing catcher Zach Jones, entering the
season with a different mindset than
past years might be the key.
"Last year we had such high expec
tations, and we thought we were going
to do better than we actually did," Jones
said. "Now we're coming into this sea
son as the underdog. We have a lot of
good talent and good players, so we just
have to keep our heads on straight."
Junior starting left fielder Kellen Ki
ilsgaard agrees, also anticipating a dif
ferent outcome from last year's season
and noting that the name of the game
this season will be confidence.

"Last year was a down year, but this
year we're ready to get out there," Kiils
gaard said. "We'll show everyone that
we're going to put together a great line
up and turn some heads."
And a crucial component of this
great lineup will likely be Stanford's
stellar freshman class, which was
ranked second nationally, and accord
ing to Marquess is the Cardinal's "best

freshman class in the past 10 to 15
years." Bay Area native Kenny
Diekroeger in particular, a second
round draft pick by the Florida Marlins,
chose to remain on the Farm before
making his major league debut and is
expected to have an enormous impact
in the infield.
"Kenny can do it all. Fie is an out
standing player with good speed and
power," Marquess said. Diekroeger will
play third base this weekend against
Rice, and he will be joined in the start
ing lineup by a fellow freshman, center
fielder Jake Stewart. Mark Appel,
Stephen Piscotty and Eric Smith are
also freshmen that are likely to be in the

GAME NOTES: Stanford's baseball team will begin its
season at home this weekend against national power
Rice, which is currently ranked at No. 6 in the nation.
The Cardinal starts at No. 25 in the rankings after
posting a 30-25 record last year. It will play the Owls
three times this weekend, with Saturday and Sunday's
games both starting at 1 p.m.

mix at some point in the season.
Sophomores will dominate the
mound this weekend, however, as the
projected starting pitching rotation
will be comprised of Brett Mooney
ham, Jordan Pries and Scott
Snodgress. All three had successful
freshman years, and Marquess has
high expectations, especially for
Mooneyham and Pries, who are
planned to start Friday and Saturday
games throughout the season.
"Last year, the Pac-10 was more
of an offensive league, but this year
will be just the opposite," Marquess
said. "Our conference has the best
young pitchers of any conference in
the country, and we will need
Mooneyham and Pries to match the
opposing pitchers. They were darn
good last year, and this year they
should be even better."

Along with pitching, Stanford's
success against the Owls will be heav
ily reliant upon base-running and

strong middle defense. The team lost
some power in the lineup from grad
uated seniors and does not expect to
have the same home run numbers as
last year. Emphasis will therefore be
placed on speed and defensive talent,
both of which can be expected from
junior shortstop standout Jake Sch
lander. Schlander was awarded Pac
-10 Defensive Player of the Year last
season, and according to Marquess,
he is "easily one of the best defensive
shortstops in college baseball."
Thus, Stanford is prepared for a
fresh 2010 season, armed with fresh
man talent, a solid pitching rotation
and veterans eager to do some dam
age to their Pac-10 rivals. First, how
ever, the Card battles Rice. And with
the proper combination of individual
efforts and overall team motivation,
the Card could emerge from this
weekend with just the momentum it
needs for yet another demanding
season of Stanford baseball.

First pitch against Rice will be at
5:30 p.m. tonight at the Sunken Dia
mond.

both of which can be expected from
junior shortstop standout Jake Sch
lander. Schlander was awarded Pac
-10 Defensive Player of the Year last
season, and according to Marquess,
he is "easily one of the best defensive
shortstops in college baseball."
Thus, Stanford is prepared for a
fresh 2010 season, armed with fresh
man talent, a solid pitching rotation
and veterans eager to do some dam
age to their Pac-10 rivals. First, how
ever, the Card battles Rice. And with
the proper combination of individual
efforts and overall team motivation,
the Card could emerge from this
weekend with just the momentum it
needs for yet another demanding
season of Stanford baseball.

First pitch against Rice will be at
5:30 p.m. tonight at the Sunken Dia
mond.

The 2009 season was an uncharacter
istic down year for the Stanford baseball
team, which finished in the bottom half
of the Pac-10 Conference and spent the
end of June on the Farm instead of in
Omaha. As a baseball program that has
appeared in 14 of the last 28 College
World Series and won more games than
any other Pac-10 club since 1999, this
year's squad hopes to revert back to the
team it used to be and regain Stanford
baseball's tremendous reputation.
With this weekend's three-game
home-opening series against No. 4 Rice,
the No. 25 Card has no time to waste.
Head coach Mark Marquess arranged a
brutal nonleague schedule in order to
prepare his team for the difficult Pac-10
matchups later in the season, in addi
tion to potential postseason play. By
facing Rice at Sunken Diamond this
weekend and traveling to No. 2 Texas
next weekend, Stanford enters its first
two series with confidence and excite
ment, as well as a touch of apprehen
sion.

"There is no substitute for playing
teams like these," Marquess said. "If we
have a weakness, it's going to become
obvious. So if we can keep our heads
above water and play well against these
two teams, it will get us ready for Pac-10
play. If it doesn't kill us, it will make us
stronger."
Rice is a relatively unknown entity
to the Cardinal, as this will be only the

third meeting between the two teams in
the history of the Farm's baseball pro
gram. Their last matchup came in the
2003 College World Series, when the
Owls beat the Ryan Garko-and Carlos
Quentin-led Stanford team to claim
Rice's first and only national title. But
Stanford has won seven of its last eight
opening series since 2002. If the Cardi
nal can continue this trend of early-sea
son success, an upset is certainly possi
ble.

This would be due to a combination
of factors, and according to junior start
ing catcher Zach Jones, entering the
season with a different mindset than
past years might be the key.
"Last year we had such high expec
tations, and we thought we were going
to do better than we actually did," Jones
said. "Now we're coming into this sea
son as the underdog. We have a lot of
good talent and good players, so we just
have to keep our heads on straight."
Junior starting left fielder Kellen Ki
ilsgaard agrees, also anticipating a dif
ferent outcome from last year's season
and noting that the name of the game
this season will be confidence.

"Last year was a down year, but this
year we're ready to get out there," Kiils
gaard said. "We'll show everyone that
we're going to put together a great line
up and turn some heads."
And a crucial component of this
great lineup will likely be Stanford's
stellar freshman class, which was
ranked second nationally, and accord
ing to Marquess is the Cardinal's "best

freshman class in the past 10 to 15
years." Bay Area native Kenny
Diekroeger in particular, a second
round draft pick by the Florida Marlins,
chose to remain on the Farm before
making his major league debut and is
expected to have an enormous impact
in the infield.
"Kenny can do it all. Fie is an out
standing player with good speed and
power," Marquess said. Diekroeger will
play third base this weekend against
Rice, and he will be joined in the start
ing lineup by a fellow freshman, center
fielder Jake Stewart. Mark Appel,
Stephen Piscotty and Eric Smith are
also freshmen that are likely to be in the

mix at some point in the season.
Sophomores will dominate the
mound this weekend, however, as the
projected starting pitching rotation
will be comprised of Brett Mooney
ham, Jordan Pries and Scott
Snodgress. All three had successful
freshman years, and Marquess has
high expectations, especially for
Mooneyham and Pries, who are
planned to start Friday and Saturday
games throughout the season.
"Last year, the Pac-10 was more
of an offensive league, but this year
will be just the opposite," Marquess
said. "Our conference has the best
young pitchers of any conference in
the country, and we will need
Mooneyham and Pries to match the
opposing pitchers. They were darn
good last year, and this year they
should be even better."

Along with pitching, Stanford's
success against the Owls will be heav
ily reliant upon base-running and

strong middle defense. The team lost
some power in the lineup from grad
uated seniors and does not expect to
have the same home run numbers as
last year. Emphasis will therefore be
placed on speed and defensive talent,
both of which can be expected from
junior shortstop standout Jake Sch
lander. Schlander was awarded Pac
-10 Defensive Player of the Year last
season, and according to Marquess,
he is "easily one of the best defensive
shortstops in college baseball."
