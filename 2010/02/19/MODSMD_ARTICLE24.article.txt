### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
A beautiful day at Stanford ended with an
other beautiful result for the No. 8 Stanford
women's tennis team (6-0) as it ran away from
No. 35 Boise State (3-3) with a solid 7-0 showing.
It was all smiles during the doubles compe

haven't played a dual match."
She attributes her doubles win to her part

a good, hard-hitting groundstroke game,
which just makes my life so much easier at the
net."

Singles proved to be trouble-free as well.
Mallory Burdette whipped through her oppo
nent 6-0,6-1 to record the first singles victory.
Older sister Lindsay Burdette clinched the
victory by defeating Lauren Megale an even
