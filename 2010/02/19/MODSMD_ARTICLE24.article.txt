# WOMEN'S TENNIS CRUSHES BOISE
## 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
A beautiful day at Stanford ended with an
other beautiful result for the No. 8 Stanford
women's tennis team (6-0) as it ran away from
No. 35 Boise State (3-3) with a solid 7-0 showing.
It was all smiles during the doubles compe
tition. Stanford's No. 3 team of Veronica Li
and Jennifer Yen sprinted to an 8-0 finish to
bring in the Cardinal's first point of the day.

The freshmen tandem of Mallory Burdette
and Stacey Tan were close behind with an 8-3
victory, and all gathered to watch the No. 1
match. The Broncos' Lauren Megale and Pi
chittra Thongdach were able to keep each
game close, but the experience of the No. 2
duo of Hilary Barte and Lindsay Burdette
was enough to bring the Cardinal pair to an 8-
3 victory.
Yen, a junior, was out on the court for her
first dual match of the season. She recorded

two of the more convincing victories on the
day and took full advantage of her playing
time.

"I just played solid," Yen said. "A little
rusty, but you kind of expect that when you
haven't played a dual match."
She attributes her doubles win to her part
nership with Li, whom she has played with
frequently in past years.
"It wasn't the prettiest of matches, but we
got the work done," Yen said. "It's fun to play

with her. We mesh pretty well because she has
a good, hard-hitting groundstroke game,
which just makes my life so much easier at the
net."

Singles proved to be trouble-free as well.
Mallory Burdette whipped through her oppo
nent 6-0,6-1 to record the first singles victory.
Older sister Lindsay Burdette clinched the
victory by defeating Lauren Megale an even
6-3, 6-3. Only Veronica Li was
pushed in the end before finishing
off Marlena Pietzuch 6-2, 7-5, but
even hers was a straight sets win.
Mallory was very happy that
things came together today for her
win despite the hard work of her
studies.
"Things have been difficult with
classes and work that I have going
on," she said. "But I feel like out
there, on the court, everything is just
clicking. I'm feeling much more
comfortable in these dual matches."
The one blemish on an otherwise
perfect day was the absence of jun
ior Carolyn McVeigh. Sidelined by a
diagnosis of severe tonsillitis, she
was unable to suit up for the match,
but will return for next week's
match against Hawaii and will prac
tice this weekend. McVeigh is
ranked No. 78 nationally and has
been a staple at the No. 5 spot for
Stanford. She is 5-0 in singles dual

play, 10-4 overall and has a 5-0
record with Li in doubles.
"[l] should be feeling well
enough to start playing over [the]
weekend," McVeigh said. "[l] didn't
get [my tonsils] removed, so recov
ery shouldn't be too bad. Feeling a
lot better actually and looking for
ward to being back out there on
Wednesday!"
Boise State dropped to 3-3 on the
year and has failed to record a win
over a top 50 team. Their one ranked
win came against No. 60 Colorado, 5-
2. Meanwhile, the Cardinal looks for
ward in its preparation to its upcom
ing trip to Los Angeles to take on No.
4 UCLA and Southern California.
"I have my little calendar that I
write things down on and definitely
[the L.A. matches] have stars beside
them," Mallory Burdette said.
"They're pretty much our rivals and
they're usually pretty good teams, so
it's a test to see where we are."
Similar to the Texas Longhorns
team the Cardinal has already faced,
both L.A. schools always bring out a
good crowd. Yen is preparing for a
return to that kind of atmosphere.
"The L.A. schools bring a

crowd," she said. "Last year, we beat
[UCLA] pretty soundly, 6-1 I think.
It's always fun to shut up a home
crowd and let your tennis do the
talking."
The Cardinal welcomes Hawaii
next Wednesday in a match moved
from January due to rain.
