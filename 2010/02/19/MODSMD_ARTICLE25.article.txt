## Card faces five in Invitational 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford Softball team (4-1) will
play its first home games of the season this
weekend when it hosts the Stanford Nike Invi
tational.

The Cardinal will play five games during the
round-robin tournament, including three
against teams that participated in last year's
NCAA Tournament.

This tournament should prove to be a good
test for a young Cardinal squad still searching
for its identity.
Stanford begins the weekend having lost its
last outing, the championship game of the Par
adise Softball Classic, to the University of
Hawaii last Saturday. The defeat came after the
Cardinal won its first four games in Hawaii.
Leading the Cardinal offensively in Hawaii
were senior catcher Rosey Neill and freshman
shortstop Jenna Rich.
Neill leads the team with a .538 batting aver
age, while Rich is hitting .444 and has blasted
three home runs hitting in the third spot in the
Cardinal lineup.
Rich is excited about having the opportunity
to contribute as a freshman to the Cardinal
team.

"I'm just honored to be part of this team and
I'm trying to contribute to the team anyway that
I can," she said. "I'm flattered."

In the circle Stanford has been using two
pitchersâ€”junior Ashley Chinn and freshman
Teagan Gerhart and will likely continue to
this weekend.

Last weekend Chinn started three games,
going 2-1 with a 2.47 ERA, while Gerhart went
2-0 with a 2.00 ERA.

Head coach John Rittman is pleased with his
pitchers, but also realizes that they have the po
tential to be better.

"I thought they pitched fairly well, though
there are things they need to work on," he said.
"They will make adjustments and improve."
Stanford plays its first game of the tourna
ment today at 2:30 p.m. against the University of
Illinois.

The Fighting Illini (5-0), who played in an
NCAA Regional last season, enter the tourna
ment undefeated after sweeping through the
UNLV Sportco Kick-off Classic last weekend.
Illinois boasts a powerful offense, averaging al-
most nine runs a game.
That offense is led by speedy sec
ond baseman and leadoff hitter
Danielle Zymkowitz. She enters the
weekend with a .563 batting average
and is 4-4 on stolen bases.

In its second game on Friday, Stan
ford will square off with UC-River
side (2-2). The Highlanders split apair
of game each with Boise State and the
University of San Diego. They are led
by the reigning Big West Player of the
Week, sophomore Brittany Keener,
who is hitting .500 with a .857 slugging
percentage.

On Saturday the Cardinal will
again play a pair of games, this time
against the University of Nevada and
Sacramento State.

Nevada had a disappointing open
ing to its season, going 2-3 at the Ka
jikawa Classic in Tempe, Ariz. The
Wolfpack is expected to compete for
the Western Athletic Conference title
this season.

Sacramento State (2-4) is led by
sophomore infielder Desiree Beltran,
who is hitting .500, including a home run.

The Cardinal closes out its tourna
ment with a showdown against No. 17
Fresno State. The Bulldogs (6-0)
have only allowed four runs all sea
son. They are led in the circle by junior
lefthander Morgan Melloh, who is 3-0
and has a 0.35 ERA.
Rittman is excited about the level

of competition that will be coming to
the Farm this weekend.

"Illinois is a very good team and
will be a test," he said. "And Fresno
State and Nevada are two WAC
teams with dominating-type pitchers
that will be a challenge for us."

Stanford's success or failure this
weekend will hinge as it will all sea
son in many ways on the play of
Rich and Gerhart, two freshmen.

Rich thanks her older teammates
for helping her balance the rigors of
being a Stanford student-athlete with
being successful on the field.
While Rich had a great weekend at
the plate last weekend, she struggled
with the speed of the game in the field,
making three errors. Nonetheless, she
understands that she needs to keep
working hard, and believes she will
still find success.

"The game of Softball is based off
of failure," Rich said. "What's impor
tant is how you redeem yourself."
Rittman, for his part, has confi
dence in Rich, and plans to continue
playing her at shortstop, despite hav
ing last year's starter, sophomore
Ashley Hansen, playing second base
a position he sees as being just as
important defensively.
How Rich and Hansen play this
weekend will have a huge impact on
Stanford's performance in its home
opening series. All five games will
take place at Smith Family Stadium,
beginning with today's matchup with
Illinois.
