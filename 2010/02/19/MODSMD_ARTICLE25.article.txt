## Card faces five in Invitational 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford Softball team (4-1) will
play its first home games of the season this
weekend when it hosts the Stanford Nike Invi
tational.

The Cardinal will play five games during the
round-robin tournament, including three
against teams that participated in last year's
NCAA Tournament.

This tournament should prove to be a good
test for a young Cardinal squad still searching
for its identity.
Stanford begins the weekend having lost its
last outing, the championship game of the Par

Hawaii last Saturday. The defeat came after the
Cardinal won its first four games in Hawaii.
Leading the Cardinal offensively in Hawaii
were senior catcher Rosey Neill and freshman
shortstop Jenna Rich.
Neill leads the team with a .538 batting aver

Cardinal lineup.
Rich is excited about having the opportunity
to contribute as a freshman to the Cardinal
team.

"I'm just honored to be part of this team and
I'm trying to contribute to the team anyway that
I can," she said. "I'm flattered."

In the circle Stanford has been using two
pitchersâ€”junior Ashley Chinn and freshman
Teagan Gerhart and will likely continue to

Last weekend Chinn started three games,
going 2-1 with a 2.47 ERA, while Gerhart went
2-0 with a 2.00 ERA.

Head coach John Rittman is pleased with his
pitchers, but also realizes that they have the po
tential to be better.

"I thought they pitched fairly well, though
there are things they need to work on," he said.
"They will make adjustments and improve."
Stanford plays its first game of the tourna
ment today at 2:30 p.m. against the University of
Illinois.

The Fighting Illini (5-0), who played in an
NCAA Regional last season, enter the tourna
ment undefeated after sweeping through the
UNLV Sportco Kick-off Classic last weekend.
Illinois boasts a powerful offense, averaging al-
