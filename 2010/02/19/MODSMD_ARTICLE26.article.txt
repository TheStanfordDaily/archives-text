# CARDINAL TAKES ON BOISE, CAL
## 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
It feels good to be home.

That is what the No. 9 Stanford men's tennis
team is thinking after a tough road trip that de
livered the Cardinal its first loss of the season.

Stanford returns to Taube Family Tennis
Center to face Boise State today and Cal on Sat
urday, the first two of five straight home games
for Stanford. Though it signals the start of Pac
-10 play, the Cal match will not count toward the
Cardinal's conference record.
The Boise State match will be Stanford's
first action since last weekend's National Team
Indoor Championships in Charlottesville, Va.
After defeating UNC-Wilmington and Okla
homa at Stanford to qualify, the Cardinal faced
No. BTexas in the Round of 16.
In its first true test of the season, the Cardi
nal simply folded, losing 4-0. The Longhorns
swept the doubles lineup, including a stunning

upset of the nation's top-ranked team of soph
omores Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher. In
singles,Thacher, junior Alex Clayton and senior
Richard Wire were the first three Cardinal men
to lose, securing the shutout loss. Klahn, fresh
man Matt Kandath and junior Greg Hirshman
were all losing at the time the match was
clinched.

"Texas is a good team, and they were defi
nitely more prepared than we were to play the
match," Klahn said. "We came out a little bit flat,
and they came out with a lot of energy and took
it to us."

In the consolation bracket, Stanford defeat
ed No. 30 Fresno State and No. 10 Kentucky.,
Stanford hopes to continue its win streak
today against Boise State, a much easier oppo
nent than Texas or Kentucky. The Broncos are
3-2 on the season, with victories over Oregon,
Utah State and Weber State and losses to Wash
ington and Virginia Tech.

Still, Boise State is not a walkover team and
has played competitively against the Cardinal
in the past, including a 5-1 victory over Stanford
in 2007.

"Their coach does a great job of getting
them pumped up," Klahn said.
On Saturday, Stanford faces a familiar foe:
the Golden Bears. Cal is 6-1 on the season, with
big wins over Flawaii and Fresno State. Its only
loss on the season also came at the hands of the
Longhorns a 4-0 sweep.
"It's always a tough match, a tough fight
against Cal," Wire said. "You can't take them
lightly. They got good doubles and get inspired
for the rivalry matches."
In what has become an increasingly annoy
ing recurring theme for the Cardinal this sea
son, weather will once again threaten the week
end matches. The forecast calls for rain showers
this afternoon, continuing into early tomorrow
morning.

Luckily for the Cardinal, it has become used
to the uncertainty of delays.

"It's the same drill as before," Klahn said.
"We've been through this before, so I think the
guys should be relatively comfortable."

On the horizon loom No. 4 UCLA and No.
1 USC, the defending national champion. The
Southern California schools come to Stanford
next weekend in what could be a serious wake
up call for the Cardinal.
While Stanford is doing its best not to look
past Boise and Cal this weekend, the players are
well aware of the opponents they will be facing.
"We're not looking just to win the matches
(against Boise and Cal), but also to improve and
get ready for UCLA and USC," Wire said.
Klahn is doing his best to try to focus on this
weekend.

"Once Sunday rolls around, that's when
we'll start preparing for them," he said.
The match against Boise State is set to start
1:30 p.m. today, and the match against Cal is
scheduled for 1 p.m. tomorrow.
