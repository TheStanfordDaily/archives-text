# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Two top-5 foes wait in SoCal 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball team
faces a tough challenge this weekend, as it
travels down to southern California to play
its first matches away from home in nearly a
month.

After its impressive home wins over
then-No. 3 UCLA and defending champion
UC-Irvine, the Cardinal (7-3, 6-3 MPSF)
looks to continue its success on the road
against No. 4 Pepperdine and No. 3 USC.
Both matches will be extremely important
for the Card in maintaining momentum
and because they are against fellow Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) op
ponents.

"Beating the historical powerhouse in
UCLA and the defending champions in
UCI was extremely important for our sea
son," said junior outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin, who returned to action against
UCLA after battling an injury. "Our wins
last weekend were huge, not just because
they were against talented teams, but be
cause they were wins. In our league, first
place is separated from eighth place by two
losses."

The Card is currently at a high point in its
season, having won its last four matches, in
cluding a sweep over UCLA last Friday. In
that match, sophomore outside hitter Brad
Lawson led the Cardinal, hitting .400 with
15 kills. Combined with his performance in
the Irvine match on Saturday, where he con
tributed 22 kills, Lawson's efforts last week
end earned him National Player of the
Week honors. McLachlin contributed a total
of 15 kills in his first two games back for the
Card and senior opposite Evan Romero
added 27 more over the two-game stretch.
However, more important than the individ
ual successes were the two wins for Stanford
in the MPSF, where victories are not always
easy to come by.
"One of the biggest differences was our
passing and offense," McLachlin said, com
paring the weekend matches with losses
earlier in the season. "When we pass the
ball, our offense is similar to that of the foot
ball team explosive. We have also been
working on our middle attack."
