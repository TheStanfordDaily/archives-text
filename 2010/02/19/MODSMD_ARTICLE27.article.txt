# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Two top-5 foes wait in SoCal 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball team
faces a tough challenge this weekend, as it
travels down to southern California to play
its first matches away from home in nearly a
month.

After its impressive home wins over
then-No. 3 UCLA and defending champion
UC-Irvine, the Cardinal (7-3, 6-3 MPSF)
looks to continue its success on the road
against No. 4 Pepperdine and No. 3 USC.
Both matches will be extremely important
for the Card in maintaining momentum
and because they are against fellow Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) op
ponents.

"Beating the historical powerhouse in
UCLA and the defending champions in
UCI was extremely important for our sea
son," said junior outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin, who returned to action against
UCLA after battling an injury. "Our wins
last weekend were huge, not just because
they were against talented teams, but be
cause they were wins. In our league, first
place is separated from eighth place by two
losses."

The Card is currently at a high point in its
season, having won its last four matches, in
cluding a sweep over UCLA last Friday. In
that match, sophomore outside hitter Brad
Lawson led the Cardinal, hitting .400 with
15 kills. Combined with his performance in
the Irvine match on Saturday, where he con
tributed 22 kills, Lawson's efforts last week
end earned him National Player of the
Week honors. McLachlin contributed a total
of 15 kills in his first two games back for the
Card and senior opposite Evan Romero
added 27 more over the two-game stretch.
However, more important than the individ
ual successes were the two wins for Stanford
in the MPSF, where victories are not always
easy to come by.
"One of the biggest differences was our
passing and offense," McLachlin said, com
paring the weekend matches with losses
earlier in the season. "When we pass the
ball, our offense is similar to that of the foot
ball team explosive. We have also been
working on our middle attack."
This weekend, Stanford will be looking
to earn two more wins, and solidify
its spot near the top of the confer
ence standings the team is cur
rently in second place. However, if
it wants to do so, the Card will have
to beat two high-quality squads in
Pepperdine and USC.
On Friday, the Cardinal will
play the Waves of Pepperdine, who
are coming off a strong weekend
themselves and are currently in
possession of a five-game win
streak. Included in that streak are
wins over No. 1 Cal State North
ridge and then-No. 2 USC. The
team is led in kills by freshman
outside hitter Maurice Torres, who
averages 4.45 a set, while junior
setter Kasey Crider leads in assists.
"Both teams [this weekend] are
big and physical," McLachlin said.
"Pepperdine is very strong in the
middle and on the right side, so we
will be focusing on slowing them
down."

USC also fits the big and pow
erful mold, and is led by junior op
posite Murphy Troy, although the
team's talent is widespread. The
Trojans boast four starters averag
ing over two kills per set and have
three players with over 100 kills on
the season. In addition, the Trojans
are coming off a loss to Pepper
dine, and will certainly be looking
to get back on track against Stan
ford. The Cardinal will be looking
to take control of the match and
dictate the pace against both teams
as Stanford looks to extend its win
ning streak to six.
"It all comes down to serving
and passing," McLachlin said.
"Whichever team wins the serving
and passing battle will win the
match."

Stanford has a chance to prove
itself this weekend as it plays its
first road matches in some time
against two very good teams. The
Cardinal will need strong contri
butions from all of its players to
ensure a successful road trip.
The Pepperdine match will take
place tonight at 7 p.m. and the Car
dinal will face off against USC in
Los Angeles at 4 p.m. tomorrow.
