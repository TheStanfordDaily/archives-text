# Ohno deserves his medal
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Would you rather get a
bronze medal in the
Olympics in an
event, or try a risky
move and have a
chance to end up with a silver?
Maybe a better person to answer
that is Ho-Suk Lee, who secured a
South Korean sweep in the short-track
1,500-meter speed skating finals last
Saturday with a move on the final lap.
That is, until he tried an inside pass on
his teammate on the final turn, no
more than 20 meters from the finish
line. That pass resulted in him getting
tangled with his teammate and both of
them wiping out off the course and
slamming into the wall which al
lowed American Apolo Ohno (who
was in fourth right behind the three
South Koreans) to capture the silver
and become the most decorated U.S.
Winter Olympian ever. Lee's desire to
beat his teammate and get a little high
er on the podium resulted in a big fat
"DQ" next to his name.
Let's break this one down for a sec
ond. If you had watched the race or
seen a video, you would have clearly
seen that the three South Koreans
were going to go 1-2-3. Ohno had no
place to make up his deficit as he
would have not had enough time to get
in front of Lee before the finish line. So
there are the South Koreans, 1-2-3.
Then Lee goes for the silver instead of
the bronze. Can you blame him?
Everyone on that track wants to win.
While he was with his fellow country
men at the front, the medals are award
ed on an individual basis. He, like al
most anyone out there, wanted the
best possible finish that he could get.
So when he saw that sliver of an open
ing, I am sure he thought "Oh crap ...
I can pass and get second ... I got this."
How can you blame him for wanting
the best for himself when he is in the
heat of the moment and in the final lap
in the sport's biggest race? If you had a
chance for silver instead of bronze,
wouldn't you try for it, too?
Then there is Ohno, perhaps in a
mini-panic that he had lost the lead,
which he had held off and on through
out race up to this point. If you saw the
race, you would know that two South
Koreans powered past him with two
laps to go. He is in third and then the
South Korean passes him in the back
stretch of the final lap to move him
back to fourth. It is the final turn and
there is too much space in between
him and the third place Lee. He didn't
get it. He didn't have enough... the

South Koreans beat him this time. No
medal.

Oh, but wait. Lee tries to pass and
takes his teammate with him. Ohno
now sees daylight ahead of him and
crosses the line in second place while
the two Koreans are trying to pull
themselves out of the padded wall that
they dismantled.

The old "it's never over 'til it's
over" adage rings loudly here. Some
argue that Ohno got lucky because of
Lee's questionably greedy move. He
skated fourth-best that night but is
wearing a silver medal.
But you have to cross the finish line
for the race to count.They say 13 and a
half laps for a reason because you are
supposed to skate all of them, all 1,500
meters. It's the finish line that matters.
Anything can happen in the race, and
you are supposed to put it all together.
The magnitude of the crash is great be
cause of where it occurred if it had
occurred one lap into the race it would

not have been nearly as dramatic and
controversial. But it occurred 20 me
ters from the end, from the end of four
years of sacrifice, intense training and
preparation. Preparation for this exact
night, skating the final lap when you
can feel the grooves of the engraving
on the Olympic medal that is about to
be placed around your neck.
But those who don't put it all to
gether unfortunately do not get to feel
those grooves those like Lee.
So no, Apolo should not be wearing
his medal in any sort of unworthy fash
ion. He skated second-best that night
because he crossed the line second.
Other people couldn't stay balanced
and crashed, tough luck for them. He is
not undeserving. Yes, had it not been
for that crash he wouldn't have been
on the podium. But the crash did hap
pen. No one has ever won anything
without finishing a race or a game or
whatever. You have to finish the race if
you want a shot at any color medal.
Ohno did. Lee and his teammate did
n't. Enough said.
