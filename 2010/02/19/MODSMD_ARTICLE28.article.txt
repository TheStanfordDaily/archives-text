# Ohno deserves his medal
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Would you rather get a
bronze medal in the
Olympics in an
event, or try a risky
move and have a
chance to end up with a silver?
Maybe a better person to answer
that is Ho-Suk Lee, who secured a
South Korean sweep in the short-track
1,500-meter speed skating finals last
Saturday with a move on the final lap.
That is, until he tried an inside pass on
his teammate on the final turn, no
more than 20 meters from the finish
line. That pass resulted in him getting
tangled with his teammate and both of
them wiping out off the course and
slamming into the wall which al
lowed American Apolo Ohno (who
was in fourth right behind the three
South Koreans) to capture the silver
and become the most decorated U.S.
Winter Olympian ever. Lee's desire to
beat his teammate and get a little high
er on the podium resulted in a big fat
"DQ" next to his name.
Let's break this one down for a sec
ond. If you had watched the race or
seen a video, you would have clearly
seen that the three South Koreans
were going to go 1-2-3. Ohno had no
place to make up his deficit as he
would have not had enough time to get
in front of Lee before the finish line. So
there are the South Koreans, 1-2-3.
Then Lee goes for the silver instead of
the bronze. Can you blame him?
Everyone on that track wants to win.
While he was with his fellow country
men at the front, the medals are award
ed on an individual basis. He, like al
most anyone out there, wanted the
best possible finish that he could get.
So when he saw that sliver of an open
ing, I am sure he thought "Oh crap ...
I can pass and get second ... I got this."
How can you blame him for wanting
the best for himself when he is in the
heat of the moment and in the final lap
in the sport's biggest race? If you had a
chance for silver instead of bronze,
wouldn't you try for it, too?
Then there is Ohno, perhaps in a
mini-panic that he had lost the lead,
which he had held off and on through
out race up to this point. If you saw the
race, you would know that two South
Koreans powered past him with two
laps to go. He is in third and then the
South Korean passes him in the back
stretch of the final lap to move him
back to fourth. It is the final turn and
there is too much space in between
him and the third place Lee. He didn't
get it. He didn't have enough... the
