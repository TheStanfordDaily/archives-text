# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## EBERSOLE'S JOURNEY 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Chris Ebersole speaks quietly and unexcitedly
about finally making the Stanford basketball
team after spending two years as team manag
er. "It's not that big of a difference from last
year," said the senior. "Now I have a jersey
and I get to participate in all of the drills at practice."
Don't be fooled by Ebersole's apparent indifference
being on the Stanford basketball team means a lot to
him.
Ebersole has had his sights set on a roster spot ever
since he set foot on The Farm as a freshman in 2006. He
cared enough to slog through the unrewarding burdens
of being the team manager.
Ebersole carried bundles of dirty laundry, filled end
less Gatorade bottles with cold water, edited mundane
practice film, transported equipment and traveled on
the weekends to dim Pac-10 destinations like Pullman,
Wash, and Corvallis, Ore. with the team. He did it all,
hoping that the light at the end of the tunnel, a roster
spot, would one day be his.
Ebersole learned to be patient as a high school bas
ketball player.
His family moved to the west coast of France when
Chris was a sophomore in high school. When he re
turned to San Francisco for his junior year at Interna
tional High School, Ebersole was excited to play varsity
basketball.
International head coach Carl Jacobs had other
plans.
"He missed all of summer league, so I had never seen
him play," Jacobs explained. "I decided to put him on the
JV team and let him develop as a player."
"It was really hard," Ebersole admitted. But instead of
quitting, Ebersole, a skinny six-foot-two guard, commit
ted himself to becoming a better shooter and waited for
his chance.
"He outworked everybody that year," Jacobs said.
"Chris was the first guy in the gym and the last one out."
A year later, as a senior, Ebersole started every game
and led the varsity team to the Northern California play
offs.
"He became our go-to shooter," Jacobs said. "It
worked out perfectly."
"I learned how to stay positive," Ebersole said. "And
I realized that if I worked hard, it will all work out."
Ebersole could have played Division 111 hoops after
his successful senior year, but decided to attend Stan
ford.
"As a local, I've always been a Stanford fan," Eber
sole said. "I went to basketball camp here as a kid and I
knew the campus pretty well. My plan was to walk on as
a freshman."
Ebersole was not fazed when he was turned away by
Stanford's then-head coach, Trent Johnson, as a fresh
man. The team did not have any roster spots available
for a walk-on and already had a team manager.
Ebersole could have given up on his lofty basketball
dreams and accepted life as a regular Stanford student.
He didn't.
"I just kept knocking on the door of the basketball of
fice asking if they had something for me to do," Ebersole
recalled.
His patience was rewarded as a sophomore when
Johnson asked him to be the team manager. As manag
er, Ebersole was allowed to participate in the occasional
drill at practice.
"Being the manager is pretty hectic," Ebersole ex-

plained. "You're helping everybody out at the same
time."
Ebersole began a jam-packed daily routine in the
hope of one day playing for the Cardinal. He would ar
rive early to practice to set up the equipment and the
video camera. Then, during the three-hour practice, he
would fill water bottles, move basketballs around, and
assist the coaches.
After cleaning up, Ebersole would hop on his bike
and head across the street to the Arrillaga Center for
Sports and Recreation, where he would play pickup bas
ketball for hours on end.
"I'm a gym rat," Ebersole admitted. "I don't mind
spending lots of time in the rec center."
It seems natural to assume that Ebersole must have
contemplated quitting at some point during his sopho
more and junior years all those hours working for the
team and playing pickup at Arrillaga without anything
to show for it.
What makes Chris Ebersole different is that he never
did.
"There were definitely times when I was over
whelmed. But I never wanted to quit," Ebersole said.
"I've always prided myself on sticking through with
what I start."
Ebersole's relentless perseverance also emerges in
his academic decisions. He is majoring in economics with
a minor in East Asian languages.
Regarding his decision to learn Mandarin, Ebersole
said, "It's been very challenging, but I'm glad that I've
followed through with it."
Ebersole's steadfastness was finally rewarded when
current head coach Johnny Dawkins offered him a spot
on this team this fall.
"It was a dream come true," Ebersole said. "At the
first practice, I was doing all of the drills with the guys. I
had a real practice jersey on. It was awesome to have that
feeling of really being part of the team."
Even though Ebersole is finally on the team, casual
fans probably haven't heard of him.
You won't find him in the official team picture on
GoStanford.com and he doesn't have his name stitched
on the back of his jersey.
Ebersole was just happy to make the team, so it was a
thrill when Dawkins inserted him into a game against
Florida A&M during a 99-69 blowout victory.
"It was the first time I had played a game in front of
fans in four years," Ebersole recalled. "I was nervous, but
I got all the butterflies out quickly."
Ebersole had two assists in only two minutes. Since
then, he has entered four more games and added a re
bound to his stat box. But the sharp shooter has yet to at
tempt a shot in a game.
Stanford plays at Oregon State on Saturday before they
return for a three-game home stretch to end the season.
Ebersole's parents and his younger sister have been
living in France for the past year, but they will be flying
back to watch the Cardinal play Arizona State, Arizona
and California at Maples Pavilion.
The Hollywood script would call for Ebersole to
enter the game against Cal on Senior Day and knock
down a three-pointer in front of the home fans and his
parents.
"If I get in, that's great," Ebersole said about Senior
Day against Cal on Feb. 6. "If not, I'll be cheering for our
guys from the bench."
Either way, Stanford fans should stand up and ap
plaud. He's waited long enough.

back to watch the Cardinal play Arizona State, Arizona
and California at Maples Pavilion.
The Hollywood script would call for Ebersole to
enter the game against Cal on Senior Day and knock
down a three-pointer in front of the home fans and his
parents.
"If I get in, that's great," Ebersole said about Senior
Day against Cal on Feb. 6. "If not, I'll be cheering for our
guys from the bench."
Either way, Stanford fans should stand up and ap
plaud. He's waited long enough.

Chris Ebersole speaks quietly and unexcitedly
about finally making the Stanford basketball
team after spending two years as team manag
er. "It's not that big of a difference from last
year," said the senior. "Now I have a jersey
and I get to participate in all of the drills at practice."
Don't be fooled by Ebersole's apparent indifference
being on the Stanford basketball team means a lot to
him.
Ebersole has had his sights set on a roster spot ever
since he set foot on The Farm as a freshman in 2006. He
cared enough to slog through the unrewarding burdens
of being the team manager.
Ebersole carried bundles of dirty laundry, filled end
less Gatorade bottles with cold water, edited mundane
practice film, transported equipment and traveled on
the weekends to dim Pac-10 destinations like Pullman,
Wash, and Corvallis, Ore. with the team. He did it all,
hoping that the light at the end of the tunnel, a roster
spot, would one day be his.
Ebersole learned to be patient as a high school bas
ketball player.
His family moved to the west coast of France when
Chris was a sophomore in high school. When he re
turned to San Francisco for his junior year at Interna
tional High School, Ebersole was excited to play varsity
basketball.
International head coach Carl Jacobs had other
plans.
"He missed all of summer league, so I had never seen
him play," Jacobs explained. "I decided to put him on the
JV team and let him develop as a player."
"It was really hard," Ebersole admitted. But instead of
quitting, Ebersole, a skinny six-foot-two guard, commit
ted himself to becoming a better shooter and waited for
his chance.
"He outworked everybody that year," Jacobs said.
"Chris was the first guy in the gym and the last one out."
A year later, as a senior, Ebersole started every game
and led the varsity team to the Northern California play
offs.
"He became our go-to shooter," Jacobs said. "It
worked out perfectly."
"I learned how to stay positive," Ebersole said. "And
I realized that if I worked hard, it will all work out."
Ebersole could have played Division 111 hoops after
his successful senior year, but decided to attend Stan
ford.
"As a local, I've always been a Stanford fan," Eber
sole said. "I went to basketball camp here as a kid and I
knew the campus pretty well. My plan was to walk on as
a freshman."
Ebersole was not fazed when he was turned away by
Stanford's then-head coach, Trent Johnson, as a fresh
man. The team did not have any roster spots available
for a walk-on and already had a team manager.
Ebersole could have given up on his lofty basketball
dreams and accepted life as a regular Stanford student.
He didn't.
"I just kept knocking on the door of the basketball of
fice asking if they had something for me to do," Ebersole
recalled.
His patience was rewarded as a sophomore when
Johnson asked him to be the team manager. As manag
er, Ebersole was allowed to participate in the occasional
drill at practice.
"Being the manager is pretty hectic," Ebersole ex-

plained. "You're helping everybody out at the same
time."
Ebersole began a jam-packed daily routine in the
hope of one day playing for the Cardinal. He would ar
rive early to practice to set up the equipment and the
video camera. Then, during the three-hour practice, he
would fill water bottles, move basketballs around, and
assist the coaches.
After cleaning up, Ebersole would hop on his bike
and head across the street to the Arrillaga Center for
Sports and Recreation, where he would play pickup bas
ketball for hours on end.
"I'm a gym rat," Ebersole admitted. "I don't mind
spending lots of time in the rec center."
It seems natural to assume that Ebersole must have
contemplated quitting at some point during his sopho
more and junior years all those hours working for the
team and playing pickup at Arrillaga without anything
to show for it.
What makes Chris Ebersole different is that he never
did.
"There were definitely times when I was over
whelmed. But I never wanted to quit," Ebersole said.
"I've always prided myself on sticking through with
what I start."
Ebersole's relentless perseverance also emerges in
his academic decisions. He is majoring in economics with
a minor in East Asian languages.
Regarding his decision to learn Mandarin, Ebersole
said, "It's been very challenging, but I'm glad that I've
followed through with it."
Ebersole's steadfastness was finally rewarded when
current head coach Johnny Dawkins offered him a spot
on this team this fall.
"It was a dream come true," Ebersole said. "At the
first practice, I was doing all of the drills with the guys. I
had a real practice jersey on. It was awesome to have that
feeling of really being part of the team."
Even though Ebersole is finally on the team, casual
fans probably haven't heard of him.
You won't find him in the official team picture on
GoStanford.com and he doesn't have his name stitched
on the back of his jersey.
Ebersole was just happy to make the team, so it was a
thrill when Dawkins inserted him into a game against
Florida A&M during a 99-69 blowout victory.
"It was the first time I had played a game in front of
fans in four years," Ebersole recalled. "I was nervous, but
I got all the butterflies out quickly."
Ebersole had two assists in only two minutes. Since
then, he has entered four more games and added a re
bound to his stat box. But the sharp shooter has yet to at
tempt a shot in a game.
Stanford plays at Oregon State on Saturday before they
return for a three-game home stretch to end the season.
Ebersole's parents and his younger sister have been
living in France for the past year, but they will be flying
back to watch the Cardinal play Arizona State, Arizona
and California at Maples Pavilion.
The Hollywood script would call for Ebersole to
enter the game against Cal on Senior Day and knock
down a three-pointer in front of the home fans and his
parents.
"If I get in, that's great," Ebersole said about Senior
Day against Cal on Feb. 6. "If not, I'll be cheering for our
guys from the bench."
Either way, Stanford fans should stand up and ap
plaud. He's waited long enough.
