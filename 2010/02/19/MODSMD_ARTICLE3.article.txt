## Friends, Family, Praise Bourn Alum remembered after tragic accident 
### TYLER BROWN IVY NGUYEN 
Doug Bourn '73 spent only four
years at Stanford as an undergradu
ate, but his impact in and near the
Stanford community resounded
today as friends and students remem
bered the alumnus who was killed
yesterday when his twin-engine plane
crashed into an East Palo Alto neigh
borhood.
Bourn, 56, a senior electrical engi
neer at the San Carlos-based Tesla
Motors, and two other Tesla engi
neers â€” senior interactive electron
ics manager Brian Finn and electrical
engineer Andrew Ingram died
Wednesday morning when the plane
Bourn piloted clipped a transmission
tower just after takeoff from the Palo
Alto Airport and crashed near homes
and cars on an East Palo Alto Street.
Bourn's twin-engine Cessna 310R
clipped three power lines before
crashing. The three men were headed
for Hawthorne Municipal Airport
south of Los Angeles, twelve miles
from the proposed site for Tesla's
Southern California plant.
A pilot licensed to fly single and
multi-engine aircraft, Bourn had held
a pilot's license since 1974, according
to the San Jose Mercury News. Dur
ing his free time, Bourn, a licensed fly
ing instructor, also taught others how
to fly.
Stanford Graduate School of
Business student Emily Ma 'O4
M.B.A. 'lO, who worked with Bourn
when he worked at engineering con
sulting firm IDEO, remembered him
Thursday.
"[People like Doug] are so far and
few between how do you find
them?" Ma said.
The two continued to work to
gether after IDEO as mentors in Palo
Alto to Castilleja School's robotics
team.
"He was a gem. He was a diamond
in the rough, and he's gone," Ma said.
