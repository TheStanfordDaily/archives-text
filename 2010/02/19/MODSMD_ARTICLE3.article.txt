## Friends, Family, Praise Bourn Alum remembered after tragic accident 
### TYLER BROWN IVY NGUYEN 
Doug Bourn '73 spent only four
years at Stanford as an undergradu
ate, but his impact in and near the
Stanford community resounded
today as friends and students remem
bered the alumnus who was killed
yesterday when his twin-engine plane
crashed into an East Palo Alto neigh
borhood.
Bourn, 56, a senior electrical engi
neer at the San Carlos-based Tesla
Motors, and two other Tesla engi
neers â€” senior interactive electron
ics manager Brian Finn and electrical
engineer Andrew Ingram died
Wednesday morning when the plane
Bourn piloted clipped a transmission
tower just after takeoff from the Palo
Alto Airport and crashed near homes
and cars on an East Palo Alto Street.
Bourn's twin-engine Cessna 310R
clipped three power lines before
crashing. The three men were headed
for Hawthorne Municipal Airport
south of Los Angeles, twelve miles
from the proposed site for Tesla's
Southern California plant.
A pilot licensed to fly single and
multi-engine aircraft, Bourn had held
a pilot's license since 1974, according
to the San Jose Mercury News. Dur
ing his free time, Bourn, a licensed fly
ing instructor, also taught others how
to fly.
Stanford Graduate School of
Business student Emily Ma 'O4
M.B.A. 'lO, who worked with Bourn
when he worked at engineering con
sulting firm IDEO, remembered him
Thursday.
"[People like Doug] are so far and
few between how do you find
them?" Ma said.
The two continued to work to
gether after IDEO as mentors in Palo
Alto to Castilleja School's robotics
team.
"He was a gem. He was a diamond
in the rough, and he's gone," Ma said.
'Efficient' at Tesla, Says Stanford
Student

Bourn managed many labs and
projects during his five years as an
electrical engineer at Tesla; he
played a significant role in develop

ing the electric Tesla Roadster, the
company's first offering to the bur
geoning electric vehicle market.

Sasha Zbrozek 'lO met Bourn
while interning at the company's San
Carlos labs in the summer of 2007.

"He contributed a large amount
of the stuff at the Tesla EE labs. And
so if you walked around, you'd
notice bins of parts or chairs or
sautering irons or any number of
tools that all had 'Doug Bourn'

Sharpied on the side," said Zbrozek,
who worked in the battery pack
department adjacent to Bourn's
power electronics module (PEM)
unit. "He just seemed like a really
nice guy but very 'get things
done' oriented, very efficient."
Bourn was one of the early mem
bers of Tesla's electrical engineering
team. One of his first and most sig
nificant projects at Tesla was the
PEM, a combined power inverter
that switches an alternating current
to direct current and serves as a bat
tery charger behind the Tesla
Roadster's electric powertrain.
"I think the biggest effect is a
giant demoralizer, not so much any
particular change in the thinking of
the company," Zbrozek said. "I can
imagine that the feel, if you will, out
at Tesla's going to be pretty quiet
and subdued for some time."
Loved Science Education

To relieve the stress of the early
days of Tesla, in 2004 Bourn joined a
team of local engineers to help men
tor the then-new Gatorbotics, the
competitive robot buliding team at
Castilleja School, an all-girls college
preparatory school in Palo Alto.

As the team's mentor, Bourn
donated his engineering know-how,
time and money, students there said,
often donating tools and equipment
to help the girls remain within their
budget. Bourn also recruited
Stanford engineering graduate stu

dents to help mentor the team.
The night before Wednesday's
crash, Bourn worked with the girls to
finish their robot ahead of a Feb. 23
contest deadline until they urged
him to go home to rest before his
early flight, according to Gatorbotics
faculty advisor Dana Mourad.
"He just did it because he
enjoyed seeing the girls build these
things and enjoy learning and having
fun doing engineering," said Farrokh
Billimoria, whose daughter, Sherri, is
the Gatorbotics' captain.

Those who worked with Bourn in
Gatorbotics remembered an "amaz
ingly compassionate," "absurdly
smart" man.
Sherri Billimoria, a senior at
Castilleja, credits Bourn with help
ing her realize her love of engineer
ing.

"If you asked him about a sensor,
he'd give you all the nitty gritty about
how it worked and exactly anything
you ever wanted to know," she said.
"He makes science interesting; he
loved to share what he knows and
explains things. He was good at it."

The more than two dozen
Gatorbotics alumnas who have gone
on to study science and engineering
at schools such as Princeton, Rice
and Stanford are testaments to
Bourn's impact on the girls, Ma said.
"It's very hard to find role mod
els, especially if you go into some
thing like an all-girls high school

robotics team. [There are not] a lot
of men who can do that well," Ma
said. "You could probably count
them on one hand, and he was the
best."
Mentored at GSB

Bourn also informally mentored
many Stanford graduates. Recently,
he invited students from the
Graduate School of Business to tour
Tesla to enhance their study on elec
tric cars in the U.S. and China, Ma
said.

"We come to Stanford and we
talk about living a life of conse
quence and we study it from all
sides, but nobody lived a life of con
sequence as much as Doug did."
Bourn's family and friends are
planning a memorial service in his
honor set for next week, Ma said.
She believes an award dedicated to
women in science and engineering
would be the best tribute to Bourn's
memory.

"There are a lot of people within
the Stanford community who know
Doug, who benefitted from Doug's
mentorship and friendship," Ma said.
"He loved teaching and he loved
sharing. I hope that there's some way
we can carry on those values."
