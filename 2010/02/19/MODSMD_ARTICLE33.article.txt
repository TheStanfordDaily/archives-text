Stanford Shakespeare
Company (StanShakes for
short) opens their winter
quarter production this weekend
with "The Merry Wives of
Windsor." The play is one of
Shakespeare's most famous and
farcical comedies, poking fun at
domestic everyday life. The story
follows one John Falstaff as he

tries to woo two small town wives
in an effort to acquire their
money. In typical Shakespearian
fashion, there are subplots of
lovers, quarrels and mischievous
servants. And of course, the play

isn't over until someone gets mar
ried.

The play is set by direc-

tor Geeta Persad in what she likes
to describe as the '"Leave it to

Beaver' days of 1950s middle

America." The theme works well
for housing the play. The costum
ing and props are fun. Actors don
period attire and hang out in din
ers instead of pubs. Everything
about the play screams 1950s
including the music chosen for
scene transitions, arguably the

best parts of the play. The upbeat
tunes of Elvis Presley and other
famous 1950s icons keep the
action moving and the audience
entertained between scenes. It

might also be the reason that the
play never seems to drag (the
show runs just over two hours

with a 15-minute intermission

about three quarters of the way
through).

One of the most surpris
ing things for me was the choice
of staging for the play. "The
Merry Wives of Windsor" is being
performed in the round. There is
no raised stage, and seating con
tinues in 360 degrees around the
performance area. Not only does
this seating ensure that everyone
gets a good view of the perform

ance (assuming you get there
early enough for a front row seat),
but it also creates a sort of inti
macy with the audience. The
actors take it one step further by
directly engaging with audience
members. Characters can be
found leaping in and out of chairs
in certain scenes as they attempt
to hide from others or win over
the audience to support their own
opinions.
Even with this active
engagement, theater in the round
is moderately difficult to work
with. However, the players work
well in this mode. Actors rarely, if
ever, have their back to the audi
ence, and asides are still directly

spoken to the audience in the
manner you would expect with
regular staging. The choice of
staging also works particularly
well for the venue. Although the
main lounge of Toyon is gor
geous, it is not the ideal setting
for a play. The production and
crew did an amazing job trans
forming the space into something
that works as well, if not better,
than a regular theater.
Of course, the best part
of StanShakes and this perform
ance overall is the company itself.
The actors never cease to amaze
me with their uncanny ability to
bring Shakespeare to life in a
modern age. In fact, for some,
their talent might even be daunt
ing. Julia Meltzer 'lO was a special
highlight, playing Mistress
Quickly, a servant who is always
engaging herself in other people's
plots. Another highlight was Mary
Beth Corbett 'l2, who played an
energetic hostess always eager to
help move the plot, bottle of
whiskey in hand. The play also
exhibits some impressive accent
work from the company, includ
ing Francisco Maravilla 'll, who

works with French inflection, and
Alex Connolly'lo, who sports a
Scottish accent.
"The Merry Wives of
Windsor" will be playing Feb. 17-
21 at Bp.m. in Toyon's main
lounge. There will be a special late
show Friday, Feb. 19 at 10:30.
