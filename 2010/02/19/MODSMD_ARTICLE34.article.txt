# Gorilla Manor: Wild, Yet Sophisticated

More than 1,100 miles
removed from the
cardigan -co nducive
confines of Seattle, the City of
Angels isn't exactly an indie cra
dle. L.A. is more Dim Mak than
Sub Pop, more sunshine than
rain, more clubs than quaint, little
coffee shops. For the most part, it
is the complete antithesis to the
Emerald City.
But generalizations often
have their small contradictions.
For the most part, Local
Natives, a Silverlake-based quin
tet, has been one such inconsis
tency a pleasant indie blip that
has emerged out of the Southern
California scene. Establishing a
dedicated following within their
hometown, the band caters to
those looking to find an alterna
tive to the frenetic pace of L.A.
nightlife. Local Natives are a step
back a reversion for those will
ing to just sit back and listen to
the idyllic offerings of layered
vocal harmonies, delicate string
arrangements and soft-spoken
guitars.

Ironically, though, there's
little that's still local or native
about them. While they've built a
cult following at home, the band
has found most of its success
overseas. They recorded in the
UK, and after removing them
selves from the initial local suc
cess they have come back only on
occasion to please their home fans
with random smatterings of
shows.
Despite this, the decision
to fly the coop has paid dividends

bookings at the

Coachella, Bonnaroo and
Sasquatch Music Festivals
are all a tribute to the
band's growing influence.
What perfect timing too.
Emerging from the same
creative vein as the likes
of Fleet Foxes and Grizzly
Bear, the band released

their first full album, Gorilla
Manor, on Tuesday to a music
world hungry for flannel-clad,
bearded males with the ability to
turn up the acoustic soul.
Gorilla Manor is an intel

ligently crafted album, in which
Local Natives exploit their youth
ful exuberance and freshness to
the business to engineer a simple,

yet diverse 13-song LP. First up
on the album is "Wide Eyes," a
percussion-driven track, which
immediately bolts into the two
part harmonies a staple of the
album of singers Taylor Rice

and Andy Hahm. "Oh, to see it
with my own eyes", they chant,
backed by yearning wails and a
building accompaniment of gui
tars that eventually breaks out
into raw, energetic strumming.
The opening tracks lay
the foundation for the band's two
singles, which rip the best ele
ments of Arcade Fire and mash
them into two unique tracks.
Backed by a group of strings, the
band launches into the garage
rock-influenced "Camera Talk," a

song that reminisces

about the lost memories
captured on film. "Sun
Hands," on the other
hand, is a much more
complex contribution,
with vocal rounds that
build into the shouted
chant of "And when I can
feel with my sun hands, I

promise not to lose her again".
If any criticism can be
leveled at the album, it's that
Gorilla Manor lacks any-overarch
ing theme or single defining
hit, for that matter. Sure there are

cute songs about pixilated video
chat with exes over Skype
"Cubism Dreams" and the
folksy clapping gimmicks of
"Stranger Things," but there is no
"Oh" moment when you finally
get what Local Natives is all
about.
The closet thing to this is
"Airplanes," a simple fusion of
kick-drum and piano interplay,
which provide the backing from
some stunning vocals. The band's
sheer energy and exhilaration are
palpable, bursting through the
record and forcing you to tap
your feet and sing while you find
some place to hide your smile. It's
this energy that drives the record,
a characteristic that will endear
the band to its fans and force its
harshest critics to acquiesce that
there is, indeed, something special
here.
