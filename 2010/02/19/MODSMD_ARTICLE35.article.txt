A young Asian American man stands sternly in front
of a blackboard. "F-O-B. Fresh Off the Boat. FOB."
So begins his diatribe against recent Chinese immi
grants to the United States. "Clumsy, ugly, greasy," he spits
out. "Loud, stupid, four-eyed."
Thursday through Saturday at the Nitery, the
Stanford Asian American Theater Project (AATP) presents
"FOB" by Tony Award-winning playwright David Henry
Hwang '79.

"FOB" is an exploration of conflicting subdivi
sions within the Asian community as they existed in 1980.
Tensions arise between an American-born young man of
Chinese descent and a newly-landed immigrant, fresh off
the boat (FOB) from China. The Chinese immigrant meets
two Asian American students in Los Angeles, where he is
told that in order to assimilate into American culture, he
must strip himself of his "Chinese" characteristics. What
begins as a comical clash of East and West values develops
into a complex tapestry of Chinese and Western theater as
major characters embody figures from traditional Chinese
mythology.

This year's AATP production of "FOB" is an
ambitious undertaking, perhaps too much so. Director
Holly Bliss Rogers TO does a commendable job; the staging
and lighting consistently underscores the tension of the
scenes. Hwang's weighty dialogue occasionally comes off as
stilted, and the actors have a bit of trouble making 1980s
slang sound natural. James Xie 'lO is strong presence in the
play, portraying the foreigner's plight with earnestness and
a subtle comedy. As the American-born Chinese, Alex

Chen 'l2 has moments of brilliance, such as his mono-

logue on the inevitable Americanization of the FOB.
Rounding out the small cast is Joohee Ahn 'll as the sweet
and conflicted Grace.

Certain aspects of Hwang's play do prove difficult

to stage. The back-and-forth between the play's reality and
elements of Chinese myth, while an innovative and dra
matic technique, appears clumsy at times and does not
play out to its full potential.

However, one cannot deny that "FOB" is a
thought-provoking play. Although the piece was written in
the late '7os, topics of immigration and assimilation are
still all too pertinent in today's political climate. By the
time the characters in "FOB" reach an uneasy truce, the
audience will be left to their own devices to evaluate their

perceptions of what it means to be an American.
Hwang is an alumnus of Stanford University,
graduating with a B.A. in English in 1979. In fact, "FOB"
was originally produced in 1978 in Junipero House (now
Okada) by founding members of the AATP. Hwang's
"FOB" went on to premier on Off-Broadway and win an
Obie Award.

Founded by Hwang himself, the Asian American
Theater Project (AATP) is a student group that promotes
Asian American talent in the performing arts and strives to
feature Asian Americans in positive, non-stereotypical
roles. In the past, the AATP has brought plays such as
"R&L," "Forgetting Tiburon" and "Cowboy vs. Samurai" to
the Stanford campus.
After the matinee performance of "FOB" on
Saturday, the Stanford Asian Pacific American Alumni
Club (SAPAAC) will host an alumni panel featuring play
wright Hwang himself. In the one-hour session, he and
original "FOB" cast and crew members Hope Nakamura
'B2 and Nancy Takahashi Hatamiya 'Bl will take a look
back to the beginnings of Asian American theater at
Stanford. The panel will be followed by a reception in the
A3C Ballroom, where students can meet the panelists and
browse through a historical display of 30 years of Asian
American theater.
