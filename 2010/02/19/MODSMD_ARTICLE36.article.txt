Muggle = Demigod. The
Camp for Half-Bloods
= Hogwarts. Grover =
Ron. Annabeth = Hermione.
Percy Jackson = Harry Potter? As
I exited the theater and walked
alongside the comments of my
fellow moviegoers, I realized that
I was not alone in these observa
tions. Is "Percy Jackson & The
Olympians: The Lightning Thief"
just another Harry Potter movie
dressed in Greek mythology?
To summarize, Percy
Jackson, played by Logan Lerman,
is your typical troubled teenager
until he finds out what everyone
else around him seems to know:
Percy is the half-blood son of
Poseidon (Kevin McKidd), God of
the Sea. Percy's royal lineage is
revealed after being blamed for
stealing the almighty lightning

bolt from Zeus (Sean Bean), who
threatens to wage a war that

would destroy the earth unless it

is returned by the rapidly
approaching summer solstice.

Thus, Percy gets whisked away to
a school for half-bloods like him
self (sound familiar yet?) so that
he can train and prove his inno
cence to Zeus. Along the way,
Percy encounters mythological
monsters and gains two sidekicks,
Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and
Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario),
who also becomes Percy's love
interest surprise, surprise.
Who stole the lightning
bolt? Can Percy hone his water
and battle skills, find the lightning
bolt, kill all the monsters, traverse
the continental United States and
return the bolt to Zeus in just ten
days? Well, you will have to get
yourself to the nearest movie the
ater to find out, but in the mean
time, if it weren't for the graphics,
I would have given this movie a
much lower score. Percy Jackson
comes to us from the same direc

tor and producer of the first two
Harry Potter movies, Chris

Columbus, and the similarities are
palpable. If you have seen Harry
Potter and you are familiar with
American mainstream theater,
then you will likely find yourself
10 steps ahead of Percy and the
gang at all times.
To just go for the bullet
points: the plot entirely pre
dictable. I enjoyed the Greek
mythology (I have a penchant for
ancient civilizations), but I think
they could've taken it further with
the graphics great, minus the
monsters (they were all brown,
splotchy and slimy) and the
dialogue not special, but what
do you expect? Also, it was obvi
ous that Grover, Percy's protector,
was intended to be the funny
sidekick, and although I chuckled
once or twice, the jokes got old;
and the action scenes were just
decent. Most fight scenes were

rather slow and unimaginative,
but toward the end there are some
great moments with water graph
ics.
In total, I would recom
mend that you save money and
rent it later. In my opinion, the
Harry Potter deja vu and the lack
of imagination are just not worth
it. Ultimately, it's your decision,
but if you see the film and you
find yourself saying "Gee ma, that
was a lot like Harry Potter," don't
say I never told you so.
