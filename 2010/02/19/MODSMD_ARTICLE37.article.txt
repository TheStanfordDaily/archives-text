The buzz has been heavy ever
since Stanford Drama made
the announcement last fall.
It's finally here: Professor Harry
Elam Jr. directs the Tony Award
winning "RENT." The drama
department's first musical in
decades plays at Roble Studio
Theater for the next two weekends.
Based off of Biacomo Puccini's
opera "La Boheme," Jonathan
Larson's musical chronicles a year in
the life of seven friends living the
disappearing Bohemian lifestyle of
New York's East Village under the
shadow of the AIDS epidemic.
With the recent memory of the
"RENT" national tour in San
Francisco earlier in the school year,
one may be tempted to draw unjust

comparisons to Stanford's produc
tion. However, the Stanford drama
department puts on a thoroughly
enjoyable show with capable per
formances and high production
quality.
The sheer popularity of
"RENT," with a devoted fanbase of
self-proclaimed "Rent-heads,"
makes it a tricky musical to pull off.
Its iconic nature speaks for itself:
this past fall quarter, director Elam
and Stanford Drama received
unprecedented interest, with over
100 students auditioning for 18
parts.
The final main cast is solid
overall, peppered with several bril
liant performances. Much like an
opera, most of the story of "RENT"

unfolds through the use of song,
and for that, plenty of raw talent is
required.
Chris Kucharczyk' 11 plays
Mark, the filmmaker at the heart of
the musical's narrative, with a
refreshingly natural ease. Maureen,
performer and diva extraordinaire,
enters on a roaring motorcycle
and Brittany Vasquez' 11 backs up
her loud entrance with strong
vocals to match. Her rendition of
"Over the Moon" is feisty, with
appropriate amounts of sass and
vitriol. Surprisingly, Ronnie Tisdale
'lO brings minor character Benny to
life, giving depth to the friend
turned-landlord.
Sophomore Bronwyn Reed's
sweet and sultry Mimi comes alive
in "Out Tonight," and her vocal
abilities are put to good use in the
haunting ballad "Without You."
While senior Luke Taylor's Roger
can be pitchy at times, his portrayal
of the laid back rocker with an
undercurrent of torment is spot-on.
He and costar Reed endow Roger
and Mimi with a flirtatious and
believable chemistry. Cameron
Drake 'lO, Jamie Cornejo 'lO and
Anjarae Washington 'O9 all put in
fine vocal performances as Collins,
Angel and Joanne, respectively.
While certain small numbers
are lacking in dynamism, serving as
plot progression rather than show
stoppers, the strength of the pro
duction lies within scenes that make
use of the entire cast. The ensemble
is vocally fantastic, and their chem
istry with one another is evident in
"Santa Fe" and especially in the
groovy, anthemic "La Vie Boheme."
The second act is marked with the
most powerful pieces, including a
brilliant staging of the church scene.
In the intimate Roble Studio
Theater, one is guaranteed an up
close experience of the tensions and
unfiltered emotions swirling
onstage. The orchestra, moved from
pit to the stage itself, grants audi
ences full access to Larson's power
ful and thrilling rock score.
The technical crew does a spec
tacular job with set and lighting
design. The graffitied walls, lone
metal staircase and small tables
retain the minimalist feel of the
original Broadway production while
creating an enclosed New York set
ting accessible to those new to the
show. The lighting, from the strik
ing colors to an impressive back
drop of Christmas lights, seamlessly
enhances the onstage drama.
The musical takes a while to
find its footing, but by the end of
the first act, the audience will be
incredibly charmed by these charac
ters, and emotionally invested for
the darker second act. The latter
half takes off strong and never lets
up in intensity until the last tri
umphant chords.
Elam successfully restages
"RENT" and makes the gritty rock
opera relatable to the Stanford stu
dent audience. "When you think of
college and Stanford, the world of
these students is filled with that
sense of temporality; so much of
being here is about what you're
going to do next," writes director
Elam. "Time flies before their eyes.
'RENT' encourages us all to think
about the day and the now."
In 1996, "RENT" opened in
Broadway theaters to buzz and con
troversy about its mature content
homosexuality, drugs and the
threat of HIV are all prominent in
the lives of the characters. While
dark themes do pervade the musi
cal, this Stanford production works
in away that reminds us that
Jonathan Larson's "RENT" is, ulti
mately, a celebration of life.
Tickets are sold out for all perform
ances. Names may be placed on a
wait-list in line outside the theater
one hour before performances. For
