What could be better than a
play that uses the word
"vagina" at least 100
times?
Nothing.
In celebration of V-Week,

which raises awareness about vio
lence against women, a cast of 14
female-identified Stanford students
will be performing "The Vagina
Monologues" this weekend. "The
Vagina Monologues" which

would more appropriately be titled
"The Vulva Monologues" for femi
nist reasons I won't go into in this
review consists of a series of
monologues written by feminist
playwright Eve Ensler based on her
interviews with more than 200
women about their views on sex,
relationships and violence against
women. This year, 10 percent of the
proceeds of the Stanford perform
ance will benefit an organization
dedicated to preventing rape of
women and girls in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
I was lucky enough to sit
in on part of the dress rehearsal for
this weekend's show. The small,
stark Roble dance studio was filled
with the echoes of women's voices
telling tales of their relationships
with their vaginas. Because one of
the requirements for performing
"The Vagina Monologues" is that
none of the actors can be male
identified, Studio 57 is occupied by
15 women, none of whom look
remotely fazed by talk of masturba
tion or uncomfortable tampons. For
them, unlike for the rest of the
world, "vagina" is not a dirty word.
From one actor comparing
a gynecologist to Nancy Drew to
another describing a rape in the for
mer Soviet Union, this play is com
posed of vignettes both playful and
profound. The poetry and prose of
these monologues tells a story that
manages to capture a wide range of
the female experience. Sex, rape,
love, menstruation, mutilation,
masturbation, nicknames, anatomy,
gender bashing, childbirth and
orgasms the play has it all.
Though I only saw a few
monologues (all of which were
extremely impressive), the highlight
had to be senior Kit Garton's rendi
tion of "The Woman Who Loved to
Make Vaginas Happy," during which
she imitates a myriad of different
orgasmic moans. My personal

favorite was "the Shakira moan,"
though I imagine the "Stanford vir
gin moan" will garner many laughs
as well. This hilarious "moan
ologue," which might seem too
frank or vulgar for some audiences,
exemplifies what is so great about
Ensler's play. In the play's world of
gynocentric monologues, there is
no shame in talking about women's
bodies and sexual pleasure. Though
an inherently patriarchal societal
force might tell us to shudder at the
thought of vaginas and orgasms
and clitorises and menstruation,
this show confronts that pudendum
panic and reminds the audience
that female sexuality is most defi
nitely not something to fear, but
rather something to celebrate. As
one actor implores the crowd to
join her in a chant of "cunt, cunt,
cunt," you feel the power that is
"The Vagina Monologues."
Vagina, vagina, vagina,
vagina, vagina. Can you say it with
out giggling? No. So go see the
show.
"The Vagina Monologues" is playing
Saturday, Feb. 20 (Bp.m.) and
Sunday, Feb. 21 (2p.m., Bp.m.) in
the Annenberg Auditorium
(Cummings Art Building). Tickets
are $lO for Stanford students, $l2 for
everyone else. You can purchase tick
ets in White Plaza; a portion of the
proceeds from ticket sales go to the V-
Day 2010 Spotlight on Women of
Democratic Republic of Congo.
