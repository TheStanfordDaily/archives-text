cc How to Make It in America,"
HBO's latest love letter to
New York City, begins with a
series of snapshots that reminds
me of a high school photography
project. You have your requisite
photos of homeless people, graffi
ti and your friends putting on
their hipster best in the hopes of
convincing your photo teacher
that you are urban and tortured.
The pilot, though brief, resembles
a patchwork quilt of filmic narra
tive and character cliches more
than an original HBO show. And
what makes it worse is that HBO
seems to think that by throwing
some modern music Samaire
Armstrong and Kid Cudi and
funky outfits at me, I'll be
entranced into watching. False.
Brief summary of the
show that has plot and characters

in the way that girls who wear
leggings have pants: Ben (white)
is a failed artist for the new gener
ation (think jeans and skate-

boards), and Cam (not white) is
his determined business partner.
Cam gets involved in risky busi
ness deals, and Ben bemoans the
loss of his girlfriend.

I'm perpetually frustrat
ed by shows where you can see
the artifices of development spin
ning and whirring with every shot
think about the vampire gim
mick of "The Vampire Diaries,"
any Fox reality show and increas
ingly HBO programming ("How
to Make It," "Bored to Death").
The New York setting, the attrac
tive and diverse "bro" pair, the
artist's life, the inability to move
on from an ex all against a
SoHo backdrop scream "this is

the life every middle to upper
class college student wants, so

we're giving it to you 24 minutes
at a time." I can already tell that
the show, like "Bored to Death,"
will suffer from its model of
episodic adventures toward the
general goal of "making it." I can
tell because the characters in the
pilot are intentionally forgettable,
with the notable exceptions of
Cam and his uncle, played by that
guy from VHl's "I Love the
Decades" who pauses too much.
Comparisons to
"Entourage" have been the most
prominent feature of early criti
cism of this show, as Mark
Wahlberg is one of the executive
producers. I agree that "Make It"
will follow the "Entourage" the
matic and narrative emphases on
finding adventure and resisting
the Man. Paradoxically, my
favorite part of the pilot came
when we see Ben working at
Barney's on sth Avenue. You can
take the girl out of the East Coast,
but you can't take the East Coast
out of the girl.
Jezebel.com has pub
lished a couple of articles in the
wake of the "How to Make It"
premiere about HBO's lack of
female-friendly programming.
While on paper the comparison
to Showtime, with "United States
of Tara," "Weeds," "Nurse Jackie"
and "Secret Diary of a Call Girl,"
is striking, I would argue that this
is less problematic for the net
work than the comparison of
content. HBO's TV shows fail to
pop and commit to compelling
setups in the way that Showtime
does and even HBO films do.
Jezebel dismisses women on "True
Blood" and "Big Love" as "buried"
in ensemble casts, but I would
argue that the model of an
ensemble cast and the admitted
gimmicks of vampires and
polygamy create juicier female
roles than the pigeonholed
antifeminist counterparts so often
found on TV. And who would
want to play one of these boring
characters in "How to Make It"

anyway? Apparently not the cur
rent actors, who barely bother to
act in the pilot. It could be that
their performances are lost
among the short scenes, the
Polaroid montages, the music and
the city scans; it could also be that
the script is a joke.
"How to Make It" is
essentially a less funny, creative,
well-constructed and musical ver
sion of "Flight of the Conchords."
The pilot is also like every high
school reunion episode of every
sitcom, because a former class
mate of Ben's, now successful, rec
ognizes Ben working retail and
tells his Russian girlfriend how
great Ben was in high school (get
ting a sense of the cliche
ambiance?). I couldn't shake the

"RENT" vibe either: two guy
friends/new age artists living
poorly, going to art events, trying
to make money and having sex . .
. but not contracting AIDS. This
is a Marky-Mark comedy drama,
after all.
