## Stanford gets first Pac-10 road win 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's better late than never.
Or, rather, better sooner than
later.
It may have taken until mid-Feb
ruary against the last place team in
the conference, but Stanford's first
road victory was an impressive one,
as the Cardinal downed Oregon 72-
65 on Thursday.
"It's been tough, but I knew with
this team we have the perseverance
to get over the hump. I knew it was
just a matter of time before we did
that," said senior forward Landry
Fields.

The score made the game seem
closer than it actually was Stan
ford (12-14,6-8 Pac-10) utilized a 14-
0 run in the second half to create a
16-point lead with nine minutes to
play and the Ducks (12-13,4-9), who
failed to establish much of a rhythm
throughout the night, could not es
cape the hole.
In the process, the Cardinal
reached a season milestone that was
a long time coming the team had
lost its first 10 road games. Stanford
had near misses thrice before in
conference play.
Fields keyed the Cardinal attack,
leading Stanford in scoring with 21
points on 50 percent shooting, but it
wasn't until sophomore shooting
guard Jeremy Green began to con
tribute that Stanford was able to
truly assert itself. Green chipped in
18 points of his own, all of which
came in the second half and six of
which came during the Cardinal's
big run.

While Fields and Green were the
motor for the Cardinal offense, as is
the norm, they also received signifi
cant help from the rest of Stanford's
starters, all of whom played at least
32 minutes. Only three reserves got

into the game and none scored.
Sophomore forward Andrew Zim
mermann and freshman guard
Gabriel Harris saw their first action
since returning from injury, and red
shirt junior guard Da'Veed Dildy
added further support. But the ef
fort began and ended with the start
ing five.

Sophomore forward Jack Trotter
dropped 14 points on 6-9 shooting
to tie his career high. Classmate and
point guard Jarrett Mann finished
with seven points, but he led the
team in rebounds with six (along
with Fields), and had a team-high
five assists. Senior guard Drew
Shiller added four three-pointers.

"It's nice to see the balanced at
tack," said Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins.

Shiller was especially important
in the first half, when he nailed three
of his buckets from beyond the arc.
All of them came at points where
the Ducks were threatening, only to
have Shiller push the Stanford lead
a little further.

"We knew he was a shooter, but
we just got lost," said Oregon's E.J.
Singler.

While Singler was fairly morose
over his team's performance, he was
one of the Ducks' leaders on the
night â€”he put up 15 points and
eight rebounds, while teammate Je
remy Jacob led the squad with 19
points. But Oregon made a number
of costly mistakes, particularly dur
ing Stanford's major second-half
run, when Malcolm Armstead com
mitted three of his game-high four
turnovers.

"We just weren't focused," Sin
gler said. "The turnovers were up
high instead of down low, and we
couldn't get back."

"I thought during that run our
guys really locked in defensively,"
Dawkins said. "We had come out of

halftime talking about what we
needed to do to win. Our guys were
able to build a lead and kind of hold
on."

Oregon did fight back to bring
the deficit to within four with just
over a minute left to play, but expert
foul shooting from Fields and
Green prevented any further incur
sion on Stanford's lead.

Green in particular hit all 10 of
his foul shots, as Stanford excelled in
an area that has hounded it in the
past the team was a combined
19-of-23 from the line, after shoot
ing just 11-of-24 in their prior con
test, a loss to Washington.
"It was definitely an adjustment
after last game," Green said.
Both the foul shooting and the
win were notable because of their
location McArthur Court, also
known as The Pit, is one of the most
intimidating opposing arenas in the
conference.

"It felt great to get the win here,"
Fields said. "I think they have the
toughest fans in the Pac-10."
Stanford's victory pushes the
Ducks even further into last place
and gives the Cardinal a season
sweep of Oregon and the team's
first win at The Pit since 2006. With a
win over Oregon State on Saturday,
the Cardinal can ingrain itself in the
middle of the Pac-10 with just three
conference games to play, all of
which will be played at home.

But with so much left to be sorted, cel

"This is big," he said. "I'm going to
treasure this for a night and then get
ready for Oregon State."
The Cardinal will take on Oregon
