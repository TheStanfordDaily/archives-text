# PURE DOMINATION
## Stanford demolishes Oregon by 44 points 
### NATE ADAMS TOM TAYLOR 
There aren't many better ways
that Stanford could have started its
final homestand of the regular sea
son. The No. 2 Cardinal cruised past
Oregon last night, routing the na
tion's second-best scoring team in an
offensive showcase of its own. All five
Stanford starters posted double-fig
ure point totals as the Cardinal
downed the Ducks, 104-60. Junior
guard Jeanette Pohlen led both teams
with 26 points in the win, which gives
Stanford the chance to clinch at least
a share of its 10th consecutive confer
ence title on Saturday.
"Our team really came out in
spired and worked very hard," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "This is a great team win for
us, and we're playing well at the right
time."
In what would soon turn into a fre
netic, fast-paced contest, the Cardinal
(24-1, 14-0 Pac-10) set the tempo
early with an energetic, moving of
fense. Pohlen got the ball off the tip to
begin the game, and the guard was
quick to get Stanford's offense rolling
against the Ducks (16-9, 7-6). Less
than a minute in, she sank a wide
open three after a quick flurry of Car
dinal passes to put Stanford on the
board with the game's first points.
She would add another two a mo
ment later, and went on to score 12
points in less than 10 minutes.
Stanford employed a pass-heavy
offensive scheme early on, with
Pohlen and the other guards doing
most of the scoring. Peppering the
basket from the perimeter, redshirt
senior guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
and redshirt junior guard JJ Hones
continued to establish Stanford's
early dominance from beyond the
arc. Just four minutes into the contest,

the Cardinal was 3-6 on threes and 1-
4 on two-pointers. The team finished
the half shooting 9-for-18 from long
range.
The Cardinal's other position
players would soon pick things up,
however, driving to the basket and
scoring from the paint. Senior center
Jayne Appel scored her first points
with 11:33 remaining to make it 20-9,
and two minutes later junior forward
Kayla Pedersen would force a Duck
timeout as she made it 28-15 with a
driving layup. Appel electrified the

NOTES: After dominating Oregon for its 46th
straight win, No. 2 Stanford will look to stay
undefeated in the Pac-10 on Saturday night
against Oregon State. The Cardinal will
look to senior center Jayne Appel and junior
guard Jeanette Pohlen to drive the offense
after leading the team in scoring with 26
points each against the Ducks.




ZACK HOBERG/The Stanford Daily
Stanford reigned supreme on both ends of the floor last night. All five of the
Cardinal's starters scored in double digits, and its defense throttled the nation's
second-best scoring team for a mere 60 points. The Card will look to clinch a
share of the Pac-10 title tomorrow night at home against Oregon State.
crowd with an emphatic layup fol
lowing a court-length pass from
Pohlen to make it 48-24 at 2:33, and
would finish the half with 16 points
and 10 rebounds, earning a double
double with eight seconds remaining.
Pedersen, meanwhile, cashed in 12
points. Notably absent from the first
half leaderboards was sophomore
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
the conference's current shooting
leader, at 63.7 percent entering Thurs
day's game, had only four points in
the half.

For VanDerveer, it was encourag
ing to see a balanced dynamic of pass
ing, accurate shots and driving to the
basket.

"I thought we did break their pres
sure with passing. We handled their
press really well with good passing,"
she said. "I was really excited to see
Jeanette and Ros, JJ, Kayla. All of
them knocked down their perimeter
shots, but at the same time were look
ing for Jayne. She drives the bus; we're
going to Jayne, and if Jayne is open I
want her getting the ba11... Jayne is

unstoppable one-on-one and we
want to look for her, but other people
[need to] open it up a little, and I was
happy to see that tonight... We just
really wanted to play our game, which
involves some running too and
knocking down some shots and really
a balanced attack of going inside and
outside."

Oregon head coach Paul West
head, in his first year with the Ducks,
was disheartened with the loss, his
team's biggest of the season. The
Ducks, riding a four-game winning
streak into last night's game, hadn't
scored 60 or fewer points since mid-
December.
"It was a nice win for Stanford,
they played very [well] and shot the
ball we 11... We struggled for the
whole 40 minutes.

"They play you inside-out, out
side-in," he continued. "They shoot
the ball from the outside. They keep
you honest, and then if you try and
take away their outside play they're
going to go inside and cut you up ...
That's not easy to defend."

On the defensive side, Stanford
was able to stymie the offensively
gifted Ducks, who averaged 85.3
points per game entering Thursday's
contest. The Cardinal kept them away
from the basket, allowing only two
points from the paint in the first 15
minutes. Senior guard Taylor Lilley,
Oregon's offensive leader with 17.8
points per game, was held scoreless by
the persistent defense of Gold-On
wude.

"Ros's defense was awesome. Lil
ley is averaging 20 points a game,"
VanDerveer said. "I'm just here to tell
you that Ros is the Defensive Player
of the Year in the Pac-10. She takes
pride in her defense and she sets the
tone. I thought Jeanette D'ed it up
pretty well, too. Jackson tore us up last
time we played."
Gold-Onwude made her presence
felt on the offensive side as well, espe
cially at the end of the half. Just 90 sec
onds apart from each other, the
Queens, New York native downed a
pair of threes from deep on the right
side to help put the Cardinal up 59-27
as the half expired. At the time, Stan
ford was outshooting the Ducks 54.8
percent to 28.2 percent.

The Cardinal didn't slow down in
the second half. Ogwumike immedi
ately got more involved as Stanford's
offensive kept on the pressure, scor
ing 13 points in the first eight minutes
and drawing two fouls in the process.
Just six minutes into the half, Gold-
Onwude hit a two-point jump shot

that made her the last Stanford
starter to hit double-digit points. She
would finish with 11 points in 27 min
utes of play, joining Pedersen (14),
Ogwumike (17), Appel (26) and
Pohlen (26) in their impressive offen
sive outputs.

For Pohlen in particular, it was a
career game. The Brea, Calif, native
has been playing solid offense recent
ly, averaging 9.5 points per game in
the four games prior to last night's
contest, but soared to new personal
heights against the Ducks. With the
three-pointer she made with nine
minutes remaining to make it 93-50,
Pohlen broke her previous offensive
record of 21, set in March last season.
She added another basket from be
yond the arc just 90 seconds later for
her sixth three of the match, breaking
her previous record of five that she
last posted just four weeks ago, also
against Oregon.
The Ducks, meanwhile, had a mar
ginally better second half on offense,
shooting 37.1 percent from the field
as opposed to 28.2 percent. Senior
guard Micaela Cocks and junior for
ward Victoria Kenyon led the way
with 20 and 13 total points, respective
ly. For Oregon, the half was highlight
ed by a Cocks buzzer-beater from
deep in the corner with eight minutes
remaining. Unfortunately for the
Ducks, that made it just 93-52.

As Stanford continued to run
away with the game, both teams
began to use their bench players. At
one point, only two players on the
court had scored any points five
for Oregon's Lilley, and two for Stan
ford's freshman forward Joslyn Tin
kle.

Stanford snuck into triple digits on
a Tinkle two-pointer with 5:30 re
maining, making the score 101-52. It
was the first time Stanford had scored
more than 100 points since last facing
Oregon, when the Cardinal won 100-
80.

With the win Stanford's 43rd
consecutive victory at home the
Cardinal has positioned itself to cap
ture its 10th consecutive regular sea
son Pac-10 title, and is looking to be in
top form as the playoffs loom.

Stanford will look to secure a
share of the Pac-10 title tomorrow
night at 7 p.m. against Oregon State.
The game, the last at Maples Pavilion
before the NCAA playoffs, is also the
Cardinal's annual Senior Night.

points in less than 10 minutes.
Stanford employed a pass-heavy
offensive scheme early on, with
Pohlen and the other guards doing
most of the scoring. Peppering the
basket from the perimeter, redshirt
senior guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
and redshirt junior guard JJ Hones
continued to establish Stanford's

NOTES: After dominating Oregon for its 46th
straight win, No. 2 Stanford will look to stay
undefeated in the Pac-10 on Saturday night
against Oregon State. The Cardinal will
look to senior center Jayne Appel and junior
guard Jeanette Pohlen to drive the offense
after leading the team in scoring with 26
points each against the Ducks.




ZACK HOBERG/The Stanford Daily
Stanford reigned supreme on both ends of the floor last night. All five of the
Cardinal's starters scored in double digits, and its defense throttled the nation's
second-best scoring team for a mere 60 points. The Card will look to clinch a
share of the Pac-10 title tomorrow night at home against Oregon State.
crowd with an emphatic layup fol
lowing a court-length pass from
Pohlen to make it 48-24 at 2:33, and
would finish the half with 16 points
and 10 rebounds, earning a double
double with eight seconds remaining.
Pedersen, meanwhile, cashed in 12
points. Notably absent from the first
half leaderboards was sophomore
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
the conference's current shooting
leader, at 63.7 percent entering Thurs
day's game, had only four points in
the half.

For VanDerveer, it was encourag
ing to see a balanced dynamic of pass
ing, accurate shots and driving to the
basket.

"I thought we did break their pres
sure with passing. We handled their
press really well with good passing,"
she said. "I was really excited to see
Jeanette and Ros, JJ, Kayla. All of
them knocked down their perimeter
shots, but at the same time were look
ing for Jayne. She drives the bus; we're
going to Jayne, and if Jayne is open I
want her getting the ba11... Jayne is

unstoppable one-on-one and we
want to look for her, but other people
[need to] open it up a little, and I was
happy to see that tonight... We just
really wanted to play our game, which
involves some running too and
knocking down some shots and really
a balanced attack of going inside and
outside."

Oregon head coach Paul West
head, in his first year with the Ducks,
was disheartened with the loss, his
team's biggest of the season. The
Ducks, riding a four-game winning
streak into last night's game, hadn't
scored 60 or fewer points since mid-
December.
"It was a nice win for Stanford,
they played very [well] and shot the
ball we 11... We struggled for the
whole 40 minutes.

"They play you inside-out, out
side-in," he continued. "They shoot
the ball from the outside. They keep
you honest, and then if you try and
take away their outside play they're
going to go inside and cut you up ...
That's not easy to defend."

On the defensive side, Stanford
was able to stymie the offensively
gifted Ducks, who averaged 85.3
points per game entering Thursday's
contest. The Cardinal kept them away
from the basket, allowing only two
points from the paint in the first 15
minutes. Senior guard Taylor Lilley,
Oregon's offensive leader with 17.8
points per game, was held scoreless by
the persistent defense of Gold-On
wude.

"Ros's defense was awesome. Lil
ley is averaging 20 points a game,"
VanDerveer said. "I'm just here to tell
you that Ros is the Defensive Player
of the Year in the Pac-10. She takes
pride in her defense and she sets the
tone. I thought Jeanette D'ed it up
pretty well, too. Jackson tore us up last
time we played."
Gold-Onwude made her presence
felt on the offensive side as well, espe
cially at the end of the half. Just 90 sec
onds apart from each other, the
Queens, New York native downed a
pair of threes from deep on the right
side to help put the Cardinal up 59-27
as the half expired. At the time, Stan
ford was outshooting the Ducks 54.8
percent to 28.2 percent.

The Cardinal didn't slow down in
the second half. Ogwumike immedi
ately got more involved as Stanford's
offensive kept on the pressure, scor
ing 13 points in the first eight minutes
and drawing two fouls in the process.
Just six minutes into the half, Gold-
Onwude hit a two-point jump shot

that made her the last Stanford
starter to hit double-digit points. She
would finish with 11 points in 27 min
utes of play, joining Pedersen (14),
Ogwumike (17), Appel (26) and
Pohlen (26) in their impressive offen
sive outputs.

For Pohlen in particular, it was a
career game. The Brea, Calif, native
has been playing solid offense recent
ly, averaging 9.5 points per game in
the four games prior to last night's
contest, but soared to new personal
heights against the Ducks. With the
three-pointer she made with nine
minutes remaining to make it 93-50,
Pohlen broke her previous offensive
record of 21, set in March last season.
She added another basket from be
yond the arc just 90 seconds later for
her sixth three of the match, breaking
her previous record of five that she
last posted just four weeks ago, also
against Oregon.
The Ducks, meanwhile, had a mar
ginally better second half on offense,
shooting 37.1 percent from the field
as opposed to 28.2 percent. Senior
guard Micaela Cocks and junior for
ward Victoria Kenyon led the way
with 20 and 13 total points, respective
ly. For Oregon, the half was highlight
ed by a Cocks buzzer-beater from
deep in the corner with eight minutes
remaining. Unfortunately for the
Ducks, that made it just 93-52.

As Stanford continued to run
away with the game, both teams
began to use their bench players. At
one point, only two players on the
court had scored any points five
for Oregon's Lilley, and two for Stan
ford's freshman forward Joslyn Tin
kle.

Stanford snuck into triple digits on
a Tinkle two-pointer with 5:30 re
maining, making the score 101-52. It
was the first time Stanford had scored
more than 100 points since last facing
Oregon, when the Cardinal won 100-
80.

With the win Stanford's 43rd
consecutive victory at home the
Cardinal has positioned itself to cap
ture its 10th consecutive regular sea
son Pac-10 title, and is looking to be in
top form as the playoffs loom.

Stanford will look to secure a
share of the Pac-10 title tomorrow
night at 7 p.m. against Oregon State.
The game, the last at Maples Pavilion
before the NCAA playoffs, is also the
Cardinal's annual Senior Night.

There aren't many better ways
that Stanford could have started its
final homestand of the regular sea
son. The No. 2 Cardinal cruised past
Oregon last night, routing the na
tion's second-best scoring team in an
offensive showcase of its own. All five
Stanford starters posted double-fig
ure point totals as the Cardinal
downed the Ducks, 104-60. Junior
guard Jeanette Pohlen led both teams
with 26 points in the win, which gives
Stanford the chance to clinch at least
a share of its 10th consecutive confer
ence title on Saturday.
"Our team really came out in
spired and worked very hard," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "This is a great team win for
us, and we're playing well at the right
time."
In what would soon turn into a fre
netic, fast-paced contest, the Cardinal
(24-1, 14-0 Pac-10) set the tempo
early with an energetic, moving of
fense. Pohlen got the ball off the tip to
begin the game, and the guard was
quick to get Stanford's offense rolling
against the Ducks (16-9, 7-6). Less
than a minute in, she sank a wide
open three after a quick flurry of Car
dinal passes to put Stanford on the
board with the game's first points.
She would add another two a mo

points in less than 10 minutes.
