# PURE DOMINATION
## Stanford demolishes Oregon by 44 points 
### NATE ADAMS TOM TAYLOR 
There aren't many better ways
that Stanford could have started its
final homestand of the regular sea
son. The No. 2 Cardinal cruised past
Oregon last night, routing the na
tion's second-best scoring team in an
offensive showcase of its own. All five
Stanford starters posted double-fig
ure point totals as the Cardinal
downed the Ducks, 104-60. Junior
guard Jeanette Pohlen led both teams
with 26 points in the win, which gives
Stanford the chance to clinch at least
a share of its 10th consecutive confer
ence title on Saturday.
"Our team really came out in
spired and worked very hard," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "This is a great team win for
us, and we're playing well at the right
time."
In what would soon turn into a fre
netic, fast-paced contest, the Cardinal
(24-1, 14-0 Pac-10) set the tempo
early with an energetic, moving of
fense. Pohlen got the ball off the tip to
begin the game, and the guard was
quick to get Stanford's offense rolling
against the Ducks (16-9, 7-6). Less
than a minute in, she sank a wide
open three after a quick flurry of Car
dinal passes to put Stanford on the
board with the game's first points.
She would add another two a mo
ment later, and went on to score 12
points in less than 10 minutes.
Stanford employed a pass-heavy
offensive scheme early on, with
Pohlen and the other guards doing
most of the scoring. Peppering the
basket from the perimeter, redshirt
senior guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
and redshirt junior guard JJ Hones
continued to establish Stanford's
early dominance from beyond the
arc. Just four minutes into the contest,

the Cardinal was 3-6 on threes and 1-
4 on two-pointers. The team finished
the half shooting 9-for-18 from long
range.
The Cardinal's other position
players would soon pick things up,
however, driving to the basket and
scoring from the paint. Senior center
Jayne Appel scored her first points
with 11:33 remaining to make it 20-9,
and two minutes later junior forward
Kayla Pedersen would force a Duck
timeout as she made it 28-15 with a
driving layup. Appel electrified the

NOTES: After dominating Oregon for its 46th
straight win, No. 2 Stanford will look to stay
undefeated in the Pac-10 on Saturday night
against Oregon State. The Cardinal will
look to senior center Jayne Appel and junior
guard Jeanette Pohlen to drive the offense
after leading the team in scoring with 26
points each against the Ducks.

Stanford reigned supreme on both ends of the floor last night. All five of the
Cardinal's starters scored in double digits, and its defense throttled the nation's
second-best scoring team for a mere 60 points. The Card will look to clinch a
share of the Pac-10 title tomorrow night at home against Oregon State.
