## Sachs addresses poverty Global development pioneer conveys optimistic, yet serious message 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Crowds stirred with both passion and concern in
Memorial Auditorium Thursday night as Columbia pro
fessor, development economist and public figure in for
eign aid policy debates Jeffrey Sachs posed to the audi
ence a staggering challenge: to bring an end to global
poverty.
Bringing an end to poverty is "the defining challenge
of our time," Sachs said Thursday.
He suggested that many global problems stem from
the core problem of an unsustainable planet and that
answers to war and peace might be addressed by tack
ling sustainable development. For Sachs, these global
challenges can be tackled by achieving material
progress while nursing a healthier, sustainable planet.
"We categorize [terrorist] crises as A1 Qaeda; we
characterize those crises as Islamic extremism," Sachs
said. "We talk about political or military solutions to
these crises ... I find it tragically misdiagnosed."
Sachs identified "a stretch of about 10,000 miles of

instability" throughout the world that suffer from
hunger and poverty critical drivers of powerlessness
that can yield to paths of arrested development. The dry
lands of Africa, the Middle East and central Asia, he
said, are at "the leading edge of catastrophe on the
planet."
The food sector, Sachs suggested, is "the number one
driver" of the dire circumstances felt in impoverished
regions already hit hard by climate change.
Sachs warned that these challenges will only be
exacerbated with continued population boom, especial
ly in Africa, in the next forty years.
According to Sachs, two major challenges right now
are vital resource depletion and environmental degra
dation. He suggested that both of these problems are
very much interrelated and require creative and
dynamic solutions.
"Designing a path to sustainable development takes
us beyond the normal the normal of how our social
institutions work," Sachs said. He suggested that the
solutions to sustainable development cannot be
answered with conventional or simple answers.

"We don't have the institutions yet to address [criti
cal development problems]," he said. "These are prob
lems that the market cannot solve."
He instead suggested funding research at universi
ties to develop innovative technologies and recom
mended a global taxation system that uses greenhouse
gas levies to fund global aid projects.
Sachs drew from criticism about American military
expenditure and the lack of will to supply developing
nations with the foreign aid required to help lift them
out of poverty.
"Our capacity to cooperate globally is pretty slim
indeed," he said.
Sachs remained resolute, however, about the critical
role that he believes young people today will play in
designing a path to success.
"I want our universities to see themselves as global
problem solvers and not simply observers," he said. "I
believe that in the end we can achieve success in a
human and a values point of view."
