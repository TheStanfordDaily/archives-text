## New health coverage gets mixed reviews 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students with spouses and chil
dren here are returning mixed
reviews of the new University
offered dependent health care cover
age the first since 2006
announced by Vaden Health Center
officials last week.

Starting in September, Stanford
will offer an option for students to
buy dependent health care coverage
for their families at a rate of $202 a
month for a spouse, $lO3 a month for
one child or $386 a month for a
spouse and multiple children.
The optional health care coverage
has not been available since 2006,
and the lack of an affordable plan hit
many students with children and
spouses hard.
Some graduate students, including
members of the Graduate Student
Council, which pushed for the new
coverage, called last week's
announcement a victory.

"This is, along with the huge
undergraduate financial aid package
of last year, is one of the best things
Stanford has done for students in the
past five years," said Eric Osborne, a
third-year law student and co-chair
of the GSC.

"In Escondido Village, there are
over 400 children living there ...
those people would really benefit
from being able to sign up for a
dependent plan," said Hanna Popick,
a graduate student in psychology
who chairs the GSC insurance com
mittee.

The coverage will be offered as
part of the changes to Stanford's
health care system for the upcoming
academic year. Vaden officials say
that through the new provider,
Health Net for California, the plan
will be more cost-effective plan for
Stanford dependents than its earlier
iteration.

This move, along with limiting
enrollment and adding subsidies by

the University and the Cardinal Care
program, allows Stanford to offer the
dependent care option again for the
first time in four years.
Many graduate students with
dependents have dealt with the lack
of a Stanford option by either buying
independent insurance plans, buying
public insurance through the Healthy
Families program or going without
altogether. This has especially been
an issue for international students
and dependents with preexisting con
ditions.

"An extremely large number of
graduate students have been on wel
fare," Osborne said. "Stanford has, in
effect, relied on the state."
After 2006, Stanford offered some
help to students in finding independ
ent plans, but for the large part they
were on their own.

"Getting coverage has been a
nightmare. We make too much to
qualify for Medi-Cal, and ... it took
several months, pounds of paper and
hours of phone calls to get my chil
dren enrolled in Healthy Families,"
wrote Alanna Nelson, the wife of bio
engineering graduate student Geoff
Nelson, in an e-mail to the Daily.
Some students faced high premi
ums for independent plans for spous
es, especially those who did not qual
ify for public insurance. The premi
ums for independent insurance hit
graduate students especially hard, as
they generally receive only small
stipends.

"When we lost the insurance, I
had to go to Healthy Families [for my
daughter]," said Adam Beberg, a
computer science graduate student.
"I was lucky that my wife was
healthy, so we could get her onto
Kaiser. It was $3OO a month."

The old plan entered a so-called
"death spiral" due to few enrolled
patients, most of whom had very high
medical expenses and could not get
care elsewhere. This in turn drove the
premiums too high for the plan to be
sustainable; the option was discontin
ued.

In order to keep the premiums
affordable, the new plan will limit
enrollment: students will have only
one opportunity either in September
or at the beginning of their studies to
enroll their dependents, excepting a
qualifying event like birth or mar
riage. This way, the patient pool will
be more constant, and students will
not jump on and off just when they
need coverage, said Ira Friedman, the
director of Vaden Health Center, who
announced the new plan last week.
"[The plan] puts limitations on
open enrollment to keep the num
ber of people more stable,"
Friedman said. "Dependents can't
go off and on based on whether they

need it or not."

The benefits of the plan, however,
are not the same as Cardinal Care.
Students expressed differing opinions
on the quality of benefits for the
price, with some, including Nelson,
calling the plan's benefits lacking.
"The plan itself is expensive and
terrible," Nelson said. "The lifetime
benefit is abominably low, the premi
ums are expensive and literally only a
few dollars cheaper than the open
market, which is ridiculous for a
group plan[.] The co-pays are still
fairly high, and there's a deductible
and coinsurance on top of it all."

Others felt that the benefits beat
out the competition at similar prices.
Peter Olcott, a graduate student in
bioengineering, said he will use the
plan because of the better benefits at
a lower price.
"[There is a] significant increase in
coverage at a lower monthly pay
ment, elimination of a high
deductible, 100 percent coverage (not
30 percent), reasonable co-pays while

being able to access Stanford
Hospitals and Palo Alto Medical
Foundation services," Olcott said in
an e-mail.

Friedman, however, argued that
the plan is good for students.
"One, its simple enrollment," he
said. "Two, no one will be excluded
because of their medical condition.
Three, there will be no exclusion
because of pre-existing conditions.
Four, there will be security in know
ing you will be able to get coverage
without going through an application
process and worrying."
Kimberly Washington, a sopho
more undergraduate and mother of
one, says that she will buy the new
plan because it will make paperwork
much easier and it will make financial
aid coverage more straightforward.
"It's just more convenient... I
was hoping they would do this even
tually," she said.

Families program or going without
altogether. This has especially been
an issue for international students
and dependents with preexisting con
ditions.

"An extremely large number of
graduate students have been on wel
fare," Osborne said. "Stanford has, in
effect, relied on the state."
After 2006, Stanford offered some
help to students in finding independ
ent plans, but for the large part they
were on their own.

"Getting coverage has been a
nightmare. We make too much to
qualify for Medi-Cal, and ... it took
several months, pounds of paper and
hours of phone calls to get my chil
dren enrolled in Healthy Families,"
wrote Alanna Nelson, the wife of bio
engineering graduate student Geoff
Nelson, in an e-mail to the Daily.
Some students faced high premi
ums for independent plans for spous
es, especially those who did not qual
ify for public insurance. The premi
ums for independent insurance hit
graduate students especially hard, as
they generally receive only small
stipends.

"When we lost the insurance, I
had to go to Healthy Families [for my
daughter]," said Adam Beberg, a
computer science graduate student.
"I was lucky that my wife was
healthy, so we could get her onto
Kaiser. It was $3OO a month."

The old plan entered a so-called
"death spiral" due to few enrolled
patients, most of whom had very high
medical expenses and could not get
care elsewhere. This in turn drove the
premiums too high for the plan to be
sustainable; the option was discontin
ued.

In order to keep the premiums
affordable, the new plan will limit
enrollment: students will have only
one opportunity either in September
or at the beginning of their studies to
enroll their dependents, excepting a
qualifying event like birth or mar
riage. This way, the patient pool will
be more constant, and students will
not jump on and off just when they
need coverage, said Ira Friedman, the
director of Vaden Health Center, who
announced the new plan last week.
"[The plan] puts limitations on
open enrollment to keep the num
ber of people more stable,"
Friedman said. "Dependents can't
go off and on based on whether they

need it or not."

The benefits of the plan, however,
are not the same as Cardinal Care.
Students expressed differing opinions
on the quality of benefits for the
price, with some, including Nelson,
calling the plan's benefits lacking.
"The plan itself is expensive and
terrible," Nelson said. "The lifetime
benefit is abominably low, the premi
ums are expensive and literally only a
few dollars cheaper than the open
market, which is ridiculous for a
group plan[.] The co-pays are still
fairly high, and there's a deductible
and coinsurance on top of it all."

Others felt that the benefits beat
out the competition at similar prices.
Peter Olcott, a graduate student in
bioengineering, said he will use the
plan because of the better benefits at
a lower price.
"[There is a] significant increase in
coverage at a lower monthly pay
ment, elimination of a high
deductible, 100 percent coverage (not
30 percent), reasonable co-pays while

being able to access Stanford
Hospitals and Palo Alto Medical
Foundation services," Olcott said in
an e-mail.

Friedman, however, argued that
the plan is good for students.
"One, its simple enrollment," he
said. "Two, no one will be excluded
because of their medical condition.
Three, there will be no exclusion
because of pre-existing conditions.
Four, there will be security in know
ing you will be able to get coverage
without going through an application
process and worrying."
Kimberly Washington, a sopho
more undergraduate and mother of
one, says that she will buy the new
plan because it will make paperwork
much easier and it will make financial
aid coverage more straightforward.
"It's just more convenient... I
was hoping they would do this even
tually," she said.
