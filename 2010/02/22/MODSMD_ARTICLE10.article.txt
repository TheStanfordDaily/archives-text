# SURFING FOR LOVE
## Study looks at the new wave of online dating 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Joe Fox: What happened with that guy at the
cafe?
Kathleen Kelly. Nothing.
Joe Fox. Really?
Kathleen Kelly. I only know him through the,
uh ... you're not going to believe this...
Joe Fox : Oh, let me guess. Through the
Internet?
Kathleen Kelly. Yes.
Joe Fox: Hmm. You've ... got mail.

That's an exchange from "You've
Got Mail," a classic chick flick
that glamorized online dating and
made Internet romance main
stream. If Meg Ryan could find
love online, then people would flock to dat
ing sites, right? Not exactly, found Michael
Rosenfeld, assistant professor of sociology.
Rosenfield seemed rather surprised to dis
cover that the Internet was not, in fact, a
hotbed of college 20-somethings searching
for Mr. or Mrs. Right. Certain demographics
looked for relationships online more than
others.
"People are totally hooked into their
technologies, but if you're a college student,
you're surrounded by other college stu

dents," Rosenfield said. "And whatever you
do after college, there's probably going to be
a lot of young unattached people there
also."

Rosenfeld launched the How Couples
Meet and Stay Together (HCMST) project
at the end of last year in an effort to track
the romantic practices of contemporary
Americans. He found that the computer was
the matchmaker of choice for gay, lesbian
and middle-aged heterosexual singles.
According to his results, 61 percent of gay
participants met their current partners
through the Internet compared to only 23
percent of their heterosexual counterparts.
Of the Web 2.0 couples, gay or straight, only
12.6 percent were 18 to 24-year-olds.
Instead, what makes gay singles and over
-30-year-olds give Cupid the rain check, the
study found, is that they are more likely to
meet prospective partners online than
through the traditional means family,
friends and work.

The first wave of the study featured an
online survey of 3,000 romantically involved
individuals across the country that covered
dating history between 2007 and 2009, and
included 25 in-depth interviews about com
plete romantic histories first crush and on.
"You might suppose that the increased
prevalence of women in the workforce

would make the workplace more of a dating
environment," Rosenfeld said. "[But] unlike
20 years ago, now there are strict regulations
about appropriate behavior at work. I think
that makes people a little more skittish about
seeing the workplace as a love connection."
The taboo of dating a coworker a
common turn-on in primetime drama and
pay-per-view —in combination with the
increased time Rosenfeld says Americans
spend working away from the office snuffs
out many chances for anything more than a
fling.

For members of the LGBT community,
however, the appeal of online dating is not so
much about convenience as it is a matter of
actually having options. As Americans have
only just begun to accept the LGBT lifestyle,
conventional social networks may not be suf
ficient venues for prospective dates.
"You can't rely on your parents to know
the other gay people and set you up, and
you may not be out to your colleagues at
work," Rosenfeld said. "So where are you
going to find somebody? The gay and les
bian population is a pretty small fraction of
the whole population. It's not that easy to
find partners."
A quick glance at the personals section of
SUpost or Craigslist will tell you the same
thing. Grad and undergrad Stanford students
alike create profiles and post personal ads
online daily, in the hopes of finding some
romantic success or even just a quick half
hour hookup in the stacks of Green Library.
True to HCMST data, most of these par
ticipants belong to the LGBT community.
Matt Bush 'lO, the kitchen manager for Terra,
claims that the limited number of prospects
that older gays and lesbians face still applies

to the campus LGBT community, where the
student population is already small to begin
with, compared to other universities.
"I've never actually dated anyone that
I've met on the sites," Bush admitted. "[But]
part of the reason I joined a dating site is
because I just wanted to see what it was all
about to compare the dating pool outside
of Stanford to the dating pool at Stanford, to
see what my options are."

For fellow Terra resident Erik Donhowe
'lO, on the other hand, who had never been
on a first date, creating a profile on
OKCupid.org his junior year was a practical
choice.

"That was just to get experience going on
first dates because I wasn't out in high
school," he said. "[And] it's really awkward
asking people in person."

Almost a year after joining the site, in the
fall of his senior year, Donhowe went on his
first official date was with a Stanford grad
student at Fraiche.
"The one thing that surprised me was how
easy it was conversing during the date
because I normally have difficulty making
small talk and mingling," he said, having cho
sen the location just in case the date did not
go as well as planned. "The time passed
quickly, and before parting ways we agreed
to have lunch sometime."
But, the follow-up noontime rendezvous
never happened.
Even Donhowe's second attempt at
building a relationship online this time,
with a non-Stanford guy from San Jose
fell through.
"It's just hard to keep in touch,"
Donhowe said. "I mean I'm a chemical engi
neer and I have a pretty demanding work

load. So it's hard to keep up with texting
someone and staying in contact for a second
date to evolve."
Unfortunately, the virtual dating scene
seems much bleaker for the graduate com
munity at least, based on the account of a
male student who prefers to remain anony
mous.
"My SUpost ad was a bad experience,
eliciting mainly mocking responses," he
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "I was trying
to make light of the skewed gender ratio at
Stanford in the hopes that some potential
dates might appreciate the partially self-dep
recating humor, but it seems that the people
who visit the site prefer to be cruel."
He refused to comment any further and
declined our offer for an interview.
Perhaps it's the distance or inherently
busy schedules of Stanford students, but
there seems to be a general preference for
and consequently, more success in meet
ing people IRL.
"Most people have probably tried it at
some point," Bush said of the LGBT online
dating scene. "But very few people use it as a
primary way of meeting people."
Still, Rosenfeld's research, the second leg
of which will examine how long these rela
tionships last, shows that on the whole, the
recent trends for online dating are all looking
up. Many Americans enjoy the ease with
which they can filter through (or for) the
other Casanovas and Fabios using search
functions, and reconnect with old flames that
recently became available. And after all, it
worked for Meg Ryan, right?

bian population is a pretty small fraction of
the whole population. It's not that easy to
find partners."
A quick glance at the personals section of
SUpost or Craigslist will tell you the same
thing. Grad and undergrad Stanford students
alike create profiles and post personal ads
online daily, in the hopes of finding some
romantic success or even just a quick half
hour hookup in the stacks of Green Library.
True to HCMST data, most of these par
ticipants belong to the LGBT community.
Matt Bush 'lO, the kitchen manager for Terra,
claims that the limited number of prospects
that older gays and lesbians face still applies

to the campus LGBT community, where the
student population is already small to begin
with, compared to other universities.
"I've never actually dated anyone that
I've met on the sites," Bush admitted. "[But]
part of the reason I joined a dating site is
because I just wanted to see what it was all
about to compare the dating pool outside
of Stanford to the dating pool at Stanford, to
see what my options are."

For fellow Terra resident Erik Donhowe
'lO, on the other hand, who had never been
on a first date, creating a profile on
OKCupid.org his junior year was a practical
choice.

"That was just to get experience going on
first dates because I wasn't out in high
school," he said. "[And] it's really awkward
asking people in person."

Almost a year after joining the site, in the
fall of his senior year, Donhowe went on his
first official date was with a Stanford grad
student at Fraiche.
"The one thing that surprised me was how
easy it was conversing during the date
because I normally have difficulty making
small talk and mingling," he said, having cho
sen the location just in case the date did not
go as well as planned. "The time passed
quickly, and before parting ways we agreed
to have lunch sometime."
But, the follow-up noontime rendezvous
never happened.
Even Donhowe's second attempt at
building a relationship online this time,
with a non-Stanford guy from San Jose
fell through.
"It's just hard to keep in touch,"
Donhowe said. "I mean I'm a chemical engi
neer and I have a pretty demanding work

load. So it's hard to keep up with texting
someone and staying in contact for a second
date to evolve."
Unfortunately, the virtual dating scene
seems much bleaker for the graduate com
munity at least, based on the account of a
male student who prefers to remain anony
mous.
"My SUpost ad was a bad experience,
eliciting mainly mocking responses," he
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "I was trying
to make light of the skewed gender ratio at
Stanford in the hopes that some potential
dates might appreciate the partially self-dep
recating humor, but it seems that the people
who visit the site prefer to be cruel."
He refused to comment any further and
declined our offer for an interview.
Perhaps it's the distance or inherently
busy schedules of Stanford students, but
there seems to be a general preference for
and consequently, more success in meet
ing people IRL.
"Most people have probably tried it at
some point," Bush said of the LGBT online
dating scene. "But very few people use it as a
primary way of meeting people."
Still, Rosenfeld's research, the second leg
of which will examine how long these rela
tionships last, shows that on the whole, the
recent trends for online dating are all looking
up. Many Americans enjoy the ease with
which they can filter through (or for) the
other Casanovas and Fabios using search
functions, and reconnect with old flames that
recently became available. And after all, it
worked for Meg Ryan, right?

Joe Fox: What happened with that guy at the
cafe?
Kathleen Kelly. Nothing.
Joe Fox. Really?
Kathleen Kelly. I only know him through the,
uh ... you're not going to believe this...
Joe Fox : Oh, let me guess. Through the
Internet?
Kathleen Kelly. Yes.
Joe Fox: Hmm. You've ... got mail.

That's an exchange from "You've
Got Mail," a classic chick flick
that glamorized online dating and
made Internet romance main
stream. If Meg Ryan could find
love online, then people would flock to dat
ing sites, right? Not exactly, found Michael
Rosenfeld, assistant professor of sociology.
Rosenfield seemed rather surprised to dis
cover that the Internet was not, in fact, a
hotbed of college 20-somethings searching
for Mr. or Mrs. Right. Certain demographics
looked for relationships online more than
others.
"People are totally hooked into their
technologies, but if you're a college student,
you're surrounded by other college stu

dents," Rosenfield said. "And whatever you
do after college, there's probably going to be
a lot of young unattached people there
also."

Rosenfeld launched the How Couples
Meet and Stay Together (HCMST) project
at the end of last year in an effort to track
the romantic practices of contemporary
Americans. He found that the computer was
the matchmaker of choice for gay, lesbian
and middle-aged heterosexual singles.
According to his results, 61 percent of gay
participants met their current partners
through the Internet compared to only 23
percent of their heterosexual counterparts.
Of the Web 2.0 couples, gay or straight, only
12.6 percent were 18 to 24-year-olds.
Instead, what makes gay singles and over
-30-year-olds give Cupid the rain check, the
study found, is that they are more likely to
meet prospective partners online than
through the traditional means family,
friends and work.

The first wave of the study featured an
online survey of 3,000 romantically involved
individuals across the country that covered
dating history between 2007 and 2009, and
included 25 in-depth interviews about com
plete romantic histories first crush and on.
"You might suppose that the increased
prevalence of women in the workforce

would make the workplace more of a dating
environment," Rosenfeld said. "[But] unlike
20 years ago, now there are strict regulations
about appropriate behavior at work. I think
that makes people a little more skittish about
seeing the workplace as a love connection."
The taboo of dating a coworker a
common turn-on in primetime drama and
pay-per-view —in combination with the
increased time Rosenfeld says Americans
spend working away from the office snuffs
out many chances for anything more than a
fling.

For members of the LGBT community,
however, the appeal of online dating is not so
much about convenience as it is a matter of
actually having options. As Americans have
only just begun to accept the LGBT lifestyle,
conventional social networks may not be suf
ficient venues for prospective dates.
"You can't rely on your parents to know
the other gay people and set you up, and
you may not be out to your colleagues at
work," Rosenfeld said. "So where are you
going to find somebody? The gay and les
bian population is a pretty small fraction of
the whole population. It's not that easy to
find partners."
