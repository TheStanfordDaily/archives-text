# Limon ruled out of Undergraduate Senate
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
The ASSU Constitutional Council
has voted 3-1 that Daniel Limon 'l2
became disqualified as an undergrad

uate senator after taking a leave of
absence fall quarter.
In the Feb. 16 ruling, the council
recommended that the Senate
"review" all winter quarter Senate
votes in which Limon, who returned
to campus this quarter, participated.
Senate chair Varun Sivaram 'll
did not return requests for comment
Sunday about how the group will
"review" votes from this quarter's
seven meetings.
Senator Zachary Warma 'll, who
argued against Limon on behalf of
Senator Alex Katz 'l2, also the
group's parliamentarian, before the
council, said it remains unclear how
the body will interpret the council's
recommendation.
Limon attended Senate meetings

this quarter and, in arguments before
the council, called his votes "symbol
ic;" his status came into question mid
quarter when the Senate began to
consider widely debated special fees
policies.
The Daily reported in the fall that,
per a registrar policy, students on
leaves of absence are not registered
members of ASSU and not eligible to
serve in elected positions. Limon, at
the time, said he had resigned, and
Senate leaders indicated that they
would reappoint him when he
returned.
During case hearings this month,
Limon said he believed he had been
reappointed.
