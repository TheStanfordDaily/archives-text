## THE
						GAO REPORT Equal Access to ASSU's Highest Office 
### Shelley Gao 
LLast Thursday, the Editorial Board
called for the Undergraduate Senate to
limit ASSU candidates' campaign
spending. It is unfortunate that the Editorial
Board entered the yearlong debate now,
agreed with a bill that they will undoubtedly
poke millions of holes in an "expos?" piece if
enacted, brought nothing new to the discus
sion and made factual errors.
Elections Commissioner, Quinn Slack 'll
did not suggest public financing of slates up
to $2,000. His proposal involving $l,OOO pub
lic financing plus $l,OOO in personal matching
funds would effectively help to make all
slates viable. It was not "Slack's alternative"
but a compromise brokered by ASSU offi
cials after hours of meetings.
Enforcement and constitutional issues
such legislation would provoke as well as the
deliberative nature of the legislative process
need to be highlighted. Instead of the gov
ernment enforcing spending caps, it is essen
tial that everyone work to transform the cam
pus elections culture.
Campaign finance reform has emerged as
an important issue after recent candidates.
For example, the Dorsey/Harris Executives
spent over $3,500 to win two years ago. Un
like the Senate race where candidates spend
an average of $2O, the financial resources re
quired to mount an Executive run represent
a high barrier to entry for many students.
We all want to promote equal opportuni
ty to run for ASSU office. Leveling the play
ing field is an important objective and one I
fully support. However, rushing blindly
through the process is irresponsible and dan
gerous.
The proposal consists of the following el
ements. A mandatory, government-enforced
cap of $2,000 is placed on all executive slates.
Each slate submits a budget to the ASSU, and
the ASSU Financial Manager provides a
credit card with a $2OOO spending limit. After
the race, the slate will repay the amount post
elections season. Campaign monitors will ob
serve campaign activities and report incon
sistencies regarding the number of T-shirts or
flyers seen and the stated number on the
original budget. If there is a violation, the
slate will be disqualified by the joint Senate
and Graduate Student Council.
First, there are a number of implementa
tion issues. For example: "campaign-related
activity" spending needs clearer guidelines.
The burden of proof required to potentially
disqualify candidates from the race needs to
be better established. In a special-interest
dominated electorate, spending caps may re
sult in third party campaigning and increased
polarization in campus politics much as it
does at the national level.

Second, spending caps are legally prob
lematic as they violate Constitutional Coun
cil precedents. The ASSU Constitution ex
plicitly protects freedom of speech. Article I,
Section 3.2 states: "The Association shall
enact no legislation . .. prohibiting the free
exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press." The Constitutional
Council ruled unanimously in Hartke v.
Young [Case 5,2000] that mandatory restric
tions on campaign spending violate this sec-

tion of the ASSU Constitution.
The third problem is that the reputation of
the ASSU is at stake. The ASSU already suf
fers from a credibility crisis due to resigna
tions and allegations of financial misconduct
by elected officials from this and past years.
Thus, it is critical that campaign finance re
form, which will affect the future of Stanford
student governance for years to come, is not
taken lightly.
Reducing spending will not help to legit
imize the ASSU. Faced with the prospect of
disqualifying a winning slate because of
slight overspending, the legislative bodies
will either disenfranchise a majority of vot
ers, or shy away from enforcing rules. Either
way further cripples the institution.
A more effective way forward is a two
pronged approach: enhance the existing
pubic financing option, which comes from
the elected Executive's salary, not student
money. And propel a cultural change leading
to a more informed electorate. The legisla
tive bodies should support the increase in
public financing from $750 to $l,OOO to ex
pand access for students. Rather than buying
expensive T-shirts, these candidates can
choose to run smarter campaigns through
creative online marketing and face-to-face
outreach.

Campus media has a crucial role to play to
achieve the broader goal. Publications pro
mote accountability of our student leaders
and raise political awareness among con
stituents. In the future, the Daily, the Review
and the Progressive need to fulfill their dem
ocratic obligations and exercise more rigor
ous oversight. They should serve as "watch
dogs" and pursue investigative journalism
that expose candidates' spending habits from
public posting of campaign expenditures on
elections website, publicize infractions and
provoke discourse among voters.
Voters, already with a predisposition to
wards fiscal responsibility, would serve as the
policing force, Stanford students care deeply
about matters of equality, and they will vote
accordingly. An engaged student body is the
best mechanism to disincentivize excessive
spending. An educated electorate would also
focus more on the substantive issues rather
than a "publicity arms race,"
Let's not be a government that legislates
in the dark rules whose consequences we do
not fully understand.
