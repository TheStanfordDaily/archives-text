## Befriend Your Brain 
### MARY SULLIVAN, CAMPUS RESIDENT 
There was a head-shaped hole in the
badly shattered windshield of the car
on Campus Drive. The paramendics
and police had come and gone, but there was
still a small crowd of people in front of the
Arrillaga Center for Sports and Recreation.

Bike and car collusion? I wondered, driv
ing by in the opposite lane. And if so, was the
cyclist wearing a helmet?
"No. No helmet," said Deputy Allen
James of Stanford's Department of Public
Safety. He'd been the officer at the scene.
"And she's going to take a long time to recov
er."
I'd called to ask James because for the 10
years I've lived on campus, I've been increas
ingly dismayed at how few students wear hel
mets. Sometimes it seems like the only cy
clists wearing protective headgear are old
sters like me.
That's not entirely true, James explained.
"The graduate students are better at
wearing helmets," he said. "But it's consid
ered uncool by the undergrads. And they say
it messes up their hair."
"It's the geek factor," agreed Ariadne
Scott, Stanford's Bicycle Program Coordina
tor, "and following the crowd."
James, an 18-year veteran on the force and
current bicycle safety officer, explained that
at least once a week a cyclist is hurt badly
enough to be taken to the hospital. And un
protected heads connecting with cars or con
crete isn't unusual. James hears the students
say the campus isn't a dangerous place to
bike. "But all it takes," he warned, "is a short

fall from the seat."
"Whether or not someone wears a helmet
is really about their perception of risk," ex
plained Dr. David Spain, chief of trauma and
critical care surgery at the Stanford Medical
Center. "Sure, any one time you go out on
your bike, you're unlikely to have a crash.
But if you do, wearing a helmet reduces your
risk of serious head injury by 80%. It's real
ly about relative risk. We can fix almost
everything else you can break, but we really
have little to offer for head injuries. For lack
of a $40.00 helmet, you're risking the biggest
investment you'll every make in your life
your education."
Scott and James try hard to get students to
wear helmets. During bicycle registration
each term, they distribute bike safety infor
mation. They give presentations to groups of
international students, and provide bike
safety classes for cyclists who get issued a
ticket. Even so, compliance with wearing hel
mets on campus is dangerously low, and the
result can be a disaster that shatters a bare
headed biker's life worse than a windshield
with a head-shaped hole.
So student befriend your brain.
Please. That precious organ helped you get
to this particular place of higher learning. It
deserves protection from a fall from your
bike or a collision while you're cruising.
When you hop on your bike, strap on your
helmet.
It's the safe and smart thing to do.
