# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## American Epic 
### Emily Hulme 
£ Q ING to me, Muse, not of distant
cities built from marble and bronze
but of that place I call home. Have
not great poets given their lands deserved im
mortality by their very words? Magnificent
Greece and Proud Rome had their men, and
even lowly Ireland birthed Joyce, it seems, for
that very task. Why has America no national
poet? Are we truly so ill-bred as to not receive
this one thing?"
And so I queried the genie in the bottle of Jack,
my thoughts grasping for the reason among the
fog. First, I only saw the vaguest shape, scarcely
anything more than a shade drifting in and out of
my consciousness. But, this imposition would not
pass, and I came to recognize the sparkle of a
rhinestone bedazzling a Juicy Couture sweat jack
et. Eventually, I surmised the form of the thing,
and that it was, verily, the Muse I indulgently in
voked.

Her sweat suit was what the good people at
Crayola call tickle-me-pink, and recently high
lighted tresses framed a face with all the usual
signs of middle age. She let out the kind of emphy
semic cough associated with smokers, and I no
ticed a bit of coral lipstick smudged on her snag
gletooth before she began her reply.
"Yes, we got your paperwork last week," she
told me, as she held up Form 148 and slid it across
the counter. "The gods are on a Carnival Cruise to
Cancun for the next two weeks, but they laughed
out loud when they read your application." The
red "Rejected" printed on the top had already
told me as much.

This insult was too much to bear, and I coun
tered with a barrage of questions. For what rea
sons would my country be any less qualified than
those of the past? What inane criteria could she be

using? I rattled off a 1,000 narrative possibilities
that, if only deigned worthy by her bureaucracy,
could seed a mighty epic. What fault did she find
with my original proposal, a poetic treatment of
the Twelve Labors of Barack Obama?

"Let's see: health care, stimulus, Iran, Ameri
ca's apology tour, Guantanamo, Gates-gate, glob
al warming... you only listed seven," she retort
ed.

Well, I could not afford 12 in this economy. So
picky, surely the gods must understand my strug
gle. She also replied that such an underwhelming
plotline contradicted his character development.
The hero was more likely to do 14, and would
have Peter Orzsag provide some graphico-statis
tical basis for how this would bend the cost curve.
Well, touch?.
Alas, they found my medium of choice equal
ly comic. I had chosen a new style for a new cen
tury, and besides, dactylic hexameter is so clich?.
But, evidently, three-minute You Tube videos
strung together haphazardly don't fit their pre
conceived notions of art. Go figure. I was even
going to use one of those "Edward and Bella"
tribute videos set to a Celine Dion song.
Heartbroken, I resolved that this task must be
completed with or without the help of the deities.
If the Muses are unwilling, let the Muses be
damned.

For days, I penned nothing more than a bro
ken phrase here and there, unable to articulate
what exactly I longed to say. Even the proverbial
orange mocha frappuccino was not satisfying, and
I desired nothing more than to forget it all. Cun
ning Fate let me anguish until, at length, I found
my way.

Strabo, an ancient geographer, once wrote
about the history of the Roman people. His con-

temporaries frequently argued that Rome was
particularly disposed to become a great city be
cause of the natural advantages of its location.
This was patently false, and Strabo identified that
the very disadvantage of the Roman position
within the world gave their people a heartier spir
it. Later, an American poet, Kanye West, argued
the same thing in his masterpiece, "Stronger." By
this logic, among all the prosperous cities dotting
the American coasts, I searched for the least
beautiful and, on Fran Drescher's advice, came to
find myself in New Jersey. MTV already was
camped out and taping a new reality show, but I
was still able to find a smorgasbord of human de
generacy among the leftovers. There were girls
unable to stay sober for long enough to leave in
this veritable Hotel California, and men wearing
enough cologne to kill a small woodland crea
ture, They all cried forth to a single overworked
bartender for Jagerbombs. Their unified dedica
tion proved either touching or horrifying. At this
point, the common refrain that "everyone de
serves to have their voice heard" never seemed
so counter-intuitive. This, I now see, was the bur
den of the every-man American hero: to ac
cept and embrace the grandparent who still
thinks Nixon was the best President as hav
ing the same vote as you.

Emily, as a truly great artist, would like to tell
you to burn this as her last request, but secretly
hopes you'll publish it posthumously. Choose
