## ASSU Appropriations Committee: Reform needed 
### â€“ Tommy Tobin '10 is a a member of the ASSU Constitutional Council the Director of the Stanford Pro ject on Hunger 
I write today as the Director of the Stanford
Project on Hunger (SPOON), a campus
organization salvaging unused food from
campus for the local homeless.
During the past year, I have been told on
the floor of the Senate that it is not a "soup
kitchen where groups can come back again
and again for more money." Not only are these
comments inappropriate (especially since
SPOON helps feed the local homeless), they
represent a regrettable view about funding
policies and transparency in our student gov
ernment.

The ASSU Undergraduate Senate has not
been supportive. Throughout the year, I have
lobbied the Senate and other ASSU bodies to
release their meeting minutes, post their fund
ing policies online and hold the Appropriation
Committee accountable for contradictory
policies and statements.
My interest in the subject of funding poli
cies began when two members of our group
attempted to receive funding to attend a con
ference with monies drawn from SPOON's
reserves earlier this year. I submitted my ap
plication, talked with my advisors in the Haas
Center and Student Activities and Leader
ship, emailed the Cap Group Funding Direc
tor and the Appropriations Committee Chair
man about my plan to attend the conference
and the means by which our group hoped to
pay for it. Not only did our group need to wait
three weeks for an interview, I only learned of
relevant policies at the Appropriations Com
mittee hearing. Something was up.
When I attended a Senate meeting to re
quest additional funding, I was told two inter
esting bits of information. First, the Senate did
not want to set a precedent to have "Financial
Officers come here and request more money."
Second, during an Appropriations Committee
report, the Chairman said his Committee had
accepted only 33% of groups' requests for
funds. In 2008-2009, that figure was over 70%.
While that number was surprising, more
shocking was the comment added afterwards,

"This means we are doing our jobs right." This
Appropriations Committee was not focused
on enabling programming on campus, but in
stead blocking it.
I began to follow the process much more
closely. I joined the ASSU Senate email list
and found that a "Special Fees Funding Poli
cies Review Session" was going to occur soon.
I was personally invited to the "Review Ses
sion." The document that came out of the
meeting was sped through the Undergradu
ate Senate, bypassing normal week-long pub
lic comment periods. When I inquired as to
why, I was informed that this Review Session
was an "official meeting" of the ASSU Ap
propriations Committee and announced as
such over the "public" Appropriations email
list. So, I joined the email list immediately.
Next, I obtained the agendas for the entire
year as documents of the Senate and its Com
mittees are public records. From my analysis, it
seemed that my group was not alone in lack
ing knowledge of these policies. The agendas
of the Appropriations Committee are riddled
with comments urging student groups to
"READ THE POLICIES."
Indeed, the meeting agendas, records of
the groups to be interviewed at an Appropria
tions Committee meeting and comments by
the Chair regarding the groups' requests paint
a peculiar portrait, with entries such as:
"Night Outreach to the Homeless- Not a
Community Service Group"
"Does Men's Club Soccer really need new
socks for returning members?"
Dragon Boat: Those "paddles seem like
part of a costume"
"UNICEF: READ THE POLICIES"
"BentSPOON Dance Company: READ
THE POLICIES"
January 29th was a particularly interesting
day in the life of the Appropriations Commit
tee. It interviewed the Family Resource Desk,
a service group helping patients navigate re
source materials. The agenda item: "Family
Resource Desk: Go away. More detail." The

Committee also interviewed the Stanford
African Student Association. Agenda read:
"GO AWAY! Itemize. Details. Why wasn't
this initially budgeted?" For the Pre-Law So
ciety, it was a similar story, with the agenda
reading, "Stanford Pre-Law Society: Go away.
Itemize your request by line-items."
Additionally, the Appropriations Commit
tee directly contradicted their own policies.
Interviewing the Black Student Union on Jan
uary Bth and the 29th, the Committee worked
with the BSU to create a budget plan for the
Black History Month series of events. While I
appreciate the great work of the BSU, I resent
the Committee's action at a recent Senate
meeting. The Financial Officer of the BSU
came to argue for $l,OOO of additional funding
and was granted this money after making her
case on the Senate floor. Harkening back to
my own experience, I was deeply surprised
that the Committee had bent the rules so
much for this group's request for ten-times the
amount I had requested earlier this year.
