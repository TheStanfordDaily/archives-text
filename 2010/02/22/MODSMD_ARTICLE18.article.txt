## ROAD TO VICTORY Men's basketball gets first conference road wins 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When it comes to playing on the road, the
Cardinal saved its best for last.

After losing its first 10 road games of the
season, Stanford (13-14,7-8 Pac-10) earned its
first sweep on the road since 2008 with a solid
65-55 victory over Oregon State (12-14, 6-8
Pac-10) Saturday.

The Cardinal was led by a balanced attack,
getting 16 points from senior wing Landry
Fields, 15 from sophomore guard Jeremy
Green and 11 from sophomore center Jack
Trotter. Plead coach Johnny Dawkins' squad
was also aided by timely shooting from three
point range (9-18) and the free-throw line (10-
13), highlighted by senior point guard Drew
Shiller's three three-pointers, which helped
the Cardinal pull away from the Beavers in the
second half.

"It was just a huge win for us," Shiller said.
"This was a big weekend for us; we knew we
could win both [games] if we played well. For
us to sneak both on the road is a huge momen
tum boost."

Stanford's defense also played an impor
tant role in the win as the Cardinal held Ore
gon State to just 41 percent shooting. The per
formance may not have been as impressive as
holding the Beavers to 35 points as the Car-

dinal did in the first meeting between the
squads but Dawkins was still pleased.
"I thought we did a great job of defending,"
he said. "Our guys really focused in."
There were multiple lead changes through
out the first half before the Beavers took a 30-
28 lead going into the locker room. Stanford
would buckle down in the second half, howev
er, claiming a 41-38 lead after a three-pointer
