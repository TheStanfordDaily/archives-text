## ROAD TO VICTORY Men's basketball gets first conference road wins 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When it comes to playing on the road, the
Cardinal saved its best for last.

After losing its first 10 road games of the
season, Stanford (13-14,7-8 Pac-10) earned its
first sweep on the road since 2008 with a solid
65-55 victory over Oregon State (12-14, 6-8
Pac-10) Saturday.

The Cardinal was led by a balanced attack,
getting 16 points from senior wing Landry
Fields, 15 from sophomore guard Jeremy
Green and 11 from sophomore center Jack
Trotter. Plead coach Johnny Dawkins' squad
was also aided by timely shooting from three
point range (9-18) and the free-throw line (10-
13), highlighted by senior point guard Drew
Shiller's three three-pointers, which helped
the Cardinal pull away from the Beavers in the
second half.

"It was just a huge win for us," Shiller said.
"This was a big weekend for us; we knew we
could win both [games] if we played well. For
us to sneak both on the road is a huge momen
tum boost."

Stanford's defense also played an impor
tant role in the win as the Cardinal held Ore
gon State to just 41 percent shooting. The per
formance may not have been as impressive as
holding the Beavers to 35 points as the Car-

dinal did in the first meeting between the
squads but Dawkins was still pleased.
"I thought we did a great job of defending,"
he said. "Our guys really focused in."
There were multiple lead changes through
out the first half before the Beavers took a 30-
28 lead going into the locker room. Stanford
would buckle down in the second half, howev
er, claiming a 41-38 lead after a three-pointer

GAME NOTES ! After winning its first conference road games this sea
son against Oregon and Oregon State last week, Stanford returns
home to take on the Sun Devils. The Cardinal, led by senior forward
Landry Fields's 22.2 point per game, are looking to reach the .500
mark in conference play for the first time in nearly a month, while the
Sun Devils, who are a half-game behind California in the Pac-10
standings, are looking to take the conference lead.

by Green at the 15-minute mark.The
Cardinal would never trail again.
A Shiller three-pointer with just
under five minutes to go made the
score 59-50, effectively putting the
game out of reach. Shiller was key in
the Cardinal's victory for the second
straight game, hitting big shots at im
portant points throughout the sec
ond half.
"I don't feel like I'm pressing, I'm
just letting the game come to me,"
the senior said in regard to his recent
production on offense.
Also notable was Fields' per
formance though, by his standards,
he struggled on offense for much of
Saturday's contest. Fields still man
aged to lead his team in scoring, and
he filled the box score as much as any
forward can with 11 rebounds, six as
sists and three blocks.
"Landry Fields had six assists and
no turnovers," Shiller said. "If that's
considered an off-night, then I'd like
to be in his shoes."
Dawkins also had nothing but
praise for his senior star.
"I think you see a kid who's play
ing inspired," he said. "He wants to
do everything in his power to give us
a successful season, so I'm just very
proud of his development."
Stanford had little trouble with
Oregon State's 1-3-1 zone, as
Beavers' head coach Craig Robin
son eventually pulled back the de
fense for much of the second half.
Shiller attributed the Cardinal's suc
cess to experience with the defense.
"I think a big help was that we
played them four times last year," he

said. "You can simulate it in practice
but going out there against it really
helps. We are very experienced with
it and know exactly how to beat it.
We took them out of it."

The weekend sweep over the
Ducks and Beavers puts the Cardi
nal in a much more favorable posi
tion than it was going into the week
end, as it will most likely not have to
compete in the play-in round of the
Pac-10 Tournament (the eighth and
ninth place teams will compete for
the eighth spot).
Most importantly, though, the
Cardinal was able to exorcise the

road demons which have haunted
the team all season. Stanford will un

doubtedly be able to breathe a bit
easier after getting the road monkey
off its back.

That relief came at just the right
time, as the team has a chance to fin
ish the season with at least a .500
record in conference play now. The
task will not be easy, though, as the
Cardinal finishes its regular season
off at home against three of the con
ference's top five teams: Arizona
State, Arizona and archrival Cal.
Tip off against Arizona State will
take place at 7 p.m. on Thursday at
Maples Pavilion.

GAME NOTES ! After winning its first conference road games this sea
son against Oregon and Oregon State last week, Stanford returns
home to take on the Sun Devils. The Cardinal, led by senior forward
Landry Fields's 22.2 point per game, are looking to reach the .500
mark in conference play for the first time in nearly a month, while the
Sun Devils, who are a half-game behind California in the Pac-10
standings, are looking to take the conference lead.

Drew Shiller leads the Cardinal on a fast break. Shiller shot 54 percent from 3-point range in
the Cardinal's first Pac-10 road wins of the season against Oregon and Oregon State last week.
by Green at the 15-minute mark.The
Cardinal would never trail again.
A Shiller three-pointer with just
under five minutes to go made the
score 59-50, effectively putting the
game out of reach. Shiller was key in
the Cardinal's victory for the second
straight game, hitting big shots at im
portant points throughout the sec
ond half.
"I don't feel like I'm pressing, I'm
just letting the game come to me,"
the senior said in regard to his recent
production on offense.
Also notable was Fields' per
formance though, by his standards,
he struggled on offense for much of
Saturday's contest. Fields still man
aged to lead his team in scoring, and
he filled the box score as much as any
forward can with 11 rebounds, six as
sists and three blocks.
"Landry Fields had six assists and
no turnovers," Shiller said. "If that's
considered an off-night, then I'd like
to be in his shoes."
Dawkins also had nothing but
praise for his senior star.
"I think you see a kid who's play
ing inspired," he said. "He wants to
do everything in his power to give us
a successful season, so I'm just very
proud of his development."
Stanford had little trouble with
Oregon State's 1-3-1 zone, as
Beavers' head coach Craig Robin
son eventually pulled back the de
fense for much of the second half.
Shiller attributed the Cardinal's suc
cess to experience with the defense.
"I think a big help was that we
played them four times last year," he

said. "You can simulate it in practice
but going out there against it really
helps. We are very experienced with
it and know exactly how to beat it.
We took them out of it."

The weekend sweep over the
Ducks and Beavers puts the Cardi
nal in a much more favorable posi
tion than it was going into the week
end, as it will most likely not have to
compete in the play-in round of the
Pac-10 Tournament (the eighth and
ninth place teams will compete for
the eighth spot).
Most importantly, though, the
Cardinal was able to exorcise the

road demons which have haunted
the team all season. Stanford will un

doubtedly be able to breathe a bit
easier after getting the road monkey
off its back.

That relief came at just the right
time, as the team has a chance to fin
ish the season with at least a .500
record in conference play now. The
task will not be easy, though, as the
Cardinal finishes its regular season
off at home against three of the con
ference's top five teams: Arizona
State, Arizona and archrival Cal.
Tip off against Arizona State will
take place at 7 p.m. on Thursday at
Maples Pavilion.
