## Card upsets Rice to open season 
### JACOB JAFFE MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 25 Stanford baseball team started its
season off strong, sweeping No. 5 Rice in a three
game series at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal (3-0 ) is coming off a disappointing
2009 season in which Stanford missed the playoffs
entirely, while the Owls lost to eventual national
champion LSU in last year's Super Regionals. De
spite losing its top home run hitter (Brent
Milleville), top run scorer (Toby Gerhart) and top
pitcher (Drew Storen) from last season to gradua

tion or professional sports, Stanford has reason to
be optimistic about this year's squad. Much of this
optimism comes from the incoming freshman class,
which Baseball America rated as the second-best
in the nation.
These freshmen made a big impact, as center
fielder Jake Stewart, left fielder Stephen Piscotty
and third baseman Kenny Diekroeger all started
the entire series for Stanford.
On Friday, the Cardinal fell behind early when
Rice's second baseman Michael Ratterree led off
the season with a home run off Stanford sopho
more pitcher Jordan Pries. Pries allowed five of the

first eight hitters to reach base, but avoided any fur
ther damage in the first few innings. The Cardinal
offense gained the lead quickly, scoring on a field
er's choice and RBI singles by junior first baseman
Jonathan Kaskow and junior shortstop Jake Sch
lander to go up 3-1 in the third inning.
Pries pitched well the rest of the way, allowing
just three unearned runs off two Schlander errors
while pitching into the eighth inning. These errors
were extremely uncharacteristic, as Schlander was
last year's Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year.
