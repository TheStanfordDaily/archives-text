## Card upsets Rice to open season 
### JACOB JAFFE MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 25 Stanford baseball team started its
season off strong, sweeping No. 5 Rice in a three
game series at Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal (3-0 ) is coming off a disappointing
2009 season in which Stanford missed the playoffs
entirely, while the Owls lost to eventual national
champion LSU in last year's Super Regionals. De
spite losing its top home run hitter (Brent
Milleville), top run scorer (Toby Gerhart) and top
pitcher (Drew Storen) from last season to gradua

tion or professional sports, Stanford has reason to
be optimistic about this year's squad. Much of this
optimism comes from the incoming freshman class,
which Baseball America rated as the second-best
in the nation.
These freshmen made a big impact, as center
fielder Jake Stewart, left fielder Stephen Piscotty
and third baseman Kenny Diekroeger all started
the entire series for Stanford.
On Friday, the Cardinal fell behind early when
Rice's second baseman Michael Ratterree led off
the season with a home run off Stanford sopho
more pitcher Jordan Pries. Pries allowed five of the

first eight hitters to reach base, but avoided any fur
ther damage in the first few innings. The Cardinal
offense gained the lead quickly, scoring on a field
er's choice and RBI singles by junior first baseman
Jonathan Kaskow and junior shortstop Jake Sch
lander to go up 3-1 in the third inning.
Pries pitched well the rest of the way, allowing
just three unearned runs off two Schlander errors
while pitching into the eighth inning. These errors
were extremely uncharacteristic, as Schlander was
last year's Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year.
Stanford opened up its lead in the
seventh inning when junior catcher
Zach Jones connected for a solo home
run, followed by an RBI double by
Kaskow.
With the score 6-2, Rice's left field
er Michael Fuda hit a two-run homer
in the eighth to cut the lead in half, but
junior reliever Alex Pracher came in
and retired the last four hitters to
clinch the Cardinal win, 6-4. Piscotty
led Stanford with three hits and three
runs scored in his first collegiate
game.
The Sunday forecast called for
rain, so Sunday's game was moved to
be a Saturday doubleheader.
The first game was a tight one
early, as Stanford sophomore Scott
Snodgress and Rice's Jared Rogers
and Boogie Anagnostou combined
for a pitcher's duel in the early in
nings. A two-run homer by Stanford
sophomore designated hitter Christ
ian Griffiths in the second inning was
the big blow of the early goings, and
the score was 2-1 after six innings.
In the seventh, Ratterree connect
ed for his second home run in as many
games, a three-run shot off junior re
liever Danny Sandbrink that gave
Rice the lead for the first time that
day at 4-2.
Despite this blow, the seventh in
ning belonged to the Cardinal of
fense. Stanford sent 17 men to the
plate, scoring 11 times in the seventh
as Rice was forced to use five pitchers
to get out of the inning. Even with all

these runs, the Cardinal did not hit a
home run in the inning.
Instead, Stanford scored in nearly
every other way possible. In the in
ning, Cardinal batters had five dou
bles, three singles, four walks and a
triple, while capitalizing on three Rice
errors.
With the score 13-4, both teams
got a chance to give playing time to
their bench players. Each team tacked
on a run in the eighth and Sandbrink
closed out the win in the ninth with
the final score 14-5.
Eight different Cardinal batters

recorded an RBI and 11 recorded a
hit, but no batter had more than two
of either, making the win a truly team
effort.

Just 45 minutes after the final out,
the two teams were back at it again.
The second game of the doublehead
er had a much tighter feel from the
beginning.
Stanford sophomore starter Brett
Mooneyham had a nightmare of a
first inning. Mooneyham walked five
of the first six batters he faced, but
thanks to a double play and an inning
ending strikeout, he only gave up one

run in the inning.
The Cardinal responded on of
fense, scoring five consecutive runs to
go up 5-1. Kaskow knocked in a pair
of runs with a sacrifice fly and a bases
loaded walk in consecutive innings,
while junior right fielder Kellen Kiils
gaard also knocked in two without a
hit, using a bases-loaded hit-by-pitch
and a sacrifice fly. Piscotty chipped in
with an RBI single.
Both teams faced control prob
lems throughout the game, as home
plate umpire Billy Haze maintained a
tight strike zone. Cardinal pitchers'
control problems caught up to them
in the sixth, when two Owls scored on
bases-loaded walks, and an RBI sin
gle by center fielder Steven
Sultzbaugh brought Rice to within
one at 5-4.

Rice's designated hitter Diego
Seastrunk tied the game in the eighth
with a two-out RBI single.

With a runner on first and two outs
in the ninth, Rice 's Michael Fuda hit a
deep fly ball into the alley in right
center field. Junior right fielder Dave
Giuliani, who entered the game as a
defensive replacement, took a risk
and dove to catch it instead of cutting
it off. He missed the ball, which rolled
all the way to the wall, and Rice took
the late lead 6-5 on the RBI triple.
Stanford looked to be on the verge
of its first defeat of the season as rain
began to descend on Klein Field at
Sunken Diamond. The Cardinal's
first two hitters of the ninth were re
tired quickly by Owl reliever Abe
Gonzales.

Freshman Tyler Gaffney a run
ning back on the football team as well
as an outfielder on the baseball team
kept Stanford alive when Gonza
les hit him in the foot with a pitch. Se
nior pinch hitter Adam Gaylord
moved Gaffney to third with a solid
single to left. Gaylord was then re
placed with a pinch runner, junior
Kellen McColl. McColl immediately
took a risk, stealing second base by a
very small margin.

With two on and two out and Stan
ford trailing by one in the ninth, the
game rested on the shoulders of
Diekroeger, who was highly touted
out of high school after being drafted
in the second round of the MLB Draft
by Tampa Bay. Diekroeger, who had
been 0-4 in the game, came through
with a deep fly ball that hit off the right
field wall over Owl right fielder Chad
Mozingo's glove to score Gaffney and
McColl and give Stanford the dramat
ic walk-off win, 7-6.
