GAME NOTES ! After an emotionally charged win on Senior
Night against the Beavers, Stanford looks to continue its
conference dominance against the Sun Devils. In the game
against Oregon State, senior center Jayne Appel became
the third player in program history to reach 2,000 career
points and 1,000 career rebounds. Fellow senior, guard
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude contributed eight points in the win
ning effort as the Cardinal close in on postseason play.

center Jayne Appel added 13 and 12
of their own, respectively.

The Cardinal started where it left
off on Thursday, with Appel scoring
just 15 seconds from tip-off and the
team running out to an 11-0 lead with
15:39 left in the half. With 10 minutes
gone Appel netted a layup to break
through the career 2,000-point mark,
joining the privileged company of
Nicole Powell and Val Whiting as
only the third Cardinal player to
have both 2,000 points and 1,000 re
bounds.

The fast start seemed to inspire a
lot of confidence in the Stanford
women. Quick, accurate passes and a
lot of movement allowed them to get
around and inside the Beaver de
fense, At times this play came un
done Ogwumike was called for
traveling with a clear lane to the bas
ket, and some looping passes went
straight to the opposition but the
final outcome never really looked in
doubt.

for me," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "1 thought we could've
been more aggressive on the Offfen
sivej-boards."
ft was exactly the opposite for
OSU. Since the opening game of the
Pac-10 conference it has not won a
single contest, posting a 14-game los
ing streak, which must have sapped
the confidence of coach and players.
For five of the Cardinal's players
Appel, Gold-Onwude, redshirt
junior forward Michelle Harrison,
redshirt junior guard Melanie Mur
phy and redshirt junior guard JJ
Hones this was Senior Night, and
the dominant first few minutes al
lowed VanDerveer to play even the
non-starters in this group early on.
With her first shot, Harrison scored a
nothing-but-net three-pointer from
the corner of the court and, by game's
end, all five would be on the score
sheet in what could be their last regu
lar-season home game in Maples.
This group took the floor together
early in the second half as Stanford
maintained its halftime lead of 46-21.
The last time these two teams met,
Stanford struggled to build a signifi
cant lead in the first half as the
Beavers stood tall on defense, and

the Cardinal had just a 29-27 lead at
halftime. The scoring was more even
to start the second half on Saturday,
with both teams putting up 13 points
in the first eight minutes of the half to
make it 59-34. Palmer was the top
scorer of the game for the Beavers
with 16 points, but, with none of her
fellow players making double figures,
the 20-plus point gap could not be
closed.
While the Cardinal women were
not exactly running away with the
game to open the second half, Van-
Derveer was pleased with their abili
ty to play solid basketball and main
tain the lead.

"One of the goals I had in this
game was to be able to play our five
(Class of 2010) players, and we were
able to do that for a little bit," she
said. "I think in some ways that
might've thrown us a little bit out of
our rhythm, it was a different substi
tution pattern, but I know that Nneka
and Kayla [Pedersen] and Jeanette
are flexible, and they were happy to
see Michelle and JJ come in."

Towards the end of half, Van-
Derveer began to move even deeper
into her bench, as sophomore guards
Lindy La Rocque and Grace
Mashore earned eight and four min
utes, respectively. The duo teamed up
for one of the more thrilling plays of
the game, as La Rocque flung a one
arm, midair pass under the basket to
Mashore, who launched a nothing
but-net three-pointer from deep in
the corner to electrify the crowd.
Mashore added a fast break lay-up as
time wound down a few moments
later, giving Stanford its final touch of
offense at home this season.
With the win Stanford's 19th
straight against Oregon State and its
44th straight at home the Cardinal
clinches a share of its 10th regular
season conference championship in
as many years. Though the second
place UCLA Bruins (18-7, 11-3)
cruised past Washington State 93-58
earlier in the day to remain mathe
matically eligible for a possible tie in
the standings, Stanford already se
cured the No.l seed in the Pac-10
tournament, having swept the Bru
ins.
Given her team's recent hot
streak, VanDerveer is optimistic
about Stanford's chances in the post
season.
"I think we're playing our best
basketball... We're playing our best
when it counts," she said. "This week
end, we've been playing well. We had

a little lull through January, I think
we picked it up through February
and I think the time to be playing
your best is March, so we're looking
forward to March."

While VanDerveer and her play
ers are no doubt pleased with the vic
tory, Saturday's Senior Night contest
also carried a somewhat bittersweet
tone, as some of the Cardinal squad
bid farewell to the friendly confines
of Maples Pavilion, at least until the
postseason. Appel and Gold-On
wude are certainly graduating and
moving on, but the future for the red
shirt juniors is less certain. All five
were honored in an on-court ceremo
ny following the game,
"Today's game, and this whole
weekend, have been about looking
back at the great things our seniors
have accomplished," VanDerveer
said. "The night was about our sen
iors, and what great seniors we have.
Two of them are here sitting next to
me, and for Ros and Jayne it's just
gone really fast, and they're really ex
ceptional young women ... It's so
unreal to me that Ros and Jayne are
really graduating ... I know Ros and
Jayne will be moving on, and we'll
miss them terribly."
In a fairly emotional post-game
conference, Appel and Gold-On
wude shared what they would each
like to leave behind as a legacy.
"I think the main thing is about
team chemistry," Appel said. "I'd like
to be remembered along with the rest
of the senior class for having good
team chemistry each year and build
ing on that, and I think that's some
thing that's really grown since my
freshman year."
"I've been at many different
points at my career here at Stanford,
and now, as a fifth-year, I'm much
more mature," Gold-Onwude added.
"I'm on my way out with different
motivations and incentives. I just
hope all the underclassmen, especial
ly those that have struggled... can
know that this basketball thing is
beautiful, and Stanford basketball es
pecially is amazing. Everybody's role
is really important, and we literally
can't go anywhere without everyone
contributing."
Stanford will hit the court again
next Thursday at Arizona State, when
the team will take on the Sun Devils
at 6 p.m.

fellow players making double figures,
the 20-plus point gap could not be
closed.
While the Cardinal women were
not exactly running away with the
game to open the second half, Van-
Derveer was pleased with their abili
ty to play solid basketball and main
tain the lead.

"One of the goals I had in this
game was to be able to play our five
(Class of 2010) players, and we were
able to do that for a little bit," she
said. "I think in some ways that
might've thrown us a little bit out of
our rhythm, it was a different substi
tution pattern, but I know that Nneka
and Kayla [Pedersen] and Jeanette
are flexible, and they were happy to
see Michelle and JJ come in."

Towards the end of half, Van-
Derveer began to move even deeper
into her bench, as sophomore guards
Lindy La Rocque and Grace
Mashore earned eight and four min
utes, respectively. The duo teamed up
for one of the more thrilling plays of
the game, as La Rocque flung a one
arm, midair pass under the basket to
Mashore, who launched a nothing
but-net three-pointer from deep in
the corner to electrify the crowd.
Mashore added a fast break lay-up as
time wound down a few moments
later, giving Stanford its final touch of
offense at home this season.
With the win Stanford's 19th
straight against Oregon State and its
44th straight at home the Cardinal
clinches a share of its 10th regular
season conference championship in
as many years. Though the second
place UCLA Bruins (18-7, 11-3)
cruised past Washington State 93-58
earlier in the day to remain mathe
matically eligible for a possible tie in
the standings, Stanford already se
cured the No.l seed in the Pac-10
tournament, having swept the Bru
ins.
Given her team's recent hot
streak, VanDerveer is optimistic
about Stanford's chances in the post
season.
"I think we're playing our best
basketball... We're playing our best
when it counts," she said. "This week
end, we've been playing well. We had

a little lull through January, I think
we picked it up through February
and I think the time to be playing
your best is March, so we're looking
forward to March."

While VanDerveer and her play
ers are no doubt pleased with the vic
tory, Saturday's Senior Night contest
also carried a somewhat bittersweet
tone, as some of the Cardinal squad
bid farewell to the friendly confines
of Maples Pavilion, at least until the
postseason. Appel and Gold-On
wude are certainly graduating and
moving on, but the future for the red
shirt juniors is less certain. All five
were honored in an on-court ceremo
ny following the game,
"Today's game, and this whole
weekend, have been about looking
back at the great things our seniors
have accomplished," VanDerveer
said. "The night was about our sen
iors, and what great seniors we have.
Two of them are here sitting next to
me, and for Ros and Jayne it's just
gone really fast, and they're really ex
ceptional young women ... It's so
unreal to me that Ros and Jayne are
really graduating ... I know Ros and
Jayne will be moving on, and we'll
miss them terribly."
In a fairly emotional post-game
conference, Appel and Gold-On
wude shared what they would each
like to leave behind as a legacy.
"I think the main thing is about
team chemistry," Appel said. "I'd like
to be remembered along with the rest
of the senior class for having good
team chemistry each year and build
ing on that, and I think that's some
thing that's really grown since my
freshman year."
"I've been at many different
points at my career here at Stanford,
and now, as a fifth-year, I'm much
more mature," Gold-Onwude added.
"I'm on my way out with different
motivations and incentives. I just
hope all the underclassmen, especial
ly those that have struggled... can
know that this basketball thing is
beautiful, and Stanford basketball es
pecially is amazing. Everybody's role
is really important, and we literally
can't go anywhere without everyone
contributing."
Stanford will hit the court again
next Thursday at Arizona State, when
the team will take on the Sun Devils
at 6 p.m.

In their last regular season game at home, the
Cardinal women certainly gave their fans some

final score of 82-48, earning a share of its 10th con

GAME NOTES ! After an emotionally charged win on Senior
Night against the Beavers, Stanford looks to continue its
conference dominance against the Sun Devils. In the game
against Oregon State, senior center Jayne Appel became
the third player in program history to reach 2,000 career
points and 1,000 career rebounds. Fellow senior, guard
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude contributed eight points in the win
ning effort as the Cardinal close in on postseason play.

center Jayne Appel added 13 and 12
of their own, respectively.

The Cardinal started where it left
off on Thursday, with Appel scoring
just 15 seconds from tip-off and the
team running out to an 11-0 lead with
15:39 left in the half. With 10 minutes
gone Appel netted a layup to break
through the career 2,000-point mark,
joining the privileged company of
Nicole Powell and Val Whiting as
only the third Cardinal player to
have both 2,000 points and 1,000 re
bounds.

The fast start seemed to inspire a
lot of confidence in the Stanford
women. Quick, accurate passes and a
lot of movement allowed them to get
around and inside the Beaver de
fense, At times this play came un
done Ogwumike was called for
traveling with a clear lane to the bas
ket, and some looping passes went
straight to the opposition but the
final outcome never really looked in
doubt.

turned the ball over a little too much
for me," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "1 thought we could've
been more aggressive on the Offfen
sivej-boards."

OSU. Since the opening game of the
Pac-10 conference it has not won a
single contest, posting a 14-game los
ing streak, which must have sapped
the confidence of coach and players.
For five of the Cardinal's players
Appel, Gold-Onwude, redshirt
junior forward Michelle Harrison,
redshirt junior guard Melanie Mur
phy and redshirt junior guard JJ
Hones this was Senior Night, and
the dominant first few minutes al
lowed VanDerveer to play even the
non-starters in this group early on.
With her first shot, Harrison scored a
nothing-but-net three-pointer from
the corner of the court and, by game's
end, all five would be on the score
sheet in what could be their last regu
lar-season home game in Maples.
This group took the floor together
early in the second half as Stanford
maintained its halftime lead of 46-21.
The last time these two teams met,
Stanford struggled to build a signifi
cant lead in the first half as the
Beavers stood tall on defense, and

the Cardinal had just a 29-27 lead at
halftime. The scoring was more even
to start the second half on Saturday,
with both teams putting up 13 points
in the first eight minutes of the half to
make it 59-34. Palmer was the top
scorer of the game for the Beavers
with 16 points, but, with none of her
fellow players making double figures,
the 20-plus point gap could not be
closed.
