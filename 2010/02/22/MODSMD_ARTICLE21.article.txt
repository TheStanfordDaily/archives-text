# To quad or not to quad?
## 
### Jane LePham 
Every four years, my world
stops for the Winter Olympic
Games. And since I was a lit
tle girl, I've followed the
same schedule for the two
week duration of the Games: wake up,
go to school, train for countless hours at
the rink, go home, do homework and
then watch anxiously as the world's top
athletes competed for medals and
glory in the sports to which they've
dedicated their entire lives.
I used to be a competitive figure
skater, and like many of the girls I
trained with, dreamed that I would one
day be able to don the Team USA jack
et and represent the United States on
Olympic ice. Although my Olympic
dreams officially ended when I quit the
sport five years ago, my enthusiasm for
the Games hasn't dwindled in the least;
last Thursday was no different.
On Thursday night, I rushed
through an econ problem set, clutched
my roommate's hand and waited with
bated breath, as I watched the men's
long program a four-and-a-half
minute test of strength, endurance and
sheer willpower —as figure skating
crowned its new men's Olympic cham
pion.

Perhaps what made this event espe
cially remarkable, aside from the un
predictability of a sport whose out
come is determined by judges and the
skaters' quarter-inch blades, was the
talent of the competition, the deepest
and most talented field of men in re
cent Olympic history. In the months
leading up to the Games, men's figure
skating saw the surprise reemergence
of Russian Evgeni Plushenko, the 2006
Olympic champion, who returned
from a three-year retirement solely to
defend his Olympic title, as well as the
return of Stephane Lambiel, the 2006
Olympic silver medalist. With a strong
Japanese contingent, an outstanding
American team led by 2009 world
champion Evan Lysacek and Canadi
an gold-medal hopeful Patrick Chan,
the list of medal contenders could be
categorized into two distinct groups
veterans from an era past and the
sport's current world medalists.
At the end of Tuesday's short pro
gram, it was clear that the Olympic
champion would be crowned in a
showdown between Plushenko and
Lysacek in the long program be
tween a quadruple jump and no
quadruple jump, between old jumping
styles and new artistry. Lysacek skated
first in the final group and, despite the
lack of a quad on his program compo
nents sheet, turned in what was per
haps the performance of his life. While
he lacked a quad, he more than made
up for it with strong spins, eight triple
jumps and spectacular choreography.
An hour later, Plushenko took the
ice as the final skater of the men's com
petition. Surely enough, the first jump
of his performance was a quadruple
triple combination, and Plushenko
landed it with ease and command.
However, his program seemed to
reach its apex with that quad, as the
Russian fought for landings on several
of his triple jumps—jumps that he
normally could have landed in his sleep
and displayed markedly slow spins.
Although his performance was charac
terized by several hip thrusts, as enter
taining as they were to watch, his cho
reography just did not match
Lysacek's, which bled with emotion.
By the time Plushenko finished his
performance, he certainly thought he
had done enough to win the gold
medal. The figure skating world, the
viewing audience, Evan and I collec
tively held our breaths to see if

Plushenko, who held less than a one
point lead after the short program, had
done enough to defend his Olympic
title. After perhaps the longest minute
in both of these skaters' lives, the
judges announced the scores
Lysacek had won by 1.31 points.

sliver medalist to

Evan Lysacek

I screamed out of happiness as
Evan himself jumped for joy on the
screen in front of me. But, as soon as the
gold medal was draped over Evan's
neck, Plushenko resumed his trash
talking once again, saying that he de
served to win and questioning how one
could become an Olympic champion
without a quad in his repertoire.
It seems that Evan's victory has
been somewhat marred by this contro
versy: did he deserve to win without a
quad? Elvis Stojko, the 1994 and 1998
Olympic silver medalist and the first
man to land a quad in combination,
weighed in on this debate, as did Russ
ian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,
who I never knew was an expert on fig
ure skating. Both men (perhaps one
with more credibility and knowledge
than the other) agreed with Plushenko.
In an article for Yahoo! Sports, Sto
jko characterized last Thursday as "the
night they killed figure skating," criti
cizing the newly crowned Olympic
champion's lack of a quadruple jump,
as well as the judges' scoring of the
competition. "You're a great skater
and all," Stojko told Lysacek, "but that
wasn't Olympic champion material."
While I respect Plushenko tremen
dously for coming out of retirement
and still being able to land quads, his
skating was off on Thursday night. And

even with the quad, his technique or
at least the technique we saw in his long
program, which was sub-par compared
to what he has done in the past —just
didn't compare to Lysacek's. While
Stojko argued that Plushenko should
have won because he didn't make any
mistakes, I disagree Plushenko did
make mistakes. He might not have fall
en, but the small bobbles and awkward
jump landings added up.

Plushenko whined about how
Lysacek won based on his footwork
and presentation, calling Thursday
night's competition "ice dancing, not
men's figure skating," but the judges
awarded the two men the same scores
for artistry and presentation. Ironically,
Lysacek bested Plushenko in the pro
gram components, a score awarded for
jumps,spins and the technical elements
that a skater executes during his pro
gram.

The scoring system for this sport has
changed tremendously since the last
time Stojko competed and even since
Torino, where Plushenko won gold.
And understandably, with the loss of
the 6.0 scoring system, the amount of
triple jumps and the presence of a
quadruple are what the audience
knows best. What the new scoring sys
tem has done, however, is take skating
back to its roots, rewarding skaters for
technique; not only do the jumps mat
ter, but also the transitions, choreogra
phy and what happens between these
hat tricks. Skaters are still rewarded for
successful quads, but the new system
emphasizes consistency and style. You
can't simply land a jump; you have to
land it well. And you can't just front
load your program with quads and
jumps; you need presentation and you
need to deliver a performance.
Evan Lysacek delivered that per
formance on the night when it mat
tered most. He skated brilliantly and
deserves every bit of that gold medal.
Had Plushenko landed several of his
triple jumps with more conviction, the
world might have heard a different na
tional anthem play that night; but that
didn't happen. For the first time in 30
years, an American man stood atop the
podium at the Olympic Games, and as
a former figure skater, it was almost as
good as standing on that medal stand
myself.

Plushenko will be back for the 2014
Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Rus
sia. And while I celebrate Evan's win
today, I can't wait to see Plushenko
skate the performance of his life
quads included, of course —in the
hope of regaining his Olympic title in
four years. He will be 31 years old at
those Games.

"You're a great
skater and all, but
that wasn't
Olympic champion
material"
— ERIK STOJK,
two-time Olympic
sliver medalist to
201 0 gold medalist
Evan Lysacek
Every four years, my world
stops for the Winter Olympic
Games. And since I was a lit
tle girl, I've followed the
same schedule for the two
week duration of the Games: wake up,
go to school, train for countless hours at
the rink, go home, do homework and
then watch anxiously as the world's top
athletes competed for medals and
glory in the sports to which they've
dedicated their entire lives.
I used to be a competitive figure
skater, and like many of the girls I
trained with, dreamed that I would one
day be able to don the Team USA jack
et and represent the United States on
Olympic ice. Although my Olympic
dreams officially ended when I quit the
sport five years ago, my enthusiasm for
the Games hasn't dwindled in the least;
last Thursday was no different.
On Thursday night, I rushed
through an econ problem set, clutched
my roommate's hand and waited with
bated breath, as I watched the men's
long program a four-and-a-half
minute test of strength, endurance and
sheer willpower —as figure skating
crowned its new men's Olympic cham
pion.

Perhaps what made this event espe
cially remarkable, aside from the un
predictability of a sport whose out
come is determined by judges and the
skaters' quarter-inch blades, was the
talent of the competition, the deepest
and most talented field of men in re
cent Olympic history. In the months
leading up to the Games, men's figure
skating saw the surprise reemergence
of Russian Evgeni Plushenko, the 2006
Olympic champion, who returned
from a three-year retirement solely to
defend his Olympic title, as well as the
return of Stephane Lambiel, the 2006
Olympic silver medalist. With a strong
Japanese contingent, an outstanding
American team led by 2009 world
champion Evan Lysacek and Canadi
an gold-medal hopeful Patrick Chan,
the list of medal contenders could be
categorized into two distinct groups
veterans from an era past and the
sport's current world medalists.
At the end of Tuesday's short pro
gram, it was clear that the Olympic
champion would be crowned in a
showdown between Plushenko and
Lysacek in the long program be
tween a quadruple jump and no
quadruple jump, between old jumping
styles and new artistry. Lysacek skated
first in the final group and, despite the
lack of a quad on his program compo
nents sheet, turned in what was per
haps the performance of his life. While
he lacked a quad, he more than made
up for it with strong spins, eight triple
jumps and spectacular choreography.
An hour later, Plushenko took the
ice as the final skater of the men's com
petition. Surely enough, the first jump
of his performance was a quadruple
triple combination, and Plushenko
landed it with ease and command.
However, his program seemed to
reach its apex with that quad, as the
Russian fought for landings on several
of his triple jumps—jumps that he
normally could have landed in his sleep
and displayed markedly slow spins.
Although his performance was charac
terized by several hip thrusts, as enter
taining as they were to watch, his cho
reography just did not match
Lysacek's, which bled with emotion.
By the time Plushenko finished his
performance, he certainly thought he
had done enough to win the gold
medal. The figure skating world, the
viewing audience, Evan and I collec
tively held our breaths to see if

Plushenko, who held less than a one
point lead after the short program, had
done enough to defend his Olympic
title. After perhaps the longest minute
in both of these skaters' lives, the
judges announced the scores
Lysacek had won by 1.31 points.

sliver medalist to

Evan Lysacek

I screamed out of happiness as
Evan himself jumped for joy on the
screen in front of me. But, as soon as the
gold medal was draped over Evan's
neck, Plushenko resumed his trash
talking once again, saying that he de
served to win and questioning how one
could become an Olympic champion
without a quad in his repertoire.
It seems that Evan's victory has
been somewhat marred by this contro
versy: did he deserve to win without a
quad? Elvis Stojko, the 1994 and 1998
Olympic silver medalist and the first
man to land a quad in combination,
weighed in on this debate, as did Russ
ian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,
who I never knew was an expert on fig
ure skating. Both men (perhaps one
with more credibility and knowledge
than the other) agreed with Plushenko.
In an article for Yahoo! Sports, Sto
jko characterized last Thursday as "the
night they killed figure skating," criti
cizing the newly crowned Olympic
champion's lack of a quadruple jump,
as well as the judges' scoring of the
competition. "You're a great skater
and all," Stojko told Lysacek, "but that
wasn't Olympic champion material."
While I respect Plushenko tremen
dously for coming out of retirement
and still being able to land quads, his
skating was off on Thursday night. And

even with the quad, his technique or
at least the technique we saw in his long
program, which was sub-par compared
to what he has done in the past —just
didn't compare to Lysacek's. While
Stojko argued that Plushenko should
have won because he didn't make any
mistakes, I disagree Plushenko did
make mistakes. He might not have fall
en, but the small bobbles and awkward
jump landings added up.

Plushenko whined about how
Lysacek won based on his footwork
and presentation, calling Thursday
night's competition "ice dancing, not
men's figure skating," but the judges
awarded the two men the same scores
for artistry and presentation. Ironically,
Lysacek bested Plushenko in the pro
gram components, a score awarded for
jumps,spins and the technical elements
that a skater executes during his pro
gram.

The scoring system for this sport has
changed tremendously since the last
time Stojko competed and even since
Torino, where Plushenko won gold.
And understandably, with the loss of
the 6.0 scoring system, the amount of
triple jumps and the presence of a
quadruple are what the audience
knows best. What the new scoring sys
tem has done, however, is take skating
back to its roots, rewarding skaters for
technique; not only do the jumps mat
ter, but also the transitions, choreogra
phy and what happens between these
hat tricks. Skaters are still rewarded for
successful quads, but the new system
emphasizes consistency and style. You
can't simply land a jump; you have to
land it well. And you can't just front
load your program with quads and
jumps; you need presentation and you
need to deliver a performance.
Evan Lysacek delivered that per
formance on the night when it mat
tered most. He skated brilliantly and
deserves every bit of that gold medal.
Had Plushenko landed several of his
triple jumps with more conviction, the
world might have heard a different na
tional anthem play that night; but that
didn't happen. For the first time in 30
years, an American man stood atop the
podium at the Olympic Games, and as
a former figure skater, it was almost as
good as standing on that medal stand
myself.

Plushenko will be back for the 2014
