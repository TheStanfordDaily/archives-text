# What is wrong with NBC?

### Daniel Bohm 
As I am sure all of you have
figured out, the Olympics
bring out some very po
larizing sentiments. I, for
one, love the Olympics,
but I also realize there are some things
that need to be changed about them.
Actually, there is one main thing
that needs to be changed NBC
needs to stop covering them.
Despite the fact that here at Stan
ford we are in the same time zone as
Vancouver, we are barely able to watch
any Olympic events live. Given the cur
rent state of media with Twitter,
Facebook, and wireless internet every
where almost everyone already
knows the results of what they get to
watch on the NBC family of networks.
Currently, I am watching the USA
versus Canada men's hockey game,
which is probably the most compelling
and popular Olympic game thus far in
the U.S. Of course, I am watching it on
MSNBC, though, and not in high defi
nition because, for some twisted idea,
NBC thinks it is a good idea to play a
game between Russia and Czech Re
public that ended three hours ago in
lieu of the USA game.
The other day, American sweet
heart and Sports Illustrated swimsuit
model Lindsey Vonn had a thrilling run
to win gold in the women's downhill. I
streamed it online from a European
TV station because NBC was too inept
to play it live. No wonder NBC is losing
millions broadcasting (I use that term
very loosely) the Olympics.
NBC has four main channels cover
ing the Olympics (NBC, MSNBC,
CNBC and USA), yet the only events
viewers can see live are pool play curl
ing matches and some hockey games.
One of my friends put it best, saying.
"Everybody who works for NBC's
Olympics coverage should be fired and
sent to Antarctica to film the ice."
Amen to that.
Basically, NBC's putrid coverage
makes an event like the Olympics,
which has fledgling support in the U.S.
to begin with, even less watchable.
That is a damn shame, because there
is so much to like about the Olympics.
First, there is the camaraderie it cre
ates. The room I am watching the USA-
Canada hockey game in right now is
packed with people that never watch
hockey but will get together, talk about
how sweet Ryan Miller's goalie mask is
and cheer like crazy for their country.
That is freaking awesome. The fact
that an American winning a random
speed skating or ski jumping event is
enough to bring a buzz to a room and
bring people together around one com
monality the U.S.A. is special.
Olympic hockey is the best though.
The National Hockey League actually
stops its season in order to allow the
best players in the world to compete
against each other in the Olympics. Yes,
professional athletes compete in bas
ketball in during the Summer
Olympics, but in no other event other
