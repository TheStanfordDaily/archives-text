team engineered another dominant
performance. The Stanford Nike Invi

Farm to play each other in a round

games, beating the Fighting Illini 8-0
and the Flighlanders 9-1. Both games
ended in five innings as the Card run

record, but was unable to make her
mark on the Cardinal offense. Much of
the firepower for Stanford came from
the bottom third of its lineup: junior
first baseman Melisa Koutz, sopho
more designated player Jenna Becerra
and sophomore center fielder Sarah
