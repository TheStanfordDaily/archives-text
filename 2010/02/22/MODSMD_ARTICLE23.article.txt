## Cardinal continues tourney triumphs 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In its second tournament in as
many weekends, the Stanford softball
team engineered another dominant
performance. The Stanford Nike Invi
tational brought five teams to The
Farm to play each other in a round
robin format Illinois, UC-River
side, Nevada, Sacramento State and
Fresno State. The Cardinal, in its first
games of the season at Smith Family
Stadium, played the first four of these
teams and won all of its games by a
combined score of 28-3.
While Stanford, currently ranked
No. 13 in ESPN.com and USA Soft
ball's rankings, was scheduled to play a
fifth game yesterday against No. 19
Fresno State (7-1), the game was can
celled due to rain.
"It would have been another quali
ty opponent for us," said Stanford
head coach John Rittman. "It would

have been a good test for our team, but
unfortunately Mother Nature didn't
cooperate,"

The Cardinal had its first games on
Friday, playing a doubleheader against
Illinois (8-1) and UC-Riverside (2-6).
Stanford was in dominant form in both
games, beating the Fighting Illini 8-0
and the Flighlanders 9-1. Both games
ended in five innings as the Card run
ruled both teams.

The Stanford offense shelled Illi
nois starting pitcher Monica Perry for
seven runs on 10 hits in just 3.1 innings.
Perry came into the game with a 3-0
record, but was unable to make her
mark on the Cardinal offense. Much of
the firepower for Stanford came from
the bottom third of its lineup: junior
first baseman Melisa Koutz, sopho
more designated player Jenna Becerra
and sophomore center fielder Sarah
Flassman sparked both of Stanford's
rallies, scoring five of the Cardinal's
eight runs between them.
Junior pitcher Ashley Chinn also
turned in a strong performance. In
five innings, she allowed only four
hits and no runs while accruing three
strikeouts. Even as the Cardinal of
fense piled up runs, Chinn did not
give the Fighting Illini offense a re
prieve.
"I'm going to stay aggressive with

the hitters no matter what," she said.
"Whether we're beating a team 10-0
or losing 10-0 or it's a 0-0 ballgame,
I'm just going to stay aggressive with
the hitters and throw my game the
best that I can."

"[lllinois] is a tough team; they
have a terrific offense," Rittman
added. "Ashley Chinn did a great job
of shutting that offense down."
In the next game, Stanford contin
ued to play well, as its offense pow
ered past UC-Riverside starting
pitcher Amy Lwin and its defense
completely shut down the High
landers' attack. Sophomore right
fielder Maya Burns and sophomore

second baseman Ashley Hansen
were particularly strong for the Car
dinal, driving in two and three runs,
respectively, to lead Stanford's of
fense in RBIs.

On the mound, freshman pitcher
Teagan Gerhart rebounded well
from a rough outing last weekend
against Hawaii with a very strong
performance. Riverside's hitters
were rarely able to catch up to her
fastball and after five innings of
work, Gerhart had only given up one
hit and one unearned run while strik
ing out seven.

Despite her rookie status, Ger
hart has become one of the Card's
chief pitchers alongside Chinn.
"I didn't think I'd be able to pitch
as much as I have been lately, but it's
an amazing opportunity," she said.
"That was a great first day of the
tournament for us," Rittman added.

Stanford continued to dominate
its opponents on Saturday, the tour
nament's second day. It defeated
Nevada (3-5) 10-2 in another five-in
ning run rule game, and eked out a
close 1-0 win over Sacramento State
(3-7) in the second game.
Against Nevada, the Cardinal
had a similar performance to its first
two games of the tournament. The
offense was once again extremely
strong, and was led by senior left
fielder Alissa Haber. She had four
RBIs on two hits to lead all Stanford
hitters. The Card was also helped by
extremely poor fielding by the Wolf
pack its fielders committed three
errors in the game, and of the 10 runs
surrendered by pitcher Katie
Holverson, only six were earned.
Meanwhile, the pitching load for
the Cardinal was split between
Chinn and Gerhart, who pitched
three and two innings, respectively.
Chinn gave up two hits and two
earned runs, while Gerhart gave up
only one hit while striking out four
batters. Chinn also got the win, and
her record for the season now stands
at 4-1.
"We scored a lot of runs and put a
lot of pressure on the Nevada of
fense," Rittman said. "We got be
hind in that game 2-0 and we came
back, so I'm very proud of the way
our team came back in that game
and pulled out a victory."
Stanford's last game of the tour
nament against Sacramento State

was also its toughest. Stanford's of
fense was uncharacteristically quiet
and the game turned into a pitcher's
duel between the Hornets' Shelby
Voelz and Gerhart. Gerhart was
able to prevail, pitching a shutout to
preserve a fourth straight win for the
Cardinal and improve her personal
record to 4-0. Over seven innings,

she gave up just three hits while
striking out six.

"It was hard to know that I didn't
have any insurance runs, but it just
made me pitch that much harder
and be more consistent with my
pitches," Gerhart said. "If you miss
one pitch, you know that it could
change the outcome of the game,"
"[Sacramento State's] pitcher
did a great job of keeping us off
balance with her changeup,"
Rittman said. "We hit a couple of
balls hard right at people in key sit
uations, and sometimes that's the
way softball is."
"Good teams find ways to win
close games," he continued. "Our
team did a good job of playing de
fense and got some solid pitching
when the bats were shut down."
The next challenge for the Cardi
nal will come at the Cathedral City
Classic in Palm Springs, Calif. Start
ing on Thursday, Stanford will take
on six teams over four days in a
round-robin format. Its first game will

Senior Shannon Koplitz hit .400 this weekend as the Cardinal won all four of its
games in the Stanford Nike Invitational. Stanford used a combination of great
pitching from junior Ashley Chinn and freshman Teagan Gerhart, who had 23
strikeouts between them, and an explosive offense, including left-fielder Alissa
Haber's eight RBIs to defeat the competition in its first four tournament games.
