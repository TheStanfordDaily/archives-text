## Cardinal splits against ranked teams in SoCal 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball
team faced two top-five ranked teams
this past weekend. No. 4 Pepperdine and
No. 3 USC, and came out with a split.
The Card dropped a three-set match to
the Pepperdine Waves (30-28,30-27,30-
27) and picked up a 3-1 win against the
USC Trojans (30-16, 30-28, 28-30, 30-
23).

On Friday night at Pepperdine, sen
ior opposite hitter Evan Romero hit a
team-high 19 kills. Following close be
hind, sophomore outside hitter Brad
Lawson registered 16 kills on the night.
Junior outside hitter Spencer McLach
lin was the only other Cardinal to hit the
double digits with 11, while senior setter
Kawika Shoji had 52 assists.
Early on in the first set, Stanford fell
behind 9-6, but sophomore middle
blocker Gus Ellis helped even the score
at 10-all.The Cardinal hung in with Pep
perdine from then on as Romero, Law
son and Ellis tried to give Stanford the
edge. Pepperdine's Maurice Torres and
Cory Riecks battled back, keeping the

Waves within a point of Stanford. The
two hit 15 and 17 kills in the match, re
spectively. A Stanford error ended the
set, 30-28.
Into the second set, Stanford held the
slight advantage and came out firing
with Lawson and McLachlin. Senior
middle blocker Garrett Werner con
nected on a few sets with Shoji as well,
but midway through the set, Pepperdine
began to take over. With Pepperdine up
16-15, Romero and McLachlin attempt
ed to regain the lead, but Pepperdine's
Rodnei Santos and J.D. Schleppenbach
pounded in kills and extended the
Waves' lead to 20-17. Lawson brought
the Card within one at 28-27, but
Schleppenbach and Torres finished it off
to take the set, 30-27.
With a chance to redeem itself, the
Card kept it close during the third set.
Ellis, McLachlin and Lawson tied it up
early at two, five and seven. Stanford
would see a lead at 10-9, following a
Pepperdine service error, Lawson ace
and a Lawson kill. The Waves answered
back, however, and took a 14-11 lead. A
kill by Pepperdine's Riecks left Stan
ford trailing 20-15. Although the Card

was within one point on six different oc
casions, the team was bested by Pepper
dine and a Santos kill ended the night at
30-27.

Maybe it was a new spark or an old
debt to pay, but the Card came out in full
force against USC. Lawson hit a team
season-high of 29 kills, and Romero and
McLachlin recorded 17 and 14 on the
night, respectively.
The Card came out running in the
first set to take a 6-1 lead.Trojan hitters
Tony Ciarelli and Austin Zahn an
swered back with a pair of kills each, but
Romero, Ellis and McLachlin shut them
down at 12-5, forcing a time out. Lawson
and Werner continued the fight against
USC, which at one point resulted in a
13-point lead at 26-13. The first set
ended, 30-16, with a kill by Ellis fol
lowed by a USC error.
USC fought back in the second set,
but Stanford maintained its edge, Cia
relli helped get the Trojans within one at
10-9, but McLachlin kept Stanford
ahead. Trojan Steven Shandrick took
the lead back for USC at 22-21, and Car
dinal errors continued the Trojans' run.
The Cardinal took back the lead on a

Romero service ace, and a McLachlin
kill combined with a Trojan error gave
the set to Stanford, 30-28.
Stanford dominated most of the
third set and held the lead over the Tro
jans at 20-19. A back and forth battle en
sued up until USC's Zahn put the Tro
jans ahead. A Cardinal error and a Cia
relli kill polished off the set at 30-28.
Into the fourth set, Stanford started
out reenergized and ready to finish off
the match. Lawson, McLachlin and
Shoji all added in kills for an initial lead.
USC's Tri Bourne tied it up at 10, but
Lawson hit a kill for the 13-11 lead. A
spread offense with Lawson, Romero
and Werner lifted the Card to a 20-16
lead. At 27-22, Romero hammered in a
kill and USC followed with two errors
to end the match at 30-23.
With this split weekend, Stanford is
now 8-4 overall and 7-4 in Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation play.
This week, the Cardinal will face UC-
