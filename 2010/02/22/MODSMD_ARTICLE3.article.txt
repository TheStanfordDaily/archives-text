# LAW SCHOOL
## Law School moves to quarters The 						school changed to integrate with rest of campus 
### ANNIE PROSSNITZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Law School transi
tioned to the quarter system this
school year with the goal of better
integrating law students with the
undergraduate community, and
"inbound" and "outbound" enroll
ment law students enrolled in
non-Law School courses and vice
versa seems to indicate the
change is working.
Total inbound and outbound
enrollment has grown to 500 stu
dents annually, said Larry Kramer,
dean of the Law School. Five years
ago, that number was just 30.
Kramer cited the need for inter
disciplinary training as one of the
prime reasons for the schedule
shift.
"Changes in the legal profession
over the past 25 years have made it
not just useful, but necessary for
law students to learn a variety of
things taught in other parts of the
University," Kramer said. "Lawyers
need to understand what their
clients need and want to accom
plish, and to do that, they need to
understand more than law."
"The law school needed to
change its calendar to bring itself
in sync with the rest of the
University, but cross-disciplinary
learning is happening everywhere
and across every discipline,"
Kramer added. "It is happening at
every university, too, though
Stanford is ahead of other universi
ties in this respect."
Salone Kapur 'lO, co-president
of the Stanford Pre-Law Society,
concurred with Kramer on the
importance of a quarter schedule
in studying different subjects to
become a well-rounded law stu
dent.
"[The quarter system] really
makes it easier for [law students] to
take advantage of joint-degree pro-
grams," Kapur said. "Taking
advantage of courses outside the
law school is really critical."
Kapur also said that the law
school's transition to the quarter
system offered benefits for under
graduates interested in law,
though meeting law school course
requisites can be challenging for
undergraduates.
Another advantageous aspect
of the switch is that undergrads
who are prospective law students
can easily schedule times to shad
ow a law student, as their sched
ules are now more synchronized,
according to Kapur.

While Kramer said it is too
early to say how professors and
law students are responding to the
shift, Kramer remarked that there
have been mixed reviews, with
some students favoring their new
ability to enroll in more courses
and others disliking the speed of
the quarter system.
However, Kramer said there
was enthusiasm within the field
about the skills that law students
could acquire through the shift.
"Future employers are excited
about what we're doing, and stu
dents will see the real benefits
when they get out and discover
what a difference the new curricu
lum makes in their ability to hit
the ground running and get more
responsibility early," he said.
