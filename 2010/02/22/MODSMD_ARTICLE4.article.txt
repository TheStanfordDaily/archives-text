# Yichao Wang dies after accident
## Visiting Ph.D. student killed following bike collision with a vehicle 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
Yichao Wang, a Chinese graduate student
who struck a car while bicycling at a Palm
Drive intersection Feb. 3 and suffered major
head trauma, died Friday. He was 25.
Wang, one of only a handful of bike acci
dent victims to suffer serious head injuries in
some 200 accidents reported to Stanford

police since 2005, was a Ph.D. student visiting
the civil and environmental engineering
(CEE) department from Nanyang
Technological University in Singapore. He
was biking home from the lab on Feb. 3 at
about 9:30 p.m. when, at the intersection of
Palm Drive and Museum Way, he collided
with a car.
"He stayed late in the lab every day," said
Sujie Qin, a Chinese post-doctoral researcher

in the same program as Wang, the Singapore-
Stanford Partnership. "Everyone who knew
him in the department loved him."
Wang was taken to Stanford Hospital after
the accident, where he remained in a coma
until Friday.

He was not wearing a helmet at the time
of the accident, a California Highway Patrol
officer said.
Wang's parents arrived at Stanford last

week from Harbin, China; his wife came from
Singapore, where she is reportedly a student.
They remain in the area, said acquaintance
Dan Cao, facing steep medical bills and a
funeral to organize before returning home.
The CEE department is providing for their
lodging.
According to Cao, a postdoctoral student
in pediatrics and genetics, word of
Wang's accident spread on the
online Chinese Mutual Aid
International Network; she heard
about his case through an online
forum and "just walked into hospi
tal, found the person and the family
and offered my help" translating for
his parents and wife and talking to
reporters.

The network's Web site Sunday
night showed that Wang's family
had received about $41,000 in dona
tions from dozens of Chinese
donors.

"His family is now in an
extremely difficult financial situa
tion because his parents are both
retired and receive only a few hun
dred US dollars a month from their
pensions," said a statement on the
Web site, "Yi-Chao's insurance ben
efits were exhausted by the surgery,
and cost of hospitalization has been
a huge burden on Yi-Chao's family."
The donors' comments page on
the network's Web site was filled
with blessings and subdued wishes
for a happy new year.
Dao said there will be a public
funeral for Wang, tentatively on
Saturday, before his family returns
to China. They are searching for a
suitable Buddhist venue, she said.
Meanwhile, the California
Highway Patrol has concluded its
investigation of the accident, said
spokesman Art Montiel on Sunday.
Wang was biking east on
Museum Way on Feb. 3 at about
9:30 p.m., Montiel said. According to
the Stanford News Service, Wang
was headed from his lab to his Palo
Alto home. It is unclear whether he
had a bike light.
In the Palm Drive intersection,
Wang failed to yield to a Honda
Civic, Montiel said. At 20 miles per
hour, the Civic was driven by a 79-
year-old San Jose man.
Wang was thrown off his bike,
onto the hood of the car and then to
the roadway, where he was found
128 feet north of where he first col
lided with the car. Without a helmet,

he suffered major head trauma and
was taken to Stanford Hospital,
Montiel said.
In a University statement,
Stanford police chief Laura Wilson
called the accident "tragic."

"We hope [it] will serve to alert
members of our campus community
to the importance of wearing bicy
cle helmets, and the need to be vigi
lant about safety at all times,
whether you are a bicyclist or driv
ing a vehicle," Wilson said.
The University pointed to bike
safety efforts that it undertakes
annually, including safety road
shows in dorms, bike light give
aways and training courses offered
through its Parking and
Transportation department.
Wang was studying the absorp
tion of pharmaceutical residues in
wastewater treatment processes,
according to the University. He
arrived at Stanford in December.
"During the time we worked
together, he was a really, really nice
person and worked really hard,"
Qin said. "It's hard to accept the
truth, but I think people are still try
ing to balance the work and the sad
ness," Qin said.
