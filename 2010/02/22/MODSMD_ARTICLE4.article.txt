Yichao Wang, a Chinese graduate student
who struck a car while bicycling at a Palm
Drive intersection Feb. 3 and suffered major
head trauma, died Friday. He was 25.
Wang, one of only a handful of bike acci
dent victims to suffer serious head injuries in
some 200 accidents reported to Stanford

police since 2005, was a Ph.D. student visiting
the civil and environmental engineering
(CEE) department from Nanyang
Technological University in Singapore. He
was biking home from the lab on Feb. 3 at
about 9:30 p.m. when, at the intersection of
Palm Drive and Museum Way, he collided
with a car.
"He stayed late in the lab every day," said
Sujie Qin, a Chinese post-doctoral researcher

in the same program as Wang, the Singapore-
Stanford Partnership. "Everyone who knew
him in the department loved him."
Wang was taken to Stanford Hospital after
the accident, where he remained in a coma
until Friday.

He was not wearing a helmet at the time
of the accident, a California Highway Patrol
officer said.
Wang's parents arrived at Stanford last

week from Harbin, China; his wife came from
Singapore, where she is reportedly a student.
They remain in the area, said acquaintance
Dan Cao, facing steep medical bills and a
funeral to organize before returning home.
The CEE department is providing for their
lodging.
According to Cao, a postdoctoral student
