Students danced until the early hours of the morning at the 33rd annual Viennese Ball, held Friday in Burlingame. The Stanford tradition featured a
variety of music, including an orchestra, a jazz band, polka and other forms of dancing. Students trained in the weeks leading up to the event
performed routines ranging from swing dancing to waltzing, although the classical and contemporary dancing was divided between two rooms.
