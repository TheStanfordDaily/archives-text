## Hospital president to retire 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellen Huet 
Martha Marsh, the president
and chief executive officer of
Stanford Hospitals & Clinics,
announced last week that she plans

to retire in August after an eight
year stint at the hospital's helm.
During Marsh's time as CEO,
the hospital has consistently been
ranked on U.S. News & World
Report's Honor Roll for hospitals,
which honors institutions that
receive high scores in six or more
specialties. In the 2009-10 year,
Stanford Hospitals & Clinics
ranked 15th.

Other recent recognition for
the Stanford Hospitals & Clinics
includes the Leapfrog Top
Designation for 2009, which ranks
hospitals on a range of quality and
safety practices. In late January, the
hospital was also awarded the
highest-level designation for its
electronic medical record system
from HIMSS Analytics Database.
Currently, less than one percent of

hospitals in the United States have
similar levels of rankings for their
electronic databases.

"It has been a great privilege to
serve as President and CEO of
Stanford Hospital & Clinics for the
past eight years," Marsh said in a
statement. "I am very proud of the
work that we have accomplished. It

has been an honor for me to work
with so many individuals who are
truly committed to our patients."
With Marsh at the helm, Stanford
Hospitals & Clinics also expanded its
outreach presence in the community.
In mid-January, the hospital sent a
team of seven physicians and nurses
to Haiti to treat patients in the after
math of the magnitude 7.0 earth
quake. In 2008, the hospital started
supporting special recuperation
rooms at a facility in San Jose for
homeless patients after being dis

charged from acute care, and also
recently pioneered a drive-through
triage and care system for dealing
with pandemics.
The hospital board of directors
will select a successor in the coming
months through a national search.
