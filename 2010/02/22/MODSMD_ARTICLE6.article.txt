Martha Marsh, the president
and chief executive officer of
Stanford Hospitals & Clinics,
announced last week that she plans

to retire in August after an eight
year stint at the hospital's helm.
During Marsh's time as CEO,
the hospital has consistently been
ranked on U.S. News & World
Report's Honor Roll for hospitals,
which honors institutions that
receive high scores in six or more
specialties. In the 2009-10 year,
Stanford Hospitals & Clinics
ranked 15th.

Other recent recognition for
the Stanford Hospitals & Clinics

Currently, less than one percent of

similar levels of rankings for their
electronic databases.

"It has been a great privilege to
serve as President and CEO of
Stanford Hospital & Clinics for the
past eight years," Marsh said in a
statement. "I am very proud of the
