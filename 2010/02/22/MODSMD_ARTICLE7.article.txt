## New law degree set for fair '10 Program targets students with international degrees 
### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Law School is putting
the finishing touches on a new
Master's of Law (LLM) degree pro
gram in International Economic
Law, Business and Policy (lELBP),
set to roll out this fall. The program
will offer the first masters-level
courses at Stanford in several areas
in the hopes of increasing the
University's appeal to international
students interested in business law.
The program, one of three LLM
programs offered by Stanford,
would accept 12 to 15 students who
have already received their primary
law degrees internationally.
"It is part of our attempt to
develop a more globally-oriented
law school program," said law Prof.
Alan Sykes. "We're trying to build
up our international business pro
gram, which we believe will be good
for our students as well as for the
school."
Sykes, who now leads the pro
gram, first pitched the idea for the
international business-focused LLM
two years ago. A faculty vote held
last May unanimously approved the
program, and Stanford has already
received applications for the fall of
2010.
lELBP will focus on four general
areas: international dispute resolu
tion, international economic law,
comparative business law and inter
national transactions.
By increasing its focus on inter
national students, educators at the
law school hope that American stu
dents can learn about foreign law
systems and cultures while offer
ing foreign students a chance to
experience Stanford's unique aca
demic environment.
"[The students] all graduate with
an enhanced set of skills and knowl
edge, as well as an international net
work of friends and colleagues," said
Lucy LaPier, executive director for
international graduate programs at
the Law School. "It's really a great
example of the world getting flat
ter."
Although all LLMs are open
only to students who earned law
degrees outside of the United States,
Stanford's current two programs
Corporate Governance and Practice
and Law, Science and Technology
focus on American law.
"For masters-level programs,
most students are foreign," Sykes
said. "American law students don't
usually go for masters degrees out
side special programs like tax law."
As lELBP will not hire any addi
tional faculty members of its own
