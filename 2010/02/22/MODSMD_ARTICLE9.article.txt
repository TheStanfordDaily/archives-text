## FEEL THE RHYTHMS Performance groups don't miss a beat at the annual multicultural benefit show 
### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Whoever believes it
takes two days to
travel around the
world has never
seen Rhythms.
On Saturday night. Memorial
Auditorium was awash in bright
colors and music for Rhythms, the
annual multicultural benefit show
organized by Sanskriti, Stanford's
South Asian undergraduate organi
zation. Rhythms whisked away the
audience on a dazzling two-hour
cultural journey consisting of
singing, dancing, music making and
joke telling.
The show featured 15 student
groups, opening with Cardinal
Calypso, the Trinidad and Tobago
steel pan ensemble, and ending with
the Bhangra dance team Chardi
Jawani. Sanskriti will donate the
proceeds of Rhythms a project
ed $3,500 to Project Dosti, an
organization that provides opportu
nities for students to teach English
and volunteer in India.
Miriam Marks 'll, co-chair of
Sanskriti, pronounced the event a
success, in terms of the proceeds
raised and the audience's reaction.
"What stands out to me is the
power of a couple of key people in
putting on an event of this magni
tude," Marks said, citing the past
few weeks of scheduling, emailing
and rehearsing that went into the
show. "I can never underestimate
the power of one person anymore."
Cardinal Calypso kicked off the
first half of the show, which includ
ed music and dance from South
India, China and Los Angeles, to
name a few. After intermission, one
of the most enthusiastically
received performances was by Dil
Se, a group that integrates modern
and Bollywood dancing styles in
order to showcase Indian culture.
The audience lapped up Dil Se's
storyline of sexy employer meets
hot employee, catcalling after every
raunchy hip thrust and provocative
pose.
Members of Raagapella, an all
male South Asian focus a cappella
group, also sparked the interest of
spectators, though for different rea
sons.
"I like the one standing next to
him," giggled a girl to her friend,
pointing out one of Raagapella's
members.
"Yeah, even though they kind of
sound like they're doing karaoke,"
replied her companion.
Another of the show's high
lights was the endearingly goofy
pair of emcees, Pooja Desai 'l3 and
Nick Cariello 'l3, who thoroughly
entertained the audience with an
excess of tacky puns and over

acted dialogue.
When at one point Cariello
announced that they would have to
tell jokes to stall for time, all of
Memorial Auditorium smiled and
groaned in unison. The jokes were
predictably cheesy yet amusing
perfect for an audience of middle
school adolescents.

"What did one calculator say to
other?" Cariello asked.
"What?" answered a few brave
members of the crowd.
"You can count on me!"
Both Cariello and Desai belong

to student groups that performed in
Rhythms: Dil Se and Basmati Raas,
respectively. After the show, Desai
commented on her experience with
Basmati Raas, an Indian dance
team that performs a style of dance
known as Garba Raas.

"Dancing on [Basmati] Raas has
easily been the best part of fresh
man year," she exclaimed, still high
on adrenaline, "I've gotten so close
to everyone on the team, so just
being with the people I love and
dancing the dance I love has been
an incredible experience."

Jonathan Lautaha 'l3, a member
of Kaorihiva, Stanford's Polynesian
dance group, echoed Desai's enthu
siasm.
"It was really fun," he said.
"People dance for many reasons,
but I think the main one should be
to have fun."
"The show is such a good way to
utilize the talent at Stanford for the
social good," he added.
For others, however, Rhythms
was more than just a colorful collec
tive of performances it present
ed an opportunity for students to

reconnect with their cultural base
and promote cultural awareness.
"A big part of me being in
Kayumanggi is to go back to my
roots as a Filipino," said Robi
Bucayu 'l3, a member of the
Filipino dance troop. "I think that
it's really important nowadays to
get in touch with who you are and
to not lose that sense of tradition
that's been passed down in your
families."
