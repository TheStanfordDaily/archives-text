George Lakoff: Why You Can't Understand 21st Century
Politics with an 18th Century Brain
E"Our democracy is in danger. That danger has its roots in
M money, power, social structure, and history, but the
ultimate source of that danger is in the brains of our
.. H citizens."
- George Lakoff, The Political Mind
George Lakoff, one of the world's best-known linguists and
cognitive scientists, has written books for those who want to
Vlfl know their own minds better, to understand why so many
Americans are willing to vote against their own interests,
and to figure out why so many progressive leaders don't
seem to make much progress.
The program is the subtitle of his latest book, The Political Mind, in which Lakoff
argues that the political divide in the LJS between red and blue, conservative and
progressive, has its source in the deep cognitive frames, prototypes, and metaphors we
use to make sense of the world we live in. Political reason is not as reasonable as we
suppose, but its unconscious and emotional logic can be better understood in fact,
it has to be understood if we hope to defend our most valuable political ideals:
freedom, equality, and democracy.
