# Second Life for old manuscripts, video games
## Preserving Virtual Worlds project archives digital media 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
You wander around a library, staring
up at Renaissance drawings and
manuscripts that are more than
twice your height. Uninterrupted,
you browse these original docu
ments from the first few centuries of the
printing press. And then, you fly away all
without leaving your computer.
Defying gravity comes easily when you're
an avatar in the 3D virtual reality world of
Second Life. While a first life at Stanford may
seem like more than enough for most people,
Stanford University is slowly increasing its
presence in Second Life.
In the virtual world, participants can make
friends, instant message, build houses, design
clothes, attend concerts, rake in real money
and pretty much do anything they want.
Including visit Stanford University Library.
Or fly.
"I think that this particular tool virtual
worlds is really going to be the wave of the
future," said Deni Wicklund, Stanford
University Libraries (SUL) tech support
manager and the woman in charge of
Stanford's Second Life "island," a private
community separate from the "mainland." "In
some ways it's like the Internet was in its
early days, with the debate over whether peo
ple would even want to use it. Now we are so
encompassed by it."
Many students had never heard of Second
Life, and still fewer have used it. Wicklund is
trying to change that.
For the last three years, SUL has been
involved in digitizing certain items from the
special collections and putting them on
Second Life on an exclusive Stanford island.
Several professors have experimented with
teaching classes in Second Life, but so far the
greatest success of Stanford in Second Life
has been in attracting researchers from all

over the (real) world to see what Stanford has
to offer.
A recent exhibit of Egyptian movie
posters in Green Library found its home in
Second Life with text that the user could
translate into either English or Arabic. Boxes
of items from Stanford's archives also make
perfect virtual replicas of the actual boxes sit
ting on the dusty library shelves. Researchers
can view certain items in Second Life before
deciding if it's worth the trip to the library
and also learn exactly where and in which box
the real item is held.
Wicklund, who often hangs out with her
avatar around Stanford island to answer
questions and talk to people who show up,
says she's encountered people who hail from
places as far away as Thailand, Brazil and
Jordan.
"They're coming to see what Stanford is
doing in Second Life," she said. "There have
been a couple times when I've run into a
prospective student who for some reason
thought Second Life would be a good place to
check out Stanford. I've also run into a
woman who said her husband was standing
behind her [in real life] and they were parents
of a prospective student."
Many schools across the world now offer
course options in Second Life, including med
ical classes in which students can practice vir
tual dissections. In one Stanford archaeology
section, students toured a virtual re-creation
of an archaeological dig in Turkey. In the com
ing months, Stanford hopes to increase out
reach to current students on Second Life and
make more people aware of the opportunities
in the virtual world.
"Clearly Second Life is not for everyone,"
Wicklund said. "Some people take to it imme
diately, and for other people it doesn't affect
them that way. [But] for those few people that
it appeals to, we're there."
While Second Life may not interest every
one right now, both Stanford and the Library

of Congress agree that it will have great
importance for the future. Since so much cul
tural formation takes place in virtual worlds,
they believe, Stanford and several other uni
versities have partnered in the Preserving
Virtual Worlds project to both update old
video games for preservation, and record
moments from Second Life for the future.
"We're capturing events in Second Life with
video, such as concerts, classes [and] open
houses," said Susan Rojo, manager of
Stanford's Digital Media and Collections
Project and one half of the Stanford duo
working on Preserving Virtual Worlds. "In
comparison to all that's going on in Second
Life it's pretty small, but we're trying to make
it representative."
Stanford is also working on preserving
the video games Doom and Sin City.
Making room in the exalted Library of i
Congress to store digital video game A
files may seem sacrilegious next to M
Abraham Lincoln's writings and eigh- H
teenth century revolutionary pam
phlets, but Rojo points out that because H
many forms of media are not consid- H
ered culturally significant at first, valu- H
able moments may be lost to future
researchers. V
"The problem in preservation is â– 
always the need for someone to find I
something of value in it to preserve it," M
Rojo said. "The first handful of years
of TV have little to no record, since
they would tape something and then U
next week tape over it. Something
important to our culture wasn't pre
served." AI
While many institutions seem to H
have accepted the cultural importance H
of video games and the effect of gamer H
enthusiasm on popular culture.
Second Life and the Stanford Second H
Life project have not endeared them- H
selves to all students.

"I think Second Life is a ridiculous waste
of time," said Leo Alterman 'l2. "I think it's a
bad idea to waste resources on it."

However, Gloria Johnson 'l2 said that los
ing old video games to the broken consoles
and rotted bytes of time would be a tragedy.
"They're classic," Johnson said. "Ask any
gamer and they'll tell you, that's a part of his
tory."

they believe, Stanford and several other uni
versities have partnered in the Preserving
Virtual Worlds project to both update old
video games for preservation, and record
moments from Second Life for the future.
"We're capturing events in Second Life with
video, such as concerts, classes [and] open
houses," said Susan Rojo, manager of
Stanford's Digital Media and Collections
Project and one half of the Stanford duo
working on Preserving Virtual Worlds. "In
comparison to all that's going on in Second
Life it's pretty small, but we're trying to make
it representative."
Stanford is also working on preserving
the video games Doom and Sin City.
Making room in the exalted Library of i
Congress to store digital video game A
files may seem sacrilegious next to M
Abraham Lincoln's writings and eigh- H
teenth century revolutionary pam
phlets, but Rojo points out that because H
many forms of media are not consid- H
ered culturally significant at first, valu- H
able moments may be lost to future
researchers. V
"The problem in preservation is â– 
always the need for someone to find I
something of value in it to preserve it," M
Rojo said. "The first handful of years
of TV have little to no record, since
they would tape something and then U
next week tape over it. Something
important to our culture wasn't pre
served." AI
While many institutions seem to H
have accepted the cultural importance H
of video games and the effect of gamer H
enthusiasm on popular culture.
Second Life and the Stanford Second H
Life project have not endeared them- H
selves to all students.

"I think Second Life is a ridiculous waste
of time," said Leo Alterman 'l2. "I think it's a
bad idea to waste resources on it."

However, Gloria Johnson 'l2 said that los
ing old video games to the broken consoles
and rotted bytes of time would be a tragedy.
"They're classic," Johnson said. "Ask any
gamer and they'll tell you, that's a part of his
tory."
