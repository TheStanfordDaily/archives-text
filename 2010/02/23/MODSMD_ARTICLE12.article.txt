## Jim Wallis says the economic crisis is also a values crisis 
### CRISTIANA GIANNINI 
Reverend Jim Wallis, evangelical theologian, politi
cal activist and author, spoke at Annenberg
Auditorium last night about what he said is a need to
envision last year's economic crisis as a chance for
moral change in America.
"Underneath this economic crisis is a values crisis,"
said Wallis, whose most recently released book is "The
Great Awakening: Reviving Faith and Politics in a
Post-Religious Right America."
"We won't get to economic recovery without a
moral recovery as well," he said.
The lecture was hosted by Stanford's Office of
Religious life as part of the Roger W. Heyns Lecture in
Religion and Community series.
Last night, Wallis criticized the exorbitant bonus
packages of America's six big banks. Applause fol
lowed his announcement that he and his family recent
ly pulled their money out of Bank of America and
opened new accounts with a smaller institution.
Wallis stressed, however, that the behavior of the
banks is not an isolated problem.
"Bonuses are just a symptom of a deeper societal
erosion of values: 'Greed is good. It's all about me and
I want it now,"' Wallis said.
During the first half of the lecture, Wallis avoided
discussion of Washington politics. He focused, rather,

on the need for grass-roots-level moral and spiritual
reform as a powerful and effective way to enact
change.
His message struck a chord with education master's
student Erica Ostermann.
"I was interested in how different religions organ
ize themselves to make political change," Ostermann
responded when asked why she attended the lecture.
"[Wallis] is doing it in a good way that is not too
polarizing," she added. "He is intentionally not trying
to alienate anyone."
Fatima Wagdy 'l2 said she was most interested in
Wallis's take on "activism and spirituality and how
they connect."
She said found the lecture inspiring because it
encouraged undergraduates "to put real passion and
dedication into service connecting it to morality
and faith."
The event was followed by a book signing for
Wallis' latest publication.
The annual lecture series was established with sup
port from the James Irvine Foundation in 1994 to
honor Dr. Heynes, an active participant in University
Public Worship at Stanford Memorial Church. Past
speakers include the Dalai Lama, Karen Armstrong
and Eboo Patel.
