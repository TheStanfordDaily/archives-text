## EDITORIAL Cardinal Care's transgender decision needs clarification 
### 
£ £ ■ ror quite some time, Cardinal Care
rH has included transgender non-sur
.A. gical treatments. Students have
made a compelling argument to include a
benefit for transgender surgical procedures.
Transgender surgical treatment is an impor
tant modality, and we are pleased to be able
to include that surgical coverage in 2010-11."

Cardinal Care's recent decision to include
transgender surgery in its student insurance
policy brings forth a difficult situation that is
likely to further polarize students on both
sides of the issue. It is easy to see the logic in
both sides, from those who view transgender
surgery as a necessary procedure with vital
benefits to transgendered individuals, to
those who are not comfortable with covering
a controversial treatment out of the pockets
of a collective insurance plan. In the end,
Cardinal Care must be ready to intellectual
ly defend its decision while also addressing
the concerns of those who do not think the
procedure should be covered by insurance.
For those in support, the mental health of
individuals seeking reassignment surgery is
deeply connected to the physical and mental
health of transgender individuals. The emo
tional quagmire of living as a sex you do not
identify with also has many medical trap
pings. Therapy, medications such as anti-de
pressants and other treatments incur costs by
students living without surgery as an option.
The decision to extend transgender surgery
coverage legitimizes the connection between
the mental health and physical state of trans
gender individuals.

Many of those averse to this recent
change rest on the logic that transgender
does not fall into the "pool of collective risk."
As the "risk" involved in this issue is hard to
define and does not pose a threat to or occur
in a majority of the population, covering the
surgery under the umbrella of Cardinal Care
creates a logical disjoint. Yes, Cardinal Care
is optional for most students, and therefore
those with ethical or personal issues with the
plan are free to purchase other health insur
ance from competing providers. The only
problem with this argument is that the new
mandatory policy of international students
buying Cardinal Care, eliminating an opt-out
for this group of students. Depending on the
moral position of prospective international
students, the coverage of transgender reas
signment surgery in Cardinal Care may dis
courage many potential international appli
cants in years to come.

In choosing to include transgender sur
gery as part of their coverage, Cardinal Care
has made a bold statement philosophically
and morally. The Editorial Board now urges
Vaden and Cardinal Care to work towards
educating the student body about transgen
der issues so that those uncertain about the
new policy may be better informed. It would
also help for Cardinal Care to provide a more
detailed explanation of their reasoning in
adopting this policy. Clearly stating the ethi
cal and logical grounds for this change will
help Cardinal Care uphold the new policy
even while it may remain controversial for
some time.
