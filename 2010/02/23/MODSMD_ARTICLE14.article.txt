# JUST A THOUGHT
## What are we comfortable with? 
### Nikola Milanovic 
There are currently about 25 armed con
flicts actively occurring around the
world. That is a lot. In light of the abun
dance of warfare that continues to plague hu
manity, an organization should be founded to
peacefully resolve such disputes. This associ
ation could contain representatives from
each country. It could provide a mediation
process to arbitrate between warring fac
tions. It could command a military peace
keeping force. We could give it a name that
reflects its harmonization of global interests,
like "United Nations."

Independently of cultural or religious as
sociation, certain values seem to pervade
global society. Basic principles like the con
cept that mass killing is morally abhorrent,
or at least not a preferable state of affairs,
are omnipresent across all nation-states. If
these few universal moral intuitions are
present in all people, why are they not hon
ored? Though many groups are quick to jus
tify killing, no present society is founded on
the principle that an ideal world involves
armed conflict. Yet for some reason

maybe boredom opposed parties around
the world continue to wage war.
This armchair speculation was stimulat
ed by a visit with some friends to a German
concentration camp in December. As far as
thrill value and photo opportunities for the
jetsetter go, Sachsenhausen internment
camp did not score high. A natural monu
ment or amusement park is more recom
mendable for travelers seeking those quali
ties. What the camp did provide was an op
portunity for somber reflection on human
nature and political conflict. The bleak real
ity that accompanies the loss of innocence
from coming face-to-face with the darkest
chapter in our history provides ample fod
der for reflection on why human disasters
persist.

Some 65 years ago, when the horror that
was the Holocaust was revealed to the
world, people promised themselves "never
again." Some 30 years later, a Cambodian
dictator killed 1.7 million civilians. Another
17 years later, a campaign began in former
Yugoslavia that would leave 100,000 dead.
Two years after that, a similar movement in
Rwanda claimed 800,000 lives. In the wake
of each horrific genocide in the 20th centu
ry, the world bore witness and solemnly
promised itself "never again." And then,
under the watchful gaze of those who fer
vently pledged their commitment to com
bating such injustice, it happened again.
Why are we, as a world, so slow and hesi
tant to act when we see injustice? Why do
we not demand more of our polities, our
global institutions and our leaders? Though
many are quick to condemn what they see as
wrong, few are ever outraged enough to de
mand a change in the status quo.
All the ethnic cleansings the world has

been forced to suffer were met with cries of
"never again." In a year or so, when the con
flict in Sudan has actually ended and the
Janjaweed appetite for extermination has
been satiated, the world will once more gasp
in horror and proclaim "never again." And
then, most likely, genocide will happen
again. The characteristic bellicose nature
that seems so essential a human element
will rear its head in another localized the
ater, due to the inexhaustible enthusiasm
for destruction and suffering that seems to
plague societies.

When we witness the minutia of these sit
uations the appalling details that get lost
in the statistical overview and step back
to adopt a holistic perspective, we find our
selves wondering how it is that these con
flicts happened. How is our universal con
sciousness so pessimistic and jaded that we
aren't outraged? Why don't we demand
more of our world?

It is troubling that the same organiza
tions capable of acting against such traves
ties actively excuse themselves for not doing
so. Maybe it is not in our interest to prevent
war in the world. In an effort not to see our
selves as aggressors with no mandate to act,
we avoid involving ourselves in local con
flicts. Maybe we don't believe that we have
the power to cure societies of their tenden
cy to become embroiled in armed struggles.
These justifications are simply apologies:
the United Nations refrains from classifying
the war in Sudan as genocide because to do
so would make action imperative. And so
the pattern repeats itself, and the world
stands by in a discussion of moral obliga
tions and definitions while crimes against
humanity are perpetrated.
Would the world let the Holocaust hap
pen again? Our intuitions scream no, that
we as people would recognize and prevent
such evils from occurring again. But the ev
idence suggests the contrary. As long as con
flicts do not impact the nations capable of
intervening, the global community seems
content to allow suffering to perpetuate.
Though this is a pessimistic simplification of
a much more complex issue, the point is that
complacency is a dangerous position to
adopt. Maybe we should be more outraged.
Maybe our indignation would lead us to de
mand more of our leaders. Maybe.

Gee, this was depressing. Cheer Nikola up at
