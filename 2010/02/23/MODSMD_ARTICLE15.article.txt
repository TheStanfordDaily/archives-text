## Make poverty history – make clean energy cheap 
### Teryn Norris 
£ £ ~X~ f you gave me only one wish for the
I next 50 years," declared the world's
man during last week's
Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED)
2010 conference, "I can pick who is president,
I can pick a vaccine [...] or I can pick that [an
energy technology] that's half the cost with no
CO2 emissions gets invented, this is the wish I
would pick. This is the one with the greatest
impact."
Bill Gates is right. And he is not just talking
about the impact on climate change, which
does of course present a major threat. He is
also talking about one of the most critical
global imperatives to make poverty history:
making clean energy cheap.
"If you could pick one thing to reduce the
price of to reduce poverty, it would be energy
for half the price," Gates said in his introduc
tion. Gates should know as well as any devel
opment expert, since the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation, the world's largest trans
parent private foundation, has invested bil
lions of dollars in extreme poverty alleviation
since 1994.

Nearly 1.6 billion of our fellow human be
ings have no access to electricity, and approxi
mately 2.4 billion over one third of global
population meet their basic cooking and
heating needs by burning biomass, such as
wood, crop waste and dung. "Without access
to modern, commercial energy, poor countries
can be trapped in a vicious circle of poverty,
social instability and underdevelopment,"
concludes the International Energy Agency.
The direct health consequences of using
primitive solid fuels like biomass and coal are
severe. According to the World Health Orga
nization, exposure to indoor air pollution
(lAP), mostly from the use of these solid fuels,
causes 1.6 million excess deaths per year, espe
cially among women and children. An MIT
study in 2008 found that lAP is the fourth
largest cause of overall excess deaths in devel
oping countries after malnutrition, unsafe sex
and waterborne disease.

These numbers are staggering. Energy
poverty is an extreme and dangerous condi
tion, and its elimination must be one of the
highest development priorities for the 21st
century. Nobody on this planet should be
forced to burn dung to feed their family and
heat their home, and access to modern energy
sources should be considered a basic human
right.

The implication is that energy technology
innovation today should be considered one of
the world's most important social and eco
nomic justice movements. The growing move
ment to make clean energy cheap, and to de
liver that energy globally, has the potential to
alleviate as much human suffering and injus
tice as the largest social movements in history.
Of course, driving down the price of clean
energy technologies is also essential for reduc
ing global carbon emissions. Until the price
gap between low-carbon and high-carbon en
ergy is bridged, poor and rich nations alike will
continue relying upon coal and other fossil
fuels to power their development. That would
virtually assure climate destabilization.
The task is clear: to eliminate energy
poverty and avoid climate catastrophe, we
must unleash our forces of innovation

namely, scientists, engineers and entrepre
neurs to develop a portfolio of truly scala
ble clean energy technologies, bring these
technologies to market and ensure they are af
fordable enough to deploy throughout the
world.

If you gave me only one wish, then, it would

be for the United States to launch a major
public-private project to make clean energy
cheap. This requires the development of a
comprehensive, strategic roadmap for tech
nology development and deployment, includ
ing the identification of specific technical hur
dles and the various financial and human re
sources needed to overcome them. It will then
require large-scale public-private investment
in each stage of the energy innovation
pipeline, from basic research and develop
ment, to applied R&D, demonstration, direct
deployment, infrastructure and education
eventually on the scale of $5O-80 billion per
year of federal investment.
The clean energy investments in the Amer
ican Recovery and Reinvestment Act were an
important first step. Congress should take the
next step today with a bipartisan plan to in
crease the federal energy R&D budget to $l5-
30 billion per year, on par with the National
Institutes of Health, and to develop a compre
hensive federal energy education program. If
these investments are funded by a modest car
bon price, then all the better, but we can no
longer make energy technology policy de
pendent on the carbon pricing agenda. Clean
energy innovation is an economic, national se
curity and human development imperative,
and these public investments should be made
with or without cap and trade.
The United States was the driving force be
hind the global expansion of prosperity and
freedom in the 20th century. Today, a new
American project to make clean energy cheap
can alleviate untold human suffering and in
justice, develop the world's strongest clean en
ergy industry and help save the world from cli
mate destabilization. As Bill Gates put it,
"This is the one with the greatest impact."
