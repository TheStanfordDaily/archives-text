## ASSU Appropriations Committee: Goals and Methods 
### ANTON ZIETSMAN '12, CHAIR OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE Kelsei Wharton '12,ASSU Senator Alex Katz '12,ASSU Senator Brian Wanyoike '11,ASSU Senator Dean Young '11,ASSU Senator Mohammad Ali '10,ASSU Senator 
Over the past couple of months, there
has been a wave of criticism directed
toward the Senate's Appropriations
Committee. As chair of Appropriations, I
think it is my duty to clarify some misconcep
tions that have been circulating and provide
our perspective on the issue.

I believe that it is critical to remind the
student body of the financial climate in which
the ASSU has been operating this past fiscal
year. With the economic downturn and the
funding tendencies of the past Senate, the
11th Undergraduate Senate has been under
a lot of pressure to control spending and es
tablish a sustainable framework for the
ASSU's financial system.
With Regard to the General Fee

Last year, the Appropriations Committee
overspent the General Fee budget by over
$114,000. Fortunately, Stanford Student En
terprises keeps a reserve fund in the case of
such excesses. Had the Appropriations Com
mittee continued to allocate funds at the
same rate as last year, the reserve fund would
have been depleted and the ASSU would
have been in the red within 4 years.
With Regard to Special Fees

Last year, the Appropriations Committee
recommended over $l.B million is Special
Fees. Since then, the refund rates for Special
Fees groups have sky rocketed. As the size of
the system has consistently gotten bigger
from year to year, the financial strain on the
student body has dramatically increased -

going from $96 per student per quarter to
$ll9 in just 3 years. The refund rates have got
ten so high that they are already directly af
fecting groups' budgets and thereby their
programming.
The Committee's Response
These were the conditions we faced when
we got into office. If nothing had been done,
the programming of ah VSOs on campus
would have been in serious peril within 4-5
years. The Appropriations Committee has
been striving to get spending under control in
order to secure the long-term financial stabil
ity of the ASSU. We have spent our time and
effort not to block programming, as some
would proclaim, but rather to enable it in the
long run. Our duty is also to the future gener
ations of Stanford students.
Therefore, the Committee has actively pur
sued this goal by setting a cap on the General
Fee budget and by revising our funding poli
cies accordingly. These policies have been
guiding every one of our decisions since. Con
trary to what some people have said, short of
their registrations as community service or
programming groups, the Appropriations
Committee abstracts from the purpose of the
groups and focuses singularly on how their
funding requests relate to the policies.
With Regard to Transparency

This year's Committee has made unprece
dented efforts toward transparency and VSO
involvement. Since the beginning of the year,
I have made a point of consistently contact

ing all VSO Presidents and financial officers
to inform them of changes in policy. Further
more, every member of the Appropriations
Committee attends weekly office hours at
SAL to answer questions and help groups
with their budgets.
Throughout the Special Fees process, the
Committee and the Elections Commission
have held multiple info sessions and office
hours and have constantly been on email in
order to facilitate application for groups. The
Appropriations Committee has done all it
can on its side to facilitate exchange and
communication. Now, we challenge student
leaders to do their part in engaging us and
proposing reforms, rather than simply com
plaining.
Conclusion
The latest public characterizations of the
Appropriations Committee have been mis
guided. We have simply been taking into con
sideration the big-picture fairness of the fund
ing process, the monetary burdens imposed on
the entire student body, and the long-term
health of the ASSU's financial system.
