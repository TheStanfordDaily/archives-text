## Water mains set for maintenance 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
Stanford residents may see discol
ored tap water over the next month,
but it will still be safe to drink, the
Stanford Water Department said
Monday.
The possible discoloration would
come from a routine flushing of the
water mains to remove built up sedi
ment, a department spokeswoman
said. A loss in water pressure may also
result during the flushing.
"We suggest you refrain from
doing projects (laundry) that may be
impacted by temporary sediments in
the water while the water lines are
being flushed in your particular area,"
the department said in a statement.
Flushing is set to take place from 6:30
to 10:30 p.m. on specified dates.
Most Row houses are set to be
affected Feb. 23-25, east and west
campus dorms Mar. 1-4 and
Mirrielees Mar. 22-23.
