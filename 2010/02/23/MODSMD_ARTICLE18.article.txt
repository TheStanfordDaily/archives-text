## BEARS BEATEN 
### CHRIS DERRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After dueling back and forth for most of
the afternoon, the outcome of the Big Meet
between No. 2 Stanford and No. 4 Cal came
down to the final event. Stanford came into
the 400-yard freestyle relay with a nine-point
lead over Cal, needing either a win or both
second and third place to secure the meet vic
tory.

By the third leg, the contest had split into a
race for the win between the two 'A' relays
and a race for second between the two 'B' re
lays. On the anchor, Nathan Adrian of Cal

pulled away from senior Eugene Godsoe of
Stanford to win the race. Adrian also won the
50- and 100-yard free.

Stanford's hopes were still alive in the
form of sophomore Geoff Cheah. Cheah,
swimming the anchor on the 'B' relay,
touched the wall with 50 yards to go dead
even with Nolan Koon of Cal. Though Cheah
was swimming hard he did not know the sig
nificance of his race at the time.
"All I knew was that I had to beat the Cal
Bear next to me for the team and for the grad
uating seniors in their last home meet, as I
knew the meet was really, really close," Cheah
said.

With 25 yards to go, Cheah flipped off
the wall with an arm's length lead. With the
crowd at Avery Aquatic Center on its feet
and both teams screaming frantically from
the pool deck, Cheah held his slim margin
all the way to the final wall to secure the
Stanford victory 123.5-119.5. The signifi
cance of the moment was not lost on its
chief participant.

"Having all of my teammates cheering like
that was one of the most exciting things I've
ever experienced. It reminded me of all the
hard work that we all have put in and further
brought us together as a team and family"
Cheah said.

Cheah's heroics were set up in part by the
dominance of the Stanford distance group.
Sophomores Chad La Tourette, Micheal Zol
dos and Trevor Scheid contributed to two
sweeps in the 500- and 1,000- yard freestyle
events. La Tourette won the 1,000 and took
second to Zoldos in the 500. In the 1,000 jun
ior Scotty Korotkin took fourth to complete
the sweep, and senior David Mosko took
third in the 500.

Junior diver Brent Eichenseer won both
the one- and three-meter events to contribute
18 important points. In the absence of the in
jured senior Ail-American Dwight Dumais,
Eichenseer has been called on to take over as
Stanford's top diver.

Godsoe continued his stellar season by ef
fortlessly pulling away from Cal's Guy
Barnea and Mythias Gydensen in the final
length of the 200-yard backstroke. Freshman
Matthew Swanston took third in the event.

After taking the early lead, the Cardinal
fell behind by II points after Cal swept the
200-yard individual medley. The Cardinal re
sponded immediately when Mosko and soph
omore Bobby Bollier came from behind in
the last 25 yards to take first and second in the
200-yard butterfly. Both Mosko and Bollier
were less than three-quarters of a second
ahead of Tom Shields of Cal.
In similar fashion, junior John Criste and
sophomore Curtis Lovelace charged in the
final 25 yards of the 200-yard butterfly to take
second and third and preserve Stanford's lead
heading into the 400-yard relay.
Such performances were important to
the Cardinal victory. With the exception of
