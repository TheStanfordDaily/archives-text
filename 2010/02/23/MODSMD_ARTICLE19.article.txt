# CARD STILL PERFECT

### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal opened the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (MPSF) season with a
bang this weekend as the Stanford women's
water polo team (9-0,1-0 MPSF) demolished
No. 10 San Jose State, winning its ninth
straight game in the process.
Stanford took a small lead as the first pe
riod ended at 2-1. The second period fol
lowed the same pattern, leaving the first half
at 4-2.
"San Jose State was our first taste of a
dual-match this year," said sophomore driver
Pallavi Menon. "I think we had a slow start
but when we got going we were in sync."
The Cardinal crushed the Spartans during
the third quarter, smashing five goals into the
San Jose State net; the Spartans were unable
to return any of the goals and ended up scor
ing zero goals during the third period. At that
point, the Cardinal had a 9-2 lead and a victo
ry was in sight.
"Stanford played an exceptional third
quarter," said sophomore two-meter Melissa
Seidemann. "We found our groove and were
able to put the ball away. Not much changed
on the San Jose side the change came
from within the team. We knew they were
tired and we took advantage of that by shoot
ing the ball hard. It was fun for the intensity
to pick up like that."
During the fourth period, Stanford only
scored one goal while San Jose State scored
two. The final score, however, was 10-4, a
great opening for the team's first MPSF
game.
"It was not our best game [like] the score
might suggest," Menon said. "We have a long
list of areas to sharpen. I'm hopeful that our

best performances are yet to come, and that
is an exciting thought. We had a few spectac
ular goals from some of my teammates
scary for opponents, I'd say."
Even the No. 1 team in the nation says it
learns from each match it plays.
"The biggest thing that the team will take
away from this game is that we need to start
every game like we only have one opportuni
ty [and] have to come out attacking," Seide
mann said. "Something that always impress
es me is the way that our drivers are so tal
ented at posting up. Kelly Eaton did it all
game, as well as Kelsey Holshouser who
went in and scored a sweet backhand."
The top scorer this weekend was Seide
mann with a total of three goals. Senior driv
ers Eaton and Holshouser and Menon each
tacked on two goals while senior two-meter
Jessica Steffens smashed in a single goal.
In the net, the Cardinal demonstrated
some impressive defense as well. Freshman
goalkeeper Kate Baldoni saved a single at-
