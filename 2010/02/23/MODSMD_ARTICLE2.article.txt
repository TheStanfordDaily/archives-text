# DATA CENTER OPENS ON CAMPUS
## 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
The Institute for Research in the Social
Sciences (IRiSS) opened a secure data cen
ter on campus last Friday, providing a select
group of Stanford researchers local access to
detailed census and health statistics.
The new facility is a branch of the
University of California's Census Research
Data Center (CCRDC), located in UC-
Berkeley.
Researchers access the census informa
tion from a stark room in the data center.
This highly valued information covers demo
graphics including age, education, employ

ment, disability, citizenship, race and income.
Given the data's sensitive nature, many
precautions have been taken to maintain the
center's airtight security.
"All there are is terminals and screens
there are no output devices," said Chris
Thomsen, executive director of IRiSS.
"There's no printer, there's no place to plug
in a disk or memory chip or anything like
that."
And no data is actually on site it's all
stored at a Maryland server farm.
If researchers want to take home data, the
information has to be nonspecific and
cleared by a Census Bureau administrator
before it is printed outside the terminal

room. This assures no confidential informa
tion gets out the door.

To get access to the center, researchers
submit proposals to a Census Bureau offi
cial, who splits his time between Berkeley
and Stanford. The official reviews and then
forwards the proposals to Washington.
Proposals that are ultimately approved
are for studies that have scientific merit, help
improve Census Bureau data collection and
utility, and cannot be done without the confi
dential data.

It took economics professor Nick Bloom
about 18 months to get cleared. As part of
the process, he went through a two-hour
interview and a background check.

Despite the hassle, "I think it's the right
thing to do," Bloom said. "I mean, the data's
incredibly high quality and if it wasn't kept
secure then future people wouldn't want to
reply to the Census Office."
"I say it's easier to get a gold bar out of
Fort Knox than [to] get data out of the
Census," Bloom added.
Before the Stanford center opened,
researchers had to drive 40 miles across the
Bay to the Berkeley center, which was estab
lished in 1998.
"That's not easy," Thomsen said. "And so
obviously it's nice to have it a lot closer to
them on campus."
Before any of the nine electronic research

centers opened, trawling for confidential
census data required a much longer trip
than the drive to Berkeley.
"What it meant for most people was that
you had to travel back to Washington, D.C.,
and actually work within the building where
the data were located," said C. Matthew
Snipp, faculty director of the Secure Data
Center.

The Stanford center has been available
for about a year to researchers who needed
confidential data stored from other sources.
Snipp expects that survey firms will be more
willing to license similar sensitive data to
