# DATA CENTER OPENS ON CAMPUS
## 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
The Institute for Research in the Social
Sciences (IRiSS) opened a secure data cen
ter on campus last Friday, providing a select
group of Stanford researchers local access to
detailed census and health statistics.
The new facility is a branch of the
University of California's Census Research
Data Center (CCRDC), located in UC-
Berkeley.
Researchers access the census informa
tion from a stark room in the data center.
This highly valued information covers demo
graphics including age, education, employ

ment, disability, citizenship, race and income.
Given the data's sensitive nature, many
precautions have been taken to maintain the
center's airtight security.
"All there are is terminals and screens
there are no output devices," said Chris
Thomsen, executive director of IRiSS.
"There's no printer, there's no place to plug
in a disk or memory chip or anything like
that."
And no data is actually on site it's all
stored at a Maryland server farm.
If researchers want to take home data, the
information has to be nonspecific and
cleared by a Census Bureau administrator
before it is printed outside the terminal

room. This assures no confidential informa
tion gets out the door.

To get access to the center, researchers
submit proposals to a Census Bureau offi
cial, who splits his time between Berkeley
and Stanford. The official reviews and then
forwards the proposals to Washington.
Proposals that are ultimately approved
are for studies that have scientific merit, help
improve Census Bureau data collection and
utility, and cannot be done without the confi
dential data.

It took economics professor Nick Bloom
about 18 months to get cleared. As part of
the process, he went through a two-hour
interview and a background check.

Despite the hassle, "I think it's the right
thing to do," Bloom said. "I mean, the data's
incredibly high quality and if it wasn't kept
secure then future people wouldn't want to
reply to the Census Office."
"I say it's easier to get a gold bar out of
Fort Knox than [to] get data out of the
Census," Bloom added.
Before the Stanford center opened,
researchers had to drive 40 miles across the
Bay to the Berkeley center, which was estab
lished in 1998.
"That's not easy," Thomsen said. "And so
obviously it's nice to have it a lot closer to
them on campus."
Before any of the nine electronic research

centers opened, trawling for confidential
census data required a much longer trip
than the drive to Berkeley.
"What it meant for most people was that
you had to travel back to Washington, D.C.,
and actually work within the building where
the data were located," said C. Matthew
Snipp, faculty director of the Secure Data
Center.

The Stanford center has been available
for about a year to researchers who needed
confidential data stored from other sources.
Snipp expects that survey firms will be more
willing to license similar sensitive data to
Stanford researchers for study in
the future.
Researchers can bring whatever
information they want to the center
and "store it in a secure facility and
know that it's safe and can vouch to
the providers that it's in a protect
ed area," said Snipp.
"It's incredibly valuable,"
Bloom said, alluding to the center's
wealth of statistical information.
According to Bloom, the "cen
sus tracks individuals and individ
ual firms in away you just couldn't
do previously."
Thomsen is "aware of three fac
ulty and a couple grad students"
using the census data, and there are
several other social sciences faculty
and graduate students working
with other secure data.
Among them is Bloom, who is
investigating the credit crunch and
the causes behind the recession.
One of the best ways to study this,
he said, is to examine business'
sales in census data from previous
recessions. This information is con
fidential for businesses that are not
traded on a stock exchange.
"In the census you have some
thing like 50,000 firms a year ...
[for which] we have detailed output
sales data, and you just don't have
that [publicly available]," Bloom
said.
"You've just got so much more
information," he emphasized.
Bloom said research in the
social sciences is moving from just
theorizing to theorizing and testing
data at the same time.
Today, the Secure Data Center
is a small-scale, low-maintenance
operation.
"Right now we're not actually
costing much, because this is within
IRiSS, and so far we're just using
existing staff time to manage it,
with the exception for the census
center," Thomsen said.
The census center is supported
by access fees charged to
researchers.
The only IRiSS employee work
ing at the center is a research tech
nician who counts secure data man
agement among many other
responsibilities.
"IRiSS is involved in providing
research infrastructure for the
social sciences," said Snipp. "And so
it's just another element within the
larger institute in providing a facil
ity or place for people who need
data."
In the past few years, there have
been fewer CCRDC projects at the
Berkeley center than desired.
"There have been less than half
a dozen over the past couple of
years," said Jon Stiles, CCRDC
Director of Research, as opposed
to the 10 to 15 active projects at
other data centers around the
country.
"We're certainly hoping that
will increase," he added.
Although only a few researchers
are working at the Stanford data
center today, Thomsen is optimistic
that the CCRDC will become a
popular future resource.
"We think it's going to become
more and more valuable, because
the amount of data is expanding,"
Thomsen said.
He further observed that this
increase is matched by growing
interest in secure data and micro
data.
"But at the same time, there are
increasing concerns about protect
ing privacy and protecting [the]
security of the data," Thomsen said.
Ultimately, however, he believes
that the census system "is a quite
good one, and an effective way to
allow for the research, and yet pro
tects things from getting out."

University of California's Census Research
Data Center (CCRDC), located in UC-
Berkeley.
Researchers access the census informa
tion from a stark room in the data center.
This highly valued information covers demo
graphics including age, education, employ

ment, disability, citizenship, race and income.
Given the data's sensitive nature, many
precautions have been taken to maintain the
center's airtight security.
"All there are is terminals and screens
there are no output devices," said Chris
Thomsen, executive director of IRiSS.
"There's no printer, there's no place to plug
in a disk or memory chip or anything like
that."
And no data is actually on site it's all
stored at a Maryland server farm.
If researchers want to take home data, the
information has to be nonspecific and
cleared by a Census Bureau administrator
before it is printed outside the terminal

room. This assures no confidential informa
tion gets out the door.

To get access to the center, researchers
submit proposals to a Census Bureau offi
cial, who splits his time between Berkeley
and Stanford. The official reviews and then
forwards the proposals to Washington.
Proposals that are ultimately approved
are for studies that have scientific merit, help
improve Census Bureau data collection and
utility, and cannot be done without the confi
dential data.

It took economics professor Nick Bloom
about 18 months to get cleared. As part of
the process, he went through a two-hour
interview and a background check.

Despite the hassle, "I think it's the right
thing to do," Bloom said. "I mean, the data's
incredibly high quality and if it wasn't kept
secure then future people wouldn't want to
reply to the Census Office."
"I say it's easier to get a gold bar out of
Fort Knox than [to] get data out of the
Census," Bloom added.
Before the Stanford center opened,
researchers had to drive 40 miles across the
Bay to the Berkeley center, which was estab
lished in 1998.
"That's not easy," Thomsen said. "And so
obviously it's nice to have it a lot closer to
them on campus."
Before any of the nine electronic research

centers opened, trawling for confidential
census data required a much longer trip
than the drive to Berkeley.
"What it meant for most people was that
you had to travel back to Washington, D.C.,
and actually work within the building where
the data were located," said C. Matthew
Snipp, faculty director of the Secure Data
Center.

The Stanford center has been available
for about a year to researchers who needed
confidential data stored from other sources.
Snipp expects that survey firms will be more
willing to license similar sensitive data to
Stanford researchers for study in
the future.
Researchers can bring whatever
information they want to the center
and "store it in a secure facility and
know that it's safe and can vouch to
the providers that it's in a protect
ed area," said Snipp.
"It's incredibly valuable,"
Bloom said, alluding to the center's
wealth of statistical information.
According to Bloom, the "cen
sus tracks individuals and individ
ual firms in away you just couldn't
do previously."
Thomsen is "aware of three fac
ulty and a couple grad students"
using the census data, and there are
several other social sciences faculty
and graduate students working
with other secure data.
Among them is Bloom, who is
investigating the credit crunch and
the causes behind the recession.
One of the best ways to study this,
he said, is to examine business'
sales in census data from previous
recessions. This information is con
fidential for businesses that are not
traded on a stock exchange.
"In the census you have some
thing like 50,000 firms a year ...
[for which] we have detailed output
sales data, and you just don't have
that [publicly available]," Bloom
said.
"You've just got so much more
information," he emphasized.
Bloom said research in the
social sciences is moving from just
theorizing to theorizing and testing
data at the same time.
Today, the Secure Data Center
is a small-scale, low-maintenance
operation.
"Right now we're not actually
costing much, because this is within
IRiSS, and so far we're just using
existing staff time to manage it,
with the exception for the census
center," Thomsen said.
The census center is supported
by access fees charged to
researchers.
The only IRiSS employee work
ing at the center is a research tech
nician who counts secure data man
agement among many other
responsibilities.
"IRiSS is involved in providing
research infrastructure for the
social sciences," said Snipp. "And so
it's just another element within the
larger institute in providing a facil
ity or place for people who need
data."
In the past few years, there have
been fewer CCRDC projects at the
Berkeley center than desired.
"There have been less than half
a dozen over the past couple of
years," said Jon Stiles, CCRDC
Director of Research, as opposed
to the 10 to 15 active projects at
other data centers around the
country.
"We're certainly hoping that
will increase," he added.
Although only a few researchers
are working at the Stanford data
center today, Thomsen is optimistic
that the CCRDC will become a
popular future resource.
"We think it's going to become
more and more valuable, because
the amount of data is expanding,"
Thomsen said.
He further observed that this
increase is matched by growing
interest in secure data and micro
data.
"But at the same time, there are
increasing concerns about protect
ing privacy and protecting [the]
security of the data," Thomsen said.
Ultimately, however, he believes
that the census system "is a quite
good one, and an effective way to
allow for the research, and yet pro
tects things from getting out."
