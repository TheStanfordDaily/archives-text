## Card comes up short in surprising loss to Cal 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
You can chalk it up to complacency. You can
chalk it up to looking ahead to bigger oppo
nents. Or you can just chalk it up to the rivalry
itself. Either way, the No. 8 Stanford men's ten
nis team lost a match to Cal this past Saturday
that it should have won.

"I don't think there was any cause for con
cern," said sophomore Bradley Klahn. "We
knew it was going to be tough, but I think we all
agreed we would get the job done,"
After handily defeating Boise State 6-1 on
Friday, the Cardinal entered the rivalry match

with high expectations. Stanford met those ex
pectations early in the match, capturing the
doubles point. The duos of Klahn and sopho
more Ryan Thacher, along with freshmen Matt
Kandath and Denis Lin, both won to secure
the point.
On the singles side, Thacher kept the Cardi
nal's momentum going with a straight-sets vic
tory over No. 78 Jonathan Dahan, 6-3,6-0. Se
nior Richard Wire then went down, 6-3, 6-4,
but junior Greg Hirshman briefly put Stanford
back on track with a 6-3,6-3 victory.
Leading 3-1 with three matches left to play,
the Cardinal needed just one victory from
Klahn, Kandath or junior Alex Clayton. All

three players won their first sets, meaning
Stanford was one set away from clinching the
match.
Then the seemingly impossible for the Stan
ford tennis program happened: it lost six
straight single sets to give the match away. First
Klahn, the No. 18 player in the nation, lost the
last two sets 6-4, 7-6. Next to finish was Kan
dath, who lost 6-2,7-6.
It all came down to Clayton. The junior,
playing in the No. 2 spot for the Cardinal, could
not hold off the charge from Christopher
Konigsfeldt, dropping consecutive sets 6-4,6-4.
"I feel like normally, at least one
of us is going to pull out that win,"
Klahn said. "We usually don't lose
three setters after winning the first
set. I think it's a testament to them

and their ability to never give up."
While the loss to Cal is clearly dis
appointing, it is not devastating. The
match does not count toward Stan
ford's Pac-10 record, nor will it hin
der the Cardinal's chances of mak
ing the 64-team NCAA Tournament
in the spring.
What made the loss so surprising,
however, was that it came at home.
Prior to the Cal match, Stanford was
5-0 at home, losing a combined three
points.

One of those points came against
Boise State on Friday. With Clayton
out of commission due to an illness,
Stanford went with an improvised
lineup. On the singles side, the nor
mal three-through-six players got
bumped up a slot, with Lin filling in
the sixth spot.
On the doubles side, Klahn and
Thacher did not play and freshman
Walker Kehrer replaced Clayton.
The biggest beneficiary of the mix
up was sophomore Jamie Hutter,
who played in the three-spot along
side freshman Sam Ecker.
The match was Flutter's first since
nearly a year and half ago, when he
had to retire from a match due to in
jury.

"It was little surreal, because
[after] 15 months of being out of
competition, you almost forget what
it feels like," Hutter said. "I thought
my coach was joking when he told
me I was playing."
Hutter made the most of his op
portunity, winning 9-7. "It took me a
little bit to get back into the flow of
things," the Menlo Park native said.
"It was real rewarding getting a win
after the all the rehab I've been
through."

With the bitter taste of the Cal
loss in its mouth, Stanford has a
chance to redeem itself and its
home record this weekend as it
hosts No. 6 UCLA on Friday and No.
5 USC on Saturday.
"It's a great opportunity next
week," Klahn said. "Not too many
times you get a chance to hop back
on the train and see if you can get a
win over UCLA and USC. If we
keep improving, this little bump in
the road, it's not going to mean that
much."
