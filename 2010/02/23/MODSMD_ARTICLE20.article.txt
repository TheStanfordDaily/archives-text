## Card comes up short in surprising loss to Cal 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
You can chalk it up to complacency. You can
chalk it up to looking ahead to bigger oppo
nents. Or you can just chalk it up to the rivalry
itself. Either way, the No. 8 Stanford men's ten
nis team lost a match to Cal this past Saturday
that it should have won.

"I don't think there was any cause for con
cern," said sophomore Bradley Klahn. "We
knew it was going to be tough, but I think we all
agreed we would get the job done,"
After handily defeating Boise State 6-1 on
Friday, the Cardinal entered the rivalry match

with high expectations. Stanford met those ex
pectations early in the match, capturing the
doubles point. The duos of Klahn and sopho
more Ryan Thacher, along with freshmen Matt
Kandath and Denis Lin, both won to secure
the point.
On the singles side, Thacher kept the Cardi
nal's momentum going with a straight-sets vic
tory over No. 78 Jonathan Dahan, 6-3,6-0. Se
nior Richard Wire then went down, 6-3, 6-4,
but junior Greg Hirshman briefly put Stanford
back on track with a 6-3,6-3 victory.
Leading 3-1 with three matches left to play,
the Cardinal needed just one victory from
Klahn, Kandath or junior Alex Clayton. All

three players won their first sets, meaning
Stanford was one set away from clinching the
match.
Then the seemingly impossible for the Stan
ford tennis program happened: it lost six
straight single sets to give the match away. First
Klahn, the No. 18 player in the nation, lost the
last two sets 6-4, 7-6. Next to finish was Kan
dath, who lost 6-2,7-6.
It all came down to Clayton. The junior,
playing in the No. 2 spot for the Cardinal, could
not hold off the charge from Christopher
Konigsfeldt, dropping consecutive sets 6-4,6-4.
