# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Janiga leads Card past Sun Devils 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Friday's meet was a special one for the
members of the Stanford women's gymnastics
team, but for senior captain Carly Janiga, it
was a competition she will never forget. The
No. 8 Cardinal (8-2) won its 14th consecutive
meet against No. 24 Arizona State (2-7) while
tying a season-high team score, and Janiga
won three events, in addition to her all-around
victory. With a collegiate career best of 39.650,
the six-time All-American and defending Pac
-10 all-around champion was the primary con
tributor to the team's 196.675-195.900 dual
meet win over the Sun Devils in Wells Fargo
Arena.
Yet it wasn't just her scores that Janiga can
take pride in, though her career best of 9.95 on
balance beam, 9.925 on floor and uneven bars
and 9.85 on vault flirted with perfection.
Rather, the best part of the win for the
Pheonix-area native was that it took place in
her hometown in front of family, friends and
coaches who she has known for nearly her en
tire life.
"I always love going to compete at ASU,"
Janiga said. "I have been going to watch com
petitions there since elementary school, and
the judges are the same judges that have been
at meets throughout my gymnastics career.
This weekend was about going home and
being comfortable. It's always nice to be back
in that arena."
Her comfort was evident to everyone, es
pecially head coach Kristen Smyth. Smyth is
excited that, although Janiga has already had
such tremendous success, she continues to im
prove. She noted Janiga's strong start on bars
and the "beautiful" way in which she capped
off the night on the beam.
"It was special," Smyth said. "It was an in
spirational performance for everyone else."
And for Stanford this weekend, inspiration
and enthusiasm rooted within the squad was
the key. For the entire season, and especially
during away competitions, the team has been
striving to bring as much energy and passion as
possible. In such a large arena in Arizona, this
excitement was necessary to bring the confi
dence required to sustain the right level of ef
fort.
"We did extremely well managing and cre
ating our own energy. We brought a focus to
our work and what we were doing on the
floor," Smyth said. "So we did really well, and
we continue to build and make improvements
every single weekend."
The second focus of the team's efforts on
Friday was the ability to finish strong, a theme
that has been prevalent since the beginning of
the year. Though it has struggled with this in
the past, the Card was able to hit all six rou
tines on the beam at the end of the meet, plus
an exhibition.
"Up until this point we haven't even been
able to hit six for six," Smyth said. "But
Friday the girls competed and per
formed the work that they trained.
They made good strides for us in the
event that has been really difficult in
the past."
Sophomore Alyssa Brown did a
particularly fantastic job setting the
tone for the beam, in what Smyth
deemed a "flawless routine," despite a
slight bobble on the dismount. Brown,
with senior Allyse Ishino and junior
Danielle Ikoma, were the first three in
the event's lineup, and they created a
high level of confidence and excite
ment that allowed the three remaining
gymnasts in the rotation to relax and
perform exactly what they had prac
ticed.

Smyth and her team hope to take
this consistency into the rest of the
meets this season, starting with Stan
ford's final home quad-meet and Se
nior Night this Sunday against arch
rival UC-Berkeley, North Carolina
and Eastern Michigan. This competi
tion should be particularly enjoyable
for Ikoma and sophomore Catherine
Nguyen, both of whom have sisters on
the North Carolina team. The coaches
for both schools made a special effort
to arrange a competition at some point
during the season, knowing that they
had athletes in both programs.
The competition will honor the
four seniors on the team who have
contributed to the gymnastics pro
gram during the past four years:
Stephanie Carter, Blair Ryland,
Tenaya West and Janiga. Ishino, a sen
ior, will be returning to compete for a
fifth year. In what will be a much dif
ferent environment than the team has
experienced during home meets in the

past, the competition will take place in
Maples Pavilion. With space for more
fans and plenty of room for high ener
gy, the meet should celebrate the sen
iors in just the way they deserve.

Events will begin on Sunday at 2
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
