# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Janiga leads Card past Sun Devils 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Friday's meet was a special one for the
members of the Stanford women's gymnastics
team, but for senior captain Carly Janiga, it
was a competition she will never forget. The
No. 8 Cardinal (8-2) won its 14th consecutive
meet against No. 24 Arizona State (2-7) while
tying a season-high team score, and Janiga
won three events, in addition to her all-around
victory. With a collegiate career best of 39.650,
the six-time All-American and defending Pac
-10 all-around champion was the primary con
tributor to the team's 196.675-195.900 dual
meet win over the Sun Devils in Wells Fargo
Arena.
Yet it wasn't just her scores that Janiga can
take pride in, though her career best of 9.95 on
balance beam, 9.925 on floor and uneven bars
and 9.85 on vault flirted with perfection.
Rather, the best part of the win for the
Pheonix-area native was that it took place in
her hometown in front of family, friends and
coaches who she has known for nearly her en
tire life.
"I always love going to compete at ASU,"
Janiga said. "I have been going to watch com

the judges are the same judges that have been
at meets throughout my gymnastics career.
This weekend was about going home and
being comfortable. It's always nice to be back
in that arena."
Her comfort was evident to everyone, es
pecially head coach Kristen Smyth. Smyth is
excited that, although Janiga has already had
such tremendous success, she continues to im
prove. She noted Janiga's strong start on bars
and the "beautiful" way in which she capped
off the night on the beam.
"It was special," Smyth said. "It was an in
spirational performance for everyone else."
And for Stanford this weekend, inspiration
and enthusiasm rooted within the squad was
the key. For the entire season, and especially
during away competitions, the team has been
striving to bring as much energy and passion as
possible. In such a large arena in Arizona, this
excitement was necessary to bring the confi
dence required to sustain the right level of ef
fort.
"We did extremely well managing and cre
ating our own energy. We brought a focus to
our work and what we were doing on the
floor," Smyth said. "So we did really well, and
we continue to build and make improvements
every single weekend."
The second focus of the team's efforts on
Friday was the ability to finish strong, a theme
that has been prevalent since the beginning of
the year. Though it has struggled with this in
the past, the Card was able to hit all six rou
tines on the beam at the end of the meet, plus
an exhibition.
"Up until this point we haven't even been
