# Bright future for the Card

### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
Although I have used this
space to bemoan the de
mise of sports now that
football season is over,
this is turning into one of
the best times of the year for Stanford
athletics.

Women's basketball continues to
pile it on against seemingly every Pac
-10 foe. A 10th consecutive conference
title hardly seems like an accomplish
ment for a team whose only real com
petition comes in the form of the
UConn Huskies. The women have
played their final regular season home
games of the season, but we can all ex
pect to be seeing much more of them in
the NCAA Tournament in a few
weeks. A deep run in March Madness
seems likely, and it's not out of the
realm of possibility that women's bas
ketball could bring Stanford its first
championship of the 2009-2010 season.

Even men's basketball has shown
some signs of life in this rebuilding year.
The men got the road monkey off their
backs with a somewhat surprising road
sweep of the Oregon schools. And
while no one is comparing the Ducks
and Beavers to Kansas or Kentucky, or
even Cornell, a road sweep is a big step
forward for a program like Stanford.
With three conference games left in the
wide, wide open Pac-10, the Cardinal
could finish anywhere from tied for
first to last, so these couple of weeks
will be very interesting, not to mention
the season finale against archrival Cal.
And when the Pac-lOTournament rolls
around, anything can happen, so Stan
ford might have a better chance of
making the field of 65 than defending
champion North Carolina.

Both the men's and women's swim
ming and diving teams have been im
pressive of late as well. Each defeated
Cal in the respective Big Swims to close
out the season, and the men and
women enter the Pac-lOs as the No. 2
and No. 1 teams in the nation, respec
tively. With Olympic-caliber talent on
each team, both teams are making
strong runs toward possible national
championships.

As these teams (and more) wind
down their seasons and enter the post
season, several Cardinal teams are be
ginning their 2010 campaigns, and thus
far, the results have been very positive.
I got to witness firsthand as the
Stanford baseball team opened its 2010
season against Rice this weekend. The
Owls made it to the Super Regionals
last year and were expected to be even
better this year with a No. 5 preseason
ranking. The Cardinal, on the other
hand, came off a poor season by its high
standards, going 30-25 in 2009 and miss
ing the playoffs. Despite these struggles
and a number of top players leaving for
the major leagues (or the NFL in Toby
Gerhart's case), Stanford started the
season off with a bang, sweeping Rice
in three games. The young players in
particular gave reason for hope, as
Stanford's three starting pitchers were
sophomores, and its starting lineup in
cluded three freshmen. Although this
team is young, the future is certainly
bright for Stanford baseball.
Across the way, the Stanford soft
ball team doesn't need to rebuild. The
Cardinal has been dominant over the
years in Softball, and that success seems
to be continuing this year as Stanford
has won eight of its first nine games. A
number of freshmen, including Toby's
sister Teagan Gerhart as a starting
pitcher, have stepped up already to
support proven players like All-Amer
ican Alissa Haber. This 2010 season
could very well be the year Stanford
Softball breaks through to win a nation
al title.

The men's volleyball team, coming
off a split in southern California, re
mains the No. 2 team in the nation.
Stanford has proven to be capable of
defeating any team in the nation on any
given day, especially at home. And luck
ily enough, the 2010 NCAA Men's Vol
leyball Championship is taking place
right here on the Farm. With strength in
the middle in the form of Gus Ellis and
Garrett Werner, great defense from
libera Erik Shoji, a top setter in Ail-
American Kawika Shoji and a plethora
of hitters led by Evan Romero, Brad
Lawson and Spencer McLachlin, the
team has plenty of reason to be opti
mistic.

Stanford sports are so strong right
now that I really don't have enough
space to do every sport justice.
