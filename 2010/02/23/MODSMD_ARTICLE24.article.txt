# GOLD-EN GUARD
## 
### TOM TAYLOR 
If Stanford comes back from San
Antonio in April with another na
tional title for head coach Tara
VanDerveer, it might just be
down to destiny.

Many years ago, a young Van-
Derveer was roommates at Indiana
University with a girl named Pat
Gold. Now, with a long and storied ca
reer already behind her, VanDerveer
is in charge of the second-best
women's basketball team in the coun
try, and the daughter of her former
roommate and Austin Onwude is one
of her brightest stars.

VanDerveer was unaware of the
connection when redshirt senior guard
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude first came to
the Farm from Queens, N.Y., but it has
played a part in her time here.
"There's definitely a connection,"
VanDerveer said, "And in some ways I
think it's helpful for me in coaching
Ros."

At the start of the Pac-10 season this
year, the Cardinal suffered from injury
troubles, especially amongst the
guards.Though a talented player, Gold-
Onwude had not showed the consisten
cy and level-headedness that Van-
Derveer had wanted in previous sea
sons, but in this "guard vacuum," some
thing clicked.
"Personally I think she is the Pac-10
Defensive Player of the Year," Van-
Derveer said.
"When she's focused there's no one
[who's] gonna score on her," Van-
Derveer added. "She's a pit bull, and I
mean a good pit bull. She's just not
going to let them do what they want to
do, and I love it. I want it to rub off on
more people on our team."
In her senior year Gold-Onwude
has become an indispensable figure
among the starting lineup. Her de
fense is rock solid, holding top scorers
from the Washington schools and Ore
gon to a combined total of just 14
points in recent games. Her own aver
age of 9.0 points per game since Janu

ary is double the 4.5 she achieved in
previous seasons.

"I think it's just Ros growing up, Ros
becoming more mature," VanDerveer
said. "I think she had some spurts [in
previous years] of just some great
games. For us to go to the Final Four
two years ago, a lot was to do with Ros."
Sporting stitches above her right
eye from a hard-fought game against
Washington, the enthusiastic and
grown-up Gold-Onwude was clear
about her performances in the last few
months.

"Confidence that's the only
thing that's changed," Gold-Onwude
said. "Not only do I believe that I can
do it, I've shown myself that I can do it
and now I expect to. And it's not just
always on a scoring level, but just com
ing out there and just being a basket
ball player. Someone you have to
reckon with, whether it be on defense,
offense."

The longest-serving member of
the current squad, she is in her fifth
year at Stanford, having been forced
to redshirt her sophomore year with a
torn ACL. At the time, the year sitting
on the sidelines was a tough proposi
tion for a clearly competitive and
central member of the team, but it
was a defining moment in her colle
giate career.

"I remember being really disap
pointed," Gold-Onwude said, "But
[there were] two silver linings in that
cloud ... I think I'm a better player and
a better person from it. After all the
things I've learned and my time here at
Stanford I feel like there is nothing I
can't conquer or nothing that can de
feat me. I'll never give in."
In her first three years here, Gold-
Onwude was lucky enough to play with
arguably the best player ever to grace
the hardwood of Maples Pavilion
Candice Wiggins 'OB and that expe
rience helped turn her into the tough
and resilient defensive player she is
now.

"Ros was one of the few players on
the team who didn't back down from
Candice," VanDerveer said. "They
would get after it and be scrappy, and
they kinda played chippy, which is a
good thing."
"She knew that if she guarded Can
dice in practice, there was not going to
be anything harder in the game," Van-
Derveer added.
National title or not, in less than two
months Gold-Onwude's collegiate ca
reer will be done and dusted. With both
a bachelor's and master's degree under
her belt, and with the experiences and
contacts she has built up in her time on
the Farm, she is excited about her next
steps.
"I have a job offer or two now,"
Gold-Onwude said, "And always you
know for every hooper there's a little
bit of hoop dreams, so I may consider
going overseas."
If Gold-Onwude does hang up her
boots professionally, VanDerveer is
sure that basketball will still be an im
portant part of her future, if only as a re
lease for her energy and enthusiasm.
"I would hate to be playing in that
rec gym and she shows up," Van-
Derveer said, "Because all of a sudden
someone's going to be guarding you.
It's not just gonna be running up and
down having fun."
Whatever happens, Gold-Onwude
will remain a great ambassador for
Stanford and for the women's basket
ball program.
"This year has been the best year of
my Stanford career," Gold-Onwude
said, "Not only on a personal playing
level, but just with my teammates and
my coaches, and I'm just so thankful for
them being in my life, and I'm going to
treasure this year."
But it's not over yet.
"I hope it doesn't end until the
championship game," she added.

VanDerveer, it might just be
down to destiny.

Many years ago, a young Van-
Derveer was roommates at Indiana
University with a girl named Pat
Gold. Now, with a long and storied ca
reer already behind her, VanDerveer
is in charge of the second-best
women's basketball team in the coun
try, and the daughter of her former
roommate and Austin Onwude is one
of her brightest stars.

VanDerveer was unaware of the
connection when redshirt senior guard
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude first came to
the Farm from Queens, N.Y., but it has
played a part in her time here.
"There's definitely a connection,"
VanDerveer said, "And in some ways I
think it's helpful for me in coaching
Ros."

At the start of the Pac-10 season this
year, the Cardinal suffered from injury
troubles, especially amongst the
guards.Though a talented player, Gold-
Onwude had not showed the consisten
cy and level-headedness that Van-
Derveer had wanted in previous sea
sons, but in this "guard vacuum," some
thing clicked.
"Personally I think she is the Pac-10
Defensive Player of the Year," Van-
Derveer said.
"When she's focused there's no one
[who's] gonna score on her," Van-
Derveer added. "She's a pit bull, and I
mean a good pit bull. She's just not
going to let them do what they want to
do, and I love it. I want it to rub off on
more people on our team."
In her senior year Gold-Onwude
has become an indispensable figure
among the starting lineup. Her de
fense is rock solid, holding top scorers
from the Washington schools and Ore
gon to a combined total of just 14
points in recent games. Her own aver
age of 9.0 points per game since Janu

ary is double the 4.5 she achieved in
previous seasons.

"I think it's just Ros growing up, Ros
becoming more mature," VanDerveer
said. "I think she had some spurts [in
previous years] of just some great
games. For us to go to the Final Four
two years ago, a lot was to do with Ros."
Sporting stitches above her right
eye from a hard-fought game against
Washington, the enthusiastic and
grown-up Gold-Onwude was clear
about her performances in the last few
months.

"Confidence that's the only
thing that's changed," Gold-Onwude
said. "Not only do I believe that I can
do it, I've shown myself that I can do it
and now I expect to. And it's not just
always on a scoring level, but just com
ing out there and just being a basket
ball player. Someone you have to
reckon with, whether it be on defense,
offense."

The longest-serving member of
the current squad, she is in her fifth
year at Stanford, having been forced
to redshirt her sophomore year with a
torn ACL. At the time, the year sitting
on the sidelines was a tough proposi
tion for a clearly competitive and
central member of the team, but it
was a defining moment in her colle
giate career.

"I remember being really disap
pointed," Gold-Onwude said, "But
[there were] two silver linings in that
cloud ... I think I'm a better player and
a better person from it. After all the
things I've learned and my time here at
Stanford I feel like there is nothing I
can't conquer or nothing that can de
feat me. I'll never give in."
In her first three years here, Gold-
Onwude was lucky enough to play with
arguably the best player ever to grace
the hardwood of Maples Pavilion
Candice Wiggins 'OB and that expe
rience helped turn her into the tough
and resilient defensive player she is
now.

"Ros was one of the few players on
the team who didn't back down from
Candice," VanDerveer said. "They
would get after it and be scrappy, and
they kinda played chippy, which is a
good thing."
"She knew that if she guarded Can
dice in practice, there was not going to
be anything harder in the game," Van-
Derveer added.
National title or not, in less than two
months Gold-Onwude's collegiate ca
reer will be done and dusted. With both
a bachelor's and master's degree under
her belt, and with the experiences and
contacts she has built up in her time on
the Farm, she is excited about her next
steps.
"I have a job offer or two now,"
Gold-Onwude said, "And always you
know for every hooper there's a little
bit of hoop dreams, so I may consider
going overseas."
If Gold-Onwude does hang up her
boots professionally, VanDerveer is
sure that basketball will still be an im
portant part of her future, if only as a re
lease for her energy and enthusiasm.
"I would hate to be playing in that
rec gym and she shows up," Van-
Derveer said, "Because all of a sudden
someone's going to be guarding you.
It's not just gonna be running up and
down having fun."
Whatever happens, Gold-Onwude
will remain a great ambassador for
Stanford and for the women's basket
ball program.
"This year has been the best year of
my Stanford career," Gold-Onwude
said, "Not only on a personal playing
level, but just with my teammates and
my coaches, and I'm just so thankful for
them being in my life, and I'm going to
treasure this year."
But it's not over yet.
"I hope it doesn't end until the
championship game," she added.
