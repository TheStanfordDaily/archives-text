## Stanford leads web movement Univ. offers an expansive selection of online courses 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's undergraduate price
tag may have just gone up, but for the
casual physics learner, the University
is still a top destination for free online
educational content.

Standing in stark contrast to rising
tuition costs, a growing number of
American universities are providing
free online courses to the general
public and, by the numbers, Stanford
appears to be at the forefront.
With a total of 2,872 tracks on
iTunes and 868 videos on You Tube,
Stanford averages 219,000 downloads
per week on iTunes U and 114,000
views per week on You Tube, accord
ing to University communications
staff.
The University currently offers 73
courses on iTunes U. You Tube EDU
provides a subset of 53 courses from
the iTunes U site. According to Dan
Colman, the director of Continuing
Studies, 17 of the iTunes courses are
from the Continuing Studies
Program.
It all began with the Apple Digital
Campus Initiative in 2005, said Scott
Stacker, Stanford's director of Web
communications. The initiative led to
the genesis of Stanford's public
iTunes U site, the first of its kind.
"The idea began as away for fac
ulty to use iTunes, kind of in tandem
with Coursework ... to distribute
audio recordings of courses," Stacker
said. "Through that project, we actu
ally brought up the idea that iTunes
would make a great platform for dis
tributing recorded materials to the
public. That's really where iTunes U
began."
In the years that followed, Stocker
and his affiliates at the Office of
University Communications formed a
lasting partnership with the Continuing
Studies Program, which has been an
important provider of online content
for the University's iTunes U and
You Tube EDU platforms.
Today, one explanation for the
popularity of these online courses is
their broad appeal.
"My program, Continuing Studies,
presents courses that are interesting
to the larger public," Colman said.
"These courses were kind of a logical
fit for what they were trying to do."
Colman said that Stanford's ability
to record lectures and disseminate
them online fulfills the University's
mission of making education accessi
ble to the larger public.
"Anytime that we can give people
access to important information,
regardless of where they live in the
world or whether they have money or
not, I think it's a valuable thing to
do," Colman emphasized.
"For example, we taped a six
quarter sequence tracing the whole
arc of modern physics, and it's a very
popular course," he added. "It's pre
sented by a very important physicist

at the University."
That physicist is Leonard
Susskind, the Felix Bloch professor in
physics.

"It seemed to me that there was a
need for somebody to teach things
like physics to a broader audience
outside the Stanford student audi
ence, and I decided to try teaching a
continuing studies course," Susskind
said about his motivation.

"I get a fantastic amount of e-mail,
much more e-mail than I can possibly
answer," he explained. "Some it
comes from within the United Sates. I
would say the majority of it comes
from all over the world ... a lot of it

comes from India, from Pakistan,
from Iran, from South America, from
all over Asia."
Given the huge success of his
physics series, Susskind anticipates
that he will continue providing lec
tures for the Continuing Studies
Program and the University's online
platforms.
"I'll continue it for a while," he
said. "I enjoy it it's a lot of fun."
Stocker asserted that there are
many pedagogical reasons for mak
ing course content available online.
He noted that this option enables stu
dents to "review and augment what
they're learning in class."

"But our primary focus is making
a sampling of the courses available to
the general public ... We want to
showcase the best of teaching and
research on campus," he added.
In addition to reaching interested
scholars, these online classes attract
the attention of prospective students
and help alums reconnect with the
University.
"The original iTunes U project
was also a partnership with the
Alumni Association and we've
always seen that the alumni [are] one
of the largest audiences for this mate
rial," Stocked said.
Individual departments currently

are responsible for selecting lectures
to record, but Stocker maintained
that his office is always on the look
out for new material to post on the
Web.

"We're always looking for new
content, so if people have good sug
gestions for content they'd like to see
on the site, [they should] feel free to
contact our office," Stocker said.
