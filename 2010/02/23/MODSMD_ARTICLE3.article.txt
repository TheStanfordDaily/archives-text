## Stanford leads web movement Univ. offers an expansive selection of online courses 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's undergraduate price
tag may have just gone up, but for the
casual physics learner, the University
is still a top destination for free online
educational content.

Standing in stark contrast to rising
tuition costs, a growing number of
American universities are providing
free online courses to the general
public and, by the numbers, Stanford
appears to be at the forefront.
With a total of 2,872 tracks on
iTunes and 868 videos on You Tube,
Stanford averages 219,000 downloads
per week on iTunes U and 114,000
views per week on You Tube, accord
ing to University communications
staff.
The University currently offers 73
courses on iTunes U. You Tube EDU
provides a subset of 53 courses from
the iTunes U site. According to Dan
Colman, the director of Continuing
Studies, 17 of the iTunes courses are
from the Continuing Studies
Program.
It all began with the Apple Digital
Campus Initiative in 2005, said Scott
Stacker, Stanford's director of Web
communications. The initiative led to
the genesis of Stanford's public
iTunes U site, the first of its kind.
"The idea began as away for fac
ulty to use iTunes, kind of in tandem
with Coursework ... to distribute
audio recordings of courses," Stacker
said. "Through that project, we actu
ally brought up the idea that iTunes
would make a great platform for dis
tributing recorded materials to the
public. That's really where iTunes U
began."
In the years that followed, Stocker
and his affiliates at the Office of
University Communications formed a
lasting partnership with the Continuing
Studies Program, which has been an
important provider of online content
for the University's iTunes U and
You Tube EDU platforms.
Today, one explanation for the
popularity of these online courses is
their broad appeal.
"My program, Continuing Studies,
presents courses that are interesting
to the larger public," Colman said.
"These courses were kind of a logical
fit for what they were trying to do."
Colman said that Stanford's ability
to record lectures and disseminate
them online fulfills the University's
mission of making education accessi
ble to the larger public.
