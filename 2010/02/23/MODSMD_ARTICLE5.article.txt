## MC lays down the hammer 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While connecting his laptop to the projector in
Bishop Auditorium yesterday, popular blogger
Robert Scoble checked his Gmail account, then
hopped between Facebook, Twitter and Google
Buzz ahead of an Entrepreneurship Week talk on
social technology.
But before Scoble could so much as update his
Facebook status, someone in the audience sent a
Tweet to @scobleizer, pointing out that he, along
with 300 other business school students, had just
seen the contents of the blogger's Gmail inbox.
Later in Scoble's presentation, another panelist,
blogger Loic Le Meur, interrupted a tour of Google
Buzz by buzzing a "Hey Scoble" to the presenter.
And the final panelist, rap star MC Hammer,
retweeted comments from the audience to his 1.8
million Twitter followers throughout Monday's
hour-long lecture on social technology.
All the while, the attendees who had flocked to
the Graduate School of Business (GSB)
Facebooked, Tweeted, Buzzed andTwitpic-ed away,
proving that business school students and entrepre
neurial hopefuls in the room didn't need Scoble, Le
Meur or Hammer to tell them that social media was
the newest disruptive technology.
