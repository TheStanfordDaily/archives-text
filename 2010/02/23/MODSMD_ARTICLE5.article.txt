# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## MC lays down the hammer 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While connecting his laptop to the projector in
Bishop Auditorium yesterday, popular blogger
Robert Scoble checked his Gmail account, then
hopped between Facebook, Twitter and Google
Buzz ahead of an Entrepreneurship Week talk on
social technology.
But before Scoble could so much as update his
Facebook status, someone in the audience sent a
Tweet to @scobleizer, pointing out that he, along
with 300 other business school students, had just
seen the contents of the blogger's Gmail inbox.
Later in Scoble's presentation, another panelist,
blogger Loic Le Meur, interrupted a tour of Google
Buzz by buzzing a "Hey Scoble" to the presenter.
And the final panelist, rap star MC Hammer,
retweeted comments from the audience to his 1.8
million Twitter followers throughout Monday's
hour-long lecture on social technology.
All the while, the attendees who had flocked to
the Graduate School of Business (GSB)
Facebooked, Tweeted, Buzzed andTwitpic-ed away,
proving that business school students and entrepre
neurial hopefuls in the room didn't need Scoble, Le
Meur or Hammer to tell them that social media was
the newest disruptive technology.
They could see social media
fueled digital ripples forming around
the event itself.

For the length of the talk, the par
ticipants whose qualifications
were mainly determined by their
number of Twitter followers (MC
Hammer led the pack with over 1.8
million) struggled to frame social
media issues with the kind of rigor
normally seen at the GSB.

displace current methods.
"A lot of things are going to be
replaced because of real time access,"
Hammer said, mentioning print
newspapers as one method of con
tent delivery that he thought would
not survive.

Scoble also commented on the
rapidity of the social media world.
When you are following thousands of
people on Google Buzz, as Scoble
does, updates literally whiz by.
"It just keeps moving, all day, all
night," Scoble said. "You can get on at
2 a.m. and see Loic [Le Meur]
Twittering with his friends."
Le Meur, who, in true blogger
fashion, used a blog post rather than
PowerPoint slides to organize his
presentation, said that for his start
ups, he employs teams of social media
evangelists in opposite time zones to
make sure that his company's social
media footprint is tended to around
the clock.
The talk later turned to how com
panies big and small can use social
media to their advantage.
Scoble said that big companies
can use social media to appear more
personable. He cited Zappos as an
example: CEO Tony Hsieh, according
to Scoble, makes every employee use

Business School Dean Garth
Saloner Ph.D. 'B2 was the first to try
to bring an academic perspective to
the topic when he introduced the
panel. But Saloner pointed out that it
would be difficult, if not impossible,
to figure out what comes next in
social technology.
The progression of video games
from the text-based Colossal Cave of
the 1970s to today's Guitar Hero, he
said, illustrates that any predictions
should be treated with a grain of salt.

"When it comes to social media,"
he said, "We are still in the infancy."
Because social media is still large
ly undeveloped, Saloner cautioned
people against putting all their eggs
in one basket.

"It cannot be everything," he said.
"It is part of a set of tools."
But later in the discussion,
Hammer disagreed with Saloner's
idea that social technology shouldn't

Twitter so they all internalize that
they are brand ambassadors.
Even large corporations are get
ting in on the act.
"If I have problem with my
Comcast line, I go to @comcastcares,"
Scoble said. "That made me feel bet
ter about this brand that was a face
less mega-corporation."
But this being Entrepreneur Week
at Stanford, much of the talk's
emphasis was on how entrepreneurs
can take advantage of social technol
ogy-

"These tools have lowered the
barriers to entry. Now the barriers to
entry are here," Hammer said, point
ing to his head.
The music business, according to
Hammer, has always been a social
enterprise.

"We go from grassroots to main
stream," he said. But now, Hammer
said, the difference is that there does
not have to be a jury of record execu
tives standing between grassroots
and mainstream.

"This is the greatest opportunity
ever to be an entrepreneur,"
Hammer added.
