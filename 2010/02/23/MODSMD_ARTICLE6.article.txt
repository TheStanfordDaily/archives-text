## Clean-tech wave hits Farm Academia and businesses unite for green causes 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While cardinal and white have
adorned Stanford's halls for more
than a century, some University
researchers are favoring another
color green these days as
Stanford establishes itself as a
leader in the clean-tech, or green
tech, movement that has swept
Silicon Valley.
"Clean-tech" describes prod
ucts and services designed to
improve operational performance
or efficiency while reducing ener
gy consumption or pollution. A
product of the early 2000s, the
clean-tech movement was spear
headed in the Golden State: the
Cleantech Group and Deloitte
reported that California compa
nies accounted for $2.1 billion of

the $5.6 billion invested in clean
technology ventures in 2009.
Stanford's interest in environ
mentally conscious technology
long predates the clean-tech revo
lution, said Jim Sweeney, director
of the Precourt Energy Efficiency
Center (PEEC). The center is one
division of the larger Precourt
Institute for Energy, which
opened in 2006 with a $3O million
grant from Jay Precourt, B.A. '59,
M.S.'6O.
Sweeney, who has been a
Stanford faculty member since
1971, documented more than 100
energy research projects on cam
pus in 1978, decades before the
current clean-tech wave. In these
early years, projects were spread
across different departments, with
little opportunity for collabora
tion.
"We didn't have a strong insti
tutional structure that would pro

mote work on the environment,"
Sweeney said.
To provide more cohesive super
vision, Stanford established the
Woods Institute for the
Environment in 2004, an interdisci
plinary center for environmental
research. Jeffrey Koseff, the Perry L.
McCarty director of the Woods
Institute, said his center's goal is to
generate viable solutions to sustain
ability challenges of the new millen
nium.

"Stanford's [academic] model
encourages invention, and we have
research sponsored by a variety of
federal, state and nonprofit agen

ties," Koseff said.
He cited the Woods Institute's
Environmental Ventures Project as
one opportunity for the intersec
tion of academic and corporate
interests in green technology. Each
year, the Institute provides seed
funding for five research projects
related to sustainability proposed
by Stanford faculty. Last year's win
ning proposals included an analysis
of anthropogenic fires in Australia
and development of a technique to
convert poisonous nitrous oxide
waste into thermal energy.
"The focus is on finding solu
tions, not necessarily an end prod
uct you can put your hands on,"
Koseff said. "If a project has poten
tial, we'll work with researchers to
develop ongoing funding, which
could come from corporate
sources."

Franklin Orr, director of the
Precourt Institute for Energy, simi
larly emphasized that academic
research is a necessary precursor to
commercial development.
"Our goal is to do the funda
mental science that enables whole
new groups of processes and prod
ucts," Orr said. "We want to pro
vide the knowledge that fuels a set
of transitions and changes the way
people think about problems."

While the Woods Institute focus
es primarily on research in environ
mental science, the Precourt
Institute takes an interdisciplinary
approach that considers environ
mental policy economics and con
sumer behavior.

"In the U.S. alone, you have 350
million people making decisions
every day, most of whom are not
experts in energy" said Sweeney,

who submitted the original propos
al for the center. "You have to pay
attention to human behavior, which
is why you need the social sciences
pyschology, sociology, educa
tion."

Sweeney emphasized that ener
gy consumption is just as important
as energy production. To this end,
the Precourt Institute funds proj
ects that encourage collaboration
between academic, government
and corporate parties. Current
projects include economics profes
sor Larry Goulder's analysis of a
cap-and-trade system for carbon
dioxide emissions and electrical
engineering professor Balaji
Prabhakar's project to establish
economic incentives for off-hour
commute in India.

Last year, the Precourt Institute
won a $4 million grant from the

Department of Energy for an
upcoming project with the
Sacramento Municipal Utility
District (SMUD), researching elec
tric meters as a means of regulating
consumer energy use. The proposal
was a joint effort between the insti
tute and corporate interests,
Google and PG&E.
Such government collaboration
is a growing aspect of Stanford's
environmental research and the
larger clean-tech field.
Environmental engineering and
science professor Craig Criddle
currently researches techniques of
wastewater recovery through a
grant from the Woods Institute. His
project uses the Palo Alto water
treatment center as a test site.

"We usually think of wastewater
in a negative sense as something
that has to be treated and dis

charged," Criddle said. "But it has a
variety of potential applications
for example, irrigation and plumb
ing. For these things the water
doesn't have to be treated to the
same level as drinking water."
Though Criddle and other clean
tech advocates push the economic
and environmental benefits of
going green, they acknowledge that
the ultimate challenge is to con
vince the public.
"We have to find away to get
really large scale," Orr said.
"Renewables are out there but are
growing from a relatively small
base. Our energy bases are really
big, and I worry that the attention
span of the world public is not as
good as it should be."
