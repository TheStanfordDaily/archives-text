## Clean-tech wave hits Farm Academia and businesses unite for green causes 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While cardinal and white have
adorned Stanford's halls for more
than a century, some University
researchers are favoring another
color green these days as
Stanford establishes itself as a
leader in the clean-tech, or green
tech, movement that has swept
Silicon Valley.
"Clean-tech" describes prod
ucts and services designed to
improve operational performance
or efficiency while reducing ener
gy consumption or pollution. A
product of the early 2000s, the
clean-tech movement was spear
headed in the Golden State: the
Cleantech Group and Deloitte
reported that California compa
nies accounted for $2.1 billion of

the $5.6 billion invested in clean
technology ventures in 2009.
Stanford's interest in environ
mentally conscious technology
long predates the clean-tech revo
lution, said Jim Sweeney, director
of the Precourt Energy Efficiency
Center (PEEC). The center is one
division of the larger Precourt
Institute for Energy, which
opened in 2006 with a $3O million
grant from Jay Precourt, B.A. '59,
M.S.'6O.
Sweeney, who has been a
Stanford faculty member since
1971, documented more than 100
energy research projects on cam
pus in 1978, decades before the
current clean-tech wave. In these
early years, projects were spread
across different departments, with
little opportunity for collabora
tion.
