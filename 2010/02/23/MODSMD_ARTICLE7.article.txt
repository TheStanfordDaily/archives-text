Network (MSAN), in collaboration

night on "The Muslim World and
Democracy: Today and Tomorrow" in

CDDRL Director Larry Diamond
moderated a panel of three noted
speakers who shared their thoughts
on issues that MSAN proffered for
discussion.
The panelists were Abbas Milani.
the Hamid and Christina Moghadam,
Director of Iranian Studies at
Stanford and Research Fellow for the
Hoover Institution; Scott Carpenter,
the former Deputy Assistant

Marc Gerecht, Abbas Milani and Scott Carpenter.
the Senior Fellow for the Foundation
for Defense of Democracy.
Each speaker provided a distinct
outlook on democratization in the
Muslim world.
"There is Islam. But, as we think of
the United States as a nation-state, so
too should we be thinking about the
Muslim world as individual nation
states," Carpenter said.
Carpenter said he is hopeful about
future democratization.
"In all the Muslim majority coun

tries, they all have pretensions of
democracy," he said.
Commenting on the autocratic
leanings of many Muslim-majority
countries, Carpenter added, "We tend
to forget that our [United States]
institutions were born of the same
aspirations. George Washington was
offered a monarchy. Luckily, he
turned it down."
Milani addressed why democracy
experiments in the Muslim world
have failed in the past.
"One of the most recurring and
justified claims is that the Muslim
world has tended to not like criticism
or self-inspection," Milani said. "It is
one of the great maladies of the Arab
world."

Milani expressed his belief that
Islam and democracy are compatible
and further discussed whether
Islamic fundamentalism and democ
racy are compatible.
"I would posit that if you reduce
anything to one dogma, as is the way
with fundamentalism, then an ideol
ogy like democracy cannot coexist
with this fundamentalism," Milani
said. "Democracy posits that we do
not know all the answers. If we
know all the answers, which is
claimed in fundamentalist thought,
then the door for democracy is
closed."
"You cannot have a Muslim
democracy. You cannot have a Jewish
democracy. You cannot have a

Christian democracy," he added.
Gerecht highlighted some views
that may portray democracy in an
unfavorable light in Muslim states.
For example, Gerecht claimed that,
traditionally, women's social rights
have expanded under dictatorships.
Furthermore, he said that there is
a belief in the Muslim world that if
democracy were to grow, anti-
Americanism would also grow.
"Democracy will actually be a har
binger to a more religious society,"
Gerecht speculated, referring to a
belief held by some Muslims.
Though the event left much to be
debated, organizers were satisfied
that it served its purpose,
"The main goal was to pose some

hard questions that are generally not
posed in the Muslim world and create
an opportunity for the Muslim com
munity, and others at Stanford, to
hear these questions debated and dis
cussed in a public forum," said
Mohammad Ali 'lO, president of
MSAN.
Moreover, attendees stated that
the three speakers' diverse perspec
tives made for an engaging event.
"I was glad there was a difference
of opinion on the panel," said
Jennifer Leather 'l3. "The diversity in
views allowed for a more interesting
discussion."
