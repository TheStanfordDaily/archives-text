## SEXILED 
### SHAWNEE BAUGHMAN 
You're stranded, standing in the hallway
wondering what you're going to do next.
Only moments ago you'd been happily
making your way to your room, ready to

relax after a hard day's work, and then you
see it. How could this happen to you? It must be a
mistake, right? Wrong. There's only one reason for a
strategically placed sock on the door handle
you've been sexiled.

Making the beast with two backs, bumping uglies,
boning, boinking, doing "it," taking the skin boat to
tuna town no matter what you call it, sex happens.
It's a natural occurrence, but the cramped conditions
of dorm life give this age-old urge a new set of com
plications.

The touchy subject of the sock-on-the-door treat
ment elicits a variety of responses from roommates
on the outside of the door. Some are enthusiastic.

"I would feel excited for my roommate," said
Tessa Pompa T2. "Get some!"

Many students have friends elsewhere in their
dorms, so finding an alternative place to crash for a
night isn't a problem.

"It's always easy to find another bed to sleep in,"
said Katya Drobysheva 'l3.

But a main reservation among otherwise happily
sexiled students is the possibility of being sexiled too
often or during midterms.

"I totally wouldn't mind, unless it was happening
all the time," said Alex Sambvani 'l2.
Problems can also arise when students absolutely
must access their rooms. Students shared horror sto
ries of the awkwardness that ensued when they sim
ply needed their phones or homework assignments.
But in the modern sexiling era, the antiquated

sock-on-the-door has been mostly replaced by the
speedier, more direct text message.
Most students seem to be willing to give up their
rooms as long as they're given a bit of warning. But
they expect roommate communication to be a two
way street. Others, however, aren't accommodating.
"There are a lot of other places you can go," said
David Murguia 'l3. "You don't have to take a girl
back to your room."
Other options include, of course, her room but
also the stacks, the post office and dorm common
spaces.
"Yeah, we should just move a mattress into the
computer cluster," said Van Anh Tran 'l3. Both Tran
and Murguia are residents of Larkin.
At Stanford, students are given relative freedom
about when and how to sexile it's considered a
roommate issue and not regulated at a higher level.
That's not the case at other universities.
Just last year, the Tufts administration enacted a
policy stating that students were no longer allowed
to exile their roommates to engage in sexual activity.
Nor can students pursue sexual gratification when
there is another, uninvolved party in the room.
With Stanford's greater freedom comes greater
roommate responsibility. On the Farm, the sexiling
code of etiquette requires that sexilers give some
notice to their roommates before hitting the hay
with that special someone. The sexiled must main
tain a sense of humor and take one for the collec
tive team.
And, of course, please control that birthrate.
