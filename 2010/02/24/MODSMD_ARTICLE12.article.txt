## EDITORIAL ASSU Senate fails to engage the student body 
### 
tution.
These missing minutes appear to be an ex
tension of a greater shortcoming of this ASSU
Senate that its members continually neg
lect to really engage the student body. As such,
the Senate which holds considerable
power over student groups and campus poli
cies now appears irrelevant in the eyes of
many members of the Stanford community.
When an ASSU senator claimed that no one
would read the Senate's minutes if they were
published, they made this point all the more
clear. If the Senate feels that no one is interest
ed in the minutes it takes, then it should do
something to engage the student body.
The ASSU Executive has set a brilliant ex
ample in this respect, initiating dialogue with
the community through town hall meetings,
listening series and open communication. It is
a shame that the ASSU Web site is used al
most exclusively by the Executives the
Senate page on the site is mostly empty except
for brief descriptions of the senators, which
contain statements such as,"l expect to spend
plenty of energy towards outreach and com
munication with the student body to bring you
more of what you want." In fact, over half of
the senators listed some variation of "increase
student involvement" with the ASSU as one
of their top priorities for the year, with such
specific goals as creating "One Minute
Youtube Meeting Summaries." Well, the ship

As the University campaign season be
gins, many prospective candidates are
currently educating themselves on the
issues that are important to the Stanford com
munity. Candidates introducing themselves
and asking questions of students will soon fre
quent communal spaces on campus such as
dining halls and White Plaza. A year ago, the
current ASSU Senate made similar connec
tions with the student body, convincing the
community that they would engage and inter
act with us in order to better suit our needs.
Unfortunately, the Editorial Board feels that
this Senate has failed in this respect, epito
mized by the recent discovery that the Senate
has not posted its committee meeting minutes
to the ASSU Web site for the better part of this
year.

The Editorial Board will admit that we
appreciate the candor with which senators
responded to the charge that they had ig
nored their constitutional responsibility to
post minutes online for the Stanford commu
nity. At least one senator even stated on
record that he did not know that the Senate
was responsible for posting the minutes.
While an honest response, we find it hard to
believe that no one in the Senate found it im
portant to make this information available.
We find it easier to belie ve that these minutes
were not taken at all, or the quality was so
bad that they were not worth sharing. Even
so, we urge the Senate to publish these old
minutes in accordance with the ASSU consti-
