# GET IT RIGHT
## Poetry Time, Acrostic Ode to America 
### Erica Morgan 
44 /V mcr ' ca the Beautiful" the land
/\ of hope and strength.
A beacon to behold and often lauded at great
length.
But lately patriotic praise has seemed oddly
estranged,
And in its place has grown distaste for fea
tures once acclaimed.
Acknowledging our vim and verve has fallen
out of vogue,
As now it's only mockingly we speak of
"going rogue."
Thus this week I find myself indignantly com
pelled
To venerate the virtues that Americans have
held.
A:
Abundantly Ambitious and Amazingly
Adept,
We Approbate diversity and differences Ac
cept.
Americans Applaud our own Audacity and
nerve,
Awarding our Achievements with the honor
they deserve.
We seldom suffer Apathy; we're Active and
Adroit,
Avoidant of strong government. Alarmed
just at the thought.
M:
A "Melting pot" of Mixing Mores, America
emerged
From Motivated Migrants, who with com
mon goals converged.
And when we find we're hindered in a Mean
ingless debate,
We Move with haste to Mitigate Myopia and
hate.
America Maintains "Mystique" and ought
not be contrite,
But fiercely proud of progress and of Mili
tary Might.
E:
Explosive we accomplish goals with En
ergy and zeal,
Eager and Excited for a challenge's appeal.
Earnestly Enthused to seek and open Every
door,
Engaging in the Ever-present urge to go Ex
plore.
Elastic we can stretch ourselves to meet
the End desired,
Ecstatic we Express ourselves with fervor
thus inspired.

R:
Resourceful, using what we have, Receptive
and Robust.
We're Raised to be Responsible and do that
which we must.
We have diverse Religions, we Respond to
those in need,
We're Righteous and Respectful; we Revere
the U.S. creed.
Receptive to a foreign voice, Responsive
when Required,
We're Rapid in Reactions, self-Reliant,
Rarely mired.
I:
Insistent and persistent, we Intrepidly pursue
The Independent lifestyles that we value
through-and-through.
Industrious adventurous Americans Invent
Inspired Innovations that the cynics can't
prevent.
Inherent Ingenuity Incorporated still
Into our daily lives In which we Implement
free will.
C:
Compassion is a Common Cause; we're
Called by Charity
To aid and love and Care for those less fortu
nate than we.
We're Competent and Confident, Competi
tive and droll,
Creative, Contemplative, Curious and in
Control.
We Can't resist a Challenge, but we Can Col
laborate,
To overcome adversity and Compromise Create.
A:
Ambitious and self-driven, we will push our
selves to Act,
With Ardor and Agility, Ability and tact.
Amazing in so many ways, perhaps it's time
we should
Step back and so Appreciate the Assets and
the good.
To some, this may seem cheesy or at any rate
contrived.
But I assure the feelings pure from which it is
derived.
