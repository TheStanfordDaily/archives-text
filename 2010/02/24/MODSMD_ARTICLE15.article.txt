## New Faces in the Battle Against Cancer 
### Jack Cackler 
Modern medicine has made incredible
advances, more than doubling
human life expectancy from that of
our early hominid ancestors. The world of
medical research still faces many challenges,
however, and perhaps none is as universal as
the fight against cancer.

Cancer describes the unmoderated cell
growth of any region in the body and is gen
erally the result of prolonged genetic muta
tion. Sadly, while there are precautions that
can reduce cancer risk, given a long enough
lifespan, most people will eventually be af
fected by cancer in some form. The fight
against cancer is a cause that everyone, re
gardless of nationality, socioeconomic status,
race, gender and age can rally behind, and
modern medicine is leading the charge.
While much of modern cancer screening and
treatment has remained the same for the last
few decades, there are some emerging tech
nologies that could radically enhance our
ability to manage this disease in the years to
come.

Cancer detection and treatment has been
documented since at least 1500 8.C.E., when
Egyptian physicians described surgical treat
ment of tumors of the breast through cauter
ization. While Hippocrates theorized that
bloodletting and proper diet could ward off
cancer, most early treatment methods were
limited to surgical excision of observed, ex
ternal tumors.

The advent of modern microscopy led to
several major discoveries, including the abil
ity to accurately perform a biopsy, which
greatly improved tumor excision success. In
1863 Rudolf Virchow correctly deduced that
cancer was not only made up of malignant
cells, but could spread from cell to cell, and in
1890, David von Hansemann demonstrated
that cancer cells had abnormal amounts of
chromatin, predicting a genetic abnormality.
Wilhelm Rontgen invented the X-ray in
1895, which greatly aided in tumor detection,
particularly for internal tumors. It was fur
ther discovered as early as 1899 that X-rays
could kill tumors as well, and thus, modern

radiation therapy was born. Modern
chemotherapy emerged as an accidental dis
covery following a mustard gas attack during
World War II in 1943, when doctors noticed
that the white blood cells of soldiers were se
verely depleted. Doctors theorized that
chemical agents could be used to combat
tumor cells like white blood cells, and so from
a terrible wartime barbarity, chemotherapy
was born. A large portion of modern cancer
treatment relies on surgical excision, radio
therapy and chemotherapy.

treatment currently being re
searched that could hold great
promise for the future. John Kanzius
was not a cancer researcher, but
rather a radio operator and engineer
who developed non-Hodgkin's lym
phoma. Spurred on by his own dis
ease, Kanzius built on his knowledge
of radio waves to develop a system
that specifically targets cancer cells,
allowing healthy cells to survive.
One of the perils of all three
aforementioned procedures is that it
is very hard to make them specific:
while they can be successful in re
moving the cancer, they can also
have strong adverse effects on sur
rounding tissue. Kanzius developed
a procedure that localized gold
nanoparticles to a tumor site, and
then selectively heated just the gold
nanoparticles using radio waves,
causing the surrounding tumor site
to die, but sparing healthy tissue. The
system was successfully tested in
2005, and human testing may begin
soon. While Kanzius sadly died fol
lowing chemotherapy last year, his
ingenuity lives on and may one day
save many more from his fate.
The pursuit of treatment contin
ues. In 2007, researchers at Maas
tricht University in the Netherlands
turned to an unlikely ally to battle
cancer: bacteria. Using the knowl
edge that tumor cells generally have
low access to oxygen, Dr. Jan Theys
engineered Clostridium novyi, an
anaerobic bacteria of the same
genus as tetanus and botulism, to
help selectively destroy tumor cells.
Dr. Theys' Clostridia, far from caus

ing lockjaw, mature only around
tumor cells, and by altering the
Clostridia genes to secrete anti-can
cer agents, the Dutch researchers
were able to use them to selectively
destroy just the cancer cells, leaving
healthy cells intact. This technique is
particularly effective as convention
al chemotherapy can be ineffective
in oxygen-depleted cells. This tech
nique is expected to enter early clin
ical trials shortly.
Stanford has led the way in the
field of stem cell research since its
advent, most notably by first isolat
ing human stem cells in 1991. Stem
cell research has been intimately
tied with cancer research from the
beginning, and soon after, a method
to treat cancer was developed in
which, after cancerous cells were de
stroyed, healthy stem cells were
transplanted into a patient's bone
marrow to help regrow new cells.
The Stanford Cancer Center, and
particularly, the Ludwig Center for
Cancer Stem Cell Research and
Medicine, is currently investigating
methods to identify cancer stem
cells, and thus ways to combat cancer
at the source.

Unlike polio or small pox, which
can be remedied with a single vac
cine, cancer encompasses a host of
conditions that kill almost 8 million
people a year. There are a number of
promising new techniques being de
veloped that could aid in the fight
against cancer in the coming years
and help to bring that number down.
One day, maybe through the efforts
of many of you reading this, we will
prevail.

causing the surrounding tumor site
to die, but sparing healthy tissue. The
system was successfully tested in
2005, and human testing may begin
soon. While Kanzius sadly died fol
lowing chemotherapy last year, his
ingenuity lives on and may one day
save many more from his fate.
The pursuit of treatment contin
ues. In 2007, researchers at Maas
tricht University in the Netherlands
turned to an unlikely ally to battle
cancer: bacteria. Using the knowl
edge that tumor cells generally have
low access to oxygen, Dr. Jan Theys
engineered Clostridium novyi, an
anaerobic bacteria of the same
genus as tetanus and botulism, to
help selectively destroy tumor cells.
Dr. Theys' Clostridia, far from caus

ing lockjaw, mature only around
tumor cells, and by altering the
Clostridia genes to secrete anti-can
cer agents, the Dutch researchers
were able to use them to selectively
destroy just the cancer cells, leaving
healthy cells intact. This technique is
particularly effective as convention
al chemotherapy can be ineffective
in oxygen-depleted cells. This tech
nique is expected to enter early clin
ical trials shortly.
Stanford has led the way in the
field of stem cell research since its
advent, most notably by first isolat
ing human stem cells in 1991. Stem
cell research has been intimately
tied with cancer research from the
beginning, and soon after, a method
to treat cancer was developed in
which, after cancerous cells were de
stroyed, healthy stem cells were
transplanted into a patient's bone
marrow to help regrow new cells.
The Stanford Cancer Center, and
particularly, the Ludwig Center for
Cancer Stem Cell Research and
Medicine, is currently investigating
methods to identify cancer stem
cells, and thus ways to combat cancer
at the source.

Unlike polio or small pox, which
can be remedied with a single vac
cine, cancer encompasses a host of
conditions that kill almost 8 million
people a year. There are a number of
promising new techniques being de
veloped that could aid in the fight
against cancer in the coming years
and help to bring that number down.
One day, maybe through the efforts
of many of you reading this, we will
prevail.
