## New Faces in the Battle Against Cancer 
### Jack Cackler 
Modern medicine has made incredible
advances, more than doubling
human life expectancy from that of
our early hominid ancestors. The world of
medical research still faces many challenges,
however, and perhaps none is as universal as
the fight against cancer.

Cancer describes the unmoderated cell
growth of any region in the body and is gen
erally the result of prolonged genetic muta
tion. Sadly, while there are precautions that
can reduce cancer risk, given a long enough
lifespan, most people will eventually be af
fected by cancer in some form. The fight
against cancer is a cause that everyone, re
gardless of nationality, socioeconomic status,
race, gender and age can rally behind, and
modern medicine is leading the charge.
While much of modern cancer screening and
treatment has remained the same for the last
few decades, there are some emerging tech
nologies that could radically enhance our
ability to manage this disease in the years to
come.

Cancer detection and treatment has been
documented since at least 1500 8.C.E., when
Egyptian physicians described surgical treat
ment of tumors of the breast through cauter
ization. While Hippocrates theorized that
bloodletting and proper diet could ward off
cancer, most early treatment methods were
limited to surgical excision of observed, ex
ternal tumors.

The advent of modern microscopy led to
several major discoveries, including the abil
ity to accurately perform a biopsy, which
greatly improved tumor excision success. In
1863 Rudolf Virchow correctly deduced that
cancer was not only made up of malignant
cells, but could spread from cell to cell, and in
1890, David von Hansemann demonstrated
that cancer cells had abnormal amounts of
chromatin, predicting a genetic abnormality.
Wilhelm Rontgen invented the X-ray in
1895, which greatly aided in tumor detection,
particularly for internal tumors. It was fur
ther discovered as early as 1899 that X-rays
could kill tumors as well, and thus, modern

radiation therapy was born. Modern
chemotherapy emerged as an accidental dis
covery following a mustard gas attack during
World War II in 1943, when doctors noticed
that the white blood cells of soldiers were se
verely depleted. Doctors theorized that
chemical agents could be used to combat
tumor cells like white blood cells, and so from
a terrible wartime barbarity, chemotherapy
was born. A large portion of modern cancer
treatment relies on surgical excision, radio
therapy and chemotherapy.

The world of medical
research still faces many
challenges [...] and per
haps none is as universal
as the fight against cancer.
