# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

### ANNIE GODFREY, CAMPUS RESIDENT 
Dear Editor,
Thank you to Yanran Lu for her article
in 'Opinions' last Friday, '"She Consent
ed!' - the Blowjob Scenario Part I."
I'm grateful because I've been "that
guy." In my first real relationship, with my
first real girlfriend, back in high school, I
was aggressive. I was manipulative. I was
selfish. I knew boundaries, but got so
wrapped up in sex that in the moment, I
didn't care. I wheedled and begged and
blamed and made promises to get what I
wanted.
This was sweet little me, the kind, tal
ented, Stanford-bound kid who was pro
feminist, was best friends with more girls
than guys, and who picketed and protested
for women's rights and for support of rape
and sexual assault victims.
And then I read about myself in a pam
phlet on abusive relationships.
But that didn't make me stop. I got into
a cycle of plying my girlfriend for pleasure,
and then beating myself up and apologiz
ing to her and buying her presents and
telling her I loved her, and then letting my
conscience again slip out of my brain and
back down to my crotch. Rinse. Wash. Re
peat. For the 18 months she and I were to
gether.
After leaving her and high school be
hind, it took me another year and a half of
painfully living with myself to muster the
courage to apologize to her.
Today, even with her and I being on
good terms, and with my much greater
knowledge of who I am, and with my won
derful current relationship in which I try to
give my girlfriend a mile whenever she
gives me an inch, I'm still dealing with hor
rible guilt about that evil little part of my
mind.
I'm grateful to Yanran for reminding
me of my boundaries. This sexual aggres
sion is in a gray zone that's far from sexual
respect, but it seems isn't quite rape and
isn't quite assault. It's something that's
easy to dismiss, and it's also something that
can eat away at you, as you wrestle with
what's right and what's wrong.
It's absolutely something that takes
more than book smarts to deal with. To the
men of Stanford, who have the immense
burden of hormones that can take
over the kindest mind like Mr. Hyde
to Dr. Jekyll, remember that know
ing yourself is more important than
knowing anything you could learn in
a Stanford classroom.
Love,
ROBIN THOMAS'I2
Dear Editor,
As a resident of Stanford West
who drives and cycles across Cam
pus I am daily involved in near colli
sions with students on bikes. In the
face of the recent tragedy I am at a
complete and total loss to explain
why Stanford does not make the
wearing of helmets compulsory. The
conformist cool factor would look
after itself once every one does it,
particularly if helmets integrate cell
phone and rear vision mirror. It
would cost the University nothing.
The cost to each student is only
about 40 dollars and the benefit is
immeasurable saving another
life, avoiding another head injury
and sparing an innocent car driver a
terrible and life-long burden.
