## Combine looms for Gerhart 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
The NFL season is year
round, even if the games
only last for five months.
Case in point: the Combine
begins today, just two weeks
after the Super Bowl. Draft hopefuls,
start your engines.
One of those prospects, of course, is
Toby Gerhart, and there will be few
players with more at stake in Indi
anapolis than him.
A refresher course: the Combine is
a scouting catch-all, where all of the
top seniors and declared underclass
men descend on Lucas Oil Stadium
for a few days of skills workouts, posi
tion drills, measurements and inter
views. Players are quite literally dis
sected tested for speed, agility,
hops, strength, intelligence, decision
making and so on. It has become a
massive media event in recent years,
with NFL Network providing wall-to
wall coverage. With everyone on a
level playing field, the relative com
parisons are easy to make.
Some teams disregard much of the
song and dance because it, for the
most part, disregards what actually
happens on the field. One NFL execu
tive told Sports Illustrated's Peter
King that his draft board was 90 per
cent set because "guys go to the scout
ing Combine and they change their
grade on a player based on things that
have nothing to do with playing foot
ball. I'm convinced if you took the
stopwatches away from a lot of these
guys, most of 'em would not be able to
tell you whether they liked a player or
not."
Which, for the most part, seems
apt. We all go nuts when a player runs
a mid-4.3 40-yard dash. Instanta
neously, they seem to jump up the big
boards, which is why unproven
prospects like Darrius Heyward-Bey,
for instance, wind up in the top 10 of
April's draft.
But there are exceptions to the
rule, which brings us back to Gerhart.
Everyone knew Heyward-Bey was
fast; it was simply a matter of precisely
quantifying it. But with Stanford's
star, no one seems to have much of a
read on his speed, which has subse
quently led to a giant question mark
next to his draft status. He is projected
anywhere from the second to the fifth
round, with the ever-present caveat of
"let's see how he runs in Indy."
The rest of his game is fairly well
known. He's a superior athlete with
otherworldly intangibles. His patience
and brute force are upper echelon,
and his agility and lateral movement
are impressive for a man his size.
Watch five minutes of tape, and all of
this is wildly apparent. But then
there's the speed issue. Because most
of his runs were bruising takes that
rarely allowed him to demonstrate his
full motor, it's hard to place him in a
particular group most assume he's
somewhere around a 4.6 back, but
there's no hard evidence, and just like
his draft status, his projected time fluc
tuates between 4.4 and 4.7.
Gerhart ran below a 4.5 in high
school and is rumored to have run a
4.43 at Stanford, both of which would
be eye-opening times. A bruising back
that runs in that range is a rare com
modity. But those are certainly opti
mistic, and the Combine is known for
humbling players who think they're
faster than they are.
With so much uncertain, the stakes
are fairly high. Run slow, and Ger
hart's draft status will drop and his po
sition will (wrongly) come into ques
tion is he a fullback or a running
back? Run quickly, and not only does
the first round become a possibility,
but any queries about the correct spot
for him go out the window.
Of course, Gerhart has the benefit
of most setting the bar fairly low,
which means that even if he's in the 4.5
range, he'll be in good shape. Plus,
given his style, he may not need all 40
yards his initial burst in the first 10
yards is a decent indicator of how he'll
hit the hole at the next level.
He's been training in Irvine, Calif,
for the draft, particularly on his speed.
He knows where he has to impress.
While he has been coy about his cur
rent times, he has said publicly that he
wants to "turn some heads" in Indi
anapolis.
Of course, speed is not the end all,
and Gerhart could impress (or fail) in
other drills as well he has never

trained full time for football, as he
previously had to drop 15 pounds for
baseball season. The full extent of
what he can do when practicing
around the clock is still unrealized for
the general public. The three-cone,
for instance, which measures agility in
short bursts, could demonstrate his
surprising shiftiness. And then, of
course, there are the medical check
ups, where he'll have to grade out well
to maintain his status Yahoo's
Jason Cole reported yesterday that
Gerhart has "lingering injuries" from
his collegiate career.
ft will be a busy weekend for Ger
hart, but one in which a lot of ques
tions will be answered. Still, the em
phasis will be on his straight-line
speed there is perhaps no one drill
that is more important to a single
player.
Born to run or on a downbound
train? Only Gerhart can provide the
answer.

sition will (wrongly) come into ques
tion is he a fullback or a running
back? Run quickly, and not only does
the first round become a possibility,
but any queries about the correct spot
for him go out the window.
Of course, Gerhart has the benefit
of most setting the bar fairly low,
which means that even if he's in the 4.5
range, he'll be in good shape. Plus,
given his style, he may not need all 40
yards his initial burst in the first 10
yards is a decent indicator of how he'll
hit the hole at the next level.
He's been training in Irvine, Calif,
for the draft, particularly on his speed.
He knows where he has to impress.
While he has been coy about his cur
rent times, he has said publicly that he
wants to "turn some heads" in Indi
anapolis.
Of course, speed is not the end all,
and Gerhart could impress (or fail) in
other drills as well he has never

trained full time for football, as he
previously had to drop 15 pounds for
baseball season. The full extent of
what he can do when practicing
around the clock is still unrealized for
the general public. The three-cone,
for instance, which measures agility in
short bursts, could demonstrate his
surprising shiftiness. And then, of
course, there are the medical check
ups, where he'll have to grade out well
to maintain his status Yahoo's
Jason Cole reported yesterday that
Gerhart has "lingering injuries" from
his collegiate career.
ft will be a busy weekend for Ger
hart, but one in which a lot of ques
tions will be answered. Still, the em
phasis will be on his straight-line
speed there is perhaps no one drill
that is more important to a single
player.
Born to run or on a downbound
train? Only Gerhart can provide the
answer.
