# Tennis welcomes Rainbow Wahine
## 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford women's tennis team (6-
0) is one match away from Pac-10 dual play, but
before it gets there, it must take down the
Hawaii Rainbow Wahine (1-6) in a match
rescheduled from a month ago. With good luck,
the rain predicted for Wednesday will hold off
long enough to allow play to occur.
With the most recent ITA rankings out, Stan
ford fell three spots from No. 8 to No. 11, based
entirely off the play of other teams participating
at the ITA National Indoor Championships.
However, five Stanford players were ranked in
the top 70 individually. While the women say
they do not closely follow the rankings, they do
pay attention to where they stand.
"It isn't critical, but it legitimizes us," said
head coach Lele Forood. "That is how I would
put it. It's important for us to know that we've
done well enough for all those people to be indi
vidually ranked."

Stanford has run through its competition so
far and seeks to continue its dominance going
into league play. With four shutouts on the sea
son, wins have been commanding against an
early schedule that includes four ranked teams.
"It's been going really well," said junior Car
olyn McVeigh. "We've played a lot of top
schools, not top 10, but our trip to Texas was re
ally key to realize how good we are as a team
and to finally put all our hard work in practice
into match play."

Hawaii has had a totally different season. Its
one win came over Cal State Fullerton 6-1, but
the Rainbow Wahine suffered several heart-

breaking losses. These include three losses by
the score of 4-3 against Nevada, Loyola Mary
mount and San Diego State.The Hawaii women
could easily be sitting on a winning record if
those matches had gone the other way.
"They probably won't be as tough of a match
as the schools this weekend, but every day is a
different day," McVeigh said. "Schools will bring
their best against us simply because we're Stan
ford, and they can do that."

Stanford and Hawaii met in a fall exhibition
that helped both teams define their starting line
up. The Cardinal prevailed 5-2, sweeping the
doubles before losing at the No. 3 and No. 6 sin
gles spots. Several major lineup changes have
occurred since then. Freshmen Mallory Bur
dette and Stacey Tan have solidified their hold
on the No. 2 doubles spot, and the two switch off

at the No. 3 and No. 4 singles spots, but have
played nowhere else since then. McVeigh, ab
sent from the exhibition, has returned to the
lineup after a bout of tonsillitis to play both sin
gles and doubles.

"I'm all better," she said. "It was only five or
six days, so it could have been worse. I got the
full practice in [Monday], hit a bit over the
weekend on the ball machines, and it was nice
being back out there on the court."
The freshmen have had a major impact on
the team since their entrance into the starting
lineup. Mallory Burdette, ranked 24th in the na
tion in the most recent polls, has amassed a 17-3

record in total and a 5-1 dual match record. Her
one loss came in a 10-point tiebreaker in the
third set against TCU's KatariinaTuohimaa 5-7,
7-6 (4), 10-5. At this pace, she stands to equal or
surpass her sister Lindsay Burdette senior
captain this year in overall record for her
freshman year. Unfortunately, neither will like
ly be able to match eldest sister Erin's 43-7
freshman record from 2001-02.

"Mallory's been phenomenal so far," Forood
said. "She's done really well, [she's] an extreme
ly spirited competitor. If Mallory flirts with

GAME NOTES: Women's tennis will look to continue its
blistering home form as it hosts Hawai'i on the Farm
tonight. The Card swept both Sacramento State and
Boise State in its first two matches in its current three
match homestand, and is hoping to build even more
momentum before it travels down to Los Angeles this
weekend to take on UCLA and USC.

Stanford women's tennis begins its conference season soon, but first must take care of visiting
Hawai'i today. The Cardinal has swept both of its previous two matches at home.
Erin's record ... that would be a
phenomenal season."
Fellow freshman Tan debuted on
the ITA rankings at No. 54 and is
right behind Mallory at a total record
of 15-4 total, 5-2 in dual play. The two
have combined for a ranking of No.
37 in doubles and a 13-3 record over
all 5-1 in dual play.

All this success is vital toward
building momentum going into this
weekend's matches against UCLA

and USC. While they don't count for
conference standings, the matches
will be a significant indicator of
where the team is at this point in the
season.

"We're gonna have fun," Forood
said. "We look forward to getting
some conference matches in. Even
though they're the non-counters, it's
always good to play the L.A.
schools."

Stanford plays Hawaii at home
today at 1:30 p.m., and then will play
at UCLA on Friday and USC on Sat
urday.
