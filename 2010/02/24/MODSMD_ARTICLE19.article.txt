# GYMNASTICS EARNS SECOND
## 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's gym
nastics team placed second with a
team total of 354.7 at the Pacific
Coast Classic in Oakland last Satur
day. The meet is considered one of
the premier gymnastics competi
tions in the U.S. and serves as a plat
form to support men's collegiate
athletic programs. The competition
featured the defending national
champion Cardinal against Cal,
lowa, Arizona State and Washing
ton, along with the Japanese Colle
giate All-Star Team, who won the
meet with a 358.8. Cal came in third
with a 349.45.

Japan's top gymnasts, excluding
national team members, competed
at the event for the international
competition and cultural experi
ence. The team has close ties with
Stanford since its coach, Mutsumi
Harada, a Japanese Olympian in
2000, was previously an assistant
coach at the Farm.

Juniors Tim Gentry and Josh
Dixon had a consistent meet on all
six events. Gentry placed second in
dividually in the all-around with an
88.5 while Dixon placed fifth.
"As a team, we put up a good
score with a mediocre competition,"
Dixon said. "We were consistent
with what we had shown in practice;
however, that being said, there is still
a long way to go, and work to be
done."

"354.7 is a great team score for
this point in the season," Gentry
added. "We didn't have the greatest
meet, but still put up a decent score,
and we will be looking to build on
that score from here on out."

Highlights from the No. 2 nation
ally-ranked floor team included
Dixon's 14.8 and Gentry's 14.85.
Freshmen Eddie Penev is ranked
No. 2 nationally on floor and put up
the team's highest score at a 15.4.
Redshirt junior Lucas Hughes hit
his routine for a 14.45 on pommel

horse and No. 1 nationally-ranked
Gentry flashed the highest score of
the night with a 15.45 on rings.
Standout high bar routines came
from Dixon's 14.8 and redshirt soph
omore Abhinav Ramani's 14.4.

On the parallel bars, redshirt
freshman Cameron Foreman and
redshirt junior Nick Noone hit solid
routines for a 14.4 and 14.3 to help
Stanford pull ahead of the other
NCAA teams. Another highlight of
the meet was Hughes' clean parallel
bar set that produced a 14.1.
Stanford is known for its high
scores from its No. 3 nationally
ranked vault group, and this meet was
no exception. Junior Alex Buscaglia
procured a 16.05 with his half twist
entry onto the vault and one-and-a
half twists off (Yurchenko half on
rudi off is the technical name for it).
Penev also did well for a 15.95. All
arounders Gentry and Dixon scored
a 15.9 and 15.7, respectively, to aid the
Cardinal in scoring the highest event
score of the night.

The team will continue to assess
the aspects it needs to improve on
after each meet and will build upon
its performances each week as the
men gear up for NCAA Nationals in
April.

"We show so much promise be
cause we have so much depth in mul
tiple lineups," Dixon said. "This is
something that we all take comfort
in; however, it keeps us all on our
toes and pushes us to be even better
than we were the week before."

"Our routine hit percentage is
going up, and our execution is get
ting better, as well," Gentry added.
"We have a few minor things to
work out, but as long as we stick to
the training, we will be ready for the
post season."
The Cardinal men are gearing up
for their next meet against No. 1
Michigan at home in Burnham
Pavilion on Saturday at 7 p.m.
