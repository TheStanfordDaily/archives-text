# Stanford just like the Olympics
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
For all of you who don't know, the Olympic
Village makes the Playboy Mansion look
like a SLE dorm on a Tuesday night. Com
bine two parts testosterone, one part compe
tition, one part internationalism and one
part youth, and you'll get some, umm, action.
The stories from past Olympic Villages are leg
endary. In the 1988 Seoul Games, the night after the
swimming events had ended, the British Olympic As
sociation found so many used condoms on the roof of
the British team's housing unit,it sent out an order ban
ning outdoor sex.
At the 2008 Games in Beijing, Olympic officials

provided 100,000 condoms to the athletes at the Vil
lage, or about 10 per Olympian.
In Vancouver, U.S. snowboarder Scotty Lago was
sent home from the Olympics due to the fallout from a
photo of a girl biting into his gold medal placed conve
niently near a certain male body part.
You get the idea.
Olympians put their lives on hold for years at a time.
Early-morning workouts. Controlled diets. Grueling

training sessions. When they finally have a few days to
themselvesjt is only natural that they are going to blow
off some "steam."

Where else do you see people pulling insane hours,
dedicating themselves to one small field, and abusing
their bodies for some higher goal? How about Stan
ford students during finals week?
Think about it. You've got three finals in three days.
You park yourself in Green Library from sunrise to
sunset,poring over your Math 51 bookjearning every
thing there is to know about finding the null space of
the matrix. You emerge for meals—nor-
mally nothing more than dining hall pizza
and soft serve. You return to the library
and dope yourself up with 5 Hour Ener
gy and various other caffeine providers.
Finally, after an all-nighter, you take your
final and hope for the best.
It's the Nerd Olympics.
No, I'm not expecting the roof of
Wilbur Hall to be littered with used con
doms come the last day of finals This isn't
astate school.no matter how many nights
you spend in ChiTheta Chi.
But it isn't just during the last days of
Finals Week where Stanford starts to re
semble the Olympics.

Think back to the first day of fresh
man year. You approach your freshman
dorm, and all your RAs start cheering
your name. Opening Ceremonies?
Throughout your four years, Presi
dent Hennessy, Vice Provost Bravman
and Dean Julie constantly tell you how
great you are and how high the expecta
tions are for you. Constant media pres
sure?
You put your body through hell trying
to finish a paper or study for a midterm.
Intense training?
Maybe, just maybe, Stanford channels
the inner Olympian in all of us. The idea
isn't as far-fetched as you may think. Two
years ago in Beijing, current and former
Stanford athletes collected 25 Olympic
medals.
Stanford produced 48 Olympians in
all for the last Summer Games. For com
parison, Israel had 43 total. If Stanford

were its own nation, it would have more
sent more athletes to the Beijing Games
than 145 other countries.
Clearly, something about the Stanford
experience lends itself nicely to the
Olympic experience. The support, expec
tations and dedication are ingrained into
Stanford students. So is the familiarity of
living and competing with people of other
nationalities —in my residence, I count
ed 13 different ethnicities
Is there a better place to prepare you
for the demands and temptations of the
Olympic Village than Stanford?
Hell, even Vaden Health Center
hands out free condoms every quarter —
about 10 per student.

Mike Lazarus probably just set the
record for most condom references in a
Daily sports column. Send congratula
tions to mlazanis@stanford.edu.
