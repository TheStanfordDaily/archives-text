# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## No letting up after road tests 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
Following a grueling weekend in
southern California, the Cardinal
men's volleyball team returns to the
Bay Area for two matches this week.
Stanford (8-4, 7-4 MPSF) faced
two top-five teams last weekend,
falling to No. 4 Pepperdine (7-4,7-3)
on Friday before taking down No. 3
USC (8-5,6-4) on Saturday.The Car
dinal played well on offense in both
matches, hitting a season-high .495
as a team against Pepperdine and a
respectable .346 against USC, but
played significantly better overall
against the Trojans, recording 59 digs
to only 14 against Pepperdine.
"A big reason for the difference
in the results of this past weekend
was our defense, particularly block
ing and digging," said sophomore
outside hitter Brad Lawson, who led
the Card in kills against USC.
The match against USC was a sta
tistical gold mine for the Card, with
three players Lawson, senior op
posite Evan Romero and junior out
side hitter Spencer McLachlin
recording double-digit kills. On the
defense side of things, Lawson, sen
ior setter Kawika Shoji and sopho
more libero Erik Shoji all recorded
double-digit digs, and the duo of
sophomore middle blocker Gus
Ellis and senior middle blocker Gar
rett Werner combined for 16 blocks.
The Cardinal hopes that its next
two matches, against Division-11l
UC-Santa Cruz on Wednesday and
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) opponent Pacific on Friday,
will fit more into the USC mold. For
tunately for the Cardinal, neither of
these opponents is quite as strong as
the team's competition last week,
but that does not mean the team will
be complacent.
"One thing that should motivate
us to stay focused for the upcoming
matches is the fact that eight teams
in our league are within one loss of
the top of the conference," Lawson
said. "At the outset of the season, we
promised that we would respect
every team, regardless [of] if they
were a No. 1 powerhouse or a team
vying for their first win in the MPSF
a goal that will also help us stay
focused and on track this week."
Against both of its opponents this
weekend, the Cardinal will need this
focus to avoid an upset.
Although Santa Cruz plays in Di
vision-111, it is one of the top teams
in the division, ranked No. 2 in the
country as of last week. Additionally,
in an earlier match this season be
tween the two teams, Santa Cruz
managed to take a set from the Card
before falling in four sets.
Pacific is also an opponent the
Card may need to watch out for.The
Tigers are at the bottom of the
MPSF, not having won a conference
game all season, but in a conference
as talented and deep as the MPSF,
any team is a potential threat. Pacif
ic is no exception, and j ust last week,
the Tigers took two sets from No. 3
USC before falling in five.
Last time the two teams met,
Stanford got a much-needed con
ference win over the Tigers at
Maples Pavilion in four sets.
Romero and Lawson led the Cardi
nal with 17 kills each, while the
Tigers were led by redshirt fresh
man outside hitter Taylor Hughes
and sophomore outside hitter Flori
an Gornick, who had 22 and 16 kills,
respectively. Stanford will again be
fighting for a much-needed win
against the Tigers, as it looks to im
prove on its current fifth-place posi
tion in the conference.

Stanford's game against UC-
Santa Cruz will take place at 7 p.m.
tonight in Maples Pavilion, while
the game against Pacific will start at
7 p.m. on Pacific's campus in Stock
ton.
