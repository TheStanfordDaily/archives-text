## 12 leave Cardinal Football 
### – Wyndam Makowsky 
A dozen players have left the Stanford football pro
gram, the Athletics Department confirmed late Tuesday
afternoon.
Among the notable departures are linebacker Nick
Macaluso, offensive lineman Bert Mcßride and safety
Sean Wiser.
Macaluso started 16 games in his Cardinal career, in
cluding four last season, while Mcßride was a valued re
serve who saw extensive playing time in Stanford's line
men-heavy diesel package in 2009. Wiser, who tallied
eight starts in 2008, was forced into a medical retirement.
Outside of Wiser, the Athletics Department would not
disclose the reasons for the athletes' departures.
Other players included cornerback Mark Mueller,
who saw significant action on special teams, and Travis
Golia, who was the Cardinal's kickoff specialist early in

2008 but lost the battle for place-kicker in 2009.
The rest of the list includes wide receiver Marcus
Ranee and linebacker Jonathan Frink, both of whom bat
tled persistent injuries throughout their careers, back-up
long snapper Andrew Fowler, cornerbacks Marcus Turn
er and Ryan Ballenger, fullback Liam McNally and wide
receiver Brad Busby.
One player is still in limbo: offensive tackle Matt
Kopa, who began the season as the Cardinal's starting left
tackle. After a fractured foot sidelined him for practical
ly all of 2009, Kopa applied for a medical redshirt in an ef
fort to get a sixth year of eligibility. Senior Assistant Ath
letic Director Jim Young said that "Kopa's status is still
under appeal with the NCAA." Kopa, expected to com
pete for a starting spot if he returns healthy and is grant
ed another season, would be out of eligibility if the
NCAA denies his request.
