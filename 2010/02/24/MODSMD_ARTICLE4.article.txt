# Yichao Wang remembered
## The
						loss of a Ph.D. student called "a heavy blow for everyone" 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The death of Yichao Wang, a visiting
Chinese doctoral student, of complications
after a bicycling accident on Feb. 3 has both
saddened Stanford community members and
spurred many to take action to heighten bike
safety awareness on campus.
"It's a heavy blow for everyone here,
because even though he was here only for a
very short time, everybody knew him," said Dr.
Martin Reinhard, Wang's local host in the
department of civil and environmental engi
neering. "He was not just an observer â€”he
interacted quite strongly with people and had
his own ideas."

A memorial service is set for Saturday at 11
a.m. in Mountain View.

Wang, an exchange researcher from
Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in
Singapore, had researched since January the
use of membranes in removing trace organic
contaminants from recycled water. According
to Reinhard, Wang was well into his work, and
his loss represents a very serious setback for
researchers at NTU.
Professor Chuyang Tang Ph.D. 'O7, Wang's
adviser at NTU, encouraged Wang to come to
Stanford to learn laboratory techniques to
bring back to Singapore.
"He fulfilled a very important function,
namely to connect different countries, universi
ties and laboratories," Reinhard said. "We
depend on people who are willing to go out,
meet other people, exchange and interact with
people elsewhere."
His loss also came as a great blow to his col

leagues at the laboratory, though he had only
been at Stanford for about two months and
in the lab since just January when the acci
dent occurred.

One of Wang's peers, another doctoral stu
dent in the Reinhard group who asked for
anonymity while mourning, told The Daily in
an e-mail, "People liked how smiling and out
going he was. Yichao was [a] very cheerful,
always smiling, energetic person. He was very
intelligent and hard working, thirsty for knowl
edge."

The question of bike safety on campus has
also come under scrutiny in light of the accident.
Wang was not wearing a helmet on Feb. 3.
Reinhard noted that from the perspective of
a relatively newly arrived international student,
