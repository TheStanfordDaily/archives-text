## Alums team up to create global health nonprofit FACE AIDS co-founder starts Global Health Corps 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
After co-founding FACE AIDS in
2005, Jonny Dorsey 'O9 sought to fur
ther expose young people to careers
in global health. Now on a mission
for global health equity, Dorsey,
Dave Ryan 'O7 and Katie Bollbach
'O9 have teamed up with Barbara
Bush, daughter of former president
George W. Bush, to found the non
profit Global Flealth Corps (GFIC),
now in its first full year of operation.
Inspired by City Year and Teach
for America, Global Health Corps
engages people 30 years old and
younger to use their skills to over
come today's global health chal
lenges. For 13 months, fellows partner
with an existing nonprofit health
organization to better the conditions
of the community around them.
According to Dorsey, the program
is aimed at improving the pipeline to
global health careers. The founding
team was initially united by their
interests at the AIDS2O3I Summit

held by Google two years ago, which
focused on how to engage young
people in the fight against global
AIDS.

"From our time at the summit and
our work with FACE AIDS, what
was clear is that we needed away to
empower the talented young people
who badly want to use their skills to
build better health systems around
the world," Dorsey said.
GHC works in a variety of loca
tions, both domestic and internation
al. Internationally, fellows can be
placed in Rwanda, Malawi and
Tanzania, while domestically, fellows
can be placed in Newark, N.J. or
Boston, Mass.

The two main organizations that
the GHC has partnered with are
Partners in Health and the Clinton
Health Access Initiative.

Once placed with an organization,
fellows are then matched with a part
ner. In foreign countries, Americans
are matched with a local fellow, and
vice versa. Each pair consists of one
international fellow and one in-coun
try fellow, and updates of their
progress are posted through blogs at
fellows.ghcorps.org.
So far, the tone of the blogs con-
veys that the program has been successful,
with positive experiences reported from the
fellows on the GHC Web site.

Dorsey cited one successful example of a
pair of fellows who were working on supply
chain management. In six months, they man
aged to develop a computer-based system
for monitoring the entire drug supply in the
Central Medical Store in Zanzibar,
Tanzania. Previously, the paper-based sys
tem led to stock-outs, inconsistent treatment
and preventable deaths.
"[One of the fellows] never thought he'd
use his degree to do this service, but now he
is committed to making a meaningful impact
serving his fellow citizens," Dorsey said.
Currently, the program is in its first year,
with an inaugural class of 22 fellows selected
out of an applicant pool of more 1,200 peo
ple. Dorsey notes that program will be
expanding to support 36 fellowships in years
to come.

The GHC is funded through donations
from private individuals, foundations and

corporations, including
Google. However, funding «
challenges may pose a
problem due to the economy.
"Many people realize that
the only way we can take on
these massive global health
challenges is by fully capi
talizing on the passion,
skills and energy of our
generation," Dorsey said.
"That said, the economy
is pretty rough, and we do
need more support."
Fellows are trained by .
the Stanford University
Center for Health Policy for two
weeks in the summer, with the first
summer training program
launched last July. The course
work consists of language, cul
ture and leadership courses.
Fellows come from a wide range of aca
demic backgrounds, including architecture,
design, and computer science, according to
professor of medicine and director of the
Global Health Programs in medicine
Michele Barry, who is an advisor for GHC.
GHC Fellow Andrew Paterson 'O6 is now
working with the Access Health Initiative in

Tanzania. Applying the skills
» learned from his science,
technology and society
degree, Paterson said he now
incorporates his love of data
\ and science with his interest in
\ global health and social jus
tice to improve the supply
chain of important medi
cines from capital cities to
rural health centers.
"I wanted to be transi
tioning from being just use
ful for the sake of being use
r ful to being meaningful,"
Paterson said.
Barry is optimistic that
the organization will grow and con
tribute even more to the global
health care access movement.
"Over the next several

years, as the corps grows and its alumni take
leadership positions throughout their
respective countries, it will play a big role in
driving resources and creating innovative
programs in the global health field," Barry
said.
