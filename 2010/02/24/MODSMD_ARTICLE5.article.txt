### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
After co-founding FACE AIDS in
2005, Jonny Dorsey 'O9 sought to fur
ther expose young people to careers
in global health. Now on a mission
for global health equity, Dorsey,
Dave Ryan 'O7 and Katie Bollbach
'O9 have teamed up with Barbara
Bush, daughter of former president
George W. Bush, to found the non
profit Global Flealth Corps (GFIC),
now in its first full year of operation.
Inspired by City Year and Teach
for America, Global Health Corps
engages people 30 years old and
younger to use their skills to over
come today's global health chal

with an existing nonprofit health
organization to better the conditions
of the community around them.

is aimed at improving the pipeline to
global health careers. The founding
team was initially united by their
interests at the AIDS2O3I Summit

held by Google two years ago, which
focused on how to engage young
people in the fight against global
AIDS.

"From our time at the summit and
our work with FACE AIDS, what
was clear is that we needed away to
empower the talented young people
who badly want to use their skills to
build better health systems around
the world," Dorsey said.
GHC works in a variety of loca
tions, both domestic and internation
al. Internationally, fellows can be
placed in Rwanda, Malawi and
Tanzania, while domestically, fellows
can be placed in Newark, N.J. or
Boston, Mass.

The two main organizations that
the GHC has partnered with are
Partners in Health and the Clinton
Health Access Initiative.

Once placed with an organization,
fellows are then matched with a part
ner. In foreign countries, Americans
are matched with a local fellow, and
vice versa. Each pair consists of one
international fellow and one in-coun
try fellow, and updates of their
progress are posted through blogs at
fellows.ghcorps.org.
So far, the tone of the blogs con-
