# CARDINAL READY FOR PAC-10s
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After yet another undefeated dual
meet season, the Stanford women's swim
ming and diving team will begin competi
tion today at the Pac-10 Championships in
Long Beach, Calif. The Cardinal (9-0, 5-0
Pac-10) will head south not only as the
sole undefeated team in the conference,
but also as one of the top-ranked teams in
the country. It currently shares the No. 1
ranking with Georgia.
Stanford will look to bring its first con
ference team championship since 2005
back to the Farm. In the course of its cur
rent season, the Cardinal has defeated its
toughest conference opponents by deci
sive margins. It scored a 173-125 win over
No. 4 Arizona (8-2,4-2) and a 167-131 vic
tory over No. 5 California (5-2,3-2). It also
added a 179-119 win over No. 9 USC (11-
2,4-2) in Los Angeles.
Despite the Cardinal's recent success,
Stanford head coach Lea Maurer believes
that her squad is not entering the tourna
ment as the favorite to win.
"[The No. 1 ranking] is a dual-meet
ranking, not a championship ranking," she

said. "We're still the underdogs."
Indeed, recent history would seem to
validate Maurer's view. Last year, the Card
finished third in the conference tourna
ment, behind Cal and Arizona, and the
Golden Bears went on to win the national
championship. However, Stanford defeat
ed both teams in dual meets last year.
In order to bring home the Pac-10
championship, Stanford will look to sever
