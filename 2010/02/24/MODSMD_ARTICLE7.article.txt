# CARDINAL READY FOR PAC-10s
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After yet another undefeated dual
meet season, the Stanford women's swim
ming and diving team will begin competi
tion today at the Pac-10 Championships in
Long Beach, Calif. The Cardinal (9-0, 5-0
Pac-10) will head south not only as the
sole undefeated team in the conference,
but also as one of the top-ranked teams in
the country. It currently shares the No. 1
ranking with Georgia.
Stanford will look to bring its first con
ference team championship since 2005
back to the Farm. In the course of its cur
rent season, the Cardinal has defeated its
toughest conference opponents by deci
sive margins. It scored a 173-125 win over
No. 4 Arizona (8-2,4-2) and a 167-131 vic
tory over No. 5 California (5-2,3-2). It also
added a 179-119 win over No. 9 USC (11-
2,4-2) in Los Angeles.
Despite the Cardinal's recent success,
Stanford head coach Lea Maurer believes
that her squad is not entering the tourna
ment as the favorite to win.
"[The No. 1 ranking] is a dual-meet
ranking, not a championship ranking," she

said. "We're still the underdogs."
Indeed, recent history would seem to
validate Maurer's view. Last year, the Card
finished third in the conference tourna
ment, behind Cal and Arizona, and the
Golden Bears went on to win the national
championship. However, Stanford defeat
ed both teams in dual meets last year.
In order to bring home the Pac-10
championship, Stanford will look to sever

and shares the national No. 1 ranking with Georgia. The

The women's swimming and diving team is heading down to Long Beach today for the Pac-10
championships. Despite sharing the national No. 1 ranking, though, the Card expects a tough test.

points. Some of its strongest events this
year have been the short-distance
freestyle races, at 50,100 and 200 yards.
In the 50 free, senior Julia Smit and
sophomore Betsy Webb have the sec
ond and third fastest times in the na
tion, with times of 22.35 seconds and
22.37 seconds, respectively. In the 100
free, junior Kate Dwelley has the sec
ond fastest time in the country at 48.57
seconds.

"Shockingly, the sprint freestyles
are looking like strong events for Stan
ford," Maurer said. "We train a lot over
distance, so [the swimmers] are per
plexed by how that's happening. But
that's definitely one we're looking re
ally good in."

The Cardinal will look to two of its
senior leaders, Smit and classmate
Elaine Breeden, to power the team to
a win. Both swimmers have competed
in the Olympics and are defending
NCAA champions. Breeden will look
to score her second consecutive con
ference title in the 100-yard butterfly
and her fourth straight Pac-10 champi
onship in the 200 fly.
"I've won a few events before, and
I think that would put me as a con
tender to win," Breeden said. "But
swimming is unpredictable there
could be favorites, but it all comes
down to who swims fastest on that one
day. It doesn't really matter who's fa
vored to win, just who swims the
fastest."
Smit will also look for her second
straight title in her signature events,
the 200- and 400-yard individual med
leys. Indeed, she is the current short

course world record holder in both
events. She also has the second fastest
time in the country this year in the 200-
yard backstroke she won that event
once before, in 2007.
Stanford will also look to its diving
team to score points. The Cardinal's
top two divers, senior Carmen Stellar
and junior Meg Hostage, have both
won conference championships in the
past. Last year, Stellar won the plat
form while Hostage won the 3-meter
springboard in 2008.

Victories in these events alone will
not carry the Cardinal, so Maurer is
looking to score wins in some closely
contested events as well, specifically
the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke,
"The war of the conference is going
to be the breaststrokes," she said.
The Cardinal's top performer in
both events this year has been junior
Liz Smith, who will look to score up
sets against some of the conference's
more established swimmers.
Even if it meets with success in
Long Beach, the Cardinal's focus re
mains on the season-ending NCAA
Tournament in March.

"The focus is getting as many peo
ple as possible to that meet," Maurer
said. "If we race tough, the qualifying
times will come ... We're just looking
for more than last year, and our goal is
always to get more people to score."
"NCAAs are definitely the focus of
the season," Breeden added. "Pac-lOs
are a lot of fun, and it's great to win a
Pac-10 championship, but NCAAs are
the focus, and winning there is the
goal."

The Pac-10 Championships will
open competition today and run
through Saturday.

"[The No. 1 ranking] is a dual-meet
ranking, not a championship ranking," she

said. "We're still the underdogs."

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women's swimming and div
ing team will begin its postseason today as it starts com
petition in the Pac-10 Championships in Long Beach,
Calif. The Card went undefeated in its dual-meet season
and shares the national No. 1 ranking with Georgia. The
team will be looking for a different result from last year's
conference championships, when it finished third to Cal
and Arizona.

The women's swimming and diving team is heading down to Long Beach today for the Pac-10
championships. Despite sharing the national No. 1 ranking, though, the Card expects a tough test.

points. Some of its strongest events this
year have been the short-distance
freestyle races, at 50,100 and 200 yards.
In the 50 free, senior Julia Smit and
sophomore Betsy Webb have the sec
ond and third fastest times in the na
tion, with times of 22.35 seconds and
22.37 seconds, respectively. In the 100
free, junior Kate Dwelley has the sec
ond fastest time in the country at 48.57
seconds.

"Shockingly, the sprint freestyles
are looking like strong events for Stan
ford," Maurer said. "We train a lot over
distance, so [the swimmers] are per
plexed by how that's happening. But
that's definitely one we're looking re
ally good in."

The Cardinal will look to two of its
senior leaders, Smit and classmate
Elaine Breeden, to power the team to
a win. Both swimmers have competed
in the Olympics and are defending
NCAA champions. Breeden will look
to score her second consecutive con
ference title in the 100-yard butterfly
and her fourth straight Pac-10 champi
onship in the 200 fly.
"I've won a few events before, and
I think that would put me as a con
tender to win," Breeden said. "But
swimming is unpredictable there
could be favorites, but it all comes
down to who swims fastest on that one
day. It doesn't really matter who's fa
vored to win, just who swims the
fastest."
Smit will also look for her second
straight title in her signature events,
the 200- and 400-yard individual med
leys. Indeed, she is the current short

course world record holder in both
events. She also has the second fastest
time in the country this year in the 200-
yard backstroke she won that event
once before, in 2007.
Stanford will also look to its diving
team to score points. The Cardinal's
top two divers, senior Carmen Stellar
and junior Meg Hostage, have both
won conference championships in the
past. Last year, Stellar won the plat
form while Hostage won the 3-meter
springboard in 2008.

Victories in these events alone will
not carry the Cardinal, so Maurer is
looking to score wins in some closely
contested events as well, specifically
the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke,
"The war of the conference is going
to be the breaststrokes," she said.
The Cardinal's top performer in
both events this year has been junior
Liz Smith, who will look to score up
sets against some of the conference's
more established swimmers.
Even if it meets with success in
Long Beach, the Cardinal's focus re
mains on the season-ending NCAA
Tournament in March.

"The focus is getting as many peo
ple as possible to that meet," Maurer
said. "If we race tough, the qualifying
times will come ... We're just looking
for more than last year, and our goal is
always to get more people to score."
"NCAAs are definitely the focus of
the season," Breeden added. "Pac-lOs
are a lot of fun, and it's great to win a
Pac-10 championship, but NCAAs are
the focus, and winning there is the
goal."

The Pac-10 Championships will
open competition today and run
through Saturday.
