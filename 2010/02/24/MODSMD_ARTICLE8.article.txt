## Gov. salaries questioned by senators Senator Alex Katz '12 calls pay "contradictory " 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Amid questions about the ASSU
finances at Tuesday's Undergraduate
Senate meeting, Senator Alex Katz
'l2 proposed to do away with many
of the ASSU's salaried positions,
suggesting that salaries for many
ASSU staffers and elected officials
is indulgent, if not hypocritical.

"There's an enormous amount of
money being wasted," said Katz, the
chair of the Administration & Rules
Committee and a member of the
Appropriations Committee.
"I believe it's enormously contra
dictory to pay the majority of us in
the room ... it undermines our abil
ity to fairly do this process, and I
think it undermines our legitimacy
in the eyes of the student body," he
said.
Katz said he has identified
$34,000 that the ASSU could save if
it eliminated a number of salaries
and made cuts to other line items in
its budget. Katz suggested that the
dollars saved could be put toward
additional programming.
The proposal would eliminate
the salaries of all committee chair
positions except Appropriations and
would preserve the salaries of other
work-intensive positions, including
the ASSU president and vice presi
dent, the Senate chair and the
Senate secretary. Stipends for execu
tive cabinet positions would be cut
across the board, allotting only
$2,000 for the chief of staff job.
Although Katz's proposal is only
suggested for next year's budget,
some senators have suggested insti
tutionalizing the changes by drafting
a bill to amend the bylaws.
According to Senator Zachary
Johnson TO, salary cuts could help
the Senate organize a sort of "buffer
fund" to provide backup to class
cabinets when it comes to funding
campus traditions.
"Not having funding for
Mausoleum and Full Moon on the
Quad is completely ridiculous,"
Johnson said, alluding to the chal
lenges junior class officers faced ear
lier this year to piece together funds
for the Mausoleum Party.
"I think one of the primary things
we can do as senators is to maintain
the campus traditions," Johnson
