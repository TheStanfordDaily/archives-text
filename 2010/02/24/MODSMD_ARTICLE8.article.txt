## Gov. salaries questioned by senators Senator Alex Katz '12 calls pay "contradictory " 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Amid questions about the ASSU
finances at Tuesday's Undergraduate
Senate meeting, Senator Alex Katz
'l2 proposed to do away with many
of the ASSU's salaried positions,
suggesting that salaries for many
ASSU staffers and elected officials
is indulgent, if not hypocritical.

"There's an enormous amount of
money being wasted," said Katz, the
chair of the Administration & Rules
Committee and a member of the
Appropriations Committee.
"I believe it's enormously contra
dictory to pay the majority of us in
the room ... it undermines our abil
ity to fairly do this process, and I
think it undermines our legitimacy
in the eyes of the student body," he
said.
Katz said he has identified
$34,000 that the ASSU could save if
it eliminated a number of salaries
and made cuts to other line items in
its budget. Katz suggested that the
dollars saved could be put toward
additional programming.
The proposal would eliminate
the salaries of all committee chair
positions except Appropriations and
would preserve the salaries of other
work-intensive positions, including
the ASSU president and vice presi
dent, the Senate chair and the
Senate secretary. Stipends for execu
tive cabinet positions would be cut
across the board, allotting only
$2,000 for the chief of staff job.
Although Katz's proposal is only
suggested for next year's budget,
some senators have suggested insti
tutionalizing the changes by drafting
a bill to amend the bylaws.
According to Senator Zachary
Johnson TO, salary cuts could help
the Senate organize a sort of "buffer
fund" to provide backup to class
cabinets when it comes to funding
campus traditions.
"Not having funding for
Mausoleum and Full Moon on the
Quad is completely ridiculous,"
Johnson said, alluding to the chal
lenges junior class officers faced ear
lier this year to piece together funds
for the Mausoleum Party.
"I think one of the primary things
we can do as senators is to maintain
the campus traditions," Johnson
added.
The Student Services Division (SSD)
also came under further scrutiny at
Tuesday's meeting, when several senators
again probed ASSU Vice President Andy
Parker 'lO about the SSD and the possibil
ity of it going onto the special fees ballot.
After significant opposition during last
week's meeting to what some senators felt
were indulgent salaries, Parker returned
to the floor with more modest stipends for
SSD directors, cutting each of them in
half.

The Senate pushed back harder still
yesterday by suggesting that SSD should
be put on the general fee, rather than spe
cial fees, as last year's executive originally
planned.

Several senators agreed that the
umbrella organization of SSD ought to be
dismantled, and its smaller parts should
be handled within the general fee.
"I really don't see the Wellness Room
petering out and dying because it goes to
the general fee," said Anton Zietsman 'l2,
chair of the Appropriations Committee.
"If these groups are successful, they will
thrive as general fee groups."
Some senators also agreed that fewer
paid positions ought to be offered, sug
gesting that in the case of small ventures,
only select and marginal stipends should
be provided.
The Green Store, which was previous
ly allocated a spending budget of $6,000,
rose eyebrows as senators begin consider
ing the financial sustainability of the ven
ture, which does not break even.
Zachary Warma 'll, chair of the
Student Life, Housing & Education
Committee, took issue with charging stu
dents via special fees to subsidize

biodegradable cups, then to "re-charge"
students to pay for those cups to use for
events.

Looking more broadly at the special
fees process, Zietsman proposed a "three
part plan" to reforming what he suggested
is a crucial challenge in the funding
process that "the majority of financial
officers aren't prepared."
By providing comprehensive transi
tion documents to future appropriations
committees as well as education and
greater incentives for financial officers,
Zietsman said he hopes to address some
of these challenges.
He suggested a monetary prize to pro
vide an incentive for financial officers for
the title of best financial officer voted on
by the Appropriations Committee at the
end of each term.

Meanwhile, the ASSU is set to hire a
new financial manager, Raj Bhandari,
pending Senate confirmation next week.
If approved, Bhandari, a graduate student

in management science and engineering
and a 2007 University of Pennsylvania
alum, would also serve as Stanford
Student Enterprises CEO after Matt
McLaughlin 'OB completes his two-year
term at the end of June.
McLaughlin said he is convinced that
Bhandari, who has worked with Citigroup
and American Express, has the potential
to transform the financial landscape of
the organization.
"We are going to focus on a lot of ren
ovations ... aligned with the twenty-sec
ond century that we have going on at
Stanford. We're going to get real techno
logical," Bhadari said.
The Senate confirmed the
Nominations Commission's winter nomi
nees and has held off on approval of any
additional funding bills until next week,
when it will vote on a bulk of bills at once.
