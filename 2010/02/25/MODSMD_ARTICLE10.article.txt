### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Robbie Zimbroff

From sleeping in his covered
wagon-turned-home in White
Plaza to scarfing down frank
furters in an eating contest with
competitive eater Joey Chestnut.
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 has definitely
made his Tree candidacy known in
a major way.

"I wanted to make a lot of my
Tree process pretty visible and
interactive," said Zimbroff, a cur
rent band member who also interrupted an IHUM lec
ture to expose his tree-shaped chest hair. "Last year, I
didn't see or even know about many of the stunts they
sort of happened when they happened and the people
who needed to see them saw them. But I think the impor
tant part is the student body. I wanted to up the ante."
According to the sophomore, this Tree campaign has
been held together by one common theme: America.
"When I was planning to make a bid to be Tree, I was
trying to think of an expression of myself to show who
I am, to show my creativity, to show my style and how I
roll," he said. "And if there were one word to sum up
Robbie Zimbroff, that word is America.'"
When discussing what inspired him to run for Tree,
Zimbroff quoted a personal hero, professional body
builder Ronnie Coleman: "Everybody wants to be a
bodybuilder, but don't nobody want to lift no heavy-ass
weight."
Zimbroff wants to lift that weight.
Rachel Lindee

For Rachel Lindee 'l2 com
monly referred to this week as
"LindTree" aspirations of being
the Stanford Tree began very early
in life.

"I've always been a huge
Stanford fan, literally ever since I
was born because my dad went
here," she explained. "So from
going to sporting events from a
young age and just having that
Stanford spirit, a part of me has
always thought it would be awesome to be the Tree."
Lindee, a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority,
a Gaieties actor (and next year's producer) and a mem
ber of Stanford Improvisors (SIMPS), is the only female

candidate among this year's bunch.
"The fact of me being a girl didn't really click in my
mind as an issue or anything," she said. "But then I real
ized that it really is kind of a cool thing for the female
population, or really anyone on campus, to see that you
can set your mind to whatever your dreams are."
If chosen, Lindee hopes to make the Tree a bigger per
sonality on campus, outside of the costume and beyond
the athletic arenas.

"Yeah, as Stanford Tree you're mostly under a Tree
costume," Lindee said. "But I feel like it's still important
to be an important figure on campus that people actually
like and want to get to know. And that is something that
I would definitely aspire to do."
Ben Cortes

Ben Cortes 'll, a current drum
mer in the Band, is no stranger to
Tree Week he not only ran for the
position last year, but has several
friends who have served as the Band
mascot.
"Seeing them be able to be Tree
just made me realize that it is a pret
ty kick-ass position to be in," he said.
"That's the closest thing campus has
to just straight up rock star."

And it is his "rock star" attitude that Cortes feels
makes him most qualified to be Tree.
"I just try to keep a general awareness of bad-assi
tude," he said. "I've been studying it for a while in its var
ious forms, observing it in film and music I consider
myself a minor authority on the subject. As such, I would
like to be able to place myself in a position where I can
exert some authority in the much-contested field of bad
assitude."
And what he deemed his best stunt, an "authentic
bloody Mary," displayed Cortes' eccentricity as well, if
not his taste for the grotesque.
"I drew a little bit of blood from myself and substitut
ed that for tomato juice in the recipe of a Bloody Mary,"
he explained. "And drank it. That was my tribute to
Twilight."

Kirk Erickson

"Scrumptrilescence" is what
Kirk Erickson 'lO believes will
make him the best Tree in addi
tion to his "dashing good looks
and "relation to Brett Favre in
four degrees."
Erickson, a former Stanford
baseball player and current Band

member, recalls the moment in 1996 when he realized his
calling to someday be Tree.
"When walking out of Big Game, I ran into some Cal
students beating up the shells of one of the trees that they
had stolen," he said. "I climbed into it in the middle of the
street, nine years old ... and in that one minute I decided
that this is what I was meant to do."
Like the other candidates, Erickson has spent the
week performing a variety of stunts, one of which he
claimed was "listening to a Kenny G album for 24 straight
hours."
"I've been proving myself as a worthy candidate by
performing stunts that would show how far I'm willing to
go, sacrificing body, mind and soul," he said.
And while Erickson feels strongly about his perform
ance this week, he recognizes that what happens is now
beyond his control.
"I mean the decision, it's not really mine to make," he
said. "It really comes down to what the Tree gods decide.
Or fate, or whatever you want to put it as."

Chris Hadley

Chris Hadley 'lO, also making
his second bid, views the Tree as
"the unofficial face of the
University."
"Stanford has the reputation of
being very intellectual, very aca
demic," he explained. "The Tree is
kind of just the opposite. He shows
that we can have an incredible
amount of fun that we can be
silly, that we can rock out and rage
and do everything that's not necessarily associated with
us while at the same time being really kind of smart."
Hadley, a member of the track team and Sigma Nu,
originally ran for Tree as a freshman and has "maintained
that feeling of wanting to do it" since.
"I figured this is my last chance," he said. "So I should
go after it."
When asked what distinguishes him from the other
Tree candidates, Hadley was gracious toward his fellow
competitors.
"I'm taller than all of them, I believe," he laughed.
"They're all fantastic. I'm not one to toot my own horn."
Nearing the end of his final Tree week campaign,
Hadley is satisfied with his efforts.
"I feel like I've done pretty much everything I can to
just put my best foot forward, to make a case about why
I would be the best Tree," he said. "But I'm going to be
really relieved once this is over. I think I'm going to sleep
for about a week."
