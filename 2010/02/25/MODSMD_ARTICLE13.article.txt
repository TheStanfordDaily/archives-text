## EDITOR IN CHIEF'S COLUMN The 						Daily's reporting policies on ASSU elections and special fees coverage 
### Kamil Dada 
There is always a potential for conflicts
of interest in non-profit journalism.
As a registered 501(c) non-profit cor
poration, The Daily is dependent on relative
ly few funders.The old adage, "Whoever pays
the piper calls the tune," is certainly a warn
ing that is applicable to journalism.
Indeed, the line between the funding
source and journalism can be sometimes
seem opaque. How should a student reporter
cover stories involving his or her newspa
per's own donor?
One of our sources of funding comes from
special fees. Over the last couple of weeks,
we have been scrutinizing the new policies
and analyzing debates surrounding the
ASSU and the Undergraduate Senate Ap
propriations Committee. However, The
Daily too, has a horse in the special fees race:
as an organization, we are requesting student
signatures to receive a spot on the special
fees ballot.

Our funders, including students at large
who pay special fees, do not receive any spe
cial access to our reporters, do not control
what stories get written and do not have a say
in how the stories are written. This policy will
continue.

Needless to say, our reporters have a vest
ed interest in the continued success of their
newspaper. Such is the reality of University
journalism and the financial situation of our
non-profit. We won't pretend that isn't the
case, but we also assure you: our election re
porters will continue to strive for fairness
and accuracy, as they do throughout the year.
If, as you read The Daily in the coming
weeks, you feel as though we're not doing
our jobs correctly, tell us. Write a letter to the
editor. Start a conversation on our Web site.
Pen an op-ed.
As in past elections, our election re
porters will follow strict reporting standards
regarding other groups and candidates: they
will not join any individual's or student
group's campaign, display promotional ma
terial or sign petitions.
Another question that comes up during
election season is the role of The Daily's edi
torial board. The editorial board comprises a

diverse group of six Stanford students, led by
a chair. Every year, the editorial board en
dorses an executive slate. However, the can
didates they chose are entirely at the discre
tion of the editorial board and their selection
does not indicate tacit support for the candi
dates by the rest of The Daily's staff.
In line with our coverage, our op-ed and
letter to the editor policy also needs to be re
iterated. I welcome and encourage you to
write to The Daily about issues that you feel
strongly about. In terms of letters to the edi
tor, as always, please feel free to critique,
comment or respond to The Daily's cover
age.

However, some guidelines are needed. I
do not wish to run any op-eds that relate to
student groups declaring why they deserve
special fees or should be on the ballot.
Groups could fill our opinion page for weeks
well outlasting election season with legiti
mate cases for why they deserve to be on the
ballot and it isn't The Daily's role to promote
or publicize these groups.
On the other hand, if there is a specific
issue relating to elections that is relevant to
all student groups, then a case can be made
for running an op-ed on the subject. Essen
tially, the op-ed should be appropriate to a
wide variety of student groups and within
our general word limit for op-eds, which is
650 words.

The very nature of journalism means that
clear, transparent and ethical rules must not
only be set in place, but also strictly ob
served. I look forward to reading your feed
back, hearing your scrutiny and enjoying a
lively election season.
