# ALTERNATIVE LIVING...WITHOUT THE NAKED
## Divesting Repression With Cookies 
### Samantha Toh 
The thing is, I am repressed. Having
grown up in a small city where hugs
and signs of affection are rare, I came
to Stanford having never openly and unin
hibitedly hugged another person. Little was I
to know that this was all to change. A couple
of years, several cuddle parties and a daily in
cidence of massive, full-bodied hug-contact
later, the hug is now gaining in my mind a sta
tus of unprecedented importance.
I miss hugs. In Paris, the greeting is the
bison , the sophisticated cheek-kiss. We say
hello, lean in and press our faces together
first one cheek, and then the other. The ac
tion is often accompanied by gentle kissing
noises, and in general, it is a delicate, reserved
and urbane affair. Yet, the roughhousing
boor inside me craves something a little more
enthusiastic. Like how I prefer my bacon,
tater tots and chunky eggs in the morning to
a tiny croissant buttered and jammed, I pre
fer the hug, the body-encasing clutch that ex
presses so much more.
Adapting to a foreign culture is one thing,
but adapting wholesale is another. As the
Americans in our program begin only to
bisou, I am determined to bring the hug back
in some shape or form.
So much of this is symbolic for me. As
someone who always wanted to hug, but
never really could, I spent many a long year
desperately trying to. I progressed from little
nods of acknowledgement to pats on the
back, and from that to the brief and awkward
hug. And some time in my third year, I final
ly learned how to accept, graciously and
gratefully, the longer, affectionate cuddle.
The hug and I have a history, and this history
has provoked a deep reflection on my part on
the bizarre and unnecessary nature of inhibi
tions. After all, so much of what we believe in
and so much that dictate our behavior is
habit. And so the question arose: if we all
began doing something each day to push the
boundaries of unfounded social inhibitions,
could we improve our lives and the lives of
others? Even the slightest improvement, I
concluded, was still one and that was the root
of my Conditional Cookies project.
Last quarter, in a melodramatic search for
happiness, I baked 200 peanut butter cookies.
Placing giant tubs out in my house's dining
room, I made a sign-up sheet and a list of in
structions. "CONDITIONAL COOKIES," it
read. "If you take these cookies, do some
thing tomorrow that you have never dared to
do before that will make somebody happy."

I sounded like somebody who still be
lieved in Santa and unicorns, but I was at
peace with that. Santa and unicorns could
exist briefly if they could change something
for the better.
The best part was what the plan did. Peo
ple ate my cookies, but also acted on the con
dition. One told his coach that he liked his
workout circuit; another told a stranger that
she liked her shoes. Some told their friends
how special they were; and others, their par
ents. In one case, two people found out that
they liked each other, and in another, that his
parents were still in love.
Nobody was Mother Theresa. I never ex
pected anyone to be. Yet, I found something
precious in the seemingly meager and in
significant. So much of what we do or do
not do is self-constructed, and often with
the most unnecessary of barriers. Here in
Paris, where habit is making the hug a
stranger, I am determined to tear a wall down
before it becomes an Iron Curtain.
With a tray full of freshly baked, toffee
crusted fudge brownies, stuffed to edge with
hazelnuts, I am about to embark on a new
kind of conditional cookie. I once said that
instead of drugs, I do hugs. Having spent 19
years deprived of liberal cuddles, time is too
short to make up for all that I've missed.
Now, even Paris, with all her elegant cheek
kissing, cannot stop me.
