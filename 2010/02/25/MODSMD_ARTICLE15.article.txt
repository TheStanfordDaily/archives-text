# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Finding Skepticism in Analysis 
### Danny Crichton 
Last week, New York Times columnist
David Brooks wrote a lament of a
bizarre trend in American civil society
as institutions have become less elitist and
more open, the trust that people place in
these institutions has decreased. He certainly
does not want to hearken back to the discrim
ination of the past, but his rose-colored view
of the past is in need of strong skepticism.
Institutions today are more open and
transparent than ever before. There has been
a democratization of investigative tools
cameras are cheap, connections to others are
quick and gatekeepers that used to screen
this information are no longer in power. We
know more information about more things
than humanity has ever previously experi
enced. Even the National Enquirer is writing
possibly Pulitzer-Prize-winning investigative
pieces.
Yet as this information has increased dra
matically, our ability to adapt our standards to
the deluge has not caught up. We still expect
our politicians to be pure, and we are out
raged over the abuse of public funds. We dis
trust the mainstream media, but then proceed
to believe a blogger with little more than a
computer and an opinion. But has anything
really changed? Is our world really more cor
rupt and less trustworthy, or are we experi
encing a classic problem in statistics we are
beginning to detect what has always been in
existence.
There are voluminous examples of scan
dals throughout the years, so we cannot claim
that the good people of the past were entire
ly pure. I doubt people are sleeping with their
staffs more than in the past or stealing money
in more significant amounts (inflation-adjust
ed of course, for both sex and money).
There has been a theme in the media, and
Brooks has submitted to it, of lionizing the
immediate past as a time of greatness. This ex
ample of corruption shows just how danger-

ous such thinking can be. The world was not
less corrupt, but when we allow the history to
fade away, we may forget that times were just
as bad now as then.

Outside of corruption, Brooks also criti
cizes the obsessive focus on the short term
over what he perceived was longer-term
thinking in the past. He writes that the old sys
tem of corporate family dynasties ensured

that a company would focus on long-term
profits because the company would one day
be handed off to the CEO's heir.
Again, one needs to take one look at the
immediate history to see that the evidence
does not match this view. A perfect example is
the Cuban Missile Crisis, an example of the
kind of slow thinking and methodical ap
proach that we should appreciate (I am, of
course, being facetious).
The speeding up of life and the focus on
the short term is not due to an antiquated
form of corporatism, but like corruption, the
increase in information on institutions. Wall
Street adjusts its evaluation of the value of a
company as information comes in as the
flow increased, so did the speed of the
changes of the price. While society certainly
has an effect on mentality, and it does not help
that business schools teach the bottom line
exclusively, it is hard to argue that the internet
and the concomitant increase in information
has not played a substantial role in the in
crease in short-term thinking.
Why then do prolific and high profile writ
ers keep trying to remake this glorious past?
We live in a different world, with different
rules and players. We cannot expect to change
the game back to the way it once was. Instead,
we must be constantly vigilant of those who
would revere the past and attempt to block
society's progress.
My message is one of skepticism. Brooks'
column is an ode to a time that did not exist,
and likely never will. There have been many
recent examples of this genre in the media.
We may be in the Great Recession, but we
also need to keep perspective on where we
are and what we face. Without it, this country
will never recover.
