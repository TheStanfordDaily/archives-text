# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I was saddened to read about the bicycle
accident death of Yichao Wang. Unfortunate
ly, I was not at all surprised to read that the
accident took place on Palm Drive. As a Cal
train commuter, I bike Palm Drive twice a
day, and I can report that the traffic flow on
Palm Drive is an everyday hazard to cyclists.
It is rare for me to bike Palm Drive with
out being passed by a speeding car with dan
gerously little clearance. Perhaps 1 notice
these reckless drivers more since one of them
struck me last July, breaking my shoulder. At
the intersection where Wang was killed, 1
quite regularly have close calls when drivers
rushing home make hurried right turns out of
Museum Way.
Stanford Police Chief Laura Wilson's
warnings on vigilance are well-taken. But
they are unlikely to have an impact on off
campus visitors like the man who killed
Wang, or community members taking short
cuts across campus like the teenager who
broke my shoulder. The campus police could
do a lot more for our safety by handing out a
few tickets to the speeders and aggressive
drivers who make Palm Drive such a hazard
to the rest of us.
