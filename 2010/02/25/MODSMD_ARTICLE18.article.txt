## FINISHING AT MAPLES 
### HALEY MURPHY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the Cardinal, coming home this sea
son has always meant one thing: catching up.
Homestands have been opportunities to
make up for inevitable losses on the road, as
Stanford tried to keep the .500 mark at least
in sight. Success in Maples has allowed the
Card to hang in there at 13-14 (7-8 in confer
ence play). And just in the nick of time,
Landry Fields & Co. discovered that they
could indeed take their show on the road (to
Oregon) to make the game of catch-up a lit
tle easier.
After sweeping the Oregon schools in its
final road trip of the year, the "home stretch"
of conference play can be read literally for
the Cardinal, as Stanford returns to welcome
Arizona State, Arizona and California be
fore the postseason.
But maintaining its home court advan
tage will be no easy feat for the Card, as it has
lost to all three of its remaining opponents on
their own turfs by an average of 17 points.
First up are the Sun Devils, who are sec
ond only to the Golden Bears in the Pac-10
with a 9-5 conference record (19-8 overall).
Arizona State bested the Cardinal by 18
points on Jan. 30 in Tempe, thanks mostly to
junior guard Ty Abbott, who lit Stanford up
for 29 points of his own including shoot
ing seven-of-nine from long range.
As a result, Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins says that the team will be trying to
limit the production of Abbott, who averages
11.9 points per game, and the rest of the Sun
Devil backcourt.
"Abbott is playing very well," Dawkins
said. "Of course, he had a great game against
us there, and [senior guard Eric] Glasser is a
big-time leader at the point. He's been
around the block... and he's leading his
team well."
Glasser leads not only the team, but also
the conference, in assists, dishing out more
than five assists per game, thereby giving him
the Pac-10's second-best assist/turnover
ratio. He also ranks third among free throw
shooters with 88 percent.
Meanwhile, Abbott leads a few things
himself, and although his seven threes in Jan
uary were far and away from his 2.62 per
game average, his percentage (44.2) lands
him ahead of even Stanford's own Jeremy
Green (40.3), and helps Arizona State lead
the conference as a team, averaging 8.48 long
balls per outing.

But Glasser and Abbott share scoring re
sponsibility with the rest of the team, as six
Sun Devils average more than seven points
per game, including junior Rihards Kuksiks
(11.9) and senior Eric Boateng (8.2) â€”with
whom Dawkins is familiar from his days
playing at Duke before transferring to ASU.
In the season's second meeting with Ari
zona State, Dawkins says familiarity with the
whole roster will make Stanford better pre
pared for the Sun Devils' style of play.
"[ASU] really gets after you defensively,"
Dawkins said. "They run a motion offense to
keep the floor spread, and they have some
terrific shooters that really play off of what
they do offensively."
"We have to defend better this time," he
continued. "A large part of them getting out
and getting off to a big lead early was the fact
that we turned the ball over, which led to
some easy baskets for them in transition. We
have to find their shooters in the half court..
. and try to stay with them because when
you're making threes to the level that they're
capable... that rings up points pretty quick
ly."
With a game plan solidly in place,
Dawkins hopes his team will "compliment
[its] defense with offense."
This burden will likely fall, as usual, on the
Pac-10's leading scorer, Fields (with 22.2
ppg),who is coming off what Dawkins called
his best game of the season against Oregon
State, Green (17.5 ppg) will probably remain
the other top scorer, looking to top Abbott in
the long-range shootout and Green is
confident he can.

When asked who could beat him in a
game of HORSE, Green replied simply, "No
one." And he didn't mean just on the Stan
ford team.
"No one in the world," he clarified with a
smile, adding that Abbott's sniper range puts
no pressure on his own game.
If Green can hit two more from behind
the arc, he'll surpass Casey Jacobsen's Stan
ford three-point record of 84 in a season, and
another bucket from Fields will make him
just the fifth Cardinal player to score 600 ca

reer points.
Stanford will also look for contributions
that don't come in the form of records from
senior guard Drew Shiller and sophomore
Jack Trotter, who have chipped in especially
well recently, and sophomore guard Jarrett
Mann, who will also likely be given the
charge of defending Abbott.
With March approaching, the Sun Devils
need an incredibly strong finish to the season

Junior guard Da'Veed Dildy goes up for a layup against Oregon State's Kevin McShane last
weekend in Corvallis, Ore. Stanford swept the Oregon schools for its first road wins of the
season. Now the Cardinal returns home for its three remaining regular season games.
if they want it to last a little longer. If
the stars align meaning either Ari
zona State wins the Pac-10 Tourna
ment over Cal and/or hell freezes over
ASU needs nothing but wins from
here on out to be the second Pac-10
team to get a spot in the NCAA Tour
nament.
Bottom line: Arizona State will ar
rive at Maples ready to play, and
Dawkins says Stanford is up to the
challenge.

"We have an opportunity to do
something great," Dawkins said. "We
have three home games we have to
take them one at a time against
some very good teams. Arizona, Ari
zona State and Cal are all playing some
really good basketball, and for us the
important thing is that we understand
the value of each game. We have to go
out there, prepared to win each time
against the opponent that we're going
to face, and while we're out there, we
stay focused for the 40 minutes."
The first 40 start at 7 p.m. tonight at
Maples Pavilion.
