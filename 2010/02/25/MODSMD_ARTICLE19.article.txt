## Desert battles await Cardinal women 
### ALYSSA AHLUWALIA STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's basketball team takes to
the road this weekend to battle it out against Arizona State
and the University of Arizona. With the season winding
down to only three more games before the Pac-lOTourna
ment, the team looks forward to what will be the first of
two consecutive weekends on the road.The first game will
begin at 6 p.m. tonight at Arizona State (16-9,8-6 Pac-10)
and the weekend will wrap up with a game against Ari
zona (13-12,6-8) at 2 p.m. on Saturday.
The Cardinal women can only hope that this weekend
will mark a continuation of its current boast-worthy sea
son record (25-1,15-0). Last weekend at home, Stanford
crushed Oregon with a final score of 104-60, and finished
the weekend by defeating Oregon State 82-48. The Cardi
nal women have only incurred one loss this season to No.
1 Connecticut.

"We're building and playing well at the right time," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "During the Oregon game,
I was kind of thinking 'we should be saving some of these
baskets... we might need that down the stretch.'"
There is no doubt the Cardinal women have been play
ing confidently this season. One example of this team
strength lies in senior center Jayne Appel, who was recent
ly awarded Pac-10 Player of the Week honors for her sec
ond consecutive week. Appel is also one of three players
at Stanford to achieve 1,000 rebounds and 2,000 points.
"Jayne is doing a great job for us, but she's not the only
story," VanDerveer said, "whether it's the rebounding that
Nneka [Ogwumike] brings, or the scoring percentage, or
Kayla [PedersenJ's defense or Jeanette [Pohlen], who re
ally stepped up in the Oregon game."
Because the team has dealt with individual injuries
throughout the season to players such as JJ Hones, Appel
and Pohlen, flexibility of team positions will be key to a
Pac-10 championship.
"We're getting real quality minutes from girls coming
in [off the bench] ... If we're able to play eight, nine, even
10 people in some situations, especially looking forward to
the tournament, that's great for us."

Stanford women's basketball has won the Pac-10 for
each of the last 10 years. The last two years, the team has
made it to the Final Four. Students on campus showing
support for a team championship are wearing "Put a Ring
on It"T-shirts, so the team feels the pressure building for a
national victory.
"The tournament feel is starting to come into our team
... People are realizing that we only have three more reg
ular season games, and then it's tournament time," Van-
Derveer said. "There's a sense of urgency that Jayne
brings and [fellow senior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude] brings
to our practices and games."
Of course, the season is not over,
and before the Cardinal women can
hope for a national championship,
they must finish off the season with
confidence and strength. This means
the team's work is not finished; it con
tinues this weekend in Arizona.
VanDerveer notes that Stanford
will face some tough pressure defense
against Arizona, but the team isn't
worried.
"They have two really excellent
players in [Davellyn] Whyte and [lfy]
Ibekwe you've got to shut those
two players down and then play
against a kind of 1-1-3 or 1-3-1 defense
that is very effective ... but our team
is up for the challenge and we're excit
ed about it," VanDerveer said. "We're

looking forward to going to Arizona."
