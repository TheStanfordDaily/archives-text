## Council questions health care GSC also welcomes incoming CEO of SSE 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
A wide range of issues were
brought up at Wednesday's GSC
meeting, including international stu
dent health insurance, special fees, the
confirmation of the ASSU's new
financial manager, cabinet member
salaries and parking.
The issue of upcoming mandatory
Cardinal Care participation for inter
national students struck a particularly
strong chord with attendees, since
much of the graduate student popula
tion is international about one
third, according to the Bechtel
International Center Web site.
Justin Brown, a fourth-year gradu
ate student in geophysics, announced
that he received notice of a possible
group to be formed by faculty and stu
dents alike to negotiate the change.
The group, currently called the Health
Insurance Working Group, is expect
ed to convene next week.
"Does this mean that [Vaden] is
still open to changing this [policy] for
next year?" asked Addy Satija, a
third-year graduate student in energy
resources engineering.
"I think they're very receptive to
it," Brown answered.
Some GSC members questioned
the validity of insurance plans other
than Cardinal Care.
"Vaden should make the criteria
about what makes adequate health
insurance available," said co-chair
Nanna Notthoff, a second-year gradu
ate student in psychology. "Maybe
some plans from certain countries
would be okay based on this new set
criteria."

Others brought up the
University's motives behind instating
mandatory Cardinal Care for interna
tional students.

"Let's keep in mind that the
University did this because of their
own financial liability in this case,"
said Ryan Peacock, a fourth-year
graduate student in chemical engi
neering. "This was the example that
was given last week."
The council decided to send Satija
and Peacock to join the initiative, con
tribute their ideas and report back.
Issues about the special fees
process was also brought up at the
meeting. There has been some ambi
guity in terms of what the rules, said
Brown.

The Senate met over the weekend
to interview financial officers for
groups hoping to get on the special
fees ballot; GSC members said they
did not hear about the interviews
until Saturday night. The first meeting
was Sunday morning at 9 a.m.

"There's no efficient communica
tion," Satija said.
GSC members said they would
propose a joint bylaw amendment to
guarantee representation from both
the GSC and Senate at special fees
hearings.
The meeting also saw the unani
mous confirmation of Raj Bhandari, a
first-year graduate student in man
agement science and engineering, as
CEO of Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE) and financial manager of the
ASSU. He awaits confirmation by the
Undergraduate Senate next week.
Bhandari will be replacing Matt
McLaughlin 'OB, who oversaw 50
employees and $13.5 million dollars
in SSE assets.

A bylaw overlooked last week was
passed unanimously. The bill, which
was discussed in previous weeks,

revises joint bylaws to change the
time period from which students can
request special fees from three weeks
to two weeks.

Council members brought up con
cerns about salaries for executive cab
inet members, a hotly debated issue in
Tuesday's Senate meeting.

"There is a certain amount of trust
that the student body puts into an
exec when they elect them," Satija
said. "So it's up to them how they
decide to run the cabinet."

Others disagreed.
"To be honest, I think we can
reduce the amount of cabinet posts,"
said Robert Hennessy, a doctoral stu
dent in electrical engineering. "It
seems to have grown to too many
numbers. We can make more focused
cabinet posts. We can reduce the
number of these positions."
Currently, cabinet members'
salaries cost the ASSU $20,800.
In defense of the accusations,
Gobaud explained that cabinet mem
bers do important work and often
contribute more time than the
salaries compensate.
"Look how much you're paying
the elections commissioners, $1,500
for four days," Gobaud said. "My
chairs are getting a lot less."
GSC members agreed to disagree
about the effectiveness of the current
cabinet situation, and plan to discuss
the issue more next week.

Notthoff announced a change in
parking situation for areas around the
graduate community center. In an
effort to increase student use of the
center, off-campus commuter stu
dents may park in nearby, originally
residential-only areas from 4 p.m. to 2
a.m. as long as they have an A or C
permit. The pilot program will run for
the next 30 days.

Plans to increase voter turnout
were discussed as elections commis
sioner Quinn Slack 'll proposed the
possibility of providing incentives for
grad students to vote. The council ulti
mately deferred a final decision to
Slack.

Jon McNaughtan, a first-year
graduate student in education, was
sworn in as the School of Education
representative.

The GSC passed funding bills for
the Romanian Students Association,
the Belgian Student Association,
Vegetarian Students for Conscious
Living and Asha for Education.
