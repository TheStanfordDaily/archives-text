## Card heads to Palm Springs 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford Softball team (8-1) trav
els to Palm Springs this weekend to take part in
the Cathedral City Classic.
The Cardinal will play six games, including
two against ranked opponents, at the Field of
Dreams Complex, which boasts Softball fields
that are replicas of famous Major League ball
parks like Yankee Stadium and Wrigley Field.
The tournament brings in 30 teams, includ
ing 12 ranked teams, to the California desert for
the four-day tournament. Seven of the eight
Pac-10 Conference teams will be there, though
Stanford will not play any of them.
This tournament is part of a pre-conference
schedule that head coach John Rittman has
called one of the most challenging Stanford has
had in years.
Senior left fielder Alissa Haber believes that
playing a tough early season schedule can only
help the Cardinal down the road.
"It definitely helps to have played these
games come Pac-lOs, when we are playing good,
ranked teams all the time," Haber said. "We
learn how to handle ourselves in pressure situa
tions."
Haber, a three-time Ail-American, is the
Cardinal's leader offensively, hitting from the
leadoff spot. She has picked up this season
where she left off last year, as she is hitting .500
with a home run, four doubles and nine runs
scored thus far this season.
Also hitting well for the Cardinal is a fellow
senior, catcher Rosey Neill. Neill enters the
weekend with an impressive .478 batting aver
age and two home runs.
Stanford plays its first game of the tournament
tonight at 8 p.m. against the University of Ten
nessee (6-2).
The Lady Vols have won six consecutive
games, riding on the success of two freshmen:
third baseman Raven Chavanne and right field
er Kat Dotson. Chavanne, the reigning South
eastern Conference Player of the Week, is hit
ting a robust .621 out of the leadoff spot, while
Dotson is right behind her, hitting .556.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal plays a doublehead
er, with its first game against No. 23 North west-
ern (5-5) and its second against Long
Beach State (4-5).
Northwestern has fared well
against Pac-10 opponents already
this season, beating No. 12 California
last weekend. The Wildcats are led
by last week's Big Ten Player of the
Week, sophomore Adrienne Monka.
Monka is hitting .429 with four home
runs and 10 RBIs.
Long Beach State is led by freshman
Nalani St. Germain, who is hitting
.385 with five home runs in the early
season.
On Saturday, the Cardinal has
just one game, a matchup with No. 24
Texas A&M (10-1). Rhainnon
Kliesing is a star for the Aggies both
in the circle and at bat. Kliesing is 6-
0 with a 3.28 ERA and 51 strikeouts,
while hitting .406 offensively.
Stanford closes out its weekend
with a doubleheader Sunday against
Syracuse (2-3) and the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas (7-3).
Huddled up in the wintery north
east, the Orange has played just five
games, with both of its wins coming
over Bryant University at the

Louisiana-Lafayette Mardi Gras
Tournament.
UNLV, on the other hand, has
gotten great production out of senior
Marissa Nicholas, who is hitting .467
with 12 runs scored.
Rittman expects this weekend to
be a challenge for his team, but is ex
cited for it.
"This weekend, we are going to
be tested by playing some very good
teams," he said. "[Tournaments like
this one] get you game-ready for the
Pac-10."
Although this team has a differ
ent look from last year's Super Re
gional team, with the loss of Ail-
American pitcher Missy Penna,
Rittman likes the way it is shaping up
so far.
"I really like the makeup of our
team," Rittman said. "We've really
made progress the first two week
ends and we are still trying to im
prove in some places."
Haber agrees with her coach, be
lieving some of the early season
nerves have started to fade for the
Cardinal.
"We're playing a lot looser
people aren't as tight," Haber said.
"We all have a lot more confidence."
