## Card heads to Palm Springs 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford Softball team (8-1) trav
els to Palm Springs this weekend to take part in
the Cathedral City Classic.
The Cardinal will play six games, including
two against ranked opponents, at the Field of
Dreams Complex, which boasts Softball fields
that are replicas of famous Major League ball
parks like Yankee Stadium and Wrigley Field.
The tournament brings in 30 teams, includ
ing 12 ranked teams, to the California desert for
the four-day tournament. Seven of the eight
Pac-10 Conference teams will be there, though
Stanford will not play any of them.
This tournament is part of a pre-conference
schedule that head coach John Rittman has
called one of the most challenging Stanford has
had in years.
Senior left fielder Alissa Haber believes that
playing a tough early season schedule can only
help the Cardinal down the road.
"It definitely helps to have played these
games come Pac-lOs, when we are playing good,
ranked teams all the time," Haber said. "We
learn how to handle ourselves in pressure situa
tions."
Haber, a three-time Ail-American, is the
Cardinal's leader offensively, hitting from the
leadoff spot. She has picked up this season
where she left off last year, as she is hitting .500
with a home run, four doubles and nine runs
scored thus far this season.
Also hitting well for the Cardinal is a fellow
senior, catcher Rosey Neill. Neill enters the
weekend with an impressive .478 batting aver
age and two home runs.
Stanford plays its first game of the tournament
tonight at 8 p.m. against the University of Ten
nessee (6-2).
The Lady Vols have won six consecutive
games, riding on the success of two freshmen:
third baseman Raven Chavanne and right field
er Kat Dotson. Chavanne, the reigning South
eastern Conference Player of the Week, is hit
ting a robust .621 out of the leadoff spot, while
Dotson is right behind her, hitting .556.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal plays a doublehead
er, with its first game against No. 23 North west-
