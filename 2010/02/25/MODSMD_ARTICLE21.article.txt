# PAC-1Os AWAIT
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
As the championship season begins in a
number of sports, Stanford wrestling will begin
postseason play this Friday at the Pac-10
Championships in Davis, Calif.
The Cardinal (10-8-1,2-4-1 Pac-10) will face
a tough road to win a conference champi
onship. Stanford struggled in dual meets
against conference rivals this season and will
look to improve on this record in the tourna
ment.
To win in Davis, the Card will have to go
through three programs currently ranked in the
top 25 No. 11 Boise State, No. 15 Oregon
State and No. 20 California Polytechnic. A
fourth conference opponent, Arizona State, sits
just outside of the rankings. Stanford has wres
tled all of these teams this season, and was un
able to score victories against any of them. Its
two conference victories came at UC-Davis
and at home against Cal State Bakersfield by
scores of 20-19 and 24-13, respectively.
Nevertheless, Stanford head coach Jason
Borrelli remains optimistic about how his team
will perform this weekend.

"Our goal going into this year was to win the
conference championship," he said. "That's
what we're going in for. All of our guys believe
we can do that and that we're capable of doing
that, but we have to wrestle to our best at every
weight.
"We actually have to wrestle above our
seeds to do that," he continued. "We're only fa
vored at one weight class in the whole tourna
ment."
That one weight class is at 165 pounds,
where redshirt sophomore Nick Amuchastegui
is ranked first in the Pac-10. He has a record of
27-4 for the season and is nationally ranked at
No. 16 in his weight class.
While tournaments are inherently unpre
dictable, Amuchastegui looks poised to capture
the conference championship. In Stanford's
dual meets, he has already beaten the confer
ence's second- and third-ranked wrestlers, Dan
Brascetta of Oregon State and Joey Granata of
Cal State Bakersfield.
"If I go out there and wrestle solid, like I
have been, this tournament should go pretty
well," he said.

Stanford wrestlers will have to face three top-20 teams when it travels to Davis for the Pac-10
Championships. The Cardinal is looking to improve on a 2-4-1 conference record this Friday.
When asked if he would be disap
pointed to leave the tournament with
out winning the title, Amuchastegui
responded, "Yes, I would be really dis
appointed ... That was one of my
goals at the beginning of the year and
it's a goal that I feel very capable of ac
complishing."
The Cardinal's second standout,
redshirt junior Zack Giesen, will most
likely be seeded second at this tourna
ment behind Kirk Smith of Boise
State. Giesen wrestles in the 184-
pound weight class and is ranked at
No. 13 nationally, while Smith is
ranked No. 1.
In their previous meeting, during
Stanford's Jan. 29 dual meet against
Boise State, Smith defeated Giesen in
a 4-1 decision.
"I have to be able to get after him,"
Giesen said. "He's obviously a good
wrestler who's hard to score on. My
goal is to not let him dictate the match
and to slow things down."
While the focus will be on the finals
clash between these two opponents,
Giesen refuses to look that far ahead.
"I'll take it one match at a time," he
said. "I have to get there first. Right
now, I'm thinking about the first two
matches, but I'll have time to prepare
for the final."
While the Cardinal will look to this
pair for its leadership, Borrelli knows
that other wrestlers will have to step
up for Stanford to score highly as a
team.

"I look at our first couple of
weights," he said. "[Freshman 125-

pounder] Ryan Mango and [junior
133-pounder] Justin Paulsen are both
capable of winning their weight class
es. On good days, they're as good as
anyone in the conference."
Borrelli went on to highlight red
shirt junior Lucas Espericueta at 157
pounds and senior Jake Johnson at 174
pounds as two other wrestlers that
have the potential to make significant
impacts.
While wrestling is an individual
sport, both Borrelli and the wrestlers
are careful not to lose sight of the team
aspect.
"If you do well individually, then
the team will do well," Giesen said.
"The team is always at the back of
your mind, but the focus is on my indi
vidual matches."
After the Pac-10 Championships,
the only remaining tournament on the
Card's schedule is the NCAA Tourna
ment in March.
"It's really tough to say how we'll
stack up," Amuchastegui said. "It
would be a great accomplishment if
we ended up in the top 15 or so."
"The goal, clearly, is the nationals,"
Borrelli said. "How you do there as a
team will trump anything you do in the
conference.
"We want to send the most guys
we've ever sent to nationals," he con
tinued. "The most guys individually
Stanford's ever sent in wrestling is five,
so we want to send five or six guys ...
It's going to take a good tournament to
do that we know that and we're ex
pecting that."
The Pac-10 Championships will
take place on Friday and Saturday in
Davis, Calif.
