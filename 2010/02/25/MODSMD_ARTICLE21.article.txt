# PAC-1Os AWAIT

### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
As the championship season begins in a
number of sports, Stanford wrestling will begin
postseason play this Friday at the Pac-10
Championships in Davis, Calif.
The Cardinal (10-8-1,2-4-1 Pac-10) will face
a tough road to win a conference champi
onship. Stanford struggled in dual meets
against conference rivals this season and will
look to improve on this record in the tourna
ment.
To win in Davis, the Card will have to go
through three programs currently ranked in the
top 25 No. 11 Boise State, No. 15 Oregon
State and No. 20 California Polytechnic. A
fourth conference opponent, Arizona State, sits
just outside of the rankings. Stanford has wres
tled all of these teams this season, and was un
able to score victories against any of them. Its
two conference victories came at UC-Davis
and at home against Cal State Bakersfield by
scores of 20-19 and 24-13, respectively.
Nevertheless, Stanford head coach Jason
Borrelli remains optimistic about how his team
will perform this weekend.

"Our goal going into this year was to win the
conference championship," he said. "That's
what we're going in for. All of our guys believe
we can do that and that we're capable of doing
that, but we have to wrestle to our best at every
weight.
"We actually have to wrestle above our
seeds to do that," he continued. "We're only fa
vored at one weight class in the whole tourna
ment."
That one weight class is at 165 pounds,
where redshirt sophomore Nick Amuchastegui
is ranked first in the Pac-10. He has a record of
27-4 for the season and is nationally ranked at
No. 16 in his weight class.
While tournaments are inherently unpre
dictable, Amuchastegui looks poised to capture
the conference championship. In Stanford's
dual meets, he has already beaten the confer
ence's second- and third-ranked wrestlers, Dan
Brascetta of Oregon State and Joey Granata of
Cal State Bakersfield.
"If I go out there and wrestle solid, like I
have been, this tournament should go pretty
well," he said.
