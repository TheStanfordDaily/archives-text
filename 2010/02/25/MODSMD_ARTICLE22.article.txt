## Stanford sweeps Hawaii 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Pac-10 play is finally here. With the de
feat of Hawaii (1-7) on Wednesday, the No.
11 Stanford women's tennis team (7-0)
travels down to Los Angeles to face the No.
4 UCLA Bruins (9-1) on Friday and the No.
10 USC Women of Troy (7-2) in two non
counting conference matches.
Before they could think about Pac-10 ri
vals, the Cardinal had one last opponent to
defeat. Hawaii came to the Farm to play a
match rescheduled from January due to
rain, and fortunately the sun was out in full
force. Stanford swept through the doubles
matches, dropping a combined five games,
to go up 1-0.
The nation's No. 2 duo of junior Hilary
Barte and senior Lindsay Burdette won 8-1
in a true display of their talent as a tandem,
finishing only moments behind Stanford's
No. 3 team of sophomore Veronica Li and
junior Carolyn McVeigh, who also won 8-1.
The freshmen were not far behind, as Mal
lory Burdette and Stacey Tan recorded an
8-3 win for Stanford's sixth doubles sweep
on the season.
"Lindsay and I felt like we had it under
control the whole time," Barte said. "We've
been playing really well recently and I think

everyone played really well today."
Hawaii proved no match for Stanford in
singles as well. Only the Rainbow Wahine's
Katarina Poljokov and Alyssa Nafarret
were able to get within three games of win
ning a set. The rest was simply Stanford
domination, highlighted by McVeigh's 6-1,
6-0 win and junior Jennifer Yen's 6-0, 6-1
win.

With little rest after their match, the
women fly down to southern California
today as the last remaining undefeated Pac
-10 team, to prepare for a more competitive
part of the season. This weekend's matches,
however, will not count toward conference
standings, but will matter when playoff
seeding is considered. Beyond that, the
Cardinal wants to see how it compares
against the nation's best programs.
"I hope we see how we match up against
both teams," Barte said. "They're top-10 in
the country and I hope it opens our eyes as
to just how good we are. We want to come
out of there victorious, but obviously you
can't control how they're going to play."

With Stanford's absence at the ITA Na
tional Indoor Championships this year,
match play against California schools has
been scarce, but this serves to work both for
