# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Stanford sweeps Hawaii 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Pac-10 play is finally here. With the de
feat of Hawaii (1-7) on Wednesday, the No.
11 Stanford women's tennis team (7-0)
travels down to Los Angeles to face the No.
4 UCLA Bruins (9-1) on Friday and the No.
10 USC Women of Troy (7-2) in two non
counting conference matches.
Before they could think about Pac-10 ri
vals, the Cardinal had one last opponent to
defeat. Hawaii came to the Farm to play a
match rescheduled from January due to
rain, and fortunately the sun was out in full
force. Stanford swept through the doubles
matches, dropping a combined five games,
to go up 1-0.
The nation's No. 2 duo of junior Hilary
Barte and senior Lindsay Burdette won 8-1
in a true display of their talent as a tandem,
finishing only moments behind Stanford's
No. 3 team of sophomore Veronica Li and
junior Carolyn McVeigh, who also won 8-1.
The freshmen were not far behind, as Mal
lory Burdette and Stacey Tan recorded an
8-3 win for Stanford's sixth doubles sweep
on the season.
"Lindsay and I felt like we had it under
control the whole time," Barte said. "We've
been playing really well recently and I think

everyone played really well today."
Hawaii proved no match for Stanford in
singles as well. Only the Rainbow Wahine's
Katarina Poljokov and Alyssa Nafarret
were able to get within three games of win
ning a set. The rest was simply Stanford
domination, highlighted by McVeigh's 6-1,
6-0 win and junior Jennifer Yen's 6-0, 6-1
win.

With little rest after their match, the
women fly down to southern California
today as the last remaining undefeated Pac
-10 team, to prepare for a more competitive
part of the season. This weekend's matches,
however, will not count toward conference
standings, but will matter when playoff
seeding is considered. Beyond that, the
Cardinal wants to see how it compares
against the nation's best programs.
"I hope we see how we match up against
both teams," Barte said. "They're top-10 in
the country and I hope it opens our eyes as
to just how good we are. We want to come
out of there victorious, but obviously you
can't control how they're going to play."

With Stanford's absence at the ITA Na
tional Indoor Championships this year,
match play against California schools has
been scarce, but this serves to work both for
and against the Cardinal. While the
Stanford women are unsure how they
measure up, their opponents are
equally as wary about a Stanford
team they know nothing about.
"We don't have anything to lose
by going down there," Barte said.
"They're going to feel a lot of pres
sure. They haven't seen our team this
year and they don't know what to ex
pect, so we're going to go down there
and blitz them."

As far as road trips go, the visit to
the L.A. schools is as nice as they
come. With the southern Californian
sun and the history of talent both
schools have, the area proves to be
great for tennis.
"It's really one of our best trips,"
said head coach Lele Forood. "It's
nice to go down there. You stay in one
place. You don't have to move around
between playing the schools. It's a
great atmosphere. The courts at
UCLA are huge and SC has been
pretty fun these past few years."

UCLA has had the more success
ful season so far, but only marginally.
With one loss on the year coming
against California at the National
Team Indoors, the rest of its record
has been spotless. The Bruins' top
player Yasmin Schnack is ranked No.
5 in the nation, with two teammates
ranked No. 43 and No. 48 behind her.
In doubles, they have the No. 11 team

of Andrea Remynse and Schnack.
The two biggest wins for UCLA this
season came at Indoors, where it
upset then-No. 6 Miami and then-No.
4 Florida.
USC is only a few steps behind,
but has faced a remarkably tough
schedule. With only two losses to its
name to once-top-ranked Duke and
then-No. 5 Baylor, the Women of Troy
have proven they deserve to be
among the top teams in the country.
USC has faced only ranked oppo
nents this season, with the lowest
ranked opponent being No. 65 San
Diego State. The Women of Troy's
highest-ranked individual player is
Maria Sanchez, No. 3 in the nation.
Right behind her are Alison Ramos
at No. 19, Danielle Lao at No. 31 and
Valeria Pulido at No. 51.
Forood is only happy for these two
team's successes. While it obviously
means a greater challenge for her
team, it also represents a major step
up for the Pac-10 and its recognition
on the national level.
"[At Indoors,] we were hoping
that our conference would show up
and they certainly did," Forood said.
"Cal's at [No.] 3, UCLA's at [No.] 4,
USC's at [No.] 10, and so that's im
portant for our conference. It's im
portant for all of us that we prove our
conference is the strongest one
again."
Stanford plays UCLA on Friday
at 1:30 p.m. before facing USC on Sat
urday at 12 p.m.
