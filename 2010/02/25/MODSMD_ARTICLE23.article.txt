## Walsh makes first career home run grand in Stanford win 
### â€“ By Jacob Jaffe 
Last year, the Stanford baseball team
took 13 games to get its fourth win and 48
games to get its first four-game win streak.
This year, the Cardinal achieved both in
only four games.
Stanford defeated Pacific 11-6 last night
at Sunken Diamond in a game postponed
from Tuesday night for rain.
The big blow for the Cardinal came from
junior second baseman Colin Walsh. After
nearly 300 at-bats in a Stanford uniform
without a home run, Walsh broke through
with a grand slam in the sixth to put the Car
dinal ahead for good at 8-5.
The Tigers battled the Cardinal up until
that point, as Walsh's slam was the fifth lead

change of the game. Stanford junior catcher
Zach Jones put the game out of reach with
his second home run of the season, a three
run shot in the eighth. Jones has only three
hits in 17 at-bats, but two of them have left
the yard.
Sophomore pitcher Brian Busick got the
win in relief by pitching a scoreless sixth in
ning.
The Cardinal also got great contribu
tions from its freshmen, as center fielder
Jake Stewart, left fielder Stephen Piscotty
and third baseman Kenny Diekroeger
combined for seven hits and seven runs
scored.
Stanford heads on the road for the first
time this weekend when it travels to Austin
to take on No. 1 Texas.
