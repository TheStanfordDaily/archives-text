## Cardinal finishes third in Arizona tournament 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 22 Stanford women's golf
team, after enduring brutal rain, wind
and hail weather conditions, finished
third at the Wildcat Invitational at the
Arizona National Golf Club in Tus
con,Ariz.
The Cardinal shot a 293 (nine
over-par) in the first round Monday
and was in second place behind top
ranked Arizona State (290). Arizona
was close behind Stanford with a 294.
On Tuesday, Stanford carded a sec
ond-round score of 302 (18-over) to
finish the collegiate tournament with
a 595 (27-over). The Sun Devils
gained a definitive lead with a 576, fin
ishing 19 strokes ahead of the Cardi
nal. Second-place Arizona finished
with a 588.
"We are disappointed that we did
n't finish higher, but we did beat nu
merous top-10 ranked teams," said
freshman Sally Watson. "It is encour
aging to know that we could have
played better yet we still finished
third."
Based on strong coaching connec
tions and a desire to produce a com
petitive field at their event, the Sun
Devils hosted other top-10 teams that
Stanford beat out, including No. 3
Auburn, No. 5 USC, No. 6 Tennessee,
No. 8 Duke and No. 9 Pepperdine.The
team also defeated its rival Cal by one
stroke.
Unfortunate bad weather condi
tions caused the 54-hole event to be
reduced to a 36-hole tournament, giv
ing Stanford less of a chance to catch
up to Arizona State after the first
round. However, the team wasn't
fazed by the circumstantial changes

or the challenging weather.
"It makes you focus on one shot at
a time and try not to dwell on bad
breaks they just happen in those
kinds of conditions," said junior Re
becca Durham. "Everyone fought
hard and didn't give up. The weather
was brutal and the field was stack, so
to finish at the top of the field really
proves we are a top team."
Durham helped lead Stanford
with her consistent rounds, shooting a
74 on the first day and a 75 on the sec
ond day to tie for 12th place.
Watson finished in a tie for 10th
place after shooting an even-par
round of 71 the first day and a 75 on
the second day. This was her third top
-10 finish of the season, including win
ning the individual title at Stanford's
Barnyard Invitational last week. Wat
son was within 10 shots of Oklahoma
State sophomore Caroline Hedwall
(66), who clinched the individual title
with a five-under-par finish.
Watson's freshman teammate
Krishna Wong also faired well at the
tournament, carding a 72-78 to tie for
22nd place.
"We let some opportunities slip
away from us coming down the home
stretch of the second round," Durham
said. "So there are some things we
need to improve, but we're heading in
the right direction and beginning to
reach our full potential."
The Cardinal will head next to
Moorpark Country Club in Malibu
on Monday for the Bruin-Wave Invi
tational. The tournament will feature
three rounds of golf and will conclude
on Wednesday.
