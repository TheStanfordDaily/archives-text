# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford trying to stay undefeated in Irvine 
### JUSTIN MARPOLE-BIRD 
The Stanford women's water polo
team looks to continue its strong sea
son this Saturday at the UC-Irvine In
vitational in Irvine, Calif. Stanford (9-
0,1-0 MPSF) looks to extend its sea
son-opening winning streak past the
nine it has had out of the gate.
The Cardinal opens the competi
tion as the top seed, as it continues to
sit atop the NCAA Division I rank
ings. It will open match play in Group
A on Saturday morning against UC-
San Diego.
The Cardinal's last outing was a
10-4 victory over No. 10 San Jose
State this past weekend, which gave
the Card its first Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) win of the
season. In that game, sophomore
two-meter Melissa Seidemann was
Stanford's top scorer, scoring three
goals in the win. Senior drivers Kelly
Eaton and Kelsey Holshouser and
sophomore driver Pallavi Menon
each scored twice, while senior two
meter Jessica Steffens added one
final goal in support. In goal, fresh
man Kate Baldoni got the start and
saw over a half of the action, before
junior Amber Oland took over and
stopped five shots in the final 16 min
utes. However, Baldoni did not leave
without making a lasting impression,
as she was named MPSF Mikasa
Newcomer of the Week.
Stanford has been making a habit
of grabbing this honor this now
makes the third week in a row that a
Stanford player has garnered the
honor. Baldoni's award, bestowed on
Monday, follows on the heels of Anni
ka Dries and Victoria Kennedy, who
won the honor in the previous two
weeks. Dries and Kennedy will have
an opportunity to play at their alma
mater this weekend, as the UC-San
Diego game will take place at Corona
Del Mar High School, where both
Dries, a 2-meter offense, and Kennedy,
a driver, graduated last spring.

The UC-Irvine Invitational is in its
fourth year, with Stanford winning the
2009 title. The 2010 tournament fea
tures the current top 11 programs in

the nation and 14 of the top 15. Com
petitors include No. 2 USC, No. 3 Cal,
No. 4 UCLA and No. 11 host UCI,
among others. With so many highly
ranked teams competing in Irvine
over the weekend, the tournament
presents a ripe opportunity for the
Cardinal.

"[lt's an opportunity] to solidify our
No. 1 ranking," Steffens said. "Teams
will be coming after us [but] that is
part of the fun of competition."
Although the Cardinal remains
ranked No. 1 in Division I, Eaton
pointed out that there are still plenty
of skilled opponents that the Cardinal
has yet to face.
"It will be fun to get a chance to play
some of the others that we haven't
gotten to compete against yet," she
said. "We are determined to win all
our games and maintain our number
one ranking. We will achieve this if we
play our best and execute our game
plans. We need to build and improve
every week in order to earn the na
tional championship."

The Cardinal can take solace in a
strong finish to its last outing though,
as the bulk of its offensive productivi
ty against San Jose State came in the
third quarter, opening up a 9-2 lead,
before cruising to a 10-4 final.

If the Cardinal can overcome UC-
San Diego, who enters the tourna
ment on a three-game slide, it will face
the winner of the match between Ari
zona State and Cal State Northridge.
Arizona State (4-3), ranked eighth in
the country, will be playing for the first
time since the Stanford Invitational on
Valentine's Day Weekend. The Sun
Devils are led by Mariam Salloum and
Lynlee Smith, who have each scored
11 goals, and goalkeeper Dana Har
vey, who leads the MPSF with 10.60
saves per game. Northridge (9-2) en
ters the weekend ranked No. 9 in the
national poll and has won four of its
last five games.
The Cardinal's first game begins
Saturday at 9 a.m. at Corona Del Mar,
Calif.
