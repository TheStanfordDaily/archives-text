## Former CIA head ties oil, terror Woolsey: U.S. paying for both sides of war on terror 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Former head of the Central
Intelligence Agency Jim Woolsey '63
spoke Wednesday afternoon to a
packed auditorium at Stanford Law
School about the challenges that the
future generation of policy makers will
face in the Middle East.
Woolsey pointed to the religious
influence in the region as a key to
understanding its deep-seated conflicts.
He said the separation of mosque and
state has eroded in the region during
recent decades, a development which
has had far-reaching consequences due
to certain aspects of Muslim doctrine.
"Shiite Muslims think they have to
work hard to make their savior return
to earth," Woolse said. "They believe
they need to dominate the Middle East
and kill lots of people, and that if they
can just kill enough people, then [he
will] return to earth and they will go to
heaven and we will go to hell."
"These are not cynics we are deal
ing with here," he added. "These are
honest fanatics. These are true believ
ers."
Woolsey underpinned his assess
ment of the region's political situation
by pointing out that eight of the nine
top oil-exporting countries in the world
are dictatorships or autocracies, as well
as every single nation in the world that
depends on oil for two-thirds or more
of its national income (22 countries in
total). He explained these facts by
alluding to what he called the "oil
curse."
