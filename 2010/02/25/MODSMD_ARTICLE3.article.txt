## Former CIA head ties oil, terror Woolsey: U.S. paying for both sides of war on terror 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Former head of the Central
Intelligence Agency Jim Woolsey '63
spoke Wednesday afternoon to a
packed auditorium at Stanford Law
School about the challenges that the
future generation of policy makers will
face in the Middle East.
Woolsey pointed to the religious
influence in the region as a key to
understanding its deep-seated conflicts.
He said the separation of mosque and
state has eroded in the region during
recent decades, a development which
has had far-reaching consequences due
to certain aspects of Muslim doctrine.
"Shiite Muslims think they have to
work hard to make their savior return
to earth," Woolse said. "They believe
they need to dominate the Middle East
and kill lots of people, and that if they
can just kill enough people, then [he
will] return to earth and they will go to
heaven and we will go to hell."
"These are not cynics we are deal
ing with here," he added. "These are
honest fanatics. These are true believ
ers."
Woolsey underpinned his assess
ment of the region's political situation
by pointing out that eight of the nine
top oil-exporting countries in the world
are dictatorships or autocracies, as well
as every single nation in the world that
depends on oil for two-thirds or more
of its national income (22 countries in
total). He explained these facts by
alluding to what he called the "oil
curse."
"If you have a country that is a dic
tatorship, controlled by a very small
group of people, and it comes into pos
session of a valuable commodity, then
even though that country is getting
richer, it's not getting richer in any
meaningful way that builds up a pros
perous, enfranchised middle class and
paves the way for democracy,"
Woolsey said. "That added economic
rent only enhances the wealth and the
power of those few people, consolidat
ing power in their hands."
This wealth is put to uses that "are
not in pretty much anyone's best inter
est," he said.
"By and large, it is oil money that is
funding the madrasas that teaches little
boys that becoming suicide bombers is
a good, reasonable life choice for
them," Woolsey said. "Next time you
go to a filling station, you will know
where that money is coming from. So,
to put it mildly, we are paying for both
sides of this war on terrorism."

While conceding that the Middle
East conflict has no single solution,
Woolsey stressed the importance of
reducing world dependence on oil. He
outlined several specific steps to be
taken toward accomplishing this goal,
including the increased electrification
of transportation notably, plug-in
hybrid cars and the use of advanced
biofuels.

"Within a decade, we should be
able to make a very substantial dent in
our oil dependence," Woolsey said.
Woolsey illustrated the broad logic
of his outlined strategy by drawing an
analogy to salt's role over the course of
human history.
"Salt used to be a strategic com
modity," Woolsey explained. "A coun
try could lord it over its neighbors if it
possessed salt and its countries didn't.
Then, with the 20th century came elec
tric grids and refrigerators, and salt was
no longer needed to preserve meat. It
was destroyed as a strategic commodi
ty. We should be trying to turn oil into

salt. We should be trying to make oil
boring."
Woolsey received his B.A. from
Stanford in 1963 and his LLB from
Yale Law School in 1968 after studying
as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford
University. He has served in numerous
positions in the federal government
over the decades, in both Republican
and Democrat administrations. In
recent years, he has emerged as a
leader of the movement for U.S. ener
gy independence.

Some audience members were
impressed by Woolsey's analysis.
"By putting the energy question
and the importance of findmg alterna
tive sources of energy in the context of
the political conflicts occurring in the
Middle East, Mr. Woolsey made clear
how interconnected a lot of the biggest
problems our society currently faces
are," said Teddy Steinkellner 'll.
