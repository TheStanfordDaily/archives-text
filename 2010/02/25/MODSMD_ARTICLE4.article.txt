# CORTES IS TREE
## New band mascot named early Thursday morning 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Tree Week came to a close just
before 4 a.m. Thursday morning with
the announcement of Ben "Bollox"
Cortes 'll as the next Stanford Band
mascot.

For the average student, Tree
Week means 10 days in February
when a stroll through White Plaza at
lunchtime might contain an unex
pected jousting match or video game
reenactment. But for a half-dozen
daring souls, it means a chance at a

year of glory, full of earnest displays
of rapping talent, creativity and pure
gall-
Since last Monday, the five
saplings in the race for Tree have
pulled numerous stunts, both in the
public eye and the more private eye,
in attempts to inhabit the shoes of
the Stanford Band's infamous mas
cot.
Despite the publicized nature of
some stunts many are announced
via Facebook groups and take place
in White Plaza where passersby can
stop and watch just as many stunts

occur without common knowledge.
The student body's reaction to
Tree stunts reportedly has nothing to
do with the selection process, which
is said to be led only by the current
Tree and Band management.
In the past few days, saplings have
been closing the week with a variety
of stunts, ranging from cringe-induc
ing to collaborative.

houette of a pine tree, chowed down

competed since last week to win the favor of current mascot Jon Strange '11. Ben Cortes '11 was named Tree.
in a hot dog eating contest along
side world champion Joey
Chestnut in White Plaza during
lunchtime. The large crowd
watched as the contestants showed
their best, and kept in line with
Zimbroff's patriotic theme by
chanting, "U.S.A." and "Shove 'em
in, Robbie!"
Tuesday's rain put a damper on
some stunts, including junior Ben
Cortes' "tribute" to the popular
Twilight franchise.
In front of a small crowd out
side of the Treehouse, Cortes tied
a tourniquet around his arm, and
with a needle, tube and syringe,
drew a small amount of his own
blood. He then mixed it in a glass
with vodka and lemon juice and
proceeded to drink his own a
literal Bloody Mary.
"This is the grossest shit I've
ever seen," said Jonah Rexer 'l2,
to which Cortes responded while
gesturing to his arm, "There's
more where that came from."
Wednesday's lunchtime public
stunt in White Plaza was of a more
lighthearted and cooperative
nature. Rachel Lindee 'l2 and
Chris Hadley 'lO performed an
elaborate joint stunt in which they
competed in a life-size recreation
of the video game Mario Kart.
Lindee and Hadley, dressed as
Yoshi and Luigi, respectively, rode
around on tricycles in a scene that
included the game's trademark
question mark boxes as well as
bananas that made them fall to the
ground. The stunt ended, in true
franchise fashion, with a "brawl"
that Lindee stepped in to stop in
the name of cooperation.
"[Lindee] is way more creative
than me, so I wanted to leech off
her talents," Hadley said of their
collaboration.
Although competing for Tree is
a unique opportunity for students,
most saplings agree that it's just as
exhausting as it is exhilarating.
"It's been a stressful week, but
so much fun," Lindee said. "But I
no longer have the excuse to skip
class and avoid homework."
"I'm going to feel so relieved
once it's over," Hadley agreed. "I
had an awesome time, though, and
there is nothing more I wanted to
do this week besides Tree Week."
