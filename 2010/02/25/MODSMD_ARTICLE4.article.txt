# CORTES IS TREE
## New band mascot named early Thursday morning 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Tree Week came to a close just
before 4 a.m. Thursday morning with
the announcement of Ben "Bollox"
Cortes 'll as the next Stanford Band
mascot.

For the average student, Tree
Week means 10 days in February
when a stroll through White Plaza at
lunchtime might contain an unex
pected jousting match or video game
reenactment. But for a half-dozen
daring souls, it means a chance at a

year of glory, full of earnest displays
of rapping talent, creativity and pure
gall-
Since last Monday, the five
saplings in the race for Tree have
pulled numerous stunts, both in the
public eye and the more private eye,
in attempts to inhabit the shoes of
the Stanford Band's infamous mas
cot.
Despite the publicized nature of
some stunts many are announced
via Facebook groups and take place
in White Plaza where passersby can
stop and watch just as many stunts

occur without common knowledge.
The student body's reaction to
Tree stunts reportedly has nothing to
do with the selection process, which
is said to be led only by the current
Tree and Band management.
In the past few days, saplings have
been closing the week with a variety
of stunts, ranging from cringe-induc
ing to collaborative.
On Monday, Robbie Zimbroff'l2,
with his chest hair waxed in the sil
houette of a pine tree, chowed down
