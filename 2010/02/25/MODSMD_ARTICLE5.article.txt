## Military, academia debate selective service 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Before he was a general in the United
States Marine Corps, fighting in Vietnam
and earning a four-star service medal,
Orlo Steele '55 was a strapping political
science student at Stanford. And it was
here where he came to oppose the draft.
The moon shone brightly on a spring
night in 1951, and the men of Encina Flail
were restless. Then, someone yelled the
magic words down the halls: "panty raid."
"The juices were running," Steele
recalled. Young men tripped over them
selves as they rushed across campus to
congregate outside Roble Flail, where,
from the windows, the women of Stanford
waived their lingerie at 650 pairs of panti
ng eyes below.
"We were going to rush the place,"
Steele said, and not a policeman was in
sight.
But in the Roble courtyard, standing in
front of a floodlight and wielding only a
megaphone, was a dean who knew exact
ly how to deter the wild pack. "Anybody
who gets into Roble tonight will be classi
fied 1-A tomorrow," the dean delivered a
faux threat to the crowd. In other words,
they would become eligible for the mili
tary draft.
And immediately, the crowd dispersed.
Wednesday evening, Steele joined Law
School Dean Larry Kramer, emeritus his
tory Prof. James Sheehan '5B and Hoover

senior fellow Martin Anderson, for a
roundtable discussion on the history and
present feasibility of the military draft.
Phil Taubman '7O, consulting professor at
the Center for International Security and
Cooperation, moderated.
Taubman, recalling his years covering
Stanford for The Daily, said campuses
across the country unraveled during the
Vietnam War years because the draft lent
"a kind of immediacy to people and their
families and their friends." One night, stu
dents here lit the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps (ROTC) building on fire.
"There's no question the draft was a
powerful engine that led people to think
seriously about the war," Taubman said,
"or, in many cases, oppose the war."
Sheehan, examining modern-day
drafts, offered a comparative perspective.
Germany's conscription model, he said,
would be the most compatible with
American society, if the United States
were to implement selective service.
German men are able to opt for civil serv
ice in medicine and other welfare agen
cies, and about half of them do so.
Kramer said he believes some kind of
universal service one that is not limited
only to military service, but which also
includes the option of civil service
should eventually be implemented in the
United States.

Anderson, who said he, as director of
research for Richard Nixon's 1968 presi
dential campaign, proposed an end to the

draft even before Nixon was elected, reit
erated on Wednesday his opposition to
the draft.

"I didn't like the people who didn't
want to be there," Anderson said bluntly
of conscripted men drafted into war. "You
want very strong people who know what
they're doing."
Audience members of Wednesday's
roundtable, who consisted of veterans and
ROTC students, among others, eventually
brought the discussion forward to the
present day. Asked whether the use of
predator drones in regions such as
Afghanistan diminishes the need for a
draft, Steele rejected any connection
between the two.
"Whoever is running those robots
probably has been under intensive train
ing for a number of years," Steele said, "so
I don't see a draft influencing that."
Steele further said a draft would be
unnecessary if the United States opened a
"third front" that is, another war on top
of those in Iraq and Afghanistan. "This
last January, all military units met their
recruiting goals," he said, acknowledging
the likely role of a recessive economy and
sluggish job market in that trend.
The retired general ended the discus
sion by suggesting a question to those
Americans who favor a return of the
draft: Is selective service intended to pro
vide for common defense or for general
welfare? That is, to actually defend
the country or to instill certain values
in the country's young men?
"I believe it's the latter," he said.
