## Case makes case for entrepreneurship 
### CAITY MONROE 
Failure: it's as important for entrepreneurs as success.
That was the message from Steve Case, the co-founder of
AOL, at his Entrepreneurship Week (E-Week) lecture
Wednesday afternoon, where he discussed the ups and downs of
entrepreneurship and the essential principles for success of any
initiative â€” business or otherwise.
Case kept his message simple, summarizing his perspective on
ingredients for success with the "three Ps": people, passion and
perseverance.
"If you have all of those things in the right balance, anything
is possible," said Case, who is also the CEO of the investment

firm Revolution. "If you don't, noth
ing is possible."
Case explained the role of the
"three Ps" in his own career, focusing
on the excitement of founding AOL.
According to Case, perseverance was
an especially crucial component of
AOL's early stages, eventually leading
to its success.
"Perseverance really does matter,"
he said. "AOL seemed to come out of
nowhere ... but really, we were a 10-
year-in-the-making overnight sensa
tion."
Case said that despite many
detractors and "ups and downs" in the

early days, "thankfully there were enough people that believed in
it and stuck with it."
He also called AOL's merger with Time Warner in 2000 "the
worst merger in history," describing it as a "great idea with failed
execution."
Those in attendance appreciated the range of Case's entre
preneurial wisdom, which stems from a background of both tri
umphs and pitfalls.
"He was in the boom time and he was also there for the fail
ure with the worst merger in history," said Salak Syed '10, an offi
cer for the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Seminar (ETL).
"He has that really vast perspective of being in the good and the
bad times."
"I really liked how he talked about his successes, but he also
acknowledged that his failure was a really big failure, and he was
able to laugh about it," said Nikil Viswanathan '10, ETL co-pres
ident.


STEVE CASE
ETL and E-Week are both spon
sored in part by the Business
Association of Stanford
Entrepreneurial Students (BASES).
A sense of philanthropic respon
sibility permeated Case's discussion
on entrepreneurship's function in the
world today, as he emphasized its
role in solving some of today's eco
nomic troubles.
"Our country is struggling a bit
with an economic malaise and only
one thing will get it back on track" he
said. "Entrepreneurship really is crit
ical in this country ... it's not just
something to do to make a buck. It
really is the underlying engine of
innovation that will ensure a better
future."
Attendees were impressed by
what they saw as Case's own dedica
tion to his work.
"He's more focused on what's
going to make a difference and
what's going to solve problems," said
Lionel Guillou, a graduate student in
biomechanical engineering. "I
respect him so much more than the
people that do short term and incre
mental advances that are profitable,
but don't help the society they're
part of."
"He has enough money to just
chill out, but he still values being in
the game. That self-awareness is very
unique," agreed Alan Guo 'll.
Case's lecture was one of many
events of Stanford's E-Week, which
is an annual event sponsored by local
businesses and business-oriented
student groups.
