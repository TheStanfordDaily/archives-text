## Seminar clarifies cancer guidelines 
### IVY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Traditional cancer prevention campaigns stress that regular
screening and early detection are key to survival, so when the U.S.
Preventative Task Force (USPTF) changed its breast cancer
screening guidelines last November to recommend less frequent
screenings for women, controversy and confusion quickly arose.
To explain what these recommendations mean and correct
common misunderstandings about the changes, Stanford Cancer
Center and Stanford Hospital & Clinics invited the public to a
seminar entitled "Controversies In Women's Cancer Screening,"
held Wednesday night. Moderated by gynecology Prof. Jonathan
Berek, the seminar featured two experts on breast cancer.
"It was something that a group of us had been talking about
since the [USPTF] modified their recommendations," said pan
elist Robert Carlson, professor of oncology at Stanford Medical
Center. "Many of us just thought it would be helpful to try to pro
vide a more balanced perspective in what we thought we were
hearing around us."
USPTF now recommends that women over the age of 50, who
are not at high risk of developing breast cancer, undergo mammo
gram screening every other year, instead of the previous recom
mendation of yearly screening starting at age 40. Other recom
mendations include stopping the practice of teaching women to
self-exam their breasts.
One reason for postponing the start of regular screening is the
fact that younger women have more dense breast tissue, making
it difficult for radiologists and doctors to spot the cancer, said
Debra Ikeda, professor of diagnostic radiology. The dense tissue
can also lead to false positives, causing patients to undergo unnec
essary and often painful and expensive follow-up biopsies.
Biopsies carry the risk of infection, bleeding, scars, distortion of
the appearance of the breast and defects in the contour of the
breast. Many biopsies also require general anesthesia, which has
its own associated risks.
The new guidelines also recommend that physicians stop
teaching women how to self-exam their breasts to check for can
cer because studies show that self-exams often do not make a dif
ference in treatment. While these examinations do not directly
harm patients, this practice also has unseen negative conse
quences.
