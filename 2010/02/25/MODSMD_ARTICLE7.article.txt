## Seminar clarifies cancer guidelines 
### IVY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Traditional cancer prevention campaigns stress that regular
screening and early detection are key to survival, so when the U.S.
Preventative Task Force (USPTF) changed its breast cancer
screening guidelines last November to recommend less frequent
screenings for women, controversy and confusion quickly arose.
To explain what these recommendations mean and correct
common misunderstandings about the changes, Stanford Cancer
Center and Stanford Hospital & Clinics invited the public to a
seminar entitled "Controversies In Women's Cancer Screening,"
held Wednesday night. Moderated by gynecology Prof. Jonathan
Berek, the seminar featured two experts on breast cancer.
"It was something that a group of us had been talking about
since the [USPTF] modified their recommendations," said pan
elist Robert Carlson, professor of oncology at Stanford Medical
Center. "Many of us just thought it would be helpful to try to pro
vide a more balanced perspective in what we thought we were
hearing around us."
USPTF now recommends that women over the age of 50, who
are not at high risk of developing breast cancer, undergo mammo
gram screening every other year, instead of the previous recom
mendation of yearly screening starting at age 40. Other recom
mendations include stopping the practice of teaching women to
self-exam their breasts.
One reason for postponing the start of regular screening is the
fact that younger women have more dense breast tissue, making
it difficult for radiologists and doctors to spot the cancer, said
Debra Ikeda, professor of diagnostic radiology. The dense tissue
can also lead to false positives, causing patients to undergo unnec
essary and often painful and expensive follow-up biopsies.
Biopsies carry the risk of infection, bleeding, scars, distortion of
the appearance of the breast and defects in the contour of the
breast. Many biopsies also require general anesthesia, which has
its own associated risks.
The new guidelines also recommend that physicians stop
teaching women how to self-exam their breasts to check for can
cer because studies show that self-exams often do not make a dif
ference in treatment. While these examinations do not directly
harm patients, this practice also has unseen negative conse
quences.
"Any time we have a health care
professional realizing they have a lim
ited amount of time with a patient
talking about things that turn out not
to matter, you can't talk about things
that do matter," Carlson said. "You
can't talk about diet, you can't talk
about smoking cessation, you can't
talk about exercise."

The Bay Area has the second
highest incidence of breast cancer in
any of the major metropolitan areas
in the U.S., and the majority of the
attendees Wednesday were women,
many of whom are breast cancer sur
vivors or have loved ones who had
breast cancer. Many of them
expressed outrage at the new guide
lines.

"It's insane," said Lisa Skagg, a
community member. "Early detection
saves lives. I have two friends who've
had cancer in their 30s. It's not just the
mammograms, it's the no self-check
ing. How is anybody before 50 ever
going to find out they have cancer?"
"I think it's dangerous," said
Marina Chudnovskaya, a breast can
cer survivor who was diagnosed at the
age of 44. "I had no risk factors, none
of them... so according to these new
guidelines I would have not been
screened or just recommended for
screening until the age of 50."
Chudnovskaya said she was diag

nosed "only by chance" at her routine
yearly mammogram. She said that
had she waited another six years, she
"would probably be dead by then."
Katherine Fuh, an oncology fellow
at UCSF and Stanford, has a different
take on the issue.

"I think that the data support the
recommendation," she said.
She noted that a conflict, however,
will exist between the research con
clusions.

"I think that it's always ingrained
in us to do a Pap smear every year or
do mammograms more frequently
than not, so I think that there's just
going to be a conflict between know
ing what this data in the research
show versus what you're used to
doing and telling your patients for
many years," she continued.

While doctors are not mandated
to follow these guidelines, many
insurance companies base their poli
cies off of USPTF guidelines, which
can make it difficult for women
whose doctors recommend annual
screening before the age of 50.
"It's a social issue and a public
health issue that's very important that
we address in our society," Berek said.
Despite the consensus among the
speakers, the medical community
remains split between the two guide
lines.

"It's critical that we study it more
and we study it better," Berek said.
"It's not over yet."
