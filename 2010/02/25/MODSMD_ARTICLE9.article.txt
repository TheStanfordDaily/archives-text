## VITAL ORGANIST IN 11 YEARS, MORGAN HITS ALL THE RIGHT NOTES 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
Performing the complete works of
Johann Sebastian Bach is no
small task, but for University
organist Robert Huw Morgan,
it's all Bach, all the time.
"It's the beginning and end of all
music," Morgan explained. Beginning this
past summer, Morgan undertook the
daunting musical feat and plans to finish
the complete works of Bach in 14 concerts
at Memorial Church by the end of this
school year.
Morgan took over the position of
University organist in 1999 and began his
career playing the organ at services in
MemChu. By his second year, he became a
lecturer at the Stanford School of Music,
and today he's also the conductor of both
the Stanford University Singers and the
Memorial Church Choir.
Although his musical experiences
began with violin lessons at age nine,
Morgan said that it was "love at first sight"
the first time he heard an organ live. He
began playing the organ regularly as a
teenager, and it was in high school that he
realized it was something he could happily
spend his life doing.
"I momentarily entertained thoughts of
reading for a law degree," Morgan admit
ted, though this pragmatic career path was
shortly quelled by his passion for music.
After studying music at Cambridge
University in the late 80s, Morgan spent
five years as a schoolteacher in Wales and
England and toured as part of a violin
piano duet. He would later return to
school in 1999 to earn two Doctor of
Musical Arts degrees in organ perform
ance and orchestral conducting from the
University of Washington.
It was at Washington where Morgan

moved more deeply into the world of
choral and opera conducting. Sounding
both pained and nostalgic at the memory,
Morgan recounted the feeling of simulta
neously conducting dozens of musicians
and distracted on-stage performers.
"Conducting opera is a challenge," he
said. "But it's so rewarding."
This year's Bach concert series is a cel
ebration of Morgan's 10th year at Stanford
as well as the 25th anniversary of
MemChu's Fisk-Nanney organ, a
Baroque-style instrument of 73 ranks and
4,422 pipes.
"You've really got to tame the Fisk and
show it who's boss," Morgan said. "But it's
such a spectacular instrument. It's the
most beautiful instrument I've ever
played."
Morgan is an experienced performer of
complete organ works â€”he has also
played the complete works of Dieterich
Buxtehude, Nicolas de Grigny and
Francois Couperin, though he admits that
none of these matched the caliber of
Bach's pieces.
As Morgan is quick to tell anyone,
Bach's music is one of the great loves of his
life.
"Bach's music is so perfect. It's so ...
you know?" he said.
The greatest challenge for Morgan so
far has been following through with the
immense commitment. Although he had
already spent many years playing several
of Bach's larger pieces, including two of six
"fiercely difficult" sonatas, Morgan spent
last summer forcing himself to learn the
other four.
Morgan also dedicated three weeks to
another essential component of the con
cert series: organizing the program.
"You want the programming to be user
friendly for the audience," he explained.
"You can't sit down and play nothing but

preludes and fugues so what you do is
mix and match."
According to Alejandra Martinez TO, a
music major in her third year with the
University Singers, Morgan is an excellent
concert programmer with a knack for
bringing down the house with the last
piece.
"He does a really great job of revealing
aspects of Bach to everyone who goes to
one of his concerts," she said.
About 400 audience members attend
each organ performance, with many repeat
listeners from across the Bay Area.
Caroline Chen 'l2, a writer for The
Daily and member of the Stanford
University Singers who takes weekly
organ lessons from Morgan, encouraged
students to attend the remaining Bach
concerts.
"He's a born teacher," said Chen, who

feels that she's learned a great deal in her
past two years working with Morgan.
"He's studied so much and clearly knows
his stuff, but at the same time I don't feel
overwhelmed as a student."
This sentiment was echoed among
Morgan's other students as well.
University Singers manager Heidi Farrell
'lO said that despite Morgan's world
acclaim as an organist and historical musi
cologist, the organist is far from aloof. She
called him "extremely reachable" and a
man with "zero ego."
Morgan feels the same about his stu
dents.
"It's a fabulous privilege for me to deal
with such talented students," Morgan said.
"God, I get paid for this."
