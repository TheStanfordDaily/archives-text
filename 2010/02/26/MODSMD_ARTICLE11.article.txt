## Small fire empties Allen Center Approx. 150 people evacuated during incident 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
A small flash fire occurred in the Paul G.
Allen Center for Integrated Systems annex
Thursday afternoon, setting off smoke detec
tors and forcing the evacuation of some 150
people from the annex and the main CIS
building. There were no injuries.
Palo Alto Fire Department, the Stanford
Department of Public Safety and University
Environmental Health and Safety officials,
concerned with potentially hazardous mate
rials in the lab, responded, cordoning off Via
Ortega and parts of Serra Mall from traffic
for about two hours.

According to Larry Gibbs, the associate
vice provost for environmental health and
safety, and other CIS staffers, the fire broke
out just after 1 p.m. when a group of lab
researchers attempted to clean a thin metal
liner that is part of the molecular beam epi
taxy (MEB) equipment that the lab houses.
When scraping a small amount of residue
off of the interior of the chamber, a fire ignit
ed within the vessel, causing a large amount
of smoke to exit.
The researchers, at least several of whom
were doctoral students, pulled the fire alarm
and left the building, said fire department
spokeswoman Susan Minchall.
The researchers were wearing respirators
and Tyvek suits; none were reported injured.
The fire had gone out by the time firemen
arrived. Concerned that health hazards may
have been posed by the chemical materials in
the lab, responders switched to hazardous
materials protocol and made sure the entire
building was evacuated.
The Stanford Department of Public
Safety closed Via Ortega and Serra Mall to
traffic, reopening both streets at about 3:05
p.m.

"It probably wasn't much of a fire," Gibbs
said. "More, a lot of smoke."
Coincidentally, Allen had been scheduled
for a test of its emergency horns and strobe
lights between 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. Friday,
and a silent test of its smoke detectors from
7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Gibbs said these tests
would proceed as planned.
The lab, located at the northwest end of
the first floor of the Allen building, is the
James D. Fleming lab run by electrical engi

neering professor Jim Harris. Harris was not
immediately available for comment on
Thursday afternoon; it is unclear whether he
was in the lab when the fire flared.
A sign on the door of the lab called the
room the "Mostly Broken Equipment Lab,"
a joke on the MEB equipment the lab hous
es. The equipment can difficult to maintain
and clean, said Ed Myers, a science and engi
neering associate at the Stanford
Nanofabrication Facility in the main CIS
building.
The door sign also listed the names of

seven people, including at least five Ph.D.
students who work for Harris, some of whom
appeared Thursday afternoon to be back in
the lab "buttoning everything down," accord
ing to Kevin Kinast of Environmental Health
& Safety, who was also on the scene.
Myers said that the facility's toxic gas
monitoring systems are used by the adjacent
annex, which is why he and others in CIS
were alerted to the fire alarm and evacuated.

He said a large stainless steel chamber
contained thin metal liners that lab
researchers were cleaning on Thursday, a
maintenance practice they do about every
two years. Chemical residue from past exper
iments was being scrubbed away; just
removed from a high-pressure vacuum, the
residue may have oxidized and "energetical
ly" released heat, Myers said.

It was an "exothermic reaction that kind
of got away from them," Myers added.
"Students have a tendency to take risks."
Some 150 people work in the CIS building
and annex, according to a phone directory.

review Thursday's incident and recommend
