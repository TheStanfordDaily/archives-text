## THE 						MANY FACES OF CARL DJERASSI Chemist, playwright, teacher, collator and Nixon's enemy 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
-w- n 1983, Carl Djerassi was undoubtedly an
I accomplished man. A world-renowned
I chemist whose development of a synthet-
I ic hormone led to the first oral contracep
-A-tive pill, he had already built, at 59, an
extremely successful scientific career.
And then he got dumped.
"When the woman I loved very much left
me, I was left with simple, typical, macho
revenge," he said, chuckling to himself. In the
next year, he veered away from chemistry and
channeled his vengeful energy first into poetry,
then into a 331-page manuscript for his first
novel.
Since then, Djerassi has published seven
works of fiction and four plays almost all
dealing with the drama of science and has no
intention of slowing down.
Literary Inclinations
At 86, Djerassi's wavy white hair and robust
beard frame a face that is deceivingly young. His
walk is the only thing that gives him away a
slow, deliberate gait hindered by a stiff leg and a
limp that he nevertheless manages to render
dignified.
In his spacious office in the basement of
Stauffer chemistry building, Djerassi maneu
vered his way into a chair and carefully lifted his
foot onto a collapsible footrest. He was well
aware of the focus of most of his press coverage.
"As you can well imagine, most people much
of the time keep talking about the pill," he said
in a hint of an accent the only indication of
German as his mother tongue. "But firstly, this
was 1951, before I came to Stanford, so it has
nothing to do with Stanford. And secondly, it
was over half a century ago."
Instead, he spoke fondly of his third wife,
Diane Middlebrook a professor emerita of
english at Stanford who passed away in 2007
the woman who shattered his ego almost three
decades ago. They reunited and married after
the separation on the condition that he never
publish the revenge-driven novel that she
inspired.
"What really convinced me was when she
said, 'You know, it's not really very good,'
because she was, you know, a superb writer and
a distinguished critic," he said. But she was
impressed by his dedication that produced an
entire novel in a year a disciplined approach
he credits to his rigorous background in scientif
ic writing.
As the only child of two physicians, he pur
sued a medical education without question,
eventually discovering an affinity and talent for
chemistry. But his artistic inclinations were
always present if not visible â€”he even har
bored early ambitions to become a professional
cello player.
"Cello has always been my favorite musical
instrument, but I realized that I was completely
passable," he mused. "I'm a very ambitious per
son, though if I do something, I want to do it
well and be recognized, which is stupid, per
haps." He paused. "But it's a fact. So I said, for
get about it."

"Science-in-Fiction"
His office, rather than displaying his chem
istry accolades, is covered wall-to-wall with
shelves of his novels and posters from various
runs of his plays. His first dramatic work, An
Immaculate Misconception, discusses the pioneer
ing of an artificial fertilization process, but it deals
just as closely with the idiosyncratic and often
misunderstood culture of scientific academia.
This is what Djerassi considers unique about
his works: their scientific subjects and the inher
ent educational quality that accompanies them.
"I realized that if I wanted my ideas to reach a
wider audience, doing it through scientific articles
would get me nowhere," he said. "I wanted to talk
to the 99 percent of people who are not just anti
scientific; they're ascientific or afraid of it."
This gave birth to "science-in-fiction"
which, he emphasizes, is very different from "sci
ence fiction" a genre that uses fictional forms
to analyze the ethical, moral and personal dilem
mas that often arise in the "tribal culture" of sci
ence, as he characterizes it.
After his success with novels, he moved to "sci
ence-in-fiction" drama around 2000 after being
inspired by a similar scientific play. He prefers
drama because of the ever-evolving nature of a
play: even after it has been published as a script,
everyone interprets it differently, giving it new
life.
But the overlap between science and literature
remains scant, and Djerassi is painfully aware of
this.
"I'm really sitting between two schools," he
said. "To the literary establishment, I'm still the
outsider chemist who's sticking his nose in a field
that's not his business. And to the chemists, I'm
wasting my time."
"Science-in-Theatre": A New Genre?
Djerassi's class meets once a week, for three
hours, on Monday evenings. But instead of biking
to class, students gather at the Tresidder bollards
at 5 p.m. to carpool into the heart of San
Francisco, where an opulent apartment building
perches at the top of a hill.

"This is the adventure part," said Acata Felton
'l2 of the weekly drive up the peninsula.
One by one, the cars arrive at Djerassi's apart
ment building. The elevator on his floor opens
into a deep royal blue hallway, with constellations
and German poetry covering the wall in gold
paint. On a wall, the words "Sic manebimus in
pace" ("thus we will remain in peace") lie next to
the molecular diagram for the birth control pill
hormone.
Inside, a vast collection of art decorates the
walls: a dozen originals of Paul Klee Djerassi's
favorite artist, whose works he has collected for
decades sculptures of heads, enormous wall
sculptures and a colorful chair. At night, the Bay
Bridge shimmers through the window and on
the opposite side of the apartment, the Golden
Gate.
Although technically emeritus since 2002,
Djerassi still teaches one sophomore seminar a
year, which gives credit in either drama or chem
istry. They discuss "science-in-theatre," using both
his own plays as well as those of other play
wrights. Over dinner, the students debate the his
torical background of the plays, question the eth
ical problems raised and rewrite and act the end
ings of the plays they read.
Although normally quite chatty, Djerassi
munches placidly on his naan while the students
present their take on this week's set of plays. The
topic tonight is Newton.
Djerassi pauses to insert his opinion.
"Newton was one of the biggest shits of his
time," he states matter-of-factly. The class laughs.
"But he was also, no doubt, one of the greatest sci
entists."
At the end of the evening which usually
extends past the set time the students face a
long ride home. But it's worth it.
"He's great he's like a synthesis of a cute
old man, accomplished chemist, and playwright,"
said Stephanie Muscat 'l3.
A Man of Small Pleasures
Carl Djerassi's accomplishments range much
further than simply chemistry and playwriting. He
was on Nixon's "enemies list," and his face graces
a stamp in his native Austria. His collection of
Paul Klee artwork is often displayed at the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Djerassi has
led a class of graduate students to publish the first
piece of fiction in the scientific journal Nature
or as he likes to put it, "the first time in 160 years
that Nature had published an intentional mis
take."
But at his heart, he remains a man of small
pleasures.
He recalls with admiration his third wife's crit
ical take on his fiction, her ability to separate their
relationship from her analysis.
"She was a fierce critic always able to say, 'I
adore you, but this is bullshit,'" he said.
After he showed her Marx, Deceased his
first and only foray into non-scientific fiction
she was silent until she finished. Finally, he
recalls, she turned to him and said simply,
"Chemist, this is good."
"And that was the highest praise I've ever
had of any book of mine that I've ever written,"
he said with a small smile.

"He's great he's like a synthesis of a cute

said Stephanie Muscat 'l3.
A Man of Small Pleasures
Carl Djerassi's accomplishments range much
further than simply chemistry and playwriting. He
was on Nixon's "enemies list," and his face graces
a stamp in his native Austria. His collection of
Paul Klee artwork is often displayed at the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Djerassi has
led a class of graduate students to publish the first
piece of fiction in the scientific journal Nature
or as he likes to put it, "the first time in 160 years
that Nature had published an intentional mis
take."
But at his heart, he remains a man of small
pleasures.
He recalls with admiration his third wife's crit
ical take on his fiction, her ability to separate their
relationship from her analysis.
"She was a fierce critic always able to say, 'I
adore you, but this is bullshit,'" he said.
After he showed her Marx, Deceased his
first and only foray into non-scientific fiction
she was silent until she finished. Finally, he
recalls, she turned to him and said simply,
"Chemist, this is good."
"And that was the highest praise I've ever
had of any book of mine that I've ever written,"
he said with a small smile.

Carl Djerassi, known for his contributions to
the first oral contraceptive, currently writes
"science-in-fiction" and teaches a seminar on
the same topic.
-w- n 1983, Carl Djerassi was undoubtedly an
I accomplished man. A world-renowned
I chemist whose development of a synthet-
I ic hormone led to the first oral contracep
-A-tive pill, he had already built, at 59, an
extremely successful scientific career.
And then he got dumped.
"When the woman I loved very much left
me, I was left with simple, typical, macho
revenge," he said, chuckling to himself. In the
next year, he veered away from chemistry and
channeled his vengeful energy first into poetry,
then into a 331-page manuscript for his first
novel.
Since then, Djerassi has published seven
works of fiction and four plays almost all
dealing with the drama of science and has no
intention of slowing down.
Literary Inclinations
At 86, Djerassi's wavy white hair and robust
beard frame a face that is deceivingly young. His
walk is the only thing that gives him away a
slow, deliberate gait hindered by a stiff leg and a
limp that he nevertheless manages to render
dignified.
In his spacious office in the basement of
Stauffer chemistry building, Djerassi maneu
vered his way into a chair and carefully lifted his
foot onto a collapsible footrest. He was well
aware of the focus of most of his press coverage.
"As you can well imagine, most people much
of the time keep talking about the pill," he said
in a hint of an accent the only indication of
German as his mother tongue. "But firstly, this
was 1951, before I came to Stanford, so it has
nothing to do with Stanford. And secondly, it
was over half a century ago."
Instead, he spoke fondly of his third wife,
Diane Middlebrook a professor emerita of
english at Stanford who passed away in 2007
the woman who shattered his ego almost three
decades ago. They reunited and married after
the separation on the condition that he never
publish the revenge-driven novel that she
inspired.
"What really convinced me was when she
said, 'You know, it's not really very good,'
because she was, you know, a superb writer and
a distinguished critic," he said. But she was
impressed by his dedication that produced an
entire novel in a year a disciplined approach
he credits to his rigorous background in scientif
ic writing.
As the only child of two physicians, he pur
sued a medical education without question,
eventually discovering an affinity and talent for
chemistry. But his artistic inclinations were
always present if not visible â€”he even har
bored early ambitions to become a professional
cello player.
"Cello has always been my favorite musical
instrument, but I realized that I was completely
passable," he mused. "I'm a very ambitious per
son, though if I do something, I want to do it
well and be recognized, which is stupid, per
haps." He paused. "But it's a fact. So I said, for
get about it."

"Science-in-Fiction"
His office, rather than displaying his chem
istry accolades, is covered wall-to-wall with
shelves of his novels and posters from various
runs of his plays. His first dramatic work, An
Immaculate Misconception, discusses the pioneer
ing of an artificial fertilization process, but it deals
just as closely with the idiosyncratic and often
misunderstood culture of scientific academia.
This is what Djerassi considers unique about
his works: their scientific subjects and the inher
ent educational quality that accompanies them.
"I realized that if I wanted my ideas to reach a
wider audience, doing it through scientific articles
would get me nowhere," he said. "I wanted to talk
to the 99 percent of people who are not just anti
scientific; they're ascientific or afraid of it."
This gave birth to "science-in-fiction"
which, he emphasizes, is very different from "sci
ence fiction" a genre that uses fictional forms
to analyze the ethical, moral and personal dilem
mas that often arise in the "tribal culture" of sci
ence, as he characterizes it.
After his success with novels, he moved to "sci
ence-in-fiction" drama around 2000 after being
inspired by a similar scientific play. He prefers
drama because of the ever-evolving nature of a
play: even after it has been published as a script,
everyone interprets it differently, giving it new
life.
But the overlap between science and literature
remains scant, and Djerassi is painfully aware of
this.
"I'm really sitting between two schools," he
said. "To the literary establishment, I'm still the
outsider chemist who's sticking his nose in a field
that's not his business. And to the chemists, I'm
wasting my time."
"Science-in-Theatre": A New Genre?
Djerassi's class meets once a week, for three
hours, on Monday evenings. But instead of biking
to class, students gather at the Tresidder bollards
at 5 p.m. to carpool into the heart of San
Francisco, where an opulent apartment building
perches at the top of a hill.

"This is the adventure part," said Acata Felton
'l2 of the weekly drive up the peninsula.
One by one, the cars arrive at Djerassi's apart
ment building. The elevator on his floor opens
into a deep royal blue hallway, with constellations
and German poetry covering the wall in gold
paint. On a wall, the words "Sic manebimus in
pace" ("thus we will remain in peace") lie next to
the molecular diagram for the birth control pill
hormone.
Inside, a vast collection of art decorates the
walls: a dozen originals of Paul Klee Djerassi's
favorite artist, whose works he has collected for
decades sculptures of heads, enormous wall
sculptures and a colorful chair. At night, the Bay
Bridge shimmers through the window and on
the opposite side of the apartment, the Golden
Gate.
Although technically emeritus since 2002,
Djerassi still teaches one sophomore seminar a
year, which gives credit in either drama or chem
istry. They discuss "science-in-theatre," using both
his own plays as well as those of other play
wrights. Over dinner, the students debate the his
torical background of the plays, question the eth
ical problems raised and rewrite and act the end
ings of the plays they read.
Although normally quite chatty, Djerassi
munches placidly on his naan while the students
present their take on this week's set of plays. The
topic tonight is Newton.
Djerassi pauses to insert his opinion.
"Newton was one of the biggest shits of his
time," he states matter-of-factly. The class laughs.
"But he was also, no doubt, one of the greatest sci
entists."
At the end of the evening which usually
extends past the set time the students face a
long ride home. But it's worth it.
"He's great he's like a synthesis of a cute
old man, accomplished chemist, and playwright,"
said Stephanie Muscat 'l3.
