## EDITORIAL Support Stanford Daily special fees 
### 
The time has come again for the count
less student groups of Stanford to
begin petitioning for special fees fund
ing. As such, it is likely that most students by
now have received at least a handful of e
mails imploring them to vote for the special
fees funding of certain groups. We, the Edito
rial Board, would like to take a more public
approach by asking you here and now to sign
the petition for Stanford Daily special fees.
Whatever your personal opinion about
The Daily may be, one fact simply cannot be
contested, and this is that The Daily contin
ues to serve a vital need here on campus. As
the University's only daily news publication
that is entirely student-run, The Daily is the
average student's best source for perspective
on what is going on around campus. More
than that, it also serves as one of the few open
forums for discourse about campus affairs,
continually publishing op-eds and commen
tary by diverse members of the Stanford
community, from regular students and alum
ni to ASSU Senators and University admin
istrators.
Today, as the individual contribution of

special fees funding per student continues to
rise, many have grown to resent the special
fees process entirely, asking why, in these eco
nomic times, they should lend their financial
support to groups they are not part of and
from which they do not directly benefit. The
Editorial Board cannot speak for other spe
cial fees groups. But one thing we do know is
that the vast majority of students have bene
fited and continued to benefit from The
Daily. Whether you read The Daily religious
ly or just glance at it occasionally, most stu
dents still appreciate having this kind of reg
ular campus news coverage available to
them. Now, all The Daily is asking is for stu
dents to help continue to provide daily re
porting of what is going on at Stanford.
That is why we, the Editorial Board, ask you
to take the time to go to http://petitions.stan
ford.edu/petitions/daily and lend your support
to help The Daily keep this service going. Some
special fees groups may be questionable, but
the Editorial Board really thinks this one
should be a no-brainer. As one of our members
rightly put it, if you can't fund your student
newspaper, then what can you fund?
