# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## "iWeek: Immigration Week" 
### Aysha Bagchi 
As the daughter of an immigrant, immi
gration and questions of citizenship
have always been a part of how I un
derstand the world. But it was not until last
year, when I went to Arizona on an Alterna
tive Spring Break trip focused on immigra
tion, that I developed a deeper sensitivity to
these issues.
My spring break trip involved a variety of
experiences, from volunteering with an aid
organization that provides water in the
desert to touring the largest border patrol fa
cility in the country, as well as speaking with
border patrol officers, immigration lawyers
and various activists in Arizona. For two
nights, we camped in tents and experienced
the bitter cold that migrants feel as they tra
verse the dangerous terrain by night, the time
when they are least likely to be spotted. Dur
ing the hot afternoon, we hiked the migrant
trails, where scattered clothing, backpacks,
energy drink cans and water bottles pressed
upon us a strong sense of human presence
and movement.
Experiencing the trails firsthand quickly
reminds a visitor of the hundreds of bodies
found in the desert each year. The graves and
memorials that mark remembered deaths in
tensify the closeness of these lives; in me, they
prompted a more critical reflection on immi
gration, particularly on its causes and how
nations respond.
Immigration is a global issue of economic
disparity and poverty. It is no coincidence
that Columbia professor Jeffrey Sachs, in his
talk last week, emphasized allowing freer mi
gration as part of the fight to end extreme
poverty. The U.S. experience of deaths in the
desert illustrates how poverty is a driving
force. Migration is inevitable in a world with
drastically richer and poorer states, and any
critical understanding of immigration must
keep this in mind. But beyond alleviating
poverty, the topic of immigration also chal
lenges us to think about our national and
global identities.
As students in an increasingly globalized
age, we experience the rest of the world in
unprecedented ways through studying and
volunteering abroad, traveling as tourists, in
teracting with international students, keep
ing up with the news, Facebooking, Twitter
ing and the list goes on. Our consciousness of
those beyond our borders is so much greater
than that of previous generations, and it is
still increasing. We can see ourselves in the
20-year-old Iranian protesting in the streets
and the Haitian who has lost everything to
the hands of nature. Our shared identity is
pressed upon us. And yet we live in a world of
nation-states, of countries with special obli
gations to their own citizens. Reconciling the
tensions caused by this mixed identity can be
difficult and is certainly inflaming. If Con
gress actually addresses immigration reform
this year (a big if considering the deadlock on
health care), we will see this internal debate
played out, and it will not be pretty.
But students should not just think of
Washington when the issue of immigration

reform comes up. At Stanford, we are faced
with it everyday. Our undocumented student
peers (and there are undocumented Stan
ford undergraduates, brought to the U.S. as
children and now with no welcoming home)
cannot study abroad or apply for the same
summer internships. Without reform, they
will be helpless come graduation. Stanford
employees, from our janitors and cafeteria
workers to our staff members, make the issue
of immigration more immediate. And even
our international students, who are still not
admitted through a need-blind process, force
these issues upon us. Need-blind admissions
for all students is a tough issue to bring up
when the University is making budget cuts
across the board, but we should keep in mind
that Dartmouth, Harvard, MIT, Princeton,
Yale, Amherst, Middlebury and Williams in
stituted universal need-blind admissions be
fore the recession hit.
Immigration is an immediate and crucial
question. It is not just an issue for particular
communities: it challenges all of us to under
stand ourselves and our place in the world.
What does it mean to have a national identi
ty? What does it mean to be a world citizen?
How are we going to tackle world poverty,
and how will we treat the least amongst us?
Starting Monday, the Stanford Immigrant
Rights Project (SIRP) is putting on iWeek:
Immigration Week, with events related to im
migration each day. Go to one of them. Think
about this issue. It challenges me every day
and it will challenge you too. John Donne
once said, "No man is an island." Thinking
about immigration is a chance to consider
our individual and collective identities; these
are issues we should all come to terms with.
