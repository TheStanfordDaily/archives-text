## Discourse on Sex: Blowjob Scenario Part II 
### Yanran Lu 
Because it is such a "rare find," I am al
ways envious when I hear girlfriends
exclaim, "HOLLY SH*T! He gives
such AMAZING orals!" For the rest of us,
being good at oral sex, unlike physics or the
ater, does not guarantee a reward for either
talent or effort. And while most girls are en
couraged to "deep throat" a guy's penis, a lot
of guys are still stuck on the "omg, eww"-lick
"eww"-lick-"omg, is it my turn yet?"-repeat
phrase.
While you often hear guys ask, "can I cum
on your face?" You never hear the response,
"you are such a mind reader-that's exactly
what I wanted to ask you! Can I ejaculate on
your face first? ... .Wait, you never even
were able to bring me to the point of ejacula
tion. You were aware that girls can ejaculate,
right? Actually you always make me feel self
conscious by thinking that it is gross. I mean,
I totally get it, since it is neither sticky nor
staining. On that note, now that I think of it,
would you mind keeping your sperm in your
testicles too? Not trying to be insulting, but it
is kind of, eh ... slimy ... I mean unless you
are into fluids darting about, in which case
can I ejaculate onto your face?"
While so many guys want to try anal sex,
you don't really hear girls responding with
the same enthusiasm, "Wait you are into anal
sex? Me too! I was totally hoping you would
say that! I've got the lube and strap-on ready.
Do you want doggie-style or missionary? I
mean we can do wheel-barrel too, but your
legs are kind of heavy I don't know if I
could lift you ... Wait you want to penetrate
my behind? Sweety, that's so nice of you, try
ing to please me like that. But unlucky for me
I don't have a prostate. Plus in the heat of
the moment, you might just confuse the dif
ferent holes, and I'll end up with terrible in
fections I'm sure you would not want that
for me, right? Also, you know how we are so
proud of your 'junk-in-the-front?' And you
would never consider a reduction? So that

might give me terrible fissures that neither of
us want to deal with. On the other hand, we
can soooo change the size of the dildo, find
ing the 'perfect-size-for-you'! So no matter
which way we look at it, it is logical to con
clude that I shall have the pleasure of pene
trating you! Booyah!"
Humor aside, the question remains, how is
it that guys are made so comfortable with
sex, yet girls so aware of their bodily pres
ence? How is it that girls obsess over their
"fat" thighs and "smelly" vaginas, but guys
never obsess over their basic semen and con
sequently eat more pineapples? How is it
that guys view it as their god-given right to or
gasm while a lot of girls have yet to experi
ence the sensation?
So ladies, I dare you to get an orgasm

tonight and it is not over until you are fin
ished. If he does not know how, do yourself a
favor and teach him. And if you are finished?
Well, I guess good night to you then! Guys
never seem to feel bad that they left you
hanging after they are done, so why should
you? "Blue-ball" him! And to our female
protagonist from last week, I got something
to say to you too," Ruin the moment for him!
Since it is ruined for you already /"
Yes, we grew up in a puritanical sexist cul
ture. Yes. Sex is "dirty" and "secretive," and
only "those women" "lust" after sex and
pleasure. Yes. We are people-pleasers and
read the monthly "546 ways to please him" in
Cosmo. Yes. You probably have never asked
yourself what pleases you or asked "it" of
your partner. And in the age of "female sex
ual liberation," there are too many "Girls
Gone Wild" (that, in my opinion, is an ex
ploitation of the confusion between sexual
liberation and the ingrained social construct
of a woman to please), and too many girls up
holding the female social imprisonment by
calling other girls "sluts." Neither calls for a
true embracement of sexuality by women.
Make a change today, and ask yourself, do
you defend your orgasm like it is your right
or a too-rarely-bestowed gift? Do you know
what you want? Not just sex, but what exact
ly in and about sex that pleases youl Do you
know what sex does to you? Do you know
what your limits are? Do you respect your
self, particularly when your partner is making
you feel compromised? OR are you just too
"passive"? Forgive me for being stubborn,
but I still think that sex should make you feel
better and not worse. So "research" your
body, realize that sex is better than shopping
therapy. Be selfish, and give the gift of or
gasm to yourself today.
