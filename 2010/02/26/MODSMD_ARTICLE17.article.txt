### CHARLIE HOFFMAN, B.A.1973, MBA 1976 
Dear Editor,
I have been reading recent issues of The
Stanford Daily and am aware of changes in
the Student Fee program and the scrutiny of
student groups applying for funds in these
tough economic times. I feel that I can shed
additional light on the finances of The Daily.
I was the first President of The Stanford
Daily Publishing Corporation as its Editor in
Chief in 1973. A group of students had taken
The Daily independent then in response to a
raid by Palo Alto police in 1971 with a search
warrant looking for photo evidence of a stu
dent demonstration at Stanford. This was
the first search of a newspaper in the US
without a subpoena. We took the case to the
U.S. Supreme Court and lost 5-3 in 1977, and
this ruling added to a national call for pro
tecting newspapers which resulted in the Pri
vacy Protection Act. Several states passed
shield laws, adding levels of protection to
journalists nationwide. More stringent pro
tection legislation has been proposed in the
current Congress. From 1971 to 1977, stu
dents and Daily alumni raised $25,000 to
prosecute the case, Daily v. Zurcher (the
Palo Alto Police Chief). We became inde
pendent from the University at that time so
we were free to operate as an independent
news gathering organization.
Since 1973, The Daily has been governed
by a volunteer Board of Directors with a ma
jority being students with the help of four
outside directors, one each from business,
law journalism, and the Stanford faculty, to
provide continuity as the student members
turn over every year. None of these Board
members has ever been compensated for
their work on the Board or received any ex
pense reimbursement. I was Chairman of
this Board for almost 20 years. During that
time, the Daily's finances were alternately
weak and robust. Many years we applied for
and received fee assessments, some years we
did not apply. Also, from 1975 forward,
alumni gathered for the Big Game and a

banquet. Alumni from the 1930's to present
have gathered in numbers up to 150.
During the recession of 1990-91, it be
came clear that the Daily might not survive
unless we found away to fund it in hard
times. Accordingly, we formed the Friends
of the Stanford Daily as a cohesive group of
Daily alumni to support the paper. 1 have
served as President of the Friends since its
inception. We have had an all volunteer
Board with a majority being members of the
Daily Board and the majority of that Board
is students.
Over the years, in lean times, the Friends
have donated almost $3.6 million to the
Daily to support the paper in tough finan
cial times and to help replace the old Daily
building which was not earthquake safe.
The largest gift was donated by Stanford
benefactor and Daily alumnus Lorry Lokey.
Without this, The Daily probably would not
exist today in its current form. Also, we have
provided over $120,000 over 15 years in
summer intern scholarships to Daily staff, a
number of whom have gone on to careers in
professional journalism at leading publica
tions. In good years when The Daily had ex
cess funds, it placed those funds with The
Friends for a rainy day. Over the years, this
has totaled about $l.B million, roughly half
of what The Friends has returned to The
Daily.
Tliis year may be the worst financial year
for print journalism in the U.S. The Daily and
all print newspapers across the country are
facing dire times. Craig's List has largely re
placed classified advertising. National and
recruiter advertising are down sharply. The
Daily's own revenues are down by 50%. The
paper is adjusting to the new paradigm and
working on monetizing The Daily on the
web. This will take time and The Friends are
there to help make sure The Daily survives to
thrive in the new electronic environment.
To be able to help, The Friends have mobi
lized its alumni from the 1930's on. The
Friends have worked closely with the Uni

versity through the years on mailing lists and
is grateful for its support. Obviously, the Uni
versity was critical element in providing a
central campus site for the Daily, which is an
important component of student life. I be
lieve that The Friends are a model for student
organizations mobilizing their alumni to sup
port them. Every year, top writers and edi
tors from leading newspapers come to The
Daily to give talks and run workshops.
Tlie Daily delivers about 1.16 million is
sues per year to the campus and surrounding
areas for free. The Daily covers the vast ma
jority of its operating costs through advertis
ing revenues. In addition, The Daily collects
a modest subscription fee from students via
the ASSU fee request.
Stanford students have always voted pos
itively for The Daily's fee requests. The
Daily almost always is the first or second
leading vote recipient. I believe that The
Daily deserves this support. We appreciate
the support and The Daily students strive
(sometimes imperfectly) to provide a good
product that is informative, fair and reflec
tive of Stanford student life. For pennies a
day, it is a bargain.
I want to assure you that The Friends is an
open and transparent organization. We are a
group of interested alumni for whom work
ing at The Daily was a formative experience
when we were students like you. We exist to
make sure that The Daily survives the worst
of times and has the facilities needed to serve
the community. Our mission also includes
providing scholarships, career opportunities
and journalistic training for Stanford Daily
students, which we do on a volunteer basis
regularly.
In this recession, The Friends has and will
continue to help The Daily. After completing
the building project, a decade long project,
we need together with the student body to
support The Daily.
