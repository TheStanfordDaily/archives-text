## SOFTBALL Close battle in Cathedral City 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's two All-Americans hit all night,
but it was a walk that got the Cardinal Softball
team its fifth consecutive victory last night in its
first game of the Cathedral City Classic in Cathe
dral City, Calif.

Senior left fielder Alissa Haber's seventh-in
ning, bases-loaded walk gave the Cardinal (9-1) a
topsy-turvy 8-7 win over Tennessee (5-7).
Haber, along with sophomore second base
man and fellow All-American Ashley Hansen,
combined to go six-for-seven with three home
runs, six RBIs and five runs scored in the victory.
The pair got the game started quickly in the
top of the first as Haber bunted for a single, ad
vanced to second on a wild pitch and scored on
Hansen's double.
Haber believes that it is huge for the team
when she and Hansen get the Cardinal off to a
good start in the first inning.
"I think from the outset of that game, we kind
of set the tone there." Haber said. "When we can
score a quick run like that it really puts the mo
mentum in our favor. From there on in, it's a
team effort."
They picked up where they left off in Stan
ford's four-run third inning, blasting back-to
back home runs following sophomore center
fielder Sarah Hassman's leadoff walk.
Haber, a three-time All-American and Na
tional Player of the Year candidate, added her
second home run of the game and third of the
season an inning late to extend the Cardinal lead
to 5-1.
The game was far from over at that point,
however.
After scoring a run in the bottom of the fourth
to pull to within 6-2, the Lady Vols stormed back
to take a 7-6 lead with a five-run fifth.
The big blow of the inning was a two-run sin
gle off the bat of senior second baseman Nicole
Kajitani, the Lady Vols' ninth hitter in the batting
order, giving Tennessee the lead and chasing the
Stanford starter, freshman Teagan Gerhart, out
of the game.
Gerhart allowed 11 hits and seven runs while
striking out seven in her 4.1 innings pitched.
The Cardinal tied the game the following in
ning when, with two outs, Tennessee reliever Ivy
Renfroe walked Haber, and then intentionally
walked Hansen after Haber stole second, only to
get bitten by freshman shortstop Jenna Rich's

game-tying single. Rich had two hits on the day.
Despite losing the lead, Haber believed Stanford
could come back.

"Teagan struggled a bit, but even after she
gave up runs, I told her 'we are going to score
more runs,' and we did. That is what this team is
going to do all season score runs," Haber said.
Sophomore right fielder Maya Burns doubled
to lead off the Cardinal seventh. Stanford's sen
ior catcher Rosey Neill followed with a walk, and
four batters later, with the bases loaded, Haber
took four straight balls to give the Cardinal the
lead for good.

The Lady Vols went down in order in the bot
tom of the seventh, preserving the Stanford vic
tory.

Junior Ashley Chinn (5-1) got the win in re
lief. The right-hander went 2.2 innings and al
lowed just one walk while striking out two.
Haber enjoyed the challenge Tennessee gave
and hopes the Cardinal learns from it.
"I think that this was a really good test for us.
Even though they are unranked, they are scrap
py and are always a postseason team," Haber
said. "Both of us came out swinging. The question
was who was going to get that clutch hit. It speaks
volumes about our team that we were able to."

The loss was the Lady Vols' second of the day.
They dropped their first game 4-3 to the Pacific.
Despite the late night the game didn't end
until after 10:30 p.m. Stanford won't be able
to rest tomorrow as it plays a doubleheader. The
first game is at 3:30 p.m. against Northwestern,
followed by a 6 p.m. clash with Long Beach State.
The Cardinal will play three more games in the
Cathedral City Classic Texas A&M, Syracuse
and UNLV.
