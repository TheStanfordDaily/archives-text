## Banana Slugs Blocked 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's volleyball team showed its
depth Wednesday night, sweeping the UC-Santa
Cruz Banana Slugs in a dominant 30-19,30-27,30-
14 victory.

The Cardinal used its deep bench by starting
junior libera Jordan Inafuku, junior middle block
er Max Halvorson and redshirt sophomore mid
dle blocker Charley Henrikson for the first time
all season in the non-conference match. On the
statistical side, 10 different Cardinal players
recorded kills, but only one, sophomore outside
hitter Brad Lawson, was in double digits, with 11.
However, junior outside hitter lan Connolly
matched his collegiate career high with seven kills
and sophomore Dylan Kordic also recorded a ca
reer high with two kills.

"I think tonight's win was definitely a team
win," said freshman Jake Kneller. "We had a lot of
guys contribute who usually do not get much play
ing time, and it just keeps us motivated to keep

working hard in practice when we get the chance
to play in a game... [Head coach John] Kosty
told us to make sure to focus on serving, passing
and working hard in transition, which I think we
executed well."

Kneller made the most of his playing time,
serving 10 straight points from 14-8 to 24-8 in the
third set. This run included four aces and sealed
the win for the Card in the deciding set. Other
players had big nights in some of their first action
of the season. Inafuku had 13 digs, Henrikson hit
.500 with five kills and Halvorson also got in on
the action, contributing three blocks. As a team,
the Cardinal excelled from behind the service line
with 13 aces as compared to only nine service er
rors.

"I think we did a great job of serving tough and
keeping our serves in," Halvorson said. "Our side
out game has been pretty consistent. So when our
serving is on, we're able to go on multiple scoring
runs like we did to come back in the second game."
