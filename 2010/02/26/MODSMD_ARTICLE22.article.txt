# RAISING THE ROOF

### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This weekend will prove demanding for
the men's and women's track and field
team, as it heads off to Seattle, Wash, to
compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) Championships. This
weekend, the Stanford women will look to
defend their title from last year, while the
men will try to win their first title in school
history. Currently, the women are un
ranked in the country while the men sit at
No. 14.

Last indoor season, the women won
their fifth MPSF title in school history and
have their eyes set on number six. Last
year's title was the first for the Cardinal
since 2006, with four individuals securing
meet titles. Two of these athletes have re
turned this season —junior Arantxa King
in the long jump and senior Kate Niehaus
in the 5,000 meters.
"We are really excited for MPSF this
weekend," Niehaus said. "This is a great op
portunity to compete for team champi
onships on both sides. And at the same
time, we are looking forward to using this
competitive atmosphere to our advantage
to post some really great marks. We will
definitely be using this meet as a stepping
stone to NCAAs in two weeks."

The women go into the meet with six
NCAA provisional qualifiers and one au

tomatic qualifier, sophomore Katerina Ste
fanidi in the pole vault. Currently eighth in
the nation, Stefanidi is vying for the podi
um at the MPSF Championships. The pro
visional qualifiers include King in the long
jump, junior Whitney Liehr in the triple
jump, junior Stephanie Marcy, sophomore
Georgia Griffin and Niehaus all in the
5,000 meters and senior Griffin
Matthew in the 200 meters.
The toughest competition for the Cardi
nal women will be the No. 1 ranked team in
the country, Oregon, and No. 16 Arizona.
Oregon enters the meet with the top seeds
in eight events, as well as both relays.
On the men's side, Stanford faces a
stacked line up with No. 2 Oregon, No. 5
Arizona State, No. 18 Arizona and No. 24
California. The men do not have any re
turning individual title winners, yet have a
deep field with 12 provisional standards
and two automatic standards.
The distance runners lead the way for
the Cardinal, with several runners being
ranked in the top 20 in the nation. Senior
Justin Marpole-Bird and sophomore
Dylan Ferris sit at sixth and eighth nation
ally with automatic qualifying standards in
the mile, having run sub-four minute races
two weeks ago. These athletes also have
provisional times in other events the
3,000 meters for Marpole-Bird (No. 15)

While Stanford will look for victory, the focus is on the upcoming outdoor season.
and the 800 meters for Ferris (No. 11).
Stanford's remaining ranked ath
letes are junior Jake Riley (10th in the
5,000 meters), junior J.T. Sullivan
(19th in the mile) and freshman Jules
Sharpe (20th in the high jump). The
distance medley relay, consisting of
Sullivan, sophomore Amaechi Mor
ton, Ferris and Marpole-Bird is
ranked second in the nation, right be
hind Oregon.
Other men with provisional stan
dards include sophomore Miles Un
terreiner in the mile, junior Elliott
Heath in the 3,000 meters and sopho
more Geoffrey Tabor in the shot-put.
"We go into this weekend with our
sights set on team titles on both
sides," Heath said. "Competing well
at the MPSF meet is one of our major
goals for the indoor season."
Heath affirmed that the MPSF
title might not have the same level of
importance as a Pac-10 title.

"Although it maybe doesn't have
the prestige of the Pac-10 Champi
onships during the outdoor season, it
is still our indoor conference meet
and the culmination of the indoor
season for a lot of the team."
"Basically all of the Pac-10, as well
as a few other teams, will be lining
their best squads up to race this week

end, so coming home with a team vic
tory would mean a lot for our pro
gram," he added.
The MPSF Championships begin
today in Seattle, Wash, and will con
clude competition tomorrow.
