# NO REST FOR THE WEARY

### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a tough loss to California last
Saturday, the Stanford men's tennis
team could use an easy match against a
cupcake opponent to restore its confi
dence.
The No. 14 Cardinal (7-2) will have
no such opportunity this weekend. In
stead, it faces a daunting slate of match
es against some of the nation's best
teams.
The Cardinal squares off against
Pac-10 rivals No. 7 UCLA (5-2) on Fri
day and No. 5 USC (10-1) on Saturday.
Both teams made the Final Four of the
NCAA Team Championships last year,
and USC ended up winning the nation
al championship.
Fortunately for the Card, both
matches will be played in the friendly
home confines of theTaube Family Ten
nis Center.
"These two teams are as good as
anyone in the country," explained Stan
ford head coach John Whitlinger. "I

would expect typical L. A. style matches
that go right down to the wire."
This weekend's matches will not
count towards the Pac-10 standings.
The official conference matches will be
played in early April in Los Angeles.
Stanford split a pair of 4-3 decisions
with UCLA last year. The Bruins have
four singles players ranked in the ITA
top 100.
Both teams defeated No. 10 Ken
tucky at the Indoor National Champi
onships in Charlottesville, Virg. two
weeks ago.
Stanford also split its season series
with USC last year, but the Trojans
knocked out the Cardinal in the third
round of the NCAA Tournament dur
ing their championship run.
"USC, UCLA and Stanford tradi
tionally have the greatest rivalry in ten
nis," said senior Richard Wire. "As a
player and fan of Stanford tennis, these
are the matches that we circle on our
calendar every year."

With a tough loss to Cal behind it, Stanford will have to regroup
quickly to challenge No. 5 USC and No. 7 UCLA. While the matches
will not count toward the Card's conference record, they will still
provide a good barometer of Stanford's position in the Pac-10.
"If we can get a couple of wins this
weekend, we will move back into the
top 10 and gain a lot of confidence," he
continued.
Stanford is looking to rebound
from a devastating loss to Cal.
The Cardinal won the doubles
point and won the first set in five of the
six singles matches against the Golden
Bears. Cal clawed its way back from a

3-1 deficit to win the match 4-3, with
the help of a pair of third-set tiebreak
er victories.
"That was one of the hardest losses
I've had at Stanford," Whitlinger ad
mitted. "We had them and we let them
off the hook."
Junior Alex Clayton, who was bat
tling strep throat, lost 6-7,6-4,6-4. He
should be over his illness for this week
end's matches.
Freshman Matt Kandath, who also
lost a close match in three sets, is excit
ed for the weekend.
"The Cal loss was one of the program's
worst home losses ever," he said.

"We're ready to turn it into a motiva
tional tool and move on."
"We're all ready to get back on the
court," Whitlinger added. "This is a
great opportunity to see where we're
at."
The forecast calls for rain on Friday
and Saturday. Coaches are preparing
for delays and possible postpone
ments.
Stanford will look to get back on
track against UCLA at 1:30 p.m. on
Friday and USC on Saturday at 1 p.m.
