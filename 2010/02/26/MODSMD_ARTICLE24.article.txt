# Stanford's playoff season
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Stanford only needs three
more NCAA championships
to get to 100 and move closer
to UCLA's total of 104. Can
we make up some ground
this winter? It's postseason time in a lot
of sports, where the athletes' best per
formances are ready to shine through.
Basketball
The women's team seems to be on a
collision course with Connecticut for the
NCAA Championship. However, I
don't want to think that way because
there are talented teams out there, and
anything can happen.The No. 2 Card will
likely get a No. 1 seed and be on the op
posite side of the bracket from No. 1
UConn. But that doesn't mean those
other 62 teams will just let them reach the
finals. Let's just say that women's basket
ball has a great chance to win it all this
year if the team continues to play well.
On the men's side, it's all about seed
ing for the Pac-10 Tournament at this
point. The only way Stanford can even
get into the NCAA Tournament is to win
the Pac-10 Tournament which is actu
ally not impossible, especially if the team
continues to play well. To win the title?
Stranger things have happened before..
. I think.
Gymnastics
The men's gymnastics team looks
like Stanford's best bet to bring home a
second trophy to the Farm, which would
be the team's second straight national
championship. Stanford has shown that
it can compete above every other colle
giate team in the nation this year. A
home meet against Michigan tomorrow
will be a big test, as the Wolverines are
currently the No. 1 team in the nation.
The test after that will be going to
NCAAs at the Naval Academy in Mary
land. From the looks of it, the men should
be ready and prepared to capture anoth
er NCAA title.
On the women's side, it's all about
who does what when it counts. The
women have had scattered results this
year, losing to Oregon State, but then al
most beating No. 1 Georgia, losing by
just one-tenth of a point. This team has
shown it can compete, but the women
must put it all together when it counts at
Regjonals and at the Super Six. I would
not count this team out from sneaking in
there and pulling out the NCAA title, it
just has to recreate some of its great per
formances from this year on the final day.
Swimming
I would like to say that the Stanford
women are the No. 1 team in the country,
but even some of the ladies will tell you
that those rankings mean nothing when
it comes down to the NCAAs. The
women are currently competing at the
Pac-10 Championships and their finish
there will be a good barometer of where
they stand nationally. They finished their
dual season undefeated, but the NCAAs
are a whole different ball game. They do
have experience on their side, as they
have senior Olympians Elaine Breeden
and Julia Smit, as well as junior World
Championship participant Kate
Dwelley. Also huge for them is the per
formance of their diving squad, led by
senior Carmen Stellar. Like a lot of
sports on the Farm, they have the talent
and ability to win the NCAA title
they just need to bring their best over the
three days of the NCAA Champi
onships to do it.
On the men's side, the loss of stand
out Austin Staab is a blow to the team.
However, the team is still among the best
in the nation. The men need their relay
teams to come up big at NCAAs, be
cause they are talented at the individual
level and should score a lot of points
there. Like the women, the dual record
does not mean much going into Nation
als, as it's all about how your best stack up
against their best not necessarily how
deep your team is.The Stanford men can
win the trophy. But they will have some
stiff competition, so it won't be easy. If
they do win, it will be hard-fought, hard
earned and well deserved.
Indoor Track and Field
The first season for track and field is
the indoor season, and a solid group of
athletes has already qualified for the
NCAA Championships. While the
men's and women's teams may not have
the firepower that other teams have for
the team title, the Cardinal is strong indi
vidually. The men's distance medley
relay team has the second-best time in
