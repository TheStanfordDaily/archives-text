# Winter Wear to Spring Flair
## 
### â€“ mel BRIDGES contact mel: mbridges@stanford. edu 
With only a few weeks
left in the quarter and
finals approaching, life
seems pretty dreary to some. We
are all tired of lugging around
raincoats and umbrellas, even
though I personally will never get
tired of strutting in my fashion
able rain boots. While we will be
packing on study sessions, soon
we will not be packing on the lay
ers. Spring is almost here!
Oh, spring! The quarter
of lying out to tan on the grass,

II 12-unit course
I loads and, of
course, outfits
I with color. I
don't know
about you, but I
am so tired of
sticking to my
winter "browns,
grays and blacks."
Please, give me
some pinks, laven
ders and yellows!
However, they

sequestered in my closet until the
weather plateaus at 75 degrees ...
bummer.
Speaking of closets, we
all should prepare ourselves for
what I call the "changing of the
guard" that will happen sometime
between now and the first day of
spring quarter. Obviously, I take
this event very seriously. This
involves digging out garment
boxes from under my twin bed
and reviving my clothes that have
been hibernating since last sum
mer. Yet, not everything has to go.
Luckily for Stanford students who
are not provided with two closets
by Stanford housing, there are
winter pieces that can be convert
ed into spring pieces. What a
relief!
Let's start with winter's
favorite shoes boots. Your
leather boots can stay! Pair them
with a lightweight, flowy dress or
brightly colored short skirt. If you
are going out, they can dress up
an outfit and break you from the
'sandal rut' that we all fall into
come springtime. However, let me

make clear that Ugg boots do
NOT fall into this category. Please
do not put Uggs where they do
not belong. They belong with
long pants only, not skirts or

shorts. You do not want to look
like an awkward seventh grader
who still thinks that Limited Too
is an acceptable place to shop.
Let's move on to button

up shirts! I am so happy about
this one, because I am a new con
vert. These transfer to spring so
well. Keep them buttoned up or
leave them open with a compli
mentary colored camisole under
neath. Brighten up a more 'win
tery' button-up with a spring col
ored undershirt! Get creative!
Your button-ups can be paired
with your light-colored jeans and
shorts, and even skirts.
Another easy way to
make your short winter dresses
and skirts spring-like is to just
ditch the tights and boots, and
pair them with wedge heels or
sandal flats. This is also a great
time to put on those brightly col
ored scarves and jewelry. No one
will ever remember that you wore
that dress for half of fall quarter!
When I say that you
should stash your stockings, I do
not mean that you should stash
your leggings. On the contrary,
you should keep them nearby,
because they lend themselves to
easy outfits when you wake up
late for that oh-so-early spring

quarter 11 a.m. class. Pair with
your light-colored sandals and
flats, and your loose-fitting jersey
racer-back tops. This outfit may
be too simple for your taste, but
you can dress it up with dangly
earrings, bold bracelets and espe
cially long, chained necklaces.
One more reminder
come spring quarter, make sure to
put away your North Face!
