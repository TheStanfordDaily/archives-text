# Unrequited "Love"

I don't doubt Tom DeLonge
knows about love. Really, I
don't. The family man has
produced two successful albums
with Angels & Airwaves (AvA),
pouring his heart out on every
track. But maybe that's the prob
lem.
Taken alone, Love, AvA's
third album, is truly an epic dis
play of precision sound effects,
catchy drum beats and passionate,
often heart-wrenching lyrics. But
step out of Love and any AvA fan
will ask herself or himself:
Haven't I heard this all before?
The answer is yes to a
large extent. Two and a half min
utes of soul-stirring effects open
the album with "Et Ducit
Mundum Per Luce" Latin for
"lead the world by light"
whose absence of any vocals is a
welcome signal that perhaps Love
will lead us in a new musical
direction from the San Diego
group's We Don't Need to
Whisper (2006) and I-Empire
(2007). But for those looking for
that new musical direction, disap
pointment may quickly set in.
Take "Epic Holiday," for

instance, whose pounding drums,
floating synths and larger-than
life vocals are near-equivalent to
those of I-Empire's "Everything's
Magic." Or "Clever Love," whose
quiet intro that repeats and builds
for five minutes could hardly be
more similar to I-Empire's
"Breathe" without being the same
song. Or "Some Origins of Fire,"
which, when laid atop AvA's epic
"The Adventure," aligns itself
almost perfectly for the same
length of song. Not to mention
each track's over-extended intros
and endings, effects-adulterated
guitars and DeLonge's obviously
enhanced voice all factors that
play out in I-Empire and, to a
lesser extent, We Don't Need to
Whisper.
Now, to say that Love
may not impress the average AvA
fan is not to say that the Southern
Californians' latest album,
released Feb. 12 free of charge, is
anything less than excellent
music. In fact, if it were AvA's
first, only album, the group would
still garner millions of fans. The
ambitious DeLonge never fails to
shoot for the stars with his lyrics,

and those of Love are no excep
tion. "The moon you felt, it has
no side that's dark like hell or safe
from light, just blown apart by
wind from stars with white dust
tides" is the mantra of "The
Moon-Atomic," and DeLonge
tries hard to connect with a high
er being in "Letters to God, Part
II": "Dear God, I found out the
same things we learn when we
die. I found out the truth is it's all
a big lie."
Other tracks clearly
come from the heart of someone
who knows and appreciates love
for what it can offer. DeLonge, in
"The Flight of Apollo," appeals to
his lover, "Please don't look at me
so sadly, life shouldn't hurt so
badly," and he offers his own
heart "We all are loved and
love is hard, so here's my heart"
in Love's closing track, "Some
Origins of Love," which offers a
light, catchy opening and some
clean guitar riffs. And, taking a
welcome respite from heavy con
templation, DeLonge has a bit of
fun with "Young London": "Suit
up, boys, let's ride, it's the week
end / Get down, girls, and dance

with your best friend."
However you look at it,
Love is a clear indication that
Angels & Airwaves have firmly
established a sound that is unmis
takably their own. And although
Tom DeLonge has rejoined Blink
-182, he has vowed that AvA will
not stop making music anytime
soon. Let's just hope the ambi
tious frontman will dare explore
something new for AvA, even if it
means getting over a few musical
hurdles first. As he sings with
conviction in the band's second
album, "Everyone will listen, even
if it hurts sometimes."
