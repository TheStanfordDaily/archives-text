In an attempt to provide better
technology for student use, Residen

installed new projector screens in
some Old Union rooms and

initially purchased for residences,
have seen use over the previous
week, allowing groups to broadcast
images off laptop screens.
"[We were] looking for places to
put them where they would get the
best use," said Beth McCullough, a
learning spaces manager for Resi
dential Computing. "Old Union has
some really great study rooms that
are reservable ... so we thought it
would be a good fit."
Motion sensor lights were also in
stalled in several rooms in Old
Union, in line with the ASSU's em
phasis on sustainability. Gobaud also
showed interest in placing projectors
in some study rooms. These would
possibly be similar to those used in
classrooms, with smart panels.
Following the survey, Residential
Computing has also discussed pro
viding printers, an idea to which
