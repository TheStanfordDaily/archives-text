## Old Union upgraded ASSU provides technological improvements 
### RYAN MAYFIELD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an attempt to provide better
technology for student use, Residen
tial Computing and the ASSU have
installed new projector screens in
some Old Union rooms and
spokespeople said they may do more
in the near future.

"We definitely want to get more
technology in Old Union," said
ASSU President David Gobaud, a
coterminal student in computer sci
ence. "We've made a lot of progress."
The ASSU executive technology
team in January launched a student
survey on technology needs in Old
Union. Spread by e-mail and taken
by 157 students, the survey helped
clarify demand for specific equip
ment additions.

Recent additions include a pair of
large projection screens for student
use, connected to via laptop, that
have been added to study rooms 121
and 122 on the first floor of the
union. Both of these screens, provid
ed by Residential Computing and
initially purchased for residences,
have seen use over the previous
week, allowing groups to broadcast
images off laptop screens.
"[We were] looking for places to
put them where they would get the
best use," said Beth McCullough, a
learning spaces manager for Resi
dential Computing. "Old Union has
some really great study rooms that
are reservable ... so we thought it
would be a good fit."
Motion sensor lights were also in
stalled in several rooms in Old
Union, in line with the ASSU's em
phasis on sustainability. Gobaud also
showed interest in placing projectors
in some study rooms. These would
possibly be similar to those used in
classrooms, with smart panels.
Following the survey, Residential
Computing has also discussed pro
viding printers, an idea to which
about 75 percent of respondents
expressed interest. Residential
Computing does not usually serve
Old Union, focusing instead on
libraries, residences and Tresidder
Memorial Union. However, they can
provide some services upon request.
"Our printing service is used by
some other departments in spaces we
don't manage," said Rich Holeton,
director of academic computing serv
ices for Residential Computing.
Another interest expressed by
student responders was for a comput
er cluster. The addition of a cluster

would be the responsibility of an Old
Union Advisory Board, not the
ASSU or Residential Computing.
Some survey respondents also
hoped to have digital cameras and
video cameras available for rent,
according to Gobaud.
The discussion about adding tech
nology began when Old Union was
remodeled and reopened in 2007.
However, the University did not
install any projectors at the time,
"When they redid Old Union,
they didn't initially have [the] budget
for technology, so we started talking
about a possible partnership,"
Holeton said. "It took until now to
bring it to fruition."

The ASSU and Residential Computing are beginning to make strides in
improving technology for students in Old Union. After installing two projection
screens, plans are underway for further additions, including printers.
