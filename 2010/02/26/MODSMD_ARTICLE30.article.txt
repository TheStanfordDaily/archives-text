# Top Picks for Oscar Flicks
## 
### â€“ Cameron SOKOLIK contact cameron: iamcam@stanford. edu 
For whatever reason, perhaps because of the spirit of
the Oscar season, I always end up watching a ton of
movies around this time of the year. With the Oscars
just a little more than a week away (March 7), it's time for
me to catch up on all of the critically acclaimed movies I
failed to see in theaters. So, if you're anything like me, and
in need of a little movie break, I suggest you watch these
must-see Oscar-nominated flicks.

Believe it or not, I have encountered several peo
ple who have still yet to see this record-shattering film. For
example, my roommate refuses to see it simply based on
principle. Even if you hate to be part of the mainstream,
commercial world, this movie is undeniably incredible. I
went to see it with a lot of skepticism, thinking that it was
over-hyped, but left the theater amazed. I found the story

and idea behind the film itself
really interesting and entertain
ing. However, the plot is clearly
not the attraction. James
Cameron's vision of the world
located on planet Pandora is
remarkable. "Avatar" showcases
multiple revolutionary visual
effects, such as 3D technology,
which make the scenery and
characters vivid and realistic.
There was one particular part

where the main character looks over the edge of a very
high branch, down through the foliage of the jungle, and I
felt my body tensing up as if I were afraid to fall. It's no
surprise that the film is nominated for Best Picture.
A Serious Man
This Best Picture nominee, another Coen
Brothers masterpiece, depicts the life of an ordinary Jewish
man, Larry, as he experiences one problem after another.
As his world seems to be falling apart, Larry begins to
question God's intentions and inquires into what he has
done to deserve such an unpleasant life. Like many other
films by the Coen Brothers, this one is strong in its subtle,
dry wit. This sense of humor is a style that I really enjoy.
Everyday incidents that would not usually be funny are
conveyed in such away that makes them comical and
enjoyable. Every time I watch a Coen Brothers film and

this one is no exception I
laugh the entire time. However,
once it ends, I'm left ruminat
ing over the message. The
events in the plot are simple
and easy to follow, but the big
ger picture, or point, is a little
more obscure. I think this sys
tem really works; this movie is
both entertaining and mean
ingful, leaving me both amused
and confused, in a good way.

Fantastic Mr. Fox
Based on the children's novel by Roald Dahl
(author of classics like "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"
and "Matilda"), this movie is nominated for Best Animated
Feature Film. Directed by Wes Anderson and voiced by an
amazing cast, including George Clooney, Bill Murray,
Meryl Streep and Jason Schwartzman, this film was des
tined to be great. The plot revolves around the blundering
main character, Mr. Fox, and the community of animals
that live nearby. Wes Anderson has a truly distinct style,
with explicitly expressed emotions, a likeable antihero and
shrewd humor. The movie is really funny and had me
laughing out loud several times. Jason Schwartzman's char
acter, Ash, steals the show. Rejecting the computer-anima
tion that reigns supreme today, this film refreshingly
employs stop-motion animation to bring the animal char-

acters to life. This effect is very
creative and truly innovative,
making the movie appear as both
a story and a work of art. Pixar
has dominated this Oscar catego
ry in the past, but it better watch
out because this film is truly a
contender.
