Hollywood finally did it.
After churning out terri
ble remakes of seemingly
every noteworthy horror movie
from the 70s and 80s, Breck
Eisner's "The Crazies" is a worthy
update of George Romero's 1973
film. The pace, budget and gore
have been amplified, and the anti
government message rampant in
the original is, while toned down,
still present. Better yet, the film
seems fully conscious that it's not
from the Vietnam generation, but
rather one colored by news footage
from Afghanistan and Iraq. People
are displaced, homes are destroyed
and the military sent to save the
town of Ogden Marsh is silent and
savage. Plot-wise, "The Crazies"
has its missteps to be sure, but one
can forgive most of the B-movie
cliches because there is still enough
to chew on.
The setting is established
with a montage of the typical
goings-on in a small, lowa farming
town set to Johnny Cash's cover of
"We Will Meet Again" (probably a
deliberate riff on the ending of
"Dr. Strangelove"). We are quickly
introduced to the four main char

acters, who rarely diverge from the
standard stock qualities: the gruff
hero Sheriff David Dutton
(Timothy Oliphant), his pregnant,
doctor wife, Judy, his buddy and
deputy, Russell, and Becca, Judy's
teenage assistant who somehow
becomes a main character. Some
townspeople start to become eerily
vacant, and a few break out into
psychopathic violence.
Dutton and co. basically
figure out what's going on, but
their intuitions are predictably
unheeded. Then the dam breaks:
the virus responsible spreads rap
idly, and the government begins its
"containment protocol." The mili
tary appears, adorned in gas masks
and body armor, attempting to
quarantine all who are possibly
infected and evacuating the others.
This leaves our main four trying to
escape from the town filled with
super-violent friends and overrun
with soldiers who will shoot any
thing that moves.
Although many people
involved in production clearly
wanted this to be a zombie movie,
these creatures aren't exactly the
same. Here the infected retain their

sense of identity and sometimes
the ability to speak, and they do
not want to eat the living. They
just want to kill everything. Not
only does this lead to some great
exploitative images, but it also
adds another aspect to the para
noia. We can't just have the stan
dard, badass trigger-happy zombie

slaughterers, since any zeal shown
in killing anyone could be a sign of
infection or, more interestingly,
actual craziness.
The military's actions
present another layer to the insani
ty of the crisis. Convinced that the
safest course of action would be to
complete their containment proce
dure without explaining anything
to the civilians, the men with guns
separating families for no dis
cernible reason understandably
sets off some resistance from the
residents of Ogden Marsh. After
their first attempt at handling
those who could be infected com
pletely breaks down, they adopt a
less nuanced "kill and burn" strate
gy. In many ways, this is the mirror
image of the devastation caused
when the United States has tried to
protect foreign countries and itself
against fanaticism, utterly destroy
ing the homes of many ideologi
cally uninvolved families. Romero's
film may be angrier at the numb
bureaucracy that can perpetrate
such horror, but Eisner's is more
sympathetic to the plight of those
caught in the crossfire.
The biggest problem with

"The Crazies" is that there is so
much potential symbolism and
allegory that Eisner can't quite
handle it all satisfyingly. Some
themes are brought up only
briefly, left behind as we plod
through a number of admittedly
interesting set pieces that are ulti
mately just spectacle. It clearly isn't
a passion project with a definite
message, but rather a studio movie
that was handled as well as could
be expected. It's a thinking man's
schlock picture that may not quite
hit the mark, but it aims for some
thing deep. And in some scenes, it
does in fact prick the nerve.
