Martin Scorsese's latest
film, "Shutter Island,"
opens with federal mah
shals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo
DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark
Ruffalo) ferrying their way across a
dark and stormy sea to an island
mental hospital for the criminally
insane. It seems that all that Leo's
brought with him are cigarettes and
a certain kind of accent, but that
turns out to suit us just fine for the
rest of the movie. If the above
details aren't enough to set the
mood, our beloved Leo is anxious,
ill and sick with anxiety right from
the beginning, first suffering from
seasickness as he stares into his pre
maturely strained eyes at the mirror
in the ship's dark, apparently desert
ed hold.
Leo seems completely alone,
except, of course, for his stoic
buddy Chuck, but despite the bond
they share over their accents, it is
clear that Teddy is indeed "boss," as
Chuck refers to him. Much of the
delight of the movie is in watching
DiCaprio muscle his way through
the unyielding terrain of the
movie's mysteries while retaining an
affecting vulnerability. Though
some of the numerous dream
sequences stray into excessive
creepiness, including gratuitous
Nazi death-camp flashbacks from
Teddy's service in WWII, they will
complicate Leo's character with a
little pathos if you let them.
The mystery he confronts is
appropriately intractable, complete
with a cryptic clue written by a
mental patient, repeated warnings
to run-while-he-can-blah-blah,
dingy Kafka-esque hallways with
flickering lights, the requisite
unhelpful bureaucratic figures,
including a quasi-Nazi, quasi-
Freudian psychiatrist who, in one of
the best examples of Leo's lovably
futile bravado in the movie, is called
out by Leo as a German expatriate
on the basis of his lingering
German consonants (Leo then
smashes a glass with relish) and,
finally, rumors that the facility is
secretly conducting horrifying med
ical experiments (more Nazi para
noia) for the purposes of develop
ing a super-human soldier for the
new fight against the Soviets.
In the final analysis, Scorsese
does a very pleasing job at creating
simple, if at times overbearing, ten
sion. It seems the entire island is
swelling and screaming with omi
nous energy; a possessed tree
branch, launched loose by the hur
ricane of ambiguous danger,
assaults our two heroes before they
find shelter in an equally hostile
mausoleum. However, you may not
be as happy with this as I was if you
have a problem with the simplicity
of the concept, or the somewhat
heavy-handed generation of dread.
It is easy to dismiss Scorsese's tech
nique as overblown Hollywood
histrionics, and the whole ordeal
begins to seem more and more like
the deluded creation of a madman
as it wears on. To make things
worse, the many strands of mystery
that Scorsese weaves early on (for
example, the vague suggestion of
Nazism in the homeland) lose vigor
and weight by the time the real
kicker comes into view.
Ultimately, the movie does
aspire to loftier goals than a simple
horror-thriller about criminal men
tal patients and their equally threat
ening institution; notably, and not
at all disappointingly, much of the
violence and gruesomeness suggest
ed is never actualized. "Shutter
Island" ultimately concerns itself
with the staggering and paralyzing

possibilities of self-delusion, more
specifically that of DiCaprio's char
acter. While many will be under
whelmed by the eventual treatment
of this theme, and wonder whether
all the director's sturm und drang
was really necessary, it is undeniably
fun to watch the products of this
psychotic mind. Perhaps the case of
madness can excuse Scorsese's
somewhat excessive enthusiasm
towards his concept.
One of the last lines of the film
wonders whether it is better to die a
good man or to live as a monster.
Though undeniably trite, we might
think about the filmmaker's strug

gle between intelligence and muscle
with this question in mind, and
pardon Mr. Scorsese if the madness
of artistic fabrication has carried
him away at all. To judge delusion
as pathological is reductive, espe
r daily when we might as well just
play along.
