The scariest part of this
thriller is that I wasn't able to
warn you not to see it soon
er, for it will definitely disappoint. It
had all the possibilities of a wonder
ful film: Martin Scorsese directing a
psychological thriller, Leonardo
DiCaprio as a tortured detective, a
marvelous supporting cast and hype
lasting since 2008. However, despite
all of these elements, something
failed to connect.
As detective Ted Daniels,
DiCaprio signs on to investigate the
escape of a criminally insane and
dangerous prisoner from the mental
institution on Shutter Island in the
early'sos. He and his partner Chuck
Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo) seem
to get the sense that something on
Shutter Island is not quite as it
seems. Cue the eerie music.
DiCaprio must navigate the stories

of the many patients and the creepy
medical heads of the institution.
Through a series of twists, flash
backs, dreams and hallucinations
(or are they?) we discover that
DiCaprio's character has a dark
past, including the death of his wife
and the termination of defenseless
Nazis at a concentration camp.
The film begins ominously as
the detectives arrive on Shutter
Island. The audience is then given a
verbal map of the scary places to
visit: the graveyard, Ward C where
the most dangerous prisoners
patients are kept, the caves in the
rocky cliffs and most creepily, the
out-of-use lighthouse. While the
foreshadowing is as blatant as the
episode of "Scooby-Doo" where the
fisherman was the killer, Scorsese
maintains a level of tension not
reached by most thrillers.

The tension begins to dissipate
in the second act as we then follow
DiCaprio to each of these places. At
each new location, the various char
acters of the island lay twists in
front of him and the audience. The
third act ends with a twist that is
not altogether predictable. However,
its ineffective presentation doesn't
allow for the same bang that it
could have had.
Maybe I'm being a little harsh
there were many things about
this movie that did work. If you are
a Leonardo Dicaprio fan, then this
is some of his finest work. He is the
perfect actor for the role, as he plays
the deterioration of the psyche that
afflicts his character so well. He also
maintains that loveably thick
Boston accent that he uses unfor
gettably in "The Departed," or
should I say "The De-pah-ted."

All of Shutter Island is wonder
fully shot and interestingly com
posed. For a thriller, it exceeds
many of the expectations that one
would normally have for a
"Nightmare on Elm Street"-like
movie. It was also intended to be in
the form of B-movie, with overly
scary sets, absurdly creepy music
and off the charts levels of tension.
Scorsese does accomplish this, yet if
you don't know you are supposed to
be seeing a B-movie parody, it just
becomes a B-movie.
If you were a fan of Dennis
Lehane's 2003 best-selling novel of
the same title, you won't be let
down. I have heard it follows the
plot very strictly and only takes
artistic differences that are a great
improvement on the book. Also
worth noting is the fact that this is
director Martin Scorsese's first
return to the thriller genre since
"Cape Fear" in 1991. The level of
tension Scorsese manages to create
is just as potent, but with a far less
riveting pay-off.
The supporting cast of Shutter
Island is also delightful. Ben
Kingsley as Dr. Cawley, the medical
head of the institution, takes a big
leap from the loveable Gandhi, and
becomes borderline menacing.
Mark Ruffalo, or the boyfriend of
Kirsten Dunst in "Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind," challenges
DiCaprio for thickest Boston accent
and just might even win.
After two and a half hours, you
feel like you know these characters,
but you're mad at the movie for
having wasted most of that time. If
you've been sucked in by the three
year hype this movie has built up,
then fine, see it. But if you're look
ing for any sort of horror, or drama,
or really just quality film-making,
maybe take a look at "Valentine's
Day" (WARNING: This is sarcasm.
Don't see that either).
