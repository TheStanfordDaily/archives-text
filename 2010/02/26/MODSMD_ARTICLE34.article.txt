# Olympics: Art or Art of Suspense?
## 
### â€“ liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
I admittedly have not been able
to follow the 2010 Winter
Olympics as closely as I would
like (all I want for Christmas is
basic cable in my dorm room).
What I have been able to glean
from the very handy Olympics
section of nytimes.com, however,
suggests that these Games have
brought new meaning to the
adage that seems particularly
appropriate for the Olympics:
"Expect the unexpected." We
Americans have been eating it up
for the last two weeks, with
Tuesday's New York Times report
ing that the Vancouver Olympics
are projected to be the most
watched Winter Olympics since
1994.

What do I mean, precise
ly? Well, think about how these

Games started: someone died on
the luge course and a part of the
Opening Ceremony technology
malfunctioned. This year, our

obsession with failure and sorrow
has fueled our interest just as
much as our tendency toward
fleeting patriotism and athlete
favoritism. The underdog narra
tive produced exuberant reactions
to Team USA's victory over
Canada in hockey, but the
Olympic trope of the non-favorite
pulling out a win has not been
unfailingly potent. Take, for
example, Evan Lysacek's victory
over the heavily favored Russian
Evgeni Plushenko in men's figure
skating. This moment of triumph
for the U.S. of A in the literal
Cold War (ice skating ... get it?)
was overshadowed by Johnny
Weir's sexy faces and expressive
hands. I don't normally follow
men's figure skating, so I was sur
prised to learn from the final
results that J. Weir wasn't actually
a favorite or even a contender.
Since when does the guy who gets
sixth get more attention than the
winner? In the age of Perez
Hilton, I suppose.
Another battle of back
story versus artistry raged in the
women's figure skating competi
tion, where Canadian Joannie
Rochette skated a third-place
short program just two days after
her mother's sudden death. Linda
Holmes of the NPR Culture blog
discussed how NBC's coverage of
her performance straddles the line
between empathy and voyeurism,

and correctly condemns the net
work for its morally iffy choice to
manipulate Rochette and the
audience in that way. My question
is: if every athlete's performance is
framed by a narrative of violins
for sadness and horns for tri-

umph over adversity, then can we
ever appreciate the performance
purely for its artistry? Or, are we
always waiting to see if the
Joannie Rochettes of the world
can conquer grief and a double
axel, or buckle under the pressure
of history and the media's
exploitation of it?
The Winter Olympics,
more than the Summer Games,
are somewhat compromised by
media packaging. While the
Summer Olympics, in my opin
ion, showcase brute strength and
athletic prowess significantly
more than artistry, the ratio is
more balanced in the winter.
Figure skating, ice dancing, snow
boarding and freestyle skiing are
about the formation of a routine
and a narrative therein (summer
equivalents that come to mind are
gymnastics and diving). The
undeniable artistry of these ath
letic forms attracts an audience,

but what rivets them is the possi
bility of failure.
When watching Kim Yu-
Na, the international virtuoso of
figure skating from Korea, I real
ized that every figure skating per
formance has the same pattern
opening section with the jumps,
the middle section with the spins
and the glides, the penultimate
section with the weird perky
dancing and the final pose.
Though the beauty of her lines
pulls at my heartstrings, I'm par
ticularly invested not because I've
never seen someone extend her
leg up to her face while spinning
on the ice, but because I want to
know if she'll succeed on the dou
ble toe loop I know she's going to
attempt.
NBC capitalizes on this
by making us care about the per
son, not the artist. This model
transforms the art of the event
into the art of suspense and mini
mizes the difference between the
creative events and purely athletic
ones. The skiing narrative of these
Games, for example, has been sig
nificantly occupied with the
instances in which Lindsey Vonn
or Bode Miller crash off the

course. It is, to a significant
degree, the "car crash you can't
look away from" effect, but I do
think that this is the modus
operandi for the Winter Games:
danger.
Maybe my memory of
Torino is particularly weak (it was
Torino, after all), but the unend
ing stream of updates about
finagling with the luge course,
rescheduling ski races and pursu
ing tragedy on the ice brings an
interesting dimension to winter in

Vancouver. Who would have
thought that I would miss
Beijing?
