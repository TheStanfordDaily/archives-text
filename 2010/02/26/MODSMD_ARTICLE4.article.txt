# SUN DEVILS SCORCHED
## 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Cardinal women may have bid
farewell to the friendly confines of Maples
Pavilion last weekend when they played their
final homes games of the season, but they
seemed to have taken a bit of "Maples Magic"
along for the ride as they began their final two
game weekend with a dominant 62-43 victory
over Arizona State last night. Senior center
Jayne Appel led both teams with 19 points and
added eight rebounds as Stanford (26-1,16-0
Pac-10) downed the Sun Devils (16-10, 8-7).
Junior forward Kayla Pedersen added 12
points of her own in the Cardinal win, which
clinched Stanford's sixth consecutive outright

Pac-10 title.
Stanford established control of the game
early, jumping out to a 10-0 lead in just four
minutes. The outburst was capped by a three
pointer from junior guard Jeanette Pohlen,
who scored 11 points on the game. The double
digit performance is the latest in a recent string
of solid offense for Pohlen, who scored a ca
reer-high 26 points on 10-for-13 shooting last
Saturday against the Beavers.
Just as notable as the Cardinal's early scor
ing on Thursday were its stifling defense and
the Sun Devils' inability to capitalize on offen
sive opportunities. During Stanford's 10-0 run,
Arizona State fired and missed six separate
shots including a pair of free throws
gave up two turnovers and burned a time out

after Pohlen's emphatic three-pointer. Things
were bad enough, in fact, that after barely two
and a half minutes, Arizona State head coach
Charli Turner Thorne subbed out her entire
team.
Her counterpart on the Stanford side,Tara
VanDerveer, was pleased with her team's de
fensive effort.
"I thought we played really well defensive
ly," VanDerveer said. "Jeanette [Pohlen]
stepped up when we really needed her defen
sively. Our defense was the story of the game."
While the Sun Devils would bounce back to
a degree they outscored Stanford 20-19 for
the remainder of the period their shooting
accuracy would continue to lag below average.
Arizona State posted a first-half mark of 25.9

percent from the field compared to Stanford's
50 percent, and finished the game shooting 16
of 52 (30.8 percent, compared to Stanford's
game-total of 50 percent). Senior guard
Danielle Orsillo led the Sun Devils with 12
points on four-for-12 shooting.
Appel, the reigning Pac-10 Player of the
Year, gave credit for Arizona State's effort.
"I think that is kind of what is to be expect
ed," she said. "Everyone's going to bring their
A-game against us. at this point if a team is
going to try to get a win against anybody it is
going to be against us, especially. It's a game we
need to expect every time we come out onto
the floor."

NOTES ! Stanford secured its sixth consecu
tive conference title last night with a 62-43
win over Arizona State. Senior center Jayne
Appel led the Cardinal offense once again
with 19 points. The Sun Devils were led by
Danielle Orsillo with 12 points. Stanford
has two games remaining in conference
competition, both on the road, against Ari
zona and Cal. Its next games on The Farm
will be in the first round of the NCAA Tour
nament on March 20.



Arizona State remained competi
tive to open the second half, bringing
the score to 40-32 just under six min
utes in, but began to fade late. Stan
ford put together a 17-7 run to close
the game, earning its 17th consecutive
win and continuing an undefeated
conference season in which it has
failed to win by 15 or more points
only once.
Despite the solid victory, the final
statistics reveal some clear areas
where the championship-hopeful
Cardinal could improve. Stanford out
rebounded ASU just 37-34, gave up 21
turnovers compared to the Sun Dev
ils' 20, matched them in personal fouls
with 14 and shot five-for-11 from the
free throw line.The Cardinal did, how
ever, manage to force a total of 12
steals, including four from Appel.
"There was a lot of turning it over

and we gave them a lot of O-boards .
.. the turnovers, you're not going any
where turning the ball over like that,"
VanDerveer said. "We just didn't get
the type of offensive game that we're
used to from Nneka [Ogwumike] or
Kayla [Pedersen], they had foul trou
ble early."
Pedersen agreed with her coach
that if the team is serious about post
season contention, some improve
ments need to be made.
"I think we're just mainly upset
with our lack of aggression," she said.
"The whole week in practice we've
been playing against pressure. Our
practice players and our other team
mates do extremely well, so it was dis
appointing for us to go out there and
show that."
Fortunately for the Cardinal, its
next contest and the chance for a
tune-up is coming up tomorrow,
when Stanford will face Arizona (IS
IS, 6-9). The Wildcats had a strong
start this year, winning both of their
exhibition games and starting the sea
son 5-1, but haven't managed more

than two consecutive wins since early
December.
The last time Arizona met with
Stanford, however, the Wildcats came
out strong and posed a considerable
challenge early on. They gave Stan
ford its second halftime deficit of the
season at 42-40, but the Cardinal was
able to rebound in a big way, starting
off the second half with a 10-0 run and
earning an 83-62 victory.
Arizona lost to Cal last night by a
score of 58-52, meaning that the sev
enth-place Wildcats are mathemati
cally unable to have a winning confer
ence record this season. Following
that game, the Wildcats' offensive
leaders are Davellyn Whyte (16.3
points per game, 3.9 rebounds per
game) and Ify Ibekwe (14.0 ppg, 11.6
rpg)-
The Cardinal will face off against
Arizona at 2 p.m. tomorrow in Tuc
son, Ariz., then close out the season
next weekend against rival Cal.
