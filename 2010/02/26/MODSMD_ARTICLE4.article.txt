# SUN DEVILS SCORCHED
## 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Cardinal women may have bid
farewell to the friendly confines of Maples
Pavilion last weekend when they played their
final homes games of the season, but they
seemed to have taken a bit of "Maples Magic"
along for the ride as they began their final two
game weekend with a dominant 62-43 victory
over Arizona State last night. Senior center
Jayne Appel led both teams with 19 points and
added eight rebounds as Stanford (26-1,16-0
Pac-10) downed the Sun Devils (16-10, 8-7).
Junior forward Kayla Pedersen added 12
points of her own in the Cardinal win, which
clinched Stanford's sixth consecutive outright

Pac-10 title.
Stanford established control of the game
early, jumping out to a 10-0 lead in just four
minutes. The outburst was capped by a three
pointer from junior guard Jeanette Pohlen,
who scored 11 points on the game. The double
digit performance is the latest in a recent string
of solid offense for Pohlen, who scored a ca
reer-high 26 points on 10-for-13 shooting last
Saturday against the Beavers.
Just as notable as the Cardinal's early scor
ing on Thursday were its stifling defense and
the Sun Devils' inability to capitalize on offen
sive opportunities. During Stanford's 10-0 run,
Arizona State fired and missed six separate
shots including a pair of free throws
gave up two turnovers and burned a time out

after Pohlen's emphatic three-pointer. Things
were bad enough, in fact, that after barely two
and a half minutes, Arizona State head coach
Charli Turner Thorne subbed out her entire
team.
Her counterpart on the Stanford side,Tara
VanDerveer, was pleased with her team's de
fensive effort.
"I thought we played really well defensive
ly," VanDerveer said. "Jeanette [Pohlen]
stepped up when we really needed her defen
sively. Our defense was the story of the game."
While the Sun Devils would bounce back to
a degree they outscored Stanford 20-19 for
the remainder of the period their shooting
accuracy would continue to lag below average.
Arizona State posted a first-half mark of 25.9

percent from the field compared to Stanford's
50 percent, and finished the game shooting 16
of 52 (30.8 percent, compared to Stanford's
game-total of 50 percent). Senior guard
Danielle Orsillo led the Sun Devils with 12
points on four-for-12 shooting.
Appel, the reigning Pac-10 Player of the
Year, gave credit for Arizona State's effort.
"I think that is kind of what is to be expect
ed," she said. "Everyone's going to bring their
A-game against us. at this point if a team is
going to try to get a win against anybody it is
going to be against us, especially. It's a game we
need to expect every time we come out onto
the floor."
