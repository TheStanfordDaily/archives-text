# ZONED OUT
## Stanford falls to ASU despite early lead 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Luck has not been particularly kind to
Stanford this season. Thursday was no differ
ent misfortune reared its ugly head late,
as an own-basket by Landry Fields sealed an
Arizona State victory at Maples Pavilion.
Despite trailing for most of the game, the
Sun Devils emerged victorious, 68-60.
Stanford (12-15, 7-9 Pac-10), fresh off a
sweep of the Oregon schools, started the
night, barely alive for the Pac-10 crown,
while Arizona State (20-8,10-5), which had
won five of its previous six, entered as one of
two Pac-10 teams with even a shot at an at
large NCAA Tournament bid. For both, the
margin of error was exactly zero.
Flappenstance, then, was not welcome.
The sting of Fields's fluke play was thus all
the more damaging trailing by four with
50 seconds left, Fields appeared to corral an
Arizona State miss over center Eric
Boateng, but in trying to secure the ball, he
knocked it back up and in, pushing the
deficit to six. A quick Jeremy Green miss at
the other end cemented Stanford's fate

the Sun Devils made all eight of their foul
shots in the final minute.

"Can't do anything about that," said
Stanford head coach Johnny Dawkins. "The
game can be cruel. He made the right play to
go for the ball over a 6TI" guy."
But it was not simply a shortage of luck

NOTES : The men's basketball team slipped to 7-
9in the Pac-10 last night as it fell at home to
Arizona State, 68-60. Senior forward Landry
Fields led Stanford in scoring with 19 points.
Sophomore guard Jeremy Green, the Cardi
nal's second offensive stalwart, was uncharac
teristically ineffective, going 2-14 from the floor
(including 2-10 from behind the arc) for only 6
points. Stanford's next game is against Arizona,
which lost to Cal last night by a score of 95-71.

that hurt the Cardinal. Boateng, a
transfer who played at Duke when
Dawkins was an assistant there, was a
perfect 11-11 from the field and led all
scorers with 24 points. He helped the
Sun Devils to a 30-18 advantage in the
paint all of his shots, it seemed,
came from within only a couple of
feet from the basket. Even when
Stanford ganged up on him, he was
able to find his teammates for open
looks.
"Eric Boateng had a terrific game,
one of the best I've ever seen him play
in the low post," Dawkins said.
For Arizona State, it was a neces
sary lift, as their three main scorers
Derek Glasser, Rihards Kuksiks and
Ty Abbott combined to shoot just
8-27 from the field. Glasser did finish
with 20 points, as he made six free
throws in the final 33 seconds to en
sure no last-second heroics would
occur for the Cardinal, but was other
wise fairly quiet.
"Can't say enough about the per
formance of Eric Boateng. 11-11, so
many hustle plays, big rebounds
he wouldn't let us lose today," said
Sun Devils head coach Herb Sendek.
"He really put the team on his back
and carried us through."
That said, the game was a marked
change from the Cardinal's trip down
to Tempe in January, when Arizona
State won by 18 and led 54-22 after
the first 20 minutes. This time around,
Stanford came out gunning and es
tablished a 35-28 halftime lead on 52
percent shooting.
The Cardinal found contributions

from a variety of players in the first
half. Senior guard Drew Shiller was
particularly locked in, as he hit a trio
of early three-pointers to give Stan
ford an initial advantage. He led all
scorers with 13 points at the break.
Senior guard Emmanuel Igbinosa
had a solid game off the bench, net
ting five points and hustling down a
number of loose balls. Fields added
nine in the early going, and Green had
six, including a bucket from behind
the arc with five seconds to play to
give the Cardinal its seven-point ad
vantage. That shot also gave Green
the school's single-season three
pointers made record (85), as he sur
passed Casey Jacobsen in the history
books.
"Stanford came out and hit us be
tween the eyes and had us on our
heels. Our team didn't come out with
the requisite passion that we need to
play with," Sendek said.
That fire did not hold. Green, who
shot just 2-14 and had a number of
threes rim out, would be held score
less in the second half, and Shiller
would tack on just three more points
to his total. Fields was one of the lone
sources of offense in the second half.
He would add 10 more points to fin
ish with a Stanford-high 19 on 75 per
cent shooting and in the process,
he became just the fifth Cardinal
player to drop more than 600 points
in a career. He currently stands at 618
points.
But even with production from
Fields and sophomore forward Jack
Trotter seven of his nine points
came in the second half the Cardi
nal as a team nailed just 10-28 takes
from the field and was a woeful 2-15
from behind the arc in the final 20
minutes. Arizona State, meanwhile,
was a model of consistency, shooting

12-27 in both halves.
"They defended well, but we had
some good looks," Dawkins said.
"Sometimes the ball just doesn't go
in."
The disparity in play prompted a
quick turnaround; Arizona State re
took the lead with 12:32 to play, and
pushed it to 10 by the 6:33 mark. Stan
ford was able to cut the margin down
to four with plenty of time remaining
2:34, to be exact but neither
team scored for nearly two minutes.
For the Cardinal, the opportunities to
tie the game presented themselves,
but missed free throws and three
pointers abounded before Fields'
fateful tip-in.
Stanford maintained its position in
the conference seventh despite
the loss, but to ensure that it escapes
the Pac-10 Tournament's play-in
game, the Cardinal will likely have to
take at least one of its remaining two
games. A share of the regular season
title is out of the question it was
even before the game went final, as
Cal beat up on Arizona to eliminate
Stanford from contention. The Wild
cats (13-14,7-8), currently sixth, come
to Maples on Saturday.
They are now the only priority for
Dawkins and his team, who will have
to rebound quickly from a painful
loss.
"We're not looking at seeding,
only Arizona for us," Dawkins said.
"If we play well, the rest of the stuff
will take care of itself."
"We can still play for something,"
he added.
The Cardinal will take on Arizona
at Maples Pavilion on Saturday at 4
p.m.

Arizona State victory at Maples Pavilion.
Despite trailing for most of the game, the

"Can't do anything about that," said
Stanford head coach Johnny Dawkins. "The

NOTES : The men's basketball team slipped to 7-
9in the Pac-10 last night as it fell at home to
Arizona State, 68-60. Senior forward Landry
Fields led Stanford in scoring with 19 points.
Sophomore guard Jeremy Green, the Cardi
nal's second offensive stalwart, was uncharac
teristically ineffective, going 2-14 from the floor
(including 2-10 from behind the arc) for only 6
points. Stanford's next game is against Arizona,
which lost to Cal last night by a score of 95-71.

that hurt the Cardinal. Boateng, a
transfer who played at Duke when
Dawkins was an assistant there, was a
perfect 11-11 from the field and led all
scorers with 24 points. He helped the
Sun Devils to a 30-18 advantage in the
paint all of his shots, it seemed,
came from within only a couple of
feet from the basket. Even when
Stanford ganged up on him, he was
able to find his teammates for open
looks.
"Eric Boateng had a terrific game,
one of the best I've ever seen him play
in the low post," Dawkins said.
For Arizona State, it was a neces
sary lift, as their three main scorers
Derek Glasser, Rihards Kuksiks and
Ty Abbott combined to shoot just
8-27 from the field. Glasser did finish
with 20 points, as he made six free
throws in the final 33 seconds to en
sure no last-second heroics would
occur for the Cardinal, but was other
wise fairly quiet.
"Can't say enough about the per
formance of Eric Boateng. 11-11, so
many hustle plays, big rebounds
he wouldn't let us lose today," said
Sun Devils head coach Herb Sendek.
"He really put the team on his back
and carried us through."
That said, the game was a marked
change from the Cardinal's trip down
to Tempe in January, when Arizona
State won by 18 and led 54-22 after
the first 20 minutes. This time around,
Stanford came out gunning and es
tablished a 35-28 halftime lead on 52
percent shooting.
The Cardinal found contributions

from a variety of players in the first
half. Senior guard Drew Shiller was
particularly locked in, as he hit a trio
of early three-pointers to give Stan
ford an initial advantage. He led all
scorers with 13 points at the break.
Senior guard Emmanuel Igbinosa
had a solid game off the bench, net
ting five points and hustling down a
number of loose balls. Fields added
nine in the early going, and Green had
six, including a bucket from behind
the arc with five seconds to play to
give the Cardinal its seven-point ad
vantage. That shot also gave Green
the school's single-season three
pointers made record (85), as he sur
passed Casey Jacobsen in the history
books.
"Stanford came out and hit us be
tween the eyes and had us on our
heels. Our team didn't come out with
the requisite passion that we need to
play with," Sendek said.
That fire did not hold. Green, who
shot just 2-14 and had a number of
threes rim out, would be held score
less in the second half, and Shiller
would tack on just three more points
to his total. Fields was one of the lone
sources of offense in the second half.
He would add 10 more points to fin
ish with a Stanford-high 19 on 75 per
cent shooting and in the process,
he became just the fifth Cardinal
player to drop more than 600 points
in a career. He currently stands at 618
points.
But even with production from
Fields and sophomore forward Jack
Trotter seven of his nine points
came in the second half the Cardi
nal as a team nailed just 10-28 takes
from the field and was a woeful 2-15
from behind the arc in the final 20
minutes. Arizona State, meanwhile,
was a model of consistency, shooting

12-27 in both halves.
"They defended well, but we had
some good looks," Dawkins said.
"Sometimes the ball just doesn't go
in."
The disparity in play prompted a
quick turnaround; Arizona State re
took the lead with 12:32 to play, and
pushed it to 10 by the 6:33 mark. Stan
ford was able to cut the margin down
to four with plenty of time remaining
2:34, to be exact but neither
team scored for nearly two minutes.
For the Cardinal, the opportunities to
tie the game presented themselves,
but missed free throws and three
pointers abounded before Fields'
fateful tip-in.
Stanford maintained its position in
the conference seventh despite
the loss, but to ensure that it escapes
the Pac-10 Tournament's play-in
game, the Cardinal will likely have to
take at least one of its remaining two
games. A share of the regular season
title is out of the question it was
even before the game went final, as
Cal beat up on Arizona to eliminate
Stanford from contention. The Wild
cats (13-14,7-8), currently sixth, come
to Maples on Saturday.
They are now the only priority for
Dawkins and his team, who will have
to rebound quickly from a painful
loss.
"We're not looking at seeding,
only Arizona for us," Dawkins said.
"If we play well, the rest of the stuff
will take care of itself."
"We can still play for something,"
he added.
The Cardinal will take on Arizona
at Maples Pavilion on Saturday at 4
p.m.
