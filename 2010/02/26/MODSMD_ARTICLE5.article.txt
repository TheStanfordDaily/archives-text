## Stanford falls to ASU despite early lead 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Luck has not been particularly kind to
Stanford this season. Thursday was no differ
ent misfortune reared its ugly head late,
as an own-basket by Landry Fields sealed an
Arizona State victory at Maples Pavilion.
Despite trailing for most of the game, the
Sun Devils emerged victorious, 68-60.
Stanford (12-15, 7-9 Pac-10), fresh off a
sweep of the Oregon schools, started the
night, barely alive for the Pac-10 crown,
while Arizona State (20-8,10-5), which had
won five of its previous six, entered as one of
two Pac-10 teams with even a shot at an at
large NCAA Tournament bid. For both, the
margin of error was exactly zero.
Flappenstance, then, was not welcome.
The sting of Fields's fluke play was thus all
the more damaging trailing by four with
50 seconds left, Fields appeared to corral an
Arizona State miss over center Eric
Boateng, but in trying to secure the ball, he
knocked it back up and in, pushing the
deficit to six. A quick Jeremy Green miss at
the other end cemented Stanford's fate

the Sun Devils made all eight of their foul
shots in the final minute.

"Can't do anything about that," said
Stanford head coach Johnny Dawkins. "The
game can be cruel. He made the right play to
go for the ball over a 6TI" guy."
But it was not simply a shortage of luck

NOTES : The men's basketball team slipped to 7-
9in the Pac-10 last night as it fell at home to
Arizona State, 68-60. Senior forward Landry
Fields led Stanford in scoring with 19 points.
Sophomore guard Jeremy Green, the Cardi
nal's second offensive stalwart, was uncharac
teristically ineffective, going 2-14 from the floor
(including 2-10 from behind the arc) for only 6
points. Stanford's next game is against Arizona,
which lost to Cal last night by a score of 95-71.

Sophomore forward Jack Trotter, above, could not keep the
Cardinal in the game against Arizona State. Stanford's
chances to win the Pac-10 Tournament look increasingly dim.
