## CARD HOOKS 'HORNS After perfect start, Stanford plays No. 3 Texas 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford baseball team, com
ing off an 11-6 win over Pacific on
Wednesday, is off to its first 4-0 start
since its 2000 College World Series
runner-up season. After the first week
of play at Sunken Diamond, the pre
season-No. 25 Cardinal is currently
No. 18 after its sweep of No. 5 Rice
and the win against the visiting Tigers.
With renewed confidence in its offen
sive talent after its stellar hitting dis
play against Pacific, Stanford is in a
good position to give No. 3 Texas (2-2)
a tough matchup in this weekend's se
ries.

Wednesday's game saw five lead
changes through six innings, as Pacific
had led 2-0,3-2 and 5-4, while the Car
dinal had led 4-3 in the fifth. Though
for a while it was unclear who would
eventually take the lead for good, jun
ior Colin Walsh clinched the victory
for the Cardinal with a sixth inning
grand slam. Walsh picked an excellent
time to send his first career home run
over the right field wall, giving Stan
ford the momentum it needed to hold
on to the lead for the rest of the game.
Junior catcher Zach Jones also hit
his second home run of the season, a
three-run shot in the eighth to put the
game out of reach, giving the Cardi
nal an 11-5 lead.
Stanford's freshman class once
again contributed to the victory, as
left fielder Stephen Piscotty drove in
two runs to tie the game in the third
and his classmate, third baseman
Kenny Diekroeger, went three-for
three with two doubles and an infield
single.
Piscotty's smart base-running in
the fifth inning also gave the Cardinal
the edge when he scored from sec
ond, beating Pacific catcher Joe
Oliveira to home following a throw
ing error out of left field.
Stanford's offensive success so far
has been a pleasant surprise for head
coach Mark Marquess, who expected
that his team would win games be
cause of its defensive talent. On the
contrary, the Cardinal enters this
weekend's series averaging 9.5 runs

per game and batting .336, while nine
errors have been made on the defen
sive end.
"We are swinging the bat well,"
Marquess said. "But we have been
sloppy defensively, and there have
been too many errors up the middle.
We didn't field some bunts well, and
that hurt us tonight."
Wednesday's winning pitcher was
sophomore Brian Busick (1-0), who
managed to hold the Tigers to a score
less sixth inning. Once the Cardinal
gained a solid lead, Marquess was
able to cycle several young relief
pitchers through the rotation in order
to let them gain some early experi
ence. Freshman Mark Appel, fresh
man Chris Jenkins and sophomore
Elliott Byers saw time on the mound
in the final innings of the game and

held the lead for Stanford.
Pitching will play a huge role in
this weekend's series against Texas
for both the Card and the Longhorns,
who are coming off a 7-2 win over
Dallas Baptist on Wednesday and a
series loss to New Mexico last week
end. The team has allowed just 10
earned runs over its first 36 innings of
play (for a 2.50 ERA), and has held its
opponents to a batting average of
.257.
"Texas might have the best pitch
ing we will face all season," Marquess
said.
Ranked No. 1 in the preseason, Texas
returned its entire weekend rotation.
Last year the Longhorns posted the
second-lowest ERA in the country
(2.95), went 50-16-1, and "is even bet
ter than last year," according to Texas
head coach Augie Garrido.
The two programs have met annu
ally for a three-game series since 1998
and Stanford leads the regular series
16-13-1 since that time. Despite a
combined 50 College World Series
appearances, Stanford has faced
Texas only three times in Omaha:
1982,1987 and 2002.
The series will open today in
Austin, Texas at 1 p.m. PST, with soph
omore right-hander Jordan Pries (1-
0) on the mound for the Cardinal
against Texas right-hander Taylor
Jungmann (1-0).
