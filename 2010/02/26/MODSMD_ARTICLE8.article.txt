## RESEARCH Study: Global warming may inflate food prices 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
According to a study by Stanford agri
cultural scientists David Lobell Ph.D. 'O5
and Marshall Burke 'O2, with Purdue
University agricultural economist
Thomas Hertel, climate change may
affect food prices over the next 20 years,
with possible repercussions on poverty,
development and global conflict.
The study tested the impacts of food
production in three different agricultural
scenarios: high, moderate and low yield,
depending on temperature fluctuations.
The "moderate yield" outcome is most
likely; in comparison, the likelihood that
the "high yield" and "low yield" scenario
occurs is only five percent.
Lobell, a fellow at Stanford's Program

on Food Security and the Environment
(FSE), explained that as temperature
rises, soil would dry up and change plants'
natural biological processes, decreasing
food productivity. With less food avail
able, grain prices might increase 30 per
cent relative to 1990, said Lobell, adding
that because those in poverty spend a sig
nificant amount of their income on food,
they tend to be the ones most hurt by ris
ing food prices.
Lobell said this study is unique in
examining scenarios apart from the one
considered most likely by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change. He noted that policy makers
should take all outcomes into considera
tion because their decisions influence a
nation's ability to cope with climate
change.

Walter Falcon, deputy director of FSE,
said the study emphasizes "a very tight,
strong and powerful" connection
between food supply and climate change.
Food supply is also linked to technolo
gy, Falcon noted. Because a great deal of
fertile land has already been used, pro
ductivity will decrease without further
investment in research, development and
technology.
However, Falcon warned that devel
opment and technological innovation
could have negative effects on the envi
ronment.
"It's important, and we can do some
thing about it," he said of decreasing pro
ductivity. "But it's not going to be easy
given potential stresses between increases
in technology and disruptive environmen
tal consequences."

Aside from pointing toward the poten
tial need for technological advances, the
study also analyzed how the changing
food productions would impact different
groups of people. Studying 15 developing
countries in Asia, Africa and Latin
America, Lobell and his colleagues found
that the effects vary greatly among coun
tries and even between economic sub
groups within a country.
For countries that are agriculture
dependent, like Indonesia, the study
found that the country would see a reduc
tion in overall poverty. However, where
poor people work to produce but not
sell food, or live in urban environ
ments, as in Brazil, poverty rates would
increase substantially.

And while net poverty does not
change greatly in the most likely sce
nario, Lobell said some poorer coun
tries would see rising poverty rates,
especially in Africa where food pro
duction will drastically decrease.
"It ultimately does become an
environmental justice issue, and a
matter of ... who can afford to pay
for the changes to come," said Theo
Gibbs 'll, co-president of Students
for a Sustainable Stanford.

On Wednesday afternoon,
Stephen Schneider, a fellow at
Stanford's Woods Institute for the
Environment, and Karim Farhat, a
graduate student in energy resources
engineering, gave presentations about
their experiences at the Copenhagen
Climate Conference held last
December. Schneider and Farhat led
a delegation to the conference that
included a number of Stanford stu
dents.

Philippe de Koning 'lO, a member
of the Stanford delegation to
Copenhagen, notes that many of
these nations most affected by climate
change are already aware of the
future problems.
"We're already seeing a lot of the
effect of climate change like famine
and drought," he said of developing
countries. "But developed nations
don't suffer from those problems as
much so it's not as pressing for them,
which is one of the reasons I think
why Copenhagen failed."
Generally, developing countries
act concurrently in order to have
more influence, said Farhat, who rep
resented the Stanford delegation dur
ing the negotiations between nations.
But he added that because each coun
try has vastly different food needs, the
question of food security was intense
ly negotiated in Copenhagen without
consensus.

"The monolith of developing
countries is over," Schneider agreed.
"There's a spectrum of views among
everyone ... and that is why you need
to drive people to the middle."
Schneider also warned in his pres
entation that decreasing food supply
exacerbated by growing popula
tions, climate change and poor devel
opment strategies could harm
international security.
De Koning, whose senior honors

thesis is in international security stud
ies, predicts that conflict will increase
as people migrate to escape famines.
"When you have people immigrat
ing and emigrating, you're bound to
encounter a clash of communities," he
said. "Especially when this happens
on such a large scale, we're bound to
see a dramatic rise in conflict in the
places most affected."
