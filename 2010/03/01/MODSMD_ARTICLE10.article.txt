## ASSU election season enters final petition week 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
With five days remaining to earn a
chance on the ballot for April student
government elections, hopeful ASSU
Executive, Undergraduate Senate
and Graduate Student Council can
didates and special fees groups are
coming into Monday morning with,
in some cases, hundreds of signatures
to go.
In the ASSU executive race, four
slates have public petitions open. On
one are Thom Scher and Stephanie
Werner, both juniors; on another,
graduate students Ryan Peacock and
Jonathan Bakke.
Peacock is currently the financial
officer of the Graduate Student
Council; Bakke serves as chair of the
Nominations Commission.
Rounding out the executive petitions
are Katherine Heflin ‘ll and Daniel
Leifer TO on “The No Rain
Campaign” and Billy Kemper T1 and
Josh Meisel ‘l2 on “Two Dope Boys
in a Caddylack.”
Hopeful executive candidates
must secure 200 student signatures,
including graduates and undergradu
ates, to get a spot on the ballot.
On Sunday night, 40 prospective
Senate candidates appeared on the
election Web site, including incum
bents Dean Young ‘ll, Anton
Zietsman ‘l2 and Michael Cruz ‘l2.
Candidates who make it to the ballot
will ultimately vie for 15 seats.
Prospective Senate candidates must
gather 100 signatures.
So far, seven graduate students
are petitioning for spots on the
Graduate Student Council.
Fourteen student groups are also
hoping to garner enough signatures
for spots on the ballot, including this
newspaper.
Sigma Nu has a public petition
open said to be for funding for
Sunsplash, Moonsplash and the fra
ternity’s charity concert Snowchella,
but on Sunday the group’s petition
was ruled ineligible by election com
missioner Quinn Slack ‘ll. He said
Sigma Nu could appeal to the
Constitutional Council or ask the
Senate to propose a joint bylaws
amendment, a lengthy process.
According to the election com
mission’s public announcements at
press time, one group, SPOON, has
reached the signature threshold for
placement on the ballot.
Petitioning is set to close Friday at
4 p.m. Campaigns are scheduled for
the first two weeks of spring quarter;
voting begins April 8.
