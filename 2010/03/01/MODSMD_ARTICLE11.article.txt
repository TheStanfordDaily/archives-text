## Op-Ed One student’s experience in earthquake-stricken Chile 
### 
A I 2:30 in the morning, I had returned
home from a Chilean barbecue full of
dancing and salty spiced meat. Tired
out, 1 fell into a deep sleep in my small room.
Next thing, screams. A nightmare, I was
sure; the world was blurred. Unseen crashings
from behind frantically shaking walls. I don't
remember well what happened, my memory
only contains an instant of trying to stand
braced against the wall as lights flashed
around me. I think the lights, I remember,
were my panic.
Darkness; my door was open and 1 was
searching for my keys. “Chris! Chris! Las
Haves!” shouted my host mom.
“Espera!" was all I could force out. “Es
pera!”
We were downstairs and the key scraped
jagged circles around the lock to the gate out
of our apartment. My whole body was shaking
I thought the earth was still bucking and I
couldn’t let us out as my host mom continued
to shout,“ Chris! Chris!”
We were out. Darkness, except for the first
headlights stabbing out of side streets. I re
member. it was pitch black in the stairwells
too; 1 don’t know how we made it down to
gether.
I looked around quivering. My host mom
was sobbing, barely breathing and babbling to
God. The earth seemed to be still now. A few
wide-eyed people came out of the apartments
along the street, and I realized my sweatshirt
was on backwards.
My host mom tried to ask a gentleman
from the second floor what had happened. He
was stoic. “Muy fuerte,” he said, shaking his
head and looking up at the building. “Muy,
muy fuerte. Y largo.” Almost unfeeling.
We stood with bare feet on broken con
crete. The world was still blurred around me,
half due to my sleep-dazed mind and half due
to forgetting to grab my glasses. I realized why
my mom was still so distraught - her elderly
mom,“la abuelita”, lived alone in the top floor
of an old apartment building across the city.
Our building was strong, but hers could be in
any condition.
I tried to ask the gentleman how bad it was

and what had happened.
My host mom suddenly told us we could
not wait. We ran back up the obscured stair
well. expecting the walls and ceilings to rend
themselves at any moment. Inside, we strug
gled to find things with the dim light of my cell
phone. I grabbed shoes, wallet and glasses and
helped her find a jacket and blanket to keep
warm. Our nerves were firing in every direc
tion.
Down in the street again, I put my shoes on
and we started off. My host mom was crying
and praying as we crossed side streets without
stoplights. “For favor Dios en el cielo!” she
whimpered as we scurried around broken
glass. “Mi mam?, Se?or, por favor'’’ She was
distraught; I shook as we continued like des
perate pilgrims, all holding hands.
The only light came from headlights. They
blinded us. Our feet kicked tinkling glass and
small chunks of concrete across the sidewalk.
People walked alone or in small groups in all
directions. When falls of debris covered our
path, we swerved into the edge of the street.
We walked thus for 30 minutes. I tried to
tell my host mom to breathe. She lapsed into
silence for a time and then began her strained
pleading again.“Oh Dios en el cielo ayudanos,
por favor Se?or!” Breathless, tear-stained
pleading.
Near Plaza Italia waterfalls of clear, dark
water poured from the upper stories of a
building and ran unchecked through the
street.
We entered the side street where her moth
er lived. She was convinced she would see
crushing rubble perched where the apartment
had been, but instead I felt like I had finally re
entered a world capable of love. Two neigh
bors called down at us from a second-story
window and after a rapid exchange my host
mom was looking to the sky and thanking
God. Her mother was safe; the buildings stood
unaffected.
