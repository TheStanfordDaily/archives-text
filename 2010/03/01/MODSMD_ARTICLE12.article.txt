# THE
						GAO REPORT
## A
						Liberal Artist’s Anxieties 
### Shelley Gao 
r V ihis past weekend, thousands of adults de
scended onto the Farm, participating in
-1- the annual ritual known as Parents’
Weekend. Numerous activities including facul
ty lectures, campus tours, open houses and re
ceptions were scheduled to offer families an in
sight into the academic and campus lives of
Stanford students. Despite the hectic program
ming schedule. I am sure many parents man
aged to squeeze in those little chats about “fu
ture plans.”
As we approach the end of our time at Stan
ford, we are faced with increasing pressure
from parents and society to define our post
graduation trajectory. As students of the liberal
arts, particularly those of us majoring in the hu
manities. we confront a set of unsettling ques
tions. What is the value of a liberal arts educa
tion in today's marketplace? Is there a crisis of
confidence in the humanities among college
students? Are the humanities legitimate and
worthwhile pursuits in a time of growing eco
nomic instability and financial insecurity?
The value of the liberal arts is the value of in
dependent thinking. It is about opening the
mind and valuing ideas for their own sake.The
social sciences, engineering and natural sci
ences generally attempt to harness informa
tion, analyze it. deduce trends and generate
models or theories for future application. The
humanities grapple with the ambiguities to in
terpret a complex world. Rather than breaking
the universe down into quantifiable elements,
the humanities bring a unified wholeness to un
derstanding the phenomena of life.
The humanities are founded on the meta
physical conviction that an education should
encourage a thirst for knowledge. There is in
trinsic value in pursuing knowledge as an end,
not merely as a means. Unfortunately, this be
lief is becoming less firmly entrenched among
today's students. Since the 19605. there has been
a dramatic shift in the preference of majors pur
sued by undergraduates in American higher
education.There has been a decline in the study
of humanities for example, English, philoso
phy. foreign languages and history and a ris
ing entrance into technical and pre-profession
al fields like business and computer science.
This shift in major selection is reflected by a
change in the psyche of American undergradu
ates. Alexander W. Astin. the director of High
er Education Research Institute at UCLA, re
ports that in the mid 19605. more than 80 per
cent of entering college freshmen stated that
“developing a meaningful philosophy of life”
was their top priority. By 2001. more than 70
percent of students selected “being very well
off financially” as their foremost objective of a
college education.
However, are finding meaning to existence
and attaining financial security mutually exclu
sive? Lacking the passion to enter academia

and driven by strong pragmatic and activist im
pulses, I face a constant struggle between doing
and thinking. Like many other humanities ma
jors at Stanford, I wrestle with the question of
whether our conviction that knowledge is a
human good in and of itself will translate into
“real world" success. Each time, I conclude that
a humanities background not only will, but also
will matter more in the long term.
Having now received some kind of formal
schooling in three continents; I can say that the
American higher education system is truly
unique in its philosophy and manifestation.
From my experience of primary education in
China, the focus is on obsessive memorization
and rote learning, with almost no room for orig
inal thinking. Had I chosen to attend an institu
tion of higher learning in Australia (where I
spent a decade) or the United Kingdom, I
would have launched into a field of specializa
tion such as law, medicine, or finance immedi
ately after high school. American universities
are one of the only places left in the world that
still insist on undergraduates receiving a broad
and humanistic education.
While there are no “hard skills” gained from
liberal arts, it fosters an environment where in
dependent thought and creativity are cultivat
ed. It develops a mindset that challenges con
ventions and forges new heights. It is responsi
ble for America's pioneering strides in devising
medical breakthroughs, creating new con
sumer products or making scientific discover
ies.
I chose America because it is daring, defiant
and downright sexy. Being an intellectual in
volves a commitment towards social transfor
mation thinking to realize the good society.
But thinking is not enough. America has
demonstrated that it does not merely advance
ideas, but has the will and power to implement
them, using the knowledge for the good of hu
manity. There is something intoxicatingly
thrilling about becoming part of that discourse.
So. here's an ode to the liberal arts, and to
the United States of America.
