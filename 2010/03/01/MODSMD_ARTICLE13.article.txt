# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Lost in Translation 
### Emily Hulme 
Fact: not everyone speaks the same lan
guage. This was not always the case.
Before there was English and before
there was Old German and even before
people spoke cuneiform or Indo-European,
it was not so. Some people say we all spoke
the same language until the Tower of Babel.
Other people allege we all spoke the same
language until the Rosetta Stone Company,
subsidiary of Hallmark, invented other ones
in order to open up a billion dollar market.
Either way, the fact is still true.
This is why we translate things. We trans
late words and books, and also cuisine and
cars and styles. We can take a book like Le
Comte de Monte-Cristo and make it under
standable for a student in a high school liter
ature class in Ohio. We can make fettuccini
in Boston. We can even negotiate the
treacherous freeways of Tucson with a
BMW. What was once impossible is actual
ized. We can take one thing a word, a ve
hicle, a dish and bring it somewhere else
in order to be grasped.
This may or may not be a magnificent feat
of human ingenuity. Is it incredible that ideas
expressed 2,500 years ago in Greek can be
read in plain English, or, better yet, summa
rized by Spark Notes in plainer English? Yes,
it is. But, as any Babel Fish user can tell you,
sometimes translations go horribly awry. My
word-for-word translation of a certain lotion
they peddle in Italy is “body-milk-of-pretti
ness.” Is this an excellent product name that
I have already copyrighted in major Ameri
can markets? Probably. Is it what they
meant? No. In fact, almost every language
has these things called “idioms” which tend
to translate poorly. And some phrases do not
even translate from one person to another

even when they speak the same language.
This category includes inside jokes and fam
ily stories. Does “phosphate of lemmox”
mean anything to you? I hope not.
Because of this, it is pretty imperative to
understand the difference between mean
ing and meaning. Ah ha that doesn't
make any sense! But take the inside joke as
an example. Suppose you have an inside
joke about Kesha with your friend. In fact,
suppose your first name is Emily and you
are now insisting on going by “Emily with a
Euro sign.” So, you’re milling about your
day with a couple of other friends, attempt
ing to ingratiate yourself to the bookstore
cat? employees perhaps so they’ll give
you the leftover and/or stale cookies and
you run across some dry looking book with
a euro sign on the cover talking about the fi
nancial security of the Spanish seal pelt
market. You point and say “it’s me” to one
friend, who gets it, and another who does
not. Do you make sense or not? Obviously it
depends. Your words mean something to
one person and nothing to the other. It did
not make any sense for me to say “meaning”
means something distinct from “meaning”
at the beginning of this paragraph. But now,
hopefully, it does mean something. And that
is the whole point.
So, then, I have observed a few tricks of
the trade for translation, and also learned
this week how to use alliteration in order to
emphasize a topic sentence. First of all, it’s
easier to translate if you already know in
your home language what the mystery text
is going to say. For instance, I could probably
do a sweet translation of Romeo e Giulietta.
I bet they have families that are feuding and
die at the end. This applies to life in general.

Do you like food? I don’t even know you
and I know the answer is yes. It is like I
cheated and/or used statistics. If this doesn’t
work out, you find someone else who al
ready knows the answer and use them as
your pocket dictionary. Keep adding people
until you have a trail of pebbles to take you
home.
In essence, picking out this route is all
translation ever is. All translation is self
translation, just as, in the wise words of
Patrick Kozey, all tanning is self tanning.
Picking your trail then, is the difference be
tween understanding and being lost in a nest
of confusion, and probably Tusken Raiders.
I’m pretty sure they go hand in hand.
