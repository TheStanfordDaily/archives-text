## Bicycle Tragedy Underscores Brain Injury Awareness Month Message 
### 
As reported in the Feb. 22 Daily, a
young and gifted graduate student
died tragically from injuries sus
tained from a bicycle accident.
Despite aggressive Public Health efforts,
this remains a not infrequent occurrence
both nationally and locally, as bicycle acci
dents remain a significant percent of all traf
fic fatalities in both the US (2.3%) and with
in CA (3.2%)
The particulars of this recent tragedy are
consistent with reported statistics and thus
underscore the importance of ongoing safety
efforts. As with most traffic accidents, young
men are the most at risk. In 2008,87% of cy
clists killed were male and those ages 25 and
older continue to make up an increasing pro
portion of fatalities, 64% in 2008.
Mr. Wang was not wearing a helmet at the
time of his accident. It is certain that this was
a contributing factor in his death. Data com
piled and reported by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
note that helmets are 85-88% effective in
mitigating head and brain injuries. Thus it re
mains alarming that only 20-25% of all bicy
clists wear bicycle helmets, despite the fact
that nearly 70% of all fatal bicycle crashes in
volve head injuries.
California is one of 21 states and the Dis
trict of Columbia that has created age specif
ic bicycle helmet laws (passed in 1986, effec
tive in 1987). Unfortunately, these helmet
laws do not apply to adults and so they con
tinue to contribute disproportionately to the
fatality statistics. In addition to helmets, the
most effective measures are education ef
forts and prevention. Stanford should be ap
plauded in the numerous measures the com
munity has undertaken to increase aware
ness and compliance. Nonetheless, as the re
cent tragedy demonstrates, we must continue
to be vigilant.
As we approach March, Brain Injury
Awareness month, it is important to remind
all motorists and cyclists of their joint respon
sibilities in keeping safe. The National High
way Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)

and the Stanford Bicycle Program remain
valuable resources. Cyclists, let’s not forget
to wear a helmet every time you ride and fol
low the same rules as other roadway users.
You are not invincible.
