# Why Wearing a Bike Helmet Matters
## 
### 
A1 was deeply moved by the recent
death of a fellow Stanford graduate
student, Yichao Wang, after a bike
crash on Feb 3. The tragic accident caught
my attention for two reasons: first, because
it involved another Stanford student, young
and only 25-years old, and riding on exactly
the same route along University Avenue
that is transited every day by hundreds of
other students, including myself. More im
portantly, I was struck by the fact that it may
have been possible to prevent this fatality
by the simple act of wearing a helmet, an act
about which we are constantly being re
minded how important it is, yet in which
many of us still don't engage in. While I un
derstand that the emotional wounds of
those close to Wang may still be too fresh for
me to use his example to talk about bike
safety, I also believe that it is precisely in
these days shortly after Wang’s death, that
an attempt to remind Stanford students
about the importance of wearing a helmet
will have the greatest impact.
There are three reasons for why I believe
that Stanford students don’t wear helmets,
and three suggestions I have for overcoming
them:
1. Inconvenience; A helmet is big bulky
item, and carrying it to class, to work or to the
dorm can be a major inconvenience. One
thing I started doing to deal with this issue is
simply clipping the helmet directly to the
bike and leaving it there while the bike is
resting on the stand.That way I will automat
ically pick the helmet up next time I ride and
will not be bothered by the inconvenience of
having to carry it around. As for helmet theft,
I have not vet heard of such an occurrence on

the Stanford campus, especially if helmets
can be bought for a mere $2O at the Bike
Shop.
2. Reputation; The fear of being classified
as a geek led many of us to refuse wearing a
helmet (until a few months ago that included
me). My hunch is that this is the main reason
for why so many students still don't wear hel
mets. The solution, and this may not be easy:
get over the fear of damaging your reputa
tion, be an adult, and do what you think is
right. After all, aren't our lives (yes, this is
about life and death!) that much more im
portant than what others think about our
looks?
3. Lack of awareness; We all have heard
that bike crashes can lead to serious acci
dents, and we all know that by wearing a hel
met we could prevent fatal consequences of
such accidents. But how often do we hear of
someone dying from a bike crash, especially
if it’s someone who works and rides on our
own “safe” campus? Not very often. I believe
that on an emotional level few of us have
connected the dots from bike riding to bike
accidents to brain trauma to death, and that
because of this emotional disconnect we
have failed at taking bike riding seriously
enough to wear a helmet. Because of the rar
ity of instances when someone at Stanford
dies from a bike crash, I recommend that this
accident in particular be turned into a valu
able opportunity to bring the consequences
of insufficient bike safety bluntly and direct
ly to our hearts.
This final point leads me to a short sugges
tion for the Department of Public Safety: in
the next few days, maybe next week, and
while the memory of this accident is still fresh
in our minds, send this very short survey to
every Stanford student, asking four ques
tions:
1. Did you know that a 25-year old Stan
ford student died after a bike crash on Uni
versity Avenue this month?
2. If yes, did you know that he was not
wearing a helmet?
3. Do you ride a bicycle on campus?
4. If yes, do you wear a helmet?
Maybe just by answering these four
rhetorical questions we can be reminded of
how easy it could be to prevent another acci
dent like Yichao Wang’s.
