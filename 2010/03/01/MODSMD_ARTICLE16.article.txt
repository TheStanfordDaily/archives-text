Card did not have a swimmer or a relay team
in the top four.
Unlike in years past, Stanford was able to
emerge as the Pac-10's top dual-meet team as
well as its tournament champion. Last year.

despite an undefeated record in Pac-10 com
petition, Stanford only managed to finish
third at Pac-lOs.
The tournament started on Wednesday,
Feb. 24 with two relay events the 200-yard
medley relay and the 800-yard freestyle
relay. The Cardinal finished second in both
events, just behind No. 4 Arizona in the 200
medley and No. 9 Southern California in the
800 free. The first day ended with Stanford in
third place, four points behind Cal and Ari
zona.
On Feb. 25, Stanford began to dominate

the conference competition, with three wins
in five events. The Cardinal scored victories
in the 50-yard freestyle, the 200 free relay and
the 200 IM. In the 50 free, sophomore Betsy
Webb won her first Pac-10 title by a slim mar
gin of .05 seconds over Cal’s Liv Jensen and
.11 seconds over USC's Presley Bard. Stan
ford’s relay team of Webb, sophomore Sam
Woodward, junior Kate Dwelley and senior
Julia Smit also took the 200 free relay over
Cal’s top team, replicating their success from
the Big Meet two weeks ago.
Smit was the real star of Stanford’s efforts.

In the 200 IM finals, Smit took the event by
more than three seconds over Olympic
medalist Katinka Hosszu of USC. Her time
of 1:52.31 was a new American. NCAA. Pac
-10 and Stanford record.
Those two wins were just the first of many
victories for Smit at the Championships. The
next day, Smit returned for the 400 IM and
set another American record with a time of
3:58.23. She defeated her closest competitor.
Hosszu, by over six seconds.

The Stanford women's swimming team dominated the competition on the way to winning the Pac-10 title. Senior Julia Smit, who led the way for the Cardinal with three individual and six total titles, was selected as the Swimmer of the Meet.
Stanford as a whole had a very
strong third day of competition, win
ning four events out of seven. In ad
dition to Smit’s win, the Cardinal
took home the 100-yard butterfly
(courtesy of senior Elaine Bree
den), the 200 free (Dwelley) and the
400 medley relay. Also, Webb took
second place in the 100-yard back
stroke, setting a Stanford record in
the process. Breeden finishes her
Pac-10 career with five conference
titles.
Stanford completed the tourna
ment on Saturday with another

strong showing. It won three more ti
tles— the 200-yard backstroke, the
200 breast and the 400 free relay. In
the 200 back, Smit won her third indi
vidual title and broke her third Stan
ford record in as many days with a
one-second margin of victory over
USC’s Bard. Junior Liz Smith, the
Cardinal’s top breaststroke swim
mer, took the 200 breast by two sec
onds. The last event of the champi
onships, the 400 free relay, was won
by Smit, Webb, Dwelley and fresh
man Andi Murez, though by that
point Stanford had already secured
its title.
“I definitely knew that I had a lot of
potential leading up to the race,”
Smith said. “I never go into finals ex
pecting to win, because no one is ever
going to hand you a race it’s al

ways a fight. It was a great race and I
am excited to see what I can do once
I am fully rested for NCAAs.”
At the end, Smit had won three in
dividual titles and six championships,
including relays, in the final confer
ence meet of her Stanford career. She
was the unanimous choice for the
Swimmer of the Meet. Her final tally
includes eight individual conference
titles over her four years swimming
for the Cardinal.
While Stanford’s swimming team
dominated,its diving team had mixed
success at the Pac-10 Championships
in Federal Way, Wash. Junior Meg
Hostage took fourth in the one
meter springboard, while senior Car
men Stellar won fourth in both the
three-meter springboard and plat
form diving.

Only one event remains on the
Cardinal’s schedule the NCAA
Championships next month. The
Cardinal will carry its No. 1 national
ranking into the tournament, and will
be one of two favorites. Its top com
petition will come from Georgia,
which shares the top ranking with the
Card.
“Looking forward to NCAAs, I
think that our team definitely has a
shot at a team title, but there are quite
a few quality teams out there who are
contenders as well,” Smith said.
“Going into the meet, our mindset
will be the same as it has been all year
have fun, stay focused on the team
and swim fast with lots of heart.”
