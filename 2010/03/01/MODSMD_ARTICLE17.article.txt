# CARD TOPS CATS IN ARIZONA

### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford’s winning streak in the Pac-10 Conference
continued over the weekend, as the team finished off its
trip to the Grand Canyon State with a 75-48 win over Ari
zona.
The Wildcats (13-14, 6-10 Pac-10) managed to stay
close for the entire first period, but a few minutes into the
second half the No. 2 Cardinal (26-1, 17-0) pushed out a
commanding lead that sealed the contest.
Returning to her home state. Fountain Hills native jun
ior forward Kayla Pedersen had 26 points and six re
bounds, while three other Stanford starters made it to
double figures in scoring.
In response, the Pac-lO’s rebounding leader, Arizona
junior forward Ify Ibekwe, was the best performer in the
Wildcats' ranks, recording the only double-double of the
contest to end with 15 points and 12 rebounds.
The headline-grabbing statistic, though, was set by sen
ior center Jayne Appel. Having already firmly secured her
place in Cardinal history, she broke USC legend Lisa
Leslie’s rebounding mark to ascend to the top of the Pac
-10 record books with 1.218 boards. Stanford now has the
conference records for both points (Candice Wiggins ‘08)
and rebounds (Appel).
True to form, however. Appel remained unfazed, her
eyes firmly set on the one prize that has so far evaded her
in her collegiate career.
