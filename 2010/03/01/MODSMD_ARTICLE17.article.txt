# CARD TOPS CATS IN ARIZONA
## 
### TOM TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford’s winning streak in the Pac-10 Conference
continued over the weekend, as the team finished off its
trip to the Grand Canyon State with a 75-48 win over Ari
zona.
The Wildcats (13-14, 6-10 Pac-10) managed to stay
close for the entire first period, but a few minutes into the
second half the No. 2 Cardinal (26-1, 17-0) pushed out a
commanding lead that sealed the contest.
Returning to her home state. Fountain Hills native jun
ior forward Kayla Pedersen had 26 points and six re
bounds, while three other Stanford starters made it to
double figures in scoring.
In response, the Pac-lO’s rebounding leader, Arizona
junior forward Ify Ibekwe, was the best performer in the
Wildcats' ranks, recording the only double-double of the
contest to end with 15 points and 12 rebounds.
The headline-grabbing statistic, though, was set by sen
ior center Jayne Appel. Having already firmly secured her
place in Cardinal history, she broke USC legend Lisa
Leslie’s rebounding mark to ascend to the top of the Pac
-10 record books with 1.218 boards. Stanford now has the
conference records for both points (Candice Wiggins ‘08)
and rebounds (Appel).
True to form, however. Appel remained unfazed, her
eyes firmly set on the one prize that has so far evaded her
in her collegiate career.

Junior forward Kayla Pedersen drives to the hoop against an Arizona player. Pedersen finished the game with 26
points and six rebournds while teammate Jayne Appel grabbed eight rebounds to set the Pac-10 career record.
“It is a tremendous accomplish
ment, but I’m sorry, I want a nation
al championship,” Appel said.
In the first few moments, the
Wildcats jumped out to a 4-0 lead be
fore Stanford countered with an 11-
point run. From there on in the game
was close, with the Cardinal unable
to break free of Arizona in the first
period. At the half-time buzzer five
points separated the two, and the
shooting percentages were almost
the same with 37.1 percent for Stan
ford compared to 36.7 percent for
Arizona.
Some of this can be explained by
sophomore forward Nnemkadi Og
wumike being called for two early
fouls that saw her sidelined, playing
just six minutes and scoring two
points in the first half. In her 18 min
utes in the second she netted a fur
ther 13 points.
Earlier in the season, the Cardi
nal trailed Arizona at the half at
Maples before the opposing team’s
challenge dropped away in the sec
ond period. With 13 minutes remain
ing in Tucson, history began to re
peat itself, and Stanford ran out to an
unbeatable lead.
Fatigue must have played a part
in the final result as Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer was able to
call on a total of 13 players in her
squad to take the court, but, in com
parison, Arizona head coach Niya
Butts only had a rotation of eight.
As the opposition tired, the Cardi
nal women made the Wildcats pay, hit
ting 14-28 field goals in the second pe
riod and 7-13 from behind the arc. In
almost every statistical category Stan
ford was the clear leader by the end.
Two days previously against Ari
zona State in Tempe the Card had
committed a season-high 21
turnovers, showing everyone that
there was room for improvement.
The four turnovers in this game, a
season low, were the perfect re
sponse.
“To have only four turnovers was
great for us,” VanDerveer said. “That
was something we wanted to work
on coming into this game. It is some
thing we have been focusing on so

we did really well.”
Redshirt senior guard Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude was forced to sit out
her first game of the season after
taking a knock to the head in the
Card’s win over ASU two days pre
viously. Though not seriously in
jured, with the conference title and
top seed in the Pac-10 Tournament
already secured, the team took the
precautionary measure to rest her
and ensure she is fit for the looming
post-season challenges.
Her defensive presence may have
been missed, but the good news is
that even without a key player in the
starting lineup the team still took a
solid win on hostile ground.
The Cardinal women now return
to the Bay Area, heading across to
Berkeley for the team’s final confer
ence game this Saturday. The Gold
en Bears need a win to clinch third
place in the conference, and, as an
added incentive, have the chance to
tarnish their cross-bay rival’s perfect
conference record.
Tip off is at 12:30 p.m. in Berke
ley.
