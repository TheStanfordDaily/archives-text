## Last-second shot spoils Card victory Men's basketball falls on buzzer-beating shot by Arizona 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Maples Pavilion was brimming with excitement with
just seconds to go and the Cardinal holding the ball for the
final shot in a tie game. After the buzzer sounded, there
was little more than shocked silence.
Stanford took one of the toughest losses imaginable
Saturday afternoon against Arizona, as Wildcats guard La
ment Jones banked in a running 15-foot jumper as time ex
pired. The play occurred immediately after sophomore
center Jack Trotter's dunk attempt was rejected by Ari
zona's Derrick Williams on the other side of the court a
play that elicited resounding boos from a Cardinal crowd
wanting a foul call.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins had no opinion on the no
call.
“Too much was going on and I couldn't exactly see
what happened,” he said". “I credit them defensively. We
have to execute better to free our
guys up.”
Instead, the ever-humble coach
praised Williams for his play.
“He’s a tough cover,” Dawkins
said. “He’s a big-time player. [He’s]
probably the best freshman in the
conference and quite frankly one of
the best players in the conference.”

There may have been some con
tact on the play, but in any case, the
block by Williams was an incredibly
athletic play by one of the confer
ence’s rising stars, and the referees
apparently saw enough contact with
the ball to keep their whistles away.
The Cardinal also had plenty of
chances to secure the game before
the final seconds. After falling behind
by as much as 11 in the first half, Stan
ford led for much of the second half
until the Wildcats tied the game at 64
with four minutes to go. Coach
Dawkins’ squad also struggled at the
free-throw line, which may have ulti
mately cost the team the game: Stan
ford made only 10 of 18 shots from
the charity stripe, and missed four of
its final five attempts.
“We didn’t finish,” Dawkins said.
“It’s a tough loss for us. We had our
chances and we credit them for mak
ing the plays when it counted.”
That said, the Cardinal still played
well for most of Saturday’s contest,
led by 24 points from senior wing
Landry Fields, 15 from sophomore
shooting guard Jeremy Green and 13
from sophomore point guard Jarrett
Mann. Trotter, despite giving up 24
points to the more athletic Williams,

turned in another solid showing with
eight points and nine rebounds.
Despite playing 39 minutes and
leading the team as he has done all sea
son, Fields was tough on himself after
going 2-7 from the free-throw line.
“I didn’t execute on free throws
and I had five turnovers so I wouldn’t
say it was a very good game for me,”
he said.
Dawkins was still proud of the
senior, though.
“He’s been our best player,” the
coach said. “He makes all the plays
for us not just scoring the basket
ball. We wouldn’t be where we are if

it wasn’t for what Landry Fields has
done for us all season long.”
Saturday’s contest was a game of
runs, as Arizona went up 27-16 with
six minutes remaining in the first half.
Stanford answered back with a 22-4
run of its own, going into the locker
rooms with a seven-point lead. The
Cardinal led 63-55 with just over six
minutes to go in the second half, but
Arizona was able to rally and score
16 of the game’s final 22 points for the
victory.
Stanford has no choice but to
stomach Saturday’s loss, as Cal pays a
visit to Maples Pavilion for the regu

lar-season finale this coming Satur
day at Maples Pavilion.
The Bears clinched a share of the
Pac-10 title after beating Arizona
State on Saturday, but Dawkins
knows that the on-paper record
doesn't always translate to the court.
“Any time you’re playing against
your rival you’re gonna get up for it,”
he said. “You throw out the records. I
would expect our guys to take this
[loss] hard ... in preparation for a
tough challenge against California.”
