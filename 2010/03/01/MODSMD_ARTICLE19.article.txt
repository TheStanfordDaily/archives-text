## 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men’s volley
ball team, led by sophomore outside
hitter Brad Lawson, past
Pacific 3-1 in a Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) match for
its second victory against the Tigers
this season.
The 30-24,28-30,30-16,31-29 will
over Pacific improved the Cardinal’s
record to 10-4 overall and 8-4 in the
conference. Lawson hit .561 and
recorded 27 kills for Stanford. Senior
opposite hitter Evan Romero and
junior outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin each registered 14 kills.
Pacific’s Taylor Hughes rivaled Law
son with 23 kills.
“As a team, we were very resilient.

We handled UOP’s service pressure
well and stayed composed during the
tough points in the match,” said sen
ior setter Kawika Shoji, who tallied
61 assists on the night. “Everyone ful
filled their assignments, and Brad
[Lawson] had an unbelievable
night.”
In the first set, Pacific took an
early 5-2 lead, but it was not long be
fore Stanford would control the
tempo of the game. Romero’s service
ace tied it at 6-6, followed by
McLachlin’s kill to get Stanford back
on top 7-6. Stanford scored the next
five points before Pacific’s Nikola
Vukicevic hammered in a kill to end
the run. At 13-9, Shoji took a
McLachlin set for the kill. Stanford
stayed afloat the entire set and Shoji
had the last say in the match with a

kill followed by a Tiger attack error
for the 30-24 set win.
The next set started out the same
way with Pacific taking the early 5-3
lead and Stanford rallying back. The
Card tied it up four times at six,
seven, eight and nine before finally
taking the lead at 10-9. A Shoji serv
ice ace followed by attack errors
from Pacific gave Stanford the 13-9
edge. However, Pacific’s Hughes
helped regain the lead with a kill to

make it 14-13 after a five-point run.
Despite Lawson’s efforts, Stanford
trailed for the remainder of the set.
The last two points resulted in Cardi
nal errors as Pacific took the set, 30-
28.
In the third set, the Cardinal came
out firing from the start as Lawson
battled Hughes at the net. With kills
from McLachlin and senior middle
blocker Garrett Werner, Stanford led
the Tigers at 5-3. Lawson came back
with a pair of kills and an ace to set up
Stanford for a seven-point run that
included kills from Romero, sopho
more middle blocker Gus Ellis and
McLachlin. Lawson secured a 10-

point lead at 20-10. Ultimately,

Up two sets to one, Stanford ap
proached the fourth set hungry for
the match win. Pacific, on the other
hand, did not let up. A head-to-head
battle between the Tigers and the
Cardinal kept it close to start out the
set. Pacific came within one multiple
times until the Card pulled ahead 12-
7. McLachlin increased the lead to
15-10 as Stanford kept on rolling.
Freshman outside hitter Myles
Muagututia’s service ace solidified a
four-point edge over the Tigers at 22-
18, but a Pacific comeback brought
the Tigers within one, 23-22. A Stan
ford timeout allowed the team to re
group and refocus. Eventually, two
Pacific errors secured the win for the
Cardinal at 31-29.

“As a whole, we played well,”
Shoji said. “We didn’t play our best,
but we played consistently well,
which is what we needed to do to get
a win in a hostile road environment.”
The road win puts Stanford in sec
ond place in the American Volleyball
Coaches Association (AVCA) Poll,
right below Pepperdine. The Card is
still in the race for a national champi
onship, which will be determined at
Maples Pavilion this year on May 6
and 8.
On Friday, Stanford men’s volley
ball will host UC-San Diego and
Long Beach State for two conference
matches. First serves are scheduled
for 7 p.m. on Friday and 7:30 p.m. on
Saturday, respectively, in Maples
Pavilion.
