The Stanford men's baseball team
got its first taste of defeat this week
end, getting swept by the No. 3 Texas
Longhorns in a three-game series.
On Friday, the Cardinal struggled
to get its offense off the ground, leav
ing five runners in scoring position in
the first five innings en route to a 6-0
loss. Junior catcher Zach Jones
recorded two of Stanford's five hits
in the loss to Texas’s All-American
pitcher Taylor Jungmann. who had
10 strikeouts for the Longhorns. The
loss snapped the Cardinal’s season
opening four-game win streak, which
included three wins over then-No. 5
Rice.
In the second game of the series
on Saturday, the Cardinal was down
3-0 early in the game before closing
the deficit to 4-3 on a RBI groundout
by junior first basemen Jonathan
Kaskow in the top of the sixth inning.
However. Texas responded in the
bottom half with a two-out, two-run
double by Brandon Loy off sopho
more reliever Brian Busick. Those
two runs would be the last of the
game, as Longhorn reliever Chance
Ruffin would shut out the Card in the
last three innings to record the save.
On Sunday, trying to avoid the
sweep, the Cardinal offense once
again struggled to keep pace with
that of the Longhorns. Although

Stanford once again found itself
down 3-0 early, a Tyler Gaffney dou
ble. the first of his career, scored one
run in the second, and a Colin Walsh
RBI single in the third brought the
Cardinal within one at 3-2. Unfortu
nately for Stanford, this offensive
success would end as the Longhorns
brought in reliever Cole Green, who
pitched perfectly over the last five in
nings, recording 10 strikeouts with
zero hits and zero walks. A three-run
inning by the Longhorns in the bot
tom of the fourth and a two-run

eighth sealed the deal for Texas in the
8-2 victory over the Card.
