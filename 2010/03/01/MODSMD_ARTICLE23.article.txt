# FOOTBALL SPECIAL
## SPRING MEANS NEW QUESTIONS FOR CARD FOOTBALL PROGRAM 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal signed 17 prospec
tive freshmen and one transfer stu
dent on yesterday’s National Let
ters of Intent Signing Day, the cul
mination of several months of foot
ball recruiting across the country.
The class, ranked 50th in the na
tion by Rivals.com one of the
Web’s premier recruiting services
was coach Jim Harbaugh’s first
complete effort at Stanford. Dur
ing a press conference yesterday,
he seemed enthused over the Car
dinal’s haul.
“We are building a winning cul
ture at Stanford and this signing
class has brought us a lot of players
who know winning football,” he
said.
The team’s biggest addition was
four-star quarterback recruit An
drew Luck, ranked the country’s
fourth best prep gunslinger by Ri
vals.com. His accuracy and arm
strength are both listed as above
average one of his few prob
lems, apparently, is his release,
which is a time-consuming, almost
over-exaggerated flick of the wrist
in addition to his regular arm-mo
tion. Luck is reputed to be a smart
player who demonstrates remark
able pocket poise but also has the
mobility to create plays on the run.
“He’s a very strong, very tough
kid,” Harbaugh said.
The Cardinal coach now head
ing into his second year on the
Farm said that he consulted with
the late Cardinal coach and former
Athletic Director Bill Walsh, who
said that Luck’s “instincts,” which
are largely un-teachable, were ex
cellent.
Harbaugh felt that Luck has the
ability to challenge for playing time
during camp this summer.
“There will be strong competi
tion at quarterback this year,” he
said. Aside from Luck, the Cardinal
quarterbacking corps boasts in
cumbent sophomore starter Tavita
Pritchard, freshman L.D. Crow and
sophomore Jason Forcier, who will
be eligible to play in 2008 after
transferring from Michigan before
the‘o7 season.
Another big commitment for
the Cardinal came from Delano
Howell, a nationally ranked run
ning back recruit that Harbaugh
described as “one of our top guys in
the class.”
Howell has also played defen
sive back, and Harbaugh described
him as a potential “three way guy.”
Howell would appear to be a shifty
runner who excels in the open field.
Although he runs hard, Howell
may need to improve his overall
strength as he is incorporated into
the running back rotation a po
sition decimated by injuries last
season.
“He has a lot of talent,” Har
baugh said. “He has big dreams,
and he sees Stanford as the place to
make those dreams a reality.”
“He can make all the cuts; he
can run past people; and he can
block people,” said running backs
coach Willie Taggart.
The Cardinal’s best offensive
line recruit was David DeCastro,
ranked as the 11th best lineman in
the country by Rivals.com. DeCas
tro can play either center or tackle,

although he projects more as an in
side player. His footwork is reput
edly excellent, and although he
may need to increase his upper
body strength, Harbaugh did not
appear concerned, mentioning that
DeCastro looks bigger every time
he sees him.
“He’s going to play early,” Har
baugh said. “He’ll be very versatile
and very valuable to us.”
Stanford also signed the Reu
land brothers, Konrad and Warren.
Konrad is a big tight end and trans
fer from Notre Dame —he was
highly recruited out of high school
and is both a good pass-catcher and
blocker. He will have to sit out the
first few games of the 2008 season
for eligibility reasons, but should
compete for playing time after
ward.
Warren is a tall wide receiver
with good hands who should factor
into the wide receiver rotation
quickly next season, as the Cardi
nal lost this year’s pair of seniors,
Mark Bradford and Evan Moore.
“He can run numerous routes
from the outside wide receiver po
sition, or he can come inside and
play from the slot. We expect War
ren to be a red zone threat right off
the bat for us,” said offensive coor
dinator David Shaw.
Joining him there will be Chris
Owusu, another one of Harbaugh’s
top recruits. A speedster who may
also run track at Stanford, Owusu
could be an immediate deep threat
for the Cardinal.
“He has a combination of size
and speed, ability to run after the
catch as well as ability to help on
special teams as either a cover man
or a returner,” Shaw said.
Harbaugh also expressed de
light over the signing of Chase
Thomas, a defensive end from
Georgia who was pursued by SEC
schools. Although he’ll need to gain
weight in order to be a down-line
man in college, he already possess
es great pass-rushing skills, and is
versatile enough to play line
backer.
“He is the perfect guy to play
and end, or stand up and rush off
the edge,” Harbaugh said.
Michael Thomas, an athlete
from Texas, will also add depth to
the defense. Thomas played quar
terback in high school, but projects
as either a wide receiver or corner
back in college Harbaugh felt
he’d fit best as a defensive back.
“He’s another guy who could be
a three-way guy,” he said.
The Cardinal even upgraded its
special teams by signing punter
Daniel Zychlinski. With Jay Ot
tovegio graduating, Harbaugh said
that Zychlinski “has a very good
chance of being the starting punter
next year.”
“We understand the game of
field position and how big a part
the punter plays in that. We feel
like he is a guy who can help us in
that area,” said special teams coach
D.J. Durkin.
With such an impressive class
coming in, Harbaugh was left with
nothing more than to state the ob
vious.
“Stanford got better today,” he
said. “It was a wonderful day.”
