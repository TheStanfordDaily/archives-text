# Who will fill the shoes left by last season's team?

### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
There will be more than a cou
ple high profile position bat
tles and storylines in spring
football practice. Which com
bination of running backs will
replace Toby Gerhart? Who will take
over for Chris Marinelli, the anchor of
the prolific offensive line? Will Owen
Marecic make a successful switch to
linebacker?
Those questions will linger for
months and rightfully so but oth
ers obviously exist. Here are some
under-the-radar positions and person
nel to keep an eye on throughout the
off-season.
Fullback
Both head coach Jim Harbaugh and
defensive coordinator Vic Fangio ap
pear dedicated to giving Marecic every
opportunity to show that he is capable of
being a starting linebacker. He will work
predominantly on the defensive side of
the ball during spring practice, and if he
succeeds, will play both ways in the fall.
But Harbaugh and Fangio were quick to
note that he can’t be in on all offensive
snaps if he’s playing a major role on de
fense. This frees up a chance for another
Cardinal athlete to get playing time at
fullback.
The backup role is a major vacancy.
Josh Catron, who subbed in at times in
2009, has used all of his eligibility. Liam
McNally and Andrew Fowler have left
the team. Along with Marecic, they were
the only four fullbacks on last year’s ros
ter, and even then, Fowler was more of a
long snapper than anything else.
There appear to be two main op
tions: freshmen Geoff Meinken and
Ryan Hewitt. Meinken, a former line
backer, has been switched to fullback on
Stanford’s spring roster; however, he is
still rehabbing a tom ACL suffered in
the early fall, and will not participate in
either of the two spring sessions. That
opens the door for Hewitt, listed at tight
end, who associate head coach Greg
Roman said could play an H-Back role.
Given the potential loss of the bruising
Marecic for a number of plays per game,
in addition to the hole left by Gerhart,
Roman acknowledged that Stanford
may shift from a power running team to
a more open offense where a traditional
fullback is not as necessary.

Starting and Backup Tight End
Outside of and perhaps even includ
ing running back, there is no position
with more candidates and less certainty
than tight end. With Jim Dray gone,
there is no incumbent starter. Coby
Fleener and Konard Reuland were the
second and third tight ends, respectively,
last year, but the 2009 recruiting class
brought in a serious amount of talent at
the position. With six players, three
depth chart spots and effectively clean

slates, the different combinations are
numerous.
Joining Fleener and Reuland in the
hunt are Zach Ertz, Hewitt, Jordan Naj
var and Levine Toilolo. As stated, He
witt may wind up at H-Back, which
would put him in a separate category,
and Roman and defensive line coach
Randy Hart are fighting for the services
of the six-foot-eight Toilolo, so he may
also change positions.
Part of the debate depends on which
direction the Cardinal goes with its of
fense. Fleener and Ertz are big receiving
threats who would spend much of their
time split out wide and wouldn’t have
the same in-line responsibilities of a tra

ditional tight end like Dray; Reuland,
Najvar and Toilolo could fill that role.
Roman inquired about acquiring a crys
tal ball when he was asked to discuss the
position. That seems apt.

Backup Quarterback
Tavita Pritchard is gone and one of
the more important reserve roles is sub
sequently vacant. Stanford has three op
tions on its current roster: Alex Loukas,
Robbie Picazo and Josh Nunes. The
highly-regarded Brett Nottingham joins
the crew in the summer.
Loukas, best known for his heroics in
the 2008 homecoming game against
Arizona, and wildcat role for the rest of
that season, missed all of 2009 with an
ACL tear. Besides starter Andrew
Luck, he’s the only other passer with ex
perience, with 20 passing attempts and
36 rushes to his name. But, as will be ex
plained momentarily, he may not even

be a quarterback this year.
Nunes was a four-star recruit last sea
son and third on the depth chart, but Pi
cazo, a walk on, was impressive in prac
tice throughout the year. The Holly
wood storylines write themselves.

Alex Loukas
Loukas is the player to watch this
spring, coming in slightly ahead of
Marecic and Toilolo, because of the
sheer number of positions where he
can wind up. Given his natural athleti
cism, Harbaugh wants to ensure that
Loukas finds a spot on the field. That
may be as a wildcat quarterback, but
with Luck at the helm, that doesn’t ap
pear to be anything more than a gim
micky role.
So where else? Loukas worked at re
ceiver in spring practice last year and ex
celled at times before tearing his ACL in
late March even with limited experi-

ence at the position, he still found ways
to accelerate past defensive backs. Re
ceiver may even be too broad of a term.
He could factor in as a wide out,H-Back
or tight end in a Fleener-like capacity.
But the most intriguing option is safety,
which Loukas has never played. Both
Fangio and secondary coach Derek
Mason are enthralled by Loukas’s po
tential in the defensive backfield, and
Harbaugh allowed for the possibility
that he could be an opening day starter
there, even going so far as to compare
him to Stanford great John Lynch, who
converted to safety, too.
“We want to take this opportunity in the
spring to see what his best position is,”
Harbaugh said.“He’s just a multi-talent
ed guy.”
