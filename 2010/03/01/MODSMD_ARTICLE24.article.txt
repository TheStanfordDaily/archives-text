# Who will fill the shoes left by last season's team?

There will be more than a cou
ple high profile position bat
tles and storylines in spring
football practice. Which com
bination of running backs will
replace Toby Gerhart? Who will take
over for Chris Marinelli, the anchor of
the prolific offensive line? Will Owen
Marecic make a successful switch to
linebacker?
Those questions will linger for
months and rightfully so but oth
ers obviously exist. Here are some
under-the-radar positions and person
nel to keep an eye on throughout the
off-season.
Fullback
Both head coach Jim Harbaugh and
defensive coordinator Vic Fangio ap
pear dedicated to giving Marecic every
opportunity to show that he is capable of
being a starting linebacker. He will work
predominantly on the defensive side of
the ball during spring practice, and if he
succeeds, will play both ways in the fall.
But Harbaugh and Fangio were quick to
note that he can’t be in on all offensive
snaps if he’s playing a major role on de
fense. This frees up a chance for another
Cardinal athlete to get playing time at
fullback.
The backup role is a major vacancy.
Josh Catron, who subbed in at times in
2009, has used all of his eligibility. Liam
McNally and Andrew Fowler have left
the team. Along with Marecic, they were
the only four fullbacks on last year’s ros
ter, and even then, Fowler was more of a
long snapper than anything else.
There appear to be two main op
tions: freshmen Geoff Meinken and
Ryan Hewitt. Meinken, a former line
backer, has been switched to fullback on
Stanford’s spring roster; however, he is
still rehabbing a tom ACL suffered in
the early fall, and will not participate in
either of the two spring sessions. That
opens the door for Hewitt, listed at tight
end, who associate head coach Greg
Roman said could play an H-Back role.
Given the potential loss of the bruising
Marecic for a number of plays per game,
in addition to the hole left by Gerhart,
Roman acknowledged that Stanford
may shift from a power running team to
a more open offense where a traditional
fullback is not as necessary.

Starting and Backup Tight End
Outside of and perhaps even includ
ing running back, there is no position
with more candidates and less certainty
than tight end. With Jim Dray gone,
there is no incumbent starter. Coby
Fleener and Konard Reuland were the
second and third tight ends, respectively,
last year, but the 2009 recruiting class
brought in a serious amount of talent at
the position. With six players, three
depth chart spots and effectively clean
