## Profs push for more foreign lit. English major occupies key role in the study of other cultures and languages 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A group of Stanford professors
are pushing to increase the
University’s focus on foreign lan
guage and culture, and leading the
charge is French & Italian professor
Dan Edelstein.
For students interested in com
bining their study of English with
that of other national literatures, the
department offers a major track
with an emphasis in foreign lan
guage literature. This emphasis
allows students to count up to four
upper division foreign literature
courses toward the major.
Only four of the 155 declared
English majors are on this track.
In a Feb. 16 editorial entitled
“Gerrymandering the Canon” on
the Inside Higher Ed. Web site,
Edelstein lamented the categoriza
tion of literary studies by nationality
and argued that such partitioning
leaves English majors with an
incomplete understanding of liter
ary history.
“Given that English is the natural
home for literary-minded students
who are not proficient in another
language, it is depressing that they
can graduate from college with the
implicit assumption that literature is
the prerogative of the English
speaking peoples, an habeas corpus
of the arts,” Edelstein wrote in the
piece.
Professor Jennifer Summit, chair
of the English department, corre
sponded with Edelstein while he
was writing the piece and seconded
his view that the modern universi
ty’s emphasis on specialization often
comes at the expense of a well
rounded knowledge base.
“Dan's article raises a larger
question we face any time we
declare academic specialization,”
Summit said. “To specialize is to
focus, but that deep focus needs to
come from a context of broad
focus.”
The English department plans to
address the question of “broad
focus” with its new set of major
requirements, to be instituted this
spring quarter and effective 2010-
11. According to Katie
Dooling, the Undergraduate
Student Services Coordinator for
the department, the new curriculum
introduces a team-taught, three
quarter core sequence that will sur
vey literature in English from the
Middle Ages to the present. In addi
tion, the major will require three
courses in methodology; poetry, nar
rative, and method.
Blair Laing TO, a creative writing
major, refutes the accusation that
the field of English literature is one
exclusively preoccupied with work
written in English. Laing, who plans
to attend graduate school, recently

took the Graduate Record
Examination (GRE) in English
Literature and said it covered a vari
ety of English and non-English
works.
“For the GRE, you have to know
classics, Greek mythology, transla
tions of Middle English, as well as
foreign authors like Neruda,
Flaubert and Kafka,” Laing said.
She also pointed out the logisti
cal issues that would arise from an
attempt to fuse English and foreign
literatures at the undergraduate
level.
“The problem is, who would be
qualified to teach these classes [on
foreign literature]?” Laing said.
“For example, it doesn’t serve the
French department to teach classes
on French literature in English. And
English professors aren’t specialized
in French literature. If English and
French professors team up, [the
class] becomes more of a general
humanities course, like an ILIUM.”
Another option for literary
minded students with worldly inter
ests is pursuing a major in the com

parative literature department,
emphasizing the critical and cultural
analysis of national literatures.
Christina Ho ‘lO considered major
ing in English before ultimately
deciding on Comp Lit. She said the
two majors offer two different but
equally valid perspectives on
English literature.
“You can gain a certain type of
understanding of English literature
by focusing only on the literature
that is, what’s on the page,” Ho said.
“You can gain an equally important
aspect by looking at the effects of
other cultures and literatures on
English Lit. After all, English litera
ture is the literature of a particular
culture.”
Professor Nicholas Jenkins,
director of undergraduate studies
for the English Department, argued
that the divide between English and
foreign texts grows increasingly
blurry in the case of American liter
ature, as the culture of the United
States is one composed of countless
ethnic and cultural traditions.
“When we think of foreign litera

ture, we think of literature outside
the United States,” Jenkins said.
“But there’s a lot of internal diversi
ty within the US. If a Cuban immi
grant to America writes a novel in
Spanish, I think that’s part of
American literature.”
However, even the staunchest
advocates of foreign literature
acknowledge the practical limita
tions of studying texts in multiple
languages. Edelstein listed steps that
he believes Stanford can take to
encourage exploration of foreign lit
erature, such as increasing the lan
guage requirement for all students
to two years.
“In an ideal world, we would all
speak 10 languages and have 20
ye.ars to read the canon of literature
of every country,” Edelstein said.
“I’m not an absolutist. I think
there’s room for reading works in
translation otherwise none of us
would read anything in Russian or
Japanese or. for me, Spanish.”
