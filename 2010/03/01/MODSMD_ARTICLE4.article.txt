# Santiago program hit by quake
## Hundreds dead in Chile after 8.8 magnitude earthquake; all 21 Stanford students safe 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
Less than two days after a magnitude 8.8
earthquake rocked Chile, Chris Rurik ‘ll
sat in a small cafe in the nation’s capital and
glanced out across the once bustling streets
and parks.
“This is the quietest I’ve ever seen the
streets and parks of Santiago,” he said. “I
can see less than fifteen people from where
I’m sitting. Normally I’d be able to see hun
dreds just in this little area of the park.”
It’s the calm after the proverbial storm.
At 3:34 a.m. local time on Saturday, an 8.8-
magnitude earthquake the fifth-largest
quake ever recorded struck off the coast
of Chile, forcing President Michelle
Bachelet to declare a “state of catastrophe.”
Yesterday the Chilean government
announced the death toll had risen to 708.
The quake has also displaced more than two
million people across the country.
Rurik was one of 21 Stanford students in
the Chilean capital with the Bing Overseas
Program (BOSP). He was asleep in his host
family’s apartment when the quake struck
and rumbled for a minute and a half.
When the shaking stopped, he said he
immediately took to the streets with his host
mother and brother to search for the fami
ly’s relatives, who could not be contacted
because electricity and telephone lines had
been knocked out. Rurik’s host family’s
grandmother was later located.
Charles Zaffaroni TO thought that the
earthquake was just one of the mild tremors
that Chile experienced “every week.”
“We’ve experienced a whole bunch of
earthquakes since we’ve been here and it
started out like that too, so I thought I could
sleep through it,” he said. “But then it really
started shaking and everything fell of the
shelves and I started to get to the doorway.”
Santiago, 200 miles from the quake’s epi
center, sustained serious damage from the
quake, with local media reporting that
about 12 people had died. State officials
announced that three hospitals in the
Chilean capital had been affected, while the
Santiago airport was partially opened yes
terday despite damage to a passenger termi
nal.
Rurik also reported damage to two local

apartment buildings in his area that were
“on the verge of collapse” and that the
Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, the city’s
fine arts museum, was also in “bad shape.”
Further south, however, closer to the
quake’s epicenter, the damage was much
worse. Collapsed bridges, flattened homes
and overturned cars were just some of the
many images illustrating the awesome
power of the quake, which Greg Beroza, a
Stanford geophysics professor, estimated to
be 500 times stronger than the earthquake
that devastated Haiti last month.
In Concepcion, Chile’s second-largest
city 70 miles from the epicenter, apartment
buildings were ripped apart and rescuers
are still trying to pull people from the rub
ble, the Associated Press reported Sunday.

Looters had also taken to the streets,
reportedly taking everything from canned
milk to microwave ovens those desperate
for food and water combining with those
trying to take advantage of the chaos.
Bachalet said the majority of the deaths
nearly 550 had occurred in the Maule
region, adjacent to the province where
Concepcion is.
Fortunately, no Stanford students or fac
ulty had gone farther south than Santiago
for the weekend. According to Ivan Jaksic,
the director of the Bing program in Chile, a
group of 13 had traveled north to La Cerena
for the weekend, while the remaining stu
dents stayed in Santiago.
Jaksic, who was “overwhelmed” by the
quake while sleeping in his 16th-floor apart

ment, explained that while the city was with
out power for several hours, well-crafted
emergency plans allowed the program to
contact all its staff and faculty as soon as
electricity was restored. By Saturday after
noon, the University was able to contact and
account for all students and faculty in Chile.
Before contact had been established,
however, Rurik, Zaffaroni and Alyssa
Baldocchi ‘ll, speaking over Skype less
than 16 hours after the quake struck,
expressed their concern that one student,
Lyla Johnston ‘ll, had gone south to do
research for her senior thesis. It was later
affirmed that Johnston had stayed in
