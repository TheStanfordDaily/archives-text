# Santiago program hit by quake
## Hundreds dead in Chile after 8.8 magnitude earthquake; all 21 Stanford students safe 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
Less than two days after a magnitude 8.8
earthquake rocked Chile, Chris Rurik ‘ll
sat in a small cafe in the nation’s capital and
glanced out across the once bustling streets
and parks.
“This is the quietest I’ve ever seen the
streets and parks of Santiago,” he said. “I
can see less than fifteen people from where
I’m sitting. Normally I’d be able to see hun
dreds just in this little area of the park.”
It’s the calm after the proverbial storm.
At 3:34 a.m. local time on Saturday, an 8.8-
magnitude earthquake the fifth-largest
quake ever recorded struck off the coast
of Chile, forcing President Michelle
Bachelet to declare a “state of catastrophe.”
Yesterday the Chilean government
announced the death toll had risen to 708.
The quake has also displaced more than two
million people across the country.
Rurik was one of 21 Stanford students in
the Chilean capital with the Bing Overseas
Program (BOSP). He was asleep in his host
family’s apartment when the quake struck
and rumbled for a minute and a half.
When the shaking stopped, he said he
immediately took to the streets with his host
mother and brother to search for the fami
ly’s relatives, who could not be contacted
because electricity and telephone lines had
been knocked out. Rurik’s host family’s
grandmother was later located.
Charles Zaffaroni TO thought that the
earthquake was just one of the mild tremors
that Chile experienced “every week.”
“We’ve experienced a whole bunch of
earthquakes since we’ve been here and it
started out like that too, so I thought I could
sleep through it,” he said. “But then it really
started shaking and everything fell of the
shelves and I started to get to the doorway.”
Santiago, 200 miles from the quake’s epi
center, sustained serious damage from the
quake, with local media reporting that
about 12 people had died. State officials
announced that three hospitals in the
Chilean capital had been affected, while the
Santiago airport was partially opened yes
terday despite damage to a passenger termi
nal.
Rurik also reported damage to two local

apartment buildings in his area that were
“on the verge of collapse” and that the
Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, the city’s
fine arts museum, was also in “bad shape.”
Further south, however, closer to the
quake’s epicenter, the damage was much
worse. Collapsed bridges, flattened homes
and overturned cars were just some of the
many images illustrating the awesome
power of the quake, which Greg Beroza, a
Stanford geophysics professor, estimated to
be 500 times stronger than the earthquake
that devastated Haiti last month.
In Concepcion, Chile’s second-largest
city 70 miles from the epicenter, apartment
buildings were ripped apart and rescuers
are still trying to pull people from the rub
ble, the Associated Press reported Sunday.

Looters had also taken to the streets,
reportedly taking everything from canned
milk to microwave ovens those desperate
for food and water combining with those
trying to take advantage of the chaos.
Bachalet said the majority of the deaths
nearly 550 had occurred in the Maule
region, adjacent to the province where
Concepcion is.
Fortunately, no Stanford students or fac
ulty had gone farther south than Santiago
for the weekend. According to Ivan Jaksic,
the director of the Bing program in Chile, a
group of 13 had traveled north to La Cerena
for the weekend, while the remaining stu
dents stayed in Santiago.
Jaksic, who was “overwhelmed” by the
quake while sleeping in his 16th-floor apart

ment, explained that while the city was with
out power for several hours, well-crafted
emergency plans allowed the program to
contact all its staff and faculty as soon as
electricity was restored. By Saturday after
noon, the University was able to contact and
account for all students and faculty in Chile.
Before contact had been established,
however, Rurik, Zaffaroni and Alyssa
Baldocchi ‘ll, speaking over Skype less
than 16 hours after the quake struck,
expressed their concern that one student,
Lyla Johnston ‘ll, had gone south to do
research for her senior thesis. It was later
affirmed that Johnston had stayed in

The apartment of Stanford student Chris Rurik '11 in Chile's capital, Santiago, following an earthquake this weekend. Measured at 8.8 on the Richter
Scale, the event is the fifth-largest earthquake ever recorded, and caused unrest, loss of life and property damage throughout the country.
Santiago for the weekend, suffer
ing injuries after jumping from her
third-floor balcony to escape her
building during the quake.
According to a Facebook post
relayed by Rurik, Johnston is in the
hospital “in good spirits” but with
pelvis and vertebrae injuries.
No other injuries were reported
among Stanford students or faculty.
The Stanford facilities in Santiago
sustained minimal damage, accord
ing to Jaksic.
The earthquake, however, did
provide a major scare for those
involved. Resident faculty member
and Freeman Spogli consulting pro
fessor Thomas Fingar had experi
enced quakes in California and
Taiwan, but none “this strong or of
such duration.”
“Our fourth floor apartment
was pitching and rolling like a
small boat in rough seas,” he wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily, then
went on to describe how he and his
wife, Orlene, hung on to one
another while standing in a hall
way doorframe. His apartment sus
tained minimal damage from the
quake and the two were able to
escape unharmed.
While the main risk has passed,
much of Chile lies in a state of ruin
as aftershocks continue to shake the
nation. The US. Geological Survey
reported that at least 90 significant
aftershocks those that register a
magnitude greater than 4.0 on the
Richter scale had occurred since
the original earthquake.
Rurik was driven from his bed
yesterday by one such aftershock.
“This morning at about 8:30 I
was woken by probably the
strongest aftershock yet,” he said. “I
was out of bed, into my pants and
ready to run in record time. But it
didn’t last very long.”
The large amount of seismic
activity, while surprising at first, is
not particularly uncommon to
Chile, said Beroza, who is the
deputy director of the Southern
California Earthquake Center.
“Chile is one of the world’s most
active seismic zones, where the
Nazca Plate is running into the
South American plate,” he said.
In 1960 a magnitude 9.5 earth
quake, the largest ever recorded,
occurred off the coast of Chile,

causing a tsunami that killed about
200 people in Japan some 22 hours
after the initial disaster. An 8.1-
magnitude earthquake also hit
Chile in 1985.
While the earthquakes seemed
evenly spaced in a span of 25 years,
Beroza saw little connection in the
timing of the quakes.
“I don’t read into any of that at
all,” he said. “Other than they have
a lot of very big earthquakes.”
Norm Sleep, a geophysics pro
fessor, believed that Saturday’s
earthquake could have been relat
ed to a similar quake that Charles
Darwin witnessed in 1835 on his
documented trips to South
America. He said that “strain and
quake threat have been building up
on [the] fault and waiting to hap
pen” since that occurrence and esti
mated that “10 meters of slip in a
matter of minutes” was the main
reason for the quake.
Another concern for scientists
throughout Saturday was the possi
ble tsunamis triggered by the
earth’s movement Saturday.
Warnings from Hawaii to Russia
went out warning residents near the
coasts to prepare themselves and
find higher ground.
While waves led to at least four
dead and 11 missing on islands off
of Chile, evacuation efforts in other
areas proved to be mere precau
tionary measures. Wave heights did
not reach the expected levels; in
Half Moon Bay, Calif., the 18-inch
change in water height at low tide
led to little noticeable difference,
according to Sleep.
Back in Chile, however, the
country will be left trying to pick up
the pieces as small tremors contin
ue to cause unrest. Aid has been
offered from the United Nations
and President Obama has pledged
the United States’ support to the
South American nation.
On campus, several South
American student groups have
banded together to create the Web
site www.stanfordchile.org, where a
percent of proceeds will be donated
to relief services in Chile.
For the students in Santiago,
however, it is a matter of restoring
their everyday lives as the quarter
comes to a close.
“Tomorrow we go to school like
normal,” Rurik said. “Hopefully
stores will start to re-open and life
in the city will return to normal.”

relayed by Rurik, Johnston is in the
hospital “in good spirits” but with
pelvis and vertebrae injuries.
No other injuries were reported
among Stanford students or faculty.
The Stanford facilities in Santiago
sustained minimal damage, accord
ing to Jaksic.
The earthquake, however, did
provide a major scare for those
involved. Resident faculty member
and Freeman Spogli consulting pro
fessor Thomas Fingar had experi
enced quakes in California and
Taiwan, but none “this strong or of
such duration.”
“Our fourth floor apartment
was pitching and rolling like a
small boat in rough seas,” he wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily, then
went on to describe how he and his
wife, Orlene, hung on to one
another while standing in a hall
way doorframe. His apartment sus
tained minimal damage from the
quake and the two were able to
escape unharmed.
While the main risk has passed,
much of Chile lies in a state of ruin
as aftershocks continue to shake the
nation. The US. Geological Survey
reported that at least 90 significant
aftershocks those that register a
magnitude greater than 4.0 on the
Richter scale had occurred since
the original earthquake.
Rurik was driven from his bed
yesterday by one such aftershock.
“This morning at about 8:30 I
was woken by probably the
strongest aftershock yet,” he said. “I
was out of bed, into my pants and
ready to run in record time. But it
didn’t last very long.”
The large amount of seismic
activity, while surprising at first, is
not particularly uncommon to
Chile, said Beroza, who is the
deputy director of the Southern
California Earthquake Center.
“Chile is one of the world’s most
active seismic zones, where the
Nazca Plate is running into the
South American plate,” he said.
In 1960 a magnitude 9.5 earth
quake, the largest ever recorded,
occurred off the coast of Chile,

causing a tsunami that killed about
200 people in Japan some 22 hours
after the initial disaster. An 8.1-
magnitude earthquake also hit
Chile in 1985.
While the earthquakes seemed
evenly spaced in a span of 25 years,
Beroza saw little connection in the
timing of the quakes.
“I don’t read into any of that at
all,” he said. “Other than they have
a lot of very big earthquakes.”
Norm Sleep, a geophysics pro
fessor, believed that Saturday’s
earthquake could have been relat
ed to a similar quake that Charles
Darwin witnessed in 1835 on his
documented trips to South
America. He said that “strain and
quake threat have been building up
on [the] fault and waiting to hap
pen” since that occurrence and esti
mated that “10 meters of slip in a
matter of minutes” was the main
reason for the quake.
Another concern for scientists
throughout Saturday was the possi
ble tsunamis triggered by the
earth’s movement Saturday.
Warnings from Hawaii to Russia
went out warning residents near the
coasts to prepare themselves and
find higher ground.
While waves led to at least four
dead and 11 missing on islands off
of Chile, evacuation efforts in other
areas proved to be mere precau
tionary measures. Wave heights did
not reach the expected levels; in
Half Moon Bay, Calif., the 18-inch
change in water height at low tide
led to little noticeable difference,
according to Sleep.
Back in Chile, however, the
country will be left trying to pick up
the pieces as small tremors contin
ue to cause unrest. Aid has been
offered from the United Nations
and President Obama has pledged
the United States’ support to the
South American nation.
On campus, several South
American student groups have
banded together to create the Web
site www.stanfordchile.org, where a
percent of proceeds will be donated
to relief services in Chile.
For the students in Santiago,
however, it is a matter of restoring
their everyday lives as the quarter
comes to a close.
“Tomorrow we go to school like
normal,” Rurik said. “Hopefully
stores will start to re-open and life
in the city will return to normal.”

Less than two days after a magnitude 8.8
earthquake rocked Chile, Chris Rurik ‘ll
sat in a small cafe in the nation’s capital and
glanced out across the once bustling streets
and parks.
“This is the quietest I’ve ever seen the
streets and parks of Santiago,” he said. “I
can see less than fifteen people from where
I’m sitting. Normally I’d be able to see hun
dreds just in this little area of the park.”
It’s the calm after the proverbial storm.
At 3:34 a.m. local time on Saturday, an 8.8-
magnitude earthquake the fifth-largest
quake ever recorded struck off the coast
of Chile, forcing President Michelle
Bachelet to declare a “state of catastrophe.”
Yesterday the Chilean government
announced the death toll had risen to 708.
The quake has also displaced more than two
million people across the country.
Rurik was one of 21 Stanford students in
the Chilean capital with the Bing Overseas
Program (BOSP). He was asleep in his host
family’s apartment when the quake struck
and rumbled for a minute and a half.
When the shaking stopped, he said he
immediately took to the streets with his host
mother and brother to search for the fami
ly’s relatives, who could not be contacted
because electricity and telephone lines had
been knocked out. Rurik’s host family’s
grandmother was later located.
Charles Zaffaroni TO thought that the
earthquake was just one of the mild tremors
that Chile experienced “every week.”
“We’ve experienced a whole bunch of
earthquakes since we’ve been here and it
started out like that too, so I thought I could
sleep through it,” he said. “But then it really
started shaking and everything fell of the
shelves and I started to get to the doorway.”
Santiago, 200 miles from the quake’s epi
center, sustained serious damage from the
quake, with local media reporting that
about 12 people had died. State officials
announced that three hospitals in the
Chilean capital had been affected, while the
Santiago airport was partially opened yes
terday despite damage to a passenger termi
nal.
Rurik also reported damage to two local

apartment buildings in his area that were
“on the verge of collapse” and that the
Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, the city’s
fine arts museum, was also in “bad shape.”
Further south, however, closer to the
quake’s epicenter, the damage was much
worse. Collapsed bridges, flattened homes
and overturned cars were just some of the
many images illustrating the awesome
power of the quake, which Greg Beroza, a
Stanford geophysics professor, estimated to
be 500 times stronger than the earthquake
that devastated Haiti last month.
In Concepcion, Chile’s second-largest
city 70 miles from the epicenter, apartment
buildings were ripped apart and rescuers
are still trying to pull people from the rub
ble, the Associated Press reported Sunday.

Looters had also taken to the streets,
reportedly taking everything from canned
milk to microwave ovens those desperate
for food and water combining with those
trying to take advantage of the chaos.
Bachalet said the majority of the deaths
nearly 550 had occurred in the Maule
region, adjacent to the province where
Concepcion is.
Fortunately, no Stanford students or fac
ulty had gone farther south than Santiago
for the weekend. According to Ivan Jaksic,
the director of the Bing program in Chile, a
group of 13 had traveled north to La Cerena
for the weekend, while the remaining stu
dents stayed in Santiago.
Jaksic, who was “overwhelmed” by the
quake while sleeping in his 16th-floor apart

ment, explained that while the city was with
out power for several hours, well-crafted
emergency plans allowed the program to
contact all its staff and faculty as soon as
electricity was restored. By Saturday after
noon, the University was able to contact and
account for all students and faculty in Chile.
Before contact had been established,
however, Rurik, Zaffaroni and Alyssa
Baldocchi ‘ll, speaking over Skype less
than 16 hours after the quake struck,
expressed their concern that one student,
Lyla Johnston ‘ll, had gone south to do
research for her senior thesis. It was later
affirmed that Johnston had stayed in
