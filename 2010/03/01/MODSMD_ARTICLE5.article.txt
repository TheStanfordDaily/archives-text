# Families visit the Farm
## Parents’ Weekend wraps up with success 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
A record 3,300 people from approximately
1,500 families registered to attend a partly rainy
Parents’ Weekend, which ended Saturday.
Provost John Etchemendy kicked off the
annual Parents’ Weekend Friday morning with a
welcome to parents and family members, fol
lowed by an afternoon question and answer ses
sion, in which he addressed questions about the
recent raise in tuition for the 2010-2011 school
year.
The most noticeable change to this year’s
event was in its promotion: in an effort to be
more sustainable, the Web site was redesigned, e
mail invitations were sent and parents could only
register online. More than 1,000 parents regis
tered online within 48 hours after receiving
notice of the early registration system, according
to the University.
Also new this year was a resource fair,
designed to give parents the opportunity to
speak with staff members from the various stu
dent resources available on campus.
Representatives of institutions from Vaden to
the Stanford Quad Yearbook were available on
Saturday morning to answer parents’ questions.
Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL, wrote on
Twitter on Saturday: “Enjoying last day of
Stanford Parents’ Weekend — while listening to
Hawaii tsunami updates.” Case’s daughter,
Annie, is a freshman here.
The event ended Saturday with the
“Entertainment Extravaganzawhich featured
performances from student a capella groups,
Stanford Wushu and others. Proceeds from the
tickets sold to the entertainment event will ben
efit the Parents’ Club Scholarship Endowment
Fund, which provides scholarships for Stanford
students.
