## STUNTIN' IS A HABIT 
### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What would you do to be Tree?
Would you eat a live snake? Bathe in diluted
acid? Get shot with a .45 caliber bullet while
wearing a bulletproof vest, of course?
Past tree hopefuls have, in fact, done all of the
above.
Legend has it that prior to the establishment of a
formal selection process in the 1980s, the Band man
ager’s girlfriend assumed the role of Tree. Nowadays,
the Tree is an awfully coveted position at Stanford
despite its frequent appearances on “top ten worst
mascot” lists. With the exception of prohibited stunts
that involve hospital visits or breaking the law, candi
dates go to all extremes in the hopes of securing the
title of the LSJUMB’s official and the
University’s unofficial mascot.
At the end of Tree Week last Thursday, Ben
“Bollox” Cortes T1 emerged victorious as next
year’s Tree. His stunts consisted of drawing his own
blood to mix a Bloody Mary, playing ACDC’s
“Thunderstruck” on the roof of the “Band Shak” and
reciting “The Devil Went Down to Georgia” after
inhaling helium.
“I want stunts to be something I would have a rel
atively good time doing,” Cortes said.
Cortes’ Tree tryouts from last year didn’t hurt his
chances either. For one stunt, he curled up inside the
Band’s bass drum while fellow Band members
played four or five songs on top of him.
“Within about 30 seconds, it instantly starts to fog
up with sweat in there and you can’t really see in,”
remembered Patrick “Patches” Fortune TO, who was
Tree in 2008-2009. “Every mallet hit that came down,
you can hear a little ‘squeak, squeak, squeak’ [com
ing from Cortes].”
Fortune undertook more of a blood-and-flesh
approach to his Tree stunts. His favorite stunt was
riding through an egg and water balloon firing range
six times. He ended up bleeding in several places
and received a black eye.
“Adrenaline is probably my favorite drug,”
Fortune admitted. “I mean, really, you don’t feel too
much. A black eye just feels like somebody kissed
you.”
Despite the blacks and blues, Fortune has a high
opinion of Tree Week’s ability to bring out the most
daring traits in a Tree candidate.
“Even if I hadn’t gotten Tree, Tree tryouts are still
worth it,” he said. “Tree tryouts are my favorite time
every year [even though] I no longer get to be Tree.
It’s still so much fun to see what people can do, see
what you yourself can do and really challenge your
self to be what you think you can.”
Fortune’s predecessor, John Whipple TO, boasted
about the tradition-establishing stunt he initiated as
a “sapling.”
“I hosted the first but not last annual K-Y Jelly
contest in White Plaza,” he said of the wrestling
match, which involves the Johnson & Johnson brand
water-soluble personal lubricant. “It’s been running
three years strong now. It’s pretty fun. It’s good for
the skin.”
Perhaps Whipple’s most infamous stunt, however,
was branding a tree shape on his back using leech
es.
“I got nine leeches to represent the nine Pac-10
challengers, put them in the shape of a tree and left
them on my back for a while,” explained Whipple.
“There’s this little ringlet scar.”
Before Whipple, Tommy Leep ‘O7, the 2006-2007
Tree, also had a penchant for the dangerous in his
tryouts. His first and most well known stunt upped
the risk of bodily harm from leeches and bruises to
an exponentially higher level: he went skydiving.
Tree Week back in Leep’s days occurred during
fall quarter rather than winter quarter. Taking advan
tage of football season and his roommate’s training
as a flight pilot, Leep “leaped” out of a plane over
the Stadium at halftime. Part of the stunt was to
remove his parachute, take off his clothes and then
put the parachute back on all while mid-air.
“It’s pretty frightening when you’re holding onto
a parachute with just five fingers,” Leep acknowl
edged.
Once safely on the ground. Leep had to deal with
the additional complication of evading arrest.

Language for the good of all

“ Before the game we had dug a
tunnel under the stadium, so as the
cops were running, I ran over and
disappeared under the field,” he
said. “How else are you going to get
out of the stadium naked?”
No doubt such stunts as these

amplify the excitement surround
ing the Tree-choosing process. Yet,
when all’s said and done, what
matters is not which candidate ral
lies the most popular support, but
who can best impress the current
Tree.
Jonathan “Shu-Fry” Strange Tl,
who will step down as Tree at the
end of the school year, noted that
stunts do not necessarily indicate a
sapling’s potential as Tree.
Incidentally, Strange’s most notori

ous stunt consisted of constructing
and occupying a life-sized bowling
ball and rolling himself into a clus
ter of kegs.
“You could potentially get Tree
without stunts,” Strange said point
blank. “It’s just that stunts are away
of showing your personality, and we
want to see someone that’s awe
some.”
