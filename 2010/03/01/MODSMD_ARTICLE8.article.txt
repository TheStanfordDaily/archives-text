# A TREE IS BORN

### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
You've probably seen his face before,
even if you didn't remember it. As an
employee in the Media and Microtext base
ment area of Green Library. Ben "Bollox”
Cortes ‘ll is one of the many mild-mannered
guys who waits patiently for you to hand
them a call number before heading into the
back and fetching your DVD.
Today, though, there are some hints to his
new identity.
His neck and his arms are tinged green
with remnants of paint from his initiation,

‘‘Sprout Night.” the night before. His left
forearm is blotted with a huge bruise near
the crook of his elbow a watercolor of
purple and dark green.
“Yeah ... it does not look good.” Cortes
admitted, speaking slowly and deliberately
as he glanced down at the wound. It bears
witness to the stunt he pulled last week dur
ing which he drew his own blood and drank
it mixed with vodka and lemon juice as
a “bloody” Mary.
This stunt, a handful of others, and a cou
ple interviews all of which happened in
the past two weeks have raised Cortes
from a member of the Band’s drum-line to

the illustrious status of the Band’s mascot,
the Tree.
But despite his new claim to fame
there’s even a Wikipedia list of Trees past
and present Cortes remains humble. A
few students filed into the Media center to
check out DVDs and after finding out that
Cortes clinched the title, made little bows
and said jokingly, “We’re in the presence of
royalty.” Cortes just laughed quietly.
“I don’t even know exactly what it was
that made me win,” he said later. The selec
tion process, he admits, is still mostly
unknown to him. The process, officially led
by the current Tree and a few select Band

managers, is and has always been shrouded
in mystery.
“I really just tried to show that I was
ready to bleed for Tree,” he said with a laugh.
“Have fun that’s my modus operand!. I’m
just gonna enjoy it.”
For Cortes, “having fun” included a wide
variety of stunts throughout Tree Week. He
turned himself into a human pi?ata and
hung, with packs of candy on his body, from
the birdcage in White Plaza. Another stunt
included friends dressed up as zombies and
another who hid raw meat under his shirt,
later to be ripped out in a gruesome attack.
He also had planned a wrestling match

between Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny,
but that fell through which, as he noted,
stunts sometimes do.
A good stunt, Cortes said, should have “a
degree of theatricality and a sense of
humor,” but more importantly, a quality of
“irreverence.” He expressed admiration for
stunts that required intense preparation
such as current Tree Jonathan “Shu-Fry”
Strange ‘ll and the human bowling ball he
built last year as well as those that were
handled on the fly. He jokingly noted that
Tree hopeful Robbie Zimbroff ‘l2 and his
