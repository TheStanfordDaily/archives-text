## Dumpster Diving 
### ADAM COLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Julie Muir lifted a soiled coffee cup
from the folds of a garbage bag and
held it up like a wine connoisseur
appraising a glass of merlot. Around
her, a handful of students wearing lab
coats and thick rubber-coated gloves await
ed her decision.
"You see, now this one this one is
compostable," Muir said, flicking the cup
into a bin marked "Organics."
On Friday morning, a small group of
students and staff joined Muir, Stanford's
recycling program manager, for Stanford's
18th waste audit in a corner of Peninsula
Sanitary Services Center lot. They ripped
open dozens of trash bags taken from the
History Corner, and painstakingly sorted
contents into labeled bins, looking for
items that could be recycled, reused or
composted.
"A crucial step in waste management
and reducing our waste is seeing the actual
outcomes of recycling and compost pro
grams," said Lucy Litvak 'll, a member of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS)
who attended the event.

Matt Roth, Stanford Dining's
Sustainable Foods Coordinator, has attend
ed six such audits since he was hired last
year.

"The real value of doing these waste
audits is that you get a firsthand experience
to see where our trash is going and what it's
comprised of," Roth said.
Over the course of the morning, as trucks
screeched in and out of the lot, Roth and the
other sorters filled several garbage cans
with waste that should have made it into
recycling or compost bins. Miguel San Pedro
'l2, another SSS member who joined in the
audit, was not surprised.
"Oftentimes we tend to ignore that cer
tain things are recyclable or compostable, or
we just forget, or we're lazy," he said.
Muir said that a typical load of Stanford
trash is 30 percent compostable and 20 per
cent recyclable.
"If we can get rid of that," she said, "we
can literally halve our waste."
Thomas Fenner, deputy general counsel,
who works in the History Corner and
served on the Sustainable Working Group,
stopped by to see how his building was
doing. Fenner recently helped put a recy
cling bin at every desk in the History
Corner's offices.

"My guess is that that will increase the
percentage of recycling and reduce the
waste," he said.
Muir agreed that this is an easily attain
able goal.
"Paper, bottles and cans, that's not the
hard stuff, it's not the stuff that should take
a lot of thinking," she said. "Organics is
harder, because we're not used to that as a
society."
The contents of the bags before her
reflected this naivete.
"Unfortunately there were a lot of
organic materials inside the garbage,"
Litvak said. "If we hadn't sorted through
the garbage, these organics, which will now
go to the compost, will just go to the land
fill."
"It's almost heartbreaking to see that
we've actually spent more money to buy
these compostable items, investing in this
program," Roth said, gesturing with a take
out box. "It's a shame, but it speaks to the
challenge we have in educating our cus
tomers to do the right things."
Roth, Muir and the sorting students are
already moving to meet this challenge. SSS
recently organized compost workshops at
Tresidder. Purin Phanichphant, a graduate
student in product design who attended the

*' » •
audit, is working on a project to redesign
Stanford's waste bins.
"One thing that we did last year was to
petition Jamba Juice to not use styrofoam,
just as a result of looking at Stanford's waste
stream," said Theo Gibbs 'll, who helped
organize the very first waste audit her fresh
man year. "Students keep coming out and
learning about it."
"Everyone who does this gets educated
about the complexity of process," Muir
added, citing the educational awareness that
the audits promote.
The sorters are anxious to pass this edu
cation on.

"The biggest challenge is getting [con
sumers] to put stuff in the right place," Roth
said as he pulled the last few soda cans from
his garbage bag. "It's clear from today that
we have an opportunity to definitely
improve what we're doing."
"There are a lot of pieces that we are
missing answers for but that doesn't mean
we stand still and wait," Muir added. "We
have to do our part, and all of these little
steps will create this closed loop system that
we're trying to get to."
