In "Global warming may inflate
food prices" (Feb. 26), The Daily
incorrectly reported that the dele
gation to Copenhagen was led by
Stephen Schneider and Karim
Farhat. In fact, the delegation was
led by Stephen Schneider and Terry
Root, a senior fellow at the Woods
Institute for the Environment.
Farhat was a participant in the dele
gation and spoke at a Feb. 24 panel
alongside Schneider.
