## EDITORIAL STAMP opens discussion of body image on campus 
### 
It may not seem like a revolutionary idea
to give Stanford students a voice. As an
outgoing, opinionated population, doing
so may even seem redundant. Stanford The
atre Activist Mobilization Project
(S.T. A.M.P), however, used the "Mirror Mir
ror" monologue production this past week
end to give voice to the body image issues of
Stanford students that often go unheard and
many times unnoticed. The striking nature of
the monologues written anonymously by
Stanford students and performed by actors
brought to light male, female and trans
gender body image concerns that simmer be
neath our campus culture. In an environ
ment, academic and social, that contains
varying degrees of perfectionism, it is not sur
prising that these issues arise and then subse
quently are never voiced.
"Mirror Mirror" exposed a raw side of
Stanford many of us do not want to see in our
selves or in our peers. Issues we all know about,
such as anorexia and bulimia, were presented,
as well as image issues that fit no classification
other than overwhelming sense of self-doubt.
"Mirror Mirror" tells a story of promise, how
ever, in the presentation of a panel to discuss
the issue, which unveiled a platform from
which campus discussion can grow. One of the
main points of this platform was that students
on campus must express their concerns when
they see their friends risking their own health
solely to improve their body images.
Many people try to follow, as best they

can, the clich?d statement that "everyone is
beautiful in their own unique way." But say
ing such adages does not mean we as humans
will change how we perceive and judge those
around us, or even ourselves. In an environ
ment where we honor open discussion and
diversity, many students still remain complic
it in society's control of body image and the
idealization of the human form. While Stan
ford certainly does not live outside the values
and ideals of the rest of the world, the Edito
rial Board would like to think that the aver
age Stanford student has a more enlightened
sense of health and beauty than the staff of
Us Magazine.
Stanford provides a multitude of re
sources for those who are experiencing body
image issues, from Vaden's counseling and
support groups to the Bridge Peer Network.
But like most of the revolutionary ideas that
sweep campus, change has to start with us,
Stanford students. It is hard to break one's
own negative body image or combat a disor
der. It is hard to navigate a difficult conversa
tion with that friend you know needs help.
But the hardest thing may be changing the
way we see our peers, judging them for who
they are and not by how they look.
S.T.A.M.P. has begun this important discus
sion by giving voice to these issues and the
Editorial Board hopes the campus will follow
suit to break the cycle of body image issues
and a culture of body perfectionism that can
take hold of us all.
