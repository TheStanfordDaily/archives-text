There are a few lessons taught to all stu
dents at Stanford, regardless of major,
interests or lectures attended. Apart
from the more routine epiphanies that most
of us eventually experience (such as "Palo
Alto is too damn far to walk" or "last night's
drunken euphoria is equal in magnitude to
this morning's physical agony"), one assured
lesson is "searching for a job is miserable."
The phrase "job market" is a cute euphe
mism for an experience categorically oppo
site to that of actually browsing a market.
"Job war zone" or "Job game park" would
more accurately reflect the brutal nature of
marketing oneself repeatedly to different
firms. Happily, I ran across an article some
time ago with advice for the savvy job seeker
looking to differentiate themselves from
hordes of qualified candidates. The piece, "5
Ways to Take Control of Your Personal
Brand Today" by Dan Schawbel, introduced
an interesting concept highly lauded by job
market experts: your name is your personal
brand.
The idea behind this is not that people
should be incentivized to submit copyright
applications for their birth certificates.
Rather, it is that viewing oneself as a brand is
an appropriate mentality when laboring
through the job search process. In an age
where seemingly limitless information about
us is available through multiple mediums, it is
necessary for us to envision our names as
logos. These logos need to be both promoted
(as the Stanford Tree candidates recently dis
covered) and defended (as Tiger Woods is
currently realizing ouch). Fortunately,
there are many great tools that allow people
to engage in both self-aggrandizement and
damage control, whether they are supple
menting their resumes with letters of recom
mendation from their mothers or convincing
their cereal sponsors to forget about that on
line photo of them hitting a bong.
The article emphasized five central steps
for taking control of one's brand. The first is
claiming a Google Profile. A Google Profile
is a personal summary that allows people to
link all their relevant information to one
page, which can be used as a "base." Two
added advantages to using this feature are a)
that the service is free and b) that it shows up
automatically on the first page of results in a
Google name search.
Another method of brand control is re
serving one's name on all available social
networks. Envision the disappointment on
the face of all those similarly named to you,
as they discover that you have preempted
their efforts to enlist at obscure peer-to-peer
websites! Clearly, dispersing your presence
throughout multiple such networks will
make you a more attractive candidate. To see
if your name has already been reserved on all
the major sites, use the aptly named
www.namechk.com.
Another useful tip is the establishment of
a personal hub. Using domain-hosting servic
es or simple format websites such as
www.nombray.com, you can list all your rele
vant qualifications in one easy-to-navigate
page, much like a Google Profile. This way,

you can pick and choose between what infor
mation you wish to present to (and obscure
from) your prospective employer. By adding
the website address to your resume, you can
immediately direct attention toward the arti
cle of you saving that young boy from drown
ing in The Claw and away from that video of
you in Cancun that you'd hoped would not
surface on the Internet.

All of this is meant to develop a pictur
esque revisionist history that presents only
the more palatable aspects of your brand to
your potential recruiters. A Linkedln profile
(www.linkedin.com) can display a glowing
recommendation from that professor you
worked with for a month, while making no
mention of that summer you spent referring
to yourself as The Situation and experiment
ing with perpetual drunkenness. For the at
tention-deficit set and those unversed in pro
fessional vernacular, www.twtjobs.com pro
vides the opportunity to summarize your re
sume in 140 characters, bypassing the excru
ciating boredom associated with reading a
full page of bullet points.
The lesson here is that the period of our
lives where our full name was irrelevant (out
side of filling out speeding tickets) is over.
Each job applicant in the modern world of
competitive employment-seekers requires a
reputation management strategy. The best
way to supervise and moderate one's presen
tation to the outside world is to conceive of
oneself as a brand. That way, should disaster
strike, you will stand poised to successfully
navigate the treacherous straits of reputa
tional defense. So what does your brand say
about you?

This column seems to alternate between social
networking and heavy-handed moral philoso
phy. What will next week's column bring? Ask
