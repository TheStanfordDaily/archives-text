# INNOVATE AMERICA
## The 						Biggest Speaker of the Year 
### Teryn Norris 
A big event is happening on campus
next week that every Stanford stu
dent should know about. On Monday,
Mar. 8, U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu
will deliver a speech in Memorial Auditori
um about clean energy innovation and edu
cation, exclusive for the Stanford communi
ty, followed by a special expert panel called
"Educating the Energy Generation."
This is an event you do not want to miss, so
if you have class, skip it and recruit the rest of
your classmates. Dr. Chu is one of the most
important government officials in the world.
He is overseeing the Department of Energy
during the most critical time for energy poli
cy in U.S. history, and the work of this depart
ment may truly shape our future more than
any other area of government today.
Dr. Chu is pretty much the rock star of
government officials. It is not just his position
as America's energy guru, or that he is the
first Nobel Laureate appointed to the Cabi
net. No, the coolest thing about Dr. Chu is
that he is basically America's nerd-in-chief,
and he is the first to say so. In his Harvard
commencement speech last year, Chu com
pared himself to past speaker Bill Gates:
"Today, you have me. I am not a billionaire,
but at least I am a nerd."
But beyond his place as nerd-in-chief,
there are three reasons why Secretary Chu
offers a critical perspective and inspirational
message that we should all listen to on Mon
day. (For the purpose of full disclosure, I co
wrote the invitation that brought him to cam
pus.)
First, Dr. Chu is a strong and vocal sup
porter of clean energy who understands that
energy and climate change are most funda
mentally challenges of science and technolo
gy innovation. "In this revolution, there will
be no single magical discovery that will res
cue us," he told the Caltech Class of 2009. "A

price on carbon, energy efficiency standards
and other policy mechanisms are necessary
tools to align technology directions with en
vironmental necessities. However, it is sci
ence and innovation that will provide the
path forward."
Dr. Chu is not afraid to publicly challenge
the idea that "we have all the technologies we
need" to solve these problems. As a world
renowned scientist, Chu gets the innovation
imperative better than just about anyone.
Speaking in 2008, he noted, "Another myth is
we have all the technologies we need to solve
the energy challenge. It's only a matter of po
litical will. I think political will is absolutely
necessary [...] but we need new technologies
to transform the landscape." According to
Dr. Chu, Nobel-level energy breakthroughs
are required in at least three areas, including
electric batteries, solar power and the devel
opment of new crops for fuel.
Second, contrary to the myths espoused
by many libertarian economists, Dr. Chu
understands the importance of federal in
vestment to advance technology innova
tion. In 2009 testimony before the Senate,
Chu stated, "Our previous investments in
science led to the birth of the semiconduc
tor, computer and biotechnology industries
that have added greatly to our economic
prosperity. Now, we need similar break
throughs on energy. We're already taking

steps in the right direction, but we need to
do more."
Indeed, the federal government played a
pivotal role in developing a range of tech
nologies that drove a significant portion of
U.S. economic growth over the past 50 years,
secured our competitiveness in the Cold War
and improved the lives of ordinary Ameri
cans and people across the world. That is why
we need a major increase in the federal budg
et for clean energy innovation today and why
Dr. Chu's position is so important.
Finally, Dr. Chu believes in the power of
young people and wants to inspire and sup
port us to meet these challenges. That is why
the Department of Energy has proposed the
nation's first comprehensive federal initia
tive for clean energy education, called RE
ENERGYSE, which would invest tens of
millions of dollars per year in energy educa
tion programs. RE-ENERGYSE is an im
portant initiative for our generation, and
Stanford students are leading a national ef
fort this year to advance the proposal in Con
gress.
"This is truly the scientific and engineer
ing challenge of our time," Dr. Chu recently
said in a speech at Google. "Scientists and en
gineers have come to our nation's aid in
times of need before, and it is time to do so
again. I'm calling on all of America's young
scientists and researchers to consider tack
ling this challenge. The stakes could not be
higher. Great ideas have transformed our
world before. But the great ideas on energy
might do more than just change our world;
they might help save it."
