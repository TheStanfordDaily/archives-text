## Life is short: Lessons from the Chilean Quake 
### LYLA JOHNSTON'11 Student with Bing Overseas Program in Santiago, Chile 
Sometimes you just feel it. All day long
before the quake hit, I felt something
coming. Of course, I didn't act on it or
stow myself away in a bomb shelter. I just laid
my head down for the night in my 12-story
apartment complex.
Sure enough, as I began to dream, the bed
began to shake slowly at first, but more vi
olent by the second. I jumped up and ran out
of the room. My host-mother let out a scream.
I decided I should go out on the balcony, that
it might be safer. But there were nine more
concrete balconies above ours so that seemed
like a bad idea. I ran back in and yelled for my
host-family. Meanwhile, the shaking began to
get more powerful. I could tell it was a big one.
I ran back to the balcony and looked over the
edge. It was a pretty far drop, but I wanted
more than anything to be out of that building.
The whole damn city was shaking. I climbed
onto the ledge. The streetlights were bursting.
Car alarms were sounding. I looked up at my
building and it was just swaying away. It was
about to fall. On the rumbling ledge I won
dered, is it better to jump all that ways (40
feet) or get my face squished under nine floors

of concrete? A long ways down... but better
sorry than dead, I always say. So I jumped.
Obviously, I'm not very well trained in
earthquake procedures. Doesn't everyone
jump off the balcony? I don't remember
what it was like falling. But I sure as hell re
member what it was like hitting the ground.
It hurt about 250 times more than I was ex
pecting it too. I cried out in anguish, still too
close to the shuttering building. I rolled away
from it until the earth stood still. I was pretty
sure I had broken my back. When I arrived at
the hospital, I had a lot of company. It was
4:20 AM and everyone was aching and
groaning. Amidst all the suffering I began to
reflect. I thought of how the Chilean police
force is shooting the Mapuche people down
during their peaceful protests. I though of Is
rael and the Arab states. I thought of how I
had not yet forgiven my friend for what she
did to me. I thought of all the wars in the
world, big and small. They seemed so pathet
ic. I looked across to a woman who was also
in a stretcher. She was having a really, really
hard time. I felt so much love for her and I
was so happy to be alive. The chorus of an old

Beatles song climbed up inside me and I sang
it out, "Life is very short and there's no time
for fussing and fighting, my friend."
Turns out I didn't break my back, just frac
tured it. I also got a few bonus fractures in the
pelvis. Won't be walking for a while. As I
write, I'm in a hospital bed. All day long the
room shakes with the aftershocks. I am at the
mercy of plate tectonics and I feel more alive
than ever. I'd like to say to all of you that life
is very short. Live it. Take a look at what you
are studying; make sure it's what you love.
Take time to forgive and move on to more
important things. You never know what day
will be your last. For God's sake, don't spend
this beautiful and sacred life arguing with
others. Spend this time wisely. Spend it joy
ously and-at the risk of sounding like a star
ry-eyed hippie love your brothers and sis
ters. There's not much time left to do it. I love
you all. Big shout out to all my homies on the
fizzy. Please know I am in very good hands.
