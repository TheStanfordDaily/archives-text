# Sex: A mutually beneficial relationship

In an opinion column on Friday, Feb. 26,
Yanran Lu argued that our "puritanical"
sex culture was encouraging women to re
main passive victims in the face of male sex
ual exploitation. A well-written column that
explores sex issues certainly does have a
place in a college newspaper, but that is not
what this, nor any other of Yanran's articles,
have been. Her columns are supposedly de
signed to "sexually liberate" women. While
this is clearly a good intention, the means
with which she seeks to support this aim are
demeaning and hurtful to our male peers, at

Stanford as a whole.
The relentless theme of Yanran's articles

is one of domination. Are there men who are
guilty of committing the crimes that she at
tributes to them? Of course. Are they the ma

know are very concerned about being nice,
respectful and treating the women in their
lives with care and integrity. Yanran charac

crazed monsters who don't give a damn
about women and need to be beaten into
submission, literally. The message: screw men
over because men have screwed women
over.
Let's remember too that women are not
always innocent victims. We both have male
friends who have been manipulated and used

by women in an equally disgusting fashion.
Again, I believe that these women are in the
minority, but arguing that men are the only
perpetrators of these kinds of evils is mis
guided and damaging to the males who are in
equally disruptive relationships. Further
more, women have and should exercise some
agency; we are disturbed by the degree to
which Yanran wants to portray them as vic
tims. We are adults, and we should conduct
ourselves as such. Even if her characteriza
tion of men did apply to the vast majority,
which we strongly disagree with, there is no
reason why women should act like five-year-
