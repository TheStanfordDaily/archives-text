# Sex: A mutually beneficial relationship
## 
### MICHAEL ALBADA '10 HEATHER BUCKELEW '10 
In an opinion column on Friday, Feb. 26,
Yanran Lu argued that our "puritanical"
sex culture was encouraging women to re
main passive victims in the face of male sex
ual exploitation. A well-written column that
explores sex issues certainly does have a
place in a college newspaper, but that is not
what this, nor any other of Yanran's articles,
have been. Her columns are supposedly de
signed to "sexually liberate" women. While
this is clearly a good intention, the means
with which she seeks to support this aim are
demeaning and hurtful to our male peers, at
best, and damaging to sexual relations at
Stanford as a whole.
The relentless theme of Yanran's articles

is one of domination. Are there men who are
guilty of committing the crimes that she at
tributes to them? Of course. Are they the ma
jority? Hardly. The vast majority of men we
know are very concerned about being nice,
respectful and treating the women in their
lives with care and integrity. Yanran charac
terizes men as nothing more than selfish, sex
crazed monsters who don't give a damn
about women and need to be beaten into
submission, literally. The message: screw men
over because men have screwed women
over.
Let's remember too that women are not
always innocent victims. We both have male
friends who have been manipulated and used

by women in an equally disgusting fashion.
Again, I believe that these women are in the
minority, but arguing that men are the only
perpetrators of these kinds of evils is mis
guided and damaging to the males who are in
equally disruptive relationships. Further
more, women have and should exercise some
agency; we are disturbed by the degree to
which Yanran wants to portray them as vic
tims. We are adults, and we should conduct
ourselves as such. Even if her characteriza
tion of men did apply to the vast majority,
which we strongly disagree with, there is no
reason why women should act like five-year-
olds and return the favor.
Yanran's articles never deal with
equal exchange based on love,
friendship or even basic mutual re
spect. They are about conquest and
revenge. This is not a healthy stan
dard to promote, and while we think
it's her personal business if that is
how Yanran chooses to relate to sex,
we would appreciate if she didn't
proselytize her values to the entire
campus. In the online comments sec
tion, some readers have called Yan
ran brave for her articles. Talking
about sex and relationships is hardly
revolutionary, and talking about
them in away that encourages the
sexes to engage in a battle for su
premacy and domination is not only
lacking in bravery, but is also damag
ing to the campus culture. If Yanran
truly wanted to be brave, she would
write about sex in away that encour
ages mutual respect rather than one
in which the sexes are constantly at
odds with each other.

Being a feminist should not be
about hating or demeaning men. It
should be about celebrating the
strengths of women and building a
better, more equal future for our
children. Just as we would never
want our daughters to be discrimi

nated against, we also don't want our
sons to suffer that same fate. In the
name of our children, some of whom
will likely be male, we want to stand
for a world and a culture that equal
ly respects both men and women,
and does not continue a petty game
of competition between the sexes.
Most Stanford men are compassion
ate individuals who have been raised
to champion equal rights for their fe
male peers.
We would appreciate if Yanran
would see fit to move past the brand
of feminism that hates men and
enter into the 21st century, which we
hope will move towards a future
that values the contributions of both
genders. This kind of vile portrayal
of sexual and love dynamics is exact
ly part of the problem in reinforcing
existing stereotypes of competing
genders, rather than any kind of love
that is based on mutual respect and
trust. If not love, we should at least
support sexual interactions that are
based on a mutually beneficial phys
ical and emotional exchange, rather
than an insecure, selfish attempt to
one-up each other in some sick com
petition. Yanran's articles may be
sensational, but they are far from
representative of campus culture
and norms, much less from present
ing healthy attitudes towards sexu
ality.
