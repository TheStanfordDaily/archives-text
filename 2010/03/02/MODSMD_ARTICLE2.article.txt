rhis week, The Daily will be running
a series on Stanford's four under
graduate class years across multiple
issues: Todays issue contains part one of
this series and is focused on freshmen.
Wednesday's series will be on sopho
mores, Thursday's on juniors and Friday's
on seniors.
On each day, there will be a feature on the
experience of students in that class year, and
a news story examining an aspect of cam
pus life that affects students in all years
and that class year especially.
(RAs). For 1,692 students, the Stanford
experience had begun.
"I remember that John Hennessey was
there and I didn't know who he was," laughed
Alexandra Dorda 'l3, a Eucalipto resident
from Warsaw, Poland. "We shook hands. Now
I realize he's like a really big deal."
On this same day of lugging heavy boxes
and tearful goodbyes, the new freshmen
were also faced with a nerve-racking intro
duction — coming face-to-face for the first
time with a new roommate.
"I knew kids who were living in the same
dorm as me who I met at Admit Weekend, so
I was just hoping that it would work out,"
said Anteneh Daniels 'l3, who lives in

Ujamaa. "And then I met my roommate and
he was a pretty cool guy. So I think that all
of my fears were kind of put away within
like fifteen minutes of moving in."
Just as these new friendships began to
flourish and the sights and sounds of a new
home started to make sense, the fountain
hopping and summer camp-like atmosphere
of New Student Orientation abruptly faded
into the sudden rigor of 10-week quarters
a marked shift in pace for many students.
"I think [the quarter system] is kind of
crazy," said Karen Shen 'l3, an Alondra res
ident. "I actually like it a lot because I get
tired of my classes really easily. But then
these next three weeks with midterms again
and then dead week and then finals is kind
of bad. There are definitely times where I'm
just like, these people are insane."
But it was not merely the speed of the
quarter system that some freshmen had
trouble adapting to academically. Others
quickly realized that their classes at
Stanford were more demanding and chal
lenging than their high school courses, and
were unfamiliar with the concept of a "B+".
"I have had so many points where I have
been about to break down because this is
just way different for me and it's so much
work I guess," said Monique Atkinson 'l3,
who lives in Eucalipto. "High school seems
so much easier now that I think about it."

For the student-athlete, even more
pressed for time than the average Stanford

freshman, these academic challenges are
even more pronounced.
"It's difficult, but I manage to do it pret
ty well," said Andy Brown 'l3, a member of
the men's basketball team and a Soto resi
dent. "It's just hard because we have set
practice times every day. You just have to
schedule and manage your time properly
with homework and other classes."

In conjunction with this accelerated
schedule and a more challenging course
load, many freshmen were faced with anoth
er situation completely foreign to them
they no longer shone in their classes and
extracurricular activities with the same ease
that they did in high school.
"The biggest challenge I faced was main
taining a sense of self-worth amidst a group
of people who have already accomplished so
much in their lives," said Aditya Singh 'l3,
another student living in Alondra who went
to high school in Singapore, but calls India
home. "Getting used to living the life of rel
ative mediocrity after being a high-school
star student for so long."
Dean of Freshmen and Undergraduate
Advising Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9 has wit
nessed thousands of students dealing with
these same struggles to adapt to life at
Stanford. Her biggest piece of advice to
freshmen is to actively seek out help when
the going gets tough.
"If things start to get difficult, as they
sometimes do, get some support from the
innumerable resources around you," said
Julie Lythcott-Haims, Dean of Freshman
and Undergraduate Advising. "You aren't
meant to go through it alone, but you have
to take the first step."
For example, students may find solace in
their supportive RAs and close-knit dorm

communities.
"I love living in a freshman dorm," said
Junipero resident Robin Perani 'l3. "You
always have a community ... it's a really
good way to have kind of a base while
you're trying out all these other things
because if things go wrong you can always
come back to J-Ro, and if things go right,
then everyone is really, really happy for
you."
Once this base has been established and
all things Stanford flow more smoothly,
social life begins to bloom and the first
years can begin to let their hair down. Many
discover the perks of college independence
and the new social scene that comes as a
result.
"We live in a four-year dorm, and there
aren't very many people that go out on our
floor," Dorda said of her and roommate
Atkinson. "So we're kind of known as the
party girls. We go over to East Campus a lot
to hang out, [as well as] the frats. Most of our
social life revolves around the other side of
campus."
For some, the abundance of new faces
and activities can lead to unexpected flings.
However, not all new connections are built
to last.
"It's relatively easier to get into a rela
tionship with people because, I mean, there
won't be another time when we're around so
many singles of our own peer group at any
other point in our lives," Singh said. "But
from my personal experience, it's easy to get
into a relationship, but not easy to get into a
relationship with the right person."
Others find security in long-distance con
nections with high school partners.
Although the miles often prevail, those that
maintain their relationships believe that the

distance is healthy and beneficial.
"I thought it was going to be a lot harder
than it was, but I like it," Shen said. "It's
actually really nice because I like having
someone to talk to from home. It kind of
keeps me grounded, and it doesn't interfere
too much."
Between academics, social life and other
commitments, freshmen may also find that
their sleep schedules require major revision.
"I think first quarter it was hard to adapt
to getting a lot less sleep," said Kyle
Anderson 'l3, a Trancos resident. "Just going
from getting your seven, maybe eight hours
a night in high school, and cutting that back
to five or six on a regular basis took a little
bit of adapting."
Amid all the adjustments, freshmen also
have highlights during the year, ranging
from the dorm scavenger hunt in San
Francisco to the Mausoleum Party on
Halloween to maybe taking an
Introductory Seminar. Others cited the
small pleasures of everyday life at college.
"Getting thrown in the shower by my
dorm was super awesome," Perani said.
"Playing games late at night and drinking
tea and watching movies. Really, like any
thing there are just so many fun things to
do."
And challenges aside, the freshmen
expressed general pleasure with their lives
on the Farm.
"I didn't think I would like it here at all,"
Dorda admitted. "But I am just so much
happier here than anywhere else. Whenever
I'm somewhere else I just want to come
back."

rhis week, The Daily will be running
a series on Stanford's four under
graduate class years across multiple
issues: Todays issue contains part one of
this series and is focused on freshmen.
Wednesday's series will be on sopho
mores, Thursday's on juniors and Friday's
on seniors.
On each day, there will be a feature on the
experience of students in that class year, and
a news story examining an aspect of cam
pus life that affects students in all years
and that class year especially.
(RAs). For 1,692 students, the Stanford
experience had begun.
"I remember that John Hennessey was
there and I didn't know who he was," laughed
Alexandra Dorda 'l3, a Eucalipto resident
from Warsaw, Poland. "We shook hands. Now
I realize he's like a really big deal."
On this same day of lugging heavy boxes
and tearful goodbyes, the new freshmen
were also faced with a nerve-racking intro
duction — coming face-to-face for the first
time with a new roommate.
"I knew kids who were living in the same
dorm as me who I met at Admit Weekend, so
I was just hoping that it would work out,"
said Anteneh Daniels 'l3, who lives in

Ujamaa. "And then I met my roommate and
he was a pretty cool guy. So I think that all
of my fears were kind of put away within
like fifteen minutes of moving in."
Just as these new friendships began to
flourish and the sights and sounds of a new
home started to make sense, the fountain
hopping and summer camp-like atmosphere
of New Student Orientation abruptly faded
into the sudden rigor of 10-week quarters
a marked shift in pace for many students.
"I think [the quarter system] is kind of
crazy," said Karen Shen 'l3, an Alondra res
ident. "I actually like it a lot because I get
tired of my classes really easily. But then
these next three weeks with midterms again
and then dead week and then finals is kind
of bad. There are definitely times where I'm
just like, these people are insane."
But it was not merely the speed of the
quarter system that some freshmen had
trouble adapting to academically. Others
quickly realized that their classes at
Stanford were more demanding and chal
lenging than their high school courses, and
were unfamiliar with the concept of a "B+".
"I have had so many points where I have
been about to break down because this is
just way different for me and it's so much
work I guess," said Monique Atkinson 'l3,
who lives in Eucalipto. "High school seems
so much easier now that I think about it."

For the student-athlete, even more
pressed for time than the average Stanford

freshman, these academic challenges are
even more pronounced.
"It's difficult, but I manage to do it pret
ty well," said Andy Brown 'l3, a member of
the men's basketball team and a Soto resi
dent. "It's just hard because we have set
practice times every day. You just have to
schedule and manage your time properly
with homework and other classes."

In conjunction with this accelerated
schedule and a more challenging course
load, many freshmen were faced with anoth
er situation completely foreign to them
they no longer shone in their classes and
extracurricular activities with the same ease
that they did in high school.
"The biggest challenge I faced was main
taining a sense of self-worth amidst a group
of people who have already accomplished so
much in their lives," said Aditya Singh 'l3,
another student living in Alondra who went
to high school in Singapore, but calls India
home. "Getting used to living the life of rel
ative mediocrity after being a high-school
star student for so long."
Dean of Freshmen and Undergraduate
Advising Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9 has wit
nessed thousands of students dealing with
these same struggles to adapt to life at
Stanford. Her biggest piece of advice to
freshmen is to actively seek out help when
the going gets tough.
"If things start to get difficult, as they
sometimes do, get some support from the
innumerable resources around you," said
Julie Lythcott-Haims, Dean of Freshman
and Undergraduate Advising. "You aren't
meant to go through it alone, but you have
to take the first step."
For example, students may find solace in
their supportive RAs and close-knit dorm

communities.
"I love living in a freshman dorm," said
Junipero resident Robin Perani 'l3. "You
always have a community ... it's a really
good way to have kind of a base while
you're trying out all these other things
because if things go wrong you can always
come back to J-Ro, and if things go right,
then everyone is really, really happy for
you."
Once this base has been established and
all things Stanford flow more smoothly,
social life begins to bloom and the first
years can begin to let their hair down. Many
discover the perks of college independence
and the new social scene that comes as a
result.
"We live in a four-year dorm, and there
aren't very many people that go out on our
floor," Dorda said of her and roommate
Atkinson. "So we're kind of known as the
party girls. We go over to East Campus a lot
to hang out, [as well as] the frats. Most of our
social life revolves around the other side of
campus."
For some, the abundance of new faces
and activities can lead to unexpected flings.
However, not all new connections are built
to last.
"It's relatively easier to get into a rela
tionship with people because, I mean, there
won't be another time when we're around so
many singles of our own peer group at any
other point in our lives," Singh said. "But
from my personal experience, it's easy to get
into a relationship, but not easy to get into a
relationship with the right person."
Others find security in long-distance con
nections with high school partners.
Although the miles often prevail, those that
maintain their relationships believe that the

distance is healthy and beneficial.
"I thought it was going to be a lot harder
than it was, but I like it," Shen said. "It's
actually really nice because I like having
someone to talk to from home. It kind of
keeps me grounded, and it doesn't interfere
too much."
Between academics, social life and other
commitments, freshmen may also find that
their sleep schedules require major revision.
"I think first quarter it was hard to adapt
to getting a lot less sleep," said Kyle
Anderson 'l3, a Trancos resident. "Just going
from getting your seven, maybe eight hours
a night in high school, and cutting that back
to five or six on a regular basis took a little
bit of adapting."
Amid all the adjustments, freshmen also
have highlights during the year, ranging
from the dorm scavenger hunt in San
Francisco to the Mausoleum Party on
Halloween to maybe taking an
Introductory Seminar. Others cited the
small pleasures of everyday life at college.
"Getting thrown in the shower by my
dorm was super awesome," Perani said.
"Playing games late at night and drinking
tea and watching movies. Really, like any
thing there are just so many fun things to
do."
And challenges aside, the freshmen
expressed general pleasure with their lives
on the Farm.
"I didn't think I would like it here at all,"
Dorda admitted. "But I am just so much
happier here than anywhere else. Whenever
I'm somewhere else I just want to come
back."
