# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
This references "Military, acade
mia debate selective service", Feb
25. When I was close to my gradua
tion from college in the spring of
1955,1 was not among those deemed
competent for graduate school, and
being subject to the draft and a rela
tively clever fellow, I outwitted the
system and enlisted in the Army.
The draft, in experience, led to a
democratization of the enlisted
corps of the Army, there having
been many college graduates
among my fellow soldiers at the
Army Language School, many of
whom went on to distinguished ca
reers after their service. My present
view is that there should be some
form of selective service in which
everyone, men and women alike,
have to put in at least a couple of
years of service, either in the mili
tary or in civilian spheres of service.
Since General Steele mentioned
the question of values and since I
am at the moment going through
the most recent moral education
textbooks from the People's Repub
lic of China, it is clear that patriot
ism, or in Chinese, literally, "love of
country" is a major value being
taught and that studying and work
ing hard to achieve for the purpose
of contributing to the development
of China is presented as being a
manifestation of the virtue of love
of country.

Dear Editor,
I have witnessed heated conver

sation if not love-making in response
to Friday's sexploits, but Yanran
presents crucial areas of sexual
progress our campus needs.

1. Making us all feel included in awk
ward sex talks from an informed
professional.
Well-informed authorial decisions
come from thorough research, hope
fully extended in the future spon
sored by KY perhaps?
2. Teenage angst (hormone excess)
due to abstinence only education
simmers in our midst.
Bring on the sex! As our testosterone
and estrogen filled population would
cry.
3. Female empowerment
woohoo!
Equal rights for women? Always a
winner.
4. Bringing a taboo subject out of the
dark (specifically the stacks)
Now we wait for a column on "Cock
tails of Campus: Mix, Shake, and Stir
Yourself to a Better Social Life."
s."Ruin the moment for him! Since it
is ruined for you already!"
Or wait, "Be selfish, and give the gift
of orgasm to yourself today." I really
can't decide which to make my new
favorite quote on facebook.
6. Don't read Cosmo girls!
This column is free, especially if you
request a Special Fees refund from
the Daily, but I forgot to read that ed
itorial. Hmm...
7. Elevating journalistic practice too!
Bleeping of foul language in the col
umn? Point to Yanran.
8. We all prefer a sexual melodrama
to a well-rounded conversation
any day.
