## Fighting against injustice at Stanford 
### DAGEM MAMMO '10 
At Stanford, we fight the good fight on so
many fronts. Starry-eyed students champi
on a diversity of causes that range from
AIDS to sustainability to educational inequity with
efforts that target communities in Central Africa,
rural Ecuador and urban America. It seems that
only our soaring ambitions can match the audacity
with which we combat such intractable issues.
While this remarkable quality distinguishes us as
the world's future leaders, those same aspirations
produce a shortcoming: a tendency to overlook in
justices committed here on campus, which we per
ceive to be our slice of paradise. Our imbalanced
approach to addressing the disparities that plague
humanity leaves us uninformed about pressing
matters in our immediate surroundings. In fairness,
a triage system seems intuitively reasonable; con
sidering the systemic problems that destabilize the
developing world, why should we expend resources
and divert time to address our local community's
problems?

To answer such a difficult question, we invoke
Martin Luther King, who said, "An injustice any
where is an injustice everywhere." Earlier this quar
ter, a large contingent of the Stanford population
confronted an instance of local injustice. Two weeks
ago, janitorial servicing company ABM con
tracted by Stanford fired employee Karina
Reyes for using a Stanford computer to charge her
phone. Recognizing the contractor's decision as an
egregious overreaction, Karina's tutors from Habla

La Noche a program that teaches campus work
ers English contacted the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition to find some immediate recourse. As
we investigated the situation, we soon realized that
this was another classic case of worker abuse. For
over two years, Karina had demonstrated a sterling
ethic in her work and had received no complaints
from her managers. Also, the person whose com
puter Karina had used specifically requested that
she be reassigned to another part of campus and
not be terminated. Since Karina regularly sends re
mittances to support her single mother, ailing
brother and college-bound sister, we needed to act
swiftly to remedy this clear injustice.
To mobilize most effectively, we created an on
line petition, which garnered an incredible amount
of solidarity with over 1,600 signatures from vari
ous members of the Stanford community. Buoyed
by the unanticipated level of support, Karina was
ready to fight for reinstatement and back wages at
the mediation on Feb. 10. With union members, the
Stanford Asian American Activism Committee and
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition ready to
protest outside the ABM office, Karina struck a
deal that secured her position with benefits and
provided back pay for five of the nine days she
missed.

As has been documented on several occasions,
ABM capitalized on a trivial mistake in a blatant at
tempt to reduce costs through a vicious, two-part
cycle: firing senior employees that have rightfully

earned raises and replacing them with new labor at
lower wages. At an institution like Stanford, stu
dents, faculty and other community members can
not and should not ignore the gross incompetence,
naked injustice and chronic malpractice displayed
by ABM. While we continue to demand that ABM
follow Stanford's living wage policy and code of
conduct, we should also rethink our university's sys
tem of subcontracting that promotes cutting costs
on workers' ends in order to increase profit for
management. Under a system in which all Stanford
workers were hired in-house, Stanford would be
able to better monitor workers' treatment. Also,
cutting out the middleman would free funds to pay
workers fairly.

Equipped with a world-class education and a re
liable moral compass, Stanford activists, like alum
ni have demonstrated, may view the world as their
oyster. One of us could become the Supreme Court
justice that upholds a woman's right to privacy. One
of us could become the promising Newark mayor
that revitalizes a dying city. One of us could become
the advocate dedicated to the success of mentally
and physically impaired athletes worldwide. But
before we fulfill our lofty dreams, we have a respon
sibility as Stanford students, conscious of the con
stant tension between the powerful and the power
less, to rout the frequent labor abuses that persist as
unwanted weeds on our beloved farm.
