## Consider volunteering abroad during Spring Break 
### ALEXANDER NIXON '00 
Hola! Ten years ago I was a
Stanford undergraduate like
many of you! As to my future
and the choices ahead, I was over
whelmed; it was hard to step back
and see the bigger picture beyond
campus life.
One of the most valuable 'big pic
ture' opportunities I had while at
Stanford involved travel to other
countries. In Asia, the Caribbean,
and Europe, I thought about practi
cal applications of the knowledge I
was accumulating at school. More
over, in those new contexts, I began
to examine my education through
the lens of new cultures, values, and
practices.

The most illuminating contrast, of
course, was with the developing
countries I visited (Cuba, 1998, un
dergraduate. research grant). Visits
to Europe and Japan and other de
veloped nations were terrific, but ex
tended stays in poor countries really
opened my eyes.
Now, after having spent time in
Guatemala in the Peace Corps,
here's what I suggest as you think
about the next few years. Think
about doing something different for
your next vacation or spring break:
go to a poor country and volunteer
there for a week.

I remember having a conversa
tion with my freshman roommate
Parikshit Kundu, another SLE stu
dent living in Flo Mo. He was from
India and is probably somewhere on
his way to a Nobel Prize now. We
were discussing how to make the

world a better place. At one point he
asked me if I had ever actually seen
poverty, extreme poverty, face-to
face.

It was like getting hit in the head
with a Frisbee. My mom had been in
the Peace Corps in Togo, but what
did I really know about changing the
world or making a difference, if I had
never seen the world at its worst?

By submitting this piece to The
Daily I am appealing to your volun
teering instincts and hope some of
you might think about spending a
week in a place like Guatemala. It's a
great opportunity for working with a
cooperative of women and men cof
fee growers.
A few times a year the coffee
growers host a group of students for
a "Service-Learning Week." Student
home-stay with farmers, and choose
from a palette of coordinated activi
ties such as harvesting, processing.

tree planting, jewelry making. For me
this is a wonderful opportunity to ful
fill the Peace Corps goal of sharing
another culture with Americans.

Last year some students from the
Stanford Business School spent their
spring break learning about coffee. A
typical response was this: I don't
think I'll ever drink coffee the same
way again. What an education!" The
students left with a lasting under
standing of poverty, its complexity,
and innovative ways to alleviate it.
Indeed, poverty does not just
mean not having food or clean water
(though it certainly does mean that
too). It also means not having op
tions. Sure, you can throw a ton of aid
money at a poor country, but watch
and see that get gobbled up without
any long-term results. Sustainable
development requires commitment
to a community, and willingness to
shed your preconceived ideas and
listen to the needs of other people.
Volunteers have up-front, hands-on
lessons in patience and flexibility.
None of this can be learned in a col
lege textbook. It must be experi
enced.
Whether it's in Guatemala or any
other developing country, we are
needed! I encourage you to recon
sider plans for Cancun or Ft. Laud
erdale for spring break and volun
teer somewhere where you can see
how people live off of just $5 a day.
That's about what you spend every
day on coffee.

Reconsider plans for
Cancun or
Ft. Lauderdale for
spring break and
volunteer...
