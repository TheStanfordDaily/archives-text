## SENIORS FLY HIGH Card takes quad-meet, Ishino earns all-around victory 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sunday afternoon was an emo
tional time for the members of the
Stanford women's gymnastics team,
as they competed at home for the
final time this season and celebrated
five seniors who are nearing the ends
of their collegiate gymnastics ca
reers. Though head coach Kristen
Smyth used to introduce her gradu
ating class on Senior Day with a
hand-held microphone, she knew
that this year, emotions would make
the speeches difficult to get through.
So before this weekend's quad meet
victory, in which Stanford (11-2)
scored 196.525 points to beat North
Carolina (192.975), Eastern Michi
gan (190.125) and California
(188.825), Smyth used taped presen
tations to honor the seniors.
Nonetheless, the emotions were still
strong, and tears remained a part of
the tradition.

The team's seniors are Stephanie
Carter, Allyse Ishino, Carly Janiga,
Blair Ryland and Tenaya West, each
of whom played a key role in the
meet in true Senior Day fashion.
Ishino earned her first collegiate
all-around victory with a score of
39.450, winning the uneven bars
(9.875) and balance beam (9.825) in
addition to setting a personal best of
9.875 on the floor. TTie 2004 United
States Olympic Team alternate has
been an inspiration to her team
mates during her time at Stanford, as
she has bounced back from multiple
injuries to put together a stellar 2010
season. Ishino missed her entire
freshman year because of a pul
monary embolism, and torn liga
ments in her knee kept her out of
competition for most of last season.
But after overcoming these difficul
ties, this year she has helped provide
the Cardinal with a deeper lineup
and greater possibilities, especially
on the floor.

"She's really put it all together,"
Smyth said. "Just having her on all
four events is a real blessing, and to
do so as well as she has is phenome
nal. She has battled back time and
time again."
Ryland, a late replacement for
junior Shelley Alexander in the floor
exercise, scored a 9.875 to match her
collegiate career best and tie for

third with classmate West, who also
scored a season high. The senior
switched he\r tumbling passes so that
her one-and-a-half front layout was
her middle pass, and she finished
with a double pike dismount.
"We've been preparing for that all
year and she really rose to the occa
sion," Smyth said. "Doing a double
pike at the end takes a little bit more
endurance, and she was ready to re
veal that tonight."

Stanford's floor exercise as a
whole was impressive, and the team
scored at least 9.875 for each counta
ble routine, achieving a meet-high
score of 49.475. The Cardinal strug
gled a bit on the beam, however,
which has consistently been the
team's most difficult event.

"We're getting a little closer," said
Smyth. "What we're doing in meets
hasn't been what we've been doing in
practice. Once they put all four
events together, I don't see anyone
stopping this team. But we haven't
done it yet."

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women celebrat
ed their annual Senior Day with a big win
last weekend, downing a trio of opponents
in their final quad-meet of the season. Allyse
Ishino, one of the honored seniors, recorded
her first all-around victory as the Cardinal
took first place for the sixth time this year.

After being honored as a soon-to-be alumnus, senior Allyse Ishino, above, captured her first collegiate all-around
victory. The Santa Ana, Calif, native has proven dependable on the vault, bars and beam in her time with the Card.
Finally, Senior Day honored
Carter, an individual who has been
unable to compete since her fresh
man year because of an elbow injury.
Yet, she has remained a vital part of
the Stanford gymnastics program,
offering support to her teammates
and serving in the role of an extra
coach. Smyth became particularly
emotional while introducing Carter

to the crowd in Maples Pavilion.
"She's so connected with each in
dividual on the team," Smyth said.
"She knows exactly what to say to
them to bring out the best in them.
She's the one who's always there for
her teammates, whether they're sick
or injured. Any time day or night,
they go call her. She's really the an
chor, the glue that holds the team to
gether."
And she will continue to prove
her character for the final portion
of the season, as Stanford now
heads to nearby San Jose State to
compete in a tri-meet with the

Spartans (7-8) and rival California
(0-9) once again. The Card has al
ready handily defeated both teams
previously this year, edging San
Jose State 196.650-192.800 in early
February and California 196.525-
188.825 last weekend. Thus, the
meet is likely to provide an oppor
tunity for Stanford to focus on im
proving its own abilities as postsea
son competition nears.

do so as well as she has is phenome
nal. She has battled back time and
time again."
Ryland, a late replacement for
junior Shelley Alexander in the floor
exercise, scored a 9.875 to match her
collegiate career best and tie for

third with classmate West, who also
scored a season high. The senior
switched he\r tumbling passes so that
her one-and-a-half front layout was
her middle pass, and she finished
with a double pike dismount.
"We've been preparing for that all
year and she really rose to the occa
sion," Smyth said. "Doing a double
pike at the end takes a little bit more
endurance, and she was ready to re
veal that tonight."

Stanford's floor exercise as a
whole was impressive, and the team
scored at least 9.875 for each counta
ble routine, achieving a meet-high
score of 49.475. The Cardinal strug
gled a bit on the beam, however,
which has consistently been the
team's most difficult event.

"We're getting a little closer," said
Smyth. "What we're doing in meets
hasn't been what we've been doing in
practice. Once they put all four
events together, I don't see anyone
stopping this team. But we haven't
done it yet."

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women celebrat
ed their annual Senior Day with a big win
last weekend, downing a trio of opponents
in their final quad-meet of the season. Allyse
Ishino, one of the honored seniors, recorded
her first all-around victory as the Cardinal
took first place for the sixth time this year.

After being honored as a soon-to-be alumnus, senior Allyse Ishino, above, captured her first collegiate all-around
victory. The Santa Ana, Calif, native has proven dependable on the vault, bars and beam in her time with the Card.
Finally, Senior Day honored
Carter, an individual who has been
unable to compete since her fresh
man year because of an elbow injury.
Yet, she has remained a vital part of
the Stanford gymnastics program,
offering support to her teammates
and serving in the role of an extra
coach. Smyth became particularly
emotional while introducing Carter

to the crowd in Maples Pavilion.
"She's so connected with each in
dividual on the team," Smyth said.
"She knows exactly what to say to
them to bring out the best in them.
She's the one who's always there for
her teammates, whether they're sick
or injured. Any time day or night,
they go call her. She's really the an
chor, the glue that holds the team to
gether."
And she will continue to prove
her character for the final portion
of the season, as Stanford now
heads to nearby San Jose State to
compete in a tri-meet with the

Spartans (7-8) and rival California
(0-9) once again. The Card has al
ready handily defeated both teams
previously this year, edging San
Jose State 196.650-192.800 in early
February and California 196.525-
188.825 last weekend. Thus, the
meet is likely to provide an oppor
tunity for Stanford to focus on im
proving its own abilities as postsea
son competition nears.
Events begin at 7:00 p.m. on Fri
day night.
