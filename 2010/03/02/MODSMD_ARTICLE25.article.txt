## Sixth in Pac-10s, but one off to NCAAs 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After a four-month-long season, Stanford
wrestling opened the playoffs last weekend at
the Pac-10 Championship in Davis, Calif. De
spite its underwhelming conference record, the
Cardinal (10-8-1,2-4-1 Pac-10) looked to finish
among the conference's elite programs.
Instead, Stanford finished sixth out of eight
teams in the final standings. With 87 team points,
the Card trailed its next closest competitor, Cal
State Bakersfield, by 10 points and ended the

tournament 40 points behind conference cham
pion Oregon State.
"We never got hot," said head coach Jason
Borrelli. "Wrestling in a tournament like that,
you feed off of everyone's energy. We never had
a couple of guys win some big matches, where we
could really derive some energy and get it
going."
"For us, we might have a big win, then a guy
would lose," he continued. "We just couldn't get
hot and we couldn't get cycling where the ener
gy was really going amongst our team."
Though Stanford was unable to mount a

strong team effort, several Cardinal wrestlers
met with significant individual success.
Redshirt sophomore Nick Amuchastegui
took home his first Pac-10 title in the 165-pound
weight class, becoming the 12th conference
champion in Stanford's history. He took the title
with victories over Clayton Schulke of Cal State
Fullerton, Kyle Deberry of Arizona State and
second-seeded Dan Brascetta of Oregon State.
The final match was very closely contested, with
Amuchastegui pulling out a 2-1 decision over
