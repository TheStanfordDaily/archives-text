## Sixth in Pac-10s, but one off to NCAAs 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After a four-month-long season, Stanford
wrestling opened the playoffs last weekend at
the Pac-10 Championship in Davis, Calif. De
spite its underwhelming conference record, the
Cardinal (10-8-1,2-4-1 Pac-10) looked to finish
among the conference's elite programs.
Instead, Stanford finished sixth out of eight
teams in the final standings. With 87 team points,
the Card trailed its next closest competitor, Cal
State Bakersfield, by 10 points and ended the

tournament 40 points behind conference cham
pion Oregon State.
"We never got hot," said head coach Jason
Borrelli. "Wrestling in a tournament like that,
you feed off of everyone's energy. We never had
a couple of guys win some big matches, where we
could really derive some energy and get it
going."
"For us, we might have a big win, then a guy
would lose," he continued. "We just couldn't get
hot and we couldn't get cycling where the ener
gy was really going amongst our team."
Though Stanford was unable to mount a

strong team effort, several Cardinal wrestlers
met with significant individual success.
Redshirt sophomore Nick Amuchastegui
took home his first Pac-10 title in the 165-pound
weight class, becoming the 12th conference
champion in Stanford's history. He took the title
with victories over Clayton Schulke of Cal State
Fullerton, Kyle Deberry of Arizona State and
second-seeded Dan Brascetta of Oregon State.
The final match was very closely contested, with
Amuchastegui pulling out a 2-1 decision over

GAME NOTES: Stanford rounded up Pac-l 0 competi
tion with a sixth-place finish in the conference tour
nament last weekend, while Oregon State ended
up winning with 127.0 points. Cardinal sophomore
Nick Amuchastegui won the 165-pound title,
meaning that he'll have an automatic berth in the
NCAA Championships.
Brascetta.
Another strong performance came
from freshman Ryan Mango, who
placed third in the 125-pound weight
class. Despite losing by a technical fall
in his semifinal match against eventu
al champion Anthony Robles of Ari
zona State, the fifth-seeded Mango
bounced back to take third place. He
won three matches against higher
seeded opponents, including two wins
over fourth-seeded Andre Gonzalez
of Cal State Fullerton.
"I definitely knew I was capable,"
Mango said. "I had wrestled all of the
guys in the tournament, so I knew
what I had to do. I felt good going into
the tournament and I felt like I could
place as high as I did."
While Mango was able to exceed
expectations, redshirt junior Zack
Giesen decidedly fell short of his.
Giesen had been seeded second in the
184-pound weight class and was ex
pected to make the final. Instead, he
fell in the semifinals to Michael
Larsen of Cal State Bakersfield,
whom he had already defeated twice
earlier in the season. He ended up fin
ishing in third place.
"[Larsen] ran from him a lot and
we didn't get the calls we were looking
for from the official that would dictate
the pace of the match," Borrelli said.
"If the official warns the kid for
stalling, then he has to wrestle.
[Larsen] never got called, and that
forced Zack into a lot of positions he
didn't need to be in and he ended up
losing."
Two other wrestlers highlighted by
Borrelli were 133-pound redshirt jun
ior Justin Paulsen and 157-pound red
shirt junior Lucas Espericueta. While
the fourth-seeded Espericueta fin
ished fifth, his results were considered

fairly strong as he was coming off an
injury that had kept him off the mat
for almost two months.

"He's coming off of such a long lay
off because of his injury," Borrelli said.
"It's hard to know exactly what you're
going to get. He hasn't wrestled or
been in that live environment in a long
time."

The Cardinal was able to win two
automatic qualifications to the

NCAA Tournament in Omaha, Neb.,
which will take place on Mar.lB-20.
Two wrestlers, Mango and
Amuchastegui, have already earned
automatic qualification for the tour
nament.

"I personally want to be an Ail-
American to place in the top
eight," Mango said. "I definitely feel
like it's a reachable goal, but I have to
put together just as good of a tourna

ment, if not better, than I did at Pac
-10s."
According to Borrelli, three Cardi
nal wrestlers have a strong chance to
earn at-large bids to the tournament
Giesen, Paulsen and Espericueta.
After other conference tournaments
around the country complete compe
tition, the NCAA will select which
wrestlers will achieve at-large entries.
Given Giesen's top-15 national

ranking, it is highly likely that he will
earn a berth. While Paulsen and Es
pericueta are squarely on the bubble,
Borrelli remains confident that they
will secure at-large spots.
"It's going to be close, but I think
they have a fairly good chance of get
ting in," he said.
