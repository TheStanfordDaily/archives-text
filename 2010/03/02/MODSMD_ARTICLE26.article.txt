# MEN'S TENNIS
## Card stumbles, drops heartbreaker to rival USC 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
The No. 14 Stanford men's tennis team had
its chance. And another chance. And another
chance.

In a devastating 4-3 defeat on Sunday, the
Cardinal failed to capitalize on numerous op
portunities to clinch the match against No. 5
USC the team that eliminated Stanford from
last year's NCAA Tournament.
With the threat of rain looming (the UCLA
match on Saturday was cancelled due to rain),
the teams decided to play singles first, meaning
the doubles possibly would not matter. Stanford
wished they did not.
Courts 4-6 finished first, leaving Stanford
trailing 2-1. Freshman Matt Kandath and senior
Richard Wire lost, while junior Greg Hirshman
won his match.
As a few raindrops made their way through
the intermittent sunshine, junior Alex Clayton

was locked in a battle against the nation's top
ranked player, Steve Johnson. Clayton took the
first set 6-4 and won the tiebreak in the second
to win the match. Upon losing, Johnson, who
was visibly unnerved by the raucous crowd the
entire match, threw his racket in frustration, re
sulting in a one-point penalty granted to sopho
more Bradley Klahn.
Next to finish was sophomore Ryan
Thacher. After defeating Jaak Poldma 6-4 in the
first set,Thacher dropped the second 6-2. As the
crowd migrated over to Court 3 for the decisive
third set, a reenergized Thacher found his form
again, defeating Poldma 6-2 to win the match.
Leading 3-2 with one singles match still not
finished, Stanford had its first chance to clinch
the match. Klahn split his first two sets against
Robert Farah, losing the first and winning the
second, both on tiebreakers.
Tied 2-2 in the third set, Farah called for an
injury timeout as his legs began to
cramp. Klahn, in good spirits during
the timeout even winking to the
crowd in jest seemed ready to take
control of the back half of the set and
secure Stanford's victory.
"The crowd helped out a lot,"
Klahn said. "It's what makes college
tennis fun. Having all that support.
Being able to turn around after win
ning a big point and seeing everyone
shout and get really pumped up."
Yet, Farah responded. After
falling behind love-40, Farah won five
straight points to win the game. He
then broke Klahn's serve and held his
own to take a commanding 5-2 lead.
Klahn then rattled off three straight
games to tie the set, but that was as
close as he came. Farah won 7-5 to
keep USC's hopes alive and send the
match into the doubles side.

"If I could have just pushed my
way through, the finish line was near
and we could have clinched a huge
victory for us," Klahn said. "Unfortu
nately it didn't quite go my way."
Following a 10-minute intermis
sion, the three doubles matches start
ed. Klahn quickly redeemed himself,
as he andThacher both battling in
jury and fatigue dismantled Farah
and JT Sundling 8-4.
Stanford needed either the Clay

ton and Wire pair or the Kandath and
freshman Denis Lin pair to win their
matches. Both had their chances.
Both could not capitalize.
At one point, both matches were
knotted simultaneously at 7-7.
Clayton and Wire held serve to
jump ahead 8-7. Kandath and Lin
could not break serve to fall behind 8-
7. The freshmen then failed to hold
their serve, costing them the match, 9-
7.
All eyes were then on Clayton and
Wire. The duo couldn't break USC's
serve, sending their match and the
entire team match into a tiebreak
er.
The tiebreaker first to seven
points was not without controver
sy. Early in the tiebreak, Clayton
lobbed a ball to the back corner that
appeared to have been in from all
vantage points. Johnson raced back to
track it down and would have had to
hit a miraculous shot to return it.
Johnson called the shot deep, and
since his body shielded the umpire's
view, Stanford could not challenge.
Clayton and Wire never recov
ered. USC won the tiebreaker 7-3 to
win the match.
Luckily for the Cardinal, this
match does not count toward its Pac
-10 record. Still, it does not make it any
easier to forget the lost opportunities.
Stanford hosts Utah tomorrow at
1:30 p.m.

After being eliminated by the Trojans in the NCAA Tournament last season, the Cardinal was unable to capitalize on
opportunities last weekend as they lost a tough match to USC. Junior Greg Hirshman, above, provided a bright spot
for the Cardinal, however, as he won his singles match over Matt Kecki 6-4, 6-4 in the No. 6 spot.
