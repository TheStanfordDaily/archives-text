## SPRING BRINGS CHANGES TO CARDINAL FOOTBALL 
### 
Stanford football may be just two
months removed from the end of
its 2009 season, but it has already
undergone dramatic changes.
With spring practice beginning
today, head coach Jim Harbaugh will get a
first glance at his new-look squad.
"I'm super excited about this spring.
Probably even more so than the first year I
got here," he said.
Spring practice, which is split into two
sessions one before the finals break, and
one after, culminating in the April 17 spring
game at Kezar Stadium fills a football
void that lasts until the summer. Although
the Cardinal can continue to workout dur
ing the off-season, the NCAA only allots a
certain amount of days for the team to fully
practice during that time. As such, spring
practice acts as an important way station

both a chance to integrate new coaches and
to see which players have improved or
stayed stagnant.
In particular, Stanford rolls out a vastly
different coaching staff and defensive
scheme, and at the same time, must find a
way to replace the production of Toby Ger
hart.
With the introduction of Vic Fangio as
the Cardinal's defensive coordinator, Stan
ford has begun a switch from a 4-3 base to a
3-4 hybrid, which means that players' roles
will subsequently change. Along with the
rest of a largely new defensive staff
Lance Anderson (outside linebackers) is
the only returnee, with Randy Hart (line)
and Derek Mason (secondary) joining the
team as newcomers Fangio must begin
to assess the talent available for the
3-4.

He describes his philosophy as
one contingent on harassing the
quarterback.
"It has been a pressure-oriented
defense in the past. It will have to
be tailored to the players we have
here. We are not going to cram a
system down on players that maybe
they are not capable of doing," Fan
gio said. "So it will be a 3-4 base, but
it will be a hybrid 3-4 where we are
able to do a lot of 4-3 stuff within
the 3-4 personnel. We will take the
package where the players lead us."
The final sentence is particularly
important, as few defenders are
considered safe in their jobs.
Mason, for example, emphasized
that the entire secondary was, theo
retically, up for grabs. With a need
for a nose tackle and defensive
ends with different responsibilities
than in a 4-3, Hart was open to a
number of candidates to fill those
roles.
"It's a clean slate, especially this
year with new coaches," Harbaugh
said. "That's exciting for a ballplay
er, to learn, to grow, to learn new
concepts, and have a new shot with
new eyes on you."
Those eyes also dart outside of
their specified positions, as the staff
is open to moving players between
units and even different sides of the
ball. Harbaugh, light-heartedly or
not, said that Fangio could experi
ment with any offensive player ex
cept quarterback Andrew Luck.
The crossover has already begun:
fullback Owen Marecic is currently
slated at the top of the depth chart
at inside linebacker, a spot he dab
bled in during the 2009 season.
Quarterback Alex Loukas may be a
candidate for safety, and Harbaugh
said that there's "an ongoing fight"
for the services of Levine Toilolo
between the tight ends and the de
fensive line.
And while the defense, the Car
dinal's weak link last season, will
surely get a makeover, it may be
running back where the biggest
hole is left. With Gerhart moving
on to the NFL, Stanford must find a
way to replicate the nearly 1900
yards and 28 touchdowns he ac
counted for in 2009.
"We can't replace him and the
production he had," Harbaugh
said. "I don't believe that one man
on our roster can do that for the
2010 season, but I do believe that
we can replace his production in
combination, in tandem, in group."
Harbaugh did not put a time
table on establishing a depth chart,
but he did offer some candidates
for the role(s): StepfanTaylor,Tyler
Gaffney, Jeremy Stewart and, once
he's healthy, Usua Amanam on
track to be ready for the second
spring session. Gaffney is on the
baseball team, but is still expected
to participate, at least partially, in
football practice.
From listening to Harbaugh and
his assistants, not too much is set in
stone, particularly this year, when a
number of highly-rated recruits at
places of need will be thrown into
the mix in the summer. But even if
this respite from the off-season
serves only to intensify position
battles, it has, in Harbaugh's eyes,
fulfilled its purpose.
"We like competition around
here," Harbaugh said. "This sets up
really nice going forward."
NOTES: Luck is healthy and healed
from a broken finger that kept him
out of the Sun 80w1... Cornerback
Corey Gatewood will also be limit
ed in the first session due to a broken
foot. . . Offensive tackle Matt
Kopa, who is applying for a sixth
year of eligibility, has not yet re
ceived word from the NCAA, and
cannot practice until he is cleared. .
. Associate head coach Greg
Roman said that the main candi
dates to replace right tackle Chris
Marinelli are Tyler Mabry, Derek
Hall and Kevin Danser.. . Defen
sive ends Chase Thomas and Trent
Murphy will move to outside line
backer in the 3-4... New wide re
ceivers and quarterbacks coach Ron
Turner left the team before the begin
ning of spring practice to take a job
with the Indianapolis Colts.
