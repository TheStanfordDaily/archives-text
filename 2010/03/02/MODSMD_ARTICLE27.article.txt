## SPRING BRINGS CHANGES TO CARDINAL FOOTBALL 
### 
Stanford football may be just two
months removed from the end of
its 2009 season, but it has already
undergone dramatic changes.
With spring practice beginning
today, head coach Jim Harbaugh will get a
first glance at his new-look squad.
"I'm super excited about this spring.
Probably even more so than the first year I
got here," he said.
Spring practice, which is split into two
sessions one before the finals break, and
one after, culminating in the April 17 spring
game at Kezar Stadium fills a football
void that lasts until the summer. Although
the Cardinal can continue to workout dur
ing the off-season, the NCAA only allots a
certain amount of days for the team to fully
practice during that time. As such, spring
practice acts as an important way station

both a chance to integrate new coaches and
to see which players have improved or
stayed stagnant.
In particular, Stanford rolls out a vastly
different coaching staff and defensive
scheme, and at the same time, must find a
way to replace the production of Toby Ger
hart.
With the introduction of Vic Fangio as
the Cardinal's defensive coordinator, Stan
ford has begun a switch from a 4-3 base to a
3-4 hybrid, which means that players' roles
will subsequently change. Along with the
rest of a largely new defensive staff
Lance Anderson (outside linebackers) is
the only returnee, with Randy Hart (line)
and Derek Mason (secondary) joining the
team as newcomers Fangio must begin
