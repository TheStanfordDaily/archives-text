# Hockey: Olympic obsession
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
This Sunday, for the
umpteenth time this year, I
set my alarm to wake up
early (anything before noon
is early) to watch a sporting
event. I stayed in my pajamas until
nearly dinner time again, not a rare
occurrence. I watched the whole game
and even suspended my binge of com
puterized Hearts to watch the tense
ending a fairly rare occurrence.
Yet this Sunday was a first for me.
Why? Because I did all this for a hock
ey game.

I have to preface this by saying that
I am not a hockey fan. In any way. I
have great respect for it as a game, and
I can see why people love it. But I am
not a hockey expert by any means. The
extent of my hockey knowledge is what
I get from Sports Center, which means
I'm that guy saying "Hey, I've heard of
Gaborik he must be good!" I judge
how good a team is by how many
names sound familiar, and otherwise
just have to take the analysts' word.
Then why start now? Well, the
Olympics are a special event, an event
where people become obsessed with
sports they forget about for the next
four years. I watched the gold medal
women's curling match all the way
through the extra end, and I'll admit I
found the collapse by Canada fascinat
ing. I watched 50-kilometer cross coun
try skiing, women's short track relays
and four-man bobsled. And I can't ski,
can't skate and I'm sure I couldn't bob
sled without wanting to throw up.
So watching hockey a game I can
at least understand with players I might
have heard of was a no-brainer. I'm
not going to lie I became addicted to
Olympic hockey. Not just U.S. vs. Cana
da. We're talking Germany, Finland
and the Slovakian women's team. I'd
watch anything that was on. So I really
had to watch any game with the U.S. or
Canada.

At the beginning of the tourna
ment, I thought I'd just watch so I'd
have something to look at, not to care
about. I even considered rooting for
Canada, just because of how much
pressure the country had on the team
to win, and because I've never really
had anything against Canada.
By Sunday, that thought was gone.
By Sunday, I was the biggest U.S. fair
weather fan out there. I was all about
Langenbrunner and Rafalski (eight
points heading into the last game led
the tournament) and the Johnsons (no
relation). And of course, like any fan
out there, I loved Ryan Miller.
Even then, I was surprised by how
into the gold medal game I got. I found
myself really caring about it in away
that is usually reserved for my favorite
teams. And I was not alone in this feel
ing one look at Facebook told me
just how many other people felt the
same way I did.
This year's Olympic hockey was
truly amazing. I don't know what could
show this more than the common room
of my suite this Sunday. With a minute
left in the third period, three friends
and I were freaking out at every close
attempt by the U.S. trying to tie the
game. The four of us had sweaty palms
and frantically jittery feet in anticipa
tion. And when Zach Parise tied the
game with 24.4 seconds left in regula
tion, the four of us who had watched
a grand total of zero NHL games this
year erupted with glee. A runner, an
NBA fan, a soccer fan and I jumped in
the air and began to high five and hug
each other in celebration.
Even though Sidney Crosby gave
his country the world's biggest sigh of
relief and ended the Cinderella run of
the U.S., I will still never forget that mo
ment where we came together to cheer
on a team of players we didn't know in
a sport we don't follow against a coun
try we don't really have anything
against (Canada haters, it's really not
that bad). And while we were all devas
tated by the loss (and trust me, we
were), we all gained a new appreciation
for hockey that I don't think will leave
any time soon.
Still, I'm not going to pretend to be
a hockey fan now. That would just be an
insult to all the real hockey fans out
there. They're all yelling at me right
now that hockey is always this awe
some and that we're just idiots for not
realizing it sooner. And they're proba
bly right. Every time I watch hockey it's
interesting, but I just can't ever get real
ly into it.
