# The 						Math 51 roadblock
## Students differentiate the costs and benefits of AP Calculus 
### CAROLINE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Math 51, Linear Algebra and Differential
Calculus of Several Variables: not only a
mouthful of a course title, but also one of the
most widely taken classes on campus, with
about 400 students enrolled in the fall.

But the 50 series, which was created only
ten years ago, juggles multiple responsibili
ties. In the space of one quarter, Math 51 is

charged with bringing students with varying
backgrounds up to speed, introducing
abstract mathematic skills and adequately
covering the needs of other technical majors,
including chemistry, economics, engineering
and physics.
Yet few students give deeper considera
tion to the introductory math classes, seeing
Math 51 as no more than a requirement to
get out of the way, or a stepping stone to
more advanced math classes. Its place in
undergraduate education, however, is more
complex.

A student studies with his Math 51 textbooks close at hand. Over the years, students have
debated whether or not AP Calculus would be an adequate replacement for Math 51.
Math 51, explained that when the 50 series
was created, the math department talked to
many other departments about its design,
conscious of its role in providing students
with essential skills and knowledge.
"We were aware that the majority of
people taking the 50 series would not be
math majors, and we wanted to take into
account the departments that these people
would eventually go to," White said.
However, the math department chose
not to create major-specific introductory
math classes because they wanted to give
students more flexibility.
"Freshmen don't necessarily know what
major they're going into, and we don't want
to force a choice on them too soon," White
said, saying that was the same reason that
the math department does not offer a
"fuzzy" math class.
For those who are not planning on a
math major, Math 51 meets the math por
tion of the five General Education
Requirements that all students need to ful
fill in order to graduate. This contributes to
its status as the most commonly-taken
course in the department.
Currently, guidelines recommend that

students who earn a score of four on the
Advanced Placement AB Calculus test, or
three on BC Calculus, should take Math 51.
However, some students question
whether the math requirement is necessary,
arguing that a high score on the AP
Calculus test should allow students to waive
the math requirement in the same way a
high score in AP Spanish would allow a stu
dent to waive the language requirement.
"Calculus is already pretty advanced if
you're not using it in your major or career,"
said Maia Peirce 'l3, who is a prospective
English major. She explained that she
would only take Math 51 to fulfill the math
requirement, and did not plan to take any
more classes afterwards.
However, others argue that the point of
the math requirement is not to force stu
dents to go beyond calculus, but rather to
experience a college-level math course.
"In high school, AP Calculus can be
taught really differently and there is a huge
range of rigor," said Elliott Jin 'l2. "AP
Calculus is very computational, but college
mathematics teaches you how to deal with
abstraction."
Professor Rafe Mazzeo, chair of the
math department, agreed with Jin.
"Typically the classes cover more mate
rial, and cover it more deeply and abstract
ly," Mazzeo said.
He said that one of the most common
misconceptions among incoming freshmen

was the belief that success in math came
from memorizing the formulas. Mazzeo
believes this is not enough.
"Students need to understand how
things fit together as a big organic whole,"
he said, "and few high school classes do
that."
Lauren Janas 'l2 felt that AP Calculus
gives students the background knowledge
they need to handle the material found in
Math 51, but argued that it often does not
prepare students for the pace of the 50
series.
"I had a year and a half of calculus, and
there's not so much to learn so it's very
spread out," said Janas, who is considering
majoring in physics or symbolic systems.
Of the AP test, she said, "You can sleep
through that test and still get a five" by
no means a universally-held opinion.
The math requirement is also thought to
cause difficulties for aspiring "techie"
majors who didn't take AP Calculus before
coming to Stanford. Though the math major
could be easily completed if one started in
the 40 series, it would be more difficult to
complete some other majors, such as
physics.
"The 40 series for physics is calculus
based," Janas explained. "So if you didn't
take AP Calculus, you'd have to do the
entire physics major in three years you'd
be really screwed."
"That's a tricky situation," White con

ceded. "There's a limit to how fast people
can absorb material, but we try to be flexi
ble. For example, if you want to take calcu
lus faster, you can take the 40 series instead
of the 19-20-21 series."
White also emphasized that the math
department has no strict prerequisites for
Math 51 and that the recommendations are
only guidelines.
"If a student didn't get a five on AB
Calc, but really wanted to take 51,1 would
tell him to go ahead and try it," White said.
"Ultimately, we just want people to be in
the course that's the best fit for them."
Then, there is the question of which
math classes non-math majors should take.
The math department does not offer intro
ductory math classes tailored for any of the
"techie" majors; only some higher levels
classes are geared towards physics or engi
neering majors.
"You need all of the 50 series for physics,
plus lots of stuff they don't teach you,"
Janas said. "You're expected to learn a lot
of math on the fly."
On the other hand, Hang Hong, a profes
sor and the director of undergraduate study
for the economics department, admitted
that not all of Math 51 would be useful to
an economics major, though it is a prerequi
site for Econ 50.
Today, the math department continues
to solicit feedback from students and is con
stantly reviewing the curriculum. Both

Mazzeo and White stressed the importance
of hiring professors who are not only
researchers, but also good teachers, espe
cially for introductory courses.
Mazzeo believes that the 50 series is
working well for the time being, but he
added, smiling, "Above all, we must be ever
vigilant."

lus faster, you can take the 40 series instead
of the 19-20-21 series."
White also emphasized that the math
department has no strict prerequisites for
Math 51 and that the recommendations are
only guidelines.
"If a student didn't get a five on AB
Calc, but really wanted to take 51,1 would
tell him to go ahead and try it," White said.
"Ultimately, we just want people to be in
the course that's the best fit for them."
Then, there is the question of which
math classes non-math majors should take.
The math department does not offer intro
ductory math classes tailored for any of the
"techie" majors; only some higher levels
classes are geared towards physics or engi
neering majors.
"You need all of the 50 series for physics,
plus lots of stuff they don't teach you,"
Janas said. "You're expected to learn a lot
of math on the fly."
On the other hand, Hang Hong, a profes
sor and the director of undergraduate study
for the economics department, admitted
that not all of Math 51 would be useful to
an economics major, though it is a prerequi
site for Econ 50.
Today, the math department continues
to solicit feedback from students and is con
stantly reviewing the curriculum. Both

Mazzeo and White stressed the importance
of hiring professors who are not only
researchers, but also good teachers, espe
cially for introductory courses.
Mazzeo believes that the 50 series is
working well for the time being, but he
added, smiling, "Above all, we must be ever
vigilant."

Math 51, Linear Algebra and Differential
Calculus of Several Variables: not only a
mouthful of a course title, but also one of the
most widely taken classes on campus, with
about 400 students enrolled in the fall.

But the 50 series, which was created only
ten years ago, juggles multiple responsibili
ties. In the space of one quarter, Math 51 is

charged with bringing students with varying
backgrounds up to speed, introducing
abstract mathematic skills and adequately
covering the needs of other technical majors,
including chemistry, economics, engineering
and physics.
Yet few students give deeper considera
tion to the introductory math classes, seeing
Math 51 as no more than a requirement to
get out of the way, or a stepping stone to
more advanced math classes. Its place in
undergraduate education, however, is more
complex.

A student studies with his Math 51 textbooks close at hand. Over the years, students have
debated whether or not AP Calculus would be an adequate replacement for Math 51.
Math 51, explained that when the 50 series
was created, the math department talked to
many other departments about its design,
conscious of its role in providing students
with essential skills and knowledge.
"We were aware that the majority of
people taking the 50 series would not be
math majors, and we wanted to take into
account the departments that these people
would eventually go to," White said.
However, the math department chose
not to create major-specific introductory
math classes because they wanted to give
students more flexibility.
"Freshmen don't necessarily know what
major they're going into, and we don't want
to force a choice on them too soon," White
said, saying that was the same reason that
the math department does not offer a
"fuzzy" math class.
For those who are not planning on a
math major, Math 51 meets the math por
tion of the five General Education
Requirements that all students need to ful
fill in order to graduate. This contributes to
its status as the most commonly-taken
course in the department.
Currently, guidelines recommend that

students who earn a score of four on the
Advanced Placement AB Calculus test, or
three on BC Calculus, should take Math 51.
However, some students question
whether the math requirement is necessary,
arguing that a high score on the AP
Calculus test should allow students to waive
the math requirement in the same way a
high score in AP Spanish would allow a stu
dent to waive the language requirement.
"Calculus is already pretty advanced if
you're not using it in your major or career,"
said Maia Peirce 'l3, who is a prospective
English major. She explained that she
would only take Math 51 to fulfill the math
requirement, and did not plan to take any
more classes afterwards.
However, others argue that the point of
the math requirement is not to force stu
dents to go beyond calculus, but rather to
experience a college-level math course.
"In high school, AP Calculus can be
taught really differently and there is a huge
range of rigor," said Elliott Jin 'l2. "AP
Calculus is very computational, but college
mathematics teaches you how to deal with
abstraction."
Professor Rafe Mazzeo, chair of the
math department, agreed with Jin.
"Typically the classes cover more mate
rial, and cover it more deeply and abstract
ly," Mazzeo said.
He said that one of the most common
misconceptions among incoming freshmen

was the belief that success in math came
from memorizing the formulas. Mazzeo
believes this is not enough.
"Students need to understand how
things fit together as a big organic whole,"
he said, "and few high school classes do
that."
Lauren Janas 'l2 felt that AP Calculus
gives students the background knowledge
they need to handle the material found in
Math 51, but argued that it often does not
prepare students for the pace of the 50
series.
"I had a year and a half of calculus, and
there's not so much to learn so it's very
spread out," said Janas, who is considering
majoring in physics or symbolic systems.
Of the AP test, she said, "You can sleep
through that test and still get a five" by
no means a universally-held opinion.
The math requirement is also thought to
cause difficulties for aspiring "techie"
majors who didn't take AP Calculus before
coming to Stanford. Though the math major
could be easily completed if one started in
the 40 series, it would be more difficult to
complete some other majors, such as
physics.
"The 40 series for physics is calculus
based," Janas explained. "So if you didn't
take AP Calculus, you'd have to do the
entire physics major in three years you'd
be really screwed."
"That's a tricky situation," White con

ceded. "There's a limit to how fast people
can absorb material, but we try to be flexi
ble. For example, if you want to take calcu
lus faster, you can take the 40 series instead
of the 19-20-21 series."
White also emphasized that the math
department has no strict prerequisites for
Math 51 and that the recommendations are
only guidelines.
"If a student didn't get a five on AB
Calc, but really wanted to take 51,1 would
tell him to go ahead and try it," White said.
