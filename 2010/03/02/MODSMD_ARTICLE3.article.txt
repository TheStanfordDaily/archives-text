# The
						Math 51 roadblock
## Students differentiate the costs and benefits of AP Calculus 
### CAROLINE CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Math 51, Linear Algebra and Differential
Calculus of Several Variables: not only a
mouthful of a course title, but also one of the
most widely taken classes on campus, with
about 400 students enrolled in the fall.

But the 50 series, which was created only
ten years ago, juggles multiple responsibili
ties. In the space of one quarter, Math 51 is

charged with bringing students with varying
backgrounds up to speed, introducing
abstract mathematic skills and adequately
covering the needs of other technical majors,
including chemistry, economics, engineering
and physics.
Yet few students give deeper considera
tion to the introductory math classes, seeing
Math 51 as no more than a requirement to
get out of the way, or a stepping stone to
more advanced math classes. Its place in
undergraduate education, however, is more
complex.

debated whether or not AP Calculus would be an adequate replacement for Math 51.
