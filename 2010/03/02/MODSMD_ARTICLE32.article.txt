# BRUINS DEAL CARD FIRST LOSS OF SEASON
## 
### WILLSEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A weekend of big expectations
proved difficult for the Stanford
women's tennis team after losing hand
ily to No. 4 UCLA (10-1) and getting
rained out in its match against No. 10
USC (7-3).
No. 11 Stanford (7-1) had marked
this weekend on its calendars a long
time ago as an opportunity to really
see how the women matched up with
the rest of the Pac-10. After missing
the ITA National Indoors, the play
ers were not sure how good they
were compared to their other Califor
nia rivals.
On a seven-game win streak going
into Friday, Stanford suffered its first
setback of the season when they were
overpowered by the Bruins 6-1. While
the loss did not count toward Pac-10
rankings, it mattered for momentum
going forward in the rest of the season.
Coming out of this weekend, the Cardi
nal will need to see how well it reacts to
adversity.
"We just weren't all there," said
freshman Stacey Tan. "We might have
over-thought the fact that UCLA is
ranked higher than us at the moment."
The day started with doubles and
featured a surprising upset at the No. 1
spot. Both teams split results
through the No. 2 and No. 3 spot, with
Tan and fellow freshman Mallory Bur
dette getting an exciting 8-5 win in their
first Pac-10 showing.
"[Mallory and I] played really well

in doubles,"Tan said on her team's win.
"They were a good team, but I don't
know, we were pretty pumped. I was
more vocal than I usually am, with the
'Come on!' to everyone else."
UCLA clinched the doubles point
when Yasmin Schnack and Andre a Re
mynse, the No. 11 doubles team in the
country, upset the second-best doubles
team in the country Stanford's jun
ior Hilary Barte and senior Lindsay
Burdette by a score of 8-5.
Despite strong opposition at the
top few spots by Stanford, the Bruins
were able to win a majority in singles
as well. Mallory Burdette took her op
ponent to a tiebreaker in the first set
before losing 7-6 (8), 6-4. Older sister
Lindsay went to a third-set tiebreak
before falling 6-7(7), 6-2, (10-6) in an
other upset.
Tan's big Pac-10 debut was marred
with anxiety after the team lost the
doubles point.
"I was looking at the scoreboards a
lot,"Tan said. "Oh, we're down the dou
bles point, what if we lose this match? If
I had just believed and been more con
fident in my game, gone out and played
without thinking about all the outside
factors, I would have been better."
Only Barte proved able to with
stand the UCLA momentum by man
ufacturing her own upset, defeating No.
5 Schnack 7-5, 2-6, (10-7) to prevent
Stanford from being shut out. Hilary's
win was large for her on an individual
level as well. She improved her record
to 16-3 and more importantly 8-0 in
duals. She has won 11 consecutive

matches and is nine wins away from
surpassing her career-best winning
streak of 19 wins, established during
her freshman year.
The Stanford women went into
Saturday looking forward to another
tough match against an opponent
ranked only one spot above them.
With both teams relatively compara
ble in skill, it promised to be an excit
ing day. Unfortunately, rain in the
L.A. area forced the teams to call it
off. They won't reschedule the match,
but will instead wait to face off in their
previously scheduled rematch on
April 2 in Palo Alto.
Looking ahead from this weekend,
the Cardinal needs to make sure its
loss does not drag the team down.
While the initial disappointment
might not have entirely dissipated yet,
the players seem to be reacting in a
positive fashion.
"Of course, after we finished the
match, it was disappointing," Tan said.
"But we're going to practice [...] just
working harder, being more focused,
knowing what we're working towards.
It just opened our eyes to the fact that
we should work on a couple things.
Things like not being nervous, working
well as a team, working hard in practice
and taking that into the matches. Even
if it wasn't all that long, it was re ally use
ful."
