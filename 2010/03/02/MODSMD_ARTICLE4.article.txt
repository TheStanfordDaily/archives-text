## Gates scholars find a home on the Farm 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
With 136 Gates Millennium Scholarship
recipients, Stanford has the third most of any
university, according to a new analysis of the
scholarship's data.
UC-Berkeley and UCLA rank first and sec
ond, respectively.
The Gates scholarship, established in 1999
by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, aims

to "promote academic excellence by providing
thousands of outstanding students, who have
significant financial need, the opportunity to
reach their full potential."
It requires that recipients have a cumulative
high school GPA of at least 3.3., be eligible for
the federal Pell Grant and be African
American, American Indian/Alaskan Native,
Asian and Pacific Islander American or
Hispanic American.
Mary Morrison, director of funds manage

ment in Stanford's Office of Financial Aid, esti
mates that 15 of Stanford's 136 Gates scholars
are graduate students.
The scholarship funds all education costs
not met by financial aid and the expected fam
ily contribution, as determined by the Free
Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).
At some schools, this amount is quite signif-
icant because full financial aid is not
provided, Morrison said.
However, since Stanford features a
relatively robust financial aid pro
gram, the Gates may contribute very
little financially on the Farm.
"Here, we re already meeting the
need for students except for the
[work-study] job," Morrison said. "We
expect students to contribute some
thing."

A Gates Millennium Scholarship
will pay for that "something," cover

ing the amount a student would earn
from work-study. For undergradu
ates, that amount rarely exceeds
$4,500.
"Particularly for Stanford students
who have the Gates scholarship, I
think Gates actually gives itself a lot
more credit for giving more aid than
they do," said Jessica Perez, 'lO, a
Gates scholar from Los Angeles.
Of the 4,904 Gates Scholars cur
rently enrolled in colleges and univer
sities, 53 percent attend public institu
tions, Williams told the Daily in an e
mail.

Morrison noted that these schools
do not always offer the same kind of
full-need financial aid that is available
at Stanford and Ivy League schools.

For students like Veronica Lane,
'lO, there is no unmet need to which
the Gates scholarship can contribute,
"Stanford has such great financial
aid, so there's not much Gates can
do," Lane said. "If I had gone to a
school with less financial aid, they
would have played a much bigger
role."
Gates Scholars may extend their
funding for a graduate degree, provid
ed that they study computer science,
education, engineering, library sci
ence, mathematics, public health or
science. Undergraduates may study
any discipline,
Perez, who is majoring in English
and comparative studies in race and
ethnicity, does not plan to attend
graduate school next year. But she is
reassured by the fact that the Gates
scholarship will financially support
her, should she change her mind.
Because Master's students do not
have grant or scholarship financial
support from universities, GMS takes
on a more substantial role.
"Financial aid for graduate stu

dents is scarce, and Gates is helping
solve that problem," Morrison said.
"I'm sure it makes all the difference in
the world."

"For me, the Gates scholarship has
been a mixed experience because a
lot of people who know about it see it
as very prestigious and are very
impressed by it, but at the same time,
it hasn't actually influenced my expe
rience dramatically in college," Perez
said.
But she acknowledges that it does
eliminate her need to borrow money
or work. This allows her to focus on
her non-profit organization, SEE
College Prep, which provides SAT
preparation classes to disadvantaged
high school students so that they too
can succeed.
Among the top 10 universities for
the 4,904 currently enrolled Gates
scholars are Harvard, ranked fifth,
and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, ranked seventh.
