# Wired to the Web
## Anderson speaks about the benefits of the Internet Age 
### MILES UNTERREINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Chris Anderson, prize-winning author
and editor in chief of WIRED magazine,
spoke Monday evening at Cubberley
Auditorium about the Internet's potential
to reduce barriers to entry in manufactur
ing for small-time inventors and entrepre
neurs a concept Anderson termed
"democratization of the tools of produc
tion and distribution."

Anderson, who began his storied career
in science journalism at Science and
Nature, propelled WIRED to nine
National Magazine Award nominations
and a prestigious 2009 designation as
"Magazine of the Decade." He also cham
pioned the application of open-source soft
ware and individual online innovation to
the production of real-world goods
something he predicted would spark a
"new Industrial Revolution" in manufac-

turing.
Anderson began yesterday's talk with a
discussion of the benefits of "garage tinker
ing and basement inventing in the Internet
Age."

"The past decade was about finding new
social and innovation models on the Web;
the next decade will be about applying
them to the real world," Anderson said.
"The Web has been awesome, and it's
blown our minds, but this is just the begin
ning," he added.
The world that Anderson envisions,
which heralds "the end of the blockbuster
monopoly," is one in which the very idea of
what a company should be and look like is
radically different from our conceptions of
a corporation today.
It's a universe in which small inventors
and entrepreneurs, seamlessly connected to
one another via the Internet, streamline
and expedite production by efficiently net
working ideas in free competition with tra
ditional corporations. It's a universe of
auto-piloted drones designed by high
school dropouts in basements, open-source
cars put together in a garage over the
weekend and three-dimensional printers
that can put ink on a Z-axis.
But most of all, Anderson said, it's a
world in which the people who are best
equipped to do a job are assigned to do it
where labor is allocated with almost

perfect efficiency.
"It doesn't matter who you are, which
country you live in, or which degree you
have —it matters what you can do. If
you're the perfect person for the job, you
can be found," Anderson said. "Whether
you went to Stanford or didn't go to college
at all, you've got the same access to the
marketplace."
In addition to lauding the Internet's
labor-allocating benefits, Anderson praised
the Web's function as a medium to reduce
barriers to entry for the aspiring small-busi
nessperson, who previously faced high
startup costs for large-scale manufacturing
endeavors.
"Technology opens up marketplaces
and it is scale-agnostic," noted Anderson,
whose great-grandfather invented the
automatic sprinkler system but lacked the
capital to market it on a large scale, eventu
ally losing out to established big business.
He also pointed to low-cost Chinese
basic goods, obtainable via the Internet, as
key to driving growth in the small-business
sector.
"We've always known you could
outsource to China, but it used to be
complicated .. . now they take
Pay Pal," Anderson said, touting
international free trade Web sites
like Alibaba.com as essential to the
low-cost exchange of goods.
"Now the little guys can make
goods at the same rate as the big
guys," he added.
Anderson's message met with a
generally positive response from
Stanford students, though, some
were unsure about the inevitability
of the "new Industrial Revolution."

"I came because he's a bailer guy
and I read WIRED religiously," said
attendee Dan Wiesenthal 'lO.
"I'd like to find out a little more
about what it means for me, though,"
added Wiesenthal, who felt that bar
riers to entry weren't quite as low as
Anderson predicted. "I still
see significant barriers to entry
whereas he portrayed there as being
none," he said.
