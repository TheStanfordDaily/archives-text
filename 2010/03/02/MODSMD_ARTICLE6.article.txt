## Businesses invest in America Corporate alliance promises a bevy of new jobs to students 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
An initiative spearheaded by Intel
Corporation and 24 venture capital
firms may ease some Stanford seniors'
stress as they struggle to find jobs after
graduation, now just over three months
away.
The new plan, called the Invest in
America Alliance, hopes to boost the
nation's competition in the global econ
omy and create jobs, according to Intel
President and CEO Paul Otellini.
According to Intel's Web site, many
of the participating corporations have
joined in an effort to create 10,500 new
jobs for college graduates. Enlisted cor
porations include Adobe Systems, Dell
Inc., eßay, Google, Yahoo! and
Microsoft.
Announced last month, the plan is
expected to use a two-part approach to
increase the United States' productivity:
venture capital investment and college
graduate hiring.
Several leading venture capital
investment firms have joined Intel in the
effort, including Draper Fisher
Jurvetson (DFJ), a firm based in Silicon
Valley.
"We at DFJ are joining the Alliance
to invest in the U.S. in hopes that the
U.S. continues to be a competitive
country with respect to attracting
entrepreneurs and venture capital,"
wrote Timothy Draper, the firm's
CEO, in an e-mail to The Daily.
The first goal of the Alliance is to
invest more in startups and to foster
"entrepreneurial spirit." Approxi
mately $3.5 billion has been com
mitted to invest in the most innova
tive new ventures in the country.
The new investments are fore
casted to keep the innovation en
gine "well-fueled," according to
Steve Wright, vice president of the
Silicon Valley Leadership Group,
which represents 300 Valley compa
nies.
"The Alliance is putting up the
money that will help fund not just
research but also hiring so they can
come up with newer technologies,"
Wright said.
Wright said that the plan could
help uncover the "next big thing."
"These people are trying to think

of what's next after [clean tech]," he
said. "They're putting a good invest
ment into the future. Many younger,
out-of-college minds have led to
much of the technology that has
driven the innovation economy."
Draper said venture capital firms
have been investing less in startups
in recent years, but plans to turn that
trend around are on the horizon.
"Venture capital gives entrepre
neurs the 'rocket fuel' they need to
launch their visions, build their
teams and grow their companies,"
Draper said.
"This may be the best time ever
for Stanford students or graduates
to start businesses," he added, "since
people are willing to do a lot for a lit
tle, and there will be fewer competi
tive startups since money is so diffi
cult to come by."
According to Draper, the Al
liance's initiative will also encour
age corporations and businesses to
hire more college grads.
This may be good news for Stan
ford students, said Lance Choy, the
director of Stanford's Career Devel
opment Center.
"Venture capital is also one of
the best job creators in the econo
my," Draper said. "Given the differ

ent economic environment we have
in the U.S., we believe a healthy ven
ture capital industry is critical for
the coming recovery."
"Many of the established compa
nies have agreed [to use these in
vestments] to hire more graduated
students so they can bolster their re
search and development depart
ments," Wright added.
According to Wright, about 40 to
50 percent of all venture capital in
America is invested in Silicon Valley.
However, Choy pointed out, the
plan's expected benefits are not the
end-all solution. According to him,
the job market is better than last
year but still tough.
"Students have to work harder,
longer and smarter to find job op
portunities," Choy wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
Beverly Principal, assistant direc
tor of employment services at the
CDC, agreed that the job market is
competitive and urges students to
seek guidance.
"I venture a guess that [the job
market] will be that way for a while,"
Principal said.
