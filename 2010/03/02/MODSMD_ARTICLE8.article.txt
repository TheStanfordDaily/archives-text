## Study finds way to prevent cancer recurrence 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the Stanford School of
Medicine have discovered a new way to
prevent the recurrence of a deadly form of
brain cancer called glioblastoma. The
breakthrough research, conducted on mice,
could have a significant impact on how can
cer is treated in humans.
Past research has shown that radiation
treatment can be effective on glioblastoma
tumors in the short run, but the cancer near
ly always recurs, typically resulting in death
within a few months. Very few people with
this type of brain cancer live for more than
two years after diagnosis.
In a study published online in the
Journal of Clinical Investigation, Stanford
medical researchers found that irradiated
tumors (tumors subjected to radiation ther
apy) use a little-known, secondary pathway
to receive the oxygen and nutrients that
make growth possible. Researchers found
that by blocking these pathways, they could
drastically reduce rates of cancer recur
rence.
"Under normal circumstances, this path

way is not important for growth of most
tumors," said Martin Brown, a professor of
radiation oncology and senior author of the
paper, in a report by the School of
Medicine. "What we hadn't realized until
recently is that radiation meant to kill the
cancer cells also destroys the existing blood
vessels that nourish the tumor. As a result, it
has to rely on a backup blood delivery path
way."

While scientists focused on glioblastoma
in their research, many other types of
tumors use similar mechanisms to evade
radiotherapy, suggesting that this research
could be broadly applicable to cancer treat
ment.

Brown and his colleagues used a mole
cule called AMD3IOO to block the second
ary growth process. This molecule is already
approved for other uses in humans, so it is
possible that clinical trials to test the mole
cule in human patients could take place
soon.

However, researchers caution that routine
clinical use of this treatment on humans is
probably still years away, since there is a
demanding, multi-phase testing process
that must be carried out before FDA
approval can be obtained.
According to Brown, the inspira
tion for this research project has been
years in the making.
"I was looking at some data pub
lished by a Harvard lab in 1993 that
showed that the sensitivity of tumors
to irradiation did not depend on the
sensitivity of the tumor blood vessels,"
Brown said in an interview with The
Daily. "It seemed to me that there
must be circulating cells that could
reconstitute the tumor blood vessels
after irradiation. I thought, 'if we could
prevent these cells coming from the
bone marrow [then] we could stop
tumors recurring after irradiation.'"
Though much research and test
ing remains to be done, this discovery
has potentially powerful implications
for the future of cancer treatment in
humans.
"Changing the treatment of solid

tumors, which make up 90 percent of
all cancers, by irradiation is clearly a
likely possible consequence of this
research," Brown said.
In addition to Brown, the study's
contributors are research associate
Mitomu Kioi, the paper's first author,
and neurosurgery professor Griffith
Harsh, a co-author. Brown and Harsh
are members of Stanford's Cancer
Center.
