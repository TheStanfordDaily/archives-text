## Study finds way to prevent cancer recurrence 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the Stanford School of
Medicine have discovered a new way to
prevent the recurrence of a deadly form of
brain cancer called glioblastoma. The
breakthrough research, conducted on mice,
could have a significant impact on how can
cer is treated in humans.
Past research has shown that radiation
treatment can be effective on glioblastoma
tumors in the short run, but the cancer near
ly always recurs, typically resulting in death
within a few months. Very few people with
this type of brain cancer live for more than
two years after diagnosis.
In a study published online in the
Journal of Clinical Investigation, Stanford
medical researchers found that irradiated
tumors (tumors subjected to radiation ther
apy) use a little-known, secondary pathway
to receive the oxygen and nutrients that
make growth possible. Researchers found
that by blocking these pathways, they could
drastically reduce rates of cancer recur
rence.
"Under normal circumstances, this path

way is not important for growth of most
tumors," said Martin Brown, a professor of
radiation oncology and senior author of the
paper, in a report by the School of
Medicine. "What we hadn't realized until
recently is that radiation meant to kill the
cancer cells also destroys the existing blood
vessels that nourish the tumor. As a result, it
has to rely on a backup blood delivery path
way."

While scientists focused on glioblastoma
in their research, many other types of
tumors use similar mechanisms to evade
radiotherapy, suggesting that this research
could be broadly applicable to cancer treat
ment.

Brown and his colleagues used a mole
cule called AMD3IOO to block the second
ary growth process. This molecule is already
approved for other uses in humans, so it is
possible that clinical trials to test the mole
cule in human patients could take place
soon.

However, researchers caution that routine
clinical use of this treatment on humans is
probably still years away, since there is a
