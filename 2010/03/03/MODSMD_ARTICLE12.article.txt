## Making the best of a very hairy situation 
### PERI UNVER 
Many have tried, but only a handful of stu
dents can cut it as the unofficial dorm bar
ber. It's not uncommon to find one or two
students in each dorm, house or residence
who provide amateur salon services for
their dormmates.
In FroSoCo, Taylor Nguyen 'l3 and Wesley Dunnagan
'l2 are the unofficial "dorm barbers." While they both bal
ance full course loads, Nguyen and Dunnagan make a point
to help their dormmates and their dormmates' locks
look their best.
Nguyen said rumors of her talent spread by word of
mouth throughout the dorm.
"I cut one of my really good friends' hair when he asked
me," Nguyen said. "Then, other people just started asking
me to cut their hair, too. I don't really know when it start
ed."
So far Nguyen's clients have been mostly male, includ
ing some of FroSoCo's College Assistants (CAs). Jordan
Garcia 'lO, a CA, joked about the experience, but also
explained why it is great to have someone take on the role
of dorm barber.
"It was a great experience; I got to tell the story of my
life," he said. "No, but honestly it is great to have someone
who cuts hair in the dorm. It's convenient and it's free."
Dunnagan's mother works at a salon in Indiana, where
he spent time growing up "practically my whole life," he
said. He recalled an early experience he had with hair-cut
ting and styling, which may have been his inspiration.
"One summer, when my mom was cutting hair at a nurs
ing home, she would have me take out the rollers and brush
out the ladies' hair," Dunnagan said. "I think that is why
people ask me for help."
Dunnagan added that his lock-trimming talent didn't
hurt his reputation either.
"It must be because I have exquisite taste," he said with
a wink.
A typical hair-cut with the dorm barber takes place in a
dorm hallway, with the barbers ready to go, safety scissors
in hand. After a few snips, the barber is finished and out
comes the vacuum and a happy-looking client.
Garcia went on to explain his reasons for not venturing
outside FroSoCo for a haircut.
"I had heard some pretty bad stories about Stanford

Hair," he said. "For other places, it's hard to get there and
it can be a little pricey ... also, now when I don't go home
during breaks I can still get my hair cut here."
While Jackie Lho 'll, a resident of EAST house, does
cut hair for a few friends, she resists the title "dorm barber."
"I wouldn't really call myself [that], per se," she said. "At
college, it started in my freshman dorm, when my friend
Ryan said he needed a haircut... he ended up liking it and
trusting me with his hair, so I've been cutting his and a few
other friends' hair ever since!"
Nguyen, Dunnagan and Lho all of whom provide a
valuable service for their friends cut hair purely for the
fun of it, never charging people for the trim.
"I'd never charge people," Lho said. "In my sophomore
dorm last year, there were some people who knew what
they were doing, but would charge a small fee. If people
didn't feel like paying, I would offer to cut it for free and,
of course, give them fair warning that I wasn't a profession
al or anywhere close."
Nguyen laughed at the idea of turning her hobby into a
business.
"I guess I just never thought of it that way," she said.
