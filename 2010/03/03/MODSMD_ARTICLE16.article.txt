## EDITORIAL iWeek engages students on immigration issues 
### 
Immigration is an issue which, when ad
dressed in Congress, often proves to be
more divisive than health care reform, the
war in Iraq or financial regulation. As in many
cases, politicians on the far ends of each side of
the spectrum drive the debate, and the immi
gration issue seems to be stifled by this deep
polarization.
One way the Editorial Board believes stu
dents can inform themselves about immigra
tion reform in the United States is by attempt
ing to engage it on multiple levels, bringing to
gether the academic and the political to en
gage those directly affected by the policies or
issues being addressed. A powerful example
of this multi-layered approach can be seen in
a series of events occurring this week, dubbed
"iWeek." Spearheaded by the Stanford Immi
grant Rights Project with the support of
the ASSU, The Speaker's Bureau, Stanford in
Government and many other groups the
events of iWeek are as diverse as their spon
sors.

The DREAM Act is one component of re
form that may particularly resonate with Stan
ford Students. Currently, 65,000 undocument
ed students graduate from American high
schools each year, but few have paths to high
er education, military service or citizenship.
Considered in Congress since 2001, if passed,
the bill would provide undocumented stu
dents of "good moral character" the chance to
obtain conditional permanent legal residency
as they pursue their undergraduate education.
The passage of the bill would be monumental
in securing funds for college for students with
out legal residency.
President Hennessy, along with many
other university presidents, has conveyed his
full support for the 2009 DREAM Act. Driven
by "the desire to give outstanding members of
our community a chance to succeed," Hen
nessy wrote to our congresswomen and state
senators last year in support of the bill.
Though President Obama devoted only
one vague sentence to immigration reform in
his State of the Union address, we hope our
peers are more active in engaging with the
issue. In the classroom, many political science,
sociology and economics courses address is
sues of national identity and labor globally.
Multiple Alternative Spring Break courses
also fuse academic components with direct ex
posure to our national border.
Regardless of one's beliefs, the Editorial
Board feels all would be served to find away

The former Secretary of Labor, Ray Mar

for increased economic prosperity that com
prehensive immigration reform can bring.
Different outreach efforts include STAMP
letter-reading performances throughout cam
pus helping to illustrate the human side of the
issue. A demonstration on Monday in White
Plaza included a human border, reminding
bikers and walkers of the hundreds of deaths
annually at the United States/Mexico border.
The slight inconvenience this caused may also
leave a more lasting impression than the flyer
sharing that accompanied the "border wall."
