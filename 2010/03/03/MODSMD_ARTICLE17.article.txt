# GET IT RIGHT
## The
						logic of bearing arms transcends political divisions 
### Erica Morgan 
Ido not understand the politicization of
the nation's controversy over guns. Some
aspects of the argument fall along typical
party lines, I suppose. Conservatives favor
the "original intent" interpretation of the
Second Amendment and limited govern
mental intervention in the freedom to pur
chase and own weapons. Liberals classically
support governmental interference in indi
vidual freedoms. So on that level, the political
debate has context. However, it seems to me
that arguments surrounding the practical
value/menace of guns ought to be apolitical.
A recent New York Times headline
caught my attention: "Fearing Obama Agen
da, States Push to Loosen Gun Laws." My
hackles went up immediately, and I plunged
into the article and prepared myself to be
outraged at Obama's anti-gun agenda. Mut
tering direly, I skimmed the piece and was
surprised to find my preconceived notions
countered by the substance of the article. Mr.
Obama, to the chagrin of gun control advo
cates, has "been largely silent on [gun con
trol]," and actually signed bills last year "al
lowing guns to be carried in national parks
and in luggage on Amtrak trains."
The Times observes a veritable plethora
of advancements for gun rights supporters.
The Virginia General Assembly passed a bill
allowing concealed weapons to be carried in
alcohol-serving bars and restaurants. Law
makers in Tennessee and Montana have
voted to exempt their states from federal reg
ulation of guns and ammunition produced
and used within the state.
Contemplating this article, I realized that
I had fallen into the trap of assuming that a
Democrat, by virtue of his political align
ment, must have an active anti-gun agenda.
This kind of assumption is akin to the typical
classification of Republicans as gun-waving,
homosexual-hating, Christian bigots. The
focus of the political divide over gun rights
seems to hover over the constitutionality of
"keeping and bearing" arms. Does the phras
ing of the Second Amendment imply individ
ual gun rights, or the right of a state to main
tain a militia (which would render the Sec
ond Amendment virtually irrelevant, given
that the militia system is no longer in place)?
After reading the New York Times article, I
decided to put this question aside and re
assess my position on guns independent of
the standard constitutional interpretation by
conservatives. A combination of common
sense and statistical data has led me to the
conclusion that excessive gun control is un
helpful and unwise even without calling
its constitutionality into question.
I am in favor of gun registration. It is pru
dent to be cognizant of gun ownership and to
complete background checks of individuals
purchasing the weapons. Beyond basic pre
cautionary regulations, however, anti-gun

measures make little sense. Legal ownership
of guns is a key factor in crime prevention.
Guns serve as both crime deterrents and in
struments of self-defense. States that have
experienced the most marked increases in
gun ownership have also witnessed the most
significant decreases in violent crimes. Per
mitting adults who clear a background check
to carry concealed weapons has reduced
murder and crime rates significantly in the
states that pass concealed carry laws. One
study reviewing crime statistics in every
county in the United States from 1977 to
1992 found that states with concealed carry
legislation experienced decreases in murder,
rape, aggravated assault and robbery. Imag
ine yourself to be a gun-toting criminal. You
would think twice about attacking someone
if it were possible that the intended victim
packed a handgun.
Additionally, in 2004, 2.5 million citizens
used guns in self-defense, and in 92 percent of
these incidents, the citizen under attack did
not find it necessary to wound or kill his/her
assailant. Brandishing the weapon or firing a
warning shot was sufficient in the over
whelming majority of these occurrences.
Data reveals that nations featuring high gun
ownership rates such as Switzerland, New
Zealand and Israel face extremely low crime
rates, another indication that guns in the
hands of law-abiding citizens reduce criminal
activity.
Guns can certainly be horribly misused.
The problem with gun control is that it im
pacts the honest, respectable members of so
ciety, and fails to prevent the illegal acquisi
tion of weapons. Passing anti-gun legislation
will only serve to eliminate guns from the
homes of citizens into whose hands we
should entrust the guns in the first place. The
criminal component of society will continue
to find weapons as it always has: in a criminal
manner.
To end with an intriguing thought: as stu
dents, we are obviously horrified at the trav
esty of recent school shootings. What if,
among the shooter's victims, there had been
one armed, trained student? Guns should not
be taken lightly, but if we break free from the
political debate and consider their value to
social order, perhaps we can actually succeed
in making society safer.
