# STRANGELY CHARMING
## Hoover Power 
### Jack Cackler 
âœ“" A years ago this week, the Hoover
Dam opened to become the world's
I largest hydroelectric dam. Original
ly called Boulder Dam, the project was
named in honor of President Herbert
Hoover '95 (allegedly the first Stanford stu
dent ever), who helped design the project
while he was still the Secretary of Commerce.
Unlike the economy during the Hoover Ad
ministration, the water in the dam was in
tended to go downhill, through turbines, sup
plying power and water to California and
Nevada. While there were some environ
mental consequences from the dam, the
abundant clean energy it provided has more
than made up for its impact. The Dam pro
vides the same amount of power (4 TWhr)
every year as 100 million gallons of gas. De
spite an otherwise rocky career, and with all
due respect to our overlords in his tower, the
Hoover Dam is probably Hoover's best con
tribution to society.
Developing clean sources of energy will be

a key challenge for the scientific community
over the coming decades. Even for the few
holdouts that are not convinced of the poten
tial time bomb of anthropogenic climate
change, there are a multitude of boons that af
fordable, renewable energy provides. Provid
ing a means for anybody to generate energy
sustainably will help reduce global poverty
and ease international tensions. While there

are many technologies being
explored, I would like to talk about
some of the latest advances in solar
technology that could potentially be
even more monumental than the
Hoover Dam.

In a nutshell, solar energy can be
harnessed by capturing photons
from sunlight, and converting their
energy into electrical energy in a
process called the photovoltaic
effect. The most common materials
used to capture photons are semi
conductors. Incident photons on
these materials induce an electric
current which then travels through
power lines to power your laptop.
Currently, the best solar cells in the
world can convert only around 43
percent of sunlight into electrical
energy, so there is significant room
for improvement.
Two weeks ago, researchers at
Caltech announced that they suc
cessfully synthesized flexible solar
cells that are much cheaper than
conventional cells. Rather than
being composed of sheets of semi
conductor wafers, the new cells are
made up of a polymer with millions
of nanowires made out of silicon
inside (picture raw spaghetti frozen
in jello). This affords the cells flexi
bility, and also makes them much
cheaper to produce silicon is
among the most expensive elements
of a cell, and these cells require only
about two percent of the typical
amount. As an added benefit, by
varying the makeup of the wires, the
researchers were able to make them
tremendously efficient, surpassing
what was thought to be the theoret
ical light-trapping limit, and absorb
ing 96 percent of incident sunlight at
the most efficient wavelength, as
well as capturing sunlight across the
spectrum. This technology is cur
rently being scaled up and could be
employed commercially within a
couple of years.
In contrast to pushing modern
technology to its limit, researchers at
Oregon State have turned to more
atavistic solutions to achieve similar
effects by employing diatoms, tiny
unicellular algae that have remained
fairly constant for the last 100 mil
lion years. They are generally coated
with a protective crystalline layer of
silica. Gregory Rorrer and his team
at Oregon State removed the
diatoms from their shells and
replaced the inside of the shells with
titanium oxide (People for the

Ethical Treatment of Diatoms
should be calling any minute). By
inserting these shells into a dye, the
team developed an affordable and
efficient way of harvesting solar
energy using tools that have been
around for millions of years.
Another example comes from
Broadband Solar, a Bay Area
Startup founded by Stanford materi
als science and engineering Prof.
Mark Brongersma, which has
recently developed a clever coating
made up of amorphous silicon that
can increase the efficiency of thin
film solar cells by up to 50 percent.
Amorphous silicon is cheap and
abundant, and when applied to the
surface of a solar cell, can help direct
photons onto the cell and trap them
there, resulting in the formation of a
surface plasmon essentially a
strong interaction between the pho
ton and the material that can induce
a strong current. While most of the
work has been modeled through
computer simulations, Broadband is
looking to develop these technolo
gies in the coming years.
Stanford is at the epicenter in
both time and space of the quest to
provide clean, affordable, renewable
energy to the planet. While every
option should be explored, solar
technology has vast potential for
improvement, and Stanford has a
long history of innovation in the
field of solar research. The Stanford
Solar Wind and Energy Project, the
Atmosphere/Energy program and a
slew of other programs at Stanford
are passing solar milestones left and
right, and the Stanford Solar Car
Team is pushing us closer to the day
where we never have to pay for gas
again.
And that, oh weather gods, is why
it should stop raining.

At least we have a lake this year. Let
Jack know if you have a rowboat at
