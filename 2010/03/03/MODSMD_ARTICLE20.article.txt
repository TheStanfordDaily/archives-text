## Why Interfaith? Why Malaria? Why Now? 
### ANAND VENKATKRISHNAN '10 
In a recent article for the Huffington Post,
Dr. Eboo Patel, this year's Baccalaureate
Speaker, wrote that "At a time of a reli
gious revival, a youth bulge and an increase
in interaction between people from different
backgrounds, religion can be a bomb, a bub
ble, a barrier or a bridge...The raw materials
of [the last] approach are simple: this is how
my religion inspires me to build understand
ing and cooperation with people who are dif
ferent." Whether this difference lies across
lines of race, class, gender, sexual orientation,
or religion, Eboo insists that there is a theol
ogy of the bridge built into faith traditions
and their heroes: from Rev. Dr. King to Bad

shah Khan. How we are able to help heal the
world's brokenness, from extreme poverty to
state-sanctioned violence to ecological disas
ter, will depend increasingly on this alterna
tive narrative of faiths in action.

Within the international development
discourse, religion is often seen as a retardant
to growth and progress. We've all heard the
tropes: the refusal of safe-sex education, un
witting legitimization of cultural imperial
ism, brutal suppression of women's and
queer rights. But this isn't the only story; and
most importantly, not the one we could be
writing instead. The courageous
example of Christian and Muslim
Liberian women, standing together
against the violence that ravaged
that country in the early part of this
decade, serves for me as a constant
guide.
In the context of sub-Saharan
Africa, churches and mosques are
often the most robust and visible
organizations in rural communities.
Their proximate knowledge of local
situations is invaluable, and their
high standing provides a natural
health education and healthcare
distribution platform. Hence,
empowering these local community
leaders to work together in com
mon action for the common good
must be a strong component of any
projects related to the United
Nations Millennium Development
Goals. Perhaps the clearest indica
tion of this potential is in light of the
sixth MDG: eradicating deaths due
to malaria.
Malaria is one of the most egre
gious killers on the planet, because
it is entirely preventable. The dis
ease is tied very closely to the other
MDGs because it is so prevalent.
Sub-Saharan Africa hemorrhages
an estimated $l2 billion USD each
year in GDP through this loss of
productivity, further compounding
problems of poverty. Many parents
have to choose between treating the
infected in their family or eating.
Educating women about the disease
and how to protect their families
increases their standing and impor
tance in the community. Malaria

touches almost all of the other
MDGs. Were it to be eliminated, the
other goals would be that much eas
ier to achieve.
Mosquitoes are equal-opportu
nity offenders. For them, the blood
of a Christian is just as sweet as
that of a Muslim or an atheist or a
Sikh. The Bay Area Against
Malaria campaign is a collabora
tion this year between interfaith
and malaria activists across five
Bay Area campuses, raising funds
and awareness for Malaria No
More. Our movement all about
ordinary people, of all faiths and
none, doing something extraordi
nary. Together, we can eradicate
deaths from malaria.
