# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
The Mar. 1 Stanford Daily reported that a
student was seriously injured after jumping
from a building during the Chilean earth
quake. This incident provides a hard-earned
lesson in earthquake safety. You almost al
ways put yourself in more danger by running
during earthquake and especially by jumping
from windows and balconies. It is best to get
under table or desk and hang on. Running out
side makes you a target for falling glass, tiles,
and cornices. Collapse of buildings in locali
ties, including California and Chili, with effec
tive earthquake codes is extremely rare. Al
most all of the 2 million Chileans who stayed
put survived. Fleeing outside is advisable only
if you are unfortunate enough to be on the
first floor of an unengineered structure with a
heavy roof as in Haiti. Additional detailed re
liable safety tips are available at www.earth
quakecountry.org/dropcoverholdon and

Mr. Nixon's Mar. 2 piece about volunteer
ing abroad stressed the importance of "sus
tainable development" which requires "com
mitment to a community" as well as the will
ingness "to listen to the needs of other peo
ple." Effective public service absolutely rests
on these core principles which is why vol
unteering for a week in a developing country
is NOT effective service. How can volunteers
make an impact in a country like Guatemala
with minimal knowledge of the economic
and social factors that have created the prob
lems they are trying to fix? And what hap
pens after that week in Guatemala? Volun
teers get to return to their normal lives (with
something new to add to a resume), but the
problems they made minimal impact on are
still there. This is not to say that volunteering
abroad is not useful to anyone; it often awak
ens a passion for service that can follow a stu
dent through life. But to suggest that a week
of volunteering can somehow "change the
world" reduces the problems of an entire
country to something that can be understood
and fixed in a matter of days. It is very impor
tant for students to "open their eyes" to the
world beyond our campus, but this can just as
easily be done with the myriad of volunteer
opportunities in our community. A longer,
more serious commitment to a child
in a tutoring program or a young
person in a mentor program is a
much more effective and important
way in which Stanford students can
use their talents to help a larger
community. Not only are they
working in an environment they are
familiar with, but students can form
relationships that will have a more
long-lasting impact on everyone
involved. So, to those students that
are reading this letter, I suggest this:
have fun on your spring break, and
consider volunteering a couple of
hours a week in Palo Alto or EPA
during the school year.
