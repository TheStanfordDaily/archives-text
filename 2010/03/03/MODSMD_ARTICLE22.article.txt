## Lax splits tough tests 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 15 Stanford women's lacrosse team
hosted two ranked teams last weekend, learn
ing some lessons in an 18-11 loss to top-ranked
Northwestern and finding success in an 11-10
overtime victory over No. 19 Ohio State.
Against the No. 1 Wildcats on Friday, the
Cardinal showed that it is able to hang with the
top teams in the nation. This game and the
team's performance are especially important
after last season, when the Card was left out of
the NCAA Tournament after not receiving an
at-large bid. Although the MPSF has an auto
matic bid this year, Stanford still wants to show
it is capable of competing with the powerhous
es from the East.

The Card certainly showed a lot of fight
against the Wildcats, and, although the final
score tells a slightly different story, Stanford
was within reach of Northwestern for most of
the game.

"I enjoyed playing the No. 1 team in the
country because it showed us (and everyone
else) that we can compete at the top level," said
sophomore defender Catherine Swanson.
"TTie game was within 2-3 goals for a majority
of the time, and we even tied the game up at one
point."

The Cardinal got off to a slow start in the
match, tying the Wildcats at one apiece before
three Northwestern goals put the team down
4-1. However, Stanford was able to hold even

with the Cats for the rest of the half and en
tered halftime down 9-6. In the second half, the
Cardinal showed flashes of brilliance as it en
gineered a four-goal comeback, including two
by senior midfielder Julie Christie, to tie it up
at 10 all.
"We were confident in our skill and re-

Women's lacrosse lost a hard-fought match to Northwestern at home last weekend, but came back to defeat Ohio State in overtime two days
later. The team will take on Davidson tomorrow as it continues to try to prove itself worthy of an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.
mained calm and just kept fighting
and didn't give up," said junior mid
fielder Leslie Foard of the Cardinal's
ability to erase deficits, something it
was forced to do against Ohio State as
well. "It helps that we have a really
well-rounded, talented team with a lot
of people who can make big plays and
contribute, so if one person is off,
there is always someone else able to
step up."
However, once the Cardinal tied
things up, Northwestern took control
and showed why it has won the last
five national titles. Led by senior Kat
rina Dowd, who had five total goals,
the Northwestern offense unleashed
a flurry of scoring on the Card, in
creasing its lead to 14-10 before fresh
man midfielder Carolyn Bradley
scored for the Card to make it 14-11.
Northwestern ended the game with
four more goals to make the final
score 18-11 and secure the win, al
though the Card certainly got some
thing out of the experience.
"Playing Northwestern was awe
some," Foard said. "The game made
us better and [made us] realize what
we have to fix in order to win [those]
kind of games, but also that game
showed us we are able to play with the
best teams in the country."
On Sunday, the Cardinal was again
challenged by one of the top teams in
the country, and this time it came
away with a victory.
Against the Buckeyes, the Cardi
nal once again found itself down by

three goals early before scoring four
goals to enter half time down 6-4. In
the second half, the Cardinal came out
firing with senior attacker Claire
Hubbard and Swanson scoring to cut
the Ohio State lead to one. However,
the Buckeyes came right back and
quickly scored twice to go up by three
again with less than 10 minutes to go.
But, once again, the Cardinal showed
its toughness and resolve, scoring
three goals before the five-minute
mark to tie the game up at nine and
eventually send it into overtime.
In the first overtime period, the
Cardinal used its momentum to jump
out to an early two-goal lead, but
Ohio State would not go away. In the
second overtime, the Buckeyes
scored early, but were unable to get
past keeper Annie Read to get the
tying goal.
Up next, the Card will try to con
tinue its success against Davidson and
No. 13 Vanderbilt at home.

"For next weekend, we just need to
be consistent," Foard said. "We are re
ally talented, and this past weekend
we demonstrated great moments, so
we just need to play with that intensi
ty and domination for the entire
game. We need to go out and own the
entire game."

The Cardinal will relish the chance
to prove itself yet again this weekend
and hopes to channel its momentum
into some positive results.
The game against Davidson will
start at 4 p.m. this Thursday, while the
Vanderbilt match begins at 1 p.m. on
Sunday. Both matches will take place
at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
