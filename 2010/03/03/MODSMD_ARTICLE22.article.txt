## Lax splits tough tests

The No. 15 Stanford women's lacrosse team
hosted two ranked teams last weekend, learn
ing some lessons in an 18-11 loss to top-ranked

tered halftime down 9-6. In the second half, the
Cardinal showed flashes of brilliance as it en
gineered a four-goal comeback, including two
by senior midfielder Julie Christie, to tie it up
at 10 all.
