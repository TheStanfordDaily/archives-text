GAME NOTES ! The women's water polo team will
try to bounce back from its first loss of the season
this weekend with home matches against San
Diego State on Friday and UC-lrvine on Satur
day. The Cardinal is looking to regroup after last
weekend's Irvine Invitational, in which the team
won its first three matches handily but could not
overcome a slow start in the final, eventually
falling to USC 10-6.

points to the scoreboard. Seidemann,
Dunlevie, Dries and Krueger each
smashed in a goal of their own. Junior
goalkeeper Amber Oland blocked an
impressive six shots, while Hall added
another two saves.
On Sunday, the Cardinal began the
day with a match against UCLA. The
Cardinal once again started strong as
a prevalent team effort contributed to
a successful victory: Stanford over
came the Bruins by a final score at 10-
4.
Holshouser, Krueger and Steffens
each smashed two goals into the net
while Eaton, Lo, Menon and Seide
mann each tacked on another point.
Oland saved a total of six shots while
Baldoni had four saves of her own.
"Our game against UCLA was a
big statement of the type of team that
we could be," Oland said. "We played
strong in all parts of the game, and that
is how we need to play every game."
Later on, the Cardinal faced off
with the Trojans: this time, however,
the Cardinal did not play as well, ulti
mately leading to the team's first loss
of the season.
"In our last game against SC, we
simply weren't able to execute,"
Krueger said. "We had been playing at
a high level all weekend, and in our
last game, we just couldn't find that
rhythm, and we weren't clicking in any
phase of the game."
Instead of the Cardinal having a
strong start this game, the Trojans
were quick to score.
"We let USC score 10 goals, eight
in the first half," Krueger said. "If we
expect to win important games, we
can't let our opponents score 10 goals.
We're definitely going to have to take
a look at our defense, and see where
we can tighten things up."
The team sensed that this game
was different, and is already thinking
about how to improve for its next
match.

"I felt like our team came out
ready to play for all of the first three
games," Baldoni said. "We showed up
with an attitude that showed in our
play. It showed that we were going
after the other team. I don't think we
came out in the final game against
USC with the same attitude to win."
"I think our team needs to contin
ue to work on our defense," she con
tinued. "Defense is a very key part to
this sport, and a strong defense leads
to a good offense. We may have lost
our No. 1 spot, but this was just one
game. If anything, this game has put

fire in us for the next time we play
them."

The Cardinal seemed to be in such
a hole, down 8-2 by half time, that a win
did not seem to be in sight.

"This weekend USC came out re
ally tough, and we didn't," Oland said.
"It took us a while to get going, and by
that time it was too late. [But] the fact
that we held them to only two goals
the rest of the game while we scored
four is really encouraging moving for
ward."

In the match, Eaton and Lo each
scored a pair of goals, while Dries and

Holshouser each tacked on a single
point. Oland saved four goals, while
Baldoni saved five.

The Cardinal seems optimistic that
this loss will only motivate it further in
its goal to capture NCAA and MPSF
championships.
"The outcome this weekend only
meant that we lost our No. 1 ranking,"
Oland said. "If anything, it has moti
vated us even more to work hard and
to come back out and show what this
team is really about. If we do that, we
will still have a good shot at the title."
"If anything, I think this loss should

help us prepare for NCAAs and
MPSFs," Krueger added. "We know
what we need to work on, and we will
be able to carry this feeling through
out the rest of the season as motiva
tion."

Stanford will use this loss to moti
vate itself further in its attempt to win
NCAA and MPSF titles. The Cardi
nal's next match will be against San
Diego State at the Avery Aquatic
Center at 4 p.m. on Friday.
