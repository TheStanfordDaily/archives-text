# SWIMMING FOR THE STREAK
## Card looking for 29th consecutive Pac-10 title 
### CHRIS DERRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The last time the Cardinal men's swimming
and diving team lost a Pac-10 Championship,
they were still known as the Cardinals, the aver
age movie ticket was $2.87 and Ronald Reagan
had just been inaugurated for the first time. It has
been 28 consecutive victories for swimming head
coach Skip Kenney, diving coach Dr. Rick
Schavone and the Stanford men, a streak that
they will look to continue at this weekend's con
ference championships.
The No. 3 Cardinal will have a rough go of it
against No. 1 Arizona and No. 4 California. The
Wildcats beat the Cardinal in a dual meet at
Avery Aquatic Center on Jan. 23. On Feb. 20, the
Cardinal edged out Cal by just four points.
Stanford has previously fended off strong
challenges to its crown. Arizona won the nation
al title in 2008, but could not best the Cardinal at
Pac-lOs. Generally, top swim teams will only peak
for two meets all year: one during the season in
order to get NCAA qualifying marks and then
again for the NCAA meet. While the Cardinal is
using Pac-lOs as its opportunity to swim fast
times, Arizona has already rested once this year
and may decide, as it has in the past, to rest more
for NCAAs than Pac-lOs.
The Cardinal will also be faced with balancing
its focus; the streak is important to the program,
but NCAAs are still the most important meet of
the year for any team.
"Obviously there is a bit of pressure from the
28-year streak, as no team wants to be the one to
break it," explained senior David Dunford.
"However, our primary focus for the season is
still on NCAAs."
If Stanford is to pull off the upset and keep the
streak alive, it will have to rely on its experience.
Upperclassmen Eugene Godsoe, Alex Coville,
Dunford and David Mosko will all be called
upon for big production.

Godsoe is one of the nation's top backstro
kers and has also contributed in the butterfly and

on freestyle relays. He is the defending Pac-10
champion in both the 100- and 200-yard back
stroke.

Dunford and Coville are Stanford's best
sprinters. Though neither appears capable of
challenging Nathan Adrian of Cal, one of the best
sprinters in the country if not the world, each was
a member of two Pac-10-winning relays last year
and will look to match the feat.
Mosko is one of the Cardinal's best distance
and butterfly swimmers. He will most likely be
called upon in the 200- and 500-yard freestyle and
the 200-yard butterfly. Sophomore Bobby Bollier
is the defending champion in the 200-yard butter
fly, and will be joining Mosko in that race.
The Cardinal has been led this season by a trio
of sophomore distance swimmers in Chad La

Tourette, Michael Zoldos and Trevor Scheid.
Against both Cal and Arizona, they swept at least
one of the distance swims. La Tourette is the de
fending champion in the 1650-yard freestyle.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, there are only
two distance swims at major championships, the
500- and 1650-yard freestyle. Championship
meets extend over three or more days and there
fore include many more relays and sprint events
than dual meets. As a result, a greater emphasis is
placed on depth and sprint strength than in dual
meets for instance, four of the five relays are
sprint relays.

lowed to swim a maximum of three individual

With the divers having already competed last week, the Pac-10 championships will conclude with
swimming over the next four days. Stanford is trying to win its 29th championship in a row.
events and four relays," Dunford ex
plained. "This means that there is a
larger emphasis on the sprint events,
and the meets tend to be more de
manding of sprinters."
Though the swimming champi
onships do not start until tonight, the
diving portion of the meet was held
this past weekend in Washington.

Stanford was once again without sen
ior All-American Dwight Dumais,
who is out with a shoulder injury. Ju
nior Brent Eichenseer shouldered the
load for the Cardinal, taking third in
the three-meter (382.00) and platform
(391.85) and fourth in the one-meter
(386.85).
Swimming competition begins
tonight at 6 p.m. and ends on Saturday
evening. The meet will take place in
Long Beach, Calif
