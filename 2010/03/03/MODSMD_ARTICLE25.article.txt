# HEAD-TO-HEAD: Should Stanford bring back the Indian mascot?
## Cardinal is lame, but Indian is worse 
### Dan Bohm 
Let me start by saying that by no
means do I believe the Cardinal
to be a good mascot. It isn't a
mascot, it's a freaking color, and
it sucks. That said, it is better than
the Indian.
As you probably know, from 1930 until
1972, Stanford was known as the Indians.
The Indian at Stanford was manifested
through a long-nosed mascot that per
formed at sporting events. In the early 19705,
American Indian groups on campus peti
tioned to change the mascot because they
found the Indian to be offensive in how it
stereotyped and mocked American Indian
religious practice and culture.
That was then, however, and given the
lameness of Stanford's current mascot,
maybe going back to the Indians makes
sense.
But why was Stanford the Indians in the
first place? Stanford and Palo Alto aren't
exactly a mecca of American Indian history
and culture. There is nothing that ties the
founding of Stanford University in 1891 to
American Indians, nor were its founders,
Leland and Jane Stanford, at all involved
with American Indian groups.
In fact, the prevalent image of an Indian
in battle within American culture is not a
flattering one, nor is it brave. During the pe
riod in which Stanford was the Indians,
American Indians were seen in popular cul
ture as the bad guys in Western movies who
always lost in battle at the hands of heroes
played by John Wayne (and others). In fact,
very seldom in American popular culture
are American Indians the victors. Now this
itself is an injustice, but it also doesn't help
create any sort of intimidation when it
comes to competing on the sports fields.
The main reason, however, that the Indi
an is not an appropriate mascot for Stanford
is because it is downright offensive. The term
"Indian" itself is no longer seen as political
ly correct, with the preferred nomenclature
being American Indian. As a progressive
university, Stanford cannot have an un-PC
mascot, and the Stanford American Indians
doesn't quite have a ring to it.
Why is it offensive to be the Indians, you
may ask.

First off, using a people as a mascot per
petuates a massive amount of stereotypes.
Look at the Cleveland Indians' mascot,
Chief Wahoo. He is an American Indian,
with a long nose and a headdress on. When
he is shown, fans take an open palm to their
mouths and make "ow" sounds. This paints
a picture of American Indians as savage and
uncivilized. What makes it more disturbing
is that there are American Indian students
and faculty at the University that show just
