# HEAD-TO-HEAD: Should Stanford bring back the Indian mascot?
## Cardinal is lame, but Indian is worse 
### Dan Bohm 
Let me start by saying that by no
means do I believe the Cardinal
to be a good mascot. It isn't a
mascot, it's a freaking color, and
it sucks. That said, it is better than
the Indian.
As you probably know, from 1930 until
1972, Stanford was known as the Indians.
The Indian at Stanford was manifested
through a long-nosed mascot that per
formed at sporting events. In the early 19705,
American Indian groups on campus peti
tioned to change the mascot because they
found the Indian to be offensive in how it
stereotyped and mocked American Indian
religious practice and culture.
That was then, however, and given the
lameness of Stanford's current mascot,
maybe going back to the Indians makes
sense.
But why was Stanford the Indians in the
first place? Stanford and Palo Alto aren't
exactly a mecca of American Indian history
and culture. There is nothing that ties the
founding of Stanford University in 1891 to
American Indians, nor were its founders,
Leland and Jane Stanford, at all involved
with American Indian groups.
In fact, the prevalent image of an Indian
in battle within American culture is not a
flattering one, nor is it brave. During the pe
riod in which Stanford was the Indians,
American Indians were seen in popular cul
ture as the bad guys in Western movies who
always lost in battle at the hands of heroes
played by John Wayne (and others). In fact,
very seldom in American popular culture
are American Indians the victors. Now this
itself is an injustice, but it also doesn't help
create any sort of intimidation when it
comes to competing on the sports fields.
The main reason, however, that the Indi
an is not an appropriate mascot for Stanford
is because it is downright offensive. The term
"Indian" itself is no longer seen as political
ly correct, with the preferred nomenclature
being American Indian. As a progressive
university, Stanford cannot have an un-PC
mascot, and the Stanford American Indians
doesn't quite have a ring to it.
Why is it offensive to be the Indians, you
may ask.

First off, using a people as a mascot per
petuates a massive amount of stereotypes.
Look at the Cleveland Indians' mascot,
Chief Wahoo. He is an American Indian,
with a long nose and a headdress on. When
he is shown, fans take an open palm to their
mouths and make "ow" sounds. This paints
a picture of American Indians as savage and
uncivilized. What makes it more disturbing
is that there are American Indian students
and faculty at the University that show just
how wrong that stereotype is, and they
are stuck being ridiculed by it.
Second, mascots are almost exclu
sively animals, so calling a team the In
dians is essentially likening American
Indians to animals. Outside of Ameri
can Indian based mascots and other
ethnic (and also offensive) mascots
such as the Fighting Irish and Ragin'
Cajuns, humans aren't mascots (private
religious colleges are the one excep
tion). Mascots are reserved for subhu
man groups: Panthers, Tigers, Hawks,
Eagles. You don't see anyone arguing
for Stanford to be called the Stanford
Anglo-Saxon Protestants. That would
be offensive. So why would the Stan
ford Indians not be offensive?

Taking that point a step further,
imagine if Stanford chose a different
ethnic minority to have as its mascot. So
Stanford could be the Stanford Blacks

and its mascot would be dressed in
blackface and urban attire; would peo
ple think that is all right? How about if
Stanford was the Stanford Gays and
the mascot wore rainbows; would that
be appropriate?
I don't think many of you would say
yes, but when an Indian mascot dresses
in stereotypical Indian attire and struts
around, it is essentially doing the same
thing depicting a minority group in a
way that does not represent the full re
ality of that group. How is that okay?
Having the Indian as a mascot cre
ates other problems as well. Imagine
opposing crowds chanting "Indians
suck," or "kill the Indians" at sporting
events. I'm sure American Indians on
campus would feel great about that.

And then there is the mascot itself.
Right now, Stanford has the tree, which
is about as benign a symbol as you can
get, yet the tree still manages to routine
ly offend the masses. I can't imagine the
trouble the mascot would get in if he
were dressed as an Indian.

So your question to me is probably,
"If Cardinal is terrible, and Indians is off

limits, what should Stanford be?"
Well, what the student body voted
for back in the '7os when the Indian was
removed was the Robber Barons a
reference to Leland Stanford and also a
creative, somewhat intimidating mas
cot.

It was shot down because calling Le
land Stanford a robber was not deemed
alright, though I would argue that given
his history and the time that has passed,
being the Robber Barons would, in a
strange way, pay homage to Leland
Stanford. Have the Monopoly man as
Stanford's mascot, and it would be a fun
little play both on how Stanford de
grees make you richer than opponents
and on Leland Stanford himself

If Robber Barons is offensive, how
about just the Barons? That seems like
a sweet name, and it is definitely better
than being the Indians or just a measly
color.

Dan Bohm really just wants to dress up
as Mr. Monopoly. Tell him where to
find a good top hat at bohmd@stan

Right now, Stanford has the tree, which
is about as benign a symbol as you can
get, yet the tree still manages to routine
ly offend the masses. I can't imagine the
trouble the mascot would get in if he
were dressed as an Indian.

So your question to me is probably,
"If Cardinal is terrible, and Indians is off

limits, what should Stanford be?"
Well, what the student body voted
for back in the '7os when the Indian was
removed was the Robber Barons a
reference to Leland Stanford and also a
creative, somewhat intimidating mas
cot.

It was shot down because calling Le
land Stanford a robber was not deemed
alright, though I would argue that given
his history and the time that has passed,
being the Robber Barons would, in a
strange way, pay homage to Leland
Stanford. Have the Monopoly man as
Stanford's mascot, and it would be a fun
little play both on how Stanford de
grees make you richer than opponents
and on Leland Stanford himself

If Robber Barons is offensive, how
about just the Barons? That seems like
a sweet name, and it is definitely better
than being the Indians or just a measly
color.

Dan Bohm really just wants to dress up
as Mr. Monopoly. Tell him where to
find a good top hat at bohmd@stan
ford.edu.
