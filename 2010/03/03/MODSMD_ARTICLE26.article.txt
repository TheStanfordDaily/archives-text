Pop quiz:
1. Where are the Iroquois tribes from?
2. Where are the Apache from?
3. Finally, where are the Seminoles
from?
Answers: New York, the Southwest and
Florida.

Unless you're still up on your AP
U.S. History, there's a good
chance you only knew the an
swer to question number
three. The Seminoles did not
have a bigger impact than the Iroquois or
Apaches, yet they are one of the few tribes
the average American can place on a map.
Why? The Seminoles have a major
sports team named after them. Be honest
with yourself: if it wasn't for Florida State,
you probably would be just as clueless about
the Seminoles' location.
Same goes for the Illini (University of
Illinois), Blackhawks (NHL's Chicago fran
chise) and the Utes (University of Utah).
Blame it on poor education, lack of
media attention or pop culture indifference,
but Native Americans are quickly becoming
a forgotten people. Sports are some of the
last bastions where Native American tribes
can gain recognition.
The problem is, of course, that not all of
that recognition is positive. Over-the-top in
sensitive mascots, offensive team names
such as "Redskins" and traditions like the
tomahawk chop contribute to the stereo
typical view of the Native American as a
backward, dumb and violent person.
This doesn't have to be the case.
Sports have the power to enhance a rep
utation. Used correctly, Native American
based team names and mascots can teach
the history of a tribe, promote its culture
and, most importantly, remind the public
that the tribe still in fact exists.
It's time for Stanford to bring back the
Indian.
In 1972, Stanford University officially
dropped its Indian mascot, and in 1981,
adopted the color "Cardinal." All Native
American imagery was removed from the
campus. Local high schools quickly fol
lowed suit, eliminating their own Native
American names and mascots.
It's as if Native Americans were never a
part of the Bay Area's history. Now, the
biggest (and practically only) reminder of
Native American history are Indian casinos.
We must do better.
A Native American mascot is not inher
ently racist. Yes, Prince Lightfoot (Stan
ford's former mascot) was an abomination
