Pop quiz:
1. Where are the Iroquois tribes from?
2. Where are the Apache from?
3. Finally, where are the Seminoles
from?
Answers: New York, the Southwest and
Florida.

Unless you're still up on your AP
U.S. History, there's a good
chance you only knew the an
swer to question number
three. The Seminoles did not
have a bigger impact than the Iroquois or
Apaches, yet they are one of the few tribes
the average American can place on a map.
Why? The Seminoles have a major
sports team named after them. Be honest
with yourself: if it wasn't for Florida State,
you probably would be just as clueless about
the Seminoles' location.
Same goes for the Illini (University of
Illinois), Blackhawks (NHL's Chicago fran
chise) and the Utes (University of Utah).
Blame it on poor education, lack of
media attention or pop culture indifference,
but Native Americans are quickly becoming
a forgotten people. Sports are some of the
last bastions where Native American tribes
can gain recognition.
The problem is, of course, that not all of
that recognition is positive. Over-the-top in
sensitive mascots, offensive team names
such as "Redskins" and traditions like the
tomahawk chop contribute to the stereo
typical view of the Native American as a
backward, dumb and violent person.
This doesn't have to be the case.
Sports have the power to enhance a rep
utation. Used correctly, Native American
based team names and mascots can teach
the history of a tribe, promote its culture
and, most importantly, remind the public
that the tribe still in fact exists.
It's time for Stanford to bring back the
Indian.
In 1972, Stanford University officially
dropped its Indian mascot, and in 1981,
adopted the color "Cardinal." All Native
American imagery was removed from the
campus. Local high schools quickly fol
lowed suit, eliminating their own Native
American names and mascots.
It's as if Native Americans were never a
part of the Bay Area's history. Now, the
biggest (and practically only) reminder of
Native American history are Indian casinos.
We must do better.
A Native American mascot is not inher
ently racist. Yes, Prince Lightfoot (Stan
ford's former mascot) was an abomination
with his oversized nose, unibrow and
feathers in his hair. Yet no rule exists
saying that all Indian mascots have to
be caricatures of Native Americans.
Return to Florida State and its mas
cot Chief Osceola. Chief Osceola was
a Seminole war hero who led attacks
on federal troops during the 1830s.
FSU worked with the Seminole tribe
to ensure that the mascot's costume
and dances are historically accurate.
As a result, the Seminole tribe counts
itself as one of Florida State's biggest
fans.
Why can't a similar arrangement
be set up at Stanford?
There are tons of local tribes in the
area. Why not choose one of them to
work closely with? Collaborate with
the tribe to design a mascot that is cul
turally and historically correct and that
energizes the crowd the purpose of
a mascot in the first place, and some
thing the color cardinal could never
do.
The Muwekma House could work
in tandem with the tribe to host infor
mational talks and activities about the
traditions of that tribe.
The Athletic Department could
host fundraisers and charity events for
the tribe to benefit schooling and
health care for the often-impoverished
Native American tribesman and
women.
The tribe could perform during
halftime shows at football and basket
ball games, displaying different aspects
of its culture and customs.
Bottom line: both sides can benefit.
The student body will receive a mascot
it can take pride in, a mascot that can
fire up the crowd during home games,
a mascot that can become a symbol of
this university and give back to the
community.
The Native American tribe will re
ceive recognition, money, prominence
and respect. The tribe will be thrust
back into the national spotlight where
it would be more able to advocate for
its policies.
Even when we bring back the Indi
an, we can still keep the notorious
Stanford Tree. The Tree is the Band's
mascot, not the University's mascot.
All the high jinks, shenanigans and
pranks the Tree pulls off now would
stay.

Stanford would receive a second
mascot more equipped to handle the
pressures of representing an athletic
and academic powerhouse. The Native
Americans would not be forgotten.

Mike Lazarus is unaware that the
Blackhawks are named after Chief
Black Hawk, not the Blackhawk tribe.
