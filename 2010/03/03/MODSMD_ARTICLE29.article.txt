# MEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Sweet senior day for Card 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Cardinal defeated
the top-seeded University of Michi
gan Wolverines 361.4-352.15 on Sat
urday evening in Stanford men's gym
nastics' last home meet of 2010.
Saturday's win was a sweet victory
for most of the Cardinal men, who
pulled out all the stops to deliver their
best performances yet and to post
the country's season-high team score.
But while the event was spectacu
lar for the Cardinal and its fans, it was
also a bittersweet farewell for its sen
iors, who competed in their last colle
giate meet on home turf.
Seniors Eric Hergenrader, Nick
Noone and Lucas Hughes, along with
redshirt senior and co-captain Greg
Ter-Zakhariants, were honored by
their families, friends and fellow
teammates during Saturday evening's
festivities.
According to head coach Thorn
Glielmi, the meet showcased the sen
iors' "athletic, academic and working
exploits."
For those four men, gymnastics life

at Stanford has been full of uncertain
ups and downs. Before a packed
house at Burnham Pavilion on Satur
day night, the four let their stories un
fold.

Hergenrader, one of Stanford's
most solid pommel competitors, has
spent the last four years being over
shadowed by his all-around team
mates. Despite last year's team cham
pionship in which he contributed a
solid pommel set, Hergenrader still
feels he has much to prove. In his last
home meet at Stanford, he proved just
how much he had to contribute on
pommel, floor and vault.
Noone, meanwhile, has forever
been known as the still rings and par
allel bars expert, no doubt thanks to
his extremely muscular physique.
And while he has certainly been a
force on both events, Noone should
also be known as the man who com
mitted himself to making Stanford
men's gymnastics a visible force. It is
partially thanks to his efforts that at
tendance at the Cardinal's meets has
nearly tripled this year an undeni
able feat for a sport that often gets
overlooked.

Hughes himself almost got over
looked. After two shoulder surgeries in
2007 and 2008, his physicians and
coaches came to the realization that
Hughes' gymnastics life would never
be the same. For a while, it even seemed
like there would be no gymnastics life
for him at all. But after months of reha
bilitation, meditation and sheer grunt
work, this senior returned on just one
event pommel horse â€”to bid a
heartfelt farewell to the sport.
And finally, Ter-Zakhariants said
goodbye. The "super senior" who
spent his freshman year nursing his
broken neck, and the past two years
fighting a bulged disc in his lower
back, has perhaps trained the least of
his teammates this year, but has
fought to join the lineup. And on Sat
urday, he ended his collegiate career
at home on his much-loved pommel
horse.

Besides hearing and watching
those four men perform, the rest of the
night flowed in true gymnastics style.
Starting out on floor exercise, Her
genrader set the tone with a strong
final pass, while juniors Alex
Buscaglia, Tim Gentry and Abhinav
Ramani followed with their own
clean and solid routines.

On pommel horse the Cardi
nal's most dreaded event the usu
ally reliable veteran Ter-Zakhariants
got the team off to shaky start. How
ever, Hughes brought Stanford back
to life with a solid 14.1, while sopho
more John Martin delivered the set
he has been waiting for all season,
earning a 15.4 and contributing to the
team's season-high event score of
58.4. But, according to Glielmi, the
gymnasts "still have room to im
prove."

Next, the Cardinal men displayed
their sheer strength on still rings, with
Gentry and freshman James Fosco
posting scores of over 15.0 each.
Speaking specifically about Fosco,
Glielmi said, "His flawless strength is
impressive,"

According to Glielmi, his men still
have the ability to do better. Junior
Ryan Lieberman needs to perfect his
new and more complicated dis
mount, while Noone has yet to add
his.

On vault, the Cardinal posted an
event record of 64.25. On parallel
bars, Noone stole the show by hitting
a difficult set that earned him a score
of 15.35. And finally, on high bar,
Buscaglia and Ramani both complet
ed complicated and dizzying routines
that earned them scores of 15.4 and
15.1, respectively.
Next up, Stanford has a busy
weekend ahead with a tri-meet
against the Air Force Academy and
the University of Illinois-Chicago at
Air Force on Friday and another tri
meet against the University of Ne
braska and the University of Okla
homa at Nebraska on Sunday.
