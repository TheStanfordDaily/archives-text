## TB testing lab built in N.Korea Stanford team travels to improve disease prevention 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A team of Stanford medical pro
fessors and researchers are now
shedding light on a nearly unprece
dented month-long trip to North
Korea in November to help develop
the first drug-resistant tuberculosis
diagnostic lab in Pyongyang, the
nation's capital.
The team, consisting of 22 mem
bers chosen from Stanford and Bay
Area tuberculosis centers, traveled
to the Communist state for a month
last November in an attempt to help
combat the critical health problem
and improve United States-North
Korea relations. Both the size of the
group and the length of the visit
make the trip an extremely rare
occurrence for the closed nation.
"This project was an important
organizational achievement for the
Stanford international health com
munity. A project like this doesn't
happen without magnificent syn
chronization," said Dr. Sharon
Perry, a science fellow at the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Cooperation (CISAC)
and epidemiologist in the School of
Medicine, who led the team to
North Korea.
"There were no guideposts when
we started, and we had to invent
every step of the way," she added.
John Lewis, a professor who
directs CISAC's Project on Peace
and Cooperation in the Asian-
Pacific Region, generated the idea
of a tuberculosis lab in 2007 when
searching for a project that could
ease relations between the two
countries. He partnered with Perry,
who organized a team of Bay Area
experts to support the cause.
Considered incurable through
out most of history, tuberculosis cur
rently affects one in three people
worldwide, with North Korea pos
sessing one of the highest rates in
the world outside of sub-Saharan
Africa. Some of the same factors
that caused 19th-century Americans
to romanticize the disease, which

causes its victims to become thin
and pale, greatly heighten the risk of
death in countries that have faced
food shortages, such as North
Korea.

The nation's lack of inclusion in
international medical dialogue exac
erbates the problem. Conventional
medical methods of diagnosis by
microscope the only method for
which North Korea currently has
the capability only diagnoses 50
percent of cases, and cannot tell
whether or not the TB strain is drug
resistant. By developing a tubercu
losis culture-testing lab in
Pyongyang, Stanford researchers
hope to help North Korean scien
tists combat the killer disease on the
same level as the Western world.

"There's a huge need in that part
of the world to develop internation
al collaborative TB laboratory net
works, and North Korea needs to
become a part of this group," Perry
said. "I think this lab is a big step."
In 2008, after navigating difficult
legal challenges, the team success

fully hosted a delegation of North
Korean Ministry of Public Health
officials. Perry said that while the
group was highly qualified and high
ly trained, they were well aware of
the technological disadvantages
they faced while fighting the disease
in North Korea.

"They knew what they didn't
know," she said. "When we took
them around to Stanford labs, they'd
say, 'Oh, this is great, but it's so far
out of our reach.'"
The first advanced team of
Americans traveled to the
Pyongyang site in spring of 2009
with permission from the U.S. gov
ernment and the North Korean
Office of Foreign Affairs. American
policy places extreme restrictions on
trade with North Korea, but by
cooperating with the World Health
Organization (WHO) and Christian
Friends of Korea (CFK), a humani
tarian organization, the team was
able to gain authorization.
In November, the full Stanford
team traveled to the site to deliver
equipment, help train physicians
and develop the laboratory. While
the team delivered 95 percent of the
lab's equipment on their November
trip, a lack of adequate electricity
prevented them from completing
set-up.

"They're very good technolo
gists; it's just that the infrastructure
is not there for basic microbiology,"
said Dr. Niaz Banaei, director of the
Stanford Medical Center Clinical
Microbiology Laboratory.

The team will return to finish
completion of the lab as soon as the

municipal center provides the lab
with adequate electricity.
Fourth-year medical student
Eugene Yim, who traveled with the
team to provide cultural support,
also helped the team achieve anoth
er groundbreaking feat. North
Korea has different government
agencies to deal with white
Americans and ethnically Korean
Americans separately, and previous
ly rarely allowed teams with mem
bers of each of those ethnicities.
"Every time I travel to North
Korea, it's definitely a learning
experience because their culture is
so different than ours — their way
of life is so different, even sharing an
ethnic heritage," Yim said.
But these differences did not cre
ate discord between the two groups
of scientists.
"They treated us all very warm
ly," Yim said.
Several North Korean attendants

remained with the Stanford team
throughout their trip, but their
movements were not greatly
restricted. The team provided North
Korean physicians with training for
the new equipment, and Niaz
believes that soon they will be high
ly self-sufficient. As long as food and
medicine donations to North Korea
continue uninterrupted, the lab
could soon succeed in greatly reduc
ing the tuberculosis rate in the
region.

"Reducing the rate of an infec
tions disease such as tuberculosis is
not just dependent on a lab," Banaei
said. "You also need appropriate
medicines to treat people, nutritious
meals to give the patients to fight
the disease as they're getting treat
ed. You need all the components to
get an effective health care system."
Based on the success thus far, the
team is highly optimistic about the
future of the lab and of reduced
tuberculosis rates in North Korea
based on qualified physicians oper
ating with higher technological stan
dards.

"North Koreans are extremely
likeable people they're funny,
they're intelligent, so it just baffles
[me] how there can be such a gulf
between us. You get the feeling of a
culture that can make significant
contributions in the world," Perry
said.

"This lab is a good-feeling proj
ect," she said. "Tuberculosis is an
enemy without borders."

"There were no
guideposts...We
had to invent every
step of the way"
— DR. SHARON PERRY,
CISAC science fellow
A team of Stanford medical pro
fessors and researchers are now
shedding light on a nearly unprece
dented month-long trip to North
Korea in November to help develop
the first drug-resistant tuberculosis
diagnostic lab in Pyongyang, the
nation's capital.
The team, consisting of 22 mem
bers chosen from Stanford and Bay
Area tuberculosis centers, traveled
to the Communist state for a month
last November in an attempt to help
combat the critical health problem
and improve United States-North
Korea relations. Both the size of the
group and the length of the visit
make the trip an extremely rare
occurrence for the closed nation.
"This project was an important
organizational achievement for the
Stanford international health com
munity. A project like this doesn't
happen without magnificent syn
chronization," said Dr. Sharon
Perry, a science fellow at the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Cooperation (CISAC)
and epidemiologist in the School of
Medicine, who led the team to
North Korea.
"There were no guideposts when
we started, and we had to invent
every step of the way," she added.
John Lewis, a professor who
directs CISAC's Project on Peace
and Cooperation in the Asian-
Pacific Region, generated the idea
of a tuberculosis lab in 2007 when
searching for a project that could
ease relations between the two
countries. He partnered with Perry,
who organized a team of Bay Area
experts to support the cause.
Considered incurable through
out most of history, tuberculosis cur
rently affects one in three people
worldwide, with North Korea pos
sessing one of the highest rates in
the world outside of sub-Saharan
Africa. Some of the same factors
that caused 19th-century Americans
to romanticize the disease, which

causes its victims to become thin
and pale, greatly heighten the risk of
death in countries that have faced
food shortages, such as North
Korea.

The nation's lack of inclusion in
international medical dialogue exac
erbates the problem. Conventional
medical methods of diagnosis by
microscope the only method for
which North Korea currently has
the capability only diagnoses 50
percent of cases, and cannot tell
whether or not the TB strain is drug
resistant. By developing a tubercu
losis culture-testing lab in
Pyongyang, Stanford researchers
hope to help North Korean scien
tists combat the killer disease on the
same level as the Western world.

"There's a huge need in that part
of the world to develop internation
al collaborative TB laboratory net
works, and North Korea needs to
become a part of this group," Perry
said. "I think this lab is a big step."
In 2008, after navigating difficult
legal challenges, the team success

fully hosted a delegation of North
Korean Ministry of Public Health
officials. Perry said that while the
group was highly qualified and high
ly trained, they were well aware of
the technological disadvantages
they faced while fighting the disease
in North Korea.

"They knew what they didn't
know," she said. "When we took
them around to Stanford labs, they'd
say, 'Oh, this is great, but it's so far
out of our reach.'"
The first advanced team of
Americans traveled to the
Pyongyang site in spring of 2009
with permission from the U.S. gov
ernment and the North Korean
Office of Foreign Affairs. American
policy places extreme restrictions on
trade with North Korea, but by
cooperating with the World Health
Organization (WHO) and Christian
Friends of Korea (CFK), a humani
tarian organization, the team was
able to gain authorization.
In November, the full Stanford
team traveled to the site to deliver
equipment, help train physicians
and develop the laboratory. While
the team delivered 95 percent of the
lab's equipment on their November
trip, a lack of adequate electricity
prevented them from completing
set-up.

"They're very good technolo
gists; it's just that the infrastructure
is not there for basic microbiology,"
said Dr. Niaz Banaei, director of the
Stanford Medical Center Clinical
Microbiology Laboratory.

The team will return to finish
completion of the lab as soon as the

municipal center provides the lab
with adequate electricity.
Fourth-year medical student
Eugene Yim, who traveled with the
team to provide cultural support,
also helped the team achieve anoth
er groundbreaking feat. North
Korea has different government
agencies to deal with white
Americans and ethnically Korean
Americans separately, and previous
ly rarely allowed teams with mem
bers of each of those ethnicities.
"Every time I travel to North
Korea, it's definitely a learning
experience because their culture is
so different than ours — their way
of life is so different, even sharing an
ethnic heritage," Yim said.
But these differences did not cre
ate discord between the two groups
of scientists.
"They treated us all very warm
ly," Yim said.
Several North Korean attendants

remained with the Stanford team
throughout their trip, but their
movements were not greatly
restricted. The team provided North
Korean physicians with training for
the new equipment, and Niaz
believes that soon they will be high
ly self-sufficient. As long as food and
medicine donations to North Korea
continue uninterrupted, the lab
could soon succeed in greatly reduc
ing the tuberculosis rate in the
region.

"Reducing the rate of an infec
tions disease such as tuberculosis is
not just dependent on a lab," Banaei
said. "You also need appropriate
medicines to treat people, nutritious
meals to give the patients to fight
the disease as they're getting treat
ed. You need all the components to
get an effective health care system."
Based on the success thus far, the
team is highly optimistic about the
future of the lab and of reduced
tuberculosis rates in North Korea
based on qualified physicians oper
ating with higher technological stan
dards.

"North Koreans are extremely
likeable people they're funny,
they're intelligent, so it just baffles
[me] how there can be such a gulf
between us. You get the feeling of a
culture that can make significant
contributions in the world," Perry
said.

"This lab is a good-feeling proj
ect," she said. "Tuberculosis is an
enemy without borders."
