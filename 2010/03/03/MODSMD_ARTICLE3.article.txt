### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A team of Stanford medical pro
fessors and researchers are now
shedding light on a nearly unprece
dented month-long trip to North
Korea in November to help develop
the first drug-resistant tuberculosis
diagnostic lab in Pyongyang, the
nation's capital.
The team, consisting of 22 mem
bers chosen from Stanford and Bay
Area tuberculosis centers, traveled
to the Communist state for a month
last November in an attempt to help
combat the critical health problem
and improve United States-North
Korea relations. Both the size of the
group and the length of the visit
make the trip an extremely rare
occurrence for the closed nation.
"This project was an important
organizational achievement for the
Stanford international health com
munity. A project like this doesn't
happen without magnificent syn
chronization," said Dr. Sharon
Perry, a science fellow at the
Stanford Center for International
Security and Cooperation (CISAC)
and epidemiologist in the School of
Medicine, who led the team to
North Korea.
