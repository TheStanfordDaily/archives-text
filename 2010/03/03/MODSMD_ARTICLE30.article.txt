# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Lawson becomes a killing machine 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore phenom Brad Lawson
is on his way to accomplishing some
thing no other Cardinal hitter has done
in the past three years he is current
ly leading school record holder Evan
Romero in kills. Last year, Lawson
came in second to Romero's 485 kills
with 400 of his own. Thus far this sea
son, Lawson is at 255 and Romero
trails close behind at 209.
Is it that Lawson, an outside hitter,
played in the Junior Olympics in his
first year of indoor volleyball? Is it that
he spends too much time lifting
weights? Or is it that Lawson's lifetime
of volleyball experience outdoes
Romero's relative newcomer status to
the sport?
Whatever the case, Lawson has a
year of collegiate experience under his
belt, preceded by a long history of vol
leyball accolades. The Lawsons have
volleyball in their blood both of
Brad's parents played, especially on
the beaches of Hawaii. Lawson is a
two-time Junior Olympic selection,
having led his team to silver in 2006. He
played for the U.S. junior national
team in the 2008 NORCECA champi
onships in El Salvador and represent
ed the United States in the 2009 FIVB
World Championships in India.
"I was always around [volleyball]
because of my family. My dad played
club in college. He was always playing
on the beach when I was a little kid, so
I was always around it," Lawson said.
"When I was 13, we made it to the
under-14 Junior Olympics my first year
playing."
Besides introducing him to the
sport, his parents have had a consider
able impact on his career including
choosing a position.
"During middle school, they want
ed to make me a middle blocker, but
my parents said, 'lf you're going to be a
middle blocker, we're not going to let
you play volleyball,"' Lawson said. "I
really wanted to play outside, too, be
cause my dad was an outside. And out
side is more fun than middle."

Regardless of the intense de
meanor that Lawson radiates on the
court, his childhood love of the game is
still with him.

"My favorite thing [from first play
ing volleyball] was learning the sport
I had never played indoor, so it was
an entirely new thing for me," he said.
"I had always been around beach."

"[Also], most of my friends always
hung out together, so being on a team
with all your friends was awesome," he
added.

The Hawaii native successfully
transitioned from a beach player to an
indoor one, and was widely recognized
by volleyball powerhouses across the
country; or, more specifically, in Cali
fornia. UC-Santa Barbara even made
a visit out to Hawaii to see Lawson in
action. Among the schools heavily re
cruiting him were Stanford, Irvine,
Pepperdine, Santa Barbara and USC.
"Pepperdine was my very close sec
ond, but academics and athletics at
Stanford is a tough combination to
beat," Lawson said of his decision.

Division I athletics and elite aca
demics became a reality and a ques
tion of time management for Law
son once he stepped onto the Stanford
campus.

"Obviously Stanford is a tough aca
demic school, so with the workload
comes the necessity to manage your
time," he said. "We practice every day,
so getting essays and homework done
beforehand is important, especially be
fore games and traveling."
Not only was Lawson expected to
perform well in the classroom, but he
had challenges ahead of him on the
court as well.

"There was a lot of pressure coming
out of high school, having a good high
school career," Lawson said. "I felt a lot
of pressure to perform my freshman
year, and maybe it was a little over
whelming at times. During the early
few matches, I was so nervous."

But this laid-back Hawaiian shows
no signs of nervousness. Maybe it's be
cause his artistic personality keeps him
relaxed. A lover of music, singing and
the piano, Lawson would consider tak
ing more lessons if volleyball ever fell
through.
However, that seems unlikely. This
sophomore outside hitter has high
hopes for a national championship and
a professional career in the future
either indoor or beach.
"I hope for a national champi
onship," he said. "I know that's one of
our big goals this year coming off our
success from last year and just seeing
where we've come in the past few
years: 'from worst to first' they call it."
While a simpler but sometimes
more demanding game, beach volley
ball may actually work out well for
