# TRACK TAKES SECOND IN MPSF
## 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's and
women's track and field teams had
a weekend in Seattle, Wash, filled
with highs as well as lows. While fin
ishing in second place on both sides
at the MPSF Championship was a
modest disappointment, there were
some top performances and meet
titles to highlight the weekend.
For most schools, a second place
finish would be everything the pro
gram dreamed of - not the case at
Stanford. In a program where the
women have won the title five times
and the men are currently ranked
No. 14 in the country, second place
feels a little short. Yet the Stanford
men and women pulled off some
amazing performances to be proud
of, and as a result they will be send
ing a large Cardinal contingent to
the NCAA Indoor Championships
the weekend of March 12th and
13th.
Leading the way for the women
in the first day of competition was
senior Griffin Matthew, who won
the 200-meter dash with a time of
23.86 seconds. Right behind
Matthew was freshman Carissa
Levingston, who placed second in
the event with a time of 24.03 sec
onds.
"I was happy with my win in the
200 meters," Matthew said, "but I'd
still like to improve my time in the
next few weeks."
The performances by Matthew
and Levingston are promising for a
track program like Stanford, since
Stanford is not known for sprints.
As a well-known distance power
house, having sprinters winning
meet titles and showing depth in an
event boosts the reputation of Stan
ford sprints.
"The sprinters really stepped up
this weekend and helped get more
points for the team, which felt
great," Matthew said.
The distance women also pro
vided some top performances in
day one, led by junior Stephanie
Marcy, who placed second in the
5,000 meters with a career best time
of 16:18.77. The distance medley
relay team also fared well, placing
third with a time of 11:31.58. The
team consisted of junior Maddie
Duhon, freshman Hannah Farley,
freshman Justine Fedronic and
sophomore Victoria Pennings.
In day two of the meet, the

women continued their stellar
record, with sophomore Katerina
Stefanidi leading the way with the
meet title in the pole vault. Her
mark of 14-feet-1.25 was an im
provement on her own school
record, set earlier this year, and was
also one of the best vaults in the
NCAA this season. Junior Whitney
Liehr provided another meet title
in the second day, winning the triple
jump with a leap of 40-feet-9.5.
Day two also proved fruitful for
sprinters Levingston and Matthew,
as they placed second and third in
the 60-meter dash with times of 7.33
and 7.46, respectively. Levingston's
time was the third fastest in Stan
ford history, a great honor for the
freshman.
On the men's side, day one start
ed with two meet titles, one each
from a pair of juniors, Carter Wells
and Elliott Heath. Heath won the
5,000 meters with a time of 13:47.14,
barely missing the NCAA automat
ic qualification. Wells won the
weight throw with a toss of 62-feet
-11.5, which was a personal best. The
conference titles were firsts for both
Heath and Wells.
Day two also proved successful
for Heath, who placed second in the
3,000 meters with a time of eight
minutes flat, a provisional standard.
Also finishing in second place, in
the 800, was sophomore Dylan Fer
ris. Ferris's time of 1:49.05 was just
off his season best.
"The 800 was a good race, but I
came short of what I wanted to do,"
Ferris said. "But overall, I am happy
with our performances over the
weekend."
On the side of the sprinters, red
shirt senior Tyrone McGraw led the
Cardinal men, setting a school
record in the 60 meters with a time
of 6.80 seconds. Sophomore
Amaechi Morton also established a
school record, beating his own time
in the 400 from last season. He ran a
46.71 to finish in third place and
earn a provisional mark.
Sophomore Geoffrey Tabor per
formed well in the field in day two,
placing second in the shot put with a
toss of 58-feet-5.25, a provisional
standard.
At the end, the men and women
ended the meet in second place,
with the men trailing UCLA and
the women trailing Oregon.
Next up for several members of
the team will be a trip to Fayet
teville, Ark. for the NCAA Indoor

Championships. However, a lot of
the team will also be competing at
The Farm this weekend in the first
meet of the outdoor season. Known
as the Quad Meet, the Cardinal will
compete against teams from Cal,

UC-Davis, Fresno State, Cal Poly
and San Francisco State, The meet
begins at 11:40 a.m. on Saturday.
