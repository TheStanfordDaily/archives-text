## Study reports healthy behavior via avatars 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
Could seeing a virtual replica of yourself
exercising or eating healthy food encourage
you to be healthier in real life?
That's the question researchers are now
asking in Stanford's Virtual Fluman
Interaction Tab (VHIL), where experimen
tation with avatar technology is hardly
novel the lab has produced studies and
publications on the topic since 2005.

Flowever, the release of James
Cameron's visually stunning film, "Avatar,"
has created a new wave of public interest in
the field and drawn attention to a current
VHIL study on the use of avatars to pro
mote healthy living.
The goal of the study was to find out if
seeing a virtual replica of oneself engaging
in healthy activity would encourage a per
son to perform that activity in real life.
According to the lab's Web site, "models can
be valuable stimuli for encouraging the imi

tation of particular behaviors. Thus, we are
investigating how using self-models ... can
influence imitation, particularly in the con
text of health and consumer behaviors."

Jesse Fox, the author of the study, arrived
at VHIL in 2006 to begin work on her Ph.D.
Interested in the use of avatar technology as
a pro-social tool for improving public
health, Fox began running a series of three
consecutive studies almost immediately.
