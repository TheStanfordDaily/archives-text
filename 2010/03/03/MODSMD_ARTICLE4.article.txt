## Study reports healthy behavior via avatars 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
Could seeing a virtual replica of yourself
exercising or eating healthy food encourage
you to be healthier in real life?
That's the question researchers are now
asking in Stanford's Virtual Fluman
Interaction Tab (VHIL), where experimen
tation with avatar technology is hardly
novel the lab has produced studies and
publications on the topic since 2005.

Flowever, the release of James
Cameron's visually stunning film, "Avatar,"
has created a new wave of public interest in
the field and drawn attention to a current
VHIL study on the use of avatars to pro
mote healthy living.
The goal of the study was to find out if
seeing a virtual replica of oneself engaging
in healthy activity would encourage a per
son to perform that activity in real life.
According to the lab's Web site, "models can
be valuable stimuli for encouraging the imi

tation of particular behaviors. Thus, we are
investigating how using self-models ... can
influence imitation, particularly in the con
text of health and consumer behaviors."

Jesse Fox, the author of the study, arrived
at VHIL in 2006 to begin work on her Ph.D.
Interested in the use of avatar technology as
a pro-social tool for improving public
health, Fox began running a series of three
consecutive studies almost immediately.
First, each participant had to be
digitally photographed at the lab.
These photographs were wrapped
around three-dimensional virtual
figures to create avatars with high
levels of physical similarity to the
participants.
The animation technology used
by VHIL is similar to the kind used
in movies such as "Shrek" and "Up,"
in which predetermined actions
based on live human models are ren
dered into very realistic and accu
rate animations, according to Fox.
Participants then returned to the
lab, where they put on a head
mounted display helmet and became
totally immersed in an exact virtual
replication of the room they were in.
Each participant spent approximate
ly 45 minutes watching virtual
avatars sometimes accurately
modeled after the participant and
sometimes appearing as random
others perform activities of vary
ing healthfulness.
Fox was able to manipulate the
virtual selves' activities and appear
ances extremely rapidly, allowing
her to gauge participants' responses
to physical phenomena in a short
period of time that would otherwise
take weeks or months to occur.
"We can make your avatar gain
30 pounds in a minute or lose 15
pounds in a minute, which you can't
do in the real world," Fox said.
The discrepancy between peo
ple's attitudes toward health and
their behaviors is one of the large
problems faced by those working
toward improved public health, Fox
said. In other words, a person saying
that he should or will exercise is very
different from him actually exercis
ing.
After a series of follow-up calls to
participants asking about their exer
cise and eating activities in the 24
hours following the first of the three
studies, Fox was shocked to find that

the manipulation had worked. She
and her advisor, Jeremy Bailenson, a
communication professor, were both
somewhat skeptical going into the
studies, as there had never been pre
vious work done trying to get sub
jects to model their virtual selves'
behavior.

Fox also expressed concern about
the potential influence of violent or
offensive games on players' behav
ior and attitudes.
Spurred by studies on aggression
in video games, she conducted a
study, published in June 2009, on
participants' attitudes toward
stereotypical female avatars, from
overtly sexual "Lara Croft" types, to
"Grand Theft Auto" prostitutes, to
more demure characters.
What Fox found disturbed her:
after virtual encounters
with stereotypical
females, partici
pants of both gen
ders exhibited
higher levels of
sexism than
those who
encountered
non-stereotypi
cal avatars,
including
increased fre
quency of rape
acceptance and
victim blaming.
Fox added
that although
the entertain
ment industry
tends to focus
on the nega-

tive aspects of avatar technology, it is
a broadly engaged in field that will
continue gaining momentum.
"We need to keep in mind that
we're the ones who program the
machines," Fox said, "and we're
responsible as creators and users
and know where to draw the line."
