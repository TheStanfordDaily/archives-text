# Finding your focus on the Farm

It has none of the novelty of freshman
year, less of the academic rigor of jun
ior year and nothing close to the nos
talgia of senior year. But sophomore
year sometimes the overlooked,
lost year in an undergraduate career can
be a bellwether for the remainder of the
Stanford experience.
"It's a transition year between the
breadth of freshman year and another year
of slightly more in-depth exploration before
they choose what their major might be," said
President John Hennessy. "Some of the
excitement and novelty that occurs during
freshman year become somewhat more
accepted and students turn their attention
even more heavily to extracurricular activi
ties as well as to their academic studies."

For students in Toyon Hall, the all-sophomore
residence, the living arrangements of year
two are meant to have a freshman feel.
That's the "sophomore experience," dis
tilled in a University sound byte. It's an accu
rate trajectory for many sophomores, but the
on-the-ground experience of many students of
the Class of 2012 is more nuanced, with stu
dents having to strike the proper social and
academic balance and find their place within
the Stanford framework.
The Transition Year
"Sophomore year... it's like you're stuck in
the middle, like being the middle child. What is
our place?" anonymous sophomore
It's a question Elizabeth Ann Fox, associate
dean of Undergraduate Advising and
Research, is trying to answer. An architect of
the "sophomore experience," Fox has the job
of working with the class presidents and
Undergraduate Advising to construct pro
grams that help sophomores find their place at
the University, or at least nudge them in the
right direction. She in conjunction with the
class presidents planned Sophomore
Celebration, Majors Night, Sophomore
Symposium and Sophomore Faculty Dinner.
"We ask students to wrestle with the seem
ing contradiction of being a member of an
intellectual community while simultaneously
asking themselves questions that no one else
can answer for them: where do my individual
curiosities lead me? What is my disciplinary
focus?" Fox said.
Those are some of the major questions for
students. The mindset shift comes first.
"It's kind of expected that you grow up
your sophomore year," said Alex Larrave of
Haus Mitt. "Freshman year, you have all these
people ready to cater to your interest. I real
ized that this year people are going to stop
holding my hand."
That realization, that the Neverland of
freshman year and solidifying a friend base is
over, can be a big shift. This year, there's more
at stake academically and with extracurric
ulars.
Larrave, an archaeology and religious stud
ies double major, said that she was an anomaly
among some of her friends she knew that
archaeology was her academic interest coming
into college.
"I'm a weird exception because I'm
declared and know what's up," she admitted,
explaining the research she's been doing with
a post-doc.
"I decided that this year, I was going to
become one of those people who did really
cool things," Larrave laughed. She spread her

wings sophomore year and joined Amnesty
International this year after seeing the fliers at
the Activities Fair in White Plaza.
The rush freshman year to get involved
with friends and groups "is translated to soph
omore year with having to choose a major and
have an academic plan," said sophomore class
president Taylor Goodspeed.
That academic pressure which comes
from all areas, whether it be administrative or
personal is weighing on the minds of many,
especially those who are still exploring classes
without a direct focus.
"Sometimes I get a little nervous that I'm
doing it all wrong," admitted Tori Pennings, a
recently declared Earth Systems major, of her
academic approach. "I'm doing well in classes
and I talk to my professors, but I'm not as
involved as they say you should be."
For students like Pennings, sophomore year
is the extended litmus test for whether a par
ticular major is the right fit. That's been the
case for Alfredo Martinez.
Listening to Martinez talk about his major
and involvement with Project Right and Relay
for Life, you would have no idea that just a
year ago he was a map-wielding freshman who
got lost trying to navigate his way from
Tresidder to his all-frosh dorm in Larkin.
"I'm much more comfortable here now,"
Martinez said. "Sophomore year is a much
more enhanced experience you have
stronger relationships with faculty and you're
more established socially."
Martinez's plan his freshman year was to
double major in history and international rela
tions. He scrapped that plan this year and
decided to just focus on the former after tak
ing a class with history Prof. A1 Camarillo.
"We really hit it off and I've been in almost
constant communication with him," Martinez
said of his now-adviser.
Finding Your Focus, Not Your Footing
As she was folding name placards for the
Sophomore Faculty dinner last week,
Goodspeed smiled as she recounted her out
look on this year.
"You're coming from your home freshman
year and now this is home," Goodspeed said,
surveying the Sophomore Cabinet working to
assemble chairs and place settings in the
Tresidder Oak Room. "That's been my biggest
change in mindset this year."
"Coming into Stanford, I didn't know what

to expect from college I had a really idyllic
view. I was really overwhelmed, was meeting
so many people and I didn't know what to get
involved in," Goodspeed said.
Then Goodspeed joined student govern
ment and things fell into place.
She said sophomore year was more about
finding her focus than her approach freshman
year, when she was trying to get her bearings.
"I took random classes freshman year, and
I have no idea why, in retrospect," she
laughed. "This year it's a lot more targeted."
But honing in on a major comes with the
added pressure and difficulty of using sopho
more year as an exploratory time.
"Sophomores are generally working to
develop a sense of purpose," said Greg
Boardman, Vice Provost of Student Affairs.
"This search for purpose results in students
seeking an academic identity in the form of
selecting a major, pursuing new relationships
and narrowing their extracurricular activities.
All of these take time, and as academic, social
and extracurricular expectations increase, stu
dents find themselves continually prioritizing
and sacrificing."
On this front, Goodspeed said she's feeling
the heat.
"This is the only chance you're going to get
to take Swahili or Sanskrit," she said. "It's a
dual mindset, where you have to realize that
you have to both explore, but still be looking
toward the future."
The Social Scene
Jeffrey Sweet, a current resident of Murray,
says that sophomore year's social dynamics
are a marked shift from the hallway-bonding
interactions of freshman year.
"I've grown closer to certain communities,
particularly to the Jewish communities," Sweet
said. "It's been great, but a lot of the cama
raderie of freshman year has been reduced."
Sweet lived in Serra a four-class dorm
his freshman year and said that due to the rel
atively few freshmen, there was a tight-knit
dorm community built on collective experi
ence and residence. But this year, forming
friendships is different.
"I think sophomore year you're building
relationships not so much on proximity of
closeness, but on the proximity of interest,"
Sweet said.
"You definitely get a more defined friend
group this year," agreed Chamal

Samaranayake, who lives with his six-person
draw group in Crothers Memorial. "All your
friends aren't living in the same place so they
have to make an effort to come see you."
Plus, sophomore year is a welcome breath
of fresh air from the blitz social interactions
and frantic rush to attend every single frat
party and up your friend count.
"Sophomore year is calmer," Martinez
said. "There was a lot 0f... energy. There
were massive study groups. I remember stay
ing up late. Now I focus more on extracurricu
lar commitments."
Introspection
When Holly Ho entered sophomore year
in Robinson this September, she was hoping
that the 2009-10 academic year would be com
pletely different from her freshman experi
ence.
"I'm not sure where my head was freshman
year and my mind was so scattered I was
always stressed," she said. Ho, like many fresh
men, was working through a difficult long-dis
tance relationship, which was taxing.
But this year, academics are the focus. As
an electrical engineering major, faculty inter
actions and academic involvement are a natu
ral byproduct of the coursework.
Ho says she's feeling the benefits.
"I kind of feel like I'm reliving a more
sophisticated version of freshman year," Ho
said.
For Pennings, a member of the cross-coun
try team, sophomore year has been largely
about personal development something
Fox calls the hallmark of the sophomore expe
rience.
Freshman year centers on group actions
and the shared, defining benchmarks, from
fountain hopping to Big Game. During sopho
more year, the individual comes more into
focus, inviting a level of introspection after a
blur of new experiences. With their friend
base intact and a general sense of how the
University system works, the challenge sopho
mores face is more subtle than in the prior
year, perhaps, but no less significant.
Freshman year is the point where students
acclimate themselves to the Stanford rhythm
sophomore year is the point where students
center on how their personal contributions
sync with that rhythm. And that begins with
taking a moment and realizing that's okay.
"I think over the year you come to realize
that this is real life," Pennings said. "Not every
day, every minute has to be really exciting or
packed. A big part of sophomore year is to
refocus on yourself and be comfortable with
who you are."
