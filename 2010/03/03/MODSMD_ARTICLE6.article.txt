It has none of the novelty of freshman
year, less of the academic rigor of jun
ior year and nothing close to the nos
talgia of senior year. But sophomore
year sometimes the overlooked,
lost year in an undergraduate career can
be a bellwether for the remainder of the
Stanford experience.
"It's a transition year between the
breadth of freshman year and another year
of slightly more in-depth exploration before
they choose what their major might be," said
President John Hennessy. "Some of the
excitement and novelty that occurs during
freshman year become somewhat more
accepted and students turn their attention
even more heavily to extracurricular activi
ties as well as to their academic studies."
