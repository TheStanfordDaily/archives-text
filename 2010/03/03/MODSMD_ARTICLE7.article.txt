## University optimistic about research despite cuts 
### ADAM COLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last year, in an effort to fund as many
student researchers as possible, the
University cut social events associated with
the Summer Research College (SRC). These
events won't be returning this year and
undergraduate research funds have been cut
by 18 percent, according to Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education (VPUE) John
Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5.

Faculty, students and staff, however, still
anticipate a robust summer of research.
Stanford has the largest undergraduate
research budget per capita in the country.
"Our goals haven't changed," said Brian
Thomas, the associate dean of undergradu
ate research. "We want to enable as many

students as possible to engage with Stanford
faculty in pursuit of original research."
"Students will live in campus housing,"
Bravman added. "We just don't have the dol
lars for programming and RA staff."
There are not as many dollars available
for VPUE grants, either.
"This extrapolates directly to fewer stu
dents doing research," said Bob Simoni,
chair of the biology department. According
to Simoni, more than 70 percent of biology
majors do research while at Stanford, though
the budgets cuts could decrease participa
tion.

Rick Pam, a lecturer in the physics
department who helps organize its under-
graduate research program, said
that the department had to cut 20
percent of its VPUE-funded posi
tions last summer. Although is pos
sible that another 20 percent will be
eliminated this coming summer,
funding can come from other
sources.
"Last year, we made a big effort
to scrounge up enough money to
support nearly the same number of
students as before," Pam said.
The physics department part
nered with the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center and the applied
physics department to offer more
positions, and looked to professors'
grants for funding.
The political science department,
for its part, reorganized its budget to
continue supporting student
research.
"We've been lucky to be able to
keep a lot of positions," said Hana
Meckler, the department's under
graduate program administrator.
Most departments are intent
upon securing funding for their stu
dents a necessary measure,
because roughly the same amount
of students are currently looking for
research positions as there were in
past years. One such student, Josh
Falk 'l2, plans to apply for a VPUE
funded position in the linguistics
department.
"In any field, I think being
actively engaged in research is the
best way to learn," Falk said. He
expects to work closely with a pro
fessor before finding a focus for his
own project.
According to Thomas, this is a
typical path for student researchers.
"Most students get their start
working in a very structured way
with faculty," he said.
"The hope is that the experience
will help them think about an inde
pendent project later on," Simoni
added.

Pam said that engaging in
research early helps students define
their career goals.
"Some people find research isn't
for them," he said. "And then there
are others who really love it."
In her sophomore year, history
major Evgenia Shnayder 'lO was
interested in pursuing a Ph.D., but
her advisors suggested that she try
research before solidifying her long
term goals.
"After the summer of my sopho
more year, I was completely
hooked," she said.
Shnayder has now worked in the
Spatial History Lab for more than
two years, and has loved every
minute of it.
"The lab staff and researchers
really trust the students they
really trust our opinions," she said.
Richard Futrell 'lO shared a sim
ilar experience in the linguistics
department, where he has worked
since sophomore year.
"You're discovering things that
no one else knows," said Futrell,
who appreciates the groundbreak
ing aspect of research. Last year,
Futrell was given the opportunity to
travel to Germany with emerita
Prof. Joan Bresnan to share some of
their findings at a conference.
Meckler said that these kinds of
presentations are an important
aspect of the undergraduate
research experience.
"It's a lot of thinking on the spot,
so they have to really know their
stuff," Meckler said.
Futrell started his research expe
rience at the SRC and believes the
program will be worthwhile even
without dorm events.
"I think the dorm programming
is basically superfluous," he said.
"The most important thing is the
community."
Bravman said that even with the
cuts, he is not satisfied.
"I'm gonna work like hell to
increase our budget for next year,"
he said.
