## University optimistic about research despite cuts 
### ADAM COLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last year, in an effort to fund as many
student researchers as possible, the
University cut social events associated with
the Summer Research College (SRC). These
events won't be returning this year and
undergraduate research funds have been cut
by 18 percent, according to Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education (VPUE) John
Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5.

Faculty, students and staff, however, still
anticipate a robust summer of research.
Stanford has the largest undergraduate
research budget per capita in the country.
"Our goals haven't changed," said Brian
Thomas, the associate dean of undergradu
ate research. "We want to enable as many

students as possible to engage with Stanford
faculty in pursuit of original research."
"Students will live in campus housing,"
Bravman added. "We just don't have the dol
lars for programming and RA staff."
There are not as many dollars available
for VPUE grants, either.
"This extrapolates directly to fewer stu
dents doing research," said Bob Simoni,
chair of the biology department. According
to Simoni, more than 70 percent of biology
majors do research while at Stanford, though
the budgets cuts could decrease participa
tion.
