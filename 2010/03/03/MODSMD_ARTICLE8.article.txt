# Senate votes down SSD bill
## Special bylaws case prevents move to special fees 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It appears that the Student Services
Division (SSD) will have to go back to the
budget drawing board after a bill requesting
Senate approval for the SSD to move to spe
cial fees was shot down after the petition
already garnered more than 900 signatures in
its current format on Tuesday.
Although the SSD petition was originally
intended to bypass Senate approval in favor
of garnering 15 percent of voter approval, a
stipulation in the joint bylaws makes SSD a
special case as an "agency of the ASSU" sub
ject to the Senate's approval. Without it, the
petition will not be placed on the ballot,
regardless of how many supporting votes it
gathers.
Alex Katz 'l2, the chair of the
Administration & Rules Committee,
remained firmly opposed to officer salaries
for the SSD, which he claimed are "an explic
it contradiction of [the Senate's funding] poli
cies." Katz made an exception for one stipend
of $l,OOO to be allotted for the SSD director.
Katz said that two additional amendments
would need to be made to the bill in order to
garner his support that line items allotted
to the Wellness Room be removed from the
budget, and to strip Tutoring for Community
of funding. According to Katz, provisions for
these services can be better mitigated under

the general fee. He advocated for all but one
salary, the director's, to be removed.

Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll chal
lenged Katz's demand for amendments by
suggesting that the question of whether a
budget is worth student dollars ought to be
posed directly to the student body, rather than
debated and vetoed by a Senate internally
divided.
"Students are just as capable of deciding
whether salaries are appropriate. That's per
fectly valid to be on a ballot and for democra
cy to decide," Sivaram said, adding, "student
power over the petition power needs to be
increased."
ASSU Vice President Andy Parker 'll
rejected all of Katz's amendments, defending
over 900 signatures that have already been
placed in favor of SSD's placement on the
ballot. He suggested that amending the bill
would be confusing and misleading to those
who have already voted.
In a 9-to-5 vote in favor of the bill, it was
voted down after failing to garner two-thirds
support.
The petition itself will remain available
and individual line items can be reduced to
meet the Senate's standards up until March
18.
A number of senators have suggested that
the Wellness Room and Green Store in partic-
