# Senate votes down SSD bill
## Special bylaws case prevents move to special fees 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It appears that the Student Services
Division (SSD) will have to go back to the
budget drawing board after a bill requesting
Senate approval for the SSD to move to spe
cial fees was shot down after the petition
already garnered more than 900 signatures in
its current format on Tuesday.
Although the SSD petition was originally
intended to bypass Senate approval in favor
of garnering 15 percent of voter approval, a
stipulation in the joint bylaws makes SSD a
special case as an "agency of the ASSU" sub
ject to the Senate's approval. Without it, the
petition will not be placed on the ballot,
regardless of how many supporting votes it
gathers.
Alex Katz 'l2, the chair of the
Administration & Rules Committee,
remained firmly opposed to officer salaries
for the SSD, which he claimed are "an explic
it contradiction of [the Senate's funding] poli
cies." Katz made an exception for one stipend
of $l,OOO to be allotted for the SSD director.
Katz said that two additional amendments
would need to be made to the bill in order to
garner his support that line items allotted
to the Wellness Room be removed from the
budget, and to strip Tutoring for Community
of funding. According to Katz, provisions for
these services can be better mitigated under

the general fee. He advocated for all but one
salary, the director's, to be removed.

Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll chal
lenged Katz's demand for amendments by
suggesting that the question of whether a
budget is worth student dollars ought to be
posed directly to the student body, rather than
debated and vetoed by a Senate internally
divided.
"Students are just as capable of deciding
whether salaries are appropriate. That's per
fectly valid to be on a ballot and for democra
cy to decide," Sivaram said, adding, "student
power over the petition power needs to be
increased."
ASSU Vice President Andy Parker 'll
rejected all of Katz's amendments, defending
over 900 signatures that have already been
placed in favor of SSD's placement on the
ballot. He suggested that amending the bill
would be confusing and misleading to those
who have already voted.
In a 9-to-5 vote in favor of the bill, it was
voted down after failing to garner two-thirds
support.
The petition itself will remain available
and individual line items can be reduced to
meet the Senate's standards up until March
18.
A number of senators have suggested that
the Wellness Room and Green Store in partic-
ular could be siphoned off the SSD's
budget and go through the motions
in the fall on the general fee.
Senator Anton Zietsman 'l2,
chair of the Appropriations
Committee, suggested that the
Green Store could make room on a
general fee budget to be funded for
its biodegradable cups, for example.
Senator Michael Cruz 'l2, howev
er, called Tuesday's meeting a "trav
esty," suggesting that Zietsman
twisted the policies to his fancy,
rather than fully considering how
these policies currently function.
"I would accuse Senator
Zietsman 0f... misinterpreting his
own policies," Cruz said in an inter
view with The Daily. According to a
general fees policy, Cruz said, groups
cannot request funding for goods or
services for which they will subse
quently charge students.
"There are exceptions to that,"
Zietsman said defending of the poli
cy's flexibility. He cited the Viennese
Ball and Black Graduation in partic
ular as groups that do receive fund
ing from the general fee and do
charge for services.
"It's all based on the services they
provide, which is why I am con
vinced the Green Store will survive
next year under the general fee," he
said.
In an interview with The Daily,

Katz seemed convinced that Parker
would make the suggested amend
ments to the petition and that the
Senate would subsequently pool its
resources by "doing all we can to
help these groups succeed on the
general fee to make sure that they
get the funding they need and the
funding they deserve."
While the current Senate's ability
to exercise oversight over the incom
ing one remains doubtful, Katz has
suggested a number of measures
that the body will implement to do
its best to do come just short of guar
anteeing funding for the various
arms of SSD.
ASSU Cabinet Salaries and
Discretionary Spending, Again
Taken To Task
Katz's vehement disagreement
with Parker's SSD bill piggybacked
off a bill he does support: to strip
ASSU salaries, authored by Robert
Hennessy, parliamentarian for the
Graduate Student Council. That bill
would slash stipends almost indis
criminately, preserving only a few
highly demanding ASSU positions.
In its current form, 15 to 17 cabinet
members receive salaries of $950
each. The bill would also demand
Senate approval for the executive's
spending more than $l,OOO of its dis
cretionary budget.
"Would you really look at an
average student in the face and say
the most productive use of $20,000 is
to pay a bunch of people in the exec
utive cabinet?" Katz asked.
Parker suggested, however, that a

baseline salary of at least $5OO was
essential for some cabinet members
who, because of financial constraints,
could not serve their posts without a
stipend. The small salary is crucial
toward "incentivizing participation,"
Parker said.
The Senate and executives
remain at odds on the issue, which
will likely be put to vote next week.
Free Speech Bill Underway
Senator Adam Creasman 'll,
along with Parker, drafted legisla
tion to codify freedom of speech on
campus a project that has been
underway for several months now,
particularly in light of the Westboro
Baptist Church's appearance at
Hillel in January and challenges to
student organizing in White Plaza.
"There is very little institutional
memory in terms of students
demanding rights for themselves, so
I think it's incumbent upon us to

codify these rights," Creasman said.
If the senate approves the bill,
and if two-thirds of student voters
(half undergraduate and half gradu
ate student populations) approve it
during elections, the bill would be
submitted for approval by the
University president, representing
the Board of Trustees.

Creasman suggested that decisive
constitutional action makes this bill
"less of a publicity stunt and more of
an actual piece of legislation that is
cooperative with the Board of
Trustees and the administration."

In other business, graduate stu
dent Raj Bhandari was confirmed as
next year's ASSU financial manager
and all recommended general fee
bills and funding modifications
passed, as well as recommended spe
cial fee bills for 2010-11.
