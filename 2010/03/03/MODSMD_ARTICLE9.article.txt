## Dining notes savings by going trayless Executive Director estimates high water savings 
### LAUREN WILSON 
To carry a tray or not to carry a
tray?
Stanford Dining has had students
in Stern and Wilbur dining halls asking
themselves that question ever since it
implemented a trayless dining initia
tive fall quarter. While trays are still
available, students must request them,
causing many to think twice.
But now that the year is halfway
done, the new question is just how
effective the initiative started after
a survey of 500 students indicated pos
itive support has been.
According to Executive Director
of Stanford Dining Eric Montell,
extensive testing at other universities
reveals that a tray requires approxi
mately 1/3 of a gallon of water to wash.
He estimates that Stanford Dining is
able to save approximately several
hundred gallons of water every day,
assuming a modest 20 percent reduc
tion in tray use over baseline usage in
Stern and Wilbur.

"We've been quite pleased with the
results so far," Montell wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "Our observational
data would suggest that the number of
students dining without a tray corre
lates fairly well to the percentage of
surveyed students who responded
favorably to the initiative, which was
among our measures of success."
"Unfortunately, neither Stern nor
Wilbur have individual water meters,
which makes an exact calculation of
water savings difficult to quantify,"
Montell added.
As for food waste, assuming the
same 20-percent reduction in tray use,
Montell hopes for a decrease of
30,000 pounds over the 2009-10 aca
demic year.
Dining will decide at the end of the
year whether or not to continue with
its trayless efforts. Stanford Dining
has also been working with students
and faculty to use the new trayless
program as a class project in order to
better understand how its effective
ness can be improved, according to
Montell.
For some students, the switch to
trayless has been a fairly painless tran
sition.
"For me, it was pretty easy adapt
ing to just having one plate and bring
ing in my food," said Bobby Pinero
'lO.
Although he has used trays for the
past three years, Pinero had almost no
problems giving them up.
"The only thing that's annoying is
going back and forth," he said. "There
have definitely been some traffic
issues, but I think it's been pretty easy
for most people."
However, Pinero is skeptical of
how environmentally effective the ini
tiative has been.
"I don't know what kind of differ
ence it's actually making, but I think it
definitely helps cut down on people
overeating or wasting food," he said.
"It's definitely helped me cut down on
waste, which is probably helping them
provide less food, but I don't know if
I actually believe what they're saying
about saving water."
"I actually think it's great," added
KylieTuosto 'll on Dining's initiative.
"Regardless of what it's doing for the
environment, it makes me feel really
good about myself because I tend to
eat a lot less and a lot faster."
