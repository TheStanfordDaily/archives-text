## TRUE LIFE: I have an eating disorder PART ONE IN A SERIES OF TWO 
### E. BLAIR LAING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Once it gets to the point that you legitimately
have an eating disorder, you don't have a life. It
takes everything from you."
—Janelle Leatherwood 'lO
Eating disorders, and body image in general,
are difficult things to talk about. No one
wants to ask their recently slimmed-down
friend if they are anorexic conversely, no
one wants to admit that they have a problem.
In our sheltered bubble at Stanford, it's easy
to think that we live in an idyllic place where
these "issues" don't exist.
EATING DISORDER CARE TEAM
"Issues with body image and eating disor
ders are very much alive at Stanford," said Dr.
Naomi Brown, a psychologist with Counsel
ing and Psychological Services (CAPS).
"There is so much pressure and competition
built in. And because of the climate, students
can exercise all the time."
Dr. Brown is in her 12th year at Stanford
and serves as the psychologist on the three
member eating disorder care team at Vaden
along with physician Dr. Robyn Tepper and
nutrionist Vivian Crisman. They work in col
laboration with the rest of the staff at Vaden
to diagnose and help students who suffer
from eating disorders.
"About 35-40 percent of the students I see
each year are students with eating disorders
or disordered eating," Crisman said. "Just a
handful of students leave each year. The vast
majority are just those that struggle through."
Disordered eating is a subclinical level of
eating disorder, and can refer to a variety of
unusual eating behaviors. Disordered eating
can include an obsession with exercising or
with avoiding high calorie foods. It can also
include stress eating or covert binge eating.
"It is not unusual for students to come to
me first," Crisman said. "I am the least scary
person to come to. From there, we discuss if
they would be open to speaking to Dr.
Brown."
"I'm the go-to psychologist for students
with disordered eating, eating disorders or
body image issues," Dr. Brown said. "Vaden
doesn't turn away anyone; we at least provide
evaluation and assessment. But we are prima
rily a brief therapy outlet as opposed to long
term. We have to refer out most cases."

But the team is working against structural
issues, with the understaffed team unable to
deal with the growing demand for their serv
ices.

"We don't have enough resources at
Vaden," Dr. Brown said. "We need more eat
ing disorder specialists. We need more nutri
tion hours. And we do not have the resources
to do outreach because we are too busy in
clinic, and so we have to depend on student
groups."
"We try to do the best we can with the re
sources we have," nutritionist Vivian Crisman
said. "It is a challenge with a half-time nutri
tionist position to serve 15,000 plus students,
to do individual counseling and campus out
reach."
The limited resources available mean that
it can sometimes take a student multiple
weeks to get an appointment with Crisman,
who is unable to take on more than a few reg
ular patients. Dr. Brown faces the same prob
lem.
To expand its outreach, the eating disorder
care team works with each student to come
up with the best individual course of treat
ment. For some students, this means referring
them to an off-campus doctor for outpatient
treatment. For others, this means checking in
to an in-patient treatment facility. In the most
extreme cases, the doctors are able to put a
medical hold on the student's academic
standing, forcing them to take time away from
school to get better.
DORM STAFF
The eating disorder care team at Vaden is
not the only campus support group that has to
refer eating disorder patients elsewhere. For
mer Bridge counselor Yasmine Hamdouche
'lO called The Bridge Peer Counseling Center
a "referral organization."
"In terms of eating disorders, the Bridge
would just refer people right to CAPS," Ham
douche said. "They don't offer real advice,
they just talk people through and listen. They
do not want people to call back, they are not
a consistent support organization."
The Bridge is not the only student support
group to refer affected students to Vaden.
Peer Health Educators (PHEs) and Resident
Assistants (RAs) are also instructed to refer
their eating disorder cases to more experi
enced counselors.
"The big thing is refer, refer, refer," said
Sandra Yen 'lO. "Refer to the nutritionist,
refer to CAPS."
Yen is currently serving as a PHE in east
Flo Mo, and last year worked as an RA in

Cardenal. Through her staff training, she has
learned to recognize the symptoms of poten
tially unhealthy behavior. Fortunately she has
not had to deal with too many students with
eating disorders or body image issues in her
time on staff.

"Nothing has gone overboard," Yen said,
"but there are just things that I have been
trained to pay attention to. If someone is
maybe working out too much, I'll make a note
of it."

Yen also had some issues with students
being concerned about gaining the "freshman
15," but that is nothing compared to the expe
riences of a former RA in an all-freshman
dorm, who asked to remain anonymous for
this article.
"I probably had conversations with a
dozen or so cases in my two years on staff,"
the RA said. "At least three students went
home. The University keeps this really hush
hush. RAs are instructed not to say anything
to anyone because of confidentiality."
This RA in particular felt that Stanford's
response to students suffering from eating
disorders was inadequate,
"Stanford is a recipe for disaster," the RA
said. "You have a bunch of overachievers liv
ing in one place. You have lots of sunshine and
lots of opportunity to look pretty. It is not in
Stanford's interest to help because they are
not a long-term care facility, because they
don't have the resources."
The lack of resources is a recurring prob
lem within the eating disorder community.
PHEs, RAs and Bridge counselors are in
structed to refer students to Vaden, where the
limited resources force the doctors to refer
patients to expensive, off-campus doctors. All
of these hurdles make the process of getting
care very difficult for students looking for
help.
"It often takes two to three weeks to see
the nutritionist," Crisman said. "That could
present a barrier to getting students in when
they are ready."
TRUE STORIES
Janelle Leatherwood 'lO
Janelle Leatherwood's personal battle
with eating disorders started after her fresh
man year of high school.
"I was not ever comfortable in my own
skin," Leatherwood said. "I had thought most
of my childhood that I was overweight. Then
I got sick at the beginning of sophomore year,
and I got out of eating for like a week. I was
elated that I didn't have to eat. It was the best
feeling in the world, like I was a new person."

Leatherwood lost about eight pounds
right away, and decided to become a vegetar
ian to give her an excuse to avoid eating most
of the food her family ate. She also began to
follow the Atkins diet, giving up carbohy
drates.
"I always had an excuse for why I wasn't
eating something," Leatherwood said. "My
rules became a lot more strict as time went on."
In the beginning, she would have two cups
of coffee for breakfast, an apple or two sugar
free Redbulls for lunch, a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich as a snack throughout the day
and the smallest dinner possible. Then she
began to plan to eat only in front of people, to
minimize her meals. She would take breakfast
from home and not eat it, and came up with
excuses to get out of dinner.
"Subway for lunch would be my one meal
every day," Leatherwood said. "Then I started
to get really weak and really sick, and I was
still doing two sports. By winter, I started to
look frightening. But I felt euphoric. I would
lay in bed starving, so I would get up and ex
ercise for hours."
Leatherwood ended up losing about 30
pounds, and finally felt comfortable with her
weight. However, Leatherwood developed a
stomach ulcer from the dehydration and
stress on her stomach and had to go to the
hospital, where they told her she would need
to be constantly eating to help her stomach
heal.
"I had developed dizziness and heart pal
pitations," Leatherwood said. "So many
things were wrong with my body, but I felt
great mentally. But I started eating because I
couldn't get away with not."
That's when the throwing-up started.
"I didn't know how to eat like a normal
person," Leatherwood said. "Every time I ate
I felt like I was going crazy. But once I'd eaten
anything I'd be like 'screw it,' and I'd eat a lot
and then throw it up."
It began infrequently, but eventually pro
gressed to the point where every time
Leatherwood ate, she threw up. She would
plan her day out so that she would be able to
leave to throw up after each meal, and mini
mize her meals.
"It became so integrated into my life,"
Leatherwood said. "That was just how I con
trolled my emotions. If I was disappointed, I
ate something and threw it up. I couldn't let
people know I wasn't perfect. The most I ever
threw up in a day was probably ten to twelve
times. By senior year, I was throwing up usu
ally at least twice a day. I knew which foods
were easier to throw up."

Leatherwood was also exercising daily
and reading about eating disorders. That's
when she got into Stanford. She knew that
things had to change.
"I just had to make myself better enough
to go to Stanford," Leatherwood said. "High
school was easy; I had the free time. My every
waking thought was about food, exercise and
calories. I couldn't do things beside that. I did
n't want to be that person in college. I thought
it was my chance for a fresh start."
Leatherwood would force herself to eat,
and then distract herself from the urge to
throw up by going for walks or reading. Each
day that she went without purging, she would
put a sticker on her calendar. Eventually, she
was eating three meals a day, and keeping
them down.
"It's a decision every day to eat and not
throw up," Leatherwood said. "I have a re
lapse every once in awhile, but it's very rare.
But sometimes I can't think about anything
else, and I want to go on with my life, so I
make myself throw up."
Now, Leatherwood studies eating disor
ders and does research on eating disorder pa
tients for a clinic. She has also worked with
student groups on campus focused on helping
Stanford students with body image issues.
"I am much better for the effort that I
make everyday to be better," Leatherwood
said. "Part of my getting better is letting peo
ple know."

were easier to throw up."

Leatherwood was also exercising daily
and reading about eating disorders. That's
when she got into Stanford. She knew that
things had to change.
"I just had to make myself better enough
to go to Stanford," Leatherwood said. "High
school was easy; I had the free time. My every
waking thought was about food, exercise and
calories. I couldn't do things beside that. I did
n't want to be that person in college. I thought
it was my chance for a fresh start."
Leatherwood would force herself to eat,
and then distract herself from the urge to
throw up by going for walks or reading. Each
day that she went without purging, she would
put a sticker on her calendar. Eventually, she
was eating three meals a day, and keeping
them down.
"It's a decision every day to eat and not
throw up," Leatherwood said. "I have a re
lapse every once in awhile, but it's very rare.
But sometimes I can't think about anything
else, and I want to go on with my life, so I
make myself throw up."
Now, Leatherwood studies eating disor
ders and does research on eating disorder pa
tients for a clinic. She has also worked with
student groups on campus focused on helping
Stanford students with body image issues.
"I am much better for the effort that I
make everyday to be better," Leatherwood
said. "Part of my getting better is letting peo
ple know."

"Once it gets to the point that you legitimately
have an eating disorder, you don't have a life. It
takes everything from you."
—Janelle Leatherwood 'lO
Eating disorders, and body image in general,
are difficult things to talk about. No one
wants to ask their recently slimmed-down
friend if they are anorexic conversely, no
one wants to admit that they have a problem.
In our sheltered bubble at Stanford, it's easy
to think that we live in an idyllic place where
these "issues" don't exist.
EATING DISORDER CARE TEAM
"Issues with body image and eating disor
ders are very much alive at Stanford," said Dr.
Naomi Brown, a psychologist with Counsel
ing and Psychological Services (CAPS).
"There is so much pressure and competition
built in. And because of the climate, students
can exercise all the time."
Dr. Brown is in her 12th year at Stanford
and serves as the psychologist on the three
member eating disorder care team at Vaden
along with physician Dr. Robyn Tepper and
nutrionist Vivian Crisman. They work in col
laboration with the rest of the staff at Vaden
to diagnose and help students who suffer
from eating disorders.
"About 35-40 percent of the students I see
each year are students with eating disorders
or disordered eating," Crisman said. "Just a
handful of students leave each year. The vast
majority are just those that struggle through."
Disordered eating is a subclinical level of
eating disorder, and can refer to a variety of
unusual eating behaviors. Disordered eating
can include an obsession with exercising or
with avoiding high calorie foods. It can also
include stress eating or covert binge eating.
"It is not unusual for students to come to
me first," Crisman said. "I am the least scary
person to come to. From there, we discuss if
they would be open to speaking to Dr.
Brown."
"I'm the go-to psychologist for students
with disordered eating, eating disorders or
body image issues," Dr. Brown said. "Vaden
doesn't turn away anyone; we at least provide
evaluation and assessment. But we are prima
rily a brief therapy outlet as opposed to long
term. We have to refer out most cases."

But the team is working against structural
issues, with the understaffed team unable to
deal with the growing demand for their serv
ices.

"We don't have enough resources at
Vaden," Dr. Brown said. "We need more eat
ing disorder specialists. We need more nutri
tion hours. And we do not have the resources
to do outreach because we are too busy in
clinic, and so we have to depend on student
groups."
"We try to do the best we can with the re
sources we have," nutritionist Vivian Crisman
said. "It is a challenge with a half-time nutri
tionist position to serve 15,000 plus students,
to do individual counseling and campus out
reach."
The limited resources available mean that
it can sometimes take a student multiple
weeks to get an appointment with Crisman,
who is unable to take on more than a few reg
ular patients. Dr. Brown faces the same prob
lem.
To expand its outreach, the eating disorder
care team works with each student to come
up with the best individual course of treat
ment. For some students, this means referring
them to an off-campus doctor for outpatient
treatment. For others, this means checking in
to an in-patient treatment facility. In the most
extreme cases, the doctors are able to put a
medical hold on the student's academic
standing, forcing them to take time away from
school to get better.
DORM STAFF
The eating disorder care team at Vaden is
not the only campus support group that has to
refer eating disorder patients elsewhere. For
mer Bridge counselor Yasmine Hamdouche
'lO called The Bridge Peer Counseling Center
a "referral organization."
"In terms of eating disorders, the Bridge
would just refer people right to CAPS," Ham
douche said. "They don't offer real advice,
they just talk people through and listen. They
do not want people to call back, they are not
a consistent support organization."
The Bridge is not the only student support
group to refer affected students to Vaden.
Peer Health Educators (PHEs) and Resident
Assistants (RAs) are also instructed to refer
their eating disorder cases to more experi
enced counselors.
"The big thing is refer, refer, refer," said
Sandra Yen 'lO. "Refer to the nutritionist,
refer to CAPS."
Yen is currently serving as a PHE in east
Flo Mo, and last year worked as an RA in

Cardenal. Through her staff training, she has
learned to recognize the symptoms of poten
tially unhealthy behavior. Fortunately she has
not had to deal with too many students with
eating disorders or body image issues in her
time on staff.

"Nothing has gone overboard," Yen said,
"but there are just things that I have been
trained to pay attention to. If someone is
maybe working out too much, I'll make a note
of it."

Yen also had some issues with students
being concerned about gaining the "freshman
15," but that is nothing compared to the expe
riences of a former RA in an all-freshman
dorm, who asked to remain anonymous for
this article.
"I probably had conversations with a
dozen or so cases in my two years on staff,"
the RA said. "At least three students went
home. The University keeps this really hush
hush. RAs are instructed not to say anything
to anyone because of confidentiality."
This RA in particular felt that Stanford's
response to students suffering from eating
disorders was inadequate,
"Stanford is a recipe for disaster," the RA
said. "You have a bunch of overachievers liv
ing in one place. You have lots of sunshine and
lots of opportunity to look pretty. It is not in
Stanford's interest to help because they are
not a long-term care facility, because they
don't have the resources."
The lack of resources is a recurring prob
lem within the eating disorder community.
PHEs, RAs and Bridge counselors are in
structed to refer students to Vaden, where the
limited resources force the doctors to refer
patients to expensive, off-campus doctors. All
of these hurdles make the process of getting
care very difficult for students looking for
help.
"It often takes two to three weeks to see
the nutritionist," Crisman said. "That could
present a barrier to getting students in when
they are ready."
TRUE STORIES
Janelle Leatherwood 'lO
Janelle Leatherwood's personal battle
with eating disorders started after her fresh
man year of high school.
"I was not ever comfortable in my own
skin," Leatherwood said. "I had thought most
of my childhood that I was overweight. Then
I got sick at the beginning of sophomore year,
and I got out of eating for like a week. I was
elated that I didn't have to eat. It was the best
feeling in the world, like I was a new person."

Leatherwood lost about eight pounds
right away, and decided to become a vegetar
ian to give her an excuse to avoid eating most
of the food her family ate. She also began to
follow the Atkins diet, giving up carbohy
drates.
"I always had an excuse for why I wasn't
eating something," Leatherwood said. "My
rules became a lot more strict as time went on."
In the beginning, she would have two cups
of coffee for breakfast, an apple or two sugar
free Redbulls for lunch, a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich as a snack throughout the day
and the smallest dinner possible. Then she
began to plan to eat only in front of people, to
minimize her meals. She would take breakfast
from home and not eat it, and came up with
excuses to get out of dinner.
"Subway for lunch would be my one meal
every day," Leatherwood said. "Then I started
to get really weak and really sick, and I was
still doing two sports. By winter, I started to
look frightening. But I felt euphoric. I would
lay in bed starving, so I would get up and ex
ercise for hours."
Leatherwood ended up losing about 30
pounds, and finally felt comfortable with her
weight. However, Leatherwood developed a
stomach ulcer from the dehydration and
stress on her stomach and had to go to the
hospital, where they told her she would need
to be constantly eating to help her stomach
heal.
"I had developed dizziness and heart pal
pitations," Leatherwood said. "So many
things were wrong with my body, but I felt
great mentally. But I started eating because I
couldn't get away with not."
That's when the throwing-up started.
"I didn't know how to eat like a normal
person," Leatherwood said. "Every time I ate
I felt like I was going crazy. But once I'd eaten
anything I'd be like 'screw it,' and I'd eat a lot
and then throw it up."
It began infrequently, but eventually pro
gressed to the point where every time
Leatherwood ate, she threw up. She would
plan her day out so that she would be able to
leave to throw up after each meal, and mini
mize her meals.
"It became so integrated into my life,"
Leatherwood said. "That was just how I con
trolled my emotions. If I was disappointed, I
ate something and threw it up. I couldn't let
people know I wasn't perfect. The most I ever
threw up in a day was probably ten to twelve
times. By senior year, I was throwing up usu
ally at least twice a day. I knew which foods
were easier to throw up."

Leatherwood was also exercising daily
and reading about eating disorders. That's
when she got into Stanford. She knew that
things had to change.
"I just had to make myself better enough
to go to Stanford," Leatherwood said. "High
school was easy; I had the free time. My every

look frightening. But I felt euphoric. I would
lay in bed starving, so I would get up and ex
ercise for hours."
Leatherwood ended up losing about 30
pounds, and finally felt comfortable with her
weight. However, Leatherwood developed a
stomach ulcer from the dehydration and
stress on her stomach and had to go to the
hospital, where they told her she would need
to be constantly eating to help her stomach
heal.
"I had developed dizziness and heart pal
pitations," Leatherwood said. "So many
things were wrong with my body, but I felt
great mentally. But I started eating because I
couldn't get away with not."
That's when the throwing-up started.
"I didn't know how to eat like a normal
person," Leatherwood said. "Every time I ate
I felt like I was going crazy. But once I'd eaten
anything I'd be like 'screw it,' and I'd eat a lot
and then throw it up."
It began infrequently, but eventually pro
gressed to the point where every time
Leatherwood ate, she threw up. She would
plan her day out so that she would be able to
leave to throw up after each meal, and mini
mize her meals.
"It became so integrated into my life,"
Leatherwood said. "That was just how I con
trolled my emotions. If I was disappointed, I
ate something and threw it up. I couldn't let
people know I wasn't perfect. The most I ever
threw up in a day was probably ten to twelve
times. By senior year, I was throwing up usu
ally at least twice a day. I knew which foods
were easier to throw up."

Leatherwood was also exercising daily
and reading about eating disorders. That's
when she got into Stanford. She knew that
things had to change.
"I just had to make myself better enough
to go to Stanford," Leatherwood said. "High
school was easy; I had the free time. My every
waking thought was about food, exercise and
calories. I couldn't do things beside that. I did
n't want to be that person in college. I thought
it was my chance for a fresh start."
Leatherwood would force herself to eat,
and then distract herself from the urge to
throw up by going for walks or reading. Each
day that she went without purging, she would
put a sticker on her calendar. Eventually, she
was eating three meals a day, and keeping
them down.
"It's a decision every day to eat and not
throw up," Leatherwood said. "I have a re
lapse every once in awhile, but it's very rare.
But sometimes I can't think about anything
else, and I want to go on with my life, so I
make myself throw up."
Now, Leatherwood studies eating disor
ders and does research on eating disorder pa
tients for a clinic. She has also worked with
student groups on campus focused on helping
Stanford students with body image issues.
"I am much better for the effort that I
make everyday to be better," Leatherwood
said. "Part of my getting better is letting peo
ple know."
