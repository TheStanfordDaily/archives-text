In "TB testing lab built m N.
Korea" (March 3), The Daily incor
rectly reported that all 22 team
members were from Stanford and
the Bay Area. In fact, the team in
cluded members from outside the
area.

In "The Math 51 roadblock"
(Feb. 21), The Daily incorrectly re
ported that the math department
recommends that students who earn
a score of four on the Advanced
Placement AB Calculus test, or
three on BC Calculus, take Math 51.
In fact, the department recommends
that students who earn a score of
five on the AB test, or four or five on
the BC test, take Math 51.
