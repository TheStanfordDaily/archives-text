Reyad Fezzani, CEO of BP Solar, a subsidiary of
British Petroleum (BP), spoke to a seminar room filled
with Stanford students and professors Wednesday on the
burgeoning solar energy industry and the key role China
will play in its future.
The talk was part of the weekly Energy Seminar series,
which hosts events every Wednesday on a broad range of
energy topics.
Fezzani had just completed a 10-day trip to China,
where BP, the fourth largest company in the world and
third largest in energy, has invested $5 billion in the coun
try the largest sum by any foreign investor.
He said China one of the largest emitters of green
house gases and consumers of coal and crude oil is also
a dominant force in fighting pollution through its invest
ment in renewable energy. Efforts from government and
industry have made it into the world's largest solar product
producer; its green economy could reach $1 trillion a year
and be a whopping 15 percent of the nation's forecasted
2013 GDP.
China's vision of its future, Fezzani explained, is highly
ambitious. On a chart showing China's current and future
economic goals, the red line representing GDP shot right
through the top of the graph, toward a quadrupled GDP
by 2020. At the same time, however, China is seeking to
drastically reduce energy consumption per unit GDP, aim
ing for a 20 percent reduction by 2010 and a 45 percent re
duction by 2020.
"Every time China sets a target," he said, "it surpasses it
very quickly, and then sets the bar even higher."
Fezzani attributed China's growth in the green industry
to government action in providing infrastructure and sub
sidies to spur growth. The "Golden Sun" project promises
to subsidize 50 percent of the construction and distribution
costs of solar projects.
Citing an example where a solar energy producer went
to the government for help, Fezzani told of his surprise at
the government's willingness to help.
"Local government said, 'We'll give you even bigger
plots of land and give it to you for free,"' Fezzani said.
In response to an audience question about whether he
feels rooftop solar systems are superior to solar farms, he
chose the latter, arguing that while profit margins may be
better with rooftop, solar farms provide a much better op
portunity for expansion in the long term.
A major emphasis of Fezzani's talk was how other
countries such as the United States, where $3B billion of
the latest stimulus package has been allocated to renew
able energy projects, can learn from China in its invest
ment in the green industry.

Fezzani argued that "feed-in tariffs" a policy mecha
nism that reduces risk involved in adopting renewable en
ergy through long-term contracts and guaranteed access to
grids play a key role in effective government invest
ment. He argued that the United States' primary means of
spurring growth, a system of tax incentives, is empirically
ineffective in comparison.
Fezzani also reminded the audience of renewable ener
gy's relationship to higher education. He highlighted how
the Chinese labor force plays a big part in this growth.
"Labor is not just cheap, but intelligent," he said, noting
the 600,000 engineers that China's universities produce
annually.
Rather than viewing the educated Chinese labor force
as a threat, Fezzani argued that industry's growth should
be considered an invitation for talent, no matter its nation
al origin. In what he called a "democracy of education," he
highlighted the surprising number of non-Chinese stu
dents in Chinese universities and firms, and emphasized
the need for outside talent to meet the demands of China's
growing solar industry.
