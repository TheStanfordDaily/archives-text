## EDITORIAL Delays jeopardize support for high-speed rail program 
### 
The Stanford Review recently ran an edi
torial presenting an argument against
constructing a high-speed train in Cali
fornia in order to foster more debate on the
subject. The Editorial Board commends the
Review's interest in debating this topic, but
wants to preface this debate with few important
points.
For starters, California residents need to un
derstand that it is rather unlikely that the plan
to build a high-speed rail through the state will
now be abandoned when over $ll billion in
public funds have already been committed to
wards the project. We must also reiterate the
fact that the residents of California approved
this project in a referendum in 2008. The ques
tion is no longer whether California should
build a high-speed rail, but how California can
build this high-speed rail to provide the great
est benefits to the state at the lowest cost to Cal
ifornians.This question is significantly more dif
ficult to answer.
Today, the High Speed Rail Authority of
California should unveil a long-delayed plan
that will detail the authority's plan for con
structing the segment of the train that will run
through the Peninsula. This plan was originally
scheduled to be released in December, but was
delayed after significant opposition from
Peninsula-area neighborhoods in which the
proposed rail could stop Menlo Park, Palo
Alto and Los Altos. Since the government an
nounced over $2 billion in additional funding
for this project, this process has been mired in
unexpected delays. While the Editorial Board
does not withdraw its support for this project,
we do realize that these delays place the resi
dents of California in a very unfair situation.
Considering that most of the public funding for
this project comes with the stipulation that it is

completed according to defined timelines, any
delay comes at the expense of taxpayers.
This delay in particular has perplexed con
cerned residents of the Peninsula for months,
leaving them to wonder whether they will
have to gather in protest of the plan or
whether the plan has spared their communi
ties from any perceived inconvenience. Be
cause the project's start day cannot be de
layed, the time that is being lost is coming from
the valuable period of debate, in which com
promises and adjustments can suit the state
best. Because these delays are diminishing the
public's opportunity to debate, it becomes an
important concern that taxpayers will not be
satisfied with this project, making it much
more of a burden to a state that already suffers
from an intolerable budget deficit. The com
munities in opposition of this rail are not only
concerned with the fiscal costs of this project,
but also concerned with what such significant
construction and subsequent structures can
do to their cities integrity and atmosphere. If
recent events are example of things to come,
then significant changes must be made to the
timeline for this project in order to allow an
adequate deliberation process.
We look forward to reviewing the Authori
ty's plan for this project and hope to debate the
merits and shortcomings of this proposal in the
near future. Despite all of the estimations of
this project's cost to taxpayers in the long run,
no accurate estimates can be made until the
High Speed Rail Authority's plan is disseminat
ed to California residents. We emphatically dis
approve of the delays that have occurred and
warn the High Speed Rail Authority that de
lays like this in the future may cause the Edito
rial Board, as well as the residents of California,
to withdraw their support for this project.
