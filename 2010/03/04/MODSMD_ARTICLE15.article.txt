# ALTERNATIVE LIVING...WITHOUT THE NAKED
## Experiencing Plastic of Paris 
### Samantha Toh 
Last Saturday, I sat, quite despondent, in a
corner of my room. Around me like a
swelling tide pulsed a barrage of plastic
bags, crinkling in the breeze. Had this been a
film, there would have been angsty indie music
drifting across the silent Parisian night, and I
would have been wearing copious amounts of
eyeliner. Instead, I remained a small and help
less female who, resembling a flightless bird,
flapped among the plastic with rising panic.
To some, such as my kindly friends in Paris, I
was being but "a really terrible Asian cartoon."
While that comment did invalidate my exis
tence for several minutes, I believe that my de
spair was rooted in another, more legitimate
source.
The fact is: as somebody who had always re
jected plastic bags at supermarkets and shops, I
would never have accumulated such a collec
tion. Yet here I was, among mountains. Appar
ently, I had convinced myself along the way that
I might have wanted a souvenir of some memo
rial, with its name printed on a plastic bag. That
was bag number one. Plastic bag number two
came with the fear of refusing it due to my atro
cious French, a reason also the source of my
plastic bag number 512. Paris was, apparently,
changing me in ways I had never imagined pos
sible.
One cannot, of course, blame the city. Paris is
in the process of changing me in other ways,
ways not altogether bad. For one, I have begun
to eat carrots, a root I have always cowed from
because they are orange, and therefore, by some
strange association, toxic. I have begun to enjoy
cheese and to learn how to read maps. I am now
more spontaneous, less afraid of the cold and
willing to drink strong cups of coffee in the
morning.
Plastic bags, however, are the limit, and, I
think, for a good reason: I am a self-declared
mildly-crazed environmentalist, and have been
for a while. And while demanding fewer plastics
is only an infinitesimal part of conserving the
environment, the action of accepting a plastic
bag at a supermarket draws a highly symbolic
line, one that divides action and apathy.
I find it curious that I care so much. Once, I
tried to psychoanalyze the relationship between
myself and the environment. Maybe I cared be
cause it was too easy not to. Maybe it was just
nice to have an apparently selfless goal. Eventu
ally, I realized that while there were many psy
chological reasons I could pull out of my ecolog
ically-conscious derri?re, the facts should be
clear to anyone with a bit of common sense. The
environmental risk of not caring is exceedingly
high, and this is taking low probability, high-de
struction scenarios out of the picture.
I am not just speaking from the perspective
of someone who grew up in a tropical country
where summers are noticeably hotter now, and
where mornings provide briefer and briefer
respites. Personal comfort is important, and I
certainly don't want to fly back each summer to
an inferno of humid doom.
At the same time, there are a bevy of other
reasons to be concerned, most of which we have
all heard before. The link between climate
change and the inequality of its impact is very
real, for example, with the poorest being hit the
hardest. The increasing cost of adaptation with
increasing climatic extremes increases the op
portunity costs of any present inaction. And so
on.
Climate change, however, is not all that is at
stake. What strikes me the hardest is the de-

struction of natural landscapes and habitats,
many of which I have found profoundly mov
ing. I have been dragged around in toboggans in
the middle of expansive deserts and hiked for
hours on snow-covered mountains. I have stood
in the middle of rolling green fields that I can't
imagine changed, and by natural beaches where
fat otters slop around and are adorable. Realiz
ing that more than just people and material
goods exist is liberating, and needing to protect
what gives me that liberation is what sheaths
this whole planet conservation thing in urgency.
It is frustrating that my resistance to plastic
bags is not taken seriously. I acknowledge that
refusing one at Wal-Mart does not exactly make
me Captain Planet. Yet refusing one plastic bag
reminds me to continue refusing others. It re
minds me to recycle, to reuse, to buy less. It even
helps me remind other people to start living a
little greener.
I am not a hippie. I do not want to live in a
tree. I do not overuse the words "soul," "love,"
"spirit" or any combination of the three that
might make the average citizen vomit up his or
her breakfast (I am, as I will remind you, re
pressed). But some kind of environmental con
sciousness, I believe, needs to become a bigger
part of everyday culture. If one of my plastic
bags saved can play a part of reducing total plas
tic demand, I will keep doing it, and this will
begin again tomorrow.
If I will remind you, even Captain Planet
said, with all his dashing cheese, "The power is
yours."
