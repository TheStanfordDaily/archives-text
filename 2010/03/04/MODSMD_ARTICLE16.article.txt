# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Benefits of Grading? 
### Danny Crichton 
It is always in the days leading up to the end
of the quarter that I am reminded of how
powerful grades are as a motivator at Stan
ford. When the quarter begins, there are notably
interesting conversations on a range of intellec
tual topics as students engage in new classes and
explore new ideas. But by the end of the quar
ter, those conversations are hard, if not impossi
ble, to find (case in point: I was eating with a
table of eight for 30 minutes last week before
someone finally said anything. And it was a re
quest for a napkin).
It is also around this time of the quarter that
I attempt (always unsuccessfully) to reconcile
grading with the fundamental nature of educa
tion. A liberal education is about exploring dif
ferent subjects, engaging with the knowledge of
the human legacy and experimenting with var
ied ideas. Yet, how can one explore when there
is always that looming grade just 10 weeks
away? How can one experiment with new ideas
and have intellectual conversations when there
is a midterm a week (in addition to the usual
load of problem sets and essays)?
Perhaps unsurprisingly, my first real intellec
tual stimulation here at Stanford has been writ
ing an honors thesis an opportunity to ex
plore a topic without that looming grade in the
background. For the first time, I have been able
to chart my own course, take a different direc
tion for a little while and still manage to gain an
enormous amount of knowledge about a host of
different topics.
This process of writing a thesis has made me
particularly angry at how Stanford has slowly
changed its grading to become less about intel
lectual discovery and more about differentiat
ing students. Believe it or not, it was not always

like this. Just a little more than a decade ago,
Stanford used to make the official transcript a
record of achievement students could with
draw from classes quite late in the quarter with
out penalty. One could test the waters in a class
until almost the final and still back away without
harm or foul.
Compare that system with the one we have
today: students are forced to lock in their class
es by week three. That could mean less than six
lectures have elapsed before a student has to
decide which of a handful of classes is most valu
able for their education. It also means that little
assessment has been given to a student, pre
venting informed decisions, as well.
This tightening of the drop deadline and lack
of feedback only encourages students to pursue
the safety of the fields they know, and it is unfor
tunate that the faculty of this school believe that
convenience is more important than intellectu
al exploration.
Writing a thesis has also forced me to come
to terms with one of the complex aspects of my
intellectual journey my views on science ed
ucation. I have written before on this topic, but
I have to say, my views have become much less
subtle.
I used to defend the kind of science training
that schools like Stanford provide large lec
ture classes mixed with personalized research to
get experience in a lab. I believe it is uncon
scionable to defend this system now. Most sci
ence classes at Stanford are graded on a curve. I
have tried to understand the pedagogical rea
son for such a system, and I have now given up
there simply is no value.
The point of assessments like grades is to
provide individualized feedback to a student to

indicate a level of progress in a body of knowl
edge.That is the antithesis of grading on a curve,
which is designed to differentiate students as a
group, sort of like sheep being separated into
USDA Prime meat and other categories.
What would make sense in practical training
like engineering and science is a bar system
did people learn the material at a level consis
tent with the goals of the program? Instead, we
use a relative system in which students compete
with one another for a few choice awards. I used
to compare the sciences to the law school in
terms of competition for grades, except the law
school has moved off the curve now. The sci
ences are alone in their metrics.
Imagine a system in which students do not
have to compete with each other for grades, but
instead spent that brain energy on learning the
material for their own benefit. The bar can be
set high, but every student has the capability to
meet the bar and get top marks. Education, in
stead of a competitive venture, could become
one of cooperation, of shared intellectual dis
covery.
But who am I kidding? This is a university,
and the pursuit of knowledge and learning in
the sciences is not a priority. We would have
changed the system a long time ago if that were
the case. Instead, we will continue to fret about
the lack of scientists and engineers in this coun
try (I wonder why?). As for me, I have a prob
lem set to finish.
