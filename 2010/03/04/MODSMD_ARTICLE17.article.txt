# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
Last Friday, The Daily published a letter
to the editor written by former Editor in
Chief Charlie Hoffman '73 MBA '76 ex
plaining a few of The Daily's more dubious fi
nancial practices and generally endorsing The
Daily's requests for special fees.This endorse
ment comes as The Daily petitions for nearly
$90,000 from the student body a 53 percent
increase over last year and just one day
after current Editor in Chief Kamil Dada pub
lished a column outlining The Daily's elec
tions coverage policies and explicitly stating
that The Daily would not run op-eds that sup
port a particular group's special fee request.
Here's part of what Dada had to say:
"However, some guidelines are needed. I
do not wish to run any op-eds that relate to
student groups declaring why they deserve
special fees or should be on the ballot. Groups
could fill our opinion page for weeks well out
lasting election season with legitimate cases
for why they deserve to be on the ballot and it
isn't The Daily's role to promote or publicize
these groups."
Aside from the piece's glaring inconsisten
cies with The Daily's own election coverage

policies, I would like to address the failures of
Hoffman's letter. The letter appears to be a
much overdue, yet very limited response to an
article that I wrote and published in The Re
view back in January. In that investigative arti
cle, I explored several of The Daily's recent IRS
Form 990s and found that The Daily has not al
ways been perfectly honest with information
surrounding their request for special fees (or as
they call it,"a modest subscription fee").
As Hoffman explains in his letter, since
1991 The Daily has operated a subsidiary non
profit organization known as The Friends of
the Daily Foundation to provide monetary
support for The Daily in tough financial years.
While Hoffman, who has served as president
of The Friends since its establishment, does
address the history and function of The
Friends, he makes no mention of the crux of
my report - namely questions concerning a
$260,000 cash exchange from The Daily to the
Friends at a time when The Daily claimed
poverty and successfully petitioned for nearly
$50,000 in student funding.
Though Hoffman assures us that, "...The
Friends is an open and transparent organiza

tion," financial information concerning The
Friends has not been made available to the
student body. The Daily's online special fees
petition page merely mentions that such a
foundation exists. The Friends and The Daily
had combined assets totaling more than $1.5
million according to their most recent (2008)
IRS filings.
I read The Daily frequently, I don't want it
to suffer financially, and I certainly don't want
funding issues to stifle Stanford's student jour
nalism. That said, I cannot support The Daily's
bid for special fees until the charges above are
addressed. There can be no doubt that The
Daily and newspapers throughout the country
are faced with extraordinarily financially try
ing times. Silence, however, is not an accept
able answer to the allegations at hand.
Dada said it best: "The very nature of jour
nalism means that clear, transparent and ethi
cal rules must not only be set in place, but also
strictly observed." I could not agree more.
