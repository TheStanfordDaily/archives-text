## Appropriations Committee guided by false logic 
### PETER DAVIS '11 
This year, the ASSU Senate Appropria
tions Committee has undertaken an un
precedented effort to reduce student
groups' special fees budgets. For the sake of
full disclosure, I am a member of one of these
groups, the Society for International Affairs
at Stanford (SIAS); our proposed budget was
cut by 67 percent, from $24,000 to $B,OOO. My
group's situation is far from unique; Basmati
Ras requested $16,000 and the Appropria
tions Committee recommended $10,380;
FLiCKS requested $76,692 and was recom
mended $67,742; The Bridge requested
$9,201, but was recommended $4,691. And
this is only a small sampling of the cuts made
by the Appropriations Committee,
In some cases, these cuts may encourage
efficiency among student groups, forcing
them to do more with less. In others, they crip

pie the ability of groups to complete their
core functions. From what I have gathered,
the Senate Appropriations Committee bases
these cuts on several assertions. First, substan
tial increases in special fees in recent years
have put undue strain on students' budgets.
Second, because of these increases, more stu
dents have been requesting refunds, creating
a difficult fiscal situation for the ASSU and
student groups. These assertions are based on
flawed logic, and the actions taken by the
committee using this logic threaten the exis
tence and function of student groups at Stan
ford.

According to an op-ed by Senate Appro
priations Chair Anton Zietsman in The Daily
last week, students' activities fees have in
creased from $96 per student per quarter
three years ago to $ll9 now. This means that
students are paying $69 more per year now
than they did three years ago on special fees.
Students also are paying $2,580 more per year
in tuition now than they did three years ago.
Increases in special fees only function as 2.6
percent of the total increase. So has this in
crease in student activities fee ($23 per quar
ter) put a noticeable undue strain on students

budget? In most cases, probably not, especial
ly given that students on full financial aid do
not have to pay the student activities fee re
gardless of the increase. It is my belief that,
when taken in the context of total increases,
the slight increases in special fees over the last
three years have not put a noticeable or sig
nificant strain on Stanford students.

Mr. Zietsman argues that because of this
strain, student refund rates have gone way up.
But this is not the case. More students aren't
requesting refunds because special fees has
gone up $23 per quarter, but because they
have only realized this year that they could
even get refunds. Part of this increased aware
ness is due to the flyer campaigns by the Stan
ford Conservative Society. If students can get
money without seeing any decrease in their
quality of life, they will do it. Reducing special
fees by $lO or more a quarter will not reduce
the number of refund requests.
I will be the first to admit that the previous
ASSU Senate's special fees policies were un
sustainable. Student groups should not be
able to receive a 10-percent increase plus in
flation every year without petitioning. But the
Senate Appropriations Committee's policies

and cuts are disproportionate to the problem.
Their fiscal conservatism based on flawed
logic and ideology threatens the existence of
many student groups at Stanford, putting an
impediment on the ability of these groups to
provide for their members and the Stanford
community at large.
