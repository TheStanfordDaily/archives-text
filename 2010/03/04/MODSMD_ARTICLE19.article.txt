# Sigma Nu Withdraws Special Fees Application
## 
### Sincerely, MICHAEL TERRELL'11 Sigma Nu President 
Due to ASSU regulations about special
fees eligibility, Sigma Nu will be with
drawing its special fees application. In
order to qualify for special fees, the ASSU re
quires that student groups have an "objective
selection criteria." We, as a Greek Organiza
tion, are categorized as having a "subjective
selection criteria." While we take some issue
with this categorization, we will be abiding by
their policy, and thus, discontinuing our pur
suit of special fees.
We will keep open the option of
contesting these regulations in the
future, perhaps with a larger coali
tion of our Greek peers. We main
tain that Greek Organizations pro
vide a substantial social and com
munal service to Stanford, and hope
that funding options such as special
fees will be accessible in the future.
Thank you to all of you who sup
ported our petition. We look for
ward to a great year ahead.
