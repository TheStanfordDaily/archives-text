# Sigma Nu Withdraws Special Fees Application
## 
### Sincerely, MICHAEL TERRELL'11 Sigma Nu President 
Due to ASSU regulations about special
fees eligibility, Sigma Nu will be with
drawing its special fees application. In
order to qualify for special fees, the ASSU re
quires that student groups have an "objective
selection criteria." We, as a Greek Organiza
tion, are categorized as having a "subjective
selection criteria." While we take some issue
with this categorization, we will be abiding by
their policy, and thus, discontinuing our pur
suit of special fees.
