## Battling Bay Area rivals 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Rebounding positively from a tough week
end, the No. 14 Stanford women's tennis team
(7-1) is looking to regain its momentum
against Saint Mary's (6-2) on Thursday before
facing off against Bay Area rivals, No. 5 Cali
fornia (8-2).
One of the things the team needed to know
was how well it could bounce back from ad
versity, and the big loss to UCLA this past
weekend has proven to be a perfect test for the
players. With one of the largest losses in recent
head-to-head history, UCLA beat Stanford 6-
1, including an upset in doubles. Fortunately,
the Cardinal has only used this loss to moti
vate its efforts.
"It was a wake up call in some ways," said
senior Lindsay Burdette. "It's just helping us
realize that we definitely need to lay it out
there every single day in practice and we might
still come up against a team that plays unbe
lievably that day. Those things are out of our
control, but we need to make sure we're work
ing harder to minimize the things that are in
our control."
Burdette looks to her older sister for an ex
ample on how to deal with losses like these,
Erin Burdette played for Stanford from 2001
to 2005. In her time here, she amassed a 77-16
dual record tied for the 15th most wins in
Stanford history and a record of 118-30
overall and was the 2005 NCAA Doubles
Champion.
"Whenever I talk to my older sister, she
says the team always had one token loss,"
Lindsay Burdette said. "It absolutely fueled
their fire and engaged them for the rest of the
season. She rarely talked about the 7-0 wins
over opponents, but I'll never forget the way
she talked about those losses. In this situation,
I think about it in the same way. I know we're
as talented as all those teams out there."

When asked about how the team as a whole
was responding, head coach Lele Forood said
it was tough to play against a team like UCLA
that came out so strong for a weekend at
home.
"There is no doubt about it, we're disap
pointed with our performance down there,"
Forood said. "We know we need to do better. I
think it was our first big Pac-10 match of the
year, clearly. We ran into a very hot UCLA
team at their place and they swept the Bay
Area teams over the weekend. They came out
and played a little better than we did."
TTie next big task is to see how the Cardinal
responds to this loss going into its match
against Saint Mary's and, more importantly, in
its rivalry game against California. Saint
Mary's is ranked No. 55 in the nation and has
only two losses so far, one of them coming
against Stanford's other weekend opponent,
California.
Ranked No. 5 in the nation, California has
had a very successful season, suffering only
two losses to No. 1 Northwestern and recently
No. 4 UCLA. With the No. 2 player in the na
tion in Jana Juricova in addition to two other
ranked players, the Golden Bears' singles line
up is pretty powerful. However, it is their No.
13 doubles unit of Juricova and Mari Anders
son that has personal history with Stanford.
The two defeated Stanford's No. 1 pair of
Barte and Burdette in last year's NCAA Dou
bles Final, and the two will be looking for re
venge this weekend.
"It's going to be tough, a dogfight," said
junior Hilary Barte. "By no means are they
going to hand [the match] to us, and personal
ly I wouldn't want it any other way."
If this year's match is anything like last
year's battles, the Cardinal is in for a fight.
With both matches being decided by the score
of 4-3 in 2009, the contests were nothing if not

Junior Hilary Barte and senior Lindsay Burdette have formed one of the most formidable doubles teams
in the nation, but will face the tough duo of Jana Juricova and Mari Andersson of Cal this weekend.
