# Judgment has no place in Olympics
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
The Olympic Games have the
unique quality of making
certain sports relevant to the
casual sports fan. Only once
every four years do we real
ly care, as a nation, about snowboard
cross, the giant slalom or figure skating.
For example, if you had heard of
Evan Lysacek before last week, I would
consider that quite an impressive feat.
Though Lysacek won the 2009 World
Championship in men's figure skating,
his accomplishments were irrelevant
until he stepped into the Olympic spot
light and won gold for the United
States. After his incredible win over fa
vorite Evgeni Plushenko of Russia,
every American knew his name
something that would not have oc
curred if he had won every World
Championship for the next 20 years
without winning Olympic glory.
Yet the story of Evan Lysacek's gold
medal reveals something darker about
the Olympics the significant pres
ence of sports that are scored or judged
by humans. In virtually all sports that
fall within the general American con
sciousness, success is fairly concrete
in team sports, the team that scores the
most points or goals wins the game, pe
riod. Beyond the enforcement of rules,
which is fairly objective, there is no
human involvement outside of the par
ticipants themselves they are only
competing against each other, and
when someone wins there is no contro
versy.
There are also many Olympic indi
vidual sports in which the standard for
victory is objective, unbiased and indis
putable. To take examples from the
Winter Games, downhill skiers race
against the clock, competing for the
fastest times. Of course, no sport is free
of controversy witness the Julia
Mancuso-Lindsey Vonn incident last
week but there is never any contro
versy over who won.
The Summer Games also has
prominent examples of objective
sports. Track is probably the purest ath
letic competition there is. It is the sim

plest of sports whoever goes the
fastest and covers the distance in the
shortest time emerges as the winner.
Swimming is also fairly similar; as long
as the swimmers follow the rules (while
human judges ensure that they do so, it
is still a fairly objective exercise), who
ever goes the fastest wins the race, plain
and simple.
In contrast to these sports stand
those events dependent on scores from
subjective, possibly biased human
judges. The most prominent among
these are figure skating in the Winter
Games and diving and gymnastics in
the Summer Olympics. While the sum
mer sports have generated their own
controversies, I'll stick to talking about
the winter ones.

Let's start with figure skating, and
return to Lysacek's gold medal. De
spite Plushenko's superior showman
ship and daring routine, Lysacek won
the competition because he was more

"technically sound." In a sport reliant
on Plushenko-style crowd-pleasing for
its audience, it seems somewhat coun
terintuitive to award more points
based on something that only experts
on the sport (i.e. the judges) can under
stand or even see. For me, the casual
fan, it appeared that Plushenko's rou
tine (which included a quad jump) was
superior to Lysacek's strong but safe
showing.
Regardless of which side you take
in the debate, the fact that the sport al
lows for such debates to exist demon
strates its invalidity as an Olympic
sport. The champion of the Olympic
contest should be clear to all, not open
to criticism. I find it very hard to accept
any figure skating Olympic champions
because I cannot objectively verily that
they are the best in their sport.
Of course, I don't dispute the ath
leticism or skill of figure skaters I
can barely stand up on skates, let alone
jump and spin in the air in them. All I
believe is that you cannot call someone
an Olympic champion based on the
subjective decisions of an anonymous
panel of so-called "experts."
I also hold the same opinion for all

the other judged sports in the Games.
To take another example, let's look at
men's snowboard halfpipe. In the
event, American Shaun White won by
a large margin of 3.4 points over his
nearest competitor. While such a mar
gin makes it fairly clear that White was
the superior athlete, I still find it im
possible to blindly accept that he is an
Olympic champion based on what
some panel of experts has told me. If I
were educated about the sport, I
might concur with their decision, but
without some quantifiable measure
that I can currently comprehend, I re
fuse to simply have faith in an ap
pointed board.
Thus, it is fairly obvious that judged
sports have no place in the Olympics,
the pinnacle of sport. If the casual, ob
jective fan cannot definitively say who
won, then it must be impossible to call
that person an Olympic gold medalist,
as there will always be a grain of doubt
to take the luster off the gold.
