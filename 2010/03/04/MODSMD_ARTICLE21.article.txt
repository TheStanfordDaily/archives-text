# Judgment has no place in Olympics

The Olympic Games have the
unique quality of making
certain sports relevant to the
casual sports fan. Only once
every four years do we real
ly care, as a nation, about snowboard
cross, the giant slalom or figure skating.
For example, if you had heard of
Evan Lysacek before last week, I would
consider that quite an impressive feat.
Though Lysacek won the 2009 World
Championship in men's figure skating,
his accomplishments were irrelevant
until he stepped into the Olympic spot

which is fairly objective, there is no
human involvement outside of the par
ticipants themselves they are only
competing against each other, and
when someone wins there is no contro
versy.
There are also many Olympic indi
vidual sports in which the standard for
victory is objective, unbiased and indis

Winter Games, downhill skiers race
against the clock, competing for the
fastest times. Of course, no sport is free
of controversy witness the Julia
Mancuso-Lindsey Vonn incident last
week but there is never any contro
versy over who won.
The Summer Games also has
prominent examples of objective
sports. Track is probably the purest ath
letic competition there is. It is the sim
