# GETTING BACK ON TRACK
## 
### JUSTIN MARPOLE-BIRD 
When the women's water polo team takes to
the pool this Saturday, it will be the first step in
getting back into the groove that had it previous
ly unbeaten all season.That streak ended on Sat
urday when the Card fell to the No. 2 Trojans of
use.
The top-ranked Stanford women's water
polo team suffered its first setback of the 2010
season on Sunday, as it was denied another UC-
Irvine Invitational title in a 10-6 loss to USC.The
Cardinal opened the day with a 10-4 victory over
No. 3 UCLA in the semifinal round, but fell to
USC later in the day, missing an opportunity for
a second straight UCI Invitational title.
Now No. 2 Stanford (12-1, 1-0 MPSF) pre
pares for a busy weekend of action before the
two-week break for final exams, hosting No. 14
San Diego State and No. 13 UCI Friday and Sat
urday afternoons, respectively, then traveling to
Davis for a Sunday doubleheader. There, the
Cardinal will open with Cal State Bakersfield at
11 a.m. before closing out the weekend with host
No. 15 UC-Davis at 2 p.m.
Looking forward to the competition of the
weekend, San Diego State (10-5) faces the Car
dinal in its MPSF opener Friday, and has split its
past eight games. The Aztecs are led by the play
of Amber Pezzolla (27 goals), while Kelly Cam
poli leads the MPSF with 10.13 saves per game
in the cage.
UCI (7-7) has dropped three of its last four

games heading into the weekend, and is led by
the scoring of Caitlin Haskell (13 goals) and
Jessy Cardey (10 goals) and the goalkeeping of
Lauren Davis (19 saves).
Cal State Bakersfield (7-10) enters the week
end having split its past six contests, and features
scorers Kaitlin Torres (36 goals), Alyson Moss
and Becky Seelos (19 goals apiece). In the cage,
Megan Pezzolla has made 123 saves on the year.
UC-Davis (7-9) has lost three of its last four
heading into this weekend's Aggie Shootout.
The Aggies are led by the play of Jessica Dunn

(21 goals), Carly Ternasky (19 goals) and goalie
Casey Hines (8.5 saves per game).
After Saturday's loss, Stanford is looking to re
gain momentum and improve on its problems.
"We did not have the same attitude against
USC that we had in our other games," said jun
ior Kate Baldoni.
The Cardinal will need that attitude on Satur
day, and again for its future matchups with
USC. Stanford will end its regular season with a
home match against USC on April 24.
Still, the women have now equaled their total
number of conference losses last season one
and intend to keep it that way.
"We got clobbered by USC, but then we clob
bered UCLA, so we felt like we at least ended
on a good note," said senior Jessica Steffens.
Steffens and her teammates hope to carry
some of that momentum into this weekend's
four-game set to get them back to their winning
ways before they tackle the MPSF Champi
onships in late April and early May.
"If anything, I think this loss [to USC] should
help us prepare for NCAAs and MPSFs," said
junior Kim Krueger. "We know what we need to
work on, and we will be able to carry this feeling
throughout the rest of the season as motivation."
The Cardinal looks to bounce back tomor
row against San Diego State. The match begins
at 4 p.m. at the Avery Aquatic Center.

BRITTANY VO/The Stanford Daily
The No. 2 Stanford women's water polo team won its first 12 games of the season fairly easily, which allowed the Cardinal to stay on top of the national rankings.
The Cardinal then ran into then-No. 2 USC, who defeated Stanford 10-6 in Irvine, Calif. The Cardinal looks to rebound from this loss this weekend.
