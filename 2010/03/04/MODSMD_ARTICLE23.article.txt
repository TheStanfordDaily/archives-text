# Amazingly, there's still hope

### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Last weekend's buzzer-beater
loss to Arizona was remark
ably devastating for the
Stanford men's basketball
team and its fans. For those
who weren't able to attend and
judging by attendance at Maples mere
ly 10 minutes before game time, this in
cludes a lot of you the brief summa
ry of the game is we let a 5-foot-10 faux
hawk record career-highs in points,
buzzer beaters and time feeling like a
man, as he banked home a running 15-
footer as time expired.
That isn't to say that the Cardinal
played no role in the loss. On the con
trary, key players couldn't convert free
throws in crunch time, again, and it cost
Stanford the game, again. This, coupled
with the faux hawk's ability to repeat
edly penetrate deep into the paint, ulti
mately led to heartbreak.
Oh, and an egregious no-call on the
game-clinching play didn't help either.
If you see Jack Trotter in the near fu
ture, make sure you're careful not to
touch his hand I'm sure it's still
throbbing.
But I digress. Saturday marks the
Big Game when Dawkins and Co. take
on regular season Pac-10 champion
Cal. The Cardinal will undoubtedly be
the underdog, and considering that the
Pac-10 will be ever so fortunate to even
be in the conversation of at-large bids
for the Big Dance, this game will seem
meaningless to most of you. It's under
standable it's hard to emphasize the
importance of a game in March for a
team that is 13-16, coming off a two-loss
weekend at home, currently sitting in
eighth in a conference of 10 and facing
an opponent that it lost to by 26 in the
first meeting.
But to hell with that, this is one of
the most important games of the year
for any Stanford sport.
With a win Saturday in the final
game of the regular season, Stanford
will avoid the play-in game for the Pac
-10 Tournament. (It should be noted
that the eighth and ninth seeds in the
conference usually square off in the
play-in game, but since USC's shenani
gans finally bit the Trojans in the ass,
they will be watching from home on a
flat screen most likely purchased by
DeMar De√üozan while he was in
school). If this happens, which is all but
certain, Stanford will then need to win
three consecutive games in order to
make it to the NCAA Tournament.
Three.
This isn't the Big East, nor is it the
Big 12. This is the Pac-10 in its worst
year of all time. Still, it's fair if you're
shaking your skeptical little head, mut
tering that there is no way that this
Stanford team, the same one that lost
four seniors and is coming off a loss in
the CBI to Oregon State just one year
ago, has no chance whatsoever of com
peting for a tourney bid. But it must be
understood just how awful the Card's
peers are, and just how possible a Pac
-10 Toumey victory is.
The No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in this
year's conference showdown? Cal and
Arizona State, respectively. Let's start
with the latter. Arizona State is current
ly 10-6 in conference, having lost to Ari
zona and UCLA (two teams that have
a combined record of (27-29). Its best
non-conference win was in the battle of
the party schools, when the Sun Devils
netted a victory against San Diego
State. Cal hasn't fared much better, los
ing to a dismal Oregon State team
among others while going 12-5 in con
ference. The Bears' best non-confer
ence win'.' Murray State.
I'm not making the case that Stan
ford leaves a lot to be desired, because
well, it does. But this team has been ex
tremely competitive with decent com
petition, including many teams that will
be dancing in a few weeks. It only seems
like yesterday that the Cardinal was
just a mere free throw away from up
setting Kentucky in Cancun.
The key to the Cardinal's success
this weekend as well as the Pac-10
Tournament is obviously Landry
Fields. We go as he goes, and it doesn't
take a bracketologist to figure out that
if he underperforms, we're royally
screwed. However, Stanford really, and
I mean really needs Jeremy Green to
play consistently good basketball. He
has the potential to be the best player
on the floor every time he is in the
game; it's just a matter of reaching that

potential. We've seen glimpses of his
brilliance, and if he can find his stroke
for just four games, Stanford is money.
The bottom line is to not abandon
this team. I don't care if you've been
called a fair weather fan for leaving
games early, or if the 35 dollars turned
you off from basketball this year. We
all forgive you. Please, for the love of
everything Cardinal, come to the
game Saturday. With enough luck and
support, Stanford could find itself
among the best in a matter of days. I
know it's a long shot, but these guys de
serve your fandom for just one month.
Still not sold? Stanford is only 10
games away from winning a national
title. Welcome to March.

Zach Zimmerman will wear a faux
hawk if Stanford wins the NCAA
Tournament this year. If that isn't
enough of a reason to root for Stan
ford, suggest better haircuts at
zachz @stanford. edu.
