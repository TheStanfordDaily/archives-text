## GSC considers free speech bills 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”Ellen Huet 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) took a
first look Wednesday at legislation concerning free
dom of speech and political expression authored by
ASSU Vice President Andy Parker 'll and ASSU
Undergraduate Senator Adam Creasman 'll.
The proposed constitutional amendment,
which addresses freedom of political association, is
still a work in progress.
"This is not a legally well-crafted document,
and we're seeking the advice of ACLU and other
professionals," Creasman said.
The amendment details how the University
shall not, "in word or deed, abridge the right of
members to freedoms of speech, press, expression,
or political advocacy which citizens of the United
States are granted by law."
ASSU President and coterminal student in
computer science David Gobaud also took time
during the meeting to outline and recap the State
of the Association speech given on Feb. 18.
The GSC then discussed joint special fees
groups and Senate-GSC funding.
ASSU Undergraduate Elections Commission
er Quinn Slack 'll also noted that Assistant Com
missioner for Graduate Elections and co-terminal
student in biology Ashwin Mudaliar stepped down
from his post, and that a replacement is needed.
The position's responsibilities include publicity for
events, advertising for the election and managing
graduate student turnout and polling stations.
The council also voted on funding requests for
Stanford Alpine Project, Stanford Students for
Life, French Stanford Student Association, Stan

ford Student Biodesign & Biopharma, Israeli Stu
dent Organization and the Jewish Graduate Stu
