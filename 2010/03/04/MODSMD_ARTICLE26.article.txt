## 
### â€”Elizabeth Titus DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Two days from the close of petitions, more
hopeful ASSU candidates and special fees
groups are nearer to or past the minimum signa
ture threshold.
On Wednesday, the Election Commission
said one executive slate, that of juniors Thorn
Scher and Stephanie Werner, had secured 200
valid signatures and would appear on the April
8 ballot.
Juany Torres was the first Undergraduate
Senate candidate to reach the ballot, also on
Wednesday.
The only special fees group to be validated
for the ballot so far is SPOON.
In other ASSU news, the Constitutional
Council last week ruled that votes former Sena
tor Daniel Limon '12 cast during winter quarter
were invalid, and said the Senate should recount
each of those votes. Limon took a personal
leave of absence fall quarter, and did not for
mally rejoin the Senate when he returned to
campus.
The group's major votes winter quarter re
lated to special fees funding policies, but the
canceling of Limon's votes does not appear to
have any signficant impact on those votes' out
comes.
