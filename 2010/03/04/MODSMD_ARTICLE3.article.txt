# Gaining Personal Perspective

### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
"Things aren't as new
anymore."

Junior year ages people. No more
or less time elapses than any
other year, but in their time as
juniors, undergraduates shift
their personal outlook when
they're on the second half of their
Stanford career. With two years at
Stanford under their belt, whether
students feel like they are "masters of
the game" as communication and in
ternational relations major Kenan
Jiang put it or they are still trying to
define their place on the Farm, some
where in the course of their third
year, juniors feel differently about
their younger selves.
And it is these shifts, in perspec
tive as much as in circumstance, that
structure the murky transition from
sophomore year.

Junior year focuses. For the stu
dent who's spent two years slacking
off, it's a time to relearn and reapply
the abilities that got them to the Farm
in the first place. For the hard worker,
it's a time to act on the projects and
accomplishments now within reach.
"Junior year is one of those years
you really have to start planning for
your future," said Eric Molina, a pre
med working in a neurology laborato
ry toward his honors thesis. "Setting
that up is pretty important to do."
"I don't know if it's motivation,
but it's this sense of what you ought
to be doing," said Max Friedmann, a
music and public policy major. "You
start to see a lot of people around you
doing interesting things."

Junior year poses questions. Not
only dialogues in classrooms and ex
istential quandaries, but the tough,
practical challenges of how to put a
life on a solid foundation.
"It's definitely been challenging," admitted
Jennifer Price, a Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity (CSRE) major. "It's hard to get
all the resources in order, professors in order,
advisers in order, hopeful employment in
order it's just been a roller-coaster. 'Well,
what will happen if that doesn't happen?'
'What will happen if that does happen?' It's a
lot of'what-ifs?' and questions that will hope
fully, eventually, get answered."
"I think in junior year you really wind up fo
cusing on your academics," Friedmann added.
"Everybody's abroad. It's just a big year of
limbo. I think it's really stressful. You've got all
these big steps around the corner."
Junior year categorizes, forcing people
for better and for worse into set paths and
defined fields. Deep interests and satisfying
work can result, as it did for Juan Acevedo, a
mechanical engineering major who focuses on
control design but even he notes the loss of
variety that comes with specialization.
"I've found a particular niche that I'm in,"
he said. "As opposed to freshman year, it
seems like everybody does everything and a
half... now that I've had to focus on a certain
thing, it definitely looks less diverse, al
most."
Junior year scatters friends. If classes don't
line up, meals aren't in the same hall and week
end homework starts Saturday morning in
stead of Sunday night, the times to meet and
converse, even with the closest of friends, can
become scarce.
"We have not seen each other for the last
three weeks, and we live two blocks from each
other," said junior class president Pamon
Forouhar of one of his best friends.
"I think what's been really tough is, a lot of
my really close friends are abroad," agreed
drama major Sarah Guerrero. "I was gone last
quarter, then I have some of my really close
friends abroad this quarter, some of them are
going abroad next quarter. I think the fact that
everyone's in different countries was the tough
bit of it."
"But surprisingly, of the friends that I have
on campus, it's been really easy to keep up with
them and to hang out with them," she added.

Junior year happens elsewhere. Whether liv
ing or working off-campus, taking a quarter in
the nation's capital or heading to an overseas
program in a whole new part of the world, many
students spend a significant portion of their jun
ior year at Stanford ... away from Stanford.
And new locales can lead to a new outlook.
"SIW, for me, was a really defining and focus
ing experience," said Sarah Flamm of her time at
Stanford in Washington, where she worked in
the Department of Justice. "It's not a function of
me being amazing or anything, I just got a great
situation."
For Forouhar, as well, time in Berlin made
for something new, which made coming back to
the Farm a jarring change.
"For the first time, I understood how it was
possible to live a life outside of school,"
Forouhar said of his time abroad.
"It's easy to get caught up in campus," he
added. "It wasn't so much of a culture shock
going abroad, as it was coming back."
For other students, junior year is a wake-up
call, a reminder that time in college is finite.
"I want to stay as long as I can," said math
major Ben Holtz. "I don't see why anyone
would ever want to leave this place."
"I think that there is a little bit of finality to
the college experience coming up," he added. "I
can sort of feel impending doom in the real
world."
Junior year can push people forward, even if
they're only partly on their way out.
"It's almost like you have a foot in both of the
doors," Molina said of the approaching jump
away from college to beyond.
Junior year opens perspectives. For many,
the uncertain contours of life beyond Stanford
become easier to grasp.
"You see everyone grow up a little bit," said
Keith Knapp. "People start changing. So you
start being able to more clearly see, as opposed
to freshman or sophomore year, what kind of
people you can be friends with after Stanford."
In the end, junior year eludes easy definition
like the juniors themselves. The ambiguous
space between the clear tasks of arriving and de
parting encourages the uncertainties of a third
year as much as it opens up unforeseen possibil
ities.
"Things aren't as new anymore," juniors say.
But they will only be older for a short time.

For many students, junior year is a time for students to go abroad and expand their cultural
and social spheres. In Oxford, one of the most popular abroad programs, students receive
individualized tutorials in a specific academic subject.
