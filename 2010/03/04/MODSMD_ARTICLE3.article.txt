# Gaining Personal Perspective
## 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
"Things aren't as new
anymore."

Junior year ages people. No more
or less time elapses than any
other year, but in their time as
juniors, undergraduates shift
their personal outlook when
they're on the second half of their
Stanford career. With two years at
Stanford under their belt, whether
students feel like they are "masters of
the game" as communication and in
ternational relations major Kenan
Jiang put it or they are still trying to
define their place on the Farm, some
where in the course of their third
year, juniors feel differently about
their younger selves.
And it is these shifts, in perspec
tive as much as in circumstance, that
structure the murky transition from
sophomore year.

Junior year focuses. For the stu
dent who's spent two years slacking
off, it's a time to relearn and reapply
the abilities that got them to the Farm
in the first place. For the hard worker,
it's a time to act on the projects and
accomplishments now within reach.
"Junior year is one of those years
you really have to start planning for
your future," said Eric Molina, a pre
med working in a neurology laborato
ry toward his honors thesis. "Setting
that up is pretty important to do."
"I don't know if it's motivation,
but it's this sense of what you ought
to be doing," said Max Friedmann, a
music and public policy major. "You
start to see a lot of people around you
doing interesting things."

Junior year poses questions. Not
only dialogues in classrooms and ex
istential quandaries, but the tough,
practical challenges of how to put a
life on a solid foundation.
