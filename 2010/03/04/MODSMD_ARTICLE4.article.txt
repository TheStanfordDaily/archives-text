## University examines expanding class size 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Over a three-year period, Stan
ford has quietly seen an almost five
percent increase in the number of
new students it enrolls each year
and the University appears ready to
stay the course for the near future.
This year's junior class is at the
front of a small, recent upward trend
in the number of new students Stan
ford enrolls each year, which will like
ly continue for at least another year,
but nonetheless appears not to have
had any significant impact on either
campus administration or the overall
size of the undergraduate population.
Beginning with the Class of 2011
and other new students who entered
Stanford in the fall of 2007, the num
ber of new degree-seeking students
per year has risen noticeably from
previous baseline levels. As measured
by the combination of incoming
freshmen and transfers, Stanford has
enrolled a greater number of new stu
dents in each of the last three years,
according to information contained
within the Common Data Set, a set of
statistics released by Stanford.
For incoming classes during the
three-year period of 2007 to 2009, an

average of 1,750 students per year en
rolled for the first time.
By comparison, for the three-year
period from 2004 to 2006, the average
was 1,674 students. From 2001 to
2003, the average was a still-lower
1,665.
This increase in new students is
not a targeted effort by the Universi
ty, but likely owes itself to a combina
tion of factors, including an increas
ing yield rate and the changing capac
ity of undergraduate housing, accord
ing to Provost John Etchemendy.
"Our standard practice is to admit
as many students as we have under
graduate dorm space for,"
Etchemendy wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "This is partly determined
by how many upperclass students
stop out or finish early, how many go
to an overseas campus and how many
we admit as transfers. [Residential &
Dining Enterprises] give Admissions
their estimate each spring, and admis
sions uses that number to determine
the incoming class size."
Nonetheless, the Office of Admis
sion's planned incoming class will not
significantly alter this trend.
Shawn Abbott, director of admis
sion, said in January that his office
will seek to enroll 1,675 freshmen,
and then add 20 transfer students,
for a total incoming cohort of 1,695.
This target is provisional and de
pends on the yield rate, but if the of
fice hits its desired target, the four
class years from 2007 to 2010 would
have enrolled, on average, 1,737 new
students per class year. For the peri
od from 2002 to 2006, the correspon
ding figure is 1,676 students per
class year, and each individual co
hort was lower than 1,695.
The increase in the baseline
number of students admitted by
more than 50 per class year, for a pe
riod of four years, has not posed any
significant challenge for the Univer
sity, according to administrators.
"Fluctuations of this magnitude
have minimal impact on University
classes or services," Etchemendy
said.
"The aggregate effect of any min
imal increases has not significantly
impacted our ability to provide qual-

ity services and programs to our undergraduate population," added
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman in an e-mail to
The Daily.
The administration has indicated that it will not increase incom
ing class sizes to a level that would significantly impact student qual
ity of life.
In January 2008, University President John Hennessy an-

nounced a task force to study the fea
sibility of "slightly increasing" the
size of incoming freshman classes,
and therefore increasing the total
size of the undergraduate popula
tion.
In February 2009, that effort was
put on hold due to the University's
severe budget challenges in the wake
of the economic recession.
According to the University
Communications Web site, "The
Common Data Set Initiative is a col-

laborative effort between publishers and the educational communi
ty to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to
all involved in a student's transition into higher education, as well as
to reduce the burden on colleges of compiling and reporting infor
mation."
