# Cardinal Care backlash
## International student community demands health insurance negotiations 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS MANAGING EDITOR 
provider.
Currently, seven percent of the
undergraduate population, or 488
students, are international. Thirty
two percent of graduate students,
2,734 students in total, are interna
tional.

The University's move last
month to require international stu
dents to purchase Stanford-pro
vided Cardinal Care for the 2010-
2011 school year has become a
lightning rod within the interna
tional student community, prompt
ing a student-led petition to kill the
new requirement, concerns among
foreign students of University dis
crimination and administrative
talks on whether to loosen require
ments of the plan.

Requiring Cardinal Care solely
for international students "is dis
criminatory because it assumes
that domestic students can better
evaluate whether their coverage is
adequate or not," said Fabian Sahl,
a graduate student in International
Policy Studies. Sahl has been at the
forefront of the opposition to the
mandatory coverage plan, co-au
thoring a petition that demands
that Stanford revoke the proposed
plan and keep the existing policy.
The petition had more than 500
signatures on Wednesday night.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden
Health Center and a major propo
nent of the Cardinal Care plan, has
seen first-hand what happens
when international students fall
through the coverage cracks.
"I see these folks drowning in
the river," Friedman said, "and I
think, 'Can't we put a fence up-

Under the revised policy, inter
national students will be obligated
to purchase Cardinal Care the
University's $3,000 annual health
care package —in 12-month in
crements. Currently, Stanford's in
surance policy has an "opt out"
mechanism that allows students to
forego Cardinal Care if they pro
vide proof that they have adequate
insurance coverage from another
source, such as parents, a spouse or
another insurance provider.
Domestic students remain free
to choose their own insurance

stream to keep them from falling
in?"'
Friedman said the issue of com
pulsory Cardinal Care for interna
tionals was recommended as far
back as 2008 in the Student Mental
Health and Well-being Task Force
Report. He backs the proposal be
cause he said it provides a safety
net that will eliminate medical sna
fus that have flared up several
times a quarter "problems that
occur almost exclusively for inter
national students."
Friedman said that about 80
percent of international students
already buy Cardinal Care, but the
20 percent who have other cover
age plans have run into problems
ranging from being denied in-pa-

tient treatment for mental health
conditions to having to relocate to
a county hospital when they have a
medical emergency.
But for Sahl, Friedman's well
meant fence curtails his personal
choice.
"This is a private institution,
and the move is paternalistic," Sahl
said. "We can very well decide for
ourselves if our coverage meets the
standard that Cardinal Care does."
Sunil Sandhu, a Ph.D. student in
electrical engineering and native
of Singapore, rejects the move on
principle, calling it "collective pun
ishment rather than corrective ac
tion." He is currently covered

(For the 2009-2010 graduate and undergraduate class)
488 of 6,878 undergraduate students (7%) are international
2,734 of 8,441 graduate students (32%) are international
80% of international students are on Cardinal Care
under Cardinal Care, but is consider
ing opting out.

"I think everyone should have
their own choices," Sandhu said, cit
ing his own personal care packages,
which he said are tailored to back in
juries he sustained in a recent fall.
Cardinal Care doesn't cover Sand
hu's specific physical therapy ex
penses, and his inability to tailor
make his care package is a problem.
"How much mental coverage do
you really need?" Sandhu asked.
"Vaden says you need X amount for
mental health and X amount for in
juries. How can they decide that? It
varies from person to person. It
makes no sense,"
In mid-February, after the pro
posed changes were announced,
concerned members of the interna
tional community wanted answers.
Adeline Agut, a graduate student in
civil and environmental engineering
and member of the French Student
Association, along with John Pear
son, director of Bechtel Internation

al Center, organized meetings with
Friedman to discuss steps to get the
administration to reconsider the
plan.

As an alternative, students asked
the University to lay out guidelines
for what is considered minimum ac
ceptable coverage and require stu
dents who wish to waive Cardinal
Care to provide written statements
of benefits from their alternate
provider.
"From what I've heard, Stanford
is pretty open to negotiations," Agut
said. "When they say they want the
best for us, I believe them. I don't
think they're evil."
In meetings with Friedman, stu
dents also asked that the University
extend the time frame for reviews of
the new plan in order to get more
student input.
But Sandhu questioned why stu
dents specifically graduates

were blindsided by the policy shift in
the first place and left having to
scramble for a last-minute response.
He blamed a lack of internal com
munication between the GSC and
the Vaden Insurance Advisory Com
mittee (VI AC).
"The GSC just let these guys [the
VIAC] go, and there was no coordi

nation," Sandhi said. "So if, from the
start, the VIAC heard that there was
this move to get mandatory Cardi
nal Care for international students,
they should have communicated
with the GSC and said that this is
going to happen. If they had, we
wouldn't have been in this mess."

Daniel Becker, an electrical engi
neering Ph.D. student from Ger
many, is currently on an insurance
plan offered by a private German
company targeted specifically to
ward extended stays abroad. Beck
er's insurance plan which costs
around $llO per month provides
worldwide coverage, includes den
tal, vision and prescription drugs,
and allows him to freely choose
which doctors to visit without the
need for a referral, he said. Cardinal
Care does not include dental or vi
sion coverage and provides limited
out-of-network coverage.

Becker is concerned with the
higher premiums he will have to pay
under Cardinal Care,

"My biggest concern with
mandatory enrollment in Cardinal
Care is the loss of coverage com
pared to my current plan," Becker
said. "Most importantly, Cardinal
Care only reimburses 80 percent of

the cost incurred at out-of-network
providers. Given that serious in
juries or illnesses can easily lead to
immense health care bills, this puts
me at a significant financial risk any
time I travel, be it for attending a
conference or for visiting my family
back home."

Sahl is currently insured under a
German plan that cooperates with
the Swiss provider Elvia in the Unit
ed States. He said that the cost of his
insurance policy is roughly $2,000
dollars cheaper a year than Cardinal
Care.

Friedman acknowledged that
some students, such as Becker and
Sahl, are savvy healthcare pur
chasers and have chosen cost-effec
tive alternatives. For students like
those, Friedman is negotiating a
"feasible process for exceptions."
"We're listening very carefully to
student feedback on this," Friedman
said. "The policy is aimed at trying to
address a problem that is occurring
only exclusively in one quarter of the
student population. From a public
health viewpoint, we can and should
try to address it."

a graduate student in International
Policy Studies. Sahl has been at the

that Stanford revoke the proposed
plan and keep the existing policy.
The petition had more than 500
signatures on Wednesday night.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden

Under the revised policy, inter

another insurance provider.

Friedman said the issue of com
pulsory Cardinal Care for interna
tionals was recommended as far
back as 2008 in the Student Mental
Health and Well-being Task Force
Report. He backs the proposal be
cause he said it provides a safety
net that will eliminate medical sna
fus that have flared up several
times a quarter "problems that
occur almost exclusively for inter
national students."
Friedman said that about 80
percent of international students
already buy Cardinal Care, but the
20 percent who have other cover
age plans have run into problems
ranging from being denied in-pa-

conditions to having to relocate to
a county hospital when they have a

But for Sahl, Friedman's well
meant fence curtails his personal
choice.
"This is a private institution,
and the move is paternalistic," Sahl
said. "We can very well decide for
ourselves if our coverage meets the
standard that Cardinal Care does."
Sunil Sandhu, a Ph.D. student in
electrical engineering and native
of Singapore, rejects the move on
principle, calling it "collective pun
ishment rather than corrective ac
tion." He is currently covered

80% of international students are on Cardinal Care
under Cardinal Care, but is consider

"I think everyone should have
their own choices," Sandhu said, cit
ing his own personal care packages,
which he said are tailored to back in
juries he sustained in a recent fall.
Cardinal Care doesn't cover Sand
hu's specific physical therapy ex
penses, and his inability to tailor
make his care package is a problem.
"How much mental coverage do
you really need?" Sandhu asked.
"Vaden says you need X amount for
mental health and X amount for in
juries. How can they decide that? It
varies from person to person. It
makes no sense,"
In mid-February, after the pro
posed changes were announced,
concerned members of the interna
tional community wanted answers.
Adeline Agut, a graduate student in
civil and environmental engineering
and member of the French Student
Association, along with John Pear
son, director of Bechtel Internation

al Center, organized meetings with
Friedman to discuss steps to get the
administration to reconsider the
plan.

As an alternative, students asked
the University to lay out guidelines
for what is considered minimum ac
ceptable coverage and require stu
dents who wish to waive Cardinal
Care to provide written statements
of benefits from their alternate
provider.
"From what I've heard, Stanford
is pretty open to negotiations," Agut
said. "When they say they want the
best for us, I believe them. I don't
think they're evil."
In meetings with Friedman, stu
dents also asked that the University
extend the time frame for reviews of
the new plan in order to get more
student input.
But Sandhu questioned why stu
dents specifically graduates

were blindsided by the policy shift in
the first place and left having to
scramble for a last-minute response.
He blamed a lack of internal com
munication between the GSC and
the Vaden Insurance Advisory Com
mittee (VI AC).
"The GSC just let these guys [the
VIAC] go, and there was no coordi

nation," Sandhi said. "So if, from the
start, the VIAC heard that there was
this move to get mandatory Cardi
nal Care for international students,
they should have communicated
with the GSC and said that this is
going to happen. If they had, we
wouldn't have been in this mess."

Daniel Becker, an electrical engi
neering Ph.D. student from Ger
many, is currently on an insurance
plan offered by a private German
company targeted specifically to
ward extended stays abroad. Beck
er's insurance plan which costs
around $llO per month provides
worldwide coverage, includes den
tal, vision and prescription drugs,
and allows him to freely choose
which doctors to visit without the
need for a referral, he said. Cardinal
Care does not include dental or vi
sion coverage and provides limited
out-of-network coverage.

Becker is concerned with the
higher premiums he will have to pay
under Cardinal Care,

"My biggest concern with
mandatory enrollment in Cardinal
Care is the loss of coverage com
pared to my current plan," Becker
said. "Most importantly, Cardinal
Care only reimburses 80 percent of

the cost incurred at out-of-network
providers. Given that serious in
juries or illnesses can easily lead to
immense health care bills, this puts
me at a significant financial risk any
time I travel, be it for attending a
conference or for visiting my family
back home."

Sahl is currently insured under a
German plan that cooperates with
the Swiss provider Elvia in the Unit
ed States. He said that the cost of his
insurance policy is roughly $2,000
dollars cheaper a year than Cardinal
Care.

Friedman acknowledged that
some students, such as Becker and
Sahl, are savvy healthcare pur
chasers and have chosen cost-effec
tive alternatives. For students like
those, Friedman is negotiating a
"feasible process for exceptions."
"We're listening very carefully to
student feedback on this," Friedman
said. "The policy is aimed at trying to
address a problem that is occurring
only exclusively in one quarter of the
student population. From a public
health viewpoint, we can and should
try to address it."

Currently, seven percent of the
undergraduate population, or 488
students, are international. Thirty
two percent of graduate students,
2,734 students in total, are interna
tional.

The University's move last
month to require international stu
dents to purchase Stanford-pro
vided Cardinal Care for the 2010-
2011 school year has become a
lightning rod within the interna

ing a student-led petition to kill the
new requirement, concerns among
foreign students of University dis

talks on whether to loosen require

Requiring Cardinal Care solely
for international students "is dis
