Currently, seven percent of the
undergraduate population, or 488
students, are international. Thirty
two percent of graduate students,
2,734 students in total, are interna
tional.

The University's move last
month to require international stu
dents to purchase Stanford-pro
vided Cardinal Care for the 2010-
2011 school year has become a
lightning rod within the interna
tional student community, prompt
ing a student-led petition to kill the
new requirement, concerns among
foreign students of University dis
crimination and administrative
talks on whether to loosen require
ments of the plan.

Requiring Cardinal Care solely
for international students "is dis
criminatory because it assumes
that domestic students can better
evaluate whether their coverage is
adequate or not," said Fabian Sahl,
a graduate student in International
Policy Studies. Sahl has been at the
forefront of the opposition to the
mandatory coverage plan, co-au
thoring a petition that demands
that Stanford revoke the proposed
plan and keep the existing policy.
The petition had more than 500
signatures on Wednesday night.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden
Health Center and a major propo
nent of the Cardinal Care plan, has
seen first-hand what happens
when international students fall
through the coverage cracks.
"I see these folks drowning in
the river," Friedman said, "and I
think, 'Can't we put a fence up-

Under the revised policy, inter
national students will be obligated
to purchase Cardinal Care the
University's $3,000 annual health
care package â€”in 12-month in
crements. Currently, Stanford's in
surance policy has an "opt out"
mechanism that allows students to
forego Cardinal Care if they pro
vide proof that they have adequate
insurance coverage from another
source, such as parents, a spouse or
another insurance provider.
Domestic students remain free
to choose their own insurance

stream to keep them from falling
in?"'
Friedman said the issue of com
pulsory Cardinal Care for interna
tionals was recommended as far
back as 2008 in the Student Mental
Health and Well-being Task Force
Report. He backs the proposal be
cause he said it provides a safety
net that will eliminate medical sna
fus that have flared up several
times a quarter "problems that
occur almost exclusively for inter
national students."
Friedman said that about 80
percent of international students
already buy Cardinal Care, but the
20 percent who have other cover
age plans have run into problems
ranging from being denied in-pa-

tient treatment for mental health
conditions to having to relocate to
a county hospital when they have a
medical emergency.
But for Sahl, Friedman's well
meant fence curtails his personal
choice.
"This is a private institution,
and the move is paternalistic," Sahl
said. "We can very well decide for
ourselves if our coverage meets the
standard that Cardinal Care does."
Sunil Sandhu, a Ph.D. student in
electrical engineering and native
of Singapore, rejects the move on
principle, calling it "collective pun
ishment rather than corrective ac
tion." He is currently covered
