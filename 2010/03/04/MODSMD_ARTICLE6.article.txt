When Jaehyun Park 'l2 glanced up at
the scoreboard after the first two hours at
the ACM International Collegiate Pro
gramming Contest (ACM-ICPC) World
Finals in Harbin, China last month, he was
elated. Scrambling to solve rigorous com
puter science problems involving "theoret
ical and mathematical thinking," Park and
two other Stanford students saw that they
were in first place.
Stanford's lead didn't last for long, how
ever.
By the end of the competition one of
the most prestigious in the field of comput
er science the team had slipped to 14th
place. Shanghai Jiaotong University even
tually claimed the top spot, completing all
11 problems with a "very fast and precise"
pace that Park called "just amazing."
Other than that. Park knew little about
the victors.
"I knew that they won the competition
twice during last 10 years, but nothing
more than that," he said.
Less than three weeks after the contest,
Jiaotong University was back in the head
lines for its computer prowess, but instead
of being lauded, the school found itself in
the center of a global hacking investiga
tion. Computer science experts and Na
tional Security Agency investigators look
ing to find the source of a hacking scheme
dubbed "Operation Aurora" which
targeted large companies such as Google,
Adobe and Yahoo! this year, suggested
that the Shanghai school had been a home
base for the coordinated online attack.
In the attack, unidentified hackers stole
private data and accessed information in
personal e-mail accounts, one of which be
longed to Stanford student Tenzin Seldon
'l2. Google later threatened to pull opera
tions out of China, but has since acqui
esced and is currently in talks with the Chi
nese government regarding continued op
erations in the country.
Investigators allege that, based on evi-
