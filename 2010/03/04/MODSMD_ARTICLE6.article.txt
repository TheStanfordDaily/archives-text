## Internet abuse stems from school in China Jiaotong University linked to hacking of Google, Yahoo! 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
When Jaehyun Park 'l2 glanced up at
the scoreboard after the first two hours at
the ACM International Collegiate Pro
gramming Contest (ACM-ICPC) World
Finals in Harbin, China last month, he was
elated. Scrambling to solve rigorous com
puter science problems involving "theoret
ical and mathematical thinking," Park and
two other Stanford students saw that they
were in first place.
Stanford's lead didn't last for long, how
ever.
By the end of the competition one of
the most prestigious in the field of comput
er science the team had slipped to 14th
place. Shanghai Jiaotong University even
tually claimed the top spot, completing all
11 problems with a "very fast and precise"
pace that Park called "just amazing."
Other than that. Park knew little about
the victors.
"I knew that they won the competition
twice during last 10 years, but nothing
more than that," he said.
Less than three weeks after the contest,
Jiaotong University was back in the head
lines for its computer prowess, but instead
of being lauded, the school found itself in
the center of a global hacking investiga
tion. Computer science experts and Na
tional Security Agency investigators look
ing to find the source of a hacking scheme
dubbed "Operation Aurora" which
targeted large companies such as Google,
Adobe and Yahoo! this year, suggested
that the Shanghai school had been a home
base for the coordinated online attack.
In the attack, unidentified hackers stole
private data and accessed information in
personal e-mail accounts, one of which be
longed to Stanford student Tenzin Seldon
'l2. Google later threatened to pull opera
tions out of China, but has since acqui
esced and is currently in talks with the Chi
nese government regarding continued op
erations in the country.
Investigators allege that, based on evi-
dence, Jiaotong and Lanxiang Voca
tional School in China's Shandong
Province were involved with Opera
tion Aurora.
For a university of Jiaotong's
stature, such allegations are especial
ly troubling and could have an imme
diate effect on the school's reputa
tion. Duncan Clark, a visiting scholar
with the Freeman Spogli Institute
(FSI) and an expert on Chinese Inter
net policies, said that Jiaotong, which
has 33,000 students, is considered by
some the Chinese equivalent of an
American Ivy League university.
Yet Clark was hesitant to com
pletely blame the university or the
Chinese government for the hacking
scheme.
"Nobody knows what's going on
and some people in the government
don't even know what the heck is
going on," he said. "There's a lot of
bandwidth and computing power, but
it's not necessarily well-administered
[in China]."
Calling the investigation into Op
eration Aurora an "evolving situa
tion," Clark, however, did not rule out
the possibility of government in
volvement or the idea that the Chi

nese administration knew about the
attack and simply "turned a blind
eye." He also suggested that highly
organized students might have per
formed the attacks for the sake of
"sport."
"In the West we tend to perceive
China as a highly disciplined, top
down society," Clark said of organ
ized hackers working independently
of the government. "But we realized
that it's quite the opposite and rules
are often broken."
He went on to detail how, in anoth
er possible scenario, hackers outside
the country might have employed
false signs to try to frame the univer
sities for the attacks.
The Chinese schools involved
have already denied allegations, with
The New York Times reporting that a
Jiaotong spokesperson was "shocked
and indignant" about the accusations.
An anonymous professor from Jiao
tong's School of Information Security
Engineering was quoted in the same
story saying, "I'm not surprised. Actu
ally, students hacking into foreign
Web sites is quite normal."
The Chinese government is no
stranger to obtaining private infor
mation from corporations. In a highly
publicized case in 2005, Chinese jour
nalist Shi Tao was jailed after it was
revealed that he had a sent a govern
ment document through his personal
Yahoo! e-mail account.

For Clark, despite all the possibili
ties, the nature of the cyber attack
"points to a political element," which
might suggest a growing hard-line ap
proach to administration policies.The
scholar said that with current eco
nomic concerns and worries of out
side influence on development, un
compromising factions at the top
level of the Chinese communist party
have been gaining strength.
With changes in positions occur
ring in the party in 2012, Clark said,
this new faction may be taking a no
nonsense approach to dealing with
outside corporations, possibly exem
plified by the cyber attack. He went
on to call the current faction running
the government "xenophobic" and
"paranoid."
Yet in a country fast approaching
400 million Internet users, China's
move toward heavy Web regulation
and monitoring may not be a straight
forward trend. Clark stated that there
were many factions in the govern
ment that may be able to shift the di
rection of the government, a senti
ment echoed by FSI scholar and soci
ology Prof. Xueguang Zhou.
"China is undergoing drastic
transformation in a very short period
of time," Zhou wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "In this process, the Chi
nese government is not monolithic;
rather, the government is fragmented
and faces diverse forces pushing and
pulling in different directions. It is
useful to understand the Chinese
government, its policies and behav
iors, in light of these dynamics."
