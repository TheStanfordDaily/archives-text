## Six slates race for ASSU Executive Petitions phase has six slates aiming for 200 signatures by Friday to run 
### MARISA LANDICHO PHILLIP KLIMKE 
With two late entrants to the ASSU executive
race Wednesday afternoon, a total of six slates
have officially announced their bids for the top
two spots in Stanford student government.
Now, what started out as a one slate race last
week has emerged as a free-for-all after several
slates tossed in their hats in just a few days' time.
To keep their executive hopes afloat, each slate
now has little more than 24 hours to present 200
student signatures to the Elections Commission.
For the first round of the election process, inter
ested candidates must gather signatures from the
students via the ASSU petitions Web site or Elec
tions Commission-approved paper forms. The pe
tition period opened at noon on Feb. 12 and will
close at 4 p.m. on Friday.

After petitions are verified, the Elections Com
mission will on March 9 release the list of candi
dates eligible to continue on to the April cam
paign.

As of press time, only one slate —juniors
Thom Scher and Stephanie Werner had passed
the 200-signature threshold, according to ASSU
Assistant Elections Commissioner for Under
graduate Elections Cotis Mitchell 'l2. The Elec

tions Commission validated the Scher-Werner pe
tition Wednesday evening.
Wanted: YP Candidate
While Scher and Werner announced their
hopeful candidacy early, Scher's road to a running
mate was, he said, a two-month process.
Scher, who could have graduated early this
year, decided to stay another year in order to run
for ASSU office. He first began considering a run
for executive, and potential running mates, in De
cember.
Initially, Scher discussed a possible run for ex
ecutive with a pool of ASSU veterans, including
former chairs of the Undergraduate Senate Tiq
Chapa 'lO and Shelley Gao 'll and current chair
Varun Sivaram 'll. Scher asked Gao to be his po
tential running mate, saying he "would have prob
ably run with her had she said yes."
But Gao declined briefly appearing on a dif
ferent slate with Danny Crichton 'll, also The
Daily's former columns editor and Scher
paired up with long-time friend Werner.
At Stanford, Scher and Werner have worked
together as executive director and director of de
velopment, respectively, of Stanford's Charity
Fashion Show. Their friendship, however, dates
back to four years ago, when they met during the
Stanford High School Summer College Program.
Both said their slate formed naturally: "We did-
n't have to sync our calendars because
we are already synced," Scher said.
Last year, Scher intended to run
for Undergraduate Senate with the
Students for a Better Stanford coali
tion, but eventually decided to accept
a job with Student Activities and
Leadership instead, which he said
lent him experience with University
administration.
Werner has worked for The Daily
and the CoHo.
Will They? Won't They?
Only close observers of the peti
tions process were able to catch a
glimpse of the short-lived candidacy
of Crichton and Gao for the execu
tive jobs.Their petition appeared late
last Monday, but was taken down just
two days later.
Gao is serving her second term in
the Undergraduate Senate, and is
also a Daily columnist.
After initially considering a run,
Gao said she came to the conclusion
that she did not want to commit to an
executive post, and will instead pur
sue other avenues to serve the Stan
ford community. Late Wednesday,
Gao had not opened a petition for a
Senate candidacy while Crichton
joined the race as a Senate candidate
after resigning from The Daily.
The Chappie Returns
Under the slate billed "Two Dope
Boys in a Caddylack," Billy Kemper
'll and Josh Meisel 'l2 joined the ex
ecutive race early. One in a long line
of The Stanford Chaparral-affiliated
executive bids, the duo affirmed their
determination for the job.
Kemper and Meisel believe they
have the skills to direct the ASSU,
Kemper boasting his student govern
ment experience —he was sopho
more class treasurer in high school
and Meisel citing involvement with
nearly every campus student group,
all of which he signed up for at the ac
tivities fair.
The two pledge to stick out their
entire term if elected, even through
Meisel's injuries.
Kemper and Meisel had 188 sig
natures at press time.
Groundbreaking Grads
Last Sunday, ASSU veterans
Ryan Peacock and Jonathan Bakke,
both doctoral students in chemical
engineering, began their petition
drive.The pair first met during the re
cruiting weekend for the chemical
engineering graduate program in
2006.
Until Angelina Cardona 'll and
Kelsei Wharton 'l2 announced their
candidacy Wednesday afternoon,
Peacock, a Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) member, and Bakke, who
chairs the Nominations Commission,
were the only candidates with major
ASSU experience.
Now in his second GSC term, Pea

cock serves as the group's financial
officer; Bakke served two years on
the University's Committee of Re
search.
Notably, Peacock and Bakke are
the only doctoral students to run for
ASSU Executive in the last decade,
according to past election records.
Since 1999, only two non-under
graduate students have served as ex
ecutives: graduate student in genetics
John Mills was vice president in 1999,
and coterminal student in computer
science David Gobaud is the current
president.
Undergraduate students histori
cally make up a larger number of the
total voters, which may hurt the Pea
cock-Bakke slate in the general elec
tion in April, where slates must win
by a majority. Last year, 3,351 under
graduates and 1,783 graduates voted
in the election.
Bakke said he hopes that students
evaluate the slate on their platform
rather than their graduation year. At
press time, the two had collected 177
signatures.
"I would hope that everybody can
take an unbiased look at the candi
dates," Bakke said.
'Criminalizing Dark Skies'
Also entering the race Sunday, the
"No Rain Campaign!" slate of jun
iors Katherine Heflin and Daniel
Leifer burst onto the scene with a
You Tube campaign video. True to
their slate name, Heflin and Leifer
proposed solutions to what they call
one of Stanford's most pressing is
sues: precipitation.
But the pair refutes suggestions
that their slate is a joke.
"The ASSU race begins to be
come a lot about broken promises,"
Leifer said. "So long as someone is
running, why not promise that it's not
going to rain next year?"
Leifer cited experience as serving
on the Vaden Advisory Board,
among his campus activities.
To fill out their petition form, the
slate initially flipped a coin to decide
who would be president.
So far in the petitions phase, the
two have been victims of technical

difficulties. At one point, the slate lost
between seven and 80 signatures due
to an incorrect petitions Web site
URL. The votes were recovered yes
terday, and the two have 177 total sig
natures.
Call to Service
Cardona and Wharton entered
the race Wednesday afternoon. Car
dona said she decided to run last Fri
day, while Wharton made his deci
sion late Tuesday.
Cardona, a freshman resident as
sistant in Trancos, has been involved
in campus politics since her freshman
year, when she served as Branner
dorm president. She worked for the
successful executive campaign of
Jonny Dorsey 'O9 and Fagan Harris
'O9, going on to serve as their mental
health co-chair. She was involved in
founding the Wellness Room.
It was Dorsey and Harris who
kept calling Cardona as she weighed
her decision last week, ultimately
convincing her to run.
"They were the ones calling me
late Thursday night," she said. "They
were a big push in the right direction,
I would say."
As soon as she decided to run,
Cardona immediately knew that
Wharton the current deputy Sen
ate chair, who she knows through
Foundation for Education, an after
school math program would be an
appealing choice for vice president.
Cardona said she liked Wharton's
record as a campus leader.
The two are the only undergradu
ates candidates with major ASSU ex
perience, Their petition open just
seven hours, the two had already
gathered 190 signatures on Wednes
day night.
Down to the Wire
Austin Guzman 'll and Patrick
Mahoney 'll, who opened their peti
tion late Wednesday afternoon, have
the largest gap to fill by Friday after
noon. Guzman and Mahoney, under
the slate name "The Guzman-Ma
honey Referendum Demanding Ac
tion," still needed 184 signatures at
press time.
In light of the resignation of for
mer ASSU vice president Jay de la
Torre 'll in November, all candi
dates, save Guzman and Mahoney,
said they would be able to serve out
their entire term if elected.
Guzman and Mahoney did not re
turn requests for comment on
Wednesday.
Thus far, only Kemper and Meisel
have committed to using the ASSU
public financing plan. Heflin and
Leifer said they would spend no
money on their campaign, while the
other slates have not yet decided.
In total, 4,766 undergraduates, 436
coterms and 256 graduate students
have signed petitions for candidates,
slates and special fee requests.

While Scher and Werner announced their
hopeful candidacy early, Scher's road to a running

But Gao declined briefly appearing on a dif

paired up with long-time friend Werner.
At Stanford, Scher and Werner have worked

back to four years ago, when they met during the

Will They? Won't They?
Only close observers of the peti
tions process were able to catch a
glimpse of the short-lived candidacy
of Crichton and Gao for the execu
tive jobs.Their petition appeared late
last Monday, but was taken down just
two days later.
Gao is serving her second term in
the Undergraduate Senate, and is
also a Daily columnist.
After initially considering a run,
Gao said she came to the conclusion
that she did not want to commit to an
executive post, and will instead pur
sue other avenues to serve the Stan
ford community. Late Wednesday,
Gao had not opened a petition for a
Senate candidacy while Crichton
joined the race as a Senate candidate
after resigning from The Daily.
The Chappie Returns
Under the slate billed "Two Dope
Boys in a Caddylack," Billy Kemper
'll and Josh Meisel 'l2 joined the ex
ecutive race early. One in a long line
of The Stanford Chaparral-affiliated
executive bids, the duo affirmed their
determination for the job.
Kemper and Meisel believe they
have the skills to direct the ASSU,
Kemper boasting his student govern
ment experience —he was sopho
more class treasurer in high school
and Meisel citing involvement with
nearly every campus student group,
all of which he signed up for at the ac
tivities fair.
The two pledge to stick out their
entire term if elected, even through
Meisel's injuries.
Kemper and Meisel had 188 sig
natures at press time.
Groundbreaking Grads
Last Sunday, ASSU veterans
Ryan Peacock and Jonathan Bakke,
both doctoral students in chemical
engineering, began their petition
drive.The pair first met during the re
cruiting weekend for the chemical
engineering graduate program in
2006.
Until Angelina Cardona 'll and
Kelsei Wharton 'l2 announced their
candidacy Wednesday afternoon,
Peacock, a Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) member, and Bakke, who
chairs the Nominations Commission,
were the only candidates with major
ASSU experience.
Now in his second GSC term, Pea

cock serves as the group's financial
officer; Bakke served two years on
the University's Committee of Re
search.
Notably, Peacock and Bakke are
the only doctoral students to run for
ASSU Executive in the last decade,
according to past election records.
Since 1999, only two non-under
graduate students have served as ex
ecutives: graduate student in genetics
John Mills was vice president in 1999,
and coterminal student in computer
science David Gobaud is the current
president.
Undergraduate students histori
cally make up a larger number of the
total voters, which may hurt the Pea
cock-Bakke slate in the general elec
tion in April, where slates must win
by a majority. Last year, 3,351 under
graduates and 1,783 graduates voted
in the election.
Bakke said he hopes that students
evaluate the slate on their platform
rather than their graduation year. At
press time, the two had collected 177
signatures.
"I would hope that everybody can
take an unbiased look at the candi
dates," Bakke said.
'Criminalizing Dark Skies'
Also entering the race Sunday, the
"No Rain Campaign!" slate of jun
iors Katherine Heflin and Daniel
Leifer burst onto the scene with a
You Tube campaign video. True to
their slate name, Heflin and Leifer
proposed solutions to what they call
one of Stanford's most pressing is
sues: precipitation.
But the pair refutes suggestions
that their slate is a joke.
"The ASSU race begins to be
come a lot about broken promises,"
Leifer said. "So long as someone is
running, why not promise that it's not
going to rain next year?"
Leifer cited experience as serving
on the Vaden Advisory Board,
among his campus activities.
To fill out their petition form, the
slate initially flipped a coin to decide
who would be president.
So far in the petitions phase, the
two have been victims of technical

difficulties. At one point, the slate lost
between seven and 80 signatures due
to an incorrect petitions Web site
URL. The votes were recovered yes
terday, and the two have 177 total sig
natures.
Call to Service
Cardona and Wharton entered
the race Wednesday afternoon. Car
dona said she decided to run last Fri
day, while Wharton made his deci
sion late Tuesday.
Cardona, a freshman resident as
sistant in Trancos, has been involved
in campus politics since her freshman
year, when she served as Branner
dorm president. She worked for the
successful executive campaign of
Jonny Dorsey 'O9 and Fagan Harris
'O9, going on to serve as their mental
health co-chair. She was involved in
founding the Wellness Room.
It was Dorsey and Harris who
kept calling Cardona as she weighed
her decision last week, ultimately
convincing her to run.
"They were the ones calling me
late Thursday night," she said. "They
were a big push in the right direction,
I would say."
As soon as she decided to run,
Cardona immediately knew that
Wharton the current deputy Sen
ate chair, who she knows through
Foundation for Education, an after
school math program would be an
appealing choice for vice president.
Cardona said she liked Wharton's
record as a campus leader.
The two are the only undergradu
ates candidates with major ASSU ex
perience, Their petition open just
seven hours, the two had already
gathered 190 signatures on Wednes
day night.
Down to the Wire
Austin Guzman 'll and Patrick
Mahoney 'll, who opened their peti
tion late Wednesday afternoon, have
the largest gap to fill by Friday after
noon. Guzman and Mahoney, under
the slate name "The Guzman-Ma
honey Referendum Demanding Ac
tion," still needed 184 signatures at
press time.
In light of the resignation of for
mer ASSU vice president Jay de la
Torre 'll in November, all candi
dates, save Guzman and Mahoney,
said they would be able to serve out
their entire term if elected.
Guzman and Mahoney did not re
turn requests for comment on
Wednesday.
Thus far, only Kemper and Meisel
have committed to using the ASSU
public financing plan. Heflin and
Leifer said they would spend no
money on their campaign, while the
other slates have not yet decided.
In total, 4,766 undergraduates, 436
coterms and 256 graduate students
have signed petitions for candidates,
slates and special fee requests.

HARRISON TRUONG/The Stanford Daily
With two late entrants to the ASSU executive
race Wednesday afternoon, a total of six slates
have officially announced their bids for the top
two spots in Stanford student government.
Now, what started out as a one slate race last
week has emerged as a free-for-all after several
slates tossed in their hats in just a few days' time.
To keep their executive hopes afloat, each slate
now has little more than 24 hours to present 200
student signatures to the Elections Commission.
For the first round of the election process, inter
ested candidates must gather signatures from the
students via the ASSU petitions Web site or Elec
tions Commission-approved paper forms. The pe
tition period opened at noon on Feb. 12 and will
close at 4 p.m. on Friday.

After petitions are verified, the Elections Com
mission will on March 9 release the list of candi
dates eligible to continue on to the April cam
paign.

As of press time, only one slate —juniors
Thom Scher and Stephanie Werner had passed
the 200-signature threshold, according to ASSU
Assistant Elections Commissioner for Under
graduate Elections Cotis Mitchell 'l2. The Elec

tions Commission validated the Scher-Werner pe
tition Wednesday evening.
Wanted: YP Candidate
While Scher and Werner announced their
hopeful candidacy early, Scher's road to a running
mate was, he said, a two-month process.
Scher, who could have graduated early this
year, decided to stay another year in order to run
for ASSU office. He first began considering a run
for executive, and potential running mates, in De
cember.
Initially, Scher discussed a possible run for ex
ecutive with a pool of ASSU veterans, including
former chairs of the Undergraduate Senate Tiq
Chapa 'lO and Shelley Gao 'll and current chair
Varun Sivaram 'll. Scher asked Gao to be his po
tential running mate, saying he "would have prob
ably run with her had she said yes."
But Gao declined briefly appearing on a dif
ferent slate with Danny Crichton 'll, also The
Daily's former columns editor and Scher
paired up with long-time friend Werner.
At Stanford, Scher and Werner have worked
together as executive director and director of de
velopment, respectively, of Stanford's Charity
Fashion Show. Their friendship, however, dates
back to four years ago, when they met during the
Stanford High School Summer College Program.
Both said their slate formed naturally: "We did-
n't have to sync our calendars because
we are already synced," Scher said.
Last year, Scher intended to run
for Undergraduate Senate with the
Students for a Better Stanford coali
tion, but eventually decided to accept
a job with Student Activities and
Leadership instead, which he said
lent him experience with University
administration.
Werner has worked for The Daily
