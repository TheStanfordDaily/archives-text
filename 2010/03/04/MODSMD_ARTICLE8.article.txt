## Six slates race for ASSU Executive Petitions phase has six slates aiming for 200 signatures by Friday to run 
### MARISA LANDICHO PHILLIP KLIMKE 
With two late entrants to the ASSU executive
race Wednesday afternoon, a total of six slates
have officially announced their bids for the top
two spots in Stanford student government.
Now, what started out as a one slate race last
week has emerged as a free-for-all after several
slates tossed in their hats in just a few days' time.
To keep their executive hopes afloat, each slate
now has little more than 24 hours to present 200
student signatures to the Elections Commission.
For the first round of the election process, inter
ested candidates must gather signatures from the
students via the ASSU petitions Web site or Elec
tions Commission-approved paper forms. The pe
tition period opened at noon on Feb. 12 and will
close at 4 p.m. on Friday.

After petitions are verified, the Elections Com
mission will on March 9 release the list of candi
dates eligible to continue on to the April cam
paign.

As of press time, only one slate â€”juniors
Thom Scher and Stephanie Werner had passed
the 200-signature threshold, according to ASSU
Assistant Elections Commissioner for Under
graduate Elections Cotis Mitchell 'l2. The Elec

tions Commission validated the Scher-Werner pe
tition Wednesday evening.

While Scher and Werner announced their
hopeful candidacy early, Scher's road to a running
mate was, he said, a two-month process.
Scher, who could have graduated early this
year, decided to stay another year in order to run
for ASSU office. He first began considering a run
for executive, and potential running mates, in De
cember.
Initially, Scher discussed a possible run for ex
ecutive with a pool of ASSU veterans, including
former chairs of the Undergraduate Senate Tiq
Chapa 'lO and Shelley Gao 'll and current chair
Varun Sivaram 'll. Scher asked Gao to be his po
tential running mate, saying he "would have prob
ably run with her had she said yes."
But Gao declined briefly appearing on a dif
ferent slate with Danny Crichton 'll, also The
Daily's former columns editor and Scher
paired up with long-time friend Werner.
At Stanford, Scher and Werner have worked
together as executive director and director of de
velopment, respectively, of Stanford's Charity
Fashion Show. Their friendship, however, dates
back to four years ago, when they met during the
Stanford High School Summer College Program.
Both said their slate formed naturally: "We did-
