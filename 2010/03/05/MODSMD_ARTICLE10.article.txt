## Journalist Steve Coll discusses Pakistan 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
For journalist Steve Coll, under
standing "managed jihad" is vital to
making sense of Pakistan's role in
the United States' war in
Afghanistan.
Coll lectured for an hour Thurs
day on "the globalization of terror"
at Encina Flail, focusing especially
on Pakistan's role in and perspec
tive on South Asian security.
The Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies presented Coll
as the 2010 Payne Distinguished
Lecturer. He has spent 20 years as a
foreign correspondent, with his first
news story on Al-Qaeda in 1993, and
served as the managing editor of the
Washington Post from 1998 to 2004.
Coll argued that the Pakistani
army's institutional memory of the
cost-effectiveness of mujahedeen
fighters, dating back to their employ
ment against the Soviets in the late
1980's, has made them a vital part of
Pakistani strategy, not easily re

moved even under American pres
sure.
The Pakistani army's tolerance
for militant groups, Coll argued,
emerged less out of ideology than
out of practicality. For a Pakistani
general in the Punjab region, Coll
said, "jihad is something you do at
the office. It's not something you
bring home."
This has meant that Pakistan has
long tried to maintain an often para
doxical balance between authorizing
the actions of militant groups and
maintaining the goodwill of its
American ally.
"This sense of doing things simul
taneously is literally embedded with
in the system," Coll said.
Coll admitted that he felt Pak
istan, for a long time, had not been
wrong in its assessment of the practi
cal benefits of the fighters, nor in its
resistance to American pressures to
crack down, at least among some
parts of the Pakistani army.
Pakistani leaders, especially in the
military, also remember the failures

of American policy in the late 1980's
following the Soviets' war in
Afghanistan and an ensuing "lost
decade."
"U.S. policy has contributed to the
problem U.S. policy is now trying to
address," Coll said.
He added, however, that the ac
celeration of political events in the
region since 2007 had changed the
merits of this assessment and said
that, slowly, a shift in Pakistani atti
tudes was resulting.
"Managed jihad" is also insepara
ble from Pakistan's policies toward
India, Coll noted. The army in Pak
istan picked up the mujahedeen
model and applied it to conflict with
India in Kashmir in the late 1980's
and early 1990'5.
"And it worked," he said, "600,000
Indian troops were tied down in
Kashmir fighting a force of no more
than a few thousand."
Coll said that, for the United
States, the most vital task was "to
convince the Pakistanis that it's in
their interest to convert violence to

politics."
Coll also noted the disappoint
ment of an effort in this direction in
late 2006 and 2007, when India and
Pakistan came close to reaching a
framework for normalized relations.
The two nations have been in conflict
since partition in 1947, and Coll re
peatedly emphasized that Pakistan's
concerns toward India drove many
of its actions.

That diplomatic effort collapsed
after actions by Pervez Musharraf,
the former president of Pakistan,
precipitated a loss of his control over
the country. The process destabilized
politics within the country, leading to
a democratic rebirth on the one
hand, but on the other, complicating
the process of foreign relations.
"One thing about Musahrraf was,
you had one negotiator," Coll said.
One story stuck in Coil's mind as
an example of the lost possibilities of
that diplomatic effort, which col
lapsed. In the fall of 2006, a Pakistani
businessman heard from his brother
in the Pakistani army that negotia

tions were imminent. Hie business
man went to the border between
India and Pakistan in the Punjab and
started leasing transit stations, as
suming that he could profit between
the growth of trade between the two

nations and the new economic op
portunities it would offer.
"I think of that brother with the
warehouses repeatedly," Coll said.
"The goal of U.S. policy is to get
back to that moment," he added.
Coll noted that, despite the im
mense complexities of Pakistan, the
capacity for normalized relations
with its powerful neighbor re
mained strong outside the corridors
of power.
"Fundamentally, the middle
classes in Pakistan and India are
way ahead of their governments on
the reconciliation issue," Coll said.
"Way ahead."
