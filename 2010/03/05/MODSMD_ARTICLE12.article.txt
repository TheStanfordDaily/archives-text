## Jarrett encourages public service 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With Silicon Valley the preferred
destination for many Stanford gradu
ates, some students ignore govern
mental work as a viable career
choice. At this year's St. Clair Drake
Memorial Lecture, held Thursday at
Memorial Auditorium, Valerie Jarrett
'7B, a senior advisor to President
Obama, encouraged Stanford stu
dents to look beyond the private sec
tor and get involved with public serv
ice and leadership.
"My worst day in the public sector
and I've had some really bad days
was better than my worst day in
the private sector," she said.
Jarrett is one of the president's
longest-serving advisors, having
known Obama since 1991, when she
hired Michelle Obama then
Barack's fiancee to work in Chica
go Mayor Richard Daley's office. In
addition to her role as an advisor, Jar
rett has two other titles Assistant
to the President for Intergovernmen
tal Relations and Public Liaison, and

Chairperson of the White House
Commission on Women and Girls.
While some were expecting a pol
icy talk, Jarrett instead delivered a
highly personal account of her own
life.
Jarrett began by describing her
childhood and the path that led her to
Stanford. She was born in Iran and
moved to Chicago at age 5. She told
the audience the story of her father,
who was the first black resident in a
Chicago hospital and who moved to
Iran to practice medicine rather than
accepting pay significantly lower
than that of his white peers.
"I wanted to see how that experi
ence [of being born in Iran] fit into
what she's done," said Anna Schick
ele 'l3. "It was interesting to hear her
life story."
After graduating from Stanford in
1978 with a degree in psychology, Jar
rett attended law school at the Uni
versity of Michigan and then was
hired by a private law firm in Chica
go-
"I took the path of least resist
ance," she said. "I'm not proud of it,
but that's what I did."
Dissatisfied and "miserable" at
her law firm, Jarrett chose to enter
public service, working in the Chica
go mayor's office until 2005 and then
serving as CEO of the Habitat Com
pany before joining Barack Obama's
administration in 2008. She de
scribed some of the lessons she
learned working under Daley.
"Find the place where people ap
preciate your choices, your gratifica
tion beyond your job," she said. "If
you don't, you'll be miserable."
Jarrett ended her talk describing
her experience working in Barack
Obama's administration.
"It's been an extraordinary last 14
months," she said. "We've made an
enormous difference in one year and
we still have an enormous, long jour
ney to go."
In many ways, Jarrett's speech
served to encourage Stanford stu
dents to get involved with public
service. She spoke at length about en
gaging with the local community and
with the government at the local,
state and federal level, and discussed
her own experience tutoring autistic
students during her time at Stanford.
"Ordinary people can do extraor
dinary things," she said. "You are ex
traordinary people, so just imagine
what you can do, and go out there
and do it."
Jarrett answered more specific
questions about policy and govern
ing in a session with Profs. Harry and
Michele Elam after her speech.
Michele serves as the director of
African and African American Stud
ies, the department that hosted the

event.
"The appropriate role of govern
ment is to do what the private sector
cannot d 0... it must provide the
safety net necessary for the private
sector to thrive," Jarrett said.
After the presentation, students
had positive reactions to Jarrett's
message.
"The fact that she took the time
out of her schedule to come here and
talk to us was great," said Kelsei
Wharton 'l2. "It certainly met my ex
pectations ... she talked about lead
ership and her experiences, instead
of delivering a policy paper."
"I didn't really have any expecta
tions," added Taryn Sanks 'l3. "I
liked that it was personal."
Though Jarrett's talk was general
ly seen as quite strong, some students
felt there were a few missing ele
ments.
"One question I would have liked
to ask her was what she would have
done differently," said Camira Pow
ell 'l3. "I wanted to know how what
she learned here has affected the rest
of her life."
"Maybe she could have given a
shout-out to whatever dorm she
lived in," Schickele added.
