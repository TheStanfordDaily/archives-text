### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With Silicon Valley the preferred
destination for many Stanford gradu
ates, some students ignore govern
mental work as a viable career
choice. At this year's St. Clair Drake
Memorial Lecture, held Thursday at
Memorial Auditorium, Valerie Jarrett
'7B, a senior advisor to President
Obama, encouraged Stanford stu

Chairperson of the White House

"I wanted to see how that experi

life story."
After graduating from Stanford in
1978 with a degree in psychology, Jar
rett attended law school at the Uni

hired by a private law firm in Chica
