## TRUE LIFE: I have an eating disorder PART TWO IN A SERIES OF TWO 
### E. BLAIR LANG STAFF WRITER 
Eating disorders are not just a woman
thing. "We see more and more men
every year," said Dr. Naomi Brown,
a psychologist with Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS).
"For men, it is often about the need to buff up,
steroid abuse, over-exercising and weight lift
ing. We also see anorexia and bulimia in
males."
For John, a Stanford student whose name
has been changed to protect his identity, his
fight with body image and eating disorders in
cluded both anorexia and over-exercising.
When he looked in the mirror, he saw cheeks,
and contemplated ways of how to get rid of
them.
By the 11th grade, he was eating less and
less with one goal in mind: weight loss. He
drastically changed his diet, eating only cer
tain protein and salad.
John, who was on the tennis team at the
time, said that his coach and his mother both
noticed and tried to force him to eat.
"I exercised more than I ate in high
school," he said. "Freshman year of college, I
had one meal a day and it was basically chick
en or salad."
By the end of his freshman year at Stan
ford, he had dropped from 165 to 128 pounds.
"My mother was seriously worried," John
said. "I used to wear baggy clothes freshman
year, so the kids in the dorm didn't notice me
lose the weight. I had stopped going to the

gym."
His mother consulted a nutritionist, but he
refused to listen. Yet it wasn't until John real
ized how weak he was while weight lifting that
he began to change his outlook.
"I got more into looking buff," he said. "But
when I went to the gym, I figured out I could
n't do anything."
In a dramatic turn of events, John returned
to more normal eating habits and now looks
physically healthy. But he still pays much at
tention to his diet and exercise.
"I still try to avoid eating sugar or carbs if I
am not working out that day," he said. "This
month, I have just been going to the gym once
or twice, so I have had no reason to eat. In gen
eral, I eat a lot and I go to the gym a lot."
John still hasn't talked to a professional
about his eating disorder, explaining that he
has never felt the need to.
"I only eat as much as I need to," he said. "I
don't want to eat more because I don't have
any reason to eat more. I don't like food."
"Jenny"
For another Stanford student, anorexia
began as just a game with a friend.
"My friend and I thought it would be cool
to lose a few pounds," said Jenny, a Stanford
student whose name has been changed to pro
tect her identity. "And then I stopped eating. It
happened really quickly. Before I even knew
it, I had a full-blown eating disorder."
Jenny talked to someone professionally
about her issues for a few weeks, but cut off
counseling when she thought it wasn't work
ing for her.
She went from 115 to 90 pounds in a period
of six months.
"I was struggling to have energy to do

work," she said. "My body couldn't take it any
more. Eating 800, 600, 400 calories is hard.
Then I hit that breaking point where my life
was pretty miserable."
"I didn't need the psychological shackles
that come with having an eating disorder, and
I started eating more," she added.
With support from her friends, she began to
eat more, eventually returning to her original
figure. This again made her struggle with her
body image.
"I had support from a really great

boyfriend," she said. "And my close friends
helped me feel good about myself. They made
me realize that being worried about five or 10
pounds didn't matter."
Taking Action
"It is never a good time to approach some
one with a raging eating disorder," Brown
said. "But it is always a good thing to ask a
friend how they are doing. The safest thing to
do is to talk about behaviors, including their
appearance."
Denial is one of the greatest barriers to get
ting someone help or to getting an accurate
tally on eating disorder statistics at Stanford.
"There are bulimia clubs at Stanford, there
are anorexia clubs at Stanford," Brown said.
"But we do not have any statistics on these is
sues because the first stage of an eating disor
der is denial."
If you know someone who is potentially
suffering from an eating disorder, doctors at
Vaden recommend that you let that person
know that they have your support. You can
then ask if they are willing to go in to Vaden.
"We want to put out the message that seek
ing help is proactive," Brown added. "Every
one needs help from time to time because
we're human and life is challenging."
For Janelle Leatherwood 'lO, a recovered
bulimic who sought help for her eating disor
der, the challenge of overcoming body issues
isn't a simple fix. It's a daily trial.
"There is no going back," Leatherwood
said. "It defines a huge part of my life. It
changes how I think about things. I can have a
bad day just because I feel fat, but I have to
keep operating in the world. I have to deal."
