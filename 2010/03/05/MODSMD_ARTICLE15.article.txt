## SENSE AND NONSENSE Echoes of Ourselves 
### Aysha Bagchi 
Feeling that we are not understood is a
particularly common characteristic of
youth and an experience many of us can
relate to. Older generations tend to write off
this aspect of young life as angst and rebel
lion. One of the least flattering versions of
young people was captured in Shakespeare's
Hamlet : "Youth to itself rebels though none
else near." This is the older generation's ver
sion of teenage despondency: young people
rebellious and hormonal without reason. J.D.
Salinger offered a more sympathetic depic
tion in his Catcher in the Rye character, Hold
en Caulfield, who exhibits a feeling of isola
tion from the world, especially in his interac
tion with his parents and those who resemble
the status quo. When Salinger died in Janu
ary, my Facebook newsfeed filled with
friends' statuses lamenting his death. One
friend, a creative writing major, wrote that
Salinger first inspired him to write.
Salinger created a character that young
people could relate to Holden's followers
have all, at some point, shared in feelings of
isolation. This common experience is not
about lacking friends or loved ones in our
lives, but about not feeling like we can be
fully understood by them, about lacking peo
ple who are both sympathetic and speak the
same language. The phenomenon may large
ly be a product of growing older, of coming
into ourselves and leaving our old worlds be
hind in the process. In this sense, feeling
alone is sometimes the sign of growth. But we
grow further still when our new selves find
kindred spirits, the people who understand
and challenge us.
Books and movies can play an important
role as avenues through which we relate to
others, as means of universalizing parts of our
lives. We see in a character a little snippet of
ourselves, in a story an experience we know.
And this relation between ourselves and a
fictional world can be tremendously com
forting! Characters provide constant com
panions, ones who never leave us. What is
more, they are created by a human being
an actual person who captured our thoughts
in a story and so they give us a sense of in
teraction with the emotional compatriot who
wrote them into existence. If people com
plained about J.D. Salinger's hermetic way of
life, one reason is that they desired to know
him better as a person because he seemed to
understand them so well. Fiction creates a
window into the mind of its creator, a connec
tion that spans space and time.
Books and movies can achieve remark
able things in our lives. But it is infinitely
more exciting when we encounter a person in
whom we see ourselves. Nothing can replace
real relationships with two-way communica
tion, and we should never forget the value of
these relationships. Especially in the week
after Parents Weekend, when 3,000 parents
descended upon the Farm to enjoy a few days
in their child's world, thoughts of who we are
in relation to who we once were and where

we came from may be especially on students'
minds. A visit from home can take us back to
a world that seems old, to people who don't
understand us as they used to and who are
not growing and changing at the same pace.
Maintaining connections with parents and
old friends is important, but reaching out to
new people is also crucial as we get older and
understand ourselves in different ways. Col
lege is the time to do this, to seek out others
who breathe oxygen into our lives. Our
friendships should provide structural sup
port, and they can only do this when they are
in part based on a genuine human connec
tion.
A very wise friend recently impressed
upon me the importance of cultivating these
friendships, of seeking out others in whom I
see echoes of myself. I can think of little ad
vice that could ring more true! We should all
seek out others whom we relate to and invest
in these relationships when we find them.
Trying to understand ourselves without con
necting to others is isolating, and it is an illu
sion to think such a life will ever completely
satisfy. We are social creatures; meaning in
life has everything to do with human connec
tion. It seems strange to think this may re
quire a conscious and concerted effort, but it
often does. Forging human relationships
sometimes begs for proactive behavior
and sustaining them can require deliberate
attention. We should devote a little effort to
this, especially to inviting new people into
our lives; there is little that brings more joy or
self-understanding.
