# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
The following is in response to Michael
Lazarus' March 3 column entitled, "Indian
could work if done respectfully."

In a self-interested quest for fame and for
tune, Christopher Columbus, thinking he had
arrived in the West Indies, dubbed the inhab
itants Indians, at first out of honest ignorance
and thereafter out of the arrogant vanity nec
essary to knowingly misapply a term to a
people solely because one considers oneself
the reference point of the universe.
In Mr. Lazarus' misguided article, I hear
echoes of someone and a society in search of
not fame and fortune, but identity. Unfortu
nately, I also hear echoes of the ignorance
and arrogant vanity of his lost predecessor.
Only the blissful ignorance of a cultural
orphan could explain the suggestion that
picking one out of the "tons of local tribes in
the area" and designing a "culturally and his
torically correct" mascot benefits that lucky
tribe.
Mr. Lazarus suggests that the tribe "per
form during halftime shows at football and
basketball games, displaying different as
pects of its culture and customs." Do we real
ly want to watch people shopping for dinner
or blowing out candles on a birthday cake at
halftime? I suppose "Indians" are frozen in
time and still fish the Bay in canoes when
they get hungry. Even if they did, what crowd
wouldn't get energized by that?
Only the arrogant vanity of a Columbus
would consider the exchange of "recogni
tion, money prominence and respect" for
"fir[ing] up the crowd at home games" a good
deal for the tribe. After all, who is doling out

this recognition, money, prominence and re
spect? "Fundraisers and charity events?"
Why didn't you say so!
Mr. Lazarus claims that "[s]ports have the
power to enhance a reputation," that mascots
done right "most importantly, remind the
public that the tribe still in fact exists." I sup
pose Chief Illiniwek was a great reminder
that the Illinois tribe still exists; turns out the
Illinois were not a tribe but rather a confed
eration of tribes, and that it does not exist as
such anymore. And it's great that "the aver
age American" associates Seminoles with
Florida, but how do they know they were
largely displaced to Oklahoma? Maybe they
should re-enact that at halftime.
Conversely, Mr. Lazarus claims that
when the Indian mascot went away, it was
"as if Native Americans were never a part
of the Bay Area's history." Why? Because
Americans did not have a mascot to remind
them, of course, since a lack of media atten
tion and pop culture indifference can erase
history.
The real problem here is a lack of identity.
There are great things about being Native,
but there are tough things, too. At least the
Fighting Irish were actually Irish that were
fighting to some extent at some point. Do
some family history, go visit the land of your
ancestors, reconnect with who you are.
Usurping the identity of a convenient local
tribe temporarily for a halftime show is not
the answer. Being Native does not stop when
the buzzer sounds for some of us. And Stan
ford Indians are from India.
