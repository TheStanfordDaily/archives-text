# MIDNIGHT FRYER
## "Watch Your Language, Young Lady!" Part I 
### Yanran Lu 
After four weeks of writing a column, I
have been called a woman with
"many experiences," a man-hating
feminist (or bad judge of character) and a
writer with crude language trying to shock
readers. And perhaps I am guilty of all of the
charges, but it is still worthwhile to dig deep
and explore the appropriateness of each of
these titles.
I have had many experiences, some good,
some bad, and the pleasure to meet some de
lightful men who still hold a dear place in my
heart. Through the ups and downs, I longed
to find the holy grail of "love" with no avail.
Like the readers have suggested, perhaps I
need to surround myself with better men,
men who understand and appreciate me as a
person rather than a sexual object. Likewise,
perhaps I need to admire men for their hu
manity and individuality rather than admir
ing them as imperfectly preserved Greek
sculptures. Therefore, as a woman with
"many experiences" who has yet to experi
ence love, I applaud those who have found a
sense of belonging and wish you the best of
luck with the continuous effort in maintain
ing your happiness.
Consequently, because of my "many ex
periences," some readers have also accused
me of promoting casual sex, to which I claim
"not guilty." Promoting casual sex is as re
gressive as promoting abstinence: both cre
ate cultures that force people to conform to a
standard, whether "sexual liberation" or
"sexual deliberation." What I want to pro
mote is a healthy attitude toward one's own
sexuality. If casual sex makes a person happy,
then s/he should not feel judged by society
for having casual sex. Likewise, if a person
feels that sex should only be shared with
someone special, then s/he should not be
pressured into doing something s/he does not
want to do. I have been focusing specifically
on women as victims of sex and stereotypes,
but for every woman accused of being a
"slut," there is a man afraid of being called a
"virgin." In both cases society forces some
one to conform to a norm rather than cele
brate their own sexual identity. Therefore, I

ask you, my readers, to uphold your own be
liefs and not become or make others victims
of "social norms."
As I plow through my comments, I am
also delighted to hear about so many won
derful, ready-to-please (and still available)
men on this campus. This makes a girl giddy.
However, the cases I have listed in previous
articles are, in fact, prevalent in Stanford.
Both men and women have been quick in
telling me that they/their partners are not
like that. In fact, they say, it is my skewed per
ception of the world that made these things
visible to me. While I understand their effort
in restoring the name of men made rotten by
"a few bad apples," I insist on my stance on
respect and awareness.
The scenarios I have listed in my two pre
vious articles have been committed by lovely
Stanford men who may or may not have
beautiful girlfriends. And while it is easy to
dismiss these scenarios of coercion as some

thing "other" than our own experiences, we
have maybe only one degree of separation
between "us" and "them." According to a
U.S. Department of Justice report entitled,
"Sexual Assault on Campus: What Colleges
and Universities Are Doing About It," statis
tics have shown that one in four women have
experienced rape in their college career. In
addition, the report indicates that the major
ity of rape is committed by people whom the
victims know. In fact, "the more intimate the
relationship, the more likely it is for a rape to
be completed rather than attempted. Half of
all student victims do not label the incident
'rape.'" We read these statistics, and easily re
move ourselves from the statistical pool or
place ourselves in the non-victim and non-of
fender category. Therefore, to emphasize the
"rarity" instead of (in context) "often" is
counterproductive to my objective.
What we have to keep in mind is that peo
ple around us, and perhaps we, too, have been
or will be "challenged" in the bedroom, and
confronted by something that makes us un
comfortable. It could be the situation listed
or it could be something more minor or se
vere. If we recognize the situation, we have a
choice in deciding which part of the statistical
pool we want to belong to. We can choose to
recognize the violation and stand up firmly in
defense of our own beliefs and of ourselves.
Or we can dismiss it, and be like the female
protagonist from "The Blowjob Scenario,"
compromising our own morals and self-es
teem, scarring our sex-life. Similarly, if we are
the people who are in the position of possible
coercion, do we recognize that we are mak
ing our partners feel uncomfortable and con
sequently remove ourselves from the "gray
zone," respecting our partners while protect
ing our own integrity? Or do we let our pri
mal instinct take over and make regretful
judgments that could be life damaging?

celebrating celibacy as a sex columnist for the
sheer irony of it.
