### ALYSSA AHLUWALIA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tomorrow, the No. 2 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (27-1,17-0 Pac-10) will end its regu
lar season on the road against California. The
highly anticipated "Battle of the Bay II" will tip
off at 12:30 p.m.
Though the Cardinal has already claimed the
regular season Pac-10 title (for the 10th consecu
tive year), it will still look to end its season with
an 18-0 conference record.
The first "Battle of the Bay" took place in Jan
uary. The Cardinal overwhelmed the Bears, win
ning by a final score of 79-58. In a weekly inter
view posted on GoStanford.com, Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer made it clear that the
team will not take the competition this weekend
lightly.
"We played Cal in the first Pac-10 game this
year," she said. "I knew that when we played
them again, their freshmen would not be fresh
men anymore that they would improve a lot,
and they have. They've had a great season with
such young players."
Cal (17-11,11-6) saw its five-game winning
streak snapped when it lost to Arizona State 57-
50 last Saturday.The Bears have had some recent
momentum, however, going 11-3 in their last 14
games. Fifth-year senior Joanne Boyle, senior
guard Alexis Gray-Lawson and freshman De-
Nesha Stallworth will likely lead their team in
scoring and rebounding.
After this weekend, the Cardinal will look
forward to the Pac-10 Tournament. Because of
its regular season record, Stanford has locked up
the tournament's top seed.
"People are getting excited about the tourna
ment; they're feeling a sense of urgency," Van-
Derveer said. "Each game, whether it's playing
Cal or playing the Pac-10 Tournament [has a]
tournament atmosphere. Once you hit the
NCAA or even the Pac-10, if you have a bad
game, you are out."
Unfortunately, the Cardinal has not been im-

mune to injuries this season. With the brunt of
the injuries falling on Stanford's guards—jun
ior Jeanette Pohlen, junior JJ. Hones, senior Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude and junior Melanie Murphy
have all been injured a lot of responsibility
has fallen onto the Cardinal post players to
maintain team consistency.

original record of 1,214 boards. Appel

the Week awards this season. Thanks
to the dependable offensive efforts of
Ogwumike and Pedersen, the Cardi

nal expects to have a strong end to the
regular season this weekend.
"[Cal has] a very athletic team, a
very motivated team it's one of the
best teams in the Pac-10," VanDerveer
said.

But the Cardinal is anxious to show
its own improvements as well.

"We're excited... our team likes

great preparation for the NCAA
