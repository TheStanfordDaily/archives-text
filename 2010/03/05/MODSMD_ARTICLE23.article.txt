# FULLERTON SHOWDOWN

### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford softball team
(12-2) travels to Fullerton, Calif, this
weekend to take part in the DeMari
ni Invitational.

The Cardinal will play five games
during the three-day tournament, in
cluding a rematch with Northwest
ern which beat the Cardinal last
weekend and a showdown with
third-ranked Florida.

Stanford is coming off of a 4-1
showing at the Cathedral City Clas
sic last weekend, with its only loss

coming at the hands of the Wildcats.
The Cardinal relies on a powerful
offense, led by a pair of All-Ameri
cans, senior left fielder Alissa Haber
and sophomore second baseman
Ashley Hansen.
Haber enters the weekend hitting
a team-leading .489 batting average,
three home runs and 16 runs batted
in. Hansen, who played shortstop a
year ago but moved to the right side
of the diamond this year, is doing her
part, hitting .409 out of the second
spot in the lineup.
Also enjoying a strong early sea
son for Stanford is senior catcher

Rosey Neill. Neill is second on the
team with a .429 batting average,
while also managing an inexperi
enced pitching staff.
Leading that staff has been fresh
man Teagan Gerhart. Gerhart,
whose twin sister Kelsey is also a
freshman on the team, is 7-1 with a
2.21 earned run average. Junior Ash
ley Chinn has been Stanford's other
go-to pitcher this year she is 5-1
with a 2.33 ERA.
Stanford opens its weekend in
Fullerton today with its toughest
test, perennial power Florida (12-1).
The Gators and the Cardinal last
met two years ago at this same tour
nament, with Florida leaving with a
4-3 victory on Mary Ratliff's walk-off
three-run home run in the bottom of
the seventh.
This season the Gators are as
good as ever, and they come in hot,
having won 11 consecutive games.
Leading the way for them is junior
pitcher Stephanie Brombacher.
Brombacher is 10-1 with a 1.79 ERA
on the year.
Much like the Cardinal, the
Gators are led offensively by a senior
left fielder. For Florida, that player is
Francesca Enea. She is hitting .417
with six home runs and 20 RBIs on
the season.
After its matchup with the
Gators, Stanford will play a second
game today, this one against host Cal
State Fullerton (3-10). The Titans,
who went 1-4 at the Cathedral City
Classic last weekend, have struggled
to find pitching this year. Their team
ERA, amassed by four pitchers, is an
astronomical 7.41.
On Saturday, Stanford will take
on North Carolina in the morning
before its rematch with Northwest
ern.
The Tar Heels (10-3) come in rid
ing a nine-game win streak. Senior
pitcher Danielle Spaulding has been
a catalyst for North Carolina both of
fensively and in the circle, posting a
5-1 record and a 0.93 ERA, while
also leading the team with three
home runs and 11 RBIs.
Northwestern (6-8) has struggled
this season, but managed to shut out
the Cardinal last weekend, 4-0. Stan
ford couldn't figure out senior pitch

Stanford will face significantly tougher competition this weekend at the
DeMarini Invitational in Fullerton. The Cardinal has gone 8-1 in its past 10
games, but it will play three very strong teams in Florida, Northwestern and
North Carolina. Stanford lost to the Wildcats last weekend in Cathedral City.
