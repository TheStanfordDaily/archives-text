# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## FIGHTING FOR THE TOP SPOT 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
This weekend, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's volleyball team will
host No. 14 UC-San Diego and
No. 6 Long Beach State. The Car
dinal hopes to extend its three
game winning streak and stay in
the running for the conference's
and the nation's top spot.
Stanford (10-4, 8-4 MPSF) is
coming off a successful week of
conference play, with a three
game sweep of UC-Santa Cruz
and a 3-1 victory over Pacific. Be
cause the Card is only a half
match behind the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation (MPSF)
leader, Pepperdine, this week
end's matches are crucial for the
team's momentum going for
ward.

The Cardinal offense has
proven unstoppable in the team's
current hot streak, leading the na
tion with a .353 overall hitting
percentage. Against Pacific, soph
omore outside hitter Brad Law
son led the team with an impres
sive .561 hitting percentage and
27 kills. Senior opposite Evan
Romero and junior outside hitter
Spencer McLachlin each con
tributed 14 kills. Senior setter
Kawika Shoji tallied 61 assists in
the victory.
In preparation for this week
end's matches, the team has been

focusing on its defensive play.
"Every day, we work to per
form our best consistently over
time," Shoji said. "We need to
continue to improve in all aspects
of the game, but have focused on
blocking and defense recently."
Although ranked lower than
Stanford, both UCSD and Long
Beach are formidable opponents
for the Card.

While UCSD (5-12, 2-10) has
only two conference victories,
both came on the road against
solid squads: No. 5 UCLA and
No. 1 Pepperdine. Senior oppo
site Frank Fritsch leads the Tri
tons in kills averaging 3.57 kills
per set while the team is hit
ting .291 overall. Senior Jason
Spangler and junior Joel David
son, both outside hitters, also add
to the offense with 3.25 kills per
set and 3.19 kills per set, respec
tively.

"UCSD has some great wins
this year," Shoji said. "We know
how dangerous they are, and we
are a mature team that respects
our opponents."
Long Beach State (8-6,6-4) is
also riding a three-game winning
streak as it heads north to face the
Card. The team is led by senior
outside hitter Tommy Pestolesi,
who was voted AVCA National
Player of the Week and MPSF
Player of the Week for his .488 hit
ting percentage against UC-Irvine
and 15 kills against UCLA. Aside
from current leader Pepperdine,

Long Beach was the only team to re
ceive a first place vote in the AVCA
Coaches Poll.

"We want to win both matches,"
Shoji added. "We have a great op
portunity to win both and continue
to move to the top of the MPSF
standings."

Following Saturday's match,
Stanford will have a two-week break

from matches to rest and prepare for
the last stretch of conference play.

The Cardinal will take on UC-
San Diego tonight at 7 p.m. and Long
Beach State at 7:30 tomorrow. Both
matches will take place at Maples
Pavilion.
