# Streaks are hard on athletes
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Nothing lasts forever.
Winning streaks in
sports are really hard to
start, and even harder to
continue.
The Stanford men's swimming and
diving team is going for 29 straight Pac
-10 swimming titles this weekend. It's a
pretty incredible streak, one that has
spanned decades of athletes,
Olympians and teams. Head coach
Skip Kenney has been through every
single one. It is a streak that has defined
Stanford men's swimming since the
1980s.
These streaks are hard on the cur
rent athletes, though. No athlete wants
to be on the team that loses the streak.
Inside every current athlete is a little bit
of the former athletes who paved the
way and allowed the current group to
have a chance to extend the streak. No
athlete wants to be associated with the
end of dominance. Truth be told, every
swimmer in that pool this weekend
wearing a Stanford cap wants to come
home with No. 29.

When I was in high school, we had
not lost to our rival in football in 14
years. In fact, our rival was built after
my high school, so it had never beaten
us in football, ever. We had shirts with
the word "Never" on them as a tribute
to the fact that we had never lost to
them. But nothing lasts forever.

I was on the team that lost to our ri
vals for the first time. They were ecstat
ic to break the losing streak, even going
so far as to rush our home field when
the clock hit zeroes. The players felt
ashamed, embarrassed and disappoint
ed to be forever remembered as the
team that lost, the team that ended
"never." The team that lost the streak
that so many teams before us had built
up and maintained.
But we got over it. And it really was
n't the end of the world.The streak was
great, but it was bound to end at some
point. The players and coaches accept
ed this faster than we all would have
thought because we understood how
accomplished we were in the previous
14 years. We came back the next week
to focus on winning the next game. We
ended up winning the San Diego city
championship that year. Some of us
had forgotten about the broken streak
by that point.
Arkansas track and field won 12
straight NCAA indoor track and field
championships from 1984-1995. Con
necticut women's basketball won 70
games in a row a few years ago. UCLA
basketball won 14 Pac-10 titles in a row,
back when John Wooden was the
coach. They also won 88 straight games
from 1971-1974, including four NCAA
Tournament titles. Besides being amaz
ing, successful and record-breaking
streaks, these all have something in
common all of them eventually
came to an end.
It's really hard in sports to keep up
winning streaks, especially when the
athletes are getting bigger, faster and
stronger; and especially when every
team and player starts gunning for you.
A team cannot keep up perfection
forever because at some point, the
magic of the streak just doesn't contin
ue. Something will happen. Or maybe it
will just face a better team and will be
outperformed on that day. Champi
onship winning streaks are even hard
er, as a team has to peak at the same
time of the year, every year, continually
fielding teams that are better than

everyone else's best.
Some teams would drop everything
to win one title. Winning 28, like the
Cardinal has done, is beyond impres
sive. It is a record that probably will
never be touched again. But unfortu
nately, one day it will end.
Stanford has done well enough the
past 28 years to claim the Pac-10 title
every year. They have fended off high
ly ranked teams and fast swimmers to
come out on top. They have even won
when they weren't heavily favored.
This year is no different, as the team is
the underdog to No. 1 Arizona and will
be up against a tough Cal squad, as
well. Whichever team wins the Pac-10
this weekend will deserve it because it
had the fastest swimmers and depth
across multiple events. For 28 years,
Stanford has had the best combination
of those factors. However, year 29 is a
new year. Stanford has the talent to win
No. 29. Other teams have the talent to

take back the podium spot where Stan
ford has stood the past 28 years. You
can be sure nothing would be sweeter
to other schools than to take the title
away from the Cardinal.
Do I want the men's swim
team to win this weekend? Of
course. Do I think the streak is
great? Absolutely. Do the swim
mers want to win this weekend and
make it 29? Is that even a question?
But if they do not come out on top, and
they break their streak, it's going to be
OKAY. I would tell the athletes not to
dwell on it, no matter how disappoint
ed they were. Be more disappointed
about individual performances and the
current team's performance than the
larger streak. Don't compare yourself
to the Stanford teams and athletes of
the past the last 28 years mean noth
ing, and it is this year that matters.
The streak hasn't continued be
cause the Card has been swimming for
the teams and athletes in the past. All
28 teams have swum for themselves, in
the present, trying to touch that wall
before the person in the lane next to
them did.That is what made this streak,
and that is what will keep it going. If it
continues for 10 more years, then that is
great, and just further etches this
team's legacy in stone. If it doesn't, then
it is not the end of the world. Stanford
swimming and these athletes will live
on far beyond this streak.
While the mentality of an athlete is
never to think of the end of success, it's
a little hard to think that whatever win
streak you are on can continue without
end. Misty May-Treanor and Kerri
Walsh had an unstoppable 112-match,
two-year winning streak going until
they lost in 2008. After the game, May-
Treanor simply said, "It happens."

Nothing lasts forever.
The streak for men's swimming is
remarkable and record-defying. I hope
it continues this weekend. But if it
doesn't, I will tip my hat and say well
done. The next time they swim, they
can start a new one.

tensive hat collection to find the best

But if they do not come out on top, and
they break their streak, it's going to be
OKAY. I would tell the athletes not to
dwell on it, no matter how disappoint
ed they were. Be more disappointed
about individual performances and the
current team's performance than the
larger streak. Don't compare yourself
to the Stanford teams and athletes of
the past the last 28 years mean noth
ing, and it is this year that matters.
The streak hasn't continued be
cause the Card has been swimming for
the teams and athletes in the past. All
28 teams have swum for themselves, in
the present, trying to touch that wall
before the person in the lane next to
them did.That is what made this streak,
and that is what will keep it going. If it
continues for 10 more years, then that is
great, and just further etches this
team's legacy in stone. If it doesn't, then
it is not the end of the world. Stanford
swimming and these athletes will live
on far beyond this streak.
While the mentality of an athlete is
never to think of the end of success, it's
a little hard to think that whatever win
streak you are on can continue without
end. Misty May-Treanor and Kerri
Walsh had an unstoppable 112-match,
two-year winning streak going until
they lost in 2008. After the game, May-
Treanor simply said, "It happens."

Nothing lasts forever.
The streak for men's swimming is
remarkable and record-defying. I hope
it continues this weekend. But if it
doesn't, I will tip my hat and say well
done. The next time they swim, they
can start a new one.

Winning streaks in
sports are really hard to
start, and even harder to
continue.
The Stanford men's swimming and
diving team is going for 29 straight Pac
-10 swimming titles this weekend. It's a
pretty incredible streak, one that has
spanned decades of athletes,
Olympians and teams. Head coach
Skip Kenney has been through every
single one. It is a streak that has defined
Stanford men's swimming since the
1980s.
These streaks are hard on the cur
rent athletes, though. No athlete wants
to be on the team that loses the streak.
Inside every current athlete is a little bit
of the former athletes who paved the
way and allowed the current group to
have a chance to extend the streak. No
athlete wants to be associated with the
end of dominance. Truth be told, every
swimmer in that pool this weekend
wearing a Stanford cap wants to come
home with No. 29.

When I was in high school, we had
not lost to our rival in football in 14
years. In fact, our rival was built after
my high school, so it had never beaten
us in football, ever. We had shirts with
the word "Never" on them as a tribute
to the fact that we had never lost to
them. But nothing lasts forever.

I was on the team that lost to our ri
vals for the first time. They were ecstat
ic to break the losing streak, even going
so far as to rush our home field when
the clock hit zeroes. The players felt
ashamed, embarrassed and disappoint
ed to be forever remembered as the
team that lost, the team that ended
"never." The team that lost the streak
that so many teams before us had built
up and maintained.
But we got over it. And it really was
n't the end of the world.The streak was
great, but it was bound to end at some
point. The players and coaches accept
ed this faster than we all would have
thought because we understood how
accomplished we were in the previous
14 years. We came back the next week
to focus on winning the next game. We
ended up winning the San Diego city
championship that year. Some of us
had forgotten about the broken streak
by that point.
Arkansas track and field won 12
straight NCAA indoor track and field
championships from 1984-1995. Con
necticut women's basketball won 70
games in a row a few years ago. UCLA
basketball won 14 Pac-10 titles in a row,
back when John Wooden was the
coach. They also won 88 straight games
from 1971-1974, including four NCAA
Tournament titles. Besides being amaz
ing, successful and record-breaking
streaks, these all have something in
common all of them eventually
came to an end.
It's really hard in sports to keep up
winning streaks, especially when the
athletes are getting bigger, faster and
stronger; and especially when every
team and player starts gunning for you.
A team cannot keep up perfection
forever because at some point, the
magic of the streak just doesn't contin
ue. Something will happen. Or maybe it
will just face a better team and will be
outperformed on that day. Champi
onship winning streaks are even hard
er, as a team has to peak at the same
time of the year, every year, continually
fielding teams that are better than

everyone else's best.
Some teams would drop everything
to win one title. Winning 28, like the
Cardinal has done, is beyond impres
sive. It is a record that probably will
never be touched again. But unfortu
nately, one day it will end.
Stanford has done well enough the
past 28 years to claim the Pac-10 title
every year. They have fended off high
ly ranked teams and fast swimmers to
come out on top. They have even won
when they weren't heavily favored.
This year is no different, as the team is
the underdog to No. 1 Arizona and will
be up against a tough Cal squad, as
well. Whichever team wins the Pac-10
this weekend will deserve it because it
had the fastest swimmers and depth
across multiple events. For 28 years,
Stanford has had the best combination
of those factors. However, year 29 is a
new year. Stanford has the talent to win
No. 29. Other teams have the talent to

take back the podium spot where Stan
ford has stood the past 28 years. You
can be sure nothing would be sweeter
to other schools than to take the title
away from the Cardinal.
Do I want the men's swim
team to win this weekend? Of
course. Do I think the streak is
great? Absolutely. Do the swim
mers want to win this weekend and
make it 29? Is that even a question?
But if they do not come out on top, and
they break their streak, it's going to be
OKAY. I would tell the athletes not to
