# Streaks are hard on athletes

### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Nothing lasts forever.
Winning streaks in
sports are really hard to
start, and even harder to
continue.
The Stanford men's swimming and
diving team is going for 29 straight Pac
-10 swimming titles this weekend. It's a
pretty incredible streak, one that has
spanned decades of athletes,
Olympians and teams. Head coach
Skip Kenney has been through every
single one. It is a streak that has defined
Stanford men's swimming since the
1980s.
These streaks are hard on the cur
rent athletes, though. No athlete wants
to be on the team that loses the streak.
Inside every current athlete is a little bit
of the former athletes who paved the
way and allowed the current group to
have a chance to extend the streak. No
athlete wants to be associated with the
end of dominance. Truth be told, every
swimmer in that pool this weekend
wearing a Stanford cap wants to come
home with No. 29.

When I was in high school, we had
not lost to our rival in football in 14
years. In fact, our rival was built after
my high school, so it had never beaten
us in football, ever. We had shirts with
the word "Never" on them as a tribute
to the fact that we had never lost to
them. But nothing lasts forever.

I was on the team that lost to our ri
vals for the first time. They were ecstat
ic to break the losing streak, even going
so far as to rush our home field when
the clock hit zeroes. The players felt
ashamed, embarrassed and disappoint
ed to be forever remembered as the
team that lost, the team that ended
"never." The team that lost the streak
that so many teams before us had built
up and maintained.
But we got over it. And it really was
n't the end of the world.The streak was
great, but it was bound to end at some
point. The players and coaches accept
ed this faster than we all would have
thought because we understood how
accomplished we were in the previous
14 years. We came back the next week
to focus on winning the next game. We
ended up winning the San Diego city
championship that year. Some of us
had forgotten about the broken streak
by that point.
Arkansas track and field won 12
straight NCAA indoor track and field
championships from 1984-1995. Con
necticut women's basketball won 70
games in a row a few years ago. UCLA
basketball won 14 Pac-10 titles in a row,
back when John Wooden was the
coach. They also won 88 straight games
from 1971-1974, including four NCAA
Tournament titles. Besides being amaz
ing, successful and record-breaking
streaks, these all have something in
common all of them eventually
came to an end.
It's really hard in sports to keep up
winning streaks, especially when the
athletes are getting bigger, faster and
stronger; and especially when every
team and player starts gunning for you.
A team cannot keep up perfection
forever because at some point, the
magic of the streak just doesn't contin
ue. Something will happen. Or maybe it
will just face a better team and will be
outperformed on that day. Champi
onship winning streaks are even hard
er, as a team has to peak at the same
time of the year, every year, continually
fielding teams that are better than
