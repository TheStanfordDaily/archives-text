### Men's tennis halts slide â€“ Kabir Sawhney 
After losing two consecutive
matches to No. 10 California and
No. 5 Southern California, the Stan
ford men's tennis team broke its los
ing streak with a 4-0 win over Utah
on Wednesday at Taube Family Ten
nis Center. Though seven matches
were scheduled to be played, rain
forced the teams indoors to com
plete four matches that were in
progress, with the remaining match
es canceled after the Card secured
victory.
"It was definitely a good feeling
to win the match after the heart
breakers against Cal and USC and a
positive step forward," said fresh
man Sam Ecker.
Stanford's singles players won

four matches, all by significant mar
gins. Junior Alex Clayton defeated
Jason Smits 6-0, 6-4; junior Greg
Hirshman defeated Alex Golding 6-
2,6-3; senior Richard Wire defeated
Timmy Allin 6-4,6-0; and freshman
Denis Lin defeated Dmytro Mame
dov,6-1,6-0.
"We felt fortunate to be able to
finish the match," Ecker said. "We
knew heading into the match that
there was a relatively good chance
that it was going to be cancelled due
to inclement weather, so it felt good
to get a win despite finishing only 4
of the 7 matches."
Stanford's top singles player,
sophomore Bradley Klahn, was up
by a set before his match was sus
pended due to rain. Freshman Matt
Kandath's match, which had start-

Ed, was also suspended. No doubles
matches were started.
This weekend, Stanford heads to
the Pacific Coast Doubles tourna
ment in La Jolla, Calif. The Card
currently has the best doubles team
in the country in Klahn and fellow
sophomore Ryan Thacher. While
the tournament is an open competi
tion, the field will be comprised pri
marily of college teams. The Card's
most prominent opponents will be
from schools like USC, UCLA, Cal
ifornia and Pepperdine.
After the tournament, Stanford
will take a break for finals, then
head off on a road trip to the Mid
west to face Illinois and Michigan
on March 23 and 25, respectively.
