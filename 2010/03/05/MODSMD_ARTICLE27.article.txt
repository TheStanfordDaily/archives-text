## Disappointed on the course Cardinal shoots 21 over par, wins eighth place at Bruin-Wave Invite 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
After a few ups and downs, the Stanford women's
golf team finished in eighth place at the Bruin-Wave
Invitational on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
with an 885 (21-over-par) after playing 54 holes. The
well-organized tournament was hosted by UCLA and
Pepperdine, and was held at Robinson Ranch Golf
Club in Santa Clarita, Calif.

The tournament boasted a deep field that posed a
significant challenge to the No. 14 Cardinal. Five of
the nation's top 10 teams competed No. 2 UCLA,
No. 7 Pepperdine, No. 9 USC and No. 10 Arizona.
In the first round, Stanford shot a 292 (four-over)
to tie Washington for fifth place. It sat 10 strokes be
hind Arizona, which led with a 282. UCLA (286) and
USC (286) were tied for second, with Pepperdine
(288) close behind in fourth.

Junior co-captain Rebecca Durham led the Cardi
nal on the first day. She holed out from the fairway for
an eagle, and had three chip-ins for birdies to shoot 70
(two-under) for the round.

Sophomore Sydney Burlison competed as an in
dividual, and also scored three birdies in the first
round, but fell to 73 (one-over) after hitting a few
bogeys and a double bogey. Senior Angela King
and freshmen Sally Watson also tied Burlison's

score of 73, putting them in 19th place.
Stanford finished in sixth after the second round
with a 295 (587 total). UCLA was in first place by 11
strokes, and was at even par with a total of 576.
Durham once again had a good round on day two,
shooting a one-under-par with a few birdies. However,
she struggled on her last three holes. Watson also had
a fair round, and was at five-under-par at one point.
In the last round on Wednesday, Stanford had its
weakest results, posting a 298. The team finished the
54-hole tournament in eighth place with a score of
885, which is 21 above par. USC won the event with an
866,19 strokes ahead of Stanford.
Individually, Durham slipped to 13th place after
shooting a 77 on the third round. She ended up 10
strokes behind Daniella Kang of Pepperdine, who fin
ished with an eight-under 208 to win the tournament.
Freshmen Watson and Kristina Wong finished the
tournament tied for 18th with a four-over 220. King
finished 29th, Burlison finished 57th and sophomore
Lila Barton finished 89th.
"We were disappointed with our finish," Durham
said. "That being said, we did a lot of good things. This
is the first tournament where we've had a lot of birdies
and the potential of going really low. We were in con
tention with the top teams in the country, and we now
know that if we play to our potential, we can win. We're
a young team and have to take this tournament as a
learning experience. Next time, we'll finish strong."
The Cardinal women will be back in full swing
March 26-28 at the Besty Rawls Longhorn Invitation
al in Austin, Texas.
