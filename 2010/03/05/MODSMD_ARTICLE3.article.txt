## Fac. Sen. talks ROTC Profs, ask for return of military program 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Professors William Perry and
David Kennedy made a case for the
return of the Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps (ROTC) to campus yes
terday in front of the Faculty Senate,
which passed a motion to investigate
potential relations with the pro
gram.
The ROTC program, which during
the Second World War involved
roughly half of undergraduate males,
left campus in 1973. According to
Kennedy '63, the 1969 Faculty Senate

But yesterday, Kennedy and Perry
expressed confidence in President
Obama's ability to end the policy.
Stephen Krasner, an international
relations professor, cautioned the fac

"I would urge the committee to
not make it hostage to what happens
to 'don't ask, don't tell,"' Krasner said.
The elimination of ROTC from
campus has negatively affected both
students and the military, Kennedy
and Perry said.
"I do think that we are in danger of

old tradition of the citizen soldier,"
Kennedy said, noting that the armed
