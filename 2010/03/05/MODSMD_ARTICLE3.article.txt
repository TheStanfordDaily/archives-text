## Fac. Sen. talks ROTC Profs, ask for return of military program 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Professors William Perry and
David Kennedy made a case for the
return of the Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps (ROTC) to campus yes
terday in front of the Faculty Senate,
which passed a motion to investigate
potential relations with the pro
gram.
The ROTC program, which during
the Second World War involved
roughly half of undergraduate males,
left campus in 1973. According to
Kennedy '63, the 1969 Faculty Senate
terminated the program because of
academic concerns over the faculty
status of military instructors and units
given to students, and punitive clauses
in student contracts for those who left
the program.
The punitive clauses students
who left the program were automati
cally conscripted are now gone,
and academic concerns were nego
tiable then and should be negotiable
now, Kennedy said.
But both Kennedy and Perry '49
M.S. '5O, the former U.S. Secretary of
Defense, said that the elimination of
the military's "don't ask, don't tell"
policy is a prerequisite for the return
of ROTC to campus.
When Perry was discussing the
issue with President Hennessy last
decade, the controversial policy came
up as a roadblock.
"We both decided that with 'don't
ask, don't tell,' it was inappropriate to
re-raise the question," Perry said.
But yesterday, Kennedy and Perry
expressed confidence in President
Obama's ability to end the policy.
Stephen Krasner, an international
relations professor, cautioned the fac
ulty that political uncertainties sur
rounding "don't ask, don't tell" should
not dictate the University's reconsid
eration of ROTC.
"I would urge the committee to
not make it hostage to what happens
to 'don't ask, don't tell,"' Krasner said.
The elimination of ROTC from
campus has negatively affected both
students and the military, Kennedy
and Perry said.
"I do think that we are in danger of
seriously compromising a 200-year
old tradition of the citizen soldier,"
Kennedy said, noting that the armed
forces are now very small and effi
cient, and don't involve much of the
civilian public.
Kennedy spoke about the emer
gence of a "military caste," which
both he and Perry noted as a trou
bling phenomenon.
In 2008, Kennedy said, of 307 top
level general officers, 180 had chil
dren in the service. By comparison, in
a civilian body of similar stature, the
U.S. Congress, just 10 0f535 members
had children in the service.
This divergence of civilian and
military life has serious implications
for political accountability of the
armed forces, Kennedy said.
Both Kennedy and Perry empha
sized that the University, which aims
to train the leaders of the future, must
embrace ROTC if it is going to play a
role in training future military lead
ers.
"The main reason I joined ROTC
[just after World War ll,] was that in
the event that our country faced an
other crisis, I wanted the opportunity
to be in a leadership role," Perry said.
"Had Stanford not had ROTC, I
would not have come to Stanford."
Perry supported all of Kennedy's
assertions, and added several anec
dotes that illustrated his support for
bringing the program back to cam
pus.
He told the story of twin sisters
participating in Air Force ROTC that
were in a class he taught at Stanford,

and the extent to which the time
spent meeting their commitments off
campus caused them to miss oppor
tunities.

"In my view, these sisters were
some of the best Stanford students I
have met," he said. "I just felt that the
loss to them, and the loss to other
Stanford students, in not being able
to participate in campus activities,
was really a shame."
Perry also spoke about the experi
ence of his son, a Marine, sitting in
one of his lecture classes while in uni
form.
Though his son expressed some
apprehension about roaming cam
pus in uniform he had heard Stan
ford students were anti-military
he received an instant standing ova
tion from the 100 students in atten
dance, Perry said.
Other Business
Professor Arthur Bienenstock
gave a presentation on the Govern
ment-Research University Partner
ship, highlighting the Obama admin
istration's effort to increase the effi
ciency of research.
Bienenstock said that nationwide,
there are currently $2.4 to $4 billion
in non-reimbursed indirect research
costs on government-funded projects
stemming from administrative bur
dens. This amounts to about $l,OOO
per student at Research I and Re
search II universities.

Professor Philippe Buc, chair of
the Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policies, detailed sev
eral items from his committee's work
on electronic devices in the class
room, grade inflation and GERs.

The committee is poised to rec
ommend a ban on electronic devices
during exams, but likely will leave
policy on devices in the classroom up
to individual professors because
compelling arguments for and
against a ban exist.

Grade distribution has come
under scrutiny this year as well. Buc
reported that his committee has been
in dialogue with Princeton Universi
ty, which has successfully brought
down the percentage of A's given to
students in recent years.
Tightening the definition of
GERs and the GER designation
process is also on the agenda.
"If we have GERs, faculty and
students should take them seriously,"
Buc said.
In his report to the Senate,
Provost John Etchemendy com
mented on several issues that have
been sparked interest on campus.
Etchemendy said that Vaden Di
rector Ira Friedman and Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman are coming up with an ex
ceptions policy for the controversial
new requirement that all interna
tional students purchase Cardinal
Care, the University-provided
health insurance plan.
He also complimented the over
seas studies program staff in Santia
go, Chile, where 21 Stanford students
are studying, for their work after last
week's magnitude 8.8 earthquake,
and said that a decision on the status
of the program next quarter will be
announced within several days.
