This Friday and Saturday,
Studio 38 at Roble Gym
will shed light on perform
ers employing a wide and
exploratory range of dance tech
niques. The "Winter Works: New
Choreography in Concert" has on
its agenda both student and facul
ty choreographed pieces ranging
from modern and post-modern
dance to a mix of classical ballet
and contemporary dance. Student
Choreographers include
Katherine Hawthorne 'lO for her
piece "Fell," Ali McKeon 'll for
"Bloom" and "Illuminate," Temo
Peranda 'lO for "Sacred Smoke,"
Samantha Smith-Eppsteiner 'l2
for "Post Secret" and CC Chiu 'l3
for "Push." Faculty pieces encom
pass a nautical experiment of

bodies in "Sea Change," choreo
graphed by Diane Frank, the con
cert director, and a hot fusion of
Jamaican social dance and Aeon
Flux-inspired movements in
"Chocolate Heads," choreo
graphed by Aleta Hayes.
The tech rehearsal this
past Tuesday covered a full
rehearsal for the show in addition
to a play on lighting effects. On
one side of the studio looking
onto the stage sat a number of
performers preparing for their
group pieces, some preparing
their music, others chatting with a
fellow performer as they swung
their legs on a small ballet barre.
Meanwhile, on the other half side
of the studio, tall freestanding
windows lined both sides of the
stage, its dark floor dimly but suf
ficiently lit.
When the rehearsal
began, lights focused on the stage
floor, introducing Ali McKeon's

"Bloom," bringing together her
training in classical ballet and an
interest in the exploration of lyri
cism in her contemporary work.
The dynamic changes and intri
cate patterning reflected melodi
ous parts of her classical training,
as well as fast and athletically
physical movements introduced
by acoustic guitar music with
which McKeon hoped people
could connect.
In another creative mix,
Katherine Hawthorne combined
her interests in physics and dance
in "Fell." She drew inspiration
from principles of gravity and
free fall, as well from her summer
research in the Stanford physics
department into her piece. "My
technical understanding of [free
fall] motivated my work, chal
lenging me to remove assump
tions that we as dancers hold
about verticality and falling,"
Hawthorne said. Further, she
hopes to "problematize the role of
the spectator," just as modern
physics concerns the role of the
observer.
Like McKeon and
Hawthorne, other choreographers
also displayed artistic heft in their
innovative pieces and a desire for
engaging both the performers and
the audience. Temo Peranda fused
post-modern choreography with
Native American dance traditions
and mythology in his "Sacred
Smoke." His sound score included
Mariachi harp, played live.
Samantha Smith-Eppsteiner
explored the art project phenom
enon of "Post Secrets," drawing
inspiration from the Post Secret
project founded by Frank Warren.
CC Chiu, a freshman at
Stanford, said her piece "Push"
was inspired by her relationship
with her brother, who is a gradu
ating senior. "This piece symbol
izes progression and constant
movement," Chiu said, also refer
ring to the representation of how
the two siblings work together.
Impressively synchronized, Chiu's
fast and playful piece represented
a unique dance between brother

and sister.
The compiled works
comprised a mix of fierce, strong,
sometimes rustic, other times
melodious, parts in the both
music and body movements.
Diane Frank, concert director and
dance faculty, commented, "The
choreography this year is unusu
ally strong, not just in the dancing
but in conceptual framework."
While McKeon predicted
a great audience turnout at this
weekend's performances, she also
expressed concern that there may
not be enough seats for everyone.
"Stanford Dance needs a
big enough theater of its own!"

McKeon exclaimed. Sitting near
by, Katherine Disenhof'l2 also
agreed, with both commenting on
how the athletic departments get
far more recognition than
dancers.

"I mean, we can also
jump as high as basketball play
ers," Disenhof said jokingly.
Nonetheless, the per
formance is expected to be strong,

captivating and entertaining,
trumping any space available for
the Stanford dancers.

"This is, by any stan
dard, a concert that pushes the
thresholds in highly engaging and
theatrical ways," Frank added.
