CC Alice in Wonderland" made
me mad as a hatter all right,
and I'm not talking about
being crazy. Expected to do
extremely well at the box office
and highly promoted for months,
"Alice in Wonderland" is far from
wonderful. Tim Burton's movie
interpretation of Lewis Carroll's
classic books, "Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland" and "Through
the Looking-Glass," simply put,
was just bad. I actually went to
the movie with a bit of skepti
cism, fearing that it would suffer
from over-hype, and even though
I had low expectations, the film
was still very disappointing. Not
even Johnny Depp or the 3D visu
als could save it.
The most egregious mis
fortune of the film is its storyline,
which is utterly flat and pre
dictable. It is almost as though
Burton was so focused on the
imagery and graphics (which
aren't even that great) that he for
got to read the books big mis
take. If you are 10 years old, than
this film is probably incredibly
entertaining; but for anyone older,
it completely misses the mark.
Carroll's books were written for
children, but also appeal to adults
because they explore very inter
esting and complicated concepts.
The books deal with themes of
making the impossible possible
and enjoying the freedom and
imagination of youth, both ideas
of which are dealt with in the film
in a ridiculously shallow manner,
if at all.
I realize that the creators
were not trying to mimic the plot
of the books; however, the essence
of the stories was completely lost
in order to dramatize and com
mercialize. Consequently, the
story morphs into a laughable,
epic tale dealing with a group of
eccentrics looking for a hero to
save them from the villain
complete with a fight scene, a
bizarre romance and a dance
sequence (yes, that says dance
sequence). We've seen this plot a
hundred times before, just this
time it includes a girl named
Alice, a Mad Hatter and a Red
Queen.

I don't know if it was
just my pervading disappoint
ment, but the attempted humor
completely missed its mark.
Maybe I didn't get it, but if that's
the case, no one else in the theater
did either there was very little
laughing. They were scenes that
were written to be clever, but were
simply poorly written. The jokes
just didn't translate. All of the
characters, even the Mad Hatter
(who for some unknown reason
had a Scottish accent intermit
tently, traded off with a lisp), were
not absurd enough. It is actually
very unfortunate because this is
Wonderland a loony place
where you can get away with
being foolish and silly. It was

oddly restrained. It's Tim Burton
for god sakes! Give me some
crazy! While Carroll's books are
very zany and illogical, the movie
is almost too methodical and
makes too much sense. I didn't
feel like I escaped to Wonderland,
I felt like I was dragged through
BoringVille.
I could talk about the
terrible screenplay for hours, but
another problem with the movie
is Alice. It could be the actress (a
fresh-faced Mia Wasikowska) or it
could be the way the character is
written (I'd bet on that one), but
either way she is far too passive
and unremarkable. Alice is sup
posed to be a very curious,
inquisitive and intrepid girl, but
in the movie, she is blase and
mellow. Throughout the film,
Alice just goes with flow, barely

showing any emotion, reaction, or
concern. Strangely, she seems apa
thetic, almost like she was given a
tranquilizer for the first half of
the film. I wanted her to have just
a little more vigor.
In this giant mess of ter
rible writing, ordinary characters
and halfhearted enthusiasm,
Helena Bonham Carter shines. I'll

admit, beyond this movie I am
definitely a fan of hers, but as the
Red Queen, she is a standout. She
performs with just the right
amount of dark humor and
annoying tone, with a pinch of
vulnerability, to pull off not only
the best character, but also the
best element the entire film has to
offer. She knows how to do the

crazy I wanted in the rest of the
film.
When it comes to this
last Burton children's story
remake, don't believe the hype.
The downfall of "Alice" is clearly
bad writing, which even the visu
als don't make up for. Although I
want to be entertained and
engaged with effects and visuals, I

also want to my movies to have
substance. Unlike with recent
openers such as "Dear John" or
"Valentine's Day," I was hoping
this movie could take Carroll's
works and create an incredibly
original and intriguing piece.
Instead, it took a classic and
stomped on it, and then adding
insult to injury with a miserable

closing credits song performed by
Avril Lavigne. This Hollywood,
commercialized, Hot Topic-spon
sored mess has absolutely nothing
on the 1951 animated classic.
