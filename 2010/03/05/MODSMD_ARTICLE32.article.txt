# Authentic Salvadoran Food That's Right Around the Corner

While I'd like to pretend
that the subject of this
week's food review is
something I stumbled on through
my own ingenuity, gumption and
love of exploring random parts of
Mountain View, this is actually
the traditional haunt of John
Danforth, my dad. In fact, my
most cherished father-daughter
moments happened over burritos
at the Salvadoran dive Taqueria
La Bamba. While it's conveniently
located around the corner from
Costco and Bed, Bath and
Beyond, La Bamba is so much
more than just the perfect fuel for
a day of blissful suburban big-box
retail shopping.
In the decade that I've

loved La Bamba, it's risen in pop
ularity and correspondingly
grown less dilapidated. Still, the
ambiance is eclectic at best. The
bright yellow exterior is festooned
with colorful murals and painted
cursive letters imploring passers
by to "Experience the La Bamba
Difference!" Inside, another mural
depicting a peasant-y Salvadoran
street scene shares the stage with a
changing cast of truly atrocious
art pieces. My personal favorite is
a gaudily framed mirror embla
zoned with a picture of a waterfall
and softly lit from behind.
Mariachi music and the cacopho
nous metallic-sounding theme
songs of several pinball machines
greet patrons. And while there

used to be a few small tables scat
tered helter-skelter throughout
the small space, the city of
Mountain View recently declared
this setup in violation of fire
codes. So now you can only sit
along plastic counters that line
the taqueria's periphery, which
can make for a communal (and
thus awkward) dining experience.
But you go to La Bamba
for the food, not the ambiance.
And the food is damn good. What
La Bamba specifically makes best
constitutes a fundamental point
of contention in the Danforth
family, but several items cannot
be missed. In terms of the basics,
La Bamba's blissfully simple
grilled chicken is perfectly tender
and flavorful. I like to get the
grilled chicken tacos, served on
freshly made corn tortillas and
topped with really good (but
spicy!) salsa, chopped onions and
cilantro; but my big brother
swears by the grilled chicken bur
rito. La Bamba also makes incred
ible carnitas, slow-cooked pork
whose wonderfully crispy outside
gives way to the perfectly sea
soned, succulent interior. Again, I
like the carnitas in tacos, but it
also works great as a burrito fill
ing.
But La Bamba isn't your
typical taqueria. The food is actu

ally Salvadoran, which means they
have certain uncommon regional
specialties, the most notable of
them being the pupusa. No one
I've ever talked to frantically
about the glory of La Bamba
pupusas (and there have been
many) understands that I'm not
talking about papooses, the
Algonquian word for an infant
child. So as a primer, a pupusa is a
deep-fried, extra thick corn tor
tilla stuffed with cheese and
shredded pork and served on a
bed of cabbage and carrot salad.
The pupusas at La Bamba are pip
ing hot, delicious and just plain
addictive only don't think
about how it's all going straight to
your hips.

In conclusion, La Bamba is
the greatest (definitely the best
thing Mountain View has
going for it). It's cheap, uses fresh
ingredients and is just so tasty.
When I think of happiness, I
think of washing down their
pupusas with cinnamon-laced
horchata. Everyone should go,
preferably for every meal
unless you're on a diet or taking a
snooty foreign dignitary on a
high-stakes first date.
