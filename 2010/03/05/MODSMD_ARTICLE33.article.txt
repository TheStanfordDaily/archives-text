While it may just be Intermission that is fiercely invested in the
Oscar race, we thought that we would at least give the readers
something to take with them to Vegas. Not to brag, but
Intermission is notoriously spot-on with their Oscar predictions, so regard
less of whether or not you have seen these movies, you can be almost cer
tain who is going to take home those coveted gold statues. Ignoring some
of the more obscure categories, we are going to give you the low-down on
who was nominated and who will be up on the stage, giving those speeches
of thanks.

BEST ACTRESS
Sandra Bullock, "The Blind Side"
Helen Mirren, "The Last Station"
Carey Mulligan, "An Education"
Gabourey Sidibe, "Precious"
Meryl Streep, "Julie & Julia"

Who will win: Sandra Bullock, "The Blind Side"
As much as we absolutely hate to admit it, Sandra Bullock (forever Ms.
Congeniality to us) will take home the Oscar on Sunday night. Absolutely
hating "The Blind Side," this prediction is tough to make, as we feel that
every other nominee deserves the award over Bullock's bad wig, Palin-esque
humor and painfully predictable performance. But for some reason, audi
ences and critics loved her. For those of you who have yet to see "An
Education," you will be captivated and will truly identify with Carey
Mulligan, playing a fresh-faced, clever high school student who derails her
Oxford dreams to live an exciting, cosmopolitan lifestyle. Gabourey Sidibe,
another newcomer, breaks hearts as the übiquitous Precious, a girl who has
faced what seems to be every single adversity one could think up. Meryl
Streep is brilliant in everything that she does, of course, and her turn as
Julia Child is no exception. Sadly, Bullock will probably prevail, and most
people (but not Intermission!) will be happy about it.

BEST ACTOR

Jeff Bridges, "Crazy Heart"
George Clooney, "Up in the Air"
Colin Firth, "A Single Man"
Morgan Freeman, "Invictus"
Jeremy Renner, "The Hurt Locker"
Who will win: Jeff Bridges, "Crazy Heart"
The nominees for Best Actor this year represent a wide range of characters
a bomb expert in Iraq, a gay professor in the 19605, a businessman that
fires people for a living, an aging country star and Nelson Mandela. While
all are relevant and have the potential to take home the award, Jeff Bridges
gives a career-defining performance as Bad Blake, the fading musician
who's impossible romance with a young woman forces him to reassess his
life. This year is a tough race for these five men, as they all (with the excep
tion of maybe Morgan Freeman) pour their heart and souls into what
many consider to be their best work yet. The unknown Renner's explosion
onto the scene in "The Hurt Locker" gave viewers a realistic and compelling
portrayal of a soldier, while George Clooney masterfully mixed his signa
ture charm and wit with a vulnerability and sadness we had yet to see from
him. But even after a tough race, the Dude still abides.

BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS

Penelope Cruz, "Nine"
Vera Farmiga, "Up in the Air"
Maggie Gyllenhaal, "Crazy Heart"
Anna Kendrick, "Up in the Air"
Mo'Nique, "Precious: based on the novel "Push" by Sapphire"
Who will win: Mo'Nique, "Precious: based on the novel "Push" by
Sapphire"
Cleaning up so far at awards shows for the past few months, Mo'Nique has
come a long way from hosting "Charm School" on VHI and doing
straight-to-DVD films. Her turn as the abusive, disturbed, hateful mother
of the title character is the standout role in this critically acclaimed film.
Audiences there to see Mariah Carey and to support Oprah were shocked
by Mo'Nique's performance, which was one of the most convincing and
moving roles in recent memory. While most of the other nominees deserve
their place on this list (does Penelope Cruz get nominated just for existing
now?), none hold a candle to Mo'Nique this year.

BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR

Matt Damon, "Invictus"
Woody Harrelson, "The Messenger"
Christopher Plummer, "The Last Station"
Stanley Tucci, "The Lovely Bones"
Christoph Waltz, "Inglourious Basterds"
Who will win: Christoph Waltz, "Inglourious Basterds"
This award further proves that those nominated for supporting roles were
really the standouts on the silver screen this year. Christoph Waltz shone as
Colonel Hans Landa, the Nazi military man that was woven throughout the
multiple storylines of this Tarantino fairytale. He was all at once creepy,
funny, endearing, but mostly horrifying captured within the first 10
minutes of the film. His acting was powerful in multiple languages, some
thing the American cinema very rarely sees. Hailing from Vienna, Waltz has
starred almost exclusively in European films, but with his breakout role in
"Basterds," he is already lined up for the much-anticipated "Green Hornet."

BEST ANIMATED FILM

"Coraline"
"Fantastic Mr. Fox"
"The Princess and the Frog"
"The Secret of Kells"
"Up"
Who will win: "Up"

This pick is obvious, but we thought it shouldn't go ignored. While "Up" is
nominated for Best Picture, an absolute achievement in its own right, it
doesn't have a chance of taking that title. Instead, the Academy will award it
with this one, which is not a shocker whenever there is a Pixar film in
the category, it wins.

BEST DIRECTOR

Kathryn Bigelow, "The Hurt Locker"
James Cameron, "Avatar"
Lee Daniels, "Precious: based on the novel "Push" by Sapphire"
Jason Reitman, "Up in the Air"
Quentin Tarantino, "Inglourious Basterds"
Who will win: Kathryn Bigelow, "The Hurt Locker"
In what Intermission expects to be the most poignant award of the night,
Kathryn Bigelow will further shatter the glass ceiling for women by becom
ing the first female to ever win the Oscar for Best Director. However, gen
der aside, whoever directed the masterpiece that is "The Hurt Locker,"
deserves to win the award. The direction of this movie is so deliberate and
nuanced that it creates a film that many would argue is near perfect. The
close runner-up for this category is obviously James Cameron (who is inci
dentally Bigelow's ex-husband), but most believe that the Academy will
make this David and Goliath story true to form, and award the low-budget,
under-hyped choice over the massive blockbuster (which is also brilliant in
its own right). Unlike the last time Cameron was nominated, we believe
that this Sunday, Bigelow will be "queen of the world!"

BEST PICTURE

"Avatar"
"The Blind Side"
"District 9"
"An Education"
"The Hurt Locker"
"Inglourious Basterds"
"Precious: based on the novel "Push" by Sapphire"
"A Serious Man"
"Up"
"Up in the Air"
Who will win: "The Hurt Locker"

In an effort to encourage wider audiences and a deeper connection from
the average moviegoer with the Oscars, the Academy doubled the nominee
pool for this award, making the competition the fiercest that it has ever
been. With the exception of "The Blind Side," every one of these films is a
masterpiece. Science fiction burst onto the scene with "District 9" and
"Avatar," while more traditional character pieces like "A Serious Man" and
"An Education" are represented. However, the race between "Avatar" and
"The Hurt Locker" will be decided once and for all. While "Avatar" has
changed the future of cinema and definitely won the box office wars (the
highest grossing film of all time!), this award goes to "The Hurt Locker" for
being a timely, beautiful, realistic, spellbinding and exhilarting film that not
only expertly portrays the war in Iraq, but also is a shining example of what
a film should look like.

another newcomer, breaks hearts as the übiquitous Precious, a girl who has
faced what seems to be every single adversity one could think up. Meryl
Streep is brilliant in everything that she does, of course, and her turn as
Julia Child is no exception. Sadly, Bullock will probably prevail, and most
people (but not Intermission!) will be happy about it.

BEST ACTOR

Jeff Bridges, "Crazy Heart"
George Clooney, "Up in the Air"
Colin Firth, "A Single Man"
Morgan Freeman, "Invictus"
Jeremy Renner, "The Hurt Locker"
Who will win: Jeff Bridges, "Crazy Heart"
The nominees for Best Actor this year represent a wide range of characters
a bomb expert in Iraq, a gay professor in the 19605, a businessman that
fires people for a living, an aging country star and Nelson Mandela. While
all are relevant and have the potential to take home the award, Jeff Bridges
gives a career-defining performance as Bad Blake, the fading musician
who's impossible romance with a young woman forces him to reassess his
life. This year is a tough race for these five men, as they all (with the excep
tion of maybe Morgan Freeman) pour their heart and souls into what
many consider to be their best work yet. The unknown Renner's explosion
onto the scene in "The Hurt Locker" gave viewers a realistic and compelling
portrayal of a soldier, while George Clooney masterfully mixed his signa
ture charm and wit with a vulnerability and sadness we had yet to see from
him. But even after a tough race, the Dude still abides.

BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS

Penelope Cruz, "Nine"
Vera Farmiga, "Up in the Air"
Maggie Gyllenhaal, "Crazy Heart"
Anna Kendrick, "Up in the Air"
Mo'Nique, "Precious: based on the novel "Push" by Sapphire"
Who will win: Mo'Nique, "Precious: based on the novel "Push" by
Sapphire"
Cleaning up so far at awards shows for the past few months, Mo'Nique has
come a long way from hosting "Charm School" on VHI and doing
straight-to-DVD films. Her turn as the abusive, disturbed, hateful mother
of the title character is the standout role in this critically acclaimed film.
Audiences there to see Mariah Carey and to support Oprah were shocked
by Mo'Nique's performance, which was one of the most convincing and
moving roles in recent memory. While most of the other nominees deserve
their place on this list (does Penelope Cruz get nominated just for existing
now?), none hold a candle to Mo'Nique this year.

BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR

Matt Damon, "Invictus"
Woody Harrelson, "The Messenger"
Christopher Plummer, "The Last Station"
Stanley Tucci, "The Lovely Bones"
Christoph Waltz, "Inglourious Basterds"
Who will win: Christoph Waltz, "Inglourious Basterds"
This award further proves that those nominated for supporting roles were
really the standouts on the silver screen this year. Christoph Waltz shone as
Colonel Hans Landa, the Nazi military man that was woven throughout the
multiple storylines of this Tarantino fairytale. He was all at once creepy,
funny, endearing, but mostly horrifying captured within the first 10
minutes of the film. His acting was powerful in multiple languages, some
thing the American cinema very rarely sees. Hailing from Vienna, Waltz has
starred almost exclusively in European films, but with his breakout role in
"Basterds," he is already lined up for the much-anticipated "Green Hornet."

BEST ANIMATED FILM

"Coraline"
"Fantastic Mr. Fox"
"The Princess and the Frog"
"The Secret of Kells"
"Up"
Who will win: "Up"

This pick is obvious, but we thought it shouldn't go ignored. While "Up" is
nominated for Best Picture, an absolute achievement in its own right, it
doesn't have a chance of taking that title. Instead, the Academy will award it
with this one, which is not a shocker whenever there is a Pixar film in
the category, it wins.

BEST DIRECTOR

Kathryn Bigelow, "The Hurt Locker"
James Cameron, "Avatar"
Lee Daniels, "Precious: based on the novel "Push" by Sapphire"
Jason Reitman, "Up in the Air"
Quentin Tarantino, "Inglourious Basterds"
Who will win: Kathryn Bigelow, "The Hurt Locker"
In what Intermission expects to be the most poignant award of the night,
Kathryn Bigelow will further shatter the glass ceiling for women by becom
ing the first female to ever win the Oscar for Best Director. However, gen
der aside, whoever directed the masterpiece that is "The Hurt Locker,"
deserves to win the award. The direction of this movie is so deliberate and
nuanced that it creates a film that many would argue is near perfect. The
close runner-up for this category is obviously James Cameron (who is inci
dentally Bigelow's ex-husband), but most believe that the Academy will
make this David and Goliath story true to form, and award the low-budget,
under-hyped choice over the massive blockbuster (which is also brilliant in
its own right). Unlike the last time Cameron was nominated, we believe
that this Sunday, Bigelow will be "queen of the world!"

BEST PICTURE

"Avatar"
"The Blind Side"
"District 9"
"An Education"
"The Hurt Locker"
"Inglourious Basterds"
"Precious: based on the novel "Push" by Sapphire"
"A Serious Man"
"Up"
"Up in the Air"
Who will win: "The Hurt Locker"

In an effort to encourage wider audiences and a deeper connection from
the average moviegoer with the Oscars, the Academy doubled the nominee
pool for this award, making the competition the fiercest that it has ever
been. With the exception of "The Blind Side," every one of these films is a
masterpiece. Science fiction burst onto the scene with "District 9" and
"Avatar," while more traditional character pieces like "A Serious Man" and
"An Education" are represented. However, the race between "Avatar" and
"The Hurt Locker" will be decided once and for all. While "Avatar" has
changed the future of cinema and definitely won the box office wars (the
highest grossing film of all time!), this award goes to "The Hurt Locker" for
being a timely, beautiful, realistic, spellbinding and exhilarting film that not
only expertly portrays the war in Iraq, but also is a shining example of what
a film should look like.








While it may just be Intermission that is fiercely invested in the
Oscar race, we thought that we would at least give the readers
something to take with them to Vegas. Not to brag, but
Intermission is notoriously spot-on with their Oscar predictions, so regard
less of whether or not you have seen these movies, you can be almost cer
tain who is going to take home those coveted gold statues. Ignoring some
of the more obscure categories, we are going to give you the low-down on
who was nominated and who will be up on the stage, giving those speeches
of thanks.

BEST ACTRESS
Sandra Bullock, "The Blind Side"
Helen Mirren, "The Last Station"
Carey Mulligan, "An Education"
Gabourey Sidibe, "Precious"
Meryl Streep, "Julie & Julia"

Who will win: Sandra Bullock, "The Blind Side"
As much as we absolutely hate to admit it, Sandra Bullock (forever Ms.
Congeniality to us) will take home the Oscar on Sunday night. Absolutely
hating "The Blind Side," this prediction is tough to make, as we feel that
every other nominee deserves the award over Bullock's bad wig, Palin-esque
humor and painfully predictable performance. But for some reason, audi
ences and critics loved her. For those of you who have yet to see "An
Education," you will be captivated and will truly identify with Carey
Mulligan, playing a fresh-faced, clever high school student who derails her
Oxford dreams to live an exciting, cosmopolitan lifestyle. Gabourey Sidibe,
another newcomer, breaks hearts as the übiquitous Precious, a girl who has
faced what seems to be every single adversity one could think up. Meryl
Streep is brilliant in everything that she does, of course, and her turn as
Julia Child is no exception. Sadly, Bullock will probably prevail, and most
people (but not Intermission!) will be happy about it.
