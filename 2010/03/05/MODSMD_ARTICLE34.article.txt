As the 82nd Annual Academy
Awards and its famous red carpet
roll around this Sunday (March
7), Intermission has compiled some of
the best and worst Oscar looks of the
past several years to help give you
some perspective when judging
this year's attire.
BEST
Jennifer Garner, 2004
Valentino
In 2004, Jennifer Garner turned heads
when she sauntered down the red carpet in this
vintage goddess gown. It took 15 yards of taffe
ta, countless more yards of chiffon and over
300 hours of work from four couturiers to
produce this exquisite, fiery orange cre
ation from Valentino. The work certainly
paid off. While vintage, the one-shoul
dered Valentino fit Garner like a glove.
The "Electra" actress kept the rest of
her appearance uncomplicated with a
simple banged up-do and natural,
peach-hued makeup that comple
mented her entire look.
Reese Witherspoon, 2007 Nina
Ricci
In 2007, Reese Witherspoon
was still coping with the dissolu
tion of her seven-year marriage to
Ryan Phillipe. What better way
to make your ex eat his
V heart out than with this
▲ stunning, beautifully tinted
Nina Ricci gown? The per
feet fit, graduated deep
amethyst and gentle waves were the

perfect combination of subtle elegance. Witherspoon topped off the look
with soft, natural make up and let down her blonde locks to contrast with
the darker tone of her dress. Her chic, relaxed-glamour look was a far cry
from the vintage Southern belle Dior gown she wore the previous year,
when she won Best Lead Actress for "Walk the Line." For Witherspoon,
this Nina Ricci design was the ideal capper of a flawless red carpet season.
Michelle Williams, 2006 Vera Wang
Mustard yellow is not an easy color to pull off. Of all the pretty,
sweeping romantic gowns of 2006, Michelle Williams one-upped them all
with the bold hue of her sophisticated Vera Wang. She was a splash of
color among the sea of the more neutral, muted shades of her peers.
Confidently strutting the red carpet with then-paramour Heath Ledger,
Williams left no doubt in anyone's minds that her "Dawson's Creek" days

were far in the past. The "Brokeback
Mountain" actress was here to stay.
RUNNER UP
Anne Hathaway, 2009 Armani Priveskirt
Although still a relative newcomer
to the red carpet, Anne Hathaway is
quickly sealing her status as a fashion
icon with gorgeous turns like this ster
ling number she wore to last year's
Oscars, where she received her first
nomination for Best Lead Actress in
"Rachel Getting Married." The daz
zling sparkle and fit of her dress, as j
well as her classy chignon, make
us excited for what Hathaway
pulls next.
WORST
Gwyneth Paltrow, 1999 Ralph
Lauren
The dress is not necessarily ugly.
However, the Oscars are all about the
glitz and glamour. People tune in to ogle
extravagant dresses they can only dream
of, not to see a cheap Pepto-Bismol confec
tion they could easily see on a rack at
Macy's or at any generic high school prom
in the country. On top of that, Paltrow
could have at least gotten a prom dress
that wasn't so ill fitting. With all the
extra saggy space in the bosom,
Paltrow could have stuffed it with
the Oscar she won that night for
Best Lead Actress in "Shakespeare i
in Love."
Tilda Swinton, 2008 Lanvin
Sure Tilda Swinton's black

Lanvin contraption was supposed to be an avant-garde, fashion-forward
choice. Maybe it was too fashion-forward for the masses, but really now,
did she just stop by a dumpster on her way to the Oscars to pick up this
shapeless, garbage bag? Neither her black attire nor blistering red hair was
particularly flattering with her pale complexion. She looked like the alien
cousin of Oscar the Grouch. The only thing more painful than this look
was her tribute later that night to George Clooney's nipples during her
acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actress in "Michael Clayton."
ON THE FENCE
Bjork, 2001 Marjan Pejoski
You know this dress. The infamous swan dress Bjork wore to the 2001
Oscars. It's impossible to forget, and therein lays its brilliance. The Marjan
Pejoski creation has become a fixture in the pop culture consciousness
after being spoofed in countless comedy sketches and Halloween cos
tumes. Is it a clever subversion of Oscar's tradition of lavish glamour or
simply the most horrid feathered monstrosity to ever waddle down the
Kodak Theater's hallowed red carpet? You decide.
