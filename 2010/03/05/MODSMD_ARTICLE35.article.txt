# Parenthood: 99 Problems, But a Family Ain't One

The 2009 fall television sea
son and the sitcom form
were reinvigorated by
ABC's "Modern Family," which
follows three distinct family units
and intertwines them in a net
work of siblings and parents.
What works so well in "Modern
Family" is that humor exaggerates
the norm of the family sitcom
"Everybody Loves Raymond,"
"Malcolm in the Middle," "8
Simple Rules," "According to Jim"
to comment upon the fluid
definition of family and the true
nature of love (cue the aww).
Quirky humor brings the audi
ence closer to the characters of
"Modern Family." By laughing at
them for their absurdity and rec
ognizing that we don't know any
one that absurd, we have to seek
our commonality with the char
acter. That quest for empathy
invests the viewer in the show by
unknowingly engaging him or her
in a quest for the deeper meaning

of a light, sometimes trite, half
hour comedy.
Where comedy draws you in,
drama encourages the viewer to
draw back and appreciate the
rawness of the character and the
virtuoso performance of the
actor. It is my opinion that the
device of audience identification
fails when applied to a dramatic
moment or performance on TV.
When an episode is written such
that the audience is intended to
identify with a character's struggle
or breakdown, inevitably the
screen representation will alienate
the viewer. Moments of vulnera
bility are difficult to project one
self onto because the vulnerability
and breakdowns are so personal.
As a result of our powerful emo
tional and physical memories
from our own breakdowns, we
pull ourselves away from the
character by nitpicking: when I
fight with my mom, it was like
this; when my husband left me, I

felt like this; when I found out my
son had autism, I cried, etc. For
the writers of a TV show, then,
the task of depicting dramatic
disappointments and failures on
screen relies on the strength of
the writing and the authenticity
of the acting. If these are accom
plished, the audience reacts not
with, "That's exactly how I feel!"
but with, "I believe that that is
how she feels, and I sympathize
with her."
This is the failure of NBC's
new family drama, "Parenthood."
I didn't hate the pilot for sure, but
I walked away from it feeling apa
thetic. I now realize that the mul
titude of characters two par
ents, their four children, each
child's significant other(s) and
their children weighs down the
script with excessive breakdowns,
epiphanies and fights. I believe
that an ensemble show thrives
with the development of the
worlds of the individual charac
ters (although many critics dis
agree with this point on "Modern
Family" and prefer to see the
three units united in an episode).
In "Parenthood," this devel
opment exists briefly and intense
ly in each character's breakdown
moment Lauren Graham cry
ing on a date, Peter Krause and
his wife crying about their son's
Asperger's diagnosis, Erika
Christensen crying about her
daughter's seeming punishment
of her for her law career, and Dax
Shepard stressing about his girl
friend's biological clock and his
ex-girlfriend's surprise. It's a lot to
digest in less than an hour, and it
forces you to throw pity at the
characters, not get to know them.
Ron Howard, the producer of the
show and the director of the orig
inal 1989 film, describes the cen
tral tenet of the show as the idea
that, "There's nothing funnier
than watching people go through
the pain that you're feeling." For
me, this is problematic in that the
show is funny in the way that
Seinfeld is funny when he's yelling
in his characteristic voice and in
that Howard is that implying this
is a show targeted for the parent
demographic. If the show is very
subtly trying to wink at its parent
audience, I'm lost because, well,

I've never pumped a child out of
my nether region.
As a "child" viewer, I'm also
frustrated by the role of the chil
dren in the pilot. They are over
simplified to simultaneous prob
lems and prophets: Mae
Whitman, who plays Lauren
Graham's daughter, gets arrested
for smoking pot, but then tells her
mom how to dress for a date.
Erika Christensen's daughter's
only role is to reject her mother,
suggesting that this show will be
about never understanding the
kids and watching the parents
cope. Most frustrating, yet prom
ising, is Peter Krause's character's
son, who is diagnosed with
Asperger's halfway through the
episode. The representation of
Asperger's is subtle, and one of
my favorite moments in the pilot
came from watching him jump
into a puddle without rain cloth
ing. Those moments of artistry
and ambiance will save the show;

however, this boy also awkwardly
plays a kind of "Tiny Tim" char
acter in that he unites the whole
family and, by virtue of his disor
der, argues to the viewers that,
"Parenting takes a village." I think
the converse, that parenting is
what happens when you're alone
with your kid, not when you're
consulting your brother about
how to parent, is the more com
pelling one.
"Parenthood" may be the life
raft its parent network, NBC, has
been waiting for, but I hope that
the show finds a better format
than congregations at the grand
parents' Berkeley hippie mansion
to create the family.

the pain that you're feeling." For
me, this is problematic in that the
show is funny in the way that
Seinfeld is funny when he's yelling
in his characteristic voice and in
that Howard is that implying this
is a show targeted for the parent
demographic. If the show is very
subtly trying to wink at its parent
audience, I'm lost because, well,

I've never pumped a child out of
my nether region.
As a "child" viewer, I'm also
frustrated by the role of the chil
dren in the pilot. They are over
simplified to simultaneous prob
lems and prophets: Mae
Whitman, who plays Lauren
Graham's daughter, gets arrested
for smoking pot, but then tells her
mom how to dress for a date.
Erika Christensen's daughter's
only role is to reject her mother,
suggesting that this show will be
about never understanding the
kids and watching the parents
cope. Most frustrating, yet prom
ising, is Peter Krause's character's
son, who is diagnosed with
Asperger's halfway through the
episode. The representation of
Asperger's is subtle, and one of
my favorite moments in the pilot
came from watching him jump
into a puddle without rain cloth
ing. Those moments of artistry
and ambiance will save the show;

however, this boy also awkwardly
plays a kind of "Tiny Tim" char
acter in that he unites the whole
family and, by virtue of his disor
der, argues to the viewers that,
"Parenting takes a village." I think
the converse, that parenting is
what happens when you're alone
with your kid, not when you're
consulting your brother about
how to parent, is the more com
pelling one.
"Parenthood" may be the life
raft its parent network, NBC, has
been waiting for, but I hope that
the show finds a better format
than congregations at the grand
parents' Berkeley hippie mansion
to create the family.
