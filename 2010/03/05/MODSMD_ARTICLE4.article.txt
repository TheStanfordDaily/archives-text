# PLAYOFF PUSH
## Tournament seed at stake for Card 
### HALEY MURPHY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Saturday marks Senior Day for
the five seniors on Stanford's bas
ketball roster, but senior standout
Landry Fields insists, "Fm just look
ing at it as another game."
Fields may be playing it cool, but
the weekend match-up with cross-
Bay rival and the Pac-10's top
team California is more signifi
cant than he lets on.

First and foremost, as the final
game of conference play for both
teams, it will heavily influence the
postseason for the whole confer
ence. The Bears (20-9,12-5 Pac-10)
probably need a win to secure the
conference title outright (assuming
Arizona State can handle UCLA).
And Stanford (13-16, 7-10 Pac-10)
needs a win to avoid the play-in
game for the Pac-10 Tournament.
As a veteran of tournament play
and the player averaging the most
minutes in the conference (36.10 a
game), Fields hopes the already
shallow Cardinal roster can avoid
any extra play.
"Given our personnel and the
minutes guys are giving, it would be
beneficial for us to play [fewer]
games," Fields said. "It would be big
for us to have to win three games to
win it all instead of four."

But to win any games in the con
ference tourney in L.A., the team,
which has often struggled on the
road, needs all the momentum it can
muster coming out of Saturday.
Senior guard Drew Shiller
knows it.

"We know that going into the
Pac-10 Tournament, any team could
get hot," Shiller said, "and that team
could be us. But, building that mo
mentum definitely starts Saturday."
Head coach Johnny Dawkins,
though, notes that regardless of the
postseason implications, the game
holds other significance.

"We absolutely realize the im
portance of this game," Dawkins
said. "One, we're playing rivals, so
it's always an important game, and
the guys are going to compete at a
high level. Two, we still want to get
as many wins as possible. So, I think
it takes on a huge meaning for us,
and it has a huge meaning for
them."

TOURNAMENT

3/10-3/13 Los Angeles, Calif.

NOTES ! Stanford's final regular season game will
pit the Card, which currently sits eighth in the Pac
-10 standings, against conference leader Califor
nia. Stanford needs a win to stay out of the Pac
-10 Tournament's play-in game, while the Golden
Bears will secure the top seed in the tournament
with a victory. For Stanford senior forward Landry
Fields, his candidacy for conference Player of the
Year may ride on his team's performance in to
morrow's game—without a victory, it is unlikely
that Fields will win the award despite leading the
Pac-10 in numerous statistical categories.

are a few individuals for whom the
game could also have huge meaning.
The first is Fields. He ranks in the
conference's top 10 in seven statisti
cal categories, including scoring (first
with 22.1 points per game), rebound
ing (second with 8.6 per game), steals
(fourth with 1.66 per game) and
blocked shots (10th with .79 per
game). If he sounds like a conference
Player of the Year candidate, you're
right with the one blemish on his
resume being the team's overall
standings.
A win on Saturday still makes him
an iffy candidate; a loss makes him a
no-go.
"I think you can make an argu
ment for Landry [as Player of the
Year] because there's so much parity
in our conference," Dawkins said.
"Typically, I'm an advocate of 'to the
victor go the spoils.' Teams that do
the best, their players should be hon
ored ... but whenever [there is] this
much parity, where no one's really
run away with the conference cham
pionship, then you have to really look
at players from every team and make

a determination of who's the best
player. For us, he's been a do-every
thing guy ... he's carried a heavy
load."

Contrastingly, for anyone who
wants to honor a player from strictly
the conference's best team, Cal's sen
ior guard Jerome Randle (18.9 ppg,
4.52 assists per game) might be your
guy if the Bears stomp on Stanford,
like they did back in January.

Randle went 8-11 to notch 24 of
the painful points that led to Stan
ford's crushing 92-66 defeat.

But there were four Bears in dou
ble digits that day Randle and for
wards Theo Robertson, Max Zhang
and Omondi Amoke compared to
two Cardinal players in Fields and
sophomore Jeremy Green, who com
bined for 43 points.

Given that two months and the
entirety of Pac-10 play have since
passed, Dawkins is optimistic that
history won't repeat itself.
"We played them the very first
game of the Pac-10 season," Dawkins
said. "Since then, they've evolved,
and we have too, so I don't think we
can do the same things we did in that
game. And I don't think they will ei
ther."

What the Cardinal can expect,
though, is the same breadth of scor
ing and a daunting challenge on both

ends of the floor.

"They're very efficient offensive
ly," Dawkins noted. "You're digging a
hole if you're not keeping pace
through the looks that you're getting.
They have four guys all capable of
scoring in the 20s ... They're capa
ble, and they're so explosive offen
sively, it just takes a run or two for
them, and they could knock you out."
But, Shiller says Stanford is
"much more confident" than it was
during its first Cal encounter, and
thinks a victory is within reach.
"I think we're a more together
team," Shiller said. "We've kind of
figured out our identity and what we
need to do to win, so hopefully, we
can execute that on Saturday."
Fields agrees, noting that much of
Saturday's result will depend on the
parts of the game that Stanford can
control.

"They're a strong group, and it's
going to be hard," Fields said. "We
need to minimize our mistakes, be
cause playing a team like Cal, they'll
capitalize on them."

Fields and Shiller will take to the
floor at Maples for the last time to
prove just how much they've learned
on the Farm. Tip-off is at 3 p.m.

beneficial for us to play [fewer]
games," Fields said. "It would be big
for us to have to win three games to
win it all instead of four."

But to win any games in the con
ference tourney in L.A., the team,
which has often struggled on the
road, needs all the momentum it can
muster coming out of Saturday.
Senior guard Drew Shiller
knows it.

"We know that going into the
Pac-10 Tournament, any team could
get hot," Shiller said, "and that team
could be us. But, building that mo
mentum definitely starts Saturday."
Head coach Johnny Dawkins,
though, notes that regardless of the
postseason implications, the game
holds other significance.

"We absolutely realize the im
portance of this game," Dawkins
said. "One, we're playing rivals, so
it's always an important game, and
the guys are going to compete at a
high level. Two, we still want to get
as many wins as possible. So, I think
it takes on a huge meaning for us,
and it has a huge meaning for
them."

PAC-10

TOURNAMENT

3/10-3/13 Los Angeles, Calif.

NOTES ! Stanford's final regular season game will
pit the Card, which currently sits eighth in the Pac
-10 standings, against conference leader Califor
nia. Stanford needs a win to stay out of the Pac
-10 Tournament's play-in game, while the Golden
Bears will secure the top seed in the tournament
with a victory. For Stanford senior forward Landry
Fields, his candidacy for conference Player of the
Year may ride on his team's performance in to
morrow's game—without a victory, it is unlikely
that Fields will win the award despite leading the
Pac-10 in numerous statistical categories.

are a few individuals for whom the
game could also have huge meaning.
The first is Fields. He ranks in the
conference's top 10 in seven statisti
cal categories, including scoring (first
with 22.1 points per game), rebound
ing (second with 8.6 per game), steals
(fourth with 1.66 per game) and
blocked shots (10th with .79 per
game). If he sounds like a conference
Player of the Year candidate, you're
right with the one blemish on his
resume being the team's overall
standings.
A win on Saturday still makes him
an iffy candidate; a loss makes him a
no-go.
"I think you can make an argu
ment for Landry [as Player of the
Year] because there's so much parity
in our conference," Dawkins said.
"Typically, I'm an advocate of 'to the
victor go the spoils.' Teams that do
the best, their players should be hon
ored ... but whenever [there is] this
much parity, where no one's really
run away with the conference cham
pionship, then you have to really look
at players from every team and make

a determination of who's the best
player. For us, he's been a do-every
thing guy ... he's carried a heavy
load."

Contrastingly, for anyone who
wants to honor a player from strictly
the conference's best team, Cal's sen
ior guard Jerome Randle (18.9 ppg,
4.52 assists per game) might be your
guy if the Bears stomp on Stanford,
like they did back in January.

Randle went 8-11 to notch 24 of
the painful points that led to Stan
ford's crushing 92-66 defeat.

But there were four Bears in dou
ble digits that day Randle and for
wards Theo Robertson, Max Zhang
and Omondi Amoke compared to
two Cardinal players in Fields and
sophomore Jeremy Green, who com
bined for 43 points.

Given that two months and the
entirety of Pac-10 play have since
passed, Dawkins is optimistic that
history won't repeat itself.
"We played them the very first
game of the Pac-10 season," Dawkins
said. "Since then, they've evolved,
and we have too, so I don't think we
can do the same things we did in that
game. And I don't think they will ei
ther."

What the Cardinal can expect,
though, is the same breadth of scor
ing and a daunting challenge on both

ends of the floor.

"They're very efficient offensive
ly," Dawkins noted. "You're digging a
hole if you're not keeping pace
through the looks that you're getting.
They have four guys all capable of
scoring in the 20s ... They're capa
ble, and they're so explosive offen
sively, it just takes a run or two for
them, and they could knock you out."
But, Shiller says Stanford is
"much more confident" than it was
during its first Cal encounter, and
thinks a victory is within reach.
"I think we're a more together
team," Shiller said. "We've kind of
figured out our identity and what we
need to do to win, so hopefully, we
can execute that on Saturday."
Fields agrees, noting that much of
Saturday's result will depend on the
parts of the game that Stanford can
control.

"They're a strong group, and it's
going to be hard," Fields said. "We
need to minimize our mistakes, be
cause playing a team like Cal, they'll
capitalize on them."

Fields and Shiller will take to the
floor at Maples for the last time to
prove just how much they've learned
on the Farm. Tip-off is at 3 p.m.

Seniors Kawika Shoji (12) and Garrett Werner (14) will look to keep Stanford in the thick of the MPSF title race. While
Stanford is currently ranked No. 2 in the nation, No. 1 Pepperdine is also in the conference and leads the MPSF.
Saturday marks Senior Day for
the five seniors on Stanford's bas
ketball roster, but senior standout
Landry Fields insists, "Fm just look
ing at it as another game."
Fields may be playing it cool, but
the weekend match-up with cross-
Bay rival and the Pac-10's top
team California is more signifi
cant than he lets on.

First and foremost, as the final
game of conference play for both
teams, it will heavily influence the
postseason for the whole confer
ence. The Bears (20-9,12-5 Pac-10)
probably need a win to secure the
conference title outright (assuming
Arizona State can handle UCLA).
And Stanford (13-16, 7-10 Pac-10)
needs a win to avoid the play-in
game for the Pac-10 Tournament.
As a veteran of tournament play
and the player averaging the most
minutes in the conference (36.10 a
game), Fields hopes the already
shallow Cardinal roster can avoid
any extra play.
"Given our personnel and the
minutes guys are giving, it would be
beneficial for us to play [fewer]
games," Fields said. "It would be big
for us to have to win three games to
win it all instead of four."

But to win any games in the con
