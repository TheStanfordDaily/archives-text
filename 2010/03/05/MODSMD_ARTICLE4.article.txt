## Tournament seed at stake for Card 
### HALEY MURPHY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Saturday marks Senior Day for
the five seniors on Stanford's bas
ketball roster, but senior standout
Landry Fields insists, "Fm just look
ing at it as another game."
Fields may be playing it cool, but
the weekend match-up with cross-
Bay rival and the Pac-10's top
team California is more signifi
cant than he lets on.

First and foremost, as the final
game of conference play for both
teams, it will heavily influence the
postseason for the whole confer
ence. The Bears (20-9,12-5 Pac-10)
probably need a win to secure the
conference title outright (assuming
Arizona State can handle UCLA).
And Stanford (13-16, 7-10 Pac-10)
needs a win to avoid the play-in
game for the Pac-10 Tournament.
As a veteran of tournament play
and the player averaging the most
minutes in the conference (36.10 a
game), Fields hopes the already
shallow Cardinal roster can avoid
any extra play.
"Given our personnel and the
minutes guys are giving, it would be
beneficial for us to play [fewer]
games," Fields said. "It would be big
for us to have to win three games to
win it all instead of four."

But to win any games in the con
ference tourney in L.A., the team,
which has often struggled on the
road, needs all the momentum it can
muster coming out of Saturday.
Senior guard Drew Shiller
knows it.

"We know that going into the
Pac-10 Tournament, any team could
get hot," Shiller said, "and that team
could be us. But, building that mo
mentum definitely starts Saturday."
Head coach Johnny Dawkins,
though, notes that regardless of the
postseason implications, the game
holds other significance.

"We absolutely realize the im
portance of this game," Dawkins
said. "One, we're playing rivals, so
it's always an important game, and
the guys are going to compete at a
high level. Two, we still want to get
as many wins as possible. So, I think
it takes on a huge meaning for us,
and it has a huge meaning for
them."
On a more personal level, there

TOURNAMENT

3/10-3/13 Los Angeles, Calif.

NOTES ! Stanford's final regular season game will
pit the Card, which currently sits eighth in the Pac
-10 standings, against conference leader Califor
nia. Stanford needs a win to stay out of the Pac
-10 Tournament's play-in game, while the Golden
Bears will secure the top seed in the tournament
with a victory. For Stanford senior forward Landry
Fields, his candidacy for conference Player of the
Year may ride on his team's performance in to
morrow's gameâ€”without a victory, it is unlikely
that Fields will win the award despite leading the
Pac-10 in numerous statistical categories.
