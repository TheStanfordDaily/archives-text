# TAKING ON THE GAUCHOS
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After a strong showing yesterday at
UC-Davis, Stanford's baseball team will
return to the Farm today to open a three
game series against UC-Santa Barbara.
Hanging over the series is the possibility
of rain throughout the weekend. The
weather has already impacted the Cardi
nal this week the game against the Ag
gies was originally scheduled for Wednes

day, and was moved to yesterday due to
rainy conditions.
No. 24 Stanford (5-3) started off its
week on Tuesday with an exhibition game
against Rikkyo University of Tokyo,
Japan. Though the Card played many of its
younger, less experienced players, it still
came away with a 4-2 win. Sophomore El
liott Byers was the winning pitcher for
Stanford, while Kenya Okabe took the
loss for Rikkyo. The Japanese team is in
the middle of a tour of California, where it

will play a number of other schools.
Yesterday, the Cardinal got a day of
good weather and traveled to UC-Davis
for a single game against the Aggies (4-5).
Despite falling behind early in the game,
Stanford rallied to pull out the win, 10-6.
For the first five innings of the game,
the Cardinal's offense was anemic, scoring
only two runs off Davis starter Matthew
Lewis.

GAME NOTES: After being swept by No. 5 Texas last weekend, No. 24 Stanford
rebounded strongly in its first two games this week. It defeated Rikkyo University
of Tokyo, Japan in an exhibition game on Tuesday and beat UC-Davis yester
day 10-6. It opens its next three-game series today at Sunken Diamond
against UC-Santa Barbara. The Cardinal will look to stay unbeaten at home.

Meanwhile, freshman Garrett
Hughes, the starting pitcher for the
Card, was taken out of the game
after giving up four earned runs in
just 2.1 innings of work. After he was
relieved in the third inning by sopho
more Brian Busick, the Cardinal
pitching staff locked down the Aggie
offense, surrendering only two more
runs in the eighth inning. Stanford
used a total of seven pitchers.
Entering the sixth inning, Davis

held a slim 4-2 lead over the Card. In
the first at-bat of the inning, fresh
man center fielder Jake Stewart hit a
triple to deep center, followed by a
walk and a single by junior second
baseman Colin Walsh and freshman
left fielder Stephen Piscotty, respec
tively.

After loading the bases, a walk to
junior shortstop Jake Schlander
forced in a run. Following an out by
junior pinch hitter Dave Giuliani,
freshman third baseman Kenny
Diekroeger launched a grand slam
over the wall, giving Stanford four
more runs and putting the Card
ahead for good.
The Cardinal's next challenge will

be at home against UC-Santa Bar
bara (3-2). The series marks the first
time the two schools have played
each other since 1997.

The Gauchos will certainly pose a
lesser challenge to Stanford than its
first two weekend series. The Card
opened its season two weeks ago
with a three-game sweep of presea
son-No. 6 Rice, before being swept in
its next weekend series at No. 5
Texas.

"We didn't play very well down in
Texas," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "We didn't hit and
we didn't pitch very well."
The Cardinal should have plenty
of opportunities to rebound strongly

against UCSB. Its toughest oppo
nent of the year has been San Jose
State, and it lost its series against the
Spartans 2-1.
However, Marquess is not taking
the Gauchos lightly.
"It's very difficult to sweep any
body," he said. "You don't want to
lose any games, and I'll be disap
pointed if we lose any games, but we
can. If we don't play well, we'll get
beat it's a matter of how we play
as compared to our opponents. No
one's going to be that easy to win a
game against."

On the offensive side, Stanford
will look to Walsh to provide fire
power at the heart of its lineup.
Walsh leads the team in several sta-

tistical categories, including batting
average, hits and runs batted in. Ju
nior catcher Zach Jones will also be
an integral part of the Cardinal's
lineup he currently leads the
team in home runs.

Defense is certainly an area
where Stanford needs to improve.
The Cardinal's starting infield
comprised of Walsh, Diekroeger,
Schlander and junior first baseman
Jonathan Kaskow has collectively
committed eight errors this season,
including three by Schlander. The
left side of the infield has been espe
cially poor, with an average fielding
percentage of .933. As a team, the
Card has committed 13 errors, com
pared to just five by its opponents.
Stanford's starting trio of sopho
more pitchers, Scott Snodgress, Jor
dan Pries and Brett Mooneyham,
has also struggled, especially against
Texas. All three currently have
ERAs at or above 4.50, but those
numbers should improve after fac
ing a weaker UCSB lineup this
weekend.

"I don't think we really have any
strengths right now," Marquess said.
"There are phases of our game
where we're very average or below
average. Our defense, which we
thought was our strength, hasn't
played very well. We've walked too
many people and struck out too
much. Really, I think we're very for
tunate to be 4-3."

Barring weather delays, Stanford
will begin its series against UC-
Santa Barbara today at Sunken Di
amond. First pitch will be at 5:30
p.m. Neither team has announced a
starting pitcher.

Barbara this weekend. Stanford's offense has been a strength this season; it racked up 10 runs against UC-Davis last night.
After a strong showing yesterday at
UC-Davis, Stanford's baseball team will
return to the Farm today to open a three
game series against UC-Santa Barbara.
Hanging over the series is the possibility
of rain throughout the weekend. The
weather has already impacted the Cardi
nal this week the game against the Ag
gies was originally scheduled for Wednes

day, and was moved to yesterday due to
rainy conditions.
No. 24 Stanford (5-3) started off its
week on Tuesday with an exhibition game
against Rikkyo University of Tokyo,
Japan. Though the Card played many of its
younger, less experienced players, it still
came away with a 4-2 win. Sophomore El
liott Byers was the winning pitcher for
Stanford, while Kenya Okabe took the
loss for Rikkyo. The Japanese team is in
the middle of a tour of California, where it

will play a number of other schools.
Yesterday, the Cardinal got a day of
good weather and traveled to UC-Davis
for a single game against the Aggies (4-5).
Despite falling behind early in the game,
Stanford rallied to pull out the win, 10-6.
For the first five innings of the game,
the Cardinal's offense was anemic, scoring
only two runs off Davis starter Matthew
Lewis.

GAME NOTES: After being swept by No. 5 Texas last weekend, No. 24 Stanford
rebounded strongly in its first two games this week. It defeated Rikkyo University
of Tokyo, Japan in an exhibition game on Tuesday and beat UC-Davis yester
day 10-6. It opens its next three-game series today at Sunken Diamond
against UC-Santa Barbara. The Cardinal will look to stay unbeaten at home.

Meanwhile, freshman Garrett
Hughes, the starting pitcher for the
Card, was taken out of the game
after giving up four earned runs in
just 2.1 innings of work. After he was
relieved in the third inning by sopho
more Brian Busick, the Cardinal
pitching staff locked down the Aggie
offense, surrendering only two more
runs in the eighth inning. Stanford
used a total of seven pitchers.
Entering the sixth inning, Davis

held a slim 4-2 lead over the Card. In
the first at-bat of the inning, fresh
man center fielder Jake Stewart hit a
triple to deep center, followed by a
walk and a single by junior second
baseman Colin Walsh and freshman
left fielder Stephen Piscotty, respec
tively.

After loading the bases, a walk to
junior shortstop Jake Schlander
forced in a run. Following an out by
junior pinch hitter Dave Giuliani,
freshman third baseman Kenny
Diekroeger launched a grand slam
over the wall, giving Stanford four
more runs and putting the Card
ahead for good.
The Cardinal's next challenge will

be at home against UC-Santa Bar
bara (3-2). The series marks the first
time the two schools have played
each other since 1997.

The Gauchos will certainly pose a
lesser challenge to Stanford than its
first two weekend series. The Card
opened its season two weeks ago
with a three-game sweep of presea
son-No. 6 Rice, before being swept in
its next weekend series at No. 5
Texas.

"We didn't play very well down in
Texas," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "We didn't hit and
we didn't pitch very well."
The Cardinal should have plenty
of opportunities to rebound strongly

against UCSB. Its toughest oppo
nent of the year has been San Jose
State, and it lost its series against the
Spartans 2-1.
However, Marquess is not taking
the Gauchos lightly.
"It's very difficult to sweep any
body," he said. "You don't want to
lose any games, and I'll be disap
pointed if we lose any games, but we
can. If we don't play well, we'll get
beat it's a matter of how we play
as compared to our opponents. No
one's going to be that easy to win a
game against."

On the offensive side, Stanford
will look to Walsh to provide fire
power at the heart of its lineup.
Walsh leads the team in several sta-

tistical categories, including batting
average, hits and runs batted in. Ju
nior catcher Zach Jones will also be
an integral part of the Cardinal's
lineup he currently leads the
team in home runs.

Defense is certainly an area
where Stanford needs to improve.
The Cardinal's starting infield
comprised of Walsh, Diekroeger,
Schlander and junior first baseman
Jonathan Kaskow has collectively
committed eight errors this season,
including three by Schlander. The
left side of the infield has been espe
cially poor, with an average fielding
percentage of .933. As a team, the
Card has committed 13 errors, com
pared to just five by its opponents.
Stanford's starting trio of sopho
more pitchers, Scott Snodgress, Jor
dan Pries and Brett Mooneyham,
has also struggled, especially against
Texas. All three currently have
ERAs at or above 4.50, but those
numbers should improve after fac
ing a weaker UCSB lineup this
weekend.

"I don't think we really have any
strengths right now," Marquess said.
"There are phases of our game
where we're very average or below
average. Our defense, which we
thought was our strength, hasn't
played very well. We've walked too
many people and struck out too
much. Really, I think we're very for
tunate to be 4-3."

Barring weather delays, Stanford
will begin its series against UC-
Santa Barbara today at Sunken Di
amond. First pitch will be at 5:30
p.m. Neither team has announced a
starting pitcher.
