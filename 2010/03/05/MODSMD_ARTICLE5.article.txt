After a strong showing yesterday at
UC-Davis, Stanford's baseball team will
return to the Farm today to open a three
game series against UC-Santa Barbara.
Hanging over the series is the possibility
of rain throughout the weekend. The
weather has already impacted the Cardi
nal this week the game against the Ag
gies was originally scheduled for Wednes

day, and was moved to yesterday due to
rainy conditions.
No. 24 Stanford (5-3) started off its
week on Tuesday with an exhibition game
against Rikkyo University of Tokyo,
Japan. Though the Card played many of its
younger, less experienced players, it still
came away with a 4-2 win. Sophomore El
liott Byers was the winning pitcher for
Stanford, while Kenya Okabe took the
loss for Rikkyo. The Japanese team is in
the middle of a tour of California, where it

will play a number of other schools.
Yesterday, the Cardinal got a day of
good weather and traveled to UC-Davis
for a single game against the Aggies (4-5).
Despite falling behind early in the game,
Stanford rallied to pull out the win, 10-6.
For the first five innings of the game,
the Cardinal's offense was anemic, scoring
only two runs off Davis starter Matthew
Lewis.
