v would do anything to turn the time
back to freshman year," said Eugene
Nho. What some seniors would give to
rewind. For Nho and other Stanford
M seniors, the final year on the Farm is
one defined by reflection on the past, an intensified
effort to live in the present and a projection toward
the future.
No two of Stanford's seniors experience their final
year in the same way. Some seniors eagerly anticipate

graduation, bolstered by the comfort of having se
cured a future job. A few haven't made any firm post
graduation plans. A handful are absolutely terrified.
Others are just enjoying the ride.
"They're a different breed in that they're plan
ning for June and beyond," explained Felicity Meu,
assistant director of student and young alumni de
velopment at the Office of Development, of the cur
rent seniors. "They're thinking about life beyond the
bubble."
Nho, an economics major planning on working at

rhis week, The
Daily ran a series
on Stanford's
four undergraduate
class years across multi
ple issues.
Today's issue contains
part five, the final part
of this series, and is
focused on seniors.

a San Francisco consulting firm after gradua
tion, said that the most unsettling part of leav
ing Stanford is precisely that leaving Stan
ford.
"I'm completely afraid of graduation be
cause no matter how cool of a job you have, it's
not going to be school," he said. "This is pretty
much the best life I could ask for."
For Elizabeth Bagot, the specter of life be
yond Stanford is taking its toll on her.
"Instead of looking forward to the future,
I'm terrified," Bagot admitted. "I'm not yet at
the point where I'm excited to graduate."
"Right now I'm thinking, 'Why am I not
doing engineering?'" she added.
Christie Cho, a history major, noted that al
though one usually gains confidence over the
course of their college career, Stanford seniors
have their own set of insecurities.
"There are moments when you see this bril
liant freshman," Cho said, "and you think,
'They have it way more figured out than I do.'"
But other seniors are ready to move on to
the next phase of their life.
"I kind of feel a need to breathe," said Joy
Henry, a science, technology and society major.
"A lot of Stanford students have basically been
going non-stop since they were 16, so it will be
nice to just be a normal human being. As weird
as it is, real life will probably be a lot less stress
ful than Stanford."
As away of seeking closure, many seniors
have attempted to retrace their time on the
Farm and get back in touch with the eclectic
communities that have shaped their identities.
"Senior year has been different in terms of
reconnecting with the school," said Walter Fox
worth, a mechanical engineering major and a
senior class president.
The combination of the intensity of the un
dergraduate experience, the incredible friends
and the attachment one develops for life at
Stanford make senior year bittersweet. When
seniors point to the single aspect of the Stan
ford experience that they will miss most, it is al
most unanimous: the people.
"You really begin to appreciate the friends
you have made and really cherish it," said Amir
Ravandoust, a management science and engi
neering major.
For Ben Phillips, a big difference in the fu
ture will be the lack of everyday conversation
among friends.
"I'll definitely miss the camaraderie,"
Phillips said. "I feel like there are a bunch of re
ally great people here. You can just have the
most excellent conversations, even about the
most trivial stuff. I mean we're so nerdy I
love it."
For Ravandoust, senior year revolved
around four main tasks: fulfilling GER re
quirements, writing a thesis, Pub Night and re
cruitment.

Cho said that her senior year has revolved
around writing her senior thesis.
"This quarter I'm taking one class," Cho
said. "I'm also writing an honors thesis. It takes
up 99 percent of my time."
However, when seniors aren't madly writ
ing a thesis or prepping for job interviews, they
are conscientiously trying to make the most of
their remaining time.
Sonia Mendoza, a human biology major,
decided to focus on her social life this year
more than she has at any other time during her
Stanford career.
"Senior year comes really fast," Mendoza ex
plained. "You just want to put the brakes on."
Sam Julian, who intends to teach English
abroad, is trying to use his senior year to com
plete some unfinished business.
"My band wants to get together and get all
of its songs recorded before we graduate and
break up," he said. "Everything is coming to an
end."
Senior year also makes students reflect
upon how much they have changed during

their time at Stanford.
"You grow so much from when you're a
freshman to when you're a senior," Mendoza
said. "You have no idea how much your life is
going to change by the time you graduate."
For Ravandoust, this growth meant learn
ing that it was okay if the Stanford experience
didn't unfold in exactly the way he had
planned.
"When I first came, I was in high school
mode," Ravandoust said. "My tolerance for
things not going as I wanted was very low. Then
over time, you explore and you see that things
not going how you want them to won't kill
you."
JR Fleard, a computer science major living
in Columbae, recognized that he had changed
from the person he was as a freshman when he
opted to live in a co-op.
"If I came here as a freshman, I wouldn't
have been interested in living in Columbae," he
said. "I mean co-ops are pretty weird.They tend
to have pretty weird people."
"And really, if anyone got into Stanford," he

added, "they're already pretty weird."
Finally, with more than three years of expe
rience under their belt, seniors are some of the
best sources of advice for life on the Farm.
They've got a few tips for undergrads.
Ronnie Tisdale, a Resident Assistant (RA)
in Murray, recommended that students remem
ber to breathe while attempting to navigate
their four years at Stanford.
"Calm down and take your time," Tisdale
said. "There's no need to rush academically."
To Foxworth, perseverance is critical to a
successful Stanford run.
"It's going to take you in and spit you out,"
he said. "But you have to trust that you are
going to come out as a very strong individual."
Garner Kropp, a Daily photographer, of
fered his own advice on how to get the most out
of the Stanford experienced, expertly distilled:
"Go abroad, go to football games and go to
office hours. That pretty much sums it up."

As their final year comes to a close, seniors will be left not only reflecting on their memories at the Farm, but looking forward to life out in the real
world. This time next year, seniors won't have to worry about fulfilling GER requirements or writing their honors theses, but will be contending with
the demands of the job market and making sense of their futures.
