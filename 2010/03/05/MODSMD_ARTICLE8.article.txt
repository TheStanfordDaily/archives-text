## UCSD racism sparks censorship debate 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
An ever-growing spiral of events at the Uni
versity of California San Diego (UCSD) over
the past two and a half weeks has much of the
southern California campus in an uproar re
garding hate speech and media censorship.
Beginning with a racially-themed "Compton
Cookout" fraternity party on Presidents' Day
and escalating to the discovery of a noose in the
UCSD Geisel Library on Feb. 25, UCSD's cam
pus has been facing fierce racial tension, exacer
bated by a blanket funding freeze for student
media outlets as a result of hate speech made in
a student-run television program.
The events have raised questions about First
Amendment rights to free speech and press on
campus universities, where many media outlets
rely heavily on university funding to publish and
broadcast content.
Racial Tensions Plague UCSD Campus
On Feb. 15, a "Compton Cookouf'-themed
party was hosted at a student's home by a group
of individuals, many of whom were affiliated
with the fraternity Pi Kappa Alpha. According
to UCSD's campus newspaper, The Guardian,
the event called for men to dress in "XXXL" t
shirts and "stunner shades" and for women to
dress in cheap clothing like "ghetto chicks."
The event left UCSD's African-American
population less than two percent of the stu
dent body and its supporters stunned and
outraged, leading to gatherings and protests in
the following days. On Feb. 18, UCSD's humor
magazine, The Koala, aired a program on the
campus Student-Run TV (SRTV) channel, in
which Koala editor in chief Kris Gregorian
called protesters "ungrateful niggers."
The two words incited a wave of outrage
among black students and supporters, and in re
sponse, the UCSD Black Student Union (BSU)
declared a "state of emergency" and submitted a
list of 32 demands to the University to fix what
they deemed a "toxic environment." Associated
Students (AS) President Ustav Gupta 'lO shut
down SRTV soon after the incident.
But in an unexpected move on the afternoon
of Feb. 19, Gupta also froze student fee funding
for all campus media publications, causing many

students to question the ethics behind the move.
Almost a week later, a noose was found
hanging from a bookcase in UCSD's Geisel Li
brary on the evening of Feb. 25, setting off a
fresh round of protests and demands from the
student population, culminating in a takeover of
the chancellor's office the next day.
A female student claimed responsibility for
the noose on Feb. 26 and was suspended. The
Guardian printed her anonymous apology, in
which she said she and two friends made the
noose with a piece of rope they had been play
ing with, saying she "innocently marveled at [the
friend's] ability to tie a noose, without thinking
of any of its connotations or the current racial
climate at UCSD."
Other University of California campuses
have seen racist images appearing on campus
since. On Monday, an image of a noose was
found scribbled on a bathroom door at Univer
sity of California Santa Cruz. On Wednesday,
several swastikas were found spray-painted at
the University of California Davis campus.
Safe Environment, or Suppressing Free
Speech?
Beyond inciting anger on the UCSD campus,
the comments in The Koala and the ensuing stu
dent publication-funding freeze have shed light
on universities' reactions to hate speech through
student media outlets.
AS President Ustav Gupta's decision to uni
laterally freeze university funding for student
media publications came as a shock to the cam
pus, where many students see it as an act of cen
sorship.
"Mass media censorship is never the an
swer," wrote UCSD communications major and
former Guardian writer Teresa Wu 'lO in an e
mail to The Daily. "Moreover, many of the other
media organizations on campus have expressed
their desire to vocalize their own opinions about
the recent incidents but instead they've found
their voices suppressed, too."
Although the funding freeze only affected a
portion of student media outlets on campus
14 of the 33 outlets receive funding from student
fees and many organizations have alternate
funds, it has nevertheless hindered or outright
prevented several outlets from publishing, and
many heads of media outlets still see the motive

underlying the funding freeze as a "slippery
slope."
"We don't condone the actions or comments
of The Koala, but as a media organization, we
have to stand by them," said Angela Chen, a
news editor for The Guardian, which is inde
pendently funded. "If The Koala goes first,
what's next?"
Gupta told The Daily that the funding freeze
was "not based on a singular occasion" and "not
a response to content," but that the AS had al
ready been considering revamping the media
funding process before the events.
"It's not about censorship, but how we're al
locating funds," Gupta said. "The right to free
speech does not necessarily mean a right to
funding."
Gupta and other members of the AS stand by
their original claim that the funding freeze was a
response not to specific content, but to a gener
al trend of media outlets perpetuating a "misuse
of funds" as specified in the UCSD constitution.
Article II of the constitution states that the ob
ject of the AS is to "to create and execute pro
grams which serve the collective interests of the
undergraduate population," and Gupta claims
that because the AS funding was not fulfilling its
role as stated in Article 11, that he had the au
thority and the responsibility to freeze it.
"I'm not for freezing funds based on content,
but I don't think that's what we're doing now,"
said Andrew Ang 'l2, associate vice president
for student organizations at UCSD.
Gupta emphasized that some outlets have
continued publishing despite funding freezes.
According to Chen, The Koala has received
anonymous donations that have helped it con
tinue publishing during the freeze.
The freeze is set to last until a bill can be
passed to the legislative branch of the student
government to reshape media funding policies.
Gupta and other AS officers have projected the
changes to happen this week, although Nicole
Teixeira 'lO, editor of the satire magazine The
MQ, noted that the process to change guidelines
has been "very slow" and is skeptical of the
promise of a quick resolution.
She also expressed the general feeling among
student media outlets that in spite of the claims
of Gupta and his associates, the freeze is a direct
response to the offensive comments made on

Feb. 18.
"[The AS] can't say they're punishing The
Koala, but the general understanding is that
they are," she said.
Stanford Weighs In on Implications
The echoing of the racial tensions at UCSD
at other Californian universities has raised con
cerns about the spread of free press and censor
ship issues to other peer institutions such as
Stanford.
"These sweeping suspensions sound like the
kind of thing the Kremlin might have done," said
Glenn Frankel, the Hearst Professional in Resi
dence for the communications department and
a member of The Daily's board of directors. "I'm
hard-pressed to see how [Gupta] can justify his
actions."
But on a broader principle of funding freezes
based on content, Frankel acknowledged that
it's a gray area.
"It's a tough question," he said. "There are
conflicting values: you want free dialogue, which
always includes conflict, but you also need to
find leverage for responsibility, which is often
money."
Tim Ford, co-director of Stanford's Publica
tions Board and editor in chief of the Stanford
Review, asserted that while The Koala and
SRTV both made "extremely poor judgment
calls," Gupta's actions have made a bad situation
even worse.
"UCSD needs student voices now more than
ever to talk through and make sense of these dif
ficult times for the whole community," Ford
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "In response to
a few students' poor judgment, even construc
tive news and commentary that could benefit
the student body has been restricted."
Gupta's equivalent at Stanford, ASSU Presi
dent David Gobaud, a coterminal student in
computer science, does not have the same abili
ty to freeze funding. According to Adam Be
berg, a Ph.D. student and former Graduate Stu
dent Council member, GSC and the Undergrad
uate Senate would have to make a joint decision
to retract student group funding.
Beberg also noted that the disciplinary
process for similar occurrences of hate speech at
Stanford would be handled by the
University's Office of Judicial Affairs
and directed by the Acts of Intoler
ance Protocol. Ford agreed that Stan
ford's disciplinary system would be
preferable to the events at UCSD.
"I'd rather see Acts of Intolerance
[Protocol] brought against individual
students who choose to publish in
flammatory material so they can at
least learn why what they're doing is
wrong rather than silence an entire
publication that could still offer the
university community a service once
it learns the wrongs of particular ac-

tions," wrote Ford.

"It's not about censorship, but how we're al
locating funds," Gupta said. "The right to free
speech does not necessarily mean a right to
funding."
Gupta and other members of the AS stand by
their original claim that the funding freeze was a
response not to specific content, but to a gener
al trend of media outlets perpetuating a "misuse
of funds" as specified in the UCSD constitution.
Article II of the constitution states that the ob
ject of the AS is to "to create and execute pro
grams which serve the collective interests of the
undergraduate population," and Gupta claims
that because the AS funding was not fulfilling its
role as stated in Article 11, that he had the au
thority and the responsibility to freeze it.
"I'm not for freezing funds based on content,
but I don't think that's what we're doing now,"
said Andrew Ang 'l2, associate vice president
for student organizations at UCSD.
Gupta emphasized that some outlets have
continued publishing despite funding freezes.
According to Chen, The Koala has received
anonymous donations that have helped it con
tinue publishing during the freeze.
The freeze is set to last until a bill can be
passed to the legislative branch of the student
government to reshape media funding policies.
Gupta and other AS officers have projected the
changes to happen this week, although Nicole
Teixeira 'lO, editor of the satire magazine The
MQ, noted that the process to change guidelines
has been "very slow" and is skeptical of the
promise of a quick resolution.
She also expressed the general feeling among
student media outlets that in spite of the claims
of Gupta and his associates, the freeze is a direct
response to the offensive comments made on

Feb. 18.
"[The AS] can't say they're punishing The
Koala, but the general understanding is that
they are," she said.
Stanford Weighs In on Implications
The echoing of the racial tensions at UCSD
at other Californian universities has raised con
cerns about the spread of free press and censor
ship issues to other peer institutions such as
Stanford.
"These sweeping suspensions sound like the
kind of thing the Kremlin might have done," said
Glenn Frankel, the Hearst Professional in Resi
dence for the communications department and
a member of The Daily's board of directors. "I'm
hard-pressed to see how [Gupta] can justify his
actions."
But on a broader principle of funding freezes
based on content, Frankel acknowledged that
it's a gray area.
"It's a tough question," he said. "There are
conflicting values: you want free dialogue, which
always includes conflict, but you also need to
find leverage for responsibility, which is often
money."
Tim Ford, co-director of Stanford's Publica
tions Board and editor in chief of the Stanford
Review, asserted that while The Koala and
SRTV both made "extremely poor judgment
calls," Gupta's actions have made a bad situation
even worse.
"UCSD needs student voices now more than
ever to talk through and make sense of these dif
ficult times for the whole community," Ford
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "In response to
a few students' poor judgment, even construc
tive news and commentary that could benefit
the student body has been restricted."
Gupta's equivalent at Stanford, ASSU Presi
dent David Gobaud, a coterminal student in
computer science, does not have the same abili
ty to freeze funding. According to Adam Be
berg, a Ph.D. student and former Graduate Stu
dent Council member, GSC and the Undergrad
uate Senate would have to make a joint decision
to retract student group funding.
Beberg also noted that the disciplinary
process for similar occurrences of hate speech at
Stanford would be handled by the
University's Office of Judicial Affairs
and directed by the Acts of Intoler
ance Protocol. Ford agreed that Stan
ford's disciplinary system would be
preferable to the events at UCSD.
"I'd rather see Acts of Intolerance
[Protocol] brought against individual
students who choose to publish in
flammatory material so they can at
least learn why what they're doing is
wrong rather than silence an entire
publication that could still offer the
university community a service once
it learns the wrongs of particular ac-

tions," wrote Ford.

An ever-growing spiral of events at the Uni
versity of California San Diego (UCSD) over
the past two and a half weeks has much of the
southern California campus in an uproar re
garding hate speech and media censorship.
Beginning with a racially-themed "Compton
Cookout" fraternity party on Presidents' Day
and escalating to the discovery of a noose in the
UCSD Geisel Library on Feb. 25, UCSD's cam
pus has been facing fierce racial tension, exacer
bated by a blanket funding freeze for student
media outlets as a result of hate speech made in
a student-run television program.
The events have raised questions about First
Amendment rights to free speech and press on
campus universities, where many media outlets
rely heavily on university funding to publish and
broadcast content.
Racial Tensions Plague UCSD Campus
On Feb. 15, a "Compton Cookouf'-themed
party was hosted at a student's home by a group
of individuals, many of whom were affiliated
with the fraternity Pi Kappa Alpha. According
to UCSD's campus newspaper, The Guardian,
the event called for men to dress in "XXXL" t
shirts and "stunner shades" and for women to
dress in cheap clothing like "ghetto chicks."
The event left UCSD's African-American
population less than two percent of the stu
dent body and its supporters stunned and
outraged, leading to gatherings and protests in
the following days. On Feb. 18, UCSD's humor
magazine, The Koala, aired a program on the
campus Student-Run TV (SRTV) channel, in
which Koala editor in chief Kris Gregorian
called protesters "ungrateful niggers."
The two words incited a wave of outrage
among black students and supporters, and in re
sponse, the UCSD Black Student Union (BSU)
declared a "state of emergency" and submitted a
list of 32 demands to the University to fix what
they deemed a "toxic environment." Associated
Students (AS) President Ustav Gupta 'lO shut
down SRTV soon after the incident.
But in an unexpected move on the afternoon
of Feb. 19, Gupta also froze student fee funding
for all campus media publications, causing many

students to question the ethics behind the move.
Almost a week later, a noose was found
hanging from a bookcase in UCSD's Geisel Li
brary on the evening of Feb. 25, setting off a
fresh round of protests and demands from the
student population, culminating in a takeover of
the chancellor's office the next day.
A female student claimed responsibility for
the noose on Feb. 26 and was suspended. The
Guardian printed her anonymous apology, in
which she said she and two friends made the
noose with a piece of rope they had been play
ing with, saying she "innocently marveled at [the
friend's] ability to tie a noose, without thinking
of any of its connotations or the current racial
climate at UCSD."
Other University of California campuses
have seen racist images appearing on campus
since. On Monday, an image of a noose was
found scribbled on a bathroom door at Univer
sity of California Santa Cruz. On Wednesday,
several swastikas were found spray-painted at
the University of California Davis campus.
Safe Environment, or Suppressing Free
Speech?
Beyond inciting anger on the UCSD campus,
the comments in The Koala and the ensuing stu
dent publication-funding freeze have shed light
on universities' reactions to hate speech through
student media outlets.
AS President Ustav Gupta's decision to uni
laterally freeze university funding for student
media publications came as a shock to the cam
pus, where many students see it as an act of cen
sorship.
"Mass media censorship is never the an
swer," wrote UCSD communications major and
former Guardian writer Teresa Wu 'lO in an e
mail to The Daily. "Moreover, many of the other
media organizations on campus have expressed
their desire to vocalize their own opinions about
the recent incidents but instead they've found
their voices suppressed, too."
Although the funding freeze only affected a
portion of student media outlets on campus
14 of the 33 outlets receive funding from student
fees and many organizations have alternate
funds, it has nevertheless hindered or outright
prevented several outlets from publishing, and
many heads of media outlets still see the motive

underlying the funding freeze as a "slippery
slope."
"We don't condone the actions or comments
of The Koala, but as a media organization, we
have to stand by them," said Angela Chen, a
news editor for The Guardian, which is inde
pendently funded. "If The Koala goes first,
what's next?"
Gupta told The Daily that the funding freeze
was "not based on a singular occasion" and "not
a response to content," but that the AS had al
ready been considering revamping the media
funding process before the events.
"It's not about censorship, but how we're al
locating funds," Gupta said. "The right to free
speech does not necessarily mean a right to
funding."
Gupta and other members of the AS stand by
their original claim that the funding freeze was a
