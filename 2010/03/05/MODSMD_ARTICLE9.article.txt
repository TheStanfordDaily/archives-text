## Protestors flood streets over education cuts 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Zach Zimmerman 
In a protest of recent cuts in educa
tion funding, California public univer
sities and their surrounding communi
ties were subject to both violent and
nonviolent protest on Thursday.
In Oakland, a group of protestors
blocked Interstate 880 just before 5
p.m. The protest occurred just after a
peaceful rally at Oakland City Hall,
according to the L. A. Times. Police ar
rested an undisclosed number of peo
ple before reopening lanes at 5:30 p.m.
According to The Daily Californ
ian, approximately 25 schools were
represented in the riots, aimed at con
veying the negative reactions of stu
dents and faculty toward state educa
tion budget cuts.
University of California (UC)
President Mark G. Yudof released a
statement regarding Thursday's
events.

"My heart and my support are with
everybody and anybody who wants to
stand up for public education," Yudof
said. "I salute those who are making
themselves heard today in a peaceful
manner on behalf of a great cause."

While the demonstrations in most
venues were in fact peaceful, many
protestors at UC-Santa Cruz reacted
with more hostility. A driver reported
having his car window smashed by ei
ther a rock or a hammer, an expected
occurrence after UC-Santa Cruz
Provost David Kliger alerted students
and employees of reports of protes
tors armed with clubs, knives and
pipes.
Outcry began in late September
2009 after it was announced that UC
and CSU schools would raise tuition
32 percent.
