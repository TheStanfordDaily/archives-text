Stanley N. Cohen
National Medal of Science and the National Medal of Technology Recipient
As a boy in New Jersey, Stanley Cohen was interested in atomic physics, but a biology teacher
in high school inspired his interest in genetics. He went on to study biology at Rutgers and
received an /VII) degree at Penn. In 1968, Cohen came to Stanford, and in 1973, he and
Herbert Boyer at UCSF invented the technique of DNA cloning, which allowed genes to be
transplanted between different biological species. Their discovery was revolutionary, signaling
the birth of genetic engineering and fueling the growth of the entire biotech industry.
Recipient of the National Medal of Science, the National Medal of Technology, the Albert
I.askcr Basic Medical Research Award, and the Wolfe Prize in Medicine, Stanley Cohen will
be introduced by his distinguished colleague, Lucy Shapiro, l.udwig Professor of Cancer
Research in the School of Medicine, and Director of the lleckman Center for Molecular
and Genetic Medicine.
