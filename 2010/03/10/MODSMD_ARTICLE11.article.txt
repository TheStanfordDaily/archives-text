## Those who can, teach 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS MANAGING EDITOR 
When Luke Henesy 'lO began
tutoring two middle school
girls in East Palo Alto, he
thought teaching was a good
short-term extracurricular
gig. The Stanford sociology major didn't think
it was going to become a career path.
"But tutoring became the most rewarding
experience of my entire life," Henesy said.
Henesy began tutoring at the East Palo
Alto charter school his sophomore year
through Stanford's tutoring program Closing
the Gap. He was assigned two pupils, Andrea
and Vanessa, who were struggling with their
World War II history class.

"They didn't like textbooks because Eng
lish was their second language" said Henesy.
"I kind of felt their pain because I didn't get
really excited about history until I read Maus,
the graphic novel about the Holocaust where
mice and rats and cats are the actual charac
ters."

Henesy decided to try out this approach to
spark Andrea and Vanessa's engagement. He
went to Green Library and found a set of
graphic novels about the Hiroshima bomb
ings that he thought might capture the imagi
nation of his students. He was right.
"They loved it," he said. "What I started
getting really surprised about was when they
became able to retain and repeat back to me
info that was factual for that to happen
than at a much higher rate than they did be
fore, So when they would typically do history
homework, and I would ask them a question

like, 'how many people died in this battle?' or
'when did this happen?', they would say 'I
don't know, I don't know.' But after the graph
ic novels, they were reciting information to me
without me having to ask."

That was the beginning of a steady stream
of improvement for Henesy's tutees. Their hu
manities test scores skyrocketed.

"Once I realized that I could have that sort
of impact on two students with minimal effort,
I got really excited about the program Teach
for America," Henesy said. "I realized that I
could step in right after an undergrad educa
tion and perhaps be better equipped than, say,
a teacher that they may be having right now
who is under-qualified in a particular subject."
"I said, 'this is what I want to do for two
years', and I'm really excited about it," he
added.

Henesy is just one of the more than 10 per
cent of the Stanford senior class who applied
to Teach for America (TFA) this year. Teach
for America, the nearly 20 year old Peace -
Corps-esque teaching program which enlists
college grads for two-year stints and places
them in failing urban schools, just received
46,359 applicants for its 2010 corps. The ac
ceptance rate nationally last year was 15 per
cent of 35,000 applicants.

According to Emily Lewis-LaMonica, the
on-campus recruitment director for TFA,
Stanford has seen an upshot in TFA applicants
the past few years, compared to some of its
peer institutions. In 2008-2009, roughly six
percent of the Stanford senior class applied to
TFA. That number nearly doubled this year.
Nearly 12 percent of all seniors at Ivy League
schools, seven percent at the University of

Michigan-Ann Arbor and six percent at UC-
Berkeley apply for TFA.
For Kelly Gleischman 'lO, an on-campus
coordinator of TFA, education policy has
been a life-long passion, and she's been work
ing to close the educational inequity gap
throughout her time at Stanford. Gleischman
hailed from a well-to-do school district in

West Los Angeles and credited her academic
success so far to the guiding influence of her
teachers.
"The teachers that I had made me who I
am and made me care about what I do today,"
Gleischman said. "When I have these experi-

ences and I go into these schools and
realize that it isn't happening for
these kids around the country, I real
ize we need to fix that."
TFA was the obvious way to par
ley that passion into action. She ap
plied for the second TFA deadline in
October and has already received
her acceptance into the program.
She's heading to D.C. next fall to
teach secondary math in one of the
lowest-performing districts in the
nation.
"This is exactly how I want to
start my life and have those two
years on the ground to make a differ
ence within these communities,"
Gleischman said.

It was 5:30 a.m. and Jeff Bergquist
'OB groggily turned off his alarm
clock and rolled out of bed.
He was in the classroom by 6:30
in the morning, brewing coffee, set
ting up his day's lesson plans and or
ganizing the small room for Ithe
rambunctious middle schoolers
who would soon be filing in.
Bergquist teaches eighth grade
remedial math in the Balsz school
district in central Phoenix through
Teach for America, at a Title I desig
nated school with a sizable number
of Somali refugees. He's in his sec
ond year as a corps member. For
Bergquist, an economics major who
went to high school in Palo Alto, the
program has been a major shift from
his sheltered realm of experience.
"My first year was extremely
overwhelming," Bergquist said.
"There are so many things coming
at you, there are so many things to
deal with, and at times you're at a
place where you don't even know
where to start. You have all these
ideas, you know all the techniques,
but running a classroom yourself is
an incredibly taxing experience."
Bergquist says that his second
year has been much steadier, after
having gotten his bearings his first

year. But he said that setting realis
tic personal goals has remained one
of the most challenging aspects of
the program, even during year two.
"There's a fallacy that you can go
in and [...] over the course of two
years, make all this incredible
change," Bergquist said. "And the
reality of it is that that's not how it
works."
During his first year, he met a
student named Nicole who came
into the eighth grade at a fourth
grade level in math. Nicole could do
basic single-digit multiplication and
division but was "completely math
ematically illiterate" when it came
to decimals and fractions. The first
semester Bergquist was teaching,
Nicole had the lowest grade of any
one in the class. He knew that
Nicole needed help, so he tutored
her a few times a week before and
after school.
It worked. By the end of the year,
Nicole had progressed about four
grade levels.
"That story alone made me feel
like the year was a success and gave
me a lot of confidence," he said, with
obvious pride.
But results of that sort come with
a cost an around-the-clock
process of plan, teach, review, re
peat. Bergquist admitted that the
breakneck speed since beginning
has been tough.
"You know how exhausted you
are when you give a presentation for
class? You're just mentally and phys
ically drained and like, 'Oh God, I
just want to sit on the couch,'"
Bergquist said. "Teaching is like giv
ing five of those a day, every day."
To see just what the hyper-in
tense regimen of Teach for America
does to participants like Bergquist
and their civil engagement when
they leave the program sociology
Prof. Doug McAdam conducted a
pioneering study called "Assessing
the Long-Term Effects of Youth
Service: The Puzzling Case of Teach
for America," looking at applicants
from 1993 to 1998. He found that
not everyone can handle the
lifestyle.
The study compared "gradu
ates," who completed their two

years in Teach for America,
"dropouts," who enrolled in the
program, but bowed out before
completing the full two years and
"nonmatriculants," who were ac
cepted but turned down TFA.
"About 20 percent of graduates
said that they ended their experi
ence feeling disillusioned,"
McAdam said. "They didn't feel ef
fective as teachers and didn't feel
like this was the most effective way
to deal with the underlying issue."
Those results aren't too surprising
to Rob Reich, political science pro
fessor, who taught sixth grade in
Houston through Teach for America.
"I don't think anyone who's a
first-year teacher, credentialed or
non-credentialed, is an exceptional
teacher after one year," said Reich.
"The first year is really, really hard."
"These are students who have
basically succeeded at anything
they ever wanted to do," Reich con
tinued. "You put an obstacle in front
of them, and they'll either work
hard enough or have the native tal
ent to do it well [...] but they [then]
find that a bunch of 12 year olds are
eating them for lunch every day."
But for Henesy, burnout isn't a
concern yet. He just wants to make a
difference, Henesy applied to Teach
for America over the summer at the
suggestion of his big brother in
Kappa Sigma one Jeff Bergquist.
He was accepted into the program
and will be teaching high school
math in the Boston area his home
state. He's excited, but nervous.
"I think the biggest challenge is
going to be for all these kids to look
at me, a young white teacher who
am I to look at you and say, 'you can
do this, you can go to college just
like I did', because they're going to
see a disconnect between me and
them," Henesy said. "But if it can
even get one student to go from
joining a gang to going to any col
lege, then it's going to be worth me
crying every day after school or
whatever it takes literally put
ting every amount of blood, sweat
and tears into it."

fore, So when they would typically do history
homework, and I would ask them a question

like, 'how many people died in this battle?' or
'when did this happen?', they would say 'I
don't know, I don't know.' But after the graph
ic novels, they were reciting information to me
without me having to ask."

That was the beginning of a steady stream
of improvement for Henesy's tutees. Their hu
manities test scores skyrocketed.

"Once I realized that I could have that sort
of impact on two students with minimal effort,
I got really excited about the program Teach
for America," Henesy said. "I realized that I
could step in right after an undergrad educa
tion and perhaps be better equipped than, say,
a teacher that they may be having right now
who is under-qualified in a particular subject."
"I said, 'this is what I want to do for two
years', and I'm really excited about it," he
added.

Henesy is just one of the more than 10 per
cent of the Stanford senior class who applied
to Teach for America (TFA) this year. Teach
for America, the nearly 20 year old Peace -
Corps-esque teaching program which enlists
college grads for two-year stints and places
them in failing urban schools, just received
46,359 applicants for its 2010 corps. The ac
ceptance rate nationally last year was 15 per
cent of 35,000 applicants.

According to Emily Lewis-LaMonica, the
on-campus recruitment director for TFA,
Stanford has seen an upshot in TFA applicants
the past few years, compared to some of its
peer institutions. In 2008-2009, roughly six
percent of the Stanford senior class applied to
TFA. That number nearly doubled this year.
Nearly 12 percent of all seniors at Ivy League
schools, seven percent at the University of

Michigan-Ann Arbor and six percent at UC-
Berkeley apply for TFA.
For Kelly Gleischman 'lO, an on-campus
coordinator of TFA, education policy has
been a life-long passion, and she's been work
ing to close the educational inequity gap
throughout her time at Stanford. Gleischman
hailed from a well-to-do school district in

West Los Angeles and credited her academic
success so far to the guiding influence of her
teachers.
"The teachers that I had made me who I
am and made me care about what I do today,"
Gleischman said. "When I have these experi-

ences and I go into these schools and
realize that it isn't happening for
these kids around the country, I real
ize we need to fix that."
TFA was the obvious way to par
ley that passion into action. She ap
plied for the second TFA deadline in
October and has already received
her acceptance into the program.
She's heading to D.C. next fall to
teach secondary math in one of the
lowest-performing districts in the
nation.
"This is exactly how I want to
start my life and have those two
years on the ground to make a differ
ence within these communities,"
Gleischman said.

It was 5:30 a.m. and Jeff Bergquist
'OB groggily turned off his alarm
clock and rolled out of bed.
He was in the classroom by 6:30
in the morning, brewing coffee, set
ting up his day's lesson plans and or
ganizing the small room for Ithe
rambunctious middle schoolers
who would soon be filing in.
Bergquist teaches eighth grade
remedial math in the Balsz school
district in central Phoenix through
Teach for America, at a Title I desig
nated school with a sizable number
of Somali refugees. He's in his sec
ond year as a corps member. For
Bergquist, an economics major who
went to high school in Palo Alto, the
program has been a major shift from
his sheltered realm of experience.
"My first year was extremely
overwhelming," Bergquist said.
"There are so many things coming
at you, there are so many things to
deal with, and at times you're at a
place where you don't even know
where to start. You have all these
ideas, you know all the techniques,
but running a classroom yourself is
an incredibly taxing experience."
Bergquist says that his second
year has been much steadier, after
having gotten his bearings his first

year. But he said that setting realis
tic personal goals has remained one
of the most challenging aspects of
the program, even during year two.
"There's a fallacy that you can go
in and [...] over the course of two
years, make all this incredible
change," Bergquist said. "And the
reality of it is that that's not how it
works."
During his first year, he met a
student named Nicole who came
into the eighth grade at a fourth
grade level in math. Nicole could do
basic single-digit multiplication and
division but was "completely math
ematically illiterate" when it came
to decimals and fractions. The first
semester Bergquist was teaching,
Nicole had the lowest grade of any
one in the class. He knew that
Nicole needed help, so he tutored
her a few times a week before and
after school.
It worked. By the end of the year,
Nicole had progressed about four
grade levels.
"That story alone made me feel
like the year was a success and gave
me a lot of confidence," he said, with
obvious pride.
But results of that sort come with
a cost an around-the-clock
process of plan, teach, review, re
peat. Bergquist admitted that the
breakneck speed since beginning
has been tough.
"You know how exhausted you
are when you give a presentation for
class? You're just mentally and phys
ically drained and like, 'Oh God, I
just want to sit on the couch,'"
Bergquist said. "Teaching is like giv
ing five of those a day, every day."
To see just what the hyper-in
tense regimen of Teach for America
does to participants like Bergquist
and their civil engagement when
they leave the program sociology
Prof. Doug McAdam conducted a
pioneering study called "Assessing
the Long-Term Effects of Youth
Service: The Puzzling Case of Teach
for America," looking at applicants
from 1993 to 1998. He found that
not everyone can handle the
lifestyle.
The study compared "gradu
ates," who completed their two

years in Teach for America,
"dropouts," who enrolled in the
program, but bowed out before
completing the full two years and
"nonmatriculants," who were ac
cepted but turned down TFA.
"About 20 percent of graduates
said that they ended their experi
ence feeling disillusioned,"
McAdam said. "They didn't feel ef
fective as teachers and didn't feel
like this was the most effective way
to deal with the underlying issue."
Those results aren't too surprising
to Rob Reich, political science pro
fessor, who taught sixth grade in
Houston through Teach for America.
"I don't think anyone who's a
first-year teacher, credentialed or
non-credentialed, is an exceptional
teacher after one year," said Reich.
"The first year is really, really hard."
"These are students who have
basically succeeded at anything
they ever wanted to do," Reich con
tinued. "You put an obstacle in front
of them, and they'll either work
hard enough or have the native tal
ent to do it well [...] but they [then]
find that a bunch of 12 year olds are
eating them for lunch every day."
But for Henesy, burnout isn't a
concern yet. He just wants to make a
difference, Henesy applied to Teach
for America over the summer at the
suggestion of his big brother in
Kappa Sigma one Jeff Bergquist.
He was accepted into the program
and will be teaching high school
math in the Boston area his home
state. He's excited, but nervous.
"I think the biggest challenge is
going to be for all these kids to look
at me, a young white teacher who
am I to look at you and say, 'you can
do this, you can go to college just
like I did', because they're going to
see a disconnect between me and
them," Henesy said. "But if it can
even get one student to go from
joining a gang to going to any col
lege, then it's going to be worth me
crying every day after school or
whatever it takes literally put
ting every amount of blood, sweat
and tears into it."

When Luke Henesy 'lO began
tutoring two middle school
girls in East Palo Alto, he
thought teaching was a good
short-term extracurricular
gig. The Stanford sociology major didn't think
it was going to become a career path.
"But tutoring became the most rewarding
experience of my entire life," Henesy said.
Henesy began tutoring at the East Palo
Alto charter school his sophomore year
through Stanford's tutoring program Closing
the Gap. He was assigned two pupils, Andrea
and Vanessa, who were struggling with their
World War II history class.

"They didn't like textbooks because Eng
lish was their second language" said Henesy.
"I kind of felt their pain because I didn't get
really excited about history until I read Maus,
the graphic novel about the Holocaust where
mice and rats and cats are the actual charac
ters."

Henesy decided to try out this approach to
spark Andrea and Vanessa's engagement. He
went to Green Library and found a set of
graphic novels about the Hiroshima bomb
ings that he thought might capture the imagi
nation of his students. He was right.
"They loved it," he said. "What I started
getting really surprised about was when they
became able to retain and repeat back to me
info that was factual for that to happen
than at a much higher rate than they did be
fore, So when they would typically do history
homework, and I would ask them a question

like, 'how many people died in this battle?' or
