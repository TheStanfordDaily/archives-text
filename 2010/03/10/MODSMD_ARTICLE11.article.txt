## Those who can, teach 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS MANAGING EDITOR 
When Luke Henesy 'lO began
tutoring two middle school
girls in East Palo Alto, he
thought teaching was a good
short-term extracurricular
gig. The Stanford sociology major didn't think
it was going to become a career path.
"But tutoring became the most rewarding
experience of my entire life," Henesy said.
Henesy began tutoring at the East Palo
Alto charter school his sophomore year
through Stanford's tutoring program Closing
the Gap. He was assigned two pupils, Andrea
and Vanessa, who were struggling with their
World War II history class.

"They didn't like textbooks because Eng
lish was their second language" said Henesy.
"I kind of felt their pain because I didn't get
really excited about history until I read Maus,
the graphic novel about the Holocaust where
mice and rats and cats are the actual charac
ters."

Henesy decided to try out this approach to
spark Andrea and Vanessa's engagement. He
went to Green Library and found a set of
graphic novels about the Hiroshima bomb
ings that he thought might capture the imagi
nation of his students. He was right.
"They loved it," he said. "What I started
getting really surprised about was when they
became able to retain and repeat back to me
info that was factual for that to happen
than at a much higher rate than they did be
fore, So when they would typically do history
homework, and I would ask them a question

like, 'how many people died in this battle?' or
'when did this happen?', they would say 'I
don't know, I don't know.' But after the graph
ic novels, they were reciting information to me
without me having to ask."

That was the beginning of a steady stream
of improvement for Henesy's tutees. Their hu
manities test scores skyrocketed.

"Once I realized that I could have that sort
of impact on two students with minimal effort,
I got really excited about the program Teach
for America," Henesy said. "I realized that I
could step in right after an undergrad educa
tion and perhaps be better equipped than, say,
a teacher that they may be having right now
who is under-qualified in a particular subject."
"I said, 'this is what I want to do for two
years', and I'm really excited about it," he
added.

Henesy is just one of the more than 10 per
cent of the Stanford senior class who applied
to Teach for America (TFA) this year. Teach
for America, the nearly 20 year old Peace -
Corps-esque teaching program which enlists
college grads for two-year stints and places
them in failing urban schools, just received
46,359 applicants for its 2010 corps. The ac
ceptance rate nationally last year was 15 per
cent of 35,000 applicants.

According to Emily Lewis-LaMonica, the
on-campus recruitment director for TFA,
Stanford has seen an upshot in TFA applicants
the past few years, compared to some of its
peer institutions. In 2008-2009, roughly six
percent of the Stanford senior class applied to
TFA. That number nearly doubled this year.
Nearly 12 percent of all seniors at Ivy League
schools, seven percent at the University of

Michigan-Ann Arbor and six percent at UC-
Berkeley apply for TFA.
For Kelly Gleischman 'lO, an on-campus
coordinator of TFA, education policy has
been a life-long passion, and she's been work
ing to close the educational inequity gap
throughout her time at Stanford. Gleischman
hailed from a well-to-do school district in

West Los Angeles and credited her academic
success so far to the guiding influence of her
teachers.
"The teachers that I had made me who I
am and made me care about what I do today,"
Gleischman said. "When I have these experi-
