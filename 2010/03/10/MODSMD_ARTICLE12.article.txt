# FROM THE FARM TO THE CAPITAL

### SARAH FLAMM 
It was a cold, rainy Saturday evening in our nation's
capital, and Maria Lizet Ocampo 'O6, M.A. 'O6 was
giving five students in the Stanford in Washington
(SIW) program a tour of the West Wing of the
White House.
"And here is where Rahm Emanuel, Vice President
Biden and I enter for work every day," Ocampo said non
chalantly, walking through the double doors and into the
West Wing.
Ocampo led the group down the empty hallways,
abandoned for the weekend except for several other
small tour groups and watchful security guards.
"You are lucky," Ocampo said. "Obama just retired to
the residence to have dinner with his family, so we can
peek into the Oval Office."
The five Stanford students were awed by the sur
roundings, from President Obama's impeccably neat
desk to the general governmental grandeur, while Ocam
po seemed unfazed and in her element a tall, 25 year
old, confident Latina woman walking around her office.
Only four years ago Ocampo was at Stanford, living in
Casa Zapata in Stern Hall as an Ethnic Theme Manager
(ETA), playing in Mariachi Cardenal de Stanford and
working as a political science research assistant with former
Stanford professor Luis Fraga. Having earned a B. A. in po
litical science and a M.A. in social sciences from the School
of Education, Ocampo is now working in the East Wing of
the White House in the Office of Legislative Affairs, which
serves as a liaison between the President and Congress.
"My life at Stanford directly relates to what I do now,"
Ocampo said. She considers her current job as "part two
of a political science education."
Ocampo is just one of many Stanford alumni and fac
ulty who are now working in the White House. Just five
years ago, Michael Ortiz 'O5 was also living on the Farm,
taking classes to complete his history major and going to
Old Union for Stanford in Government meetings. Now, as
Assistant to the Director of the Office of Legislative Af
fairs, Ortiz spends his time in the West Wing of the White
House, participating in meetings with senior officials, in
cluding President Obama.

his experiences at SIW. While in
the Washington program, he in
terned with Senator Harry Reid
(D-NV) and took a class on con
gressional oversight from Walter
Pincus.
"I knew I'd want to return to
Washington after graduation," Ortiz
said.
He did, coming back to D.C. to
work for Reid after receiving his
B.A. He then got the opportunity to
work for Obama's press office, and
soon enough found himself where
he is now, in the Office of Legislative
Affairs.
"After graduation, I expected to
serve in government for a year or

two before returning to law school,"
Ortiz said. "Four years later, I'm still
here. It has been an incredible expe
rience. I'm so grateful to Stanford
for opening the door to so many of
these opportunities."
Ocampo also cited SIW as the
launch pad for her political future.
She said that interning at the De
partment of Justice through SIW
sparked her interest in politics.
While there, Ocampo said she was
inspired by a note that then-Senator
Obama wrote to her in a copy of his
book, "Dreams From My Father"
"Maria, dream big dreams!"
"As a child of immigrant parents
and the first person in my family to
graduate from college, I feel that my
story is an example of a big dream,
the American dream," Ocampo
said. "As typical as it sounds, I
strongly believe this dream should
be one available to everyone."

That belief led Ocampo to get in
volved in the Obama campaign in
Florida in 2008. After Obama was
elected, Ocampo volunteered with
the Obama presidential transition
team, working on English language
learner policies. Soon, she was hired
on as staff in the Office of Legisla
tive Affairs, where she is currently
working.
It was 8 p.m. and Ocampo was
wrapping up the West Wing tour.
The SIW students left the White
House after thanking Ocampo for
her personalized tour, chatting
about their dinner plans in George
town for later in the night. Ocampo
watched them leave, a few years re
moved from her time as a SIW stu
dent, before heading back to work
for a couple more hours.
