# FROM THE FARM TO THE CAPITAL

It was a cold, rainy Saturday evening in our nation's
capital, and Maria Lizet Ocampo 'O6, M.A. 'O6 was
giving five students in the Stanford in Washington
(SIW) program a tour of the West Wing of the
White House.
"And here is where Rahm Emanuel, Vice President
Biden and I enter for work every day," Ocampo said non
chalantly, walking through the double doors and into the
West Wing.
Ocampo led the group down the empty hallways,
abandoned for the weekend except for several other
small tour groups and watchful security guards.
"You are lucky," Ocampo said. "Obama just retired to
the residence to have dinner with his family, so we can
peek into the Oval Office."
The five Stanford students were awed by the sur
roundings, from President Obama's impeccably neat
desk to the general governmental grandeur, while Ocam
po seemed unfazed and in her element a tall, 25 year
old, confident Latina woman walking around her office.
Only four years ago Ocampo was at Stanford, living in
Casa Zapata in Stern Hall as an Ethnic Theme Manager
(ETA), playing in Mariachi Cardenal de Stanford and
working as a political science research assistant with former
Stanford professor Luis Fraga. Having earned a B. A. in po
litical science and a M.A. in social sciences from the School
of Education, Ocampo is now working in the East Wing of
the White House in the Office of Legislative Affairs, which
serves as a liaison between the President and Congress.
"My life at Stanford directly relates to what I do now,"
Ocampo said. She considers her current job as "part two
of a political science education."
Ocampo is just one of many Stanford alumni and fac
ulty who are now working in the White House. Just five
years ago, Michael Ortiz 'O5 was also living on the Farm,
taking classes to complete his history major and going to
Old Union for Stanford in Government meetings. Now, as
Assistant to the Director of the Office of Legislative Af
fairs, Ortiz spends his time in the West Wing of the White
House, participating in meetings with senior officials, in
cluding President Obama.
Ortiz attributed his current interest in politics to
