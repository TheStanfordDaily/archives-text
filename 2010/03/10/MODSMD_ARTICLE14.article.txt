# ROTC REVISITED

Alone building ablaze one
iconic image of students' dis
content with the United
States government and its
military in the late 19605.
In 1968, amid increased U.S. involve
ment in the Vietnam War and growing
protest among the student body, arsonists
twice attacked Stanford's Naval Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC) building,
successfully burning it to the ground on
their second attempt in May. Yet follow
ing investigations, authorities made no
arrests and could prove no student in
volvement.
Even as tensions approached a tipping
point, full-scale action on the ROTC was
not taken until 1970, and the program
was not entirely jettisoned from campus
until 1973.
The incident and its aftermath are em
blematic of Stanford's final clash with
ROTC: demonstrative, but slowly evolv
ing in away that relegated it to secondary
status among the campus community. As
the Faculty Senate currently considers
the possibility of bringing ROTC back to
Stanford, there is sure to be more debate
about the issue. A look back at the histo
ry of the ROTC debate, however, shows
that the controversy wasn't necessarily
over the program itself, but more about
actions undertaken in the Vietnam War
effort.
"My general sense was that ROTC
was subsumed over time and overshad
owed by other issues on campus," said
Phil Taubman '7O, a consulting professor
at the Center for International Security

and Cooperation and the Editor in Chief
of The Daily in 1969. "As the Vietnam
War expanded, student opposition in
creased."
As resistance mounted against a
largely unpopular war, Taubman said the
armed forces as a whole became synony

mous with the war. Universities were, in
particular, closely scrutinized, with the
belief that research on college campuses
was done to aid military efforts.
"The military got tagged in the minds
of many students as inimical to the tradi
tions and values of the university," Taub

man said. "ROTC was a whipping boy for
anti-war protests. It was an easy target."

Protesters demonstrated outside of Memorial Auditorium after a talk by then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Protests like
this would become common on campus, as students became more disgruntled with U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.


The Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) building was burned to the ground on a second attempt by arsonists.
Stanford completely phased out all ROTC programs from campus by 1973.
