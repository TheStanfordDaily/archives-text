# ROTC REVISITED

Alone building ablaze one
iconic image of students' dis
content with the United
States government and its
military in the late 19605.
In 1968, amid increased U.S. involve
ment in the Vietnam War and growing
protest among the student body, arsonists
twice attacked Stanford's Naval Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC) building,
successfully burning it to the ground on
their second attempt in May. Yet follow
ing investigations, authorities made no
arrests and could prove no student in
volvement.
Even as tensions approached a tipping
point, full-scale action on the ROTC was
not taken until 1970, and the program
was not entirely jettisoned from campus
until 1973.
The incident and its aftermath are em
blematic of Stanford's final clash with
ROTC: demonstrative, but slowly evolv
ing in away that relegated it to secondary
status among the campus community. As
the Faculty Senate currently considers
the possibility of bringing ROTC back to
Stanford, there is sure to be more debate
about the issue. A look back at the histo
ry of the ROTC debate, however, shows
that the controversy wasn't necessarily
over the program itself, but more about
actions undertaken in the Vietnam War
effort.
"My general sense was that ROTC
was subsumed over time and overshad
owed by other issues on campus," said
Phil Taubman '7O, a consulting professor
at the Center for International Security

and Cooperation and the Editor in Chief
of The Daily in 1969. "As the Vietnam
War expanded, student opposition in
creased."
As resistance mounted against a
largely unpopular war, Taubman said the
armed forces as a whole became synony

mous with the war. Universities were, in
particular, closely scrutinized, with the
belief that research on college campuses
was done to aid military efforts.
"The military got tagged in the minds
of many students as inimical to the tradi
tions and values of the university," Taub

man said. "ROTC was a whipping boy for
anti-war protests. It was an easy target."

pus movement against the war. Pro
claimed as a radical during his time
in office, Harris would go on to be
nationally known for his anti-war
demonstrations.
In 1966, Harris ran on a platform
that called for the elimination of
ROTC, but quickly saw the issue
take a back seat to the more pressing
topics of the day: equal rights for fe
male students and, of course, Viet
nam. He noted that while ROTC
protests still flared up on campus
during his time, action against
ROTC was slow to develop, sped up
only by the context of the war.
"It became more and more of an
issue the more that the war became
an issue," Harris said. "It would be
fair to say that there was at least half
a decade of build up to the decision
[to eliminate ROTC]."
While Vietnam remained the main
focus, it provided an avenue for Har
ris to address what he saw was an in

consistency between ROTC and
Stanford's scholarly mission.
"If you believe in the life of the
mind, you don't drop napalm on vil
lages," he said.
"The backdrop to all of this was
the Vietnam War, where very clearly
the military was engaging in acts that
were unacceptable in an academic
context," Harris continued. "The set
ting was Vietnam, but it was in some
way universal."
This "academic context" would
later become the grounds for
ROTC's removal from campus,
when members of the administration
argued that the military instructors
and core curriculum of the program
did not meet the intellectual stan
dards of the University.
William Perry, professor emeri
tus and the former Secretary of
State, and David M. Kennedy '63,
history professor emeritus, argued
for the reintroduction of ROTC on
campus last week before the Facul
ty Senate. Kennedy believed that
such academic arguments were de
batable then and are still debatable
today. Nevertheless, Kennedy ac
knowledged that the context of the

situation might have lent itself to
the removal of ROTC in the early
70s.
Kennedy said that the issue
"blew up" due to America's involve
ment in Cambodia, which began in
1969 and reached a height domesti
cally in 1970, when National
Guardsmen killed four student pro
testers at Kent State University.
Taubman indicated, as well, that
eventual change came from both
faculty and students.
Even then, according to Kennedy,
it took several months for Stanford
to negotiate the deal discontinuing
the ROTC program. After ROTC
lost its academic standing within the
University, it took an additional
three years for its presence to be en
tirely removed.
The impetus, as always, was clear.
"Back then, if you were against
the Vietnam War, you were almost
by definition against the military
services,"Taubman said. "The ROTC
program became a target."
"It was a perfect storm," he added.

nationally known for his anti-war
demonstrations.
In 1966, Harris ran on a platform
that called for the elimination of
ROTC, but quickly saw the issue
take a back seat to the more pressing
topics of the day: equal rights for fe
male students and, of course, Viet
nam. He noted that while ROTC
protests still flared up on campus
during his time, action against
ROTC was slow to develop, sped up
only by the context of the war.
"It became more and more of an
issue the more that the war became
an issue," Harris said. "It would be
fair to say that there was at least half
a decade of build up to the decision
[to eliminate ROTC]."
While Vietnam remained the main
focus, it provided an avenue for Har
ris to address what he saw was an in

consistency between ROTC and
Stanford's scholarly mission.
"If you believe in the life of the
mind, you don't drop napalm on vil
lages," he said.
"The backdrop to all of this was
the Vietnam War, where very clearly
the military was engaging in acts that
were unacceptable in an academic
context," Harris continued. "The set
ting was Vietnam, but it was in some
way universal."
This "academic context" would
later become the grounds for
ROTC's removal from campus,
when members of the administration
argued that the military instructors
and core curriculum of the program
did not meet the intellectual stan
dards of the University.
William Perry, professor emeri
tus and the former Secretary of
State, and David M. Kennedy '63,
history professor emeritus, argued
for the reintroduction of ROTC on
campus last week before the Facul
ty Senate. Kennedy believed that
such academic arguments were de
batable then and are still debatable
today. Nevertheless, Kennedy ac
knowledged that the context of the

situation might have lent itself to
the removal of ROTC in the early
70s.
Kennedy said that the issue
"blew up" due to America's involve
ment in Cambodia, which began in
1969 and reached a height domesti
cally in 1970, when National
Guardsmen killed four student pro
testers at Kent State University.
Taubman indicated, as well, that
eventual change came from both
faculty and students.
Even then, according to Kennedy,
it took several months for Stanford
to negotiate the deal discontinuing
the ROTC program. After ROTC
lost its academic standing within the
University, it took an additional
three years for its presence to be en
tirely removed.
The impetus, as always, was clear.
"Back then, if you were against
the Vietnam War, you were almost
by definition against the military
services,"Taubman said. "The ROTC
program became a target."
"It was a perfect storm," he added.
