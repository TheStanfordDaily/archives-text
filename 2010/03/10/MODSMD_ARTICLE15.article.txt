# Walking backward: A day in the life of a tour guide
## 
### JENNY THAI 
Ominously dark clouds
swirled in the sky. A gen
tle drizzle that had kept
up for several hours
paused, as if holding its
breath, before releasing another
sweeping spray of rain. It wasn't the
most ideal weather for a campus tour.
Despite the dreary weather, a clus
ter of about 20 high school students
trailed in front of Paige Romer 'l2,
who was calmly enumerating the five
founding tenets of Stanford.
"We have 8,100 acres of land here,"
Romer said, earning a multitude of
raised eyebrows and an impressed
whistle from the prospective students.
"To put it in perspective of just how
big our campus is, we can fit 26 Disney
lands right here on campus."
While passing through the Main
Quad, Romer skillfully dodged a pass
ing biker, maintaining her backward
gait without missing a step.
It was just a typical day for Romer,
one of the many Stanford student tour
guides.
Being a tour guide is not an easy
j ob, but students find it one of the most
rewarding. That is, if you make the cut.
"It's pretty hard to get in," Romer
said. "This year, I think we received al
most 200 applications, and only about
30 people were accepted."
The tour guide selection process is
a lengthy one. First, students are ex
pected to complete a very personal,
written application. Questions are
aimed to elicit more personal informa
tion from the potential guides, and
some are so unusual that they often
catch applicants off-guard.

"They ask really fun questions,"
said Caleb Joseph 'l2, a current tour
guide. "[One of] last year's questions
was to draw a type of T-shirt that we
should make for the tour guides. They
ask questions to tease out your per
sonality."

Following the written application
process, only a certain percentage of
applicants progress to the next stage:
the group interview. Byron Vosburg
'O9, a student manager for the Stan
ford student tour guides, refused to re
veal how many applicants were ac
cepted into the next round, saying it
varied from year to year.
Prospective tour guides are placed
in groups of eight to 10, where they are
all interviewed by a tour guide manag
er and several current tour guides. Ac
cording to current tour guides, the
group setting was a chance for the se
lection committee to assess the appli
cant's ability to present well and re-

spond quickly to various scenarios.
"Just like there is no set Stanford
student, there is no set successful tour
guide applicant," Vosburg said. "What
we're looking for are people with ef
fective communication skills."
The last step of the application
process is the private interview, where
applicants' memories are put to the
test as they present a prepared talk on
one of Stanford's landmarks and re
cite Stanford trivia. However, there is
more to being a tour guide than just
memorizing the history of the school's
founding.
"It's more about being able to re
cover from forgetting things," Joseph
explained. "If you've forgotten every
thing you've memorized, can you stay
in control? It's about wielding that in
formation and knowing what to do
when you forget it. If you have the
right kind of personality for this, the
facts aren't that important."
If an applicant makes it through
the selection process, he or she is then
deemed a Stanford tour guide. But
they are not home free yet.
They must then undergo a rigorous
training program. According to
Joseph, two of the most critical skills
are the ability to "feel out the crowd,"
or assess the audience's personality,
and to field awkward questions.
Joseph was no stranger to being
asked awkward questions, pointing to
the time a parent asked him about stu
dent sex life.
In addition to gracefully handling
persistent parents and speaking clear
ly, another important skill learned by
all tour guides is the ability to walk
backwards.
"Tourists are always impressed by
the walking backwards trick," Joseph
said. "It's really funny but for some
reason they love it. Every time I hop
upstairs backwards, they all gasp a lit
tle bit and then they applaud when I
reach the top."
Walking tour groups vary greatly in
size, ranging from one person to a
record-breaking party of 90 people.
The largest tourist groups usually
come in the summer, when the highest
number of prospective students and
tourists visit campus. Tour guides are
equipped with megaphones for such
occasions.
There are two kinds of walking
tours conducted. One tour is geared
toward tourists and features a general
overview of the Stanford campus as
well as a generous helping of Stanford
trivia. Another tour is tailored to
prospective students and their par
ents, supplemented with information
on the application process.
With so much pressure riding on
their shoulders in these situations, cur
rent guides realize that they have to
perform well.
"We are their sole link, especially
for tourists," Joseph said. "We are the
only information that they're going to
get while they're here. What's scary is
if I sound stupid during my tour, if I
stutter, I may as well be the only Stan
ford student that these people speak
to in their entire lives."
It seems that that pressure has
yielded positive results so far. Priya
Khangura, a junior at the University of
Michigan, had already made her col
lege choice, but nevertheless enjoyed
the Stanford tour.
"It highlighted the important as
pects of this school," she said. "It's
pretty comparable to other campus
tours, but I think I really like this cam
pus."
Bert Dempsey was on tour with his
wife and two daughters, one of whom
was two years away from making the
college try.
"This is actually our first college
tour, but I thought it was very good,"
he said. "The length was right â€”it
wasn't too long, and we got to learn a
lot of things about this campus."

Hoover Tower is one of the many stops on the student-led campus tours.
Tour guides undergo a competitive vetting process that includes an
extensive application process and group interviews before they are chosen.
Ominously dark clouds
swirled in the sky. A gen
tle drizzle that had kept
up for several hours
paused, as if holding its
breath, before releasing another
sweeping spray of rain. It wasn't the
most ideal weather for a campus tour.
Despite the dreary weather, a clus
ter of about 20 high school students
trailed in front of Paige Romer 'l2,
who was calmly enumerating the five
founding tenets of Stanford.
"We have 8,100 acres of land here,"
Romer said, earning a multitude of
raised eyebrows and an impressed
whistle from the prospective students.
"To put it in perspective of just how
big our campus is, we can fit 26 Disney
lands right here on campus."
While passing through the Main
Quad, Romer skillfully dodged a pass
ing biker, maintaining her backward
gait without missing a step.
It was just a typical day for Romer,
one of the many Stanford student tour
guides.
Being a tour guide is not an easy
j ob, but students find it one of the most
rewarding. That is, if you make the cut.
"It's pretty hard to get in," Romer
said. "This year, I think we received al
most 200 applications, and only about
30 people were accepted."
The tour guide selection process is
a lengthy one. First, students are ex
pected to complete a very personal,
written application. Questions are
aimed to elicit more personal informa
tion from the potential guides, and
some are so unusual that they often
catch applicants off-guard.

"They ask really fun questions,"
said Caleb Joseph 'l2, a current tour
guide. "[One of] last year's questions
was to draw a type of T-shirt that we
should make for the tour guides. They
ask questions to tease out your per
sonality."

Following the written application
process, only a certain percentage of
applicants progress to the next stage:
the group interview. Byron Vosburg
'O9, a student manager for the Stan
ford student tour guides, refused to re
veal how many applicants were ac
cepted into the next round, saying it
varied from year to year.
Prospective tour guides are placed
in groups of eight to 10, where they are
all interviewed by a tour guide manag
er and several current tour guides. Ac
cording to current tour guides, the
group setting was a chance for the se
lection committee to assess the appli
cant's ability to present well and re-

spond quickly to various scenarios.
"Just like there is no set Stanford
student, there is no set successful tour
guide applicant," Vosburg said. "What
we're looking for are people with ef
fective communication skills."
The last step of the application
process is the private interview, where
applicants' memories are put to the
test as they present a prepared talk on
one of Stanford's landmarks and re
cite Stanford trivia. However, there is
more to being a tour guide than just
memorizing the history of the school's
founding.
"It's more about being able to re
cover from forgetting things," Joseph
explained. "If you've forgotten every
thing you've memorized, can you stay
in control? It's about wielding that in
formation and knowing what to do
when you forget it. If you have the
right kind of personality for this, the
facts aren't that important."
If an applicant makes it through
the selection process, he or she is then
deemed a Stanford tour guide. But
they are not home free yet.
They must then undergo a rigorous
training program. According to
Joseph, two of the most critical skills
are the ability to "feel out the crowd,"
or assess the audience's personality,
and to field awkward questions.
Joseph was no stranger to being
asked awkward questions, pointing to
the time a parent asked him about stu
dent sex life.
In addition to gracefully handling
persistent parents and speaking clear
ly, another important skill learned by
all tour guides is the ability to walk
backwards.
"Tourists are always impressed by
the walking backwards trick," Joseph
said. "It's really funny but for some
reason they love it. Every time I hop
upstairs backwards, they all gasp a lit
tle bit and then they applaud when I
reach the top."
Walking tour groups vary greatly in
size, ranging from one person to a
record-breaking party of 90 people.
The largest tourist groups usually
come in the summer, when the highest
number of prospective students and
tourists visit campus. Tour guides are
equipped with megaphones for such
occasions.
There are two kinds of walking
tours conducted. One tour is geared
toward tourists and features a general
overview of the Stanford campus as
well as a generous helping of Stanford
trivia. Another tour is tailored to
prospective students and their par
ents, supplemented with information
on the application process.
With so much pressure riding on
their shoulders in these situations, cur
rent guides realize that they have to
perform well.
"We are their sole link, especially
for tourists," Joseph said. "We are the
only information that they're going to
get while they're here. What's scary is
if I sound stupid during my tour, if I
stutter, I may as well be the only Stan
ford student that these people speak
to in their entire lives."
It seems that that pressure has
yielded positive results so far. Priya
Khangura, a junior at the University of
Michigan, had already made her col
lege choice, but nevertheless enjoyed
the Stanford tour.
"It highlighted the important as
pects of this school," she said. "It's
pretty comparable to other campus
tours, but I think I really like this cam
pus."
Bert Dempsey was on tour with his
wife and two daughters, one of whom
was two years away from making the
college try.
"This is actually our first college
tour, but I thought it was very good,"
he said. "The length was right â€”it
wasn't too long, and we got to learn a
lot of things about this campus."
