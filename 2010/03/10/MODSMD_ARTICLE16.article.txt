## EDITORIAL Avoid living life as a 'resume-padder' 
### 
We at the Editorial Board challenge
ourselves and our readers to exam
ine how we spend our time and how
committed we are to the things we choose.
In this season of searching for jobs and in
ternships, we hope our peers make an effort
to be substantive in their pursuits. In environ
ments ranging from the academic to the pro
fessional, from the social to the residential, we
can all think of people we know who are
shameless "resume-padders," involving
themselves in countless organizations and ac
tivities for no other reason than to enhance
their reputations on paper, while never put
ting their full heart and soul into anything.
Many if not most Stanford students exhib
it a degree of dedication for causes and organ
izations outside of themselves. Whether they
are helping to organize charity events, serving
in student government or actively working
with various student groups, this campus is
filled with motivated and tenacious people.
Most of the time, you would be hard-pressed
to hear anything disparaging about those who
commit themselves to numerous forms of
campus activity and public service. What the
Editorial Board would like to suggest, howev
er, is that there is a distinct difference, if only
on a spiritual level, between those who com
mit themselves out of passion and those who
are simply trying to bolster their own image
and qualifications.
This issue is not black and white, by any
means. A great many students probably line

up somewhere in the middle, dividing their
time equally between the things they deeply
care about and the endeavors which serve
only to advance them from one point to an
other. Some students balance their class
schedules between the classes they love and
the ones they are only enduring to advance to
another level. Others may agree to work as an
intern in a business they dislike, but with the
mindset that it will one day help them be able
to do what they actually enjoy. You might
choose to follow someone on Linkedln,
knowing full well that you would never want
to follow that person on Facebook. These
kinds of things happen every day, and some
times they are necessary. What is most impor
tant to keep in mind, however, is that at this
point in our lives we are all still growing into
the people we will one day become, and it
would be very sad to spend this time connect
ing only to the people, organizations and ideas
that will be of benefit to us some other time.

With spring quarter approaching, graduat
ing seniors will be accepting job offers while
most other undergraduates commit to sum
mer internships. While this is always a stress
ful and uncertain time of the year, the Editor
ial Board hopes that all students on campus,
"resume-padders" included, will keep in
mind that the true value of a person or expe
rience is not always determined by what value
they can be to you in the future, but rather by
what can be attained here in the present mo
ment.
