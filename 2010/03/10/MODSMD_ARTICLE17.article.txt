# Bunning, GOP appeal to outdated ideals
## 
### 
Last week, the estimated 1.2 million
Americans currently receiving feder
al unemployment were almost left
without recourse, as it appeared that Con
gress would not be able to extend their ben
efits by the necessary deadline. Fortunately,
Congress was able to push through the jobs
bill, but only after reaching a deal with lone
Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY), whose fili
bustering had placed the bill's passage in
jeopardy.The Editorial Board is glad to see
that benefits for the unemployed were ex
tended, but we also fear that Bunning's
voice and those of his mindset will continue
to block needed relief efforts in the future.
The most alarming aspect of this failed
filibuster is that it has rallied economic ide
ologues even more extreme than Bunning
himself Bunning's own statements re
veal that he does not oppose unemploy
ment benefits on principle, but simply felt it
was irresponsible to pass a jobs bill that
would further contribute to the federal
deficit. In contrast, two public figures who
have come to Bunning's defense since he
first started the filibuster Former House
Majority Leader Tom Delay (R-TX) and
Senator Jon Kyi (R-AZ) have used the
debate over the jobs bill to attack public re
lief efforts on the ideological front. Delay,
appearing on CNN, warned that "unem
ployment benefits [keep] people from
going and finding jobs" while Kyi declared
on the Senate floor that "continuing to pay
people unemployment compensation is a
disincentive for them to seek new work."
These assertions by Delay and Kyi are
nothing new. In fact, they represent a very

old and rigid political mindset that blames
government programs for eliminating the
incentive of people to work while appealing
to market forces to correct everything.
What is so alarming is that, even as nation
al unemployment remains consistently at
10 percent or higher, public figures like
Delay and Kyi are still able to appeal to
these outdated arguments to push their
party's agenda. The problem is not that the
unemployed do not have incentive to work
the problem is that the American econo
my has failed to sustain the number of
workers seeking employment in the United
States. The latest estimates show that for
every available job in America, there are six
workers seeking employment. It is not a
problem of incentive, but a problem of the
demand for employment dwarfing the real
ity of what the job market really has to
offer.
Continued deficit spending is an unsus
tainable problem, and Bunning is right to
be concerned about its long-term dangers.
But he and his Republican colleagues can
not prevent the government from providing
essential funds to the millions of unem
ployed workers in America. Nor can they
continue to appeal to outdated rhetoric
about incentive and motivation when the
American worker continues to seek em
ployment, only to find that American indus
try and American business have nothing
available for them. If Congress is really seri
ous about cutting back on unemployment
spending, then it should commit itself to find
ing a real solution for reviving this lumbering
giant that we call the economy.
