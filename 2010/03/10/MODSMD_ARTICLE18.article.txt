# JUST A THOUGHT
## Can Mexican food be better than sex? 
### Nikola Milanovic 
Given that it is now officially Dead
Week, and most people reading this
newspaper are struggling frantically
to reconcile the demands of their classes with
their procrastination, some light reading is in
order. Discarding the more cerebral topics of
moral philosophy and social psychology for
some culinary advice is the best way to ac
complish this. Specifically: burritos.
The nice part of being a columnist is that I
can write exclusively about my personal life
and pretend people care or I can make at
tempts to indoctrinate students to my politi
cal beliefs through 750-word snippets, like
some columnists. I could depart from the nor
mal litany of cynical armchair reflection to
write a poetic ode to the United States of
America. Or 1 could use my writing to pen an
incendiary commentary about blowjobs and
male domination in an effort to extrapolate
my personal experience onto an entire gen
der. Instead, I'll use this space to help out
other burrito fanatics.
I am from the east coast. Accordingly, I
like boat shoes/shorts dotted with lobsters,

old money elitism and Massachusetts De
mocrats Republicans. One west coast import
I allowed into my cozy mid-Atlantic sphere,
however, was Chipotle. As such, I was aston
ished to arrive at Stanford and meet a local
named Danny Zuckerman who passionately
hated Chipotle. With his help, I went on a
whirlwind tour of all the Mexican outlets the
immediate area had to offer (on the ASSU's
dollar, too so that's where your Special
Fees are going). He and I now hope to give
you a survival guide to locating good burritos
around Stanford.
Danny lists four aspects to consider in a
Mexican restaurant: "price, proximity, au
thenticity, atmosphere." In a burrito: "the in

gredients' temperature, whether they are
mixed or clumped, quality of meat, variety of
salsas ..." Also, Danny's own criteria: is the
last bite the best? "It should be because all of
the sauces from the meat, salsa, guacamole,
sour cream and beans should sink down to
the bottom [... ]so the last bite should have
everything plus the extra juices that make a
burrito taste good in the first place." Now
onto the spots ...
The Best On-Campus Burrito Award: The
only thing I like more than cheap Mexican
labor and cheap Mexican vacation destina
tions is cheap Mexican food, and it doesn't
come any cheaper than Jimmy V's, which has
burrito day every Thursday for $5. Added
bonus: ask them to grill your tortilla.
Best Convenience Burritos Award (a
quick drive): Taqueria El Grullense on El
Camino Real. A "truly authentic" restaurant
with a sister (or hermana, as they say in Mex
ican) taqueria in Redwood City listed among
the top 20 burrito joints in the Bay Area. Fre-

quented by possible gang members,
so possibly not the safest eatery.
Great salsa bar, though. A close run
ner-up: Sancho's, a brand new outlet
in downtown Palo Alto, with the eas
iest good burritos to get to. Also, de
licious fish tacos.
Best Local Sit-Down Award:
Sometimes eating good burritos
just can't be accomplished while
standing. Celia's is a great alterna
tive for those who like to sit down
for their food. A good bar, great
menu and authenticity all add to the
experience. So whether you're
looking for a good place to have a
sit-in to protest a janitor's firing, or
you just can't rise to the occasion,
try Celia's.
Best Burritos Around (Danny's
vote): Karlita's on Woodside Road.
The biggest, best stuffed, and defi
nitely sloppiest burrito you'll ever
have. Don't make plans for the night
afterwards unless they include a
restroom. The taqueria at Chavez

Supermarket in Redwood City
boasts the best meat around (they
take out a slab of meat and chop it up
right in front of you), huge quesadil
las and steamed tortillas. The down
side: no free chips and salsa, and also
relatively expensive (though, to be
fair, this is relative to that taco truck
that drives around campus at noon).
Finally, Taqueria Los Charros of
Castro St. in Mountain View.
Best Burritos Around (my vote):
La Costena, a Mexican supermarket
and burrito factory conveniently lo
cated in Mountain View. You'll think
you died and went to heaven, but
then they realized it was not your
time, so they sent you to Mexico in
stead.
Finally, the Worst Burritos
Award: shared by the place inTresid
der, The Treehouse, Uno Mas and
the worst of the worst: Chipotle. In
Danny's words (as he wants them in
his epitaph): "A good burrito does
not start with a McDonald's brand
ing or end with white rice." Thank
you, west coast, for teaching me that
Chipotle is the Kesha of burritos.

I want my epitaph to say "Seacrest,
out." nikm@stanford. edu.
