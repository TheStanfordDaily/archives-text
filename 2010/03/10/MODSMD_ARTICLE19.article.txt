# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## Reflection During Finals 
### Aysha Bagchi 
I generally enjoy being a student, but finals
time is a consistent exception. The last
week or so of the quarter means a lot of
pressure, not nearly enough time, at least one
moment of panic, inevitable disappointments
and dorms and dining halls filled with students
in a generally depressed state which is de
pressing. Until finals are over, students are
submerged in a torrent of mounting to-dos
that leave little time to think.
It is a big shame that the last couple weeks
of the quarter are not conducive to reflection.
It would be nice if our educational structure
encouraged us to make sense of what we have
learned, to step back and think in the open air.
Synthesizing a quarter's worth of material in a
way that gives us a holistic understanding re
quires some breathing room, and the intense
structure of Finals Week depletes our oxygen
supply.
Unfortunately, students do not have much
power to change this. The experience may
partly be the consequence of all of our profes
sors trying to assert their classes as the most
important in our schedule by demanding
more from us than could reasonably be multi
plied by four or five classes. We are left with a
series of courses that all hope to dominate our
schedules, which becomes especially tough
during finals. Add to that the responsibilities
students carry outside of schoolwork, as well
as our social activities, and we find expecta
tions that are often unrealistic and encourage
some to flounder.
So what are we students to do? In this case,

even the best is bad.There isn't much of a rem
edy in our hands, but I can think of one useful
suggestion: dedicate at least a little time each
day over the next couple weeks to forgetting
about all the material you are supposed to
cram into your head. Take some time to relax,
reflect and remember that a lot of things are
important in your life and your grades are just
one of them. Insert some breathing room into
the end of your quarter!
What this breathing room will look like
depends on the student, but for everyone it
begs for some outlet, some protected space
of comfort and calm. Take a walk around
Lake Lag (there is still water in it, and prob
ably not for long!). Listen to music. Read part
of a favorite book. Play the piano in your
lounge. Meet up with friends for some finals
free downtime. Go on a date. Write poetry.
Meditate, pray or savor some sweet silent
thought. Write in your diary. Read a Daily
column (that's one down!). Remove yourself
from schoolwork for a little while and re
member the many other important things in
your life that deserve attention even during
times of overload.
One of the things I love about writing a col
umn is that it forces me to reflect on my life as
a student each week.This is not always an easy
task, especially during hectic times, and I prob
ably would not do it as often if I did not have a
deadline to force me. Student life is scheduled,
our days are full and most of us are running
behind. But nonetheless, breathing space has a
rightful claim in our lives!

Now, I am not kidding myself into thinking
students can just head to the woods when an
o-chem final or a 20-page research paper is
around the corner. It is reasonable that
schoolwork takes some priority, and our less
reflection-filled social lives are also important.
But reflection should be up there as some
thing we need regularly especially during
our toughest weeks. Sometimes removal and
reflection is the way to subvert a real crisis, like
deciding to forget your schoolwork altogether
or getting seriously depressed when a final
does not go as planned. Some calm downtime
will make finals less painful and the risks at
tending them less serious.
So break past the surface of your sub
merged life and take a few moments each day
over the next two weeks to put things in a lit
tle perspective! I can see it now thousands
of Stanford students lying on the lawns of the
Oval, pondering beside Rodin's Thinker at
Cantor, jamming at the CoHo all day... But
wait a second! Before you close all your books
and head for the beach, don't get carried away:
remember you do actually have finals to study
for!
