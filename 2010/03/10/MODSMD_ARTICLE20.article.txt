# STRANGELY CHARMING
## Insomnia Week 
### Jack Cackler 
Up to this point, my columns have
hopefully been educational and en
tertaining, but perhaps not immedi
ately applicable to most of your everyday
lives. And while I would be thrilled if my
writing inspired one of you to a lifelong voy
age of scientific exploration, I can also un
derstand that some of you may already have
plans (for life, that is).To this end, I'd like to
write about a subject that each of you can re
search every day! Particularly in light of the
fact that this is Dead Week, it seems like a
great time to talk about modern research on
sleep.
Despite the fact that all humans spend
nearly a third of their life sleeping, scientists
have only recently begun to understand
sleep in terms of its purpose and function.
While it's easy to piece apart a cadaver to
study most other organs, sleep is inherently a

function of the brain, and understanding
how 30 billion neurons work in harmony can
be a daunting task (despite years of field re
search, I am still trying to understand the
minds of individuals with two X chromo
somes). To aid this problem electroen
cephalography (EEG), or "electric brain
mapping," is incredibly useful. Scientists un
derstood since the late 1800s that neurons
communicated via electric signals and, using
this knowledge, Hans Berger developed
EEG in the mid 19205. His device consisted
of two simple silver wires, attached to the
front and the back of the head and then con
nected to a galvanometer that measured the
activity between the two. EEGs have gotten
much more sophisticated since then and can
now, aided with knowledge of what different
components of the brain do, be used to ana
lyze many more aspects of human thought.
One of the main things EEG allowed re
searchers to study was overall brain activity.
While awake, the human brain consumes
around a quarter of all the energy the body
uses, despite weighing only about two per
cent of the average human body. Or, more
plainly, the average brain cell gets 12 times
its fair share of energy. As an illustration,
even with our fancy linear accelerators, the
average Stanford student uses only about
three times the global energy average
(which is still more than one, so keep con
serving!). Because being awake is so ener
getically draining, during sleep the brain
drastically lowers its energy consumption, in
several different stages, which can be moni
tored through EEG. The first four stages en
tail sequentially deeper sleep, marked by re
duced energy output, but, curiously, in the
deepest sleep, brain activity suddenly jumps
up to near wakefulness. This, of course, indi
cates dreaming, and the associated Rapid
Eye Movement (REM) sleep was first docu
mented by Dr. William Dement, the beloved
Stanford professor of "Sleep and Dreams"
a class I highly recommend.
The exact function of each stage of sleep
is still not well understood. On the whole, by
freeing up energy from the brain, sleep
greatly aids the body's immune system,
wound healing and growth processes. Addi
tionally, sleep aids hormone regulation, al
lowing effective control over weight and
alertness levels, among other things. Other
studies indicate that sleep might aid the

brain in organizing thoughts into memories
and thereby aid learning. Lack of sleep can
have disastrous effects on judgment. Both
the Challenger explosion and the Exxon-
Valdez oil spill may have been avoided had
those involved with each been well-rested.
Several recent repeated studies have indi
cated that pulling even one all-nighter can
impair driving performance worse than a .10
percent BAC. So while sleep isn't fully un
derstood, it's definitely a good thing to get
on a regular basis.
Unfortunately, basic math works against
Stanford students. With an average of 15
units a quarter, students are expected to
spend 15 units in class, plus 45 out of class, for
a total of 60 hours a week on school work, as
a very rough lower bound. Given that many
students are involved in one or two student
organizations, possibly a sports team and a
job or a research position, roughly tacking
on 10 hours a week for each of those brings
the total up to 100. Adding in six hours on
weekends to socialize and at minimum two
hours a day for meals, showering, and any
thing else in life, the total comes to 120 hours,
yielding 48 for sleep —or barely under
seven hours a day. While these are all rough
calculations, the fact remains that the odds
are stacked against us getting anything re
sembling a reasonable amount of sleep.
While I wouldn't give up a second of my
busy Stanford life, we all need more sleep.
Perhaps we suffer from hubris; as successful
Stanford students, surely we can wade
through the waters of drowsiness unscathed.
It's amazing how Stanford students take
meticulous care of physical, mental and aca
demic health, and yet routinely neglect
sleep. I hope the above examples have illus
trated the flaw in this logic, and I encourage
you all, even during Dead Week, to develop
healthy sleep habits. At least, a man can
dream.

The clock right now says that Jack is an incredi
ble hypocrite. Tell him to go to bed at
