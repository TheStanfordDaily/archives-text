## "Watch Your Language, Young Lady!" Part II 
### Yanran Lu 
Yanran asks that you read the article with a British
accent: "I am not British by any means, but since
the article might otherwise lack 'proprietyread
ing it with a British accent might just add some 'le
gitimacy. '"
So I am a woman talking about sex. To be spe
cific, I am an Asian woman, a species that has
been sexualized because of our "submis
sion," talking about sex. I am not sure how this
particular status contributes to my voice as I ap
proach this rather tantalizing subject. In addition,
I am not sure whether people take offense to the
fact that the silent, obedient Asian woman is
speaking, or the vulgar language I used to express
my "disobedience" or my lack of English abilities
to which I am hanging on for dear life as I try
to express sexuality, since I was never taught
about it in my native language.
As I search for a new, more "appropriate" lan
guage to talk about sex, I am lost for words. Some
how "cunnilingus" or "fellatio" does not quite
have the same ring to it. Besides not knowing their
meanings, they sound like some obscure kinky sex
ual act when they come up on the college "Purity
Test."Therefore, I want to ask, is it not appropriate
to use the "everyday" language when we are ap
proaching an "everyday" subject? We have no
problem in introducing "technical" terms such as
"isomorphism," "confirmation bias" or "diminish
ing marginal utility" into our conversation. In fact
we are quite proud when we do that and laugh, "we
are such Stanford students." Yet how are we so un
comfortable introducing "everyday" language
into "elevated" media such as the school newspa
per? Would it potentially "dumb" us down? Or are

we carrying the same mentality as the high school
guy who swore off pink shirts because it might "di
minish his masculinity"?
Would "everyday" sex language in public
media make us vulgar and break down the eco
nomic and social barriers we so desperately build
all the time? What I mean by it is when we imagine
a respected person (such as a CEO or the presi
dent) in the middle of a sexual act without
clothes, imperfections unabashedly displayed,
drenched in sweat while making faces only made
in agony yet claiming the most divine pleasure
the person's presence is almost silly. In a weird
way, sex becomes something that breaks bound
aries: no matter if we wear Gucci or No Bound
aries (a Wal-Mart brand) in public, we still perform
the same primal act. Nothing about the act pre
serves "manners," "propriety" or other distinc
tions among humans. A king making love is just as
obscure as a peasant making love.
Of course, people argue, we are not prude peo
ple and we talk about sex. We just need to talk
about it using "appropriate" language in "appro
priate" settings. We have to address it in a scholar
ly and intellectual way. We can examine the veloc
ity of semen in projectile motion or the numbers of

chemicals lighting up in our brain, but talking
"dirty" is something we are not capable of or al
lowed to do in public. This is not just for sex
when we talk about anything, it is not enough that
we arrive at the same result. We have to agree on
the means by which we derive the result, too. My
critics and I have argued like Catholics and Protes
tants though our intentions are the same, as if
there is only one (correct) way to reach G-d (of
course, let us not forget the Muslims and the Jews,
too).
In that light, perhaps my claim that sex breaks
down economic and social barriers is not true.
Certainly a yoga practitioner is capable of a more
dynamic range of sexual positions; an open
minded and rich person will have surgical-grade
silicon or even gold toys; and a religious person
has Jesus or G-d in the bedroom while they are
doing the deed. When we carry social markers to
a place that supposedly exposes us to our utmost
basic selves, it is only reasonable to ask: is the so
cial and economic structure an innate part of the
human makeup, or is it something so ingrained
into our brain that we feel uncomfortable letting
go of it the lack of it making us feel naked?
Are we not yet comfortable in just our own skin?
Do we have to look at our bodies and imperfec
tions through a veil of "propriety?" What would
be left of us when we are stripped away of the
decorative feathers of social and economic mark
ers? I certainly hope I would not look like your
Thanksgiving dinner.

To defend her opinion that social pretense is a ridicu
lous idea, you will never, ironically, catch
yanran@stanford.edu "naked" without her words.
