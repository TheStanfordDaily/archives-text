## Bhandari to become ASSU financial chief MS&E graduate student will oversee $14 million 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Raj Bhandari, a graduate student
in management science and engineer
ing, is eager to step up as the new
ASSU Financial Manager and CEO
of Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE), the financial branch of the
ASSU. Bhandari's ascension will take
place in July when Matt McLaughlin
'OB ends his two-year term.
Bhandari M.S. 'lO will manage a
staff of 50 student employees and
oversee $l4 million, including $5 mil
lion that constitutes the ASSU en
dowment, which is invested by the
Stanford Management Company, and
$7 million allocated to student groups.
Bhandari expressed enthusiasm
for his new job, describing SSE as an
organization "run off the energy of
the students" and his staff as "some of
the smartest and best students at
Stanford."
While he is excited to bring his ex
perience as a graduate student to
SSE, Bhandari sees his role as mainly
motivational.
"I want to allow the student em
ployees to define SSE," Bhandari
said. "My job is to allocate and moti
vate people to do what they want."
Bhandari also praised McLaugh
lin's tenure.
"Matt is like our Obama, coming
into a business when the stock mar
kets were crashing and keeping things
running," he said.
Bhandari commended McLaugh
lin's efforts to expand interest in SSE
and increase the number of applicants
for SSE jobs, despite the difficult eco

nomic conditions the organization
faced.
One ongoing issue that Bhandari
will inherit from McLaughlin is the re
cent spike in refund requests from
students, which has risen from an av
erage of 500 undergraduates per
quarter in two prior years to 1,132 un
dergraduates this winter. The spike
pushed McLaughlin to enforce a 2004
ASSU by-law that allows up to 10 per
cent of the requested refund money
to be covered by a buffer fund. Be
yond that amount, refunds come out
of the groups' budgets. Prior to this
year, the by-law never came into play,
McLaughlin said.

"I want to allow the student employees
to define SSE," Bhandari said. A
University of Pennsylania alumnus,
he is set to replace current ASSU financial
manager Matt McLaughlin
'08 in July after a two-year stint.
