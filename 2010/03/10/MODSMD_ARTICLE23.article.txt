## Herkovic: Google Books is 'too useful to fail' 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is currently in a partnership
with Google to help digitize millions of
books for the online Google Books data
base, an effort thathasanimmense poten
tial to democratize access to literature and
knowledge. Google has scanned more
than L7 rnilhon books owned by Stanford
in the last five years and hopes to scan mil
lions more over the next decade. More
than two dozen major libraries around
the world have signed on to the project
The University last month con
firmed its support of the Google Book
Search Settlement Agreement, which
Google and copyright owners had
brought before a federal court. The new
settlement made modifications to the
original agreement, which was reached
in 2008 as a resolution to separate law
suits filed by the Authors Guild and the
Association of American Publishers in
2005 accusing Google of "massive copy
right infringement."
Under the 303-page amended set
tlement, Google would make a one
time payment of $125 million to rights
holders, authors and publishers to
negate liability for materials that have
already been scanned, searched and
made available online. Part of the pay
ment would also be devoted to the es
tablishment of an independent non
profit entity called the Book Rights
Registry, which would collect revenue
from third-party users of Google Books
content and transfer that revenue to
rights holders.
The settlement would enable
Google to continue scanning and dis
playing books under the condition that
the company turn over 63 percent of its

net revenues from advertising to rights
holders One of the key features of the
agreement would be Google's ability to
make considerable use of out-of-print
and "orphan" works which are out-of
print but still protected under copyright
law; revenues from these works would
be mediated through the new Book
Rights Registry.
The settlement also contains provi
sions for the establishment of institu
tional and public access subscription
systems, which would enable compa
nies, colleges and individuals to have ac
cess to the Google Books catalog.
If the settlement is approved, Stan
ford will become a Fully Participating
Library in the Google Books effort,
which would expand its current access
to the Google Book catalog.
Andrew Herkovic, director of com
munications and development at Stan
ford Libraries, called the Google Books
project "too useful to fail. I believe that
something useful, if not perfect, will
come out of the court.''
Herkovic spoke with The Daily
about Stanford's relationship with
Google, the new settlement and the fu
ture of the Google Books project. Here
is an edited excerpt.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did
Stanford first begin its relationship with
Google Book Search?
Andrew Herkovic (AH): As you know,
Stanford Libraries has been digitizing
materials for many years, but on a very
small scale —generally for special pur
poses or projects In about2oo2,Univer
sity Librarian Mike Keller was at a re
treat at the home of Paul Allen, the Mi
crosoft co-founder, and found himself in
conversation with Larry Page [M.S. '9B],

the co-founder of Google, in which they
found that they were both very interest
ed in the idea of the mass digitization of
books to unleash the information sitting
on library shelves That may not have it
self started the Google Book Search
project, but it put us in a position so that
when Google got serious about it in
2003, they immediately started talking
to Stanford about our participation and
discussion about how to go about such a
plan. So we were one of the first five li
braries that were on board when
Google went public with this in 2004.
TSD: How does the Google Book
Search subscription work?
AH: If the settlement goes through,
the Fully Participating Libraries will
have access to at least all of the content
that they provided. Furthermore,
under the settlement, every library will
have the right to one terminal, so to
speak [i.e. for one simultaneous user].
Individuals unaffiliated with the insti
tutions would be able to buy access to
Google Books on a pay-as-you-go
basis or various, not yet fully articulat
ed subscription schemes. If the settle
ment is approved, Stanford students
on campus would not need to pay any
thing for access.
Someone in the community unaffil
iated with Stanford would have the op
portunity to seek a terminal in a Palo
Alto library or would be able to seek a
terminal on the Stanford campus and
would have equivalent rights of any
one on the campus I believe that to
be true.

TSD: Could you describe some of the
features of the Google Book Search
database and what is convenient about
using the database?
AH: The great power of Google Book
Search is in search. And the power to
search any book is a powerful tool. If the
settlement goes through, there will be a
lot of full texts available, depending on
how authors and publishers individual
ly react. In general, the public will be
able to read, instead of snippets, some
thing like up to 20 percent of the text of
the particular book that is under copy
right, and they would be able to read 100
percent of the text of the book that is out
of copyright. The terms of the settle
ment have been limited to books pub
lished in the United States, Canada, the
United Kingdom and Australia.
Unfortunately, we're not talking
about every book. We're only talking
about books published in those coun
tries where the author or publisher has
not opted out. That's a huge limitation
on the power of the system. But we're
looking at access to a lot of full texts, but
not as much as we would hope in an
ideal system. But a lot more than would
have been possible under the original
settlement with Google.
TSD: How has the Stanford alumni
connection to Google affected Stan
ford's relationship with Google?
AH: The fact that Larry and Sergey
[Brin M.S. '95 Ph.D.'9B] are closely asso
ciated with the Stanford computer sci-


BRIAN HOWALD/The Stanford Daily
ence department —Google was, in fact,
bom here certainly played a role.
Among other things, it made it easier to
develop and maintain good communica
tion between the Stanford Libraries and
Google. The other university that is most
similar to Stanford in commitment and
scope in Google Book Search is the Uni
versity of Michigan. They are quantita
tively ahead of us, and they have been
very public in support of this It may be no
coincidence that Larry Page himself was
an undergraduate there. The possibility
that personal relationships and contacts
greased the wheels cannot be dismissed.
TSD: Since Stanford became involved in
Google Book Search in 2003, how has
that relationship developed over time?
AH: All the library partners of Google
Book Search meet twice a year, and it's a
really interesting gathering to look at the
problems and the opportunities and solu
tions. And Stanford has participated
wholeheartedly in those partner meet
ings. There is kind of a level playing field
among all of the library partners, except
that many of those partners have pretty
tight restrictions on how much they are
willing to do and how far out on a limb
they are willing to go. Harvard and the
New York Public Library, who were two
of the original five, were very, very cau
tious in terms of what material they were
willing to provide. Stanford has been
much more gung-ho. Stanford has been

deeply involved in participating in the
forming the public good side of the Book
Search settlement. We've been working
with Google in a pretty authentic partner
ship to make the most of that. Our rela
tionship has matured in the sense of pro
viding a great deal of advice and involve
ment in how Google is going forward.
TSD: Are there any negative ways in
which the Google Books agreement af
fects Stanford?
AH: Are there downsides for us? The
major downside to the settlement as we
understand it is that it remains silent on
the subject of books that remain outside
of the scope of the settlement, which is to
say books published everywhere except
in English-speaking countries We have
material at Stanford that is not in English,
and we're scanning that material. But
how freely that material becomes accessi
ble by the open Web is less certain.That is
a definite downside of the settlement.
Whether that will definitely bite Stanford,
I don't know.
TSD: How has the scanning process been
organized? Have there been problems?
AH: It's a considerable or logistical —
nightmare to move thousands of books
from campus over to Google, return
them, get them back on the shelf And, in
fact, each book, after it has been selected
off of the shell] is checked out as if Google
were a person... Google itself has its
own controls, but the labor is being con
ducted mainly by Google people with a
considerable amount of oversight and re
view by Stanford [Libraries].There have
certainly been glitches. Our books are in
so many places; there have certainly been

access issues. Elevators that are smaller or
larger than our book trucks have really
been logistical problems in a really large-

scale project. I would say that overall
we've had a very successful working rela
tionship with Google staff
TSD: Do you think the growth of
Google Book Search reflects the devel
opment of a more autodidactic society?
AH; In its ideal state, [the] Google Books
Search service making vast numbers of
books available to the public to be
searched and, to some extent, to be read,
can be understood as a huge step forward
in the democratization of information.
And doing so essentially means that if
you are a student at East Podunk Com
munity College, that you will have access
to millions of books, as does the Stanford
student. There is a powerful argument
that that really makes possible the im
provement of that person's potential
horizons and prospects for education.
And if they're not a student at all, but
rather a citizen, it could be very empow
ering for it to be assumed that vast num
bers of books are at their fingertips. [... ]
We really hope that it will have the ef
fect of making people better aware of
differences in quality in available infor
mation. A lot of the stuff on the Web is
hard to distinguish in terms of its quality
of truthfulness. Books, of course, have
the same problem, but to know that a
book was held by Stanford or the Uni
versity of Michigan gives it a certain au
thenticity that a Web site or Joe Moe's
blog cannot.

tial to democratize access to literature and
knowledge. Google has scanned more
than L7 rnilhon books owned by Stanford
in the last five years and hopes to scan mil
lions more over the next decade. More
than two dozen major libraries around
the world have signed on to the project
The University last month con
firmed its support of the Google Book
Search Settlement Agreement, which
Google and copyright owners had
brought before a federal court. The new
settlement made modifications to the
original agreement, which was reached
in 2008 as a resolution to separate law
suits filed by the Authors Guild and the
Association of American Publishers in
2005 accusing Google of "massive copy
right infringement."
Under the 303-page amended set
tlement, Google would make a one
time payment of $125 million to rights
holders, authors and publishers to
negate liability for materials that have
already been scanned, searched and
made available online. Part of the pay
ment would also be devoted to the es
tablishment of an independent non
profit entity called the Book Rights
Registry, which would collect revenue
from third-party users of Google Books
content and transfer that revenue to
rights holders.
The settlement would enable
Google to continue scanning and dis
playing books under the condition that
the company turn over 63 percent of its

net revenues from advertising to rights
holders One of the key features of the
agreement would be Google's ability to
make considerable use of out-of-print
and "orphan" works which are out-of
print but still protected under copyright
law; revenues from these works would
be mediated through the new Book
Rights Registry.
The settlement also contains provi
sions for the establishment of institu
tional and public access subscription
systems, which would enable compa
nies, colleges and individuals to have ac
cess to the Google Books catalog.
If the settlement is approved, Stan
ford will become a Fully Participating
Library in the Google Books effort,
which would expand its current access
to the Google Book catalog.
Andrew Herkovic, director of com
munications and development at Stan
ford Libraries, called the Google Books
project "too useful to fail. I believe that
something useful, if not perfect, will
come out of the court.''
Herkovic spoke with The Daily
about Stanford's relationship with
Google, the new settlement and the fu
ture of the Google Books project. Here
is an edited excerpt.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did
Stanford first begin its relationship with
Google Book Search?
Andrew Herkovic (AH): As you know,
Stanford Libraries has been digitizing
materials for many years, but on a very
small scale —generally for special pur
poses or projects In about2oo2,Univer
sity Librarian Mike Keller was at a re
treat at the home of Paul Allen, the Mi
crosoft co-founder, and found himself in
conversation with Larry Page [M.S. '9B],

the co-founder of Google, in which they
found that they were both very interest
ed in the idea of the mass digitization of
books to unleash the information sitting
on library shelves That may not have it
self started the Google Book Search
project, but it put us in a position so that
when Google got serious about it in
2003, they immediately started talking
to Stanford about our participation and
discussion about how to go about such a
plan. So we were one of the first five li
braries that were on board when
Google went public with this in 2004.
TSD: How does the Google Book
Search subscription work?
AH: If the settlement goes through,
the Fully Participating Libraries will
have access to at least all of the content
that they provided. Furthermore,
under the settlement, every library will
have the right to one terminal, so to
speak [i.e. for one simultaneous user].
Individuals unaffiliated with the insti
tutions would be able to buy access to
Google Books on a pay-as-you-go
basis or various, not yet fully articulat
ed subscription schemes. If the settle
ment is approved, Stanford students
on campus would not need to pay any
thing for access.
Someone in the community unaffil
iated with Stanford would have the op
portunity to seek a terminal in a Palo
Alto library or would be able to seek a
terminal on the Stanford campus and
would have equivalent rights of any
one on the campus I believe that to
be true.

TSD: Could you describe some of the
features of the Google Book Search
database and what is convenient about
using the database?
AH: The great power of Google Book
Search is in search. And the power to
search any book is a powerful tool. If the
settlement goes through, there will be a
lot of full texts available, depending on
how authors and publishers individual
ly react. In general, the public will be
able to read, instead of snippets, some
thing like up to 20 percent of the text of
the particular book that is under copy
right, and they would be able to read 100
percent of the text of the book that is out
of copyright. The terms of the settle
ment have been limited to books pub
lished in the United States, Canada, the
United Kingdom and Australia.
Unfortunately, we're not talking
about every book. We're only talking
about books published in those coun
tries where the author or publisher has
not opted out. That's a huge limitation
on the power of the system. But we're
looking at access to a lot of full texts, but
not as much as we would hope in an
ideal system. But a lot more than would
have been possible under the original
settlement with Google.
TSD: How has the Stanford alumni
connection to Google affected Stan
ford's relationship with Google?
AH: The fact that Larry and Sergey
[Brin M.S. '95 Ph.D.'9B] are closely asso
ciated with the Stanford computer sci-


BRIAN HOWALD/The Stanford Daily
ence department —Google was, in fact,
bom here certainly played a role.
Among other things, it made it easier to
develop and maintain good communica
tion between the Stanford Libraries and
Google. The other university that is most
similar to Stanford in commitment and
scope in Google Book Search is the Uni
versity of Michigan. They are quantita
tively ahead of us, and they have been
very public in support of this It may be no
coincidence that Larry Page himself was
an undergraduate there. The possibility
that personal relationships and contacts
greased the wheels cannot be dismissed.
TSD: Since Stanford became involved in
Google Book Search in 2003, how has
that relationship developed over time?
AH: All the library partners of Google
Book Search meet twice a year, and it's a
really interesting gathering to look at the
problems and the opportunities and solu
tions. And Stanford has participated
wholeheartedly in those partner meet
ings. There is kind of a level playing field
among all of the library partners, except
that many of those partners have pretty
tight restrictions on how much they are
willing to do and how far out on a limb
they are willing to go. Harvard and the
New York Public Library, who were two
of the original five, were very, very cau
tious in terms of what material they were
willing to provide. Stanford has been
much more gung-ho. Stanford has been

deeply involved in participating in the
forming the public good side of the Book
Search settlement. We've been working
with Google in a pretty authentic partner
ship to make the most of that. Our rela
tionship has matured in the sense of pro
viding a great deal of advice and involve
ment in how Google is going forward.
TSD: Are there any negative ways in
which the Google Books agreement af
fects Stanford?
AH: Are there downsides for us? The
major downside to the settlement as we
understand it is that it remains silent on
the subject of books that remain outside
of the scope of the settlement, which is to
say books published everywhere except
in English-speaking countries We have
material at Stanford that is not in English,
and we're scanning that material. But
how freely that material becomes accessi
ble by the open Web is less certain.That is
a definite downside of the settlement.
Whether that will definitely bite Stanford,
I don't know.
TSD: How has the scanning process been
organized? Have there been problems?
AH: It's a considerable or logistical —
nightmare to move thousands of books
from campus over to Google, return
them, get them back on the shelf And, in
fact, each book, after it has been selected
off of the shell] is checked out as if Google
were a person... Google itself has its
own controls, but the labor is being con
ducted mainly by Google people with a
considerable amount of oversight and re
view by Stanford [Libraries].There have
certainly been glitches. Our books are in
so many places; there have certainly been

access issues. Elevators that are smaller or
larger than our book trucks have really
been logistical problems in a really large-

scale project. I would say that overall
we've had a very successful working rela
tionship with Google staff
TSD: Do you think the growth of
Google Book Search reflects the devel
opment of a more autodidactic society?
AH; In its ideal state, [the] Google Books
Search service making vast numbers of
books available to the public to be
searched and, to some extent, to be read,
can be understood as a huge step forward
in the democratization of information.
And doing so essentially means that if
you are a student at East Podunk Com
munity College, that you will have access
to millions of books, as does the Stanford
student. There is a powerful argument
that that really makes possible the im
provement of that person's potential
horizons and prospects for education.
And if they're not a student at all, but
rather a citizen, it could be very empow
ering for it to be assumed that vast num
bers of books are at their fingertips. [... ]
We really hope that it will have the ef
fect of making people better aware of
differences in quality in available infor
mation. A lot of the stuff on the Web is
hard to distinguish in terms of its quality
of truthfulness. Books, of course, have
the same problem, but to know that a
book was held by Stanford or the Uni
versity of Michigan gives it a certain au
thenticity that a Web site or Joe Moe's
blog cannot.
