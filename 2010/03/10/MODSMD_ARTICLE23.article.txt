## Herkovic: Google Books is 'too useful to fail' 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is currently in a partnership
with Google to help digitize millions of
books for the online Google Books data
base, an effort thathasanimmense poten
tial to democratize access to literature and
knowledge. Google has scanned more
than L7 rnilhon books owned by Stanford
in the last five years and hopes to scan mil
lions more over the next decade. More
than two dozen major libraries around
the world have signed on to the project
The University last month con
firmed its support of the Google Book
Search Settlement Agreement, which
Google and copyright owners had
brought before a federal court. The new
settlement made modifications to the
original agreement, which was reached
in 2008 as a resolution to separate law
suits filed by the Authors Guild and the
Association of American Publishers in
2005 accusing Google of "massive copy
right infringement."
Under the 303-page amended set
tlement, Google would make a one
time payment of $125 million to rights
holders, authors and publishers to
negate liability for materials that have
already been scanned, searched and
made available online. Part of the pay
ment would also be devoted to the es
tablishment of an independent non
profit entity called the Book Rights
Registry, which would collect revenue
from third-party users of Google Books
content and transfer that revenue to
rights holders.
The settlement would enable
Google to continue scanning and dis
playing books under the condition that
the company turn over 63 percent of its

net revenues from advertising to rights
holders One of the key features of the
agreement would be Google's ability to
make considerable use of out-of-print
and "orphan" works which are out-of
print but still protected under copyright
law; revenues from these works would
be mediated through the new Book
Rights Registry.
The settlement also contains provi
sions for the establishment of institu
tional and public access subscription
systems, which would enable compa
nies, colleges and individuals to have ac
cess to the Google Books catalog.
If the settlement is approved, Stan
ford will become a Fully Participating
Library in the Google Books effort,
which would expand its current access
to the Google Book catalog.
Andrew Herkovic, director of com
munications and development at Stan
ford Libraries, called the Google Books
project "too useful to fail. I believe that
something useful, if not perfect, will
come out of the court.''
Herkovic spoke with The Daily
about Stanford's relationship with
Google, the new settlement and the fu
ture of the Google Books project. Here
is an edited excerpt.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did
Stanford first begin its relationship with
Google Book Search?
Andrew Herkovic (AH): As you know,
Stanford Libraries has been digitizing
materials for many years, but on a very
small scale â€”generally for special pur
poses or projects In about2oo2,Univer
sity Librarian Mike Keller was at a re
treat at the home of Paul Allen, the Mi
crosoft co-founder, and found himself in
conversation with Larry Page [M.S. '9B],

the co-founder of Google, in which they
found that they were both very interest
ed in the idea of the mass digitization of
books to unleash the information sitting
on library shelves That may not have it
self started the Google Book Search
project, but it put us in a position so that
when Google got serious about it in
2003, they immediately started talking
to Stanford about our participation and
discussion about how to go about such a
plan. So we were one of the first five li
braries that were on board when
Google went public with this in 2004.
TSD: How does the Google Book
Search subscription work?
AH: If the settlement goes through,
the Fully Participating Libraries will
have access to at least all of the content
that they provided. Furthermore,
under the settlement, every library will
have the right to one terminal, so to
speak [i.e. for one simultaneous user].
Individuals unaffiliated with the insti
tutions would be able to buy access to
Google Books on a pay-as-you-go
basis or various, not yet fully articulat
ed subscription schemes. If the settle
ment is approved, Stanford students
on campus would not need to pay any
thing for access.
Someone in the community unaffil
iated with Stanford would have the op
portunity to seek a terminal in a Palo
Alto library or would be able to seek a
terminal on the Stanford campus and
would have equivalent rights of any
one on the campus I believe that to
be true.

TSD: Could you describe some of the
features of the Google Book Search
database and what is convenient about
using the database?
AH: The great power of Google Book
Search is in search. And the power to
search any book is a powerful tool. If the
settlement goes through, there will be a
lot of full texts available, depending on
how authors and publishers individual
ly react. In general, the public will be
able to read, instead of snippets, some
thing like up to 20 percent of the text of
the particular book that is under copy
right, and they would be able to read 100
percent of the text of the book that is out
of copyright. The terms of the settle
ment have been limited to books pub
lished in the United States, Canada, the
United Kingdom and Australia.
Unfortunately, we're not talking
about every book. We're only talking
about books published in those coun
tries where the author or publisher has
not opted out. That's a huge limitation
on the power of the system. But we're
looking at access to a lot of full texts, but
not as much as we would hope in an
ideal system. But a lot more than would
have been possible under the original
settlement with Google.
TSD: How has the Stanford alumni
connection to Google affected Stan
ford's relationship with Google?
AH: The fact that Larry and Sergey
[Brin M.S. '95 Ph.D.'9B] are closely asso
ciated with the Stanford computer sci-
