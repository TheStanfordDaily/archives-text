## Bioengineering major ramps up 
### RYAN MAYFIELD STAFF WRITER 
Bioengineering, one of the most recently formed
departments on campus, has only been a graduate
level program for five years and was not available to
undergraduates until the beginning of this school
year.
But despite its relative youth, the program is al
ready ranked within the top 10 in the nation for its
graduate component.
This year, only a handful of students have de
clared majors in bioengineering. There is a great
deal of interest in the major, however, according to
Jim Plummer M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7l, dean of the School
of Engineering.
"We are worried that the number of undergrads
considering this major may overwhelm the BioE
department," wrote Plummer in an e-mail to The
Daily.
This prediction is based on anecdotal informa
tion, as well as the popularity of bioengineering pro
grams across the nation. Johns Hopkins University
is currently ranked first in the nation with a major
they call biomedical engineering, which is the
largest department within its engineering program.
While some students are interested in the mix
ture between engineering and pre-medical pro
grams, there are additional factors that draw stu
dents in, according to Leslie Tung, director of the
undergraduate biomedical engineering program at
Johns Hopkins.
"Others are interested in the access that our de

partment provides to clinical laboratories through
ongoing collaborations," Tung wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Such interests are similar to those of Travis
Urban 'll, who entered Stanford looking to major
in biology and get a coterminal degree in bioengi
neering. With the addition of the bioengineering
undergraduate degree this fall, Urban decided to
make the switch.
"They opened up the major, so I thought I would
just take a stab at it," Urban said. "I had to go talk to
the guy who designed the major, but in the end, he
let me go forth, for better or for worse."
Urban's interest came from research he saw
being done by professors into areas like synthetic
biology and metabolic engineering. A particular
study included reengineering bacteria to design
medicine.
"It's a more cost effective way of producing a
complex drug," Urban said. "For me, that's what
fired me up about bioengineering, It seems like a re
ally cool facet of the major, or one area that the
major covers that I wanted to explore in-depth."
Over the next five years, the Stanford program is
expected to continue expanding, and professors are
hoping that along with this increase in size comes
even greater prominence in national rankings
perhaps reaching the top three in the near future.
"Within a few years, it will have a 21st century
home when the fourth building is finished in the
SEQ [Science and Engineering Quad] II," Plum
mer wrote. "We believe the intellectual focus of the
department (based on quantitative biology), is the

right focus. This con
trasts with many
other BioE depart
ments, which are much
more strongly focused on
biomedical applications."
Over the next five
years, the program is ex
pected to expand .
through the addition of '
25 faculty members. The
principal unknown com-

ponent remains the under-

graduate program, which

began last quarter with
some organizational is
sues, despite the great

interest.
"The first bioengineering undergraduate course
I took was last quarter," Urban said. "They didn't
have a syllabus we were told a midterm would
happen in the middle of the quarter, and we didn't
know when it would happen."
Urban estimated that between 30 and 35 stu
dents arrived on the first day of class. This number
was slimmed down to a core of seven, including six
declared bioengineering majors, he said.
The curiosity shown by freshmen in the new
major, however, could be a positive sign of future
popularity.
"It's moving in the right direction," Urban said.
