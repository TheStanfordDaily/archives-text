## College app ad in Stanford Magazine troubles some 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford admission applica
tion asks a variety of questions to
gauge a prospective student's interests
in everything from dormitories to aca
demics to potential roommates. An
applicant must also sign an honor
code.
But what if applicants had to ac
knowledge whether or not they had
used outside help, like a for-profit
counseling agency, during the process?
That was the question Shawn Ab
bott, the director of admission, raised
to the faculty's Committee on Under
graduate Admission and Financial
Aid earlier this year. Abbott brought
up the issue following concerns about
an advertisement currently running in
the Stanford Magazine for an "appli
cation boot camp" run by Michele
Hernandez who bills herself as
"America's premier college consult
ant" that has provoked responses
from several alumni, according to
Kevin Cool, the magazine's editor.
"The Hernandez company, and
probably other similar companies, ap
pear to be helping college applicants,
including Stanford applicants, cheat on
their applications," Jonathan Eisen
berg '92 told the Office of Admission in
a letter he provided to The Daily.
Hernandez, the head college con
sultant at Hernandez College Consult
ing and former assistant director of ad
missions at Dartmouth, said that char

acterization is incorrect.
"We're helping kids who could get
into Stanford on their own," she said.
"We can't invent talents, but we can
show how to better represent them."
The company helps clients outline
application strategies to improve their
chances and provides oral feedback on
essays, Hernandez said. Her experi
ence with applications from the uni
versity perspective, she said, means she
knows "what would be crossing the
line" in terms of help.
She charges up to $40,000 per
client, sometimes for months of coun
seling, Business Week reported in
2007.
According to the magazine's ad
vertising manager, Phil Johnson, the
advertisement is not directly placed
by the publication itself; rather, the
magazine is a partner with a third
party group called the Ivy League
Magazine Network, which purchases
advertising space in elite college mag
azines across the country.
"The magazine does represent the
University, and if something is really
inappropriate, it is the discretion of
the magazine and the editor to pull
it," Johnson said.
So far, there are no plans to re
move the advertisement from the
Stanford Magazine.
"We're not contractually obligated
to run these ads, but if all other
schools are running them, then we
need a compelling reason not to,"
Cool said.

Richard Shaw, the dean of admis
sion, wrote to several universities also
partnered with the Ivy League Net
work to alert them of Stanford's situ
ation.
"It has nothing to do with the ads
themselves," Cool added, "but with
[the reader's] perception of the com
pany and the business practices as un
ethical."
So, how does an admission officer
flag outside help?
"We certainly encounter situa
tions where we are suspicious when
the application or the writing appears
to be too 'polished,' so we always look
for multiple pieces of evidence in an
application," Abbott wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "If the essay is bril
liant, we typically expect that the stu
dent will also have strong grades in
English courses, strong writing test
scores and recommendations that
talk about a student's writing ability."
According to Abbott, there is not a
formal policy in place to deal with
"suspicious" applications. He would
not say directly whether or not an ap
plicant who paid Hernandez's compa
ny for help would be considered cheat
ing.
A move toward a more clear policy,
Abbott said, would be to add a ques
tion on the Stanford application asking
whether or not the applicant received
outside help with his or her applica
tion.
"We're wrestling with the idea that
a question should be added to the ap

plication, but it's not as simple as it
sounds," Abbott said. "If we add such a
question, we need to determine what
to do with that information, and we
need to determine how we address
honesty."
The faculty committee has yet to
make a decision on adding such a ques
tion.
"We are concerned about adding a
question to the application that might
encourage students to be less-than
honest if they feel their answer will in
fluence their admission one way or the
other," Abbott said.
Cool is concerned, for his part, that
rejecting this advertisement when no
other university has done so would set
a negative precedent.
"Not everyone agrees that these
practices are unethical," he said." [Her
nandez] could be a sawy entrepreneur
that has exploited a market successful
ly-"
For now, Abbott hopes that appli
cants remain honest and attest to their
own work when signing the personal
statement. He likened the online sig
nature to abiding by Stanford's Funda
mental Standard.
"We aren't blind to the fact that
some students use independent col
lege counselors," Abbott said. Unfor
tunately for us, it is impossible for us to
know exactly who is using a counselor
and to what degree."
