For many of us, law school, med
ical school and graduate school
are all dreams and distinct pos
sibilities for our futures. We work
hard at academics, stuff our resumes
and excel at extracurricular activi
ties. Moving on to something like
Harvard Law is a goal we actively
work toward every single day.
For one girl, Harvard Law was a
dream she didn't know she had
and it wasn't she had the scorn of a
boy and her Delta Nu sorority sis
ters' help that she tried her hand at
the Ivy League. In one of the most
successful and übiquitous films of the
past decade, "Legally Blonde," Elle
Woods takes the legal world by
storm by proving that a girl can be
both smart and fashion savvy. In
2007, the movie got revamped into
"Legally Blonde: The Musical," and
it is coming to San Jose from March
16-21. Intermission was lucky
enough to chat with Natalie Joy
Johnson, who stars as Paulette, Elle's
beautician best friend.

Intermission (i): How does "Legally
Blonder The Musical" differ from the
film? Will the fans of the movie be
pleased with the play?
Natalie Joy Johnson (NJJ):The mu
sical is very much the same story as
the film. It's about Elle, who is, of
course, jilted by her boyfriend, Warn
er, and everything that follows. Ex
cept in the stage version, you add
song and dance. The biggest differ
ence between the musical and the
movie is that you get to see Elle and
Emmett really fall in love. In the
movie, it's just like, Luke Wilson is
there for a little bit, and boom, they
get engaged in the end. You see more
of that on stage musicals love a
good love story.
i: Who do you think the ideal audi
ence member is for "Legally Blonde:
The Musical?"
NJJ: Honestly, the brilliant thing
about this show is that there is some-

thing for everybody. Obviously, it
reaches a lot of women and girls

tweens are really big fans. My fa
vorite compliments, though, come
from the fellas. They'll tell me, "My
girlfriend [or whomever] dragged
me here and I loved it!" It's a really
fun show and very energetic, very
saccharine. It also helps that the cast
is a group of ridiculously beautiful
people (laughs).
i: What do you think is the message
that people should take away from
the show?
NJJ: I can boil the big, overall theme
of the show into one of the lines in
the script. "Being true to yourself
never goes out of style." At the end of
the day, that is the message to take
away. And I think that it means
something to everybody.
Catch "Legally Blonde: The Musi
cal" in San Jose, March 16-21. Tickets
start at $2O.
