# STUDENT LIFE
## A 						handful transfer â€“ out 
### LAUREN WILSON 
Fierce competition and few seats
mean that just 25 transfer students
were accepted to Stanford in 2008; an
average of 30 make the cut each year,
according to the Registrar's office.
Once transfer and new students get
in, Stanford boasts a retention rate
around 98 percent.
But what about the other two per
cent those who choose to leave?
Koren Bakkegard, an associate
dean in Undergraduate Advising and
Research, is often the person to meet
with those undergraduates who trans
fer from Stanford.
"The image I use when I talk to
students is: it feels like we're on one of
those moving sidewalks at an airport
with the railings, and once you're on it,
you're on it, until you get off,"
Bakkegard said. "That's not at all the
reality of the undergraduate experi
ence."
Not many students choose to trans
fer out; Bakkegard speaks with the
majority of students who come to their
academic advisers considering a trans
fer. During more than a year and a half
as an associate dean, she said she has
not spoken with more than a dozen
freshmen per year about leaving.
Last year, she said, she spoke with
fewer than 10 students interested in
transferring. Of them, only three ulti
mately left for another university.
Since then, one decided to re-enroll at
Stanford.
But there is only anecdotal infor
mation about how many students
seek to leave Stanford. Because there
is not a required administrative

process for students who leave, unless
they choose to speak with their aca
demic adviser, there is no way of

keeping track, administrators said.
Then there's the fact that leaving
the Farm is not always permanent, as
was the case with Bakkegard's ad
visee.

Students can file for a leave of ab
sence, which holds their spot at Stan
ford for two years in case they decide
to come back, regardless of whether
or not they enroll at another school.
Eighty-four students took leaves
of absence this winter, as did 175 in
fall quarter and 200 last fall, for rea
sons ranging from job opportunities
to relatives' illnesses.

While the percentage of students
who choose to transfer is small, the
question still remains as to their rea
sons why.
"A lot of it just has to do with feel
ing a sense of community or a match
with the culture of the institution,"
Bakkegard said. "Sometimes it's
about looking for a specific academic
program and feeling that Stanford
doesn't have exactly the specialty
area they're looking for."
For one student who was grant
ed anonymity because he felt the de
cision to transfer is a sensitive, person
al matter religion is the issue.
"There's an irreligious attitude on
campus, particularly in this unfamil
iarity with Judaism," he said. As a de
vout Jew, he has had trouble reconcil
ing his strong religious beliefs with the
lifestyle of his peers: many students go
out on Friday nights, which are also
the nights of the Sabbath.

"I don't have that kind of social ex
posure I was hoping for," he said. "I feel
not embarrassed, but kind of afraid to
openly wear the yarmulke or things
like that as I walk around campus be
cause I feel like people look at it funny."
He is currently applying to several

East Coast schools, including Yale, the
University of Pennsylvania and Co
lumbia. He cites Columbia's "unbe
lievably large, diverse and under
standing Jewish communities" a rea
son for its appeal.

While Yale and Brown don't nec
essarily solve the religion issue for
him, their proximity to his East Coast
home makes them both viable op-

tions.
"I felt closer to home in Israel last
year than I did this year, so that's kind
of an interesting feeling," he said.
However, he is waiting until spring
quarter before he makes a final deci
sion.

"I am kind of an East Coaster at
heart," said another student who is
considering a transfer, and was grant
ed anonymity because of the personal
nature of the decision. "There's a very
overwhelming sense of school spirit
here that sort of transcends school
spirit and ends up a kind of blind,
feverish contentedness. It's just a real
ly almost forced happiness, that
because the sun is shining and we're
all wearing red, everyone has to be
happy all the time. It just ends up kind
of oppressive after a while."
However, she remains on the fence
about whether or not to stay.
"Maybe all of the things I just com
plained about are all in my head, and
I'm just making myself miserable be
cause I'm crazy," she said. "And
maybe I'll see that and get really
super stoked about being here at
some point. But in the meantime,
transferring is still an option."
