## CLOSING OUT Women finish regular season strong, start postseason play Friday 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Closing out an impressive regular season
on Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal women
bested rival Cal on the road to secure a per
fect conference record, beating the Bears
63-48. Stanford managed the victory with
out the help of its star player, senior center
Jayne Appel, as forwards Kayla Pedersen
and Nnemkadi Ogwumike stepped up with
23- and 22-point efforts, respectively.
Whether or not it was a result of missing
Appel, the No. 2 Cardinal (28-1, 18-0 Pac
-10) had a hard time establishing an offensive
rhythm and driving to the basket in its com
fortable, though often sloppy, victory. The
Stanford staff revealed that Appel had
sprained her ankle in practice on Tuesday,
and it remains unclear when the reigning
Pac-10 Player of the Year will be able to re
turn. Despite a large group of friends and
family coming out to support Appel at
Berkeley, her birthplace, she was sidelined
with a large orthopedic boot on her right leg
for the entire game.
After a solid season and a 5-1 record over
the previous three weeks, the Bears (17-12,
11-7) had plenty of momentum and a lot to
play for on Saturday, their annual Senior
Day. A win against Stanford who handily
defeated the Bears at Maples Pavilion on
Jan. 2, winning 79-58 would have been a
big confidence booster and helped to secure
a berth in the NCAA Tournament. Despite
winning the "Battle of the Bay" at home last
season by a score 0f57-54 to hand rival Stan
ford its only conference loss, the Bears were
unable to repeat the upset.
While the final score might suggest oth
erwise, however, Cal hung tough in the
opening minutes of the game. Stanford
quickly found itself down 4-0 after a jumper
from senior guard Alexis Gray-Lawson
Cal's offensive leader on Saturday with 15
points and did not lead until a Pedersen
layup at 13:00 put her team up 8-6.That bas
ket came in the midst of a 10-0 Cardinal run
that put Stanford up 14-6 midway through
the half.
Cal went scoreless for over six minutes
during the stretch, and shot just 25.8 percent

on the half. Outside the 10-0 outburst, the
Cardinal offense did not look particularly
impressive either, as Stanford opened the
game going two-for-eight with two
turnovers in four minutes, and shot 40 per
cent before halftime.
For both teams, solid defense con
tributed as much to the poor shooting in the
first half as a lack of offensive coordination.
Cal stepped up big on transition defense, in
tercepting passes and interrupting Stan
ford's ability to set up on offense. Eliza
Pierre, who finished with a game-high three
steals for Cal, made a particularly impres
sive interception of a Lindy Laßocque pass,
breaking quickly across the court to score an
easy layup. Stanford, meanwhile, frustrated
the Bears with its ability to quickly set up in
the defensive zone, protecting the basket
and forcing long-distance, low-percentage
shots. Senior guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
was particularly effective, holding Gray-
Lawson (18.0 points per game) to four-for
-13 shooting from the field. In Cal's victory
last season, Gray-Lawson singlehandedly
dismantled the Cardinal with 37 points.
The Bears pulled within 20-17 on a pair
of Gray-Lawson free throws with less than
three minutes remaining in the half, but
Stanford was able to establish a more com
fortable 26-19 lead before heading to locker
room. Junior guard Jeanette Pohlen nearly
gave the Cardinal a 10-point lead with a des
perate three-point attempt as time expired,
but the shot fell short. Despite playing solid
defense, Pohlen and Gold-Onwude strug
gled on offense, as Stanford's pair of starting
guards combined for a total of just three
field goals on 19 attempts.
Both teams edged a bit closer toward
their normally solid offensive production in
the second half, but neither was able to put
together any streaks of strong shooting.
Stanford had the better resurgence, howev
er, with the tone set immediately by an Og
wumike layup that gave her a double-dou
ble. She finished the game with 22 points
and a game-high 14 rebounds.
Freshman forward Joslyn Tinkle, playing
a career-high 34 minutes in Appel's absence,
also made important contributions down
the stretch.The Missoula, Mont, native post-

Ed Stanford's first three-pointer of the game
with 13:33 remaining on a wide-open shot
from the corner to make it 39-27. The Card
was just 2-13 from beyond the arc on Satur
day, with both baskets coming from Tinkle.
She finished with eight points and nine re
bounds.
Following Tinkle's first three, Ogwumike
took initiative on offense and helped the
Cardinal to pull away. She scored a jumper
soon afterward that gave her a game-high 17
points at the time, and then made a decisive
layup to make it 45-29. She turned to her
teammates and pumped her fist emphatical
ly upon landing on the court, sensing that a
perfect conference record was becoming
more and more certain.
Stanford never let Cal pull within 10
points for the remainder of the game, de
spite a passionate effort from the Bears as
time wound down. While the Cardinal had
already secured its 10th consecutive out
right or shared conference title several
weeks ago, the victory gave Stanford the
first perfect Pac-10 season by any team since
the Cardinal last went undefeated in 2002.
Stanford has now won 35 of its last 38 meet
ings with the Bears.
The season might be over, but the Cardi
nal's ambitions are anything but. Stanford's
next step on its quest for a third consecutive
Final Four appearance and its first national
championship since 1990 will take it to Los
Angeles, where it will play as the No. 1 seed
in the Pac-10 Tournament. The Cardinal,
who won the tournament last season, will
open up against either Arizona or Washing
ton State on Friday.
Of course, Stanford's ultimate goal is to
earn a national title. The Cardinal nearly
achieved that goal just last season, but was
defeated by Connecticut in the semifinals.
The No. 1 Huskies have not lost since that
game, and are the only team to defeat Stan
ford this season. If the Cardinal reaches the
title game, there is a good chance they will
be facing off against an all-too-familiar foe.
Stanford will begin its NCAA Tourna
ment run either March 20 or 21.

fortable 26-19 lead before heading to locker
room. Junior guard Jeanette Pohlen nearly
gave the Cardinal a 10-point lead with a des
perate three-point attempt as time expired,
but the shot fell short. Despite playing solid
defense, Pohlen and Gold-Onwude strug
gled on offense, as Stanford's pair of starting
guards combined for a total of just three
field goals on 19 attempts.
Both teams edged a bit closer toward
their normally solid offensive production in
the second half, but neither was able to put
together any streaks of strong shooting.
Stanford had the better resurgence, howev
er, with the tone set immediately by an Og
wumike layup that gave her a double-dou
ble. She finished the game with 22 points
and a game-high 14 rebounds.
Freshman forward Joslyn Tinkle, playing
a career-high 34 minutes in Appel's absence,
also made important contributions down
the stretch.The Missoula, Mont, native post-

Ed Stanford's first three-pointer of the game
with 13:33 remaining on a wide-open shot
from the corner to make it 39-27. The Card
was just 2-13 from beyond the arc on Satur
day, with both baskets coming from Tinkle.
She finished with eight points and nine re
bounds.
Following Tinkle's first three, Ogwumike
took initiative on offense and helped the
Cardinal to pull away. She scored a jumper
soon afterward that gave her a game-high 17
points at the time, and then made a decisive
layup to make it 45-29. She turned to her
teammates and pumped her fist emphatical
ly upon landing on the court, sensing that a
perfect conference record was becoming
more and more certain.
Stanford never let Cal pull within 10
points for the remainder of the game, de
spite a passionate effort from the Bears as
time wound down. While the Cardinal had
already secured its 10th consecutive out
right or shared conference title several
weeks ago, the victory gave Stanford the
first perfect Pac-10 season by any team since
the Cardinal last went undefeated in 2002.
Stanford has now won 35 of its last 38 meet
ings with the Bears.
The season might be over, but the Cardi
nal's ambitions are anything but. Stanford's
next step on its quest for a third consecutive
Final Four appearance and its first national
championship since 1990 will take it to Los
Angeles, where it will play as the No. 1 seed
in the Pac-10 Tournament. The Cardinal,
who won the tournament last season, will
open up against either Arizona or Washing
ton State on Friday.
Of course, Stanford's ultimate goal is to
earn a national title. The Cardinal nearly
achieved that goal just last season, but was
defeated by Connecticut in the semifinals.
The No. 1 Huskies have not lost since that
game, and are the only team to defeat Stan
ford this season. If the Cardinal reaches the
title game, there is a good chance they will
be facing off against an all-too-familiar foe.
Stanford will begin its NCAA Tourna
ment run either March 20 or 21.

Redshirt junior guard Melanie Murphy and the Stanford women's basketball team capped off an
undefeated Pac-10 season with a win over Cal, and now must prepare for the Pac-10 Tournament.
Closing out an impressive regular season
on Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal women
bested rival Cal on the road to secure a per
fect conference record, beating the Bears
63-48. Stanford managed the victory with
out the help of its star player, senior center
Jayne Appel, as forwards Kayla Pedersen
and Nnemkadi Ogwumike stepped up with
23- and 22-point efforts, respectively.
Whether or not it was a result of missing
Appel, the No. 2 Cardinal (28-1, 18-0 Pac
-10) had a hard time establishing an offensive
rhythm and driving to the basket in its com
fortable, though often sloppy, victory. The
Stanford staff revealed that Appel had
sprained her ankle in practice on Tuesday,
and it remains unclear when the reigning
Pac-10 Player of the Year will be able to re
turn. Despite a large group of friends and
family coming out to support Appel at
Berkeley, her birthplace, she was sidelined
with a large orthopedic boot on her right leg
for the entire game.
After a solid season and a 5-1 record over
the previous three weeks, the Bears (17-12,
11-7) had plenty of momentum and a lot to
play for on Saturday, their annual Senior
Day. A win against Stanford who handily
defeated the Bears at Maples Pavilion on
Jan. 2, winning 79-58 would have been a
big confidence booster and helped to secure
a berth in the NCAA Tournament. Despite
winning the "Battle of the Bay" at home last
season by a score 0f57-54 to hand rival Stan
ford its only conference loss, the Bears were
unable to repeat the upset.
While the final score might suggest oth
erwise, however, Cal hung tough in the
opening minutes of the game. Stanford
quickly found itself down 4-0 after a jumper
from senior guard Alexis Gray-Lawson
Cal's offensive leader on Saturday with 15
points and did not lead until a Pedersen
layup at 13:00 put her team up 8-6.That bas
ket came in the midst of a 10-0 Cardinal run
that put Stanford up 14-6 midway through
the half.
Cal went scoreless for over six minutes
during the stretch, and shot just 25.8 percent

on the half. Outside the 10-0 outburst, the
Cardinal offense did not look particularly
impressive either, as Stanford opened the
game going two-for-eight with two
turnovers in four minutes, and shot 40 per
cent before halftime.
For both teams, solid defense con
tributed as much to the poor shooting in the
first half as a lack of offensive coordination.
Cal stepped up big on transition defense, in
tercepting passes and interrupting Stan
ford's ability to set up on offense. Eliza
Pierre, who finished with a game-high three
steals for Cal, made a particularly impres
sive interception of a Lindy Laßocque pass,
breaking quickly across the court to score an
easy layup. Stanford, meanwhile, frustrated
the Bears with its ability to quickly set up in
the defensive zone, protecting the basket
and forcing long-distance, low-percentage
shots. Senior guard Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
was particularly effective, holding Gray-
Lawson (18.0 points per game) to four-for
-13 shooting from the field. In Cal's victory
last season, Gray-Lawson singlehandedly
dismantled the Cardinal with 37 points.
The Bears pulled within 20-17 on a pair
of Gray-Lawson free throws with less than
three minutes remaining in the half, but
Stanford was able to establish a more com
fortable 26-19 lead before heading to locker
room. Junior guard Jeanette Pohlen nearly
gave the Cardinal a 10-point lead with a des
perate three-point attempt as time expired,
but the shot fell short. Despite playing solid
defense, Pohlen and Gold-Onwude strug
gled on offense, as Stanford's pair of starting
guards combined for a total of just three
field goals on 19 attempts.
