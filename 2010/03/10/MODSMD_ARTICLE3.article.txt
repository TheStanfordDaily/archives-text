## Senators compromise on SSD bill Wellness Room is cut from budget ahead of fees vote 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After five weeks of strenuous de

for the Student Services Division
(SSD), the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate last night finally arrived at a
satisfactory compromise between

funding for equipment.

this week. Still, some senators were
not satisfied with the budget's mod

Alex Katz 'l2, the chair of the
Administration & Rules Commit

said, pointing to the $3,500 in officer
salaries that far exceeds the amount
that the Senate would typically ap
prove.

Special Fees Ballot?
In keeping with his previous ob

suggested that the Wellness Room
