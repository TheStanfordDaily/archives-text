## Senators compromise on SSD bill Wellness Room is cut from budget ahead of fees vote 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After five weeks of strenuous de
bate about the special fees budget
for the Student Services Division
(SSD), the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate last night finally arrived at a
satisfactory compromise between
the bill's author, ASSU Vice Presi
dent Andy Parker' 11, and the rest of
the group's members.
The SSD budget has seen signifi
cant revision, including, most no
tably, the removal of Tutoring for
Community from the SSD budget.
The Green Store's marketing budg
et was also slimmed, and discre
tionary funding for the manage
ment arm of the division was alto
gether slashed. Several salaries
were halved, including those for the
executive director of management
and the director of the Wellness
Room.
With the hopes of retaining space
for the Wellness Room on the budg
et, Parker also cut funding for
staffing and significantly reduced
funding for equipment.
Since his most recent proposal
last week, Parker dropped an addi
tional $lO,OOO from the bill's budget
this week. Still, some senators were
not satisfied with the budget's mod
ifications.
Alex Katz 'l2, the chair of the
Administration & Rules Commit
tee and a critic of student group of
ficer salaries, maintained that the
Senate was making its fair share of
exceptions and that SSD's budget
ought to undergo additional com
promise.
"Some very significant excep
tions are being made for SSD," Katz
said, pointing to the $3,500 in officer
salaries that far exceeds the amount
that the Senate would typically ap
prove.
The Wellness Room: Space on the
Special Fees Ballot?
In keeping with his previous ob
jections to the joint venture, Katz
suggested that the Wellness Room
functions more like a voluntary stu
dent organization (VSO) and ought
to apply for funding independently
in the fall on the general fee.
"It does not mirror the service
project as envisioned by the ASSU,
as laid out by SSD," he said, suggest
ing that the shuttle service and
Green Store provided different
functions that should not be lumped
together with the Wellness Room,
which could operate on its own.
After a straw poll to gauge sup
port for the bill with and without the
amendment to remove the Wellness
Room from the SSD budget, Parker
agreed to withdraw the Wellness
Room from the bill's proposal, sub
tracting $4,000 from the overall SSD
special fees budget. Seven of the 12
senators present would have sup
ported the bill with the Wellness
Room, but one more senator's sup
port would have been needed to
muster a two-thirds vote over Katz's
amendment.
Parker said in an interview with
The Daily that the compromise
means "a harder road for [the Well
ness Room] in the future."
"When it comes down to it having
something on the special fees ballot
for SSD, it is better than nothing,"
Parker said.
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, the deputy
Senate chair, declined to support the
bill with the amendment to remove
the Wellness Room from the budget.
"I felt that the Wellness Room
should still be a part of the bill," he

said, adding that many of the contro
versies that have surfaced surround
ing the initiative represent "more of
a criticism" of the way the Wellness
Room is run than a fundamental op
position to its spirit.
"We're still trying to evaluate the
usefulness of it," Wharton said. "Until
we can do that we should fund it, but
work even harder to make sure that it
is being evaluated properly."
Senate Salary Cuts Revisited
A second bill on deck for vote at
the start of spring quarter is one that
would tighten the reins on Senate
salaries.
The bill supports stipends for the
Senate chair, Appropriations chair and
secretary, and proposes the payment of
stipends at the end of the term after ef
fective completion of respective roles
and duties, as well as attendance at 90
percent of the Senate's meetings.
Some senators rejected the dis
bursement of payment at the end of
the term, suggesting that such a meas
ure would make public service more
unfeasible for some students. Accord
ingly, the bill was amended to dis
perse stipends in quarterly install
ments.
In addition to the amendment, a
number of senators supported the
addition of a $l,OOO salary for the
deputy chair, who is often asked to
step in for the chair and must
spend significant time at addition
al meetings.
Free Speech is "a Fight that Needs to
be Fought," Senator Says
Senator Adam Creasman 'll an
nounced the withdrawal of a free
speech bill that he co-authored with
Parker.

"Effectively, this bill is dead," he
said.
Creasman reported word from the
University President's office that
President Hennessy felt the bill was
"inappropriate" and that the ASSU
was not authorized to legislate Uni
versity policy. The GSC also objected
to the bill, voicing concerns about its
hurried approach, Creasman said.
"As long as students do not under
stand their rights, then we as student
representatives cannot rest," Creasman
suggested, adding that he will be seek
ing the expertise of the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) and other or
ganizations about away forward.
"This issue is not closed," Creas
man said.
On a more jovial note, Senator
Zachary Warma 'll made his exit ad
dress before his departure for spring
quarter at Stanford in Washington,
reading from a scroll of makeshift
parchment to a captive audience of
constituents and friends over celebra
tory drinks.
Appropriations Funding & The Spe
cial Fees Ballot
Recommending 41 percent of stu
dent groups' funding requests in Feb
ruary, the Appropriations Committee
increased the Senate's spending ap
provals last month, but the body is
still $24,000 under budget, said Anton
Zietsman "12, the Appropriations
Committee chair.
The week's funding bills and pub
lications funding bills were unani
mously passed. A graduate member
of the Elections Commission was also
approved at Tuesday's meeting.
