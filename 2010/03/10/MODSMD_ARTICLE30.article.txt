## Card wins Pac- 10s Stanford comes back to tally 29th straight conference title 
### CHRIS DERRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a strong team effort that featured both individ
ual standouts and unparalleled depth, the Stanford
men's swimming and diving team won its 29th consec
utive Pac-10 championship under head coach Skip
Kenney. The No. 3 Cardinal trailed No. 4 California by
10 points following the evening session on Friday, but
on Saturday, the final day of competition, the men
demonstrated the kind of poise and resolve that leads
to 29 straight titles.
"It was one of the best team efforts, top to bottom,
that I have ever witnessed," Kenney said.
After the first full day of competition on Thursday,
the Cardinal held an 82-point lead over Cal. No. 1 Ari
zona was third, just three points behind Cal. Stanford
dominated the 500-yard freestyle, scoring 83 points as
junior David Mosko won the event with an NCAA "A"
cut. The Cardinal had four other swimmers in the
championship final and three more in the consolation
final.
Swimming scores 16 places and there are eight
swimmers to a race. Based on their times in the prelim
inaries swum in the morning session, the top 16 athletes
are divided between the championship or "A" final and
the consolation or "B" final. The winner of the "A" final
scores 20 points while eighth place scores 11. The win
ner of the "B" final scores nine points and eighth place
scores one.
Stanford continued to swim well throughout the
evening session, with freshman Matthew Thompson
and sophomore Curtis Lovelace each finishing in the
top four of the 200-yard IM, while senior David Dun
ford and junior Alex Coville took second and third in
the 50-yard freestyle, respectively. The Cardinal capped
the session by winning the 200-yard freestyle relay.
The next day started well for the Cardinal with soph
omore Bobby Bollier winning the 400-yard IM, but Cal
came storming back. Led by winner Tom Shields, the
Bears scored 101 points in the 100-yard butterfly. Stan
ford swam well, with Lovelace making the podium in
the 100-yard breaststroke and senior Eugene Godsoe
successfully defending his title in the 100-yard back
stroke. The Bears were too strong, however, and used
their depth to take the lead following the 100-yard
backstroke.
Going into Saturday it was imperative
that the Cardinal swim well in the morning
session in order to place as many athletes
as possible in the "A" finals of the evening
session.
"We got some e-mails from many for
mer players last night who talked about
the tradition and the pride of being a Stan
ford swimmer" Godsoe said. "Everybody
was real fired up for today's meet because
we did not want to be the team that gave
up the streak."
The Cardinal did not disappoint in the
morning session. Bollier set the Pac-10
record in the 200 fly in the prelims and
Stanford placed five swimmers in the "A"
final of the 100-yard free, setting up the
Cardinal for victory.
The tone was set in the first event of the
evening session when Stanford took five of
the top six places in the 1650 free. Sopho
more Chad la Tourette, who had disap
pointingly failed to make the "A" final of
the 500, won in convincing fashion by 10
seconds. Mosko was second, sophomores
Michael Zoldos and Trevor Scheid
grabbed the fourth and fifth spots and jun
ior Scotty Korotkin finishing sixth.
Stanford then grabbed two podium
spots in the 200-yard backstroke, with
Godsoe winning the event for the second
straight year and Thompson taking sec

ond. Cal's top sprinters, Nathan Adrian
and Graeme Moore, took the first two
spots in the 100-yard freestyle but the pres
ence of five Stanford athletes in the "A"
final ensured that the Cardinal would ex
tend their lead.
Lovelace then tied for second with jun
ior John Criste to give Stanford two more
medalists. Bollier followed up his prelimi
nary performance with a second Pac-10
record, winning the 200-yard fly, while
Mosko grabbed his third individual podi
um of the championships to ensure the vic
tory for the Cardinal.
The team will now head to the NCAA
Championships in Columbus, Ohio on
Mar. 25. Cardinal hopes of an NCAA title
were dampened somewhat earlier in the
year when NCAA champion Austin Staab
took a leave of absence from the Universi
ty, but the Pac-10 meet has the Cardinal
thinking of the title once again.
Top-ranked Arizona should be a much
greater threat at the NCAA meet than it
was at the conference meet. Most top swim
teams fully rest for only one event a year in
order to obtain NCAA qualifying times
and Arizona chose to do so in November
rather than at Pac-lOs as Stanford did. As a
result the Wildcats did not rest for the con
ference meet and are expected to swim
much better at NCAAs.
Although the athletes will have to wait

until all of the entries are declared, it ap
pears as though Stanford will bring close to
a full squad of 18 to the championship. A
number of Stanford swimmers will be in
contention for a national title, including
Godsoe in the backstroke events, la
Tourette in the 1650, Mosko in the 500 and
Bollier in the 200 fly.

Joining the top Pac-10 squads will be a
very strong Texas team ranked second in
the country. Defending champion Auburn
has dominated the sport this decade but is
only ranked sixth this year.

the 50-yard freestyle, respectively. The Cardinal capped
the session by winning the 200-yard freestyle relay.
The next day started well for the Cardinal with soph
omore Bobby Bollier winning the 400-yard IM, but Cal
came storming back. Led by winner Tom Shields, the
Bears scored 101 points in the 100-yard butterfly. Stan
ford swam well, with Lovelace making the podium in
the 100-yard breaststroke and senior Eugene Godsoe
successfully defending his title in the 100-yard back
stroke. The Bears were too strong, however, and used
their depth to take the lead following the 100-yard
backstroke.
Going into Saturday it was imperative
that the Cardinal swim well in the morning
session in order to place as many athletes
as possible in the "A" finals of the evening
session.
"We got some e-mails from many for
mer players last night who talked about
the tradition and the pride of being a Stan
ford swimmer" Godsoe said. "Everybody
was real fired up for today's meet because
we did not want to be the team that gave
up the streak."
The Cardinal did not disappoint in the
morning session. Bollier set the Pac-10
record in the 200 fly in the prelims and
Stanford placed five swimmers in the "A"
final of the 100-yard free, setting up the
Cardinal for victory.
The tone was set in the first event of the
evening session when Stanford took five of
the top six places in the 1650 free. Sopho
more Chad la Tourette, who had disap
pointingly failed to make the "A" final of
the 500, won in convincing fashion by 10
seconds. Mosko was second, sophomores
Michael Zoldos and Trevor Scheid
grabbed the fourth and fifth spots and jun
ior Scotty Korotkin finishing sixth.
Stanford then grabbed two podium
spots in the 200-yard backstroke, with
Godsoe winning the event for the second
straight year and Thompson taking sec

ond. Cal's top sprinters, Nathan Adrian
and Graeme Moore, took the first two
spots in the 100-yard freestyle but the pres
ence of five Stanford athletes in the "A"
final ensured that the Cardinal would ex
tend their lead.
Lovelace then tied for second with jun
ior John Criste to give Stanford two more
medalists. Bollier followed up his prelimi
nary performance with a second Pac-10
record, winning the 200-yard fly, while
Mosko grabbed his third individual podi
um of the championships to ensure the vic
tory for the Cardinal.
The team will now head to the NCAA
Championships in Columbus, Ohio on
Mar. 25. Cardinal hopes of an NCAA title
were dampened somewhat earlier in the
year when NCAA champion Austin Staab
took a leave of absence from the Universi
ty, but the Pac-10 meet has the Cardinal
thinking of the title once again.
Top-ranked Arizona should be a much
greater threat at the NCAA meet than it
was at the conference meet. Most top swim
teams fully rest for only one event a year in
order to obtain NCAA qualifying times
and Arizona chose to do so in November
rather than at Pac-lOs as Stanford did. As a
result the Wildcats did not rest for the con
ference meet and are expected to swim
much better at NCAAs.
Although the athletes will have to wait

until all of the entries are declared, it ap
pears as though Stanford will bring close to
a full squad of 18 to the championship. A
number of Stanford swimmers will be in
contention for a national title, including
Godsoe in the backstroke events, la
Tourette in the 1650, Mosko in the 500 and
Bollier in the 200 fly.

Joining the top Pac-10 squads will be a
very strong Texas team ranked second in
the country. Defending champion Auburn
has dominated the sport this decade but is
only ranked sixth this year.
