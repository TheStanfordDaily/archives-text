With a strong team effort that featured both individ
ual standouts and unparalleled depth, the Stanford
men's swimming and diving team won its 29th consec
utive Pac-10 championship under head coach Skip
Kenney. The No. 3 Cardinal trailed No. 4 California by
10 points following the evening session on Friday, but
on Saturday, the final day of competition, the men
demonstrated the kind of poise and resolve that leads
to 29 straight titles.
"It was one of the best team efforts, top to bottom,
that I have ever witnessed," Kenney said.
After the first full day of competition on Thursday,
the Cardinal held an 82-point lead over Cal. No. 1 Ari
zona was third, just three points behind Cal. Stanford
dominated the 500-yard freestyle, scoring 83 points as
junior David Mosko won the event with an NCAA "A"
cut. The Cardinal had four other swimmers in the
championship final and three more in the consolation
final.
Swimming scores 16 places and there are eight
swimmers to a race. Based on their times in the prelim
inaries swum in the morning session, the top 16 athletes
are divided between the championship or "A" final and
the consolation or "B" final. The winner of the "A" final
scores 20 points while eighth place scores 11. The win
ner of the "B" final scores nine points and eighth place
scores one.
Stanford continued to swim well throughout the
evening session, with freshman Matthew Thompson
and sophomore Curtis Lovelace each finishing in the
top four of the 200-yard IM, while senior David Dun
ford and junior Alex Coville took second and third in
the 50-yard freestyle, respectively. The Cardinal capped
the session by winning the 200-yard freestyle relay.
The next day started well for the Cardinal with soph
omore Bobby Bollier winning the 400-yard IM, but Cal
came storming back. Led by winner Tom Shields, the
Bears scored 101 points in the 100-yard butterfly. Stan
ford swam well, with Lovelace making the podium in
the 100-yard breaststroke and senior Eugene Godsoe
successfully defending his title in the 100-yard back
stroke. The Bears were too strong, however, and used
their depth to take the lead following the 100-yard
