# DISAPPOINTING SENIOR NIGHT
## 
### WYN DAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For a summary of Stanford's 2009-2010
campaign, look no further than Saturday's
71-61 loss to Cal on Senior Night.
The Cardinal (13-17,7-11 Pac-10) lived
and died with the three, relied heavily on
Landry Fields, missed free throws, gener
ated little presence down low and was
scrappy enough to give its opponent seri
ous fits before fading late in the game.
It was a contest with much on the line.
For Cal (21-9,13-5), the school's first con
ference title since 1960. For Stanford, the
chance to prevent its rival from attaining
that goal outright, and positioning in the
Pac-10 Tournament a win would keep
the Cardinal out of the play-in game, while
a loss would put its standing in jeopardy.
Cal was ranked in the top 15 to begin
the year, while Stanford was expected to
place last in the conference, and the Gold
en Bears had beat up on the Cardinal in
early January, winning 92-66 in Berkeley.
But despite the apparent disparities be
tween the two teams, the rematch was an
intense, closely contested affair.
"Both teams played like the game
meant a lot," said Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "Both teams played as
hard as they could play."
Certainly neither squad suffered from
lack of effort, but there were clear areas
where Cal was able to gain an early advan
tage namely, rebounding and scoring in
the paint. Stanford's small lineup Jack
Trotter is the only big man in the starting
five had difficulty contending with the
Bears' front line. The result was a 10-point
Cal lead at the 7:44 mark of the first half,
with the Bears winning the rebounding
battle (15 boards, with six offensive, versus
Stanford's five total rebounds, all defen
sive) and dominating in the paint nine
of their points came on second chance op
portunities (Stanford had zero) and 16 of
their total points came down low (Stan
ford had four).
"We had some letdowns in offensive re
bounds and stops, and the pace of the
game quickly changed in their favor,"
Fields said.
But Stanford, as it has for much of its
season, would not relent. A late first half

run cut the deficit to four going into the
locker room Maples Pavilion was as
loud as it has been all year, and momentum
appeared to be in Stanford's favor, even as
Fields appeared to be carrying the team by
himself. Outside of his 15 points, only
Drew Shiller had scored more than one
basket, Jeremy Green was cold (1-7 in the
first half) and the Cardinal was 3-8 from
the foul line. But there were positives, as
Stanford was able to limit Cal's domina
tion in the paint by rotating in the entirety
of their big man depth, and a quick switch
to a zone late in the half momentarily
stymied the Golden Bears.
"Stanford had a solid gameplan. They
went big, which is something they haven't
done," said Cal head coach Mike Mont
gomery, who won his first game as an op
ponent at Maples after coaching the Car
dinal for 18 years. "Our help situation was
hard to come by. They make it difficult to
do that."
Indeed, the game appeared to be in
reach, particularly after the Cardinal tied
the score with just over 14 minutes to play.
But Cal went on a quick 9-2 run to open a
lead, and Stanford was never able to close
it again. The same problems came back to
haunt the Cardinal trailing by three
with under three minutes to play, Stanford
had two opportunities to corral missed
shots by the Bears. Both times, a Cal play
er grabbed the offensive board, and after
three different attempts, scored.
The dagger came one possession later
when Patrick Christopher stole the ball
from Trotter and drained a long three
pointer to establish an eight point lead
with 1:40 to play.
"I saw the shot clock: it was down to
about nine. It was a good look and I was
feeling pretty good in the second half,"
Christopher said.
Christopher was integral to Cal's suc
cess: he finished with a team-high 23 points
after scoring just six in the first half. A shoe
change and a self-proclaimed "tightened
game" led to his resurgence late. He was
forced to account for a quiet second peri
od by reigning Pac-10 Player of the Week
Jamal Boykin (13 points total, but just two
after half time) and a sub-par game from


KYLE ANDERSON/The Stanford Daily
Senior forward Landry Fields put on a show in his final home game, scoring 25 points and grabbing
12 rebounds to lead Stanford, but it was not enough as the Cardinal lost 71 -61 to Cal.
Jerome Randle, who finished with 11
points but was just 2-10 from the field.
Dawkins acknowledged Shiller
for his tight man-to-man defense on
Randle, one of the top point guards
on the West Coast.
"Randle is a heck of a player and
game planning for him is a hard
thing," Dawkins said. "I give Drew

Schiller a lot of credit. He had to stick
with Randle. Containing him is the
best you're going to be able to do and
I thought Drew did a good job of
that."
Although neither player would
admit it, the secondary battle of the
night was for Pac-10 Player of the
Year, which was largely believed to be
between Randle, Fields and Washing
ton's Quincy Pondexter. Fields, who
had a game-high 25 points and 12 re
bounds, said that he'd give the award
to Randle, while Randle, much to
Christopher's dismay, said he'd give it

to Fields.
Neither Fields nor Randle has a
vote, though, and the conference's
coaches selected Randle over Fields
on Monday as Pac-10 Player of the
Year. Fields still made the All-Pac-10
First Team, while Green made the
Second Team.
Despite this loss and the loss to
Cal, the weekend was not all bad for
Stanford. The Cardinal avoided the
play-in game when Oregon beat
Washington State later in the night.
Stanford, seeded seventh, will face
Arizona State, ranked second, on

Mar. 11 in the opening round of the
Pac-10 Tournament at the Staples
Center.The Cardinal dropped both of
its games to the Sun Devils this year.
Los Angeles beckons, and the Car
dinal goes in with few outsized expec
tations and little to lose. Montgomery
described Stanford as a team that
gives its opponents "fits," but for the
Cardinal to have an extended post
season, it will have to do more than be
a nuisance.
