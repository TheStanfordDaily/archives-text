## Mixed weekend for Cardinal Stanford notches upset, then gets shut out in Fullerton 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An upset of No. 3 Florida highlighted the No. 10
Stanford Softball team's (15-3) 3-1 showing at the De-
Marini Invitational in Fullerton, Calif, last weekend.
Although it did beat Florida, the weekend was not all
positive for the Cardinal. Stanford was almost no-hit by
the University of North Carolina, and its opportunity to
avenge an earlier loss to Northwestern was rained out.
The Cardinal opened the weekend, however, with its
biggest win of the season.
Freshman pitcher Teagan Gerhart, who has essen
tially assumed the role of Stanford's No. 1 pitcher, was
the star of a 2-0 Cardinal victory, going the distance
while allowing just two hits and one walk and striking
out five Gator batters.
Another freshman, shortstop Jenna Rich, paced the
Stanford offense with a pair of clutch two-out RBIs.
Rich put the Cardinal on the board in the bottom of
the third with a two-out RBI single to left field, scoring
sophomore center fielder Sarah Flassman. Hassman
was hit by a pitch with one out and advanced to second
on sophomore second baseman Ashley Hansen's infield
single.
Stanford's offense was quiet until the bottom of the
fifth, when with two outs Rich struck again, this time
blasting her fourth home run of the season over the left
field fence.
Rich and the Cardinal rode their momentum into
their second game Friday, a 13-1 five-inning thrashing of
host Cal State Fullerton.
Rich was one of several offensive stars in the rout,
hitting two more home runs and knocking in five run
ners. Senior left fielder Alissa Haber also had three hits,
scored three runs and hit a homer.
Unfortunately for Stanford, it could not take some of
its offense from Friday and use it Saturday, as it was shut
out 3-0 by North Carolina.
Tar Heels' pitcher Danielle Spaulding took a perfect
game into the bottom of the seventh, when Stanford fi
nally mustered a base runner on Haber's infield single.
For the game, Spaulding struck out an impressive 18
Cardinal batters and allowed just the one infield hit.
In the afternoon Saturday, rainstorms forced the
Stanford-Northwestern game to be canceled, which pre
vented the Cardinal from seeking revenge against the
Wildcats, who beat Stanford on Feb. 26 at the Cathedral
City Classic.
Stanford was able to end the weekend on a positive
note, defeating the University of Indiana 4-0 on Sunday
morning, fueled by two Hansen RBI doubles one in
the first inning and a second in the fifth.
The Cardinal will now have 12 days off for final
exams before returning to the field during the school's
Spring Break Mar. 19, when it hosts the Stanford
Louisville Slugger Classic.
Coming to town for the four-day tournament are a
group of unranked opponents: Santa Clara, Princeton,
Saint Mary's and Cal Poly. The Cardinal will play Saint
Mary's twice and each other team once.
The highlight of the tournament will
likely be the reunion of the Gerhart
triplets: Teagan, Kelsey and Whitley. Tea
gan and Kelsey are freshmen on the Car
dinal squad while Whitley is a freshman
outfielder for Cal Poly.
After the Stanford Louisville Slugger

Classic, the Cardinal will travel to UC-
Davis for a single game on Tuesday, Mar.
23, and then host the Stanford Invita
tional, with Cal State Bakersfield,
Brigham Young University, UC-Califor
nia Santa Barbara and the University of
the Pacific coming to town the weekend
of Mar. 26-28.

The Stanford Invitational marks the
end of Stanford's pre-conference sched
ule, with rigorous Pacific-10 Conference
competition beginning in April during
Spring Quarter.

Penna, who graduated last year. Chinn and the Cardinal have performed well so far, leading to a top-10 ranking and a 15-3 record.
