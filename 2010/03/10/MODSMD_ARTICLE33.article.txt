# WINS BOOST CARD TO NO. 1
## Two four-set victories propel Stanford to top spot in rankings 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford men's volleyball team tri
umphed over two Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) opponents at home this weekend.
On Thursday, the Card (12-4, 10-4 MPSF) took
down No. 14 UC-San Diego (6-13,3-11 MPSF) which,
coupled with a loss by first place Pepperdine on Friday,
vaulted Stanford to first place in the MPSF.
"Obviously it is nice to be in first place, but we know
that every match we have is a tough one and we have to
stay focused for every one of them," sophomore libero
Erik Shoji said. "We are just hoping that we can play
the best we can and put our best foot forward."
Against UCSD, the Cardinal controlled the net,
recording 17 total blocks and hitting .406 on offense.
Sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson led the team
with 18 kills, while senior opposite Evan Romero and
sophomore middle blocker Gus Ellis each recorded
seven blocks.

"I think we played great defense last night," said
junior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin, who had nine
kills in the match. "If we can work more on our transi
tion offense after we get a dig, then I think our overall
game will be greatly improved."
As it was, Stanford had no trouble with UCSD in the
first two sets of the match, winning 30-18 and 30-20.
However, in the third set, the Card lost focus somewhat
and, after being up 11-6, lost the game 30-28. The team
came back with a lot more energy in the fourth set and
closed out the match with a solid 30-20 win.
A day after attaining the top spot in the conference,
the Card was forced to defend its standing against No.
6 Long Beach State (9-7,7-5 MPSF). While the 30-22,
30-25,26-30,30-21 victory was a team effort, two play
ers, McLachlin and senior setter Kawika Shoji, stood
out for Stanford.
For McLachlin, who led the team with 21 kills, the
match was his best since returning from a shoulder in
jury earlier in the season, and the team hopes it will be
an indication of things to come. On the other hand,
Shoji has excelled all season, and on Saturday, he
served his way into the Stanford record books. An ace
in the third set gave Shoji 91 aces for his career, a Stan
ford record in the rally-scoring era.
Lawson chipped in with 16 kills, and his 34 com
bined kills over the weekend helped him earn Nation
al Player of the Week honors.

In the first set of the match alone, McLachlin
recorded seven kills, and the Card displayed its im
pressive offensive abilities, hitting .447 and easily win
ning the set on a Long Beach State service error. The
second set was more of the same, as Stanford hit .548
and won the set, despite strong play by Long Beach
State's Dean Bittner, who finished with a game-high
24 kills.
The third set belonged to the 49ers, as they limited
Stanford to .167 hitting, but Long Beach State had to
share the limelight with Kawika Shoji as he recorded
his record-breaking ace. The fourth set remained close
until the Cardinal went on an 8-1 run to go up 27-20 be
fore winning the set and match.
"We are starting to build good chemistry on the
court and get into a good rhythm," McLachlin said. "If
we win the MPSF regular season, then we control our
destiny by earning a berth into the Final Four."
Stanford took another step toward extending its
season, as last weekend's wins boosted the Cardinal to
the top of the national rankings, which would likely
guarantee Stanford's spot in NCAAs in May.
The Cardinal is currently beginning an end-of-quar
ter scheduling break and will play a match against Cal
ifornia Baptist on March 20, before returning to con
ference play against UCSD on March 26.
