# TWO WALK-OFF WINS GIVE STANFORD SERIES
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In its first weekend series since
being swept on the road by No. 5
Texas, the Stanford baseball team had
a number of close calls at home
against UC-Santa Barbara. By the
end of the weekend, the No. 24 Cardi
nal (7-4) managed to pull out a 2-1 se
ries win over the Gauchos (4-4).
The series began on Friday
evening with sophomore Jordan Pries
starting on the mound against Mario
Hollands for UCSB. After giving up
two runs in the first inning, Pries set
tled down and pitched a scoreless sec
ond, third and fourth inning. After
giving up two more runs in the fifth.
Pries was pulled from the game in
favor of freshman Chris Jenkins.
Meanwhile, Stanford's offense was
anemic for the first three innings, scor
ing no runs off Hollands. In the fourth
and fifth innings, the bats came alive
for the Card it scored four runs to
knock Hollands out of the game.
After scoring one run apiece in the
seventh inning, the two teams entered
the ninth inning tied 5-5. After fresh
man pitcher Mark Appel held the
Gauchos scoreless in the eighth and
ninth innings, Stanford came to bat in
the bottom of the ninth looking for a
walk-off victory.
With the game on the line, the Car
dinal sent in junior pinch hitter
Jonathan Kaskow to face UCSB
pitcher Connor Whalen with two outs
and runners on first and third.
Kaskow hit a hard single down the
line to drive in freshman Stephen Pis
cotty and give Stanford the win, 6-5.
While it was able to pull out the
victory, the Cardinal still had signifi
cant deficiencies both offensively and
defensively. The top four of the Stan
ford order combined for just one hit
and no RBIs in 16 at-bats.
The defensive struggles of the Car
dinal infield also continued. Junior
second baseman Colin Walsh and
freshman third baseman Kenny
Diekroeger both committed errors in
the game. Diekroeger's fielding has
been especially poor through Sat

urday's game, he has a .905 fielding
percentage for the season.
On Saturday, the Card came back
for another closely contested game. It
fell behind early to the Gauchos
junior starting pitcher Scott
Snodgress only pitched 2.1 innings
and gave up two runs on two hits and
four walks and found itself down
4-1 at the end of the fourth inning.
However, sophomore reliever
Brian Busick, who came into the
game in the fourth inning with the
bases loaded, was almost flawless for
Stanford. In six innings of work, Bu
sick gave up only one hit and no walks
or runs, while striking out six batters.
"I just felt like I needed to come in,
throw strikes and keep us in the
game," he said. "Eventually we'd
come back and score some runs to get
back into it."
"I didn't expect to stay in that long,
but I was going to do whatever I could
to help us win," he continued.
Junior pitcher Alex Pracher was
also strong, giving up only one hit and
no runs in 1.2 innings in relief of Bu
sick.
The Cardinal offense also found a
way to come back from its deficit. It
scored two runs in the fifth inning and
one more in the eighth to draw even at
4-4. After neither team scored in the
ninth inning, the game went to extras.
After a scoreless 10th inning,
Pracher held UCSB to no runs in the
top of the 11th. In the bottom of the
11th, junior shortstop Jake Schlander
hit the first pitch from David Meals
over the left field wall to give the Car
dinal a 5-4 victory and its second
walk-off win in two days. Up to that
point, Schlander had been very quiet,
with no hits in four at-bats.
Hie final game of the series was
very different from the first two, with
UCSB winning a 26-run slugfest by a
final score of 15-11.
The Gauchos started the game off
very strongly, blasting sophomore
Stanford starter Brett Mooneyham
for six runs in the first inning.
Mooneyham was removed from the

Jonathan Kaskow and a homer by Jake Schlander.
game after pitching just 0.1 innings.
He gave up four hits, six earned runs
and three walks on 36 pitches.
Stanford's pitching for the rest of
the game remained ineffective. After
Mooneyham, the Card used a succes
sion of six pitchers. With the excep
tion of Pracher, every Stanford pitch
er gave up at least one earned run.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal's offen
sive production was highly inconsis
tent. Apart from an eight-run out
burst in the sixth inning, Stanford was
shut down by UCSB's pitching, scor
ing no runs in the last three innings.
The Cardinal offense was led by
freshman right fielder Tyler Gaffney
and designated hitter Adam Gaylord,
who each had three RBIs.
"When you're behind, there's a
mentality that you need to keep
going," Gaffney said. "Not all at once,
but here and there get some runs."
When asked about the sixth-in

ning rally, he said, "We got some mo
mentum, we picked it up from there
and eight runs came out of that in
ning."
Head coach Mark Marquess felt
that offense made the difference for
the game.
"They just outslugged us today,"
said head coach Mark Marquess. "We
couldn't get them out. They did a
great job with the bats."
"We just dug ourselves in a hole
that was too big of a hole to get out
of," he continued.
Marquess also highlighted com
mand and control as an area for im
provement for his pitching staff. Stan
ford pitchers surrendered 10 walks
during the course of the game.
The team will take next weekend
off for finals. Its next games are a
weekend series at Sunken Diamond
against Pepperdine on Mar. 19,20 and
21. The Waves are currently 4-7 and
have four more games before visiting
The Farm. The games will start at 6:30
p.m., 2 p.m. and 1 p.m. respectively.

Meanwhile, the Cardinal's offen
sive production was highly inconsis
tent. Apart from an eight-run out
burst in the sixth inning, Stanford was
shut down by UCSB's pitching, scor
ing no runs in the last three innings.
The Cardinal offense was led by
freshman right fielder Tyler Gaffney
and designated hitter Adam Gaylord,
who each had three RBIs.
"When you're behind, there's a
mentality that you need to keep
going," Gaffney said. "Not all at once,
but here and there get some runs."
When asked about the sixth-in

ning rally, he said, "We got some mo
mentum, we picked it up from there
and eight runs came out of that in
ning."
Head coach Mark Marquess felt
that offense made the difference for
the game.
"They just outslugged us today,"
said head coach Mark Marquess. "We
couldn't get them out. They did a
great job with the bats."
"We just dug ourselves in a hole
that was too big of a hole to get out
of," he continued.
Marquess also highlighted com
mand and control as an area for im
provement for his pitching staff. Stan
ford pitchers surrendered 10 walks
during the course of the game.
The team will take next weekend
off for finals. Its next games are a
weekend series at Sunken Diamond
against Pepperdine on Mar. 19,20 and
21. The Waves are currently 4-7 and
have four more games before visiting
The Farm. The games will start at 6:30
p.m., 2 p.m. and 1 p.m. respectively.

In its first weekend series since
being swept on the road by No. 5
Texas, the Stanford baseball team had
a number of close calls at home
against UC-Santa Barbara. By the
end of the weekend, the No. 24 Cardi
nal (7-4) managed to pull out a 2-1 se
ries win over the Gauchos (4-4).
The series began on Friday
evening with sophomore Jordan Pries
starting on the mound against Mario
Hollands for UCSB. After giving up
two runs in the first inning, Pries set
tled down and pitched a scoreless sec
ond, third and fourth inning. After
giving up two more runs in the fifth.
Pries was pulled from the game in
favor of freshman Chris Jenkins.
Meanwhile, Stanford's offense was
anemic for the first three innings, scor
ing no runs off Hollands. In the fourth
and fifth innings, the bats came alive
for the Card it scored four runs to
knock Hollands out of the game.
After scoring one run apiece in the
seventh inning, the two teams entered
the ninth inning tied 5-5. After fresh
man pitcher Mark Appel held the
Gauchos scoreless in the eighth and
ninth innings, Stanford came to bat in
the bottom of the ninth looking for a
walk-off victory.
With the game on the line, the Car
dinal sent in junior pinch hitter
Jonathan Kaskow to face UCSB
pitcher Connor Whalen with two outs
and runners on first and third.
Kaskow hit a hard single down the
line to drive in freshman Stephen Pis
cotty and give Stanford the win, 6-5.
While it was able to pull out the
victory, the Cardinal still had signifi
cant deficiencies both offensively and
defensively. The top four of the Stan
ford order combined for just one hit
and no RBIs in 16 at-bats.
The defensive struggles of the Car
dinal infield also continued. Junior
second baseman Colin Walsh and
freshman third baseman Kenny
Diekroeger both committed errors in
the game. Diekroeger's fielding has
been especially poor through Sat

urday's game, he has a .905 fielding
percentage for the season.
On Saturday, the Card came back
for another closely contested game. It
fell behind early to the Gauchos
junior starting pitcher Scott
Snodgress only pitched 2.1 innings
and gave up two runs on two hits and
four walks and found itself down
4-1 at the end of the fourth inning.
However, sophomore reliever
Brian Busick, who came into the
game in the fourth inning with the
bases loaded, was almost flawless for
Stanford. In six innings of work, Bu
sick gave up only one hit and no walks
or runs, while striking out six batters.
"I just felt like I needed to come in,
throw strikes and keep us in the
game," he said. "Eventually we'd
come back and score some runs to get
back into it."
"I didn't expect to stay in that long,
but I was going to do whatever I could
to help us win," he continued.
Junior pitcher Alex Pracher was
also strong, giving up only one hit and
no runs in 1.2 innings in relief of Bu
sick.
The Cardinal offense also found a
way to come back from its deficit. It
scored two runs in the fifth inning and
one more in the eighth to draw even at
4-4. After neither team scored in the
ninth inning, the game went to extras.
After a scoreless 10th inning,
Pracher held UCSB to no runs in the
top of the 11th. In the bottom of the
11th, junior shortstop Jake Schlander
hit the first pitch from David Meals
over the left field wall to give the Car
dinal a 5-4 victory and its second
walk-off win in two days. Up to that
point, Schlander had been very quiet,
with no hits in four at-bats.
Hie final game of the series was
very different from the first two, with
UCSB winning a 26-run slugfest by a
final score of 15-11.
The Gauchos started the game off
very strongly, blasting sophomore
Stanford starter Brett Mooneyham
for six runs in the first inning.
Mooneyham was removed from the

Junior second baseman Colin Walsh connects for a three-run home run in the sixth inning of Sunday's game between Stanford and UC-Santa Barbara. The
Cardinal scored eight runs in the inning, but it was not enough as the Gauchos prevailed 15-11. Stanford won the first two games on walk-off hits, a single by
Jonathan Kaskow and a homer by Jake Schlander.
game after pitching just 0.1 innings.
He gave up four hits, six earned runs
and three walks on 36 pitches.
Stanford's pitching for the rest of
the game remained ineffective. After
