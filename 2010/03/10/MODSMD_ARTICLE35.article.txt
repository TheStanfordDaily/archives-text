# HEATED BATTLE AT NCAAs AWAITS
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With conference meets around the
country now concluded, the field is set for
this year's NCAA Championships in
women's swimming. After its strong per
formance at the Pac-10 Tournament, No. 1
Stanford (9-0,5-0 Pac-10) looks poised to
contend for the national title.
Last weekend, the Cardinal took home
the Pac-10 championship after thoroughly
outclassing its top three rivals No. 4 Ari
zona, No. 5 California and No. 9 Southern
California. With the win, Stanford has its
first conference championship since 2005
and the first in head coach Lea Maurer's
tenure.
In two weeks, the Card will head to
NCAAs, which will be held at Purdue in
West Lafayette, Ind. Stanford will enter the

meet sharing the No. 1 national ranking
with Georgia. Outside of the Pac-10, other
teams expected to contend strongly are
No. 3 Texas, No. 6 Florida and No. 7 Texas
A&M.
"Georgia's the frontrunner right now,"
Maurer said. "They were second last year .
.. we're focusing on having people seeded
well, and on having other people move up.
I think we'll be in the hunt."
For now, Maurer's focus is on prepara
tion. She said that she will not look to ac
tively scout other teams to see how Stan
ford stacks up against the competition.
"The only thing I can control is the
preparation," she said. "We're looking re
ally good bouncing back from Pac-lOs, and
we're focused on having our swimmers
shine."
Stanford qualified 12 swimmers to com
pete in Indiana, out of a possible total of

18. Several teams have sent bigger contin
gents, including Georgia with 17 athletes
and Arizona with 18. Despite this apparent
disparity, Maurer still believes that the
Card is in a good position to contend.
"We want as many people as possible to
score," she said. "All those people have
done well to put themselves in scoring po
sition. Now they have to repeat those per
formances."
Senior co-captains Julia Smit and
Elaine Breeden will lead Stanford at the
tournament. Both are defending NCAA
champions Smit in the 200- and 400-
yard individual medley and Breeden in the
200-yard butterfly.
Smit will enter the tournament on a
strong note after her electric performance
at Pac-lOs. In the course of the meet, she
broke two American records (in the 200
and 400 IM) and set a school record in a

third event (the 200-yard backstroke). She
ended the tournament with three individ
ual titles and six overall.
Breeden also had a strong showing,
winning the 100 fly and coming in second
in the 200.
There are a number of other swimmers
that will also need to replicate strong Pac
-10 performances. Junior Liz Smith, who
won the 200-yard breaststroke, will be
called upon to turn in fast times in the same
event. Stanford will also look to junior
Kelsey Ditto for points in the long-dis
tance freestyle swims.
The NCAA Tournament will begin on
March 18 and continue through March 20.
The Cardinal is looking to capture its first
national title since 1998.
