## Blowout weekend for Stanford 
### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's water polo
team was extremely busy this past week
end. It faced San Diego State on Friday,
UC-Irvine on Saturday and Cal State
Bakersfield and UC-Davis on Sunday.
On Friday afternoon, the No. 2 Cardi
nal (14-1, 2-0 MPSF) was victorious
against the Aztecs by a final score of 11-
2.
Freshman two-meter Annika Dries

skipped three goals in the net. Sopho
more driver Pallavi Menon tacked on
two more goals. Sophomore driver
Cassie Churnside, sophomore two
meter Melissa Seidemann, senior driver
Kelsey Holshouser, junior driver Kim
Krueger, senior driver Kelly Eaton and
senior two-meter Jessica Steffens each
added a single point. Junior goalkeeper
Amber Oland saved seven shots while
freshman goalkeeper Kate Baldoni
saved six.
On Saturday, Stanford dominated the

Anteaters. The Cardinal came out
strong, ending the first half with a 7-0
lead. As the second half unfolded, UC-
Irvine only scored three points during
the third period and a single point during
the final period. The final score was 10-4,
giving the Cardinal its second win this
weekend.
Eaton and sophomore driver Alyssa
Lo each smashed in two goals. Churn
side, Dries, Steffens, Krueger, Menon
and Seidemann all skipped in a sin
gle goal. Oland saved three shots
while Baldoni saved six.
On Sunday, Stanford capped off
the weekend with two even bigger
blowout victories at the Aggie
Shootout. The Cardinal defeated Cal
State Bakersfield 17-1 in its most
dominating win of the season. Just
hours later, Stanford beat the
shootout's host. No. 15 UC-Davis,
11-1 to cap off a 4-0 weekend.
On March 21, the Cardinal will
play Arizona State; on the 27th it will
face off against UCLA; and finally
on the 28th the Card will go head to
head with Long Beach State.
Arizona State is currently ranked
sixth in the country. At the UC-
Irvine Invitational, Stanford defeat
ed the Sun Devils 15-8.
Arizona State also fell to Hawaii,
9-7, at that tournament. Since then,
the Sun Devils have gone undefeat
ed, with victories over Michigan, Cal
State Northridge and Cal State East
Bay.
The Cardinal will then play
UCLA in Los Angeles. Stanford
faced off against the Bruins on Feb.
28 at the UC-Irvine Invitational and
took a 10-4 victory. Later that day,
however, UCLA went head-to-head
with California and came out with a
close 7-6 victory.
The Bruins will be playing
Hawaii, UC-Irvine and Arizona

State before they see the Cardinal
again. UCLA is currently ranked
No. 3.
Long Beach State has not yet
played the Cardinal. Its most recent
matches were against USC, Loyola
Marymount, UC-Davis and UC-San
Diego at the UC-Irvine Invitational.
The 49ers were unable to return to
Long Beach with a win, as they lost
12-1 to USC, 12-7 to Loyola Mary
mount, 8-7 to UC-Davis and 10-9 to
UC-San Diego.
After Stanford's loss to USC at
the UC-Irvine Invitational, the team
feels optimistic about all of its up
coming matches.
"We know what we need to work
on, and we will be able to carry this
feeling throughout the rest of the
season as motivation," Krueger said.
With its No. 2 ranking, the Cardi
nal is now more motivated than ever
to earn back the top national rank
ing, which it lost after the USC
match.
"If anything, it has motivated us
even more to work hard and to come
back out and show what this team is
really about," Baldoni said. "If we do
that, we will still have a good shot at
the title."
After a two-week break for finals,
the next matches for Stanford will be
against Arizona State at the Avery
Aquatic Center at 1 p.m. on March
21, against UCLA in Los Angeles,
Calif, at 1 p.m. on March 27 and final
ly against Long Beach State in Long
Beach, Calif, at 12 p.m. on March 28.
