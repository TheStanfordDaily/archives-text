### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend marked the first outdoor meet of
the season for the Stanford track and field team,
setting a tone for the next few months of stiff out
door competition.This was not a full team, though,
as a few athletes were in Arkansas for a last-chance
meet, and another large contingent did not partic
ipate in order to prepare for the upcoming NCAA
Indoor Nationals.
The Cardinal had a strong performance on its
home field, with sophomore Geoffrey Tabor lead
ing the way. Tabor won the shot put with a mark of
57-3, and won the discus with amark of 184-10. An
other meet title winner in the throws was freshman
Robert Hintz, who won the javelin with a toss of
193-2.
In the sprints, senior Mark Mueller led the men,
winning the 200 meters with a time of 21.80.
On the women's side, the Cardinal was led by
freshman Elaine Patten, who won the high jump
with a leap of 5-7. Junior Natasha Barthel also
fared well in the field events, finishing second in the
pole vault with a mark of 12-5.
In an exciting 800 race, freshman Justine Fre
dronic and junior Maddie Duhon finished first and
second. They finished with times of 2:12.35 and
2:12.79 in an extremely close race. Fredronic and
Duhon were at the front of the pack the entire
time, taking turns maintaining the lead.
In the women's 4x4 relay, freshman Karynn
Dunn had a great run, pulling the team into the
lead with a powerful sprint. Freshman Hannah
Farley also had a strong performance, anchoring
the team with an impressive run where she main
tained her speed for the entirety of the 400 meters.
The 400 is one of the toughest races, as it requires
an all-out sprint for such a long distance.
Coming up next for the Cardinal is the NCAA
Indoor Championships, which will prove both
challenging and exciting, as the Stanford men and
women try to prove themselves on a national scale.
"For nationals I just want to take it one day at
time," said sophomore distance runner Dylan Fer
ris. "I hope to relax in the mile preliminaries, and
then come back in the distance medley relay and
add four new All-Americans to the track roster. I
have a lot of confidence in the group we have for
the DMR."
The Cardinal will head off to Fayetteville, Ark.
this coming weekend, with a strong group of dis
tance runners leading the way for Stanford, includ
ing some talented freshmen.
