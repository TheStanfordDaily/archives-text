## Nation's best score propels Cardinal 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford men's gymnastics extended its winning
streak this weekend with two victories away from
home. On Friday, the Cardinal took on Air Force and
the University of Illinois-Chicago in Colorado
Springs, Colo. Stanford was able to pull out a 356.7-
338.5-336.2 win. Air Force placed second with its
highest team score of the season, while Illinois-
Chicago came in third.
On Sunday, the Cardinal took its California sun
shine over to the Cornhusker State, where it defeat
ed both No. 1 Oklahoma and Nebraska. Stanford
earned a 365.65 the top score in the nation this
season while Oklahoma trailed with a 360.3 and
Nebraska rounded out the meet with a 347.5.
The Cardinal had seemingly little competition at
Air Force, with individuals consistently posting
scores of 14.0 and above on the apparatuses. Fresh
man Eddie Penev stole the show on floor exercise,
posting a 15.65 that put him well ahead of any other
competitors. Junior Josh Dixon posted a 14.55 on
pommel horse, a score that boosted the Cardinal's
confidence in its most inconsistent event.
Sophomore Jordan Nolff kept his cool on still
rings, earning a 15.1. Junior Alex Buscaglia exploded
off the vault, leading the Cardinal with a 16.0. Senior
Nick Noone held steady on the parallel bars for a
score of 15.4, while Buscaglia kept it high on the hor
izontal bar for a score of 15.1.
With momentum from the Air Force meet, Stan
ford fought to the finish in Nebraska. It won three of
six events rings, vault and horizontal bar and
tied Oklahoma for first place on parallel bars.
Vault was a standout event for the Cardinal, with
five athletes putting up scores of 16.0 and above. The
team total of 65.55 was the highest score posted by
any collegiate team this season.
On rings, junior Tim Gentry posted the highest
score for the Cardinal with a 15.4, while freshman
James Fosco posted a 15.2.
"It was awesome," Fosco said. "Working on the
details [in my routine] really paid off."
Buscaglia led the Cardinal on horizontal bar, but
his fellow Stanford athletes were not far behind. Ju
niors Abhinav Ramani and Ryan Lieberman and
sophomores John Martin and Cameron Foreman all
posted scores of 14.7 and above,
Noone carried his parallel bars score from Friday
into Sunday's competition, earning another 15.4,
while Penev outdid his floor exercise score to earn a
15.7 in Nebraska. On pommel horse, Martin led the
Cardinal with a 14.75.
"I did what I've been doing in practice," Martin
said. "Finally, the countless repetition is paying off."
According to senior Lucas Hughes, beating Okla
homa was a huge confidence booster. Oklahoma has
often seemed unstoppable, winning numerous Cardi
nal-Sooner stand-offs, four straight Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) championships between
2004-2005 and 2007-2008 and NCAA championships
in 2004-2005, 2005-2006 and 2007-2008. This time
around, the Cardinal was the unstoppable one.
And with the NCAA Championship right around
the corner, the Stanford men now know what to ex
pect when they again face off against their bitter Ok
lahoman rivals.
"We felt their energy, we heard their yelling,"
Gentry said. "We didn't let it get to us. We wanted to
go out and make a statement."
The next meet for Stanford will be in Chicago, 111.
against Illinois-Chicago on March 26.
