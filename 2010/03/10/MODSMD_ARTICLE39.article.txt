## Cardinal earns season best 
### LAUREN TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team reached
new heights in this Friday's tri-meet victory over Bay
Area rivals San Jose State and California, achieving
its best team score of the season: 196.800. The No. 7
Cardinal delivered six individual scores of 9.9 and
above throughout the competition to defeat the
Spartans (195.075) and the Bears (190.775) and im
prove its record to 13-2.
Stanford won every event of the competition,
both individually and through its team scores. Senior
captain Carly Janiga was once again a standout, as
she captured the all-around victory with a score of
39.550, which matched her second-highest of the sea
son. Her scores of 9.95 on the balance beam and 9.925
on the floor earned an individual win in both events,
and her all-around included stellar performances on
the uneven bars (9.85) and the vault (9.825).
Junior Shelley Alexander and senior Allyse Ishi
no each scored 9.90s as well, claiming individual vic
tories on the vault and bars, respectively. But the
highlight of the competition for the Cardinal was the
team's uncharacteristically high-scoring perform
ance on the beam, which has not typically been its
strong suit. Stanford counted five scores of 9.8 or
higher in the event, including three in the 9.95: Jani
ga's 9.95, Alexander's 9.925 and Ishino's 9.9. These
contributed to the Card's 49.425 for the beam, which
was its second highest total of the season.
This tremendous consistency enabled Stanford to
defeat both San Jose State (8-9) and Cal (0-11) for
the second time this season and prove its supremacy
in the realm of Bay Area collegiate women's gymnas
tics. Stanford has now extended its consecutive win
ning streak against Cal to 20, dating back to 2000.
Thus, Stanford proved this weekend that it is con
tinuing to progress and gaining the necessary mo
mentum for the approaching Pac-10 Championships
on March 27. Stanford looks to achieve its preseason
goal of winning the Pac-lOs, but in order to do so, the
team will have to upset No. 3 UCLA and No. 6 Ore
gon State. The Cardinal has defeated UCLA twice in
dual meets this season already, but fell short to OSU
in late January.
Last year, Stanford came in third at the confer
ence championships with a score of 196.525, edged by
first place UCLA (196.725) and runner-up OSU
(196.55). The Cardinal had a lead going into its final
rotation and achieved nine season
bests during the competition, yet two
falls during the floor exercise forced
the team to count a 9.3 on the event

and let the lead slip away. The day
was full of success from an individual
standpoint, as Janiga captured the
all-around, head coach Kristen
Smyth was awarded Coach of the
Year and four out of five event victo
ries went to Cardinal athletes. Yet
these individual achievements were
bittersweet because of the overall
team loss, and Stanford looks to

make up for it during this year's
competition.

Stanford will have only one more
opportunity to compete before the
conference championships, as it will
head to UC-Davis for a dual meet on
March 21.
