# Chu calls for innovation
## U.S. Secretary of Energy says tech competition can help address climate change 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu spoke
Monday about the need for increased competition
in technological innovation and energy efficiency
in the fight against global warming.
Some 1,700 students and faculty members filled
Memorial Auditorium to hear Chu's lecture, enti
tled "Meeting the Energy and Climate Challenge."
The event was hosted by the ASSU's Green Al
liance for Innovative Action.
The Nobel Prize-winning physicist and former
Stanford professor began his talk by calling for a

"new industrial revolution to give us the energy we
need ... but in a much cleaner form."
He said that the country needs a comprehensive
energy bill and a price on carbon so that business
es will have an incentive to go green, rather than al
lowing them to choose "business as usual," which is
cheaper in the short run.
Chu also explained the science behind human
induced climate change, showing how tempera
tures are rising and proportions of carbon-14 (Cl 4)
an organic form of carbon found in plants and
animals are decreasing more quickly than
would happen naturally.
"It's more than a smoking gun," Chu said. "The

question is not if the earth will warm up, but how
much it will warm up."
Chu's analysis of global climate and evident ex
pertise received positive reactions from several
students.
"I feel some people probably didn't have the
scientific background to fully understand his exam
ples," said John Melas-Kyriazi 'll. "For those of us
who did, it was very compelling and interesting, so
I'm glad he did."
Others, like Michael Cruz 'l2, a member of the
ASSU's sustainability subcommittee, wished that
