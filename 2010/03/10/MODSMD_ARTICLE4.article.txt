# Chu calls for innovation
## U.S. Secretary of Energy says tech competition can help address climate change 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu spoke
Monday about the need for increased competition
in technological innovation and energy efficiency
in the fight against global warming.
Some 1,700 students and faculty members filled
Memorial Auditorium to hear Chu's lecture, enti
tled "Meeting the Energy and Climate Challenge."
The event was hosted by the ASSU's Green Al
liance for Innovative Action.
The Nobel Prize-winning physicist and former
Stanford professor began his talk by calling for a

"new industrial revolution to give us the energy we
need ... but in a much cleaner form."
He said that the country needs a comprehensive
energy bill and a price on carbon so that business
es will have an incentive to go green, rather than al
lowing them to choose "business as usual," which is
cheaper in the short run.
Chu also explained the science behind human
induced climate change, showing how tempera
tures are rising and proportions of carbon-14 (Cl 4)
an organic form of carbon found in plants and
animals are decreasing more quickly than
would happen naturally.
"It's more than a smoking gun," Chu said. "The

question is not if the earth will warm up, but how
much it will warm up."
Chu's analysis of global climate and evident ex
pertise received positive reactions from several
students.
"I feel some people probably didn't have the
scientific background to fully understand his exam
ples," said John Melas-Kyriazi 'll. "For those of us
who did, it was very compelling and interesting, so
I'm glad he did."
Others, like Michael Cruz 'l2, a member of the
ASSU's sustainability subcommittee, wished that

Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, a
Nobel laureate and former Stanford
physics professor, said Monday that
humans' impact on climate is
"more than a smoking gun."
Chu had used his time to talk about
energy policy and "how you change
individuals' mindsets the Ameri
can mindset rather than so much
about the nitty-gritty."
Chu warned that the United
States might lose its leading position
in the world in the absence of further
technological advances. Decades
ago, Americans were at the forefront
of automobile technology, energy
transmission and nuclear power.
Now, countries in Europe and Asia
are investing more money in those
fields.
"If we hold off the inevitable for
another five years or 10 years, we'll
lose because other countries are
ahead," Chu said. "We will play
catch-up and the United States is at
risk. Energy touches everything in
the United States."
According to the Nobel laureate,
China spends $9 billion a month on
clean energy, investing heavily in
wind energy. Chu recalled an occa
sion in which he asked the head of
their state grid about how he got peo
ple to pay for the system.
"Well, of course, nobody likes
money taken out of their wallets, but
we tell them how important it is," the
unnamed official responded to Chu.
"Different system," Chu quipped
to the laughing audience.
But Chu went on to acknowledge
the United States' longstanding role
as an "innovation machine," adding
that the Obama administration's
new policies provide a "reason to
hope."
"Scientists have come to the serv
ice of our country in times of nation
al need," he said.
Contributing to this effort, Chu
said the Department of Energy
hopes to foster scientific communi
ties that encourage collaborative,
multidisciplinary innovations.
The Department of Energy also
has established an agency called the
Advanced Research Projects
Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to fund
"high-risk, high-reward" projects.
Stanford received $4.9 million in Oc
tober to research incentives for ener
gy-efficient behavior in homes and
small businesses.

On an individual basis, Chu also
said that Americans need to learn to
use energy more wisely. For example,
he stated that more energy efficient
fridges have saved an amount of
electricity greater "than all the re
newable wind and solar energy we
make today."
"That's how important energy ef
ficiency is," he added.
Chu also offered suggestions to
students on how to be more energy
efficient, such as becoming more in
formed, turning off lights, shutting off
water and putting a computer to
sleep.
Some students found these latter
suggestions somewhat lacking in
substance.
"The only thing that rang a little
sour for me was the answer to what
young people can do," said Eli Pollak
'l2. "I would never downplay the im
portance of individual action, but
young people, especially as talented
a group of young people as you had
in the room today, have an essential
role in driving forward the techno
logical advances for this issue."
Chu also spoke Monday evening
at a panel, along with Henry Kelly,
the Department of Energy principal
deputy assistant secretary; Lynn Orr,
the director of the Stanford Precourt
Institute for Energy; Camron
Gorguinpou, the executive director
of Scientists & Engineers for Ameri
ca and moderator Teryn Norris, the
director of Americans for Energy
Leadership, who is also a Daily
columnist.
