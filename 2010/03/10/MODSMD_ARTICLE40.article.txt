## Making an impact at NCAAs 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Despite its sixth-place finish at last
week's Pac-10 Championships in
Davis, Calif., the Stanford wrestling
team has a final shot at redemption
this year's NCAA Tournament. The
championships will be held from
March 18-20 in Omaha, Neb.
While there is a team component
to the NCAA Tournament, Stanford
has little chance to score highly on the
team table. The Card has only secured
two automatic bids to the tournament,
and has not been able to keep up with
the country's elite teams this season.
However, a few individual athletes
have chances to make a significant im
pact in Omaha.
Stanford was somewhat under
whelming in the regular season, end
ing with a final record of 10-8-1 and a
conference record of 2-3-1. The Card
was only able to truly dominate one
conference opponent in a Feb. 12
match against Cal State Bakersfield,
Stanford took a 24-13 victory. Its other

conference win, a Feb. 6 contest
against UC-Davis, was incredibly
close.The meet came down to the final
match, but Stanford was able to eke
out a 20-19 victory.
There were a few bright spots dur
ing Stanford's regular season. Red
shirt sophomore Nick Amuchastegui
and redshirt junior Zack Giesen were
both extremely strong all year. Both
are currently ranked in the top 15 na
tionally in their respective weight
classes. Amuchastegui and Giesen
also posted very good win-loss records
both have over 25 wins and less
than 10 losses.
Freshman Ryan Mango also
emerged as a force for Stanford.
Though his win-loss record was not
quite as illustrious as those of Giesen
and Amuchastegui, he still won more
than 20 matches for a strong start to
his career.
At the Pac-10 Championships,
Amuchastegui won a conference title

in the 165-pound weight class, while
Mango and Giesen both got third
place in the 125- and 184-pound class-

es, respectively. Mango significantly
exceeded expectations he was
seeded fifth and won three matches
against higher-seeded opponents. On
the other hand, Giesen was expected
to reach the final, but instead fell in a
close semifinal match decided by a sin
gle point.
By virtue of their finishes in Davis,
both Amuchastegui and Mango have
earned automatic bids to the NCAA
Tournament. While the NCAA's at
large berths are not announced until
March 10, Giesen has a very good
chance of receiving an at-large bid due
to his strong regular-season record.
Head coach Jason Borrelli is hop
ing that two other wrestlers 133-
pound redshirt junior Justin Paulsen
and 157-pound redshirt junior Lucas
Espericueta earn at-large berths.
Since both wrestlers only managed
fifth-place finishes at the Pac-10 Tour
nament, it is unclear how good their
chances are to make the tournament.
