## Card enters break with rivalry win 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An upset win over California (9-3) is great
news any day, but particularly great for the No. 14
Stanford women's tennis team (9-1) as it allows
the Cardinal to hold momentum going into a
three-week break for finals.
The Cardinal won the first point of the day
when the No. 27 team of freshmen Mallory Bur
dette and Stacey Tan won at the No. 2 spot with a
score of 8-6. The No. 2 duo of junior Hilary Barte
and senior Lindsay Burdette sealed the doubles
point with a win of the same score over the No. 13
pair of Mari Andersson and Jana Juricova. Stan
ford's sophomore Veronica Li and junior Carolyn
McVeigh completed the sweep with a third 8-6
score.
"If you look at the results the last couple of
years, there are so many 4-3 scores these days in
college tennis," said Stanford head coach Lele
Forood. "Clearly winning the doubles point is sig
nificant. They got close in the middle, we were
down a break at No. 1 for a while, but we got it to
gether and wound up with all three. That bodes
well for us going forward."
Players on both teams came out tense in the be
ginning before Stanford pulled it together to move
ahead in all matches.
"For doubles, it was a little bit tight, especial
ly at first," Mallory Burdette said. "We definitely
responded to the pressure well today and I feel
like we all broke out toward the beginning of
the sets to take leads. It felt great to take the
doubles point and [it] gave us a lot of confi
dence."
Singles proved to be a closer affair at the
end, but Stanford was able to keep the early
momentum up. No. 28 Mallory Burdette came
off first with a 6-0, 6-1 win. Next, No. 9 Barte

upset No. 2 Juricova 6-3,6-3 to put the Cardinal
up 3-0.
"I started off really well, but she came back,"
Barte said. "It got really tight in the first set, but I
just persevered. She didn't play very well, but that
was the story of the whole match."
Cal mounted a bit of a comeback, winning at
the No. 2 and 3 spots in that order to cut the deficit
to 3-2. The match came down to the two matches at
No. 5 and 6, both developing into three-set battles.
Li provided the clincher when she defeated Nelly
Radeva 6-1,4-6,6-2 to win the day. No. 95 McVeigh
made the victory even sweeter by beating out Cal's
Tayler Davis 7-5,3-6,6-4.
"Things did get tight in singles, obviously," Mal
lory Burdette said. "[Singles spots] five and six
went to three sets we lost at two and three. It
was a bit of a nail-biter toward the end, but it was
a great day to win."
The Cardinal will now take a three-week break
before coming back on March 21 to take on Cal
Poly. Practice involves maintaining the momen
tum the women have earned from their win over
their rivals.
"Right now it's maintenance," Forood said.
"We need to stay together, keep working out and
hope we don't slip a little during the break."
