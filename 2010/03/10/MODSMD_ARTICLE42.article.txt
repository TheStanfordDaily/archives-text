### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After two heartbreaking losses against Cal
and USC, the Stanford men's tennis team got a
welcome break from the dual match format.
This weekend, five Stanford doubles teams par
ticipated in the 121 st annual Pacific Coast Dou
bles tournament in La Jolla, Calif, and per
formed impressively.

The tournament is hosted by the USTA and
is open to male tennis players of all ages pro
or amateur.
The Pacific Coast Doubles gives a chance
for players who do not usually crack the dou
bles lineup to play doubles in a highly compet
itive environment.
On Friday, Stanford set the tone for the
weekend when all five doubles teams won their
first round matches.
Freshmen Walker Kehrer and Sam Ecker
played collegiate doubles together for the first
time and went down in the round of 64 after
their first round victory.
Juniors Greg Hirshman and Ted Kelly also
lost in the second round, 6-3,1-6,6-2. Hirshman
is not a regular in the doubles lineup, but is un
defeated thus far in his singles matches.
Junior Alex Clayton and senior Richard
Wire, who usually play No. 2 doubles for Stan
ford, won two matches before losing to the top
seeded team. They lost to a squad of ex-pros in
an excruciatingly close match 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2).
Freshmen Matt Kandath and Denis Lin, who
hold down the third spot in dual matches, got
some revenge for the Cardinal's loss against
USC last Saturday. They defeated JT Sundling
and Daniel Nguyen of USC in the round of 16,
5-7,6-3,6-3.
"After the crushing loss against USC it was
great to beat a team that has had a lot of success
on the junior level," Kandath said.
Sophomores Bradley Klahn and Ryan
Thacher, who are ranked No. 2 in the nation,
had the best weekend of all.
Stanford's top pair was granted a first round
bye and proceeded to win four matches in a row.
The semi-finals and finals were scheduled
for Sunday afternoon, but the tournament was
canceled due to rain and swirling winds.
The Cardinal will take a two-week break
from matches for Dead Week and finals before
it hits the road over spring break.
Stanford will play in Urbana-Champaign, 111.,
against No. 13 Illinois on March 23.The Cardinal
will then head to Ann Arbor, Mich., for a match
against the Michigan Wolverines. Michigan
upset No. 15 Cal on Thursday.
