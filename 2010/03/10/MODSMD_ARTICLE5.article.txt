## After Chile quake, BOSP reviews prep Protocol 'worked pretty well,' but reaching parents was difficult 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When a magnitude 8.8 earthquake hit
Chile on Feb. 27, the staff of the Bing Over
seas Study Program (BOSP) in Santiago,
where 21 Stanford students were studying,
put their emergency protocols into action.
Now, they're assessing how it went.
"In some ways it's an opportunity, be
cause we were so lucky that all the students
were okay but it tested the system," said
Irene Kennedy, executive director of BOSP.
"I think [the emergency procedures]
worked pretty well."
One student, Lyla Johnston 'll, was in
jured when she jumped from the third-floor
balcony of her host family's house. She has
since returned to the United States for med

ical care, she told The Daily.
Staff followed protocols after the quake,
which happened early on a Saturday morn
ing. Using a phone tree, they contacted all
21 students in the program, some of whom
were in Santiago and some of whom were
traveling for the weekend.The students had
instructions to call the office in an emer
gency; in other cities where BOSP operates,

there are assembly points outside Stan
ford's facilities.
The Stanford campus office attempts to
remain constantly in contact with BOSP
staff on the ground during emergencies,
whether by phone, e-mail or, if telecommu
nication services are down, satellite phone.

Stanford students in the Bing Overseas Studies Program in Santiago volunteer in a
clean-up effort after last weekend's magnitude 8.8 earthquake. One student was injured Feb. 27.
Stanford has a contract with In
ternational SOS, a health care com
pany, to evacuate students in case of
medical emergencies or natural dis
asters, Kennedy said. The instances
calling for that service are few and far
between.
Staff in Santiago did encounter
challenges contacting the parents of
the students there and answering
other people's questions with limited
information about the situation on
the ground, according to Kennedy.
The BOSP office is set this week
to debrief and examine their han
dling of the earthquake while also
planning for the Santiago program
next quarter, which will remain open.
The only change will be travel restric
tions to the Concepcion area, where
the bulk of quake damage occurred.
Sophomores Zach Ming and
Sarah Hennessy, who were both ac
cepted to the Santiago program, said
they're still planning to go next quar
ter.
"I'm not that worried about safe
ty â€” they're prepared for it," said
Hennessy, who is majoring in human
biology with a concentration in disas
ter relief. Her parents "were definite
ly concerned about it at first, but they
were never going to tell me I couldn't
go ... they trust Stanford's judg
ment."
Ming agreed, saying his parents
weren't too worried after Stanford
confirmed the program would be
open. He did voice some concern for
safety, but not enough to dissuade
him from going.
"I wouldn't say I'm not concerned
about safety," he said. "I think the
earthquake is going to change the na
ture of the trip ... I'm still excited."
Kennedy said a few students are
planning to drop out of the program.
Students enrolled have until Friday
to withdraw without penalty.
But, Ming said, "I think it's almost
more desirable to go down. This is
going to make it even unique among
overseas opportunities."
Excepting the travel restrictions,
the Santiago program will continue
as normal, with students set to arrive
March 27-28 at home stays.
