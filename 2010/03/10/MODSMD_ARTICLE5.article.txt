## After Chile quake, BOSP reviews prep Protocol 'worked pretty well,' but reaching parents was difficult 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When a magnitude 8.8 earthquake hit
Chile on Feb. 27, the staff of the Bing Over
seas Study Program (BOSP) in Santiago,
where 21 Stanford students were studying,
put their emergency protocols into action.
Now, they're assessing how it went.
"In some ways it's an opportunity, be
cause we were so lucky that all the students
were okay but it tested the system," said
Irene Kennedy, executive director of BOSP.
"I think [the emergency procedures]
worked pretty well."
One student, Lyla Johnston 'll, was in
jured when she jumped from the third-floor
balcony of her host family's house. She has
since returned to the United States for med

ical care, she told The Daily.
Staff followed protocols after the quake,
which happened early on a Saturday morn
ing. Using a phone tree, they contacted all
21 students in the program, some of whom
were in Santiago and some of whom were
traveling for the weekend.The students had
instructions to call the office in an emer
gency; in other cities where BOSP operates,

there are assembly points outside Stan
ford's facilities.
The Stanford campus office attempts to
remain constantly in contact with BOSP
staff on the ground during emergencies,
whether by phone, e-mail or, if telecommu
nication services are down, satellite phone.
