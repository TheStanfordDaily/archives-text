## Terminal grad fees fall slightly 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Tuition for some graduate students will go in an unexpect
ed direction starting this fall: down.
While tuition for undergraduates rose again this year, rates
for a segment of the graduate school population will actually
decrease by almost 10 percent. Beginning in the academic
year 2010-11, rates for graduate students with terminal gradu
ate registration (TGR) status will decrease by 8.8 percent, to
$2,517 per quarter from $2,760.
Vice Provost for Graduate Education Patricia Gumport
said her office expects that the decrease will benefit approxi
mately 1,300 graduate students across a number of schools
and programs.Those withTGR status are students late in their
graduate education who have completed all of their course
work and degree requirements.
Chris Golde, associate vice provost for Graduate Educa
tion, noted the change "affects almost exclusively the Ph.D.
students, though a few M. A. students may be the beneficiaries
of this."
Gumport said she was pleased to announce the move.
"I know of no other peer institution that has a tuition de
crease, let alone one that's this substantial," Gumport said.
"And it's at a critical phase of their doctoral study, so it's help
ing the students, but it's also relieving some pressure on the
departments and the faculty who cover their tuition in these
later stages of their Ph.D. programs."
The TGR tuition rate had remained constant for the past
three years and was set to remain at that level for a fourth. Im
petus for the decrease came with the announcement of an in
crease in the minimum salary for research assistants and
teaching assistants, which are provided by faculty and depart
ments.
"We're especially concerned about students that are at the
minimum, just so they can make ends
meet," Gumport said. "So we in
creased the minimum [research assis
tant and teaching assistant] salary by
five percent, knowing that that was
going to put more pressure on the
other parts of the University that pay
them."
The new TGR rate will also be
pegged to the tuition level for gradu
ate students enrolled for one to three
units. The rate will rise in line with
that rate in future academic years,
which Gumport said will provide a

measure of predictability.
"By tagging it to the actual one-to
three-unit standard tuition, people
around the University can do their
budget projections much more pre
dictably," Gumport said.
Graduate Student Council Co-
Chair Nanna Notthoff, a Ph.D. stu
dent in psychology, called the move a
"significant improvement."
"I think it will have an impact,"
Notthoff said. "I think it will remain
to be seen how meaningful it is."
Graduate students can request
TGR status when they have success
fully "completed all required courses
and degree requirements other than
the University oral exam and disser
tation, completed 135 units and sub
mitted a Doctoral Dissertation Read

ing Committee form," according to
the University's graduate tuition cat
egories.
Provost John Etchemendy an
nounced the decrease at Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
