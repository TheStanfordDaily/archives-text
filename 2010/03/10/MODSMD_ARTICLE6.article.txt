## Terminal grad fees fall slightly 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Tuition for some graduate students will go in an unexpect
ed direction starting this fall: down.
While tuition for undergraduates rose again this year, rates
for a segment of the graduate school population will actually
decrease by almost 10 percent. Beginning in the academic
year 2010-11, rates for graduate students with terminal gradu

$2,517 per quarter from $2,760.
Vice Provost for Graduate Education Patricia Gumport
said her office expects that the decrease will benefit approxi

and programs.Those withTGR status are students late in their
graduate education who have completed all of their course
work and degree requirements.
Chris Golde, associate vice provost for Graduate Educa
tion, noted the change "affects almost exclusively the Ph.D.
students, though a few M. A. students may be the beneficiaries
of this."
Gumport said she was pleased to announce the move.
"I know of no other peer institution that has a tuition de
crease, let alone one that's this substantial," Gumport said.
"And it's at a critical phase of their doctoral study, so it's help
ing the students, but it's also relieving some pressure on the
departments and the faculty who cover their tuition in these
later stages of their Ph.D. programs."
The TGR tuition rate had remained constant for the past
three years and was set to remain at that level for a fourth. Im
petus for the decrease came with the announcement of an in
crease in the minimum salary for research assistants and
teaching assistants, which are provided by faculty and depart
ments.
"We're especially concerned about students that are at the
