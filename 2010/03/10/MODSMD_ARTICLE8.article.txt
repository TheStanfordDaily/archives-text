## For professors, report cards, too Where do students' course evaluations go? Toward setting salaries, admins say 
### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
For students, the end of winter quarter means not only
final exams and spring break plans, but also course evalu
ations, those thrice-yearly surveys in which students rate
their classes in exchange for an earlier glimpse at their
grades.
For professors and teaching assistants, those course
evaluations also mean end-quarter grades not a part of
their GPA, but important for a shot at a raise, a promotion
or tenure.
Professors who are being evaluated for promotion or
tenure must submit all course evaluations since their last
promotion, according to Patricia Jones, the vice provost for
faculty development and a biology professor. The results
of those evaluations play a role in decisions about whether
or not to promote a professor, as well as whether or not to
hire a teaching assistant (TA) as a full faculty member.
"Additionally, course evaluations are used on a regular
basis for setting salaries," Jones said.
Every professor must submit an annual report in
cluding course evaluation results to their department
chair, who makes salary recommendations to the dean of
the school each year, she added. The results of course eval
uations help administrators keep professors accountable
for their performance in the classroom, even after receiv
ing tenure.
Some 80 to 85 percent of students evaluate their cours-
es during fall, winter and spring quar
ters, according to Rosa Chappell, an
assistant University registrar. For sum
mer courses, the rate drops to 65 or 70
percent. Some departments boast
higher numbers: for instance, more
than 90 percent of political science stu
dents return evaluations, said depart
ment chair James Fearon.
Of course, although course evalua
tions are part of the promotion and
salary-setting processes, Jones said the
University values course evaluations as
a measurement of teaching quality, too.
"Teaching is an important part of
faculty work," Jones said. "It is expect
ed that our faculty are good teachers."
That is especially the case with
many TAs, who, in many departments,
get critical feedback from course eval
uations. In the economics department,
TA evaluations also help determine
who among them receives quarterly
awards. Evaluations may also affect a
TA's future postings.
"Some of my TAs ask if I'll write a
recommendation letter for them, so I'll
go back and look at their evaluations,"
Jones said.
Course evaluations include both a
numerical ranking portion and a short
answer portion, in which students are
asked to write their own comments
about the class.
According to Carol Boggs, a biolo
gy professor and the director of the
Program in Human Biology, depart
ment heads and administrators can
only see the numerical rankings, while
the individual professors and TAs may
see the short answers which Jones
said lend useful insight.
"Not every student takes the time
to answer questions by writing," Jones
said. "But there are always suggestions

in there that I really appreciate having.
I would guess most faculty really ap
preciate those sorts of comments from
students."
Jones, who teaches upper-division
biology courses, said she looks back at
course evaluations from past years
when preparing for courses she has
taught before.
But the course evaluation system is
not without weaknesses, professors
said. If they wish to evaluate their
courses and sections in the middle of
the quarter, they must create and dis
tribute their own evaluation forms, as
the University-wide system only solic
its evaluations at the end of the quar
ter.
"I wish the system could be im
proved to allow for more information
in the middle of the quarter," said Han
Hong, an economics professor and the
director of undergraduate studies for
the department. "There's nothing offi
cially in place for that."
Others feel that course evaluations
focus largely on presentation, rather
than on the quality of course content.

"My larger criticism of course eval
uations is that they tend to result in re
sponses to presentation of material,
rather than what's actually learned,"
Boggs said in an e-mail to The Daily.
Hong agreed that there is some
room for improvement in the process.
"The current feedback is on a
micro level, so there is less discussion
between the student body and the fac
ulty body about where the students
think a program should be going,"
Hong said. "If there were a systematic
effort for this from the University
level, that would be more successful."
Although many students evaluate
their courses thoughtfully, Boggs
noted that there are always those who
don't take evaluations seriously.
"I also know faculty (not me!) who
have gotten marriage proposals via
course evaluations," Boggs said. "That
does not bode well for the seriousness
and professionalism with which those
students approached the evaluation!"
