## ASSU ballot almost set Six pairs to run for executive; frosh flood Senate field; few incumbents 
### MARISA LANDICHO ELIZABETH TITUS 
After a flurry of signature validations over the
weekend, the Elections Commission released the of
ficial list of ASSU candidates, slates and special fees
groups Tuesday afternoon. Looking toward Election
Day on April 8, the contenders now have roughly
two weeks to prepare their strategies before cam
paign season begins in earnest.

This year, students will have their choice between
up to six slates for ASSU executive and 39 candi
dates for Undergraduate Senate. Fifteen student
groups seeking special fees also made the ballot.
To earn a spot on the ballot, special fees groups
seeking new or increased funding requests, as well as
students running for executive, class president or
Senate, had to gather a specified number of signa
tures from other students. Students running for
Graduate Student Council (GSC) positions are not
required to petition, though some used
the Elections Commission option to
declare their candidacy last week.
The petition phase closed Friday at
4 p.m., prompting last-ditch paper pe
tition drives and mass e-mail bom
bardments at the end of last week.
Tasked with monitoring the elec
tion process, the Elections Commis
sion an independent and appoint
ed body of the ASSU spent the
weekend verifying petitions.
To validate each petition, Commis
sion members contacted 15 randomly
selected signers and questioned how
their signature was obtained. Peti
tions were declared valid once eight
or more people confirmed their signa
tures.
At press time, one petition was
pending authorization, according to
Elections Commissioner Quinn Slack
'll.
Executive
Five of six executive slates were
given the go-ahead for the April elec
tion: Angelina Cardona'll and Kelsei
Wharton 'l2 with 339 signatures,
chemical engineering doctoral stu
dents Ryan Peacock and Jonathan
Bakke with 224, juniors Austin Guz
man and Patrick Mahoney with 219,
junior Katherine Heflin and senior
Daniel Leifer with 214 and juniors
Thorn Scher and Stephanie Werner
with 208.
Executive slates needed 200 signa
tures to make the ballot.
Billy Kemper 'll and Josh Meisel
'l2 of the slate Two Dope Boys in a
Caddylack made the ballot with 207
signatures, but await validation as the
commission determines whether or
not they have enough graduate signa
tures to receive public campaign fi
nancing, which they are requesting.
Last year, three executive slates
were on the ballot, compared to the
potential six slates this year.
Notably, three of the slates on the
ballots have female representation;
the last female executives were Eliza
beth Heng 'O7 and Lauren Graham

After a flurry of signature validations over the
weekend, the Elections Commission released the of
ficial list of ASSU candidates, slates and special fees
groups Tuesday afternoon. Looking toward Election
Day on April 8, the contenders now have roughly
two weeks to prepare their strategies before cam
paign season begins in earnest.

This year, students will have their choice between
up to six slates for ASSU executive and 39 candi
dates for Undergraduate Senate. Fifteen student
groups seeking special fees also made the ballot.
To earn a spot on the ballot, special fees groups
seeking new or increased funding requests, as well as
students running for executive, class president or
Senate, had to gather a specified number of signa
tures from other students. Students running for
Graduate Student Council (GSC) positions are not
required to petition, though some used
the Elections Commission option to
declare their candidacy last week.
The petition phase closed Friday at
4 p.m., prompting last-ditch paper pe
tition drives and mass e-mail bom
bardments at the end of last week.
Tasked with monitoring the elec
tion process, the Elections Commis
sion an independent and appoint
ed body of the ASSU spent the
weekend verifying petitions.
To validate each petition, Commis
sion members contacted 15 randomly
selected signers and questioned how
their signature was obtained. Peti
tions were declared valid once eight
or more people confirmed their signa
tures.
At press time, one petition was
pending authorization, according to
Elections Commissioner Quinn Slack
'll.
Executive
Five of six executive slates were
given the go-ahead for the April elec
tion: Angelina Cardona'll and Kelsei
Wharton 'l2 with 339 signatures,
chemical engineering doctoral stu
dents Ryan Peacock and Jonathan
Bakke with 224, juniors Austin Guz
man and Patrick Mahoney with 219,
junior Katherine Heflin and senior
Daniel Leifer with 214 and juniors
Thorn Scher and Stephanie Werner
with 208.
Executive slates needed 200 signa
tures to make the ballot.
Billy Kemper 'll and Josh Meisel
'l2 of the slate Two Dope Boys in a
Caddylack made the ballot with 207
signatures, but await validation as the
commission determines whether or
not they have enough graduate signa
tures to receive public campaign fi
nancing, which they are requesting.
Last year, three executive slates
were on the ballot, compared to the
potential six slates this year.
Notably, three of the slates on the
ballots have female representation;
the last female executives were Eliza
beth Heng 'O7 and Lauren Graham
'O7 three years ago.
Peacock and Bakke are also the
first doctoral students to run for
ASSU executive since 1999, the earli
est year the Elections Commission
has election returns posted on their
Web site.
Class Presidents
In the class president elections,
only the Class of 2013 will have an ac

class president were validated: Sophs 4
More with 254 signatures, iThirteen

Thirteen! with 163. Slates needed at
least 100 signatures to get on the ballot.
iThirteen consists of freshmen
Camilla Boyer, Nelson Estrada, Adam
Klein and Greg Naifeh.
Joel Aguero, Imani Franklin, Elise
Geithner and Thomas Hendee, all
