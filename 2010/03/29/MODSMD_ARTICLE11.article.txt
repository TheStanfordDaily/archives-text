## "Likely letters" sent to some applicants Less than one percent of applicants receive a hint of acceptance 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
While some applicants to Stanford got word Satur
day of their admission to the Farm, others had already
received a subtle nod via a "likely letter" a practice
common to several of America's elite colleges. Of
Stanford's approximate 32,000 applicants this year,
less than one percent of the pool received such a let
ter, according to Director of Admission Shawn Ab
bott.
What purpose do likely letters serve? Abbott said
they are to notify students "who have truly exception
al academic, artistic or athletic talent" of the likeli
hood of their admission.
"We send likely letters to recruit the most excep
tional candidates from around the world," Abbott
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "Notifying candidates
that they are likely for admission enables us to identi
fy and alert Stanford faculty, coaches, artists and advi
sors who will then reach out to these internationally
accomplished students and encourage them to con
sider Stanford among their many college options."
However, the letters only hint at acceptance; Ab
bott said they do not contain formal admission deci-
sions, which were released Saturday for
regular-decision applicants.
Citing concerns of "fueling anxi
ety," the Office of Admission declined
to comment on what a likely letter
contains, but students who have re
ceived likely letters said the letters
hinted they had gotten in without ex
plicitly saying so.
"It hinted at it enough so that I got a
sense that I had gotten in," said Chris
Brunson 'l2. "I didn't celebrate too
much, though, because it wasn't an offi
cial letter. And when I got the official
letter, I wasn't as surprised as other
people were."
As a National Merit Scholar and
National Achievement Scholar from
South Carolina, Brunson received sev
eral offers of admission from top col
leges. Among his accomplishments
were a 4.9 weighted GPA, a "pretty
high" SAT score, research on multiple
sclerosis and "a buttload of tutoring."
When Brunson applied for colleges,
he threw Stanford onto his list only be
cause of parental pressure.
"I was just like, it's Stanford, life is
cool," Brunson said. "But when I got
[the likely letter], I then really majorly
considered Stanford."
"It was like, hey, maybe colleges do
want me," he added. "I didn't know
how good of a reputation Stanford had
until I received the letter and [learned]
more about it."
Brunson also received likely letters
from Brown and Washington Universi
ty in St. Louis. However, he said Stan
ford's was "more promising" than the
others.
"It's like, you still need to maintain
your grades and stuff," he said. "But
Stanford's actually made me feel like I
had actually gotten in. The other ones
seem like they were still on the fence
but leaning toward one side and Stan
ford's seemed like it was aheady over
the fence."
Before making his final decision
prior to May 1, he narrowed his choices
down to two Stanford and Colum
bia. His ultimate decision was Stanford.
"Columbia didn't send me a likely
letter," he said. "So I started consider
ing Stanford more than Columbia."
Though the Office of Admission did
not release information about which
applicants receive likely letters, Brun

son believes that geographical diversity
contributed to his acceptance.
"The fact that Stanford doesn't usu
ally choose people from my state prob
ably helped," he said. "Stanford wants
to show that it's got people from every
where."
Smitha Ramakrishna also received
a likely letter from Stanford. According
to Ramakrishna, the likely letter made
her "consider Stanford much more se
riously" before ultimately deciding on
Harvard.
"It definitely made me consider
Stanford more since they gave me such
a personal invitation to join the school,"
she said.
Ramakrishna also received likely
letters from Duke University and Uni
versity of North Carolina-Chapel Hill,
along with regular admission offers
from Harvard and Yale.
"All of these likely letters were very
similar," she said. "But Stanford's did
seem more personal due to the hand
written note they attached."
"It's very personal," she added. "For
me, it quoted my application."
A native of Chandler, Ariz., she be
lieves she received likely letters be
cause of some of her accomplishments.
As a founder of a nonprofit organiza
tion and activist for clean water access
in India, she was named a 2009 Coca-
Cola Scholar, an AXA Achievement
Scholar and Intel Science Talent Search
Finalist.
Likely letters only form one part of
the appeal to admits, however, and
other aspects can make the difference.
Ramakrishna finally decided on Har
vard because of her Admit Weekend
experiences.
"I think the visiting weekends and
people I met there really made the dif
ference in the end," she said.
