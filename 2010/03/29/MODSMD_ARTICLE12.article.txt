## THE 						GAO REPORT Gratitude for Stanford 
### Shelley Gao 
Last Friday, Mar. 26 at 3 p.m.,7.2 percent
of 32,022 students â€”or 2,300 appli
cants were offered admission to
Stanford for the Class of 2014. This number
included 753 who were admitted in Decem
ber under the Restrictive Early Action Pro
gram.
I usually like to complain, wait "con
structively criticize." As an ASSU Under
graduate Senator, "reform" is my favorite
word. Whether it is revamping IHUM, loos
ening party-planning restrictions or promot
ing free speech, there are always things to be
improved. The existence of student govern
ment at Stanford depends on these inade
quacies.
As a columnist for The Daily, I like to cri
tique everything from the lack of public serv
ice commitment among my peers to the ab
sence of female leaders in campus politics to
the sham of student input in University poli
cy-making. As equal stakeholders in this in
stitution, it is our job to improve the Farm.
Loving Stanford means leaving this place
better than we found it, identifying weak
nesses in the status quo and offering pre
scriptions.
Reading about the 7.2 percent admission
rate and the newly released result of Prince
ton Review's "College Hopes & Worries Sur
vey" that if cost was not an issue and ac
ceptance was given, Stanford is the "dream
college" for 9,132 college applicants and
3,042 parents forces us to pause.
It is so easy to lose sight of how fortunate
we are to be here. During the second week of
my freshman year, I met with the admission
officer responsible for my file to thank her
for changing my life. But, as we get older and
become distracted by our hectic schedules,
we tend to forget about the difficulty once as
sociated with applying to college and the
sheer luck of getting to the Farm.
So today's column is about celebrating the
splendor that is Stanford. The paradise de
picted in the 84-page, "The Wind of Freedom
Blows" view book on the admissions website
actually exists. The place portrayed in the
glossy view book is, in fact, real. It has be
come a cliche to argue that we do not actual
ly take classes under the glorious sunshine
and play Frisbee on the Oval all day. But, we
are truly the beneficiaries of exactly what the
view book depicts.
Whether it is the top-ranking humanities
and sciences departments, the strength of in
terdisciplinary programs, the funding avail
able for undergraduate research, the re
sources ranging from the Clark Center to
Green Library or the utterly amazing vibran
cy of student life, Stanford is pretty spectacu
lar. It is also one of the beautiful college cam
puses in the world, described in a Forbes arti
cle this month as an exquisite merge of mod
ern technological advancement with timeless
Californian Mission Revival architecture.
However, it is the people that define Stan
ford. There is a reason that the UAL people
harp on about "cultivating faculty relations."
Stanford offers many opportunities to devel
op personal connections with faculty outside
classroom settings through opportunities
like Sophomore College, advising and re-

search. It is only at Stanford where I can call
a professor at home who has been here for 40
years, who would be perfectly justified to ig
nore a lowly junior like me, to chat about
anything from my thesis to which country I
should live in. We should all be grateful for
the faculty who share their time and their
wisdom and are sources of stability in our
lives.
Mentorship at Stanford also manifests in
the form of student to student. As a benefici
ary of upperclassmen intellectual mentor
ship, I am an enthusiastic proponent of cross
class year friendships. I used to think that two
years do not really make a difference. They
do. The experiences and lessons gained from
two years on the Farm are equivalent to 10
years in the real world. As upperclassmen, we
are privileged to serve as residential assis
tants, major advisors and student group lead
ers. How we approach these roles is very
much shaped by our past mentors.
Irrespective of personal background or
academic expertise, there is a common lan
guage of engagement, curiosity and passion
among the students. For most of us not in
tending to remain in academia, this is proba
bly the only time in our lives that we will be
surrounded by such a fascinating collection
of individuals. While there are the exception
al Olympians, published authors, NGO
founders and mathematicians, everyone here
cares about the world. They are passionate
about going beyond a fulfilling private life to
contribute to the public sphere.
The best thing about a Stanford educa
tion? It is the belief that anything is possible.
