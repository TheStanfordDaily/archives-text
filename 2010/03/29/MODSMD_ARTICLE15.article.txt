# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## "Mutually Reinforcing Hypocrisy" 
### Emily Hulme 
Two "interesting" things happened to me
over break.
First of all, a duck yet unnamed now
has appeared in my pool at home, much to the
chagrin of the family dog. Second, I discov
ered Jennifer Love Hewitt's new dating "ad
vice" book. She has declared herself a "lovea
holic" (it's like a chocaholic but for amor!)
And you'll have to look into it yourself to see
why I scare quote "advice" in describing it.
Jennifer Love Hewitt, you see, is a duck, al
beit not the same duck as the one living in my
pool. In fact, she's even a Stanford Duck be
cause, although she doesn't look like a duck
or quack like a duck, she's suffering from the
syndrome of the Stanford Duck. Why does
the Stanford Duck paddle? He paddles to get
good grades, and he paddles to get the best in
ternships and he paddles for about a thou
sand other reasons, give or take. But ultimate
ly he's paddling for happiness.
Shelley points out this week just how
many opportunities we have and she's ab
solutely right. I'd like to point out, in turn,
how the fertile fields of opportunity can
breed not just success but also anguish.
There's a reason the Stanford Duck Syn
drome isn't a disease you hope to catch. In
fact, I think the precise dirty underside is the
fear that we are all involved in a sort of "mu
tually reinforcing hypocrisy" (I borrow the
phrase from Zizek) wherein no one is really
happy. And that, in a sense, is the perfect
nightmare scenario: an ongoing Sisyphean
chore that, rather than commanded down and
forced upon us by God on high, is an entirely
human creation.
But it's not just about ducks; it's about
Stanford too. There are, by my lights, at least

two parts of Stanford that lead to a certain
proclivity towards developing the Syndrome.
The first, I've already suggested, is that Stan
ford presents any given student with a num
ber of unique opportunities. The second, I
think, is related to our location.

In a fervent effort to promote country
music lyrics as a legitimate source, I'll intro
duce how the West figures in the imagination
of "The Truth," a current hit by Jason Aldean.
He defines the West Coast, using the unortho
dox grammar country artists are wont to use,
as "where it don't ever rain." I think it would
be a mistake to think his aversion to standard
conjugations prevents him from making a
shrewd insight, or at least giving us a com
pelling image. Of course, it's not exactly true
that it never rains here; in fact, I used my rain
boots at least twice last term. But the Syn
drome turns the meteorological half truth
into a full-fledged moral injunction; that is, no
longer is it enough that "it don't ever rain,"
but moreover we should not ever let it rain in
our own lives. Or, more curtly: sad is bad. We
should prohibit it. This is, of course, absurd.
Mr. Aldean, as you might have guessed,
contrasts this with "the truth" (Belated Spoil
er Alert). Heidi Montag-types deny reality re
lentlessly, and rather than becoming "really"
happy, they become happily fake, trapped in
an illusion. After her latest spat of plastic sur
geries, she appeared on Jay Leno's show, and
perhaps the most remarkable part was that
she was not the butt of his j okes, but the object
of his most profound pity. The illusion would
not give, even when he drew it to the brink of
absurdity: he asked if she'd continue with her
self-improvement efforts, and she replied that
she would be "Robo-Heidi" by the time she
was fifty. I think I'd prefer the all-too-obvious
alternative: to redefine happiness as what is
real.

Emily is currently accepting suggestions for
duck names. Please send your best to

We are all involved in
a sort of "mutually
reinforcing
hypocrisy"!...]
wherein no one is
really happy.
