## Stanford appeals charter school ranking 
### CRISTIANA GIANNINI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford New Schools-run East Palo
Alto Academy (EPAA) recently appeared on
the state's list of "worst-performing schools,"
much to the disapproval of Stanford's School
of Education.
According to Deborah Stipek, dean of the
School of Education, and Gail Greely, the chief
operating officer of Stanford New Schools,
EPAA should not have appeared on the list
and is in the process of filing an appeal with the
California Department of Education. They
point to the measurable improvement gains
seen at the EPAA high school in the last five
years, which they say are well above the level
that should have exempted it.
Stanford New Schools, a 501(c)(3) non
profit organization, was started by the School
of Education in 2005 to operate charter
schools in East Palo Alto. The organization
first adopted the high school from Aspire, an
other California charter school management
organization. Stanford New Schools has also

pushed toward an integrated K-12 education
with the recent creation of the EPAA elemen
tary school, serving younger grades at a differ
ent location.
The state forwards the list of low-perform
ing schools to the U.S. Department of Educa
tion as schools undergo additional review, the
Palo Alto Weekly reported.
The EPAA high school currently has a
graduation rate of 86 percent, six points above
the state average, according to education pro
fessor Linda Darling-Hammond. About 96
percent of EPAA graduates were admitted to
college last year, she said, and 53 percent were
admitted to four-year colleges more than
double the rate for African American and
Latino students in California. In addition, over
the last five years, the school has recorded a 76-
point gain in Academic Performance Index
(API) scores the metric that the California
Department of Education uses to evaluate
schools. A gain of 50 points should have meant
exemption from the "worst-performing" list,
according to the administrators.
Why, then, is EPAA listed?

Part of the issue has to do with the creation
and development of the elementary school,
those involved said: its lagging first-year scores
collided with the high school's five-year statis
tics. When the elementary grades began to be
added, the official school code was changed
and the Department of Education did not con
sider data from the full five-year period in
evaluating EPAA for the final listing.
Standardized testing at the elementary
school has also been a challenge in the state
evaluation system.
"What have been hurting us are the stan
dardized test scores at the elementary school,"
Greely said.
Elementary school tests are administered
to only a few grades per year. The start-up
phase of the school also contributes to the un
certainty.
"When you're going through startup, [score
level] is going to fluctuate," Greely said.
"That's not unexpected."
Working with the new students at the elemen-
tary level has been a challenge for
the organization, Stipek admitted.
"We haven't had the experience
of serving kids at younger ages,"

Stipek said. "We're putting into
practice the lessons that we're
learning ... when the sixth graders
came in the door they were much
further behind than we had antici
pated. We had to basically start over
again with the math curriculum."
Facilities issues also play a part.
Last summer, EPAA elementary
school was relocated to a site in

Menlo Park by the decision of the
Ravenswood School District.
"Our student progress has not
met expectations. We're not doing
as good a process as we want to,"
Greely said. She said the organiza
tion is taking a hard look at its data
and applying methods they hope
will produce results. New principals
were also recently hired.

Stanford faculty, community
members and parents sit on the
board of Stanford New Schools.
The charter for both the high
school and elementary school is up
for its five-year renewal this year.
Before a presentation given before
the board last Friday, Stipek re
ported that she feels "guardedly
optimistic" about their chances for

renewal.
"Ravenswood's board certainly
understands our objections to the
lowest-achieving designation,"
Greely said.
The organization is awaiting the
district's final decision.
