## Summers shares crisis lessons 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Lawrence Summers, the director
of the White House National Eco
nomic Council, delivered the keynote
at the Stanford Institute for Econom
ic Policy Research's annual summit
Friday.
Summers discussed lessons from
the financial crisis as well as potential
regulatory changes and long-term
economic policies that could
strengthen the U.S. financial system in
the future.
Despite a significant rebound in
the financial markets since lows in
early 2009, Summers took a caution
ary stand on the state of the U.S. econ

omy, citing high unemployment fig
ures and other indicators of economic
weakness.
"We have a long way to go," Sum
mers said. "The amount that our
economy is producing is more than a
trillion dollars short of potential."
In January, with a 9.7 percent un
employment rate, about 14.8 million
Americans were unemployed, ac
cording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics. In California, the unem
ployment rate was 12.5 percent.
However, Summers pointedly re
jected the idea that the financial crisis
called into question the basic premis
es of "American capitalism," or the
view that financial crises were an in
herent part of economic life.

"The extent and virulence of the
liquidity panic was not something that
I foresaw then, and until the very mo
ment it arrived it was not something
that was generally foreseen," Sum
mers said.
In this context. Summers defended
the unprecedented action the federal
government took to stabilize the fi
nancial system.
"There are moments when strong
public action is necessary to preserve
economic stability," Summers said.
"For all its tremendous virtues, we
cannot rely on the markets to always
be a self-sustaining system."
According to Summers, the crisis
also showed that the financial system
in place now was one that "courted

excessive risk" rather than containing
risk. The system "has proved to be a
source of risk that has threatened and
wrenched [away] the jobs and liveli
hoods of hundreds of thousands, if not
millions, of people," he said.
Summers proceeded to outline six
areas of regulatory reform that he
deemed essential to future financial
stability: comprehensive regulation of
all systematically important institu
tions; the creation of a resolution au
thority that could systematically man
age bank failures; regulatory regimes
that provide upward pressure on cap
ital and liquidity requirements for fi
nancial institutions; compensation for
