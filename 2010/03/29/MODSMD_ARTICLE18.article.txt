## ELITE EIGHT Red-hot Cardinal prepares for No. 3 seed Xavier 
### TOM TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
While most students were enjoying post
exam relaxation over Spring Break, the
women's basketball team has been busy.
On Saturday, No. 1 seed Stanford (34-1,18-
0 Pac-10) erased an early deficit to crush No.
5 seed Georgia (25-9, 9-7 SEC) 73-36 in the
Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament,
keeping its season alive and setting up a re
gional final clash with No. 3 seed Xavier (30-
3, 14-0 Atlantic-10) at the ARCO Arena in
Sacramento at 6 p.m. Monday night.
Since classes finished, the team has
brought the Pac-10 Tournament trophy back
to the Farm and has breezed through the first
two rounds of the NCAAs.
Stanford's Elite Eight status and confer
ence championship have emerged from a sea
son of both dominating wins and lingering in
juries.
The Card only lost one game throughout
the regular season, against undefeated
UConn, but struggled to find a rhythm in the
first half of the Pac-10 Conference season. In
juries to guards took their toll, and after an
off-season knee surgery. All-American senior
center Jayne Appel had not yet returned to
top form.
The secrets to the current strength of the
team, however, lay in those difficult weeks.
Pac-10 Co-Defender of the Year and red
shirt senior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude stepped
up to deliver the strongest season of her colle
giate career, while sophomore forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike terrorized defenders
in a breakout year that brought her both the
Pac-10 Player of the Year and the Pac-10
Tournament's Most Outstanding Player
awards.
By the midpoint of the conference season,
the team had left its serious problems behind.
Appel came alive, putting in a streak of dou
ble-double performances and lending a
tougher edge to the Card, though she has had
reduced playing time in the last few contests
due to a sprained ankle.
"It's a lot about Jayne [Appel]," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer after Satur
day's game against Georgia. "Jayne to me is
the hub of that wheel. She can pass and she
makes everyone look so good."
In the first two rounds of the NCAAs, any
doubts that may have persisted about the
Cardinal's guard play were blown away. Ju
nior guard Jeanette Pohlen shone brightly in
the first game against UC-Riverside, attack
ing the basket to hit four three-pointers and
score 16 points, and a fired-up Gold-Onwude
followed this with a career-defining last game
at Maples, hitting 6-6 on three-pointers in the
first half to leave lowa stunned.
In the third round, it was junior forward
Kayla Pedersen's turn to shine. Pedersen may
not have grabbed quite as many headlines as
some of her fellow starters this year, but she
showed her determination and fighting spirit
as she dived onto the floor to trap a loose ball
between her legs to stifle a Bulldog attack in

the second period.
"Our whole team is still hungry," Pedersen
said. "We're not satisfied."
While not one Georgia player scored dou
ble digits, all of the big three Cardinal for
wards and Pohlen did. Pedersen and Ogwu
mike each picked up yet another double-dou
ble this season (13 points and 15 rebounds,
and 11 points and 11 rebounds, respectively)
and the forwards dominated to score 42

points in the paint.
"They're really good scorers," said Geor
gia head coach Andy Landers, "but the thing
that separates their bigs while Stanford
may be bigger than everyone else and they
shoot it well they pass it, I think, better
than anyone else's bigs. This is an excellent
passing basketball team."
Incisive passing has been key to the Cardi
nal's success this season, breaking through de-

fenses, and leading to 19 team assists on Sat
urday.
"Our guards did well getting us the ball
and dishing down low," Appel said. "They
gave us point-blank shots and it was our job to
put them in."
It is a tactic that works and something that
Stanford will hope to continue to do in the
short time left in the season.
"Ultimately, we are going to go into our
posts," Pohlen said. "They brought us here
and they are going to take us very far."
This confidence in each other seems to
have been well placed. With almost five min
utes gone in the first half on Saturday, the Car
dinal was four points behind the Lady Bull
dogs, but from there on in it was all Stanford.
Georgia scored just seven more points in the
first period to the Card's 33.
The second half was more of the same, and
the 36 points that the Lady Dogs managed to
score against Stanford was the lowest total
that any team has ever scored against the Car
dinal in the NCAAs.
Next up are the two towering forwards of
Xavier: redshirt junior Amber Harris, stand
ing at 6-foot-5, and junior Ta'Shia Phillips at 6-
foot-6 a full two inches taller than either
Appel or Pedersen. Together they lead the
Musketeers in both points and rebounds, and
hit double-doubles in Xavier's defeat of Gon
zaga (14 points and 10 boards, and 22 points
and 14 boards, respectively).
"I think it will be really tough on Monday
night, but who knows?" VanDerveer said.
"Georgia coming into it, they beat Tennessee,
they're 16-0, they've played against really top
teams and it was our night [Saturday]."
So far Stanford has managed to secure
comfortable victories and keep its 24-game
winning streak going. But this is the NCAA
Division I Women's Basketball Champi
onship and with each step toward the final
game, the opposition will get tougher.
"It does get harder as you go," Ogwumike
said, "but if we continue to prepare the way
we like to prepare and be ready for the game,
I think we'll be just fine. We'll take it one game
at a time as we always do the whole year."

While most students were enjoying post
exam relaxation over Spring Break, the
women's basketball team has been busy.
On Saturday, No. 1 seed Stanford (34-1,18-
0 Pac-10) erased an early deficit to crush No.
5 seed Georgia (25-9, 9-7 SEC) 73-36 in the
Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament,
keeping its season alive and setting up a re
gional final clash with No. 3 seed Xavier (30-
3, 14-0 Atlantic-10) at the ARCO Arena in
Sacramento at 6 p.m. Monday night.
Since classes finished, the team has
brought the Pac-10 Tournament trophy back
to the Farm and has breezed through the first
two rounds of the NCAAs.
Stanford's Elite Eight status and confer
ence championship have emerged from a sea
son of both dominating wins and lingering in
juries.
The Card only lost one game throughout
the regular season, against undefeated
UConn, but struggled to find a rhythm in the
first half of the Pac-10 Conference season. In
juries to guards took their toll, and after an
off-season knee surgery. All-American senior
center Jayne Appel had not yet returned to
top form.
The secrets to the current strength of the
team, however, lay in those difficult weeks.
Pac-10 Co-Defender of the Year and red
shirt senior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude stepped
up to deliver the strongest season of her colle
giate career, while sophomore forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike terrorized defenders
in a breakout year that brought her both the
Pac-10 Player of the Year and the Pac-10
Tournament's Most Outstanding Player
awards.
By the midpoint of the conference season,
the team had left its serious problems behind.
Appel came alive, putting in a streak of dou
ble-double performances and lending a
tougher edge to the Card, though she has had
reduced playing time in the last few contests
due to a sprained ankle.
"It's a lot about Jayne [Appel]," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer after Satur
day's game against Georgia. "Jayne to me is
the hub of that wheel. She can pass and she
makes everyone look so good."
In the first two rounds of the NCAAs, any
doubts that may have persisted about the
Cardinal's guard play were blown away. Ju
nior guard Jeanette Pohlen shone brightly in
the first game against UC-Riverside, attack
ing the basket to hit four three-pointers and
score 16 points, and a fired-up Gold-Onwude
followed this with a career-defining last game
at Maples, hitting 6-6 on three-pointers in the
first half to leave lowa stunned.
In the third round, it was junior forward
Kayla Pedersen's turn to shine. Pedersen may
not have grabbed quite as many headlines as
some of her fellow starters this year, but she
showed her determination and fighting spirit
as she dived onto the floor to trap a loose ball
between her legs to stifle a Bulldog attack in

the second period.
"Our whole team is still hungry," Pedersen
said. "We're not satisfied."
While not one Georgia player scored dou
ble digits, all of the big three Cardinal for
wards and Pohlen did. Pedersen and Ogwu
mike each picked up yet another double-dou
ble this season (13 points and 15 rebounds,
and 11 points and 11 rebounds, respectively)
and the forwards dominated to score 42

points in the paint.
"They're really good scorers," said Geor
gia head coach Andy Landers, "but the thing
that separates their bigs while Stanford
may be bigger than everyone else and they
shoot it well they pass it, I think, better
than anyone else's bigs. This is an excellent
passing basketball team."
Incisive passing has been key to the Cardi
nal's success this season, breaking through de-

fenses, and leading to 19 team assists on Sat
urday.
"Our guards did well getting us the ball
and dishing down low," Appel said. "They
gave us point-blank shots and it was our job to
put them in."
It is a tactic that works and something that
Stanford will hope to continue to do in the
short time left in the season.
"Ultimately, we are going to go into our
posts," Pohlen said. "They brought us here
and they are going to take us very far."
This confidence in each other seems to
have been well placed. With almost five min
utes gone in the first half on Saturday, the Car
dinal was four points behind the Lady Bull
dogs, but from there on in it was all Stanford.
Georgia scored just seven more points in the
first period to the Card's 33.
The second half was more of the same, and
the 36 points that the Lady Dogs managed to
score against Stanford was the lowest total
that any team has ever scored against the Car
dinal in the NCAAs.
Next up are the two towering forwards of
Xavier: redshirt junior Amber Harris, stand
ing at 6-foot-5, and junior Ta'Shia Phillips at 6-
foot-6 a full two inches taller than either
Appel or Pedersen. Together they lead the
Musketeers in both points and rebounds, and
hit double-doubles in Xavier's defeat of Gon
zaga (14 points and 10 boards, and 22 points
and 14 boards, respectively).
"I think it will be really tough on Monday
night, but who knows?" VanDerveer said.
"Georgia coming into it, they beat Tennessee,
they're 16-0, they've played against really top
teams and it was our night [Saturday]."
So far Stanford has managed to secure
comfortable victories and keep its 24-game
winning streak going. But this is the NCAA
Division I Women's Basketball Champi
onship and with each step toward the final
game, the opposition will get tougher.
"It does get harder as you go," Ogwumike
said, "but if we continue to prepare the way
we like to prepare and be ready for the game,
I think we'll be just fine. We'll take it one game
at a time as we always do the whole year."
