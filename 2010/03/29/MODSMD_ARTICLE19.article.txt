# Baseball's musical benches

### Daniel Bohm 
If any of you have ever played
baseball, then you know it's a
funny sport. There are supersti
tions — like don't step on the
white lines and rituals —just
go to a Stanford game and watch the
players on the bench do their "rallies"
to see some of those. Most importantly,
however, baseball is a game of peaks
and valleys.
Sometimes you'll hit the ball as hard
you can, and it will go right at someone,
and you'll be out. Other times you'll
take a mighty swing only to hit the ball
five feet, but just far enough to let you
beat out an infield single.
Having gone to and covered Stan
ford baseball games for a few years
now, I start to wonder to what degree
head coach Mark Marquess or
"Nine" as he prefers to be called
subscribes to the luck factor of base
ball.
Take the games on Friday and Sat
urday against USC. On Friday junior
Ben Clowe went 0-4, despite hitting
three balls about as hard as humanly
possible right at Trojan defenders.
Where was he on Saturday? The bench.
Freshman Tyler Gaffney, on the other
hand, went 3-5 without hitting the ball
past the infield. Where was he Satur
day? Hitting in the three-spot in the
lineup.
I'm not suggesting Gaffney should
have been on the bench Saturday, but
the law of averages and any baseball
statistician would both suggest that
Clowe was destined to get some hits
with the way he was batting.
Unfortunately college coaching sta
tistics aren't kept, but I would wager a
fair chunk of change that Marquess an
nually leads the country in substitu
tions made, and he definitely leads in
pinch hitters used prior to the sixth in
ning.
If a player has one bad at-bat, that
might be it for him for the day. There is
no trying to get a feel for a pitcher, or
making adjustments. Instead, it's put up
or shut up unless you are one of
Nine's boys, a group I will try to identi
fy later on.
Players trying to carve their way
into Stanford's starting lineup are rou
tinely given one chance, and one
chance only, to crack the lineup.
Take opening day of the 2009 sea
son. Both Kellen McColl and J.J. Jelmi
ni were in the starting lineup and didn't
have particularly good games. When
did they start again last season? Never.
That is 54 games on the bench of a team
that drastically underachieved.

Why would Marquess start two
players the first game of the year in
dicating they both had good off-sea
sons but never again, even when the
team was under-performing?
I know this sounds crazy question
ing a coaching legend, two-time nation
al champion and Hall-of-Famer, be
cause he clearly must be doing some
thing right. In fact, he has used the jug
gling act in recent years successfully,
like two years ago when the four-man
platoon in left and right field of Bren
dan Domaracki, Toby Gerhart, Jeff
Whitlow and Joey August helped Stan
ford to the College World Series.
That said, his trigger is incredibly
short. Take junior Kellen Kiilsgaard for
example. Kiilsgaard was arguably
Stanford's best offensive player last
season, earning him First-Team All-Pa
cific-10 Honors. So after a rocky start to
this season, where is Kiilsgaard?
Buried somewhere deep on Stanford's

outfield depth chart.
So when Clowe's 0-4 with three
seeds on Friday was deemed insuffi
cient by Marquess, he didn't turn to Ki
ilsgaard to replace him in left field, he
turned to freshman Justin Ringo, a
player that had one at-bat on Friday, a
pinch-hitting appearance in which he
failed to get a runner home from third
with less than two outs . . . which
earned him a start the following day.
That brings me to the only criterion
that I can come up with that allows
some players much longer leashes than
others youth. It makes sense to play
younger players so they can develop
and they will be part of the program for
a few more years. But playing them
when they aren't ready or when there is
a viable alternative may not be the best
idea.
Freshman center fielder Jake Stew
art is a good example of this. Stewart
clearly has tremendous potential, but
he has struggled with the bat in the
early season. He continues to be trot
ted out there to center, however, while
other struggling older players like Ki
ilsgaard and Clowe have to play musi
cal chairs on the bench.

Center field is obviously a very im
portant position on the field defensive
ly, and Stewart does a great job cover
ing ground, but might Marquess try
Gaffney in center, or junior Dave Giu
liani, both very fast, athletic players, if
Stewart continues to struggle? Doubt
ful. (It should be noted that Stewart did
have three hits on Saturday, raising his
season average to .250).
Senior Adam Gaylord is the con
trary example. Marquess has had Gay
lord for four years and probably under
stands what he can and can't do on a
baseball field, but Gaylord is hitting
.550 this year in 20 at-bats and is still yet
to earn a start. What does the guy have
to do? Make chicken salad out of
chicken... You get the idea.
Maybe this is all part of the plan,
and maybe it will work in the long run,
but I can't imagine how difficult it must
be as a player to try and find a rhythm
in only an at-bat or two, never knowing
when your next start may come.

Daniel Bohm was always benched for
playground kickball and never got
over it. Let him know he's still special
at bohmd@stanford.edu.

Take opening day of the 2009 sea
son. Both Kellen McColl and J.J. Jelmi
ni were in the starting lineup and didn't
have particularly good games. When
did they start again last season? Never.
That is 54 games on the bench of a team
that drastically underachieved.

Why would Marquess start two
players the first game of the year in
dicating they both had good off-sea
sons but never again, even when the
team was under-performing?
I know this sounds crazy question
ing a coaching legend, two-time nation
al champion and Hall-of-Famer, be
cause he clearly must be doing some
thing right. In fact, he has used the jug
gling act in recent years successfully,
like two years ago when the four-man
platoon in left and right field of Bren
dan Domaracki, Toby Gerhart, Jeff
Whitlow and Joey August helped Stan
ford to the College World Series.
That said, his trigger is incredibly
short. Take junior Kellen Kiilsgaard for
example. Kiilsgaard was arguably
Stanford's best offensive player last
season, earning him First-Team All-Pa
cific-10 Honors. So after a rocky start to
this season, where is Kiilsgaard?
Buried somewhere deep on Stanford's

outfield depth chart.
So when Clowe's 0-4 with three
seeds on Friday was deemed insuffi
cient by Marquess, he didn't turn to Ki
ilsgaard to replace him in left field, he
turned to freshman Justin Ringo, a
player that had one at-bat on Friday, a
pinch-hitting appearance in which he
failed to get a runner home from third
with less than two outs . . . which
earned him a start the following day.
That brings me to the only criterion
that I can come up with that allows
some players much longer leashes than
others youth. It makes sense to play
younger players so they can develop
and they will be part of the program for
a few more years. But playing them
when they aren't ready or when there is
a viable alternative may not be the best
idea.
Freshman center fielder Jake Stew
art is a good example of this. Stewart
clearly has tremendous potential, but
he has struggled with the bat in the
early season. He continues to be trot
ted out there to center, however, while
other struggling older players like Ki
ilsgaard and Clowe have to play musi
cal chairs on the bench.

Center field is obviously a very im
portant position on the field defensive
ly, and Stewart does a great job cover
ing ground, but might Marquess try
Gaffney in center, or junior Dave Giu
liani, both very fast, athletic players, if
Stewart continues to struggle? Doubt
ful. (It should be noted that Stewart did
have three hits on Saturday, raising his
season average to .250).
Senior Adam Gaylord is the con
trary example. Marquess has had Gay
lord for four years and probably under
stands what he can and can't do on a
baseball field, but Gaylord is hitting
.550 this year in 20 at-bats and is still yet
to earn a start. What does the guy have
to do? Make chicken salad out of
chicken... You get the idea.
Maybe this is all part of the plan,
and maybe it will work in the long run,
but I can't imagine how difficult it must
be as a player to try and find a rhythm
in only an at-bat or two, never knowing
when your next start may come.

Daniel Bohm was always benched for
playground kickball and never got
over it. Let him know he's still special
at bohmd@stanford.edu.
