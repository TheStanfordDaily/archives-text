# Baseball's musical benches

### Daniel Bohm 
If any of you have ever played
baseball, then you know it's a
funny sport. There are supersti
tions — like don't step on the
white lines and rituals —just
go to a Stanford game and watch the
players on the bench do their "rallies"
to see some of those. Most importantly,
however, baseball is a game of peaks
and valleys.
Sometimes you'll hit the ball as hard
you can, and it will go right at someone,
and you'll be out. Other times you'll
take a mighty swing only to hit the ball
five feet, but just far enough to let you
beat out an infield single.
Having gone to and covered Stan
ford baseball games for a few years
now, I start to wonder to what degree
head coach Mark Marquess or
"Nine" as he prefers to be called
subscribes to the luck factor of base
ball.
Take the games on Friday and Sat
urday against USC. On Friday junior
Ben Clowe went 0-4, despite hitting
three balls about as hard as humanly
possible right at Trojan defenders.
Where was he on Saturday? The bench.
Freshman Tyler Gaffney, on the other
hand, went 3-5 without hitting the ball
past the infield. Where was he Satur
day? Hitting in the three-spot in the
lineup.
I'm not suggesting Gaffney should
have been on the bench Saturday, but
the law of averages and any baseball
statistician would both suggest that
Clowe was destined to get some hits
with the way he was batting.
Unfortunately college coaching sta
tistics aren't kept, but I would wager a
fair chunk of change that Marquess an
nually leads the country in substitu
tions made, and he definitely leads in
pinch hitters used prior to the sixth in
ning.
If a player has one bad at-bat, that
might be it for him for the day. There is
no trying to get a feel for a pitcher, or
making adjustments. Instead, it's put up
or shut up unless you are one of
Nine's boys, a group I will try to identi
fy later on.
Players trying to carve their way
into Stanford's starting lineup are rou
tinely given one chance, and one
chance only, to crack the lineup.
Take opening day of the 2009 sea
son. Both Kellen McColl and J.J. Jelmi
ni were in the starting lineup and didn't
have particularly good games. When
did they start again last season? Never.
That is 54 games on the bench of a team
that drastically underachieved.
