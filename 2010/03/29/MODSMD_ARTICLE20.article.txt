Stanford came into its Mar. 12 game against
Washington with hopes of an improbable run to
the NCAA Tournament still flickering, but they
were extinguished rather quickly in a 79-64 loss
to the Huskies, knocking the Cardinal out of the
Pac-lOTournament semifinals and ending its sea
son.
The Cardinal never led and was simply out
matched against the more talented and athletic
Huskies. Stanford pulled to within seven points
with just a minute remaining in the first half after
a three-pointer by senior walk-on Emmanuel Ig
binosa, but that was the closest the score would
be for the rest of the contest.
Senior wing Landry Fields gave another stal
wart performance in what was likely his final col
legiate game, scoring 20 points and grabbing 14
rebounds. Igbinosa was the only other player to
register double digits in points with 11.
The Huskies constantly harassed Stanford
with their physical and aggressive defense the
Cardinal only shot 31.3 percent from the field.
Sophomore guard Jeremy Green and senior
guard Drew Shiller both had off
nights shooting, going a combined 3-
24 from the floor.
The loss to Washington ended
the Cardinal's season, as it did not
receive a bid to the NIT with a 14-18
record. Stanford expressed disinter
est in playing in either the College
Basketball Invitational or the Col
legelnsider.com Postseason Tourna
ment, so its season is now complete.
