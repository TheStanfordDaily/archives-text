# CARD WITHSTANDS WAVES, TROJANS
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After taking a break for finals, the Stanford
baseball team played seven games over spring
break. From Mar. 19-21, the Cardinal (12-6)
swept a three-game series at home against Pep
perdine (8-14). It then fell to Pacific (14-7) on
Mar. 23, losing by a score of 9-4. Last weekend,
Stanford hosted USC for its first Pac-10 series of
the year and took two out of three games from
the Trojans (12-12).
Stanford's three games against the Waves
were a showcase of offensive firepower. The Car
dinal tallied a total of 30 runs in the series.
In the first game, Stanford took the win in
walk-off fashion for the fourth time this season,
pulling out a 9-8 victory at Sunken Diamond. Ju
nior catcher Zach Jones' hot hitting led the Card,
as he went 4-5 and hit the game-winning single. In
his first game hitting from the leadoff spot, fresh
man outfielder Tyler Gaffney notched two hits.
The Card did receive significant help from
poor fielding by Pepperdine. The Waves commit
ted four errors in the game, and only five of the
Card's nine runs were earned.
While Pepperdine held the lead for much of
the game, Stanford mounted a three-run rally to
tie the game in the eighth inning before getting
the walk-off victory.
Though Stanford's offense was very strong, its
pitching seemed determined to keep the Waves
in the game. Stanford pitchers issued 10 walks
and hit four Pepperdine batters. Sophomore

starter Brett Mooneyham left the game after five
innings, giving up three runs while walking five
and striking out five.

Fielding mistakes also hurt Stanford, with
three errors committed by Stanford's defense.
In the second game of the series, Stanford's
pitching and defense were much stronger. Sopho
more starter Jordan Pries threw 116 pitches en
route to a complete-game shutout of Pepperdine,

Junior catcher Zach Jones posed an offensive threat to all three teams that
Stanford faced over spring break, charging the Card to a three-game sweep
of Pepperdine and series win against USC, despite faltering pitching.

He gave up just two hits and two
walks while striking out six.
Offensively, Stanford was led by
junior shortstop Jake Schlander, who
had four RBIs on two hits. Overall,
the Cardinal offense scored 10 runs,
including eight off Pepperdine start
ing pitcher Matt Bywater.
The next day the Cardinal com
pleted its sweep with an 11-6 win.
Freshman third baseman Kenny
Diekroeger led Stanford's offense
with four RBIs, including a home
run. Gaffney was the Card's second
offensive leader, contributing two
more RBIs.
"[The freshmen] are starting to
take on larger roles and fill some
holes we had earlier in the season,"
Jones said.
"Having so many freshmen, we
didn't know who we were early in the
season," Schlander added. "It was a
process of figuring it out and grow
ing. Recently, the freshmen have
stepped up."
While it couldn't match Pries' ear
lier performance, the Cardinal pitch
ing staff held up well against the Pep
perdine offense. Sophomores Scott
Snodgress and Chris Reed and fresh
man Mark Appel gave up six runs on
8.2 innings pitched combined.
Stanford's fourth game of spring
break came on the road in Stockton,
Calif, against Pacific. Despite getting
14 hits, Stanford fell 9-4, leaving 14
runners on base over the course of
the game. The Cardinal offense was
led by Jones, who had two RBIs. In
deed, Jones has emerged as one of
Stanford's top threats recently.
"Early in the season I didn't have
my timing down," he said. "Over the
break I was able to take a lot of extra
swings and work out the kinks."
After the improvements made
against Pepperdine, Stanford's pitch
ing slid backwards against the Tiger
offense. Mooneyham, the starter,
pitched only 0.2 innings. Overall, the
Card used six pitchers, none of whom
stayed in for longer than 2.1 innings.
Stanford also committed two
fielding errors, including one by jun
ior second baseman Colin Walsh that
led directly to runs for Pacific. Four
of the Tigers' nine runs were un
earned.
Stanford looked to rebound
against USC. Despite dropping the
first game, the Cardinal came back
strongly and took the games on Sat
urday and Sunday.
The first game saw the Cardinal
offense turn in another solid per
formance. The first three hitters in
the order Walsh, Jones and
Gaffney combined for eight hits
and four RBIs.
"It's always important for the top
of the lineup to get on base," Jones
said. "Before spring break we basi
cally weren't scoring in the first in
ning."
"Hitting and scoring are conta
gious, so if we can get on base it sets
the tone for the rest of the lineup," he
continued.
Through the fifth inning, Stanford
held a slim 8-7 lead over the Trojans.
However, USC pitching shut down
the Cardinal lineup for the remain
der of the game. Trojan pitcher
Shuhei Fujiya was especially effec
tive, allowing only one run in three
innings en route to earning the win.
Meanwhile, Stanford's pitching
continued to struggle, as did its de
fense. Appel, the starting pitcher,
gave up six runs (all earned) in 2.2 in
nings while issuing four walks.
Snodgress, who came in to relieve
Appel, was similarly ineffective, al
lowing five runs (also all earned) in
2.2 innings. The Cardinal defense
also committed two errors in the
game, one of which led to a USC run.
Stanford lost to USC by a final
score of 13-8. The Trojans pulled
away with a four-run rally in the sixth
inning and added two more runs in

the eighth to put the Card away.
"Friday's game we played pretty
badly," Schlander said. "We kept our
selves in the game but we know we
should have given a better effort
[and] at least it shows that our team
has some pretty good fight in it."
The next game, on Saturday,
ended with another walk-off victory
for Stanford. The teams battled back
and forth all game before the Cardi
nal finally took the game in the ninth
inning with another clutch hit from
Jones. He delivered a two-out single
with the bases loaded to finish off the
Trojans.The final score was 5-4.
Pries turned in another strong
performance on the mound, giving
up four runs in seven innings of work
while throwing 121 pitches. Sopho
more reliever Brian Busick closed
out the game with two scoreless in
nings and earned his second win of
the season.
With the series up for grabs on
Sunday, Stanford turned in its
strongest game of the series, winning
3-1 over the Trojans. Uncharacteristi
cally, the Cardinal rode its pitching to
victory.
Leadoff hitter Walsh was Stan
ford's top threat at the plate, with
three hits and two RBIs in four at
bats. USC's pitching was generally
effective, with starter Andrew Triggs
giving up three runs in his 6.1 innings
of work.
After his rough outings against
Pepperdine and Pacific, Mooneyham
bounced back very well. He started
the game for the Card and gave up
only one run on three hits in six in
nings. Junior Alex Pracher relieved
Mooneyham and pitched three
shutout innings at the end of the
game, bringing his record to 4-0 on
the season.
"Our hole the whole season is that
our pitching hasn't been up to par,"
Jones said. "I know we have the arms
to do well, so it was huge for those
guys to step up so we could salvage
the series."
"You always want to start Pac-lOs
well. It gives you a chance to finish
high in the conference," Schlander
added. "Our goal is to win every Pac
-10 series. If we do that we will be
where we want to be when the post
season begins."
Stanford's next game is tonight at
Sunken Diamond. The Card will take
on San Francisco at 5:30 p.m., before
continuing Pac-10 play at UCLA
next weekend. Stanford will look to
build on its recent pitching perform
ances, and continue to deploy a high
powered offense. The Dons (12-13)
are coming off a 2-1 series loss to UC-
Santa Barbara and will look to senior
shortstop Derek Poppert to power
their offense.
