# CARD WITHSTANDS WAVES, TROJANS
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After taking a break for finals, the Stanford
baseball team played seven games over spring
break. From Mar. 19-21, the Cardinal (12-6)
swept a three-game series at home against Pep
perdine (8-14). It then fell to Pacific (14-7) on
Mar. 23, losing by a score of 9-4. Last weekend,
Stanford hosted USC for its first Pac-10 series of
the year and took two out of three games from
the Trojans (12-12).
Stanford's three games against the Waves
were a showcase of offensive firepower. The Car
dinal tallied a total of 30 runs in the series.
In the first game, Stanford took the win in
walk-off fashion for the fourth time this season,
pulling out a 9-8 victory at Sunken Diamond. Ju
nior catcher Zach Jones' hot hitting led the Card,
as he went 4-5 and hit the game-winning single. In
his first game hitting from the leadoff spot, fresh
man outfielder Tyler Gaffney notched two hits.
The Card did receive significant help from
poor fielding by Pepperdine. The Waves commit
ted four errors in the game, and only five of the
Card's nine runs were earned.
While Pepperdine held the lead for much of
the game, Stanford mounted a three-run rally to
tie the game in the eighth inning before getting
the walk-off victory.
Though Stanford's offense was very strong, its
pitching seemed determined to keep the Waves
in the game. Stanford pitchers issued 10 walks
and hit four Pepperdine batters. Sophomore

starter Brett Mooneyham left the game after five
innings, giving up three runs while walking five
and striking out five.

Fielding mistakes also hurt Stanford, with
three errors committed by Stanford's defense.
In the second game of the series, Stanford's
pitching and defense were much stronger. Sopho
more starter Jordan Pries threw 116 pitches en
route to a complete-game shutout of Pepperdine,
