# Swimming with Gators
## Despite winning five events, Stanford finishes second in NCAA to Florida 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After leading the competition for most of the
NCAA Championship meet, which took place on
Mar. 18-20 in West Lafayette, Ind., the Stanford
women's swimming team seemed poised to take
home its first national title since 1998. However,
the No. 1 Cardinal (9-0,5-0 Pac-10) was in second
place by the tournament's end, falling to Florida by
a razor-thin margin of 2.5 points.
The Cardinal's second-place finish is the pro
gram's best since 2001.
The Gators' final total was 382 points, just ahead
of Stanford's 379.5. Rounding out the top five were
California with 363 points, Arizona with 359.5
points and Georgia with 342.5 points. The fifth
place Bulldogs shared the No. 1 national ranking
with the Card heading into the meet.

Though Stanford was very close to winning a
national title, head coach Lea Maurer was not dis
appointed in the results put up by her squad.
"We were not the favored team to win and we
almost stole it," Maurer wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "I think we exceeded expectations and built
a stronger foundation for future efforts at the
championship title."
This season's finish is also the best in Maurer's
tenure as head coach.
"We had a tremendous team effort where we
were together and focused for six tough sessions,
fighting hard as a group to chase down our dreams
together," she said.
Individually, Stanford's best performances
came from senior captains Julia Smit and Elaine
Breeden. Each swimmer won two individual na
tional titles.
Smit won both the 200- and 400-yard individual
medley races. She came into the NCAAs after set
ting new American records in both races at the Pac
-10 Conference Championships.
Breeden's two victories came in the 100- and
200-yard butterfly. Her win in the 200 fly came by a
thin margin of .13 seconds over USC sophomore

Katinka Hosszu.
This meet also marked the third time Breeden
has won a national title in the 200 fly. She is only the
third swimmer in NCAA history to accomplish this
feat.
"Julia [Smit] and Elaine [Breeden] were singu
larly driven by the idea of doing as much as they
could to help our team win," Maurer said. "I could
n't ask for better leadership and stronger athletic
achievements than those two women have given
me over the past four years."
"I would have loved to give them the champi
onship because they have given so much to Stan
ford University swimming and diving," she contin
ued. "It would have been a perfect ending to a per
fect college career. They are champions and this
will fuel them as they pursue new dreams. I hope
they can feel good about being perfect-ish."
In addition to those four events, Stanford also
won a national title in the 400-yard freestyle relay.
The team consisted of Smit, junior Kate Dwelley
and sophomores Betsy Webb and Sam Woodward.

Senior Elaine Breeden won both the 100-and 200-yard butterfly races, becoming only the third swimmer in NCAA history to win the 200 fly national title three years running.
Breeden and senior Julia Smit propelled women's swimming to second place at the NCAA Championship meet on March 18-20, falling just short of Florida by 2.5 points.
medley relay took second place.
Aside from winning individual
events, the Card also garnered nu
merous All-American honors, which
are awarded to swimmers finishing in
the top 16 of an event. Smit, Webb
and Dwelley all took seven All-
American honors apiece.

"I thought our team handled
everything with tremendous confi
dence and poise," Maurer said.
While the Cardinal turned in a
strong performance in the pool, the
diving team met with a much stiffer
challenge. Stanford's only entry in all
three diving events was junior Meg
Hostage. She placed 18th in platform
diving, 23rd on the three-meter
springboard and 32nd on the one
meter springboard.
With the season now concluded,
Maurer has already turned her

thoughts to next year. Though Stan
ford will be losing its top two swim
mers, Smit and Breeden, to gradua
tion, Maurer says she remains confi
dent that her team will be just as
strong in the future.
"I would like to believe that peo
ple will look at what we need to do
differently starting this week and
come back hungry for the next sea
son," she said.
