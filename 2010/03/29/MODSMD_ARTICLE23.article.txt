# CARD PICKS UP SECOND AFTER FALLS
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Following a win against UC-Davis on Mar. 21, the Stanford
women's gymnastics team took second place at the Pac-10 Confer
ence Championships in Tucson, Ariz, on Saturday, finishing with
196.550 points to UCLA's 197.350.
Though the Cardinal was unable to produce the 24 solid routines
it had hoped for in either meet, the team still managed to handily de
feat Davis, 196.600-194.575, and finish with a solid second at the Pac
10s. No. 6 Stanford (15-3) and No. 3 UCLA (13-3) have swapped
conference titles every year since 1998, and the Bruins continued
the combined streak at McKale Center on Saturday.
After a shaky start through the first two rotations, however, Stan
ford's second-place position was not settled until the very end, as the
Card fought a three-way battle against Oregon State and Arizona.
Sophomore Nicole Pechanec rose to the occasion and scored a
9.80 on the uneven bars, following a teammate's fall. Her perform
ance "changed the momentum and got us back on track," said head
coach Kristen Smyth.
Similarly, in the second event on the beam, Cardinal gymnasts
later in the rotation had to make up for previous teammates' falls.
Senior captain Carly Janiga, named the Pac-10 Scholar-Athlete of
the Year for women's gymnastics, delivered a 9.85 immediately after
a fall, while senior Tenaya West and freshman Ashley Morgan
stepped up and earned 9.80s as well.
West's beam performance was particularly remarkable, as it was
the first time West had competed on beam outside of exhibition. For
the past four years, she has solely been a part of the floor rotation in
actual competition. Smyth had continually reminded her to be
ready for the beam if needed, and her time to shine came on Satur
day.
"Our lineups are never locked in," Smyth said. "That's the beau
ty of having such great kids, knowing the spots are open to fight for,
which will make them better. We do have options and we do have
depth. The kids know they always have to be ready."
Smyth was proud of her team's ability to cover for one another,
especially after a start that was "a little unsettling."
"It was nice to see that we can respond to these situations in
which we don't start off as well as we'd like to," Smyth said. "Our
overall performance was not smooth by any means, but the later
girls in the rotation definitely fought for everything and took advan
tage of the opportunities to cover each other and make up for pre
vious mistakes. We did a great job of not allowing our falls to get the
better of us."
These clutch performances allowed the Card to remain in con
tention for the second place spot, vying with Oregon State and Ari
zona behind UCLA, who had clearly secured first place. But it was
the team's floor rotation that helped separate Stanford from the
Beavers and Sun Devils, and its 49.425 moved the Cardinal comfort
ably into sole possession of second place.
The seniors, including West and Allyse Ishino, gave strong per
formances, and Janiga captured the Pac-10 floor title with a 9.925.
Senior Blair Ryland also achieved her highest career score of
9.875.

Senior captain Carly Janiga gave a clutch performance on beam after a teammate's fall,
helping the Card, to a second-place finish at the Pac-10 Conference Championships on
Saturday.
Stanford's final event, the vault,
was solid, although not as clean as the
team may have wanted.
"We ran into some bumps in the
road, and the start was certainly
shaky, but I'm proud of our effort to
hang in there," Smyth said.
Stanford gymnasts also tallied nu
merous individual honors, as Janiga
and Ishino both finished in the top
three for the all-around, coming in
second and third place, respectively.
Janiga, who claimed the all-around
title last year, placed in the top five in
every event for the day.
The team now sets its sights on the
remaining few weeks of the season,
preparing for the NCAA Regionals
and striving to appear in the Super Six
Finals, which has been the primary
goal since the beginning of the season.
