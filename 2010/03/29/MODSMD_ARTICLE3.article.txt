## Health care reform passes 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Eric Messinger 
After a year of debate and contro
versy, health care reform legislation
passed in its final form through two
bills late this month. The passage will
enact one of the largest pieces of so
cial legislation in the last several
decades.
The legislation will end the denial
of coverage to people with pre-exist
ing conditions, expand the number of
people covered by Medicaid, provide
subsidies for purchasing insurance for
lower-income families, penalize not
purchasing insurance and create new
taxes, in addition to a number of other
measures.
The Congressional Budget Office
estimates that the legislation will, in
the next ten years, cost $940 billion,
but will also reduce the deficit by $l3O
billion. The office also anticipates that
the reform will cover more than 30
million Americans.
Reform passed without the sup
port of a single Republican in either
the House or the Senate. Republicans
have been vocal in their opposition to
the Democratic legislation since early
2009. Some Democrats also opposed
all or part of the legislation in both the
House and the Senate.
Democratic legislators passed re
form through two bills: The Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act,
the main bill, and the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of
2010, which amended perceived prob
lems with the bill and also included
student loan reform legislation.
The main bill passed the Senate in
December by a vote of 60-39, and
passed the House this month 219-212.
The Health Care and Education Rec
onciliation Act passed the House of
Representatives in two votes, owing
to a minor change: the first 220-211,
the second 220-207. The Senate
passed the bill 56-43.
President Obama signed the Pa
tient Protection and Affordable Care
Act into law on Mar. 24 at a ceremony
that emphasized the historical signifi
cance of the legislation.
"And we have now just enshrined,
as soon as I sign this bill, the core prin
ciple that everybody should have
some basic security when it comes to
their health care," he said.
