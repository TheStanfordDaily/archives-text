# Admit rate drops to 7.2 percent
## Stanford accepts 2,300 for the Class of 2014 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
Following the release of admis
sion decisions last Friday, 2,300 appli
cants will have the opportunity to call
themselves members of the Stanford
Class of 2014 this coming fall.
Over the last several years, record
numbers have marked Stanford's ad
mission season. The University has
again set a record by accepting only
7.2 percent of this year's applicant
pool out of more than 32,000 stu
dents.
The number of applicants also
jumped from the approximate 30,000
applications received for the Class of

2013. Stanford admitted 2,427 stu
dents in 2009, including 127 appli
cants from the waitlist.
An anticipated 20 transfer stu
dents will also be accepted this year
and 998 students were waitlisted.
The number of early action appli
cants rose 3.8 percent to 5,566 appli
cants, and the projected size of next
year's freshman class is around 1,700
students.
Admission decisions were re
leased six days ahead of schedule to
"alleviate anxiety," according to Di
rector of Admission Shawn Abbott.
Just three percent of applicants were
given a spot on the waitlist. Abbott
said that dropping to a 7.2 percent

admit rate makes "admission more
competitive than ever before."
To deal with the rise in applica
tions, reading was divided between
24 admission officers and part-time
hours were raised to 30 hours per
week from 20. According to Abbott,
the online system greatly expedited
the processing of applications, mean
ing that applications could be read
immediately after the submission
deadline.
"We still move through each ap
plication the same way, reading all
parts and providing a thorough, ho
listic review," wrote Abbott in an e
mail to The Daily in February. "Every
application is still read by a human

being and there is no pre-screening
done for any part of the applicant
pool."
Harvard, Princeton and the Uni
versity of Chicago also saw a rise in
applicant numbers, with Princeton
seeing a 19-percent increase from
just last year. These universities will
release their admission decisions on
April Ist.
The nationwide influx is largely
attributed to lower acceptance rates
driving students to apply to more
schools to better their odds of accept
ance. Last year, Stanford was ranked
the third most selective university in
the nation behind Harvard and Yale,
both of which also accepted seven

percent of applicants last year.
Spencer Nelson, one of 753 stu
dents accepted from the early action
pool in December, accepted his ad
mission offer last week. Initially he
planned on applying to Dartmouth
early, but said that Stanford's early
action program, which is non-binding
and a much shorter wait, was "much
more attractive."
"It was awful waiting to hear," he
said. "I would walk around thinking,
'Five more days, five more days."'
And when the early action deci
sions were released ahead of sched
ule, Nelson said, "it was a great relief."
"Waiting to hear the decision was
like walking on hot coals," he said.
"And I was pretty sure that if I got in
I would want to go."
"I imagine that for the kids who
didn't get in, hearing before the
promised date would have been
awful, but waiting really sucks," Nel
son said.
Accepted students have until
May 1 to accept or reject their offer.
