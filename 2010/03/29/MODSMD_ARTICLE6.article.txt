## Nominations Committee surveys student input 
### TINA ZHENG 
The ASSU Nominations Commission
(NomCom) recently released the results of a
survey of 81 student members of University
committees to gauge their contributions and
learn about committee issues during winter
quarter.
The survey was an attempt to address prior
complaints of poor communication and to set
a precedent for future years and is the first of
its kind to gather this level of data, according
to NomCom Chair Jonathan Bakke, a gradu
ate student in chemical engineering. The plans

for the survey had been in place since last
spring.
NomCom worked out the logistics early
fall quarter and sent surveys out in December
and February. Bakke then sent the results to
the Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate
Student Council (GSC), a response to past
complaints of inadequate transparency.
"They specifically asked for reports this
year and last year, so we wanted to put some
thing together that they could look at," Bakke
said. "For important issues, they can specifical
ly ask to bring in those committee members."
The GSC and the Vaden Advisory Board

have already brought in committee members
because of recent controversies surrounding
insurance, according to Bakke,
"Generally, every committee operates very
differently," he said. "A lot of them are run in
dividually. They're in different departments,
there are different committee chairs and there
are different people in the committee who are
all talking about different issues."
Much of the committees' activities depend
on year-to-year issues. The survey results indi
cated that the Committee on Graduate Hous
ing dealt with issues pertaining to Munger's
opening; the Alcohol Advisory Committee

discussed new alcohol policies and renewal of
the AlcoholEDU program.
Bakke explained that the administration
does not provide oversight in monitoring com
mittees.
"NomCom is pretty much the only thing
that keeps track of University committees,"
Bakke said. "There are no written definitions
about how the committees run, and most of
them run on a need-to basis."
"It's hard to predict from year to year how
active a committee is going to be," Bakke said,
though he emphasized that many
committees were quite consistent.
Danny Crichton 'll is a member of
the Registrar's Student Advisory
Board, which he said has been highly
active during the past two quarters.
Crichton is a columnist for The Daily.
"The Registrar's Student Adviso
ry Board has met monthly to find
new solutions to student problems,
among them the need to expand the

number of features of the iPhone ap
plication and re-examination of end
of-quarter course evaluations,"
Crichton said. "All of these initia
tives will be seen by students over
the course of the next year."
Crichton was pleased with the im
plementation of the survey this year.
"I thought the survey was good. It
provided a lot of great feedback to
the Nominations Commission,"
Crichton said.
Students on other committees,
however, indicated frustration with
the year so far. An anonymous Din
ing Committee member responding
to the survey said the committee had

yet to meet and that, after one stu
dent member left campus, Eric Mon
tell, the executive director of Stan
ford Dining, made the remaining

committee members "dining ambas
sadors" instead.
Montell said the committee had
too difficult a time finding a time to

meet, given the students' class sched
ules, and believes their time is better
spent as ambassadors. He described
that program as "part of our strategic
initiative to actively engage students
in the dining community building ex
perience."
Carole Pertofksy, director of
Vaden Health Promotion Services,
heads the Sexual Violence Advisory
Board (SVAB).
"Student involvement is crucial
to the SVAB mission," Pertofsky
said. "We have six NomCom mem
bers, a PHE and grad students."
Bakke predicted the results of the
survey would be most applicable to

future years' commissions in relay
ing an accurate portrayal of meeting
frequency and detailed operations to
future applicants.
"We didn't have any information
when we were interviewing last
spring quarter about what commit
tees had talked about the previous
year," Bakke said. "We wanted to
create some sort of legacy that future
NomComs could use."
