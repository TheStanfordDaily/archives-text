## Nominations Committee surveys student input 
### TINA ZHENG 
The ASSU Nominations Commission
(NomCom) recently released the results of a
survey of 81 student members of University
committees to gauge their contributions and
learn about committee issues during winter
quarter.
The survey was an attempt to address prior
complaints of poor communication and to set
a precedent for future years and is the first of
its kind to gather this level of data, according
to NomCom Chair Jonathan Bakke, a gradu
ate student in chemical engineering. The plans

for the survey had been in place since last
spring.
NomCom worked out the logistics early
fall quarter and sent surveys out in December
and February. Bakke then sent the results to
the Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate
Student Council (GSC), a response to past
complaints of inadequate transparency.
"They specifically asked for reports this
year and last year, so we wanted to put some
thing together that they could look at," Bakke
said. "For important issues, they can specifical
ly ask to bring in those committee members."
The GSC and the Vaden Advisory Board

have already brought in committee members
because of recent controversies surrounding
insurance, according to Bakke,
"Generally, every committee operates very
differently," he said. "A lot of them are run in
dividually. They're in different departments,
there are different committee chairs and there
are different people in the committee who are
all talking about different issues."
Much of the committees' activities depend
on year-to-year issues. The survey results indi
cated that the Committee on Graduate Hous
ing dealt with issues pertaining to Munger's
opening; the Alcohol Advisory Committee

discussed new alcohol policies and renewal of
the AlcoholEDU program.
Bakke explained that the administration
does not provide oversight in monitoring com
mittees.
"NomCom is pretty much the only thing
that keeps track of University committees,"
Bakke said. "There are no written definitions
about how the committees run, and most of
them run on a need-to basis."
"It's hard to predict from year to year how
active a committee is going to be," Bakke said,
