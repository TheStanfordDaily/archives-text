## Private or Public? 
### SUSANNA KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It doesn't take long for a student to glance
over someone's shoulder during class to
find a classmate browsing through pic
tures, updating their status or chatting
with friends on Facebook. In total, over
52,000 people have joined Facebook's Stanford
network, yet it is unlikely that most of those
users have read or are even aware of the change
in the social networking giant's privacy policy.
Unless users have since altered their priva
cy settings, Facebook's new privacy policy,
which was introduced over three months ago,
made several profile fields open to view to any
one on the Web. This information includes an
individual's profile pictures, full name, loca
tion, friends, networks and fan pages.
In other changes, Facebook eliminated re
gional networks that grouped users by location
and now only classifies individuals based on
schools or companies. Facebook now automat
ically reveals your current city as public infor
mation unless that field is deleted completely.
Users now choose between "recommend
ed" settings that make information, like pho
tos, available to the public, "friends of friends"
or "everyone," unless privacy settings are tai
lored individually.
Tara Jones 'lO is one of those currently in
Facebook's Stanford network who is very con
scious of her online presence. She said she was
shocked when she learned in her Media
Processes and Effects class that the content of
a social networking profile could remain on
line after deleting an account.
"I remember sitting in lecture after learning
this and actually being terrified," Jones said.
She said she is especially conscious of informa
tion exposure because of the effect it could
have on any future employers who may see her
profile and judge.
"I have heard of employers who have de
cided between two prospective employees by
comparing their Facebook pages," she said.
But Stanford communication professor
Fred Turner thinks that many students believe
that they are entitled to a level of privacy that

social networking sites don't actually provide.
Turner taught Communication 120: Digital
Media in Society last spring before the policy
change and asked his students how many had
read Facebook's privacy policy. Of the 120 stu
dents in the class who used Facebook, only two

had read the privacy policy.
"I explained to them that even regardless of
the privacy policy, your friends can circulate
your data without your will," Turner said. He
demonstrated this by accessing his teenage
daughter's profile page during class, a move

that prompted immediate discussion among
his students.
"They were so angry, and they thought I
was the worst father out there," he said.
The changes in Facebook's privacy policy
are detailed in over 5,000 words in eight sepa
rate sections online. One section entitled
"How we share information" describes "risks
inherent in sharing information." The section
goes on to detail how an individual's private in
formation can be compromised by friends who
can share data with Facebook applications as
well as the risks inherent with weak login pass
words.
Turner compares users' privacy mispercep
tion of Facebook to that of the property of a
mall.
"Some spaces are thought of as social when
in fact they are actually corporate," Turner
said. "Malls have a different legal structure
than that of a public square or town."
Charlene Li, of consulting firm Altimeter
Group and co-author of the book
"Groundswell: Winning in a World Trans
formed by Social Technologies" said Face
book asks for permission to publish certain in
formation but doesn't remind users of its pol
icy frequently enough. Currently Facebook
hosts a "Facebook Site Governance" page in
which the company announces its website
changes and where users can provide feed
back.
"They do a good job telling people what's
going on, but people forget," Li said.
Li acknowledged that public views of pri
vacy boundaries do change.
"If you remember when caller ID first ap
peared, people were disturbed that someone
knew who they were before they picked up
the phone," she said. "Those perceptions
changed. Now people are suspicious to pick
up the phone when someone has blocked
caller ID."
For students like Stephanie Vezich TO, the
privacy change doesn't concern her and
she hasn't changed her online habits.
"I don't really have many embarrassing
things there to begin with," Vezich said.
A Facebook press release indicated that

the site has over 400 million active users, over
half of which log onto the site each day. It's
also estimated that users upload three billion
photos to the site every month.
Of those user numbers, there are some
dedicated Facebook users who provide feed
back to the company. The initial post first an
nouncing the December 9 private policy
change has received over 3,000 comments
from users. It's not clear how or even if the
company has responded to each concern.
Dong Liu 'lO is aware of the policy change,
but has not read the new guidelines.
"I think about internet privacy from time
to time," said Liu, a media studies co-term.
"But since we're willing to put ourselves on
the social networking sites, to a certain extent
we have to acknowledge that some of this in
formation will be seen by other people."
