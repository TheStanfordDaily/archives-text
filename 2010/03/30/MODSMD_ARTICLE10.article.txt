## SUDOKU CHAMP TALKS SKILLS, SPOILS

pion Thomas Snyder talks
exactly like he solves Sudoku
quickly and eagerly. And
...JL once he starts, he doesn’t stop.
“It’s not a very famous thing to be,”
Snyder said, describing his claim to
fame. Except for the occasional cash
prize, Play Station Portable or set of bar
tending tools to which Snyder
laughed, “the people who come to these
sorts of tournaments aren't exactly lush
es” “pretty much all you get is your
name on a Wikipedia entry.”
Sudoku, the mathematical equivalent
of a crossword puzzle, has become an
international phenomenon in recent
years. Originating in Japan and making a
splash in the U.S. in the 19705, it means
“single number” in Japanese. The square
puzzle consists of a nine-by-nine grid in
which players try to fill each row, column
and three-by-three sub-grid with the
numbers one through nine. Requiring
less factual knowledge than a crossword
puzzle, for many Sudoku is the perfect
brainteaser.
“I describe it as my morning coffee
routine,” Snyder said, seeming in no evi
dent need of a caffeine pick-me-up. “I can
do two puzzles in six minutes, feel that my
brain has woken up and then go to work.”
By day, 30-year-old Snyder works on
postdoctoral research in Stanford’s bio
engineering program. His job involves

using DNA sequencing to monitor
patients receiving heart and lung trans
plants.
“Instead of trying to treat disease,
we’re trying to prevent it,” said Snyder,
who envisions a future in diagnostic
medicine.
A native of Buffalo, N.Y., Snyder
moved across the country to double
major in chemistry and economics at
Caltech. He went on to graduate school
at Harvard, and it was there that he tried
out Sudoku.
“They were putting Sudoku on the
front page of the newspaper, above what
Tony Blair had done that day,” Snyder
recalled. “And, if you went to an airport
bookstore, you’d see a whole wall of
Sudoku books. An airport bookstore is
the most compressed place to sell any
thing, so to get a whole wall must mean
it’s pretty special.”
It was, and Snyder was hooked.
Although a busy work schedule these
days limits Snyder to a couple of Sudoku
puzzles per week, back in graduate
school he says he was solving about a
hundred every month. That was when he
had a revelation.
“It turns out there are such things as
Sudoku competitions!” he said.
Snyder decided to showcase his skills
in the professional arena. He took and
passed the online qualifications for the
American Sudoku team nowadays,
qualifications aren’t done online due to
the availability of computerized solvers
earning himself a spot in the first ever
World Sudoku Championship.

Snyder described the playoffs at the
2006 competition in Lucca, Italy as “a
weird game of Survivor.”
“There were nine people who all got
a puzzle, and whoever did the worst in it,
now we’ve got eight, now we have seven,
now we have six,” he said.
“Of course we get to the last puzzle,
and I said I come from Buffalo, N.Y., and
if you think of our sports teams, we
always choke in the last round,” he con
tinued. “I choked in the last puzzle, and
for a whole year that nagged at me.”
By the next year’s world champi
onship in Prague, he had practiced
enough and was determined to win. He

clinched the championship in Prague
and took the top spot again at the 2008
championship in India.
•Snyder described the 2009 champi
onship as “messy,” stressing that “the
Slovakian organizers had made puzzles
that you couldn’t solve without guessing,
and even with guessing you’d have to guess
luckily. The puzzles themselves weren’t
selecting great solvers necessarily.”
This year, the U.S. is hosting the
Sudoku World Championship, giving
Snyder a chance to actually write puz
zles for the tournament. Snyder hopes to
create Sudoku puzzles that have some
sort of soulful or aesthetic element to

them in other words, puzzles that he
himself would enjoy solving.
“As much as there is a title and a win
ner, the sense of being the fastest in the
world is not as important as giving back
to the world of puzzles and defining
what a Sudoku should be,’" he said.
He in fact prefers handcrafted
Sudoku puzzles, as opposed to those
generated by computers. He likes to
think that an artfully crafted puzzle
allows the solver to communicate with
the creator, who has left behind “a trail
of breadcrumbs.”
And for Snyder —as for the millions
of Sudoku solvers worldwide that
sense of completion, plus the puzzle’s
downright addictiveness, keeps him
coming back to the game.
“It’s that sort of ‘look, I can do it’
feeling,” Snyder said. “It’s a form of self
reinforcement. You feel like you're
learning. There aren’t many things you
can do where you can feel your invest
ment of time giving back a reward.”
