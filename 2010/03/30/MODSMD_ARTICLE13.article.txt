## Senates discusses Daily, FLiCKS 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
will meet in closed session for the first
time this year to discuss whether or not
to allow The Daily to make a confiden
tial disclosure of some financial infor
mation ahead of next week’s special
fees election.
All 55 campus organizations seek
ing special fees are required by the
ASSU Joint Bylaws to publicly disclose
their assets, reserves, bank accounts
and sources of funding other than stu
dent fees.

The Daily submitted that informa
tion only to the Senate and has asked
that it not be made available to voters.
Jason Shen *OB M.S. ‘O9, the chief oper
ating officer, cited the general policy of
the newspaper, which is a nonprofit.
“We’re holding to a general rule re
garding release of financial informa
tion,” Shen said. “It’s not that this or
anything else is particularly vulnerable.
It’s just generally not a good idea to re
lease your financial information pub
licly unless you know there’s a com
pelling need to do so, and we didn’t see
one when we were initially making that
decision to prepare documents for the

Senate.”
Last week, Elections Commissioner
Quinn Slack ‘ll said the Senate needed
to decide whether or not it would con
sider The Daily's disclosure as “com
plete,” a requirement for remaining on
the special fees ballot.
Slack told senators on the public
Senate e-mail list that they “need to
take into account” the ASSU Constitu
tion’s Freedom of Information section,
which says “all records of any Associa
tion entity must be available for scruti
ny by the public” except, among other
records, “proprietary business infor
mation of Association businesses [and]
financial records for non-funded ac
counts of organizations banking with
the Association.”

He said that by submitting infor
mation to the Senate, groups’ records
would become records of an “Associ
ation entity,” but that the ASSU Con
stitutional Council has ultimate au
thority on the issue and that the Sen
ate may decide that the disclosure was
“complete.”
Slack said The Daily is the only spe
cial fees candidate seeking to keep its
disclosure confidential, and the only to
ever do so, in his memory. He said “ide
ally,” the question would have been
dealt with earlier, but he only noticed
the “specificity and strength” of the by-

laws language last month.
“In my view, everybody’s actions
have been in good faith so far,” Slack
said.
The Senate will meet Tuesday
evening and vote in open session after
a closed-session discussion about The
Daily, said Senate Chair Varun
SivaramTl.
Senator Alex Katz T2 also partici
pated in the public list discussion.
“In my opinion, the disclosure was
insufficient,’’ he said, adding that he be
lieves The Daily should also disclose “a
complete list of assets held by Friends
of the Stanford Daily.” The Friends of
The Stanford Daily Foundation, a non
profit organization of Daily alumni,
holds reserves for The Daily: it does not
fund The Daily’s printing costs.
Katz also is the executive editor of
The Stanford Review, which has been
investigating the relationship between
The Friends and The Daily since last
fall.
The Daily is seeking undergraduate

voters’ approval for $89,500 in special
fees for printing costs in the April 8
election.
Other Election Updates
The Senate Appropriations Com
mittee decided Monday to expand
funding for the Stanford Chaparral’s
printing costs to 2,000 copies per issue
instead of the 1,000 the committee ini
tially approved.
The special fees request for another
group, Sunday FUCKS, was revised
online this week. A request for about
$67,000 initially appeared; in fact, the
group is requesting $57,581.
The Elections Commission also
launched http://voterguide.stanford.
edu, which has information on candi
dates for Senate, Graduate Student
Council, ASSU executive and special
fees provided by candidates them
selves.
