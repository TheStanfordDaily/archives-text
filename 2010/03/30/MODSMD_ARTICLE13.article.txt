## Senates discusses Daily, FLiCKS 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
will meet in closed session for the first
time this year to discuss whether or not
to allow The Daily to make a confiden
tial disclosure of some financial infor
mation ahead of next week’s special
fees election.
All 55 campus organizations seek
ing special fees are required by the
ASSU Joint Bylaws to publicly disclose
their assets, reserves, bank accounts
and sources of funding other than stu
dent fees.

The Daily submitted that informa
tion only to the Senate and has asked
that it not be made available to voters.
Jason Shen *OB M.S. ‘O9, the chief oper
ating officer, cited the general policy of
the newspaper, which is a nonprofit.
“We’re holding to a general rule re
garding release of financial informa
tion,” Shen said. “It’s not that this or
anything else is particularly vulnerable.
It’s just generally not a good idea to re
lease your financial information pub
licly unless you know there’s a com
pelling need to do so, and we didn’t see
one when we were initially making that
decision to prepare documents for the

Senate.”
Last week, Elections Commissioner
Quinn Slack ‘ll said the Senate needed
to decide whether or not it would con
sider The Daily's disclosure as “com
plete,” a requirement for remaining on
the special fees ballot.
Slack told senators on the public
Senate e-mail list that they “need to
take into account” the ASSU Constitu
tion’s Freedom of Information section,
which says “all records of any Associa
tion entity must be available for scruti
ny by the public” except, among other
