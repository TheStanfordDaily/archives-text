# STUDENT LIFE
## Recent grads receive e-mail glitch 
### CAITY MONROE 
Members of the Class of 2009 re
ceived an unexpected notification this
month that their SUNet ID “for life”
privileges might, in fact, suffer a prema
ture death.
The SUNet ID accounts that stu
dents open upon enrollment-at Stan
ford give them access to e-mail ad
dresses ending in “@stanford.edu” in
addition to other online services. These
accounts used to be terminated after
students graduated.
However, at the request of many
alumni and after considerable work
with the administration, the class of ‘O9
and future graduates should be able to
keep their SUNet ID for e-mail for
warding, ASSU executives announced
in October.
But some members of last year’s
graduating class received e-mails this
month saying that services for their ac
count would expire soon unless their
account is sponsored or their affiliation
with Stanford changes. The announce
ment confused some recent graduates
and prompted inquiries from con
cerned alumni.
ASSU President David Gobaud, a
coterminal student in computer sci
ence, said that his team has been in con
tact with Information Technology Ser

vices (ITS) and is currently awaiting a
resolution.
After the announcement, many stu
dents contacted both ITS and Gobaud
about the apparent glitch.
“We got a lot of e-mails about it and
we told everyone that nothing has
changed since the announcement that
was made in [the] fall,” Gobaud wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily.
For recent graduates who worry
about the hassle of switching to an en
tirely new e-mail address, October’s
new policy was a welcome change.
“Hundreds of students let us know
after the announcement how grateful
they were for the change,” Gobaud
said.
Sanjana Tandon ‘O9 was one of the
recent graduates who received the ac
count termination notification.
“I kind of ignored it,” Tandon said
in an e-mail. “I was hoping it wasn’t
real.”
“I think it’s important to a lot of
people to retain that link to Stanford
that e-mail becomes a huge part of
your life for four years, and it’s kind of
sad to have to part with it,” she added.
Peter Kariuki ‘O9 agreed.
“I thought it was a great resource,”
he said.
“It’s useful when you’re trying to
get in touch with contacts to be able to

send e-mail from your Stanford ad
dress,” Kariuki added, alluding to the
credibility that comes with having an
affiliation with the University.
ITS still recognizes the new policy
on its Web site, which says, “Beginning
with the class of‘o9, students automat
ically retain their SUNet ID for email
forwarding.”
In the past, accounts were termi
nated following a 120-day grace peri
od after leaving Stanford.
Students who sent help requests
have been told that they will receive
an update on April 15 clarifying the
issue. For now, ITS and ASSU officers
are still in the process of fixing what
seems to be a mistaken e-mail.
“I’m assuming that there was a mis
take,” said Michael Dimaano of ITS.
“A lot of students sent the help re
quest about it, but right now we
haven’t heard back from the SUNet
ID-for-life project team about what
they’re going to do,” Dimaano said.
“We are pretty positive that they’ll be
able to resolve that issue. We just don’t
know what steps they are going to take
to do so.”
Other ITS affiliates declined to
comment.
