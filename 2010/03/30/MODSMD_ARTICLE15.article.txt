## EDITORIAL Preliminary study list deadline: silly and pointless 
### 
Yesterday, students returned to classes
for the onset of spring quarter, mind
ful of the fact that they needed to be
enrolled in at least 12 units by the end of the
day in order to avoid a $2OO fee from the
Registrar. Because of the new preliminary
study list deadline that went into effect this
year, undergraduates are required to sign up
on Axess for at least 12 units by the first day
of classes, while graduate students need at
least eight. While there may be several valid
reasons why the preliminary study list dead
line is beneficial, the practical considerations
of the new deadline make the policy seem
silly and ultimately meaningless.
Ideally, most undergraduates should be
able to form a general idea of at least twelve
units in which they would consider enrolling
by the first day of classes. It is not hard to en
roll in classes at Stanford to the contrary,
with the exception of the minority of courses
that require instructor consent, enrollment
for nearly all courses is as easy as clicking a
button on Axess. The problem, however, is
that Stanford has always maintained a tradi
tion of using the first week of the quarter as a
“shopping period” for classes, during which
time many students juggle, switch and re
arrange courses depending on their first im
pressions of courses as well as other consid
erations. Even with the preliminary study list
deadline in place, many students will contin
ue to shop for classes in this fashion, making
sweeping changes to their schedules during
the coming days and weeks. Ordinarily, most
students who were unsure of whether they
want to take a course would put off enrolling

until they made up their minds. Under the
new deadline, however, students are pres
sured to enroll in whatever classes they
“think” they might be taking just so they can
have at least 12 units.
What makes this policy so silly and point
less is the fact that even someone who has no
intention of remaining on campus for the full
quarter can still manage to find twelve ran
dom units in which to enroll. Because it is so
easy to enroll in random classes and be
cause the Registrar threatens a $2OO fee for
missing the deadline a lot of people who
are undecided about classes will simply pick
some out of the lists and enroll. This does not
pose much of a problem for students, but for
the University, especially for faculty and TAs,
it means that it will be all the more difficult to
gauge the size of classes during the first few
weeks of a quarter. The irony here is that this
deadline is meant to penalize students who
fail to enroll on time, but the real inconven
iences seem to be created for everyone but
students.
What the deadline does take away from
students is the sense of openness and possi
bility that once marked the beginning of new
quarters. Instead, the vibe coming from the
University seems to be that the more quickly
students settle on a study list, any study list,
the better it is for everyone. But since stu
dents have no reason to stick to the courses
on their preliminary study list, the deadline is
left void of purpose, while students are left
with the impression that making decisions
quickly is more important than making deci
sions thoughtfully.
