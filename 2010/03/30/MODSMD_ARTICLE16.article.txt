# Just A THOUGHT
## You Are Not Your Resume 
### Nikola Milanovic 
Doesn't going to Stanford make me bet
ter than other people? Why wouldn't
it? I benefit from an education consis
tently ranked as one of the best in the world.
Given that society places so much value on
having a great education, being a student at
Stanford should qualify me as more valuable
than other people. Shouldn’t it?
In general, we tend to place value on cer
tain categories of possessions or achieve
ments. Expensive goods and luxuries. High
profile, well-paying careers. Prestigious edu
cations. Nobody would argue that such things
are not valuable. So then why would having
nice things not make me a nice person? If I
am well-qualified, wealthy and attractive, and
I am commendable for my positive attributes,
shouldn’t this mean that I am a good person?
In the article “The Disparity Between In
tellect and Character,” Harvard psychiatry
Prof. Robert Coles describes an encounter
with a student working her way through col
lege. She approaches him, distraught, with a
problem that she cannot figure out; how can
successful, motivated students with straight
As still act like jerks? Coles describes her dis
tress that students, whose rooms she cleans to
make money, refrain from saying “please” or
“thank you” and behave crudely and disre
spectfully towards her. How can it be that
those whom America considers its best and
brightest lack the capacity to be good people?
Coles, bothered by this question, decided
that there is indeed a disparity between being
a good student and being a good person. We
all forget this frequently enough on a daily
basis or at least I do. Going to the gym.
wearing new clothes, doing well in class, fol
lowing sports; these all have intrinsic value to
me, but they are also partially motivated by a
desire to make other people like me. If I have
expensive shoes, a six-pack and a 4.0,1 still
may not be a good person, but these charac
teristics can damn sure make up for that.
The decision is simple: I can strive for
moral and personal perfection, or I can get a
tan and wear a flashy shirt. Which choice is
more likely to draw people to me and im
prove my social status? In terms of the out
comes, it seems that being a good person is
overrated. Or at least that is how the logic
goes. This might not be so problematic if it
weren’t for the fact that the two options be
come confused at some point. Investing in
my “resume” of appearances and achieve
ments is eventually not looked at as a substi
tute for being a good person, but is rather
viewed as equivalent to being a good person.
Coles, in struggling with this problem,
posits an interesting notion: moral reasoning
is not to be equated with moral conduct. This
is a huge bummer for me personally because
it means I can no longer continue to pass my
self off as a good person. But the implications
apply across the board. We may be captains
and presidents, attractive and accomplished,
but that only makes us good at those things ; it
does not necessarily make us good at being

people.
Such abstract armchair reasoning and
speculative thought doesn’t really mean much
until applied to our daily lives. The point here
is not that we should abandon our pursuits of
self-improvement and abandon our life objec
tives. The central, relevant, unconventional
idea here is that we should not allow ourselves
to be deceived into thinking that the personal
attributes we value so much make us “good”
people. I'll probably continue to stay in shape,
work hard in class and buy nice clothes, but
when people compliment me on these things,
I’ll try to remember that they're compliment
ing me on being good at the things themselves,
not on being a good person. That is because
being talented and working hard at something
ultimately does not excuse me for failing to be
adequate as a person.
What does it mean to have a valuable
character? What does this ephemeral, amor
phous notion of being “good” really imply? I
have no idea my bad. I hope nobody was
reading this waiting for the answer. But we
need to teach ourselves that at the end of the
day, going to Stanford does not necessarily
mean that we are good people, just smart
people. Maybe, in all honesty, being a good
person is overrated it sure doesn’t guaran
tee you a job or land you an attractive spouse
but whatever it is, it cannot be equated to
your resume. Maybe we should strive to
teach ourselves that. Theodore Roosevelt
(some guy, I think he was president) once
said, “To educate a man in mind, and not in
morals, is to educate a menace to society.”
Maybe Teddy is being a little melodramatic,
but he has a point.

Roosevelt also advocated killing nine out of 10
Native Americans, so I would take his personal
philosophy with a grain of salt. Just saying.
