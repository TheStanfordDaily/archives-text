## EARLY ERRORS Cardinal pitching struggles, offense records four hits in loss to USF 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
The No. 19 Stanford baseball team (12-7) played
host to visiting San Francisco (13-13) Monday night at
the Sunken Diamond. The team was looking to contin
ue the clutch hitting and solid pitching that had given it
the 2-1 weekend series victory over USC (12-12). In
stead Stanford looked like a team playing its fourth day
in a row, getting into trouble early, making errors defen
sively and stranding runners on the bases. The Cardinal
offense was limited to just four hits in the 5-1 loss.
The Cardinal found itself in trouble early. Freshman

starter Chris Jenkins got chased for the loss after just
two batters, giving up a walk to San Francisco’s leadoff
batter before throwing away the ball on a sacrifice bunt.
Junior reliever Danny Sandbrink replaced Jenkins but
fared no better, giving up a two-run double to Derek
Poppert followed by a home run to Stephen Yarrow.
Sandbrink gave up another double before Stanford fi
nally recorded its first out by retiring the sixth batter on
a sacrifice bunt. Sandbrink got the next two outs, but by
then the damage had been done. Stanford found itself
in a 4-0 hole after just a half an inning.

The No. 19 Stanford baseball team lost yesterday to the University of San Francisco Dons, 5-1. The Cardinal struggled to find its offensive rhythm against the
University of San Francisco. As a team, Stanford recorded only four hits and the Cardinal pitchers let in five runs early on as they struggled with control.
Asked about the possibility that
part of his team’s play might be due to
fatigue, Cardinal head coach Mark
Marquess refused to let his players off
the hook.
“I might be tired. But they should
n’t be. Twenty year olds don’t get
tired, do they?” he said.
San Francisco starting pitcher Jor
dan Remer looked to continue his
fine season, having given up only one
earned run over nine innings in four
appearances. Stanford went three up,
three down in the first, grounding into
a double play to end the inning.
Sandbrink settled down, retiring
all three batters in a row to end the
top of the second, but Stanford once
again went down in order to end the
second.
Defensive play continued to hurt
the Cardinal in the third, as Poppert
stretched a single to three bases on an
uncharacteristic error by Stanford
center fielder Jake Stewart. It was his
first in 18 starts. Yarrow cashed in the
run for his third RBI of the game.
It would prove to be San Francis
co’s last run of the game, as the Cardi
nal relievers went into lockdown
mode. Scott Snodgress, Dean McAr

die, Chris Reed, Mark Appel and
Garrett Hughes combined to pitch six
innings of shutout ball, allowing just
two hits while collecting 10 strikeouts.
It was a promising sign for a team that
has struggled with pitching at times
this season.
In particular, the freshman McAr
dle turned in an excellent perform
ance, the best of his young career with
the Card. McArdle racked up a ca
reer-high six strikeouts while allow
ing just one hit and one walk in three
scoreless innings.
“I felt good,” McArdle said after
the game. “I hadn’t thrown for a few
days. After I got through the first in
ning, I settled down.”
Remer finally surrendered his first
hit with two outs in the third inning, a
single past the sprawling San Francis
co second baseman off the bat of
Stewart.
The Cardinal threatened to score
for the first time in the top of the
fourth. Remer began to lose control,
walking the first two Cardinal batters
on nine pitches, but got freshman
Stephen Piscotty to ground into a
double play on a full count. Stanford’s
solid plate discipline continued as
senior Adam Gaylord drew the third
walk of the inning. Freshman Kenny
Diekroeger singled in freshman Tyler
Gaffney for his 13th RBI of the sea
son, chasing Remer off the mound in
the process. Stanford almost scored

three more runs as sophomore desig
nated hitter Christian Griffiths hit a
pitch from San Francisco reliever
Haden Hinkle deep to left field, but it
fell just short of the wall and was
caught, ending the inning.
Junior Colin Walsh and Gaffney
drew back-to-back two-out walks for
Stanford in the fifth. The next batter,
junior catcher Ben Clowe, hit the ball
hard, but right at left fielder Jared
Denham to end the inning.
Later on, Kaskow collected Stan
ford’s third hit and first extra base-hit
in the bottom of the seventh with a
standup double. Stanford once again
picked up back-to-back two-out
walks from Walsh and Gaffney to
load the bases. The free pass was
Gaffney’s fourth of the game. But
once again, San Francisco escaped the
jam as Clowe popped up to first base.
Piscotty led off the bottom of the
eighth with a single to left, Stanford’s
fourth hit of the night, but the next
three batters were quietly retired.
“We left a lot of people on base,”
mused Marquees.
In the end, the Cardinal couldn’t
make up for its slow start and 10 men
left on base, dropping the game 5-1.
Up next for the Cardinal is a three
game road series against No. 2 UCLA
starting Thursday.

walks from Walsh and Gaffney to
load the bases. The free pass was
Gaffney’s fourth of the game. But
once again, San Francisco escaped the
jam as Clowe popped up to first base.
Piscotty led off the bottom of the
eighth with a single to left, Stanford’s
fourth hit of the night, but the next
three batters were quietly retired.
“We left a lot of people on base,”
mused Marquees.
In the end, the Cardinal couldn’t
make up for its slow start and 10 men
left on base, dropping the game 5-1.
Up next for the Cardinal is a three
game road series against No. 2 UCLA
starting Thursday.
