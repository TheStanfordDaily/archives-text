## EARLY ERRORS Cardinal pitching struggles, offense records four hits in loss to USF 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
The No. 19 Stanford baseball team (12-7) played
host to visiting San Francisco (13-13) Monday night at
the Sunken Diamond. The team was looking to contin
ue the clutch hitting and solid pitching that had given it
the 2-1 weekend series victory over USC (12-12). In
stead Stanford looked like a team playing its fourth day
in a row, getting into trouble early, making errors defen
sively and stranding runners on the bases. The Cardinal
offense was limited to just four hits in the 5-1 loss.
The Cardinal found itself in trouble early. Freshman

starter Chris Jenkins got chased for the loss after just
two batters, giving up a walk to San Franciscoâ€™s leadoff
batter before throwing away the ball on a sacrifice bunt.
Junior reliever Danny Sandbrink replaced Jenkins but
fared no better, giving up a two-run double to Derek
Poppert followed by a home run to Stephen Yarrow.
Sandbrink gave up another double before Stanford fi
nally recorded its first out by retiring the sixth batter on
a sacrifice bunt. Sandbrink got the next two outs, but by
then the damage had been done. Stanford found itself
in a 4-0 hole after just a half an inning.
