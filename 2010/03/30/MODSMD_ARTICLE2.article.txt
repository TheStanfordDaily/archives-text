## Card makes Final Four on buzzer-beater 
### TOM TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women’s basketball team is on its
way to the Final Four in San Antonio on Sunday
after scraping past Xavier in a 55-53 win in the Sacra
mento Regional Final.
After 40 minutes of play, there was only one per
son and one play that could separate the two teams.
Junior guard Jeanette Pohlen’s last gasp layup as the
clock hit 0.0 won the game for the Cardinal and sent
Stanford to its third straight Final Four.
Staying narrowly ahead of the Musketeers (30-4,
14-0 Atlantic-10) for most of the contest, the Card
(35-1,18-0 Pac-10) dropped behind with two min
utes still to play. Standout senior center Jayne Appel
had fouled out and the team was struggling to deal
with the size of its opposition.
When Xavier senior guard Dee Dee Jernigan
stole the ball from junior forward Kayla Pedersen
with 41 seconds remaining, Stanford had to throw
caution to the wind. Redshirt senior guard Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude fouled Musketeers junior guard Spe
cial Jennings, an 84-percent free throw shooter, to
send her to the charity stripe. Jennings missed the
front end of the ensuing one-and-one and the Cardi

nal rebounded her miss, allowing Pedersen to hit a
jumper and tie the game off an assist from Pohlen.
However, the Musketeers just had to convert on
their possession and looked certain to do this when
the ball was passed into Jernigan for a simple layup
from under the hoop.
She missed, Xavier rebounded and she got the
ball again for a wide-open layup. She missed again.
Pedersen grabbed the rebound with seven sec
onds on the clock, and head coach Tara VanDerveer
called a timeout.
With just 4.4 seconds left and the teams tied at 53,
the game looked almost certain to go to overtime.
But then Pohlen ran the length of the court, straight
through the Xavier defense, and released the ball
with 0.1 seconds on the clock.
“I think in that situation it was either win it or go
to overtime,” VanDerveer said. “At first I thought
we’d take a time out, and then I said, ‘No, hell, just
give her the ball and go to the basket.’”
The ball fell through the basket. Game over.
Stanford won, and for that remarkable final play
Pohlen was named Player of the Game.
“I’m really excited for Jeanette,” VanDerveer

said. “She just stayed with it and
played the whole game and made the
big play.”
Pohlen played every minute of the
contest, but was only 1-5 on her trade
mark three-pointers and scored just
six points. Her teammates Pedersen
and sophomore forward Nnemkadi
Ogwumike both recorded double
doubles with 18 points and 10 re
bounds, and 16 points and 14 re
bounds, respectively. Were it not for
that final play, Pedersen would proba
bly have been the most important
Stanford player last night.
She looked fired up and time and
again put her body on the line, diving
to keep balls in or to contest a jump
ball. Her teammates looked station
ary, though, as the Cardinal was miss
ing its slick, accurate passing and the
fluid movement that has characterized
it all year.
Through much of the game Xavier
managed to beat Stanford in the paint,
leading 38-28 in points scored there
and frustrating the Cardinal defense.
Instead of playing man-to-man, the
Card had to put extra players on the
Musketeer forwards and Appel strug
gled to make her presence felt, getting
into foul trouble early in the game.
At times, Stanford’s usually strong
shooting percentage was well down,
and Xavier finished ahead on this sta
tistic 38 percent to 35 percent. What
hurt the Musketeers in the second pe

riod, though, was going 1-14 on three
points. With the score stuck at 41-40
for three and a half minutes, Xavier
lost possession on several attempts
from outside the arc and could not
make Stanford pay for its own inaccu
racy.
The Musketeers may have only
been a No. 3 seed, but as the No. 5 team
in the nation, they could certainly have
argued for a much better seeding. Last
night they showed why. Redshirt jun
ior forward Amber Harris led all play
ers with 20 points, and though all three
starting forwards were in foul trouble
from early on in the second period,
they did not let up.
“I just want to congratulate
Xavier,” VanDerveer said. “What a
great game. You know it’s really hard
for either team to lose that game. You
know we battled. We did not play well,
but we battled.”
After three comfortable victories
in the opening rounds, this should
come as a wakeup call for the No. 1
seed. Stanford cannot afford to play
like that if it hopes to take the crown
from undefeated No. 1 Connecticut.
But the most important thing was
the win. The Cardinal’s hopes for a
third NCAA title are still alive.
“So we’re going to the Final Four,”
VanDerveer said, “and I’m very excit
ed.”
Stanford now heads to the Alam
odome in San Antonio this Sunday to
face the winner of the Kansas City Re
gional Final, either No. 4 seed Ken
tucky or No. 3 seed Oklahoma.

Junior forward Kayla Pedersen battles Xavier's Amber Harris and Dee Dee Jernigan for a rebound during Stanford's 55-53 victory. Pedersen and sophomore
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike combined for 34 points and 24 rebounds to help Stanford overcome poor shooting and advance to the Final Four.
said. “She just stayed with it and
played the whole game and made the
big play.”
Pohlen played every minute of the
contest, but was only 1-5 on her trade
mark three-pointers and scored just
six points. Her teammates Pedersen
and sophomore forward Nnemkadi
Ogwumike both recorded double
doubles with 18 points and 10 re
bounds, and 16 points and 14 re
bounds, respectively. Were it not for
that final play, Pedersen would proba
bly have been the most important
Stanford player last night.
She looked fired up and time and
again put her body on the line, diving
to keep balls in or to contest a jump
ball. Her teammates looked station
ary, though, as the Cardinal was miss
ing its slick, accurate passing and the
fluid movement that has characterized
it all year.
Through much of the game Xavier
managed to beat Stanford in the paint,
leading 38-28 in points scored there
and frustrating the Cardinal defense.
Instead of playing man-to-man, the
Card had to put extra players on the
Musketeer forwards and Appel strug
gled to make her presence felt, getting
into foul trouble early in the game.
At times, Stanford’s usually strong
shooting percentage was well down,
and Xavier finished ahead on this sta
tistic 38 percent to 35 percent. What
hurt the Musketeers in the second pe

riod, though, was going 1-14 on three
points. With the score stuck at 41-40
for three and a half minutes, Xavier
lost possession on several attempts
from outside the arc and could not
make Stanford pay for its own inaccu
racy.
The Musketeers may have only
been a No. 3 seed, but as the No. 5 team
in the nation, they could certainly have
argued for a much better seeding. Last
night they showed why. Redshirt jun
ior forward Amber Harris led all play
ers with 20 points, and though all three
starting forwards were in foul trouble
from early on in the second period,
they did not let up.
“I just want to congratulate
Xavier,” VanDerveer said. “What a
great game. You know it’s really hard
for either team to lose that game. You
know we battled. We did not play well,
but we battled.”
After three comfortable victories
in the opening rounds, this should
come as a wakeup call for the No. 1
seed. Stanford cannot afford to play
like that if it hopes to take the crown
from undefeated No. 1 Connecticut.
But the most important thing was
the win. The Cardinal’s hopes for a
third NCAA title are still alive.
“So we’re going to the Final Four,”
VanDerveer said, “and I’m very excit
ed.”
Stanford now heads to the Alam
odome in San Antonio this Sunday to
face the winner of the Kansas City Re
gional Final, either No. 4 seed Ken
tucky or No. 3 seed Oklahoma.
