## Card makes Final Four on buzzer-beater 
### TOM TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women’s basketball team is on its
way to the Final Four in San Antonio on Sunday
after scraping past Xavier in a 55-53 win in the Sacra
mento Regional Final.
After 40 minutes of play, there was only one per
son and one play that could separate the two teams.
Junior guard Jeanette Pohlen’s last gasp layup as the
clock hit 0.0 won the game for the Cardinal and sent
Stanford to its third straight Final Four.
Staying narrowly ahead of the Musketeers (30-4,
14-0 Atlantic-10) for most of the contest, the Card
(35-1,18-0 Pac-10) dropped behind with two min
utes still to play. Standout senior center Jayne Appel
had fouled out and the team was struggling to deal
with the size of its opposition.
When Xavier senior guard Dee Dee Jernigan
stole the ball from junior forward Kayla Pedersen
with 41 seconds remaining, Stanford had to throw
caution to the wind. Redshirt senior guard Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude fouled Musketeers junior guard Spe
cial Jennings, an 84-percent free throw shooter, to
send her to the charity stripe. Jennings missed the
front end of the ensuing one-and-one and the Cardi

nal rebounded her miss, allowing Pedersen to hit a
jumper and tie the game off an assist from Pohlen.
However, the Musketeers just had to convert on
their possession and looked certain to do this when
the ball was passed into Jernigan for a simple layup
from under the hoop.
She missed, Xavier rebounded and she got the
ball again for a wide-open layup. She missed again.
Pedersen grabbed the rebound with seven sec
onds on the clock, and head coach Tara VanDerveer
called a timeout.
With just 4.4 seconds left and the teams tied at 53,
the game looked almost certain to go to overtime.
But then Pohlen ran the length of the court, straight
through the Xavier defense, and released the ball
with 0.1 seconds on the clock.
“I think in that situation it was either win it or go
to overtime,” VanDerveer said. “At first I thought
we’d take a time out, and then I said, ‘No, hell, just
give her the ball and go to the basket.’”
The ball fell through the basket. Game over.
Stanford won, and for that remarkable final play
Pohlen was named Player of the Game.
“I’m really excited for Jeanette,” VanDerveer
