## Fencing Secures Funding 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Nearly one year ago, the Stanford fencing team’s future
was nothing short of dire. Now, after months of painstak
ing fundraising efforts and one miraculous donation, the
program has new life.
On Monday, the Stanford Fencing Association, former
ly named Save Stanford Fencing, announced in front of a
select crowd of fencers, coaches, community members and
donors that the team had received a $1.25 million dona
tion from alumnus Jimi Jung ‘O4 of Korea, allowing the
team to remain a varsity sport for at least four more years.
The money will cover operating costs while the team at
tempts to create a $5 million-$8 million endowment.
“It's shocking,” said sophomore sabre Suraya Omar.
“It’s amazingly generous. I cannot get over how apprecia
tive we are. I feel this will be a lot of motivation for us to be
really successful in the next few years.”
“I'm stunned,” added Melody Lowman, former Save
Stanford Fencing chair and mother of senior sabre Chris
Lowman. “I'm overjoyed. Eleven and a half months ago, it
seemed like we might not be able to do it. But this has been
just a fabulous committee and everybody has worked in
credibly hard.”
Jung, the CEO and founder of Lourus & Education
Co.. Lourus Sports Management Company and Lourus
Fencing Club, was greeted by boisterous cheers and ap
plause from the small crowd upon his announcement. He
said that he made the donation in part because he felt it
was away he could “give back to the younger genera
tions.”
Prior to Jung’s donation, the situation surrounding the
fencing program was ominous. Approximately 11.5
months ago, Stanford Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby
alerted the team that it would be cut if it could not raise the
operating cost, $250,000, for the 2009-10 season as well as
demonstrate sufficient progress in creating an endow
ment.
While the team can now return its focus to fencing with
high spirits, many members of the program, including head
coach Lisa Milgram, recalled just how dismal the situation
had appeared.
“In the beginning of this, I was wondering where I
would coach next,” Milgram said. “It was a herculean task
that was given to us. Jimi’s gift now extends that opportu
nity for us to come up with an endowment and gives us a
little bit of room to breathe.”
When asked if she felt the team would be able to main
tain its optimism and raise enough money to create an en
dowment. Milgram was quick to respond.
“Absolutely," she said. “I absolutely believe that that’s
going to happen. While I may have been worried at the be
ginning, I now believe wholeheartedly that $8 million will
be inherited.”
