# STREAKING TO VICTORY
## 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
A few weeks of rest reenergized the
Stanford women’s tennis team (13-1,2-
0 Pac-10) and allowed it to continue its
six-match winning streak, recording its
first official Pac-10 wins in a sweep of
the Arizona schools.
The team came roaring back from
finals break with a 6-1 victory over Cal
Poly (12-3). Doubles was closely con
tested before Stanford broke away to
make the match a rout. A surprise
showing by Cal Poly’s top doubles duo

of Brittany Blalock and Suzie
Matzenauer led to an upset of Stan
ford’s No. 2 nationally-ranked junior
Hilary Barte and senior Lindsay Bur
dette. This was their first home loss as a
team since Mar. 7,2009.
“You always have to give the other
person credit,” said head coach Lele
Forood on the early struggles. “It’s hard
to get going again. You can hit fine, but
it’s about playing matches well in the
end.”
A second victory came when the
Cardinal defeated No. 51 Pepperdine
(6-11) by the same score of 6-1 to start

a three-match road swing. Singles
turned in a dominating performance as
Stanford won five matches in straight
sets. Freshman Mallory Burdette now
leads the team with 22 victories after
picking up her latest one with a 6-2,6-0
victory at the No. 4 spot. Barte contin
ued her 15-match winning streak by de
feating No. 81 Arianna Colffer 6-1,6-0.
“Everybody in stride stepped up to
the challenge/’ said senior captain
Lindsay Burdette. “It was one of those

The Cardinal, led by the No. 2 ranked duo of Lindsay Burdette and Hilary Barte, is currently on a six match win streak.
getting through that set point [against
us] helps us get a little bit better just
from one match.”
Lindsay Burdette shook off two re
cent defeats and toughed out a three
set win over No. 78 Kelcy McKenna 4-
6, 7-5,6-2 to lead Stanford to its first
official Pac-10 win over No. 23 Ari
zona State (11-3,3-1 Pac-10). Stanford
swept the doubles to go up 1-0. The
team experienced a setback, losing at
the No. 5 spot when No. 85 Carolyn
McVeigh was upset, but won the re
maining four matches to coast to vic
tory.
“By the time we got to ASU, we
had obviously played Cal Poly and
Pepperdine,” Forood said. “It was im
portant to get those matches, but that
is the beauty of scheduling. You can
set up matches where you play who
you need to play at that point in the
season.”
Next up was Arizona (10-6, 1-4
Pac-10), the No. 55 team in the nation.
The Cardinal again dominated in dou
bles, sweeping all three matches, and
used that momentum to post a 6-1 vic
tory. Stanford clinched the match be
fore Arizona was able to record its
first individual victory. That victory
came at the expense of Lindsay Bur
dette, who lost a 6-4, 6-2 decision to
Sarah Landsman.
“Us being super positive and im
posing our game on them was really
important in the win,” Lindsay Bur
dette said. “It was super windy and the
courts were a lot slower so we had
longer points and they got more balls
back, but we just stayed super positive
and pretty loud during the doubles es
pecially.”
One worrying trend since spring
break has been the struggles of Lind
say Burdette. She has lost three of her
last four matches after winning seven
of nine in dual match play before Mar.
6. These losses include a 4-6,6-1, (10-0)
upset by Cal Poly’s Brittany Blalock
and a straight sets 6-2,7-5 defeat at the
hands of Pepperdine’s Anamika
Bhargava.
“Being aggressive, I try to hit the
ball pretty big and come into the net,”
Lindsay Burdette said. “When you’re
just a little bit off, it’s trouble. Some
people who are baseliners, they have
less that could go wrong. I think I’ll be
right on track after working on a few

bad habits that I’ve picked up. It’s just
having to compete straight out of
break that’s so tough.”
Overall, the team is looking good
at this point in the season. None of its
wins have been closer than 5-2.
Against opponents ranked in the top
60. Stanford is 9-1 this season. When
they are playing well, the women can
handle anyone, as shown by their
upset of then-No. 5 Cal 5-2.
“The team is maturing quickly at
this point,” Forood said of her team’s
progress. “That’s a big piece of it.
WeTe finally growing as a group.”
The Cardinal now looks to focus
almost exclusively on its Pac-10 oppo
nents. The team puts its record 158-
match home winning streak on the
line as it welcomes back USC and
UCLA. So far, the Cardinal’s only loss
came at the hands of UCLA back on
Feb. 26. Stanford will be eager to
prove itself and avenge its lone defeat
this year.

you need to play at that point in the
season.”
Next up was Arizona (10-6, 1-4
Pac-10), the No. 55 team in the nation.
The Cardinal again dominated in dou
bles, sweeping all three matches, and
used that momentum to post a 6-1 vic
tory. Stanford clinched the match be
fore Arizona was able to record its
first individual victory. That victory
came at the expense of Lindsay Bur
dette, who lost a 6-4, 6-2 decision to
Sarah Landsman.
“Us being super positive and im
posing our game on them was really
important in the win,” Lindsay Bur
dette said. “It was super windy and the
courts were a lot slower so we had
longer points and they got more balls
back, but we just stayed super positive
and pretty loud during the doubles es
pecially.”
One worrying trend since spring
break has been the struggles of Lind
say Burdette. She has lost three of her
last four matches after winning seven
of nine in dual match play before Mar.
6. These losses include a 4-6,6-1, (10-0)
upset by Cal Poly’s Brittany Blalock
and a straight sets 6-2,7-5 defeat at the
hands of Pepperdine’s Anamika
Bhargava.
“Being aggressive, I try to hit the
ball pretty big and come into the net,”
Lindsay Burdette said. “When you’re
just a little bit off, it’s trouble. Some
people who are baseliners, they have
less that could go wrong. I think I’ll be
right on track after working on a few

bad habits that I’ve picked up. It’s just
having to compete straight out of
break that’s so tough.”
Overall, the team is looking good
at this point in the season. None of its
wins have been closer than 5-2.
Against opponents ranked in the top
60. Stanford is 9-1 this season. When
they are playing well, the women can
handle anyone, as shown by their
upset of then-No. 5 Cal 5-2.
“The team is maturing quickly at
this point,” Forood said of her team’s
progress. “That’s a big piece of it.
WeTe finally growing as a group.”
The Cardinal now looks to focus
almost exclusively on its Pac-10 oppo
nents. The team puts its record 158-
match home winning streak on the
line as it welcomes back USC and
UCLA. So far, the Cardinal’s only loss
came at the hands of UCLA back on
Feb. 26. Stanford will be eager to
prove itself and avenge its lone defeat
this year.
