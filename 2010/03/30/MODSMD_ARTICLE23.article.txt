## Cardinal finishes fourth at Nationals 
### CHRIS DERRICK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a tumultuous week in
Columbus, Ohio for the men’s swim
ming and diving team, capping a sea
son that has seen its share of setbacks
and triumphs. When the dust finally
settled on Sunday night, senior Eu
gene Godsoe and sophomore Chad
La Tourette were NCAA champions,
but the setbacks that seemed to plague
the Cardinal men all season also
thwarted their bid for a team title. The
men finished fourth behind Texas, Cal
ifornia and Arizona still a top-level
performance, but well back from their
hopes of claiming the NCAA title.
Problems for the team began in
January when NCAA 100-yard but
terfly champion Austin Staab, a soph
omore, took a leave of absence from
the University. Even after losing top
senior diver Dwight Dumais along
with Staab and losing a dual meet to
Arizona, the Cardinal was able to re
bound and win its 29th consecutive
Pac-10 championship in convincing
fashion. The hits kept coming, howev
er, and the men were in for a nasty sur
prise in Columbus.
Upon arriving at the meet, the
three top-ranked teams that shared an
airline flight, Stanford, Texas and Ari
zona, had a number of athletes come
down sick with stomach problems. At
least five Stanford athletes had to go
the hospital and the issue was severe
enough for the NCAA to postpone
the meet by one day.
As a result of the virus, the Cardi
nal got out of the gates slowly. On the
first day, Stanford scored only two All-
Americans in the 500-yard freestyle,
an event in which seven Cardinal ath
letes qualified. Junior David Mosko
was fourth while sophomore Chad La
Tourette was 11th. The Cardinal also
had a number of declared false starts,
including sophomores Bobby Bollier
and Robert Andrews in the 500-yard
freestyle and freshman Matt Thomp

son in the 200-yard individual medley.
Senior David Dunford and junior
Alex Coville both fought off the ef
fects of the virus to make the final of
the 50-yard freestyle. A valiant fourth
place effort in the 200-yard freestyle
relay before the final, however,
drained them as they came in seventh
and eighth.
However, there were some bright
spots for the Cardinal as Godsoe
kicked off his stellar meet by setting a
school record of 44.93 seconds in the
100-yard backstroke on the opening
leg of the 400-yard medley relay which
finished third. Lovelace, Bollier and
Andrews joined Godsoe on that All-
American relay team.
Godsoe again led on the second
day of competition as he scored in
three events. He led off the 200-yard
medley relay, which finished fourth,
and then took third in the 100-yard
butterfly. To cap it off, he won his best
event, the 100-yard backstroke, by
over a second for his first NCAA
championship.
After winning the title, Godsoe
spoke to collegeswimming.com.
“I had confidence going into the
walls and I just kept pushing and push
ing into them,” he said. “We have a
strong last day so I hope this win is a
springboard for us.”
Also earning All-American hon
ors and scoring for the Cardinal on the
second day were Lovelace and junior
John Criste, who took seventh and
eighth in the 100-yard breaststroke, re
spectively. Andrews took 15th in the
200-yard freestyle and the, 800-yard
freestyle relay team took seventh.
Just as Godsoe had hoped, the final
day was the high note for Stanford: the
men scored the most points of any
team on the final day to move into
fourth place. La Tourette led off the ac
tion by winning his first NCAA title in
the 1650-yard freestyle by six seconds.
He was undefeated in the event this
