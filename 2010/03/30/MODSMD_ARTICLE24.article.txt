# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Card take top spot in conference 
### CAROLINE CASELLI ZACH ZIMMERMAN 
Playing its first league matches in almost three
weeks, the No. 1 Stanford men’s volleyball team deft
ly handled two Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) opponents this past weekend. The Cardinal
played both games on the road and not only main
tained its place at the top of the national rankings, but
also found itself alone in first in the MPSF.
On Friday, Stanford (15-4,12-4 MPSF) took on
No. 14 UC-San Diego (8-15,4-12) in La Jolla, playing
its first game on the road since being voted No. 1.
UCSD’s home court advantage proved no match for
the Cardinal, who trailed only briefly in the first set
and swept the Tritons 30-18,30-12,30-20.
The Cardinal offense was nearly flawless, with the
team hitting a season-high .527. Senior opposite
Evan Romero and sophomore outside hitter Brad
Lawson finished the match with 12 kills and only two
errors apiece while junior outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin added nine kills with no errors for the
night.
The Card shone defensively as well, out-blocking
the Tritons 12 to 3.5. Senior middle blocker Garrett
Werner contributed seven blocks, and senior setter
Kawika Shoji added three, in addition to his 33 assists
and six digs. Frank Fritsch led the way for the Tritons
with 11 kills, but recorded seven errors and a subpar
hitting percentage of .174.
Lawson attributed the team’s mistake-free style
of play, particularly its stellar hitting, to “patience,
maturity and intelligence.”
“Over this entire season, our team has demon
strated patience when attacking the ball and it has
paid off time and again,” he said. “We’ve hit over .400
in a number of matches, and I think
this can be attributed to a presence of
mind that we have developed to not
have to put the ball away on every
swing. When the set isn’t there or our
timing is off, we’ve learned to keep the
ball in and rely on our defense to gen
erate transition opportunities.”
Following its success on Friday,
Stanford put its seven-game winning
streak on the line against No. 9 Long
Beach State (12-11,8-8) on Saturday.
The Cardinal effortlessly dispatched
the 49ers in straight sets, 30-28,30-22,
30-21, breaking a tie with Pepperdine
for first place in the MPSF standings.
“I think one way to avoid a let
down is to remind ourselves of the
goals that we set during the fall and at
the outset of the season,” Lawson
said. “Before we had even played a
match, we made it our objective to win
the MPSF regular season and to peak
as the postseason approached, and if
we keep these two goals in mind, I
think we’ll be reminded to stay moti
vated and focused for the final month
of our season.”
Romero and Lawson again led the
way for Stanford, notching 18 kills
apiece while accurately piloting the
Card to .420 hitting on the night.
McLachlin and Wemer also chipped
in offensively with seven and six kills,
respectively. Stanford only recorded

13 hitting errors in the match, yielding
a phenomenal two-match error total
of 19.
While the Cardinal quickly found
its offensive groove. Long Beach State
struggled mightily against Stanford's
dominant frontline. Senior opposite
Dean Bittner led the 49ers with 15
kills, and senior setter Conor Eaton
recorded 37 assists.
Sophomore middle blocker Gus
Ellis continued his dominant play in
the middle, recording three of the
Card’s seven blocks. Stanford man
aged to hold its opponent to just .183
hitting and used its length to force 22
errors. Sophomore libero Erik Shoji
added 15 digs, bringing his season dig
total to 209.
However, the Cardinal did strug
gle in one area this weekend: serving.
In each match, the team tallied 14 er
rors with only three aces.
“I expect us to take a bunch of
serving reps in practice to help us get
back into our serving routines,” Law
son said.“l also think visualization will
come into play. Sometimes your tim
ing just gets a little off and you miss an
uncharacteristic number of serves,

and I think we just need to recalibrate
physically and mentally.”
By no means is the squad resting
comfortably on top.The Cardinal recog
nizes how important and challeng
ing the remainder of its season is.
“We have one of the toughest
schedules left in the conference,”
Lawson said. “But I believe that if we
keep playing the consistent type of
volleyball that we are currently play
ing, we have a good chance of securing
first place in the MPSF and making a
serious run at the national title. It will
be important to get back to our pre
season goals of peaking late and fo
cusing down the stretch, which I think
our team can do.”
Up next for Stanford is a two
match road trip against Cal State
Northridge and UC-Santa Barbara.
With just six games remaining, the
Cardinal will look to secure the No. 1
seed in the MPSF tournament and
continue its run toward the NCAA
Championships here on The Farm.

In each match, the team tallied 14 er
rors with only three aces.
“I expect us to take a bunch of
serving reps in practice to help us get
back into our serving routines,” Law
son said.“l also think visualization will
come into play. Sometimes your tim
ing just gets a little off and you miss an
uncharacteristic number of serves,

and I think we just need to recalibrate
physically and mentally.”
By no means is the squad resting
comfortably on top.The Cardinal recog
nizes how important and challeng
ing the remainder of its season is.
“We have one of the toughest
schedules left in the conference,”
Lawson said. “But I believe that if we
keep playing the consistent type of
volleyball that we are currently play
ing, we have a good chance of securing
first place in the MPSF and making a
serious run at the national title. It will
be important to get back to our pre
season goals of peaking late and fo
cusing down the stretch, which I think
our team can do.”
Up next for Stanford is a two
match road trip against Cal State
Northridge and UC-Santa Barbara.
With just six games remaining, the
Cardinal will look to secure the No. 1
seed in the MPSF tournament and
continue its run toward the NCAA
Championships here on The Farm.
