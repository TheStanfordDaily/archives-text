# MEN'S TENNIS
## Rested Card beats three ranked opponents 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After stumbling out of the gate, the
Stanford men’s tennis team finally
seems to be firing on all cylinders.
The No. 15 Cardinal will look to ex
tend a season-best five-match winning
streak this afternoon against No. 8 Bay
lor at the Taube Family Tennis Center.
The team was inactive for two weeks

during finals but showed no signs of rust
during an impressive Midwest road trip.
Stanford took down No. 11 Illinois in a
hard-fought 4-3 match and cruised 5-2
against No. 28 Michigan in Ann Arbor.
“It’s hard to say if taking a few weeks
off helped us,’’ said top singles player
sophomore Bradley Klahn,“but we def
initely seemed rejuvenated.”
Regardless, Stanford came home
with two of its best wins of the season

and a newfound sense of confidence.
A big part of the team’s turnaround
can be attributed to the recent play of
Denis Lin. The freshman has been on a
tear ever since he was inserted into the
singles lineup three weeks ago against
Utah.
Lin has won four straight singles
matches after spending the early part of
the season as a doubles specialist.
“It’s definitely nice to be able to play

singles and put some points on the
board,” Lin said.
“My energy level has been really
good and I’m feeling pretty confident in
my game right now,” continued the
freshman. “I just need to focus on stay
ing more consistent.”
Stanford flew home from Michigan
on Friday and had to quickly prepare for
its first Pac-10 match of the year
against No. 32 Arizona. The Cardi
nal’s losses against Cal and USC in
February will not count towards the
conference standings.
Stanford swept all three doubles
matches against the Wildcats to
take a 1-0 lead which it would never
relinquish. The Cardinal has cap
tured the doubles point in 11 of its
13 matches so far this season.
Head coach John Whitlinger is
quick to assert that securing the
doubles point is essential to winning
close matches against top competi
tion and the statistics back him up.
Stanford is 10-1 this year when it
wins the doubles point and 0-2 when
it doesn’t.
“Doubles has definitely been
one of our strong points this year,”
said Klahn, who plays No. 1 doubles
with fellow sophomore Ryan
Thacher. “I think the key is that we
found partners early on that worked
well and we’ve stuck with them.”
Senior Richard Wire and junior
Alex Clayton have been dominant
at times as the second doubles team.
The pair won 26 points in a row
against UNC-Wilmington.
Freshman Matt Kandath and Lin
hold down the third doubles spot.
Klahn, Hirshman and Thacher
all won their matches in straight sets
to clinch the Arizona match.
Stanford’s only blemish was No.
35 Alex Clayton’s loss to Arizona’s
Andres Arrange in the second sin
gles match, 6-3, 6-3. Lin and senior
Richard Wire pulled out three-set
victories to put the emphasis on a
breezy 6-1 victory for the Cardinal.
Today, Stanford and Baylor
square off in the fourth annual HP
Cup, a home-and-home series
showcasing a battle between two
teams that are usually in the hunt
for the national title come May.
Hewlett Packard Company’s
CEO Mark Hurd was a letter win
ner on the Baylor tennis team dur
ing the 19705.
Stanford tennis has a sour histo
ry with Baylor, having lost all nine
matches it has played against Bay

lor dating back to 1999, including
two losses in the NCAA Tourna
ment.
No. 10 Baylor upset No. 4 Stan
ford 4-3 last year in the HP Cup in
Waco, Texas. Stanford senior Blake
Muller was upset by then-freshman
Maros Horny, 6-7,6-4,6-2 in the de
ciding match.
“We left feeling like it was a
match we could have won and

should have won,” Klahn said.
“That match definitely makes you
want to lay it all out there and get a
victory.”
Stanford will try to maintain its
current hot streak today against
Baylor at 3 p.m. at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.
