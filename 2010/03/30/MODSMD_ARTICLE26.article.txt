## Card places sixth in Texas 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women’s golf team shot a total of 909 after
three rounds of golf to finish sixth out of 18 teams at the Betsy
Rawls Longhorn Invitational in Austin, Texas last weekend.
This was the first time all team members were present to play
in a tournament. It was also everyone’s first time playing the
UT golf course, including the upperclassmen.
UCLA took the top score with an 884, while Arizona
placed second at 890. Texas A&M finished seven stokes
clear of Arizona with an 897, and TCU placed fourth at 901.
Stanford was just two shots shy of the tournament host
Texas Longhorns, who placed fifth with a score of 907. The
Cardinal faltered down the home stretch with double and
triple bogeys, which allowed the Longhorns to slip ahead.
Stanford was in ninth place after shooting a 302 on the
first day of the tournament and moved up to sixth place with
a 300. Arizona and UCLA were neck-in-neck going into the
last round on the last day, but UCLA won out by six strokes
in the end.Third place Texas A&M also put pressure on sec
ond place Arizona with the help of Sarah Zwartynski, who
won the individual title with a 54-hole score of 213.
Stanford freshman Kristina Wong carded an even-par 72
and a one-under 71 the first two days. She was two shots be
hind the lead going into the last round, but fell to fifth after
shooting a final round 78. She finished eight strokes behind
Zwartynski.
“The highlight of the tournament for me was watching
Kristina hole out from the fairway on the 15th hole on the
second day of the tournament for an eagle,” said senior An-

gela King.
Freshman Sally Watson procured Stanford’s lowest
score in the final round with a three-over-par 75. Watson tied
for 29th place with a total of 230. King was close behind with
a 231 to tie for 33rd while Durham carded a 77 in the last
round to tie for 39th with 233 (17 over par). Durham sank an
80-foot birdie putt on the last day. Cardinal sophomore Syd
ney Burlison scored a 241 to tie for 71st and fellow classmate
Lila Barton carded a 242 to tie for 73rd.
“I enjoyed the enthusiasm and support our team showed
for each other,” Durham said. “The person behind was al
ways cheering, clapping and motivating the person ahead of
them, no matter how they were playing. We were a little
rusty going into this tournament and didn’t play to our po
tential, but it was nice to see how supportive our team was
of each other.”
Next, the Cardinal women will move on to the PING
Arizona State Invitational at the Karsten Golf Course in
Tempe on April 9.
“I expect the playing conditions of the PING to be simi
lar to that of Texas,” King said. “It’s a desert-style course and
generally very windy. I’m looking forward to some great
competition.”
“The course is difficult but fair,” Durham said. “The
scores are generally low. Most importantly this tournament
is going to have a very strong field and we are expecting to
go out and contend with the top teams. It will be good prepa
ration for Regionals and Nationals. We’ll be ready to go for
championship season.”
