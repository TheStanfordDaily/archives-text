## Researchers find multiple sclerosis breakthrough 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford researchers published findings on
Sunday indicating that there are two types of
multiple sclerosis (MS) that respond differ
ently to the most common drugs used today.
These findings could have clinical applica
tions for personalizing the current treatments
for MS.
MS is an autoimmune disease in which T
cells attack the myelin sheaths surrounding
neurons, causing loss of nerve function over
time. The disease affects 400,000 people in the
United States and 2.5 million worldwide.
Beta-interferon is one of the most popular
treatments for MS. It has not, however, been
uniformly effective. Almost a third of users

suffer from intense flu-like side effects that for
some are intolerable, and some patients do
not improve with the treatment.
Stanford researchers led by Lawrence
Steinman, a professor of neurology and neu
rological sciences at the School of Medicine,
wanted to find out why.
The study, published in Nature Medicine,
used mouse models of MS to examine the ef
fects of beta-interferon on two different T-cell
models. Steinman discovered that beta-inter
feron improves the conditions of mice whose
MS was caused by gamma-interferon-produc
ing T-cells. However, it worsens the condition
of mice whose MS is caused by IL-17-produc
ing T-cells.
