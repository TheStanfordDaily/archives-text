## Researchers find multiple sclerosis breakthrough 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford researchers published findings on
Sunday indicating that there are two types of
multiple sclerosis (MS) that respond differ
ently to the most common drugs used today.
These findings could have clinical applica
tions for personalizing the current treatments
for MS.
MS is an autoimmune disease in which T
cells attack the myelin sheaths surrounding
neurons, causing loss of nerve function over
time. The disease affects 400,000 people in the
United States and 2.5 million worldwide.
Beta-interferon is one of the most popular
treatments for MS. It has not, however, been
uniformly effective. Almost a third of users

suffer from intense flu-like side effects that for
some are intolerable, and some patients do
not improve with the treatment.
Stanford researchers led by Lawrence
Steinman, a professor of neurology and neu
rological sciences at the School of Medicine,
wanted to find out why.
The study, published in Nature Medicine,
used mouse models of MS to examine the ef
fects of beta-interferon on two different T-cell
models. Steinman discovered that beta-inter
feron improves the conditions of mice whose
MS was caused by gamma-interferon-produc
ing T-cells. However, it worsens the condition
of mice whose MS is caused by IL-17-produc
ing T-cells.
To determine whether or not the
findings in the mouse model might
be the same in humans, blood sam
ples from 26 patients were sent to
Stanford from collaborators in Am
sterdam. The researchers, unaware
of which patients responded to beta
interferon, screened the blood for
levels of IL-17.
“[The results] were completely
congruent with what we saw in the
mouse [model],” Steinman said.
Indeed, those patients with ele
vated IL-17 levels responded poorly
to beta-interferon therapy.
The findings point to two differ
ent types of MS: one caused by Type

1 T-cells that secrete gamma-inter
feron, and one caused by Type 17 T
cells that secrete IL-17.
Beta-interferon is an effective
therapy for gamma-interferon MS,
but not for IL-17-induced MS. A
simple blood test could determine
the patient’s type of MS, based on
the level of IL-17 present.
“[The blood test] could be done
as soon as we validate [the findings]
in a larger cohort,” Steinman said.
“Once validated, the test is very
straightforward; it could be imple
mented quite easily.”
Steinman plans to continue with
a large cohort study to validate the
results found in the mouse model
and initial human screening. If the
large group study supports these
findings, the blood test for IL-17
could be used to determine a pa
tient’s course of treatment and max

imize the likelihood that the pre
scribed drug would control their
MS.
“I think this has the potential to
transform the way we take care of
people with multiple sclerosis,”
Steinman said in a news release.
“The other side of the coin is that
beta-interferon, if it’s given only to
those who are predisposed to re
spond to it, could turn out to be a far
better drug than we ever imagined.”
Beta-interferon could be admin
istered in a less diluted form to those
patients who are predisposed to re
spond well. In addition, a different
drug called Copaxone could be ad
ministered to those patients with
high IL-17.
“[lt] turns out we know where
Copaxone will work best as we 11...
but we haven’t published it yet,”
Steinman said.
These findings could lead to a
more personalized treatment
process for MS, beginning with a
blood test before drugs are pre
scribed. Steinman plans to pursue
future possibilities for simple tests
to improve treatment both for
MS and other diseases.
“In the future [we] should do a
test before we just prescribe some
thing,” Steinman said. “There needs
to be a lot more money being spent
on figuring these things out.”
In addition, these findings could
help to better allocate money spent
on MS prescription drugs. Currently,
beta-interferon is made by four dif
ferent companies and is a $4 billion
industry. Copaxone production is
also a $3 billion industry.
By personalizing drug treatment,
Steinman pointed out that money
could be saved on ineffective pre
scription of drugs and in treatment
of their unnecessary side effects.
The study was co-authored by
many other Stanford researchers,
researchers from the University of
Alabama at Birmingham and re
searchers in the Netherlands.
