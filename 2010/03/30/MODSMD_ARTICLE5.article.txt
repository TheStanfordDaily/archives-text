# Ethics of medicine
## Med school introducecs new policy 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI STAFF WRITER 
The School of Medicine made an offi
cial extension to its ethics policy on
March 15, prohibiting its 660 adjunct clin
ical faculty from delivering paid speeches
prepared by drug companies and the
makers of medical devices.
The new policy change is a modifica
tion to the Stanford Industry Interactions
Policy (SUP), which was first enacted in
October 2006 to articulate ethical stan
dards for how employees, staff and volun
teers should interact with pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies and med
ical device manufacturers.
Volunteer teaching staff with Stanford
titles, commonly called adjunct clinical
faculty, were previously exempt from the
policy to avoid interference with their pri
vate practices.
In order to continue using their Stan
ford titles, adjunct faculty now must com
ply with many of the same policies that
apply to full-time faculty. Adjunct faculty
are now prohibited from ghostwriting,
engaging in speakers’ bureaus and ac
cepting gifts or meals from industry part
ners. They will also be prohibited from ac

cepting free drug samples starting Jan. 1,
2011.
According to School of Medicine
Dean Philipp Pizzo, the School of Medi
cine’s policies on conflict of interest and
industry relations are “among if not the
[sic] most comprehensive in the nation,”
he wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
“In the beginning we were trying not
to intrude in that regard,” said David
Stevenson, senior associate dean for aca
demic affairs. “It became clear that that
exception was not one that could be
maintained.”
According to Stevenson, the policy
change has been discussed for “many
months” and was prompted by increasing
concerns about how industry and finan
cial incentives influenced physicians’ re
sponsibility to prioritize patient care.
Pizzo explained that when the SIIP
was formed in 2006, the School of Medi
cine excluded adjunct faculty from the
ban on speakers’ bureaus because it did
n’t envision problems arising with ad
junct faculty in the future.
“In honesty, I for one [sic] did not
think that any adjunct clinical faculty
member would be members of In
dustry Speakers Bureaus or earning
large sums of money based on these
activities,” Pizzo said.
A key consideration in modifying
the policy was the fact that adjunct fac
ulty commonly identify themselves
with Stanford on Web sites, business
cards and other contexts outside of the
University.
Harry Greenberg, senior associate
dean of research and training, said
that misunderstandings can occur
when the public doesn’t differentiate
between employed faculty of the
School of Medicine and volunteer fac
ulty who use their Stanford titles in ex
ternal settings.
“The public and the press really
don't understand, when someone has a
title that says ‘Stanford Professor of
Medicine Adjunct,’ that that person is
spending most of their time in private
practice,” Greenberg said. “They are
looked upon as Stanford faculty.”
Stevenson said that companies
would not be putting money into
speakers’ bureaus and gifts to physi
cians if it weren’t yielding a return in
sales on drugs and devices.
“The slide sets prepared by com

panics are basically a marketing tool,
which is different from presenting
original work,” Stevenson said. “The
role of speakers’ bureaus is to change
the clinical habits of physicians. That
isn't consistent with policy at Stanford
University.”
Stevenson emphasized that the
physicians must prioritize what is in the
best interest of their patients and not
what would benefit the stockholders of
a particular company or yield personal
financial gain.
The School of Medicine felt an
added pressure to revise its industrial
relations policy after a New York
Tunes article last year noted that Stan
ford adjunct Manoj Waikar earned al
most $75,000 from the drug maker Eli
Lilly in a six-month period through
paid speaking engagements.
As Greenberg put it, the distinction
between Waikar’s title and that of an
employed Stanford professor “doesn't
make much sense to the outside
world.”
The new policy is largely an effort
to protect the reputation of the Uni
versity.
“I do not make any value judg
ments about the activities that commu
nity physicians wish to pursue, nor do
we want to regulate them,” Pizzo said.
“However, if that community physi
cian has a Stanford title, as an adjunct
clinical professor, it is clear that we
must protect the reputation of Stan

ford Medicine and the University.”
Pizzo, Stevenson and Greenberg all
took care to assert that the University
appreciates the time, knowledge and
experience that volunteer staff bring to
teaching students and that the policy
extension is in no way meant to deter
volunteers from assuming adjunct fac
ulty roles.
“The adjunct clinical faculty are
very important to us,” Greenberg said.
“They donate their time and their ef
forts and they have lots to add to this in
stitution. The purpose was not at all to
diminish numbers of adjunct clinical
faculty.”
Stevenson said although some ad
junct faculty are “not happy,” the deci
sion to assume that position is volun
tary. If faculty do not wish to accept the
new policy, they can opt out of their
staff roles.
“I think that most [adjunct facul
ty] will find this to be not difficult at
all,” Stevenson said.
Greenberg summarized the logic
behind the policy change.
“We made a decision that faculty
at Stanford are academics, and that
means that their work is based on
their own scholarship,” he said. “A
Stanford title to promote the mar
keting efforts of a drug company just
didn’t seem appropriate.”
