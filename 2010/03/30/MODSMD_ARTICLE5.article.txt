# Ethics of medicine
## Med school introducecs new policy 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI STAFF WRITER 
The School of Medicine made an offi
cial extension to its ethics policy on
March 15, prohibiting its 660 adjunct clin
ical faculty from delivering paid speeches
prepared by drug companies and the
makers of medical devices.
The new policy change is a modifica
tion to the Stanford Industry Interactions
Policy (SUP), which was first enacted in
October 2006 to articulate ethical stan
dards for how employees, staff and volun
teers should interact with pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies and med
ical device manufacturers.
Volunteer teaching staff with Stanford
titles, commonly called adjunct clinical
faculty, were previously exempt from the
policy to avoid interference with their pri

In order to continue using their Stan
ford titles, adjunct faculty now must com

are now prohibited from ghostwriting,
engaging in speakers’ bureaus and ac
cepting gifts or meals from industry part
ners. They will also be prohibited from ac

cepting free drug samples starting Jan. 1,
2011.
According to School of Medicine
Dean Philipp Pizzo, the School of Medi
cine’s policies on conflict of interest and
industry relations are “among if not the

he wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
“In the beginning we were trying not
to intrude in that regard,” said David
Stevenson, senior associate dean for aca
demic affairs. “It became clear that that
exception was not one that could be
maintained.”
According to Stevenson, the policy
change has been discussed for “many
months” and was prompted by increasing
concerns about how industry and finan
cial incentives influenced physicians’ re
sponsibility to prioritize patient care.
Pizzo explained that when the SIIP
was formed in 2006, the School of Medi
cine excluded adjunct faculty from the
ban on speakers’ bureaus because it did
n’t envision problems arising with ad
junct faculty in the future.
“In honesty, I for one [sic] did not
think that any adjunct clinical faculty
