## Google leaves China based search service 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Following a week of anxious specula
tion, the jury is still out on the political and
economic ramifications of Google’s deci
sion last Monday to close its search service
in China. Google has redirected its Chinese
Web users to an uncensored search engine
situated in Hong Kong for the past week.
This development comes after the Inter
net giant said that it was one of at least 20
corporate victims in a sophisticated cyber
attack originating in China last year.
Google also experienced tensions with
China due to government censorship is
sues.
In January, Google announced on its
blog, “These attacks and the surveillance
they have uncovered combined with the
attempts over the past year to further limit
free speech on the web have led us to
conclude that we should review the feasibil

ity of our business operations in China.”
These stumbling blocks led the compa
ny to stop censoring results on its Chinese
Web site, Google.cn, earlier this year and,
more recently, to shut down the site in
China.
While Google’s business in China com
prises a small fraction of the company’s an
nual net profit some experts estimate
one to two percent it is possible that the
company will face more profound econom
ic effects in the long run.
Google spokespeople did not return re
quests from The Daily for comment.
Stanford visiting fellow Duncan Clark
and sociology professor Xueguang Zhou,
both of the Freeman Spogli Institute for In
ternational Studies (FSI), shared their
opinions on Google’s move via e-mail.
“Google exits China at a critical junc
ture as China moves onto the world stage
and as Google is gaining momentum
in the Chinese Internet market,”
Zhou said. “I am afraid this will cost
Google dearly in the long run. as it
takes time and experience to rebuild
the customer base, relative to other
competitors.”
An expert on China’s Internet
policies, Clark said the closing of the
site is likely to impact three areas:
search business, commercial activities
and partnerships, and research and
development.
Though Chinese Web users are still

able to access Google through the
Hong Kong host site, Clark speculated
that the Chinese government could
disable routing to that domain if it so
desired. Such an action would impact
the “commercial viability of the site.”
According to Clark, another con
cern is that Google’s move could have
a detrimental impact on its Android
mobile phone platform.
“No company can win globally in
mobile devices or OS without being
strong in China ... we have yet to see
how much government will punish
Google in this area,” Clark said.
But China does not want to drive
out Google hires in research and de
velopment, Clark added. The Google
partnership has been a valuable
source of jobs in China.

But business is not the only issue
on the table; critics and proponents
alike have focused on the political
repercussions of Google’s new posi
tion.
“By taking a stance on freedom of
information, Google certainly gains
politically in those markets outside
China,” Zhou said. “However, this ap
proach may inadvertently impede po
litical development in China as the ed
ucated are more likely to be the advo
cates for freedom of information and
use Google to communicate and
transmit information. Google’s exit
will be especial painful for them.”
“It just gives the West a reminder
that the rise of China isn’t correlated
—at least so far with increased
transparency and pluralism in the po
litical arena,” Clark added.
For human rights activists likeTen
zin Seldon T2, Google’s decision is
blessing in disguise. Seldon, who
works for Students for a Free Tibet,
discovered that her Gmail account
was infiltrated by Chinese hackers last
year.
“I applaud Google for sticking to
its decision to not censor informa
tion,” Seldon said. “This is a great vic
tory on their part... I think this will
be a huge precedent for other compa
nies in America.”
“We live in an age of globalization
where the Internet is the key to how
we interact with one another,” Seldon
said.
Like Zhou, Seldon acknowledged
that the move to shut down Google’s
search engine in China may have a
negative impact on Chinese political
dissidents who already find it difficult
to access information from outside
the country.
However, for Seldon, the long-run
benefits of this development out
weigh the costs.
“I think eventually they will find
other avenues and this will just bring a
new awakening within the dissidents
who will then, I think, mobilize the
people to stand up against the govern
ment,” Seldon said of activists based
in China.
“From my point of view and from
the point of view of activists, we be
lieve that if Google wants to do busi
ness in China, it cannot censor infor
mation,” Seldon said. “And if it wants
to comply with Chinese laws, then it
should not stay there.”
