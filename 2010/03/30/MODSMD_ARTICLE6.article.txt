## Google leaves China based search service 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Following a week of anxious specula
tion, the jury is still out on the political and
economic ramifications of Google’s deci
sion last Monday to close its search service
in China. Google has redirected its Chinese
Web users to an uncensored search engine
situated in Hong Kong for the past week.
This development comes after the Inter
net giant said that it was one of at least 20
corporate victims in a sophisticated cyber
attack originating in China last year.
Google also experienced tensions with
China due to government censorship is
sues.
In January, Google announced on its
blog, “These attacks and the surveillance
they have uncovered combined with the
attempts over the past year to further limit
free speech on the web have led us to
conclude that we should review the feasibil

ity of our business operations in China.”
These stumbling blocks led the compa
ny to stop censoring results on its Chinese
Web site, Google.cn, earlier this year and,
more recently, to shut down the site in
China.
While Google’s business in China com
prises a small fraction of the company’s an
nual net profit some experts estimate
one to two percent it is possible that the
company will face more profound econom
ic effects in the long run.
Google spokespeople did not return re
quests from The Daily for comment.
Stanford visiting fellow Duncan Clark
and sociology professor Xueguang Zhou,
both of the Freeman Spogli Institute for In
ternational Studies (FSI), shared their
opinions on Google’s move via e-mail.
