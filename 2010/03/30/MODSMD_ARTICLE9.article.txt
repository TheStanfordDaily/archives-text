## BREAKING POINT ASBs explore some of today's most troublesome issues 
### STEPHANIELIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Friday afternoon a dozen students sprawled out on
towels, enjoying the sun and sand at a beach in LA.
Some were tanning, others texting and plugged into
iPods. To the casual observer, they probably looked like
any other group of crazy college kids, having fun at the
beach, talking and laughing, partying and doing what college kids
do on spring break.
But not quite.
Earlier that day, these students had shadowed physicians and
observed several operations, including a gastric bypass surgery.
And their conversation was about socioeconomic disparities in
healthcare, sharing reflections and frustrations after a weeklong
service-learning trip as one of Stanford’s 13 Alternative Spring
Break (ASB) programs this year.
“After working on this for the past nine months. Eve read a
lot, but the most learning came from actually going on the trip,”
said Matthew Anderson Tl, one of the leaders of “The
Emergency Room is Closed: Exploring Socioeconomic
Disparities in Los Angeles Hospitals.” “This was the first time I
really put myself into the shoes of a doctor.”
During the trip, a group of 14 students visited numerous
healthcare facilities, including free clinics and both nonprofit and
for-profit hospitals, where they spoke with physicians and admin
istrators. For the students, many of whom are pre-med, it was an
eye-opening experience that helped them develop a deeper
understanding of how the healthcare system works and does
n’t work.
“I came on the trip with much more naive ideas about what it
means to be a doctor,” said Divya Nag T3.
Through ASB, students were exposed to the business of
healthcare, including insurance, taxation and hospital manage
ment. The trip was especially pertinent due to the recent passing
of healthcare reform legislation, and participants were able to
speak with practitioners currently in the field about how reform
will affect them.
“I always concentrated on the doctor-patient interaction and
wasn’t aware of system-wide issues, but the whole system is so
dysfunctional, out of date and even a bit ridiculous,” said Justin
Lam T3.
A day at Neighborhood Legal Services, a free legal services
provider, also gave students the opportunity to assist patients
struggling with medical debt.
“You can’t fix everything, but you can still create impact,” said
Andy Nguyen T2, who hopes to integrate his interests in health
policy and law with medicine. “Regardless of where I end up,
when dealing with people, one of the most important things is
treating people with dignity.”
For Yvom Aswad Tl, the other co-leader, a big draw of the
trip was its location, which brought him home to urban L. A.
“This system is broken because of balancing people’s Wants
how do you figure out whose wants are greater?” Aswad
asked. Students visited his high school, the King/Drew Magnet
High School of Medicine and Science, and observed efforts to
encourage education and pursuit of health careers in an under
served community rife with poverty and gangs. Special programs
allow high school students to shadow and volunteer with various
health professionals, and administrators have carried on despite
setbacks such as the closure of a local hospital.
“Education is really important,” said Emily Young ‘l2, anoth
er graduate of King/Drew who was on the trip. “The situation is
not unfixable, but it will require cooperation.”
This is now the 23rd year that ASB has been providing

Stanford students with unique spring break experiences, and
everything from trip coordination to leader selection is student
run. For many who are especially passionate about a particular
social issue, leading an ASB was the perfect way to further their
own understanding while sharing their passions with other stu
dents.
“Over the work I’ve done in HIV/AIDS throughout my
undergraduate career, I’ve experienced in the Stanford commu
nity a lot of complacency, ivory tower distance and ignorance,”
said Crystal Zheng TO, who was one of the leaders of “Silence is
Death: Interdisciplinary' Perspectives on HIV/AIDS in San
Francisco.” “I led the trip because I wanted to expose students to
the very real impacts of HIV/AIDS on a community only 30
minutes north of us.”
Trip leaders apply the spring of the previous year, are inter
viewed for suitability and then take a preparatory course in fall
quarter with the Haas Center before teaching another course in
winter quarter once trip participants have been selected. The
Haas Center also assists with coordinating alumni relations,
which have proved invaluable due to the wealth of connections
to numerous organizations and diverse fields. Some trips also
received help from alumni when it came to housing.
ASB is funded by Associated Students of Stanford
University (ASSU) special fees as well as a small participant fee,
- although financial aid is available. ASB also offers small grants
of $5OO for participants to encourage further service once the
week is over.
Two-year program director Christopher Khavarian TO has
been involved with ASB since freshman year and was a partici
pant and trip leader of trips to New Orleans in the aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina.
“The greatest things about ASB are the people students
are so passionate, and the energy is electrifying,” said Khavarian,
who stresses the uniqueness of the learning aspects of ASB trips.
“It really is one of the most impactful programs on campus.
Understanding an issue from the bottom up makes the service
more meaningful to the students and to the people affected.”
“It’s not just service, but service-learning,” said fellow coordi
nator Indu Premakumar TO, who has also been through the
whole spectrum of ASB involvement. “Learning about things we
don’t think about too much.”
Many students on the trips found their worldviews changed
by the experience, or their idealism re-kindled.

“I’ve always been skeptical of people who say I’m going to
change the world,” admitted Justin Lee ‘l3. But after participat
ing in “Social Entrepreneurship in the Bay Area,” meeting entre
preneurs— including the founders of Kiva.org and volun
teering with startups focused on tutoring underprivileged stu
dents, his position is wavering.
“Intense immersion for one week into this lifestyle I real
ized that social entrepreneurship is not just a field or a vocation,
it’s a lifestyle, away of living.”
Vin Nie Ong ‘l3 agreed. As part of the “Food for Thought”
ASB, she learned all about sustainable agriculture and organic
farms.
“We actually farmed planted potatoes, lettuce and peas
collected eggs from chicken coops... it was really tiring, but I
appreciate my food more, think about where it comes from and
will try harder to get my vegetables from farmers’ markets in the
future,” Ong said. “It was a break I’ll never forget a lot of fun,
and also much more productive than lying around watching
movies or TV!”
Vineet Singal ‘l2, who has written for The Daily, participated
in “A Veteran’s Affair; In Pursuit of Health Care” in Washington,
D.C last year, and was inspired to lead the trip this year. Besides
volunteering at an army medical center and a homeless shelter,
students spoke with Bob Filner, Chairman of the House
Committee on Veterans' Affairs, to understand current health
legislation. Singal’s involvement with ASB has also inspired him
to pursue epilepsy research after learning about the injuries that
many veterans sustain which can lead to the disorder.
“ASB really linked together my interests, and has been a cat
alyst for my on- and off-campus activities and academic life,”
Singal said. He and his co-leader also volunteer at the nearby VA
Hospital and are involved in other groups relating to veterans’
health.
More than anything else, ASB brought students together and
thrust them out of the Stanford bubble, taking learning to a
whole new level.
New friends, new mentors, new passions and new inspiration
to start off Spring Quarter: it’s amazing what you can do in just
seven days.
