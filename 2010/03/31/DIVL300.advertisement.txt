. â€¢ a
Join us for rhe seventh annual evening recital with the
much-beloved Ben Simon, as he and two San Francisco
Chamber Orchestra all-stars - violinist Kay Stern,
concertmaster of rhe San Francisco Opera Orchestra,
and Michelle Djokic, cellist of Quartet San Francisco and
the New Century Chamber Orchestra - perform a brilliant
string trio version of one of Bach's greatest masterpieces,
The Goldberg Variations. Known to be Bach's only
set of variations, this gorgeously intricate composition was
dedicated to Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, Bach's dear friend,
who needed a piece of music to help put his insomniac master,
Count Keyserlingk, to sleep at night. Our program will include
a presentation on Bach's life and music, and is designed to
unravel some of the mystery behind The Goldberg Variations
and increase your understanding and enjoyment of this
complex and beautiful piece of music.
