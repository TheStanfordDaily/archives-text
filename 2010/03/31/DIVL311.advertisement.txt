The Universal Church is today...is more definitely set against the
World than at any time since pagan Rome...The World is trying
the experiment of attempting to form a civilized but non-Chris
tian mentality. The experiment will fail; but we must be very
patient in awaiting its collapse; meanwhile redeeming the time;
so that the Faith may be preserved alive through the dark ages
before us; to renew and rebuild civilization, and save the World
from suicide.
