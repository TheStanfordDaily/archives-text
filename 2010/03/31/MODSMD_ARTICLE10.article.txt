## Mixed responses to mixed-race option on census forms 
### BRIAN NA PANG STAFF WRITER 
The 2010 census, which hit mail
boxes this month, is causing schol
ars and mixed-race people to
debate, for just the second time in
the count's history, the dilemma of
whether or not to check multiple
"race" boxes.
One Stanford professor,
Michele Elam, the director of the
Program in African and African-
American Studies, wrote in a
recent op-ed in The Huffington
Post that people should consider
"thinking twice, but checking
once," since the goal of the census
is to diagnose the resources the
federal government should offer.
Elam said that the question of
whether or not to check more than
one box is not about meeting some
level of "mixedness."
"[The question is] a recognition
that 'race' is and has always been a
broad political category that has
had and continues to have real
impacts," Elam wrote in e-mail to
The Daily, "and most important, in
this context, is being invoked to
help track inequities based on race
and to distribute economic
resources."
Matthew Snipp, the director of
the Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity program, also com
mented on the effects of checking
more than one box. According to
Snipp, who has been involved in
the census since the 1980s, census
data is used to allocate $4OO billion
per year.
Snipp said information collect
ed about racial categories is used to
guard civil rights. The Voting
Rights Act of 1965 aimed for
minorities to have fair representa
tion in congressional districts.
"Race is important in determin
ing whether congressional districts
have been racially gerrymandered
or not," Snipp said.

He cited an instance of how
racial composition can affect the
gerrymandering of an area.
"For example, if there was an
area that was predominantly
Latino, lines can be drawn so that
the community can elect a Latino
congressman," Snipp said.
"However, [lines] can also be
drawn so that it makes it nearly
impossible for the people to elect a
Latino representative."
As determined by the
Department of Justice in the 2000
Census, if one were considered a
member of a protected minority
group and also a majority group,
then for civil rights enforcement
purposes, the person is counted as
the minority.
"If you were black and white
and you checked both boxes,"
Snipp said, "then you're just
black."
Protected minority groups are
defined as any group that has been
historically discriminated against.
The primary groups are Asian-
Americans, Latinos, African-
Americans, American Indians and
Alaska natives, Snipp said.
Debate arises, however, as more
people of two different minority
races emerge.
"For example, if you're trying to
draw a legislative district and it has
a large concentration of Hispanics,
Asians and half-Hispanic and half-
Asian people, then how do you
count those?"
"It's a rare thing and it's never
been a problem in the past, but
going into the future it might be,"
he added.
Drawing boundaries may be
harder than ever. In the case of try
ing to achieve racial balance within
a district, it may be hard to deter
mine which category mixed race
people should belong.
Lisa James 'l3, who is from
Monroe, Mass., and checks both
the African-American and

Caucasian boxes, noted her own
dilemma. According to her, it may
not be the best option to just
choose one, as Elam had suggest
ed, since she identifies with both
ethnicities.
"At home, because I live in a
predominantly white community,
people just consider me white," she
said. "But coming here, I didn't
realize how much society is going
to also look at me and just be like,
'You're black,' even though I'm
both."
Currently, the Census allows
people to determine for them
selves to which race they identify.
"Race is so much more compli
cated than just a box," said
Michaela Raikes 'lO, a
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity major. "That's the hard
part of the census. It means a lot of
different things to a lot of people.
It's hard to just check one box and
understand that that's representing
who you are."
Snipp said people should be
check as many boxes as they
choose, as long as they realize the
policy implications of the decision.
Elam acknowledged the contro
versy between generations of the
"mixed race movement," between
interracial parents whose mar
riages were first legal in the United
States in 1967 after Loving v.
Virginia and their "now-grown"
children, who don't always agree
on how to represent mixed race.
But Elam remained firm in her
beliefs to "think twice, but check
once."
"If we wring our hands in onto
logical angst over the 'Gee, what
am I?' and, 'Why can't my own
complexities be represented here?'
questions," she said, "then we
[miss] the larger practical aims of
the census."
