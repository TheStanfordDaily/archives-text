## EDITORIAL Texas school board cuts out Jefferson, distorts history 
### 
The Texas State Board of Education
handed right-wing extremists a land
mark victory in advancing its political
agenda this month. Only this time, the board's
decision applied not just to the oft-attacked
science of evolution or global warming, but
rather to a much broader target: history. To
combat its perceptions of liberal bias in the
field of education, the board mandated a list of
specific changes to social studies textbooks
changes that will likely transform the curricu
lum of all states due to Texas' large share of the
textbook market.
In making these major changes, the school
board felt no need to consult a single histori
an, economist or sociologist, relying instead
on their own self-appointed "expertise," For
Cynthia Dunbar, one member of the board,
this consisted of penning a book entitled
"One Nation Under God," that called public
education "clearly tyrannical" and "a decep
tive tool of perversion." In further open scorn
of scholarship, a fellow board member, Don
McLeroy, proclaimed, "Somebody's got to
stand up to the experts."
With such defiant opposition to expertise,
the flabbergasting historical inaccuracy of
their prescriptions comes as no surprise. From
the implication that unregulated free markets
never fail not even in 1929 or 2008 to a
positive portrayal of Joseph McCarthy as a de
fender of American liberty, the Editorial
Board could literally fill this newspaper from
front to back with criticisms of this absurd ver
sion of history.
In the interest of conciseness, we limit our
selves to our personal favorite example: re
moving Thomas Jefferson from the list of
thinkers that influenced the nation's origins.
Those of us with the faintest background in ed
ucation might recall that Jefferson wrote the
Declaration of Independence. But since Jeffer
son's deism does not fit in with the conserva
tive narrative of a nation founded on Christian
beliefs, Texas textbooks must replace him with
religious figures such as St. Thomas Aquinas
and John Calvin. Jefferson's term, "separation
of church and state," on which the Supreme

Court has ruled more than 25 times, will not be
mentioned. And the author of our nation's in
dependence will no longer be considered a
Founding Father.
This revisionist attempt to exclude Jeffer
son is only the beginning of the school board's
discrimination. After unsuccessful attempts to
remove mention of Thurgood Marshall, the
first black Supreme Court Justice, the board
decided to call Confederate leaders Jefferson
Davis and Stonewall Jackson role models of
"effective leadership." The board diminished
Hispanics by eliminating the Tejanos who died
alongside Davey Crockett at the Alamo, and
showed contempt for gays and feminists by el
evating the historical role of Phyllis Schafly,
whose anti-gay and anti-feminist rhetoric
could well be considered hate speech. One
member confirmed the intentions of the board
by complaining about the "overrepresentation
of minorities" in the traditional portrayal of
American history. These amendments were
not even sincere attempts to represent an al
ternate version of events, but rather a blatant,
racially-motivated power-grab.
The pettiness in the changes went even fur
ther. Country and western music were added
to the nation's list of important cultural move
ments while hip-hop were removed from the
same list. The term "democratic" republic got
changed to "constitutional" republic just to
avoid the term democrat.
The hypocrisy of these conservative ac
tivists is astounding in this massive intrusion
of government. Teaching history will no
longer be up to teachers. Writing history will
no longer be up to academics. Instead, the
whole process will be controlled by the same
type of politically-motivated government bu
reaucrats these small-government activists
claim to deplore. And in their unilateral, am
ateurishly conceived decrees on what exactly
constitutes the truth, the brainwashing this
school board seeks to impose on the Ameri
can population is downright Orwellian. The
Editorial Board hopes that the American
people will not swallow this bitter pill from
Texas without a fight.
