# GET IT RIGHT
## The 						Healthcare "Rage" 
### Erica Morgan 
The 219-212 vote last Sunday on health
care reform may have, as Mr. Obama
phrased it, answered "the call of history."
History has certainly seen its share of usurpa
tion and tyranny. However, it is unlikely that
the passage of the bill answered the call of the
Americans it will impact. Rasmussen Reports
polls reveal that as Obamacare's champions
headed to vote on Sunday, 54 percent of polled
voters opposed the plan and 45 percent polled
strongly opposed the plan. Yet, despite majori
ty opposition and transparent political wheel
ing and dealing, Obama and the Democrats in
the House managed to pull the bill through. Im
mediate tumult followed the bill's passage: 14
attorneys general have filed suit against the
government on the basis of the unconstitution
ality of this reform. Republican leaders are at
tempting to gain momentum to repeal health
care reform and are inciting voters to display
their displeasure in the upcoming elections.
Considering the costs and benefits of the re
form, it is not difficult to discern where the main
points of contention arise, which is why I was
surprised to discover a New York Times article
the other day entitled "The Rage Is Not About
Health Care."Nonplussed (I had been thinking
the rage was all about health care) I read fur
ther, seeking enlightenment. And how, you ask,
does columnist Frank Rich account for such
raging Republican fury? In the same way that
liberals traditionally respond to opposition
when they fail to find substantive counter-argu
ments: by blaming the angry white men.
According to Rich, "If Obama's first legisla
tive priority had been immigration or financial
reform or climate change, we would have seen
the same trajectory." Angry, racist, sexist and
homophobic Republicans cannot handle the
"conjunction of a black president and a female
speaker of the House topped off by a wise
Latina on the Supreme Court and a powerful
gay Congressional committee chairman," and
therefore would have demonstrated the
"tsunami" of "illogical" anger over any legisla
tion advanced by diverse government leaders.
Maniacal chants of "Kill the Bill" reveal the
homicidal lust of reform opponents as shouts of
"baby killer" to Congressman Bart Stupak and
"You Lie" to Obama indicate "small-scale
mimicry of Kristallnacht."
I am struck by the irony that liberals are out
raged by accusations of socialism levied at the
president (and here we are moving toward so
cialized health care) and yet feel justified in
comparing conservative political unrest to the
horrifying murder and persecution carried out
by the Nazis. Rich backs his claims of Republi
can racism with evidence such as, "the Republi
cans haven't had a single African-American in

the Senate or the House since 2003 and have
had only three in total since 1935." While cast
ing his aspersions. Rich conveniently ignores
figures such as Michael Steele, the conservative
African American serving as the current chair
man of the Republican National Committee.
Or how about our very own Condoleezza
Rice? An African-American woman who for
merly served in the capacities of both National
Security Advisor and U.S. Secretary of State?
What a bunch of sexist racists these anti-
Healthcare white male supremacists must be!
I am unconvinced by Rich's argument, and I
offer an alternative explanation for discord
over the reform. Fundamentally, this bill is a
mandate for Americans to purchase a product.
Individuals who do not wish to purchase health
care will be penalized for failure to comply with
the new system. One might ask where in the
Constitution such an ordinance is justified, just
as the attorneys general are asking, but instead
of explaining the violation of our founding doc
ument, Democrats such as Frank Rich point to
protestors with accusations of racism and big
otry.
There are, of course, a plethora of other ob
jections to the bill, ranging from a tax on tan
ning salons to the definition of "children" as 26-
year-old dependents to the potential imposi
tion of huge fines on employers. The fact that
the highly politicized issue of abortion was used
as a bargaining chip in the House vote outrages
members of both parties. Forty percent of doc
tors over the age of 55 express concerns that it
may not profitable for them to remain in the
health care business. Many question the bill's
efficacy and express anxiety over giving the
government control over an additional sixth of
the American economy. Still, more worry that
the legislation will stifle the healthcare industry
and lead to the kind of substandard care evi
denced by socialized systems in Europe and
Canada. Take your pick of concerns to ad
dress/debate/discuss, but realize that Republi
can reaction to the health care reform has
everything to do with conservative values
clashing with the elements of the bill (shock
ing!) and stop shifting the focus of the de
bate to alleged racial prejudices.
