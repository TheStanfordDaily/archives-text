# STRANGELY CHARMING
## Green: The New Flying Colors 
### Jack Cackler 
One hundred and six years and 104 days
ago, Orville Wright took off from
Kitty Hawk, N.C., in the world's first
self-powered airplane. In the relatively short
time since then, airplanes have completely
transformed modern society. Many of you
have just returned from spring break, going
home or traveling to far exotic destinations.
The ability to have adventures hundreds and
even thousands of miles away, and then return
in a week, is a luxury only afforded by the con
venience and efficiency of air travel, which is
truly remarkable. Commuting around the
world has greatly accelerated globalization,
expanded opportunities for innovation and
broken down barriers between cultures, in a
way that wouldn't have been possible a hun
dred years ago. In the same way that Leland
Stanford opened up the West Coast through
the Union Pacific Railroad, airlines today are
opening up the world. And so despite my frus
trations with ticket modification fees, security
lines at SFO and basically anything related to
US Airways, the airlines are one of the most
valuable industries to preserving and expand
ing modern society.
Having said that, airlines are a huge con
sumer of fuel and contribute tremendously to
greenhouse emissions. Studies in 2009 stem
ming from a committee to address this issue
estimated airline fuel consumption as 6.3 per
cent of total oil consumption, and contribut
ing to 1.6 percent of total greenhouse emis
sions. And while airplanes in the past 40 years
have become more efficient, rising fuel prices
are placing a serious financial incentive on air
lines to find ways to go farther using less fuel.
Researchers are working on a variety of ways
to address this problem.
One area of great research is into creating
wings that fly using laminar flow, as opposed
to turbulent flow. In a nutshell, when a wing is
coarse or non-aerodynamic, air going over the
wing will buffet and slow the wing down, while
a smooth wing will cut through air like butter.
Picture the wake created by a barge as op
posed to a sailboat. Designing wings to fly in
laminar flow is difficult, but the fuel savings
can be enormous. The Boeing 787, a plane last
that was first test-flown last December, has a
design based largely around laminar flow and
boasts a reduction of 20 percent in fuel con-

sumption.
Another interesting idea developed out of
Dr. Ilan Kroo's lab at Stanford, involves flying
planes in formation flight. Birds fly in iconic V
shaped patterns because drafting off birds
ahead of them saves a considerable amount of
energy in flight. The same is true for large air
planes. Dr. Kroo's team demonstrated a po
tential 15-percent net fuel savings. This plan
could be particularly effective for transocean
ic flights. For instance, planes leaving San
Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego for
Tokyo could meet up partway through the Pa
cific, and fly in formation for the remainder of
the trip.
While the last two methods have focused
on ways to reduce fuel consumption, they still
don't fix the problem of oil consumption en
tirely. Several designers are crafting airplanes

running partially, or entirely, on solar energy.
Solar Impulse is a one-person plane that runs
entirely on solar power. The plane's battery
bank stores energy during the day and can run
off batteries at night. A huge advantage of
solar planes is that planes flying higher than
clouds can always count on sunny days.
Bertrand Piccard, one of the plane's designers,
is planning a transatlantic flight in 2012, and
plans to circumnavigate the globe eventually.
While a fully solar plane would be great,
mature solar technology for full passenger
planes is probably several years off. Flying
planes on biofuels could be a great solution in
the intervening time. Companies like So
lazyme are engineering algae to create
biodiesel, which can then be combusted in a
traditional diesel engine. Virgin Atlantic has
already tested flights using biofuels. Algal re
fineries can be created anywhere, supplying
virtually a limitless source of fuel, which may
soon become economically more efficient
than oil. It is important to note, however, that
while algal-based biofuels may produce fewer
greenhouse emissions than conventional
fuels, they still create emissions. Another de
veloping technology of using algae for power
came from a study published earlier this
month done in part by Prof. Fritz Prinz from
Stanford's Department of Material Science
and Engineering. The team harnessed elec
tricity directly from algal photosynthesis, es
sentially creating a living solar cell.
Flight is an inextricable component of
modern society, a fact that will only become
more pronounced over the coming decades as
modern technology expands to all corners of
the globe. And while flight is a tremendous
gift, it currently comes at an enormous cost to
our planet's health. Greenhouse emissions
from flight can only be alleviated by reducing
passengers or making planes more efficient.
While individuals can reduce their flights, de
mand will grow, so in the long run this will not
solve any problems. Focusing on reducing, and
eventually eliminating, non-renewable fuel
consumption, will allow us to both travel and
protect the planet for years to come.

Jack is looking forward to Spring Break 2030,
where both you and your plane can soak up
rays. Contact him at cackler@stanford.edu.
