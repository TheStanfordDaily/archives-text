## CARD PASSES ROAD TESTS Team handles No. 4 UCLA on trip 
### CLAUDIA LOPEZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's water
polo team was victorious this week
end as it came back to the Farm
from Southern California, maintain
ing a perfect MPSF record. The
team had not traveled for three
weeks, so the double win was a good
sign that the Cardinal is still strong
not only in its home pool, but out on
the road as well. This past Saturday,
the team faced off with UCLA.
The Cardinal started off strong

with a 4-2 lead after the first period.
"I think we did really well with
our defense, and that lead to a good
offense," said sophomore two
meter Annika Dries.
The Cardinal outscored the Bru
ins every period except the fourth,
when both teams smashed two goals
into their respective nets.
Sophomore two-meter Melissa
Seidemann scored an outstanding
four goals. Senior driver Kelly
Eaton, sophomore driver Pallavi
Menon and senior driver Kelsey
Holshouser each skipped in two
goals. Dries tacked on a single goal
as well, while junior goalkeeper
Amber Oland saved an impressive
10 shots from getting into the net.
Stanford finished the game with
an 11-6 victory.

"It was good to go in there and
show them that we could play really
well," Dries said. "I think we did re
ally well on our six-on-fives. We did
better with that than we did in the
past."
The following day, the Cardinal
faced off with Long Beach State.
Stanford began very strong once
again with a 4-0 lead by the end of
the first period. During the second
period, not a single point was scored
by either team. After halftime, Stan
ford dominated its opponent as the
Card scored five points while Long
Beach State only tacked on a single
goal to finish the game at 9-1.
Sophomore driver Cassie Churn
side, junior driver Kim Krueger and
Dries each scored two goals. Sopho
more driver Alyssa Lo, Menon and

Holshouser each skipped in a single
goal of their own. Again, Oland
saved 10 shots.
"We were off shooting-wise,"
Dries said. "I think that we are just
going to have to keep our en
durance up to keep shooting well."
With the MPSF Tournament
starting April 30, the Cardinal needs
to be able to endure many matches
throughout the tournament week
end. With these two victories under
its belt, Stanford demonstrated its
ability to play well outside of the
Avery pool.
The next match will be in Hon
olulu, Hawaii against the University
of Hawaii at 7 p.m. on April 11.
