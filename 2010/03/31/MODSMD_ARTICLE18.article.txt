### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While spring break is a relaxing
time for many Stanford students, the
Cardinal track and field team was
hard at work in both indoor and out
door competition.
The U.S. Track and Field and Cross
Country Association named Stanford
head coach and director of the
track and field program Edrick
Floreal as the Men's West Regional
Coach of the Year the first week of
March. This was Floreal's third time
winning the honor, but first time on
the men's side. Floreal was commend
ed for his success in leading the Stan
ford men to a second place finish at
the MPSF Indoor Championships, as
well as for pushing his athletes to
achieve 16 provisional marks and two
automatic qualifying marks.
After winning this honor, Floreal
had the opportunity to take his group
of elite athletes to Fayette ville, Ark. to
compete in the NCAA Indoor Cham
pionships, with several Cardinal men
and women earning Ail-American
honors.
The Cardinal men were led by jun
ior Elliott Heath, who placed seventh
in the 5,000 meters with a time of
13:51.00, very close to his indoor per
sonal best. Following Heath was jun
ior Jake Riley, who finished 10th with
a time of 13:59.85. From this race,
Heath earned his fourth All-Ameri
can award, while Riley earned his sec
ond.
Earning his first Ail-American
honor was sophomore Dylan Ferris.
He placed eighth in the mile with a
time of 4:04.73 in his first NCAA
Championships. Redshirt junior
Justin Marpole-Bird also earned his
first Ail-American, placing ninth in
the 3,000 meters with a time of
8:16.04. This was also Marpole-Bird's
first NCAA Championships appear
ance.
On the women's side, the All-
America title was provided by sopho
more Katerina Stefanidi, who has
showcased her pole-vaulting prowess

all season long. Stefanidi tied for fifth
in the event, matching her collegiate
best mark of 14-I.2s.This was her first
All-American honor as well.
Although there were definitely
some top performances by Stanford,
they were not enough for Stanford to
place at the championships. Florida
won the meet on the men's side, and
Oregon claimed the women's title.
After closing out the indoor sea
son, the team turned its attention to
the outdoor season, arguably much
more competitive and highly charged
than the indoor season. Setting the
season off on a good note was the
Stanford Invitational, the biggest
track meet on the West Coast. The In
vitational hosts thousands of high
school and collegiate athletes, as well
as a few pros from around the coun
try.
The meet stood up to its name,
providing some outstanding perform
ances. The tone was set by Lisa Koll of
lowa State, who set a new 10,000-
meter NCAA record, with a time of
31:18.07.This was also the fastest time
in the world this year.
The Cardinal was also most happy
to welcome an alumna who actually
competed at the meet. Jillian Ca
marena ('O4) won the shot put by over
10 feet with a mark of 61-5.5. Camare
na was an Olympian in the 2008 Bei
jing Games.

Leading the way for Stanford on
the men's side was sophomore
Amaechi Morton, who won the 400
meters with a personal best time of
46.66 seconds. Morton also competed
in the 200 meters, placing second with
another personal best time —21.33
seconds.
Other individual event winners for
the Cardinal men were freshman
Jules Sharpe, who won the high jump
with a mark of 6-10.25, and sopho
more Dylan Ferris, who won the 800
with an outdoor collegiate best time
of 1:48.72. Ferris' time was also the
second fastest in the NCAA this out
door season.
In the relays, the Stanford men
captured the 4x400-meter title with a
time of 3:11.90. The team consisted of
Ferris, Morton and seniors Justin
Reed and Durell Coleman. The men
also captured the 4xloo-meter relay
title with a time of 40.78; this team
consisted of all seniors: Danny Belch,
Tyrone McGraw, Zach Chandy and
Ryan Fisicaro.
Leading the way for the women
was freshman Karynn Dunn, who
won the collegiate meet title in the
long jump with a mark of 19-8.25.
Dunn scratched three of four jumps,
but was able to notch a great mark on
the one that did count.
"When the long jump came up I
felt great, even though I fouled three
of my four jumps," Dunn said. "I man
aged to have one fair one that won me
the collegiate long jump."
"I plan on getting better by work
ing on specific things while I am at
practice and just trusting in myself
and my coach" she added.
Junior Whitney Liehr also fared
well in the long jump, placing second
with a mark of 18-11.25. Junior Brittni
Dixon-Smith had the best long jump
mark of the day for Stanford (19-
8.75), as she was competing in the in
vitational section of the meet.
Liehr came back to win the triple
jump with a mark of 42-2, pushing her
to the No. 1 spot in the NCAA so far
this season. Also faring well in the
field events were Stefanidi, who
placed second in the pole vault to tie
her collegiate best of 14-1.25, and red
shirt senior Jaynie Goodbody, who
placed third in the hammer throw
with a mark of 181-6.
Next up for the Cardinal are the
Texas Relays, UCLA Invitational and
the Johnny Mathis Invitational this
weekend.

Senior Danny Belch was part of Stanford's 4x100-meter relay team that won
the meet title at the Stanford Invitational, turning in a time of 40.78. The win
was just one of many for Cardinal athletes at their home event.
While spring break is a relaxing
time for many Stanford students, the
Cardinal track and field team was
hard at work in both indoor and out
door competition.
The U.S. Track and Field and Cross
Country Association named Stanford
head coach and director of the
track and field program Edrick
Floreal as the Men's West Regional
Coach of the Year the first week of
March. This was Floreal's third time
winning the honor, but first time on
the men's side. Floreal was commend
ed for his success in leading the Stan
ford men to a second place finish at
the MPSF Indoor Championships, as
well as for pushing his athletes to
achieve 16 provisional marks and two
automatic qualifying marks.
After winning this honor, Floreal
had the opportunity to take his group
of elite athletes to Fayette ville, Ark. to
compete in the NCAA Indoor Cham
pionships, with several Cardinal men
and women earning Ail-American
honors.
The Cardinal men were led by jun
ior Elliott Heath, who placed seventh
in the 5,000 meters with a time of
13:51.00, very close to his indoor per
sonal best. Following Heath was jun
ior Jake Riley, who finished 10th with
a time of 13:59.85. From this race,
Heath earned his fourth All-Ameri
can award, while Riley earned his sec
ond.
Earning his first Ail-American
honor was sophomore Dylan Ferris.
He placed eighth in the mile with a
time of 4:04.73 in his first NCAA
Championships. Redshirt junior
Justin Marpole-Bird also earned his
first Ail-American, placing ninth in
the 3,000 meters with a time of
8:16.04. This was also Marpole-Bird's
first NCAA Championships appear
ance.
On the women's side, the All-
America title was provided by sopho
more Katerina Stefanidi, who has
showcased her pole-vaulting prowess

all season long. Stefanidi tied for fifth
in the event, matching her collegiate
best mark of 14-I.2s.This was her first
All-American honor as well.
Although there were definitely
some top performances by Stanford,
they were not enough for Stanford to
place at the championships. Florida
won the meet on the men's side, and
Oregon claimed the women's title.
After closing out the indoor sea
son, the team turned its attention to
the outdoor season, arguably much
more competitive and highly charged
than the indoor season. Setting the
season off on a good note was the
Stanford Invitational, the biggest
track meet on the West Coast. The In
vitational hosts thousands of high
school and collegiate athletes, as well
as a few pros from around the coun
try.
The meet stood up to its name,
providing some outstanding perform
ances. The tone was set by Lisa Koll of
lowa State, who set a new 10,000-
meter NCAA record, with a time of
31:18.07.This was also the fastest time
in the world this year.
The Cardinal was also most happy
to welcome an alumna who actually
competed at the meet. Jillian Ca
marena ('O4) won the shot put by over
10 feet with a mark of 61-5.5. Camare
na was an Olympian in the 2008 Bei
jing Games.

Leading the way for Stanford on
the men's side was sophomore
Amaechi Morton, who won the 400
meters with a personal best time of
46.66 seconds. Morton also competed
in the 200 meters, placing second with
another personal best time —21.33
seconds.
Other individual event winners for
the Cardinal men were freshman
Jules Sharpe, who won the high jump
with a mark of 6-10.25, and sopho
more Dylan Ferris, who won the 800
with an outdoor collegiate best time
of 1:48.72. Ferris' time was also the
second fastest in the NCAA this out
door season.
In the relays, the Stanford men
captured the 4x400-meter title with a
time of 3:11.90. The team consisted of
Ferris, Morton and seniors Justin
Reed and Durell Coleman. The men
also captured the 4xloo-meter relay
title with a time of 40.78; this team
consisted of all seniors: Danny Belch,
Tyrone McGraw, Zach Chandy and
Ryan Fisicaro.
Leading the way for the women
was freshman Karynn Dunn, who
won the collegiate meet title in the
long jump with a mark of 19-8.25.
Dunn scratched three of four jumps,
but was able to notch a great mark on
the one that did count.
"When the long jump came up I
felt great, even though I fouled three
of my four jumps," Dunn said. "I man
aged to have one fair one that won me
the collegiate long jump."
"I plan on getting better by work
ing on specific things while I am at
practice and just trusting in myself
and my coach" she added.
Junior Whitney Liehr also fared
well in the long jump, placing second
with a mark of 18-11.25. Junior Brittni
Dixon-Smith had the best long jump
mark of the day for Stanford (19-
8.75), as she was competing in the in
vitational section of the meet.
Liehr came back to win the triple
jump with a mark of 42-2, pushing her
to the No. 1 spot in the NCAA so far
this season. Also faring well in the
field events were Stefanidi, who
placed second in the pole vault to tie
her collegiate best of 14-1.25, and red
shirt senior Jaynie Goodbody, who
placed third in the hammer throw
with a mark of 181-6.
Next up for the Cardinal are the
Texas Relays, UCLA Invitational and
the Johnny Mathis Invitational this
weekend.
