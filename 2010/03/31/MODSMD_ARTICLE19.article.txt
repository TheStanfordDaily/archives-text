# 10 OUT OF 11 AIN'T BAD
## Softball goes nearly perfect over break 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a 12-day hiatus for finals,
the No. 9 Stanford Softball team
(25-4) got back on the field during
spring break and won 10 of its 11
games.
Freshman Teagan Gerhart,
who has assumed the role of ace
of the Cardinal pitching staff,
started all 11 games in the circle
and really emerged as a potential
star.
Gerhart began the Stanford
Louisville Slugger Classic by
throwing three consecutive no
hitters, including a perfect game in
the first game of the tournament
on March 19 against Santa Clara.
In Stanford's 8-0 six-inning victo
ry over the Broncos, Gerhart was
utterly dominant, striking out 13
of the 18 batters she faced.
A day later, Gerhart tossed
two more no-hitters. In the first
game, a 7-0 Cardinal victory over
Princeton, only a fourth-inning
error by freshman shortstop
Jenna Rich prevented Gerhart
from having back-to-back perfect
games.
She picked up right where she
left off in the second game of the
day, an 8-0 five-inning Stanford
victory over Saint Mary's. In that
win, Gerhart allowed just one
base runner, a fifth-inning base on

balls. Gerhart also contributed
with the bat, hitting her first home
run of the season.
Gerhart, who is 18-3 with a 1.28
earned run average, has steadily
improved as the season has gone
on, and it has not gone without no
tice.
"I think Teagan is doing a real
ly good job," said senior left field
er Alissa Haber. "She is getting
better every time out and gaining
confidence. Half the battle with
her was her knowing she can com
pete at this level and she doesn't
have to strike everybody out. She
is starting to realize she has a de
fense behind her.
"I'm very confident with her as
our starter," she added.
In the tournament, the Cardi
nal also beat Cal Poly 8-0, though
Gerhart's sister (and also sister of
freshman outfielder Kelsey Ger
hart) Whitley, a freshman on the
Mustangs, did not see any action
in the game.
Although the Cardinal
breezed through the Stanford
Louisville Slugger Classic and a
single-game victory at UC-Davis
on March 23, it would pick up its
fourth loss of the season during
the second weekend of break at
the Stanford Invitational.
