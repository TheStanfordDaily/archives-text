# 10 OUT OF 11 AIN'T BAD
## Softball goes nearly perfect over break 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a 12-day hiatus for finals,
the No. 9 Stanford Softball team
(25-4) got back on the field during
spring break and won 10 of its 11
games.
Freshman Teagan Gerhart,
who has assumed the role of ace
of the Cardinal pitching staff,
started all 11 games in the circle
and really emerged as a potential
star.
Gerhart began the Stanford
Louisville Slugger Classic by
throwing three consecutive no
hitters, including a perfect game in
the first game of the tournament
on March 19 against Santa Clara.
In Stanford's 8-0 six-inning victo
ry over the Broncos, Gerhart was
utterly dominant, striking out 13
of the 18 batters she faced.
A day later, Gerhart tossed
two more no-hitters. In the first
game, a 7-0 Cardinal victory over
Princeton, only a fourth-inning
error by freshman shortstop
Jenna Rich prevented Gerhart
from having back-to-back perfect
games.
She picked up right where she
left off in the second game of the
day, an 8-0 five-inning Stanford
victory over Saint Mary's. In that
win, Gerhart allowed just one
base runner, a fifth-inning base on

balls. Gerhart also contributed
with the bat, hitting her first home
run of the season.
Gerhart, who is 18-3 with a 1.28
earned run average, has steadily
improved as the season has gone
on, and it has not gone without no
tice.
"I think Teagan is doing a real
ly good job," said senior left field
er Alissa Haber. "She is getting
better every time out and gaining
confidence. Half the battle with
her was her knowing she can com
pete at this level and she doesn't
have to strike everybody out. She
is starting to realize she has a de
fense behind her.
"I'm very confident with her as
our starter," she added.
In the tournament, the Cardi
nal also beat Cal Poly 8-0, though
Gerhart's sister (and also sister of
freshman outfielder Kelsey Ger
hart) Whitley, a freshman on the
Mustangs, did not see any action
in the game.
Although the Cardinal
breezed through the Stanford
Louisville Slugger Classic and a
single-game victory at UC-Davis
on March 23, it would pick up its
fourth loss of the season during
the second weekend of break at
the Stanford Invitational.

The Stanford softball team won 10 out of the 11 games it played over spring
break, pushing its record to 25-4 on the season. Its only loss came when BYU
shut down to the Cardinal bats to take a 4-2 victory on March 26.
with a five-inning 12-0 trouncing of
Cal State-Bakersfield, the Cardinal
came out flat against a talented
Brigham Young University team in
its second game on March 26 and lost
4-2.
Stanford simply didn't hit the
team managed just six hits or play
defense behind Gerhart, as the Car
dinal made three errors in the loss.
The Cardinal actually jumped out
to a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the
third, only for the Cougars to tie it up
an inning later and take the lead for
good in the fifth.
Haber believed that the team's
performance against BYU was unac
ceptable.
"This most recent loss to BYU
was an eye opener," she said. "It re
minded us that we have to score runs
and play good defense to win games."
Stanford did win the remainder of
its games in the tournament, wrap

ping up its pre-conference schedule.
Various players were the hitting
stars for the Cardinal over the course
of the two tournaments, although for
the season the offense is still being
led by Haber, sophomore second
baseman Ashley Hansen, senior
third baseman Shannon Koplitz,
freshman shortstop Jenna Rich and
senior catcher Rosey Neill.
Haber leads all batters by a wide
margin with a .484 batting average,
which is good for ninth in the nation,
to go along with 36 runs scored. She is
second on the team with both five
home runs and 10 stolen bases.
Rich has added immediate power
to the middle of the Cardinal order.

The talented freshman leads the
team with nine home runs and 30
runs batted in.
All five players have started all 29
of the Cardinal's games and are hit
ting .354 or higher.
Stanford will now have to kick its
game into a higher gear as Pac-10
Conference play begins this weekend
when the Cardinal plays host to rival
Cal.The Pac-10 is expected to be the
toughest conference in the nation
again this season. Action against Cal
begins Thursday at 7 p.m. at Smith
Family Stadium.
