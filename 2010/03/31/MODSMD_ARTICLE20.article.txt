# The 						mental side under center

### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
How do you repair a dam
aged quarterback? Foot
ball is a cerebral game, but
the mental aspect matters
more for some positions
than others. Kickers are the most docu
mented, but quarterbacks are equally
prone to suffering because they "get into
their head." Put them in the same pot as
closers, golfers, free throw shooters in
a situation where precision is para
mount and pressure is overbearing, the
chances to crumble internally start to
multiply.
With passers, it can be even worse:
the task is not simply to hit a receiver in
the hands, between two defenders, 40
yards downfield he also has to avoid
being walloped by a defender. When a
quarterback takes a few too many beat
ings, the confidence needed to succeed
begins to subside.
Take the tale of David Carr. Fie pro
vides a wonderful avenue to examine
the debilitation and theoretical regener
ation of a once-promising signal caller.
A quick recap: Carr, who starred at
Fresno State in the early 2000s, was se
lected first overall in the 2002 draft by
the expansion Flouston Texans. Before
the ink could dry on his contract, he was
the face of the new franchise and given
the easy task of becoming an NFL star
and putting the team on the map. He
was a guy whose success at the collegiate
level lasted for just about a year and a
half in a non-BCS conference his po
tential as a mobile but potent passer, as
much as any production, led to his high
draft standing.
His career started well enough: the
Texans defeated their in-state rivals, the
Dallas Cowboys, in their opening game.
But then Carr became a human punch
ing bag for the rest of his stay in Hous
ton. In three of his five seasons, he led the
league in sacks taken, and in his 2002

rookie year, he set the NFL single sea
son record for most sacks he was
downed an astounding 76 times.
After only limited production, he
parted ways with Houston in 2006, had
a short stay in Carolina, where he start
ed four games but missed much of the
year with injury, and then went to New
York as a backup for two more seasons
before signing with the San Francisco
49ers this month.
On Monday, he had a short but re
vealing interview with Greg Papa on
Chronicle Live in which he detailed his
experience in Houston, which left him
with a "bust" label and severe holes in
his makeup as a quarterback.
Two points in particular arose: Carr
lost all trust in his line and had an inter
nal clock that, after only a second, would
tell him to get rid of the ball or take off
and run, and that his maturity had been
stunted.
The first made him ineffective as a
passer. Quarterbacks do not have a
tremendous amount of time to stay in
the pocket, but they have a good three
seconds at minimum that is a
tremendous difference from just one

count. It means that he can assess his op
tions and allow routes to develop. Even
if nothing is available, he still has enough
time to check down. But if he has happy
feet, little can be accomplished.
The second made him ineffective as
a leader. Because Houston was an ex
pansion team, there was hardly any vet
eran presence to teach him the ropes.
Papa raised a point about Carr leaving
the practice facility early in Houston,
which older players saw as a faux pas.
Even if it was unintentional, Carr ap
peared entitled, and that, ultimately, was
what mattered.
So, how to remedy these issues?
The immaturity problem was van
quished in part because of age and expe
rience, but also because of Carr's stays in
Carolina and New York. With the Pan
thers, he learned the norms from Vinny
Testaverde, a longtime NFL quarter
back who was well into his 40s at the
time; and with the Giants, he learned
how to get ready in the proper manner
the starter, Eli Manning, in Carr's
words, "prepared, prepared and pre
pared, and when he was done preparing,
he prepared again."
That internal development in turn
aided his admitted mental fragility. In
New York, for the first time, he was not
expected to start or even play there
was little, if any, pressure. Instead, he re
united with Chris Palmer, the Giants'

quarterbacks coach and the Texans' for
mer offensive coordinator, with whom
he had a prosperous relationship. With
the aid of Palmer (and Manning), as
well as one of the league's better offen
sive lines, Carr was able to reconstruct
his game from the start and get back to
the point where he wasn't forced to take
off and run instantaneously. Even then,
he knew he was not ready to go back
into a starter's role after one season, so
he re-upped with the Giants in 2009. By
the end of the year, the aforementioned
preparation had restored his confi
dence, and in limited action with the Gi
ants, Carr succeeded.
That led to the current offseason,
where Carr wound up in a situation
where he may get a chance to start
again. The Niners are invested in Alex
Smith, but his hold on the top job is not
cemented. After three years in two dif
ferent cities, where Carr was essentially
mentally reconstructed, he may have an
opportunity to display his progression.
The initial question remains un
solved. But if Carr finds success in San
Francisco, his experience may provide a
basis for answering it.
