How do you repair a dam
aged quarterback? Foot
ball is a cerebral game, but
the mental aspect matters
more for some positions
than others. Kickers are the most docu

prone to suffering because they "get into

With passers, it can be even worse:

Dallas Cowboys, in their opening game.
But then Carr became a human punch
ing bag for the rest of his stay in Hous
ton. In three of his five seasons, he led the
league in sacks taken, and in his 2002
