# Tennis has true fan experience

Football may attract the
largest number of fans and
basketball the most dedi
cated, but in order to truly
appreciate what makes col
legiate sports so special, go watch a
Stanford tennis match.
The experience at the Taube Fami
ly Tennis Center is unlike any other.
No other sports venue on campus of
fers fans the opportunity to watch, in
fluence and interact with the players
the way Stanford tennis does.
What makes a Cardinal tennis
match so special, you ask?
First, due to the large amount of
seats and relatively small amount of
spectators, you are guaranteed a first
row seat. And first-row seats at the
Taube Center practically mean you
are on top of the court. Better cover
your mouth when you sneeze or that
loogie is flying over the net.
Stanford tennis isn't the only team
with a good stadium, though. The first
row of Sixth Man stands on the court
and any fan can sit right behind the
dugout at Sunken Diamond.
True, but what differentiates tennis
is the impact and influence those fans
can have on game. Yell all you want at
a basketball game and you would be
lucky if an opposing player heard you
two or three times a game. The Red
Zone can scream continuously for
four quarters and Stanford Stadium
wouldn't even come close to rivaling
Flusky Stadium or Death Valley in
decibel levels.
At Taube, every yell, chant, joke
and cough you utter, the player hears.
Without the background noise of a
football or basketball game, there is
simply no way to drown out the 15 or
so odd fans that are making noise.
Take the USC match on Feb. 27, for
example. Then-No. 1 Steve Johnson
