# Tennis has true fan experience
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
Football may attract the
largest number of fans and
basketball the most dedi
cated, but in order to truly
appreciate what makes col
legiate sports so special, go watch a
Stanford tennis match.
The experience at the Taube Fami
ly Tennis Center is unlike any other.
No other sports venue on campus of
fers fans the opportunity to watch, in
fluence and interact with the players
the way Stanford tennis does.
What makes a Cardinal tennis
match so special, you ask?
First, due to the large amount of
seats and relatively small amount of
spectators, you are guaranteed a first
row seat. And first-row seats at the
Taube Center practically mean you
are on top of the court. Better cover
your mouth when you sneeze or that
loogie is flying over the net.
Stanford tennis isn't the only team
with a good stadium, though. The first
row of Sixth Man stands on the court
and any fan can sit right behind the
dugout at Sunken Diamond.
True, but what differentiates tennis
is the impact and influence those fans
can have on game. Yell all you want at
a basketball game and you would be
lucky if an opposing player heard you
two or three times a game. The Red
Zone can scream continuously for
four quarters and Stanford Stadium
wouldn't even come close to rivaling
Flusky Stadium or Death Valley in
decibel levels.
At Taube, every yell, chant, joke
and cough you utter, the player hears.
Without the background noise of a
football or basketball game, there is
simply no way to drown out the 15 or
so odd fans that are making noise.
Take the USC match on Feb. 27, for
example. Then-No. 1 Steve Johnson
faced Cardinal junior Alex Clayton.
Johnson made no friends for himself,
constantly protesting calls and com
plaining to the umpire, A group of stu
dents was riding Johnson pretty hard,
and by the second set Johnson
snapped. After Clayton hit a ball deep,
the Trojan yelled "That one's for you
guys," pointing to his hecklers.
Once Johnson acknowledged the
crowd, he was done; Clayton went on
to close out the match in straight sets.
Upon losing, Johnson threw his rack
et, resulting in a one-point penalty
awarded to another match.
But it's not just the opponents
who acknowledge the fans. Watch
sophomore Bradley Klahn play.
After nearly every point (no exag
geration) he wins, the No. 1 singles
and doubles player turns toward the
crowd pumping his fist. That's the
equivalent of Andrew Luck running
over to the Red Zone clapping his
hands after every completion.
The players won't just look toward
you for encouragement; they'll sit
with you. During singles play, six
matches are occurring simultaneous
ly. When a player finishes, he goes up
to the stands and sits with the rest of
the fans, cheering on his teammates.
Imagine Jeremy Green strolling over
to the 6th Man after fouling out and
chanting "D-Fense!"
It would never happen.The level of
player involvement in tennis is unpar
alleled.
Still looking for more reasons? Go
to five games and you qualify for a
long sleeve, Cardinal Court workout
shirt. Be one of the top 30 fans (meas
ured by the amount of games you at

tend) and you get to rummage
through all of the team's leftover gear.
Shoes, shirts, hats, shorts, fleeces, all of
it.
There truly is no comparison to
Stanford tennis.

enough enjoyment out of spewing loo
gies onto the football field. Learn the
