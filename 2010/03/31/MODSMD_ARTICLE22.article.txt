### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its last meet of the regular sea
son, the No. 2 Stanford men's gym
nastics team blew away the No. 11
University of Illinois-Chicago
Flames with a 360.0-342.6 win in the
Flames' hometown. With that victory,
the Cardinal boasts an undefeated
record in all collegiate competitions
this year.
While February and March were
tough months both mentally and
physically for the team, with five
competitions in four weeks and an
onslaught of midterms and finals,
head coach Thorn Glielmi did not no
tice any hesitation or weakness in his
men.
"Although the guys were coming
off a high-volume cycle, they still
looked comfortable with their
strength and quickness," he said.
"Overall, I was pleased with where
they are physically and mentally."
The Cardinal's strength was most
apparent on vault, where freshman
Eddie Penev wowed fans and team
mates with a score of 16.3, and junior
Alex Buscaglia and junior co-captain
Abhinav Ramani added scores of
15.75 each.
There was also no stopping the
Cardinal on floor exercise, where
Buscaglia and Penev again stole the
show with scores of 15.7, contributing
to Stanford's overall apparatus score
of 61.7 its best on the event this
year. Reflecting back on the competi
tion, Ramani considered his team
mates' routines "highlights" of the
meet.
On rings, junior co-captain Tim

Gentry led Stanford with a score of
15.5. Freshman James Fosco, one of
Stanford's most talked-about young
talents, followed with a score of 15.45.
Glielmi notes that Fosco and
Penev have been outstanding in their
very first year of collegiate competi
tion.
"[They] continue to improve and
had standout performances this
weekend," he said.
Meanwhile, seniors were the ones
who led the way for the Flames. Se
nior Andrew Stover stole the all

around title with outstanding rou
tines on vault and high bar that led to
a total score of 86.5. And senior Niko
lai Korepanov posted an impressive
15.0 on rings.
Still, Stanford dominated its com
petition. On pommel horse, perhaps
the hardest event in men's gymnas
tics, Dixon and senior Eric Hergen
rader posted scores of 14.45 and
14.35. Junior Ryan Lieberman stole
the show on parallel bars with a 15.2
