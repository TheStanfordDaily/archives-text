# MIXED BAG FOR CARD AT CHAMPIONSHIPS
## Amuchestegui shines, others fall at NCAAs 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After qualifying four wrestlers to
this year's NCAA Championships in
Omaha, Neb., Stanford's team en
tered the tournament with high
hopes for individual glory. These am
bitions were partially fulfilled by red
shirt sophomore Nick
Amuchastegui, who placed fourth in
the 165-pound weight class and was
awarded All-American honors.
Amuchastegui won his first two
matches of the tournament. He upset
No. 3 Nick Marable of Missouri by a
score of 4-1 in the opening round, and
defeated Josh Asper of Maryland, 4-
2, to advance to the quarterfinals.
However, in his quarterfinal
matchup against No. 6 Dan Vallimont
of Penn State, Amuchastegui fell in a
5-2 decision. The loss ended his
chances of winning the tournament
however, he was placed into the
back draw and retained a shot at third
place.
Indeed, Amuchastegui capitalized
well in the back draw, winning three
consecutive matches to advance to
the third-place match. His run
through the back draw was even
more impressive, as he went through
two top-10 opponents to do so.
His first match, against No. 5 Colt
Sponseller of Ohio State, ended in a
close 2-0 decision. Amuchastegui
took his second match by the same
score over lowa's Ryan Morningstar,
ranked No. 7 nationally.
To advance to the third-place

match, Amuchastegui took down
Oklahoma's Tyler Caldwell in a 6-1
decision.
In the third-place match,
Amuchastegui faced off against No. 2
Jarrod King of Edinboro. The match
was Amuchastegui's fifth against a
higher-seeded opponent. King had
fallen in the main draw's semifinals to
Vallimont, the Penn State wrestler
who had also knocked Amuchastegui
out of that draw.
In a close match, Amuchastegui
was unable to pull out the win, losing
an incredibly close 3-2 decision.
However, he still received All-Amer
ican honors.
Amuchastegui's final record at
the NCAA Tournament was a strong
5-2 mark, which included a 3-2 record
against higher-seeded opponents. His
final record for the season stands at
34-6, and his individual career record
is 63-14.
Meanwhile, the rest of Stanford's
qualifiers all fell relatively early in the
tournament.
The biggest disappointment for
the Cardinal was redshirt junior Zack
Giesen, wrestling at 184 pounds.
After being one of the team's best
wrestlers (along with Amuchastegui)
all season, Giesen fell somewhat
short in the postseason. After finish
ing third in the Pac-10 Tournament,
he received an at-large berth at the
national tournament and opened
against sixth-seeded Maxwell Askren
of Missouri. However, Giesen did not
present much of a challenge to
Askren he was pinned one minute
and 38 seconds into the match.
In the back draw, Giesen met with
some success, winning a 4-3 decision
over Erich Schmidtke of Oklahoma
and then a 10-4 decision over Wiscon
sin's Travis Rutt.
However, his final match of the

tournament ended very quickly, as
Giesen fell to Cornell's Steve Bosak
in just 31 seconds.
Stanford's other two wrestlers
also failed to make a significant im
pact. Like Giesen, both lost their
opening-round matches and rapidly
bowed out of the back draw as well.
Junior 133-pounder Justin
Paulsen, an at-large qualifier after a
fifth-place finish in the Pac-10 Tour
nament, lost a 12-1 major decision to
No. 6 Dan Mitcheff of Kent State.
Paulsen started strongly in the
back draw, scoring a 16-1 technical
fall at 5:18 over Wyoming's Cory
Vomßaur. However, his next match
of the tournament was to be his last,
as he was eliminated by Ohio State's
lan Paddock in an 11-2 major deci
sion.
The fourth Cardinal wrestler in
Omaha, freshman Ryan Mango, met
with a fate similar to Paulsen's.
Mango was eliminated from the main
draw by No. 5 Andrew Long of lowa
State, who would go on to take sec
ond place in the tournament.
In the back draw, Mango opened
by pinning Harvard's Steven Keith in
3:56. However, his next match came
against No. 2 Troy Nickerson of Cor
nell, who would end Mango's run by
pinning him at 3:13.
Due to its small contingent, the
Cardinal was not a factor in the team
component of the tournament. The
team title went to lowa for the third
consecutive year. The Hawkeyes
topped the team table by 44.5 points,
took three individual national titles
and have now won 23 national cham
pionships since 1975. As a team, the
Cardinal finished tied for 28th with
Purdue, scoring 20.5 team points.
