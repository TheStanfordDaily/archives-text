## Prof halts MS trial after fears New treatment now awaits FDA approval 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A cutting-edge vascular treatment
program for multiple sclerosis (MS) at
Stanford Medical School was terminat
ed in December after some patients
undergoing the therapy had complica
tions.
Michael Dake, a Stanford professor
of cardiovascular surgery, had surgically
widened the internal jugular veins of
select MS patients with stents, or mesh
wire tubes. The procedure, called an
angioplasty, attempted to fix a blockage
limiting blood flow from the brain to
the heart.
This insufficiency, termed CCSVT,
was originally discovered by Dr. Paolo
Zamboni, the director of the Vascular
Diseases Center at the University of
Ferrara in Italy. Zamboni hypothesized
that the limited blood flow through the
veins contributed to inflammation in
the brain associated with MS.
MS patients who had angioplasties
in Italy reported improved quality of
life, leading to considerable excitement
among members of the MS blog com
munity. The wave of interest spread
across the globe to Stanford, where
Dake became the primary American
doctor to perform the new surgery on
MS patients.
Although the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) had not yet
approved stents for this particular pur
pose, physicians have leeway in apply
ing previously approved devices in
new ways, according to the Stanford
School of Medicine's public affairs
office. The office said Dake lawfully
attempted the new surgery on MS
patients some 40 altogether,
although the school would not confirm
the exact number.
"Dake has used balloon angioplasty
and stents in his practice of medicine,
based on his knowledge of vascular
insufficiency and of certain medical
devices and his experience as a cardio
vascular surgeon," wrote Paul Costello,
a spokesperson for the medical school,
in an e-mail to The Daily.
Then one of Dake's patients died of
a brain hemorrhage on a flight back
from visiting the doctor at Stanford.
There is now a Facebook group in her
memory attempting to raise money to
aid further research into CCSVT thera
py-
Another patient had to undergo
emergency surgery, The Wall Street

Journal reported.
In an e-mail to colleagues in
December, Dake announced the ter
mination of his angioplasty program
until clinical trials could be secured.
"In the interval before our clinical
protocol is approved by the appropri
ate regulatory agencies and necessary
trial management infrastructure is
secured, no further endovascular pro
cedures including venograms, balloon
angioplasty or stent placement will be
performed for the evaluation or man
agement of extracranial venous
obstruction in any patients, with or
without a diagnosis of Multiple

Sclerosis," he wrote, "I have made this
decision after deep soul-searching."
Stanford is now in the process of
applying for grants and clearance to
undertake a clinical trial of the therapy
to begin late this year or early next
year.
An advisory on the Department of
Neurology's Web site dissuades
patients from pursuing the therapy at
the moment.
"No, [the MS center does not rec
ommend the procedure] at this time," it
said. "There is insufficient evidence of
benefit, and possible risk."

Costello confirmed that the

University was no longer performing
the procedures.
"The procedure is no longer taking
place at Stanford awaiting a clinical
trial," Costello said.
It remains to be seen whether or not
the FDA grants Stanford clearance for
a clinical trial involving 100 patients in
which neuroimaging could confirm
whether or not vein blockage is actual
ly a problem related to MS, and
whether or not treatments like Dake's
and Zamboni's could be effective.
