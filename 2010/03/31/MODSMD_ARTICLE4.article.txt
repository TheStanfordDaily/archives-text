## Trails project moves forward Will San Mateo County Some around,' to construction? No, say supervisors 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is once again moving to complete a trail
system it agreed to build as part of its land use agree
ment with Santa Clara County, beginning with a one
mile stretch along Alpine Road in Portola Valley. But
a major roadblock to the project's completion
remains: the San Mateo County Board of
Supervisors has declined Stanford's offer to build the
planned trail within its jurisdiction.
"As far as the board is concerned, the issue is off
the table," said Richard Gordon, the president of the
San Mateo County Board of Supervisors.
For the University, this is the final drama in a
decade-long process that was harried by a contract
dispute, which was resolved in 2006, and a lawsuit
filed by the Committee for Green Foothills to pre

vent construction along San Francisquito Creek,
which the California Supreme Court invalidated in
February.
The section of the trail that would be in San
Mateo County runs from the border of Menlo Park
to Piers Lane on Alpine Road.
From the board's perspective, Gordon said, "that
stretch would be a sidewalk, not a trail."
In addition, Gordon said, residents have com
plained that an expanded trail might encroach on
their land.
The Board of Supervisors proposed an alternate

trail from Piers Lane to the Portola
Valley city limits, but Horton said
Stanford declined on the grounds
that the trail would not be continu
ous, and would therefore not fulfill
Santa Clara County requirements.
Horton said the University's
offer to build the trail would stay
open through 2011, per the agree
ment, which allows Stanford and
Santa Clara County to extend the
offer through 2013.
The San Mateo Board of
Supervisors, however, doubts the
dispute can be resolved before the
contract expires.
"We've made a fairly clear deci
sion: we think this is done and don't
see any reason to change that,"
Gordon said.
If not now, Horton believes even
tually the offer will become too
good to refuse.
The Board of Supervisors "will
come back at some point, but I don't
think right away," he said. "In my
own view, I think it will be much

healthier for people to see the qual
ity of the trail in Portola Valley, see
the quality of the trail in Menlo
Park." Then, he believes community
demand to connect the finished
trails will cause the San Mateo
Board to revisit the agreement.
Otherwise, the $8.4 million
offered to San Mateo County for the
trails go to Santa Clara County to
spend on other measures designed to
offset negative conditions for cam
pus residents that it says result from
Stanford's expansion.
Meanwhile, Portola Valley is
preparing to rebuild parts of the
one-mile section of Alpine Road
between Arastradero Road and La
Cuesta Drive to provide a larger
trail, add more native plants and
give a "more rural experience,"
according to Howard Young, the
Portola Valley director of public
works. The University will fund up
to $2.9 million of the cost for attor
neys, staff, permits and, later, con
struction.
Young estimated about $248,000
has been spent to date on design
and planning.
For the University, working with
Portola Valley has been relatively
easy. With regard to the San Mateo

Board's objections, "their issues
weren't our issues," said Ann
Wengert, a Portola Valley town
council member.
After the conclusion of the law
suit filed by the Committee for
Green Foothills, there has been no
major dispute about environmental
impact on and mitigation for San
Francisquito Creek.
"Both sides have a great sensitiv
ity to the creek," Wengert said.
"There are some very specific proto
cols we follow."
General Use Permit
Stanford owns 8,180 acres of land
in six jurisdictions. Roughly half is in
Santa Clara County and a third is in
San Mateo County. The rest is split
between Palo Alto, Woodside,
Portola Valley and Menlo Park.
When something like a trail or a
road goes through multiple jurisdic
tions, each jurisdiction must
approve the project, which caused
the University's quagmire.
In 1962, Santa Clara County cre
ated the General Use Permit
(GUP), which restricts Stanford's
expansion to a certain number of
square feet. The current GUP, which
was renewed in 2000, has 104 condi

tions among them, Horton said,
that Stanford "does the trails."
The GUP condition and the
Santa Clara County master plan call
for two trails on either side of
Stanford land, one along Page Mill
Road and the other along Alpine
Road.
According to Horton, Stanford
agreed to build the trails because
they "thought it would be a nice
recreational thing to do" and would
n't require the project to use
Stanford land.
"We would never have agreed to
do a trail down the middle of our
land," Horton said. "Then we would
have challenged the law, but we
thought it would be easy. That turns
out to be the most serious mistake
we ever made."
When Santa Clara County elected
new supervisors, "they decided to
reopen the question of where the
trails should be," leading to the con
tract dispute, Horton said. "We know
very well that our opponents don't
like this trail at all, but we feel very
good about it and think it's going to
be a great trail when it's finished."
