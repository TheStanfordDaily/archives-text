# Farm to refinance $900M
## Bond offering to start as soon as next week; state approved move 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The State of California has approved
Stanford's application to refinance around
$9OO million of tax-exempt debt. The
University plans to launch a $250 million
offering as early as next week.
"We're aiming for long maturities," said
University Treasurer Odile Disch-
Bhadkamkar, regarding the debt issuance.
"Right now we're looking at rates that would
be in the low four percents."
Since Stanford is not a public institution, it
must issue tax-exempt debt through a conduit
issuer, the California Educational Facilities

Authority (CEFA). According to Disch-
Bhadkamkar, while the authority issues debt
on Stanford's behalf, investors rely on the
University's credit for the repayment of the
bonds.
In addition to the $3OO million approved
issuance, the University also received author
ization to refinance approximately $6OO mil
lion of its existing bond portfolio over the
next five years. In order for Stanford to refi
nance its tax-exempt debt, it must get author
ization from the state, a process that would
delay the financing calendar by six to eight
weeks.
"If there is an opportunity to refinance, we
will be more agile, because this cuts six to

eight weeks off our time to market," Disch-
Bhadkamkar said. "But we have no immedi
ate plans to execute on that."
"We've done this before," Disch-
Bhadkamkar added. "We've gotten authori
zation from the state in advance that has
proven extremely helpful, particularly when
the market melted down two years ago. We
were able to finance a lot of our debt portfo
lio very quickly because we already had the
authorization in hand."
More than two-thirds of the debt issuance
will go toward financing capital facilities,
including the Knight Management Center,
the Center for Nanoscale Science and
Technology, the William H. Neukom Building

at the Stanford Law School, the Lorry I.
Lokey Stem Cell Research Building, the Li
Ka Shing Center for Learning and
Knowledge and Munger, in addition to reno
vations in dining services such as the Crothers
dining hall.
Approximately two-thirds of Stanford's
total outstanding debt is tax-exempt.
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, J.R
Morgan and Prager, Sealy & Co., LLC will
underwrite the issuance.
The Preliminary Official Statement of the
offering is accessible from MuniOS.com.
