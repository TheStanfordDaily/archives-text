# STUDENT GOV'T
## Senate supports hike for student comm fee 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Based on a proposal made by IT
Services and Academic Student
Computing that gained unanimous
approval by the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate at Tuesday's meeting, students
may have to expect a $54 increase to the
communications fee on their University
bill over the next three academic years.
The fee would rise in three gradual
installments, beginning next fall with a $4
per quarter increase for the year. An
additional $2 per quarter would be
tacked onto the fee for two years follow
ing that, raising the fee from $52 per
quarter to $6O per quarter by Fall 2013.

Richard Holeton, the director of
Academic Computing Services, and
Mark Miyasaki, the executive director of
Communication Services, suggested that

Senate support could help strengthen
their case when they present the fee
increase proposal to senior administra
tors.
The increase was proposed in the spir
it of continuing to improve scores on cus
tomer satisfaction surveys, particularly in
terms of wireless Internet performance.
Increasing the "density" of wireless
access will require additional wiring, par
ticularly in identified problem areas
around campus, the two said.
"It's hard for us to keep up with the
demand without the proper budget, and
beyond that everybody's expectation on
speed and coverage is always growing,"
Miyasaki said. "To try to meet that, we're
putting out newer equipment which is
much faster than the old style wireless."
The demand for wireless access has
increased dramatically, they said: since
the launch of the iPhone, 13,000 con
current devices have flooded Stanford
WiFi networks.
The current communications fee
sits at $52 per quarter and has only
increased by $4 per quarter since its
creation in 2006.
The Senate registered its support

for the increase, suggesting that infla
tion accounts for its need.
Additionally, as high bandwidth
videos become increasingly integral to
the daily online experience, a demand
for improved wireless access and thus
additional financial support from stu
dents is justified, senators said.
ASSU Election
In preparation for upcoming elec
tions, the Senate reconsidered the
nine special fees groups whose budg
ets the Appropriations Committee
had not recommended for funding.
The budgets belong special fees
groups who failed to garner recom
mendation by the Appropriations
Committee but were able to secure a
spot on the ballot by soliciting addi
tional student support. The Senate's
latest votes on these budgets will be
notated on the special fees ballots for
student reference on voting day,
Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll said.
Anton Zietsman 'l2, who some
times led opposition to budget pro
posals as Appropriations Chair,
reconsidered his position on The
Bridge's budget, this time affirming

his support. Although The Bridge's
marketing line item exceeds the
amount that the Senate's funding
policies would typically allow, he sug
gested that marketing is critical to
raising awareness about mental
health issues.
"It contradicts our policies,"
Zietsman said. "That being said, I
think that one of the problems with
mental health on campus is that it is
not adequately advertised."
Despite these concerns, only three
senators supported the budget over
all.
The Senate remained equally
divided on a budget for the Sexual
Health & Peer Resource Center,
which was originally rejected for
funding requests for T-shirts and offi
cer salary requests that exceed the
maximum amount listed in Senate
funding policies.
In closed session, the Senate met
with Daily staff to discuss the newspa
per's required financial disclosure
ahead of the April 8 special fees elec
tion. In open session, the Senate voted
that The Daily must disclose by
Monday the paper's net assets, the net

assets of The Friends of the Stanford
Daily Foundation, the amount of
money transferred from The Friends
to The Daily, and The Daily's operat
ing budget, which it had already sub
mitted to the Senate.
The Senate also passed legislation
to amend the joint by-laws on account
of discretionary spending regulations
and executive compensation modifi
cations and to "reduce wasteful
Senate salary expenditure," a bill
authored by Administration & Rules
Chair Alex Katz 'l2 that would cut all
Senate salaries except for a few key
positions that the body has identified
as particularly work-heavy.
All funding bills were unanimous
ly passed at Tuesday's meeting as well.
