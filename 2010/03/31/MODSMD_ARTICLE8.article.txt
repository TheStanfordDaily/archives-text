## Farm turned Liu '91 to path of service Alumnus tapped for Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
During his days as a Stanford
undergraduate, Goodwin Liu '9l
made a lasting impression on those
who worked with him in the biologi
cal sciences department at the Haas
Center for Public Service and in the
campus community at large.
Now Liu, 39, is President
Obama's nominee to the Ninth U.S.

Circuit Court of
Appeals in San
Francisco, and
some of those who
knew him at
Stanford are hard
ly surprised.
Liu is currently
a professor at the
UC-Berkeley
Boalt Hall School
of Law.
J. Myron Atkin,
a professor emeri
tus in the Stanford
School of

Education, advised Liu on his under
graduate honors thesis, a study on
the tensions in education policy asso
ciated with state-level decision-mak
ing versus local policy implementa
tion, and said he always knew Liu
would do well after school.
Twenty years ago, Atkin wrote a
letter on Liu's behalf praising his
"quick, insightful and analytic" mind
as well as the obligation he felt, even
as an undergraduate, to put his intel
lect and leadership to use in working
for "a gentler world." Atkin said he
feels those words still reflect the
Goodwin Liu he knows today.
Liu began his career at Stanford
as a biological sciences major deter
mined to go to medical school and
become a doctor. However, his work
on education policy at the Haas
Center for Public Service motivated
him to reconsider this decision and
look instead at a career in law.
Atkin said he recalled Liu being
torn between the two career paths
though former Haas Center
Director Catherine Milton, who
worked extensively with Liu, told the
Daily that "he always had time to
talk and never seemed stressed out."
At Haas, Liu led the "You Can
Make A Difference" Conference on
Education, which aimed to educate

students, faculty and community
members about key education poli
cy issues and ways to improve basic
public education.
"He understood that quality edu
cation is key to a healthy democracy
and seemed motivated to do what
he could to help our system," Milton
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. Liu
also worked with Milton in the early
start-up of AmeriCorps.
While at Stanford, Liu was also
elected to ASSU office. He was
appointed to the Stanford Board of
Trustees in 2008.
After graduating from Stanford,
Liu won a Rhodes Scholarship and
earned a master's degree in the
Philosophy, Psychology and
Physiology Program at Oxford
University in 1993, then a law
degree from Yale in 1998. Liu
clerked for Judge David Tatel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit from
1998 to 1999, as well as for U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg during the October 2000
term.
Over the course of his legal career,
Liu has become heavily involved with
progressive legal groups, including the
American Civil Liberties Union of
Northern California, the American
Constitution Society for Law and

Policy, and Chinese for Affirmative
Action.
In 2009 Liu co-authored a book
called "Keeping Faith with the
Constitution," which argues that
the Constitution must be allowed
to adapt to changes in global poli
cy and events.
The book now has many of his
opponents arguing that his views
are too leftist for him to be an
appropriate candidate for such a
high-ranking position.
On Tuesday, 42 of California's
58 county district attorneys sent a
letter to the Senate Judiciary
Committee opposing Liu's nomi
nation, citing a 2005 paper Liu co
authored that criticized Samuel
Alito's death penalty decisions, the
San Francisco Chronicle reported.
Although it seems Liu will not
have an easy road to the Ninth
Circuit bench, those who know
him are fairly confident that he
will do well in the confirmation
process.
"I think he's likely to handle
himself very well under tough
questioning," Atkin said. "The
Republicans think he's way too far
to the left, but he's not a central
control guy at all he's very
appreciative of local prerogatives."
"He does have the right 'judi
cial' temperament," Milton said,
"so this seems like a good way for
him to use his talents."
