## Farm turned Liu '91 to path of service Alumnus tapped for Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
During his days as a Stanford
undergraduate, Goodwin Liu '9l
made a lasting impression on those
who worked with him in the biologi
cal sciences department at the Haas
Center for Public Service and in the
campus community at large.
Now Liu, 39, is President
Obama's nominee to the Ninth U.S.

Circuit Court of
Appeals in San
Francisco, and
some of those who
knew him at
Stanford are hard
ly surprised.
Liu is currently
a professor at the
UC-Berkeley
Boalt Hall School
of Law.
J. Myron Atkin,
a professor emeri
tus in the Stanford
School of

Education, advised Liu on his under
graduate honors thesis, a study on
the tensions in education policy asso
ciated with state-level decision-mak
ing versus local policy implementa
tion, and said he always knew Liu
would do well after school.
Twenty years ago, Atkin wrote a
letter on Liu's behalf praising his
"quick, insightful and analytic" mind
as well as the obligation he felt, even
as an undergraduate, to put his intel
lect and leadership to use in working
for "a gentler world." Atkin said he
feels those words still reflect the
Goodwin Liu he knows today.
Liu began his career at Stanford
as a biological sciences major deter
mined to go to medical school and
become a doctor. However, his work
on education policy at the Haas
Center for Public Service motivated
him to reconsider this decision and
look instead at a career in law.
Atkin said he recalled Liu being
torn between the two career paths
though former Haas Center
Director Catherine Milton, who
worked extensively with Liu, told the
Daily that "he always had time to
talk and never seemed stressed out."
At Haas, Liu led the "You Can
Make A Difference" Conference on
Education, which aimed to educate
