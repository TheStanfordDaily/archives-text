# Writing the letter, losing the spirit
## Students take issue with University's heavy-handed approach to TSF letters 
### STEPHANIE LIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A room full of busy young
people sit around tables,
pens in hand, laboring
meticulously to write
perfectly neat thank
yous on pieces of paper. For this let
ter-writing exercise, it's about style,
not necessarily sincerity. And quanti
ty is important. For each identical
product produced, the students get a
sum of money.
That's not exactly the picture that
comes to mind when you think of
elite higher education donations, is
it? Yet this is exactly how many stu
dents would describe an experience
that is common here at Stanford
writing The Stanford Fund (TSF) let
ters.
Student groups can earn funding
from TSF, which consists of gifts from
alumni and other donors, by writing
thank-you letters to individual
donors. These letters must be hand
written neatly; one student can write
a "template" letter, which can then be
copied up to 12 times. Letters are sub
mitted for inspection and each ap
proved letter garners $25.
However, TSF letters are notori
ous because of the strict rules and
regulations that govern their content
and presentation. The official guide
provided by The Stanford Fund Part
nership Program lists dozens of re
quirements, including "Do not date
the letter either implicitly or ex
plicitly," "If there are more than two
areas where the ink is very blotchy in
an attempt to correct a mistake the
letter will be denied" and a perennial
favorite, "The 'T' in The Stanford
Fund must be capitalized." It also in

cludes a detailed list of the six parts of
a good letter, and numerous exam
ples of common errors and reasons
for letter denial.
As a result, some students ab
solutely abhor the process.
"I hate TSF Letters," said Brennan
Saeta 'l2. "They actually messed up
my hand."
Writing letters for dance group
Kuumba was one of the few times
Saeta, who is majoring in computer
science, has needed to write some
thing by hand since entering college,
so he found it a literally painful
process.
"Further, it's not a productive use
of anyone's time. Will the donors con
tinue to donate even if they receive a
copy of a hand-written letter?" he
asked. "Likely."
Danny Neumann 'lO agreed.
"Sure, I think [donors] should be
thanked," he said. "I just don't think
TSF's methods work that well."
While writing letters for the Savo
yards, Neumann tried to make his
own letters earnest, but was disheart
ened to see that many students were
writing stilted, insincere missives just
to meet the minimum requirements
to receive funding.
"I don't mean to sound overly
negative, but the instructions come
across as condescending, which I'm
sure influences the tone of the let
ters," Neumann said. "Stanford stu
dents can figure out what they need
to write."
"And also, I think the idea of a
'handwritten letter' is kind of cheesy
people use word processors these
days," he continued. "If they allowed
students to print out letters and made
the guidelines less restrictive, they'd
be able to convey students' gratitude

rather than just hatred for TSF."
Other students find the letters
mildly irritating, but can see positives
as well.
"Sometimes it just gets frustrating
when you're starting your letter for
the fifth time because you forgot to
capitalize 'The,' or something like
that", admitted Leslie Chang 'l2, but
her experiences with letter-writing
for the Taiwanese Cultural Society
have been mostly positive.
"We had a party, so we all did it at
the same time. [We] sat for a couple of
hours and had snacks", she said. "1
don't think it's a bad system it's
definitely an easy way for student
groups to get funds they need."
"Writing them with other people
definitely makes it a better experi
ence 1 guess you could say, [it's] a
sort of bonding experience in sharing
the TSF writing pain and frustration,"
laughed Angela Kwok 'l3, who is fa
mous among fellow Stanford
Archery members for her amazingly
neat letters and perfectionism. "I take

a really long time writing TSF letters,
like a little more than two per hour.
But I think that's just me, because I
like to make it really neat and I'm
afraid of messing up. I know some
people who can write seven or eight
in an hour."
Kevin Tong' 12 also started writing
TSF letters during his freshman year
for Stanford GRID, and initially
found them insincere and annoying,
but has since changed his mind.
"One caveat is that it has to be so
perfect, but people have reacted well
and made nice comments," Tong said.
"My friend's dad got one and was
like,'ls it really written by a student! ?'
it really means a lot to the donors."
This is exactly what the program
was designed to do, according to
Scott Jahnke, director of Student and
Young Alumni Development for
TSF.
"Personalized letters demonstrate
to donors that we appreciate their
support, and they help to show the
real impact of alumni giving on cam
pus," Jahnke wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "This is a meaningful way for
them to connect with current stu
dents and learn about how their gifts
are contributing to the educational
experience of Stanford today."
Before the founding of the Part
nership Program in 1995, "students
were expending a great deal of ener
gy to fundraise, and alumni were
being overwhelmed by solicitations
from 'Stanford' and student groups,
in addition to the Office of Develop
ment," Jahnke explained.
Some donors are happy with the
letters they receive.
"Honestly, sometimes I find it
hard to give money to Stanford be
cause it is such a wealthy place in

many ways," wrote one pleased
donor in a statement provided by
TSF. "It helps to hear how that money
nurtures you and your classmates'
minds, hearts and sense of self."
Another happy TSF letter recipi
ent appreciated that "in today's übiq
uitous utilization of computer-gener
ated text... she took the effort to
write by hand."
But for alumnus Christopher Lin
'O9, who created a Facebook group
entitled "I won't donate to Stanford
unless Stanford Fund letters are abol
ished," the hand-written letters have
garnered a backlash rather than so
licited donations.
"Students [are] spending a few
hours handwriting useless letters to
me that I will never read anyway, giv
ing up time that they could have
spent sleeping or chilling out or
studying or doing the things that do
nations are intended to support in the
first place, like doing useful research
or participating in student group ac
tivities," Lin wrote on the group's
home page. "In the grand scheme of
things, there are perhaps better ways
to improve student happiness, but
never has there been a black hole of
time and energy more utterly devoid
of meaning than the writing of a Stan
ford Fund letter."
But alumni like Lin may be a mi
nority — the Facebook group had
only 37 members as of press time
and Jahnke argued that the program
has helped to make it easier and more
efficient for groups to receive fund
ing. He added that continuous efforts
for improvement are being made.
"Event shifts, thank-you calling
and videos are options that have been
incorporated as the program has
evolved," he said.

Feedback on the student end
about these alternatives, however,
has been varied.
Chang feels that "phone thank
yous might be kind of cheesy or awk
ward if people don't do them right,"
while Saeta "was about to make a
video, but never got around to it."
And for Paul Chen 'l3, the videos
still seem like hard work.
"Letters are all right," he admit
ted.
