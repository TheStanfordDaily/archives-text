### 
In "Senate discusses Daily,
FLiCKS" (March 30), The Daily in
correctly reported that Sunday
FLiCKS' special fees request was re
vised on the voter guide Web site. In
fact, only one request has appeared.
In "Trails project moves for
ward" (March 31), The Daily did not
properly identify Larry Horton. He
is the senior associate vice president
for public affairs at Stanford. The
story also said the trails project
would not require the use of Stan
ford land; in fact, some Stanford land
is used for the project, according to
Horton.
