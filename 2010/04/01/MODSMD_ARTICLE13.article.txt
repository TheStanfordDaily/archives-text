## Stanford collaborates on new database search tool 
### IVY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Student and faculty researchers
looking for a better way to search
through academic journals now have a
new option in xSearch, developed in
collaboration between Stanford Li
braries and Deep Web Technologies.
With its powerful search capability,
xSearch allows users to search up to 28
sources at a time.
While researchers can use existing
search engines such as Google, JSTOR
and Stanford's Socrates library catalog
search to find article titles within jour
nals, xSearch has the additional capabil
ity to search within academic articles.
xSearch also returns results in real time,
allowing users to access the latest addi
tions to the databases with each new
search.
Grace Baysinger, the head librarian
of Stanford's Swain Library of Chem
istry and Chemical Engineering,
worked with Deep Web Technologies
to adapt the search engine to Stanford's
needs. She and other librarians worked
to select the 28 resources through which
xSearch searches.
xSearch is meant to be used as an in
terdisciplinary search engine, despite
the apparent scientific bent of the jour
nals involved.
"It's slightly weighted a little more
on the sci-tech end, but despite the
names of some of the resources, they are
broad in scope," Baysinger said. "One of
them, for example, is the Web of Sci

ence, and it actually includes a science
citation index, social science citation
index and arts and humanities index. It
cuts across all the subject areas."
This initial xSearch launch also in
cludes patent citations, conference pro
ceedings, e-books and a grant fund di
rectory, in addition to links to journal ar
ticles. More online resources may be
added in the future, Baysinger said.
When the search is run, xSearch re
turns between 100 and 200 items re
trieved from each of the 28 sources and
merges the results into one relevancy
ranked list, allowing users to avoid
searching individual sources separately.
The search also only returns the most
relevant of results, as opposed to the en
tire list of matches.
"It should not be considered a re
placement for a comprehensive search
or an in-depth search of one individual
source," Baysinger said. "So you can
think of it as kind of a starting place to
find some good citations."
One unique feature of xSearch is
that it allows users to create a set of fa
vorite databases, as well as alerts for
new publications from their favorite
journals.
Due to the licensing agreements of
the resources being searched, use of
xSearch is limited to Stanford users with
SUNet IDs.
xSearch can be accessed at
