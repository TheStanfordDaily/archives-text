## EDITORIAL Time has come for Tiger to rebuild his reputation 
### 
This year at Big Game, the stadium was
ecstatic to welcome home one of the
University's greatest alumni at half
time. When Tiger Woods briefly took the mi
crophone, he let his Cardinal pride show, de
claring to all Cal fans that "the second half is
ours." Unfortunately, the Cardinal football
team could not deliver on Tiger's guarantee,
and that defeat was the beginning of a series
of very unfortunate events for the world's
best golfer. Five days later, there was a suspi
cious car accident near Tiger's Florida resi
dence, and within hours, an intricate plot of
infidelity started to unravel the life of an ath
lete with one of the most respectable reputa
tions in professional sports.
We, the Editorial Board, have avoided
joining in on the media frenzy that has fol
lowed Tiger's every move over the last few
months because we agree with what Tiger has
stated time and time again this is a private
matter, to be reconciled between Tiger and
his wife, Elin. The entire Stanford communi
ty is clearly disappointed to know that such
an important member of the Stanford family
was enduring personal turmoil in such a pub
lic manner. It is certain that Tiger has a long
and arduous road in front of him in order to
repair his personal life and reputation, and

the best way for Tiger to advance that process
is for him to get back to doing what he does
best playing golf.
Tiger Woods' self-imposed leave of ab
sence from the sport has cost everyone in
volved, none more so than Tiger himself.
When he announced that he would return to
the sport next week at the Masters Tourna
ment, it came as a great relief to the world of
golf, but it is very unlikely that this will be
business as usual. Tiger must improve on the
already notorious focus that has character
ized him in the past. Some will comment on
what transpires next week and confuse what
is fit for a gossip column with what really
matters that the athlete of the decade is
returning to his sport and determined to con
tinue his dominance.
There is no doubt that Tiger would not be
competing at Augusta if he were not 100 per
cent sure that he was in the best possible
form for golf. We expect Tiger Woods to give
his best effort, which has been known to lead
to success. We, the Editorial Board, want to
let Tiger know that for every mistake there is
a remedy, and in his case, the remedy will
come through renewed dedication and per
sistence. We are confident that Tiger will
show us all just how much he has.
