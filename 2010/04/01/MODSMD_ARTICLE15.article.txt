# ALTERNATIVE LIVING...WITHOUT THE NAKED
## On Being Home 
### Samantha Toh 
I'm back from Paris, and it feels good.
While I do miss waking up to freshly
baked, chocolate-lined croissants and
teacups of milky coffee, it is hard to counter
the comforts of finally being here. Here,
there is no pressing rush of a city, nor is there
that desire to see everything I can, to visit all
the three thousand caf?s I want to or spend
my hours in famous museums. While I was
lucky to have been in Paris, I'm perhaps even
luckier to return to a place that feels like
home.
It is strange to think of what makes a
home.This morning, I woke up in my bed, just
lying there for a while, tucked into the famil
iar smell of my sheets and the warmth of the
six layers of covers that I like to curl up
under. Sun was actually coming in through
the window overhead, and there was a dis
tant sound of birds. I walked down the stairs,
and in the kitchen was a stretch of home
made pretzels, covered in giant sugar crystals
and cinnamon. They were neither bite-sized
nor delicate. I devoured one. The chunky
lump sat in my belly like a giant rock of awe
someness, and despite my 8:23 a.m. jetlag, I
felt extremely content.
Life, in short, has been good these past few
days, and I have been surprised by the things
I have missed. I never really thought about
what exactly created that sense of belonging
for me, and coming back, it was exciting to
find out what I really enjoyed before without
realizing it.
The first meal I had coming back, for ex
ample, was In-N-Out. After much whining,
cajoling and bursting into rooms, I finally got
my friend Conor to drive me the torturous,
heartbreaking distance that separated us
from my favorite fast food chain. While my
order of choice is usually a Double-Double,
animal style fries and a Neapolitan milk
shake inducing a food coma lasing several
hours this time, I stuck to a plain cheese
burger.
It only took one bite for the burger to get
to my head, and so much of the hit was not in
the taste. The sense of familiarity, more than
anything else, made the cheeseburger so
much better. I remembered all the times I ate
unhealthy burgers out of a paper carton in a
car, listened to bad Top 40 hip-hop on the
radio or mindlessly watched people in sloppy
tracksuits lumber in parking lots, holding
positively extravagant numbers of Walmart
plastic bags. I remembered the Californian
sunshine, putting my feet up on car seats and
getting yelled at by picky friends. And per
haps, in that second, an exhaustive list of all
the things that made Stanford home for me
was encapsulated in a drippy, cheesy bite of
toasted burger.
This strange power of memory and nostal
gia has made the past few days a constant sur
prise, and I foresee this sense continuing at
least for the coming week. I enjoy sitting back
and just looking at the things that just make
me happy and feeling surprised that they
do. In a sense, I feel that I appreciate every
thing more, coming back. It is a well-known
clich? that absence makes the heart grow
fonder, but in some sense, I am in the process
of understanding what it means.

I don't feel like I am in a place to question
other people's sense of belonging. To do so
would feel too much like being a quack guru,
twisted up in a lotus pose, wearing strings of
beads from an overpriced ethnic-themed
store and asking, a bit too keenly, "What
makes your sense 0f... homel" At the same
time, I do believe that it is important to ques
tion our environment and surroundings, to
know what creates meaning for us, or simply
a sense of belonging. Some of my homesick
friends described their need for giant coffee
mugs, while others were more attached to in
tangibles, like smells or certain feelings. One
thing I certainly missed was the freedom to
visit people in their rooms something re
stricted by the fact that we mostly lived with
host families in Paris.
The act of missing, I once told my friends,
is hardly a weakness though it can become
one if it is debilitating and takes away an abil
ity to find happiness in the present. At the
same time, I find missing a nice indicator that
something important has been created,
something that we carry with us and notice
only when it is gone.
The implications of this, I think, are im
portant. Imagining a permanent removal of
the important things around me frightens me
enough that I feel compelled to appreciate
them, right here and now. After all, I some
times go through days being grumpy and
spending my days snoozing and doing noth
ing. I think maybe that should change, and
there should be some appreciation going on,
preferably involving cuddles, home cooked
food and everything that has been missing
from my life in the past three months.

Tell Sam what makes home home at
samtoh@stanford.edu ... even if that does
make her a quack guru.
