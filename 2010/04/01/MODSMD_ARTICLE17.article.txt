# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Pondering the nature of community 
### Danny Crichton 
I recently had an enlightening conversation
with my residence fellow about communi
ty building and the difficulty of creating
communities at schools like Stanford. After
the conversation, I began thinking: of all the
leading issues here at Stanford like relation
ship abuse and mental health, the root of all
of them appears to be a lack of social cohe
sion and trust a lack of community.
For an almost entirely residential school,
Stanford lacks the close connections between
students that are the basis of a strong commu
nity. There are, of course, small pockets of
community, but as a whole, there are few
things we all share together besides a simple
identification with the University itself.
Perhaps we should not be surprised con
sidering the sources of this social fragmenta
tion. It begins with the high degree of con
nectivity of our generation, and especially
among Stanford students. I and others have
gone through entire meals without saying a
word because we have pressing business to
attend to on our mobile phones. Even social
networking does not build a true community,
instead providing students a wider but weak
er virtual community unconnected with their
everyday lives.
Connectivity, though, can only partially
explain our social fragmentation. The other
half is the lack of shared experiences that un
derpin the development of any community.
At one point, there was a limited set of ma
jors available, with a common curriculum for
all students. The buzzword in education
today though is individualization from
building our own majors to choosing one of
the 80 possible combinations of IHUM
courses. We simply cannot form any kind of

intellectual community when the shared
basis of that community does not exist.
These two trends are not inexorable
we can reduce social fragmentation with ef
fort. I believe the question before our gener
ation is relatively simple: do we want to live
lives of independence or lives of community?
There is a sacrifice of the personal in the
creation of community. We can either focus
on building our individuality and create a
wide but weak social network, or we can
build strong communities that undermine
the primacy of the individual. Perhaps these
two are not mutually exclusive, but they are
certainly difficult to accomplish simultane
ously.
If we do choose to move toward commu
nity, we will need to take specific actions to
incubate the community that we seek. There
are a host of options, but it all starts with
some level of sacrifice. Perhaps it is our time,
perhaps it is our freedom, but every commu
nity is predicated on forgoing something per
sonal for the good of the whole. This sacrifice,
of course, is not a losing proposition. The
benefits of the community should outweigh
the small sacrifice, and thus, an attitude of
service is the foundation necessary to build a
community.
From that foundation, there are multiple
avenues to build different types of communi
ties. To create a social community, there has
to be an ongoing shared experience. Activi
ties like going to a movie, or perhaps a the
ater production or a sports event allow for a
common experience that builds ties of social
cohesion. When these events occur may not
always be convenient again, there is some
level of sacrifice in building a community.

There are also the persistent connections
that can be created just through conversation
deep and meaningful conversations can
create lasting relationships.
If our goal is to create an intellectual com
munity, we need to put together shared intel
lectual experiences beyond merely taking
the same curriculum. Reading the same
newspapers, creating book discussions and
sharing diverse ideas can all help build a
strong community of scholars. This type of
community is certainly not easy to create
the investment requires a fairly high level of
engagement. Yet, an intellectual community
can create a unique scholarly fulfillment that
no class can itself provide.
Finally, creating a residential community
requires perhaps the least work, and yet re
mains one of the most difficult to accomplish.
Opening doors, walking around, meeting
new people not difficult by any measure,
yet each requires an activation energy to get
started. Make it a personal mission to meet
one person in your dorm that you have not
met each week. You never know who could
become a close friend, lab partner or favorite
late-night conversation buddy.
We live in a world with a lower level of
community than before, but it does not have
to be this way. A little sacrifice, some good
humor and a little disconnection from the
technology of the day may lead to some of
the most cherished moments during college.
It certainly has for me.
