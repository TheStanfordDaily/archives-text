## The 						best tourney ever? 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Last year's NCAA tournament
was pretty awful. Chalk domi
nated the majority of the Big
Dance, and no one with a soul
likes UNC and Roy Williams. There
was no Cinderella, no colossal upset or
any legitimately compelling storyline.
This year's tournament? Freaking
insane!
If you have two out of the four Final
Four teams in your bracket, like I do,
you're probably feeling pretty cocky.
The tournament has been as unpre
dictable as it has ever been, and brack
et busters have run amuck. The Final
Four hasn't even been played yet, and I
can say without hesitation that this has
been my favorite March of all time.
Because of this, I've decided to rec
ognize some of the high and low points
of this year's tournament. Here is a
quick recap of 2010's Madness.
Best Game
This award came down to two
marathon games. The first was an open
ing round double-overtime thriller be
tween BYU and Florida in which two
teams from the opposite ends of the
country and the partying spectrum
opened the tournament with one of
the best battles in recent memory.
BYU, led by best player-you-have
never-heard-of Jimmer Fredette,
emerged victorious after the Gators
ran out of gas.
It's really hard to pick against a guy
named Jimmer, but the Sweet 16 show
down between Xavier and Kansas
State was just bananas. Unlike
BYU/Florida, this game came down to
the last second in double overtime!
The nails on my fingers are still suffer
ing as a result of this game, and when I
inflict bodily harm upon myself due to
anxiety surrounding a game between
B-level teams from Kansas and Ohio, it
must be March.
Biggest Disappointment
Was Villanova serious? After bare
ly escaping the first round against
Robert Morris, the Wildcats were ab
solutely manhandled by Saint Mary's
and center Omar Samhan in the
round of 32.1 understand that Nova
has no frontcourt, but you'd think that
the backcourt of Scottie Reynolds,
Corey Fisher and Corey Stokes would
at least be able to foster a Sweet 16
birth, right?
Player of the Tournament
This was probably the most difficult
category to choose from as so many
players have performed at an extrater
restrial level. However, it seemed like
every time someone had a phenome
nal game or two, he would follow it up
with a clunker. Most people would
argue that this award should probably
go to a guy that is still dancing, but I
don't see any player in the Final Four
than is more deserving than Xavier's
Jordan Crawford.
A transfer from Indiana, Crawford
initially gained popularity for his pos

terization of Leßron James in a sum
mer pickup game. Now as a star on
perennial threat Xavier, Crawford ex
ploded this year, averaging 20.5 points
per game along with five rebounds
and a steal. However, his season stats
paled in comparison to his tourna
ment numbers. In the Musketeers'
three tournament games, Crawford
posted scoring totals of 28,27 and 32.
In their final game against Kansas
State, it seemed as if he just couldn't
miss. Every shot he took, except for his
final attempt, seemed destined for the
hoop. Congrats to Crawford on no
longer being known solely for his hu
mility donation to Leßron.
Worst Decision of the Tournament
Unlike the other categories, this
one was a no brainer. Up just one with
under a minute left against tourna
ment-favorite Kansas, Northern lowa
was treading on very, very thin ice.
UNl's best player, Ali Farokhmanesh,
received the ball after his team finally
managed to break the Jayhawk's full

court press. With 30 seconds left on
the shot clock, Farokhmanesh cleared
his defender, and took a three-point
bomb from the wing. Not only were
the odds against him, but a misfired at
tempt would give Kansas a chance to
win the game with plenty of time to
work with. Farokhmanesh's shot was
not just ill advised it was downright
insane.
Best Decision of the Tournament
HOLY #*s%*#s% IT WENT IN!
Farokhmanesh nailed the shot heard
'round America. With 30 seconds left
on the shot clock, he made one hell of a
courageous decision, and it paid off in
the form of one of the most dramatic
bracket busters of all time. The dagger
made Farokhmanesh an instant
celebrity and cemented his spot as the
most recognizable face in lowa since
Herbert Hoover.
Honorable mention goes to his
teammate, Lucas O'Rear, for growing
the greatest pair of muttonchops in col
lege basketball history.

Zach Zimmerman "forgot" to mention
that he picked Texas over Kentucky. Re
mind him that the Longhorns didn't
make it out of the first round at
zachz@stanford.edu.
