## The
						best tourney ever? 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Last year's NCAA tournament
was pretty awful. Chalk domi
nated the majority of the Big
Dance, and no one with a soul
likes UNC and Roy Williams. There
was no Cinderella, no colossal upset or
any legitimately compelling storyline.
This year's tournament? Freaking
insane!
If you have two out of the four Final
Four teams in your bracket, like I do,
you're probably feeling pretty cocky.
The tournament has been as unpre
dictable as it has ever been, and brack
et busters have run amuck. The Final
Four hasn't even been played yet, and I
can say without hesitation that this has
been my favorite March of all time.
Because of this, I've decided to rec
ognize some of the high and low points
of this year's tournament. Here is a
quick recap of 2010's Madness.
Best Game
This award came down to two
marathon games. The first was an open
ing round double-overtime thriller be
tween BYU and Florida in which two
teams from the opposite ends of the
country and the partying spectrum
opened the tournament with one of
the best battles in recent memory.
BYU, led by best player-you-have
never-heard-of Jimmer Fredette,
emerged victorious after the Gators
ran out of gas.
It's really hard to pick against a guy
named Jimmer, but the Sweet 16 show
down between Xavier and Kansas
State was just bananas. Unlike
BYU/Florida, this game came down to
the last second in double overtime!
The nails on my fingers are still suffer
ing as a result of this game, and when I
inflict bodily harm upon myself due to
anxiety surrounding a game between
B-level teams from Kansas and Ohio, it
must be March.
Biggest Disappointment
Was Villanova serious? After bare
ly escaping the first round against
Robert Morris, the Wildcats were ab
solutely manhandled by Saint Mary's
and center Omar Samhan in the
round of 32.1 understand that Nova
has no frontcourt, but you'd think that
the backcourt of Scottie Reynolds,
Corey Fisher and Corey Stokes would
at least be able to foster a Sweet 16
birth, right?
Player of the Tournament
This was probably the most difficult
category to choose from as so many
players have performed at an extrater
restrial level. However, it seemed like
every time someone had a phenome
nal game or two, he would follow it up
with a clunker. Most people would
argue that this award should probably
go to a guy that is still dancing, but I
don't see any player in the Final Four
than is more deserving than Xavier's
Jordan Crawford.
A transfer from Indiana, Crawford
initially gained popularity for his pos
