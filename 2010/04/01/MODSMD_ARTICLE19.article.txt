# BEAR MAULING
## Baylor beats Stanford for 10th consective time 
### MIKE LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
Improbably, the streak continues.
No. 7 Stanford men's tennis, one of the most
decorated programs in the nation, lost to Bay
lor for the tenth consecutive time, 4-3, on Tues
day at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium. The
Cardinal has never defeated the Bears in its
history.
While Baylor, ranked No. 11 coming into
the match, is a perennial title contender, the
streak defies common logic.
"Every year, it's been close," said junior
Alex Clayton. "Last year, it came down to the
last match. It is hard to believe we lost to Bay
lor ten straight years."
Stanford, which was on its own four-game
winning streak, captured the early doubles
point, but it wasn't easy. Clayton and senior
Richard Wire, playing in the No. 2 spot, quickly
went down 8-0 before the other two matches
were barely under way.
The Cardinal rebounded as the freshmen
duo of Matt Kandath and Denis Lin won 8-4.
The rock steady sophomore team of Bradley
Klahn and Ryan Thacher, the top-ranked team
in the nation, won 8-5 to secure the point.
"We put too much pressure on ourselves to
beat them," Klahn said. "It didn't quite work
out, but we put ourselves in a good position to
win the match. We won the doubles point, but
things didn't go our way."
Only once this season had Stanford won the
doubles point, but failed to win the match. Bay-

lor would be the second time.
First was Lin. The freshman lost in straight
sets, 6-4,6-1. Next to lose was Clayton, putting
Stanford in a 2-1 hole.
Klahn righted the ship for the Cardinal, win
ning in straight sets, 7-6 (3), 6-3.The victory was
Klahn's fourth in a row, after struggling
through a rough patch earlier in the season.
"I feel a lot more confident out there on the
court," Klahn said. "I knew I was still playing
well, and it was just a matter of time before I
started winning again. I'm serving much
smarter and hitting my backhand with a better
pace."
With the score knotted at 2-2, Stanford
needed two wins from Wire, Thacher and jun
ior Greg Hirshman.
Wire, coming off a disastrous doubles per
formance, put up a courageous fight in his sin
gles match, but lost a tiebreak in the second set
to lose 6-1,7-6 (5).
Hirshman had won his first set and was lead-
