## GSC discusses fees, insurance 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Wednesday's Graduate Student Council (GSC)
meeting saw advisory votes for several special fees
groups and discussion of recent changes in Cardinal
Care for international students.
GSC members cast their advisory votes to indi
cate whether or not they supported the budgets of
joint special fees groups that petitioned to get on the
ballot. After heated debate, members voted unani
mously to indicate support for Sunday FLiCKS and
the Legal Counseling Office on the ballot.
The other four groups received more criticism be
fore the votes were in. Both Stanford Club Sports
and Stanford Outdoors were supported 10-2, while
the ASSU Speakers Bureau was supported 10-0, with
two members abstaining.
The final group, Pacific Free Clinic, underwent
more scrutiny from several GSC members.
"I'm not against doing good things for other peo
ple, but just a month or a week ago, we were getting
mad at [ASSU President] David [Gobaud] funding
$5OO for a Haiti relief czar, and now we're going to
give $33,000 of student fees to the community," said
School of Education representative Jon McNaugh
tan, a first-year graduate student in education. "You
know, that makes me a little nervous."
Debate arose about whether or not student fees
should support charity.
"I just don't think it's appropriate for students to
be paying special fees for a public interest," said engi
neering district representative Addy Satija, and a
third-year graduate student in energy resources engi
neering.
Council members concluded with a vote of six in
favor and six against. None abstained.
Council members involved in international stu
dents' efforts to create an exemption for the newly
instituted policy of mandatory Cardinal Care an
nounced that changes have been discussed with
Vaden representatives.
Plans to establish exception criteria or to evaluate
international insurances case-by-case are on the
horizon, according to GSC co-chair Nanna Notthoff,
a second-year graduate student in psychology.
More updates and announcements in response to
the insurance backlash will be posted to the Vaden
Web site later this week, she said.
The council also passed a bill that clarified the
process of budget interviews for joint special fees
groups for upcoming years.
"It's to guarantee that next year, things will go
very smoothly," said Funding Committee Chair Ping
Li, a business student.
Additionally, the council approved a bill to clarify
the process for ASSU executives to create cabinet
positions and a bill dealing with funding between the
two political bodies.
According to the new amendments, the Senate
will take care of funding for events with more than 70
percent undergraduate attendance, while the GSC
will take care of funding for events with more than 70
percent graduate attendance. Events that are in nei
ther category will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
The council also discussed plans to increase voter
turnout.
According to Assistant Elections Commissioner
Mary van der Hoven, a doctoral student in earth sci
ences, graduate student voter turnouts were at a low
last year.
"Last year, most schools' or de
partments' voter turnouts, besides
the School of Earth Sciences, had de
creased by nearly 20 percent or
more," she said.
The council raised a proposal to
fund happy hours and parties to at
tract graduate students during elec
tion days. Van der Hoven said she
plans to recruit a slew of students to
organize these events around depart
ments and schools.
Elections Commissioner Quinn
Slack 'll will seek volunteers to staff
polling stations.
In an ASSU update, ASSU Presi
dent David Gobaud, a coterminal
student in computer science, report
ed that 1,500 people attended the
ASSU-sponsored Steven Chu speak
er event last quarter and that Haiti
relief efforts have resulted in
fundraising of more than $400,000.
