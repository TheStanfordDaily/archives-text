# GOING WITH GERHART
## 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford Softball team opens Pac
-10 conference play today when it plays host to
its rival No. 14 Cal in the first game of a three
game series. The weekend series is being played
Thursday to Saturday so as to avoid having to
play on Easter Sunday.
Stanford (25-4) enters conference play hav
ing won 11 of its last 12 games, with the only loss
being a 4-2 decision at the hands of BYU last
weekend at the Stanford Invitational.
Although Stanford's offense has been potent
all season, a new star has recently emerged on
the team in the form of freshman pitcher Teagan
Gerhart.
Teagan Gerhart, the sister of two-sport star
Toby Gerhart, began the season as part of a pla
toon in the circle with junior Ashley Chinn. In
the past few weeks, Gerhart has separated her
self from Chinn, as the junior has struggled with
some of her mechanics.
Gerhart relishes the opportunity to lead one
of the best teams in the nation.
"Right now [being the ace] is an awesome
experience. It's great to lead and show this team
what I can do," Gerhart said. "I don't feel pres
sure exactly; I'm more just anxious to play. I take
it as a challenge."
For the year Gerhart is 18-3 with a 1.28
earned run average.
Despite her success, Gerhart still expects
Chinn to figure out her mechanical problems
and contribute later on in the season.
"I knew we would share at the beginning of
the season, and I thought she would have the
starting role," Gerhart said. "But right now she
is working on some things pitching-wise, and I'm
sure she will come around and be a contributor
again."
Supplementing Gerhart's performances in
the circle, which included three consecutive no
hitters, is a powerful Stanford offense, heading

that offense for a fourth consecutive season is
senior left fielder Alissa Haber.
Haber is ninth in the nation with a .484 bat
ting average. The three-time All-American and
member of the United States National Team has
also hit five homeruns and scored 36 runs this
year.
Haber, an English major who will be return
ing to Stanford next year to earn a master's de
gree in English, was also recently named one of
the ten finalists for the prestigious Lowe's Se
nior Class Award, given annually to a student
athlete that excels on the field, in the classroom

and in the community.
"The coolest thing about that award as an in
dividual award is that it recognizes not only ath
letic accomplishments but also my academics,"
Haber said. "It is hard to keep that in balance at
Stanford. It is nice to have both sides honored
and recognized and be seen as not just an athlete
but also as a student."
This being her fourth and final time entering
conference play, Haber sees this Stanford team
approaching the challenges of the Pac-10 a bit

Freshman Teagan Gerhart, above, has performed phenomenally in her new role as the Stanford
Softball team's ace. She is 18-3 on the season with an earned run average of just 1.28.
differently than Stanford teams of the
past.
"Because we are a lot younger as a
team, there is a lot of enthusiasm,"
Haber said. "There is a really big de
sire, a hunger almost, to prove our
selves to the other teams in the Pac-10.
It's an incredibly competitive confer
ence, and we know anyone can win it."
If Stanford wants to win the con
ference, it will likely need to get off to
a good start with a series win at home
against Cal.
The Golden Bears have a potent
lineup led by a sophomore speedster,
leftfielder Jamia Reid. For the season,
Reid is hitting a robust .422 with 39
stolen bases.

In the circle, however, Cal does not
have a single ace. Returning starter,
senior Marissa Drewrey, has struggled
this season with a 5.73 ERA and has
been relegated to the bench. In her ab

sence, freshman Jolene Henderson
and junior Valerie Arioto have been
splitting time. Henderson is a hard
thrower, while Arioto has a wider
repertoire of pitches. The Cardinal will
likely see both pitchers this weekend.
Tlie entire Stanford team seems
excited to begin conference play and
take on Cal, but likely no one is as ex
cited as Gerhart.
"It will mean a lot to me to play Cal
because I actually almost went to
Cal," Gerhart said. "It will be different
to pitch against the girls I met and the
coaches I almost played for."
Fortunately for Stanford, Gerhart
will be wearing cardinal and white this
weekend, not blue and gold, meaning
the Cardinal has a good shot at start
ing the Pac-10 season on the right
track.
