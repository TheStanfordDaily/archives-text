# CARD HEADS TO WESTWOOD
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite Monday's 5-1 loss to San Fran
cisco, the Stanford baseball team has ex
perienced significant success in its recent
ly busy schedule, winning eight of its last
12 games. The No. 19 Cardinal (12-7, 2-1
Pac-10) has enjoyed the luxury of compet
ing at Sunken Diamond for the majority
of its games, but this weekend, the team
will travel to Westwood to face one of the
nation's hottest clubs, No. 2 UCLA (21-0,
0-0 Pac-10). The tough Easter Weekend
series will kick off the month of April for
the Cardinal and begin the upcoming hec
tic two-week stretch in which the team
will play nine times in 13 days.
Yet it won't be the first time this season
that Stanford has faced a top-five pro
gram. In fact, UCLA will be the third top
rated team that the Card has taken on
thus far. The team swept No. 5 Rice to
open the year, but dropped three straight
at No. 3 Texas two weeks later. Head
coach Mark Marquess intentionally
scheduled series with strong teams in the
preseason in order to prepare his team to
better contend with the high caliber teams
in the Pac-10 conference, especially
UCLA.

And this preparation was certainly
necessary, because the Bruins are on a
roll. The team currently flaunts a perfect
record, though it has not so far competed
in any league series. UCLA entered its
game with Pepperdine on Tuesday with a
.364 batting average, which is second-best
in the Pac-10, as well as the nation's best
ERA of 2.30 and a .974 fielding percent
age. This demonstrates the Bruins' statis
tical superiority, compared with Stan
ford's .298 average, 5.27 ERA, and .961
fielding.
Thus, UCLA's offensive talent is a
force to be reckoned with, as multiple
players in the lineup are batting well
above .400. This includes sophomore sec
ond baseman Tyler Rahmatulla, who
leads the club with a .453 average, in addi
tion to senior designated hitter Blair Dun
lap, who is hitting .417. Rahmatulla has
driven in 22 runs, and sophomore first
baseman Dean Espy has a team-best 23
RBIs and should provide a definite chal
lenge for the Cardinal pitchers.
UCLA has dominated from the
mound as well, led by sophomore right
hander Dan Klein, who has yet to allow a
run in 13 appearances and 16.0 innings.
He is joined by junior left-hander Matt
Grace, who has also denied opposing

teams of any runs in his 10 appearances
and 8.2 innings. In fact, opponents are bat
ting a mere .188 against Bruins coach
John Savage's entire pitching staff. This
weekend, however, Stanford will first
have to deal with starting RHP Gerrit
Cole (6-0,2.63), RHP Trevor Bauer (6-0,
2.33) and LHP Rob Rasmussen (3-0,
2.64). Stanford's weekend rotation has
not yet been announced.

No. 16 Stanford baseball has won eight of its last 12
games, despite losing to San Francisco on Monday.
The Card heads to UCLA this weekend for a weekend
series against the undefeated Bruins.

Fortunately for the Cardinal, of
fense has so far been a strong suit.
Stanford racked double digits on the
scoreboard in nine straight games
prior to USC and won five games
with clutch hitting, with four different
players claiming victories in last at
bats. Junior Zach Jones had game
winning hits against Pepperdine and
USC, freshman Kenny Diekroeger
doubled to defeat Rice, junior
Jonathan Kaskow knocked in the
winning run versus UCSB and junior
Jake Schlander had a walk-off solo
homerinthe 11th,also againstUCSÃŸ.
Freshman Stephen Piscotty leads
the club offensively with a .356 aver
age, 19 runs, and 15 RBI. Piscotty
maintained a 10-game hit streak
until Sunday against USC and looks
to regain his momentum against the
Bruins this weekend.
The key for the Cardinal, which
has defeated UCLA in 10 of the last
12 conference series since 1998, will
be to drive in runs early and elimi
nate the defensive errors. A pattern
has emerged this season in which the
team trails early and is then forced
to put together crucial big innings
later on in order to get back into the
game. Stanford has given up 28 first
inning runs this year and needs to
execute nine solid innings in order
to have success in Los Angeles for its
second Pac-10 series of the season.
Stanford begins the series on
Thursday, with the first pitch at 6
p.m. The games continue on Friday
at 6 p.m. and Saturday at 2 p.m.
