## Men take eigth in match play 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's golf team placed
eighth at the Callaway Collegiate Match Play
Championship in Marana, Ariz, over spring
break.
The unique event pits sixteen of the na
tion's premier teams against each other in a
bracket style tournament. Each round is a
best of five series of individual matches be
tween two schools.
Stanford head coach Conrad Ray went to
Arizona with senior Joseph Bramlett, juniors
Steve Ziegler and Sihwan Kim and freshmen
Steve Kearney and Andre DeDecker.
The matches were held at the Ritz-Carl
ton Golf Club, Dove Mountain, which is also
the new home of the World Golf Accenture
Match Play Championships. Dove Mountain
is a desert golf layout, which features eleva
tion changes from 2,300 to 3,000 feet.
For the Callaway Collegiate Match Play,
the course played as a par 72 and measured
7,833 yards.
Stanford, ranked second in the nation,
was the top seed going into the tournament
and defeated 16 seed Indiana, 3-2 in the first
round on Sunday.
Kim, Ziegler and Kearney picked up the
three wins for the Cardinal. Kim was a 2-up
winner over Alex Martin. The junior won
holes 13 and 17 for the victory.
Ziegler led from start to finish in his
match against David Erdy en route to a 3 and
2 victory. Kearney pulled out a 1-up victory
over Ren Han.
Stanford met its match on Tuesday in the
quarterfinals against the No. 12 Trojans of
use.
Bramlett and Kearney were the only win
ners on the day for the Cardinal, who fell 3-2.
Bramlett defeated Matthew Giles 1-up,
while Kearney beat Stewart Hagestad, 3 and
2.
Bramlett was a rising star as a freshman.
He earned second-team All-American hon
ors and helped Stanford win its first NCAA
title in 14 years. But two freak wrist injuries
kept him on the sideline for most of his soph
omore and junior seasons. His return to the
Cardinal lineup bolsters Stanford's chances
to come out on top at the NCAA champi
onships.
"His biggest asset, whether he had the
wrist injury or not, is his mental toughness,"
Coach Ray told gostanford.com of Bramlett.
"And that really had to hold some weight
over the last couple years because he's run
the gamut of emotions," Ray added. "All the
things that run through your mind if you're a
premier athlete being pulled away from your
sport, he's had to deal with. And he's handled
it with a lot of character."
The Trojans won three matches at the top
of the lineup, enough for an overall victory.
T.J. Vogel defeated Kim, 2 and 1, Steve Lim
bested Ziegler, 4 and 3, and Martin Trainer
earned a 1-up victory over DeDecker.
After falling out of the championship
bracket, Stanford suffered a 3.5-1.5
loss against lowa. Bramlett halved
his match with Chris Brant and
Kearney defeated Bradley George
for the Cardinal's only points of the
day.
In the seventh place match Stan
ford fell to the tenth seeded San

Diego Toreros 3-2. Bramlett defeated
Jason Shano, 6 and 4, and Ziegler beat
Kenneth McCready 3 and 2. Kim,
DeDecker and Kearney all lost their
respective matches.
Stanford will have an opportunity
to redeem itself this weekend at the
Arizona State Thunderbird Invita
tion, which is also held at the Ritz-
Carlton Golf Course, Dove Moun
tain.
