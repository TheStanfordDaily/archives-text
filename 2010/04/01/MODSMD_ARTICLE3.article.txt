# Census arrives on campus
## Census effort tackles "hard-to-count" Stanford 
### TROY YANG STAFF WRITER 
"Census Day" has arrived, and the Palo Alto
Census Office has been preparing for many months
to count the populations in the 194 census tracts for
which it is responsible including Stanford, a
"hard-to-count" area based on 2000 census statis
tics.
Participation in the 2010 census may sound sim
ple it involves filling out a form and mailing it
back to the Census Office but huge resources are
necessary to carry out this once-in-a-decade opera
tion.
Obstacles in past years have included mobile
populations like the homeless, language and culture
barriers and misconceptions about the count. And
participation among populations living in large in
stitutions for example, the student population at
Stanford have historically seen low rates.
"There are so many different kinds of neighbor
hoods that each one has its own challenge," said
Tom Banks, the assistant manager for field opera
tions at the Palo Alto Census Office. "Stanford it
self is a challenge. Most universities are. Students
are incredibly bright, and they're very focused on
the incredibly hard task of getting through Stan
ford."
Educating international students about partici
pation is another challenge. Banks said.
"Many of the people from overseas don't realize
that the census applies to everyone over here, not
just citizens," Banks said. "Many international stu
dents get the form, think it doesn't apply to them
and just throw it away."
Privacy is another concern, said Lisa Knochen
hauer, a staffer at the Census Office.
"Everybody understands the concept of what
the census is pretty quickly," Knochenhauer said.

but "there are some pretty sophisticated privacy
concerns ... the approach I've taken involves deal
ing with the administration."
The University does not allow census employ
ees to enter student residences.
"We want to ensure that our safety and security
standards of our houses remain as our students ex
pect them to," said Cora Gerdes, the associate dean
of Residential Education central operations. "So
the census is providing us with all the envelopes
that contain the census forms and Residential Edu
cation staff are passing them out to our students,
collecting from our students and then giving them
back to the census."
Residential assistants (RAs) have been official
ly deputized by the Census Office and have taken a
confidentiality oath, allowing them to handle confi
dential information.
Meanwhile, the Census Office has responded to
hard-to-count populations by dividing their job
into two groups Partnership and Field Opera
tions.
Partnership is in charge of community outreach,
including familiarizing communities, especially
those with low response rates, with the census
process. Field Operations, on the other hand, is con
cerned with counting forms, personally visiting
people who did not submit a form and running spe
cial operations at institutions like jails, hospitals
and dormitories, where mail does not work espe
cially well.
Each group is specifically equipped to handle a
variety of challenges: for example, outreach mes
sages have been translated into 59 languages.
Census forms are set to be distributed to stu
dents on April 5 and should be returned to RAs by
April 12, officials said.
