### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Since spring break, four groups have
officially announced their endorsements
for various ASSU candidates, and more

The Green Alliance for Innovative Ac
tion (GAlA),the Jewish Student Associa
tion (JSA), the Women's Coalition and
Stanford Colleges Against Cancer have
released their lists, and at least seven other
groups are expected to follow before vot
ing officially opens April 8.
Every year, groups select the candi
dates they would like to see in office.
Though links for the endorsing groups are

listed on the ASSU Elections Commis
sion Web site, the Commission does not
regulate the endorsing process itself.
Selections are based on application
processes specific to each endorsing
group, but generally involve some combi
nation of questionnaire and interview.
Groups can endorse as many candidates
at any level as they choose.
For the executive race, Angelina Car
dona 'll and Kelsei Wharton 'l2 have al
ready picked up endorsements from both
GAIA and the Women's Coalition. The
No-Rain Campaign of Katherine Fleflin
'll and Daniel Leifer 'lO received the
Stanford Colleges Against Cancer en
dorsement.

"We were looking for candidates that
were both knowledgeable about current
women's issues in campus and had a con
crete plan for how they wanted to im
proved the quality of life for women on
campus," wrote Paula de los Angeles 'lO, a
member of the Women's Coalition selec
tion committee, in an e-mail to The Daily.
According to de los Angeles, the exec
utive slates were asked questions ranging
from their history with women's issues to
Judicial Affairs' handling of sexual assault
to the creation of a cabinet chair for
women's issues. The process consisted of
initial application and call-back inter
views.
The Women's Coalition endorsed
20 Senate candidates, including fresh
men Khaled Alshawi, Katie Cromack,
Madeline Hawes, Deepa Kannappan,
Daniel Khalessi, Jason Lupatkin, Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis, Edouard Ne
giar, Robin Perani, Rebecca Sachs,
Kamil Saeid, Percia Safar, Rahul Sas
try, Will Seaton (also a Daily contribut
ing writer), Bennett Siegel, Carolyn
Simmons, Juany Torres, Noemi Walze
buck and Showly Wang, and sopho
more Rafael Vasquez.
The "So-phresh" sophomore class
president slate of Joel Aguero, Imani
Franklin, Elise Geithner and Thomas
Hendee also picked up a Women's
Coalition endorsement.
GAIA, a coalition of Energy Cross
roads,lDEAS.Engineers for a Sustain
able World, Students for a Sustainable
Stanford and the Stanford Solar Wind
Energy Project, chose candidates who
demonstrated a strong commitment to

campus sustainability. GAIA selec
tions were based on an application and
second-round interview.
In addition to its endorsement of
Cardona and Wharton, GAIA en
dorsed Senate candidates Alshawi, in
cumbent Michael Cruz 'l2, Hawes,
Ben Jensen 'l2, Macgregor-Dennis,
Nikola Milanovic 'll (also a Daily
columnist), Sachs, Sastry, Seaton and
Simmons.
Unlike the Women's Coalition and
GAIA, Stanford Colleges Against
Cancer (CAC) used a name-blind ap
plication process, looking for "candi
dates with thoughtful, creative ap
proaches to improving student
health," according to CAC co-presi
dent Stacy Kaufman 'll.
Senate hopefuls Sachs, Safar, Sim
mons, Torres and Walzebuck were en
dorsed by CAC.
The Jewish Student Association
also released their Senate endorse
ment list: Lupatkin, Milanovic, Sachs,

ford Daily will publish their endorse
ments on April 5. The Stanford Con
