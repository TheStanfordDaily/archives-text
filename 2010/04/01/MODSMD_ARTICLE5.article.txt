## Big-name speakers to adress Obama's presidency 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
David Podesta, the chairman of
President Obama's transition team
and former Clinton chief of staff, is set
to speak today in "Justice and the
Obama Presidency," a new political
science course.

David Kennedy, a Stanford history
professor, is also set address the stu
dents.

The one-unit class offered this
spring is advertised as "reflecting on
the politics and policies of the first year
of the Obama presidency, with atten
tion to implications for the 2010
midterm election," and has two-hour
lectures on Thursday nights. Also on
the schedule are political heavy
weights Speaker of the House Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Steve Schmidt,
who managed the 2008 campaign of

Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.).
The class will focus on social justice
issues, covering topics such as educa
tion, economic policy, health care, civil
rights and foreign policy. Students are
encouraged to participate in a class
blog.

Political Science Prof Rob Reich
Ph.D. '9B, who also teaches the IHUM
course "Freedom, Equality, Differ
ence," is teaching the Obama course
along with comparative studies in race
& ethnicity lecturer James Steyer J.D.
'B3.

This is not the first time Reich and
Steyer have taught together. In fall
2008, they co-taught "Justice at Home
and Abroad," which will be offered
again this fall. Steyer also is currently
co-teaching "The Changing Face of
America" with Dean of Freshmen and
Undergraduate Advising Julie Lyth
cott-Haims 'B9.
They both see the course as an op
portunity for the Stanford community
to discuss important social issues.
"We want to motivate students to
be engaged with social justice issues,
no matter what their political view
point is," Steyer said. "We want to in
spire students to become leaders."
Juany Torres 'l3 decided to take
this class after attending a Structured

Liberal Education lecture by Reich.
"He had a great impact on me,"
Torres said. "He made me realize
what college was all about. The pro
fessors are really going to make you
think."
Torres wishes the class size were
smaller so the students could have
more intimate discussions. But, she
said, "I'm just fortunate to be in it."
Torres is indeed lucky, as accord
ing to teaching assistant Henry Tsai
TO, there is currently a long wait list.
The class is set to meet in Bishop Au
ditorium at the Graduate School of
Business.
