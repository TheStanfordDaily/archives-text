## Postal Service looks to scale back delivery 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
Last Wednesday, the United States Postal Ser
vice (USPS) formally proposed scaling back mail
delivery to five days a week from six. Citing a "tip
ping point" in its future, the service said it would
save $3.3 billion with the plan if it were imple
mented.

The U.S. Postal Service is proposing scaling back delivery
services from the current six days a week to just
five. The campus post office's pickup and delivery
service would be affected if the change is approved.
over the weekend would not be
processed until Monday, the Stan
ford branch would reportedly re
main open.

Stanford's office operations are
currently limited on Saturdays:
post office boxes can be accessed at
all times, but package pick-up is
limited to between 10 a.m. and 2
p.m. If the plan goes into effect, stu
dents could see delays in scheduled
delivery dates, but there has been
no announcement as to whether or
not the branch would simply close
on the weekends.
Frank Wolak, an economics pro
fessor from the University of Illi
nois, conducted a study in 2008 that
found household demand for USPS
services has been reduced by the
Internet explosion and increases in
postage prices.
"I think what the postmaster
general said is that the Postal Ser
vice for the 21st century is clearly

going to be a dramatically different
one than the one that existed in the
20th century," Wolack said in an in
terview with PBS.
"It's going to be significantly
smaller, just because of the fact that
there are so many alternatives," he
added.
Saturday is typically the slowest
day of the week for mail delivery,
according to a USPS news release.
In a Gallup poll earlier this month,
69 percent of Americans polled
said they would be fine without
weekend deliveries if it meant sta
ble stamp prices.
The Postal Service proposed
eliminating a day of delivery once
before but was denied by Congress.
The proposal must pass through the
Postal Regulatory Commission,
where a hearing is scheduled next
week. Congress must also approve
the proposal.
If both organizations approve
the change, it would go into effect
at the beginning of the 2011 fiscal
year.
