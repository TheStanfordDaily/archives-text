A recent survey conducted
on campus has shown
that 32 percent of Stan
ford undergrad iPhone
users are concerned
about becoming "one of those
iPhone people."
You know who you are.
Apple's iPhone has made quite
the splash in our tech-savvy, Silicon
Valley campus, with several courses
specifically devoted to the creation
of apps. As a result, iPhone addicts
abound.

"Practically everyone in my
dorm has one," said Annie Smartt
'l3. "I have had my iPhone for three
years now, and it has become like a
third arm for me. I rely on it com
pletely. It is the only reason why I am
not overwhelmed by the massive
amounts of Stanford e-mails."
This reliance on the device has
not gone unnoticed by psychology
researchers.

Tanya Luhrmann, a Stanford
professor in both the anthropology
and psychology departments, found
a curious relationship between stu
dents and their iPhones as illustrat
ed by a May 2009 survey done by her
graduate Research Methods class.
The questions were based on exten
sive interviews with 200 randomly
selected undergraduates and gradu
ate users of iPhones.

According to the results of the
survey, 24 percent of students said
that the iPhone seemed like an ex
tension of their brain or being, 75
percent said that they had fallen
asleep with their iPhone in their bed
and seven percent admitted to hav
ing a roommate or partner express
abandonment as a result of their
iPhone use (i.e. called themselves an
"iPhone widow.")
"People with iPhones get very,

very attached," Luhrmann said.
"They describe themselves as ad
dicted, and they exhibit [...] anthro
pomorphism they sometime pat
and name their phone, even though
they don't always admit it on a sur
vey."

Molly Spaeth 'll, who has writ
ten for The Daily, doesn't consider
herself a die-hard iPhone addict, but
she knows the telltale signs. And
she's guilty of some of them.
"I feel like my iPhone has con
tributed to the ease in which I ma
neuver new situations," Spaeth said,
citing her use of Google maps. "I
know what those iPhone people
look like because I've seem them on
their iPhones. And I do not consider
myself that kind of iPhone user."
But Spaeth has some common
iPhone addiction symptoms. Exhibit
A: a desire to name her iPhone. She
had, as of this interview, tentatively
settled on either Giselle or Manzana.

"I like that I am part of the popu
lation that uses the iPhone because
we can bond over the 'Bump' app,"
she added.

But, of course, there still is a large
population of Stanford students
without iPhones. Among the
iPhone-less, some students have de
veloped their own vernacular for
poking fun at iPhone users. Some
have taken a subtle approach, sign
ing their e-mails off with a simple
sting: "Sent from your iPhone." Oth
ers have opted for sharper jabs:
"Sent while ißate," "Sent while on
ißuprofen" or "Sent after watching
your mom's face iMplode."
"I think if you're at that point
where you're worried about becom
ing addicted [to your iPhone], it's
too late," said iPhone user Krista
Doersch 'll.

One sign of addiction, she contin
ued, could be using the iPhone when
more interactive social behavior
seems to be required.

"It's not that hard to be a normal
person and not use it all the time, but
so many people pull out their
iPhones to avoid weird situations,"
she said.
Spaeth agreed that iPhone use
seems to have a positive correlation
with awkward settings.
"It's a tool to use in situations
where the [iPhone users] feel un
comfortable," Spaeth said. "Instead
of addressing said situation, they
turn to their iPhone as a distraction,
like the people at parties who play
games on their iPhones instead of
interacting with actual human be

ings."
iPhone owner Cameron Poter 'll
had his own take on what constitutes
an iPhone addiction.
"When you find yourself sliding
your fingers across the air as you
would when trying to change
screens on an iPhone in public,
when trying to remove yourself
from an awkward situation, you're
iPhone addicted," he said.
But beyond their function as so
cial lifeboats and organizational
tools, iPhones are just plain cool.
"I actually try to use it for pro
ductive things; the iPhone is great

for using applications like Yelp or
for getting directions while on the
road," Doersch said. "But I do play
Sudoku and Unblock Me, and it's
great for texting in class."
And in many respects, the iPhone
has definite Stanford-specific perks.
"As a freshman, the iStanford
app is crucial to finding all my class
es and the right buildings," said Vic
toria Kennedy 'l3. "And it's easy to
get and send e-mails, which helps so
much for class while on the go."
