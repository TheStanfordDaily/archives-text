## HOPE AMIDST THE RUBBLE 
### ERIKA ALVERO 
In the early morning of Feb. 27,
2010, at 3:34 a.m. Chilean time,
the slumbering inhabitants of
the city of Concepcion awoke
to the tremors of an 8.8 magni
tude earthquake. The tremors rip
pled along the ground, leaving dev
astation and catastrophe in their
wake, as buildings and bridges top
pled all the way to the city of Santia
go, 325 kilometers away from Con
cepcion.

"When we came back to the city,
my house didn't have electricity for
three days," recalled Katherine
Donner 'll, who was studying at the
Stanford in Santiago program when
the earthquake hit. "I was staying
with a host family with four kids,
who were supposed to start school
on Monday, but all school was post
poned for a week. Universities, ele
mentary schools, high schools, all of
them."

On the night of Feb. 27, Donner
and 11 other students were staying
in cabanas in La Serena, a beachside
city six hours north of Santiago. Be
cause of their removed distance, the
earthquake's reverberations were
very faint and went unnoticed by all
but two members of the group.
"I actually slept through it!"
Donner recalled.
The students found out about the
full catastrophe through the iPhone
of Cameron Holt 'l2, whose parents
warned the students to abandon the
beach as soon as possible in case of a
tsunami onslaught, catalyzed by the
monstrous earthquake. At 5:30 a.m.,
still shaking sleep from their eyes,
the 12 Stanford students trudged the
half hour walk to the bus station in
the middle of La Serena to journey
away from a tsunami that never ar
rived.

When they arrived in Santiago,
the sight that greeted them was
starkly different from that of the
scarcely changed town they had left.
Rubble was strewn all over the
streets, much of it from houses had
crumbled to the ground, and roofs
and ceilings lay around the neigh
borhoods.

"We were staying in Las Condes,
which is a much nicer area of Santi
ago, and the buildings there were
pretty much all stable," Donner said.
"There were a couple of old church
es that got really damaged, but over
all everyone was fine. Then in the
outskirt cities like Lo Prado, the
houses collapsed on the inside. So
some of them looked fine on the
outside, but on the inside the walls
had collapsed."
The students joined a group that
operates in the spirit of Habitat for
Humanity called "Un Techo para
Chile" (A Roof for Chile). As volun
teers, they took the metro up to Lo
Prado, an area is dire need of aid, to
offer their services.
Stanford students met and be-

friended throngs of local high school
and college students who were free
from school for a week who also
joined the relief effort.

"1 know a lot of folks in the Stan
ford community are worried about
us down here in Santiago, and it
would be great to show them anoth
er image of Chile than what they've
been seeing on the news," wrote
Aidan Dunn 'll, another student
studying in Santiago, as quoted in
the Stanford Report.
The community came together to
support one another, both physical
ly and emotionally. During work
breaks, games of soccer (or futbol in
Chile) with the local children broke
out, uniting both volunteers and vic
tims. Families would stop by the
workers' stations and drop off liters
of Coca-Cola bottles and plenty of
fruit and water to show their appre
ciation.

The volunteers' main task was to
clear the rubble from the street and

put it in giant dumpsters. Using
shovels, they continued working
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and by the end
of the day they were covered in de
bris and dust. Witnessing one family
beginning to rebuild its original
house, the group came to under
stand why the buildings had col
lapsed in the first place.
"It was basically plywood," Don
ner said. "It was no wonder that they
weren't withstanding in the first
place they weren't built to last.
The people in the area just don't
have the money or infrastructure to
build good houses."
Stanford engineering professor
Eduardo Miranda traveled to both
Haiti and Chile to compare the dam
age inflicted by the earthquakes in
both countries. As an engineer, his
concern was in analyzing the results
of both disasters and understanding
the implications for building con
struction in both locations. In his
point of view, Chile's buildings were

fairly well protected from earth
quakes, especially compared to
those of Haiti.
"In Chile, the biggest lesson is the
success of earthquake resistant de
sign," said Miranda in an interview
with Stanford Report. "This earth
quake shows us how structures that
have been designed according to
current codes are capable of sustain
ing earthquakes without collapse,
protecting the lives of occupants."
Not all of the buildings in the
Santiago area, however, were built
to current codes, as the Stanford stu
dents discovered. Though the death
toll of 452 Chileans cannot compare
to the 220,000 deaths in Haiti, it nev
ertheless remains a sizeable num
ber.
The damage and aftermath of the
earthquake continues to blight the
country, particularly affecting Santi
ago's international airport, which is
vital to the nation's economy. The
terminal is a mere cluster of white
tents, and passengers must wait for
their planes outside.
Despite the horrific nature of the

Chilean earthquake, it nevertheless
inspired great feelings of cama
raderie both within and beyond
Chile.

"Afterwards it was a really cool
thing to see the whole country come
together," Donner said. "There was
writing on the buses that said
'Fuerte Chile' (Strong Chile) and
'Vamos Chile' (Let's Go, Chile) and
everyone hung up a Chilean flag.
Even in Buenos Aires, there were
flyers about helping Chile. So the ef
fort was all over South America."
