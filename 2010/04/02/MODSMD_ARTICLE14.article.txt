## PUBLIC COLUMN Understanding the Editorial Board 
### ANDREW VALENCIA Chair of the Editorial Board KAMIL DADA President Editor in Chief 
This coming Monday, April 5, the Edito
rial Board of The Stanford Daily will
publish its endorsement of an executive
slate for the April 8 ASSU student election.
Making an endorsement of an executive slate
is a responsibility and privilege that the Edi
torial Board does not take lightly. The ap
proaching election, more so than any in re
cent years, has yielded no clear frontrunners,
and much of the student body remains unde
cided about the different executive slates.
With this in mind. The Daily's Editorial
Board hopes to offer students an informed
suggestion on which slate would be most effec
tive in the executive office. Before we run The
Editorial Board's endorsement, however, we
feel it is pertinent to give the student body a
clear idea of exactly what the Editorial Board
is and how the endorsement process works.
The Editorial Board currently consists of
five board members and the Chair of the Edi
torial Board. As a collective body, it discusses
issues relevant to the entire Stanford commu
nity and, based on points of mutual consent,
lays out the arguments that run in the editori
als published in the Opinions section of The
Daily. Members of the board take alternating
turns writing out the editorials, and the Chair
of the Editorial Board makes revisions and
fits the editorials for publication. The Chair of
the Editorial Board receives a small stipend
for his or her work, while the rest of the board
members serve voluntarily.
In addition to clarifying what the Editorial
Board is, we also wish to reiterate what the
Editorial Board is not the Editorial Board
does not serve as an editorial extension of The
Stanford Daily News section, nor any other
part of the newspaper's organization. The
board does not take cues, or even suggestions,
from the rest of The Daily. The board gener
ates its own content and acts as an independ
ent body, the purpose being to prevent the
news side of The Daily from influencing the
editorial side, and vice versa. With regard to
The Daily's coverage of the election, the Edi
torial Board's endorsement will not have any

impact on the The Daily's news coverage, nor
will the News section influence which slate the
board endorses on Monday.
Of the six current members of the Editori
al Board, two members Tiq Chapa 'lO and
Ishan Nath 'l2 will not be participating in
the executive endorsement due to conflicts of
interest with other areas of the election. The
endorsement will then be decided by the re
maining members of the board Ashley
Artmann 'l2, Cameron Drake 'lO and Ana
Diaz-Hernandez 'll, as well as the current
Chair of the Editorial Board, Andrew Valen
cia 'lO. The Editorial Board will hold thirty
minute interview sessions with the executive
slates this Saturday, and then will reach a con
sensus of which slate most deserves our sup
port in the election. Stanford Daily President
and Editor in Chief Kamil Dada 'll will ob
serve the interviews as a representative of the
organization, but will not participate in the
discussion or influence the board's decision in
any way.
Of the six slates running for the ASSU ex
ecutive, four are currently seeking the Editor
ial Board's endorsement the slates of Car
dona/Wharton, Peacock/Bakke, Thorn and
Stephanie and the No Rain Campaign have all
submitted applications to be considered for
our endorsement and have agreed to be inter
viewed.
Regardless of which executive slate the
Editorial Board chooses to endorse on Mon
day, the Stanford community can be assured
that the Editorial Board and The Stanford
Daily organization have taken measures nec
essary to ensure that each of the four slates is
given fair and unbiased consideration. The
final decision of which slate the board will en
dorse will be made with only the greatest ben
efit of the Stanford community in mind.
