# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## Educating Through Service-learning 
### Aysha Bagchi 
Service-learning is in vogue these days.
With a majority of Stanford students en
gaging in some kind of service, it is no
wonder we hear the praises of public service
and service-learning from official voices regu
larly. Nonetheless, I sometimes wonder
whether the value of service experiences is
fully appreciated by all students and particu
larly by our faculty. Most of our faculty mem
bers do not spend much time emphasizing stu
dent service activity outside the classroom,
leaving students to wonder: is this just a differ
ence in values?

Many assume that public service is for
young people. In a sense, this is easily under
standable: faculty who are pioneering the ini
tiatives and research that are ultimately cru
cial in the public service arena do not need to
be distributing vaccines in Tanzania in order
to feel that they are making a difference. Fur
thermore, faculty are much more likely to
have families or other priorities that take
precedence. But I do not think these situation
al differences are enough to explain the di
vide.

Part of the problem may be that service
was not a big part of most undergraduate ex
periences when our professors were under
grade yet most of them feel that they received
wonderful educations. In addition, some pro
fessors may fear that student engagement
with public service comes at the expense of the
learning that takes place in the classroom or
may blind us to how our education helps us
help others. These are reasonable concerns,
but student frustration with the idea of re
stricting ourselves to a theoretical environ
ment that can seem so distant from urgent
problems is also legitimate, and professors
would benefit from appreciating its merits.
The most neglected attribute of service
learning is the degree to which service makes
people more emotionally perceptive, enhanc
ing our ability to empathize and discern the
various moral claims surrounding an issue.
The easiest example of this I can think of is
my service-learning Alternative Spring Break
trip last week studying immigration in Ari
zona with 12 other students. One of the most
emotional moments came when we encoun
tered three migrants while collecting trash on
migrant trails in the desert. These three men
crossed in a group of 20 who were later dis
persed by border patrol. They had not eaten in
two days, were still less than halfway through
the desert after three days and one of them
was trying to return to his wife and two chil
dren in Tucson after having been deported.
Another emotional experience was seeing a
handful of young Guatemalan girls around 11
years old escorted into the migrant detention
center in Douglas, Ariz, after being appre
hended in the U.S. desert. Our group also

spoke with border patrol officers who work
hard to stop illegal crossing and drug traffick
ing across the border. We heard from undocu
mented students at Arizona State University
who were brought here as children and spoke
of seeking the opportunity to reach for their
own dreams.

None of these emotional experiences
alone answered any of my policy questions
about immigration. For that, I would need to
know a lot more about numbers, causes, costs,
risks, spillover effects and trade-offs, not to
mention the need to develop the analytical
tools to decipher and weigh different argu
ments in the debate. What my service-learning
experience did was help me to gain some
moral orientation, to better understand the
immigration debate by apprehending the
emotional concerns that create a moral dis
pute in the first place. I appreciate the moral
dispute better because I have a sense of the
risk migrants are willing to take in trekking
through the desert, I have some understand
ing of how natives feel when the Phoenix cul
tural landscape is transforming before their
eyes, and I can better imagine what it feels like
to be a student in fear of deportation every
day. I bring this appreciation of the problem to
the table when my professor discusses ethical
standards and policy solutions and I now
apprehend to a fuller extent what rights and
violations are in play.
My favorite high school teacher used to say
that the last thing he wanted was for his stu
dents to feel like vessels into which informa
tion is poured. He envisioned education as an
interactive process, one in which students take
responsibility in ways that force increased en
gagement. Student participation in public
service goes well beyond infusing student life
with passion and purpose (though that alone
is enough to justify it). Service experiences lay
the foundation for taking advantage of all a
Stanford education has to offer us. They open
a window to the problems we must appreciate
in order to fairly and fully address them. Ser
vice is a crucial part of the academic enterprise
and deserves regard and emphasis from pro
fessors and students alike.
