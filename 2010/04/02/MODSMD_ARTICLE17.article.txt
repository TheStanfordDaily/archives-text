# MIDNIGHT FRYER
## "I'm Not Ready for a Relationship" 
### Yanran Lu 
On an unsuspecting Friday morning, I
ran to Vaden in slippers and PJs to pay
my weekly homage to my therapist.
There he was, the "sketchy" grad student that
I have not seen in a year, still as handsome as
I remembered with his amber eyes and in
genuous smile. I smiled back, waved and sat
down next to him. As we slowly bridged the
year-long gap, it surprised me to realize in in
creased clarity how we could never be to
gether despite how "perfect" we are for each
other. It was not because that he was too old
for me or is in a different stage of life, but how
with all the free will in the world, he chose to
not be with me, which, no matter how "per
fect" a man is, is reason enough for him to not
be worth my time.
This fact took me years to realize. I have
always heard the saying that in order to be
loved you have to love yourself. Yet some
how I have settled to be with men who are
too busy for me, who have time for procrasti
nation but not time for me; I have settled for
men who "are not ready for a relationship"
in fact, I've heard enough guys say, "I'm
not ready for a relationship" and then have a
girlfriend and so wonder if I am cursed like
Chuck from the movie Good Luck Chuck. If
one were to sleep with Chuck, one would be
able to find Mr. Right, and with me, one finds
Ms. I-Want-to-Have-a-Relationship-With. I
spent so much time wondering if there is any
thing that I could do so the person could fall
in love with me if I could just be sexier or
wittier or smarter or some elusive secret in
gredient x-er. But no matter how hard I try,
they are completely oblivious and continue
to treat me with their half-assed attitudes
with unlimited smirks thrown in as a bonus
deal while I beat myself up for not being lov
able enough. After some of these brutal real
ity TV show reruns, I realized that they are
just saying, "I'm not ready for a relationship
with YOU," pronouncing the " with YOU"
part silently. So trying to change their mind
and make them fall in love with me was like
trying to convert a Fundamental Christian to
an Atheist frustrating and, for the most
part, futile.

A friend of mine had a similar experience.
She was once with a guy who never went
down on her and thought that he must just
not do "that." But after a night spent hearing
another woman moaning and screaming in
ecstasy with him on the other side of the wall,
she realized that he just chose to not give the
attention to her. It was a good realization

instead of wasting more time on him, she fo
cused on finding someone who is better for
her and she did. Not only are she and her
boyfriend very in love with each other and
treating each other with respect, they went
on a competition to see who can give each
other more orgasms a game perhaps none
of us mind taking part in. So after hearing her
story, I thought, "wow, there might still be
hope for singles like me!"
With this new perspective, I wondered
why I keep wasting energy on people who
choose to be assholes to me and break my
heart? While I obsessed with being the "per
fect low-maintenance girl," I forgot to de
mand the attention and treatment I de
served. He got exactly what he wanted while
I was left feeling deeply unsatisfied and un
happy. Why was I trading off my happiness so
a person who did not care about me can have
his ways and laugh at my gullibility? Think
ing back, I had petty reasons such as "he's
cute/smart/has a perfect six-pack that is more
like a 'sex'-pack" to answer for myself. None
of which, nor the summation of which, out
weighs the fatal flaw of his not treating me
properly. So I said, "Fuck it you are not
worth my precious time, Ciao!"
Just like that (and with some withdrawal
symptoms), I gave up on "projects" and
"jerks," and I hope you would too if you have
not done so already (vice versa for guys). Be
cause at the end of the day, even though I am
single, I can still say that I feel good about
myself and that I love myself. I am not letting
myself be with someone who makes me feel
negligible. Sometimes I even thank the guys
who have been jerks to me because with
out them having been jerks, I might still be
stuck with these guys and not be receptive to
someone truly good for me. And perhaps I
should also be thankful for my incessant
wealth of optimism because after so many
heartbreaks, I still look forward to love and
have not given up hope.

Somehow I have
settled to be with men
who are too busy for me,
who have time for
procastination but not
time for me; I have
settled for men who "are
not ready for a
relationship"
