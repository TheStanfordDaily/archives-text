## BATTLE ATOP THE PAC- 10 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 12 Stanford women's tennis team
(13-1,2-0 Pac-10) will welcome No. 18 South
ern California (11-6, 3-0 Pac-10) and No. 7
UCLA (16-2,3-0 Pac-10) to Taube this week
end in a matchup of three teams undefeated in
conference play.
The Women of Troy have been ranked as
high as No. 7 in the nation, while the Bruins
were responsible for Stanford's sole loss this
season; however, only this matchup will count
towards the conference record. With Stanford
looking to defend a 158-match home winning
streak and the women looking for a win to
propel them into the last few weeks of the sea
son, the next few days could prove vital.
"When we went down there, we weren't
ready for that kind of match," said junior Hi
lary Barte. "We hadn't seen all the other
teams, and it was our first tough test. The next
couple of times, though, you're more ready
and you know what it takes. I think they're in
for a surprise."
To date, Stanford has dominated nearly all
of its opponents. No score has been closer
than 5-2, and while their one loss to UCLA
was a tough 6-1 defeat, the women responded
positively to upset Cal soon after and reeled
off their first sweep of Pac-10 schools this past
weekend. The team has four players in the top
70, led by Barte's No. 8 ranking. Stanford also
has two doubles teams ranked in the top 35.
Barte and senior Lindsay Burdette hold the
No. 2 ranking, while freshmen Mallory Bur
dette and Stacey Tan are ranked No. 34.
The Cardinal faces USC on Friday in their
first matchup of the season. The team has
three players ranked in the top 30 in the most
recent polls and are led by second-ranked
Maria Sanchez. In doubles, Sanchez and team
mate Danielle Lao are ranked No. 46, with the
Trojans' other two pairs ranked 62nd and
63rd. USC is coming off its own sweep of Pac
-10 opponents when it defeated both Washing
ton State, 7-0, and No. 19 Washington, 5-2.
USC earned its first victory over Stanford in
23 years last season when they defeated the
Cardinal 5-2 at USC, snapping a 50-match win
streak.
"I know that USC has been struggling this
year," Barte said. "That's interesting, but that
kind of stuff flies out the window when we are
set to play each other. It's going to be tough
like it's always tough when you face rivals."
Perhaps the most compelling matchup of
the weekend will occur at the No. 1 singles
spot as Stanford's Barte takes on USC's
Sanchez. Barte has posted a 14-2 record
against nationally ranked opponents and is
now on a 17-match winning streak. Mean
while, Sanchez has proven she has the advan
tage over top-10 players. She hasn't lost to one
all season.
"She's full of confidence, obviously," Barte
said of her upcoming opponent. "Especially
since I got her earlier in the year, she's going to
be fired up. Taking care of holding serve to
morrow will be key, and just trying to get my
breaks and when I do, hold[ing] onto
them."
Barte was recently named Pac-10 Player of
the Week for her play over the weekend. She
won all her matches in singles and doubles
against Arizona, Arizona State and Pepper
dine. This is the fourth time in her career she
has won and the second for a Stanford player
this year; Lindsay Burdette won the award for
the week of February 1.
"It was cool," Barte said. "I actually didn't
know until everyone sent me texts about it,
but I thought it was a good reflection of the
spring break trips."
UCLA, meanwhile, will provide an oppor
tunity for a measure of revenge for the Cardi-

use

recent polls and are led by second-ranked
Maria Sanchez. In doubles, Sanchez and team
mate Danielle Lao are ranked No. 46, with the
Trojans' other two pairs ranked 62nd and
63rd. USC is coming off its own sweep of Pac
-10 opponents when it defeated both Washing
ton State, 7-0, and No. 19 Washington, 5-2.
USC earned its first victory over Stanford in
23 years last season when they defeated the
Cardinal 5-2 at USC, snapping a 50-match win
streak.
"I know that USC has been struggling this
year," Barte said. "That's interesting, but that
kind of stuff flies out the window when we are
set to play each other. It's going to be tough
like it's always tough when you face rivals."
Perhaps the most compelling matchup of
the weekend will occur at the No. 1 singles
spot as Stanford's Barte takes on USC's
Sanchez. Barte has posted a 14-2 record
against nationally ranked opponents and is
now on a 17-match winning streak. Mean
while, Sanchez has proven she has the advan
tage over top-10 players. She hasn't lost to one
all season.
"She's full of confidence, obviously," Barte
said of her upcoming opponent. "Especially
since I got her earlier in the year, she's going to
be fired up. Taking care of holding serve to
morrow will be key, and just trying to get my
breaks and when I do, hold[ing] onto
them."
Barte was recently named Pac-10 Player of
the Week for her play over the weekend. She
won all her matches in singles and doubles
against Arizona, Arizona State and Pepper
dine. This is the fourth time in her career she
has won and the second for a Stanford player
this year; Lindsay Burdette won the award for
the week of February 1.
"It was cool," Barte said. "I actually didn't
know until everyone sent me texts about it,
but I thought it was a good reflection of the
spring break trips."
UCLA, meanwhile, will provide an oppor
tunity for a measure of revenge for the Cardi-

strategy against the L.A. schools this weekend.
