						MENTOR AND FATHER FIGURE

As a coach, he was a motivator. As
a teacher, he was an inspiration.
As a man, he was a gem. He was
A1 Roderigues, a longtime assis
tant coach of the Stanford men's
volleyball team. Roderigues, called "Big
Al," had been an assistant coach for the Stan
ford men's volleyball team since 1992. Over
those 18 years, he helped Stanford win three
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
titles and the 1997 National Championship. In
18 years on the bench he became the heartbeat
of the Stanford program a leader who
treated the players like sons and brought out
the best in them.
At the end of 2008, Al Roderigues was di
agnosed with terminal stomach cancer. They
told him he had two months to live.
Two weeks ago, on March 19, Roderigues
passed away. He lived over a year longer than
the doctors told him he would.
The people who saw Roderigues during his
final days would all tell you the same thing
he barely showed an ounce of sadness or de
feat. All he showed was the same thing he
showed his entire life simple happiness and
abundant joy.
The Man
An atmosphere of optimism, loyalty and
bliss surrounded Roderigues wherever he went.

"He was that guy and that coach," said
men's volleyball head coach John Kosty.
Kosty described Big Al's role on the team
as that of a mentor and a father figure.
"A1 had a knack to bridge the gap," he said.
"People were attracted to him."
You can't talk to anyone in the volleyball
program without hearing mention of
Roderigues' van rides to away games with the
freshmen. In the current atmosphere where
players and coaches are focused on the sport
and winning, the ability of Roderigues to ditch
the authority figure and take on the father fig
ure was what made him who he was.
Though Roderigues became sick during
last year's season, he was still able to attend
practices and came to some games with a
chemo pack attached to him. He was cheerful
and upbeat. He joked and laughed. His condi
tion was worsening but his attitude was not.
Two months passed, and Roderigues was
still there. He was engaged in a valiant and
courageous battle with the inevitable. The
team knew he wasn't going to capitulate; he
was a fighter.
"During [the 2009 season] he couldn't
make it to many practices," senior opposite
Evan Romero said. "When he did come, he
was more of a symbol he was fighting his
battle and still trying to come and see us."
Eventually Roderigues had to stay at
