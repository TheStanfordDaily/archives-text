# A 						MENTOR AND FATHER FIGURE

As a coach, he was a motivator. As
a teacher, he was an inspiration.
As a man, he was a gem. He was
A1 Roderigues, a longtime assis
tant coach of the Stanford men's
volleyball team. Roderigues, called "Big
Al," had been an assistant coach for the Stan
ford men's volleyball team since 1992. Over
those 18 years, he helped Stanford win three
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
titles and the 1997 National Championship. In
18 years on the bench he became the heartbeat
of the Stanford program a leader who
treated the players like sons and brought out
the best in them.
At the end of 2008, Al Roderigues was di
agnosed with terminal stomach cancer. They
told him he had two months to live.
Two weeks ago, on March 19, Roderigues
passed away. He lived over a year longer than
the doctors told him he would.
The people who saw Roderigues during his
final days would all tell you the same thing
he barely showed an ounce of sadness or de
feat. All he showed was the same thing he
showed his entire life simple happiness and
abundant joy.
The Man
An atmosphere of optimism, loyalty and
bliss surrounded Roderigues wherever he went.

"He was that guy and that coach," said
men's volleyball head coach John Kosty.
Kosty described Big Al's role on the team
as that of a mentor and a father figure.
"A1 had a knack to bridge the gap," he said.
"People were attracted to him."
You can't talk to anyone in the volleyball
program without hearing mention of
Roderigues' van rides to away games with the
freshmen. In the current atmosphere where
players and coaches are focused on the sport
and winning, the ability of Roderigues to ditch
the authority figure and take on the father fig
ure was what made him who he was.
Though Roderigues became sick during
last year's season, he was still able to attend
practices and came to some games with a
chemo pack attached to him. He was cheerful
and upbeat. He joked and laughed. His condi
tion was worsening but his attitude was not.
Two months passed, and Roderigues was
still there. He was engaged in a valiant and
courageous battle with the inevitable. The
team knew he wasn't going to capitulate; he
was a fighter.
"During [the 2009 season] he couldn't
make it to many practices," senior opposite
Evan Romero said. "When he did come, he
was more of a symbol he was fighting his
battle and still trying to come and see us."
Eventually Roderigues had to stay at

home, unable to move very far or very
fast. He was able to make one trip to
Stanford this past January to watch a
match more than 10 months after
the cancer was supposed to have won.
After the game, the players walked up
to the second level of Maples Pavilion
to find him in his wheelchair, greeting
him with handshakes and hugs. He
was beaming with joy. That would be
the last volleyball match he would
ever witness.
The Motto
Roderigues will be remembered
for many things to many people. At
Stanford, he may be best remem
bered for something he began in
2007.
In 2007 the men's volleyball team
finished the season with a 3-25
record, the worst in the MPSF. It was
a low point in the program's history.
The team had talented players but
could not put it all together at once.
"It was pretty demoralizing," sen
ior setter Kawika Shoji said of his
freshman year. "We were in a lot of
matches and came up short in almost
every one. It took a toll on the team. It
was very frustrating as a whole."
Then came Roderigues, who was
adamant that things were going to
change, "Worst to first," he told the
team. He said Stanford was going to
get back to where they were capable
of being. He especially wanted to in
still the motto in the five freshmen,
the future of the program. And
when the heart and soul of the pro
gram is on a mission to turn things
around, then you can't help but go
right with him. Eventually, everyone
believed in him.
2008: a 17-11 record.
"He would reinforce to us that it
was a process, not just a quick out
come," Romero said of his sopho
more year, the first season under the
mantra. "Can't get to first in one year.
He kept us relaxed and focused,
helped us learn from different stum
bling blocks along the way."
2009:21-11.
"He kept the team together emo
tionally," said Shoji. "He was enthusi-

astic, positive and uplifting ... he
kept us together."
When Roderigues was weakening
at the beginning of this season, the
team was strengthening. They would
not let him go without showing him
that they could do it. On March 8,
Stanford rose to the top of the rank
ings for the first time since 2001. They
also were leading the MPSF. That was
it. Roderigues had guided the team
from worst to first. Best of all, he lived
to see it happen.
"He gave us an attainable goal,"
Kosty said. "He knew this team had it
in them. He knew it was possible."
"It was nice to know that he was
able to see us reach that first place
marker," Romero said. Roderigues
passed away just 11 days after Stan
ford's first official No. 1 ranking. They
have not ceded it since.
"The fact that he was able to make
it that far was pretty unbelievable to
the team," Romero continued.
Maybe it was pure destiny for Big
A1 to be able to witness Stanford at
No. 1 when he wasn't supposed to.
Maybe it was his reward for all he had
done for the program and for the
players. Whatever it was, one of the

last moments of his life was seeing
"worst to first" actually come true. It
was perhaps a perfect ending.
The Memory
A1 Roderigues will be remem
bered for his infectious personality,
big heart and his ability to buffer any
tough situation whether with his
cancer or with his team.
"He was uplifting and inspiring,"
Shoji said.
Kosty is keen to point out that Big
Al's work is actually over. His "first"
didn't mean the NCAA title. First
meant being the best team in the
MPSF and the top-ranked in the na
tion, and Stanford has accomplished
that. Everything that Roderigues had
believed in has come true.
"We achieved what he thought we
could," Kosty said. "That's done."
But that's hardly it for Big Al.
Kosty gathered the team a few days
after Al's passing to discuss the past
and the future.
"I told them, we aren't doing any
thing for him anymore. We are doing
things with him ... he'll still be on the
bench."
Over the next month, every bump,
set and spike on the volleyball court
may have some more pop, speed or
precision something extra for
their beloved coach. He will certainly
be with every member of the team
going forward, as "AL" has been sewn
into the right arm of all the players'
jerseys.
And really, how could anyone for
get? He helped turn young players
into stars. He helped bring the team
closer and believe in themselves. He
helped put Stanford volleyball back
on the map.
When asked what he would think
about if he heard the words "Big Al"
in 10 years, the first words that came
out of the team captain and All-
American Shoji's mouth pretty much
sum it all up for the late Al
Roderigues.
"One of my heroes."
Note: There will be a memorial service
for Al Roderigues on Monday, April
19 at 5 p.m. at Stanford's Memorial
Church. The service is open to the
public.

it. Roderigues had guided the team
from worst to first. Best of all, he lived
to see it happen.
"He gave us an attainable goal,"
Kosty said. "He knew this team had it
in them. He knew it was possible."
"It was nice to know that he was
able to see us reach that first place
marker," Romero said. Roderigues
passed away just 11 days after Stan
ford's first official No. 1 ranking. They
have not ceded it since.
"The fact that he was able to make
it that far was pretty unbelievable to
the team," Romero continued.
Maybe it was pure destiny for Big
A1 to be able to witness Stanford at
No. 1 when he wasn't supposed to.
Maybe it was his reward for all he had
done for the program and for the
players. Whatever it was, one of the

last moments of his life was seeing
"worst to first" actually come true. It
was perhaps a perfect ending.
The Memory
A1 Roderigues will be remem
bered for his infectious personality,
big heart and his ability to buffer any
tough situation whether with his
cancer or with his team.
"He was uplifting and inspiring,"
Shoji said.
Kosty is keen to point out that Big
Al's work is actually over. His "first"
didn't mean the NCAA title. First
meant being the best team in the
MPSF and the top-ranked in the na
tion, and Stanford has accomplished
that. Everything that Roderigues had
believed in has come true.
"We achieved what he thought we
could," Kosty said. "That's done."
But that's hardly it for Big Al.
Kosty gathered the team a few days
after Al's passing to discuss the past
and the future.
"I told them, we aren't doing any
thing for him anymore. We are doing
things with him ... he'll still be on the
bench."
Over the next month, every bump,
set and spike on the volleyball court
may have some more pop, speed or
precision something extra for
their beloved coach. He will certainly
be with every member of the team
going forward, as "AL" has been sewn
into the right arm of all the players'
jerseys.
And really, how could anyone for
get? He helped turn young players
into stars. He helped bring the team
closer and believe in themselves. He
helped put Stanford volleyball back
on the map.
When asked what he would think
about if he heard the words "Big Al"
in 10 years, the first words that came
out of the team captain and All-
American Shoji's mouth pretty much
sum it all up for the late Al
Roderigues.
"One of my heroes."
Note: There will be a memorial service
for Al Roderigues on Monday, April
19 at 5 p.m. at Stanford's Memorial
Church. The service is open to the
public.

KAWIKA SHOJI,
senior setter, on the
impact "Big Al"
Roderigues has had
on his life and devel
opment as a player.
As a coach, he was a motivator. As
a teacher, he was an inspiration.
As a man, he was a gem. He was
A1 Roderigues, a longtime assis
tant coach of the Stanford men's
volleyball team. Roderigues, called "Big
Al," had been an assistant coach for the Stan
ford men's volleyball team since 1992. Over
those 18 years, he helped Stanford win three
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
titles and the 1997 National Championship. In
18 years on the bench he became the heartbeat
of the Stanford program a leader who
treated the players like sons and brought out
the best in them.
At the end of 2008, Al Roderigues was di
agnosed with terminal stomach cancer. They
told him he had two months to live.
Two weeks ago, on March 19, Roderigues
passed away. He lived over a year longer than
the doctors told him he would.
The people who saw Roderigues during his
final days would all tell you the same thing
he barely showed an ounce of sadness or de
feat. All he showed was the same thing he
showed his entire life simple happiness and
abundant joy.
The Man
An atmosphere of optimism, loyalty and
bliss surrounded Roderigues wherever he went.

"He was that guy and that coach," said
men's volleyball head coach John Kosty.
Kosty described Big Al's role on the team
as that of a mentor and a father figure.
"A1 had a knack to bridge the gap," he said.
"People were attracted to him."
You can't talk to anyone in the volleyball
program without hearing mention of
Roderigues' van rides to away games with the
freshmen. In the current atmosphere where
players and coaches are focused on the sport
and winning, the ability of Roderigues to ditch
the authority figure and take on the father fig
ure was what made him who he was.
Though Roderigues became sick during
last year's season, he was still able to attend
practices and came to some games with a
chemo pack attached to him. He was cheerful
and upbeat. He joked and laughed. His condi
tion was worsening but his attitude was not.
Two months passed, and Roderigues was
still there. He was engaged in a valiant and
courageous battle with the inevitable. The
team knew he wasn't going to capitulate; he
was a fighter.
"During [the 2009 season] he couldn't
make it to many practices," senior opposite
Evan Romero said. "When he did come, he
was more of a symbol he was fighting his
battle and still trying to come and see us."
Eventually Roderigues had to stay at

home, unable to move very far or very
fast. He was able to make one trip to
Stanford this past January to watch a
match more than 10 months after
the cancer was supposed to have won.
After the game, the players walked up
to the second level of Maples Pavilion
to find him in his wheelchair, greeting
him with handshakes and hugs. He
was beaming with joy. That would be
the last volleyball match he would
ever witness.
The Motto
Roderigues will be remembered
for many things to many people. At
Stanford, he may be best remem
bered for something he began in
2007.
In 2007 the men's volleyball team
finished the season with a 3-25
record, the worst in the MPSF. It was
a low point in the program's history.
The team had talented players but
could not put it all together at once.
"It was pretty demoralizing," sen
ior setter Kawika Shoji said of his
freshman year. "We were in a lot of
matches and came up short in almost
every one. It took a toll on the team. It
was very frustrating as a whole."
Then came Roderigues, who was
adamant that things were going to
change, "Worst to first," he told the
team. He said Stanford was going to
get back to where they were capable
of being. He especially wanted to in
still the motto in the five freshmen,
the future of the program. And
when the heart and soul of the pro
gram is on a mission to turn things
around, then you can't help but go
right with him. Eventually, everyone
believed in him.
2008: a 17-11 record.
"He would reinforce to us that it
was a process, not just a quick out
come," Romero said of his sopho
more year, the first season under the
mantra. "Can't get to first in one year.
He kept us relaxed and focused,
helped us learn from different stum
bling blocks along the way."
2009:21-11.
"He kept the team together emo
tionally," said Shoji. "He was enthusi-

astic, positive and uplifting ... he
kept us together."
When Roderigues was weakening
at the beginning of this season, the
team was strengthening. They would
not let him go without showing him
that they could do it. On March 8,
Stanford rose to the top of the rank
ings for the first time since 2001. They
also were leading the MPSF. That was
it. Roderigues had guided the team
from worst to first. Best of all, he lived
to see it happen.
