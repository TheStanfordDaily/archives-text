## Baseball: UCLA defeats Stanford in walk-off fashion 
### â€“ Kathleen Chaykowski Kabir Sawhney 
Stanford continued its Pac-10
Conference schedule last night after
kicking off a weekend series on the
road at UCLA. Despite hanging
tough with the Bruins all night, the
Cardinal was eventually bested by
the score of 6-5.
No. 2 UCLA (22-0, 1-0 Pac-10)
maintained its undefeated record,
while No. 19 Stanford's (12-8, 2-2
Pac-10) struggles against top
ranked teams continued. Despite
sweeping then-No. 5 Rice at the start
of the season, Card has since failed
to make much of an impact against
top-5 opponents. It was swept by No.
3 Texas in its second series of the
season and faces two more games
against UCLA this weekend.
Stanford managed to keep up
with UCLA's heralded offense for
much of Thursday's contest, howev
er. The teams were tied 1-1 after the
first inning and kept trading runs all

game. The teams were tied 5-5 after
the seventh inning, which is where
the score would remain until the
10th inning.
Stanford failed to generate any
significant offense in the top half of
that inning despite a single and steal
by catcher Zach Jones.
The Bruins, however, were able
to clinch the victory in the bottom of
the 10th inning against junior pitch
er Alex Pracher. A leadoff single by
shortstop Niko Gallego opened the
inning, and he advanced to second
on a sacrifice bunt from catcher
Steve Rodriguez. Designated hitter
Blair Dunlap then singled to center
field, advancing Gallego to third, be
fore he was driven home by a walk
off hit from first baseman Dean
Espy.
While Stanford fell to UCLA,
there were still positives to be taken
from the loss, not least the Card's
ability to compete with the nation's
No. 2 team. Stanford's defense com
mitted no errors, while junior sec
ond baseman Colin Walsh contin

ued his strong hitting with two RBIs
in the game.
Stanford plays the undefeated
Bruins two more times this weekend
in Westwood, Calif. It will take on
UCLA at 6 p.m. tonight before
wrapping up its series on Saturday at
2 p.m.
