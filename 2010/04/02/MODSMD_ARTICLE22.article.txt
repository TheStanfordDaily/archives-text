# Softball: Stanford wins pitcher's duel in 12 innings
## 
### â€“ Kabir Sawhney 
In its first Pac-10 Conference
game of the season, Stanford's soft
ball team did not fail to deliver a
compelling game against cross-Bay
rival California. The No. 9 Cardinal
(26-4,1-0 Pac-10) turned in a classic
12-inning pitcher's duel that saw
both teams combine for a single run.
By the end, Stanford was able to pull
out a 1-0 walk-off win over the
Golden Bears.
The Cardinal earned the victory
thanks to a heroic effort from fresh

man starting pitcher Teagan Ger
hart. She pitched all 12 innings, an
impressive feat in a sport where a
normal game lasts just seven. Even
more incredibly, she allowed just
three hits and five walks while strik
ing out 10 batters out of a total of 45
batters faced.
The defense behind her was also
solid, giving up no errors throughout
the game.
Gerhart also made an impact of
fensively in her four at-bats.
Indeed, Gerhart was critical to
the 12th-inning rally that finally
broke Cal starting pitcher Valerie
Arioto. Gerhart opened the inning
by hitting a single to left field off of
Arioto. Sophomore center fielder
Sarah Hassman then attempted to
bunt Gerhart over to second base
and reached first on an error by Cal
third baseman Vernae Sevilla.
Next, senior left fielder Alissa
Haber grounded out to second base,
giving Cal its first out of the inning.
However, both Hassman and Ger
hart advanced on the play to second

and third respectively. The next bat
ter, sophomore second baseman
Ashley Hansen, was intentionally
walked to load the bases.
With the game on the line, fresh
man shortstop Jenna Rich came to
the plate. She hit a ground ball into
the infield, which the Cal fielders
were unable to deliver to home plate
in time. Gerhart scored on the play,
giving Stanford the win in its first
Pac-10 game of the year.
The Cardinal has two games re
maining this weekend against the
Golden Bears, both at home at
Smith Family Stadium. They will
take on Cal tonight at 7 p.m. and to
morrow at 1 p.m.
