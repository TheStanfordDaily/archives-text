# W. Lacrosse: Stanford edges Hofstra for rain-soaked victory
## 
### â€“ Kabir Sawhney 
In its last match before opening
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) competition this weekend,
the Stanford women's lacrosse team
played a thrilling match at home
against Hofstra. It took three over
times for the No. 11 Cardinal (6-4,0-0
MPSF) to pull out a 14-13 win over
the Pride.
Hofstra wasn't the Cardinal's only
competition both teams had to
contend with driving rain throughout
the game, and conditions worsened as
competition went on.
Though Stanford trailed 9-7 at the
half, the Cardinal battled back to take
an 11-10 lead in the second half. Hof

stra fought back and took a 12-11
lead, before a goal from senior Julie
Christy tied the game at 12-12 and
sent the game into overtime.
In the first overtime, the Pride
took a one-goal lead early before red
shirt junior Lauren Schmidt scored
her fourth goal of the game to tie it at
13-13. The first overtime ended with
the score still tied, sending the game
into sudden-death overtime.
After a hard-fought second over
time in which neither team managed
to score, the teams advanced to a
third overtime period. Midway
through the period, senior Claire
Hubbard scored the final goal of the
game, giving Stanford the win.
Even more importantly, the Cardi
nal will have momentum heading into
this weekend's first MPSF matches

on the road. Today, Stanford will play
Fresno State in Fresno, Calif., before
coming back to the Bay to take on
California in Berkeley, Calif., on Sun
day.
Fresno State should not provide
much of a challenge to the Cardinal.
The Bulldogs (0-7, 0-0 MPSF) have
not won a game yet all season. The
game is also the conference opener
for Fresno State.
Cal (3-6,0-1 MPSF) will provide a
stiffer challenge for Stanford, but
should still fall to the Cardinal. The
Golden Bears lost its first conference
game in February to UC-Davis and
will play its second MPSF game of the
season on Friday against Denver be
fore taking on Stanford.
