# Soccer clubs can go bankrupt
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Am I a bad man? Or at
least a bad fan? My soc
cer team, Reading FC,
is in the midst of a
miraculous turnaround
since the start of the season. In Janu
ary, less than two years after being
relegated from the English Premier
ship, we sat second from bottom in
the Championship. We had won just
one home game in the first half of the
season and we were hot favorites for
dropping down to League 1.
But then our failing manager was
sacked and replaced with the under
19s and reserve team manager, Brian
McDermott. Within a few games we
seemed to be a completely different
team. We knocked Liverpool, a giant
club, out of the FA Cup and proceed
ed to make a run all the way to the
quarterfinals. Our league form was
similarly revived, and we have won
nine out of the last 12 games, climb
ing above mid-table to 11th.
Bad weather and FA Cup com
mitments mean we have two games
in hand over the teams ahead of us
with a total of eight games left in the
season. Winning those outstanding
games would put us in seventh, and
that's when it starts to get interesting.
The top two teams at the end of
the year are automatically promoted
to the Premiership, arguably the
biggest soccer league in the world,
where even the teams struggling at
the very bottom can expect to reap
tens of millions of pounds of TV
money each year. The next four, third
position to sixth, then play in a mini
tournament, with the winner taking
the final promotion spot.
Without a bit of help, Reading
cannot catch any of the top six teams.
With a perfect run to the end of the
season by all these teams, Reading
and the Royals would still sit three
points adrift of sixth place.
I'm certainly hoping for one of
those teams, even my brother's
squad, Leicester City, to have a bad
run and open up a slim chance that
my club could somehow reach the
playoffs. But, there is a bit of a dark
er side to my prayers, too.
Cardiff City, sitting fourth, is in a
lot of financial trouble. They have
debts of millions of pounds to in
vestors and owe huge sums in unpaid
taxes. At the very least there is a good
chance they, as a company, could be
put into administration (essentially,
declared bankruptcy). At most they
could cease to exist.
Administration would mean the
Football League imposing an auto
matic 10-point deduction to Cardiff's
total, dropping them within the
sights of not just Reading, but sever
al other clubs, too. It would probably
end their hopes of making it to the
Premiership, where, ironically, the
extra funds available might be
enough to save them from the dire fi
nancial situation they are currently
in.
Any good soccer fan always talks
about a club going into administra
tion as "bad for football," and the
possibility of the club vanishing en
tirely is a nightmare that no one
wants. But, though Cardiff might
argue that it is the current world fi
nancial crisis that has caused so much
trouble, it is also surely worse to
allow clubs to be completely mis
managed and get away with it.
This is not the banking world, it is
the real world; and no club is too big
to fail.
While Reading was sensibly man
aged to the very point that they
struggled to compete with big spend
ing clubs, the directors or Cardiff
were betting everything, including
the existence of their club, on hitting
the big time.
It is not really a surprise that they
are now is such a bad position. Chair
man Peter Ridsdale drove Leeds
United to the very brink just a few
years ago, and now looks like he may
have done exactly the same with his
new club. Leeds had a long history in
the top tier of English soccer, but
after taking out huge loans leveraged
against European success they
crashed and burned when their
dreams fizzled out.
Ridsdale seems to have worked
the same magic at Cardiff, with the
club having gambled on promotion
by spending big on players and
once he has destroyed this club he
will undoubtedly move on to ruin an
other. It is the cruel truth about pro
