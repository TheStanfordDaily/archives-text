Ben Stiller's latest departure
from his usual screwball
comedies landed with a tiny
splash. But don't let its tiny indie
feel dissuade you. This movie, while
true to its independent vibe, is a lot
more accessible than the majority of
smaller-scale movies. Director Noah
Baumbach ("The Squid and the
Whale") gives a very intimate look
into the life of title character Roger
Greenberg. In an interview with
Baumbach, Stiller and the music
composer of the film, James
Murphy of LCD Soundsystem,
Baumbach said that Stiller was his
first choice because the character
needed to have humor first and
foremost. However, Stiller leaves his

slapstick and silly humor behind for
an excellently delivered wry wit.
In the film, title character
Greenberg takes on the easy chal
lenge of house sitting for his broth
er. Unfamiliar with Los Angeles and
coming off of a nervous break
down, Greenberg befriends his
brother's dog and his brother's per
sonal assistant Florence. Actress
Greta Gerwig as Florence begins to
form a relationship with Stiller.
Their relationship, based on almost
nothing, never seems to make it off
the ground. These two characters
are both searching for a purpose,
however, Stiller's character turns 41
during the course of the film, so
this is not quite a coming-of-age-

find-yourself story.
Greenberg maintains that
he just wants to be doing nothing,
and that is exactly what he does. He
spends his time writing complaint
letters to companies, building a
doghouse and meeting up with old
friends. His aimless non-quest does
get tedious, as does his relationship
with Florence. The movie never
seems to move very far forward,
although that might be the point
exactly.
Baumbach also wrote the
movie, alongside his actress wife
Jennifer Jason Leigh. The two
worked with Stiller to develop the
character and created the film they
wanted to make. While Greenberg

maintains his active non-action, he
goes through some changes as a
person. This intimate film might
not be for everyone. This comedy of
sorts goes by with not laugh-out
loud jokes, but just chuckle-to
yourself ones. The sad moments are
never tearjerkers, but ones that
make you think, "Well, that sucks".
As gentle as Greenberg himself, this
movie slowly rolls along without
ever making any real noise.
The one thing that stands
out apart from all the subtlety is the
music. For those that are familiar
with LCD Soundsystem, you will be
excited to know that their music is
featured heavily in the movie.
Songwriter Murphy wrote many of

the songs specifically for the film,
and they truly shine in the movie.
His song "All My Friends" is heavily
featured in the trailer, and Murphy
and Baumbach worked together to
create the songs. Baumbach specifi
cally selected Murphy to create the
right feel for the movie. And ulti
mately, Murphy's soundtrack suc
ceeds in being a bright spot of ener
gy in an otherwise low-key film.
Baumbach's new intimate
flick features a dramatic Stiller, an
exciting soundtrack and a quiet
script that shows an uneasy main
character looking for a purpose.
While this movie entered with a
quiet splash, if you're looking for a
gentle ride, then this movie just

could be for you.
