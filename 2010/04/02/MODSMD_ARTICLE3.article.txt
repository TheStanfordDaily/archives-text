### DAILY NEWS STAFF Varun Sivaram – Zach Zimmerman 
Varun Sivaram'll,

ford student awarded the honor this
year.
The Truman Scholarship was
awarded to 60 juniors from across the
nation. Each winner receives $30,000
to be used for up to three years of
graduate school in pursuit of a career
in public service. This year's winners
were chosen from a field of 576 candi
dates nominated by 245 colleges and
universities, according to a news re
lease.
"It feels amazing," said Sivaram,
who is from Saratoga, Calif. "It's been
something like a seven-month process
from start to finish. It was a grueling
process."
He hopes to pursue his academic
interests in energy policy and interna
tional strategic interaction at the grad
uate level.
"I'd like to apply to a dual masters
program at MIT in technology and
policy and material science," Sivaram
said. He is interested in working as an
international climate negotiator.
Sivaram plans to pursue an honors
thesis next year in the Center for In
ternational Security and Cooperation
(CISAC) program about the security
implications of renewable energy. On
campus, Sivaram models for Charity
Fashion Show, sings a cappella and
dances for Stanford Bhangra.
