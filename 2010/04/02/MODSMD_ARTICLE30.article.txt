City Island, the fishing village
that harbors the shenanigans
and laughs in director
Raymond De Felitta's film, is tech
nically part of the Bronx; it shares,
however, none of the borough's typ
ical harshness with bright sun
light and the bay perpetually in
view, we are assured that nothing
truly bad could occur here. Curious,
then, is the procession of issues that

affects Vincent Rizzo
(Andy Garcia) and his
family. Early on, we find
Vincent standing on his
roof; while reading an acting manu
al called "Brando," he sneakily
smokes a cigarette. Inside, his wife
Joyce (Julianna Margulies) is yelling
at their adolescent son Vince, Jr.
(Ezra Miller), who is, we see from a
camera angle that Joyce isn't privy

to, ogling internet pornography.
And so we see the over-arching
obsession of "City Island": secrets
between family members and the
comedy that ensues from their
clumsy handling. Indeed, later we
find Vincent on the roof again,
smoking another illicit cigarette; a
floor down, on the balcony, his wife
Joyce is furtively puffing away at
one of her own while, sure enough,
on the ground floor, their son is
doing the same.
Vincent has been lying to
Joyce, telling her he is out playing
poker while actually taking classes
to nurture his childhood dream of
being an actor a far cry from his
current job as a corrections officer.
Early on, we find him taking a quick
work break: harassed by trouble
even when outside the prison walls,
he is on the phone with his daugh
ter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-
Lorido), whose petulance is unsur
prising until we notice the locker
from which she's rooting out her
belongings isn't that of a college
where papa Vincent believes her to
be but a strip-joint. When
Vincent drives her home from the
bus station and asks about school,
his obliviousness almost evokes
pathos until we are jarred by
resounding honking as he distract
edly bumps into the car in front. De
Felitta generates comedy by playing
with the dramatic irony and the
ridiculousness of his characters'
scrapes; we would pity such terribly
afflicted people, but the sunny
score, pinball-pace and sheer vol
ume of misfortune keeps us guffaw
ing along rather than bogging us
down.
Two outsiders provide the
impetus for the plot: Tony (Steven
Strait), a new transfer to the prison

who Vincent realizes is actually his
son from a now-deceased woman
he abandoned long ago, and the
lovely but haunted Molly (Emily
Mortimer), who befriends Vincent
in acting class after an exercise
involves exchanging secrets. In one
of the better sequences, Molly urges
Vincent to attend his first-ever
audition. Initially contorting his
face and squelching out a ridiculous
Marlon Brando imitation, he is
politely rejected but just as he
walks away they call him back and
suggest he use his experience as a
prison warden, inspiring Vincent to
do a rendition, equally hilarious
and impassioned, of a psycho
tough-guy. He scores a call-back.
Celebrating later, Molly announces
the achievement to a bar full of
strangers; when they join Molly's
applause for Vincent we can't help
getting carried away with our pro
tagonist's triumph.
Yet, finally "City Island"
fails to straddle the line where we
can both laugh at and root for its
characters because the very thing
that makes them so funny a
viciousness and irreverence in por
traying their problems eventually
leaves us unmoved by suggestions
of their personal development. The
final crescendo is a confrontation
outside the house where everybody
spills their respective beans. The
tears and cries of forgiveness that
result are unconvincing to the verge
of being self-parodying and are
really quite funny. Indeed, it would
be understandable to suspect the
film of being satirical were it not for
the persistent final attempts to
move us, like with Molly leaving the
city, ostensibly inspired to confront
her own demons attempting to
echo, perhaps, a winning close like

Matt Damon's in "Good
Will Hunting." "City
Island" seems to implore
us to see that through suf

fering comes self-knowledge and
growth, but the underlying brutality
with which the film hacks away at
the characters for comedic effect
means that by the end, there isn't a
scrap of them left for us to believe
in or care about. We just don't
know what to make of these apples.
