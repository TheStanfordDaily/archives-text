For any actor or actress, win-
ning an Oscar is undeniably
an ideal accomplishment and
desired career booster. Although
placing an Academy Award on your
mantel may induce more jobs, high-
er pay and an increase in notoriety,
people have recently begun to spec-
ulate that it also unfortunately dis-

turbs the relationships and mar
riages of the Hollywood couples to
which it is awarded. News of this
so-called "Oscar Curse" has been
circulating the media following the
emergence of rumors regarding this
year's Best Actress Winner, Sandra
Bullock, and her husband, Jesse
James (former host of Discovery
Channel's "Monster Garage").
According to reports, Bullock is
leaving James because he main
tained an 11-month affair with a

tattoo model and stripper while
Bullock was busy working on "The
Blind Side," the film for which she
won an Oscar,
Bullock is not the only
actor to see the end of a relation
ship following an Oscar win; in fact,
the list is quite long,
In 1997, Kim Basinger won

for her part in "L.A. Confidential"
and a year later divorced her hus
band, Alec Baldwin. In 1999,
Angelina Jolie won for her role in
"Girl, Interrupted" and divorced
Johnny Lee Miller. Julia Roberts
won in 2000 for "Erin Brockovich"
and split with then-boyfriend of
four years, Benjaminn Bratt, shortly
afterward. Similarly, Halle Berry
won in 2001 for "Monsters Ball"
and divorced her husband, Eric
Benet, within the same year. After

winning her second Oscar in 2004
for "Million Dollar Baby," Hillary
Swank and Chad Lowe divorced.
Reese Witherspoon won in 2005 for

"Walk the Line" and then divorced
Ryan Phillippe. Sean Penn recently
divorced his wife, Robin Wright
Penn, after winning Best Actor in
2009. And, also in 2009, Kate

Winslet won for "The Reader" and
separated this year from director
Sam Mendes.
Because of this extensive

record, the media has made failed
Hollywood relationships the result
of a glorious Oscar win. It kind of
makes sense. By winning an Oscar,
these lucky actors and actresses

place themselves in the spotlight
and increase their rank in the
extremely critical and competitive
piranha tank that is Hollywood.
This attention has to put some
strain on any relationship, which
explains why the numerous rela-
tionships listed above floundered
shortly after one partner won the

award.
However, this theory is by
no means foolproof. It does not
account for the significant amount
of Hollywood marriages that do last
and the higher number of
Hollywood marriages that don't last
even without an Oscar. Elizabeth
Taylor's two Oscars could not have
produced all seven of her divorces.
While an Oscar may expedite the
eventual dissolution of actor rela-

tionships, it does not directly cause
them. Hollywood relationships
rarely work because both parties are
often in the spotlight and separated
for long periods of time. Also, the
lifestyle that these individuals are a
part of does not particularly accom
modate stable, faithful romance. In
all likelihood, Sandra Bullock and

Jesse James would not have stood
the test of time, Oscar or not. Does
winning an Academy Award mean
that a marriage is doomed?
Probably not; it just means people
care enough to want to read all
about the scandal when it breaks.
