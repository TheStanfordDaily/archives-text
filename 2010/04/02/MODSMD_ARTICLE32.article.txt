When Ronnie Miller (Miley
Cyrus) and her brother
leave their home in New
York to spend the summer with
their father in a Southern beach
town, angry teenage drama lurks in
midair. Still furious three years after
her father (Greg Kinnear) left them,
Ronnie plays the quintessential
rebellious teenager who just about
adequately graduates high school
and has no plans of going to col-
lege. Despite her father's attempts to
reconnect with Ronnie, she insis-

tently pushes him away. But when
beach volleyball hunk Will Blakelee
(Liam Hemsworth) comes along,
they instantly fall in love and
Ronnie also starts to open up to her
father.
Granted, there are no air
port chase scenes or the usual
romantic dinners, but "The Last
Song" still plays on a cliched story
line of boy meets girl and falls in
love with her, causing transforma
tive character changes. Nevertheless,
the love between Ronnie and Will

floats either on a calm body of
water or during a stormy night in
the sea, based on Ronnie's mood. In
one scene, she has a fit over how
many girls Will had been with
before her. In another, Ronnie is
upset over not being invited to
Will's sister's wedding. Absurdly
romantic and melodramatic, the
movie may win the hearts of many
young teenage girls (and boys), but
Ronnie's overly excessive fury ren
ders the first half of the movie a
displeasurable viewer experience.
Rest assured, though, that
Ronnie's character undergoes a
noticeable change in the second half
of the movie. When she discovers
her father's sickness, the three years
of anger since her parents' divorce
dissolve like the ocean water wash
ing over the sand. While the father
daughter relationship dynamic is
noteworthy and sentimental, the
rest of the story is dreamy yet infu
riating. The simple coming-of-age
movie plot may leave you disap
pointed. However, if your insistent
younger sibling or cousin wants to
see the "Party in the USA"
singer/star Cyrus in her first lead
role, you might as well go for
amusement. But if you are like
many of my friends who, with no
hesitation, turned down my offer to
see Miley Cyrus' feature film, then
the movie was not made for you.
One critic sitting nearby made a
brief comment, "This is supposed to
be Oscar-worthy?" followed by
laughter from some sitting in the
back row.
Finally, I conclude by rec
ommending the movie only if you
can endure nearly one hour of the
1:47 running time watching teenage
drama infused with rage, but, in a
theater filled primarily with young
teens and some parents, great satis
faction may surface. "The Last
Song" is an average teen movie that
will end up disappointing those
who seek laughter, fun and playful

twists in the plot.
