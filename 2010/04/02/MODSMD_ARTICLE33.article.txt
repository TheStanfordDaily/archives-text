# Remote Nomad: In Tina We Trust?
## 
### – liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
Spring is synonymous with
growth: a startling number
of my friends were born in
April; the seed of skin cancer is
planted on the skin of innumer
able college students; and, of

course, the emergence of your
local flora and fauna spawns lots
of bad nature poetry. What hap-
pens, then, when your television
screen casts a dark shadow of
decay over your spring quarter?
An awkward, unimaginative,
uncomfortable decay? How will
the planet and my social life sur-
v j ve ?

I refer, of course, to my
life coach and the pinnacle of
American comedy, Tina Fey's "30
Rock." While excessive celebrity
appearances admittedly derailed

the arc of last year's third season
(Alan Alda kidney plotline any
one?), Julianne Moore is hardly
an excuse for this year's failed
ventures in narrative develop
ment. Simply put, no character in

t^le curren t season has a consis
tent' compelling story. Will view
ers ' Emmy voters, put up
with this or move on? !t is a truth
universally acknowledged that
Community and Parks and
Recreation" best the second hour
Thursday comedy, The Office
and "30 Rock."

The inimitable Liz
Lemon hit rock bottom last week
with the return of Jason Sudeikis's
Floyd, her Cleveland flame from
season one. I didn't like Floyd

then, and I certainly wasn't excit
ed for his return (I couldn't even
get psyched up for the Dennis
Duffy strikes back episodes). Her
baby mania having been aban
doned (for now), Liz unjustly
broke things off with the
"Dealbreakers" franchise and just
escaped the throes of the atro
cious "future husband" plot line.
The former produced the best
episode of the season by a mile,
"Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001,"
as the other fifteen episodes this
year have held Liz hostage to mul
ligans such as Jack's romance with
Julianne Moore or a transient
Jenna-Tracy plot.
Robert Carlock, the sec
ond most important person to the
show after Fey herself, reports
that the intention is for the show
to end with satisfactory, separate
romantic pairings for both Jack
Donaghy and Liz Lemon. The
show does have to avoid looking
like a parody of "Sex and the
City" or any of the "Material
Possession Menacing Context"
shows like "Lipstick Jungle" or
"Cashmere Mafia," but, in its
recent aversion to any displays of
Liz Lemon's humanity, the show
has wasted its heroine and best
asset, Fey herself. Notably, Fey has
written only two episodes this
season the opener and the sac
charine "Secret Santa" that intro
duced Julianne Moore and her
botched Boston accent.
It seems that, when Liz
Lemon gets the shaft, so do her
wards Tracy and Jenna. Jenna has
had her worst season yet, and the
charm of Tracy's quest to EGOT
(Emmy Grammy Oscar Tony) has
worn off from underutilization.
Also, since when is it a good idea
to pair the two? The fall of Jenna
and Tracy as simultaneous yet dis
tinct headaches for Liz may have
something to do with the
increased popularity of Jack
Mcßrayer as Kenneth the Page.
His character, however, similarly
relies on frustrated Lemon-isms
to heighten his oblivious nature.
The number of overlapping plot
lines is causing chaos, even as it
facilitates the quotable one liners
"30 Rock" pays the rent with. The
show seems to be suffering from
the same issues as HBO's "Big
Love: too much in too few
episodes.
The one character you

think could transcend this break
down would be Alec Baldwin's
Jack Donaghy. Rather, his narra
tives have been more prominent
than usual to compensate for
weak stories about TGS itself,
making their flaws all the more
apparent. First off, the preoccupa
tion with Boston is wholly unfun
ny. I'm from Boston, and even I
don't chortle at episodes like the
Boston field trip. Local New York
humor doesn't resonate with any
one beyond the island, and cer
tainly not LA industry voters. The
simultaneity of Julianne Moore
and Elizabeth Banks as romantic
guest spots makes me ask: why,
Elizabeth Banks, are you famous?
And why should I care? Jack the
philanderer is never as interesting
as Jack the devoted crazy man
Phoebe with avian bone syn
drome, Elisa, our very own
Condi, and the flawless Vermont
Congresswoman CC parry with
Baldwin's staunch Jack and win.
These female roles, poorly script
ed and unevenly depicted, make

Jack look fool
ish. Further, A
stripping fl
him of

Don Geiss as mentor and GE as
owner has left a void in his all
important career. Who is Jack
Donaghy if not corporate
America? Jack Donaghy is the
straight, white version of Paul in
"A Chorus Line:" he needs this
job.
Perhaps "30 Rock" is
going through a purge (it is bikini
season after all). My biggest ques
tion is, where does this season
end, given what we have wit
nessed so far? Matt Damon is
signed on for the final episodes,
but again it's unclear to me what
the Boston boy can do for the
show besides entrench us further
in a culture of gratuitous cameos
and incoherent narrative. All I
want are Jenna's musical num
bers, Tracy's film career, Jack's
insensitivity, and Liz's eating.

weak stories about TGS itself,
making their flaws all the more
apparent. First off, the preoccupa
tion with Boston is wholly unfun
ny. I'm from Boston, and even I
don't chortle at episodes like the
Boston field trip. Local New York
humor doesn't resonate with any
one beyond the island, and cer
tainly not LA industry voters. The
simultaneity of Julianne Moore
and Elizabeth Banks as romantic
guest spots makes me ask: why,
Elizabeth Banks, are you famous?
And why should I care? Jack the
philanderer is never as interesting
as Jack the devoted crazy man
Phoebe with avian bone syn
drome, Elisa, our very own
Condi, and the flawless Vermont
Congresswoman CC parry with
Baldwin's staunch Jack and win.
These female roles, poorly script
ed and unevenly depicted, make

Jack look fool
ish. Further, A
stripping fl
him of

Don Geiss as mentor and GE as
owner has left a void in his all
important career. Who is Jack
Donaghy if not corporate
America? Jack Donaghy is the
straight, white version of Paul in
"A Chorus Line:" he needs this
job.
Perhaps "30 Rock" is
going through a purge (it is bikini
season after all). My biggest ques
tion is, where does this season
end, given what we have wit
nessed so far? Matt Damon is
signed on for the final episodes,
but again it's unclear to me what
the Boston boy can do for the
show besides entrench us further
in a culture of gratuitous cameos
and incoherent narrative. All I
want are Jenna's musical num
bers, Tracy's film career, Jack's
insensitivity, and Liz's eating.
