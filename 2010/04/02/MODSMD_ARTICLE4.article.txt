### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Elizabeth Titus 
Caltrain may cut

weekend, midday or

midnight service to re-

solve its financial woes,
officials said Thursday.
The commuter rail's
CEO, Mike Scanlon, told

the Caltrain board of directors Thurs
day that declining revenues could
mean slashed services in the next year
and beyond.
"Nothing is for certain yet," said

spokesperson. "A lot of discussion
needs to happen with the board."
But cuts "would need to be done in
the next 15 months," Bartholomew
said. "We're running out of money. It's
bad."
The number of midday trains al
ready dropped to 90 from 98 earlier
this year.
"Could that be the next to go?"
Bartholomew asked. "Maybe,"
She added that Caltrain's lack of a
dedicated funding source has always
strained the $97 million service, but the
halt of state funding and decline in rid
ership this year have deepened the
deficit.
The board did not discuss fare in
creases on Thursday, but could consider
it. Fares were last hiked in January 2009.

The Caltrain served an average of
18,211 passengers on weekends in
2008-09, as well as 5,718 midday riders
and 2,082 night passengers. The service
stops in Palo Alto north of University
Avenue.
