# FINAL PHASE
## Cardinal is two wins away from national title 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 Cardinal women will
face No. 3 Oklahoma in the Final
Four of the NCAA Women's Divi
sion I Basketball Championship at
the Alamodome in San Antonio on
Sunday, after sneaking past Xavier
with a dramatic buzzer beater four
days ago.
"I just feel like we've been given
a second basketball life," said Stan
ford head coachTaraVanDerveer of
the victory over the Musketeers.
"And I know our team wall make the
most of it. We saw our season pass
before our eyes. It was over. We just
are so thankful to be playing, so ap
preciative of the opportunity to go to
San Antonio, that I know our team
will make the absolute most of it."
The Xavier game was the first in
this year's tournament where the

NOTES ! Stanford will play in its third consecu
tive Final Four this weekend and its ninth
overall. Ranked No. 2 in the nation, as it has
been for most of the year, the Cardinal are
significant favorites to advance to the final,
where it will play either Baylor or UConn.
The Huskies dealt Stanford its only loss of the
season in December. Stanford will look to
Ail-American senior Jayne Appel to lead the
offense against the Sooners.


Cardinal was pushed by its opposition,
and the first contest since U CLA in Jan
uary where the winning margin for
Stanford had been less than 15 points.
"We don't want close games," said
junior forward Kayla Pedersen. "But it
happened, and you can only learn from
that. We know that we can be tested
now. We will persevere in tough situa
tions. We all have a little bit of a new
found trust for each other. We can al
ways count on each other. That will only
make us better."
For two players, senior center Jayne
Appel and redshirt senior guard Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude, each game has par
ticular importance because a loss would
end their collegiate careers.
At every stage throughout this sea
son, Appel has had only one thing on

her mind the national championship
and the experience of sitting on the
sidelines after fouling out in a below
par performance against Xavier should
be all the motivation she needs.
"I think Jayne will come out and
play her very best," VanDerveer said. "I
think she's been given a second time
around. And how often do you get a
second chance?"
The last time the Cardinal (35-1,18-
0 Pac-10) played the Sooners (27-10,11-
5 Big-12) was also in San Antonio, in a
88-74 victory in a regional semifinal at
the AT&T Center in 2006. A young
Gold-Onwude opened the scoring with
a three-pointer. Now, as the longest
serving member of the team, she has
grown up to become a rock at the back
for the Card.
"She's a huge part of our team's suc
cess," VanDerveer said. "Her defense is
something that really puts her up on a
little bit of a pedestal for me. We start
with who's she going to guard and do
our game plan from there."

Oklahoma will not present the same
size challenge as Xavier, but the speed
of junior guard Danielle Robinson will
need to be contained; and she may well
be a target for Gold-Onwude's atten
tion. Robinson is the Sooners' top scor
er this year, with an average of 16.6
points per game, but is not the only of
fensive threat in her team. Senior for
ward Nyeshia Stevenson, after scoring
14.5 points per game in the regular sea
son, shot 12-of-17 from the field and
scored 31 points to lead her team to win
the Kansas City Regional Final over
No. 4 Kentucky.
"It's a great matchup for our team,"
VanDerveer said. "With some teams
they are extreme, and we are not an ex
treme team. And Oklahoma's not an
extreme team.
"We're very similar," she continued.
"They play about seven people, we play
seven or eight people. They have an in
side post presence with [senior center
Abi] Olajuwon, we have Jayne and
[sophomore forward] Nneka [Ogwu
mike]. We both like to run; we both run
the triangle offense. So there's probably
more similarities than differences, but
we might be a little bigger overall in
side."
In the second semi-final No. 1 Con
necticut will square up with freshman
sensation Brittney Griner and her No. 4
Baylor team.
It will be the Lady Bears' second trip
to the Final Four and the first for the
current incarnation of its team. All of
the other three teams were in last year's
contest, where they were joined by
Louisville, which did not even make it
into the NCAA Tournament this sea
son.
Stanford may be hoping for a
chance to get some revenge over
UConn for knocking it out of the tour
nament at this stage last year, and for
dishing out its only defeat in the current
season, but for that to happen both still
need to win on Sunday. Baylor and Ok
lahoma might be slight underdogs, but
have nothing to lose and everything to
gain.
"It's like now you're in a new tour
nament in itself, the Final Four," Gold-
Onwude said. "Its a completely differ
ent experience than any part of our sea
son on the level of media exposure,
the level of events, the level of pressure,
what's at stake. It's completely differ
ent."
Both games will air live on ESPN on
Sunday. The first game, between the
Cardinal and the Sooners, is at 4 p.m.
PST and the second, the Huskies
against the Lady Bears, will tipoffat6pm
PST.

Though the Cardinal barely escaped Xavier in the Sacramento Regional final, it still comes into the Final Four favored
to beat Oklahoma and advance. Junior toward Kayla Pedersen (14) will be instrumental to the Stanford offense.
