# STAYING ON TOP
## 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
Looking to continue its recent
success and avenge some past
losses, the Stanford men's volley
ball team will hit the road this
weekend to face two ranked con
ference opponents. Following two
convincing sweeps in its first ac
tion after a break for finals, the
Cardinal (15-4,12-4 MPSF) sits in
first atop both the national rank
ings and the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) and
will try to extend its eight-game
winning streak this weekend.
However, this won't be an easy
task, as the Cardinal will face two
opponents that each handed it
losses earlier in the season No.
5 Cal State Northridge (16-7,11-6
MPSF) and No. 10 UC Santa Bar
bara (10-13,7-10 MPSF). With the
chance to clinch an MPSF tourna
ment berth before the last few
weeks, it is certain the Card will
strive for a different result this

time around.
"We have grown both mental
ly and physically since then [the
earlier losses], and have learned
from the mistakes we made in
both those matches," said senior
opposite Evan Romero. "Both
Northridge and Santa Barbara
are very talented teams that we
look forward to playing, aiming to
display that the lessons we have
learned since have made us a bet
ter team."
Junior libero Jordan Inafuku
also agreed that things had
changed since the last time Stan
ford played these two teams.
"When we played in January
we didn't win close sets, and we
didn't respond well to what we
perceived to be some poor offici
ating," Inafuku said. "The thing
that's most different about us now
is the way we respond in those sit
uations. You'll see a very different
Stanford team if we find ourselves
in a similar position."
While this is certainly true, the

Cardinal also will be facing talent
ed opponents who boast some ex
ceptional players. Cal State
Northridge senior middle block
er, Jacek Ratajczak, listed at seven
feet and two inches tall, is hard to
miss. Ratajczak is currently sec
ond on the team with three kills
per set and first in blocks with just
over one per set. However, he is
not Northridge's main offensive
weapon and is complemented by
senior opposite Theo Edwards
and senior middle blocker Kevin
McKniff.
"Jacek Ratajczak is a difficult
player to defend just because he's
a seven-footer and we just don't
match up with that kind of
height," Inafuku said. "We are
definitely going to try to serve
tough so that [Northridge] has a
difficult time getting him the
ball."
Santa Barbara has its share of
talent too, including junior out
side hitter Jeff Menzel, who leads
the nation in kills per set with

5.33.
"Menzel is definitely the big
stick for the Gauchos," Inafuku
said. "He's taken over a thousand
swings and deservedly so he's
a very dynamic player. We're
going to make sure we devote a
good deal of attention to him and
try to make things a little more
difficult for him."
In addition to avenging past
losses, the Card also hopes to re
tain its No. 1 ranking this week
end. Last week marked the first
time this season that Stanford was
the unanimous choice for the No.
1 spot, beating out second-ranked
Pepperdine for all 16 first-place
votes. This adds a new dimension
to the matches the Cardinal will
play for the rest of the season, a
grueling schedule that has them
battling some of the top teams in
the country, including No. 2 Pep
perdine.

said of the Cardinal's possession of
the No. 1 spot.

recent matches, the Card is in the

Stanford team if we find ourselves
in a similar position."
While this is certainly true, the

Cardinal also will be facing talent
ed opponents who boast some ex
ceptional players. Cal State
Northridge senior middle block
er, Jacek Ratajczak, listed at seven
feet and two inches tall, is hard to
miss. Ratajczak is currently sec
ond on the team with three kills
per set and first in blocks with just
over one per set. However, he is
not Northridge's main offensive
weapon and is complemented by
senior opposite Theo Edwards
and senior middle blocker Kevin
McKniff.
"Jacek Ratajczak is a difficult
player to defend just because he's
a seven-footer and we just don't
match up with that kind of
height," Inafuku said. "We are
definitely going to try to serve
tough so that [Northridge] has a
difficult time getting him the
ball."
Santa Barbara has its share of
talent too, including junior out
side hitter Jeff Menzel, who leads
the nation in kills per set with

5.33.
"Menzel is definitely the big
stick for the Gauchos," Inafuku
said. "He's taken over a thousand
swings and deservedly so he's
a very dynamic player. We're
going to make sure we devote a
good deal of attention to him and
try to make things a little more
difficult for him."
In addition to avenging past
losses, the Card also hopes to re
tain its No. 1 ranking this week
end. Last week marked the first
time this season that Stanford was
the unanimous choice for the No.
1 spot, beating out second-ranked
Pepperdine for all 16 first-place
votes. This adds a new dimension
to the matches the Cardinal will
play for the rest of the season, a
grueling schedule that has them
battling some of the top teams in
the country, including No. 2 Pep
perdine.
"First, [the ranking] is a re-

NOTES: The Cardinal will look to cement its hold on
the No. 1 national ranking with wins over two MPSF
foes this weekend. It will look to avenge home losses
to both Cal State Northridge and UC-Santa Bar
bara. Stanford currently sits atop the MPSF standings
and will clinch a berth in the MPSF postseason tour
nament with a victory this weekend.


minder that we indeed have the tal
ent to be labeled as one of the top
programs in the nation, but yet it is
also a tool that other teams we know
will use to target us and bring the
best they have to play us," Romero
said of the Cardinal's possession of
the No. 1 spot.
In the coming weeks, the Cardinal
will look to defend its position atop
the national rankings. Led by a dom
inating offense that leads the nation

in hitting percentage at .365 and is
second in kills per game (16.36) and
a defense that has stepped up big in
recent matches, the Card is in the
thick of the hunt for its second na
tional title. While it faces several top
teams in the remainder of its sched
ule, the team is embracing the diffi
culty this may present.
"The remaining six matches are
all against top teams in the country,
yet we look forward to the challenges

and aim to continue improving so
that we are fully prepare for the post
season," Romero said.
The match against Cal State
Northridge takes place on Friday at 7
p.m. in Northridge, Calif., with the
UCSB match at the same time on
Saturday night in Santa Barbara,
Calif.
