## STUDENT LIFE University clarifies DUI policy New wording implemented to assist Board of Judicial Affairs in drunk driving cases 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
The Board of Judicial Affairs re
cently "clarified" the language of its
drunk driving policy to help guide
panels in deciding accused students'
responsibility for driving under the
influence.
The new policy, which was adopt
ed winter quarter, does not change
the penalties for students found re
sponsible for DUIs. It does, however,
allow students accused of driving
under the influence to be found re
sponsible for Fundamental Standard
violations even if they are not found
guilty in court.
"One confusion that has come up
in the past is how a particular DUI
case relates to current law or court
proceedings outside of Stanford,"
wrote board co-chair Nate Cham
bers, a doctoral student in computer

science, in an e-mail to The Daily. "As
an example, if a student's case is
dropped by an external court, or if a
student is able to plea-bargain out of
a criminal charge, should this affect a
panel's decision? The old DUI guid
ance did not address this issue."
According to Lynn Hildemann,
the board's co-chair and a professor
in civil and environmental engineer
ing, the change is intended to clarify
the DUI policy, "not dramatically
change it."
The change comes in response to
several DUI-related cases brought
to the Office of Judicial Affairs. Ac
cording to Chambers, who became
co-chair this quarter, the clarification
should also help students understand
the University's position on the mat
ter.
Before addressing the change last
quarter, the assumption among those
involved in Judicial Affairs was that,

because incurring a DUI on campus
is considered a violation of the Fun
damental Standard, if a student was
not found legally guilty, a Judicial Af
fairs panel might not find the student
responsible either.
The Fundamental Standard calls
for "respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of others
as is demanded of good citizens." The
new policy now responds: "Conduct
that poses a risk of significant harm
to people or property will generally
violate this standard. Driving while
under the influence of alcohol or
drugs is an example of such con
duct."
It goes on to say that "meeting a
legal standard is not necessary for
finding a violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard," according to Cham
bers.
"It thus allows for panels to con
sider the intricacies of individual

cases when they determine re
sponsibility, rather than out
side court proceedings,"
Chambers said.
During the 2008-09 school
year, Judicial Affairs panelists
heard 12 Fundamental Standard
cases, "most" involving DUIs, ac
cording to Office of Judicial Af
fairs statistics. Nine students were
found responsible for Fundamen
tal Standard violations.
Most students found responsible
for DUI-related violations face a
one-quarter suspension, 20 to 50
hours of community service, the loss
of driving or parking privileges on
campus for some time and possible
restitution.
"I personally believe the new
wording is a positive step," Cham
bers said. "Rather than put the spot
light on the nitty-gritty details of
DUI case law, it instead focuses on

the
responding
student's actual be
havior."
"We do not ask, 'was 0.08
reached?"' Chambers said, refer
ring to the legal blood alcohol
limit for drivers at least 21 years
old. "But instead, 'Did the behavior
cause a risk of significant harm?' This
goes to the heart of the Fundamental
Standard by putting the emphasis on
the action itself, and encouraging stu

dents to respect the order, morality
and rights of others."
