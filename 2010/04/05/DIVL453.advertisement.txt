Performance bv Mohsen Namjoo
SATURDAY, APRIL 10

Cubberley Auditorium,
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
VENING WITH
MOHSEN
NAMJOO
Visiting Fellow with the Hamid & Christina Moghadam Program in Iranian Studies
Mohsen Namjoo, an Iranian artist, songwriter, singer, music scholar and setar
(traditional Persian lute) player is one of the most groundbreaking artists in Persian
music todayoften called "the Bob Dylan of Iran."
Born in 1976 in Torbat-e Jam, Iran, Namjoo began his musical training at the age
of twelve, studying under Nasrollah Nasehpoor until the age of eighteen. In 1994
Namjoo was offered admission to study Theater and Music at University of Tehran.
Since the music program there would not start for another year, he first joined the
theater course, where he learned how to connect with an audience. At Tehran
University he was trained under Alireza Mashayekhi, Azin Movahed and other
masters. Namjoo also studied Iranian folk music under Haj Ghorbane Soleimani.
His unique music style resembles a patchwork of Persian classical poetry of Hafez,
Rumi or Saadi with western music, namely rock, blues, and jazz.
Since 2003, Namjoo has recorded parts of his works in Tehran. His debut album
titled Toranj was officially released in Iran in September 2007 with his own voice
featured in most of his creations. He has also composed soundtracks for movies
and plays, and was featured in the documentary Sounds of Silence (directed
by Amir Hamz and Mark Lazarz) which has been screened at international film
festivals. He also appeared in a feature narrative film called Few Kilograms of
Dates for the Funeral (Director Saman Salur). Namjoo's first performance outside
Iran was in January 2006 at the Tehran Hotspot of the International Rotterdam
Film Festival where he played solo.
Namjoo's visit to Stanford University is sponsored by the Hamid & Christina
Moghadam Program in Iranian Studies. His residency at Stanford is made possible
through the generous support of the Flora Family Foundation and the Hariri Family.
