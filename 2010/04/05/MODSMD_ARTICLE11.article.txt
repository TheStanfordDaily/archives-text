# Campaign Week underway: profiling the six ASSU executive slates
## Angelina Cardona and Kelsei Wharton CARDONA-WHARTON EXECUTIVE SLATE 
### PHILLIP KLIMKE ZOE RICHARDS 
With their "One Stanford" campaign underway, Angeli
na Cardona 'll and Kelsei Wharton 'l2 are hoping to clinch
the ASSU executive seats on a promise of unifying students
and stakeholders balancing vast goals with specific stu
dent life issues.

Both international relations majors, the pair became
friends while they were team leaders for the Foundations
for Education (F4Ed) math tutoring program.
Though they joined the race at the tail end of the peti
tioning period, the two have gained significant traction with
the student body, bagging endorsements from seven major
student groups: the Student of Color Coalition (SOCC), the
Queer Coalition, California College Democrats, the
Women's Coalition, the Green Alliance for Innovative Ac
tion (GAIA), The Stanford Progressive and the Stanford
Daily Editorial Board.
Cardona and Wharton are no strangers to campus poli

tics, and are the only undergraduate slate with major ASSU
experience.
Cardona, currently a freshman resident assistant in fran
cos, served as dorm president in Branner her freshman year
and was selected as chair of mental health and later as co
chief of staff under former executives Jonny Dorsey 'O9 and
Fagan Harris 'O9.
Wharton, who is currently the deputy chair of the Under
graduate Senate, was previously a Frosh Council represen
tative and served as Ujamaa dorm president. Outside the
political realm, Wharton is involved in Volunteers of Latin
America (VILA) and the Haas Center's Public Service
Leadership Program.
The slate is the only one eligible to receive $750 in public
financing, for which it qualified after gathering valid signa
tures from more than 50 graduate students and 50 under
grads during the petition process.
Their motivations to run are diverse, but both candidates
struck personal chords when explaining their decisions.
Cardona said that, her freshman year, she was ap
proached by a friend who contemplated suicide, an incident
that opened her eyes to the importance of mental health is
sues on campus. She described the experience as the
"biggest motivating factor" behind her involvement in cam
pus politics.
Wharton, on the other hand, envisions campus politics as
an opportunity to mentor younger students. He credited his
parents, who he said kept investing in him even as they went
through the difficulties of a divorce.
Reflecting on previous administrations, Cardona and
Wharton both agreed that current president David Gob
aud, a coterminal student in computer science, has im
proved the student experience.
Still, Wharton believes that the direction of the ASSU
can be better targeted at wider-scale change, and the pair
agreed that relations with the Graduate Student Council
and Senate in particular can be more effective.
"The ASSU right now is not about leadership develop
ment," Wharton said. "I really want to invest in people the
way that I've been invested in."
Wharton believes challenges this year with the Senate
Appropriations Committee, in particular, can be worked on
in a manner more amenable to students.

As a member of the Appropria
tions Committee and staff member
for VILA, Wharton said he has sat
on both sides of budget book and
sympathizes with frustrated VSOs.
"I don't fault them. I fault us,"
Wharton said.
Among a number of platform

points aimed at public service and
diversity, sustainability and well
being, Cardona and Wharton also
hope to increase dining options for
students by launching a dining hall
program that exclusively serves ha
laal, kosher and vegan meals.
According to Cardona, who met
with Eric Montell, the executive di
rector of Stanford Dining, Murray
would be a likely possibility for the
site of a pilot program.
The two are also interested in
the green dorm project and expan

sion of the pilot trayless dining pro
gram.
They also want to re-frame men
tal health issues in a more "positive
light," Cardona said, citing priori
ties such as breaking down stigma
surrounding counseling and stress
and leveraging programs that make
response mechanisms to sexual as
sault more accessible to students.
