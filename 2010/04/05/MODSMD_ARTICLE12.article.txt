# Austin Guzman and Patrick Mahoney
## GUZMAN-MAHONEY REFERENDUM DEMANDING ACTION (G-MRDA) EXECUTIVE SLATE 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
Juniors Austin Guzman and Patrick Mahoney are per
haps the least-familiar names in this year's executive race
even the satirical Stanford Chaparral slate appeared in
White Plaza on Friday for the campaign kick-off, while
Guzman and Mahoney did not.
But don't count them out yet, they said Sunday.
"Our strength is that we're not like the ASSU," Ma
honey said. "Most of our experience in this campaign is
through the VSO problem ... we think we're probably
ahead of that debate."
He was referring to the struggle, he said, of friends in
student groups in the sustainability community seeking
funding this year. That personal experience, Mahoney

said, is part of what makes him and Guzman well suited
for the ASSU's top two jobs.
Guzman, 21, is an economics major and president of
the Theta Delta Chi fraternity. A former rower and a
member of the women's basketball practice team, he
spent fall quarter in Santiago and now lives in Enchanted
Broccoli Forest.
Mahoney, 21, is a political science major and, like his
running mate, is a Theta Delt member living in EBF. He
was also involved in last year's sustainable fashion show.
They said the ASSU's perceived ineffectiveness
spurred them to run.
"Everything I could read about ASSU, the problem
was, people were more interested in discussing things than
in fixing what we saw as collective action problems," Ma
honey said. "Our plan is that the ASSU should be more
like a union to solve problems that no one individual can
solve on their own."
Guzman said he saw too many similarities in the plat
forms of past executive slates. If elected, the two would
post short weekly You Tube videos about their work that
would be more engaging than the videos executives and
senators have posted this year, Guzman said.
"You've seen the videos on the Web site, right?" Ma
honey asked rhetorically.
"You shouldn't have to be in the ASSU to be able to ac
cess [the ASSU]," he added.
About interacting with the ASSU legislative bodies,
Guzman and Mahoney focused on the Undergraduate
Senate.
"The Senate diffuses power," Mahoney said. "There
are a handful of senators, and each one has their own in
terests, endorsements, sponsorships and kind of electoral
kind of faction they represent. Let's be honest."
"The executive, as we envision it, should be kind of a
funnel for the entire student body," he added.
The cabinet should be focused on coordinating be
tween VSOs, they continued. Their sustainability coordi
nator, for example, would seek to consolidate efforts
among sustainability-related groups and advocate for
funding for those groups before the Senate Appropria
tions Committee and other funding sources.
If elected, the two would also create a shared contact

list among similar student groups and
start funding workshops organized
by VSO topic.
All their suggestions were in the
spirit of a more rational approach to
student groups, they said.
"Some student groups deserve
more than other student groups,"
Mahoney said. "To pass a 10 percent
rule under the rubric of fiscal conser
vatism is I mean, I guess the
heart's in the right place, but it's bass
ackwards."
By "10 percent rule," the two
meant the policy made by the Appro
priations Committee this year re
quiring that special fees groups seek
ing a budget increase beyond infla

tion gather petition signatures to get
on the ballot.
Guzman said that addressing
theft would also be on his agenda if
elected.
He said his computer was stolen
last year from his dorm room and he
expressed frustration with the inci
dent. The two suggested that the
Stanford Department of Public Safe
ty is too focused on enforcing under
age drinking laws and not on recov
ering stolen laptops, an issue they
said "no one is doing anything
about."
"I'm not in a position where if my
laptop gets stolen I say, 'Oh, you
know, I'll just buy another one,"' Ma
honey said. "It's hurtful, in away, that
the best the ASSU can think of as far
as collective action problems is plas
tic bubbles in the Wellness Room. I
can't stop a robber on my own."
They went further, saying they

would lead a "bidding war" for lap
top-tracking technology to distribute
to Stanford's 14,000 students.
Posters will go up early this week,
Guzman and Mahoney said. They
have set up a blog, which was empty
as of Sunday evening.
"Our idea is to have posters,
which are kind of like the hook. The
posters are gonna draw people in to
look at the blog and then the blog
has very specific detailed recom
mendations, almost to the point you
could take those recommendations
and turn them into legislation with
out anything else," Mahoney said.
"In a campaign dominated by va
garies and talking points, we're try
ing to be as specific as possible as far
as policy [and] action-oriented legis
lation."
