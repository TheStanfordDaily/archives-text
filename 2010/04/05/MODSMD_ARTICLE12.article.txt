# Austin Guzman and Patrick Mahoney
## GUZMAN-MAHONEY REFERENDUM DEMANDING ACTION (G-MRDA) EXECUTIVE SLATE 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
Juniors Austin Guzman and Patrick Mahoney are per
haps the least-familiar names in this year's executive race
even the satirical Stanford Chaparral slate appeared in
White Plaza on Friday for the campaign kick-off, while
Guzman and Mahoney did not.
But don't count them out yet, they said Sunday.
"Our strength is that we're not like the ASSU," Ma
honey said. "Most of our experience in this campaign is
through the VSO problem ... we think we're probably
ahead of that debate."
He was referring to the struggle, he said, of friends in
student groups in the sustainability community seeking
funding this year. That personal experience, Mahoney

said, is part of what makes him and Guzman well suited
for the ASSU's top two jobs.
Guzman, 21, is an economics major and president of
the Theta Delta Chi fraternity. A former rower and a
member of the women's basketball practice team, he
spent fall quarter in Santiago and now lives in Enchanted
Broccoli Forest.
Mahoney, 21, is a political science major and, like his
running mate, is a Theta Delt member living in EBF. He
was also involved in last year's sustainable fashion show.
They said the ASSU's perceived ineffectiveness
spurred them to run.
"Everything I could read about ASSU, the problem
was, people were more interested in discussing things than
in fixing what we saw as collective action problems," Ma
honey said. "Our plan is that the ASSU should be more
like a union to solve problems that no one individual can
solve on their own."
Guzman said he saw too many similarities in the plat
forms of past executive slates. If elected, the two would
post short weekly You Tube videos about their work that
would be more engaging than the videos executives and
senators have posted this year, Guzman said.
"You've seen the videos on the Web site, right?" Ma
honey asked rhetorically.
"You shouldn't have to be in the ASSU to be able to ac
cess [the ASSU]," he added.
About interacting with the ASSU legislative bodies,
Guzman and Mahoney focused on the Undergraduate
Senate.
"The Senate diffuses power," Mahoney said. "There
are a handful of senators, and each one has their own in
terests, endorsements, sponsorships and kind of electoral
kind of faction they represent. Let's be honest."
"The executive, as we envision it, should be kind of a
funnel for the entire student body," he added.
The cabinet should be focused on coordinating be
tween VSOs, they continued. Their sustainability coordi
nator, for example, would seek to consolidate efforts
among sustainability-related groups and advocate for
funding for those groups before the Senate Appropria
tions Committee and other funding sources.
If elected, the two would also create a shared contact
