# Katherine Heflin and Daniel Leifer
## NO-RAIN CAMPAIGN EXECUTIVE SLATE 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Although the No Rain campaign's initial promises
were facetious the slate began its run by promising to
eliminate bothersome precipitation from Stanford's
campus the candidates insist they are serious about
changing the ASSU.
Now, ASSU executive hopefuls Katherine Heflin *ll
and Daniel Leifer 'lO are running on a platform of wide
spread reform across dining, housing, student wellness,
accessibility and ASSU practices.
"We want the elections process to be about issues and
the way the executive can actually change the student
body," Leifer said in an interview with The Daily. "We like
our ideas, we think they're really good, and we think we
add a good element to the race."
Heflin is running as president and Leifer as vice pres
ident; the two decided on their positions by flipping a
coin. The two candidates have known each other for a lit
tle more than a year and met by riding the same ASSU
shuttle to San Jose airport.
Heflin's campus accomplishments include being cap
tain of the women's lightweight rowing team and a resi
dent assistant in Potter; she is also involved with the Sex
ual Health Peer Resource Center, The Stanford Progres

sive and various sustainability efforts on campus.
Leifer said he will stay on campus for a fifth year, and
has spent his time at Stanford involved with the Vaden
Advisory Board, Stanford Mini-Med School and Stan
ford in Washington. Both Heflin and Leifer are also for
mer members of The Daily's Editorial Board. Heflin
served in fall of 2008, and Leifer joined in winter of 2009.
Instead of distributing campaign materials such as t
shirts or flyers, the No Rain campaign has decided to di
rect those interested in their platform to their Web site
and, along with several other executive slates, did not
seek public financing. Their Web site's home page says,
"Your student fees are subsidizing the obnoxious posters
and t-shirts on campus because of campaign finance
laws," which is incorrect; public campaign financing funds
are drawn from the ASSU executive budget. In the slate's
blog post on the same subject, the error is corrected.
"Our campaign represents the ASSU that we want to
see: one that's sophisticated, one that's not in your face,"
Leifer said.

Heflin and Leifer said they have the most combined
time as Stanford students among the slates seven
years total at the end of this school year.
"The graduate student slate candidates [Ryan Pea
cock and Jonathan Bakke] are older, but we understand
Stanford from a lot of different angles," Heflin said.
Although the two candidates have been involved with
various communities and organizations on campus, nei
ther has held an elected position within the ASSU, al
though they see their "outsider status" as a boon rather
than a hindrance.
"I don't really see that as a being an issue. I see that as
a good thing," Heflin said. "Everyone who's been in the
ASSU can tell you: 'Oh, we learned how to schmooze and
how to promise people things that we don't intend to de
liver on.'"
No Rain Campaign's other proposed policy initiatives
include releasing textbook ISBNs before the start of the
quarter and restructuring the ASSU special fees election
process. The slate characterizes its proposed changes to
the special fees process as a "pretty original remedy,"
which they said would allow students to vote for one of
three budgets per student group instead of one out of
two. Changes to the special fees election process could re
quire an amendment to the ASSU constitution or ap
proval by the legislative bodies.

Although the slate is comprised
of two undergraduate students, No
Rain expressed confidence that they
could reach out to the graduate stu
dent population at Stanford.
"We have an understanding of
graduate issues," Leifer said. "A lot
of what we do on [the] Vaden Advi
sory Board has to do with graduate

students."
"I know [Escondido Village] like

the back of my hand," Heflin added.
Heflin and Leifer have also ex
pressed being "disillusioned" by the
endorsement process.
"We've been surprised at how
many [endorsing] groups seem more
interested in having spots on [the
ASSU executive] cabinet than de
termining who would be the best
cabinets," Leifer said.
The slate has one endorsement
from Colleges against Cancer, and
declined to discuss which other en
dorsements they were seeking.
