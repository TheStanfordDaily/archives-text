# Ryan Peacock and Jonathan Bakke
## PEACOCK AND BAKKE EXECUTIVE SLATE 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Touting their experience both within the ASSU and
prior to coming to Stanford, ASSU presidential candidate
Ryan Peacock and his vice presidential pick, Jonathan
Bakke, are running to rein in the executive office's agen
da and "change the status quo."
"We think there is definite need for changes to the sta
tus quo, and having been involved with the ASSU in dif
ferent aspects of it and having a lot of leadership coming
in to Stanford, we think we could bring fresh ideas," Pea
cock said. "We've seen good things happen in the last few
years but we've also seen a lot of things that aren't neces
sarily as positive as they should have been."
Peacock and Bakke also the first doctoral students
to run together for executive in ASSU history believe
their backgrounds on the legislative side and Nomina
tions Commission, respectively, are a "nice marriage of
skills," Bakke said. Peacock is serving his second term on
the Graduate Student Council (GSC), while Bakke spent
two years on the University Committee on Research be
fore serving as Nominations Commission chair this year.

Bakke was also elected vice president of Stanford's chem
ical engineering action committee.
"We've been involved with the ASSU pretty much as
much as the other candidates have, but we do also have
the experience from completely different systems at other
universities," Peacock said.
Both members were active in student government
when they were undergraduates: Peacock was the presi
dent of his residential college at Rice in his senior year and
Bakke served on theTulane Engineering Student Council
for two years.
The two met in spring of 2006 at the recruiting week
end for the chemical engineering doctoral program.
Aiming for a more equal partnership than current
ASSU President David Gobaud's favored style, the pair is
pushing an agenda of a more manageable size than the
wide-ranging platform of Gobaud, a coterminal student in
computer science. The slate is instead focusing on advo
cating for students and internal reforms; student-initiated
programs, supported through an executive discretionary
grant program, would tackle smaller issues, they said.
"One of the things we really want to focus on [is],
'What are the core things the execs should be doing?'"
Peacock said. "And that is advocating on behalf of the stu
dent body to the administration and then making sure you
are facilitating student groups."
"If you're spending all that time managing those peo
ple, how much time are you really getting to focus on the
important task at hand?" Peacock added, noting the di
minishing returns of a large cabinet.
Peacock and Bakke shied from the notion that the ex
ecutive should play a strong oversight role for the Under
graduate Senate and GSC.
"I don't think the executive's role is to tell either of the
legislative bodies how to operate with their funds or with
their policies," Bakke said. "But there should be checks
and balances."
The slate remains supportive of the headway ASSU
has made this year despite a few controversial issues, par
ticularly in regard to progress in finance reform, ethics re
form and public financing for elections.
"1 think the ASSU realizes it's an important institution
and recognizes its independence from the administra
tion," Peacock said. "But more things need to be done."
The slate received the endorsement of the Stanford
Review Editorial Board on Monday.
