## THOM AND STEPHANIE EXECUTIVE SLATE 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Juniors Thom Scher and Stephanie Werner say they
have a simple formula for student government: put stu
dents first.
An ASSU led by Scher and Werner would, according
to the pair, be tuned to the interests and wishes of stu
dents. Instead of coming into office with a strictly prede
termined agenda, the pair instead hopes to draw on stu
dents for cues as to what projects the ASSU executive
should take on.
"We actually want to change the system," Scher said.
"We want to refocus the ASSU on what students want and
on helping students do what they wanted to do."
Scher and Werner highlighted their pair's experience
with campus administrators as part of their qualifications
for the job. Scher, who heads Charity Fashion Show, works
for Student Activities and Leadership Director Nanci Howe
and serves as a Judicial Affairs panelist and counselor.
They first met at the Stanford High School Summer Col
lege (HSSC) program in 2006.
Werner runs the business division of the fashion show;

she once served on the editorial board of The Daily and has
worked for the CoHo since it reopened. (She said she is no
longer on the cafe's payroll, but does receive food discounts
for helping plan programming there.)
Their campus experience marks a difference, Scher and
Werner said, from the past two executive administrations.
"The last two executives were very much big issue slates
that focused on getting the student body to support their
agenda as opposed to we want our agenda to be com
posed based on the wants and needs of the student body,
which is a very different approach," Werner said.
Two years ago, Jonny Dorsey 'O9 and Fagan Harris 'O9
were elected after making big promises to tackle issues like
mental health and public service.This philosophy was large
ly continued by current president David Gobaud, a cotermi
nal student in computer science, who served in the Dorsey-
Harris cabinet.
But Scher and Werner said they would like to take a dif
ferent philosophy, and attempt to hew closer to what they
think students actually want out of the ASSU.
Still, the two pointed out that Gobaud has garnered a mix
of both big-picture accomplishments, like forming the
Green Alliance for Innovative Action, and tangible results,
like Stanford e-mail addresses for life.
They said that the Gobaud administration has been
weaker in wellness they did not think Wellness Week was
a success and transparency.
Scher and Werner also hope to improve upon the current
relationship between the executive and the ASSU's legisla
tive branches: the Graduate Student Council and Under
graduate Senate.
"I think you don't let [the Senate] get that far out of con
trol," Werner said. "I think it's about forging a working rela
tionship with them."
Scher and Werner have received an endorsement from
the Queer Coalition at this issue's press deadline. They de
clined to interview for The Daily's endorsement at the last
minute after objecting to the presence of one editorial board
member who they said was affiliated with the Students of
Color Coalition (SOCC), an endorsing group.
The member, Ana Diaz-Hernandez 'll, was endorsed by
SOCC when she ran for Senate last year.
