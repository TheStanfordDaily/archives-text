# Billy Kemper and Josh Meisel
## TWO DOPE BOYS IN A CADDYLACK EXECUTIVE SLATE 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
In an election race that's commonly plagued by empty
promises, "feel-good" phrases like "let's sit down with ad
ministrators and work this out" and platitude- and rhyme
driven posters, the ASSU executive slate "Two Dope Boys
in a Caddylack" that is, Billy Kemper 'll and Josh
Meisel 'l2 strives to remind voters to honor what they

call the real motives behind the ASSU election.
"Vote Kemper-Meisel... because the other candi
dates are hell of lame," Kemper said in an interview with
The Daily.
The slate, which proudly claims the only Stanford
Chaparral endorsement, was very specific about their
campaign promises, which include "boxers and briefs" and
"more Red Bull, more often." While other campaigns put
forth great effort to address weaknesses in mental health
resources and student government reform, the two "Dope
Boys" aren't wasting voters' time by beating around the
bush.
"We're really in it for the money and the power," Kem
per explained. "That's our first concern. And the girls."
The two said that along with the elusive Chaparral en
dorsement, they also have garnered endorsements from
the Jewish Coalition, Red Bull, the New York Mets, the
United States Postal Service, Stanford Athletics, the "prin
cipal of Stanford," Mrs. Johnson from fourth period, Nike
and Fraiche.
Kemper and Meisel share a close relationship that they
believe makes them highly qualified to lead the student
body as a pair.
"We're very close," Meisel said. "Over spring break,
Billy's mom came and stayed with me."
"Two Dope Boys in a Caddylack" has constructed a vi
sion for the future of Stanford, including an ideal setting
where the campus would have more "golf-cart kinda
things that are environmentally safe instead of using bikes
that mark up the arcades."
Kemper and Meisel did not shy away from pointing out
their unique qualifications for ASSU executive. Kemper,
the presidential candidate, said he is majoring in ergonom
ics. Meisel, on the other hand, is reportedly majoring in cre
ative reading and can lick his shoulder.
The two candidates say they look forward to the com
petition offered by five other executive slates, but not as
much as they look forward to bettering themselves
through the election process.
"Our main competition at this point is probably our
selves at this point," Meisel said. "We're probably the only
thing keeping ourselves from winning at this point."
