# STUDENT GOV'T
## GSC candidates run for fifteen seats 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Sixteen graduate students are vying
for seats on the Graduate Student
Council in Friday's election. While
most candidates are running unop
posed, some district representative po
sitions, mainly within the engineering,
natural sciences and medicine districts,
have several contenders.
Though all members of the graduate
student community are considered
GSC members, only 15 are elected to
voting council membership. Elected
representatives attend weekly meet
ings to work on advocacy, programming
and funding student groups.
Additionally, as one of the two leg
islative bodies of the ASSU, the GSC
represents the graduate student popula
tion's voice in some University matters.
The engineering district will have
five contenders for two spots: Drew
Kennedy, a graduate student in bioengi
neering, Kerensa Gimre in civil and en
vironmental engineering, Tao Chu in
electrical engineering, Joanna
Lankester in electrical engineering and

Yichuan Ding in management science
and engineering. Kennedy is the only
current GSC member of the lot.
Within the School of Humanities
and Sciences, Fanuel Muindi in biology
and Erik Lehnert in genetics are facing
off for the natural sciences district rep
resentative position.
Running unopposed for social sci
ences district representative is Salvador
Zepeda in management science and en
gineering and public policy. Praveen
Shanbhag in philosophy is the only hu
manities district candidate.
Only three students are running for
the five spots of at-large district repre
sentatives Addy Satija and Ze Yuan
in electrical engineering and Crystal
Yin in management science and engi
neering. Satija is a three-year veteran of
the GSC and is currently a co-coordina
tor of programming. Yin, also a current
member, is secretary.

School of Medicine students Jessica
Tsai in neuroscience and Krystal St.
Julien in biochemistry are running for
one spot as the medicine representa
tive, Tsai is a current GSC member,
serving as a co-coordinator of pro-

gramming and Vaden Advisory Com
mittee member. St. Julien is a member
of the funding committee.
Ping Li, a business student, is the
only candidate for the one spot in the
School of Business district. Similarly,
Justin Brown in geophysics is the only
contender for the one position as
Earth Sciences representative. Both Li
and Brown are current GSC members,
serving as funding committee chair
and deputy funding committee chair,
respectively. Brown is a three-term
veteran of the GSC.
Currently, there are no reported
candidates from the Stanford Law
School or the School of Education.
Candidates had the choice of using
public funds for their campaigns or do
nating the money to Get Out The Grad
Vote (GOTGV) events. So far, Brown,
Tsai, St. Julien and Gimre have donat
ed; Satija used the funds for his cam
paign; and Lehnert remains undecid
ed. The remaining candidates did not
comment by press time.
