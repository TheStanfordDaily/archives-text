## EDITORIAL Cardona and Wharton for ASSU executive 
### 
The Stanford Daily Editorial Board unani
mously endorses the slate of Angelina
Cardona 'll and Kelsei Wharton 'l2 for
the ASSU executive position in the April 8 stu
dent body election. Of the three slates inter
viewed, the Editorial Board felt that Cardona
and Wharton best embodied the combination of
broad vision and practical experience necessary
to effectively head the ASSU executive.
On Saturday, April 3, the Editorial Board met
with the three executive slates that were seeking
our endorsement in the coming election Car
dona and Wharton, Peacock/Bakke and the No
Rain Campaign. While the Editorial Board found

positive qualities in each of the three slates, our
final support easily went to Cardona and Whar
ton, who presented the clearest and most feasible
set of goals for next year's executive. While the
Peacock/Bakke slate showed a strong level of ex
perience and leadership, their platform was shaky
on specific details; and while the No Rain Cam
paign's platform contained a clear set of goals for
the executive, they themselves did not convey a
sufficient degree of experience or understanding
of the ASSU. Cardona and Wharton, however,
presented both a well-outlined set of goals and the

experience necessary to accomplish
them.
With regards to the specifics of Car
dona and Wharton's platform, the
Board was thoroughly impressed with
their commitment to sexual assault pre
vention, transparency and working with
the new ASSU Senate to forge a more
united ASSU. Whereas this year's Sen
ate and executive have been consistent
ly at odds with each other, Cardona and
Wharton both seasoned veterans in
the ASSU have already opened lines
of dialogue with the future ASSU Sen
ate, interacting with each Senate candi
date in advance of Thursday's election.
With this year's Senate due for replace
ment, the Editorial Board believes that
Cardona and Wharton, if elected, would
make great strides towards ending the
divisiveness and partisanship of the

ASSU.
Furthermore, in the course of the in
terview, Cardona and Wharton both
showed a level of humility and openness
that we believe would be an asset to the
executive office. In response to our con
cerns with Cardona's role in the found
ing of the Wellness Room, Cardona ac
knowledged the negative conception
many students have for the Wellness
Room, and promised that the projects
she and Wharton undertake as execu
tive officers will reflect the needs and
concerns of the campus community.
In a controversial move, the slate of
Thorn and Stephanie chose at the last
minute not to be interviewed by the Ed
itorial Board, and to withdraw them
selves from consideration for the Edito
rial Board endorsement. Despite the
precautions the Editorial Board took to
publicly explain the endorsement
process and eliminate potential con
flicts of interest, the Thorn and
Stephanie slate still found the presence
of one our board members unaccept
able. They took issue with the fact that

the newest member of the Editorial
Board, Ana Diaz-Hernandez 'll, was
endorsed by Students of Color Coali
tion (SOCC) while serving as a senator.
Despite the fact that she no longer par
ticipates in any SOCC activities, includ
ing their endorsement, Thorn and
Stephanie remained convinced that
Diaz-Hernandez was biased simply be
cause she remained listed as a fan of
SOCC on Facebook.

The irony of this unfortunate situa
tion is that, prior to Thorn and
Stephanie's refusal of our interview, the
Editorial Board believed, based solely
on the content of their platform, that
theirs was one of the strongest slates in
the executive race. But actions speak
louder than words, and their refusal to
be interviewed by an Editorial Board
with one member who has former
SOCC affiliations reveals a level of
petty vindictiveness that we believe is
unbecoming of student body leaders. If
the Editorial Board were to consider all
former affiliations as conflicts of inter
est, then the whole endorsement
process would be made impossible
Stephanie Werner 'll herself is a former
Stanford Daily staff member, while
both Katherine Heflin 'll and Dan
Leifer'lO of the No Rain Campaign are
former Daily Editorial Board members.
If Thorn and Stephanie refuse to be in
volved with the Editorial Board be
cause one of its members was once a
SOCC-endorsed senator, then we have
major concerns with how well Thorn
and Stephanie, if elected, would work
with, or not work with, senators and
other ASSU officials with SOCC affilia
tions.

Here again, the Editorial Board
finds cause for hope in the Cardona and
Wharton slate. Their commitment to
communication with students, to bring
ing together the diverse cultures and or
ganizations of Stanford for broad col
laboration, is precisely what the Stan
ford community needs in this time of di
vision, suspicion and alienation. In Car
dona and Wharton's words, the Editori
al Board found a message of inclusive
ness that seeks to bring together the
whole Stanford community gradu
ate and undergrad, SOCC and Students
United Now (SUN), man and woman
to accomplish realistic goals for the
betterment of the whole community.
For this reason, we extend our full sup
port to the Cardona and Wharton slate
in this Thursday's election.
