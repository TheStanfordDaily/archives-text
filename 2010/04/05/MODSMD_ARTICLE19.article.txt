# ASSU executive slate guest columns
## 
### KAMIL DADA President Editor in Chief 
I extended an offer to all of the
ASSU executive slates to write a
guest column for The Daily. In
order to be fair, all slates were given
exactly the same amount of time to
write their column. With regard to

content, the only restriction was a
word length of 650 words. They
could use the space to summarize
their platforms, address specific
points about what they would do if
elected, or discuss any other perti-

nent issues. The columns are print
ed here in full and displayed in re
verse alphabetical order.
