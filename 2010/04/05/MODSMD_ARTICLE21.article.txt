# THOM AND STEPHANIE EXECUTIVE SLATE
## Thorn Scher and Stephanie Werner 
### 
Why should you vote next week for an ASSU Ex
ecutive? What impact will that Executive have
on your experience at Stanford? Most impor
tantly, why should you vote Thorn and Stephanie?
You should vote for us because we care about the
things that you care about. And we know how to make the
changes you want to see happen. We already have a work
ing relationship, both between the two of us and with var
ious aspects of the administration. We want to work with
students to figure out exactly what you want done by the
Executive.
For us, this position isn't about anything more than the
students; what you want is what we want to give you if
elected. You should vote because we actually want to
make changes that can affect you.
A New Approach: Students First:
"Students First" is a novel approach to the ASSU Ex
ecutive - we aim to focus on issues that students care
about, to facilitate collaboration between students, to en
hance the quality of student life at Stanford. Concretely,
we aim to execute the "Students First" approach in two
ways.
First, for the major issues and initiatives into which the
University and various student groups are already pour
ing significant resources - Sustainability, Wellness, etc - we
believe in increasing student input and student group col
laboration.
Second, we believe in devoting a significant portion of

our energy and weight, should we be elected, to making
concrete changes on the smaller issues that often get over
looked, including streamlining the party planning process,
instituting an ASSU Oversight Commission, and clarify
ing policies and procedures across campus.
Working Relationship:
Contrary to the typical ASSU Executive slate, our
partnership was not engineered in an effort to appeal to
various sectors of the student population. Instead, we
have a long-standing, intimate working relationship, and
we believe that this is one of our greatest strengths. Even
before declaring candidacy, our calendars had been
synced. Having worked together for a year and a half on
Charity Fashion Show, we have each become incredibly
knowledgeable about the other's working style and all the
idiosyncrasies.
