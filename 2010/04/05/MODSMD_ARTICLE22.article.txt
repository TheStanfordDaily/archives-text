# PEACOCK AND BAKKE EXECUTIVE SLATE
## Ryan Peacock and Jonathan Bakke 
### 
Peacock and Bakke. You might ask, what do we have to
offer? We have a combined sixteen years of leader
ship experience between Stanford and our under
graduate universities. Thus, we will bring a new approach to
running the ASSU and to creating professional working re
lationships with the administration. Our goal is to work on
issues that impact students instead of creating initiatives
that bear little chance of fruition.
Our first actions as executive will be reform. Within our
own organization, we need to drastically reduce the size
and stipends of the cabinet, including those of the president
and vice president by half. Trust must be restored in the
ASSU by assuring students that finances are handled prop
erly at all levels of government. To do this, accountability of
elected officials must be restored. Further, the relationship
of the executive with the administration must be revamped.
We will work to establish relationships so that we are able
to work towards common goals. It is our view that the main
priority of the executive should be advocating for students
to the administration. With our wealth of experience, we
are by far the most qualified slate for quickly developing re
lationships conducive to implementing change.
The second goal of the executive should be to facilitate
the passionate and knowledgeable VSOs to achieve their
goals. To accomplish this, we will implement a new Execu
tive initiative grant program. This program will consist of
ourselves and our cabinet calling for proposals by VSOs on
campus that target immediate and important issues. We will
use the executive funds to directly support these VSOs in
accomplishing their efforts which otherwise may not ad

dressed. In contrast to previous years, this program will re
duce redundancies within the Executive by utilizing the ex
isting infrastructure and knowledge of the many capable
VSOs on campus.
While it is impossible for us to predict the most pressing
issues for the 2010 - 2011 academic year, we do have ideas of
pertinent issues. Our general focus will be on issues that di
rectly affect the day to day lives of students. For example, we
want to address the effectiveness of the undergraduate aca
demic advising program. Having been undergraduates and
as current graduate students, we understand issues that af
fect the system from both sides. In addition to working with
the administration on this topic, we believe that one solution
will be to leverage the talent of the student body to assist in
the advising process. Upperclassmen can offer advice to un
derclassmen, and graduate students can offer insight to up
perclassmen about opportunities after Stanford. The above
is just one example of the approach we will bring to student
advocacy.
In summary, we want to decrease wasteful practices of
the Executive while increasing the ability of the ASSU to
impact student life on campus. On April 8 and 9, you have

the choice to re-elect the status quo or
to choose a new path for the future of
theASSU.
