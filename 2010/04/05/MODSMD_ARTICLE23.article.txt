# NO-RAIN CAMPAIGN EXECUTIVE SLATE
## Katherine Heflin and Daniel Leifer 
### 
Why support the No-Rain Campaign? We give
you 6 tangible reasons. Our textbook proposal
could save you hundreds of dollars. Currently,
professors give the Stanford Bookstore their textbook
selections weeks before the start of the quarter. We want
to expand this, and have them also submit the ISBNs of
their textbook selections to an ASSU-operated website.
That way students who want cheaper books can order
their textbooks online ahead of time and avoid the hassle
of the bookstore. You could save hundreds of dollars a
quarter.
We have the most leadership experience and knowl
edge of Stanford. Katherine 'll is an RA and co-captain
of a varsity sport. Dan 'lO is an Eagle Scout, and he draft
ed one of Hillary Clinton's speeches while working at the
State Department.
We aren't spending money on our campaign. That's
right, no annoying flyers or t-shirts. This election should
be about the issues and not about who blows through the
most money getting out their name. ASSU elections need
reform, and we feel that our own campaign is the best
place to start.
We address real issues. We don't pretend that the Ex
ecutive office can change everything, so we focus on real
istic issues within our reach. Our campaign website
(http://tinyurl.com/norain4exec) features a detailed plat
form and a few of our video documentaries laying out our
stances and our ideas. Take a look for yourself!
We'll try to give students more say over their student
fees. We want people to be able to decide more accurate

ly the amount that groups receive, as opposed to simply
whether or not the group should receive any. In most cir
cumstances, we propose that voters should choose be
tween the group's proposed budget, the Senate's recom
mended budget, or rejecting funding entirely. If students
feel that a group's budget is excessive, they can approve a
reduced (Senate's recommended) budget without
shutting down or debilitating the group. We believe stu
dents, senators, and groups would all benefit from our
proposed system.
We will bring more students into ASSU projects. We
think the way to change campus is by bringing in as many
students as possible and allowing them more say in what
needs to be changed. We want to set up student "action
groups" where teams of around three students work on
projects that they care about. If you want to make the din
ing hall more sustainable, we would help you find other
students for your action group. Once formed, we would

coordinate with you and work to set
up meetings with administrators.

help. Join us, and let's make a better
ASSU!
