# GUZMAN-MAHONEY REFERENDUM DEMANDING ACTION (G-MRDA) EXECUTIVE SLATE
## Austin Guzman and Patrick Mahoney 
### 
Our student body should be its own greatest re
source. With its membership of 14,000 students,
strong organizational framework, the talents of its
representatives, and its massive budget, we should expect
our student leaders to make real improvements to the
collective life we share and love here at Stanford. More
than just "discussing" problems, the entire point of this
union of students is to wield the ASSLJ's collective power
to tackle those capital-P Problems we students share in
common but cannot fix individually.
With all due respect, Guzman/Mahoney believes this
is not the case with the ASSU, at least as long as we've
been here.
The students demand action. It's a bitter pill that the
ASSU has to swallow, and the overwhelming majority of
our support has been built by those students now pushing
for the Guzman/Mahoney ticket because they are tired of
another round of elections which sugarcoat the funda
mental and persistent problems that have a real impact
on our student body. Guzman/Mahoney believes these is
sues won't go away with campaign promises to "discuss
and evaluate" the same issues they did last year, and the
year before that.
The Guzman/Mahoney approach is opposite; we built
and grew our team from the grassroots. We have con
sciously chosen to construct our platform NOT by the

ASSU's past agenda but by asking the mass of ASSU
weary students about which issues are of greatest con
cern. Essentially, the answer was a Referendum on the
following issues: Fixing the Crime Problem, Flolding
Housing Accountable, Advocating for Student Groups,
Revitalizing the Row, and Creating Real Transparency.
That's straight from you guys who contacted us per
sonally about the changes you demand. That's from those
of y'all who have now become our supporters, who think
that for all the resources it commands the ASSU
elections should bring more substantive issues to the table
than whether there are enough plastic bubbles in the
Wellness Room. This is YOUR referendum. Here's a pre
view, but see (G-MRDA.blogspot.com) for the full plat
form.
FIXING THE CRIME PROBLEM - Theft keeps ris-

ing every year.The Stanford PD took
action, and as a result we have a still
rising number of thefts, except now
literally doubled the number of MIP
citations. Negotiating a contract for
an organization with over 14,000 par
ticipants - all members of a valued
market demographic - the Guz
man/Mahoney Executive will negoti
ate a bidding war between real solu
tions to Stanford's laptop theft prob
lem (laptop LoJack, RFID tags, etc)
and keep our possesions safe. As
well, Guzman/Mahoney demands
that University Alcohol education
should be supplemented to educate
about the law and how to dodge it, to
keep us safe from gratuitous MIPs.

HOLDING HOUSING AC
COUNTABLE - Guzman/Mahoney
would spearhead a grievance proce
dure specific to student housing, as
well as an arbitration board to resolve
disputes between the unionized inter
ests of wronged students on one
hand, and ResEd/Housing on the
other. There is no recourse specific to
Housing if they throw your posses
sions away, incorrectly charge you for
extra days, or if Housing/ResEd
transfers/terminates without appeal.
Any public housing authority would
have this, and the ASSU should be
dedicated to protecting your interests
with collective action.
ADVOCATING FOR STU
DENT GROUPS - The hugest anxi
ety for student groups is tightening
budgets, and new student leaders
aren't sure how to handle it. Para
doxically, each group competes for
funding but they're all going to feel
the crunch and all need common
leadership strategies to combat it.
Guzman/Mahoney will transform
and expand the roles of the Execu
tive cabinet into VSO-advocacy po
sitions whose job is to coordinate be
tween groups of similar stripe (En
tertainment, Service, Publications,
etc) to minimize redundant expendi
tures and lobby alternative sources
of funding with shared access, and
coordinate joint events. As well.
Cabinet leaders will host how-to
monthly pizza workshops for VSO
leaders to help navigate new
changes and new challenges.
