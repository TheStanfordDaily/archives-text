# GUZMAN-MAHONEY REFERENDUM DEMANDING ACTION (G-MRDA) EXECUTIVE SLATE
## Austin Guzman and Patrick Mahoney 
### 
Our student body should be its own greatest re
source. With its membership of 14,000 students,
strong organizational framework, the talents of its
representatives, and its massive budget, we should expect
our student leaders to make real improvements to the
collective life we share and love here at Stanford. More
than just "discussing" problems, the entire point of this
union of students is to wield the ASSLJ's collective power
to tackle those capital-P Problems we students share in
common but cannot fix individually.
With all due respect, Guzman/Mahoney believes this
is not the case with the ASSU, at least as long as we've
been here.
The students demand action. It's a bitter pill that the
ASSU has to swallow, and the overwhelming majority of
our support has been built by those students now pushing
for the Guzman/Mahoney ticket because they are tired of
another round of elections which sugarcoat the funda
mental and persistent problems that have a real impact
on our student body. Guzman/Mahoney believes these is
sues won't go away with campaign promises to "discuss
and evaluate" the same issues they did last year, and the
year before that.
The Guzman/Mahoney approach is opposite; we built
and grew our team from the grassroots. We have con
sciously chosen to construct our platform NOT by the

ASSU's past agenda but by asking the mass of ASSU
weary students about which issues are of greatest con
cern. Essentially, the answer was a Referendum on the
following issues: Fixing the Crime Problem, Flolding
Housing Accountable, Advocating for Student Groups,
Revitalizing the Row, and Creating Real Transparency.
That's straight from you guys who contacted us per
sonally about the changes you demand. That's from those
of y'all who have now become our supporters, who think
that for all the resources it commands the ASSU
elections should bring more substantive issues to the table
than whether there are enough plastic bubbles in the
Wellness Room. This is YOUR referendum. Here's a pre
view, but see (G-MRDA.blogspot.com) for the full plat
form.
