# CARDONA-WHARTON EXECUTIVE SLATE
## Angelina Cardona and Kelsei Wharton 
### 
Stanford is an intersection of cultures, backgrounds, be
liefs, and passions. Amid this diversity there is one com
mon thread that, at the end of the day, ties us all togeth
er. The concept of "One Stanford", our campaign theme, was
born from the belief that we all have a stake in one another,
the issues facing our campus cannot be tackled unless we are
unified, and together we can build a community that allows
us to reach our full potential now and after Stanford. We are
Angelina Cardona (C/O 2011) and Kelsei Wharton (C/O
2012) and we are excited to be running for ASSU Executive
Office.
With this theme of "One Stanford" we are striving to en
gage and represent the voices of students. The first step of
doing this was circulating a survey for your input from the
very first day we declared candidacy. We are currently en
dorsed by GAIA, SOCC, The Women's Coalition, and the
Queer Coalition, which all speak to our commitment and
willingness in increasing our knowledge as we work on a di
verse and pertinent set of issues across campus. To give a bet
ter sense of what we are passionate about working on, here
is a glimpse of our platform; the complete version can be
seen at onestanford.com:
Increased Transparency and Credibility:
. Create a platform/agenda that directly represents student
interests through a circulating survey, an online forum, and
creative avenues of interaction (wine & cheese nights, dance
party during campaign week are examples of this)
. Promote a positive working and social relationship with
the Legislative bodies of the ASSU through increased com
munication, while ensuring that student input is accounted

for and valued properly in the Appropriations process.
Health, Wellness, and Safety:
• Become a national leader on the fight against sexual as
sault and relationship abuse
• Leverage the national network created through the
Haiti relief effort to address the sexual assault/rela
tionship abuse with other universities

cation into social event planning training

This is just a glimpse into what we are
going to accomplish in the upcoming
year with your help. These issues may be
