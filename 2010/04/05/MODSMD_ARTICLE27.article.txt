## GAFFNEY'S GAFFE 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was a mixed weekend for the No. 19 Stan
ford baseball team. The Cardinal (13-9) lost two
of three at No. 2 UCLA (23-1), but the team did
hand the Brains their first loss of the season, 8-4
on Friday.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, what ended
up being a series loss could have just as easily
been a series victory or a series sweep.
The series began on Thursday with a 6-5,10-
inning Brains victory. UCLA overcame Stan
ford leads three times and finally won the game
on first baseman Dean Espy's walk-off RBI sin
gle.
The Cardinal had a chance to take the lead in
the top of the ninth inning, but freshman out
fielder Tyler Gaffney fell down rounding third
base on junior shortstop Jake Schlander's one
out single and was tagged out as he attempted to
leap over catcher Steve Rodriguez's tag. Junior
left fielder Ben Clowe followed with a strikeout,
ending the Cardinal rally.
Stanford jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the top
of the first inning off UCLA ace sophomore
Gerrit Cole, and took a 2-1 lead in the top of the
fourth when junior outfielder Dave Giuliani sin
gled with two outs, stole second and scored on
junior second baseman Colin Walsh's RBI sin
gle.
The lead was short-lived, however. In the bot
tom of the fifth, the Brains got to Stanford soph
omore starter Brian Busick, who was making his
first start of the season. The big hit of the inning
came off the bat of UCLA's first baseman Justin

Uribe, a one-out RBI.The Bruins picked up their
second run of the inning when freshman reliever
Mark Appel threw a wild pitch that allowed sec
ond baseman Tyler Rahmatulla to score from
third base and give UCLA the lead.
Stanford tied the game in the top of the sixth
and took a 5-3 lead in the top of the seventh, only

for the bullpen to relinquish the lead in the bot
tom half of the same inning, setting the stage for
the extra-inning Bruin victory.
On Friday, the Cardinal evened the series be
hind a complete victory from sophomore Jordan
Pries. Pries gave up eight hits, walked four and
struck out four while allowing just three earned

runs in his second complete game victory of the
season.
The Cardinal offense broke the game open in
the top of the fifth, scoring seven runs, thanks in
large part to a Bruin error and a passed ball,
which gave the Cardinal six unearned runs. The
biggest hit of the inning came off the bat of fresh
man left fielder Stephen Piscotty, a two-out, two-
RBI double.
Junior catcher Zach Jones continued his hot
hitting in the game. Jones had two hits, including
his fourth home run of the season in the ninth in
ning.
In the rubber match on Saturday, the Cardi
nal couldn't overcome an early 5-1 deficit, as its
ferocious rally came up short in the 7-5 loss.
Sophomore starter Brett Mooneyham con
tinued the wild pitching that has haunted him in
the early season. Despite striking out five Bruins
in his first two innings, Mooneyham lasted just
three innings, giving up five runs on six hits and
walking five. Mooneyham is now 0-4 on the year
