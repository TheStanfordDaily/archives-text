# POMMEL-ED IN POSTSEASON

### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 1 Stanford men's gymnastics
stumbled into the postseason with a
third-place finish at Saturday's con
ference championships at the Univer
sity of Oklahoma in Norman, Okla.
No. 2 Oklahoma captured the 2010
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
title at home with a combined team
score 0f354.550, in an all-around low
scoring meet.
No. 8 California came in second
with a team score 0f354.450. Stanford
earned a score of 347.150. Trailing be
hind were Nebraska (341.650) and
Air Force (329.500).
The conference loss was both dis
appointing and confusing for the
reigning NCA A champions, the Stan
ford men, who went undefeated in
collegiate competition in the regular
season this year.
"We don't really know what hap
pened," said redshirt senior and co
captain Greg Ter-Zakhariants.
"We've been hitting routines in prac
tice, but we either got too comfortable
or too freaked out."
"It was rough. We never really got
into a rhythm," said sophomore Jor
dan Nolff. "I think we were too fo
cused on beating Oklahoma and
posting a huge score in their home
arena instead of on the gymnastics we
needed to do."
Ter-Zakhariants and Nolff may
have both been right. Stanford fal
tered through Saturday's competi
tion and failed to find any rhythm.
The team's first event, parallel
bars, started promisingly with senior
Lucas Hughes scoring a solid 14.35,
but then came two scores in the 13.0
range from sophomore John Martin
and junior Josh Dixon. And, to end
the event, there was an uncharacteris
tically low score of 13.25 from Stan
ford's parallel bars and still rings
standout, redshirt junior and two
time All-American Nick Noone.
On pommel horse, Stanford hard
ly fared any better.
"We got too jittery," Ter-Zakhari
ants said.
Though Ter-Zakhariants deliv
ered a fairly solid set, he missed one
element that brought his routine's

start value down two whole points,
earning a 13.2. The Cardinal contin
ued its downward slide. Several falls
and missed elements later, Ter-Za
khariants' score was the best of the
pommel horse bunch.
Later in the meet, whatever
demons haunted Stanford at the be
ginning of the evening came back on
high bar. Though Martin pulled him
self together after his poor parallel
bars showing to start Stanford off
with a 14.7, his teammates could not
embrace his momentum. Junior and
co-captain Tim Gentry followed Mar
tin with a 13.9, junior Alex Buscaglia
landed with a 13.6 and freshman
Eddie Penev flopped with a 13.25.
Despite the rough opening, Stan
ford managed to find success on still
rings, floor and vault.
"I think we needed to not pay at
tention to the falls and just keep our
heads in the game," said freshman
James Fosco, Stanford's still rings star,
who persevered through a suspected
torn bicep halfway through his rou
tine to score a 15.1
Additionally, Penev, known most
ly for his tumbling and twisting on
floor and vault, provided a solid start
for the Cardinal with a score of 14.0.
Gentry took the event title with a
15.45.
Things continued to look up for
Stanford on floor. Dixon and
Buscaglia posted scores of 15.25 and
15.15, while Penev stole the show with
a 15.75.
On vault, senior Eric Hergenrader
blasted off with a 15.8. Gentry, Penev
and Buscaglia all recuperated from
their high bar lows with scores of 16.1,
15.4 and 15.25, respectively.
But by then, it was too late. Both
Oklahoma and Cal had solid nights
and were neck-and-neck for the con
ference title until the very last rota
tion, when Oklahoma's men put to
gether six solid pommel horse rou
tines to clinch their 10th MPSF con
ference title in 12 years.
In the next two weeks, Stanford
must pull itself together or face a re
peat of its 2008 postseason instead of
its 2009 postseason. In 2008, Stanford
was No. 1 going into the postseason,

In Saturday's conference championships, freshman James Fosco performed
with a suspected torn bicep to give a standout still rings routine
in an otherwise mediocre overall showing for No. 1 Stanford gymnastics.
