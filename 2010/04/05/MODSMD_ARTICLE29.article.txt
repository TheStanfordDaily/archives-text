# Softball uneven in Cal series
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After opening its Pac-10 season
with a win on Thursday night, the
Stanford Softball team played two
more games to wrap up its series with
rival California. The No. 9 Cardinal
(27-5,2-1 Pac-10) and the No. 14 Gold
en Bears (29-8,1-2) split the final two
games of the series. Stanford won Fri
day night's contest, while the Bears
took Saturday's game.
This weekend's series was the first
conference series this year for Stan
ford, which up to this point has been
primarily playing weekend tourna
ments in a round-robin format.
"Playing the same team three
times in a row is a different mindset
than playing five different teams," said
freshman pitcher Teagan Gerhart.
On Friday, Stanford's offense
found its stroke after being ineffective
until the 12th inning of Thursday
night's game.The Cardinal scored two
runs in the second inning off Cal pitch
er Jolene Henderson. The Bears
pulled within one run of Stanford's
lead by scoring in the third. However,
the Card added three more runs in the
fifth inning, knocking Henderson out
of the game. Those two rallies proved
to be enough to overcome Cal, and
Stanford took home a 5-1 win.
Offensively, Stanford was led by
All-American senior left fielder Alis
sa Haber. She had two RBls in the
game, both on a double in the second
inning. The fifth-inning rally began
with sophomore center fielder Sarah
Hassman, who led off the inning with
a bunt single and came around to
score.

The Cardinal's pitchers also con
tinued their domination of Cal's line
up. After shutting the Golden Bears
down for no runs and just three hits in
12 innings on Thursday, Gerhart re
turned to the mound on Friday night.
She pitched all seven innings and al-

lowed six hits and one run. In a total of
19 innings, she allowed just one run
and nine hits, throwing a total of 297
pitches.
Stanford's defense also played the
entire game without committing any
errors.
"Any time you can beat a ranked
opponent two [games] out of three, it
bodes well for you," said head coach
John Rittman. "I re ally like the way we
played the first two games."
But Stanford was unable to carry

its momentum into Saturday's game.
With Gerhart starting her third game
in a row, Cal's offense suddenly found
its spark. It opened the game with a
quick two runs, after its leadoff hitter
reached on an error. Cal pitcher Va
lerie Arioto then sent a Gerhart pitch
over the wall for a two-run home run.
The Bears continued to pound
Gerhart, scoring two runs in both the
third and fourth innings. After four in
nings, she was pulled from the pitch
er's mound in favor of freshman Jenna
Rich, while Cal held a 6-0 lead.
"I know I could have done a lot
better," Gerhart said. "I needed to
have a better mindset coming into this
game."
Meanwhile, Arioto, who had kept
Stanford's hitters off the scoreboard
for more than 11 innings on Thursday
night, continued to pitch extremely
well. Though the Cardinal tallied
seven hits, it was unable to score any
runs. Cal's defense also had a strong
game â€”it surrendered just one
error and turned two double plays.
"Mentally, we made some mis
takes," Rittman said. "Physically,
you're going to make some mis
takes, but the mental ones cost us
today."
"You have to have good pitching,
you have to play defense and you
have to get timely hitting," he contin
ued. "That's what Cal did today and
that's what we did in the first two
games you have to execute [in]
those areas."
Looking ahead, Stanford has four
games next week a single game at
home against UC-Davis, then a series
on the road against conference oppo
nent Oregon State, The Cardinal and
the Aggies have already squared off
once this season, with Stanford taking
a 6-2 win.
"We just can't overlook [UC-
Davis]," Rittman said. "We've got to
