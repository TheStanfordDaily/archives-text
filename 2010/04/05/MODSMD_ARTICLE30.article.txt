# Picking the MLB season
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
Today, all is right in the world.
Fresh cut grass, ambition, hope.
Everyone has a dream, and 162
games from now, we'll see
whose dreams might be com
ing true.
It's officially baseball season.
Every team believes this is their year.
Giants fans are sure AL castaway Aubrey
Huff is going to be the difference in lead
ing their team to the playoffs. A's fans are
certain that Ben Sheets and Justin Duch
scherer will be healthy this year and give
Oakland their version of Tim Lincecum
and Matt Cain at the top of the rotation.
Just like everyone else in the country, I
have my biases and beliels. I'm sure Curtis
Granderson will leam to hit left-handed
pitchers and Javier Vazquez will overcome
his fear of New York and be a force in the
middle of the Yankees' rotation.
But maybe not.
With that, here are my predictions for
the 2010 Major League Baseball season:
AL East In a shocking turn of events, I fore
see the Yankees edging out Boston and
Tampa Bay to win the toughest division in
baseball.
New York's offense is just so deep, and
its rotation is even better with Vazquez,
who finished fourth in the NL Cy Young
voting a year ago when he was playing for
Atlanta.
Boston will give the Yankees all they
can handle, however. Boston added
Marco Scutaro, Adrian Beltre, Mike
Cameron and John Lackey to an already
powerful roster —including the league's
deepest rotation, with arguably three
aces: Lackey, Josh Beckett and John
I .ester.
Tampa Bay has a young, powerful
lineup, but I don't think their pitching can
keep up with the bats of the Yankees and
the Red Sox. Baltimore, though im
proved, is still a few years away from com
peting with their young squad —Adam
Jones, Matt Wieters and Brian Matusz, to
name a few. Toronto will probably strug
gle this season.
AL Central The Kansas City Royals willnot
win this division (for the 25th consecutive
season). I feel confident in saying that.The
Cleveland Indians, having traded away
most of their talent also will not win the di
vision.
The other three teams could all scrap
their way to the top of the heap, but my
money is on the Detroit Tigers.Their rota
tion is strong behind Justin Verlander and
Rick Porcello, and Miguel Cabrera is one
of the most dangerous hitters in the league
(especially now that he gave up alcohol
and will actually be sober on the field).
The Minnesota Twins always seem to
find away to compete, although I think
with closer Joe Nathan hurt and question
marks in the rotation this might be the year
they fall off The Chicago White Sox
should be in contention until Ozzie
Guillen self destructs. I'm predicting early
August.
ALWest rmdrinkingthe Seattle Mariners'
Kool-Aid. Yes, their lineup is mediocre at
best, but their rotation, led by Felix Her
nandez and Giff Lee, is scary good, and
they play very good team defense.
