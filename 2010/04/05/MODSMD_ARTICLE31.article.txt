# Gerhart readies for coming draft
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Toby Gerhart declared for the NFL
Draft in early January. Since then, his life
has been a whirlwind of workouts, med
ical testing, interviews and drills. From
training six days a week in Irvine, Calif,
to performing in front of a legion of
scouts, coaches and front office person
nel at the Combine, Gerhart has been in
full preparation mode for months. He's
aware of the stakes impressing NFL
staffs, and thus solidifying an early round
status, could mean a difference of mil
lions of dollars. And so he works.
No one can dispute Gerhart's success
at the collegiate level. The 2009 Heisman
runner-up ran for 3,522 yards and 43
touchdowns in his career. He started for
two full seasons. The numbers are eye
opening, but production alone does not a
good NFL prospect make.The offseason
leading up to the draft provides an av
enue for teams to evaluate a player's ath
leticism and character, which, along with

amateur accomplishment, helps them
project future success.
"Everyone said I had the intangibles,
the background, the intelligence in terms
of understanding the game, and great
tape," Gerhart said. "I had years of tape
where I ran for a lot of yards and a lot of
touchdowns, but then there are certain
measurables, between the 40 [yard dash]
and my official height and weight and
vertical, that matter, too."
Before doing all of the requisite drills
at the meat market known as the NFL
Combine, the perception of Gerhart was
that he was a good but not great athlete
who may be a step slow and too one-di
mensional for the next level. His draft
status fluctuated anywhere from the late
first round to the fourth. He was viewed
as a fullback and not a running back.
With so much riding on his performanc
es in group and individual workouts,
Gerhart took a leave of absence from
Stanford for winter quarter, dropped off
the baseball team and moved south to
train at the Velocity Sports Performance

Center. There, he spent hours per day on
his lateral and linear speed, cone work,
pass catching, interview tactics, play dia
gramming and so on.
"It was just straight training. I liked
that. I didn't have to worry about school,
I didn't have to worry about anything
else, I was just 100 percent into training,"
he said.
There were two areas of his game
that required particular attention: his
straight-line speed and receiving abili

ties. He was generally seen as a bruiser
that did not have a terrible amount of
quickness; such players rarely find exten
sive success at running back at the next
level. Additionally, he did not catch too
many balls at Stanford it was rarely a
large part of the Cardinal game plan dur
ing his career so teams did not have a
good read on whether or not he could be
a force in the passing game. Lastly, there
