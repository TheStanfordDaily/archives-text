# Gerhart readies for coming draft
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Toby Gerhart declared for the NFL
Draft in early January. Since then, his life
has been a whirlwind of workouts, med
ical testing, interviews and drills. From
training six days a week in Irvine, Calif,
to performing in front of a legion of
scouts, coaches and front office person
nel at the Combine, Gerhart has been in
full preparation mode for months. He's
aware of the stakes impressing NFL
staffs, and thus solidifying an early round
status, could mean a difference of mil
lions of dollars. And so he works.
No one can dispute Gerhart's success
at the collegiate level. The 2009 Heisman
runner-up ran for 3,522 yards and 43
touchdowns in his career. He started for
two full seasons. The numbers are eye
opening, but production alone does not a
good NFL prospect make.The offseason
leading up to the draft provides an av
enue for teams to evaluate a player's ath
leticism and character, which, along with

amateur accomplishment, helps them
project future success.
"Everyone said I had the intangibles,
the background, the intelligence in terms
of understanding the game, and great
tape," Gerhart said. "I had years of tape
where I ran for a lot of yards and a lot of
touchdowns, but then there are certain
measurables, between the 40 [yard dash]
and my official height and weight and
vertical, that matter, too."
Before doing all of the requisite drills
at the meat market known as the NFL
Combine, the perception of Gerhart was
that he was a good but not great athlete
who may be a step slow and too one-di
mensional for the next level. His draft
status fluctuated anywhere from the late
first round to the fourth. He was viewed
as a fullback and not a running back.
With so much riding on his performanc
es in group and individual workouts,
Gerhart took a leave of absence from
Stanford for winter quarter, dropped off
the baseball team and moved south to
train at the Velocity Sports Performance

Center. There, he spent hours per day on
his lateral and linear speed, cone work,
pass catching, interview tactics, play dia
gramming and so on.
"It was just straight training. I liked
that. I didn't have to worry about school,
I didn't have to worry about anything
else, I was just 100 percent into training,"
he said.
There were two areas of his game
that required particular attention: his
straight-line speed and receiving abili

ties. He was generally seen as a bruiser
that did not have a terrible amount of
quickness; such players rarely find exten
sive success at running back at the next
level. Additionally, he did not catch too
many balls at Stanford it was rarely a
large part of the Cardinal game plan dur
ing his career so teams did not have a
good read on whether or not he could be
a force in the passing game. Lastly, there

was a medical question: Gerhart tore his
ACL as a sophomore and was forced to
miss practically the entire season, and
any lingering effects could damage his
draft stock.
And so Gerhart trained, then he
trained some more. For the first time in
his life, he was focusing solely on football
instead of dropping weight to be
come a better baseball player, he was
able to instead work on crafting his body
to NFL specifications.
"I spent the day working out. I was in
the best shape of my life. In terms of
body fat, speed, everything was going
nicely,'' Gerhart said of his time in Irvine.
Then came the Combine in late Feb
ruary, where Gerhart was able to show
off his abilities. Medically, his knee
checked out his MRIs and x-rays
were examined by doctors from every
team. His weigh-in produced no surpris
es: 6-foot-0, 231 pounds, just about
where he was listed as a Cardinal. But
that was simply the calm before the
storm: the drills were ultimately what
mattered, and Gerhart excelled.
"We started out with the vertical
[jump], and that went really well. Then
there was the broad [jump], and that
went pretty well," he said. "Then we got
down to the 40 and for me, everything
was riding on the 40.1 was confident."
"You finish your 40 and you have no
idea what you've ran.They don't tell you
your time," he continued. "I checked my
cell phone to see if anyone was texting
me. One of my roommates from Stan
ford just posted "Hell yeah!" as a text
message so I thought, 'Well, it must have
been pretty good.'"
Indeed, it was: he ran a 4.53 in the
event, a very fast time for a man his size.
With one run, he had answered a wealth
of questions. When he performed flaw
lessly in receiving drills, it was the icing
on the cake to what was seen, uniformly,
as an excellent Combine performance.
"I got a lot of positive feedback,"
Gerhart said. "I didn't see the television
broadcast, but my parents said they were
expecting me to run mid to high 4.65, so
by running a 4.53 it opened a lot of peo
ple's eyes and showed I was much faster
than people thought. It solidified my
draft stock a little more, and it solidified
me playing running back at the next
level."

Post Combine, Gerhart begin indi
vidual workouts. Hie New York Jets flew

their running backs coach out to put him
through drills last week; he will have a
similar meeting with the Denver Bron
cos this week. He has already flown out
to meet the San Diego Chargers, and will
visit the facilities of the Baltimore
Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles.
"It's exciting, but it's also crazy. You
talk to teams and you may get a good
feeling from them, but then they don't
draft you, and a team you never talked to
is someone who picks you," he said.
The draft is less than three weeks
away. For now, Gerhart has established
himself as a late first to mid second
round prospect. He's back at Stanford to
finish his final 13 units; he'll graduate on
time in June. He'll be at home on draft
weekend, surrounded by friends and
family.
"I think we're going to have fun and
enjoy the process and wait for a phone
call. Hopefully it comes earlier rather
than later and we can celebrate."
