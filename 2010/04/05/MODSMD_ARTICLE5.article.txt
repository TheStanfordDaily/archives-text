## Stanford on collision course with UConn 
### TOM TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford pulled safely clear of Ok
lahoma in the final few seconds of its
Final Four clash yesterday to win 73-66
and set up a national championship
showdown with Connecticut.

The Huskies defeated Baylor 70-50
in the other semifinal game, setting up
a loaded final between Stanford and
UConn. In December, the last time the
two sides met, the Card fell to UConn
80-68 in Storrs, Conn.
The Cardinal (36-1, 18-0 Pac-10)
stayed ahead of the Sooners (27-11,11-
5 Big-12) for almost the entire game,
with Oklahoma closing to tie it just
once in the first four minutes. But
Stanford struggled to close out the win
as the No. 3 seed put on a late charge.
The difference that separated the
two sides was ail-American sopho
more forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
who put in a bid for MVP of the tour
nament, scoring the highest number of
points by a single player ever in a na
tional semifinal, 38, and grabbing 16
rebounds.
"My team and my coaches made
me very comfortable," Ogwumike
said. "We wanted to bring a lot of in
tensity. Everyone was really exhilarat
ed and excited. We talked about play
ing with fire, and I think we lit that fire
tonight."
