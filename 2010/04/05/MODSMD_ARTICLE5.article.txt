# SO LONG, SOONERS
## Stanford on collision course with UConn 
### TOM TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford pulled safely clear of Ok
lahoma in the final few seconds of its
Final Four clash yesterday to win 73-66
and set up a national championship
showdown with Connecticut.

The Huskies defeated Baylor 70-50
in the other semifinal game, setting up
a loaded final between Stanford and
UConn. In December, the last time the
two sides met, the Card fell to UConn
80-68 in Storrs, Conn.
The Cardinal (36-1, 18-0 Pac-10)
stayed ahead of the Sooners (27-11,11-
5 Big-12) for almost the entire game,
with Oklahoma closing to tie it just
once in the first four minutes. But
Stanford struggled to close out the win
as the No. 3 seed put on a late charge.
The difference that separated the
two sides was ail-American sopho
more forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
who put in a bid for MVP of the tour
nament, scoring the highest number of
points by a single player ever in a na
tional semifinal, 38, and grabbing 16
rebounds.
"My team and my coaches made
me very comfortable," Ogwumike
said. "We wanted to bring a lot of in
tensity. Everyone was really exhilarat
ed and excited. We talked about play
ing with fire, and I think we lit that fire
tonight."

have been able to do anything," Og
wurnike said. "They gave me the
passes, they screened well for me and
I tried my best to reciprocate that for
them."
Both teams started the contest
with a lot of ugly shots, lacking the
right direction or power. For the first
few minutes neither team managed
to rack up many points, and neither
was able to capitalize on the other's
mistakes.
The Cardinal hit the first points
with over two minutes already gone,
but the Sooners tied the game up
soon after and kept it close until the
13th minute. From there, Stanford
started a 12-1 run and held the mar
gin to lead 34-21 at the half.
At the midpoint of the first half,
the Sooners were shooting just 16
percent from the field, and their
leading scorer, junior guard

Danielle Robinson, shot just 4-12 in
the first half.
Defensively, redshirt senior Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude held senior for
ward Nyeshia Stevenson, a player
who scored 31 points in the Kansas
City Regional Final, to just seven
points before the halftime buzzer.
The defensive approaches of the two
teams were markedly different, Stan
ford allowing the Sooners room to
play but contesting the paint, and Ok
lahoma pressing all over the court.
In the second half, the Cardinal
struggled to make the gap count and
finish its opposition off. Each time a
few flashes of good dynamic play
seemed to be opening a lead, the
Sooners forced mistakes and kept
the game close.
With just 1:21 remaining, senior
forward Amanda Thompson made it
a four-point game with a three
pointer, and brought back memories
of the edgy contest with Xavier just
last week. Senior center Jayne Appel
was on the bench again, but this time
as a tactical move by Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer, who

brought redshirt junior guard JJ
Hones into the game instead. Appel
looked desperate to rejoin the game,
and doubly so when Robinson hit a
layup to close within three points.
Oklahoma was pressing hard and
almost stole the ball with its full
court press off the next play. With 16
seconds remaining, the gap was back
down to three from another Robin
son basket, and the next play was
crucial for both sides. Stanford had
to make its possession count and
Oklahoma deployed a stifling de
fense to hold the Card in its own
half. Only one player was on the
other side of the halfcourt line, Og
wumike.
Junior forward Kayla Pedersen
then took everyone by surprise to
throw a long, looping pass over the
heads of all the other players, leav
ing the Texan alone for an uncon
tested layup.
The Cardinal women finally took
the game home when junior guard
Jeanette Pohlen stole the ball and
Ogwumike drew a foul to head to
the charity stripe one last time.

The lack of accuracy from both
sides played a big role in this game.
Gold-Onwude's three-pointer at
12:22 in the first period was the sin
gle successful shot, out of a total of
15, for the Card from outside the arc.
Meanwhile the Sooners were much
improved in the second half, but
they could not make up for their
sloppy shooting in the first.
"We missed some really, very
make-able shots," VanDerveer said.
"But I'm really proud of our team.
Ros [Gold-Onwude] playing de
fense, Jeanette [Pohlen] played the
whole game and I just think they
tried really hard, and we're excited
to be playing on Tuesday night."
Ogwumike continued her amaz
ing form to lead her team, returning
to the floor a few minutes after hit
ting the ground hard from an Okla
homa foul. Fellow all-American
Appel had a much better game than
earlier in the week, though lingering
doubts about her ankle remain, and
the guards kept Oklahoma honest.
But most of all, the team is through
to the final.

PST from the Alamodome in San
Antonio on Tuesday.
GAME NOTES: No. 2 Stanford advanced to the nation

the Sooners. The Cardinal's only loss of the season
was to the Huskies, who have won 77 games in a row
dating back two seasons.

the game home when junior guard
Jeanette Pohlen stole the ball and
Ogwumike drew a foul to head to
the charity stripe one last time.

The lack of accuracy from both
sides played a big role in this game.
Gold-Onwude's three-pointer at
12:22 in the first period was the sin
gle successful shot, out of a total of
15, for the Card from outside the arc.
Meanwhile the Sooners were much
improved in the second half, but
they could not make up for their
sloppy shooting in the first.
"We missed some really, very
make-able shots," VanDerveer said.
"But I'm really proud of our team.
Ros [Gold-Onwude] playing de
fense, Jeanette [Pohlen] played the
whole game and I just think they
tried really hard, and we're excited
to be playing on Tuesday night."
Ogwumike continued her amaz

to the floor a few minutes after hit
ting the ground hard from an Okla
homa foul. Fellow all-American
Appel had a much better game than
earlier in the week, though lingering
doubts about her ankle remain, and
the guards kept Oklahoma honest.
But most of all, the team is through
to the final.

Stanford pulled safely clear of Ok
lahoma in the final few seconds of its
Final Four clash yesterday to win 73-66
and set up a national championship
showdown with Connecticut.

The Huskies defeated Baylor 70-50
in the other semifinal game, setting up
a loaded final between Stanford and
UConn. In December, the last time the
two sides met, the Card fell to UConn
80-68 in Storrs, Conn.
The Cardinal (36-1, 18-0 Pac-10)
stayed ahead of the Sooners (27-11,11-
5 Big-12) for almost the entire game,
with Oklahoma closing to tie it just
once in the first four minutes. But
Stanford struggled to close out the win
as the No. 3 seed put on a late charge.
The difference that separated the
two sides was ail-American sopho
more forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
who put in a bid for MVP of the tour
nament, scoring the highest number of
points by a single player ever in a na
tional semifinal, 38, and grabbing 16
rebounds.
"My team and my coaches made
me very comfortable," Ogwumike
said. "We wanted to bring a lot of in
tensity. Everyone was really exhilarat
ed and excited. We talked about play
ing with fire, and I think we lit that fire
tonight."

4/4 vs. Oklahoma W 73-66

All-American sophomore forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike charged past Oklahoma
Sooners' Joanna McFarland in the NCAA semifinal Sunday night. Ogwumike
scored a record-breaking 38 points and brought down 16 rebounds.
have been able to do anything," Og
wurnike said. "They gave me the
passes, they screened well for me and
I tried my best to reciprocate that for
them."
Both teams started the contest
with a lot of ugly shots, lacking the
right direction or power. For the first
few minutes neither team managed
to rack up many points, and neither
was able to capitalize on the other's
mistakes.
The Cardinal hit the first points
with over two minutes already gone,
but the Sooners tied the game up
soon after and kept it close until the
13th minute. From there, Stanford
started a 12-1 run and held the mar
gin to lead 34-21 at the half.
At the midpoint of the first half,
the Sooners were shooting just 16
percent from the field, and their
leading scorer, junior guard

Danielle Robinson, shot just 4-12 in
the first half.
Defensively, redshirt senior Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude held senior for
ward Nyeshia Stevenson, a player
who scored 31 points in the Kansas
City Regional Final, to just seven
points before the halftime buzzer.
The defensive approaches of the two
teams were markedly different, Stan
ford allowing the Sooners room to
play but contesting the paint, and Ok
lahoma pressing all over the court.
In the second half, the Cardinal
struggled to make the gap count and
finish its opposition off. Each time a
few flashes of good dynamic play
seemed to be opening a lead, the
Sooners forced mistakes and kept
the game close.
With just 1:21 remaining, senior
forward Amanda Thompson made it
a four-point game with a three
pointer, and brought back memories
of the edgy contest with Xavier just
last week. Senior center Jayne Appel
was on the bench again, but this time
as a tactical move by Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer, who

brought redshirt junior guard JJ
Hones into the game instead. Appel
looked desperate to rejoin the game,
and doubly so when Robinson hit a
layup to close within three points.
Oklahoma was pressing hard and
almost stole the ball with its full
court press off the next play. With 16
seconds remaining, the gap was back
down to three from another Robin
son basket, and the next play was
crucial for both sides. Stanford had
to make its possession count and
Oklahoma deployed a stifling de
fense to hold the Card in its own
half. Only one player was on the
other side of the halfcourt line, Og
wumike.
Junior forward Kayla Pedersen
then took everyone by surprise to
throw a long, looping pass over the
heads of all the other players, leav
ing the Texan alone for an uncon
tested layup.
The Cardinal women finally took
the game home when junior guard
Jeanette Pohlen stole the ball and
Ogwumike drew a foul to head to
the charity stripe one last time.

The lack of accuracy from both
sides played a big role in this game.
