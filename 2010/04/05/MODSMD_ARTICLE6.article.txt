## Palo Alto bids for Google Fiber test 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
Long before they were multibillion-dollar entrepre
neurs or known as the "Google Guys," Sergey Brin M.S. '95
and Larry Page M.S. '9B were like any other computer sci
ence students at Stanford University. Reveling in the robust
Silicon Valley atmosphere of the late '9os, the pair, along
with their peers, embraced the opportunities at an institu
tion on the cutting edge of computer technology.
Paired with their exploration was a bold project that
would later become the basis for a revolutionary online
search engine: Google. But back in those days, when their
project consisted of a few desktops crammed into a dorm

room, Brin and Page sometimes found the going difficult as
Stanford's infrastructure strained to support the pair's
fledgling vision.

Now, more than 10 years later, the company that Brin
and Page founded is still searching for a more advanced so
lution to prevent this type of technological slowdown. In
February, Google announced that it would select a city
through an application process to experiment with a new
"ultra high-speed broadband" network.
When the application period ended on March 26, more
than 1,100 cities had submitted applications to the Moun
tain View-based company to be chosen as the test location.
