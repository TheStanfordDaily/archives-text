## Palo Alto bids for Google Fiber test 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
Long before they were multibillion-dollar entrepre
neurs or known as the "Google Guys," Sergey Brin M.S. '95
and Larry Page M.S. '9B were like any other computer sci
ence students at Stanford University. Reveling in the robust
Silicon Valley atmosphere of the late '9os, the pair, along
with their peers, embraced the opportunities at an institu
tion on the cutting edge of computer technology.
Paired with their exploration was a bold project that
would later become the basis for a revolutionary online
search engine: Google. But back in those days, when their
project consisted of a few desktops crammed into a dorm

room, Brin and Page sometimes found the going difficult as
Stanford's infrastructure strained to support the pair's
fledgling vision.

Now, more than 10 years later, the company that Brin
and Page founded is still searching for a more advanced so
lution to prevent this type of technological slowdown. In
February, Google announced that it would select a city
through an application process to experiment with a new
"ultra high-speed broadband" network.
When the application period ended on March 26, more
than 1,100 cities had submitted applications to the Moun
tain View-based company to be chosen as the test location.
Among those applications was one
from Palo Alto, which city officials
believe has a great chance of attract
ing Google's interest.
The company proposed the proj
ect, dubbed Google Fiber, after
prompting the Federal Communica
tions Commission to reexamine its
current National Broadband Plan.
The experiment promises fiber-to
home connections that could make
Internet speeds up to 100 times
faster.
Palo Alto City Planner James
Keene said the city has a number of
qualities that would make it attrac
tive to Google, including a 40-mile
fiber ring already in place that may
prove a solid foundation for the
company to improve upon. He also
noted the city's reputation as the
birthplace of Silicon Valley, refer
encing how Hewlett Packard was
started out of a garage in downtown
Palo Alto.
Keene believes Palo Alto's con
nection and proximity to the Uni
versity could also prove an advan
tage in the city's bid for Google
Fiber.
"Palo Alto and Stanford have
this intertwined relationship where
[the Palo Alto] community is very
much a result of the intellectual and
creative capital from Stanford,"
Keene said.
While the city had already gained
support from a number of large
companies in the area, including
Tesla and Facebook, Stanford's
backing for the proposal became a
major boon for Palo Alto, according
to Keene.
In a March 15 e-mail, the city
manager asked Larry Horton, Stan
ford's senior associate vice presi
dent of government and community
relations, and the University to pub
licly support the city's application.
"We hope and believe that Stan
ford will benefit by having every
Palo Alto residence and business
wired (fibered, really) for gigabit
speed Internet access," Keene
wrote. "Your employees, associated
staff and professional services locat
ed in Palo Alto would have state-of
the-art access and the ability to work
on and develop connectivity poten
tials not otherwise available today."
Stanford threw its weight behind
the proposal, and Horton said he
was "eager to see city improve its in
frastructure" and could "only imag
ine it doing good things."
While officials were unsure
whether or not Google Fiber would
be provided on campus if Google
picks Palo Alto, Keene believes the
network would definitely benefit
the Stanford community and further
drive innovative thinking, whether it
is out of a home garage or at Stan
ford Hospital.
"For an economy that's going to
increasingly rely on innovation and
creativity ... we better build the in
frastructure with high-speed fiber, a
creative roadway of the future,"
Keene said. "A place like Palo Alto
is already full of doctors and Inter
net users, and imagine if we were
able to ramp that up and start a new
wave of innovation and creativity."
"With Stanford there's a big en
gine that generates Silicon Valley,"
Keene added. "Everyone is aware of
that. Both our tradition history and
linkage with Stanford and their sup
port for our application, we think, is
critically important."
