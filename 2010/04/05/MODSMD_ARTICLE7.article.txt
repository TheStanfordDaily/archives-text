## Four sophomore slates announced 
### BRIANNA PANG KABIR SAWHNEY 
Now seasoned with two quarters of experience on the
Farm, 16 freshmen have entered the race for sophomore
class president.
They are organized into four slates: "Think Thirteen"
with Brennen Clouse, Cordelia Sendax, AdinaTecklu and
Stephanie Webb; "So-Phresh" with Joel Aguero, Imani
Franklin, Elise Geithner and Thomas Hendee;"iThirteen"
with Camilla Boyer, Nelson Estrada, Adam Klein and
Greg Naifeh; and "Sophs 4 More" with Steven Greitzer,

Shane Hegde, Misha Nasro and Maxine Litre.
The elected four will be responsible for planning and
executing events for sophomores throughout next year.
Before one slate can take up the responsibility of ad
ministering the sophomore class' sl2,ooobudget, the slates
will campaign throughout the week in an attempt to gar
ner as many votes as possible.
Financing these campaigns has been one of the more
contentious issues in the past, and this year is no exception.
Think Thirteen members said they expected to spend
around $350, while the remaining three
slates said they would each spend
roughly $BOO.
Members of each slate said they
would be funding their campaigns al
most exclusively out of their own
pockets, though each slate is also
seeking $7O in public financing.
The presidents will plan tradition
al events such as Full Moon on the
Quad and Sophomore Formal. In in
terviews with The Daily, the four
slates generally had similar ideas
about how to run these events. Each
slate suggested a conventional ap
proach with "improvements."
Funding for Full Moon was threat
ened in 2009, and slates offered their
takes for how they would address
funding later this year. Think Thirteen
members said they would seek spon
sorships from Palo Alto businesses, as
did Sophs 4 More and iThirteen. The
Sophs slate also said they would seek
Senate funding, while So-Phresh
members said they would try to carry
money over from Frosh Council.
Other differences emerged when
the slates discussed their own ideas
for original programming.
Two slates emphasized the impor
tance of public service in their goals
for next year. Both So-Phresh and
Think Thirteen discussed hopes to

mobilize the sophomore class to ex
pand Stanford's impact on the sur
rounding community.
"People say we're not in touch
with stuff outside of Stanford but I
think people really want to help, so
we want to try to make helping and
getting involved in the community
and getting involved in the world
more accessible," Geithner said.
So-Phresh mentioned the idea of
"Soph Serve," a day of service that
would take place on Martin Luther
King, Jr. Day. Think Thirteen empha
sized a similar concept; in their plat
form, they highlight "One Day To
wards a Better Community."
Sophs 4 More pointed out the lack
of social options for people less in
clined to regularly visit the Row.
Mainly concerned about social life,
the slate plans to organize "Off the
Row Fridays."
"We want to brainstorm and hold
events that will attract a larger audi
ence of people who really don't go to
the Row that often," Greitzer said.
"We think there really should be so
much more offered on the weekends
and that there should be other op
tions out there."
The final slate, iThirteen, was
chiefly interested in class unity. They
outlined plans for numerous social
events and gatherings, including a
sophomore beach day. The slate's
main plan is to organize tailgates
around athletic events, including
football and women's basketball
games.

In keeping with their campaign's
Apple theme, the candidates also ex
pressed a desire to create an iThirteen
application fortheiPhone, which would
have the social calendar for the class.
"We're not issues-oriented," Boyer
said. "We're trying to include everyone
as event planners."
Boyer said this was her slate's rea
son for choosing not to seek any en
dorsements. Sophs 4 More also did not
pursue endorsements from student
groups.
According to Think Thirteen's
Clouse, his slate also did not pursue
endorsements due to a "lack of time"
to devote to the applications.
So-Phresh was therefore the only
sophomore class president slate to
seek endorsements, winning support
from both the Women's Coalition
and the Queer Coalition.
"One of the things we want to do is
celebrate diversity and bring people
together and promote class unity,"
Geithner said.
All four members of So-Phresh
are current members of Frosh Coun
cil. Additionally, two members of
Sophs 4 More, Hegde and Greitzer,
are Frosh Council members. No can
didates from iThirteen or Think Thir
teen have Frosh Council experience.
However, iThirteen's Naifeh, Estrada
and Klein all have experience as dorm
presidents.
