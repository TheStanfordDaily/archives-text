# Candidates endorsed
## Groups name support for ASSU hopefuls 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Students woke up Friday
morning to find their Facebook
pages, hallways and stairwells
plastered with the smiling faces
of ASSU candidates. The 2010
campaign week opened Friday
with two more endorsement
announcements and the debut
of two new Senate coalitions.
The Students of Color Coali
tion (SOCC) and the Queer
Coalition joined the endorse
ment flurry, adding to the four
groups that released their picks
earlier last week. The editorial
boards of The Stanford Daily,
The Stanford Review and The
Stanford Progressive published
endorsements on Monday.
Any group or individual is
free to endorse candidates for
any position, and candidates
traditionally display their en
dorsements on their campaign
materials.

"In some cases, the endors
ing groups are VSOs [voluntary
student organizations], but in
many cases they're just groups
of students getting together,"
wrote ASSU Elections Com
missioner Quinn Slack 'll in an
e-mail to The Daily. The Elec
tions Commission does not reg
ulate the endorsing process.

The Stanford Conservative
Society will publish their en
dorsement Wednesday. The
Stanford Democrats are also

expected to endorse candi
dates.

Executive Race
The executive slate of An
gelina Cardona 'll and Kelsei
Wharton 'l2 has received the
most endorsements, earning
nods from SOCC, the Queer
Coalition, the Green Alliance
for Innovative Action (GAIA),
the Women's Coalition, Califor
nia College Democrats and the
editorial boards of The Stan
ford Daily and The Stanford
Progressive.
The Queer Coalition also
endorsed juniors Thorn Scher
and Stephanie Werner, while
the No-Rain Campaign of
Katherine Heflin 'll and
Daniel Leifer 'lO received the
endorsement of Stanford Col
leges Against Cancer.
The Stanford Review Edito
rial Board endorsed graduate
students Ryan Peacock and
Jonathan Bakke.
Undergraduate Senate

Facebook early Friday morn
ing, endorsing 12 Senate candi
dates: sophomores Michael
Cruz, Ben Jensen and Rafael
Vasquez and freshmen Milton
Achelpohl, Pat Bruny, Katie
Cromack, Madeline Flawes,
Deepa Kannappan, Daniel
