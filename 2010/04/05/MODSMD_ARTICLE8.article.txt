# Candidates endorsed
## Groups name support for ASSU hopefuls 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Students woke up Friday
morning to find their Facebook
pages, hallways and stairwells
plastered with the smiling faces
of ASSU candidates. The 2010
campaign week opened Friday
with two more endorsement
announcements and the debut
of two new Senate coalitions.
The Students of Color Coali
tion (SOCC) and the Queer
Coalition joined the endorse
ment flurry, adding to the four
groups that released their picks
earlier last week. The editorial
boards of The Stanford Daily,
The Stanford Review and The
Stanford Progressive published
endorsements on Monday.
Any group or individual is
free to endorse candidates for
any position, and candidates
traditionally display their en
dorsements on their campaign
materials.

"In some cases, the endors
ing groups are VSOs [voluntary
student organizations], but in
many cases they're just groups
of students getting together,"
wrote ASSU Elections Com
missioner Quinn Slack 'll in an
e-mail to The Daily. The Elec
tions Commission does not reg
ulate the endorsing process.

The Stanford Conservative
Society will publish their en
dorsement Wednesday. The
Stanford Democrats are also

expected to endorse candi
dates.

Executive Race
The executive slate of An
gelina Cardona 'll and Kelsei
Wharton 'l2 has received the
most endorsements, earning
nods from SOCC, the Queer
Coalition, the Green Alliance
for Innovative Action (GAIA),
the Women's Coalition, Califor
nia College Democrats and the
editorial boards of The Stan
ford Daily and The Stanford
Progressive.
The Queer Coalition also
endorsed juniors Thorn Scher
and Stephanie Werner, while
the No-Rain Campaign of
Katherine Heflin 'll and
Daniel Leifer 'lO received the
endorsement of Stanford Col
leges Against Cancer.
The Stanford Review Edito
rial Board endorsed graduate
students Ryan Peacock and
Jonathan Bakke.
Undergraduate Senate
SOCC unveiled its list on
Facebook early Friday morn
ing, endorsing 12 Senate candi
dates: sophomores Michael
Cruz, Ben Jensen and Rafael
Vasquez and freshmen Milton
Achelpohl, Pat Bruny, Katie
Cromack, Madeline Flawes,
Deepa Kannappan, Daniel
Khalessi, Robin Perani, Kamil Saied
and Juany Torres.
Cruz, who also received the SOCC
endorsement last year, is the only in
cumbent in the race, while Jensen and
Vasquez are running for Senate for
the second time.
The Queer Coalition is composed
of the Queer-Straight Alliance,
Queer and Asian, Black and Queer at
Stanford, Biversity and La Familia.
Die Emma Goldman Society for
Queer Liberation and the Stanford
Theatre Activist Mobilization Project
endorsed 10 candidates.
Cromack, Cruz, Kannappan, Kha
lessi, Perani,Torres, Vasquez and fresh
men Rebecca Sachs, Dan Thompson
and Noemi Walzebuck are supported
by the Queer Coalition.
Senate Coalitions
Recalling Students for a Better
Stanford from last year's campaign
cycle, several Senate hopefuls have
banded together to form the coali

tions of Stanford United Now (SUN)
and Students with Experience
(S.Ex.). Coalitions, unlike the en
dorsements that come from student
groups, are formed by the candidates
themselves.
The 12 SUN candidates share the
goal of "student government that en
acts pragmatic change on the issues
important to all students," according
to the group's Web site.
SUN is composed of Sachs,
Thompson, junior Nikola Milanovic
and freshmen Jason Lupatkin, Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis, Ed Negiar,
Percia Safar, Rahul Sastry, Will
Seaton, Bennett Siegel, Carolyn Sim
mons and Showly Wang. Milanovic is
a columnist for The Daily and Seaton
is a contributing writer.
SUN members were not immedi
ately available for comment.
Emphasizing their experience on
campus, juniors Philip Bui and Danny
Crichton and sophomores Andrew Jang
and Miles Unterreiner make up the
S.Ex. coalition. Unterreiner is a Daily
writer and Crichton is a columnist.
"One of the things we were really
concerned about was the class diversi
ty," Crichton said. "Freshmen are great,
freshmen are wonderful, but I don't

think fifteen freshmen on a Senate and
a legislative body that represents the
entire student body is really helping."
Last year, 14 of the 15 Senate seats
were won by students who were ei
ther endorsed by SOCC or were in
the Students for a Better Stanford
coalition. Zachary Johnson TO, who
was an incumbent at the time, won the
remaining seat.
Sophomore Class Presidents
So far, only the "So-phresh" soph
omore class president slate of Joel
Aguero, Imani Franklin, Elise Geith
ner and Thomas Hendee has received
any endorsements. The Women's
Coalition and the Queer Coalition
have announced support for "So
phresh," whose members all current
ly serve on Frosh Council.
"Helmet of Shame" Campaign
Senator Palpatine announced a
late bid for the Senate on Thursday in
an e-mail to students. His write-in
campaign last year earned 152 votes,
677 votes shy of last year's cutoff for
Senate seats.
