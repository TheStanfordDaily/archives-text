## Students propose sustainability EC 
### CAITY MONROE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A group of students is argu
ing that a part of Stanford's
graduation requirements
known as "Education for Citi
zenship," which includes classes
in ethics, culture and gender,
lacks an important topic area:
sustainability.
The "Education for Citizen
ship" (EC) component of gen
eral education requirements
(GERs) mandates that under
graduates take classes in two of
four designated areas: ethical
reasoning, global community,
American cultures and gender
studies.
Now, a student-driven initia
tive has emerged to add sustain
ability as another topic area
whose classes would fulfill the
EC requirement.
Noel Crisostomo 'lO is a
member of Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford (SSS) and has
helped develop the initiative.
Crisostomo said the proposal
for a new EC came from his
feeling that, despite efforts to
create informed future citizens,
there was a significant absence
in the Stanford Bulletin and its
current GERs.
"The lack of sustainability
education was pretty appalling,"
he said. "We wanted to fix that,
and thought that... Stanford
graduates wouldn't sufficiently
be prepared without this educa
tion requirement."
While serving as the ASSU
executive chair of sustainability
last year, Elaine Albertson 'll
was one of the students to come

up with the idea.
"One day, the idea occurred
to us that it might be a good
thing to encourage Stanford to
more explicitly incorporate 'sus
tainability,' or at least 'environ
mental education,' into their
curriculum," Albertson wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.
"An educated citizen in
today's world knows about sus
tainability and has grappled
with it on an academic level,
which is why we are proposing
that a new sustainability-fo
cused 'education for citizenship'
GER category be introduced,"
she added.
Students have since been de
veloping a proposal and pre
senting it to faculty for feed
back. Philippe Buc, a history
professor, is the chair of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy (C-USP),
which will vote on the proposal.
He said one consideration the
committee will make is the
availability of sustainability
classes.
"A key issue is whether there
will be enough quality classes to
