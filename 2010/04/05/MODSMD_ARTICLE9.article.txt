## Students propose sustainability EC 
### CAITY MONROE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A group of students is argu
ing that a part of Stanford's
graduation requirements
known as "Education for Citi
zenship," which includes classes
in ethics, culture and gender,
lacks an important topic area:
sustainability.
The "Education for Citizen
ship" (EC) component of gen
eral education requirements
(GERs) mandates that under
graduates take classes in two of
four designated areas: ethical
reasoning, global community,
American cultures and gender
studies.
Now, a student-driven initia
tive has emerged to add sustain
ability as another topic area
whose classes would fulfill the
EC requirement.
Noel Crisostomo 'lO is a
member of Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford (SSS) and has
helped develop the initiative.
Crisostomo said the proposal
for a new EC came from his
feeling that, despite efforts to
create informed future citizens,
there was a significant absence
in the Stanford Bulletin and its
current GERs.
"The lack of sustainability
education was pretty appalling,"
he said. "We wanted to fix that,
and thought that... Stanford
graduates wouldn't sufficiently
be prepared without this educa
tion requirement."
While serving as the ASSU
executive chair of sustainability
last year, Elaine Albertson 'll
was one of the students to come

up with the idea.
"One day, the idea occurred
to us that it might be a good
thing to encourage Stanford to
more explicitly incorporate 'sus
tainability,' or at least 'environ
mental education,' into their
curriculum," Albertson wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.
"An educated citizen in
today's world knows about sus
tainability and has grappled
with it on an academic level,
which is why we are proposing
that a new sustainability-fo
cused 'education for citizenship'
GER category be introduced,"
she added.
Students have since been de
veloping a proposal and pre
senting it to faculty for feed
back. Philippe Buc, a history
professor, is the chair of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy (C-USP),
which will vote on the proposal.
He said one consideration the
committee will make is the
availability of sustainability
classes.
"A key issue is whether there
will be enough quality classes to

provide to interested students," Buc
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. Buc
said any prediction on his part about
the fate of the proposal would be
premature, but did seem receptive
to the students' idea.

"I am personally favorable, as
long as the environment is viewed
both in the light of service to nature
but also preserving the world for fu
ture human beings," he said.
Students involved with the pro
posal have identified some currently
offered courses, including ones in
anthropology, civil engineering,
human biology and English, that
would meet their criteria for a sus
tainability requirement.

"We tried to come up with a
clear, holistic idea about what sus
tainability is so we could figure out
what these classes were going to
look like," said Eli Pollak 'l2, anoth
er SSS member spearheading the
project.
Crisostomo agreed with the im
portance of a broad conceptualiza
tion of sustainability. "We believe
sustainability is more than environ
mental sustainability ... it's a bal
ance between environmental, social
and economic considerations."
The addition of a sustainability
EC would only provide an addition
al option for the requirement. Cur
rently, students must choose at least
two of four EC areas in which to
take a course. If the proposal is im
plemented, students would choose
among five areas.
Both UC-Santa Barbara and
UC-Berkeley have begun efforts to

include sustainability in their educa
tional program, but nothing has
been officially implemented.
"I think that having this educa
tion requirement here at Stanford
speaks to the idea of thinking about
how we interact with our resource
base as part of our education as a
global citizen," saidTheo Gibbs 'll,
the co-president of SSS. Gibbs is
currently working with Pollak and
Crisostomo on the proposal.
Albertson agreed.
"Sustainability is a concept that
falls directly under the umbrella of
Stanford's intent to value the future,
yet is not explicitly addressed in our
school's curriculum its educa
tional core," she said.
The committee is set to vote on
the proposal on April 9.
