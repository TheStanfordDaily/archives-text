## Moneyhun's Got the Write Stuff 
### JENNY THAI 
With his polished, trimmed
beard and flowing gray-white
hair, Clyde Moneyhun looks
the part of the modern, laid
back academic. Turns out he's
a very well-traveled academic.
"Clyde's absolutely amazing and a bit of a
badass," said former Branner resident
Gabrielle Gulo 'l2. "Check out his earring!"
Clyde Moneyhun, the Branner Resident
Fellow (RF), director of the Hume Writing
Center (HWC), Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) lecturer, family man and all
around "badass" has had a long career of writ
ing and teaching that has taken him around the
world, from the Deep South, to Japan, to the
Farm.

Growing up in a family that never settled in
one place for too long, Moneyhun crisscrossed
the United States as a child. He was born in
Florida and spent a considerable part of his
childhood in the Deep South until college,
when he headed to New York to get his under
graduate degree in comparative literature at
Columbia.

"New York City was the ultimate culture
shock, but I loved it," Moneyhun wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "I knew absolutely nobody
there, but I was turned on by the electricity of
the city, the challenge of the classes, and the
tight group of smart friends I made. I still love

going to New York every chance I get."
After college, Moneyhun opted for another
change of scene and headed to Japan for four
years, where he taught English as a break be
tween earning his MFA in fiction writing from
the University of Arizona and his Ph.D. in
rhetoric and composition from the same insti
tution.
"I was going to be between degree pro
grams and thought Ed go have fun for a year or
two," Moneyhun said. "But I loved it so much
that I stayed for four years. I taught at a de
lightful women's two-year college in the big
city of Nagoya, traveled all over the place,
made many friends. It was a blast."
Moneyhun's love of the English language
was heightened through his stay in Japan and
he decided to continue helping people im
prove their writing when he returned to the
states. He now helps students hone their writ
ing technique through his work as director of
the Hume Writing Center at Stanford.
"I direct all aspects of the center's opera
tions," Moneyhun said. "The activity we're
most famous for, of course, is tutoring. We did
over 7,000 tutoring sessions last year."
The HWC also organizes other writing
events.
"We also do small class workshops, special
evening and weekend events like readings
and celebrations of writing outreach to
public schools in the area and more," Money
hun continued. "The fun never stops around
here!"

Moneyhun's passion for writing is a major
part of his job description, which includes
training HWC peer tutors. Aaron Kalb 'll, one
of over a dozen Resident Writing Tutors
(RWTs), described Moneyhun's passionate
teaching style.
"Clyde was incredibly enthusiastic, upbeat,
and supportive," Kalb said. "Clyde repeatedly
shared his mantra: 'our goal is to make better
writers, not better writing,' so we weren't
taught how to mark up particular papers to re
duce grammar mistakes. We were taught to in
teract with students to empower them."
On top of his administrative work, Money
hun also enjoys teaching, though he admits
that the director position does not leave much
time to spend in a classroom.
"I teach the tutoring training class every
spring and a very occasional PWR or Intro
duction to the Humanities (IHUM) section,
and I do one-on-one tutoring, too, but I'm
looking forward to more teaching in the fu
ture," Moneyhun said.
Moneyhun also has his hands full with his
family, raising his two sons, Jesse and Gabriel,
with his wife, Nancy Buffington, a fellow PWR
lecturer.
"Our world pretty much rotates around
them," Moneyhun said. "Nancy and I are also
juggling these two jobs with a family life, rais
ing two boys, helping with homework, attend
ing school events, taking weekend drives and
hikes, etc."
"How do we do it?" he continued. "With a

lot less sleep than I'd prefer, for starters! It's
definitely a strain."
One of Moneyhun's greatest strengths
as a father as well as a mentor is his warm
and compassionate personality. RWT Cara
Brook 'lO recalled a stressful time during her
freshman year in Branner when Moneyhun
and Buffington took her under their wing and
provided personal guidance.
"Nancy and Clyde invited me to their
apartment for the evening and we watched
'The Full Monty' together," Brook said, re
membering a night when she needed to be
cheered up.
It was this personal touch and close friend
ship with the couple that ultimately inspired
Brook to become a writing tutor.
"I am a science major, but they always sup
ported me in my writing endeavors and want
ed me to make my voice heard," Brook said. "I
will always value how they made a home for
me as a frightened and fragile freshman."
Brook was not the only life that Moneyhun
touched with his gentle manner. Colleagues,
too, pointed to his accommodating nature and
range of interests as some of Moneyhun's best
assets.
"I have always been impressed with Clyde's
amazing breadth of knowledge about tutoring,
writing and teaching, and his clear and com
prehensible but powerful manner of commu
nicating it," said Donna Hunter, a PWR lectur
er who tutors in the HWC.
But Moneyhun's days of wanderlust are
still not behind him, and his love of writing is
again drawing him away from his current
home. This will be Moneyhun's last year at
Stanford as HWC director and Branner RF
before he relocates to Boise State University.
"I'll still direct a writing center, but I'll also
teach in the English department, especially in
their Ph.D. program in rhetoric and composi
tion," Moneyhun said. "It'll be a very different
life."
Moneyhun said Stanford has yet to find a
replacement for him but expressed his confi
dence that the University "has a deep bench of
very qualified people" for both jobs.
Still, many Branner residents are skeptical
of finding a suitable replacement for Money
hun.
"He's easy to talk to, really chill, and he
doesn't make you feel guilty when you go to
him for advice on your mistakes," Gulo said.
"With him and his family leaving, the next
Branner RF definitely has some big shoes to
fill."

"I have always been impressed with Clyde's
amazing breadth of knowledge about tutoring,
writing and teaching, and his clear and com
prehensible but powerful manner of commu
nicating it," said Donna Hunter, a PWR lectur
er who tutors in the HWC.
But Moneyhun's days of wanderlust are
still not behind him, and his love of writing is
again drawing him away from his current
home. This will be Moneyhun's last year at
Stanford as HWC director and Branner RF
before he relocates to Boise State University.
"I'll still direct a writing center, but I'll also
teach in the English department, especially in
their Ph.D. program in rhetoric and composi
tion," Moneyhun said. "It'll be a very different
life."
Moneyhun said Stanford has yet to find a
replacement for him but expressed his confi
dence that the University "has a deep bench of
very qualified people" for both jobs.
Still, many Branner residents are skeptical
of finding a suitable replacement for Money
hun.
"He's easy to talk to, really chill, and he
doesn't make you feel guilty when you go to
him for advice on your mistakes," Gulo said.
"With him and his family leaving, the next
Branner RF definitely has some big shoes to
fill."

With his polished, trimmed
beard and flowing gray-white
hair, Clyde Moneyhun looks
the part of the modern, laid
back academic. Turns out he's
a very well-traveled academic.
"Clyde's absolutely amazing and a bit of a
badass," said former Branner resident
Gabrielle Gulo 'l2. "Check out his earring!"
Clyde Moneyhun, the Branner Resident
Fellow (RF), director of the Hume Writing
Center (HWC), Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) lecturer, family man and all
around "badass" has had a long career of writ
ing and teaching that has taken him around the
world, from the Deep South, to Japan, to the
Farm.

Growing up in a family that never settled in
one place for too long, Moneyhun crisscrossed
the United States as a child. He was born in
Florida and spent a considerable part of his
childhood in the Deep South until college,
when he headed to New York to get his under
graduate degree in comparative literature at
Columbia.

"New York City was the ultimate culture
shock, but I loved it," Moneyhun wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "I knew absolutely nobody
there, but I was turned on by the electricity of
the city, the challenge of the classes, and the
tight group of smart friends I made. I still love

going to New York every chance I get."
After college, Moneyhun opted for another
change of scene and headed to Japan for four
years, where he taught English as a break be
tween earning his MFA in fiction writing from
the University of Arizona and his Ph.D. in
rhetoric and composition from the same insti
tution.
"I was going to be between degree pro
grams and thought Ed go have fun for a year or
two," Moneyhun said. "But I loved it so much
that I stayed for four years. I taught at a de
lightful women's two-year college in the big
city of Nagoya, traveled all over the place,
made many friends. It was a blast."
Moneyhun's love of the English language
was heightened through his stay in Japan and
he decided to continue helping people im
prove their writing when he returned to the
states. He now helps students hone their writ
ing technique through his work as director of
the Hume Writing Center at Stanford.
"I direct all aspects of the center's opera
tions," Moneyhun said. "The activity we're
most famous for, of course, is tutoring. We did
over 7,000 tutoring sessions last year."
The HWC also organizes other writing
events.
"We also do small class workshops, special
evening and weekend events like readings
and celebrations of writing outreach to
public schools in the area and more," Money
hun continued. "The fun never stops around
here!"

Moneyhun's passion for writing is a major
part of his job description, which includes
training HWC peer tutors. Aaron Kalb 'll, one
of over a dozen Resident Writing Tutors
(RWTs), described Moneyhun's passionate
teaching style.
"Clyde was incredibly enthusiastic, upbeat,
and supportive," Kalb said. "Clyde repeatedly
shared his mantra: 'our goal is to make better
writers, not better writing,' so we weren't
taught how to mark up particular papers to re
duce grammar mistakes. We were taught to in
teract with students to empower them."
On top of his administrative work, Money
hun also enjoys teaching, though he admits
that the director position does not leave much
time to spend in a classroom.
"I teach the tutoring training class every
spring and a very occasional PWR or Intro
duction to the Humanities (IHUM) section,
and I do one-on-one tutoring, too, but I'm
looking forward to more teaching in the fu
ture," Moneyhun said.
Moneyhun also has his hands full with his
family, raising his two sons, Jesse and Gabriel,
with his wife, Nancy Buffington, a fellow PWR
lecturer.
"Our world pretty much rotates around
them," Moneyhun said. "Nancy and I are also
juggling these two jobs with a family life, rais
ing two boys, helping with homework, attend
ing school events, taking weekend drives and
hikes, etc."
"How do we do it?" he continued. "With a

lot less sleep than I'd prefer, for starters! It's
definitely a strain."
One of Moneyhun's greatest strengths
as a father as well as a mentor is his warm
and compassionate personality. RWT Cara
Brook 'lO recalled a stressful time during her
freshman year in Branner when Moneyhun
and Buffington took her under their wing and
provided personal guidance.
"Nancy and Clyde invited me to their
apartment for the evening and we watched
'The Full Monty' together," Brook said, re
membering a night when she needed to be
cheered up.
It was this personal touch and close friend
ship with the couple that ultimately inspired
Brook to become a writing tutor.
"I am a science major, but they always sup
ported me in my writing endeavors and want
ed me to make my voice heard," Brook said. "I
will always value how they made a home for
me as a frightened and fragile freshman."
Brook was not the only life that Moneyhun
touched with his gentle manner. Colleagues,
too, pointed to his accommodating nature and
range of interests as some of Moneyhun's best
assets.
"I have always been impressed with Clyde's
amazing breadth of knowledge about tutoring,
writing and teaching, and his clear and com
prehensible but powerful manner of commu
nicating it," said Donna Hunter, a PWR lectur
er who tutors in the HWC.
But Moneyhun's days of wanderlust are
still not behind him, and his love of writing is

tion," Moneyhun said. "It'll be a very different
life."

dence that the University "has a deep bench of
very qualified people" for both jobs.
