# Stanford seeks new CIO
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” An Le Nguyen 
Stanford University is searching
for a chief investment officer (CIO)
to help manage its endowment, but
candidates for the position have not
yet been disclosed.
The post has been vacant since
February 2008, when former chief
investment officer Eric Upin
stepped down to pursue a career
with Sequoia Capital, a venture cap
ital firm.
Stanford recently announced it
has been searching for a replace
ment CIO since last October. The
University has enlisted the help of
David Barrett Partners LLC, a New
York company specializing in senior
level recruiting.
The development comes after a
rocky financial year for Stanford?s
endowment. A study by the National
Association of College and Univer
sity Business Officers (NACUBO)
and the Commonfund revealed that
the endowment dropped by 27 per
cent from FY2OOB to FY2009. The
reported value of the endowment
was $12.6 billion as of August 2009.
The endowment is expected to be
in improved shape relative to the last
fiscal year. Official statistics for
FY2OIO have not been released.

John Powers, the chief executive
officer of Stanford Management
Company, said he wants a colleague
who could assist him with the Univer
sity?s portfolio. Once appointed, the
new CIO would be working with the
third-largest U.S. college endowment.
