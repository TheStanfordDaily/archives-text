## GUEST COLUMN The 						Right Got It Wrong: "The Healthcare 'Rage'" 
### JIMMY BIERMAN Stanford Law School '12 
Erica Morgan gets it backward in "Get It
Right: The Health Care 'Rage'" when
she argues that in theorizing that race
relations play a role in the vitriolic resistance to
the Obama agenda, liberals are simply repeat
ing a stock response instead of making "sub
stantive counter-arguments." Liberals suggest
that the opposition might have something to
do with race because the "substantive" argu
ments raised by leaders on the Right have,
well, plainly lacked substance. Morgan's analy
sis is a perfect example.
Morgan characterizes the passage of
Health Care Reform as "usurpation and tyran
ny" citing a poll showing that 54 percent of
Americans opposed the bill before the
House's final vote. It's true that polls have con
sistently shown a divided country on the issue
of health care reform. But it is hardly tyranni
cal for the party that made major electoral
gains in the past election to recognize division
and still opt for its own agenda an agenda
made crystal clear during the campaign. That is
how Democratic Republics work. As Republi
can Representative Paul Ryan explained, if the
Democrats want to use their majority in both
houses of Congress to pass a bill "it's their
right.They did win the election." Furthermore,
polls have revealed that a statistically signifi
cant portion of opposition has come from the
Left, who wish for socialized medicine, some
thing this reform does NOT include. Are the
Democrats thus "tyrants" for brokering a com
promise that both extremes of the political
spectrum are uncomfortable about?
This is another reason why Republican cri
tiques fall flat: Health Care Reform is not so
cialized medicine. Rather, the plan is a moder
ate compromise similar to many past Republi
can proposals. The Act preserves and indeed
strengthens private insurance. Low-income
uninsured Americans receive subsidies to buy
private insurance, and the mandate that Re
publicans so abhor will result in the purchase
of private insurance. Moreover, the bill makes
deep cuts in Medicare, the "socialist" part of
the American "health care system." Republi
cans decry these cuts. Newt Gingrich, who
once shut down the Federal Government in an
effort to bully President Clinton into disman
tling Medicare, now criticizes this bill for weak
ening the entitlement program he once
loathed.
Arguments about the individual mandate
have been similarly confused. The proposal
was originally a conservative one, largely initi
ated by the Heritage Foundation, grounded in
the notion of personal responsibility. Because
those who get sick will ultimately receive care,
mandating health insurance, in Mitt Romney's
words, ensures "no more free-riders." Those
who wish to ride free will pay a tax for reckless
behavior. This is an underpinning of the health
care bill that Romney passed when he was gov

ernor of Massachusetts.
In another reverse course, conservatives
now argue that the mandate is unconstitution
al. But these claims are likely to fail. Congress
may regulate activities that have a substantial
effect on interstate commerce.This is true even
when the activities are inherently local and
personal, a principle explained as recently as
2005, when the Supreme Court upheld federal
laws prohibiting home grown marijuana. Con
servative stalwart Justice Antonin Scalia con
curred in that decision. Health care costs have
become a major drag on the competitiveness
of our economy. The free rider problem
which partly explains our skyrocketing health
care premiums has a substantial effect on
interstate commerce.
The Constitutional challenge has also been
grounded in the notion of states' rights. Vir
ginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli is
bringing a claim on the grounds of nullifica
tion, a doctrine long deemed unconstitutional
and which John C. Calhoun advocated in order
to maintain slavery. Mitt Romney has defend
ed his mandate because it was a state preroga
tive rather than a Federal one. Of course these
Federalist arguments are muddled considering
that the leading Republican reform initiative
would be for the Federal government to im
pose tort liability caps in state courts.
Morgan lists a "plethora of objections to the
bill." Liberals acknowledge such objections,
but when they are rife with inconsistencies, we
have to ask if something more is going on.
Notwithstanding Michael Steele, Con
doleezza Rice and Clarence Thomas, it is
undisputable that African Americans over
whelmingly support a party whose agenda ex
plicitly seeks to promote equality. In contrast,
for the last 40-plus years, the political strategy
of the Republican Party has included attempts
to co-opt racist elements of the populace.
Richard Nixon, who believed blacks to be "ge
netically inferior," engineered a "Southern
Strategy" to court angry Whites. Ronald Rea
gan began his "states' rights" presidential cam
paign in Philadelphia, Mississippi, a town with
a history of white supremacy. George H.W.
Bush promised to keep the Willie Hortons in
jail. Republican Senator Trent Lott explained
that in his opinion we could have avoided "all
these problems" by electing segregationist
Strom Thurmond president in 1948.
And now, anti-reform protestors spit on
John Lewis, as segregationists once did, and de
lude themselves into believing that nullifica
tion is constitutional but regulation and taxes
are not. It seems legitimate to ask how all this
rage has been generated by a moderate health
care bill modeled on a plan enacted by a Re
publican governor.
