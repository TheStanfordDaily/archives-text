Not everyone at Stanford follows ASSU
politics religiously. Hence it is no sur
prise that many students are over
whelmed and skeptical of the numerous en
dorsing groups that appear every spring and
then just as quickly fade from consciousness.
What distinguishes SOCC from the collection
of confusing acronyms mixed into every elec
tion cycle?
SOCC stands for the Students of Color
Coalition. We are an endorsing group that be
lieves a diverse student body provides for
heightened personal development as well as
social support and increased avenues for con
necting with peers. SOCC fights for systemat
ic changes that allow student groups to imple
ment the programming and support that they
uniquely provide in order to continually
strengthen our already vibrant communities.
SOCC is comprised of student organiza
tions that support students academically, pro
fessionally, and personally in order to empow
er them to grow as leaders, intellectuals, and
responsible global citizens. As co-chairs of the
Asian American Students' Association
(AASA), Black Student Union (BSU),
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA), Muslim Student Awareness Net
work (MSAN), and Stanford American Indi
an Organization (SAIO), SOCC directly rep
resent the interests of over 1400 diverse indi
viduals across campus. As a coalition original
ly founded in 1987 to protect and promote the
values of students of color on campus during a
time when cultural and ethnic diversity
seemed a low priority, we have since naturally
expanded our mission to advocate for campus
diversity of every nature diversity of
thought, socioeconomic backgrounds, sexual
orientation, political positionality, geographic
origins and religious beliefs. SOCC represents
the continuation of a long tradition of student
leaders and their communities working tire
lessly to uphold the values upon which this
university was founded.
Students involved in SOCC and its umbrel
la groups are dedicated to using the skills and
knowledge they acquire at Stanford to serve
and uplift the Stanford community. SOCC
strives to empower students in all we do be
cause we believe that inspired leaders become
the best public servants. As such, SOCC recog

nizes the potential of the ASSU and its elect
ed student leaders as forces for positive social
change. We believe that the ASSU is an impor
tant forum for students, administrators and
students to collaborate in promoting diversity
and tolerance on campus, thus creating stu
dents who will advocate for similar issues as
they emerge as global leaders.
This election season SOCC is supporting
12 senate candidates and one executive slate.
Each went through an open and transparent
endorsement process, and was heavily vetted
by representatives from each of the five com
munities that SOCC represents. We have se
lected students who reflect the diverse inter
ests and backgrounds of the student body as
well as demonstrate great commitment,
knowledge and passion for serving our diverse
Stanford community.
Every year, SOCC chooses to engage
deeply with the ASSU election process be
cause we believe it is an important step to
wards empowering students and ensuring that
the uniquely diverse nature of our student
body is maintained and protected. Therefore,
we humbly ask that as you look toward the up
coming April Bth and 9th elections you recall
SOCC's commitments to service, leadership
and student advocacy. A vote for SOCC is a
vote for you.
