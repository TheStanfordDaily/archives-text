# THE
						GAO REPORT
## It's Elections Season 
### Shelley Gao 
Blieve it or not, but voting in the ASSU
elections this year actually matters,
much more so than in previous years.
As in American politics, some elections are
"status quo" elections representing con
tinuation of the current order and some
are "change" elections a chance for a dra
matic shift away from the way things have
been done. This year is very much about
"change." For the first time in years, there is
a complete, new generation of candidates
and the possibility of real, systematic reform.
All the candidates running are passionate
and competent individuals who will serve
the student body well. There are, however,
some important characteristics that distin
guish among the large number of candidates
running. (Disclaimer: I have been advising a
number of Senate candidates).
First, evaluate the quality of their plat
forms. Senate candidates and I was cer
tainly guilty of this as well have a tenden
cy to publicize broad objectives like "en
hancing student engagement," "strengthen
ing diversity," "improving accountability"
and "promoting free speech." Platitudes are
nice, but meaningless without specific imple
mentation strategies. The best-prepared
Senate candidates will have detailed plat
forms in addition to catchy slogans. Look for
specific and tangible measures from the can
didates. Ask them how exactly they intend to
improve accountability and transparency in
the ASSU.

Second, endorsements really do matter.
The process for most endorsing groups is
quite rigorous and serious. Most involve the
submission of a questionnaire concerning
issue stances and an interview with the stu
dent group's leadership. Although endorse
ments can be based more on ideological
alignment with the group's philosophical un
derpinnings or mission statement, they serve
as a filtering mechanism and a good way for
outsiders to gauge the effectiveness of candi
dates in office. The students who pile up en
dorsements are generally the ones who are
most knowledgeable about the pertinent is-

sues and institutional conditions.
Third, there are those who will win
through "sheer force of will." They will be
the ones flyering at 2 a.m., packing in dorm
visits and rotating around dining halls. They
will be the ones with the most aggressive
marketing campaigns, personal emails and
extensive GOTV outreach. These individu
als also tend to be successful legislators be
cause the Senate is a body that allows for

tremendous freedom and independence.
The senator's role is only vaguely defined
and successful senators have created their
own job description. Due to the high
turnover rate, and the fact that few senators
serve more than one term, there is little
electoral accountability for the senators.
Those who generate legislative progress and
propel reform tend to be go-getters, eager to
make the most of their time in office.

Granted, campaigning is very different
from governing. Once candidates get elect
ed, there is a significant learning curve. It
takes time to develop the skill to navigate
the system, work with university adminis
trators and most of all, build consensus with
fourteen other colleagues with different
agendas and leadership styles.
This is the year of change election. Stan
ford student government politics is tradi
tionally dominated by a "cult of personali
ties." In the past, bold characters have tend
ed to win Senate elections very much influ
enced by name recognition. This time, there
is only one incumbent and the field is domi
nated by freshmen. The departure of politi
cally influential members of the Class of
2009 at the beginning of this year, and now,
the near-total retirement of this year's Sen
ate (including myself) have paved the way
for a new era in campus politics.
Even the elections process this year has
undergone significant reform. We no longer
have a Fair Campaign system that placed re
strictions on the number of fliers allowed
and the time period permitted for campaign
ing activities. Less government regulation is
meant to transfer power to the voters.
So take advantage of the promise and po
tential of this year's elections. Spend some
time getting to know the candidates and
making an informed choice and remember
to vote this Thursday and Friday.
