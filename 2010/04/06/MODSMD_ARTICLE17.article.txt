## What's wrong with the Senate? 
### BEN CASEMENT STOLL '10 
It's ASSU elections season and campus is
once again blanketed with the cheesy slo
gans and campaign promises of those
seeking what passes for public office among
undergraduates. It's only a matter of time
until one of them hires a blimp, Goodyear
style, to hover over campus.
For a University that prides itself on di
versity, you would expect candidates of every
stripe with different agendas to focus on dif
ferent issues. You'd be wrong. Instead, most
candidates sound the same, act the same and
make the same promises. This is because
ASSU elections are less about substance
than winning a campus-wide popularity con
test.
It would be easier to have an actual cam
paign if Stanford had more problems. Per
haps you think I'm being insensitive; your
community center had its budget cut by 10%
last year, and you're very upset! Yes, but you
still don't have much to complain about.
Instead, Senate candidates like to focus
on a time-honored list of initiatives that
most people can support without thinking
too hard.
Take, for example, the question of faculty
and graduate student diversity. It appears on
nearly every candidate's platform, just as it
did last year. Flas anything been done about
it? Of course not. It's just one of those things
you say when you run for Senate.
Two points need to be made about the
Senate's oft-proclaimed commitment to di
versity. First, no one can say no, because at
Stanford diversity is the Holy Grail.
Second, when it comes to hiring and ad
missions there is precious little that the
ASSU can do. The University is already an
equal opportunity employer. The repetitious
commitments to diversity sometimes ob

scure the fact that Stanford's undergraduate
body is already ethnically diverse. The diver
sity we lack is not in skin color, but in politics
and ideas.
Consider the nebulous promises, so often
made, to increase student involvement in the
ASSU. Think about this one for a minute: do

you actually want to spend more of your day
dealing with the ASSU? I couldn't think of a
bigger waste of time. What we really need is a
Senate that gets things done quietly and effi
ciently without anyone noticing.
