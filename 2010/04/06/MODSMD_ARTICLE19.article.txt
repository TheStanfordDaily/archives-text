## MEN'S VOLLEYBALL Stanford splits in SoCal 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford men's volleyball team saw its eight
match winning streak come to an end on Friday, but
bounced back on Saturday to remain at the top of the con
ference and national standings.
On Friday, the Cardinal (16-5,13-5 MPSF) hoped to
avenge an early season loss to No. 5 Cal State Northridge
(18-7,13-6). However, in a series of four close sets (30-26,
21-30, 31-29, 30-27), the Matadors prevailed yet again
over the Card.
To open the first set, the two teams went back and
forth, trading points until the Matadors took a 5-4 lead
and never looked back. A Northridge hitting error and a
service ace from sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson

block by sophomore middle blocker Gus Ellis and Law
son, followed by two Lawson kills, gave the Cardinal an
early 4-1 lead, and Northridge was never able to catch up.
The Cardinal led by as many as nine points during the set,
and senior opposite Evan Romero served two aces to fin

Sets three and four each came down to the final points,
with both eventually ending in the Matadors' favor.
Northridge jumped out to an early 9-4 lead in the third
set, but the Cardinal came back to tie the score at 15-15.
The two teams exchanged points and possession of the
lead up to 29-29 when the Matadors took over and won
the set, 31-29. The fourth set proceeded in a similar fash
ionâ€” the score was tied 15 times with Northridge
winning the set and match, 30-27.
Against the Card, the Northridge offense was unstop
pable, led by senior opposite Theo Edwards with 17 kills.
