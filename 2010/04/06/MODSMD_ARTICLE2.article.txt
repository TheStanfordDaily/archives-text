## Students gain from SAFRA Dept. of Education set to provide all federal loans 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Student loan reform, an often
overlooked but important piece of
legislation, was signed into law along
with the health care reconciliation bill
last month.
The Student Aid and Fiscal Re
sponsibility Act (SAFRA),passed as a
rider to the Health Care and Educa
tion Reconciliation Act of 2010, will
end the current system of private
loans in which the federal government
subsidizes banks and other private
lenders through the Federal Family
Education Loan Program (FFELP).
Under that system, if students default
on their loans, the government will still
pay the banks.
Starting in July, though, all federal
loans will come directly from the U.S.
Department of Education. The
Obama administration estimates that
eliminating the middleman could save
up to $6l billion over the next 10 years.
According to Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper, Stanford has tra
ditionally been a FFELP school, as
Stanford students typically have a
very low default rate and thus were
able to get good deals within the
FFELP program.
However, in the last two years, due
to the poor economy, many lenders
started cutting back on benefits, and
some high-volume lenders, including
Bank of America, stopped their loan
program altogether.
Cooper explained that Stanford
was ready to transition to direct lend
ing regardless of whether or not the
bill passed. Overall, she said, the loan
process will be "simpler, easier to un
derstand, and there will only be one
place to go when you're in repay
ment."
On the other hand, Cooper ex
pressed concern about the Depart
ment of Education's ability to handle
the amount of loans they will have to
process.
"The Department of Education is
not a bank and not in the business of
doing loans," Cooper said. "I'm a little
worried that they will not provide the
level of customer service that our stu
dents deserve."
The transition to direct lending
may also lead to job losses in the pri
vate loan industries. As reported by
news media sources. Senator Lamar
Alexander (R., Tenn.) claimed that
the bill will lead to the loss of 31,000
jobs. In response, the Obama adminis
tration said that it will preserve jobs by
hiring many of the same private
lenders to service the direct loans.
Pell Grants
One of the most widely hailed as
pects of the bill is the $36 billion grant
ed to the federal Pell Grant program,
which provides need-based grants to
low-income undergraduates. It is esti
mated that the additional funding will
cover an additional 880,000 grants by
2020, and also raise the maximum
award from $5550 to about $5900 by
2019.
While increased Pell Grant fund
ing will create more opportunities for

low-income students, the amount
awarded by the grant is small com
pared to rising tuition costs for public
and private universities. Indeed, even
a $5900 grant would only make a small
dent in the Stanford annual tuition,
which is projected to be $50,576 next
year.

However, Cooper said that
changes to Stanford's financial aid
policy over the last five years means
that the University is still affordable.
"To give you some perspective,
Stanford gets $5 million from Federal
grant programs, including the Pell
Grant, but this year we're spending
over $llO million in institutional
money to pay for financial aid," Coop
er said.

Nonetheless, Cooper approves of
increased funding to the Pell Grant,
for which 12 to 14 percent of Stanford
undergraduates are eligible.
"Any increase in federal funding is
a good thing," she said. "We'll take
what we can get."
On the other hand, Professor Eric
Bettinger of the School of Education
sees the increased Pell Grant funding
as unlikely to make a very large differ
ence.

"According to research, every
$lOOO of aid given to students gives a
three-percent increase in their chance
of sticking around," Bettinger said.
"So if our goal is to get more students
to stay in college, a $5OO increase
would only increase the likelihood by
1.5 percent."
Bettinger hopes that increasing

Pell grants will encourage some low
income students to go to college who
otherwise might not consider it. How
ever, he said that the complicated ap
plication process FAFSA forms
consist of eight pages and 120 ques
tions intimidate many low-income
families and remains the greatest bar
rier to students receiving the grants
they need.

Repayment
Besides eliminating federally sub

sidized private loans, the bill will also
change aspects of loan repayment,
such as reducing some interest rates.
For parents, the annual interest rate
will drop from 8.5 percent to 7.9 per
cent. For students, rates will remain
the same: 4.5 percent for students with
financial aid and 6.8 percent for every
one else.

In addition, starting in 2014, the
caps on student debt payments will be
lowered from 15 percent to 10 per
cent of borrowers' discretionary in

come. If payments are kept up, the
government will also forgive any re
maining debt after 20 years, down
from 25 years under the old program.
For those who go into public service,
such as teaching and military person
nel, debt will be forgiven after 10
years.
Tradition
Stanford's Financial Aid Office
has been preparing for the transition
to direct lending for over a year, and

Cooper feels confident that Stanford
has the technical capabilities to deal
with the change.
The Financial Aid Office will start
offering direct loans summer quarter.
Cooper cautioned students who need
loans this spring to take care of the
paperwork immediately, as private
lenders will start cutting off services
before July.

Starting in July, though, all federal
loans will come directly from the U.S.
Department of Education. The
Obama administration estimates that
eliminating the middleman could save
up to $6l billion over the next 10 years.
According to Director of Financial
Aid Karen Cooper, Stanford has tra
ditionally been a FFELP school, as
Stanford students typically have a
very low default rate and thus were
able to get good deals within the
FFELP program.
However, in the last two years, due
to the poor economy, many lenders
started cutting back on benefits, and
some high-volume lenders, including
Bank of America, stopped their loan
program altogether.
Cooper explained that Stanford
was ready to transition to direct lend
ing regardless of whether or not the
bill passed. Overall, she said, the loan
process will be "simpler, easier to un
derstand, and there will only be one
place to go when you're in repay
ment."
On the other hand, Cooper ex
pressed concern about the Depart
ment of Education's ability to handle
the amount of loans they will have to
process.
"The Department of Education is
not a bank and not in the business of
doing loans," Cooper said. "I'm a little
worried that they will not provide the
level of customer service that our stu
dents deserve."
The transition to direct lending
may also lead to job losses in the pri
vate loan industries. As reported by
news media sources. Senator Lamar
Alexander (R., Tenn.) claimed that
the bill will lead to the loss of 31,000
jobs. In response, the Obama adminis
tration said that it will preserve jobs by
hiring many of the same private
lenders to service the direct loans.
Pell Grants
One of the most widely hailed as
pects of the bill is the $36 billion grant
ed to the federal Pell Grant program,
which provides need-based grants to
low-income undergraduates. It is esti
mated that the additional funding will
cover an additional 880,000 grants by
2020, and also raise the maximum
award from $5550 to about $5900 by
2019.
While increased Pell Grant fund
ing will create more opportunities for

low-income students, the amount
awarded by the grant is small com
pared to rising tuition costs for public
and private universities. Indeed, even
a $5900 grant would only make a small
dent in the Stanford annual tuition,
which is projected to be $50,576 next
year.

However, Cooper said that
changes to Stanford's financial aid
policy over the last five years means
that the University is still affordable.
"To give you some perspective,
Stanford gets $5 million from Federal
grant programs, including the Pell
Grant, but this year we're spending
over $llO million in institutional
money to pay for financial aid," Coop
er said.

Nonetheless, Cooper approves of
increased funding to the Pell Grant,
for which 12 to 14 percent of Stanford
undergraduates are eligible.
"Any increase in federal funding is
a good thing," she said. "We'll take
what we can get."
On the other hand, Professor Eric
Bettinger of the School of Education
sees the increased Pell Grant funding
as unlikely to make a very large differ
ence.

"According to research, every
$lOOO of aid given to students gives a
three-percent increase in their chance
of sticking around," Bettinger said.
"So if our goal is to get more students
to stay in college, a $5OO increase
would only increase the likelihood by
1.5 percent."
Bettinger hopes that increasing

Pell grants will encourage some low
income students to go to college who
otherwise might not consider it. How
ever, he said that the complicated ap
plication process FAFSA forms
consist of eight pages and 120 ques
tions intimidate many low-income
families and remains the greatest bar
rier to students receiving the grants
they need.

Repayment
Besides eliminating federally sub

sidized private loans, the bill will also
change aspects of loan repayment,
such as reducing some interest rates.
For parents, the annual interest rate
will drop from 8.5 percent to 7.9 per
cent. For students, rates will remain
the same: 4.5 percent for students with
financial aid and 6.8 percent for every
one else.

In addition, starting in 2014, the
caps on student debt payments will be
lowered from 15 percent to 10 per
cent of borrowers' discretionary in

come. If payments are kept up, the
government will also forgive any re
maining debt after 20 years, down
from 25 years under the old program.
For those who go into public service,
such as teaching and military person
nel, debt will be forgiven after 10
years.
Tradition
Stanford's Financial Aid Office
has been preparing for the transition
to direct lending for over a year, and

Cooper feels confident that Stanford
has the technical capabilities to deal
with the change.
The Financial Aid Office will start
offering direct loans summer quarter.
Cooper cautioned students who need
loans this spring to take care of the
paperwork immediately, as private
lenders will start cutting off services
before July.

Stanford undergraduates are expected to benefit from the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which will end the
current system of private loans to college students. Passed as a rider to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
Act of 2010, the new legislation will make the U.S. Department of Education the direct provider of federal loans.
