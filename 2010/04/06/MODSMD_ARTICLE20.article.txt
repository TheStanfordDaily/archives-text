# CAL BEATS CARD
## Cardinal pitchers hold Bears to two runs, offense struggles to score runs 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After a tough weekend series at
UCLA, Stanford's baseball team re
turned to the Bay Area on Monday to
take on California in Berkeley. Though
Stanford's pitching and defense contin
ued to perform well, its offense failed to
meet the challenge presented by the
Golden Bears, as the Cardinal fell 2-0.
The matchup was the first this season
between No. 22 Stanford (13-10, 3-3
Pac-10) and No. 30 Cal (17-10, 3-3).
Though the schools are Pac-10 Confer
ence rivals, this game did not count to
ward either team's conference record.
They will meet again for a three-game
conference series on April 23-25, which
will be at Sunken Diamond.

In Monday's game, Stanford started
freshman pitcher Chris Jenkins against
a Cal team that entered the game on a
four-game winning streak, which in
cluded a three-game sweep at home
against Arizona.

After three straight outs in the first
inning, Jenkins faced the heart of the
Cal lineup to start the second inning. He
issued two walks to the inning's first two
batters, catcher Chadd Krist and desig
nated hitter Tony Renda. After outfield
er Chad Bunting hit into a fielder's
choice that left runners on first and
third base, Jenkins issued two more
walks. The first, to right fielder Jimmy
Bosco, loaded the bases, while the next,
to third baseman Mitch Delfino, scored
Cal's first run of the game.
At this point, head coach Mark Mar
quess pulled Jenkins from the game in
favor of sophomore reliever Chris
Reed. After giving up a sacrifice fly that
drove in Bunting, Reed managed to get
the Cardinal out of the inning after giv
ing up just two runs as a team.
Jenkins' final stat line was singularly
unimpressive. He was charged with the
loss, dropping his season record to 0-2.

GAME NOTES: After falling in an exhibition game
against Cal on Monday, the No. 22 Cardinal will
look to rebound against Saint Mary's. The Cardi
nal has lost four of its last five games, but looks to
improve its conference record this weekend in a
three-game series with Oregon.

The Cardinal baseball team suffered a tough loss to cross-bay rival California on Monday. Although Cardinal pitchers Chris Jenkins,
Chris Reed, Mark Appel and Alex Pracher held the Bears to two runs on five hits, the Cardinal offense couldn't capitalize in the 2-0 loss.

He also surrendered two runs and
gave up four walks, all in the sec
ond inning, while facing just eight
batters in total.
After the second inning, Stan
ford's pitching was extremely ef
fective. After 4.1 innings, Reed
came out of the game, having sur
rendered four hits but no runs. The
Cardinal used two other pitchers in
the game freshman Mark Appel
and junior Alex Pracher who
combined to pitch the last 2.1 in
nings while holding the Bears to no
runs despite several strong rallies.
While Stanford's defense wasn't
especially strong the Cardinal
had two errors in the game —it
managed to contain its mistakes,
and none of its errors led to runs.
Though it played well defen
sively, Stanford's offense simply
fell flat against Cal's pitching.
After three good outings against
UCLA, the Cardinal could not
string together any rallies. Cal
pitcher Chris Petrini pitched seven
solid innings, allowing only four
hits and no runs while striking out
seven batters. His win in the game
was his first of the season he
now has a record of 1-0. Reliever
Kevin Miller was similarly good,
allowing two hits and no runs over
the final two innings to get the
save.
Though Stanford was unable to
score runs, it was not because of a
lack of opportunities. The Cardinal
left nine runners on base in the
game and failed to capitalize on
any of its chances.
Stanford returns to the Farm for
its next four games a midweek
game against Saint Mary's on Apr.
7 before a weekend series against
