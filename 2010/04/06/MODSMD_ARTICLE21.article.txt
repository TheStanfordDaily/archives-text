# TENNIS TAKES DOWN UCLA
## 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The depth of the No. 12 Stanford
women's tennis team (14-1,3-0 Pac-10) was
put on full display this past weekend as the
Cardinal's bottom three all won to push the
team past No. 7 UCLA (16-3,3-1) and main
tain a tie with No. 18 USC (11-7,3-1) before
rain stopped the match.
Scheduling was difficult as Stanford was
meant to face USC first on Friday before
play was suspended due to rain. No player
won more than one game before play was
halted until Sunday. The last time these two
teams faced off in Los Angeles, rain also
forced the players to cancel the match.
"It was really frustrating, especially Fri
day," said freshman Mallory Burdette.
"Once you get on the court you kind of
loosen up, but when you're waiting on the
rain, you never get a chance to loosen up."
The Cardinal was also forced to contend
with the only team to defeat it this season,
UCLA. They performed in convincing fash
ion to win, with the players at the bottom of
the lineup taking the day. In a reversal of last
match, Stanford swept the doubles, including
a close victory at the No. 2 spot when fresh
men Mallory Burdette and Stacey Tan de
feated their opponents, 9-7. Stanford's No. 2
nationally ranked doubles team, comprised
of junior Hilary Barte and senior Lindsay
Burdette, also defeated No. 4 Yasmin
Schnack and Andrea Remynse, 8-4. This was
the first time UCLA lost all three doubles
matches this season.
"UCLA was a lot of fun," Mallory Bur

dette said. "Stacey and I had a tough doubles
match to begin with, but we handled it really
well. We played super well."
Singles proved to be more difficult for the
players at the top. Lindsay Burdette contin
ued her recent struggles as she dropped her
fourth match in five games to No. 43 Noelle
Hickey 6-3,6-3.Tan and Barte both went the
full length, but with different results. Tan
reeled off five straight games to take her
match to a third set before falling 6-2,4-6,1-
0 (10-7). Barte was broken at the end of the
second set before toughing out a close third
set to win 6-3, 5-7,1-0 (10-8) and continue
her 18-match winning streak.
Spots four through six are where Stan
ford really came through. Mallory Burdette
blew through her opponent to finish first,
posting a 6-1,6-3 victory for her team-lead
ing 25th victory of the year. Sophomore
Veronica Li had an equally convincing victo
ry 6-4,6-1 at the six spot to put Stanford one
win away from defeating the Bruins. Minutes
after Lindsay Burdette lost to give UCLA its
first point, junior Carolyn McVeigh clinched
the match at the five spot, winning 6-4,6-3.
"In retrospect, it went excellent,"
McVeigh said. "I think we accomplished
everything we wanted aside from finishing
the USC match. Beating UCLA was a huge
step for us since we lost to them earlier in the
year. It's awesome to turn the tables on them
on our own home court and keep the streak
going."
With the home-court winning streak pro
tected for one more match, Stanford now ea-

Stanford's No. 8 ranked Hilary Barte led the Cardinal against UCLA and USC last weekend. The No.
12 Card performed well as a team, defeating the No. 7 Bruins and playing No. 18 USC to a tie.
gerly anticipated its matchup with
USC again. Unfortunately, the rain
came back. The teams agreed to play
singles first so that the match stood a
chance of being decided early. Stan
ford's depth showed up again as Li and
Mallory Burdette raced to 6-1,6-1 and
6-1, 6-3 decisions, respectively, to put
Stanford up, 2-0. The higher seeds fell
next. Lindsay Burdette dropped her
third in a row to No. 26 Alison Ramos
6-3,6-3 and Tan fell in three sets to No.
30 Danielle Lao 4-6,6-1,6-4.

The match came down to two
three-setters. Barte and McVeigh
were again thrust into the limelight
as both finished with incredibly tight
scores. McVeigh finished first, win
ning 2-6, 6-1, 7-5 to put Stanford
within one win of clinching the day. It
came down to Barte as play went to
a tiebreaker in the third set. Barte
was barely edged to lose 6-3,4-6,7-6
(8-6) in the eagerly anticipated

matchup of the No. 2 and No. 8 play
ers in the country in USC's Maria
Sanchez and Barte, respectively.
Rain forced the ends of McVeigh's
and Barte's match to be played in
doors one at a time. With the match
tied at 3-3, doubles will be played at
the Pac-10 Championships later this
month, but only if it is needed to de
cide the conference champion.
"I didn't have a great start,"
McVeigh said. "I lost the first set 6-2,
but in the second set, I refocused. At
that point, I could tell that it was
pretty close. My match would either
tie it or get us the win, but I knew it
was crucial. I fought hard and played
pretty well, handled the pressure a
bit better than she did."
"I feel like we've all come to real
ize how important [spots] four, five
and six are," Mallory Burdette said.
"We're a damn good team and we've
come to terms with the fact that
every spot is important. On any
given day, we have a good shot at
winning matches."
