# Basketball seeks year's first title
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
Remember the 1975-1976
school year? Gerald Ford
was in the White House, the
Buffalo Braves were in the
NBA Playoffs, Joe Morgan
won the MLB MVP award, Lynn
Swann won the Super Bowl MVP
award and Stanford still had a plural
mascot.
A lot has changed since then Ford
is dead, the Braves are now the Clippers
(and not in the playoffs), Morgan is a
broadcaster, Swann is a broadcaster
turned-politician and the Cardinals
dropped the "s."
The one constant throughout these
past few decades, though, has been the
success of Stanford athletics. Since that
'75-76 season ended, the Cardinal (or
Cardinals) have won at least one nation
al championship every year. From men's
water polo in 1976 to men's gymnastics
and women's rowing last year, Stanford
has surpassed every school in the coun
try in at least one sport every season for
33 seasons.
Why is this streak important?
Well, besides the fact that it's really
freaking impressive and by far an
NCAA record, it's also in jeopardy of
ending.
It's officially spring quarter, so we're
past two-thirds of the way through this
season. And we're still waiting for Stan
ford's first national championship of
2009-2010. Which is not to say that Car
dinal athletes have been struggling this
year far from it. Stanford is on pace
for another Director's Cup (its 16th
straight) thanks to some incredible sea
sons. At the last tally, the Cardinal had an
11-point lead in the Director's Cup
standings. And that doesn't include
women's basketball, men's swimming
or any of the spring sports that Stanford
has top teams in both gymnastics
teams, both tennis teams, men's volley
ball, women's water polo, etc. So it's safe
to say that Stanford is having a good
year sports-wise.
The fact remains, though, that here at
Stanford, we like to win. And tonight,
we've got a golden opportunity.
Stanford women's basketball is just
40 game minutes from a national cham
pionship.
Yes, I know those 40 minutes are
against one of the most dominant teams
in the sports world today, or maybe in
history. Yes, I know Connecticut hasn't
lost since Pangaea broke apart. Yes, I
know that no team has even gotten to
within single digits of UConn since di
nosaurs roamed the Earth, and that
Maya Moore and Una Charles could
drop 100 on the newly-inducted Dream
Team.
Or maybe it just seems that way.
UConn is really.really good,but not un
beatable. Just a few months ago, Stan
ford led these same Huskies at halftime.
In Connecticut. I know that's just a half,
and UConn dominated in the second
half, but it still shows that the Cardinal
can contend with the Huskies.
Because Stanford has some talent of
its own. Anyone who saw Nneka Og
wumike singlehandedly win a Final
Four game Sunday night knows what
she can do, and UConn could not stop
her. Kayla Pedersen is a matchup night
mare for anyone, and Jayne Appel can
throw caution to the wind and play her
heart (and ankle) out in her final colle
giate game. Jeanette Pohlen and Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude are strong defend
ers and underrated scorers and ball
handlers. JJ Hones and Joslyn Tinkle
provide good options off the bench, and
Tara VanDerveer can coach with the
best of them.
Of course UConn is favored how
can you not favor a team that has won
77 in a row? Pretty much everyone in
the country expects that number to go
up to 78 and probably a lot higher next
year.
But that shouldn't stop every Stan
ford fan from watching and cheering for
the Cardinal women tonight. We've got
a chance to end one of the most impres
sive streaks in sports and keep our own
streak alive. We can bring another na
tional championship back to the Farm.
Sure, we'll have more chances to win
titles, and this streak isn't the most im
portant thing in the world. Sure, there
are several more top-10 teams at Stan
ford with championship runs ahead of
them, and we'll have much more to root
for in the next few months.
But for tonight, it's all about
women's basketball.
