## International students may opt out of Cardinal Care 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” An Le Nguyen 
Vaden Health Center announced
Monday that international students
may now request an annual excep
tion to the University's requirement
that they purchase Cardinal Care
health insurance.
Under Vaden's new policy, inter
national students must provide proof
that their domestic insurance plan sat
isfies or exceeds a number of criteria.
Insurance plans must include an
annual deductible less than $l,OOO,
cover inpatient and outpatient med
ical care and mental health care in the
Bay Area and the United States,
cover both emergency and non-emer
gency care and cover prescriptions.
Health care policies are also re
quired to have a lifetime aggregate
maximum benefit of $2 million or a
maximum per lifetime benefit of
$500,000. The plans must insure stu
dents for an entire academic year, be
ginning Sept. 1 and ending Aug. 31.
To opt out of Cardinal Care, inter
national students should ask their in
surance company to complete an In
surance Coverage Certification
Form.
Addy Satija, a doctoral student in
electrical engineering and energy re
sources engineering, took part in ne
gotiations between administrators
and international students to ease the
Cardinal Care mandate, which was
announced in February.
"I think they're being very recep
tive to our suggestions," Satija said.
"They've been very prompt with im
plementing it."
"There are people who are not en
tirely satisfied with it," he added.
Eighty percent of international stu
dents are currently on Cardinal Care
plans.
Of the 20 percent remaining,
"how many of them might meet the
requirements [for exemption]?" said
Satija. "I honestly cannot put a num
ber to that, but if people had con
cerns, they had ample time and op
portunity to voice them. There were
public discussions. We were working
on the same side."
