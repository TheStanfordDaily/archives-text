HUSKIES
NO. 1(38-0)

It's on. The rematch that most fans
of women's college basketball were
probably hoping for will take place
tonight when Stanford takes on Con
necticut in the national championship
game.
This isn't a David and Goliath
story, but the fact that the No. 2 team
in the nation and No. 1 seed Cardinal
(36-1,18-0 Pac-10) will be the definite
underdog going into this contest says
everything about the undefeated and
undisputed No.l UConn Huskies (38-
0,16-0 Big East).
The all-time series between these
two teams from opposite sides of the
country is tied at 5-5, but it is the re
cent history that will be in the minds of
the players stepping out onto the
court. By that measure the score is 3-1
in the Huskies' favor, and they hold a
two-game win streak over the Cardi
nal.
Were it not for Connecticut, Stan
ford would have had a perfect season.
The single road loss in Storrs, Conn., is
the only blemish on a record-breaking
season that has given the Card both its
highest number of wins, 36, and
longest winning streak, 27, in school
history. Since Jan. 18, 2009, the team
has lost to just one school: UConn.
The last time the Huskies dropped
a game was two years ago against
Stanford, and it was a crucial one. If
the Cardinal had not knocked them
out of the Final Four in 2007, the
Huskies could very well be chasing
their third straight NCAA title.
