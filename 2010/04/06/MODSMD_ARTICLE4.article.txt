HUSKIES
NO. 1(38-0)

It's on. The rematch that most fans
of women's college basketball were
probably hoping for will take place
tonight when Stanford takes on Con
necticut in the national championship
game.
This isn't a David and Goliath
story, but the fact that the No. 2 team
in the nation and No. 1 seed Cardinal
(36-1,18-0 Pac-10) will be the definite
underdog going into this contest says
everything about the undefeated and
undisputed No.l UConn Huskies (38-
0,16-0 Big East).
The all-time series between these
two teams from opposite sides of the
country is tied at 5-5, but it is the re
cent history that will be in the minds of
the players stepping out onto the
court. By that measure the score is 3-1
in the Huskies' favor, and they hold a
two-game win streak over the Cardi
nal.
Were it not for Connecticut, Stan
ford would have had a perfect season.
The single road loss in Storrs, Conn., is
the only blemish on a record-breaking
season that has given the Card both its
highest number of wins, 36, and
longest winning streak, 27, in school
history. Since Jan. 18, 2009, the team
has lost to just one school: UConn.
The last time the Huskies dropped
a game was two years ago against
Stanford, and it was a crucial one. If
the Cardinal had not knocked them
out of the Final Four in 2007, the
Huskies could very well be chasing
their third straight NCAA title.

Stanford center Jayne Appel goes up for a shot against Oklahoma in the national
semifinal. The Cardinal won a close one to advance to the championship game.
Connecticut head coach Geno
Auriemma knows that his team, a
group that has blown most teams
clear out of the water at every stage
this year, is seen as the bad guys. He
is not afraid to reinforce this opinion
with his words.
"Let me tell you something," he
said. "If we're still undefeated next
year at the end of December, then
you know what? I'm not going to
come back afterward."
"It will be pointless," he contin
ued. "I will just lose all respect for
everybody coaching college basket
ball in this country."
Those words came in response to
a question about how his team will
cope after graduating five seniors,
but they are sure to add fuel to the
media fire.
The Connecticut team certainly
looks to be a formidable opponent
on paper. Two of its players, senior
center Tina Charles and junior for
ward Maya Moore, were named to
the State Farm All-America Basket
ball Team this week, and Moore also
became only the third player in his
tory to win the State Farm Wade Tro
phy for a second time. Charles was
also awarded the Naismith College
Player of the Year.
Stanford, however, is not far be
hind on accolades. The Card joined

UConn as the only other school to
have two players named to the State
Farm All-America team — senior
center Jayne Appel and sophomore
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike. Be
fore Moore impressed the crowds at
the Alamodome Sunday night with
34 points and 12 rebounds, Ogwu
mike had already finished her day's
work, scoring an NCAA semifinal
record of 38 points and grabbing 16
rebounds.
The performances of all five Car
dinal starters will be a key factor in
whether head coach Tara Van-
Derveer's team can stop the
Huskies' domination of this tourna
ment. UConn had its closest game
yet in its Final Four defeat of Baylor,
but still won by 20 points.
Offensively, Stanford also needs

to execute more successfully to
reach its full potential. Ogwumike's
record aside, the Cardinal shot poor
ly in the semifinal win over Okla
homa and the team cannot afford to
repeatedly miss from good shooting
positions if it is to defeat the Huskies.
The Cardinal showed a glimpse
back in December that perhaps it
can compete with, and defeat, the
unanimous top team in the country.
That game ended 80-68 in UConn's
favor, but Stanford held a narrow
lead at halftime and had succeeded
up to that point at keeping the
Huskies in check.
Both groups of players have
played a lot of games since, however,
and these are not the same teams
that faced each other over three
months ago. If any team can prevent
the Huskies from earning their sec
ond straight title it will be the Cardi
nal, and, if Stanford comes away vic
torious, the revenge will be very
sweet.
The final game of the season will
take place at 5:30 p.m. PST from the
Alamodome in San Antonio, Tex.
GAME NOTES: After taking down Oklahoma in
the national semifinal, Stanford faces the only
team to defeat it this season, Connecticut in
the national championship game. In the semi
final game, the Cardinal was led by Nnemkadi
Ogwumike's 38 points and 16 rebounds, and
the team will need contributions from all of its
players to win the title.

on paper. Two of its players, senior
center Tina Charles and junior for
ward Maya Moore, were named to
the State Farm All-America Basket
ball Team this week, and Moore also
became only the third player in his
tory to win the State Farm Wade Tro
phy for a second time. Charles was
also awarded the Naismith College
Player of the Year.
Stanford, however, is not far be
hind on accolades. The Card joined

UConn as the only other school to
have two players named to the State
Farm All-America team — senior
center Jayne Appel and sophomore
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike. Be
fore Moore impressed the crowds at
the Alamodome Sunday night with
34 points and 12 rebounds, Ogwu
mike had already finished her day's
work, scoring an NCAA semifinal
record of 38 points and grabbing 16
rebounds.
The performances of all five Car
dinal starters will be a key factor in
whether head coach Tara Van-
Derveer's team can stop the
Huskies' domination of this tourna
ment. UConn had its closest game
yet in its Final Four defeat of Baylor,
but still won by 20 points.
Offensively, Stanford also needs

to execute more successfully to
reach its full potential. Ogwumike's
record aside, the Cardinal shot poor
ly in the semifinal win over Okla
homa and the team cannot afford to
repeatedly miss from good shooting
positions if it is to defeat the Huskies.
The Cardinal showed a glimpse
back in December that perhaps it
can compete with, and defeat, the
unanimous top team in the country.
That game ended 80-68 in UConn's
favor, but Stanford held a narrow
lead at halftime and had succeeded
up to that point at keeping the
Huskies in check.
Both groups of players have
played a lot of games since, however,
and these are not the same teams
that faced each other over three
months ago. If any team can prevent
the Huskies from earning their sec
ond straight title it will be the Cardi
nal, and, if Stanford comes away vic
torious, the revenge will be very
sweet.
The final game of the season will
take place at 5:30 p.m. PST from the
Alamodome in San Antonio, Tex.
GAME NOTES: After taking down Oklahoma in
the national semifinal, Stanford faces the only
team to defeat it this season, Connecticut in
the national championship game. In the semi
final game, the Cardinal was led by Nnemkadi
Ogwumike's 38 points and 16 rebounds, and
the team will need contributions from all of its
players to win the title.
