# ASSU Senate coalitions talk differences
## Candidates present unified visions 
### ZOE RICHARDS MARISA LANDICHO 
Trying to stand out in a sea of slogans, candidates for ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate are pooling their resources and forming
groups to clinch votes on April 8. Two new coalitions have
emerged this year, both hoping to garner votes based on shared
ideals and experiences.
The notion of candidate coalitions, where students band to
gether to campaign for Senate seats, is a relatively recent innova
tion. Although students endorsed by the longstanding Students of
Color Coalition (SOCC) traditionally have been visible with their
SOCC affiliation noted on campaign materials, running as a group
was largely unprecedented until last year's Students for a Better
Stanford (SBS) came forward.
This year. Students United Now (SUN) has positioned itself as
a coalition of 12 students with three shared policy goals.
SUN is composed of freshmen Stewart Macgregor-Dennis,
Jason Lupatkin, Ed Negiar, Rebecca Sachs, Percia Safar, Rahul
Sastry, Will Seaton, Bennett Siegel, Carolyn Simmons, Dan
Thompson and Showly Wang and lone junior Nikola Milanovic.
Seaton is a writer for The Daily; Milanovic is a columnist.
The group boasts a unified front
on issues of student advocacy, trans
parency of the student group fund
ing process and interfacing with
University administrators to better
address student needs.

Conceived midway through win
ter quarter, many of SUN's mem
bers honed professional relation
ships through the ASSU as members
of Frosh Council or in dorm govern
ment.

Meanwhile, the four master
minds behind Students with Experi
ence (S.Ex.), a contending slate, are
seeking to distinguish themselves
from the pack of Senate hopefuls
through their combined experience
as upperclassmen.
Juniors Philip Bui and Danny
Crichton, along with sophomores
Andrew Jang and Miles Unterrein
er, came together before the final
petitions deadline to form the S.Ex.
coalition. The four are among the
few non-freshmen running for Sen
ate; of the 39 Senate candidates on
the ballot, 30 are freshmen.
Crichton, a columnist for The
Daily, earlier threw his hat in the
ring for ASSU executive with cur
rent senator Shelley Gao 'll, but
abandoned his bid when Gao
dropped out of the race.

Crichton then considered run
ning for Senate. He said the coali
tion "formed organically" before pe
titions closed. The group eventually
chose the name "S.Ex." to bring
some humor to the campaign.
"S.Ex. is a tool for us to get peo
ple's attention and bring them in to

talk about our real platform," Bui
said.

Pushing their class diversity and
student experience, the members of
S.Ex. want to represent the average
Stanford student's views.

The group staked itself as a mod
erate option between SUN and
SOCC-endorsed candidates.

"What we're trying to do is pro
vide a third option for people
people who want the best ideas of
SOCC and SBS or SUN," said Un
terreiner, who is also a contributing
writer for The Daily.
SUN, by contrast, remains un
apologetic about its overwhelming
composition of freshman candi
dates, who see their "freshness" as
more of an instrument than a handi
cap.

"We have the pros of being fresh
men and being able to bring fresh
ideas," Wang said, suggesting that as
relative newcomers to the Universi
ty, SUN members are not yet
"jaded."

Crichton said SUN is of the same
"lineage" as last year's SBS coali
tion, to which eight current senators
belonged last year.

SUN contends, however, that de
spite casual conversation with cur
rent senators involved in SBS, its
motivations are fresh and entirely of
its own.

The SUN coalition also said they
do not oppose candidates endorsed
by SOCC, despite implications
made by S.Ex.
"To contrast us with SOCC is just
to simplify the situation," Lupatkin
said.

"Our priorities are priorities that
affect the student body as a whole,
whereas their priorities are priori
ties that affect students of color,"
said SUN member Thompson.

"It's just a different approach
a different level of specificity," he
added.

According to Sachs, SUN made a
"conscious decision" about a set of
concrete issues they saw as most
salient for the Senate's agenda next
year. Advocacy is at the forefront of
that agenda, she said.

While SUN commends the cur
rent Senate on its efforts to improve
campus sustainability and to cut its
own salaries, coalition members said
this year's Senate has left much to be
desired particularly in Appropri
ations and communication.

"We hope that we can come in
and fill that gap," Safar said.

"We're united with the same end
goals in mind," Lupatkin said,
adding, "We're all running together
because we share this vision we
are in the unique position next year
to work together and actually en
hance student life."
