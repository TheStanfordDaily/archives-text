# ASSU Senate coalitions talk differences
## Candidates present unified visions 
### ZOE RICHARDS MARISA LANDICHO 
Trying to stand out in a sea of slogans, candidates for ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate are pooling their resources and forming
groups to clinch votes on April 8. Two new coalitions have
emerged this year, both hoping to garner votes based on shared
ideals and experiences.
The notion of candidate coalitions, where students band to
gether to campaign for Senate seats, is a relatively recent innova
tion. Although students endorsed by the longstanding Students of
Color Coalition (SOCC) traditionally have been visible with their
SOCC affiliation noted on campaign materials, running as a group
was largely unprecedented until last year's Students for a Better
Stanford (SBS) came forward.
This year. Students United Now (SUN) has positioned itself as
a coalition of 12 students with three shared policy goals.
SUN is composed of freshmen Stewart Macgregor-Dennis,
Jason Lupatkin, Ed Negiar, Rebecca Sachs, Percia Safar, Rahul
Sastry, Will Seaton, Bennett Siegel, Carolyn Simmons, Dan
Thompson and Showly Wang and lone junior Nikola Milanovic.
Seaton is a writer for The Daily; Milanovic is a columnist.
