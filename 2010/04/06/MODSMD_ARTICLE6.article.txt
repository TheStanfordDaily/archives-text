## Farm's seniors stand to benefit from new health care extension 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Newly passed federal health care reform legislation is giving some
graduating Stanford seniors a little peace of mind: they may now stay
on their parents' health insurance plans as dependents until they are
26 years old.
"There's a chance I will be with a position [next year] that doesn't
offer health insurance," said senior Robert Girgis. "I had thought
about it, and I wouldn't know what I would d 0... without the
change in policy."
President Obama signed the relevant health care reform legisla
tion into law on March 23. Six months from then, the bill will compel
insurance companies to cover dependents under their parents' plans.
The six-month delay leaves a gap
for graduating seniors since coverage
will not begin until September, but it
could cover many people in the long
term.

"I'm hoping that after I graduate
I'll be covered by the plan," said
Steve Ko 'll. "At the time it is enact
ed, I will still be a student, so it does
work."

Currently, students have the op
tion of staying with Cardinal Care,
the health insurance plan Stanford
offers, until Aug. 31 after graduation
by continuing to pay the premium.
The Stanford Alumni Association
also offers major medical insurance

options for recent graduates and
graduates between jobs.
However, Stanford graduates are,
by age, part of the most at-risk group
when it comes to health insurance.
According to the U.S. Census Bu
reau, half of the estimated 46 million
uninsured people in the United
States are between the ages of 18 and
34, the bracket in which almost all un
dergraduate students fall.
Some Stanford graduates do have
jobs coming out of graduation that
offer them insurance, but for many,
the new federal policy may act as a
buffer until such coverage is ob
tained.

Ira Friedman, the director of
Vaden Health Center, said Stanford
has been concerned with insurance
for recent graduates for some time.
The extension of Cardinal Care will
help, he said, but Friedman also

praised the new policy.
"I think it's a big step forward for
students to have the option to remain
longer on their parents' health insur
ance," Friedman said.

Some states already had similar
legislation to the newly passed feder
al legislation. In others, like Califor
nia, no insurance company is com
pelled to cover dependents once they
turn 19 or graduate from college.
A number of Stanford students,
including undergraduates, expressed
satisfaction with the new policy.

"I like the extension of insurance
coverage until 26. It's one less thing
I'll have to worry about," Ben Supat
'l2 said. "I hadn't really thought
about [health care] until after I heard
about the legislation."
