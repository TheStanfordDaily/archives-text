## Farm's seniors stand to benefit from new health care extension 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Newly passed federal health care reform legislation is giving some
graduating Stanford seniors a little peace of mind: they may now stay
on their parents' health insurance plans as dependents until they are
26 years old.
"There's a chance I will be with a position [next year] that doesn't
offer health insurance," said senior Robert Girgis. "I had thought
about it, and I wouldn't know what I would d 0... without the
change in policy."
President Obama signed the relevant health care reform legisla
tion into law on March 23. Six months from then, the bill will compel
insurance companies to cover dependents under their parents' plans.
