-- really think that the introduction of the iPad is very
likely in the long run as important as the intro
duction of the Macintosh in 1984," said Paul Saffo, a
technology forecaster and consulting associate pro
fessor of mechanical engineering.
Recent earnings reports seem to lend some credibility to Saffo's
high praise. According to the Associated Press, Apple sold over
300,000 iPads in the United States on Saturday, when the device
first hit the market.
But given the iPad's $499 starting price, many skeptics question
whether or not the device is a worthwhile investment for the aver
age consumer. Critics have pointed out that the new tablet occu
pies an ambiguous territory it is not quite a laptop computer,
but it stands to be a much more powerful multimedia tool than the
iPhone and iPod Touch.
Whether or not the iPad can carve out its own market niche re
mains to be seen.
Same old, same old?
"In the short run, this is going to be about screening movies,
iPhone apps and web access and text on this machine," Saffo said.
"Whenever we have a new technology we always use the new tech
nology to do an old thing in a new way."
