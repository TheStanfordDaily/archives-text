## IPAD A 						"NEW CATEGORY" OF COMPUTING DEVICE

-- really think that the introduction of the iPad is very
likely in the long run as important as the intro
duction of the Macintosh in 1984," said Paul Saffo, a
technology forecaster and consulting associate pro
fessor of mechanical engineering.
Recent earnings reports seem to lend some credibility to Saffo's
high praise. According to the Associated Press, Apple sold over
300,000 iPads in the United States on Saturday, when the device
first hit the market.
But given the iPad's $499 starting price, many skeptics question
whether or not the device is a worthwhile investment for the aver
age consumer. Critics have pointed out that the new tablet occu
pies an ambiguous territory it is not quite a laptop computer,
but it stands to be a much more powerful multimedia tool than the
iPhone and iPod Touch.
Whether or not the iPad can carve out its own market niche re
mains to be seen.
Same old, same old?
"In the short run, this is going to be about screening movies,
iPhone apps and web access and text on this machine," Saffo said.
"Whenever we have a new technology we always use the new tech
nology to do an old thing in a new way."
According to Joachim De Lombaert 'O9,
who previously worked at Apple as a Mac
Genius and currently serves as the lead en
gineer at the social networking tool
friend.ly, the new gadget has a number of
obvious merits.
"I recently brought my 15-inch laptop,
spare battery and charger on a weeklong
trip," De Lombaert wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "That's a bulky seven pounds to
carry around."
"During the entire trip, I used it primari
ly for watching videos and checking web
sites, and did a little bit of programming
work," he added. "The iPad can do the
same but would have been much more con
venient to bring along."
In its first iteration, the iPad also pres
ents users with a noticeable change: the ab
sence of a keyboard and mouse.
"For developers that means not being
chained to a device with a keyboard...
The screen is much more flexible so devel
opers have a greater degree of freedom in
terms of delivering an experience to con
sumers," Saffo said.
Indeed, a host of free and priced appli
cations have already cropped up on
Apple's iTunes Store. An overwhelming
majority of top-selling applications are in
teractive games that make use of the iPad's

sleek, multi-touch screen.
The current applications, however, are
just a sampling of those to come.
"You have to separate this particular
iPad as a product in its own right from the
trajectory of the iPads to come," Saffo said.
"This is obviously the first draft of a ma
chine that's going to be updated very rapid
ly-"
Consumers can expect innovative appli
cations to accompany these developments.
Making headlines
"What's exciting is, give this nine to 12
months, and you're going to very quickly
see people coming up with new kinds of
apps that deliver new kinds of media expe
riences that never quite existed before,"
Saffo said.
Market experts have noted that the
iPad's ability to function as a tablet reader
lends itself well to novel electronic plat
forms for magazines and newspapers.
"I think what you're going to see in fair
ly short order is newspaper pages that kind
of look like the newspapers in Harry Potter,
where the images on the screen the pic
tures are constantly moving and the text
is a lot more dynamic," Saffo said.
The iPad also has far-reaching potential
from a social angle, said Ge Wang, profes

sor of music and, by courtesy, of computer
science.
"It's not so much in the features that it
provides," Wang said. "It's kind of about
where people are when people are comput
ing in their daily lives."
Wang even sees an opportunity for the
iPad to be practically implemented in the
realm of music. His Stanford Mobile Phone
Orchestra currently employs iPhones as its
main musical instrument. Wang predicts
that the iPad will add an exciting new facet
to the orchestra's repertoire.
"I think it's really something that we've
been waiting for in the music technology
world," Wang said.
"We suddenly have a new class of instru
ments," he added.
Wang's start-up also released a music
application. Magic Piano, that exploits the
iPad's large, multi-touch screen. In addition
to allowing iPad users to play along to pro
grammed songs,
"the application connects users one by one
so that they can actually play with each
other in real time over the Internet," Wang
said.
Fine tuning
But for every zealous iPad fan, there is
an equally vocal critic. A number of tech ex

perts have complained about the device's
lack of multitasking capabilities and its in
ability to run Adobe Flash. And unlike the
iPhone, the iPad does not include a built-in
camera or phone conferencing capacities.
"Everybody always wants one device
that solves all problems and that's just not
the world that we're in," Saffo added. "This
is, in the short run, not a device you use in
stead of a laptop; it's a device you use in ad
dition to the laptop."
"It's like the iPhone in that a lot of the
uses start suggesting themselves over
time, especially when you open the
platform," Wang agreed.
Saffo predicted that Apple
will move aggressively to
maintain its lead in this new
tablet territory; he ex
pects prices to drop
and capabilities to in
crease as a result.
"My advice to any- \
body except the diehard \
enthusiast is wait a month
or two," Saffo said. "The ma
chines to come are going to be
better."
