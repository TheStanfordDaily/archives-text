## Bike thefts tire students, police Campus safety experts say that bike robberies follow trends

Stephanie Webb 'l3 left her bike locked to
itself with a cable lock over winter break. When
she returned to campus, her light pink Fuji was
still parked outside her dorm, Florence Moore,
but it was freshly secured with someone else's
U-Lock.
Another student. Lea Gee-Tong 'l3, parked
her bicycle outside the Palo Alto Caltrain sta
tion to visit her grandfather at the hospital in
San Francisco. Though Gee-Tong locked her
bike to a rack with a U-lock, she still found her
bike missing four hours later.
The police told her "there wasn't really any
thing that can be done, even if I had the registra
tion number," she said.

Campus and area police face the challenge of preventing bike thefts at
Stanford, which is home to some 12,000 bicycles. Safety experts warn
students to take extra precautions when they lock up their bikes.
everyday life than they once thought.
According to Stanford Chief of
Police Laura Wilson, as unemploy
ment rates go up, the number of bike
thefts also rises, and police officers
can do very little to stop it.
"There is a remarkable trend,"
Wilson said. "If you look at the graph

of the unemployment rate in Santa
Clara County, and you put the graph
of bicycle thefts over that, there are
remarkable correlations."

According to the 2009 Stanford
University Safety, Security and Fire
Report, 297 bikes were stolen in 2007,
353 in 2008 and 351 in 2009. About 73
bikes thefts have been reported so far
in 2010.

The January unemployment rates
for Santa Clara County in 2007,2008
and 2009 were 4.7 percent, 5.1 percent
and 9.3 percent, respectively, accord

ing to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statis
tics. The January 2010 unemployment
rate is 12.1 percent.
The Department of Public Safety
has conducted no formal study on the
perceived pattern.
Wilson said the height of reported
bike robberies occurs in September
and October. She added that if stu
dents leave their bikes on campus
over the summer, they typically re
port thefts after they return to the
Farm.
William Larson, a spokesperson

for the Stanford Department of Pub
lic Safety, speculated that the most
frequently targeted areas for bike
thefts are around student residences,
the Main Quad and the Medical
School.

Students can avoid becoming vic
tims of bike thefts "by licensing and
securing their bicycles in a well-lit and
visible area," wrote Larson in an e
mail to The Daily.
Larson said bicycles are usually
stolen because they are not properly
secured. He recommended that stu

dents secure their bikes to a bicycle
rack with a U-lock.
Wilson, however, said U-locks may
even be inadequate.
"It's very easy to steal an unlocked
bicycle," she said. "It's moderately
easy to steal a bike locked with a cable
lock, but even U-locks can be shat
tered."
Wilson estimated that only three to
five bike thieves are caught each year.
