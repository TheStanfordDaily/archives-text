Stanford Continuing Studies Presents
Mark Twain Anniversary Festival:
Ken Burns' Mark Twain Film Series
Join Twain scholar and Director of Stanford's Program in
American Studies Shelley Fisher Fishkin and prolific author
Hilton Obenzinger for a two part film series, Ken Burns'
Mark Iwain. Mark Twain is the fifth film in Ken Burns'
popular American Lives series and features interviews with
Hal Holbrook, Arthur Miller, and leading Twain scholars. A
popular humorist, philosopher, and social satirist, Mark Twain was
the nation's first literary celebrity. Tracing Twain's rise from his
humble birth in Missouri to his prosperous life in Connecticut as
the nation's best-selling author, Burns' film reveals a compelling
portrait of the father of American literature.
