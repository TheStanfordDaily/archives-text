A scary page on Stanford's Explore Degrees
Web site is entitled "Undergraduate Major
Unit Requirements." Units wise, it doesn't
start off too badly. Under the School of
Humanities and Sciences, you read: "African
and African American Studies 60 units," "American
Studies 60 units," "Anthropology 65 units." A nasty
shock comes a couple of majors down with "Biology
93-104 units".
Though the engineers may scoff at such a low unit
count, no other major in this particular school approach
es biology's list of required classes. With pre-meds a dime
a dozen at Stanford, many brave souls plunge into the
dreaded organic chemistry series, the labs and the utterly
bewildering nest of classes that must perfectly slot into
student's four-year plan.
Fortunately, potential biology majors are not left to
navigate the course of their Stanford career alone, guided
solely by hearsay and horror stories passed down from
generation to generation. That's where Bioßridge comes
in.
The Bioßridge program acts as a key advisory pro
gram to lead lost and overwhelmed students through the
labyrinth of classes, research, internships and abroad
options open to biology majors.
"Bioßridge mentors serve as advisors for biology
majors, of course, but we also advise any students who are
interested in the biology major, including undergraduates
who have not yet declared and prospective freshmen
who look to major in biology at Stanford," said Ashley
Lau, TO, Bioßridge's head advisor this year.
She said the program's focus is to serve as "liaisons
between biology undergraduates and faculty in the
department and program events throughout the year
that periodically remind biology majors that they are part
of a community that includes their peers and faculty."
These events include faculty lunches, research work
shops, midterm cookies and the annual Pumpkinfest, a
pumpkin-carving competition between different biology
labs around Halloween.
"We have panels about applying to graduate school,
panels featuring Stanford biology alumni and panels
about finding research opportunities," said Anthony
Nguyen, 'lO, another Bioßridge mentor. "We also have at
least one trip to Hopkins Marine Station a quarter to
show students around and see if this is where they want
to spend a quarter."
Bioßridge advisors have office hours in Gilbert Hall

every weekday from one until four in the afternoon. At
their office hours, they answer questions from any stu
dent interested in pursuing biology in any capacity,
though "because of the nature of the major, pre-meds
inevitably make up a sizable portion of the population of
students we advise" Lau said.
Yet the main purpose of Bioßridge is outreach to the
biology department. According to Nguyen, it's about
more than "how to get into med school."
Mica Esquenazi 'l3 finds the idea of additional pre
med resources reassuring.
"There are three pre-med advisors for the whole stu
dent body, so it's a little tough to get individual attention,
but Bioßridge is available whenever you need them,"
Esquenazi said.
Justin Lam 'l3 was similarly relieved to find the
Bioßridge program.
"I think Bioßridge would help me clarify some of the
things I'm not sure of," he said, explaining his need of
some guidance with his goal of simultaneously being pre
med and obtaining an art history degree.
The Bioßridge advisors find their jobs rewarding,
recalling being so recently in the shoes of the students
they counsel.
"I've been through a lot of biology courses, done
undergraduate research, went through the whole process
of finding an advisor, and I had a lot of questions myself,
so now I want to help younger students through the
process and be there to answer the questions that are
sure to come up," Nguyen said.
For Sarah Macway 'lO, another Bioßridge mentor, the
joy in working with the program stems from her desire to
make sure biology majors can successfully and painlessly
navigate the scope of their chosen major.
"I'm really excited about biology, so I like trying to
help people find ways to be excited about it too, talking
about classes, or Hopkins, or whatever interests them that
we can provide," she said.
Lau agreed.
"I think the size and breadth of the biology major
makes a peer advising group a necessary and integral
part of student services," Lau said. "For freshmen and
sophomores who have not chosen a major yet, the deci
sion-making process, as well as the declaration process
itself, can be daunting. Personally, I think that having reli
able advice from peers who have just gone through the
process is invaluable, and I wanted to be part of the group
that helps to provide it."
