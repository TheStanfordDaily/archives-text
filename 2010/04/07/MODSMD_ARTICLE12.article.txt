## ASSU flyers cause damage 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
Tape on the flyers of 10 ASSU Sen
ate and special fees candidates has
caused minor damage to walls in resi
dences, prompting complaints and
fees from Student Housing, Elections
Commissioner Quinn Slack 'll said
Tuesday.
Housing banned further flyering
in Branner, Crothers, Crothers
Memorial, Castano, Kimball, Lantana
andToyon, Slack said.
Clear tape appears to have caused
minor paint damage, according to
Slack's announcement.
"University policy states that fly
ers should only be posted on bulletin
boards and approved places in White
Plaza," Slack wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Flyers on building walls, bol
lards, stop signs and the ground are all
against University policy."
Campaigns are due to wrap on
Thursday when voting begins.
