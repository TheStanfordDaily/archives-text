## EDITORIAL SAFRA benefits students and taxpayers alike 
### 
Just a few weeks ago, President Barack
Obama signed into law an overhaul of the
college student loan program known as
the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act
(SAFRA),incorporated into the Health Care
and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.
This legislation fundamentally changes the
way the federal student loan industry works
commercial banking lenders no longer act
as the intermediaries of federal student loans.
Instead, students will now contract loans di
rectly with the government. While there may
be cries of socialism and job loss, the effects of
this overhaul will directly benefit both the
taxpayer and the college student.
The student loan industry has been averse
to change because the government subsidy
program has provided banks with a lucrative
and ever-growing source of income. The gov
ernment subsidized the banks to act as mid
dlemen for students seeking federal loans.
Federal insurance guaranteed that banks
would offer low interest rate loans to students
with no credit history. The result of this, how
ever, was that the banks made substantial
profits on interest, while the government
would end up paying for 97 percent of loan
defaults.
With the new legislation, the government
has cut out the middlemen in order remedy
this inefficient and costly system. The White
House projects that this law will save taxpay
ers $6B billion over the next decade. In re
sponse, the banking industry may moan and
groan about lost jobs. The processing of loans
and payment collection, however, will still be
handled through banks, which should mean
that overall job loss will be relatively low.
As students, we may wonder how this will
affect us directly. For the most part, the law
works to change the education environment
and not the individual student. Loan options
will remain similar to those at the present, but

college graduates will have a cap on annual
loan repayments at 10 percent of their current
income. This will help alleviate the immediate
financial burden for students who have just
graduated and entered the job market.
One of the most important aspects of
SAFRA is that the money saved through the
bill will be specifically allocated for deficit re
duction and education spending. In the area
of education, the government plans to use the
funds to increase the number of Pell Grants
offered each year, found new community col
leges and contribute 2.55 billion dollars to his
torically African-American colleges and uni
versities.
As Stanford students, the loan process will
be simpler and easier. Only one lender, the
Department of Education, will exist. This
streamlines the process and also alleviates
some of the difficulties in Stanford's loan
process. The economy forced the University
to consider direct lending through the Uni
versity. While this will still be available, the
new government-run loan program will en
sure that students receive the loans they need.
The fundamental change in the student
loan law brings about a much-needed philo
sophical change for the student loan industry.
No longer will banks profit off of students in
need of loans. These loans will not only help
facilitate the education of current and future
students, but will save every taxpayer money
as well. Cutting out the middleman in the stu
dent loan industry may not appear to empow
er the student in a new way; nonetheless, it
does empower the government to create a
stronger higher education environment while
continuing to protect those with student loans.
SAFRA takes key steps to change one facet of
our nation's higher education system that re
quired an update. Hopefully, further reform
will continue to alleviate some of the difficul
ties for those seeking higher education.
