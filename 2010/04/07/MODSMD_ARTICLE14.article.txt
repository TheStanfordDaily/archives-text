# GET IT RIGHT
## The 						Drilling Distraction 
### Erica Morgan 
President Bill Clinton set an important
precedent for his Democratic succes-
when the public is unhappy with
you, attempt to appease the Republicans
with dramatic action and pray that your con
stituents are sufficiently distracted to the
point of forgetting your prior transgressions.
After having sexual relations with "that
woman" and subsequently perjuring himself
in front of the American people, Clinton or
dered cruise missile strikes on supposed ter
rorist targets. Undoubtedly, Clinton expect
ed a rally-round-the-flag reaction from con
servative critics. Unfortunately, he only suc
ceeded in destroying an innocent pharma
ceutical plant, and his political opponents
continued to recognize him for the charlatan
that he was/is. Despite its failure, this strategy
has reemerged under the reign of President
Obama.

Having foisted an unsatisfactory health
care mandate on the American people,
Obama has lost strong approval from all but
34 percent of the nation's voters. In fact, ac
cording to the Rasmussen Report from Mon
day, 48 percent of polled voters claim that
they find themselves more closely aligned to
the average Tea Party member than to the
president. What can he offer to disgruntled
conservative constituents as both a bribe and
a distraction to convince them that he's their
man? Offshore drilling, of course!
Granted, the expansion of offshore oil
and gas exploration is not quite on par with
the obliteration of an innocent Sudanese as
pirin factory. Yet I predict it will be as ineffec
tive in rallying Republican support as Clin
ton's diversionary tactic.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the
plan would "eventually open two thirds of
the eastern Gulfs oil and gas resources for
drilling, proceed with drilling off Virginia,
provided the project clears environmental
and military reviews, study the viability of the
mid- and southern Atlantic coasts and study
the viability of drilling in Alaska's Beaufort
and Chukchi seas." This is a positive step, we
are told, toward freeing ourselves from for
eign oil dependence and creating jobs. So,
why aren't drill-happy Republicans dancing
with delight? They are likely wary of sashay
ing into the political trap set by the adminis
tration. Not only is there an obvious political
agenda driving the "concessions," but there is
also the possibility that the offering may be
retracted at any time. An article on
Forbes.com nicely outlines such a concern:
"The administration's concessions on off
shore access represent a clear quid pro quo
strategy designed to secure Republican sup
port for a climate bill to pass through Con
gress in 2010."The White House may official
ly claim that the plan is unrelated to Obama's
political agenda, but most Americans of ei
ther political persuasion are not, in fact,
blind, dumb and ignorant of the political

endgame. Democrats such as Senator Robert
Menendez indicate that the strategy must be
milked for all it's worth. "If issues like coast
line drilling are being promoted to gain Re
publican votes and support from oil compa
nies, then we need to know exactly how much
support it will actually deliver." Menendez
clearly recognizes Obama's thinly veiled pur
suit of political capital and suggests that he
makes certain that the ends justify the
drilling concessions.
Moreover, the bone tossed to Republi
cans represents a rather empty offer. As the
Forbes article mentions, "These perceived
concessions made on the part of the Obama
administration are at the mercy of the Envi
ronmental Protection Agency. The president
could later use his bureaucratic reach to
delay and even negate these concessions...
" Consider: the current administration is
pushing for drastic emissions reductions in
the near future, with the target fossil fuel
usage set at 10 percent of the national energy
mix by 2050. Current energy usage requires
86 percent fossil fuels. Also, consider the ex
treme stringency of regulatory requirements
for oil exploration in U.S. waters. Even if
drilling is approved, it will be years before
any oil sees the light of day and effectively re
duces our foreign dependence or strengthens
our economy. It seems likely that this "peace
offering" seeking to garner Republican sup
port for a climate bill that, once passed, will
negate the utility of drilling in the first place.
Ultimately, Mr. Obama has succeeded in
little beyond outraging his environmentally
conscious fan base and earning skeptically
raised eyebrows from his political oppo
nents.
