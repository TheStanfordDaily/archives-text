# STRANGELY CHARMING
## A 						Party of Cosmic Proportions 
### Jack Cackler 
Next week will mark the 49th anniver
sary of the day Yuri Gagarin became
the first person ever to leave the plan
et, on April 12,1961. In just under two hours,
Gagarin launched from what is now Kaza
khstan, orbited the planet once, landed near
by and was immediately a Soviet hero and in
ternational sensation, propelling the planet
irrevocably into the Space Age. Exactly
twenty years later, April 12,1981, the space
shuttle Columbia lifted off from Kennedy
Space Center as the inaugural space shuttle
mission. After nearly 30 years of science and
low Earth orbit exploration, the space shut
tle's final mission will be this September.
And so twenty years later, on April 12,2001,
Yuri's Night was born, a party to celebrate
space. The tenth Yuri's Night will commence
this weekend, and one of the biggest celebra
tions will be just down the road at NASA
Ames Research Center.

Perhaps the word party, however, doesn't
do justice to the magnitude of Yuri's Night.
At its outset, Yuri's Night was celebrated in
64 cities around the planet, and that number
has now reached over 150, including celebra
tions on all seven continents (yes, that in
cludes the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Sta
tion), 53 countries, as well as on the Interna
tional Space Station, which will be hosting
the Space Shuttle Discovery. The parties are
a unique combination of technological expo
sitions, cultural celebrations and wild, out
landish fun.

Two years ago, my house applied for an
education grant to attend the festivities,
courtesy of the wonderful folks at Residen
tial Education. Bedecked with glow sticks, as
we passed by Hangar One, the eight acre
New Deal era airship hangar, we descended
upon a truly amazing scene. Both amateurs
and professionals were showing off function
al airplanes, flying saucers and fire-breathing
robots; leaders in the space community
spoke of visions of the future; scientists dis-

cussed their latest research and, as night fell,
there was an enormous dance party inside
one of the hangars. In attendance were sever
al astronauts, including Buzz Aldrin, as well
as tens of thousands of people. Needless to
say, a good time was had by all.
Yuri's Night was realized through the
Space Generation Advisory Council, a U.N.
affiliated NGO, and one of the founders was
Stanford alumna Loretta Hidalgo Whitesides
'96. It's incredible how the effort of a few ded
icated people has blossomed in just a decade,
and inspirational to any Stanford student that
wants to change the world. The vision behind
the movement was to create a truly global cel
ebration of space, in an effort to show how
small the world really is. In many ways, one of
the best ways to gain an appreciation for the
only planet we have is by leaving it.
First time astronauts often report a sense
of wonder in seeing the whole planet for the
first time without lines in the sand marking
borders, and a sense of belonging to the plan
et, rather than to a city or a nation. Voyager 1
is a spaceship that is currently over 10 billion
miles away, the man-made object farthest
from the Earth. At the behest of Carl Sagan,
Voyager was turned around just before leav
ing the solar system, and snapped a seminal
astronomy picture, which has been called the
"Pale Blue Dot." In the picture, the Earth is a
mere speck in which, to paraphrase Sagan, all
of human history, each birth, each death,
each success, each failure, each war, each

peace treaty and each NCAA Women's Bas
ketball Championship game (awesome sea
son guys!) transpired. Some might see this
picture as an example of the insignificance of
Earth. I prefer to see it as a majestic wake-up
call to the vast wonder of the universe and
how much left there is to explore, as well as
an indication of how small the world is and
how connected we all are.
Yuri's Night at Ames this year will take
place April 9 and 10, and has an impressive
line-up of speakers and performers. Richard
Garriot, the world's first second-generation
astronaut, and Apple co-founder Steve Woz
niak will both be on hand to talk about their
life experiences, among many others. Musical
performances range from Les Claypool to
Common. Art installations have names such
as "Raygun Gothic Rocketship" and "The
Serpent Mother," which is actually described
as "A 180'-long, audience-controlled fire
breathing animatronic snake who is protect
ing her egg." Once more for emphasis: you
can control a fire-breathing robot snake half
as long as Hoover Tower is tall.
When President Kennedy announced the
Apollo Program in 1962, he galvanized the
nation around a singular ambition to put a
person on the moon by the end of the decade.
The incredibly ambitious mission was an as
tounding success, but achieved far more in in
spiring a new generation of aspiring scien
tists and explorers around the world. We cel
ebrate for many reasons in life for cultur
al holidays, to honor those important to us
and to gloat over beating Cal. But perhaps
there is no greater celebration than one glo
rifying the indomitable resilience of the
human spirit to forever expand its potential
and horizons into the future.

niak will both be on hand to talk about their
life experiences, among many others. Musical
performances range from Les Claypool to
Common. Art installations have names such
as "Raygun Gothic Rocketship" and "The
Serpent Mother," which is actually described
as "A 180'-long, audience-controlled fire
breathing animatronic snake who is protect
ing her egg." Once more for emphasis: you
can control a fire-breathing robot snake half
as long as Hoover Tower is tall.
When President Kennedy announced the
Apollo Program in 1962, he galvanized the
nation around a singular ambition to put a
person on the moon by the end of the decade.
The incredibly ambitious mission was an as
tounding success, but achieved far more in in
spiring a new generation of aspiring scien
tists and explorers around the world. We cel
ebrate for many reasons in life for cultur
al holidays, to honor those important to us
and to gloat over beating Cal. But perhaps
there is no greater celebration than one glo
rifying the indomitable resilience of the
human spirit to forever expand its potential
and horizons into the future.
