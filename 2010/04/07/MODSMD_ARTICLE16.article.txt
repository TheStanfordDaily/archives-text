# OP-ED
## The 						importance of standing up for vegetarianism 
### JANANI BALASUBRAMANIAN '12 
Last quarter, I wrote an op-ed for the
Daily on how being pro-choice and
passive about it did little good to any
one how indeed, this particular crime of
omission on the part of social liberals has en
abled the spread of harmful and misleading
anti-choice rhetoric. I was asking, basically,
that at Stanford, at least, the silent majority
stand up and own their position, for the sake
of social justice.
In this piece, I am attempting the oppo
site: I am asking a minority to own their posi
tion and stop enabling the harmful practices
of the majority. According to estimates from
Stanford Dining, vegetarians make up about
15 percent of the Stanford population, and
vegans an even smaller percentage. We are a
small but diverse group. And we pop up in
unexpected places your computer science
TA, that IHUM kid, your problem set buddy
might be veg*n (vegan or vegetarian) with
out you even knowing it. But why should this
be the case?
Obviously, veg*nism does not create
some sort of "dark mark" ? la Voldemort in
its subscribers, so we tend to pass fairly easi
ly, though occasionally people find us out.
They figure out that our plate is constantly
full of lentils, grains, vegetables, fruits, dress
ings and nuts, but nothing animal-based.
They become curious. They ask why. They
ask about where you get your protein, and
what you'd do in a survival situation and
(gasp) what you eat at Thanksgiving. And too
often, I think, we are overly hasty in changing
the subject. What perfect activist moments
wasted! Here we have peers primed to hear
about how the ills of meat and dairy produc
tion really do affect the planet and their lives.
In other words, they're asking for it. Why not
capitalize on the situation? Let's use those
moments to really push Stanford students to
think critically about a choice they make at
least three times a day.
But goodness, we do not want to offend

anyone. Food is a personal choice, right? Oh,
if only we made our food choices in a vacu
um. Sadly, this is not the case. Food is highly
politicized and manipulated before it reach
es our plates. Food, especially meat, has a
back-story that we usually do not want to
hear one involving factory farming, work
ers' rights abuses and overwhelming envi
ronmental damage. Informing someone
about the benefits of veg*nism does not have
to be an inherently condescending act. Con
sider: if your peers asked you if they should
buy Priuses or Hummers, would you tell
them they should go with the zippier car? If
they asked if they should buy sweatshop or
sweat-free t-shirts, would you tell them to
buy the ones that fit better? Finally, if some
one asked you whether they should eat a
meal that wasted thousands of gallons more

water, acres of rainforest and pounds of car
bon dioxide, while also contributing to immi
grants' and workers' rights abuses on a large
scale, or a meal that did not have such an
alarming impact, what would you say?
I contend that by framing food as a pure
ly personal issue, by divorcing it of the con
text we require for making informed choices,
we do a real disservice to our peers. Factory
farming, slaughterhouse accidents and cli
mate change are not fun subjects to bring up,
but someone has to speak the truth. Whether
you are veg*n or not, knowing the impact of
your food and acting upon that information
is a huge part of being a responsible, global
citizen. And for all you veg*n readers, advo
cacy is then next rational step go for it.
