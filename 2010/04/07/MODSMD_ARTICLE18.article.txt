## DOMINATION Softball trounces Davis 17-0 in five innings 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After a disappointing finish to last week
end's series against Cal, Stanford's Softball
team stormed back yesterday with a 17-0
drubbing of UC-Davis in a mercy rule-short
ened game. The No. 8 Cardinal (28-5,2-1 Pac
-10) will continue conference play this week
end in a three-game series against Oregon
State in Corvallis, Ore.
"We knew we had to come in and play bet
ter defense," said Stanford head coach John
Rittman. "We needed to give ourselves better
at-bats, and we did that. It was a nice bounce
back victory."
After freshman starting pitcher Teagan
Gerhart shut down the Aggie offense in the
top of the first inning, Stanford's offense pre
pared to face Davis starter Dana Waldusky,
who came into the game with a 5-9 season
record.
The Cardinal exploded in that inning, scor
ing a total of 15 runs on the Aggies. Gerhart,
hitting seventh in the order, was also an offen
sive star. In the inning, she had five RBIs, four
of which came on a grand slam the second time
through the order. Her first RBI came on a
double, which scored sophomore right fielder
Maya Burns from second base.
Stanford's other big offensive star of the
first inning was senior catcher Rosey Neill,
who scored twice and had two RBIs on one
hit.
In the inning, the Aggies used three pitch
ers Waldusky, Alex Holmes and Marissa
Araujo. Davis's pitching was not the only
dreadful aspect of its play the Aggie de
fense also played poorly, committing two er
rors, including a critical one by Waldusky in
the first inning.
After the game, Rittman talked about the
Cardinal's first inning outburst.
"We had a lot of hard-hit balls," he said.
"We had a lot of seeing-eye hits, and they
made a few mistakes. When you do that, and
when you give a team like ours outs in an in
ning where they should make plays on the
ball, and they make an error or miscommuni
cate you just open yourself up for a big in
ning like that."
After the first inning finally ended with a
groundout by senior left fielder Alissa Haber
who sparked the rally with a leadoff walk
and scored twice in the inning Stanford re-

placed Gerhart with freshman Jenna Rich,
who moved to the pitcher's mound from short
stop. Rich shut down the Aggies for the rest of
the game. She pitched the final four innings, al
lowing just two hits while striking out two bat
ters. Her win in the game improves her season
record to 2-0.
Rich was a star on offense as well. In the
second inning, Stanford padded its consider
able lead with two more runs, both of which
came on a two-run home run off Rich's bat. In
three at-bats during the game, she had two hits,
three RBIs and three runs scored.
"I was just hoping to contribute in any way,"
Rich said. "They said they wanted me to pitch
a little ... they said they wanted me to throw
off and set the other team off-balance. Offen
sively, my main goal is getting base hits and put
ting the ball in play."
"It was a good win, a mid-week win,"
Rittman said. "It keeps us sharp going up to
Oregon State this weekend."
The Cardinal will open its first conference
series on the road this weekend in Corvallis.
The Beavers (20-16,1-2) are coming off a close
series loss to No. 21 Oregon in their season
opening conference series.
"They are a team that swings the bat really
well," Rittman said. "They score a lot of runs ..
. we're going to have to pitch well and play de
fense, manufacture runs and get timely hits."
For the Cardinal to improve its conference
record, the play of Gerhart and Rich on the
mound will be key. If Stanford's pitching
proves capable of shutting down the Beaver of
fense, the Card has an excellent chance of com
ing away with a series victory.
Rittman, however, refuses to become too
confident.
"We're going to take this season one game
at a time," he said. "It's an awfully long season,
so if we start looking ahead to future games,
it's going to come back to bite us."
Stanford will take on Oregon State in a
three-game series on April 9-11. The first
game, on Friday, will begin at 3 p.m.
