What do Hannibal
Lecter, 18th century
militias and astronauts
have to do with the
Stanford baseball team
scoring runs? If you ask some guys on the
team, they'll tell you their offense would
be nothing without them.
Behind nearly every Cardinal rally
this season are 20 some-odd guys in the
dugout who resemble more a third grade
drama class than a premier collegiate
baseball team.
For as long as any of the players can re
member, Stanford has had a series of rally
starters performed by players on the
bench to help spur some offense.
Rally Hat Guy. Out of all the rallies,
rally hat guy is probably the most visible
—just look for the tall stack of hats pok
ing out from the dugout. Here are the ba
sics: In the sixth inning of most games, the
bench will designate one player to be the
"hat guy."lhe only real qualification to be
the hat guy is lack of height 5-foot-10
sophomore Jack Mosbacher and 5-foot-8
junior Dave Giuliani are perennial fa
vorites.
Once the hat guy is selected, each base
that a Cardinal hitter or base runner ad

the hat guy's head. So let's say Stanford
leads off the inning with a double (2), a
successful sacrifice bunt (1) and an RBI
single (2). All of sudden, Mosbacher has
six hats piled on top of his head.
Rally Militia. While Rally Hat Guy
will be broken out during most games,
Rally Militia is saved for only crucial situ
ations. Down one in the bottom of the
ninth? Tie game in extra innings? Look
for the Stanford dugout to turn into the
Continental Army.
Players will grab spare bats and form
two rows, with the first row kneeling and
the second standing. Before each pitch,
the players —excuse me, soldiers —will
pretend to load an old-time rifle. On the
commander's orders, the ragtag militia
will raise their aluminum bat guns and fire
