# Baseball's rally strategies

What do Hannibal
Lecter, 18th century
militias and astronauts
have to do with the
Stanford baseball team
scoring runs? If you ask some guys on the
team, they'll tell you their offense would
be nothing without them.
Behind nearly every Cardinal rally
this season are 20 some-odd guys in the
dugout who resemble more a third grade
drama class than a premier collegiate
baseball team.
For as long as any of the players can re
member, Stanford has had a series of rally
starters performed by players on the
bench to help spur some offense.
Rally Hat Guy. Out of all the rallies,
rally hat guy is probably the most visible
—just look for the tall stack of hats pok
ing out from the dugout. Here are the ba
sics: In the sixth inning of most games, the
bench will designate one player to be the
"hat guy."lhe only real qualification to be
the hat guy is lack of height 5-foot-10
sophomore Jack Mosbacher and 5-foot-8
junior Dave Giuliani are perennial fa
vorites.
Once the hat guy is selected, each base
that a Cardinal hitter or base runner ad
vances is one more hat added to the top of
the hat guy's head. So let's say Stanford
leads off the inning with a double (2), a
successful sacrifice bunt (1) and an RBI
single (2). All of sudden, Mosbacher has
six hats piled on top of his head.
Rally Militia. While Rally Hat Guy
will be broken out during most games,
Rally Militia is saved for only crucial situ
ations. Down one in the bottom of the
ninth? Tie game in extra innings? Look
for the Stanford dugout to turn into the
Continental Army.
Players will grab spare bats and form
two rows, with the first row kneeling and
the second standing. Before each pitch,
the players —excuse me, soldiers —will
pretend to load an old-time rifle. On the
commander's orders, the ragtag militia
will raise their aluminum bat guns and fire
at the pitcher right as he 's delivering the
pitch.

Rally Hannibal Lecter. Though not as
team-oriented as Rally Militia, Rally
Hannibal Lecter is just as creative. Erik
Davis, the former Stanford ace and cur
rent pitcher in the San Diego Padres' or
ganization, gave the most chilling Antho
ny Hopkins performance. During the
bottom of the fifth inning at home games,
Davis would grab a spare catcher's mask,
a jacket and a rake and head to the end of
the dugout.
He would stand upright with his back
against the rake, put the mask on his head
and wear his jacket backwards, resem
bling a scary old man in a straight jacket.
No one was allowed to talk to Hannibal
until after the inning was over.
Rally Profile. Unlike the previous ral
lies, Rally Profile does not have any defin
itive rules on when it can be used. Think
of it as the utility man of rallies.
Players in the dugout line up in a sin
gle-file line with their shoulders perpen
dicular to the first base line (with only
the profiles of their faces visible to the
pitcher, hence the name). The person at
the front of the line is "up." If anything
bad happens, such as a strike or an out,
that player goes to the end of the line,
and the next person in line is now up. If
something positive happens, such as a
ball or a hit, that player stays at the front
of the line until something negative hap
pens.
Stanford has even more rallies it will
break out from time to time. Rally Space
man involves all the players turning their
jackets inside out, revealing the shiny, fu
turistic inner lining. During Rally Heat
Stroke, which only occurs during the
hottest days of the year, one player puts
on one more jacket every half-inning
until he looks like a (very sweaty) marsh
mallow.
Perhaps the funniest thing about the
rallies is how they seemingly contradict
head coach Mark Marquess' baseball
philosophy. Marquess is a control freak,
regulating every little aspect of players'
lives (they can't have facial hair, for exam
ple), but he is completely fine with letting
his team act like clowns in the dugout.
Players can remember only one time
when the coach shut down a rally. You
probably don't want to know what they
were doing.

ball team as a "rally specialist. "Wish him
luck at mlazarus@stanford.edu.
