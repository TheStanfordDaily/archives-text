# Why Stanford women fell short
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Defense wins championships, we're
told. If that were entirely true, we'd
be discussing two historic upsets
Butler over Duke and Stanford
over Connecticut instead of
searching for reasons for defeat.
Defense is key, but only when it has some help
from its offense. Both the Bulldogs and the Car
dinal received little of the latter in the second half
of their championship games. Both lost in heart
breaking fashion.
While the parallel to the Bulldogs is nice, it's
not our charge. We'll let the Butler Collegian take
that on. Let's look at the reasons for Stanford's
ultimate demise.
It's too easy to say that Connecticut, arguably
the greatest women's basketball team of all time,
was an unstoppable force. Stanford played with
the Huskies for 20 minutes in December and 30
minutes in April, and kept both games close, de
spite self-inflicted wounds. This is not to say that
the two teams should be considered equals; the
Huskies were the unanimous pick to win yester
day. The Cardinal does deserve credit for giving
Connecticut two of its toughest tests over its
lengthy run. But unfortunately, moral victories
do not show up in the box score, nor do they gar
ner trophies. That is not to say that Stanford
should be lambasted for its performance ulti
mately, the season ended as it began, with the
Huskies in the top spot and the Cardinal imme
diately below. But the question is this: the cham
pionship game was entirely winnable, so what
happened?
Two areas of examination: play over the
course of the season and play during the individ
ual contest. First, the road to the Final Four.
If you asked Tara VanDerveer at nearly any
point during the year, she would say that there
were areas where the Cardinal needed constant
improvement. It's hard to say that the No. 2 team
in the country underperformed, but there were
problems that persisted: a lack of a consistent
outside presence, slow starts to begin games, in
juries to Jayne Appel that hampered her produc
tivity and even some trouble finishing near the
basket.
Most of these issues were correctable, but
Stanford was rarely forced to fix them. There is
little, if any, parity in women's basketball. The
Cardinal, an extremely talented, cohesive and
well-coached team, didn't always have to play its
best ball in order to win in dominant fashion.The
Pac-10 was not strong, and even in an intense
out-of-conference schedule, the Cardinal found
success despite struggling in some key areas.
VanDerveer called the team's rebounding per-

formance against Duke, for instance, "an ab
solute F.'"
And so, as Stanford advanced further into the
tournament, and the competition was limited to
the absolute cream of the crop, the heat exposed
year-long weaknesses. The Cardinal shot just 22.2
and 6.7 percent from behind the arc against
Xavier and Oklahoma, respectively, for example,
Stanford would have been lucky to get to over
time against the Musketeers if Dee Dee Jernigan
was able to hit one of her two wide open layup at
tempts, and the Cardinal would have been in se
rious trouble against the Sooners if not for Nneka
Ogwumike's all-time excellent performance.
By the time the championship game came
around, the problems were there to see. First, the
positives: defensively, it was an excellent per
formance, and frankly, better than the Huskies'.
Stanford had trouble finishing good takes; Con
necticut had trouble finishing tough takes. Every
shot was challenged, particularly in the first half,
and it wasn't until Maya Moore decided that
she'd show everyone why she's the best in the na
tion that the Huskies were able to do a terrible
amount in the paint.
But offensively, it was abysmal, and the rea
sons were apparent. The common factors were
there: close shots were not finished, the midrange
game was severely lacking and while Jeanette
Pohlen found a semblance of a stroke from be
hind the arc in the first half, she, like the rest of her
Stanford teammates, did not find similar success
in the final 20 minutes. Appel tried, heroically, to
play through the pain of injuries that have de
creased her productivity all year, but ultimately,
they took their toll, and one of Stanford's all-time
post players finished her career 0-12 from the
field. The Cardinal started slow, but unlike many
of its other contests, it did not follow that up with
an impressive second half.
Connecticut, meanwhile, was not suffocating.
Many of the baskets were there for the taking.
But ultimately, the usual issues surfaced which,
combined with below-average shooting days
from Ogwumike and Kayla Pedersen, who have
been a collective rock all season, doomed Stan
ford.
This is all to say: in a game that was ugly for
both teams, the Cardinal had its chances. But
when prior problems aren't remedied, the top
team in the land even on an off day is going
to exploit them.

Wyndam Makowsky is really going out on a limb
to say that 26.5 percent shooting doomed Stan
ford. Learn why not scoring hurts your chances
