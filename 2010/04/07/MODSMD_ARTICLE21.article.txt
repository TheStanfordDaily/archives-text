"Over the years, the U.S. Intercollegiate
has become one of the top West Coast col
lege events," Stanford head coach Conrad
Ray told GoStanford.com. "The Stanford
Golf Course stands up to par, and the weath
er forecast looks good, so we should have a
fantastic competition."
"With the majority of the Pac-10 Confer
ence in attendance, the level of play will be
very high," Ray added. "Our guys really look
forward to playing well at home because
there is a lot of local knowledge about play
ing Stanford well, so I hope we can execute
our plan properly. We are also excited about
the Reno-Tahoe Open exemption. It is the
first for our event, and a really neat thing for
college golf in general."
Washington won last year's event with a
36-under team score of 804. The Cardinal
placed fourth last year with an 11-under 829.
Stanford has won the event 12 times since
the inaugural tournament in 1968.
The last Stanford golfer to win the indi

medalist honors in 2006 and 2007.
Stanford will look to get back on track on
its home course this weekend at the U.S. In
