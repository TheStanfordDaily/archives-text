## Cardinal readies for Big Meet 
### ANARGHYA VARDHAN A SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ultimate track and field showdown is a
few days away, as the Cardinal and the Golden
Bears prepare to fight it out at the annual Big
Meet. With Cal hosting this year's meet, the
Stanford track and field team will travel to the
East Bay to compete for Bay Area bragging
rights, a school title and an opportunity to post
some top marks and potentially qualify for
nationals.
Several Stanford athletes enter the meet

with top national ranks. Sophomore Amaechi
Morton currently sits at the 13th position in the
nation in the 400-meter dash with his time of
46.66 seconds. This weekend, Morton looks to
compete in the 110 hurdles and the 400 hurdles.
While the main focus of the meet is to beat Cal,
the Stanford athletes will also look to win indi
vidual event titles and achieve top performanc
es along the way.

"Individually I want to improve on my time
in the 110 hurdles while snagging a win," Mor
ton said.' Also, I would like to defend my title in
the 400 hurdles, run a nice opener and break the

Big Meet record."
"My goals are to execute great races, while
scoring my team as many points as possible," he
added.
Several other men are also ranked early in
the season. Sophomore Dylan Ferris is ranked
seventh in the 800 meters with a time of 1:48.72.
Sophomore Brendan Gregg occupies the 10th
position in the 10,000 meters with a time of
28:56.44. In the field events, sophomore Geof
frey Tabor is ranked 10th in the discus throw
with a toss of 184-10.
On the women's side, sophomore
Georgia Griffin is ranked 11th in the
10,000 meters with a time 0f33:39.52. In
a three-way tie for third in the pole vault
is sophomore Katerina Stefanidi, with a
mark of 14-1.25. In the triple jump, jun
ior Whitney Liehr sits at 12th place with
a leap of 42-2.
Looking to be ranked, and yearning
to improve her Stanford Invite winning
mark in the long jump is freshman
Karynn Dunn. This weekend, Dunn
will compete in the 100 hurdles, long
jump, triple jump and 4x400 relay.
"I plan on getting better by working
on specific things while I am at practice
and just trusting in myself and my
coach," Dunn said. "My goals for out
door season are to make it to NCAAs
and to have a personal record in the
long jump, triple jump, 100 hurdles and
my 4x400 relay split."
Indeed, this weekend will provide
Dunn the opportunity to start working
on her goals, while establishing Cardi
nal dominance in the Bay.
Although Big Meet is not at home
this year, the team encourages fans and
supporters to come to Berkeley to at
tend the meet. Field events commence
at 10:30 a.m., while running events
begin at 1 p.m. The meet is scheduled to
end around 5 p.m., closing with the ex

ent meets, with the next home meet
being the Payton Jordan Invitational on
May 1.
