## E-mails for grads off, say admins 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
A promised shift in policy that
would have allowed Stanford alumni
to retain their "@stanford.edu" e
mail addresses indefinitely after
graduation appears to have been sig
nificantly reversed, with alumni now
only retaining their e-mails for a
short time after graduation.
Administrators and ASSU Presi
dent David Gobaud, a coterminal
student in computer science, first an
nounced the shift in October.
Many members of the Class of
2009 received an e-mail Tuesday from
Bill Clebsch, the associate vice presi
dent for IT Services (ITS), detailing
the reversal.
"Recently you were told that
Stanford would allow you to forward
e-mail from your '@stanford.edu' ac
count indefinitely after graduation,"
a portion of the e-mail read. "After
further investigation, we have real
ized that this will create significant
complications, and we have come to
the unhappy conclusion that we can
not provide this service."
Instead, according to the e-mail,
recent graduates' "@stanford.edu e
mail account and other full SUNetID
services will remain active in their
present form until August 31,2011."
Clebsch and Michael Dimaano,
an ITS associate, did not immediate
ly return requests for comment. Gob

aud said Tuesday that he was sur
prised by the announcement and
hoped to hear from either University
President John Hennessy or Provost
John Etchemendy, whom he contact
ed yesterday about the issue.
In a partial replacement of the
original promise, the announcement
also said the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation "plans to provide an e-mail
service with an '@alumni.
stanford.edu' address by that date.
The Stanford Alumni Association
has been providing permanent e
mail addresses to alumni since the
19905."

While the "@alumni.Stanford

edu" address would presumably not
mark the end of "@stanfordalumni
.org" addresses, they would still mark
a change from students' existing e
mail addresses.
An early indication of trouble
with the change came in March,
when members of the Class of 2009
received an unexpected notice that
their account would soon expire.
At the time, Gobaud wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily that, in response
to concerned e-mails from graduates,
"we told everyone that nothing has
changed since the announcement
that was made in [the] fall."
Speaking to The Daily last month,
Dimaano had also said that he did
not expect changes to the announced
shift.
"A lot of students sent the help re
quest about it, but right now we
haven't heard back from the SUNet
ID-for-life project team about what
they're going to do," Dimaano said.
"We are pretty positive that they'll be
able to resolve that issue. We just
don't know what steps they are going
to take to do so."
In October, Clebsch wrote in an e
mail to The Daily that the original
shift in policy was "the right thing to
do."
"Keeping our faculty, students
and alums in contact and collabora
tion is a major goal for us," Clebsch
said.
