# Foreign students win insurance choice
## 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS MANAGING EDITOR 
International students now have the op
tion to waive Stanford's Cardinal Care
health insurance policy, Vaden Health Cen
ter announced Monday, detailing a process
for exceptions on its Web site.
Vaden backpedaled on the compulsory
care requirement for international students
announced in February after students cried
foul at the mandate, calling it "discriminato
ry" and mounting an aggressive lobbying ef
fort to get Vaden to consider allowing excep-

tions. Stanford's changes to insurance rules
in February obligated international students
to purchase the University's annual $3,000
care package, regardless of the quality of
students' existing foreign coverage plans.
Domestic students retained the option to
waive Cardinal Care.
"This is more about seeing the policy as
discriminatory, less than about the practical
reasoning behind it," said Addy Satija, a
doctoral student in electrical engineering
and energy resources engineering who has
been involved in negotiations with Vaden. "I
think we've taken care of the practicality

part."
Currently, Cardinal Care covers about 80
percent of Stanford's approximately 3,200
international students.
Under the revised policy, international
students may now opt to keep their person
al insurance plans by asking their insurance
company to complete a form and submit it
to Vaden's insurance office for review. If a
plan's benefits meet criteria Stanford put
forth on Monday, a student is expected to re
ceive a waiver.
For international coverage plans to meet
the University's guidelines, they must have

an annual deductible less than $l,OOO, pro
vide for inpatient and outpatient medical
and mental health care in the San Francisco
Bay Area and the United States, cover pre
scription costs and include emergency visits
and non-emergency care.
Health care policies are also required to
have a lifetime aggregate maximum benefit
of $2 million or a maximum per-condition,
per-lifetime benefit of $500,000 and must
cover pre-existing conditions or satisfy a
waiting period requirement.
"With the exemption policy that
we achieved, we now made sure
that those who have adequate
health insurance from their home
country or are in any other arrange
ment will continue to be able to
benefit from this," said Fabian Sahl,
a graduate student in international
policy studies who was at the helm
of a campaign to negotiate an ex
ception policy with Vaden.
Ira Friedman, the director of
Vaden Flealth Center, met with
members of the international stu
dent community and Bechtel In
ternational Center to discuss an ex
emption plan.
"The students spent a lot of time
organizing their thoughts into giv
ing us some very specific sugges
tions," Friedman said. "I thought it
was a very cooperative, collabora
tive process that we engaged in,
and the result is a good one."
Vaden currently uses an auto
mated form on Axess to waive Car
dinal Care coverage for domestic
students, and Friedman had initial
ly hoped to institute a similar
process for international care
packages to reduce administrative
overhead. However, the new case
by-case exemption policy that stu
dents pushed for has made online
spot-checking impossible and must
be done manually, he said.
"The administrative tasks for us
are definitely growing, and now
we've got this added feature of an
alyzing these requests for excep
tions, so we may end up needing to
add staff," he said. "We're trying to
balance the added benefits of the
case-by-case exceptions with the

added cost and time."
Friedman estimated that 70 to
75 percent of undergraduates from
the United States who number
6,390 currently waive Cardinal
Care coverage. Among domestic
graduate students, about a quarter
waive the University's health cov
erage, Friedman said.
But there are still concerns from
many quarters of the international
community that Vaden's exemp
tion requirements are too stringent
and will default many students into
Cardinal Care because their poli
cies cannot meet the test.
Andreas Zoellner, a first-year
graduate student in aeronautics
and astronautics, said that while
the new exemption policy is a
major victory for international stu
dents, the policy is not perfect.
"Some people I spoke to still
don't like the fact that one has to
have mental health coverage, as
they feel that this is less important
for them than, e.g., coverage for
dental or vision or a better cover
age when traveling abroad," Zoell
ner said. "On the other hand, it be
came clear to me that underinsur
ance of international students for
mental health was a particular con
cern of Vaden, and they therefore
didn't relax that requirement."
He said talks with Vaden will be
ongoing to iron out any kinks in the
updated care plan exceptions.
"One important point we made
is that this new policy has to be
monitored to make sure that it re
ally addresses the problems that
existed in the past with under-in
sured international students with
out burdening the students too
much," Zoellner said. "And Vaden
agreed to do that."
