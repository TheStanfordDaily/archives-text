# Foreign students win insurance choice
## 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS MANAGING EDITOR 
International students now have the op
tion to waive Stanford's Cardinal Care
health insurance policy, Vaden Health Cen
ter announced Monday, detailing a process
for exceptions on its Web site.
Vaden backpedaled on the compulsory
care requirement for international students
announced in February after students cried
foul at the mandate, calling it "discriminato
ry" and mounting an aggressive lobbying ef
fort to get Vaden to consider allowing excep-

tions. Stanford's changes to insurance rules
in February obligated international students
to purchase the University's annual $3,000
care package, regardless of the quality of
students' existing foreign coverage plans.
Domestic students retained the option to
waive Cardinal Care.
"This is more about seeing the policy as
discriminatory, less than about the practical
reasoning behind it," said Addy Satija, a
doctoral student in electrical engineering
and energy resources engineering who has
been involved in negotiations with Vaden. "I
think we've taken care of the practicality

part."
Currently, Cardinal Care covers about 80
percent of Stanford's approximately 3,200
international students.
Under the revised policy, international
students may now opt to keep their person
al insurance plans by asking their insurance
company to complete a form and submit it
to Vaden's insurance office for review. If a
plan's benefits meet criteria Stanford put
forth on Monday, a student is expected to re
ceive a waiver.
For international coverage plans to meet
the University's guidelines, they must have

an annual deductible less than $l,OOO, pro
vide for inpatient and outpatient medical
and mental health care in the San Francisco
Bay Area and the United States, cover pre
scription costs and include emergency visits
and non-emergency care.
Health care policies are also required to
have a lifetime aggregate maximum benefit
of $2 million or a maximum per-condition,
per-lifetime benefit of $500,000 and must
cover pre-existing conditions or satisfy a
waiting period requirement.
