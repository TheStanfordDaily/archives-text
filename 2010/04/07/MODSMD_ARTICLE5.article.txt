## CARD UNABLE TO HOLD LEAD, FALLS IN TITLE GAME 
### TOM TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Last night, Connecticut sealed a per
fect two years with a 53-47 victory over
Stanford in the national championship
game at the Alamodome in San Antonio,
Tex.
The Cardinal (36-2,18-0 Pac-10) led
by eight points at the half to hold the
Huskies (39-0, 16-0 Big East) to their
biggest deficit in their entire undefeated
run, but UConn's junior forward Maya
Moore hit her stride in the second half to
take the title.
Stanford won the tip-off, but neither
team could make a basket in the first

minute, taking poor shots that marred
most of the first half. When sophomore
guard Tiffany Hayes opened a 5-0 lead, it
looked a little ominous for the Card, but
Stanford then went on a 12-0 run as Con
necticut missed 18 straight shots to stay
scoreless for 10 minutes. The Cardinal
held on to lead 20-12 at halftime.
It was a bad performance by UConn,
and could well have cost it the title if the
Cardinal women had managed to fully
capitalize on their opponent's failings.
Finishing the half with a 25.8 shooting
percentage from the field, Stanford was
barely more accurate than its opponents,
who shot 17.2 percent.
Defensively, Connecticut pressured

the Card deep into the backcourt right
from the start, and had success in keeping
its opponent from penetrating into the
paint. Stanford meanwhile gave its oppo
sition more room to run, but succeeded
in frustrating it nonetheless, as senior
center Jayne Appel blocked out UConn
senior center Tina Charles, leading the
Cardinal to succeed on the glass.
As history repeated itself from De
cember, when Stanford had led at the
half only to lose out by the final buzzer in
Storrs, Conn., the Huskies came back
strongly in the second period. In the first
eight minutes, they outscored the Card

Senior Jayne Appel and the Stanford women's basketball team nearly pulled off an upset against undefeated UConn in
yesterday's national title game, but succumbed to a furious Connecticut rally in the second half.
eight minutes, they outscored the Card
17-2 to reverse the gap, with Wade Tro
phy winner Moore personally hitting 11
of those points.
In comparison, the Cardinal strug
gled to improve as its big players be
came marginalized. Appel was strug
gling with the sprained ankle that has
plagued her since the beginning of
March, and when she turned it again
under the Stanford basket, her team

was effectively left without one of the
best players ever to wear Cardinal red.
Looking anxious from the sidelines, she
managed to return, but clearly was not
fully fit, and none of her 12 attempts on
basket hit home.

Without Appel's presence on court,
fellow Ail-American sophomore for
ward Nnemkadi Ogwumike could not
escape from the attentions of the
UConn defense, which time after time
doubled up on her to block shots that
have fallen true all year long.
The game looked over as the fa
vored Huskies pulled away to a 16-
point lead with just two and a half min
utes remaining, but three straight three

pointers by junior forward Kayla Ped
ersen and junior guard Jeanette Pohlen
suddenly opened a glimmer of a chance
for Stanford. Taking a gamble, head
coach Tara VanDerveer told her team
to foul UConn to risk the damage from
free throws but get the ball back and
keep time on the clock, but the Huskies
were much improved from the charity
stripe and hit enough to seal the win.
At guard, Pac-10 co-Defender of the
Year and redshirt senior Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude played just 11 minutes, with
redshirt junior guards Melanie Murphy
and JJ Hones, who have both struggled
with injuries all year long, seeing game
time in her place. The Cardinal could

have done with the defensive, and of
fensive, presence that Gold-Onwude
showed throughout the Pac-10 season.
In the end, though, UConn de
servedly became the first team in
women's college basketball to go two
entire seasons undefeated, running its
record win streak to 78 games.
"People said, 'How are you going to
react the first time you're in a close
game?"' said Connecticut head coach
Geno Auriemma. "Well, we reacted the
way champions do."
For now, the season is over, and the
last ball has been played. Appel and
Gold-Onwude have completed their
collegiate careers, and five UConn

players will graduate in June,
But the rivalry does not end here.
The Huskies will head to California to
play at Maples in December, where,
even with the substantial personnel
changes forced by the absence of this
year's seniors, both teams should still be
national powers.
Moore returns in her final year for
Connecticut, and so do Stanford
starters Ogwumike, Pedersen and
Pohlen, who all hit double figures in
points in the final, with Ogwumike and
Pedersen making double-doubles.
