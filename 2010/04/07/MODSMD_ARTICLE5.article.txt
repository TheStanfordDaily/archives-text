## CARD UNABLE TO HOLD LEAD, FALLS IN TITLE GAME 
### TOM TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Last night, Connecticut sealed a per
fect two years with a 53-47 victory over
Stanford in the national championship
game at the Alamodome in San Antonio,
Tex.
The Cardinal (36-2,18-0 Pac-10) led
by eight points at the half to hold the
Huskies (39-0, 16-0 Big East) to their
biggest deficit in their entire undefeated
run, but UConn's junior forward Maya
Moore hit her stride in the second half to
take the title.
Stanford won the tip-off, but neither
team could make a basket in the first

minute, taking poor shots that marred
most of the first half. When sophomore
guard Tiffany Hayes opened a 5-0 lead, it
looked a little ominous for the Card, but
Stanford then went on a 12-0 run as Con
necticut missed 18 straight shots to stay
scoreless for 10 minutes. The Cardinal
held on to lead 20-12 at halftime.
It was a bad performance by UConn,
and could well have cost it the title if the
Cardinal women had managed to fully
capitalize on their opponent's failings.
Finishing the half with a 25.8 shooting
percentage from the field, Stanford was
barely more accurate than its opponents,
who shot 17.2 percent.
Defensively, Connecticut pressured

the Card deep into the backcourt right
from the start, and had success in keeping
its opponent from penetrating into the
paint. Stanford meanwhile gave its oppo
sition more room to run, but succeeded
in frustrating it nonetheless, as senior
center Jayne Appel blocked out UConn
senior center Tina Charles, leading the
Cardinal to succeed on the glass.
As history repeated itself from De
cember, when Stanford had led at the
half only to lose out by the final buzzer in
Storrs, Conn., the Huskies came back
strongly in the second period. In the first
eight minutes, they outscored the Card
