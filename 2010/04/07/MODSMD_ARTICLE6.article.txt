## Special fees to drop slightly? McLaughlin: If all groups win this weekend, fee per quarter would he $116 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a painstaking year for the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate Appropriations Committee, student groups and financial
officers, their financial woes could be nearing an end.
That was the word from Matt McLaughlin, the ASSU finan
cial manager, at the Senate meeting Tuesday, where he said
based on preliminary calculations, special fees for students next
year could drop to $ll6 per quarter from $ll9 if all special fee
groups are approved on the ballot April 8 and 9.
Appropriations Chair Anton Zietsman 'l2 said the project
ed reduction would be a success for the committee, students and
groups alike, suggesting that with slightly lower special fees, re
quests for refunds could be expected to decrease. With fewer re
funds, Zietsman said, valuable dollars requested by special fees
groups would be better safeguarded.
Lower special fees and a reduced refund rate would mark
progress on two goals Appropriations Committee members set
out to fulfill but the full impact of a $3 per quarter drop in
special fees remains to be seen.
"It's not a long term solution,but it worked in the short run,"
McLaughlin said of this year's Appropriations initiatives.
McLaughlin said this quarter's refund rate is projected to be
lower than the previous two quarters this year; however, until
the filing for refund closes at the end of this week, it remains too
soon to tell exactly what those numbers will be.
"Even if [the refund rate] stabilizes, I'm willing to call that a
success, given the fact that there were predicted to be over twen
ty percent for spring quarter," Zietsman said. "So, I think that
we've accomplished what we set out to do this year."
According to McLaughlin, the refund rate for the past two
quarters significantly exceeded the buffer fund initially formed
to buoy groups hit hard by refund requests.
Last quarter, the amount refunded reached $115,000, while
the buffer fund is only equipped to shell out $70,000 per quar
ter. The projected dip in refund requests could be attributed to
the shortened time allotted to file requests, which was cut from
three weeks earlier this year.
As of last night, refund requests for undergraduates rested at
$77,000, a significant decrease from last quarter.
In an interview with The Daily, Zietsman argued that criti
cism about Appropriations is too "near-sighted" an approach to
the funding process.
"Groups are better off by us appropriating less and decreas
ing the refund rate than by appropriating more and having the
refund rate increase," he said.
Although the Appropriations
Committee has been under fire in the
past months as it made funding rec
ommendations at rates called too low
by some student groups 33 percent
in fall and winter quarters the rate
has continued to increase and now sits
at 48 percent, while the body remains

under budget.
McLaughlin also revealed a plan
for SSE Labs, a project that would
provide free office space to student
entrepreneurs through the summer to
relieve those students of added finan
cial burden. Spots would be reserved
for entrepreneurial students to devel
op Internet-based applications and be
funded by outside donors. McLaugh
lin will meet with administrators
today to pitch the idea.
In response to pressure from the
Graduate Student Council (GSC) for

equal representation in joint special
fees meetings, former GSC parlia
mentarian Robert Hennessy and
Funding Committee Chair Ping Li,
are drafting legislation to set equal
voting procedures for the two bodies
and alternating chairs for these meet
ings. Senators Zietsman and Katz are
sponsoring the legislation.
All funding bills were unanimous
ly passed at last night's meeting.
