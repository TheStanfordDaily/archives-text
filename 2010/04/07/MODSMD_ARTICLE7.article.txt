# STUDENT GOV'T
## Exec candidates spar as vote nears Student government campaigns wear on, but draw CoHo crowd 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Tuesday night's ASSU executive de
bate, conceived as a civil discourse be
tween the six executive slates, quickly spi
raled downward into a moderated shout
ing match where substantive comments
mixed with crowd-riling techniques and
pointed attacks.
The debate, held in the CoHo and co
sponsored by Stanford in Government,

The Stanford Review and The Stanford
Daily, featured all six executive slates:
Katherine Heflin 'll and Daniel Liefer'lo,
juniors Thom Scher and Stephanie Wern
er, doctoral students in chemical engineer
ing Ryan Peacock and Jonathan Bakke,
juniors Austin Guzman and Patrick Ma
honey, Angelina Cardona 'll and Kelsei
Wharton 'l2, and Billy Kemper 'll and
Josh Meisel 'l2. Stanford Review news ed
itor Tom Corrigan 'll and Stanford Daily
president and editor in chief Kamil Dada
'll moderated the debate.
The candidates answered slate-by-slate
questions about issues ranging from exec
utive-legislative relations to plans for ex
ecutive cabinet before the discourse

turned to rants against Stanford Housing,
promises of student government trans
parency and discussion of grant funding
for student organizations.
While the debate did cover some key
topics of the campaign, including account
ability and wellness, the conversation was
often marred by technical difficulties with
microphones and disturbances from can
didates themselves. Kemper and Meisel,
the Stanford Chaparral slate, began the
night with humorous additions to the de
bate, but after a few questions and a few
beers, turned to rowdy antics that elicited
both cheers and boos from the crowd.
