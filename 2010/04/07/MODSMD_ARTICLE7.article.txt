# STUDENT GOV'T
## Exec candidates spar as vote nears Student government campaigns wear on, but draw CoHo crowd 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Tuesday night's ASSU executive de
bate, conceived as a civil discourse be
tween the six executive slates, quickly spi
raled downward into a moderated shout
ing match where substantive comments
mixed with crowd-riling techniques and
pointed attacks.
The debate, held in the CoHo and co
sponsored by Stanford in Government,

The Stanford Review and The Stanford
Daily, featured all six executive slates:
Katherine Heflin 'll and Daniel Liefer'lo,
juniors Thom Scher and Stephanie Wern
er, doctoral students in chemical engineer
ing Ryan Peacock and Jonathan Bakke,
juniors Austin Guzman and Patrick Ma
honey, Angelina Cardona 'll and Kelsei
Wharton 'l2, and Billy Kemper 'll and
Josh Meisel 'l2. Stanford Review news ed
itor Tom Corrigan 'll and Stanford Daily
president and editor in chief Kamil Dada
'll moderated the debate.
The candidates answered slate-by-slate
questions about issues ranging from exec
utive-legislative relations to plans for ex
ecutive cabinet before the discourse

turned to rants against Stanford Housing,
promises of student government trans
parency and discussion of grant funding
for student organizations.
While the debate did cover some key
topics of the campaign, including account
ability and wellness, the conversation was
often marred by technical difficulties with
microphones and disturbances from can
didates themselves. Kemper and Meisel,
the Stanford Chaparral slate, began the
night with humorous additions to the de
bate, but after a few questions and a few
beers, turned to rowdy antics that elicited
both cheers and boos from the crowd.

Daniel Leifer '10, far right, makes his case for ASSU executive. Candidates for the top two student
government spots went head-on Tuesday in a rowdy debate at the CoHo. Voting starts tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the No-Rain Cam
paign slate, Heflin and Leifer, empha
sized key points of their platform.
Leifer, who called their candidacy "an
opportunity to have a slate about is
sues," also mentioned the slate's plans
for an executive-organized dispersal
of textbook ISBNs, to which an audi
ence member responded, "That's a
bad idea."
Peacock and Bakke, both high
lighting hopes of ASSU restructuring
and improving relationships with
University administration, consis
tently pointed to their relatively ma
ture approach to the executive's role.
Peacock, who serves on the Graduate
Student Council (GSC), described it
as having a "healthier relationship"
with the executive than the Under
graduate Senate,
"I've never seen an executive
mandate work," Peacock said. "You
can't just go to a legislative body and
tell them,' This needs to happen.'"
In addition to discussion of the
legislative process, many slates also
put forward specific policy recom
mendations. Scher for example, men
tioned potential reform of residential
parking permits.
"Why can I not drive my car from
Lag to Wilbur in the middle of the
day?," Scher asked.
Several slates referred to the for
mation of Green Alliance for Innova
tive Action (GAIA) as an example of
the executive's successful work as co
ordinator of student initiatives.
Cardona, a resident assistant in
Trancos whose statements were met
with loud cheers from her residents,
addressed the details of the Cardona-
Wharton platform, but also defended
the Wellness Room, which she helped
organize.
In one of his answers, Mahoney
criticized the ASSU for focusing on
what he considered the wrong areas,
saying the organization should in
stead focus on preventing laptop theft
and reforming the housing process.
"These are the things that we see
as facing the student body in signifi
cant ways that are probably more im
portant than whether the Wellness
Room has enough plastic bubbles,"
he said, to which the audience re
sponded with some boos.
Cardona, in a later response, ad
dressed the Wellness Room and con-

troversy surrounding its cost and effi
cacy by emphasizing that the project
was the result of large-scale collabo
ration and is still in the process of
transitioning to a wellness project led
by student groups.
"Everyone has a different opin
ion, some good, some bad," she said.
"At the end of the day, though, there's
a stronger presence of wellness on
our campus, and I think that should
count for a lot."
Later, in response to Mahoney's
repeated calls for "unionization" of
ASSU and critiques of campus hous
ing, underage drinking law enforce
ment and laptop theft, Cardona
joked, "Does anyone in this room
have an extra laptop that we can do
nate to Mahoney?"

The debate continued with ques
tions from the audience, including
one to Scher and Werner about their
decision to cancel their endorsement
interview with The Daily's editorial
board. Scher reiterated the slate's
concern regarding the former affilia
tion of one of the editorial board
members with the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC), another endors
ing group.

Although Mahoney thanked the
Chaparral slate earlier in the night for
participating, saying, "This would be
really dry and boring without them,"
by the time the debate was drawing to
a close, the tone on the stage was visi
bly tense. In response to an audience
member shouting, "Can you not talk
anymore?" Meisel said, "I'd like to
see you get up here and make funny
jokes," prompting audience members
to shout at the moderators to quiet
down the pair.
By this time, Kemper and Meisel
had repeatedly walked off the stage,
spilled beer and called for "more pe
tite Asian girls," a two-person cabinet,
discretionary funds to "buy better
athletes" and a weeklong Admit
Weekend. The slate's final remarks
were cut short when Kemper's micro
phone was turned off mid-sentence as
he proclaimed, "I am the tannest m
