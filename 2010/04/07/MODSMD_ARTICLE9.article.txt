With thousands of bikers on
campus, it's easy to forget
another, less-prominent fac
tion of wheeled transporta
tion longboards.
"I don't know how to ride a bike," admit
ted longboarder Dean Schaffer 'lO. "I think I
knew when I was younger, so people who say
you can't forget how to ride a bike are
wrong."
Longboarding, a variety of skateboarding
also known as "sidewalk surfing," makes for
an appealing alternative to walking and bik
ing around campus. Although biking is by far
students' most popular choice for transporta
tion, longboarding has its upsides.
"When you're riding a bike, getting from
point A to point B is the point," explained
Martha Jensen Smith 'lO. "When you're riding
a longboard, the point is to enjoy your sur
roundings."
The coolness vibe doesn't hurt either.
"When I first got a longboard, I was really
happy because it filled a niche in my life,"
Schaffer laughed. "I thought it would make
me cooler ... but it hasn't done that."
Smith agreed that there is something to be
said for projecting the image of a hip, flip-flop
wearing, West Coast surfer.
"I do think that longboarding is something
that's growing in popularity," Smith said.
"People who are from the East Coast and
51 percent of people at Stanford are from out
of state are like, I'm moving to California,
and I want to pick up this California vibe."
Smith is a longboarding veteran who
picked up skateboarding in her hometown of
San Diego, Calif., but Schaffer only recently
adopted longboarding. For the first year and a
half of college, Schaffer had neither a bike nor
a board, but then his girlfriend bought him a
used longboard a smart decision, consider
ing new boards can cost several hundred dol
lars.
"I learned slowly and painfully, and I'm
still learning a lot," Schaffer said. "I'm not
very good at it. It gets me where I need to go,
but I don't do anything exciting on it."
Not that there are scores of tricks to do on
a longboard. Compared to skateboards, which

are shorter and more conducive to stunts,
longboards are difficult to turn and less
maneuverable. Longboarding can also be a
dangerous mode of transportation, especially
on such a bike-dominated campus as
Stanford.
"I tend to walk through the Intersection oi
Death because it's so crazy," Schaffer said.
"Bikers have a much more fine ability to con
trol their speed with brakes, and even then
they crash all the time."
Mark Frykman 'll offered up a story of his
worst longboarding accident. While boarding
to his machine shop class with two glass bot
tles in one hand and a package in the other, he
hit a pinecone not necessarily an obstruc
tion to bicycles and fell to the ground near
Florence Moore (FloMo) field. The bottles
shattered and sliced his hand open.
"The funny part is that it was the day that
[Resident Assistant (RA)] interviews were
going on at FloMo Field for West Flo,"
Frykman said. "I fell, and immediately
when I stood up, I was surrounded by
12 or 13 wannabe RAs trying to
impress their interviewers."
Yet, safety isn't too much of a
concern for longboarders. When
asked whether they wear helmets,
Frykman, Alden Timme 'll and
Quynh Phan 'lO all laughed with a
definitive "No."
"Once I'm a grad student, maybe I'll
start wearing a helmet," Frykman joked.
For now, Phan stays safe by avoiding
certain places, like the area around the
Claw, the new Coupa Cafe and the
pavement around Memorial Fountain. A
She doesn't know what she'll do
after graduating, though, especially
if she moves to a city.
"On campus, it's pretty easy to
get' around on a board, but once
you move to real life it might be a
little difficult," Phan said. "Like San
Francisco ... wouldn't that suck?"
'Smith; who will graduate in June and
movfe to Newark, NJ'for Teach for America, is
facing a similar '■< :
"I'm going to bring my board anyway," she
said. "We'll see-how many weird looks I get.".
