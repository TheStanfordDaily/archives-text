dammed if we don't
Join your neighbors at Patagonia's Palo Alto store for a slide show presentation from Beyond Searsville
Dam Coalition and special guests, plus refreshments, product giveaways and music from local bluegrass
band Windy Hill.
Built 120 years ago, Stanford's Searsville Dam no longer serves a critical need - and blocks annual runs
of steelhead trout from reaching their spawning grounds. Removing it will revive submerged wetlands
and provide natural flood protection benefits - as well as help restore steelhead.
