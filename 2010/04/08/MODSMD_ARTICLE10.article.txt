## On to the next one: Going to grad school 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
For high school students, the three
months between pressing the gut
wrenching "submit" button on college
applications and receiving admissions
decisions is a nerve-wracking, but fair
ly lax waiting period. But for college seniors
applying to graduate or professional schools,
the research, application and decision-making
process is intensely hands-on and drawn-out.
"I sent in the first part of my application last
June, and it's still not over," said Emmanuelle
Benkoski 'lO, who started filling out medical
school applications at the end of her junior
year and has yet to choose between her top two
schools, Boston University and Tufts Universi
ty-
Because of the multitude of prerequisite
classes and extracurricular activities expected
of med school applicants, students often have
to begin the preparation process in the fall or
winter of their freshman year. Benkoski, along
with other medically minded undergraduates
undeterred by the organic chemistry series,
spent a significant part of her junior year study
ing for the Medical College Admission Test
(MCAT) the MCAT Web site recommends
beginning to study at least three months in ad
vance of the planned test date and moved
onto formal applications the following sum
mer.
Law school is also a popular option after
Stanford. Although academic preparation for
law school is generally less rigorous than that
for medical school most law schools admit
students from a wide range of undergraduate
majors the application process itself is
equally demanding.
Mohammad Ali 'lO, a coterminal student in
sociology who majored in international rela
tions as an undergraduate, called applying for
law school a "horrendous process" dominated
by a personal statement that took four months
to perfect, the search for professors who could
write the best letters of recommendation and

the bureaucracy of transcript requests. Like
Benkoski, Ali started his applications in June
and didn't submit the last one until November.
Ali plans to attend UC-Berkeley's Boalt
Hall School of Law next year, unless he is ac
cepted at Stanford, which he has yet to hear
from, or gets in off the waitlist at either Colum
bia University or the University of Chicago.
"I applied only to top-10 schools that
was my basic criterion," Ali said. "I'm going to
go to the best school I get into, and right now
that's Berkeley."
According to Law School Admission Coun
cil statistics, 82 percent of Stanford students
who applied to law school last year were ac
cepted into one or more schools, including
Stanford, Harvard, Georgetown, Columbia
and UC-Berkeley.
However, the number of Stanford students
applying to law school has dropped significant
ly in past years, from 318 applicants in 2007 to
268 in 2009. Kathryn Wright, the primary pre
law advisor at Undergraduate Academics and
Research (UAR), suggested that this might be
a symptom of the recessed economy.
"Usually in an economic downturn, appli
cations to law school increase," Wright wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "In this recession, how
ever, Stanford students seem to be more cau
tious."
The decision to continue on to graduate or
professional school can be made at many
points during a student's education, from
freshmen who come to Stanford determined to
be doctors, to science or humanities majors
who decide mid-way through junior year that
graduate school is the place to be.
But at Stanford, it seems that many of the
students who go on to earn various higher de
grees begin their undergraduate careers know
ing that it will not be the final step in their edu
cation.
"I wasn't sure how far I wanted to go [mas
ter's degree or Ph.D.], but I knew I wanted to
go to grad school long before I got to Stan
ford," wrote Taylor Cone 'lO in an e-mail to The
Daily. Cone will continue next year at Stanford

as a coterminal student of mechanical engi
neering.
The coterminal degree program at Stanford
allows students to begin work on a master's de
gree while still finishing their bachelor's de
gree. A far cry from the intensive, time- and
soul-consuming applications for professional
school or traditional master's and Ph.D. pro
grams, applying to co-term was a fairly smooth
and straightforward process, Cone said.
"I think that applying to the coterminal pro
gram as a current Stanford student is different,
because you're already here," he added. "It's
not as big of a deal for the department to add
you as a student."
According to Judith Haccou, director of
graduate admissions at Stanford, the process is
very decentralized and run primarily within
each of the more than 65 admitting depart
ments. The individual departments, Haccou

wrote in an e-mail to The Daily, "maintain their
own admissions processes, application dead
lines and admission standards based on ... fac
ulty research and availability, department fel
lowship and assistantship funding availability
[and] professional experience."
No one was short on advice for potential
graduate or professional school applicants.
"The main thing I learned is that applying to
medical or graduate school requires a lot of or
ganization," Benkoski said. "I've never made
so many spreadsheets in my life!"
Haccou stressed the value of early planning
when applying to graduate school. Applying
undecided is not an option, and standardized
tests such as the LSAT, MCAT and GRE have
considerably more weight in most grad school
admissions offices than they do in undergradu
ate admissions. In addition, generic letters of
recommendation will not sufficiently support
an application to a competitive institution
she said students should think hard about
which professors they've interacted with most
frequently and effectively, and put less weight
on name recognition than on positive personal
and academic history.
Ali echoed the importance of being organ
ized and getting an early start on professional
school applications. He explained that law and
medical schools mostly operate on a rolling ad
missions basis, so the earlier one applies, the
better his or her chances.
He added that current law, medical and
graduate students anyone who has recently
gone through the same process and has a good
grasp on the students' side of applying have
consistently been the best sources of advice for
him and his friends during this often stressful
and confusing time.
"I'd say to figure out what you want and
where to get it, sooner rather than later," Cone
said. "You definitely don't want to make a de
cision based on a deadline rather than your
heart."

For high school students, the three
months between pressing the gut
wrenching "submit" button on college
applications and receiving admissions
decisions is a nerve-wracking, but fair
ly lax waiting period. But for college seniors
applying to graduate or professional schools,
the research, application and decision-making
process is intensely hands-on and drawn-out.
"I sent in the first part of my application last
June, and it's still not over," said Emmanuelle
Benkoski 'lO, who started filling out medical
school applications at the end of her junior
year and has yet to choose between her top two
schools, Boston University and Tufts Universi
ty-
Because of the multitude of prerequisite
classes and extracurricular activities expected
of med school applicants, students often have
to begin the preparation process in the fall or
winter of their freshman year. Benkoski, along
with other medically minded undergraduates
undeterred by the organic chemistry series,
spent a significant part of her junior year study
ing for the Medical College Admission Test
(MCAT) the MCAT Web site recommends
beginning to study at least three months in ad
vance of the planned test date and moved
onto formal applications the following sum
mer.
Law school is also a popular option after
Stanford. Although academic preparation for
law school is generally less rigorous than that
for medical school most law schools admit
students from a wide range of undergraduate
majors the application process itself is
equally demanding.
Mohammad Ali 'lO, a coterminal student in
sociology who majored in international rela
tions as an undergraduate, called applying for
law school a "horrendous process" dominated
by a personal statement that took four months
to perfect, the search for professors who could
write the best letters of recommendation and

the bureaucracy of transcript requests. Like
Benkoski, Ali started his applications in June
and didn't submit the last one until November.
Ali plans to attend UC-Berkeley's Boalt
Hall School of Law next year, unless he is ac
cepted at Stanford, which he has yet to hear
from, or gets in off the waitlist at either Colum
bia University or the University of Chicago.
"I applied only to top-10 schools that
was my basic criterion," Ali said. "I'm going to
go to the best school I get into, and right now
that's Berkeley."
According to Law School Admission Coun
cil statistics, 82 percent of Stanford students
who applied to law school last year were ac
cepted into one or more schools, including
Stanford, Harvard, Georgetown, Columbia
and UC-Berkeley.
However, the number of Stanford students
applying to law school has dropped significant
ly in past years, from 318 applicants in 2007 to
268 in 2009. Kathryn Wright, the primary pre
law advisor at Undergraduate Academics and
Research (UAR), suggested that this might be
a symptom of the recessed economy.
"Usually in an economic downturn, appli
cations to law school increase," Wright wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "In this recession, how
ever, Stanford students seem to be more cau
tious."
The decision to continue on to graduate or
professional school can be made at many
points during a student's education, from
freshmen who come to Stanford determined to
be doctors, to science or humanities majors
who decide mid-way through junior year that
graduate school is the place to be.
But at Stanford, it seems that many of the
students who go on to earn various higher de
grees begin their undergraduate careers know
ing that it will not be the final step in their edu
cation.
"I wasn't sure how far I wanted to go [mas
ter's degree or Ph.D.], but I knew I wanted to
go to grad school long before I got to Stan
ford," wrote Taylor Cone 'lO in an e-mail to The
Daily. Cone will continue next year at Stanford

as a coterminal student of mechanical engi
neering.
The coterminal degree program at Stanford
allows students to begin work on a master's de
gree while still finishing their bachelor's de
gree. A far cry from the intensive, time- and
soul-consuming applications for professional
school or traditional master's and Ph.D. pro
grams, applying to co-term was a fairly smooth
and straightforward process, Cone said.
"I think that applying to the coterminal pro
gram as a current Stanford student is different,
because you're already here," he added. "It's
not as big of a deal for the department to add
you as a student."
According to Judith Haccou, director of
graduate admissions at Stanford, the process is
very decentralized and run primarily within
each of the more than 65 admitting depart
ments. The individual departments, Haccou

wrote in an e-mail to The Daily, "maintain their
own admissions processes, application dead
lines and admission standards based on ... fac
ulty research and availability, department fel
lowship and assistantship funding availability
[and] professional experience."
No one was short on advice for potential
graduate or professional school applicants.
"The main thing I learned is that applying to
medical or graduate school requires a lot of or
ganization," Benkoski said. "I've never made
so many spreadsheets in my life!"
Haccou stressed the value of early planning
when applying to graduate school. Applying
undecided is not an option, and standardized
tests such as the LSAT, MCAT and GRE have
considerably more weight in most grad school
admissions offices than they do in undergradu
ate admissions. In addition, generic letters of
recommendation will not sufficiently support
an application to a competitive institution
she said students should think hard about
which professors they've interacted with most
frequently and effectively, and put less weight
on name recognition than on positive personal
and academic history.
Ali echoed the importance of being organ
ized and getting an early start on professional
school applications. He explained that law and
medical schools mostly operate on a rolling ad
missions basis, so the earlier one applies, the
better his or her chances.
He added that current law, medical and
graduate students anyone who has recently
gone through the same process and has a good
grasp on the students' side of applying have
consistently been the best sources of advice for
him and his friends during this often stressful
and confusing time.
"I'd say to figure out what you want and
where to get it, sooner rather than later," Cone
said. "You definitely don't want to make a de
cision based on a deadline rather than your
heart."
