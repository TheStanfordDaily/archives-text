# HOOPS, HEART AND HUSTLE

### ERIKAALVERO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Amid a sea of athletic shorts and
T-shirts, a flash of orange rubber
caught the eyes of onlookers at
the Napa Valley Marathon in
March.

Pablo Aguilera 'O7 nestled a basketball
in his hands, which he planned to bounce as
he ran the 26.2-mile course through Napa
Valley's scenic vineyards and hills. And he
intended to break a world record.

"The actual record itself, the dribbling a
basketball while running a marathon, that
came as a joke," Aguilera said.
Aguilera, a history teacher at Woodside
High School in Redwood City, was helping
a student look up the record for running up
the stairs of the Empire State Building in
the Guinness Book of World Records for a
trivia contest when he first caught sight of
the basketball-marathon record.
"I saw that the record holder ran a
marathon in four and a half hours and I
said, 'I can do that,"' he recalled. "Some
friends came over to hang out after work,
and they asked me to prove it. So I went
right to the Web site and signed up as a j oke,
but I thought there was no way they were
going to get back to me,"

A few months later, the Napa Valley
Marathon directors sent an e-mail to Aguil
era, approving his request to run the
marathon while dribbling. The response
took Aguilera by surprise, and it was then
that the daunting nature of the task truly
dawned on him. Although he had competed
in triathlons while at Stanford and had
played pick-up basketball all his life, he
knew that this unusual attempt would re
quire extensive training.

Enlisting the aid of Christopher Gaines
'O5, a Stanford rugby coach and trainer, the
two designed an intricate training program
incorporating cross training and upper
body strengthening exercises to keep the
shoulders and arms from tiring too quickly.
"The training program I developed for
Pablo was meant to develop his overall
body coordination and awareness," Gaines
said. "This stemmed from the need to have
optimal coordination due to his need to
dribble while running."

As the March 7 event date drew closer,
Aguilera decided to use his dribbling en
deavor to raise awareness and funds for an
organization close to his heart: Stanford
College Prep, a mentoring and tutoring
program that helps disadvantaged students
with both college-geared academics and
the complex application process. After
speaking with one of his students, who
could not afford Stanford or Berkeley's ap

plication fees, he decided that he would
focus his efforts in this direction.

"At that point I realized, maybe these
kids are turned away by the fees of actually
applying to the school," Aguilera said. "I
mean, if they apply and they get in, then
there's aid, but if they're turned away from
even applying, that's a big problem."
After months of preparation, the day of
the marathon arrived. Aguilera, palming a
basketball at the starting line, drew great
speculation and curiosity from fellow run
ners.

"Everyone was pretty supportive once
they found out what I was doing," he said.
"Some of the people I was running around
asked, 'ls that for charity?' And when I said
yes, they were all running beside me. There
were these serious runners with watches
and GPS systems for their pace, and they
actually tried to keep me on pace with what
I was trying to get."

Aside from a near mishap at the begin
ning of the race when a man jokingly
swiped at the ball, and another instance
when a woman started complaining of the
continuous "boing" of the ball, the race
began smoothly. Aguilera alter-

nated hands when dribbling

and soon fell into the
rhythm of the motion,
and the other runners
and spectators cheered
him on. Until mile 14,
Aguilera's quest
seemed destined for
victory.
"1 followed Pablo
via GPS for the entire
race and could see that

his pace was well ahead
of the record I was
sure he was going to beat
it," Gaines recalled. "I no
ticed him slow down to a
stop around mile 14 and fig
ured that something had gone
wrong."
At a water station at mile 14, Aguil
era's leg suddenly slipped on the water
plastered asphalt and bent away from
him as he fought to remain standing, ft
was accompanied by a loud "pop" that
did not bode well for his leg's wellbeing.
"ft was painful like crazy," Aguilera
said. "But 1 ended up going still. I could
n't run, but I was walking and still drib
bling somehow. And then I had to do that
for about four miles."
At mile 20 he decided to attempt a
running pace again, because with a 48-
minute 10K, he could still break the record.
But his renewed running only lasted until
mile 21, when another pop sounded. This

time, he knew he had to stop running.
Aguilera walked for another two miles, and
then managed to limp-jog to the finish.
"Looking back on it, we felt that for the
overall message and ending, it kind of fit the
whole cause a little bit better," Aguilera
said. "I do wish it could have been different
just because of the pain, but for the message
of getting everyone to realize what was
going on, how serious it is and my commit
ment to that, as a teacher and just an educa
tor and a member of society in general, I

think it really was meant
to happen that way."
While Aguilera
beat the original
four-and-a-half
hour record, in
the interim be
tween setting

forth to achieve his goal and running the
marathon, a man from Los Angeles set a
new record at 3:38. Because of his injury,
Aguilera was not able to surpass this new
barrier, but he has plans to repeat the effort
in Sacramento this December and continue
fundraising. He also plans to remain by the
cause that he jumpstarted, and is hoping to
create a scholarship fund with the money
raised from his next basketball-marathon.
"Pablo's marathon fundraiser has been
incredible for us," said Christine Solari, di
rector of Stanford College Prep. "First, he
raised over $7,000 for our program, which
is a huge amount of money for us and can
really support our senior programming.
â–  Second, it brought a lot of attention to
I our program we've been around a
long time, but we've never had that
much publicity."
"The young people who go through our
program are incredible and they have big
dreams," Solari continued. "Given access,
they can achieve anything."

beat the original

forth to achieve his goal and running the
marathon, a man from Los Angeles set a
new record at 3:38. Because of his injury,
Aguilera was not able to surpass this new
barrier, but he has plans to repeat the effort
in Sacramento this December and continue
fundraising. He also plans to remain by the
cause that he jumpstarted, and is hoping to
create a scholarship fund with the money
raised from his next basketball-marathon.
"Pablo's marathon fundraiser has been
incredible for us," said Christine Solari, di
rector of Stanford College Prep. "First, he
raised over $7,000 for our program, which
is a huge amount of money for us and can
really support our senior programming.

dreams," Solari continued. "Given access,
they can achieve anything."

Amid a sea of athletic shorts and
T-shirts, a flash of orange rubber
caught the eyes of onlookers at
the Napa Valley Marathon in
March.

Pablo Aguilera 'O7 nestled a basketball
in his hands, which he planned to bounce as
he ran the 26.2-mile course through Napa
Valley's scenic vineyards and hills. And he
intended to break a world record.

"The actual record itself, the dribbling a
basketball while running a marathon, that
came as a joke," Aguilera said.
Aguilera, a history teacher at Woodside
High School in Redwood City, was helping
a student look up the record for running up
the stairs of the Empire State Building in
the Guinness Book of World Records for a
trivia contest when he first caught sight of
the basketball-marathon record.
"I saw that the record holder ran a
marathon in four and a half hours and I
said, 'I can do that,"' he recalled. "Some
friends came over to hang out after work,
and they asked me to prove it. So I went
right to the Web site and signed up as a j oke,
but I thought there was no way they were
going to get back to me,"

A few months later, the Napa Valley
Marathon directors sent an e-mail to Aguil
era, approving his request to run the
marathon while dribbling. The response
took Aguilera by surprise, and it was then
that the daunting nature of the task truly
dawned on him. Although he had competed
in triathlons while at Stanford and had
played pick-up basketball all his life, he
knew that this unusual attempt would re
quire extensive training.

Enlisting the aid of Christopher Gaines
'O5, a Stanford rugby coach and trainer, the
two designed an intricate training program
incorporating cross training and upper
body strengthening exercises to keep the
shoulders and arms from tiring too quickly.
"The training program I developed for
Pablo was meant to develop his overall
body coordination and awareness," Gaines
said. "This stemmed from the need to have
optimal coordination due to his need to
dribble while running."

As the March 7 event date drew closer,
Aguilera decided to use his dribbling en
deavor to raise awareness and funds for an
organization close to his heart: Stanford
College Prep, a mentoring and tutoring
program that helps disadvantaged students
with both college-geared academics and
the complex application process. After
speaking with one of his students, who
could not afford Stanford or Berkeley's ap

plication fees, he decided that he would
focus his efforts in this direction.

"At that point I realized, maybe these
kids are turned away by the fees of actually
applying to the school," Aguilera said. "I
mean, if they apply and they get in, then
there's aid, but if they're turned away from
even applying, that's a big problem."
After months of preparation, the day of
the marathon arrived. Aguilera, palming a
basketball at the starting line, drew great
speculation and curiosity from fellow run
ners.

"Everyone was pretty supportive once
they found out what I was doing," he said.
"Some of the people I was running around
asked, 'ls that for charity?' And when I said
yes, they were all running beside me. There
were these serious runners with watches
and GPS systems for their pace, and they
actually tried to keep me on pace with what
I was trying to get."

Aside from a near mishap at the begin
ning of the race when a man jokingly
swiped at the ball, and another instance
when a woman started complaining of the
continuous "boing" of the ball, the race
began smoothly. Aguilera alter-

nated hands when dribbling

and soon fell into the
rhythm of the motion,
and the other runners
and spectators cheered
him on. Until mile 14,
Aguilera's quest
seemed destined for
victory.
"1 followed Pablo
via GPS for the entire
race and could see that

his pace was well ahead
of the record I was
sure he was going to beat
it," Gaines recalled. "I no
ticed him slow down to a
stop around mile 14 and fig
ured that something had gone
wrong."
At a water station at mile 14, Aguil
era's leg suddenly slipped on the water
plastered asphalt and bent away from
him as he fought to remain standing, ft
was accompanied by a loud "pop" that
did not bode well for his leg's wellbeing.
"ft was painful like crazy," Aguilera
said. "But 1 ended up going still. I could
n't run, but I was walking and still drib
bling somehow. And then I had to do that
for about four miles."
At mile 20 he decided to attempt a
running pace again, because with a 48-
minute 10K, he could still break the record.
But his renewed running only lasted until
mile 21, when another pop sounded. This

time, he knew he had to stop running.
Aguilera walked for another two miles, and
then managed to limp-jog to the finish.
"Looking back on it, we felt that for the
overall message and ending, it kind of fit the
whole cause a little bit better," Aguilera
said. "I do wish it could have been different
just because of the pain, but for the message
of getting everyone to realize what was
going on, how serious it is and my commit
ment to that, as a teacher and just an educa
tor and a member of society in general, I

think it really was meant
to happen that way."
