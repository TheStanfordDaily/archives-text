## EDITORIAL In abuse scandal, Vatican is not excused from criticism 
### 
Over the past few weeks, new revela
tions have cast a startling light on the
extent to which the Vatican and
even Pope Benedict XVI himself may
have been involved in preventing clergymen
accused of child abuse from facing legal
repercussions, or even being removed from
contact with children. New documentation
reveals that church officials may have ig
nored repeated warnings from bishops as to
the dangers of a Wisconsin priest who is ac
cused of molesting more than 200 deaf chil
dren.

pubescent, the issue is one of homosexuality
and not of child abuse.
Up to this point in the editorial, the Edito
rial Board has felt content to simply restate
the facts at hand rather than develop an argu
ment. All the same, we will make a brief state
ment concerning what is, on an intellectual
level, perhaps the most disturbing aspect of
this situation the idea that criticism of the
church's handling of abuse cases amounts to
anti-Catholicism, which in turn amounts to
Nazi anti-Semitism.
Aside from being highly insensitive to the
actual victims of the Holocaust and anti-
Semitism, this argument dangerously implies
that criticizing the actions of the church, even
those that may be illegal, amounts to attack
ing Catholics as individuals. It is one thing to
associate cultural insensitivity with preju
dice, but it is an entirely different matter to
try to excuse deplorable and illegal behavior
by claiming church privilege. It does not of
fend anyone's faith or culture to demand that
justice be met, and it does not help any organ
ization to allow corruption and abuse to go
unchecked. In fact, the Editorial Board
would imagine that there are a sizeable num
ber of active members in the Catholic com
munity who are also disappointed and out
raged by the church's handling of these cases.
When the leaders of any organization permit
this kind of corruption to permeate its ranks,
they betray the trust of all those who have
put their faith in them.
The Editorial Board condemns the asser
tion that Vatican leaders should not be criti
cized or held accountable for the failure, or
possible unwillingness, to end a world-wide
pattern of abuse. Even with all considera
tions of multiculturalism and church privi
lege taken into account, there can still be no
just argument for excusing this kind of neg
ligence.

The same month, a Munich priest's al
leged abuse showed that the Pope may have
directly ignored cases of abuse by the clergy
while serving as then-Archbishop Joseph
Ratzinger. This incident is just one in a string
of cases that seem to reveal that child abuse
by priests has been, contrary to original as
sertions, a worldwide problem rather than
simply an American phenomenon.
As offensive as the possibility of church
officials covering up child abuse may be, the
church's reactions to allegations of a cover
up are perhaps even more offensive. During
a Good Friday service, Pope Benedict's per
sonal preacher, Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa,
equated criticism of the church in these times
with anti-Semitism against Jews in the lead
up to the Holocaust. According to Canta
lamessa, the perceived "passing from respon
sibility and guilt to a collective guilt, remind
me of the more shameful aspects of anti-
Semitism."

Furthering Rev. Cantalamessa's feelings
of persecution, American Catholic League
leader Bill Donohue added this month that
the abuse of children by priests should have
been handled as a private, internal matter
within the church instead of a cause for po
lice involvement. He added that, because
many of the victims in question were post-
