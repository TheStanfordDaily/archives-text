# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## "Real" Student Issues 
### Emily Hulme 
Some of you may be aware that ASSU is
conducting their annual census of the
democratically inclined members of the
Stanford student body. Per their constitution,
communists will only receive 3/5 of a vote. As
you may also know, there are about 17,000
different slates and senators running, and
each running on what they perceive to be the
"real" issues that effect Stanford students
daily.

This, of course, is a farce. If they were fo
cusing on "real" issues, there would be at least
one platform campaigning to fight the plague
of laundry room criminals who leave their
precious garments unattended after the
washer has finished, filling at least 70 percent
of machines across campus any given Sunday
afternoon. These really in-touch campaigners
would suggest that we ankle-bracelet the
chronic perpetrators and/or waterboard
them in the Wellness Room.

They, I suppose, would run a vigorous cam
paign (flyers! Facebook groups! e-mails from
people you are trying to forget!), opposing in
a lively multimedia debate the SAOSDS
(SOW-suds), Students Against Other Stu
dents who Don't Shower. The riveting leader
of this coalition would recount tear-jerking
stories of his experiences stuck in a Chem 35
lecture surrounded by hygienically chal
lenged peers. The proponents would suggest
that we ankle-bracelet the chronic perpetra
tors and/or waterboard them in the Wellness
Room.

I would have to be willfully unaware of this
year's platforms to not mention that many
have made specific outlines of the policies
they hope to initiate. Nonetheless, within and
beyond Stanford, general abstract commit
ments, bordering on platitudes, to sustainabil
ity, transparency, et al., are more the stuff of a
good campaign. The first obvious explanation
for this is that unquantifiable promises are
easier to defend than specific plans. Here, I
must tip my hat to the esteemed Samantha
Bee, a correspondent on "The Daily Show."
Explaining the fallout after one of President
Obama's campaign promises fell through,
Bee points out how he erred. He could very
well have made emphatic promises, she says,
just not specific promises. As an example,
clips interposed in her discussion juxtapose
one term, "Read My Lips: No New Taxes"
Bush with two term, "Give me the opportuni
ty to lead this nation and I will lead" Bush
(punch line: he never said in which direction).
But, I would like to take a slightly different
view of how these platforms coalesce, be
cause I don't think this is the whole story.
To be fair, there are only a limited number
of shared concerns among Stanford students
naturally, these are not going to be terribly
specific to any given individual or group.
Moreover, there seems to be a general rule
that the degree of specificity to campaign
promises is directly proportional to the obvi
ousness of unflattering, negative conse-

quences. For example, it is not entirely obvi
ous what the drawbacks are indeed, it al
most seems foolish to suggest they exist
for a commitment to sustainability. But, sup
pose the concrete manifestation of that com
mitment is using more recycled paper prod
ucts with a higher price point than the old
fashioned sort made from the corpses of a vir
gin forest. There is an argument here that
is, it may or may not be worth it to increase
student fees or taxes that only emerges
when we draw out the particulars of the com
mitment.
In student campaigns here, there is such a
high degree of turnover that it makes little
sense to engender debate during the cam
paign rather than promote lofty intangibles.
Candidates can stave off debate by present
ing only the positive ideals; refraining from
outlining the specifics is away to disguise the
fact that nearly any policy decision will have
drawbacks. After all, very few candidates will
be taken to task for not acting on their prom
ises. To that end, I must confess that I admire
those candidates who dare to take the contro
versial stance. Naturally, with the danger of
staking a campaign claim firmly on earth
comes the reward of material dividends when
a campaigner becomes an effective policy
maker.

Emily probably would be the first one ankle
braceleted. Track her at ehulme@stanford.edu.

Really in-touch
campaigners would
suggest that we ankle
bracelet the chronic
perpetrators and/or
waterboard them in the
Wellness Room.
