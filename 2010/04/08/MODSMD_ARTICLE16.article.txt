# ALTERNATIVE LIVING...WITHOUT THE NAKED
## Things You Discover Through Conversation 
### Samantha Toh 
As I write this, it is Sunday and pouring,
and I am wearing several woolly lay
ers indoors. I thought the cold would
be miserable, but having just spent several
hours in a homey cafe slouched over hot cof
fee, things are looking up.
Wandering off campus for me is a bit of a
rarity. The physical exertion of either taking
the Marguerite or biking is somewhat fright
ening, and my life is so full of inertia that I
mostly end up lolling on my bed and falling
asleep. Some weeks ago, however, a lovely
girl from my house offered to take me out to
coffee, on one of my first friend-dates of the
quarter.
I interject to explain my friend-dates. In
response to a lack of romantic dating at Stan
ford, I began taking my friends and even ac
quaintances out on long afternoon dates. In
what began as a bit of a joke, we played up
the flowers, the dressing up and sometimes,
with a bit of punch and farce, antiquated sex
ist language.
While those were the days when I still had
a mental capacity of a 12-year-old boy (I am
up to 13 now, it's encouraging), I learned
quite a bit from the process of my friend
dates. Primarily, I discovered how precious
these one-on-one conversations were. Cer
tainly, I have enjoyed myself in big groups,
from massive freshman year Guitar Hero
rock-out sessions to watching movies about
killer leprechauns after frat parties. The ex
change of ideas and anecdotes between two
people, however, offers a rare secrecy, and es
tablishes a whole different kind of human
connection.
So today, this rainy Sunday, I was out on a
lovely friend-date in downtown Paly with an
esteemed girl named Susannah, wearing
striped green legwarmers and two enormous
sweaters. We sipped our milky coffees and
began talking about our lives before we had
met, and in between two mouth-shovels of
carrot cake, I said suddenly, "It's weird."
"What?" asked my aforementioned es
teemed company.
"It's weird," I repeated, staring intensely
into my carrot cake. "I started out at Stanford

really neurotic."
Had this been a speed-date, she would
have fled for the hills. Susannah, however, is
esteemed for a reason. She listened intently
as I recounted how, in wanting to turn over a
new leaf, I began at Stanford trying to be as
neat as possible. Neatness, however, twisted
quickly into an unhealthy addiction, wherein
my coat hangers began facing the same direc
tion, my sleep hours commenced promptly at
midnight, and my underwear - color coordi
nated and stacked - was folded in a certain
way. The act of organization overtook the
substance of what I was organizing - in other

words, my life. I studied on particular days,
partied on others. I ate my salads before my
main course, I drank water only at the end of
every meal. In sum, my life fell into a pre
dictable routine, became overly compart
mentalized and remained, for far too long,
too inflexible for my liking.
It was only through our conversation that
I realized how relaxed three years at Stan
ford have made me, and how much life is bet
ter for it. For one, co-op life has greatly aug
mented my tolerance for germs, dirt and gen
eral mess. I have also become friends with
some of the wildest, most ridiculous people, a
process which hatched me from my rigid
shell. Now, I can now sleep anytime between
10 p.m. and 3 a.m., depending on which social
group I am with, and even the unshowered
can slather themselves all over my bed when
they visit.
I have not made a 180-degree turnaround;
I am still a little too classy for Porta Potties.
But I realized, in the verbal articulation of my
habits, how much I have changed, even in the
smallest of ways.
My two hours in a little cafe did not only
enable me to learn about a brand new and
beautiful person, it also crystallized for me
the trajectory of my personal growth. It is cu
rious how reality solidifies once it is ex
pressed aloud. Hearing my own voice ac
knowledge my previous faults, my dissatis
faction with certain aspects of my life and my
bid to change things made me aware of the
effort I had put into the process. Revealing
this to some other person also made me feel
like I had changed the dynamic between us.
Some metaphorical door had been madly
thrown open as we made discoveries about
one another's personalities. And it is some
how comforting to think that it isn't just a
one-way discovery, where we excavate little
pieces of one another's lives. Rather, togeth
er, through conversation, we are both pio
neering new ground, and both being sur
prised about one another and ourselves.

For me, co-op life has
greatly augmented my
tolerance for germs, dirt
and general mess. I have
also become friends with
some of the wildest, most
ridiculous people...
