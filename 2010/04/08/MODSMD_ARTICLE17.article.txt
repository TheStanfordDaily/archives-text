## HEADING NORTH Card plays three road matches in Pacific Northwest 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a successful weekend
at home, the No. 11 Stanford
women's tennis team (14-1, 3-0
Pac-10) looks to continue its un
defeated Pac-10 record when it
travels north to take on Wash
ington State (9-11, 1-4), No. 25
Washington (9-4, 1-3) and Ore
gon (7-13,1-5).
The women came out with
high energy to defend their
home winning steak, which now
stands at 159 matches, making it
the longest home winning streak
in all Division I athletics. The
last match Stanford lost was
back on Feb. 27,1999, when Cal
ifornia pulled a 5-4 upset.
An interesting development
in regard to the streak has come
about because the women
stopped play due to rain at 3-3 in
the match against USC. Both
teams decided to end the day at
singles and replay the doubles
later if needed. The doubles will

be resumed at the Pac-10 Championships in Ojai,
Calif, later this month, but only if it is needed to de
termine who wins the conference regular season.
However, because of this dilemma, the rulebooks
will need to be looked at closely for this match. Be
cause the match was originally played on the Cardi
nal's home court, it may count as a home win. This
means that if USC defeats Stanford in Ojai, it will
count as a home loss and break the winning streak.
However, if it does not count as a home match be
cause the remainder is played at a neutral court, then
win or lose, Stanford's streak is protected. Closer
analysis will need to be done.

Between now and a potential USC rematch, the
Cardinal must first take care of business on a three
game road swing. Coming first is Washington State,
which has struggled facing up to its California rivals
recently. The Cougars scored their biggest upset of
the season when they defeated No. 39 Arizona 6-1. It
was their highest upset since they beat No. 34 Wash
ington in 2008. However, the five California schools

they have faced so far have all de
feated the Cougars.
Washington State has
one nationally ranked player in
No. 91 Liudmila Vasilieva, who
plays at the No. 2 spot on the
team. WSU's top singles player,
Elisabeth Fournier, recently
earned her 17th victory. Those
two pair up to comprise the
Cougars' top doubles team.
Their cross-state rivals,
No. 25 Washington, will pose
more of a challenge to Stanford.
While they recently suffered two
dominant losses to UCLA and
USC, teams with which Stanford
has proved competitive, the
Huskies have proven capable of
handling the teams below them.
Husky sophomore Denise Dy,
playing at the No. 2 spot, has
proven especially effective. She is
3-0 in Pac-10 play and recently
scored an upset over UCLA's No.
49 Noelle Hickey 2-6, 6-3, 1-0.
Her matchup with senior Lindsay
Burdette, a player who has strug
gled since spring break, could
pose danger for the Cardinal. Dy ranks second in
Husky history with a winning percentage of 88 per
cent.

Finally, Stanford will travel to Oregon to take on
the Ducks. Oregon recently defeated Washington
State 4-3 for its first Pac-10 victory. That victory also
earned the Ducks their first doubles point in Pac-10
play, a matchup that Stanford could use to its advan
tage. Considering the Cardinal features two nation
ally ranked doubles teams, it expects to have a siz
able advantage in these matches. Oregon does have
a streak at No. 3 doubles, though; Molly McDevitt
and Julia Metzger are 3-0 since they were paired up
for the first time against Montana State.
Stanford will need to use these Pac-10 matches to
improve before its rematch with rival California at
home, with a match against Santa Clara in between.
The Cardinal comes home again to face Santa Clara
on April 15 before hosting Cal, April 17.
