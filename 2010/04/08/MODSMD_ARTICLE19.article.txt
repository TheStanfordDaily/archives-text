# GOLFING IN THE DESERT
## Women to play in PING ASU Invitational 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
The No. 12 Stanford women's golf team is bound for Tempe,
Ariz, for the PING Arizona State Invitational this Friday through
Sunday at the Karsten Golf Course.
The Cardinal will compete in a field of 17 teams that includes
the host Arizona State, Alabama, California, Denver, New Mexi-

co, Oklahoma State, Pep
perdine, Purdue, San Jose
State, Texas, Tulsa, UCLA,
Washington and Washing
ton State.
According to sopho
more Sydney Burlison, the
tournament will not be a
competition of endurance,
but will rest on who can
seize opportunities for low
scores.
"We're all excited to
play there," Burlison said.
"It's a very scoring-orient
ed course, so we're expect
ing the other teams to
make a lot of birdies and go
really low, but we're pre
pared for that. Instead of
being scared of this fact, our

team has embraced it and has seen it as a challenge that we will
match rather than something to be afraid of."
Senior Angela King, junior Rebecca Durham and freshmen
Kristina Wong and Sally Watson will be competing for the team
title along with Burlison. The Stanford women plan to put them
selves in the right positions on the course so that they can make a
lot of birdies and score low rather than outlast their competition
over the three-day tournament. The playing conditions are a
desert-style course with generally very windy weather, yet the
team is ready to swing into action and embrace the heat.
"This will be my third time playing this event," Durham said.
"It's one of my favorite tournaments. The course is difficult but fair.
The scores are generally low. Most importantly, this tournament is
going to have a very, very strong field."
"It will be good preparation for Regionals and Nationals. We
are expecting to go out and contend with the top teams. I'm look
ing forward to it," she added.
