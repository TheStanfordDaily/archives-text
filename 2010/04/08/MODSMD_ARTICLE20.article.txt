# Duke is no NBA team
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
If you didn't hate Duke before, you do
now. Beating Butler was virtually an
act of terrorism, shattering the heart
of every basketball-watching soul
outside of Durham and creating even
more hatred for the most loathed school in
the nation. I grew up a Duke fan, only be
cause the Blue Devils saturated CBS on
Saturdays in Florida, but am now among
the masses that curse the hardwood they
walk on.
However, we should give props where
props are due. Duke was considered vastly
overrated over the course of the season de
spite having a phenomenal year and the
No. 1 seed in the tournament. Coach K once
again turned a team with obvious flaws
lack of a dominant post player, limited ath
leticism, Brian Zoubek, etc. into a cham
pionship-caliber squad. They won, fair and
square, and beat several really solid teams
along the way.
Because of this, the media circus that
will continue to prevail weeks after the title
game has been as active as ever in the past
few days. There have been several ridicu
lous stories surrounding the university. But
the most ludicrous have come from the
strange comparisons and relationships
made between Duke and the NBA's New
Jersey Nets.
The first was an actual debate on a cer
tain 24-hour sports network known for in
coherent analysis in which the two parties
involved argued over whether this year's
Duke squad could beat the Nets, who cur
rently sit at a ripe 11-66 with just five games
remaining. I see the raw foundation of this
argument the Blue Devils fended off
over 300 schools with the nation's premier
collegiate talent and thus could handle one
of the worst teams in NBA history.
My thoughts: are you serious?
I am the first to admit that the Nets are
horrendous. However, it is still an NBA
team with NBA talent. Regardless of how
well they can defend elite professional play
ers, they can most definitely match up
against the likes of Kyle Singler, Nolan
Smith and Jon Scheyer. It's even more
ridiculous if it's broken down at a position
by-position basis. Brook Lopez (we miss
you) would do unspeakable things to
Zoubek in the paint. Brian has had a better
year at seven feet tall, he's learned how
to rebound! —but his offensive produc
tion is still just short of abysmal and his best
defensive decisions involve fouling. At
every other position from the one through
the four, the Nets are just more athletic,
more experienced and just better. Coach K
would bend over backwards to get his
hands on a player like Jarvis Hayes, let
alone Chris Douglas-Roberts or Courtney

Lee. The Nets would win 99 percent of the
time, leaving one percent for point guard
Devin Harris to get hurt.

The second connection that left me flab
bergasted was about the honorable Coach
K. Mike Krzyzewski is unquestionably one
of the greatest basketball minds of all time.
He currently sits at 868 wins for his career,
and continues to turn just about everything
he touches to gold. Because of this, he has
been offered several NBA jobs, including
head coaching positions with the Celtics,
Blazers and Lakers. However, none have
been even close to the magnitude of his lat
est proposition from the Nets.
Led by a new owner, Russian billionaire
Mikhail Prokhorov, the Nets are rumored
to offer Coach K a deal that would pay $l2-
15 million per season. Not a big deal, right?
It's basically his current salary at Duke if
you tripled it. If that's not enough perspec
tive, how about this little nugget of informa
tion: if Coach K were to receive this salary
on the current version of the Nets, he would
earn more annually than Bobby Simmons,
the highest paid player on the Nets
scheduled to make just over $ll million this
year. Lopez, arguably the best player on the
team, will make slightly over two million.
How many coaches do you know that make
six times more than their best player?
The Nets are desperate and their new
owner is filthy rich. But come on, how many
times does it take to learn that college
coaches rarely pan out at the next level?
From Mike Montgomery to Jerry Tarkan
ian to Rick Pitino, college coaches fail. Why
offer Krzyzewski an absolutely ridiculous
amount of money when he's never stepped
foot in the NBA?
This doesn't make sense, nor do the con
nections between the Dukies and the Nets.
Let's just calm down with the comparisons,
give Duke its props and focus on New Jer
sey's offseason of rebuilding. This isn't Eng
lish football, and neither team will be pro
moted nor relegated. NBA teams will al
ways and forever be far better than college
teams, and NBA coaches will always and
forever be better than college coaches at
leading NBA teams. It's plain and simple,
yet it is annually ignored. I love both levels
of basketball as independent forums for
competition the line should never be
blurred.
And if you still think Duke can take the
Nets, that's fine you've just probably
never seen Brian Zoubek play.
