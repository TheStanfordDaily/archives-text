## Palo Alto counts its homeless population 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI STAFF WRITER 
It's midnight on March 31, and a team
of nearly 200 employees from the Palo
Alto Census Office is heading out into the
dark with clipboards and flashlights to
bring census forms to more than 100
parks, plazas, benches, doorways, garages

and bridges in an effort to count the
peninsula's homeless population.
The team is completing the third day of
the City of Palo Alto's homeless census, a
part of the complex logistical process that
is completed once every 10 years by 500
census offices around the country.
Over the three-day period, some 300
Palo Alto census employees were in

volved in bringing census forms to the
homeless, often greeting people as they
stood in lines inside shelters, soup
kitchens and other service centers.
The Palo Alto Census Office is respon
sible for surveying almost the entire
peninsula region, from Mountain View to
the southern border of San Francis
co, according to assistant field opera
tions manager Tom Banks.
They have motivation, as well: the
local homeless population was signif
icantly under-counted in the 2000
census, according to Bob Dolci, the
homeless concerns coordinator for
Santa Clara County. Now, census of
ficials and non-profit workers hope
this year's results will be more accu
rate.
Census data are critical to deter
mining California's representation in
the House of Representatives and
the amount of special program fund
ing flowing into the state, said offi
cials and that data should include
the homeless.
"The homeless residents are real
residents of the city," said Palo Alto
Mayor Pat Burt. "Many of the dollars
that the city receives to help support
programs are provided by federal
funding. And if we don't have knowl
edge of the homeless population, we
might be at a disadvantage for getting
federal funding to help the home
less."
An accurate count of the home
less also helps the city and service
centers determine what portion of
homeless service programs are actu
ally reaching people.
Chris Richardson, the program
manager of Downtown Street Team
(DST), a transitional program that
employs and matches jobs with
homeless people in Palo Alto, works
closely with the city's mobile resi
dents. He estimated that more than
400 homeless men and women live in
the city.
In contrast, Banks estimated that
the 2010 homeless census reached "a

couple hundred" people in the penin
sula region.
The census count may be lower
than hoped, which Banks attributed
to poor weather, a problem that af
fects homeless census counts across
the nation.
Banks estimated the cost of miss
ing someone in the census could be as
much as $1,500 to $1,600 per year in
federal funding.
"If we miss someone, it can poten
tially cost the state many thousands
of dollars," he said.
In order to reach as many mem
bers of the homeless community as
possible, the Palo Alto office began
working last fall to compile a list of
specific locations throughout the
peninsula where homeless people
might be found. Shelters, service cen
ters, religious organizations and law
enforcement agencies contributed to
the list.
The census office held public
meetings and posted fliers in soup
kitchens and shelters that explained
the census.
"Many [homeless people] are also
distrustful," Banks said. Despite the
outreach efforts, though, Banks
guessed that many members of the
homeless population still "did not
feel that comfortable" with the
process.
The census form asks for an indi
vidual's name and address or descrip
tion of where they are, their tele
phone number if one is available, age,
birth date, race and gender.
"We don't ask if they're citizens,"
Banks added. "We don't care. We just
count people."
Homelessness in Palo Alto
DST relies heavily on census in
formation to assess their effective
ness in reaching the homeless popu
lation.
Richardson, who runs the team
operations at DST, has seen the

complexity of homelessness first
hand.

"My attitude before I got into
this work was the same as most peo
ple's," Richardson said. "You feel
badly for homeless people, natural
ly. But you never want to invite them
in. They're kind of shunned, whether
it's 'get a job,' or the look-away.
Homeless people have formed their
own community. They're kindred
spirits and they don't judge each
other like other people judge them."
According to Don Barr, a pedi
atrics professor at Stanford, Palo
Alto's homeless people tend to be
more highly educated than average
homeless populations. About 45 per
cent grew up in Palo Alto; 80 percent
graduated from high school, and
some even have master's and doctor
al degrees.

Barr estimated, however, that 60
percent of the homeless population
in Palo Alto is affected by mental ill
ness.

Michael Davis is one man who
came to DST after panhandling and
fighting a 30-year drug addiction. He
was called "Mr. Thirty-Eight Fifty"
because he would panhandle for
$38.50 every day, just enough money
to rent a Palo Alto hotel room for
himself and his wife at night.
"He saw people he used to pan
handle with getting jobs, cars and
housing," Richardson said. Davis
turned to DST and "has been sober
for years now."
Terry Rogers of the Palo Alto Op
portunity Center, which provides
low-income meals and job assistance,
said what the homeless seek most is
respect.

"They have a name," said Rogers.
"They have family, they have history
and they want someone to take the
time to realize that they exist."

the nation.
Banks estimated the cost of miss
ing someone in the census could be as
much as $1,500 to $1,600 per year in
federal funding.
"If we miss someone, it can poten
tially cost the state many thousands
of dollars," he said.
In order to reach as many mem
bers of the homeless community as
possible, the Palo Alto office began
working last fall to compile a list of
specific locations throughout the
peninsula where homeless people
might be found. Shelters, service cen
ters, religious organizations and law
enforcement agencies contributed to
the list.
The census office held public
meetings and posted fliers in soup
kitchens and shelters that explained
the census.
"Many [homeless people] are also
distrustful," Banks said. Despite the
outreach efforts, though, Banks
guessed that many members of the
homeless population still "did not
feel that comfortable" with the
process.
The census form asks for an indi
vidual's name and address or descrip
tion of where they are, their tele
phone number if one is available, age,
birth date, race and gender.
"We don't ask if they're citizens,"
Banks added. "We don't care. We just
count people."
Homelessness in Palo Alto
DST relies heavily on census in
formation to assess their effective
ness in reaching the homeless popu
lation.
Richardson, who runs the team
operations at DST, has seen the

complexity of homelessness first
hand.

"My attitude before I got into
this work was the same as most peo
ple's," Richardson said. "You feel
badly for homeless people, natural
ly. But you never want to invite them
in. They're kind of shunned, whether
it's 'get a job,' or the look-away.
Homeless people have formed their
own community. They're kindred
spirits and they don't judge each
other like other people judge them."
According to Don Barr, a pedi
atrics professor at Stanford, Palo
Alto's homeless people tend to be
more highly educated than average
homeless populations. About 45 per
cent grew up in Palo Alto; 80 percent
graduated from high school, and
some even have master's and doctor
al degrees.

Barr estimated, however, that 60
percent of the homeless population
in Palo Alto is affected by mental ill
ness.

Michael Davis is one man who
came to DST after panhandling and
fighting a 30-year drug addiction. He
was called "Mr. Thirty-Eight Fifty"
because he would panhandle for
$38.50 every day, just enough money
to rent a Palo Alto hotel room for
himself and his wife at night.
"He saw people he used to pan
handle with getting jobs, cars and
housing," Richardson said. Davis
turned to DST and "has been sober
for years now."
Terry Rogers of the Palo Alto Op
portunity Center, which provides
low-income meals and job assistance,
said what the homeless seek most is
respect.

"They have a name," said Rogers.
"They have family, they have history
and they want someone to take the
time to realize that they exist."
