# Grads oppose Rains changes
## Some Rains apartments to house undergrads 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
Last night's Graduate Student Council (GSC)
meeting was cut short when some council mem
bers, enraged by Student Housing's recently an
nounced plans to convert five Rains apartment
buildings from graduate to undergraduate hous
ing next year, left early to attend a town hall in
protest of the change.
The graduate student community quickly or
ganized an opposition meeting after Student
Housing on Friday announced the proposed
change, which would displace approximately 38
of the 800 graduate students from Rains apart
ment buildings.
"This move is unacceptable," wrote Robert
Hennessy, a GSC member, in an e-mail to gradu
ate students. Hennessy is a doctoral student in
electrical engineering and a Rains college assis
tant (CA). "The logic behind the move is tenuous
at best."
In an e-mail to the residents of the buildings
planned for conversion, Michael L. VanFossen, a
senior associate director of Student Housing, ex
plained that a deficit of spaces for undergraduates
prompted the decision.
"We want to associate [undergraduates] with
an undergraduate residence hall. Because of the
close proximity of [Rains] to Mirrielees, it is ideal
ly suited for this initiative," VanFossen wrote. He
told The Daily that students living in Rains were
consulted before Housing reached its decision.
Rodger Whitney, the executive director of Stu
dent Housing, said in an e-mail to The Daily that
the opening of Munger this fall "essentially met
basic demand for housing for graduate students,"
even with some vacancies remaining. By convert
ing part of Rains for undergraduates, Housing
hopes to consolidate previous graduate vacancies
and use them for a small group of undergraduates
while still meeting grad student demand.
Whitney said plans would be finalized before

the graduate housing lottery opens on Wednes
day.
Housing said it would allow displaced gradu
ate students in buildings 237 and 238 to renew
their contracts as long as they are willing to move
to a different Rains apartment by the end of sum
mer.
Additionally, demand from undergraduates
returning from abroad fall quarter study may call
for the relocation of graduate residents in build
ings 234,235 and 236 for winter quarter. There will
be an official decision regarding these buildings
by early October. Boxes and moving assistance
would be provided for all displaced residents, of
ficials said.
Hennessy argued that such a change would
disrupt the lives of graduate students living in
Rains next year, especially as CA-sponsored
events in mixed graduate-undergraduate housing
would require wristbands and verification of at
tendees' ages for events where alcohol is served.
Rains CAs learned about the change in housing
arrangements only after what they called eviction
notices were sent, they said.
"This is a big slap in the face to grad students,"
said Justin Brown, a doctoral student in geo
physics.
The GSC will hold an emergency session on
Sunday at 4 p.m. to discuss counteracting the
change in housing.
E-mail, Not for Life
The GSC also addressed on Wednesday the
University's decision to reverse the
@stanford.edu-for-life promise announced in Oc
tober by IT Services and ASSU President David
Gobaud.The program, which promised to indefi
nitely forward all messages sent to alumni Stan
ford e-mail addresses to non-Stanford inboxes,
was reversed last quarter, Gobaud said. Members
of the Class of 2009 were notified this week.
"In reality, IT Services can only
speak for the technology aspects of
such a decision," wrote Nancy Ware,
an ITS spokesperson, in an e-mail to
The Daily. "It was premature for IT
Services to verify that this change
could happen."
Ware said several departments on
campus considered reversing the
offer, and ultimately did so, because
"the University needs to be able to
make a distinction between those
who are currently students, faculty
and staff versus alumni."

She said a new e-mail suffix,
@alumni.stanford.edu, would be
available alumni a slight change
from the current @stanfordalumni.
org suffix offered by the Alumni As
sociation.

Gobaud, a coterminal student in
computer science, told the GSC he
has contacted Provost John
Etchemendy numerous times since
October. Gobaud said Etchemendy
ignored requests to involve students
in the policy discussion, but is cur
rently in e-mail discussion with the
executive.

Etchemendy did not immediately
return a request for comment.
The reversal is "a significant step
backward for Stanford," Gobaud
said.

In other business, the council ap
proved funding for Stanford Classics
in Theater, Atheists, Humanists and
Agnostics (AHA!) and the Hong
Kong Student Association.
The Council also met with rep
resentatives from Cardinal Free
Clinics, whose bid for special fees
received a 6-6 advisory vote from
the council last week. The council
re-voted to post a 9-3 opinion
alongside the clinics' special fees
bid.

By the end of the hour. Council
members were in a rush to adjourn
and head to the Rains town hall
