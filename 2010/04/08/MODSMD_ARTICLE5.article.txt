## Palo Alto to explore new compost site 
### ADAM COLE STAFF WRITER 
After a discussion that divided the
throng of environmentalists in attendance
and lasted late into the night, the City of Palo
Alto decided this week to take another look
at processing its own compost. The 5-4 city
council decision means the city will study the
economic and environmental feasibility of
building a compost facility at the northeast
end of Palo Alto.

The majority of Palo Alto residents at
Monday night's meeting supported the pro
posed compost facility, expressing beliefs
that potential economic and real estate
tradeoffs are essential to reaching the city's
sustainability goals.
"In nature, waste is food," said Walt Hays,
the chair of Palo Alto's Community Envi
ronmental Action Partnership. "If we want
to be a sustainable city, we have to emulate
that as best we can."
"We can do something right now that is
great for the environment and also great for
the economy," added former Mayor Peter
Drekmeier. He said use of an anaerobic di
gester employed at the facility would divert
6,000 tons of carbon from the atmosphere
and power 1,400 homes, saving the city
about a million dollars a year.
The proposed site's proximity to a water
treatment plant is ideal, but it lies on an
eight-acre strip of dedicated parkland. Open
space advocates attended Monday's meet
ing to argue that this piece of land should
join Byxbee Park as previously planned.
"The Baylands Park has been planned
for years by competent and dedicated
people," said Palo Alto resident Enid
Pearson, addressing the council. "If we
can't count on our planning process,
why not just pick any random project
and let it be built anywhere?"
Julie Muir, Stanford's recycling pro
gram manager and the community re
lations manager for Peninsula Sanitary
Services, Inc. (PSSI), sees the momen
tum for a composting facility in Palo
Alto as a win-win-situation.
"Anaerobic digestion is the best of
both worlds," Muir said." You get to com
post the organic material and capture the
gases created to generate energy."
Muir said she is excited to see Palo
Alto embark on its latest sustainable
effort. She said PSSI, the facility that
currently handles all of Stanford's

waste, could eventually use the Palo
Alto facility.
But that potential partnership is
years away; construction of a compost
site probably wouldn't begin until
2018, according to a timeline of the
project presented by Glenn Roberts,
the director of Palo Alto Public Works.

In the meantime, the project is sure
to face opposition from Palo Alto resi
dents who believe the land should be
used to expand parks. Palo Alto resi
dent Bob Moss said the proposal is an
expensive gamble. The feasibility study
alone, which was approved by the
council after midnight on Tuesday, is
expected to cost $250,000.
"Waste management should be
done regionally," Moss told the coun
cil, pointing to a handful of facilities
opening in coming years in the Bay
Area that could serve Palo Alto's
needs.

Members of local environmental
groups such as Acterra and the Green
Energy Initiative opposed Moss' state

ments. Many at the meeting saw the
project as a chance to continue Palo
Alto's tradition of sustainability for
generations into the future. One of
them was Annette Isaacson, an ele
mentary school teacher.
"The sixth grade studies global
warming, and all they hear about [are]
problems," lasaacson said. "Now they
can say, 'Wow, Palo Alto is doing some
thing.' They can look at an anaerobic
digestive plant and see how people are
solving problems."
Even if the project is followed
through to completion, Stanford's use
of the facility would be up in the air. But
Muir said even if Stanford doesn't par
ticipate, the facility could still be a boon
for the region.
"If we want people to compost, we
need more facilities in this state," she
said. "We just don't have the capacity
now."
