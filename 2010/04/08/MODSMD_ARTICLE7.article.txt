# STUDENT GOV'T
## Candidates make final pitches as election begins 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Voting was set to open for the
2010 ASSU election at 12:00 a.m. this
morning, and candidates are making
their last-ditch efforts to garner stu
dents' votes before polls close at
11:59 p.m. Friday night.
Students can vote either through
the ASSU election Web site or at var
ious polling stations across campus.
According to Elections Commission
er Quinn Slack 'll, polling stations
will be open during peak daytime
hours at White Plaza, dining halls.
Green Library, the Row and graduate
student lunch areas.
This year's election cycle has been
marked by a greater number of exec
utive slates and the appearance of
two student-formed coalitions for
Senate.

In particular, the coalitions of Stu
dents United Now (SUN) and Stu
dents with Experience (S.Ex.), plus
the 12 candidates endorsed by the
Students of Color Coalition (SOCC),

have been most visible in campaign
ing. Current ASSU President and
coterminal student in computer sci
ence David Gobaud announced his
endorsement for S.Ex. via e-mail last
night, his only endorsement.
Students running without a for
malized group have had more diffi
culty with getting their names out to
the electorate.
"Because [fellow independent
candidate Khaled Alshawi 'l3] and I
do not have the money or resources
to distribute free pizza, free sunglass
es, or flier in large groups, we have
had to work extra hard to build a
solid platform and engage and inter
act with the student body," wrote
Senate candidate Noemi Walzebuck
'l3 in an e-mail to The Daily.
Conversely, SOCC, an endorse
ment group founded in 1987, has
years of experience in endorsing and
supporting candidates who share
core values of diversity, community,
tolerance and transparency and
who try and succeed to win over key
student group representatives.
Seven SOCC-endorsed candi
dates won seats in the 15-person
Senate in 2009; seven won in 2008,
seven in 2007 and 10 in 2006. Slates
endorsed by SOCC won ASSU ex
ecutive office in 2006 and 2007.
(SOCC did not endorse executive
slates in 2008 or 2009.)

"What makes us different from
the new coalitions, I guess, is that we
stand for that sense of community"
said Deepa Kannappan 'l3, a Senate
hopeful endorsed by SOCC. Kan
nappan said SOCC represents more
than just "ethnic" communities, but
also religious, dorm and gender com
munities.
SOCC's five member groups are
the Stanford American Indian Or
ganization, Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA),
the Black Student Union, the Mus
lim Student Awareness Network
and the Asian American Students'

Association.
SOCC has endorsed sophomores
Michael Cruz, Ben Jensen and
Rafael Vasquez for the second year
in a row, along with freshmen Kan
nappan, Juany Torres, Kamil Saeid,
Katie Cromack, Madeline Hawes,
Robin Perani, Milton Achelpohl, Pat
Bruny and Daniel Khalessi.
Cruz is the only incumbent in the
race.
Election results will be an
nounced at 5 p.m. on Saturday.
