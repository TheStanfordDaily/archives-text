### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Marisa Landicho 
With a platform of mandatory bike hel
mets for ASSU officials. Senator Palpatine
is mounting his second write-in campaign
for Senate office. Palpatine, who finished in

35th place with 152 votes last year, an
nounced his candidacy in an e-mail to stu
dents last Thursday.

Palpatine, a coterminal student in com
puter science, is one of the more experi
enced candidates seeking office, having pre
viously served as Dark Lord of the Sith,
Galactic Emperor and Senator of Naboo.
He also made the number three spot in Wiz
ard magazine's "100 Greatest Villains of All
Time" list.

Palpatine said he was motivated to run
for "absolute power" and "excellence," and
is lobbying for a new "chamber" for the Sen
ate, which currently meets in the Nitery.
"[The Nitery's] lack of stadium-style
seating and floating platforms makes it look
like somewhat of a joke, frankly," Palpatine
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
A fan of totalitarian rule, he is strongly
against both the new Senate coalitions and
the slates running for executive.

"While I am pleased with the [Students
With Experience] coalition's anger —it
gives them focus, makes them stronger
'coalition' sounds a lot like 'alliance,' and al
liances are to be crushed," he said.
For Palpatine, the executive race holds
no importance.
"It doesn't matter either they will join
me, or they will be destroyed."
