Rituals of Death Ancient and Modern
This program will examine rhe rituals surrounding death in
Western civilization. Studying the rituals of death will allow
us to ask broader questions about why we honor the dead
and what we hope for ourselves when we shuffle off this
mortal coil.
Join Marilyn Yalom as she presents four major historical
themes: 1) how colonial settlers claimed the land from Native
Americans and introduced Europeanstyle cemeteries; 2) how
these immigrants and later Americans marked their graves
with wood and stone; 3) how specific religious and ethnic
groups remained together even in the graveyard; and 4) how
funeral rituals since the early 19th century have reflected a
change in mentality about cemeteries themselves and a
national distancing of death from everyday life. She will also
examine current funeral practices, including cremation and
green burials. A special talk will also be given by Robert
Harrison on funeral rituals and the anthropology of body
disposal in various cultures, from antiquity to present.
This event will include a late-afternoon field excursion to a
nearby cemetery.
