## MONITORING MOSCOW BOSP DISCUSSES RUSSIA PROGRAM AFTER MARCH METRO BOMBINGS 
### E. BLAIR LAING STAFF WRITER 
On March 29, it was a typi
cal Monday morning in
Moscow when hundreds
of Russians filed into the
Lubyanka and Park Kul
tury metro train stations to commute
to work. Then disaster struck.
Suicide bombers later identi
fied as two females by Russia's FSB
security service detonated explo
sives in the busy train stations, killing
39 people and sending shock waves
throughout Russia even some that
had reverberations 5,000 miles away
at Stanford.
For Stanford's Bing Overseas
Studies (BOSP) program, which has
an outpost in Russia's capital city, and
many Stanford students previously in
the Moscow program, the recent
round of suicide attacks struck close
to home.
"As best we know there are no
Stanford students in Moscow, at least
no Stanford students associated in any
way with our program," said Norman
Naimark, the executive director of
BOSP and a history professor.
Stanford's Moscow program is
only offered in the fall.
"The Stanford Center in Moscow
has always been paying special atten
tion to the safety of students coming to
Moscow," said Moscow director,
Alexander Abashkin. "At the same
time, the situation is not specific to
Russia; it's sad, but we also recall the
terror attacks on New York City,
Madrid, London, Mumbai, [Tokyo]
and quite a few similar tragedies
around the world."
Still, the bombings were a jarring
experience for Stanford overseas ad
ministrators perennially concerned
with safety and for students who, only
months ago, called the city home.
"Someone sent out a newsflash on
the Moscow chat list," said Shine Zaw-
Aung 'll, who participated in last fall's
Moscow program. "It was shocking. It
was weird to go on to The New York
Times [website] and see the carnage of
the trains I used to take everyday. I
passed through both stations that
were bombed."
For Ksenia Galouchko 'lO, a partic
ipant in last fall's Moscow program
and a resident of the city, the bombings
were particularly shocking.
"To me, it doesn't make sense that
they blew up those stations because
they are central stations, but there are
more people at other stations," Ga
louchko said. "So it was not about
killing the most people, but about
making a statement."
In light of the recent violence,
BOSP is closely eyeing the political
situation in Moscow to ensure the
safety of all students who participate
in the program. BOSP, however, will
not be making any significant changes
to the safety implementation program
already in place. Under the current
safety-education system, BOSP edu
cates students about the potential
dangers in Moscow as part of their
regular pre-trip orientation and
through numerous seminars after
their arrival in the city.
"I can tell you student safety is our
highest priority," Naimark said. "We

do not live in a completely safe world.
We have concerns about student safe
ty everywhere. We just experienced a
serious earthquake in Santiago. I don't
think we will necessarily make any
changes in our program as a conse
quence of this Moscow metro bomb
ing."
"Obviously, if something happens
between now and next fall, we will
have to think about further actions,"
he added.
Naimark is traveling to Moscow in
May with Abashkin, where the two
will further assess the situation.
Abashkin noted that the host of the
Moscow program, the Academy of
National Economy, is enclosed by
walls and requires a special pass just to
enter, keeping Stanford students safer
than they would be elsewhere. He also
noted that in response to the recent at
tacks, security has been heightened all
over the city.
"The increased police and security
force presence is going to be reassur
ing to us," said Jack Kollmann, a lectur
er in the Center for Russian, East Eu
ropean and Eurasian Studies and one
of the scheduled faculty-in-residence
for next fall. "If I were worried about
safety, my wife and I would not be
going."
In his more than 50 years of experi
ence spending time in Moscow and
other areas of Russia, the worst prob
lem Kollmann has encountered has
been pick-pocketing; he said that
March's bombings do not drastically
alter his security concerns.
"Terrorism can happen any
where," Kollmann said. "Students
need to be briefed on how to be safe in
a big city. It's making sure that all stu
dents are advised on how to be street
smart in a big city. Overseas Studies is
not about to send students into a situ
ation they or the State Department
think is dangerous."

Former Moscow students seem to
agree with Kollmann, Naimark and
Abashkin about the situation, noting
that terrorism is a constant threat,
wherever you are.

"If they cancelled the program that
would have been the stupidest thing
because you can't prevent these
things," Galouchko said. "You have to
be prepared that there will be violence
and there will be dangerous parts of
any big city.Terrorist attacks could and
did happen in other cities. It's chance."
"Every big city has problems,"
Zaw-Aung agreed. "It has always been
hard to prevent terrorist attacks on
the metro. It's Russia; it's not lacking
in security."

Yet BOSP is taking Moscow's po
litical context particularly into ac
count before it sends another round of
Stanford students to Moscow next
fall.
"Are we concerned about the situ
ation in the future?" Abashkin said.
"Yes, we are. The terrorist threat con
tinues to exist. And the next attack
can happen anywhere. We here in
Moscow and my colleagues at BOSP
are closely watching the situation. We
hope there will be no situations in the

future that will affect the Stanford-in-
Moscow program. However if any
such situation occurs we'll be serious
ly thinking about our next steps."
Kollmann expressed confidence in
BOSP's attention to safety issues.
"[Bing] Overseas Studies has a lot
of experience abroad, including in
dangerous situations," Kollmann said.
"I trust them to assess the situation."
