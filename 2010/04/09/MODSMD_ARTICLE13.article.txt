## EDITORIAL With Campaign Week at a close, keep an eye on student government 
### 
As the ASSU election season comes to
an end, the campus can now breathe a
collective sigh of relief.
After much e-mail spam from freshmen
you have never met and countless Facebook
ads, Campaign Week draws to a close tonight.
Though the perennial alphabet soup of en
dorsements and seemingly identical plat
forms emerge every year, we hope our read
ers can take a step back and examine why six
executive slates and thirty or more Senate
candidates spend their time running for stu
dent government positions.
The Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity is the only student organization with
formal access to University leadership, the ad
ministration and each of our more than 600
student groups on campus. At its best, the
ASSU can create positive change on substan
tive issues in specific ways, while also helping
to shape campus dialogue and the general
campus climate.
Nearly every Senate candidate this year
ran on a platform of increasing student voice,
maintaining transparency and other ideals
that he or she felt would resonate with most
voters. And so the Editorial Board now chal
lenges all those elected in this election to find
ways to facilitate student participation in an
open dialogue with the ASSU. The way in

which a candidate campaigned says much
about how they may serve, and we hope that
all those who engaged peers genuinely and
honestly will now serve in the ASSU in the
same manner. Sometimes, however, some of
those elected to represent students later seem
to care little about the general well-being of
the student population. To prevent this apathy
in the coming ASSU, we hope that senators re
member that true representation is not
achieved by the donning of a title.
We also hope that the new ASSU executive
officers will be forthcoming regarding not
only their goals for the year, but in all areas of
their progress, from cabinet selection to coop
eration with the Senate. Please find ways for
all students not only those involved in the
ASSU to have more opportunities to influ
ence University decision-making processes.
Most importantly, the Editorial Board
challenges all those not involved in the
ASSU to find ways to become connected,
even if that just means staying informed and
posing questions for those occupying ASSU
offices. Funding is the most important and, at
times, seemingly the only relevant role of the
ASSU. Even so, the potential of our student
government to improve the student experi
ence could make engagement worth a bit of
our time each week.
