# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## Student Politics â€“ Depressing, Isn't It? 
### Aysha Bagchi 
I have been looking for the Obama-factor
this election cycle, a game-changer who will
elevate student politics. Well, maybe next
year.

The past few weeks have been a whirlwind
of fanatical campaigning, especially in the Sen
ate race. And it pays; most students who will
have won at the end of today picked the cheesi
est slogans, knew how to garner the power en
dorsements and had the money and determi
nation to plaster their faces everywhere, satu
rating campus with ads, stickers and buttons
galore.
It is disillusioning to witness so many candi
dates who probably knew they were running
for Senate before they knew what they stood
for. Quotes in my Facebook News feed right
now include people saying they "dislike poli
tics as usual," "want to work at ASSU if it
means they get to be an ass" and, my personal
favorite, "I just summarily defriended some
one who Facebook chatted me with a link to
some random op-ed about the ASSU execu
tive campaign. Let that be a lesson to you all."
Many students are more enthusiastic about
the campaign of Senator Palpatine than any
other candidate. This is because we see how
campaigns are run and won and how senators
bicker and cater to insiders once in office.
There is no genuine incentive for them to think
hard and honestly about what they should do.
These are, of course, broad generalizations;
I hope and expect that at least a couple of the
people who win are also the kind of people we
would want to have in office. But we see more
facades than people among our student politi
cians. There are probably many students out
there who would be wonderful student repre
sentatives, but hate the idea of campaigning,
especially once they get a glance of what Stan
ford Senate campaigning is like.

All the fanaticism creates a moment of
glory for organizations like The Stanford Re
view, elevated to a couple weeks of promi
nence where they can feel that no matter how
few students traditionally follow their content
(sorry, Reviewers), they can have a serious im
pact on campus elections. To their credit, how
ever, groups like The Review illustrate the sub
stantive debate behind the craziness, a debate
that should be characterizing our elections, not
just underlying them.
The Review is the cornerstone of the polit
ically conservative camp that competes with
our campus community centers' favorite can
didates in ASSU elections. Amid the gimmicks
of campus elections, both camps fail to recog
nize the legitimate concerns of the other that
would help create a meaningful political dis
cussion.

The conservative camp does not see much
value in promoting a culturally vibrant and di
verse campus (at least not if it takes any money
to do itj.TTieir biggest failure is a failure to un-

derstand community centers except in terms of
what they do for students at large, as if the only
role of community centers is to create a more
culturally diverse and vibrant Stanford for
everyone. In this narrow view, community cen
ters are seen as promoters of diversity at the
expense of equality. I have heard multiple peo
ple question why there is no "White Commu
nity Center" or "Men's Community Center,"
as if this illustrates some inequity. The answer
should be obvious; there is no genuine demand
because the "cultural" group defined as white
male students (or any other group that does
not seek a center) already finds a culturally
comfortable environment. We fool ourselves if
we think that every member of a community
center would feel equally comfortable on cam
pus without that community and show a total
inability to empathize and recognize the de
mands from equality for ensuring that no stu
dent feels culturally alienated. Each student
should have the guarantee of a community, mi
norities included.

On the other hand, the conservative camp
has legitimate points about funding and fiscal
restraint. Special fees keep increasing each
year, as do student refund requests. This cre
ates a disparity among students in carrying the
burden for our student groups (some students
can more reasonably afford to contribute, but
this is not the only cause of the divide). Fur
thermore, student groups have little incentive
to be moderate in their requests, so we need
some central body to institute structural tools
that encourage fiscal responsibility. While this
does not mean the Senate should be dismissive
of the needs and justifications of student
groups (as some were this year), it does mean
the Senate has an important role in overseeing
funding. Furthermore, if we are wasting money
on programs that are expensive and ineffec
tive, good intentions are not enough to justify
them.

These are the types of discussions we
should be having an election should be a
time to learn, challenge ourselves and change
our minds. Our current elections do little to
help in this process.
