## Reducing inequality through diversity 
### DANIEL SOTO Ph.D. Candidate in Physics 
Would you believe that the median
wealth (s4lk) of a single white
woman in the U.S. is 60 percent of
that for a single white male? Given the histo
ry of gender inequality in the U.S., it seems
plausible. Now, would you believe that for the
median single black or Hispanic woman, her
net wealth is 400 times smaller than the medi
an white female's? These numbers, reported
this year by the Insight Center for Communi
ty Economic Development, remind us that
there is an astonishing level of inequality
along race and gender lines in our society.
While most look at these numbers and agree
that such discrepancies are unacceptable, it is
difficult to imagine solutions. Stanford helps
to solve such inequalities by its efforts to di
versify its student body and faculty. By edu
cating and promoting talented people from
the populations affected, we produce leaders
more likely to tackle these problems that our
current leaders have not solved.

It is tempting to believe that discrimina
tion on the basis of race and sex does not
exist. Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi hold
power that would lead us to believe that
race and gender discrimination have been
eradicated. Sociological research conducted
within the last two decades tells us other
wise. Studies show that for identical re
sumes, those with typical black names were
selected for interviews at a rate 50 percent
lower than resumes with typical white

names. They also show that there was a 2:1
bias towards hiring a male over a female
with identical applications for faculty posi
tions. This measurable bias shows that mi
nority and female applicants for jobs are at
a disadvantage relative to their white male
counterparts. There is also evidence that
during testing, groups threatened by nega
tive stereotypes often perform below their
ability level. While diversity efforts to cor
rect for these biases often stir controversy,
the default system of affirmative action for
the majority largely escapes examination.
Critics of diversity efforts rightly believe
that applicants should be evaluated solely
on their merits. These and other studies
show that the achievements of women and
minorities are often viewed as inferior to
the same achievements of men and non-mi
norities, antithetical to this meritocratic
ideal. This bias is usually unconscious and is
displayed even by people with egalitarian
attitudes: however, research shows that it
can be mitigated. When selection commit
tees have minorities and women represent
ed at a level of 30 percent or above, the bias
along race and gender lines is greatly re
duced. This 30 percent represents a tipping
point that leads to a more fair evaluation of
applicants for competitive positions. Stan
ford's action to increase diversity among
the students and faculty is an attempt to
reach this critical mass. Programs to in

crease diversity are often criticized as re
verse discrimination, but if we achieve this
tipping point, the end result will be a univer
sity that rewards merit above all other fac
tors. Again, the research currently shows
that as a society, we are not yet rewarding
merit equally across all groups.
This is not a simple story of whites being
prejudiced towards minorities or men view
ing women as inferior. Men, women, minori
ties and whites all demonstrate these biases
against women and minorities and other
marginalized groups. Our society also mar
ginalizes people based on religion, sexuality
and other aspects of our humanity. While we
await the day when sufficient diversity to
overcome bias has been achieved, we can
conduct a rigorous introspection of our own
actions and evaluations and ask if our own
decisions are based solely on merit. We can
actively support diversity efforts on campus
that are being conducted by staff, faculty
and students. We can also consider joining
groups like ASSU Diversity & Tolerance or
the Diversity Advocacy Committee of the
GSC. While fairness here at Stanford is the
immediate goal of these diversity efforts, I
hope eventually we can start to solve prob
lems like the recently reported 400-fold
wealth gap.
