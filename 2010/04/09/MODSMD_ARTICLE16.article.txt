## Sexy or Smart: The Two Disjoint Sets 
### Yanran Lu 
Ne-Yo's "Ms. Independent" or Des
tiny's Child's "Independent Woman"
provided an image for me of the
woman I want to be: powerful, independent
and sexy. Armed with stilettos and an execu
tive office, I'd be earning the big bucks while
building my own empire. I wanted to be
smart and sexy, and the media tells me it is
possible.

I was on a good track with the "smart"
part. My Stanford acceptance proves my
"super smartness" in most circles. Since I got
that base covered, I moved on to assert that I
was not just your typical nerd, a Plain Jane
outfitted with glasses and a library card, but
both a genius and a beauty. I soon got the
"sexy" down. It was easy smokey eyes,
pouty lips, slightly visible cleavage, round
bottoms in mini skirts and the modern-day
foot-binding: four-inch stilettos. Then it came
down to the strut and the dance moves, and,
having been mistaken as a professional strip
per in Berlin, I thought I was golden.
People got the "sexy" message. Actually
not only did they get it, that was all they got.
At frat parties, people could not look past my
miniskirt-encompassed behind nor my on
beat body-rolls. I would talk to some guy and
nothing coming out of my mouth would be of
interest except if it flattered his own ego
powered manhood. Ok, maybe one could
blame it on the deafening music, but the girls
in their own stilettos would glare at me, obvi
ously calling me some names. So I would
wonder why when I go to a gay party in a sexy
getup, people go, "Girl, you are fierce!" Yet
when I go to a frat party, my miniskirt and
stilettos are screaming something else entire
ly. To some, the way I chose to dress has noth
ing to do with my wanting to look and feel
good about myself, but everything to do with
the male spectators I became the object
for their personal pleasure.
In fact, the entitlement to objectify me
prompted random men to come up to me
from behind, press their pelvis against me
and try to maneuver my butt in such away
that served them pleasure. When they were
faced with a deathly-inquisitive "wtf" glare,
they asked, "Oh, you wanna dance?" Think
ing to myself I already was, I would ask "Well,
can you dance?" They would move awkward-

ly and I would realize, of course, grinding is
their only idea of dancing and I was none
other than a servant.
Men (and women) cannot get past the
"sexy" to see the "smart" (even the human).
The "sexy" facade kept people only at the
surface. I blamed people for their feeling that
they were entitled to objectify me. Yet why
do I interpret "sexy" as the four-inch stilettos
and miniskirt-getup? Have I been seduced
by the media to self-objectify and look like a

magazine spread? Have I bought into the
standard the definition of beauty given to
me by them? While I believed that I can do
anything as a woman, I got the subliminal
message, as Susan Douglas puts in Enlight
ened Sexism, that the most "important [un
derlying] task is to be slim, hot and non
threatening to men." I thought I was empow
ered, being both smart and sexy, but I did not
realize the extent to which I was subjugating
myself to objectification.
There appears to be a problem compre
hending the coexistence of smart and sexy.
When we see pretty blond girls, the initial re
action is that she must be dumb. In fact, it ac
tually takes a bit of mental gymnastics to
comprehend that a sexy female could also be
a brainiac and a self-made millionaire in real
life. I, too, questioned the existence of such
persons once upon a time. I have also invol
untarily asked if a good-looking woman in a
position of power has slept her way to the
top.Therefore, to escape such a fate of objec
tification, and actually have the chance of
being perceived as "smart," one has to dress
"modestly." In fact, "to dress for success" is to
show fewer curves and to renounce one's
own femininity. Vice versa, to be "hot," one
has to renounce her intelligence because it
might be "threatening," a la Cady Heron in
Mean Girls.

Thus I have arrived at a paradox. The
commercialized fantasy told me that I can
have it all: "the brain" and "the beauty." I
tried to have both to empower myself like the
successful women portrayed in media. Then I
realized that people cannot look past the dis
guise of "sexy" and thus I am objectified, los
ing my agency. I blame society, on the one
hand, for not being able to look beyond
"skin-deep"; yet at the same time, I have
been lured into self-objectification by the
media in the first place.Therefore, I am left to
question, what is self-empowerment for
women now? Can we be "sexy" without
being objectified? Is the "smart and sexy"
fantasy really the way to go about it? If so,
how do we reclaim agency?

At frat parties,
people could not
look past my
miniskirt
encompassed
behind nor my
own onbeat
body-rolls.
