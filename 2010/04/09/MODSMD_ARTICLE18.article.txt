## Discussion heats up over possible pot legalization 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Driven by strong popular support
and promises of increased tax rev
enue in a budget-strapped state, pro
ponents of marijuana legalization in
California may see their pipe
dreams become reality this Novem
ber.

If the initiative passes in Novem
ber, the state would be allowed to
regulate marijuana use, growth and
sale in a manner similar to the regu
lation of alcohol. The measure, if
passed, would allow for adults 21
and older to possess less than one
ounce of marijuana for personal use.
Currently, possession of less than
one ounce is a misdemeanor that
carries a $lOO fine.
The initiative's proponents em
phasize the potential economic
gains that would come from sales
taxes and lowered costs for process
ing the misdemeanors.
Currently, Stanford's Depart
ment of Public Safety (DPS) handles
cases of marijuana possession and
use on campus.

"[DPS] enforces the laws current
ly prohibiting the possession or use
of marijuana unless with a valid and
current medical marijuana card,"
wrote DPS spokesperson William
Larson in an e-mail to The Daily.
DPS handled 34 marijuana-relat
ed cases in 2009,24 cases in 2008 and
22 cases in 2007, according to Larson.
Not all the cases handled by DPS in
volved students. He was unable to
comment on DPS' estimate of the
percentage of regular marijuana
users on campus that receive penal-

ties from campus law enforcement
officers.
"Who's going to report you?"
asked one student, who was granted
anonymity because of the legal sensi
tivity of the issue. "If anyone is upset
with someone's smoking habits, they
would probably go to the R.A. [resi
dent assistant] first rather than the
police."
Larson said DPS practices would
change to reflect new laws if the ini

tiative is passed in November, but he
would not be more specific because
the bill's passage is still uncertain.
In regard to DPS' effectiveness in
enforcing marijuana laws on campus,
"as with any law, we enforce it to
serve as both a deterrent and to hold
those accountable for violations,"
Larson said.
