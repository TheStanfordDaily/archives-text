A brief endorsement scuffle arose
on Wednesday when The Stanford
Review reported that the Green Al
liance for Innovative Action had
dropped its endorsements of Senate
candidates Rebecca Sachs 'l3 and
Carolyn Simmons 'l3 after they used
non-recycled paper to print campaign
fliers.
GAIA representatives confirmed
they took back their endorsement of
Sachs and Simmons after discovering
the two had printed fliers on new
paper a violation of a "sustainable
campaign" agreement between candi
dates and GAIA.
Sachs told The Daily she turned to
using non-recycled materials because
of the volume of flyers she decided to
print after receiving GAIA's endorse
ment. Simmons said she was "unable"
to follow the endorsement guidelines.
David Geeter II 'll said the candi
dates' use of new paper violated the
"values of the community" of sustain
ability organizations that form
GAIA.
Noel Crisostomo 'lO, another
GAIA representative, said the en
dorsement was about "building trust"
in the long term with elected ASSU
officers, and that whoever is elected
this week would be welcome to partic
ipate in projects of GAIA's member
organizations.
