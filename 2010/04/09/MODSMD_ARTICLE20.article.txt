## PAC-10 SLAM Card prepares for stretch run 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a weekend of emotionally charged
matches against two top-10 teams in Los An
geles, the Stanford men's tennis team (13-5,2-
1 Pac-10) returned to the Farm for a five
game homestand against somewhat easier
competition.
The Cardinal got off to a good start on
Tuesday with a 6-1 thrashing of No. 53 UC-
Irvine (13-8). Head coach John Whitlinger
mixed up the lineup against the Anteaters
and watched all of his substitutes coast to vic
tory.
Junior Ted Kelly and freshman Walker
Kehrer played doubles together for the first
time in the dual match season and did not dis
appoint. The pair thumped Irvine's Sam
Gould and Fabian Matthews, 8-2 an im
pressive victory considering that Gould and
Matthews played No. 1 and 2 singles respec
tively on Tuesday.
"It's nice to get those guys in the lineup,"
Whitlinger said. "You never know when
someone is going to get injured, so you need
them to be ready to go."
Stanford's two other doubles teams rolled
with similar ease. The nation's top doubles
team of sophomores Bradley Klahn and
Ryan Thacher handled Steven Henderson
and Zac Tsai, 8-3. The No. 31-ranked pair of
senior Richard Wire and junior Alex Clayton
dominated Khunpol Issara and Jon Kazarian,
8-1.
In singles, Whitlinger's other sub, fresh
man Matt Kandath, impressed. Kandath had
not played in a singles match since losing to
USC's Daniel Nguyen on Feb. 27. The fresh
man defeated Irvine's Ryan Mayer in straight
sets, 6-3,6-1.
No. 5 Klahn breezed past Gould 6-1,6-1 in
the top singles match. Klahn has turned him
self into a legitimate contender for the
NCAA individual title with a 23-5 record this
year against some of the best competition in
the country.
No. 45 Alex Clayton couldn't capitalize on
the momentum generated by his dramatic
three-set victory on Saturday against UCLA
to clinch the match for the Cardinal. Clayton
fell to Matthews 6-3,7-6.
Thacher shut out Tsai in consecutive sets,
6-0, 6-0. Junior Greg Hirshman clinched the
team match with a straight set victory over Is
sara, 6-0, 6-1. Hirshman is now 12-2 in dual
matches this season.

Wire was challenged by Henderson, but
pulled out a victory 6-4, 7-6. The tennis pro
gram will be honoring Wire and fellow senior

After dominating UC-lrvine in a mid-week match, Stanford returns to conference competition this weekend. To preserve a shot at the Pac-10 title,
the Cardinal must defeat both Washington and Oregon this weekend. Stanford is also looking for home-court advantage in the NCAA first round.

celebration before Stanford's match
against Oregon on Saturday after
noon.

Morrissey, who grew up in
Dublin, Ireland, has been unable to
play this year after tearing his ACL.
"Both guys are going to be
missed," Whitlinger said. "Paul has
n't been able to play but he's been
doing a great job helping out at prac
tice.

"Richard has been a real pleas
ure to coach," he continued. "He
fights until the bitter end and really
puts the work in."
Before Senior Day, the Cardinal
will take on No. 22 Washington (16-
3,1-2) on Friday at the Taube Fami
ly Tennis Center.
Washington boasts a 6-1 road
record in dual matches this season.
The Huskies' diverse roster includes
players from Hungary, South Africa,
Norway, India, Austria, Thailand
and Canada.

"Any Pac-10 match is going to be
a tough one," Whitlinger explained.
"We know them and they know us."
Washington starts a freshman,
Kyle McMorrow (14-4), at the sec
ond singles slot. McMorrow was a
high school classmate of Stanford
freshman Denis Lin at Thousand
Oaks High School in Thousand
Oaks, Calif.

Everyone in the Pac-10 is chasing
USC, the defending national cham
pion, who leads the conference with
a 4-0 record. Stanford will have to
beat Washington, Oregon and Cali
fornia to have a chance at the Pac-10
title. However, it is highly unlikely
that USC will stumble and lose both
of its remaining Pac-10 matches.
Stanford's main priority now
might be making sure that it can play
at home in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament. If Stanford
wins its remaining five matches, it
will likely be one of the 16 first
round hosts.

"Every match we play is a prepa
ration for the NCAA Tournament
down the road," Whitlinger said.
"We want to be playing our best ten
nis before the tournament."

Stanford will try to extend a two
match winning streak against Wash
ington on Friday at 1:30 p.m. On Sat
urday, the Cardinal will square off
against No. 72 Oregon at 1 p.m. Both
matches will be held at the Taube
Family Tennis Center.
