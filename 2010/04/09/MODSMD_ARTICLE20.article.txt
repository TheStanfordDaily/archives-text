## PAC-10 SLAM Card prepares for stretch run 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a weekend of emotionally charged
matches against two top-10 teams in Los An
geles, the Stanford men's tennis team (13-5,2-
1 Pac-10) returned to the Farm for a five
game homestand against somewhat easier
competition.
The Cardinal got off to a good start on
Tuesday with a 6-1 thrashing of No. 53 UC-
Irvine (13-8). Head coach John Whitlinger
mixed up the lineup against the Anteaters
and watched all of his substitutes coast to vic
tory.
Junior Ted Kelly and freshman Walker
Kehrer played doubles together for the first
time in the dual match season and did not dis
appoint. The pair thumped Irvine's Sam
Gould and Fabian Matthews, 8-2 an im
pressive victory considering that Gould and
Matthews played No. 1 and 2 singles respec
tively on Tuesday.
"It's nice to get those guys in the lineup,"
Whitlinger said. "You never know when
someone is going to get injured, so you need
them to be ready to go."
Stanford's two other doubles teams rolled
with similar ease. The nation's top doubles
team of sophomores Bradley Klahn and
Ryan Thacher handled Steven Henderson
and Zac Tsai, 8-3. The No. 31-ranked pair of
senior Richard Wire and junior Alex Clayton
dominated Khunpol Issara and Jon Kazarian,
8-1.
In singles, Whitlinger's other sub, fresh
man Matt Kandath, impressed. Kandath had
not played in a singles match since losing to
USC's Daniel Nguyen on Feb. 27. The fresh
man defeated Irvine's Ryan Mayer in straight
sets, 6-3,6-1.
No. 5 Klahn breezed past Gould 6-1,6-1 in
the top singles match. Klahn has turned him
self into a legitimate contender for the
NCAA individual title with a 23-5 record this
year against some of the best competition in
the country.
No. 45 Alex Clayton couldn't capitalize on
the momentum generated by his dramatic
three-set victory on Saturday against UCLA
to clinch the match for the Cardinal. Clayton
fell to Matthews 6-3,7-6.
Thacher shut out Tsai in consecutive sets,
6-0, 6-0. Junior Greg Hirshman clinched the
team match with a straight set victory over Is
sara, 6-0, 6-1. Hirshman is now 12-2 in dual
matches this season.

Wire was challenged by Henderson, but
pulled out a victory 6-4, 7-6. The tennis pro
gram will be honoring Wire and fellow senior

After dominating UC-lrvine in a mid-week match, Stanford returns to conference competition this weekend. To preserve a shot at the Pac-10 title,
the Cardinal must defeat both Washington and Oregon this weekend. Stanford is also looking for home-court advantage in the NCAA first round.
