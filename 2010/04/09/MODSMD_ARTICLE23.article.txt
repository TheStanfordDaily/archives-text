# Tiger remains a great golfer
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
If you have been reading my
columns for a while, you will
know that I cannot pass up
this opportunity to write
about one of my favorite ath
letes, Tiger Woods.
Yes, he is still one of my favorite
athletes. I do not condone his actions
and his behavior in his personal life.
But I still respect what he does on the
golf course and the excellence of his
career. What he does on the course is
separate from what he does off the
course. Yes, his image has been per
manently tarnished, and perhaps he
is not the role model that he once was.
But he is allowed to go back to his job.
And yesterday he did.
His first tee shot was typical Tiger.
The twirl of the club and the picking
up of the tee early signified his ball
went right down the middle, I wonder
if he was nervous. I'm sure he walked
down that first fairway and let out a
huge exhale, a physical and maybe
even a mental one.

And after his first 18 holes, the
man is where he always was before he
left the game: in contention. Tiger
shot four-under and is two shots back
of the leader, Fred Couples. Anyone
who knows "vintage Tiger" should
know that this is about as good of a
start as he could have wanted.

Some are saying that this weekend
could be the biggest media event of
the last 10 years, next to Barack
Obama's presidential inauguration.
The scandal that made it onto the
front cover of the New York Post
more times than September 11 (that's
a record) comes full circle now that
Tiger has returned to the course. Golf
fans will surely watch him. Anyone
who was a minor fan before all this
will watch him. People who followed
the headlines will probably watch
him and mark that a near in
evitability for everyone if he is still in
contention on Sunday.
In terms of golf, it was pretty much
nothing new for a tournament featur
ing Tiger Woods. Everything was
back to normal. He got a spirited wel
come. He got huge followings and
huge cheers. The fans gave him a
standing ovation on the driving range
and were five-deep on the practice
green. They were 70-deep on the first
tee and all the way down the first fair
way. While Augusta is known for its
love for golf and golfers no matter
who is playing, the fans gravitated to
Tiger —just like the old days.
It was all about wanting Woods to
do well. And I think that's how it
should be. He has apologized exten
sively and taken full responsibility.
No matter how people feel about him
personally, they should at the very
least accept the fact that he wants to
be a better person, husband, father
and ambassador for the game of golf.
It may be hard to accept the fact that
he is returning to golf (some say it is
way too soon), but the fans yesterday
welcomed him back into the game
and will continue to for the next three
days.

ESPN milked every single mo
ment, as everyone and everything
milked every moment of the past five
months of news and information.
They must have known how many
people were going to tune in to his
first tee shot yesterday the net
work aired everything, from his prac
tice putting and his practice hitting to
the entire six or seven minutes lead
ing up to his first shot.
Some players don't even get one
shot on TV all day.

Commentators Scott Van Pelt and
Andy North proceeded to explain to
everyone what Tiger was doing when
he was putting on the practice green,
like it was some infomercial giving a
golf clinic. They were explaining
everything he was doing from putting
to walking around to breathing. It
was kind of ridiculous if you ask me,
but not ridiculous at all after the
amount of coverage the man and his
story has gotten around the world
over the past five months.
"At a major we are usually most
interested in the final shot on Sun
day," Van Pelt said. "But this time we
are most interested in the first shot on
Thursday."
I want Tiger to win. I think it
would be incredible. I would love to

see the headlines that emerge all over
the place. I would love to see the air

clear just a bit for him. I would love
for people to move on a bit, not for
getting but realizing that his mistake
is (hopefully) over and done with.
What he did was wrong and he is de
serving of all the scrutiny and extra
neous coverage. But to return like
this and win the most prestigious golf
tournament of the year would just be
spectacular.
With Fred Couples, Phil Mickelson
and Tom Watson at the top of the
leaderboard after day one, this has the

makings of a great tournament. How
interesting would it be if the big
names and Tiger charged into the
weekend in the lead? Millions of peo
ple would tune in to this one, to see if
Tiger can do it. It sure would be a nice
change to see his name associated
with something positive, as it has been
for so many years leading up to now.
Tiger is back, the leaderboard is
stacked and the Masters is off the
ground running. There's almost no
better story.

Danny Belch probably doesn't realize
that he's really just adding to the media
frenzy. Complain about hearing too
much of Tiger at dbelchl@stanford.

names and Tiger charged into the
weekend in the lead? Millions of peo
ple would tune in to this one, to see if
Tiger can do it. It sure would be a nice
change to see his name associated
with something positive, as it has been
for so many years leading up to now.
Tiger is back, the leaderboard is
stacked and the Masters is off the
ground running. There's almost no
better story.

Danny Belch probably doesn't realize
that he's really just adding to the media
frenzy. Complain about hearing too
much of Tiger at dbelchl@stanford.
