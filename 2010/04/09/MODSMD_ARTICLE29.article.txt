As its creatively titled name
would suggest, She 8c
FFim's "Volume Two" is
very much the sequel to their
2008 debut, "Volume One." The
duo, comprised of singer-actress
Zooey Deschanel ("(500) Days of
Summer," "Elf") and musician M.

Ward, presents a new batch of
sunny, '7os pop-inflected ditties
perfect for cruising along the
beach or road tripping back to
Americana. Deschanel has been
providing the masses with retro
hip adorableness for pretty much
the past decade, ever since 2000's
"Almost Famous." Kudos to her
for succeeding where many others
have failed comfortably strad
dling the line between actress and
musician.
Although the band is a
collaboration between Deschanel
and Ward, it's really a showcase
for Deschanel's substantial song
writing and singing skills. Her
personality shines through all 13
tracks. Their sophomore effort is
much more polished and put
together than their debut.
"Volume Two" has more of a nat
ural flow and fancier production
than the girl and boy with a guitar
style of "Volume One." However
this comes at a cost their new
glossiness lacks some of the spon
taneity that made their first
album so charming.
It would be easy, but
incorrect, to classify She & Him as
another indie act they're quite
the opposite. Their music isn't
indie by any means so much as it
is just pure, unabashed pop.
While perhaps not the greatest
singer, Deschanel sings completely

unaffectedly, without any of the
traces of pretension that bog
down so many hipster artists. She
sings as sweetly and earnestly as a
choirgirl. Her voice on "Volume
Two" is airier and, at times, wist
ful, particularly on opening track
"Thieves." Deschanel's voice is

shrouded in a pronounced echo,
producing a dreamlike quality for
the song. It sounds best when
grounded by the smooth warmth
of Ward's voice, like on their

NRBQ cover "Ridin' in My Car,"
one of the standout tracks on the
album.
Deschanel and Ward pay
tribute to their influences with
pretty, Beach Boys-esque har
monies and twangy, laidback gui
tars. The smiling harmonies and
clear, bouncy piano of "Don't
Look Back" are a nod to the all
girl pop groups of the '6os.
The opening guitar of
their single "In the Sun" radiates
warm sunlight. Musically, it feels
like an actual slice of the sun,

even though Deschanel is croon
ing about being brushed off.
Likewise, even though Deschanel
pines for her faraway lover on
"Home," you know she does it
with a blithe smile on her face.
Listeners can either toss their light
melodies aside or embrace She &
Him's effervescent optimism, but
regardless, it's clear in their music
that Deschanel and Ward love
what they're doing. It's that glee
ful sincerity that keeps their
music so honest.
She 8c Him's cheerful
pop confections are not for every
one. Some may find their saccha
rine melodies too sickly sweet to
stomach. However, they are not
making music for the cynical.
With She 8c Him, you know
exactly what you're getting. To
complain otherwise is just being
difficult, like wishing that smiley
face sticker wasn't so irritatingly
happy. With "Volume Two," She 8c
Him is ringing in a summer sea
son full of fizzy fun, lazy, hot
afternoons and carefree days frol-

icking in the sun. It's up to you if
you want to join, but we all know
where they'll be.
