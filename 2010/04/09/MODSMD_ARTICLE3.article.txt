## Gladwell talks risk-taking 
### DANA SHERNE STAFF WRITER 
Canadian journalist and pop soci
ologist Malcolm Gladwell spoke
Thursday to a packed house in
Hewlett Auditorium about the role
that serendipity plays in scientific dis
covery.

"The universe of things we do not
know is much larger than what we do
know and more importantly, we
don't know what we don't know,"
Gladwell said, noting that scientists
need to be open to accidental discov
eries.

Gladwell, a writer for The New
Yorker and best-selling author of sev
eral books, was the keynote speaker
for "Medicine and the Muse: An Arts,
Humanities and Medicine Sympo
sium," an event that drew more than
500 members of the Stanford commu
nity. Gladwell focused his speech on
the importance of chance and risk
taking in the process of discovery.
"I was really talking about the cre
ative process, and serendipity is such
an enormous part of the creative
process," Gladwell told The Daily in
an interview after the event. He said
that the scientific process needs to
leave room for the "beauty of
serendipity" and "accidental discov
ery."
Gladwell illustrated the point by
explaining that such accidental scientific discov
eries exist in a hierarchy, with findings that come
from a misapprehension of data, like that of
Christopher Columbus, lying at the bottom. At
the top of this structure, Gladwell places those
who, like Galileo with his telescope, rationally
engineer a situation to find surprising results
without any preconceptions or knowledge of
what they might find.
"I think that people... who take that step
into the unknown are the bravest of all scien
tists," Gladwell said. "When you look through
that telescope, you are completely in the dark
about what you will find."
To explain this kind of scientific process,
Gladwell told a story of Synta Pharmaceuticals,
a small drug company that tested a variety of
chemical compounds against many different
cancer strains hoping for a Galilean accidental
discovery. Or, in Gladwell's words, they were
"throwing everything against a wall and seeing
what sticks."
After devoting three years and countless re
sources to a drug made from one of the chemi
cal compounds that seemed to fight melanoma,
the heartbroken scientists learned that the drug
was ineffective.
"I find something extraordinarily meaning
ful and moving in Galilean serendipity," Glad
well said.'T don't know whether we talk enough
about scientists who find the courage to look
through the microscope without finding any
thing."
Gladwell contrasted their strategy with the
safer and more readily-funded rational drug de
sign method, where companies work backward
from the understanding of a disease. Although
relying on serendipity for science is riskier,
Gladwell said that funding needs to allow for a
variety of strategies because "we have to learn
to respect the mystery of the creative process."
Gladwell emphasized the point that at Stan
ford, students have a unique opportunity for ac
cidental discoveries.
"You have a formal structure but the point is,
the creative person is someone who wanders off
from that," he said. "It has to be supplemented
by these sort of flights of fancy, opening your self
up to different kinds of questions. An education
like here, which is rich... with the possibility for
so many unexpected encounters, is a beautiful
opportunity for serendipity."
