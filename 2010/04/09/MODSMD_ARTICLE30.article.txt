Tonight, make it a date
night.. . and by that I
don't necessarily mean find
a hot date, but rather go see "Date
Night." This film, opening this
weekend and directed by Shawn
Levy, stars comedic experts Tina
Fey and Steve Carell. I enjoyed it,
but was by no means blown away.
The story lacks depth and is gen
erally quite dumb, but Fey and
Carell do not disappoint.
Although probably an especially
great choice for admirers of these
two actors, the humor of this
movie is not just for fans of "30
Rock" or "The Office." It may be
silly and unrealistic, but these
flaws can be overlooked because

the film definitely entertains.
The premise of the movie
itself is clever, albeit unrealistic. A
conventional, married couple,
Phil and Claire Foster, decide to
venture to New York City for the
night for a small escape from
their seemingly boring and rou
tine life. When they are unable to
make a reservation at a swanky,
new restaurant, in a moment of
spontaneity, they assume the
identity of a couple (the
Tripplehorns) that has a reserva-

tion but has yet to claim their
table. While posing as this other
couple, Phil and Claire are asked
to step outside by two men who
appear to have figured out their
lie; however, these two men actu
ally believe them to be the
Tripplehorns and mistakenly hold
them at gunpoint. In order to get
out of this crazy situation, save
their lives, and be home in time to
take the kids to school, the Fosters
must make their way through a

crazy and hysterical night in the
city.
The strength of this film defi
nitely lies in its cast. Tina Fey and
Steve Carell are, unsurprisingly, a
hilarious and well-suited duo.
They play off each other well, as
their respective styles of humor
work to make the jokes seemed
unforced and natural. Delivering
such laughable characters is a tes
tament to their comedic talents
because, at times, the story is
incredibly ridiculous. Somehow

Fey and Carell manage to shine in
a story that is not terrible, butvery
much sub-par.
Beyond Fey and Carell, a
lot of other great actors appear in
the film. Mark Wahlberg, Ray
Liotta, Mila Kunis, Mark Ruffalo,
Kristen Wiig, Common, Taraji P.
Henson, Leighton Meester and
even James Franco make cameos
to either aid or oppose the Fosters
throughout the adventure
(Franco, of course, being the most

funny). Fey and Carell may be the
masters, but there was good,
humorous chemistry between
most of the minor characters and
the two protagonists.
There are a lot of laugh
out-loud funny parts, such as
night boating, the real
Tripplehorns, stripping, etc. While
it does have strengths, overall
don't expect too much from the
story let's just say it's not very
profound. I would definitely
advise going anticipating an unre
alistic and zany story, because
that's what it delivers. Without the

witty cast, the movie would just
be stupid. It is very much your
typical run-from-the-bad-guys
movie where the protagonists
miraculously never get shot, know
people who have access to just
what they need, and confront
mafia men, gun-wielding police
and criminals. So, while I was not
jumping out of my chair at the
greatness of this film, at points, I
was very close to rolling on the
floor laughing. I'd hesitantly rec
ommend you see it, with the dis
claimer that you shouldn't expect
much. The bottom line is that
Tina Fey and Steve Carell are
funny; very, very funny. I was not
moved by the artistry or
enthralled by the plot, but I did
leave the theatre in a very good

mood. After laughing so much,
it's hard not to.
