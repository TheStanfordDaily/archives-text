Late-night snacking is an
inescapable part of college
life. When class at noon
seems early and staying up until 4
a.m. is completely normal, addi
tional sustenance after dinner just
makes sense. For me, it started
out innocently enough a hand
ful of chocolate chips while doing
a Stats 60 problem set, maybe
Easy Mac after a party. As fresh
man year went on, my late-night
snack habit escalated into a full
blown addiction. Spring quarter,
I'm pretty sure my friends and I
were averaging six In-n-Out trips
a week. (Ew, right? The cashiers
learned all our names). But it
took being a wiser, more accli
mated sophomore for a truly
unshakable late-night fixation to
develop I'm obsessed with
boba. Boba can be hard to

explain to outsiders. Wikipedia,
the serious scholarly source, help
fully describes boba, also known
as "pearl tea," as "a Taiwanese
chilled tea mixed with some vari
ation of fruit syrup and milk."
Boba comes in a wide range of
flavors, although personal experi
ence suggests that not all flavors
(see: watermelon) are actually fit
for human consumption. At the
bottom of the tea are gummy
balls of tapioca, which are also
called "boba" yes, this double
naming is confusing and no, I
don't know what tapioca is actu
ally made of (it's either unicorn
tears or cassava root, based on my
Wikipedia sleuthing). But to be
honest, boba is an acquired taste
(it took me a year), the love of

which develops independently of
knowing its origins or ingredi
ents.
I get my boba fix at a
place called Verde in downtown
Mountain View. Verde

is a cramped, often
bustling space with a
cozy, eccentric and
slightly shabby
atmosphere. Leigh
Tanner 'l2 grew up in
Asia and raves that
the boba at Verde is
"such an authentic
experience ... and
delicious!" Natalie
Davies 'l3 agrees
"the pearl-tea is
mind-blowing." The
staff is friendly, albeit
not super good at
helping boba neo
phytes navigate the
long list of flavor
choices. I personally ,
like to stick to classic J

pearl milk tea a super sweet, I
creamy black tea drink. I also
really like the mint flavor, whose
Tiffany-blue color complements
its refreshing taste.
Both flavors come with

milk, but milk-free options also
exist. I like the passion fruit fla
vor, although that's a controversial
stance among my friends
Natalie called it "awful." Boba
comes in two sizes: regular and
large, which is truly massive and
comes in an almost comically
out-of-proportion cup. You can
also ask for double or triple the
tapioca balls (for an added cost),
a choice Taylor Goodspeed 'l2
calls "necessary," but that Katie
Hanigan 'l2 calls "gross." At about
$3-4 a drink, boba at Verde is an
affordable and delicious snack
that 1 can't recommend more
highly. Who thought gummy balls
of cassava root could taste so
good?
